Dallas County is included in the Dallas-Arlington-Fort Worth metropolitan statistical area—colloquially referred to as the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Municipal expansion within Dallas County has blurred the geographic lines between cities and between neighboring counties.[2]\n\nIts county seat is the city of Dallas,[3] which is also Texas' third-largest city and the ninth-largest city in the United States. The county was founded in 1846 and was possibly named for George Mifflin Dallas, the 11th Vice President of the United States under U.S. President James K. Polk.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 909 square miles (2,350 km2), of which 873 square miles (2,260 km2) is land and 36 square miles (93 km2) (4.0%) is water.[4] 3,519 acres of the county is contained within 21 county-owned nature preserves, which were acquired through the county's Open Space Program.[5][6]\n\nAdjacent counties\n\n[edit]\n\nDenton County (northwest)\n\nCollin County (northeast)\n\nRockwall County (east)\n\nKaufman County (southeast)\n\nEllis County (south)\n\nTarrant County (west)\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nCommunities\n\n[edit]\n\nCities (multiple counties)\n\n[edit]\n\nCarrollton (partly in Denton County and a small part in Collin County)\n\nCedar Hill (small part in Ellis County)\n\nCombine (partly in Kaufman County)\n\nCoppell (small part in Denton County)\n\nDallas (county seat) (small parts in Collin, Denton, Kaufman and Rockwall counties)\n\nFerris (mostly in Ellis County)\n\nGarland (small parts in Collin and Rockwall counties)\n\nGlenn Heights (partly in Ellis County)\n\nGrand Prairie (partly in Tarrant County and a small part in Ellis County)\n\nGrapevine (mostly in Tarrant County and a small part in Denton County)\n\nLewisville (mostly in Denton County)\n\nMesquite (small part in Kaufman County)\n\nOvilla (mostly in Ellis County)\n\nRichardson (small part in Collin County)\n\nRowlett (small part in Rockwall County)\n\nSachse (small part in Collin County)\n\nSeagoville (small part in Kaufman County)\n\nWylie (mostly in Collin County and a small part in Rockwall County)\n\nCities\n\n[edit]\n\nTowns\n\n[edit]\n\nAddison\n\nHighland Park\n\nSunnyvale\n\nUnincorporated areas\n\n[edit]\n\nCensus-designated places\n\n[edit]\n\nBear Creek Ranch\n\nOther communities\n\n[edit]\n\nSand Branch\n\nHistorical communities\n\n[edit]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18502,743—18608,665215.9%187013,81459.4%188033,488142.4%189067,042100.2%190082,72623.4%1910135,74864.1%1920210,55155.1%1930325,69154.7%1940398,56422.4%1950614,79954.3%1960951,52754.8%19701,327,32139.5%19801,556,39017.3%19901,852,81019.0%20002,218,89919.8%20102,368,1396.7%20202,613,53910.4%2023 (est.)2,606,358[13]−0.3%\n\nDallas County, Texas – Racial and ethnic composition\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

At the 2020 American Community Survey, the median household income increased to $61,870.[25]\n\nGovernment and politics\n\n[edit]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nDallas County, like all counties in Texas, is governed by a commissioners' court. This court consists of the county judge (the chairperson of the court), who is elected county-wide, and four commissioners who are elected by the voters in each of four precincts.\n\nThe Commissioners' Court is the policy-making body for the county; in addition, the county judge is the senior executive and administrative position in the county. The Commissioners' Court sets the county tax rate, adopts the budget, appoints boards and commissions, approves grants and personnel actions, and oversees the administration of county government. Each commissioner supervises a Road and Bridge District. The Commissioners' Court approves the budget and sets the tax rate for the hospital district, which is charged with the responsibility for providing acute medical care for citizens who otherwise would not receive adequate medical services.[26]\n\nCounty Commissioners\n\n[edit]\n\nOffice[27] Name Party County Judge Clay Jenkins Democratic Commissioner, Precinct 1 Theresa Daniel Democratic Commissioner, Precinct 2 Andrew Sommerman Democratic Commissioner, Precinct 3 John Wiley Price Democratic Commissioner, Precinct 4 Elba Garcia Democratic\n\nCounty Officials\n\n[edit]\n\nOffice[27] Name Party Criminal District Attorney John Creuzot Democratic District Clerk Felicia Pitre Democratic County Clerk John Warren Democratic Sheriff Marian Brown Democratic Tax Assessor-Collector John Ames Democratic Treasurer Pauline Medrano Democratic\n\nConstables\n\n[edit]\n\nOffice[27] Name Party Constable, Precinct 1 Tracey Gulley Democratic Constable, Precinct 2 Deanna Hammond Democratic Constable, Precinct 3 Ben Adamcik Republican Constable, Precinct 4 Edward Wright Democratic Constable, Precinct 5 Michael Orozco Democratic\n\nJustices of the Peace\n\n[edit]\n\nOffice[27] Name Party Justice of the Peace, Precinct 1, Place 1 Thomas G.

The building was the headquarters of the Texas School Book Depository Company until 1970. Assassin Lee Harvey Oswald shot President John F. Kennedy from a window located on the sixth floor which today houses the Sixth Floor Museum dedicated to the late president's memory.\n\nActs of the commissioners court are known as 'court orders'. These orders include setting county policies and procedures, issuing contracts, authorizing expenditures, and managing county resources and departments. Most importantly, the commissioners court sets the annual tax rate and the budget for Dallas County government and the courts. The commissioners also set the tax rate and budget for the Dallas County Hospital District which operates Parkland Hospital.\n\nThe commissioners court has direct control over all county offices and departments not otherwise administered by a county elected official. Those departments include Dallas County Elections, Health and Human Services, Facilities Management, Parks and Open Space Program, I.T. Services, Homeland Security and Emergency Services, among others. Through their budget making powers, the commissioners exercise indirect control over the District Attorney's office, Sheriff, District Clerk, County Clerk and County Treasurer. The commissioners also set the budget for each of the District, County, and Justice courts.\n\nDallas County employs a commissioners court administrator who is responsible for the day-to-day management of the commissioners court and implementing the Dallas County Master Plan and the directives of the commissioners court. The current commissioners court administrator is Darryl Martin who was hired by the commissioners in 2008.\n\nDallas County operates several jail facilities. They include:[28]\n\n111 Riverfront Blvd (Dallas)\n\nNorth Tower Jail\n\nSouth Tower Jail - also known as the \"Suzanne Kays Tower\"\n\nWest Tower Jail\n\nGovernment Center Jail - 600 Commerce Street (Dallas)\n\nDecker Detention Center - 899 North Stemmons Freeway (Dallas)\n\n(formerly) Suzanne Kays Jail - 521 North Industrial Boulevard (Dallas) - population integrated into the South Tower; demolished to clear way for the Trinity River Project[29]\n\nThe Texas Department of Criminal Justice operates the Hutchins State Jail for men in an unincorporated area adjacent to Hutchins.[30] Corrections Corporation of America operates the Dawson Unit, a co-gender state jail in Downtown Dallas, under contract.[31]\n\nFederal Correctional Institution, Seagoville, is located in Seagoville.\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nDallas County was one of the first areas of the South to break away from a Solid South voting pattern. This coincided with the county's explosive postwar growth. It swung from a 13-point win for Democrat Harry Truman in 1948 to a 23-point win for Republican Dwight Eisenhower in 1952. It would vote for the GOP at every election until 2004, except when Texas native Lyndon B. Johnson successfully ran for a full term as president on the Democratic ticket in 1964.\n\nIn the 2004 election, Democrats won their first countywide administrative office since 1986 by electing Lupe Valdez to the office of Dallas County Sheriff. The last Democratic countywide administrator was D. Connally elected County Surveyor prior to the office's abolition. Democrats also won three district court benches in 2004. Two years later in 2006, Democrats swept every contested countywide race including County Judge, District Clerk, County Clerk, District Attorney and County Treasurer as well as every contested judicial seat.\n\nFor most of the second half of the 20th century, Dallas County was one of the most conservative urban counties in the nation. Starting in 1996, Dallas County began voting more Democratic than the state of Texas as a whole, when Bill Clinton became only the fourth Democrat since Truman to win 40 percent of the vote. Former Governor of Texas George W. Bush managed relatively narrow wins in 2000 and 2004, even as he easily carried the state. This trend culminated in 2008 when the county swung dramatically to Barack Obama. Obama's coattails allowed Democrats to win the remaining Republican held judicial seats.\n\nSince the 2010s, Dallas County has been one of the most Democratic-leaning counties in Texas. In 2012, Obama won Dallas County by virtually the same margin as he had done in 2008. In 2016, Hillary Clinton increased the Democratic margin of victory even further. She became the first Democrat to win 60% of the county's vote since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944, while Donald Trump became the first Republican not to win 40% of the vote in the county for the first time since 1992.\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Dallas County, Texas[32] Year Republican Democratic Third party No. % No. % No. % 2020 307,076 33.29% 598,576 64.89% 16,861 1.83% 2016 262,945 34.34% 461,080 60.22% 41,657 5.44% 2012 295,813 41.57% 405,571 56.99% 10,228 1.44% 2008 310,000 41.89% 422,989 57.15% 7,085 0.96% 2004 346,246 50.35% 336,641 48.95% 4,822 0.70% 2000 322,345 52.58% 275,308 44.91% 15,386 2.51% 1996 260,058 46.78% 255,766 46.00% 40,129 7.22% 1992 256,007 38.72% 231,412 35.00% 173,833 26.29% 1988 347,094 58.38% 243,198 40.91% 4,246 0.71% 1984 405,444 66.41% 203,592 33.35% 1,460 0.24% 1980 306,682 59.18% 190,459 36.75% 21,072 4.07% 1976 263,081 56.65% 196,303 42.27% 5,001 1.08% 1972 305,112 69.53% 129,662 29.55% 4,021 0.92% 1968 184,193 50.66% 123,809 34.06% 55,552 15.28% 1964 137,065 45.06% 166,472 54.73% 621 0.20% 1960 149,369 62.16% 88,876 36.99% 2,054 0.85% 1956 125,361 65.06% 65,472 33.98% 1,862 0.97% 1952 118,218 62.73% 69,394 36.82% 850 0.45% 1948 35,664 37.80% 47,464 50.31% 11,216 11.89% 1944 21,099 22.44% 60,909 64.77% 12,028 12.79% 1940 16,574 25.06% 49,431 74.74% 131 0.20% 1936 7,204 14.51% 42,153 84.89% 300 0.60% 1932 8,919 19.12% 37,363 80.09% 371 0.80% 1928 27,272 60.89% 17,437 38.93% 78 0.17% 1924 8,618 21.63% 30,207 75.83% 1,012 2.54% 1920 4,984 23.35% 14,390 67.41% 1,973 9.24% 1916 2,554 15.71% 13,410 82.51% 289 1.78% 1912 590 6.09% 7,725 79.79% 1,367 14.12%\n\nDallas County has had three openly LGBT elected county officials: Lupe Valdez, elected Sheriff in 2004 and serving until 2017; Jim Foster, elected county judge in 2006, serving one term before defeat in the Democratic primary in 2010; and Gary Fitzsimmons, elected District Clerk in 2006.[33]\n\nState Board of Education members\n\n[edit]\n\nDistrict Name Party District 11 Patricia Hardy Republican District 12 Geraldine Miller Republican District 13 Erika Beltran Democratic\n\nTexas state representatives\n\n[edit]\n\nDistrict Name Party Residence District 100 Venton Jones Democratic Dallas District 102 Ana-Maria Ramos Democratic Dallas District 103 Rafael Anchia Democratic Dallas District 104 Jessica González Democratic Dallas District 105 Terry Meza Democratic Irving District 107 Victoria Neave Democratic Dallas District 108 Morgan Meyer Republican University Park District 109 Carl Sherman Sr. Democratic DeSoto District 110 Toni Rose Democratic Dallas District 111 Yvonne Davis Democratic Dallas District 112 Angie Chen Button Republican Richardson District 113 Rhetta Andrews Bowers Democratic Garland District 114 John Turner Democratic Dallas District 115 Julie Johnson Democratic Irving\n\nTexas state senators\n\n[edit]\n\nDistrict Name Party Residence District 2 Bob Hall Republican Edgewood (Van Zandt County) District 8 Angela Paxton Republican McKinney (Collin County) District 9 Kelly Hancock Republican Fort Worth District 16 Nathan Johnson Democratic Dallas District 23 Royce West Democratic Dallas\n\nUnited States representatives\n\n[edit]\n\nDistrict Name Party Residence Texas's 5th congressional district Lance Gooden Republican Terrell Texas's 6th congressional district Jake Ellzey Republican Waxahachie Texas's 24th congressional district Beth Van Duyne Republican Irving Texas's 30th congressional district Jasmine Crockett Democratic Dallas Texas's 32nd congressional district Colin Allred Democratic Dallas Texas's 33rd congressional district Marc Veasey Democratic Fort Worth\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nPrimary and secondary schools\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following school districts serve Dallas County:[34]\n\nCarrollton-Farmers Branch ISD (partly in Denton County)\n\nCedar Hill ISD\n\nCoppell ISD\n\nDallas ISD\n\nDeSoto ISD\n\nDuncanville ISD\n\nFerris ISD (mostly in Ellis County)\n\nGarland ISD\n\nGrand Prairie ISD\n\nGrapevine-Colleyville ISD (mostly in Tarrant County)\n\nHighland Park ISD\n\nIrving ISD\n\nLancaster ISD\n\nMesquite ISD\n\nRichardson ISD\n\nSunnyvale ISD\n\nWhite flight meant the decrease of non-Hispanic white students in Dallas County K-12 school districts from 1997 until the 2014–2015 school year. The number was 138,760 in the former and 61,538 in the latter; during 2014–2015 county charter schools had about 5,000 non-Hispanic white students. In 2016 Eric Nicholson of the Dallas Observer wrote that the bulk of white K-12 enrollment is shifting to more distant suburban areas beyond Dallas County, and that \"Teasing out causation is tricky\" but that the perception of poverty, which many white families wish to avoid, is tied with race.[35]\n\nWilmer-Hutchins Independent School District formerly served a part of the county.[36] In 2006 WHISD officially merged into DISD.[37]\n\nHigher education\n\n[edit]\n\nCommunity colleges\n\n[edit]\n\nDallas County is served by the Dallas College system of seven community colleges.[38] Dallas College is the designated community college for the entire county.[39]\n\nPublic universities\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are two public universities in Dallas County: the University of North Texas at Dallas and the University of Texas at Dallas, of which the latter is also partially located in Collin County.\n\nPrivate universities\n\n[edit]\n\nDallas Baptist University, located in Dallas\n\nUniversity of Dallas, located in Irving\n\nSouthern Methodist University, located in University Park\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nDallas Area Rapid Transit provides bus and rail service to many cities in Dallas County, with Dallas being the largest.\n\nThe Trinity Railway Express, operated jointly by Dallas Area Rapid Transit and Trinity Metro, provides commuter rail service to both Dallas County and Tarrant County, connecting downtown Fort Worth with Downtown Dallas.\n\nMajor highways\n\n[edit]\n\nNOTE: US 67 and US 77 are not signed fully along their routes in Dallas County.\n\nAirports\n\n[edit]\n\nCommercial Airports\n\n[edit]\n\nLove Field, located in Dallas, serves only domestic passengers.\n\nDallas/Fort Worth International Airport is partially located in the city of Irving in Dallas County, and Grapevine and Euless in Tarrant County.\n\nGeneral Aviation Airports\n\n[edit]\n\nAddison Airport is located in and owned by the city of Addison.\n\nDallas Executive Airport is located in and owned by the city of Dallas.\n\nMesquite Metro Airport is located in and owned by the city of Mesquite.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nTexas portal\n\nDallas County District Attorney\n\nList of museums in North Texas\n\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Dallas County, Texas\n\nRecorded Texas Historic Landmarks in Dallas County\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
