        "text": "Our History\n\nIn 1894, Parkland Hospital began as a clapboard building on the corner of Maple and Oak Lawn avenues. In August 2015, Parkland opened its new state-of-the-art facility. The 2.8-million-square-foot campus includes an acute care hospital licensed for 882 beds, the Ron J. Anderson, MD Clinic, the Moody Outpatient Center, logistics building and central utility plant. Medical technology and the size of our hospital have dramatically changed over the years, but our commitment to giving every patient the best possible care has deep roots.\n\nOur rich history of care continues today through our skilled professionals. That is a responsibility we eagerly take on, because we know that the ultimate measure of our success is in the satisfaction we get from serving the people of Dallas.\n\nMilestones\n\n1870's - 1943 | The first Parkland\n\n1940's - 1962 | On the move\n\n1963 - 1978 | Changing times\n\n1979 - 1999 | The modern Parkland emerges\n\n2000 - 2015 | A new Parkland for a new century\n\n2015 - Present Day | The future of healthcare"
