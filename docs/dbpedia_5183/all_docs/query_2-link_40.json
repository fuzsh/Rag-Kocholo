Pretrial detention and misdemeanor convictions do not restrict your voting rights in Texas.\n\nVoters without traditional residence:\n\nIt is not mandatory for citizens to possess a \"permanent home\" for voter registration. A citizen can provide an alternative description of their residence, even if they are experiencing homelessness, as long as it enables the authorities to identify and assign a voting precinct to them. This precinct assignment ensures that the voter receives the appropriate ballot. The mailing address on their registration form can be a P.O. box, local shelter, advocacy organization, outreach center, or the home of someone who will accept mail for them.\n\nAll citizens wishing to vote must be on the official list of registered voters.

Voters can mark a provisional ballot, and election workers set it aside until eligibility is verified at a later time.\n\nYou are eligible to vote a provisional ballot if:\n\nYou claim to be an eligible voter, but your name does not appear on the list of registered voters, and your registration cannot be determined by the voter registrar\n\nYou have applied for a ballot by mail, but have not returned it or canceled it\n\nYou vote during extended polling hours ordered by a state or federal court\n\nYou do not present any acceptable form of identification (read below)\n\nIf you claim to be registered, but your name is not on the list of registered voters, the presiding election judge will call the voter registrar to determine if you are registered.

Please contact your county election officials for the most up–to-date information.\n\nWHAT IF I NEED AN INTERPRETER?\n\nAn interpreter may be used if you and the election official cannot speak the same language.

The VUID is on your voter registration card, or you can find it by checking your voter registration status here\n\nI JUST MOVED TO TEXAS OR MOVED TO A NEW COUNTY IN TEXAS.

If you have a P.O. box where you receive your mail, put that P.O. box number in the space for the mailing address.\n\nThe voting systems used in Texas are optical scan, DRE, and paper ballots.\n\nWHAT IS OPTICAL SCAN VOTING?\n\nWith optical scan voting, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it.\n\nWith a pen or pencil, you fill in a little box, circle, or space between two arrows.\n\nWhen you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box.\n\nOr in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.\n\nWHAT IS DIRECT RECORDING ELECTRONIC VOTING?\n\nDirect Recording Electronic (DRE) is the newest system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.\n\nThere are many variations of DREs because many companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties, and states are trying them out.\n\nUsually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.\n\nSome of these devices will show all candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure).\n\nOn other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. There will probably be one thing on which to vote on each screen or page. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for the president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for a senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for.\n\nOther devices have a keypad, and some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.\n\nYou let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.\n\nWHAT IS PAPER BALLOT VOTING?\n\nPaper ballots are one of the oldest ways of voting in America. They are still used in a few places on Election Day.\n\nWhen you come to the polling place, you will get a paper ballot from the poll worker.\n\nYou take it to the voting booth, and use a pen or pencil to mark a box next to your candidate and issue choices.\n\nYou then drop the marked ballot into a sealed ballot box.\n\nThe following vendors are currently certified by the State of Texas: Election Systems & Software (ES&S) and Hart InterCivic\n\nYou can learn more about voting systems by checking out the Elections Assistance Commission's (EAC) resource."
