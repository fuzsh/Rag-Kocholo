        "text": "African American leaders in Dallas will hold a peaceful march Saturday morning on the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge to kick off the “State of the Black Man,” a movement that will advocate for better conditions and connect leaders across the African American community.\n\nThe goal of the march, which will begin at 9 a.m., is to kick off a “new era” for Dallas in terms of Black leadership, said Keio Gamble, founder of the State of the Black Man.\n\nRelated:Dallas native advocating for Black, brown youth reflects on equity work\n\n“It’s time to take action,” said Gamble at a news conference at Dallas City Hall. “Everyone knows the problems, but it’s now the time for solutions.”\n\nThe peaceful march will commemorate the historic Selma to Montgomery march, a series of three marches in March 1965 from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. The first march on March 7, 1965, was met with violent opposition in an event that became known as “Bloody Sunday.”\n\nRelated:Has Black entrepreneurship hit a record during Joe Biden’s presidency?\n\nThese marches were organized to protest the blocking of Black Americans’ right to vote by the systemic racism of the Jim Crow South.\n\nAt the news conference in Dallas, leaders said that Black men need to show up for their communities. That’s why they called the march and are starting the movement.\n\n“I remember when we used to have community leaders and activists who actually stood for the Black community,” said Mar Butler, founder of Black Male Alliance. “It is true that we, as Black men, have sat back and watched the dismantling of our community.”\n\nFood deserts, incarceration, homelessness and access to mental health are some of the issues the movement will focus on to improve the quality of life for African Americans in Dallas.\n\nRelated:Two Save A Lot stores in southern Dallas are closing, increasing food insecurity\n\nIn Dallas, about 25% of the population is African American, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe movement wants to start networking groups across the city so the community knows where to seek help and find resources.\n\nLeaders urged young men to get involved early with issues important to their communities and seek a mentor to help them succeed.\n\nMen of all ages are invited to participate in the march, and women and children can watch the men crossing the bridge to recreate the historic civil rights moment.\n\nFor more information about the event and to stay in touch with the movement, check their Instagram page at “thestateoftheblackman.”\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nState of the Black Man march\n\nWhen: Saturday, March 30 at 9 a.m.\n\nWhere: Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge, 3101 Gulden Lane, Dallas 75212"
