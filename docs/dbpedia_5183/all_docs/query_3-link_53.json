        "text": "National Preparedness Level 5\n\nas of July 18 at 7:30 a.m. MDT (on a scale from 1 to 5)\n\nCurrent hours for the National Fire Information Center are\n\n(MST) 8:00 am - 4:30pm, Monday - Friday\n\n208-387-5050\n\nThis report is currently updated daily.\n\nPlease check the IMSR for more information.\n\nAugust 14, 2024\n\nAs of this morning, 75 large active wildfires are being managed with full suppression strategies nationwide. Current wildfires have burned 2,337,468 acres. More than 26,000 wildland firefighters and support personnel are assigned to wildfires, including 21 complex and 5 Type 1 incident management teams, 578 crews, 1,357 engines, 152 helicopters, and six Modular Airborne Fire Fighting Systems, or MAFFS. Sixty fireline management personnel from Australia and New Zealand are assigned to support large fires in the Northwest Area.\n\nSince January 1, 29,785 wildfires have burned 5,365,192 acres in the United States. This is about one million acres above the 10-year average number of acres burned. More than 25,600 wildfires have been caused by people (and thus could have been prevented), compared to only about 3,700 ignited by lightning. As wildfires continue to threaten communities and natural landscapes, it's crucial that we all do our part to prevent new fires from starting. Remember, it only takes a single spark to start a wildfire, but together, we can prevent them.\n\nEvacuation orders are in effect on 16 wildfires. If you're in an area threatened by wildfires, your safety is the top priority. When evacuation orders are issued, it's crucial to act quickly and follow the guidance of local authorities. Remember, your safety and the safety of your loved ones is what matters most. Trust the experts, follow evacuation orders, and stay safe. Learn more about evacuation plans and animal evacuation tips at https://www.ready.gov/\n\nThere are fuels and fire behavior advisories issued for Colorado's Front Range and Eastern Wyoming, Southwest Oregon, the region east of the Cascades in Oregon and Washington, and California. Residents, travelers, or workers on their way to any of these states should be advised and familiarize themselves with the elevated risks.\n\nFor more information about the mobilization of wildland firefighters from Australia and New Zealand visit the international support page.\n\nNote: The current reporting from source data for year-to-date figures appears to be underreporting fire acreage in some geographic areas affecting the overall national statistics. Given the very high tempo and scale of national current fire activity, there will be delays in reconciling, especially from areas with large fires and dynamic fire activity. Adjustments may occur as the accuracy of fire locations, mapping and final fire reporting is reconciled."
