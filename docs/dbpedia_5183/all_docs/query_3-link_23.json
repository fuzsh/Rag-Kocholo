This National Historic Landmark served as a sanctuary for the mentally ill beginning in the mid-1800s. This 160-year-old asylum holds fascinating stories of Civil War raids, a gold robbery, the “curative” effects of architecture, and the efforts of determined individuals to help better the lives of the mentally ill.\n\nTour this nationally recognized historic landmark and see how it left a lasting impression on local and national history. We offer a variety of historic and paranormal tours during our season.\n\nWe will be open Tuesday through Sunday. Our tour season will begin on March 30, 2024. for daytime historic tours. Ghost hunts of this massive building run year-round.\n\nOpen March 30th – November 10th\n\nHistoric Tours will leave every hour on the hour. Paranormal Tours leave every 2 hours. The last 45-minute tour leaves at 5:00 p.m. and the 90-minute tour leaves at 4:00 p.m. after we reopen for walk-in tours, on March 30th, 2024.\n\nTour Hours\n\nNote: Please dress appropriately for the current weather conditions.
