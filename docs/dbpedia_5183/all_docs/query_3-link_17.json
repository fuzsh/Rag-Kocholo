        "text": "The County of Pike was separated from Wayne County on March 26, 1814. Wayne had been separated from Northhampton on March 21, 1798, and Northhampton had been formed from part of Bucks County on March 11, 1752. Bucks was one of the original counties created by William Penn in 1682. When formed in 1814, Pike County included the Townships of Middle Smithfield, Delaware, Upper Smithfield, Lackawaxen and Palmyra. By the Act of April 1, 1836 , a portion of Pike County was cut off to form part of Monroe County; otherwise, it's boundaries remain as they were established by the Act of 1814. It was named for Zebulon Montgomery Pike, discoverer of Pike's Peak and a General killed in the war of 1812. The County Seat is Milford. The original Courthouse was constructed in 1815. The present Courthouse was completed in 1874. The Administration Building was completed in 1985. The latest County facility is the Pike County Jail which was completed in 1995.\n\nBlooming Grove Township\n\nHours of Operation:\n\nOffice Hours: Daily 8:00 am - 4:00 pm\n\nSupervisors Meetings: 1st & 3rd Mondays of the month at 6:00 pm\n\nPlanning Commission Meetings: 2nd Wednesday of the month at 6:00 pm Read More\n\nDelaware Township\n\nHours of Operation:\n\nOffice Hours: Daily 8:00 am - 4:00 pm\n\nSupervisors Meetings: 2nd & 4th Wednesday of the month at 7:00 pm\n\nPlanning Commission Meetings: 1st & 3rd Tuesday of the month at 6:30 pm Read More\n\nDingman Township\n\nHours of Operation:\n\nOffice Hours: Daily 8:30 am - 4:30 pm\n\nSupervisors Meetings: 1st & 3rd Tuesday of the month at 7:00 pm\n\nPlanning Commission Meetings: 2nd & 4th Wednesday of the month at 7:00 pm Read More\n\nGreene Township\n\nHours of Operation:\n\nOffice Hours: Daily 8:00 am - 2:30 pm\n\nSupervisors Meetings: 1st Wednesday of the month at 7:00 pm\n\nPlanning Commission Meetings: 4th Wednesday of the month at 7:00 pm Read More\n\nLackawaxen Township\n\nHours of Operation:\n\nOffice Hours: Monday, Wednesday and Friday 7:00 am - 3:00 pm; Tuesday and Thursday by Appointment\n\nSupervisors Meetings: 3rd Monday of the month at 7:00 pm\n\nPlanning Commission Meetings: 1st Wednesday of the month at 6:00 pm Read More\n\nLehman Township\n\nHours of Operation:\n\nOffice Hours: Daily 8:00 am - 4:00 pm\n\nSupervisors Meetings: 2nd Thursday of the month at 3:00 pm\n\nPlanning Commission Meetings: 2nd Thursday of the month at 7:00 pm Read More\n\nMatamoras Borough\n\nHours of Operation:\n\nOffice Hours: Monday-Friday 8:00 am - 3:30 pm\n\nCouncil Meetings: 2nd Tuesday of the month at 7:30 pm\n\nPlanning Commission Meetings: 3rd Tuesday of the month at 7:00 pm Read More\n\nMilford Borough\n\nHours of Operation:\n\nOffice Hours: Monday- Friday as posted\n\nSupervisors Meetings: 3rd Tuesday of the month at 7:00 pm at 109 West Catharine Street\n\nPlanning Commission Meetings: 2nd Monday of the month at 7:00 pm at 109 West Catharine Street Read More\n\nMilford Township\n\nHours of Operation:\n\nOffice Hours: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday - 9:00 am - 1:00 pm\n\nSupervisors Meetings: 1st and 3rd Monday of the month at 7:00 pm\n\nPlanning Commission Meetings: 4th Tuesday of the month at 7:00 pm Read More\n\nPalmyra Township\n\nHours of Operation:\n\nOffice Hours: Monday - Friday 8:00 am - 2:00 pm\n\nSupervisors Meetings: 1st and 3rd Tuesday of the month at 7:00 pm\n\nPlanning Commission Meetings: 2nd Tuesday of the month at 7:00pm Read More\n\nPorter Township\n\nHours of Operation:\n\nOffice Hours: Office not Staffed, please use contact information provided above\n\nSupervisors Meetings: 1st Monday of the month at 4:00 pm\n\nPlanning Commission Meetings: 1st Monday of the month at 3:00 pm Read More\n\nShohola Township\n\nHours of Operation:\n\nOffice Hours: Monday - Friday 8:30 am - 4:30 pm\n\nSupervisor Meetings: 2nd Thursday of the month at 7:30 pm\n\nPlanning Commission Meeting: 3rd Thursday of the month at 7:30 pm Read More\n\nWestfall Township\n\nHours of Operation:\n\nOffice Hours: Monday - Thursday 8:00 am - 4:30 pm\n\nSupervisor Meetings: 1st Monday of the month at 7:00 pm\n\nPlanning Commission Meeting: 4th Tuesday of the month at 7:00 pm Read More"
