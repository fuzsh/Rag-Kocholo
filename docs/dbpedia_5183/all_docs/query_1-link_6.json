        "text": "ITEMS FROM J. H. BROWN'S HISTORY\n\nSETTLERS OF DALLAS COUNTY 1841-1850. (Submitted by Dorman Holub)\n\nThe following is taken from John Henry Brown's history of Dallas county. As he is one of the very few pioneers still living who knew Dallas county when but a wilderness, and has seen her growth to her present wonderful status, and remembers the names of all the earlier settlers, whence they were and so forth, we give the following from his history:\n\n\"The actual settlement of Dallas county began in the spring of 1842, when the first cabin was erected and the families of John Beeman and Captain Gilbert were the first to arrive (Mrs. Martha Gilbert being the first American lady) and relieve the loneliness of the adventurous and true-hearted avant coureur, John Neely Bryan, who had for five or six months been 'monarch of all he surveyed,' provided, he neither surveyed red men of the forest nor the raging Trinity on one of its periodic 'spreads.' He entertained them with the best he had - chiefly bear meat and honey - perhaps without recalling the adage about 'entertaining angels unawares,' yet, it was verified in this case, for, ere a great while, the lonely son of Tennessee gave his heart and hand to a comely and pure-hearted daughter of Illinois, in the person of Margaret, a daughter of Mr. John Beeman.\n\nIn 1842, besides James J. Beeman and family, the families of Thomas Keenan, Preston Witt, Alexander W. Webb, John H. Cox, Perry Overton and others, arrived. The family of William M. Cochran came in March 1843. In May came the family of Dr. John Cole, with his grown sons, Calvin G.., John H. and James M., and other children; and in December, George W. Gloves and family, Elder Amon McCommas and grown sons, John, Elisha, Stephen B., and his brothers Stephen B. and John C., George L. Leonard and family and others.\n\nIn 1844 other members of the Cox family, the Cameron family, Isaac B. Webb and family, the Jenkins family, the Harwood family, the Rawlins family and many others came.\n\nIn 1845 came William H. Hord and family, William B. Elam and family, W. Hamp Witt and family, Thomas M. Ellis and family, John H. Daniel, D. W. Reedy, the Haught brothers, Adam C., Peter and Samuel A., with their families, John W. Smith and James M. Patterson (afterward the well-known first merchants of Dallas) both from Green County, Kentucky; John Thomas, wife, grown sons and daughters, from Missouri; James A. Coats, Marion A., and Thomas D. Coats, John C. McCoy, and others.\n\nAmong those arriving in 1846, were the families of Samuel Beeman, Mrs. Mary Ann Freeman, Obadiah W. Knight, William Traughber, I. N. Webb, John R. Fondren, Thomas Collins, James Collins (brothers), Albert G. Collins, Rev. James A. Smith, R. E. Rawlins and other members of the Rawlins family, Wormly Carter, Asher W. Carter, John Anderson, Marquis de Lafayette Gracy (single) and many others.\n\nFrom the history of this venerable historian, also, we take by permission the following list of names of all the settlers of Dallas county, reaching from the earliest settlement in 1841 to 1850, arranged alphabetically:\n\nSETTLERS OF DALLAS COUNTY 1841-1850.\n\nAllen, Simon Bolivar, merchant, in 1848, lives in Bonham.\n\nAtterberry, James and family.\n\nAtterberry, Stephen C. and family.\n\nAtterberry, Jesse and family.\n\nAtterberry, Nathan (soldier in Mexico), and Churchill came single.\n\nAnderson, John L. and family, came from Kentucky, 1846.\n\nAnderson, James and family, 1846.\n\nAnderson, Thomas R. and James W., both single\n\nArmstrong, James and family, came in 1846;\n\n· his daughter, Frances E., came, the wife of John Bursey, and is now a widow;\n\n· Martha married Robert Cook, and is a widow\n\n· Nancy J. married first William A.
