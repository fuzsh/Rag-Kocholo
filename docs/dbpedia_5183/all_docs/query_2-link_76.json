        "text": "Overview\n\nTexas law provides for certain exemptions, deferrals to help reduce the property tax obligations of qualifying property owners. These tax breaks are administered by the Harris Central Appraisal District (HCAD).\n\nYou must apply to HCAD for any exemptions for which you qualify. HCAD will subsequently notify the Harris County Tax Office of any resulting changes to your tax statement.\n\nPlease refer to the website www.hcad.org for all applicable forms and any additional information.\n\nHow to Apply for a Homestead Exemption\n\nTo apply for a Homestead Exemption, you must submit the following to the Harris Central Appraisal District (HCAD):\n\nA copy of your valid Texas Driver’s License showing the homestead address.\n\nThis requirement may be waived if you are:\n\na resident of a facility that provides services related to health, infirmity, or aging; or\n\ncertified for participation in the address confidentiality program administered by the AG.\n\nThe license must bear the same address as the property for which the homestead exemption is requested (homestead address) unless you are:\n\nactive duty military or their spouse, showing proof of military ID and a utility bill.\n\na federal or state judge, their spouse or a peace officer whose address information has been omitted from your driver’s license. You must provide a copy of your application for the driver’s license.\n\nIf you do not have a driver’s license, you may submit a copy of a state issued personal ID showing the homestead address.\n\nA completed Homestead Exemption Application showing the homestead address.\n\nProof of disability, for those who are applying for an exemption due to disability.\n\nSpecific question about exemptions, values or name and address changes should be directed to HCAD at: 713-957-7800 or online at www.hcad.org.\n\nMilitary Tax Deferral\n\nIn 2003, the Texas Legislature passed a bill that provides qualified active duty military personnel serving during a war or national emergency outside the State of Texas, a deferral of the taxes and a waiver of penalties and interest. The deferral applies only to property owned or co-owned by the servicemember on the date transferred out of Texas or acquired later by inheritance or gift.\n\nActive military personnel not qualifying for the State’s deferral and waiver of penalties and interest may qualify for property tax relief under the Federal War and National Defense Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. Under the Act, servicemembers that qualify pay only 6% interest on delinquent taxes. No penalty applies.\n\nTo request relief under the Federal law, please send a letter identifying the property owned with your active military orders along with the completed waiver of penalty and interest form indicating the period of current service.\n\nMail to:\n\nAnn Harris Bennett, Tax Assessor-Collector\n\nAttn: Customer Service Dept.\n\n1001 Preston\n\nHouston, Texas 77002\n\nor\n\nYou may fax your orders to 713-274-2219.\n\nOver 65/Disabled Deferral\n\nIf you are a homeowner age 65 or over or disabled, you can stop a judgment or tax sale, or defer (postpone) paying delinquent property taxes on your homestead for as long as you own it and live in it. To postpone your tax payments, file a tax deferral affidavit with your appraisal district. The deferral applies to delinquent property taxes for all of the taxing units that tax your home.\n\nYou should be aware that a tax deferral only postpones payments, it does not cancel them. Interest will be added at the rate of 5% annually. Once you no longer own your home or live in it, all the taxes, pre-deferral penalties and interest, together with the 5% deferral interest become due after 180 days. If the taxes remain unpaid, regular penalties and interest accrue and the taxing units may proceed with a lawsuit to collect delinquent taxes through a tax sale.\n\nClick here for the Tax Deferral FAQ\n\nQuarter Payment Plan\n\nIf you have an over 65 or disabled exemption or are the surviving spouse of a disabled veteran, you may request to pay your property taxes in 4 equal payments without penalty and interest.\n\nTo apply, you must provide:\n\nPayment in the amount of at least one-fourth (25%) of the total amount of current taxes due.\n\nA written request to pay in installments. This can be in the form of a letter, email, or signature on a check or on your tax statement.\n\nIn order to avoid penalty and interest, the request and initial payment must be submitted by January 31st.\n\nRequests will be accepted after January 31st and before March 1st.
