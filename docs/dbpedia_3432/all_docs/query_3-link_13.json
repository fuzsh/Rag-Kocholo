Considerable research has examined this question in the Middle East, but in many of these key cases autocratic regimes supported political institutions that reinforced tribal ties, making it hard to discern the independent effect of tribal identity on voter behavior. We revisit this question in (at the time) democratic Tunisia, where post-independence governments tried to uproot tribal identity, making it a “least likely” case to uncover tribal influence on election outcomes. To estimate the effect of tribal influence on voting, we match an historical dictionary of Tunisian tribes to surnames from the universe of both registered voters and candidates from Tunisia’s recent local elections (2018). We find preliminary evidence consistent with the claim that tribal affiliations do “matter:” lists whose candidates share a tribal identity with the underlying population consistently outperform lists who do not share this identity. Our work suggests that despite decades of policies designed to suppress tribes, tribal identity exerted a measurable effect on local politics during a period of democratic transition\n\nWednesday 5 June 2024 16:30-18:00\n\nThe session was canceled.\n\nR2.01\n\nANNAN Francis (University of California, Berkeley) : Equilibrium Effects of Entry in Digital Financial Markets\n\nAbstract\n\nWe study the direct and indirect effects of randomized entry into local service industries.

Could the small microcredit treatment effects often found for the average household mask important heterogeneity? In Hyderabad, India, we find that “gung ho entrepreneurs” (GEs), households who were already running a business before microfinance entered, show persistent benefits that increase over time. Six years later, the treated GEs own businesses that have 35% more assets and generate double the revenues as those in control neighborhoods. We find almost no effects on non-GE households. A model of technology choice in which talented entrepreneurs can access either a diminishing-returns technology, or a more productive technology with a fixed cost, generates dynamics matching the data. These results show that heterogeneity in entrepreneurial ability is important and persistent. For talented but low-wealth entrepreneurs, short-term access to credit can indeed facilitate escape from a poverty trap.\n\nWednesday 15 May 2024 16:30-18:00\n\nR2.01\n\nMOBARAK Musfiq (Yale University) : Remittance Frictions and Seasonal Poverty\n\n,Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak, Corey Vernot , Arjun Kharel\n\nAbstract\n\nSeasonal migration is a common strategy to mitigate rural seasonal deprivation, but migrants need to remit money back during the lean season to family members facing food shortages. We observe counterintuitively low remittances in rural Nepal during periods of seasonal hunger, and migrants return with remittances later during harvest when food is relatively abundant. To indirectly overcome this apparent constraint in remittance timing, we provide a $90 consumption loan to randomly selected rural households during the pre-harvest lean season. Loan-recipient households increase pre-harvest investments in fertilizer and time spent working on their own farm, smooth consumption, and save more of their migration income to bring it back home. Food security, subjective well-being, rice harvest and revenues improve. 98% of beneficiaries repay the loan with the increased harvest-period remittance. In a two-period model of household decision-making, we show that remittance frictions – a market failure – are necessary to qualitatively match our experimental results.\n\nWednesday 24 April 2024 16:30-18:00\n\nThe session was canceled.\n\nR2.01\n\nANNAN Francis (University of California, Berkeley ) : Equilibrium Effects of Entry in Digital Financial Markets\n\nAbstract\n\nWe study the direct and indirect effects of randomized entry into local service industries.

The goal of this paper is to better understand how psychosocial factors operate and shape the impact of graduation programs. After deriving a set of hypotheses about the impacts of psychosocial constraints from a dynamic optimization model of the choice between a low income, casual wage-labor occupation and a higher earning entrepreneurial activity, this paper exploits a randomized controlled trial of a graduation program implemented in the pastoralist regions of Northern Kenya. Key empirical findings include that the estimated highly favorable average treatment effects disguise substantial heterogeneity, with beneficiaries who began with severe depressive symptoms gaining little from the program. The RCT's saturation design also allows us to identify substantial spillover effects onto the asset accumulation of women who were not enrolled in the graduation program. Spillovers are also estimated to positively affect non-beneficiary women's preference for upward economic mobility, providing a plausible explanation for their accumulation of capital despite no direct support from the graduation program. The paper draws out the implications of these findings for the cost-effective design and implementation of graduation programs.\n\nWednesday 27 March 2024 16:30-18:00\n\nR2.01\n\nLANG Meghan (World Bank) : Economic Inclusion through Entrepreneurship: Evidence on Building Skills for Women\n\nMegan Lang (Development Research Group, The World Bank) and Julia Seither (Universidad del Rosario)\n\nAbstract\n\nRural, low-income households often face high income volatility, and women are disproportionately affected by negative shocks to production. Can entrepreneurship improve the economic status of rural, low-income women? We randomize access to an entrepreneurship training program in rural Uganda. The program significantly improves women's earnings. Treated women are 19% more likely to run profitable businesses 18 months post-program and profits are 15% higher. The program also bolsters women's ability to cope with large, negative shocks: high-frequency data shows that treated women fare significantly better during the first COVID-19 lockdown than women in the control group. Exploiting social network data, we detect significant, positive spillovers to the control group and adjust estimates accordingly. Our findings highlight a new role for entrepreneurship training programs as a tool for equitable rural development.\n\nWednesday 20 March 2024 16:30-18:00\n\nR2.01\n\nGALASSO Emanuella (World Bank ) : *\n\nWednesday 20 March 2024 16:30-18:00\n\nR2.01\n\nGALASSO Emanuela (World Bank ) : The Heterogeneous Quality in Delivery of Welfare: Evidence from Social Workers in the Chile Solidario Program\n\nPedro Carneiro (University College London, CEMMAP and IFS), Barbara Flores (University of Chile), Emanuela Galasso (Development Research Group, The World Bank), Rita Ginja (University of Bergen), Lucy Kraftman (Institute of Fiscal Studies)\n\nAbstract\n\nWelfare states rely on human resources to provide the social services available. Social workers are often responsible for linking services provided and the families in need. In this paper we quantify the differences in effectiveness across social workers and study the implications of these estimates for their optimal allocation across families. To do so, we use data from a two-year home visitation program for the most deprived in Chile, where social workers were (quasi)-randomly assigned across families. We start by estimating the social workers’ fixed effects, that reveal substantial heterogeneity in the value-added by social workers. Second, we find that there is heterogeneity in performance within social workers, across different families. Third, we find a weak correlation between the supervisors and own social worker evaluation and her estimated value added. Finally, a high value-added social worker has a small but significant impact which lasts up to four years after the home-visitation program.\n\nWednesday 13 March 2024 16:30-18:00\n\nR2.01\n\nVOORS Maarten : Effects of economic and social incentives on bureaucratic quality: Experimental Evidence from Sierra Leone\n\nAbstract\n\nUsing a field experiment implemented in Sierra Leone we examine the joint effects of local selection, local monitoring, and incentivized payment mechanisms. We find evidence consistent with past literature that social pressure improves quality. These gains however are no better than gains from simple direct payment mechanisms that involve similar direct but lower social costs. There is weak evidence of crowding out effects. We find no effects of varying selection mechanisms. Analysis of a structural model identifies conditions under which social or economic incentives are more or less likely to be effective.\n\nWednesday 6 March 2024 16:30-18:00\n\nR2.01\n\nDE WALQUE Damien (World Bank) : Early Education, Preferences, and Decision-Making Abilities\n\nJoana Cardim (Education Policy Institute) Pedro Carneiro (University College of London, IFS, CEMMAP, FAIR-NHH) Leandro S. Carvalho (University of Southern California) Damien de Walque (Development Research Group, The World Bank)[\n\nAbstract\n\nOne way to advance our understanding of individual differences in decision-making is to study the development of children’s decision-making. This paper studies the causal effects of daycare attendance on children’s economic preferences and decision-making abilities, exploiting a lottery system that randomized admissions into oversubscribed daycare centers in Rio de Janeiro. Overall, daycare attendance had no effect on either economic preferences or decision-making abilities. It did increase, however, aversion to disadvantageous inequality (i.e., having less than one’s peer). This increase is driven mostly by girls, a result that reproduces in a different study that randomized admissions into preschool education.\n\nWednesday 28 February 2024 16:30-18:00\n\nR2.01\n\nGOMES Joseph Flavian (Economics School of Louvain and the Institute of Economic and Social Research (IRES)) : It’s a Bird, it’s a Plane, it’s Superman! Using Mass Media to Fight Intolerance\n\nAlex Armand, Paul Atwell, Joseph F. Gomes, Giuseppe Musillo, Yannik Schenk\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper examines the impact of progressive radio programming on societal change during the early period of desegregation in post-World War II U.S. We investigate the influence of the popular radio show “The Adventures of Superman” on promoting tolerance and exposing the bigotry of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in 1946. Using state-of-the-art radio propagation models, we map the broadcast’s exposure and analyze its effects on various socioeconomic outcomes. We find that counties with higher exposure to the broadcast experienced a significant decrease in support for segregationist political candidates. Individuals potentially exposed to the Superman program during their childhood exhibited more progressive attitudes towards racial desegregation and African Americans later in life. These individuals were also more likely to be in interracial marriages and less likely to participate in the Vietnam war. Additionally, we uncover significant and progressive long-term effects of the radio coverage on county-level outcomes such as the presence of active KKK branches, civil rights organizations, and accessibility of non-discriminatory services for African Americans listed in the “Green Books.” These results underscore the potential of progressive radio programming as a catalyst for social change and contribute to our understanding of how media shapes societal attitudes and beliefs.\n\nWednesday 14 February 2024 16:30-18:00\n\nR2.01\n\nBANERJEE Abhijit (MIT) : Universal Basic Income: Short-Term Results from a Long-Term Experiment in Kenya\n\nAbhijit Banerjee,Michael Faye,Alan Krueger,Paul Niehaus,Tavneet Suri\n\nAbstract\n\nWhat would be the consequences of a long-term commitment to provide everyone enough money to meet their basic needs? We examine this hotly debated issue in the context of a unique eld experiment in rural Kenya. Communities receiving UBI experienced substantial economic expansion|more enterprises, higher revenues, costs, and net revenues|and structural shifts, with the expansion concentrated in the non-agricultural sector. Labor supply did not change overall, but shifted out of wage employment and towards self-employment. We also compare the eects to those of shorter-term transfers delivered either as a stream of small payments or a large lump sum. The lump sums had similar, if not larger, economic impacts, while the short-term transfers had noticeably smaller eects, despite having delivered the same amount of capital to date. These results are consistent with a simple model of forward-looking lumpy investment, and more generally with a role for savings constraints, credit constraints, and some degree of (locally) increasing returns, among other factors.\n\nWednesday 20 December 2023 16:30-18:00\n\nR2.01\n\nMACCHI Elisa : Work Over Just Cash: Informal Redistribution Among Employers and Workers in Kampala, Uganda\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper examines informal redistribution in the form of work in small and medium enterprises in Kampala, Uganda and its drivers. Using a field experiment, we show that employers and workers systematically choose giving/receiving work over cash transfers. Decisions imply a large willingness to pay for work on both sides of the labor market. Work redistribution choices are unaffected by the economic and training value of the task, and employers pay for zero marginal product work. Removing stakes in the game also does not affect decisions, ruling out signaling and relational personal benefits as drivers. Employers and workers motivate work redistribution mostly with fairness considerations and, secondly, with the psychosocial value of work for workers. Results appear externally valid, as giving via work predicts increased hiring in the firm, but it does not lead to higher revenues, sales, or profits, confirming that work redistribution is unlikely to be productive.\n\nWednesday 13 December 2023 16:30-18:00\n\nR2.21\n\nDILLON Andrew (Northwestern University ) : Making Markets: Experiments in Agricultural Input Market Formation\n\nAndrew Dillon Northwestern University , Nicol´o Tomaselli University of Florence\n\nAbstract\n\nMaking markets is central to theories of development. In our rural Malian study setting, seventy percent of smallholder farmers did not have village-level access to an ag-input dealer in the twelve previous months. We create rural input markets with a village input fair (VIF). Our experiment estimates the effect of forward or commitment contracts depending on the market timing when inputs can be purchased or ordered (at planting or post-harvest season), the up-front deposit a farmer pays an ag-input dealer to order inputs for delivery during the planting season (the level of commitment), and whether credit is offered during the village input fairs (to test the implications of liquidity). We estimate the intention-totreat effects of differences in these market structures on prices, market volume, consumer demand, and agricultural production and revenue. The results suggest that ordering inputs in advance substantially raise market sales when deposit amounts are low (10 percent versus 50 percent deposit). The credit offers increase sales by USD 63 in the 10 percent deposit group which increases fertilizer purchased by 140 kg at market prices. Village input fairs led to increases in input utilization at the extensive and intensive margin. We conclude that innovations in market organization resulted in farmer intensification rather than diversification of production with strong effects on farmer revenue. We do not observe price discrimination in VIFs relative to control group or spot market prices.\n\nWednesday 6 December 2023 16:30-18:00\n\nR2.01\n\nHEATH Rachel (University of Washington) : Monitoring Harassment in Organizations\n\nLaura Boudreau (Columbia University), Sylvain Chassang (Princeton University), Ada González-Torres (Ben Gurion University)\n\nAbstract\n\nWe evaluate secure survey methods designed for the ongoing monitoring of harass- ment in organizations. To do so, we partner with a large Bangladeshi garment manu- facturer and experiment with different designs of phone-based worker surveys. “Hard” garbling (HG) responses to sensitive questions, i.e., automatically recording a random subset as complaints, increases reporting of physical harassment by 290%, sexual harass- ment by 271%, and threatening behavior by 45%, from reporting rates of 1.5%, 1.8%, and 9.9%, respectively, under the status quo of direct elicitation. Rapport-building and removing team identifiers from responses do not significantly increase reporting. We show that garbled reports can be used to consistently estimate policy-relevant statistics of harassment, including: How prevalent is it? What share of managers is responsible for the misbehavior? and, How isolated are its victims? In our data, harassment is widespread, the problem is not restricted to a minority of managers, and victims are often isolated within teams.\n\nWednesday 29 November 2023 16:30-18:00\n\nR2.01\n\nSCHANER Simone (University of Southern California) : Accountability at a Cost? The Impact of Citizen-Led Auditing on Social Protection Provision\n\nCharity Troyer Moore and Rohini Pande\n\nAbstract\n\nWe employ an at-scale randomized experiment to evaluate how one of the world's largest citizen-led monitoring efforts, India's ``social audits'' initiative, impacted corruption and access to social protection in one of India's poorest states. A unique feature is the program's reliance on female auditors drawn from village self-help groups. Combining administrative data on program expenditures with survey data, we document how the nature of corruption varies across the two distinct schemes linked to India's workfare program. Submitting names of villagers who did not work was the main form of leakage in the public works scheme, whereas kickbacks dominated in the national housing scheme, which provides a conditional cash transfer for home construction. Audits reduced corruption in both programs, with differing implications for participants by program. Reduced corruption in public works was accompanied by lower levels of implementation and therefore less access -- survey data show the share of citizens participating reduced by more than 50% in audited communities. Conditional on participating, amounts received by citizens did not change. In contrast, audits reduced kickbacks paid to local leaders under the national housing program by 28% and as a result income retained by participants increased by 7%.\n\nWednesday 22 November 2023 16:30-18:00\n\nR2.01\n\nWILLIS Jack (Columbia University ) : Land Rental Markets: Experimental Evidence from Kenya\", with Michelle Acampora and Lorenzo Casaburi\n\nAbstract\n\nAgriculture is the main income source for over half of households in Sub-Saharan Africa, yet markets for its key input, land, function poorly. While incomplete land markets are considered an obstacle to agricultural productivity growth and to economic development, experimental evidence on land market participation is virtually non-existent. We randomly allocate subsidies for agricultural rentals in Kenya, and study who selects into land markets, what renters do differently from owners, and the resulting effects on agricultural outcomes. The induced rentals reallocate plots to farmers who own fewer plots and are younger and more market-oriented, and they persist beyond the subsidy. Renters increase output and value added on the rented plot, by more than owners under an equivalent unconditional cash transfer, and they do so by increasing commercial crop cultivation and non-labor inputs, rather than labor. Although owners cultivate less land under the rental subsidy, their non-agricultural labor decreases. The results shed light on the sources and magnitudes of both land market frictions and gains from trade.\n\nWednesday 18 October 2023 16:30-18:00\n\nR2.01\n\nARCHIBONG Belinda (Barnard College, Columbia University) : Information Frictions and Gender Inequality in Online Labor Markets\n\nAbstract\n\nWe study the effects of information frictions on gender gaps in matching and hiring in online labor markets. Administrative data from a large online job platform in Nigeria suggest significant gender differences in job applications, hiring and potential mismatch by gender. Women are less likely to apply to senior level jobs, despite being equally qualified for positions. Women are also less likely to be hired. We implement randomized experiments that provide information on these patterns, along with diversity encouragement information, separately, to applicants and hiring managers. The results so far demonstrate the importance of providing information to both sides of the online labor market and suggest that information can reduce gender gaps in employment by correcting misinformation among misinformed applicants and hiring managers\n\nWednesday 4 October 2023 16:00-18:30\n\nR2.01\n\nMACCHIAVELLO Rocco (LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS ) : Mafia & Firms\n\nAbstract\n\nOrganized crime groups (OCGs) invest substantial sums in legal economic activities worldwide. Evidence on these investments is limited due to data scarcity. We introduce a model differentiating contaminated (OCG benefits from connecting legal firm to illegal activities increasing the risk of detection) from pure investment (legal firm and OCG's illegal activities remain separate). The model clarifies how to distinguish these motives in the data and delivers predictions which we test using new and highly confidential records from the Bank of Italy's Financial Intelligence Unit. Among infiltrated firms, we distinguish born-clean (that are later infiltrated) from born-infiltrated firms. In born-clean firms, infiltration is associated with a change in the sources of finance and increased liquidity, but no changes in operational outcomes, consistent with a pure investment motive. Born-infiltrated firms, instead, present traits consistent with the contaminated motive. As born-clean firms attract more OCG capital, our results suggest OCGs mainly use legal firms to invest in assets and possibly acquire valuable connections. These results challenge existing literature and policy narratives.\n\nWednesday 20 September 2023 16:30-18:00\n\nR2.01\n\nSHAMDASANI Yogita (National University of Singapore) : Habit Formation in Labor Supply (joint with Luisa Cefala, Supreet Kaur and Heather Schofield)\n\nAbstract\n\nWe posit that labor supply is not a function of stable preferences for leisure, but rather is also determined by one's past habituation to work. In existing data, we show that exogenously induced transitory changes in labor supply increase supply in subsequent days - indicating that the inter-temporal labor supply elasticity can actually be positive, rather than negative. To further examine this phenomenon, we undertake a field experiment with casual urban stand workers in Chennai, India, where appearance at the stand in the morning provides a revealed preference measure of labor supply. We randomly provide some workers incentives for attendance over 2 months (phase 1), and examine persistence after incentives are removed for another 2 months (phase 2). We find that a 23% increase in labor supply in phase 1 generates a persistent 16% increase in supply in phase 2 - leading to a 22% increase in employment found at the stand. These findings have relevance for understanding the reasons for irregular work attendance and high worker turnover in formal firms, which impede the transition to formal work in this setting. They also suggest that the effects of unemployment spells may go beyond income loss: unemployment itself can lower a worker's productivity - offering a potential justification for the unemployment scar'' phenomenon documented in the labor literature, where employers prefer not to hire workers out of unemployment. Overall, they suggest that work ethic is an endogenous feature of human capital stock.\n\nWednesday 7 June 2023 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nBASSI Vittorio (University of Southern California) : Self-employment within the firm”, joint with Jung Hyuk Lee, Alessandra Peter, Tommaso Porzio, Ritwika Sen and Esau Tugume\n\nAbstract\n\nWe study the internal organization of firms in developing countries and how it affects their productivity and optimal size. We collect detailed time use data for 1,000 manufacturing firms in urban Uganda and document limited within-firm labor specialization. Even in relatively large firms, entrepreneurs and their employees work on similar tasks. As such, firms resemble a collection of self-employed individuals who share a production location. To interpret the empirical evidence, we develop an equilibrium model of task assignment, firm size, and occupational choice. We find that barriers to labor specialization generate decreasing returns to scale at the firm level, which reduces the returns to entrepreneurial ability and keeps firms small in equilibrium. Given the internal organization of firms we document, benefits from alleviating any other frictions that constrain firm growth are muted\n\nWednesday 24 May 2023 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nBERGQUIST Lauren (Yale University) : Search Costs, Intermediation, and Trade: Experimental Evidence from Ugandan Agricultural Markets (joint with Craig McIntosh and Meredith Startz)\n\nAbstract\n\nSearch costs may be a barrier to market integration in developing countries, harming both producers and consumers. We present evidence from the large-scale experimental rollout of a mobile phone-based marketplace intended to reduce search costs for agricultural commodities in Uganda. We find that market integration improves substantially: trade increases and excess price dispersion falls. This reflects price convergence across relative surplus and deficit markets, with no change on average. Using our experimental results to calibrate a trade model we can correct our reduced form estimates for the spillovers on the control, as well as simulating the impact that the intervention would have had if it were universally implemented. Our results suggest that the intervention reduced fixed trade costs by 10% and increased overall welfare in the study area by 1%. Contrary to the stated goals of the marketplace, but consistent with the existence of economies of scale in search or other trade costs, almost all activity on the platform is among larger traders, with very little use by smallholder farmers. Nevertheless, the benefits of improved arbitrage by traders appears to pass through to farmers in the form of higher revenues in surplus markets, as trader entry increases and measured trader profits decrease in response to falling search costs.\n\nWednesday 17 May 2023 16:30-18:00\n\nR2.01\n\nBALBONI Clare (MIT) : * Firm Adaptation in Production Networks: Evidence from Extreme Weather Events in Pakistan\n\nJohannes Boehm & Mazhar Waseem\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper considers how far private adaptation may reduce future vulnerability to climate change. Firms’ climate risk exposure depends not only on the location of production, but also on network effects via the flood risk profile of suppliers and transportation links connecting trading partners. We use data on monthly firm-to-firm transactions for the near-universe of formal sector manufacturing firms in Pakistan and more than six billion observations from commercial trucks traveling on the road network from 2011 to 2018 to study adaptation of firms in production networks. We find that firms affected by major floods relocate to less flood-prone areas, diversify their supplier base, and shift the composition of their suppliers towards those located in less flood-prone regions and reached via less flood-prone roads. Identification strategies that exploit both firm- and route-level flooding suggest that these responses reflect forward-looking actions to reduce future vulnerability to flood risk rather than direct effects of flooding, and are consistent with experience-based updating. We develop a quantitative spatial model of endogenous production network formation among firms that learn about flood risk from realized flood events. We estimate the model to quantify the importance of the adaptive responses identified for the aggregate vulnerability of the economy to future flood risk. The results suggest that the impacts of climate change will be mediated as firms learn from the experience of increasingly frequent climate disasters\n\nWednesday 10 May 2023 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nBANCALARI Antonella (Institute for Fiscal Studies / University College London) : \"Public Service Delivery and Free Riding: Experimental Evidence from India\"\n\nAlex Armand, Britta Augsburg and Maitreesh Ghatak\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper provides novel evidence on the mechanisms driving the combination of poor-quality public services and high prevalence of non-payment (free riding) in low- and middle-income countries. We implement a field experiment in the slums of two major Indian cities and in the context of a fee-funded public service provided by community toilets. Collecting original surveys, behavioral and objective measurements, we show that an exogenous boost in the maintenance quality of the service improves delivery and reduces free riding in a static and dynamic way, but excludes a share of residents from using the service. Providers react strategically to external rewards by shifting their efforts towards monitoring activities. Excluded users are forced to dispose human waste in common-property, generating large health externalities. Residents demand more public intervention in the service provision.\n\nWednesday 19 April 2023 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nSUDARSHAN ANAT (University of Warwick) : Can Pollution Markets Work In Developing Countries? Experimental Evidence from India\n\nAbstract\n\nMarket-based environmental regulations are seldom used in developing countries, where pollution is the highest but state capacity is often low. We experimentally evaluate a new particulate matter emissions market, the first in the world, covering industrial plants in a large Indian city. There are three main findings. First, the market functioned well: permit trade was active and plants obtained permits to meet their compliance obligations almost perfectly. Second, treatment plants, randomly assigned to the emissions market, reduced pollution emissions by 20% to 30%, relative to control plants. Third, the market, holding emissions constant, reduces abatement costs by 11% to 14%. These cost estimates are based on a model that estimates heterogeneous plant marginal abatement costs from plant bids for emissions permits. More broadly, we find that emissions can be reduced at small increases in abatement costs. The pollution market therefore has health benefits that exceed costs by at least twenty-five times\n\nWednesday 5 April 2023 16:30-18:00\n\nco-organized with the PEPES seminar.

However, little is understood about the characteristics of policy experimentation, and how the structure of experimentation may affect policy learning and policy outcomes. We aim to describe and understand China's policy experimentation since 1980, among the largest and most systematic in recent history. We collect comprehensive data on policy experimentation conducted in China over the past four decades. We find that, while experimentation outcomes strongly predict whether policies roll out nationally, the experimentation exhibits two characteristics that complicate policy learning. First, about 90% of the experiments exhibit positive sample selection in terms of a locality’s economic development. Second, promotion-driven local politicians allocate more resources to ensure the experiments' success, and such effort is not replicable when policies roll out to the entire country. The presence of sample selection and strategic effort is not fully accounted for by the central government, affecting policy learning and distorting national policies originating from the experimentation. Taken together, these results suggest that, while China’s bureaucratic and institutional conditions make policy experimentation possible at an unparalleled scale, the complex political environments can also limit the scope and bias the direction of policy learning\n\nWednesday 22 March 2023 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nJAGNANI Maulik (University of Colorado Denver) : Financial Concerns and Sleeplessness\n\nClaire Duquennois and Maulik Jagnani*\n\nAbstract\n\nDo people worried about their personal finances experience lower quality sleep? Using a regression discontinuity research design, we find that eligible household heads surveyed just after the disbursement of an unconditional cash transfer in Indonesia report a 0.3 standard deviation improvement in sleep quality as compared to those surveyed just before the cash disbursement. The cash transfer appears to have alleviated financial concerns amongst household heads, who are responsible for satisfying the daily necessities of the household. Immediately after disbursement, eligible households report an increase in savings, and eligible household heads report feeling less worried, frustrated, and tired. Consistent with evidence from sleep medicine, eligible household heads displayed improved performance on memory and attention tests but not on reasoning or problem-solving tests. These patterns of results are not observed for household heads ineligible for the cash transfer, which suggests that our results are not driven by seasonal confounders or aggregate shocks. These results are also not observed for other members of eligible households, who are not responsible for satisfying the households’ financial needs. We also argue that nutrition, time in bed, and labor supply cannot explain our results.\n\nWednesday 15 March 2023 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nBOBONIS Gustavo (University of Toronto) : Norms of Corruption in Politicians’ Malfeasance\n\nAnke Kessler and Xin Zhao\n\nAbstract\n\nWe develop a political agency model in which office holders are motivated by re-election as well as reputation motives, and are incentivized to curb corrupt behavior through elections, formal audits, as well as norms regarding the appropriateness of corruption that prevail in their peer group. The model formalizes the notion that anti-social behavior is governed by both formal and informal rules of conduct. We show that, while the formal institutions of audits and elections have the desired direct effect of reducing corruption, the presence of norms and their interaction with the direct incentives can have unintended effects. We examine the model's predictions in the context of Puerto Rico's anti-corruption municipal audits program over the period 1987-2014. Specifically, using a quasi-experimental design based on the exogenous timing of audits relative to elections, we show that the model helps explain peculiar patters in the data: mayors respond positively to audits in their own community, but negatively to audits - and the corresponding reduction in corruption - in neighboring municipalities. Our estimates suggest a large negative spillover effect: communities where two-thirds of adjacent jurisdictions undergo a (timely) audit experience a 30 percent increase in reported corruption levels.\n\nWednesday 1 March 2023 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nGORAYA Sampreet (Stockholm School of Economics.) : Product Demand, Misallocation and Firm Growth\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper examines the impact of ethnic networks on product demand and firm growth in rural India. We use changes in regional rainfall intensity as a proxy for local demand shocks and find that demand is segmented along caste lines. We find that consumers in historically disadvantaged communities experience a positive income shock due to good rainfall and that this translates into higher per-capita consumption for them. Further, this demand shock translates into higher revenue for the firms owned by members of the same caste category, relative to others. In terms of input misallocation, LC firms exhibit 16% higher MRPV (marginal revenue product of intermediate input) than HC firms. The demand shock reduces this cross-caste dispersion in MRPV by 5%. We rationalize these observations using a framework of cash-flow based borrowing constraints for firms. The paper suggests, in the short run, that input misallocation and borrowing constraints for firms are caused by limited product demand, rather than the other way around.\n\nWednesday 7 December 2022 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nVICENTE Pedro (University Nova de Lisboa) : Motivating Volunteer Health Workers in an African Capital City\n\nMattia Fracchia, Teresa Molina-Milla´n,\n\nAbstract\n\nCommunity Health Workers (CHWs) are central to health systems. Still, they are typically unpaid volunteers in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper follows all the CHWs in the capital city of Guinea-Bissau and tests the impact of different types of non-financial incentives on health indicators. We analyze two randomized interventions for CHWs: (i) an honorific award aimed at raising their social status; (ii) a video treatment aimed at increasing their perceived task significance. While employing administrative and survey data, we find that the social status intervention, differently from the task significance one, causes clear improvements in household health, particularly for young children.\n\nWednesday 30 November 2022 16:00-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan\n\nSOMVILLE Vincent (NHH Norwegian School of Economics) : On the Doorstep of Adulthood: Empowering Economic and Fertility Choices of Young Women\n\nAbstract\n\nLars Ivar Oppedal Berge, Kjetil Bjorvatn, Fortunata Makene, Linda Helgesson Sekei, Vincent Somville, Bertil Tungodden We report from a large-scale randomized controlled trial of women empowerment in Tanzania investigating how two different empowerment strategies, economic empowerment and reproductive health empowerment, shape the economic and fertility choices of young women when they transition into adulthood. The analysis builds on a rich data set (survey, experimental, and medical data) collected over more than five years. The economic empowerment reduces poverty, while teenage pregnancy increases with both economic and reproductive health empowerment. The increase in fertility comes from a positive income effect and by women entering earlier into a relationship. We also provide evidence of the importance of social norms and labor market flexibility in explaining the income and relationship effects on fertility. The findings provide new insights on the economics of fertility, and show the importance of a comprehensive approach to women empowerment.\n\nFull text [pdf]\n\nWednesday 23 November 2022 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01,Campus Jourdan\n\nBANERJEE Abhijit (MIT) : The (many) million dollar question: Experimental Evidence from Kenya on Universal Basic Income\n\nWednesday 9 November 2022 16:30-18:00\n\nSeminar cancelled and postponed\n\nBALBONI Clare (MIT) : Firm adaptation in production networks: Evidence from extreme weather events in Pakistan\n\nJohannes Boehm, Mazhar Waseem\n\nAbstract\n\nHow will private adaptation reduce future vulnerability to climate change? We study this question in the context of Pakistani manufacturing firms, which are exposed to increasingly frequent and severe floods as the global climate changes. Using detailed georeferenced data on monthly firm-to-firm transactions for the near-universe of formal sector manufacturing firms over 2011-2018 as well as flood exposure and underlying flood risk, we document that these shocks have both direct impacts on firms and effects through their position in the production network. We also harness more than six billion observations from commercial trucks traveling on Pakistan’s road network to document the importance of supply chain disruptions from flooding disrupting roads. We find that firm behavior in the aftermath of major floods is consistent with firms undertaking adaptation in order to reduce their vulnerability to future natural disasters. Flood-affected firms relocate to less flood-prone areas, diversify their supplier base, and shift the composition of their suppliers towards suppliers located in less flood-prone regions and reached via less flood-prone roads. Responses are persistent even where the flood disruptions are short-lived, and consistent with Bayesian firms affected by floods updating their priors over flood risk.\n\nWednesday 19 October 2022 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.21 Campus Jourdan\n\nCALLEN Michael (LSE) : Modernizing the State During War: Experimental Evidence from Afghanistan\n\nJoshua E. Blumenstock (U.C Berkeley), Anastasiia Faikina (U.C San Diego), Stefano Fiorin (Bocconi, LEAP, CEPR), Tarek Ghani (Washington University)\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper provides evidence on how to effectively build basic state capacity during active internal conflict. We report results from a randomized evaluation of a major reform intended to improve the Afghan government’s ability to pay its employees, which involved over 30,000 employees of the Ministry of Education between 2018 and 2020. The first element of the program, designed to eliminate ‘ghost’ workers, required employees to register for a mobile money wallet with biometric identification. This helped eliminate ghosts from the payroll (1.3% of employees), and allows estimation of the true share of ghosts (8.4% - 20.4%). The second element transitioned employees from receiving their salary in cash to receiving it via direct mobile money transfers. This led to a 26 percentage point increase in support for the reform to be scaled nationally, reduced salary delays, and caused employees to dramatically increase activity on the mobile money network, demonstrating a potential pathway toward expanding Afghanistan’s formal financial system. Because the experiment spanned both secure cities and contested rural regions, we can examine whether state control complemented the reform. While the reform brought benefits everywhere, improvements materialized faster in cities. Our results highlight the importance of long-term horizons in state-building efforts and provide evidence that progress toward a modern bureaucracy is possible, even in the shadow of war and while the broader state is under threat.\n\nWednesday 12 October 2022 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R1.09 Campus Jourdan\n\nKONDYLIS Florence (World Bank) : Learning from self and learning from others: Experimental evidence from Bangladesh\n\nwith John Loeser, Mushfiq Mobarak, Maria Jones, and Daniel Stein\n\nAbstract\n\nCan decentralizing demonstration accelerate diffusion of new technologies? We randomize approaches to demonstration of a new flood-saline-resilient seed in Bangladesh, led either by a single farmer or with expanded participation holding fixed village-level demonstration scale. Decentralization increases the impacts of demonstration on adoption: more farmers learn by demonstrating, and additional demonstrators strengthen social learning. However, in the long run, the impacts of demonstration fall and additional impacts of decentralization strikingly vanish. We estimate a Bayesian model of learning the returns to a new technology; adoption is nonmonotonic in learning, and decentralizing demonstration increases expected gains from demonstration.\n\nWednesday 28 September 2022 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.21 Campus Jourdan\n\nMUNOZ-MORALES Juan (IESEG) : Signaling Specific Skills and the Labor Market of College Graduates\n\nAbstract\n\nWe study how signaling skills specific to the major affects labor market outcomes of college graduates. We rely on census-like data and a regression discontinuity design to study the impacts of a well-known award given to top performers on a mandatory nationwide exam, which constitutes a graduation requirement for college seniors in Colombia. Students who can rely on the signal when searching for a job have a wage premium of 7 to 12 percent compared to otherwise identical students. This positive return persists even five years after graduation. The signal mostly benefits workers who graduate from low-reputation colleges, and allows workers to find jobs in more productive firms and in sectors that better use their skills. We rule out that the positive wage returns are explained by human capital. The signal favors mostly less advantaged groups, implying that less information frictions about students' skills could potentially reduce earnings gaps. Our results imply that information policies like those that formally certify specific skills can improve the efficiency in talent allocation of the economy and level the playing field for workers who come from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nFull text [pdf]\n\nWednesday 21 September 2022 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.21, Campus Jourdan\n\nCORNO Lucia ((Cattolica University and CEPR)) : Norms Replacement.

In this setting, FGC is part of a ritual called “Bondo”, which marks a girl's transition into womanhood. We randomly assigned over 3,500 mothers from 150 villages to three experimental arms: (i) a control group; (ii) an information arm, where we held community-wide discussions on the differences in outcomes between cut and uncut girls (e.g., in terms of health); and (iii) a norm-replacement arm, aimed at substituting the traditional ritual with an alternative that does not involve cutting “Bondo without cutting''. We measure FGC status both through mother's reports and through direct observation by medical personnel during health checks. Both treatments resulted in a 35\\%-38\\% increase in the probability that girls were not cut and that their mothers reported the intention not to cut them two years after the intervention. Our results underline the importance of designing culturally-sensitive policies when trying to change harmful traditions.\n\nWednesday 1 June 2022 16:30-17:45\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nCASTILLA Carolina (Colgate University) : Tipples and Quarrels in the Household: The Effect of an Alcohol Mitigation Intervention on Intimate Partner Violence\n\nAbstract\n\nAlcohol abuse is a risk factor for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV), though less is known about the causal relationship between them. We estimate the causal effect on IPV of a randomized-control trial (RCT) designed to mitigate alcohol consumption in rural Kenya, where IPV rates are higher than the global average. Treated households attended a series of group counseling and couples' therapy sessions. Non-treated households in close proximity may benefit from treatment spillovers, and are part of a spillover control group, while pure control households were in separate villages. Treatment substantially lowered sexual IPV, with smaller or no effects on physical and emotional IPV. Incidence of sexual violence decreased by 0.33 standard deviations relative to the control mean, while the frequency of aggression decreased by 0.3 standard deviations. Interestingly, men were also 11 percentage points less likely to agree that wife-beating is justified when a wife refuses sex. Counselor notes from treatment sessions reveal that alcohol abuse and IPV were commonly mentioned together by couples, suggesting a program to lower alcohol abuse may reduce IPV as well.\n\nWednesday 25 May 2022 16:30-17:45\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nMONEKE Niclas (Oxford University) : The Heterogeneous Effects of Rural Electrification: Evidence from Zambia\n\nwith Torsten Figueiredo Walter)\n\nAbstract\n\nElectrification is crucial for economic development. However, where and how it may have transformative effects remains unclear. In light of recent microeconomic evidence on electrification’s disappointing effects, we study the potential sources of heterogeneity underlying these results in the context of Zambia, where a large, country-wide rural electrification program is being rolled out. We develop a novel measure of electrification with high temporal and spatial coverage derived from administrative records on the universe of Zambian primary schools and health centres. We can confirm, first, that hundreds of localities have gained access to the electric grid since 2006. Second, our best estimate of a local average treatment effect derived from accidentally electrified localities is indeed virtually zero across a wide range of outcomes. Third, exploiting two full rounds of the Zambian Population & Housing Census, we uncover two relevant sources of heterogeneity: variation in pre-existing locality size and productive capacity. Electrification’s effects are most pronounced in localities with between 2,000 and 5,000 inhabitants, and any beneficial effects of electrification are concentrated on localities that have at least one non-residential building in commercial use before electrification, even conditional on locality size. In line with classic theories of agglomeration, we conclude that indivisible investments, such as pre-existing productive building capacity, may determine if rural electrification will cause economic development.\n\nTuesday 17 May 2022 16:30-17:45\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nSTARTZ Meredith (Dartmouth College) : Cutting out the middleman: The structure of chains of intermediation\n\nwith Matthew Grant\n\nAbstract\n\nDistribution of goods often involves chains of multiple intermediaries engaged in sequential buying and reselling. Why do such chains arise, and how will changes in their structure due to changes in policy or trade costs affect consumers? We show that internal economies of scale in trade costs naturally generate chains with multiple intermediaries, and that this suggests developing country markets are more likely to be served via long chains. Contrary to common wisdom, cutting middlemen out can, but does not necessarily, benefit consumers. Instead, there is a fundamental tradeoff between costs and entry that means even pure reductions in trade costs can have perverse effects. The proposed mechanism is simple, but can account for empirical patterns in wholesale firm size, prices and markups that we document using original survey data on imported consumer goods in Nigeria. We estimate a structural version of the model for distribution of Chinese-made apparel in Nigeria, and describe endogenous restructuring of chains and the resulting impacts on consumer welfare in response to counterfactual changes in regulation and e-commerce technologies. We find that cutting out middlemen has heterogeneous impacts across locations, but often harms more remote consumers.\n\nFull text [pdf]\n\nWednesday 4 May 2022 16:30-17:45\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nDERKSEN Laura (University of Toronto) : Privacy at What Cost? Using Electronic Medical Records to Recover Lapsed Patients into HIV Care\n\nwith Anita McGahan and Leandro Pongeluppe\n\nAbstract\n\nWe show that Malawian healthcare staff save lives by tracking down HIV patients lapsed from care – even against their wishes – using data made accessible with the implementation of an electronic medical records (EMR) system. HIV patients in Malawi receive antiretroviral therapy (ART), a highly effective treatment that also prevents transmission, for free at clinics. Yet patients frequently lapse from care, resulting in increased community transmission and unnecessary deaths. The introduction of EMR allowed health providers to manage patient data, trace lapsed patients, and encourage lapsed patients to reinitiate treatment. We implement an event study analysis using data from 106 clinics that adopted EMR between 2007 and 2019 and find that the introduction of EMR leads to an immediate increase in the number of patients actively in care and to a decline in patient deaths. After five years of implementation, facilities with EMR have approximately 34 percent more patients in care and 28 percent fewer patient deaths than facilities without EMR. These effects are concentrated among patients under 50, and are larger among young children. Effects are also concentrated among patients who do not wish to be traced; these patients are in fact more likely to lapse from care and require tracing. Robust to additional specifications and supported by interview findings, the results demonstrate that an initial preference for privacy gives way to patient reinstatement in care when the health consequences are critical.\n\nWednesday 20 April 2022 16:30-17:45\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nPREM Mounu (Universidad del Rosario) : Landmines: The local effects of demining\n\nwith Miguel E. Purroy and Juan F. Vargas\n\nAbstract\n\nAnti-personnel landmines are one of the main causes of civilian victimization in conflict-affected areas and a significant obstacle for post-war reconstruction. Demining campaigns are therefore a promising policy instrument to promote long-term development. We argue that the economic and social effects of demining are not unambiguously positive. Demining may have unintended negative consequences if it takes place while conflicts are ongoing, or if they do not lead to full clearance. Using highly disaggregated data on demining operations in Colombia from 2004 to 2019, and exploiting the staggered fashion of demining activity, we find that post-conflict humanitarian demining increases economic activity and students’ performance in test scores, especially in areas with better market access. In contrast, economic activity does not react to post-conflict demining events carried out during military operations, and it decreases if demining takes place while the conflict is ongoing. Rather, demining events that result from military operations are more likely to exacerbate extractive activities and promote deforestation.\n\nFull text [pdf]\n\nWednesday 6 April 2022 16:30-17:45\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nSINGH Abhijeet (PSE) : The incidence of affirmative action: Evidence from quotas in private schools in India\n\nwith Mauricio Romero\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper studies the effects of India’s main school-integration policy — a 25% quota in private schools for disadvantaged students, whose fees are reimbursed by the state — on direct beneficiaries. Combining survey and administrative data from the state of Chhattisgarh, with lottery-based allocation of seats in oversubscribed schools, we show that receiving a quota seat makes students more likely to attend a private school (by 24 percentage points). However, within eligible caste groups, quota applicants are drawn disproportionately from more-educated and economically better-off households and over three-quarters of the applicants who were not allotted a quota seat also attended a private school as fee-paying students. Consequently, we estimate that 70% of the total expenditure on each quota seat is inframarginal to school choice. The policy delivers clear gains for direct beneficiaries but is unlikely to affect school integration without broadening the pool of applicants.\n\nWednesday 30 March 2022 16:30-17:30\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nKU Hyejin (UCL) : The Rise of China and the Global Production of Scientific Knowledge\n\nJoint with Tianrui Mu (UCL)\n\nAbstract\n\nScientific progress is more important than ever in tackling many challenges the world faces. Recently, the momentum for new developments has shifted eastward, in particular as China has dramatically expanded its scientific output. Today, China trails only the US as the world’s leading producer of high-quality scientific research. Understanding how China’s ascent has affected worldwide production of scientific knowledge is therefore of key importance. To shed light on the causal impact of China’s rise in science on research productivity elsewhere, we focus on the evolution of scientific publications at world-leading universities over 1996-2016, exploiting patterns of research collaborations between institutions. We find that non-Chinese universities that have stronger historical links to China collaborate substantially more with China in the late 2000s and also produce more scientific output in general. These effects are heterogeneous across research fields and also across the quality of research publications. We explore the movements of Chinese students going abroad and returning to China as a possible mechanism driving these findings.\n\nWednesday 23 March 2022 16:30-17:45\n\nSalle R2.01, Campus Jourdan\n\nSERNEELS Pieter (Universty of East Anglia) : The collective action mechanism in community-based monitoring of public services.\n\nwith Abigail Barr, Frederick Mugisha, Andrew Zeitlin\n\nAbstract\n\nWe conducted an experiment to test one mechanism through which community monitoring of public services may operate. Working with the Government of Uganda, we randomly assigned schools and their management committees to two variants of a score card. Community based score cards are found to have higher impact than standardised ones on teacher absenteeism and pupil enrolment, presence and learning, by individual or joint testing employing randomisation inference. They also induce higher cooperation, measured directly through a public goods game. Further analysis rules out information as an alternative channel. Mediation analysis confirms that a substantial share of impact stems from collective action.\n\nWednesday 15 December 2021 16:30-17:45\n\nSalle R1.09, Campus Jourdan\n\nCASSAN Guilhem (University of Namur) : Stopping rule and sex selective abortion: new measures and world evidence\n\nJean Marie Baland et François Woitrin (University of Namur)\n\nAbstract\n\nWhen parents want a specific number of children of a given gender (boys, in general), they can use two methods: the \"stopping rule\" and sex selective abortion. The stopping rule refers to a behaviour by which parents continue child bearing till they reach their desired number of boys. Sex selective abortion refers to the choice of aborting foetuses of a specific gender. In societies in which gender preferences are prevalent, these methods can heavily affect fertility practices. We propose two novel theory based measures of detection of these practices. Taking the perspective of the child rather than that of the family, these measures are easily implementable, precise, and rely on fewer assumptions than other measures in use. We first show that, under the stopping rule, girls are, on average, exposed to a larger number of younger siblings than boys. We then propose a new method to detect the prevalence of the stopping rule in a given society. This method allows us to identify countries in which the stopping rule prevails, some of which have been largely ignored in the literature. We also identify countries in which the stopping rule targets a desired number of girls rather than boys. Second, we show that sex selective abortion leads to boys have on average more elder daughters than girls. We then propose a new method to detect the prevalence of sex selective abortion in a given society and implement it at the world level.\n\nTuesday 7 December 2021 16:30-17:45\n\nOn line\n\nBATISTA Catia (Nova School of Business and Economics.) : Can Information and Alternatives to Irregular Migration Reduce “Backway” Migration from the Gambia?\n\njoint with Tijan Bah, Flore Gubert and David McKenzie\n\nAbstract\n\nIrregular migration from West Africa to Europe across the Sahara and Mediterranean is extremely risky for the migrants and a key policy concern. We conducted a cluster-randomized experiment with 3,641 young men from 391 settlements in The Gambia to test three different approaches designed to reduce risky, irregular migration. The first is to provide potential migrants with better information about the risks to be faced during the journey, including testimonials from those who have attempted the journey and statistics on the likelihood of experiencing negative events en route. The second intervention is to also provide a second safer migration alternative by adding information and assistance for migration to neighboring Senegal. The third approach is to provide vocational skill training in addition to the information about irregular migration. We evaluate the effect of these policies on actions towards migrating the “backway”, migration to Senegal, and overall well-being.\n\nWednesday 24 November 2021 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R1.09; Campus Jourdan\n\nVANDEWALLE Lore (The Graduate Institute Geneva.) : Childcare for family welfare: Experimental evidence from Uganda\n\nAbstract\n\nWe report findings from a field experiment in Uganda where women with children aged 3-5 were randomly offered either (i) a childcare subsidy, (ii) a cash grant equivalent in value to the childcare subsidy (iii) both the childcare subsidy and the cash grant. A fourth group of households remain as the control group. After a year, we find that access to childcare has improved child development substantially and increased household income by more than 30 percent. Strikingly, the impact of the childcare subsidy on household income is as large as that generated by the cash transfer. In terms of mechanisms, our data suggest that childcare primarily addresses a time constraint, allowing women to work more effectively and their partners to work more hours, while the cash treatment eases a capital constraint, stimulating investment and women’s labor supply in self-employment. We do not find evidence of strong complementarities between the childcare subsidy and the cash transfer.\n\nWednesday 10 November 2021 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R1.09, Campus Jourdan\n\nDELFINO Alexia (Bocconi University) : Breaking Gender Barriers: Experimental Evidence on Men in Pink-Collar Jobs\n\nAbstract\n\nTraditionally female-dominated sectors are growing and male-dominated ones shrinking, yet sectorial male shares are not changing. Why? I embed a field experiment within the UK national recruitment program for social workers to analyze barriers to men’s entry and the nature of men’s sorting into female-dominated occupations. I modify the content of recruitment messages to potential applicants to exogenously vary two key drivers of selection: perceived gender shares and expectations of returns to talent. I find that perceived gender shares do not affect men’s applications, while increasing expected returns to talent encourages men to apply and improves the average quality of the applicants. This enables the employer to hire more talented men, who consistently perform better on the job and are not more likely to leave vis-á-vis men with lower expected returns to talent. I conclude by showing that there is no trade-off between men’s entry and women’s exit among talented applicants, both at hiring and on-the-job, and thus the net impact of raising expected returns to talent for the employer is positive.\n\nWednesday 3 November 2021 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R1.09, Campus Jourdan\n\nSINGH Manpreet (PSE) : Annulé et reporté\n\nWednesday 13 October 2021 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.21, Campus Jourdan\n\nSTRAUB Stéphane (TSE) : Decentralization in Indonesia and Local Outcomes. Estimating Spending Efficiency\n\nwith Jonas Gathen, Toulouse School of Economics, Vitalijs Jascisens, Higher School of Economics, Moscow\n\nAbstract\n\nWe analyze Indonesia’s big-bang decentralization, which in the early 2000s translated into massive transfers of resources to local districts. Using the non-linearity of the allocation rule to circumvent the potential endogeneity that arises when regressing local outcomes on district revenues, we start by answering two questions.

Despite their ubiquity, we know little with certainty about the consequences of such collective contribution requirements, either for the average impact of projects or the distribution of project benefits or costs, or whether these consequences differ when contribution requirements are in cash or labour. We experimentally evaluate the effects of community contribution requirements in cash and in labour in a project to provide safe sources of drinking water in rural Bangladesh. Cash contribution requirements lead to a large decline in take-up and impact, relative to a contribution waiver, while labour contribution requirements of the same nominal value do not. The difference appears primarily driven by the low real monetary value of time in the study communities. The results suggest that substantial welfare gains might be realized by replacing cash contribution requirements with labour contribution requirements in other contexts in which the monetary value of time is low.\n\nWednesday 15 September 2021 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R1.09, Campus Jourdan\n\nMUHAMMAD Haseeb (University of Geneva) : Resource Scarcity and Cooperation\n\nAbstract\n\nClimate change is likely to increase the risk of both transitory and prolonged water shortages in many developing countries. It is unclear how communities sharing joint water resources will respond to these shortages. This paper shows that water scarcity can have a different effect on cooperation over water, depending on whether the shortage is transitory or long term. Using daily outlet-level water theft data from Pakistan, I first show that an unexpected short-term water shortage increases the probability of over-extraction of surface water. Then, I examine how farmers respond to long-term scarcity by exploiting a natural experiment that decreases the effective availability of groundwater – the key substitute for surface water – through an increase in groundwater pollution. The instrumented difference-in-differences estimates show that, in contrast to a short-term shock, long term scarcity increases inter-village cooperation. Moreover, farmers experiencing long-term scarcity become better at managing water theft under transitory water shortages. Finally, I provide evidence that informal institutions and caste networks are important for managing water theft under prolonged scarcity. Taken together, these results suggest that long-term environmental change can push communities to adapt by investing in informal mechanisms that enforce cooperation.\n\nWednesday 16 June 2021 16:30-18:00\n\nVia Zoom\n\nA. SHRESTHA Slesh (National University of Singapore) : Motivating Equity: The Impact of Incentives on Elected Local Politicians in India\n\nAbstract\n\nOver the last few years there has been a widespread perception that democracy is under siege, and that the mere existence of electoral representation does not guarantee good government. Some of this skepticism is due to government failures associated with electoral democracy, including clientelism where goods and services are provided to sub-groups of the electorate for political support, that make the actions of government more inequitable. The question then is whether policy interventions can be designed as a corrective to these government failures, to improve the performance of elected officials, and motivate them to act more equitably? To investigate this, we randomly assigned elected village leaders in India to one of two incentive schemes: either a higher public budget, or a non-financial reward in the form of a public certificate that they can use in election campaigns. Both incentives improved the performance of elected leaders. More strikingly, the latter nonfinancial incentive also led to a more equitable within-village allocation of public resources. On the other hand, financial incentives did not affect within-village inequities. These results are consistent with the theoretical predictions from our voting model where the signal of unobserved politician quality varies across different voter sub-groups, and they provide strong evidence that policies that reduce such information asymmetries can lead to more equitable government action.\n\nWednesday 2 June 2021 16:30-18:00\n\nVia Zoom\n\nCALVI Rosella (Rice University) : Til Dowry Do Us Part: Bargaining and Violence in Indian Families\n\nwith Ajinkya Keskar\n\nAbstract\n\nWe develop a non-cooperative bargaining model with incomplete information linking dowry payments, domestic violence, resource allocation between a husband and a wife, and separation. Our model generates several predictions, which we test empirically using amendments to the Indian anti-dowry law as a natural experiment. We document a decline in women’s decision-making power and separations, and a surge in domestic violence following the amendments. These unintended effects are attenuated when social stigma against separation is low and, in some circumstances, when gains from marriage are high. Whenever possible, parents increase investment in their daughters’ human capital to compensate for lower dowries.\n\nWednesday 19 May 2021 16:30-18:00\n\nVia Zoom\n\nKARING Anne (Princeton) : The Social Multiplier from Visibility: Experimental Evidence from Deworming in Kenya\n\nKarim Naguib\n\nFull text [pdf]\n\nWednesday 5 May 2021 16:30-18:00\n\nVia Zoom\n\nBOUDREAU Laura (Columbia University) : Multinational enforcement of labor law: Experimental evidence from Bangladesh’s apparel sector\n\nAbstract\n\nWestern stakeholders are increasingly demanding that multinationals sourcing from developing countries be accountable for working conditions upstream in their supply chains. In response, many multinationals privately enforce labor standards in these countries, but the effects of their interventions on local firms and workers are unknown. I partnered with 29 multinational retail and apparel firms to enforce local labor laws on their suppliers in Bangladesh. I implemented a field experiment with 84 garment factories, randomly enforcing a mandate for safety committees. The intervention increases compliance with the law and improves measures of safety. My findings are consistent with a model of imperfect monitoring in which MNCs provide positive penalties for noncompliance. These improvements do not appear to come at significant costs to suppliers in terms of efficiency. Factories with better managerial practices drive the improvements, while those with poor practices do not improve, and in these factories, workers’ job satisfaction declines.\n\nWednesday 21 April 2021 16:30-18:00\n\nvia Zoom\n\nHARDY Morgan (NYU Abu Dhabi) : The Impact of Firm Downsizing on Workers: Evidence from Ethiopia's Ready-Made Garment Industry\n\nWednesday 14 April 2021 16:30-18:00\n\nVia Zoom\n\nBANERJEE Abhijit (MIT) : Trust and Efficiency in the Market for Healthcare in Low-income Countries\n\nWednesday 31 March 2021 16:30-18:00\n\nVia Zoom\n\nAGGARWAL Shilpa (India School of Business) : Saving for Multiple Financial Needs: Evidence from Lockboxes and Mobile Money in Malawi\n\nAbstract\n\nWe test whether the provision of multiple labeled savings accounts affects savings and downstream outcomes in an experiment with 761 microentrepreneurs in urban Malawi.

Data from novel high-frequency surveys suggests that both types of accounts had impacts on downstream outcomes, including farming decisions and credit extended to customers.

Martínez, University of Chicago, Harris.\n\nAbstract\n\nDo people forego otherwise profitable investments under civil conflict? Answering this question is crucial to our understanding of the costs of violence, but it is difficult to answer because it requires measuring willingness to invest and a source of exogenous variation in conflict intensity. We exploit a unique administrative dataset from Colombia’s largest agricultural bank and the 2016 demobilization agreement between the Colombian government and insurgent group FARC to overcome these challenges. A difference-in-difference strategy yields three main findings: First, credit to small producers increases in municipalities with historical FARC presence after the agreement. Higher loan applications drive this increase, with no change in supply-side variables. Second, a simple theoretical framework combined with rich information on characteristics of applicants and projects (including credit scores and loan outcomes) suggests that producers forego investments with a low return, but not riskier ones, amid conflict. Third, conflict is not the binding constraint on investment in areas with low access to markets. Higher investment, unchanged default rates, and increased nighttime luminosity suggest an overall positive economic impact of lower conflict intensity.\n\nWednesday 17 March 2021 16:30-18:00\n\nVia Zoom\n\nBEST Michael (Columbia University) : The Allocation of Authority in Organizations: A Field Experiment with Bureaucrats\n\nOriana Bandiera, Adnan Qadir Khan, & Andrea Prat\n\nAbstract\n\nWe design a field experiment to study how the allocation of authority between frontline procurement officers and their monitors affects performance both directly and through the response to incentives. In collaboration with the government of Punjab,Pakistan, we shift authority from monitors to procurement officers and introduce financial incentives to a sample of 600 procurement officers in 26 districts. We find that autonomy alone reduces prices by 9% without reducing quality and that the effect is stronger when the monitor tends to delay approvals for purchases until the end of the fiscal year. In contrast, the effect of performance pay is muted, except when agents face a monitor who does not delay approvals. Time use data reveal agents’ responses vary along the same margin: autonomy increases the time devoted to procurement and this leads to lower prices only when monitors cause delays. By contrast, incentives work when monitors do not cause delays. The results illustrate that organizational design and anti-corruption policies must balance agency issues at different levels of the hierarchy.\n\nFull text [pdf]\n\nWednesday 3 March 2021 16:30-18:00\n\nVia Zoom\n\nDUFLO Esther (MIT) : Encouraging Social Distancing: Evidence from Several Randomized Controlled Trials\n\nWednesday 17 February 2021 16:30-18:00\n\nVia Zoom\n\nSQUIRES Munir (University of British Columbia) : Economic consequences of kinship: Evidence from US bans on cousin marriage\n\nAbstract\n\nClose-kin marriage, by sustaining tightly knit clan-like structures, may impede development. We use 19th and 20th century US state-level bans on cousin marriage to study the causal effect of tight kinship on economic outcomes. We show that these bans did reduce rates of in-marriage, and that affected descendants therefore have higher incomes and more schooling. We examine the following potential mechanisms, drawn from the literature: geographic mobility, female labor force participation, and genetic effects. Our results are most consistent with increased urbanization leading to the increase in income.\n\nWednesday 10 February 2021 16:30-18:00\n\nVia zoom\n\nNOACK Claudia (Oxford) : Economies of scale and ecology of scope\n\nAbstract\n\nFarmers in Uganda grow substantially more crops per unit of land than their counterparts in developing countries. While specialization is often related to economic efficiency, a large ecological literature establishes the positive relationship between species diversity and productivity. Here, we model and estimate the private benefits of crop diversity in order to understand why Ugandan farmers are more diversified than their counterparts in developed countries. Based on empirical facts derived from 65,851 fields, we develop a model that combines the efficiency increasing mechanisms of specialization from the economics literature with economies of scope resulting from ecological interactions and other input complementarities. The model predicts that crop diversity enhances productivity in low input agriculture but also that these private benefits of diversity decline with increasing control over the production environment. We then test these predictions with plot level data from the low input agriculture of Uganda. We find that a 10 percent increase of farm size and a 10 percent increase of labor increases crop diversity by 1.6 and 1.8 percent respectively consistent with the presence of both economies of scale and economies of scope. Holding labor and land fixed, we also find that a 10 percent increase of crop diversity increases revenues by 3 percent, in line with economies of scope. Comparing harvest quantities of crops grown individually and in combination with other crops we show that the economies of scope are likely to result from ecological interactions. Planting a crop in combination with one other crop increases harvest quantities per unit of input by 14 % compared to monocultures. These results suggest that the high levels of crop diversity in Uganda are determined by the interaction between economies of scope and economies of scale. They also suggest that crop diversity is an important productivity enhancing input for agriculture of Uganda and not the result of uninsured risk.\n\nFull text [pdf]\n\nWednesday 16 December 2020 16:30-18:00\n\nvia ZOOM\n\nTAPSOBA Augustin (Toulouse School of Economics) : The Power of Markets: Impact of Desert Locust Invasions on Child Health\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper investigates the consequences of a locust plague that occurred in Mali in 2004. We provide evidence of substantial crop market effects that explain the space-time pattern of the estimated impact of this plague. We argue first that the plague has affected households in Mali through two channels: first, a speculative price effect that kicked in during the plague itself, followed by a local crop failure effect. We find that, in terms of health setbacks, children exposed in utero only to the speculative price effect suffered as much as those exposed to the actual crop failure effect. Once we account for the impact on local crop prices, the estimated speculative effect vanishes, whereas the crop failure effect persists. Children born in isolated areas suffer more from the crop failure effect. Our results suggest that addressing local market reactions to this type of agricultural shocks is crucial for policy design.\n\nWednesday 2 December 2020 16:30-18:00\n\nvia ZOOM\n\nKALA Namrata (MIT) : Mechanizing Agriculture: Impacts on Labor and Productivity\n\nAbstract\n\nThe mechanization of production has become a primary feature of modern agriculture and is central to agricultural labor productivity. This paper estimates the returns to mechanization and its impact on labor using a randomized controlled experiment. Treatment farmers were given subsidy vouchers to access agricultural equipment from nearby custom hiring centers(CHC). In addition, a subset of treatment farmers were given cash transfers. The voucher treatment increases overall mechanization hours, with an intent to treatment effect size of about 0.13 standard deviations (a treatment on the treated effect size of 0.36 standard deviations). We find no significant improvements in productivity due to mechanization on average. However, family labor decreases in response to the subsidy in capital, and farmers reduce hired labor in all farming processes, including those not directly affected by mechanization. We document that family labor is mostly occupied in supervision activities, and that their lower engagement in farming is associated with higher non-agricultural income. The decline in supervision labor and the decline in hired labor across farming processes are interpreted as evidence of output standardization, which is beneficial in the presence of contracting frictions. We use key elasticities from the experiment and a structural model of task-replacement to infer the marginal return to mechanizable tasks, which we estimate at 35% per season.\n\nWednesday 18 November 2020 16:30-18:00\n\nvia ZOOM\n\nC.AKER Jenny (Tufst University ) : Harvesting the rain:The adoption of environmental technologies in the Sahel*\n\nKelsey Jack\n\nAbstract\n\nWe study the adoption of an environmental technology (demi-lunes) in Niger. Like many environmental technologies, demi-lunes require an upfront investment in exchange for medium-run benefits, which agronomists estimate to be substantial. We implement a cluster randomized control trial in 180 villages with treatments designed to relax informational, credit and labor constraints. Relative to a pure control, training increases the probability of adoption by 90 percentage points. Combining training with either unconditional or conditional cash transfers has no additional effect on the extensive margin of adoption, but increases the intensity of adoption by 35-50 percent relative to training alone. We also observe increases in agricultural output, consistent with agronomic descriptions of the costs and benefits of adoption, as well as other measures of household well-being. Over 90 percent of treatment households have operational demi-lunes two years later. Using the pattern of results and our experimental design, we investigate the mechanisms underlying our findings.\n\nWednesday 4 November 2020 16:30-18:00\n\nvia Zoom\n\nMACCHIAVELLO Rocco (LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS ) : Language Barriers in MNCs and Knowledge Transfers\n\nwith Louise Guillouët (Columbia University), Amit K. Khandelwal (Columbia GSB & NBER) and Matthieu Teachout (IGC)\n\nAbstract\n\nA distinctive feature of foreign affiliates of MNCs is that they are led by foreign managers (FMs) who supervise domestic middle managers (DMs) who supervise domestic production workers (PWs). Language differences between FMs and DMs increase the cost of communication, might hamper knowledge transfers to DMs and thus limit the beneficial impact of FDI for the host country. We develop a model that clarifies under which circumstances a social planner should intervene to reduce the communication barrier between FMs and DMs. This occurs when: (i) DMs learn management from FMs; (ii) communication is costly to FMs and non-contractible; and, (iii) knowledge gained by DMs from FMs is valued by domestic firms. We experimentally test the validity of these assumptions in the context of MNCs operating in Myanmar, a context in which communication between FMs and DMs occurs in English and yet the typical DM possesses low English proficiency. The first experiment provides English training to a random sample of DMs working at MNCs. At endline, treated DMs have higher English proficiency, communicate more frequently with their FMs, are more involvement in firm management, and perform better in simulated management tasks. Treated DMs also report higher WTP for additional meetings with FMs which supports the assumption that communication within firms is non-contractable. The second experiment recruits human-resource managers at domestic firms and asks them to rate hypothetical job candidates who randomly differ in their characteristics. Employers particularly value candidates with both higher English proficiency and MNC experience, and this is driven, in part, by a premium for frequent interactions with FMs. Overall, the evidence suggests an under-investment in language relative to the social optimum.\n\nWednesday 21 October 2020 16:30-18:00\n\nvia ZOOM\n\nNAVARRO-SOLA Laia (IIES Stockholm) : Secondary School Expansion through Televised Lessons: The Labor Market Returns of the Mexican Telesecundaria\n\nAbstract\n\nIn areas where there is an insufficient supply of qualified teachers, delivering instruction through technology may be a solution to meet the demand for education. This paper analyzes the educational and labor market impacts of an expansion of junior secondary education in Mexico through telesecundarias - schools using televised lessons, currently serving 1.4 million students. To isolate the effects of telesecundarias, I exploit their staggered rollout from 1968 to present. I show that for every additional telesecundaria per 50 children, ten students enroll in junior secondary education and two pursue further education. Using the telesecundaria expansion as an instrument, I find that an additional year of education induced by telesecundaria enrollment increases average income by 17.6%. This increase in income comes partly from increased labor force participation and a shift away from agriculture and the informal sector. Since schooling decisions are sequential, the estimated returns combine the direct effect of attending telesecundarias and the effects of further schooling. I decompose these two effects by interacting the telesecundaria expansion with baseline access to upper secondary institutions. Roughly 84% of the estimated returns come directly from junior secondary education, while the remaining 16% are returns to higher educational levels.\n\nWednesday 14 October 2020 16:30-18:00\n\nVia ZOOM\n\nIMELDA I. (Universidad Carlos III MADRID) : Clean Energy Access: Gender Disparity, Health, and Labor Supply\n\nwith Anjali P. Verma\n\nAbstract\n\nWomen are known to bear the largest share of health, time, and labor supply burden associated with a lack of modern energy. In this paper, we study the impact of clean energy access on adult health and labor supply outcomes by exploiting a nationwide rollout of clean cooking fuel program in Indonesia. This program led to a large-scale fuel switching, from kerosene, a dirty fuel, to liquid petroleum gas, a cleaner one. Using longitudinal survey data from the Indonesia Family Life Survey and exploiting the staggered structure of the program rollout, we find that access to clean cooking fuel led to a significant improvement in women's health, particularly among those who spend most of their time indoors doing housework. We also find an increase in women's work hours, suggesting that access to cleaner fuel can improve women's health and plausibly their productivity, allowing them to supply more market labor. For men, we find an increase in the work hours and propensity to have an additional job, particularly in households where women accrued the largest health and labor benefits from the program. These results highlight the role of clean energy in reducing gender-disparity in health and point to the existence of positive externalities from the improved health of women on other members of the household.\n\nWednesday 7 October 2020 17:00-18:00\n\nSalle R2.21, Campus Jourdan\n\nC.AKER Jenny (Tufst University ) : CANCELLED AND POSTPONED Let it Rain: What Drives the Adoption of Environmental Technologies in the Sahel ?\n\nwith B.

We provide information about job prospects to randomly chosen batches of DDU-GKY, a large-scale training programme in India. We find that better informed trainees are more likely to stay in the jobs in which they are placed. Our findings are consistent with two distinct mechanisms. First, information about job prospects improves selection into placement: it increases dropout of trainees with higher education (who have better outside options) and reduces dropout of trainees with lower education (who have worse outside options). Second, information improves trainees' job readiness: among males, and trainees with higher expectations at baseline, it increases employment unconditionally, i.e. independently from selection into placement. Our findings suggest that discussing job prospects during vocational training can enhance its effect on youth employment\n\nWednesday 3 June 2020 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan, 48 Bd Jourdan 75014 Paris\n\nMACCHIAVELLO Rocco (LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS ) : Séance annulée\n\nWednesday 20 May 2020 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan, 48 Bd Jourdan 75014 Paris\n\nCALVI Rosella (Rice University) : Séance annulée\n\nWednesday 13 May 2020 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan, 48 Bd Jourdan 75014 Paris\n\nNOACK Claudia (Oxford) : Séance annulée\n\nWednesday 6 May 2020 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan, 48 Bd Jourdan 75014 Paris\n\nKALA Namrata (MIT) : Séance annulée\n\nWednesday 1 April 2020 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan, 48 Bd Jourdan 75014 Paris\n\nSQUIRES Munir (University of British Columbia) : Séance annulée et reportée\n\nFriday 27 March 2020 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan, 48 Bd Jourdan 75014 Paris\n\nGENICOT Garance ((Georgetown University and CEPR)) : Séance annulée et reportée\n\nWednesday 25 March 2020 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan, 48 Bd Jourdan 75014 Paris\n\nBEST Michael (Columbia University) : Séance annulée et reportée\n\nWednesday 18 March 2020 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan, 48 Bd Jourdan 75014 Paris\n\nSHAH Manisha (UC Berkeley) : Séance annulée et reportée\n\nWednesday 4 March 2020 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan, 48 Bd Jourdan 75014 Paris\n\nBLATTMAN Chris (University of Chicago) : Gang Rule: Understanding and Countering Criminal Governance\n\nAbstract\n\nUrban criminal groups rule tens to hundreds of millions of people worldwide. In Medellin, Colombia, gangs resolve disputes, police neighborhoods, enforce contracts, and tax businesses in their territories. The literature suggests that gang rule arises not only because governments fail to project their power, but also because they delegate governing to criminals. We first document and describe criminal governance, its correlates, and its origins in Medellin, qualitatively and quantitatively. We then look observationally at the effect of long-run state presence on criminal rule. Finally, we worked with the government to develop the first ever gang-level randomized trial. Most policy solutions are coercive and repressive. We identified a nonviolent approach to intensify municipal and community governance and attempt to displace gang rule. The city identified 80 neighborhoods where their governance is weak and gangs are strong. For 18 months the city intensified outreach and services to a random 40 of these neighborhoods—a 10-fold improvement in street-level staff plus an intensification of municipal services. The intervention had the expected effects in gang neighborhoods where gangs elect not to govern. In neighborhoods where gangs seek to govern, however, the city’s effort backfired, reducing citizens’ use of the state and state legitimacy. We conclude with paths forward\n\nWednesday 26 February 2020 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan, 48 Bd Jourdan 75014\n\nDI GIORGI Giacomo (University of Geneva) : Farmers to Entrepreneurs\n\nAbstract\n\nNon farming enterprise might constitute an ex-post income smoothing device for uninsured households. So that the decision to initiate an enterprise is led by necessity rather than skills. We test such hypothesis and find that farmers become entrepreneurs in response to negative productivity shocks to farming, while credit constraints do not seem to play a substantial role. Importantly, and consistently with irreversible investment or learning-by-doing, these reluctant entrepreneurs do not revert to full farming following new positive productivity shocks. These reluctant entrepreneurs are typically “bad” entrepreneurs while they were above average farmers. This selection might contribute to the understanding of the dual phenomenon of low-productivity firms and farms coexisting in developing countries while speaking to the structural transformation of the economy.\n\nWednesday 18 December 2019 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan, 48 Bd Jourdan 75014 Paris\n\nMIQUEL - FLORENSA Pepita (Toulouse School of Economics) : Buyer-Driven Upgrading in GVCs: The Sustainable Quality Program in Colombia\n\nR. Macchiavello\n\nAbstract\n\nAbstract: This paper studies the Sustainable Quality Program in Colombia – a quality upgrading program implemented on behalf of a multinational coffee buyer. The Program is a bundle of contractual arrangements involving farmers, intermediaries, exporters and the multinational buyer. We tackle three questions. First, we inves- tigate the impact of the Program on the supply of quality coffee. Eligible farmers upgraded their plantations, expanded land under coffee cultivation, increased quality and received higher farm gate prices. Second, we quantify how the Program gains are shared between farmers and intermediaries along the chain. In regions in which the Program was rolled out surplus along the chain increased by ? 30%. Eligible farmers kept at least half of the gains and their welfare increased by ? 20%. Finally, we examine how the Program works conducting counterfactual exercises and comparing the Program price premia along the chain against two prominent non-buyer driven certifications. The Program achieved a better transmission of the export gate price premium for quality to the farm gate and curbed market failures that stifled quality upgrading. Contractual arrangements at the export gate significantly contributed to higher farmers welfare in rural areas.\n\nWednesday 4 December 2019 16:30-18:00\n\nSalle R2.01 Campus Jourdan,48 Bd Jourdan 75014 Paris\n\nCAI Jing (University of Maryland) : Direct and Indirect Effects of Financial Access on SMEs.\n\nAbstract\n\nWe measure the direct and indirect effects of access to finance using a randomized experiment with 3,100 firms in 78 local markets in China, which created variation in firms’ access to a new loan product both within and across markets.
