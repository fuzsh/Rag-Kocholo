This document discusses the evolution of social stereotypes about male homosexuality in Spain from the Franco dictatorship to the present. It identifies three periods: pre-gay (Franco era), gay (transition to democracy), and hyper-gay (current). During pre-gay, the dominant stereotypes were \"marica\" (effeminate) and \"maricon\" (masculine active male). As democracy emerged, stereotypes shifted to focus on \"gayness\" instead of sexual roles. Both social views and self-perceptions of homosexuals changed. Now in the hyper-gay period, homosexuals have more autonomy in their public representations, challenging old stereotypes.",
