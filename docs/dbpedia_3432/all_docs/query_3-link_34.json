Mycotourism is an innovative, specialised tourism product that has been successfully introduced in some regions of the world, helping to combat seasonality and promote economic development in rural areas. The aim of the study was to analyse the development of mycotourism in Poland in comparison with other countries. As a method, a questionnaire on the cultural significance of mushrooms was developed and disseminated via social media. It was found that there are strong mycophilic tendencies in Poland, leading to a strong interest in mushrooms, both in terms of cultural and culinary traditions. They are also a factor that attracts tourists to the forest areas. In contrast, the UK and Germany are more mycophobic, resulting in a lower interest in mushrooms, limited culinary use, and a lower awareness of their role in the ecosystem and their potential health benefits. The low average score for knowledge of mushrooms in countries such as the UK indicates a need for increased mycological education that can contribute to a better understanding of the conservation of these important components of the forest floor. The high proportion of people who see mushroom picking in Poland as a form of recreation emphasises its role as an important cultural and potential nature tourism asset. In Poland, where long traditions are associated with mushrooms and mushroom picking, they have a strong influence on the choice of mycological tourism, especially in regions with a rich tradition of mushroom picking. The high percentage of mushrooms used for culinary purposes, especially in Poland, emphasises their value and influences the health component of the diet, which is rich in proteins, vitamins, and minerals. Research has shown that mushroom consumption and its effects on health are perceived positively. This is evidenced by higher ratings in Poland than in the UK and Germany, indicating a general awareness of the health benefits of mushrooms, even though their use in medicine remains limited. The low level of awareness of the role of mushrooms and their potential health benefits suggests that educational and promotional activities should be increased to sensitise the public to mushrooms.

In the present study, we examined the effects of woody biochar application on soil nitrogen (N) cycling over 8 months in a warm-temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest. Mineral soil samples were collected from the plots treated with different biochar applications (0, 5, and 10 Mg ha−1), and the soil inorganic N concentration was measured. Net mineralization and nitrification rates were determined in each plot using the resin–core method. Soil temperature and water content did not change significantly, but the pH increased significantly following biochar application. Soil inorganic N concentrations (NH4+ and NO3−) and net N transformation rates (mineralization and nitrification rates) were significantly reduced. Microbial biomass and the nitrification ratio (the ratio of nitrification rate to mineralization rate) were unchanged, indicating that the decrease in soil inorganic N concentration was due to the reduced mineralization rate. Adsorption of substrates (from organic matter) by the applied biochar is the most likely reason for the reduction in the N mineralization rate. The results indicate that biochar application does not necessarily stimulate N transformation, which will affect indirect carbon sequestration.

This, in turn, has hampered the healthy growth of planted trees, leading to a decline and, in severe cases, mortality of trees. Therefore, the rational regulation and utilization of rainwater, the primary water source in this region, may alleviate drought stress, ensuring the sustainability of the ecosystem. In this study, we investigated the impact of in situ rainwater collection and infiltration systems (IRCISs) on soil water, fine-root distribution, xylem vascular, and hydraulic conductivity characteristics in declining Robinia pseudoacacia forests. The results demonstrated that the application of an IRCIS can effectively increase plant available moisture content (0–5.0 m) of declining Robinia pseudoacacia forests. In particular, IRCIS treatment significantly increased xylem conduit diameter and plant hydraulic conductivity while substantially reducing the percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity in both roots and branches. Furthermore, IRCIS treatment significantly reduced the root biomass and distribution depth of Robinia pseudoacacia during both wet and dry years. This implies that IRCISs are beneficial for plant growth and survival. The findings of this study are significant for devising strategic methodologies for the planning and management of rainwater resources.

However, with the acceleration of urbanization, the accessibility and equity of urban PGS resources are increasingly threatened. This study aims to propose an integrated framework that considers accessibility and equity simultaneously to optimize the planning and layout of urban PGS within the high-speed ring road of Hefei City. This study first used an improved two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method to quantify the level of accessibility of urban PGS within the ring road. Then, with the use of Lorenz curves, Gini coefficients, and bivariate correlation coefficients, the equity characteristics of these PGSs were quantified and evaluated, followed by an analysis of their relationships to the accessibility levels. Based on this comprehensive evaluation, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was employed to the areas with low accessibility and equity levels to propose targeted PGS optimization strategies. The results showed that the accessibility of PGS was unevenly distributed, exhibiting a clear spatial difference of “east–west clustering”. The number of subdistricts with good (52.24–94.78) and best (94.79–283.58) accessibility was four, which was less than one-tenth of the total number of subdistricts in the study area. At the subdistrict level, the Gini coefficients for the accessible area of all types of PGSs were substantially higher than the international warning line of 0.4, indicating a substantial inequity in the population’s access to PGS. The implemented PSO algorithm resulted in eight new parks being planned at the specific optimized locations. Based on the actual land use status of the selected sites, recommendations are provided for the planning and layout of PGS. This proposed framework offers valuable data and theoretical insights for urban public green space planning and design in similar regions.

In this study, a new method was proposed to estimate near-surface SHPs by combining sensor-based soil infiltrability measurements with inverse modeling using HYDRUS-2D. The infiltration rate (IR) was estimated by combining the linear source inflow method with image processing, and Ks was estimated from the near-surface steady-state IR (NSIRM). The SWRC parameters described by the van Genuchten model were estimated using the inverse modeling method of HYDRUS-2D for the fitting of sensor-measured infiltration data. Subsequently, the parameters of the van Genuchten model, including α, n, and l, were inversely estimated. Three undisturbed soils, including two stand humus samples from cork oak (Quercus suber L.) and oleander (Pinus tabuliformis L.) stands and one sandy loam from a farmland, were sampled near the soil surface to validate the proposed method. The estimated Ks was evaluated by the constant head method (CHM). The estimated parameters of the SWRC were validated by those determined through the simultaneous measurement of the soil moisture content and water potential using sensor techniques. The results showed that the Ks estimated from the NSIRM for each soil sample were 23.40 ± 1.21, 23.86 ± 1.83, and 22.99 ± 2.26 mm h−1, respectively. In comparison, the Ks determined by the CHM were 24.41 ± 1.53, 24.26 ± 0.37, and 23.81 ± 0.10 mm/h, respectively. The relative errors of the proposed method were 4.14%, 1.64%, and 3.42%, respectively. For the SWRC estimation, the normalized root mean square errors (NRMSEs) between the measurements and the estimates for each soil sample were 0.1724, 0.1454, and 0.0606, respectively. Based on this, the AWC was obtained, and Ku was deduced from the estimated Ks and SWRC parameters for each soil sample. In general, the proposed method successfully estimates near-surface SHPs, simplifies the measurement device, and provides a new perspective for the in situ determination of near-surface SHPs under field conditions in the near future.

To compare the effects of the subtropical secondary forest artificial restoration model on soil microbial nutrient acquisition and limitation, we examined secondary forests (CKs), evergreen coniferous forests (GCPs), evergreen coniferous mixed broad-leaved forests (GCBMs), evergreen mixed broad-leaved forests (GBMs), and natural deciduous broad-leaved mixed forests (DBMs) as research subjects. Among them, GCPs, GCBMs, and GBMs were dominated by the species of the early, middle, and climax stages of subtropical forest succession, respectively. The activities and stoichiometry of β-1,4-glucosidase (BG), β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), and acid phosphatase (ACP) in the topsoil were analyzed. The results showed that the forest type significantly affects the activities of BG and LAP rather than NAG or ACP. The BG activity in DBMs was the lowest, while the LAP activity in CKs was significantly higher than that in plantations. Furthermore, the nutrient limitation of microbes was quantitatively analyzed by using the vector analysis of enzyme stoichiometry. The soil microbes in the study area were co-limited by C and P, and the nutrient limitation was in the order of C > P > N. Among the forests, the enzyme stoichiometric ratios in GCPs and DBMs were closest to 1:1:1. From CKs to GBMs, the microbial C limitation was increased, while the P limitation was decreased. The C limitation in DBMs was slightly lower than that in CKs. Overall, the P limitation in evergreen plantations was less than that in CKs. The soil bulk density, C/P, and N/P significantly influenced enzyme activities and stoichiometry. These results suggest that the artificial restoration of subtropical forests using evergreen species alleviated P limitation, while using deciduous broad-leaved species offered potential for alleviating microbial C limitation. Compared with evergreen broad-leaved species, employing pioneer and mid-successional or deciduous broad-leaved species can better achieve balanced microbial nutrient requirements.

In Myrtillus type, the modulus of elasticity and bending strength of the first thinning wood were 7.8 GPa and 66.0 MPa, respectively, whereas for more mature wood from the second thinnings, the modulus of elasticity and bending strength were 10.0 GPa and 80.3 MPa. The results were compared with final fellings, which resulted in the modulus of elasticity of 10.1 GPa and bending strength of 81.8 MPa. The bending properties of the first thinning material were low, and thus they did not indicate any potential for applications requiring high strength or stiffness and material homogeneity. On the contrary, the properties of Scots pine wood from the second commercial thinnings may be comparable with or sometimes even better than those of the final-felling wood. The results can be utilised in wood marketing, procurement, sorting, allocation to different industries and end-uses, as well as in wood processing, product sales, and branding.

In this study, we investigated the terpene compound composition and antioxidant activity of essential oils extracted from the needles of Pinus densiflora, Pinus koraiensis, Abies holophylla, and Juniperus chinensis collected in the harvest period (February, April, July, and October) planted on the campus of Chungbuk National University. The essential oil was separated by hydrodistillation. According to the analysis results of gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, the terpene compounds changed depending on the season and tree species. The proportions of monoterpene and sesquiterpene classes in the needles of P. densiflora, P. koraiensis, A. holophylla, and J. chinensis changed depending on the harvest period. The antioxidant activity by DPPH and ABTS assays varied depending on the species and seasons, and needles harvested from P. koraiensis showed the highest activity in all harvest periods. High antioxidant activity has been confirmed even at low concentrations in pine trees, so it is expected to play a role as a natural antioxidant. Additionally, since the composition of terpene compounds varies depending on the harvesting time and species, it is expected to have various uses in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and food industries.

Revealing the response patterns of trees at different altitudes to rapid warming in typical alpine mountain environments can help to predict the future distribution of forests in the region and the associated changes in the timberline. This study used tree-ring width data (band sampling) from Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii Rupr.) along an altitudinal gradient (970–1409 m) on Oakley Mountain to establish 10 chronologies and to analyze the growth–climate response of larch to warming and altitudinal changes along a gradient. The results showed that before rapid warming, larch growth was strongly influenced mainly by precipitation in July–August, while after warming, the growth was controlled mainly by precipitation (snowfall) in winter (October–April) and showed a significant positive correlation with the SPEI in winter and a negative correlation with temperature in February–April (early spring). This indicates that the rapid warming event led to a drastic change in the water heat balance during the pre-growth period of the trees in the study area, which shifted the tree growth from being restricted by drought in the growing season before warming to being restricted by winter drought (i.e., the lagged effect of snowfall in the pre-growing season) after warming and that the trees at low altitudes suffered from more severe winter drought. In the future, as the global climate warms further, the growth of mountain larch at low altitudes (below 1200 m) will continue to decrease, and the coupling of winter snowfall and seasonal (February–April) warming will increase the upper altitude limit at which winter drought occurs for larch in the study area; additionally, larch at higher altitudes will be able to cope with this ecological process better.

This study utilizes survey data from 2023 on forest farmers in ecologically fragile ethnic areas in China. Based on sustainability, a five-dimensional evaluation index system for the happiness of forest farmers’ families has been constructed. First, the CRITIC-TOPSIS model is employed to calculate the happiness scores of forest farming households. Subsequently, the Tobit model and the mediation effect model are applied to examine and analyze the influencing factors and mechanisms of internet usage on the happiness of forest farmers’ families. The study finds that, first, an increase of one unit in terms of internet use is associated with a 0.031-unit increase in the happiness of forest farmers’ families, and that education, social perception, and policy perception all have a positive effect on the happiness of forest farmers’ families. Second, the mechanism of action suggests that internet use significantly increases forest farmers’ families’ happiness through subjective class identity. Third, further heterogeneity analyses revealed that internet use contributed to the happiness of forest farmers’ families in the male group, the low human capital group, and the group with an ecological forest ranger in the family. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the construction of digital rural infrastructure and develop new models such as digital forestry; cultivate and introduce specialized digital talents in rural areas and enhance the digital literacy of forestry farmers; and assist forestry farmers in establishing class identity concepts and social values conducive to the sustainable development of forests and implement ecological values in production practices, thereby improving the happiness of forest farmers’ families.

According to the existing research on forest fire spread, the models established in various countries have typical regional characteristics. A fire spread model established in a specific region is only suitable for the local area, and there is still a great deal of uncertainty as to whether or not the established model is suitable for fire spread simulation for the same fuel in other regions. Although many fire spread models have been established, the fuel characteristics applicable to each model, such as the fuel loading, fuel moisture content, combustibility, etc., are not similar. It is necessary to evaluate the applicability of different fuel characteristics to different fire spread models. We combined ground investigation, historical data collection, model improvements, and statistical analysis to establish a multi-model forest fire spread simulation method (FIRER) that shows the burning time, perimeter, burning area, overlap area, and spread rate of fire sites. This method is a large-scale, high-resolution fire growth model based on fire spread in eight directions on a regular 30 m grid. This method could use any one of four different physical models (McArthur, Rothermel, FBP, and Wang Zhengfei (China)) for fire behavior. This method has an option to represent fire breaks from roads, rivers, and fire suppression. We can evaluate which model is more suitable in a specific area. This method was tested on a single historical lightning fire in the Daxing’an Mountains. Different scenarios were tested and compared: using each of the four fire behavior models, with fire breaks on or off, and with a single or suspected double fire ignition location of the historical fire. The results show that the Rothermel model is the best model in the simulation of the Hanma lightning fire; the overlap area is 5694.4 hm2. Meanwhile, the real fire area in FIRER is 5800.9 hm2; both the Kappa and Sørensen values exceed 0.8, providing high accuracy in fire spread simulations. FIRER performs well in the automatic identification of fire break zones and multiple ignited points. Compared with FARSITE, FIRER performs well in predicting accuracy. Compared with BehavePlus, FIRER also has advantages in simulating large-scale fire spread. However, the complex data preparation stage of FIRER means that FIRER still has great room for improvement. This research provides a practical basis for the comparison of the practicability and applicability of various fire spread models and provides more effective practical tools and a scientific basis for decision-making and the management of fighting forest fires.

The 14-day experiment was performed in a hydroponic system, and metals were applied at 1.5 mM in a Knop’s solution. Drought simulation was achieved by adding sorbitol at a moderate level (200 mM). Isolated Zn treatment enhanced plant growth, more pronouncedly in females. Equimolar Cu treatment caused diverse reactions, and females exhibited significantly higher tolerance. Male specimens were less tolerant to isolated drought and to combined drought and metal presence. The highest contents of Cu and Zn were found in roots, compared to the aboveground tissues (wooden rods and leaves), of both female and male metal-treated plants. Simultaneously applied drought limited Zn accumulation in roots and elevated its translocation to leaves while increasing Cu accumulation, predominantly in females showing higher tolerance. Both isolated and combined drought and metals reduced leaf water content, caused the allocation of mineral nutrients (Ca, Mg, K, and Na), and affected metabolism in a stressor-specific and sex-dependent manner. For males, Cu accumulation in the leaves was significantly correlated with the majority of metabolites, while for both sexes, kaempferol and salicylic acid were strongly correlated, indicating their role in tolerance against the metal. The obtained results are an excellent starting point for the practical use of male and female Salix × fragilis L. in areas heavily polluted with Cu or Zn and exposed to drought, for the purpose of their recultivation.

This paper presents a novel framework that integrates street greenery with accessibility, enabling a detailed evaluation of the daily street-level greenery visible to residents. This pioneering approach introduces a new measurement methodology to quantify the quality of urban street greening, providing robust empirical evidence to support its enhancement. This study delves into Nanjing’s five districts, employing advanced image semantic segmentation based on machine learning techniques to segment and extract green vegetation from Baidu Street View (BSV) images. Leveraging spatial syntax, it analyzes street network data sourced from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to quantify the accessibility values of individual streets. Subsequent overlay analyses uncover areas characterized by high accessibility but inadequate street greening, underscoring the pressing need for street greening enhancements in highly accessible zones, thereby providing valuable decision-making support for urban planners. Key findings revealed that (1) the green view index (GVI) of sampled points within the study area ranged from 15.79% to 38.17%, with notably better street greening conditions observed in the Xuanwu District; (2) the Yuhua District exhibited comparatively lower pedestrian and commuting accessibility than the Xuanwu District; and (3) approximately 139.62 km of roads in the study area demonstrated good accessibility but lacked sufficient greenery visibility, necessitating immediate improvements in their green landscapes. This research utilizes the potential of novel data and methodologies, along with their practical applications in planning and design practices. Notably, this study integrates street greenery visibility with accessibility to explore, from a human-centered perspective, the tangible benefits of green landscapes. These insights highlight the opportunity for local governments to advance urban planning and design by implementing more human-centered green space policies, ultimately promoting societal equity.

Small-scale and community-based tree nurseries have been promoted as a potential route to meeting some local or regional supply-side bottlenecks. A study in the UK used a mixed methods approach to assess the potential contribution of community tree nurseries (CTNs) to tree material supply. Semi-structured interviews (SSIs) were undertaken with 16 CTNs across the UK to generate a sector-wide characterisation of CTNs. A UK-wide online survey assessed the total number of CTNs, production methods and volumes, biosecurity practices and benefits of community involvement. Another 13 CTNs receiving support to establish and extend their operations took part in SSIs assessing their development. The results indicate that there are four broad types of CTN (Organisation- and project-based, Community-based, Enterprise and Network CTNs). A significant number of CTNs in Britain are new and establishing. The sustainability of CTNs relies in large part on grant support rather than income from tree sales. Production is almost exclusively native broadleaves and local provenances. There are policy implications concerning: i. the suitability of species being produced to future climatic and market conditions and ii. the tension around financial viability, grant dependence and CTN sustainability for those CTNs focused on social and environmental benefits rather than income generation. Identifying gaps in the provision of trees by commercial nurseries, e.g., uncommon or recalcitrant species, could be a feasible financial strategy. It is likely that financial support and skills development are likely to be required as social innovation in the community-supported tree nursery sector establishes and develops. Judging the success and impact of some types of CTNs in terms of production and finance measures may be unfair, as other social and environmental benefits may be as important and valuable. It is clear that more evaluative research is needed to quantify and better understand these kinds of outcomes and the added value they accrue.

In this study, we evaluated the biodiversity and soil multifunctionality (SMF) of degraded karst forests (scrub, SB; secondary growth forests, SG; old-growth forests, OG) in the Maolan National Nature Reserve, China, using 30 sample plots. Biodiversity and soil multifunctionality (SMF) at three trophic levels (plant–soil fauna–soil microorganisms), were assessed through vegetation surveys and soil sampling. One-way ANOVA showed that SMF increased with natural restoration, but multi-trophic level biodiversity showed different trends. Pearson’s correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between plant species diversity and SMF (p < 0.001), whereas soil fauna and soil microorganisms were negatively correlated with SMF. Structural equation modeling revealed a cascading effect of the multi-trophic level on the stimulation of the SMF during restoration. Only soil microorganisms exhibited a direct driving effect on SMF (p < 0.001), whereas plants indirectly influenced soil microorganisms through soil fauna, which subsequently affected the SMF. Although we observed the negative effects of increased plant diversity on soil fauna and soil microbial diversity in terms of quantitative relationships, the increase in soil fauna species and the evenness of soil microbial function still contributed to SMF restoration. This study revealed the cascading effects of multi-trophic diversity in promoting SMF restoration and emphasized that soil microbes are key to unraveling restoration mechanisms and processes, whereas soil fauna is an important intermediate link.

However, it remains unclear what effect renovating understory vegetation has on GHG emissions and soil C and N pools in plantations. This study investigates the impact of renovating understory vegetation on these factors in Chinese hickory (Carya cathayensis Sarg) plantation forests. Different understory renovation modes were used in a 12-month field experiment: a safflower camellia (SC) (Camellia chekiangoleosa Hu) planting density of 600 plants ha−1 and wild rape (WR) (Brassica napus L.) strip sowing (UM1); SC 600 plants ha−1 and WR scatter sowing (UM2); SC 1200 plants ha−1 and WR strip sowing (UM3); SC 1200 plants ha−1 and WR scatter sowing (UM4); and removal of the understory vegetation layer (CK). The results showed that understory vegetation modification significantly increased soil CO2 and emission fluxes and decreased soil CH4 uptake fluxes (p < 0.01). The understory vegetation transformation significantly improved soil labile carbon and labile nitrogen pools (p < 0.01). This study proposes that understory vegetation conversion can bolster soil carbon sinks, preserve soil fertility, and advance sustainable development of Chinese hickory plantation forests.

In this context, the objective of this research is: (a) to characterize biodiversity based on ecological indicators and diversity indices and (b) to evaluate carbon sequestration in different components of chakra-type agroforestry systems and secondary tropical humid forests of the Ecuadorian Amazon. For this, temporary sampling plots of 1600 m2 are established on the properties to be investigated. The study found that the structural characteristics and floristic composition vary according to the forest arrangement and the management system. Secondary forests are the most diverse, according to the Shannon (3.49), Simpson (0.96), and Margaleft (9.34) diversity indices, in addition to having the largest carbon stores with 233 (Mg C ha−1), followed by agroforestry systems in association with timber trees (TAFS) and fruit trees (FAFS) with 97.8 and 95.1 (Mg C ha−1) respectively, and cocoa monoculture (CMC) with 90.4 (Mg C ha−1). These results demonstrate the importance of conserving the remnants of tropical forests that still remain, due to the diversity of species, ecosystem services, and the total carbon they contain, as well as the agroforestry systems (AFS), systems analogous to forests, which are gradually becoming important management systems, especially if they are associated with potential species to sequester carbon, such as those documented in this and several other studies that seek solutions to global climate change.

Portable near-infrared (NIR) spectrometers have the potential for rapid and non-destructive wood species identification, and while several studies have explored related methodologies, further research on their practical application is needed. To address this research gap, this study proposes a multi-scale convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with a portable NIR spectrometer (wavelengths range: 908 to 1676 nm) for wood species identification. To enhance the capability of directly extracting robust features from NIR spectral data collected by a portable spectrometer, the Gramian angular field (GAF) method is introduced to transform 1-dimensional (1D) NIR spectral data into 2-dimensional (2D) data matrices. Furthermore, a multi-scale CNN model is utilized for direct feature extraction. The representation by 2D matrices, instead of 1D NIR spectral data, aligns with 2D convolutional operations and enables a more robust extraction of discriminative features. In the experimental phase, eight wood species were identified using the proposed method, alongside commonly used multivariate data analysis and machine learning (ML) methods. The StratifiedGroupKFold dataset partitioning approach and five-fold cross-validation were used. Additionally, nine spectral preprocessing methods were compared, and principal component analysis (PCA) was used for feature extraction in the ML method. Evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, were adopted to assess the performance of the methods. The proposed multi-scale CNN model, in combination with 2D GAF matrices of the 1D spectral data, yielded the most accurate results with a mean accuracy of 97.34% in the five-fold validation. These findings present a new approach for the construction of a rapid, non-destructive, and automatic wood species identification method using a portable NIR spectrometer.

While numerous studies have confirmed the physical and mental health benefits associated with forests, there is still a lack of quantitative understanding regarding the relationship between forest exposure and physiological health benefits (PHB). Particularly, there is insufficient knowledge about the threshold effects derived from short-term forest exposure. In this study, we propose a PHB threshold model for assessing forest exposure that introduces the concepts of efficiency threshold and benefits threshold. A pilot study was conducted in three typical natural forest sites to validate the proposed model. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was continuously measured as the physiological indicator, while meteorological, environmental, and demographic factors were simultaneously collected. The results show that: (1) the proposed PHB threshold model is applicable in a natural forest environment; (2) despite the longer time required to reach the PHB thresholds, forest exposure yielded more significant and prolonged health benefits compared to urban green spaces; (3) meteorological factors, such as temperature and relative humidity, play a crucial role in impacting the PHB threshold model; and (4) exposure to forests is better for deep thinking and relaxation than urban green spaces. These findings emphasize the potential of forests to offer a respite from the stresses of modern life and promote holistic well-being.

In this study, we quantified the yield of carbonization in the rural area of Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), and identified its determinants. By analyzing 20 kilns of professional producers in different villages, we found that these charcoal producers build large kilns, which contained an average of 46.9 ± 21.5 m3 of wood from 19 species of Miombo woodland trees, with a predominance of Julbernardia paniculata (Benth.) Troupin, alongside Brachystegia microphylla Harms and B. spiciformis Benth. The average carbonization yield was 10.2%, varying from village to village due to parameters such as kiln size, quantity of wood used, kiln coverage time, wind exposure, substrate type, and tree species. It was noted that the moisture content and dimensions of the wood did not significantly correlate with the quantity of charcoal harvested per kiln. Yield improvement should, therefore, take these parameters into account to enable charcoal producers to increase their income while adopting sustainable production practices.

Remote sensing is an effective method for large-scale and long-term VD monitoring, but it faces challenges due to changing data uncertainties caused by various factors, including observational conditions. Previous studies have demonstrated the significance of implementing proper quality control (QC) of remote sensing data for accurate vegetation monitoring. However, the impact of different QC methods on VD results (magnitude and trend) has not been thoroughly studied. The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) characterizes the energy absorption capacity of the vegetation canopy and is widely used in VD monitoring. In this study, we investigated the effect of QC methods on vegetation monitoring using a 20-year MODIS FPAR time series. The results showed several important findings. Firstly, we observed that the Mixed-QC (no QC on the algorithm path) generally produced a lower average FPAR during the growing season compared to Main-QC (only using the main algorithm). Additionally, the Mixed-QC FPAR showed a very consistent interannual trend with the Main-QC FPAR over the period 2002–2021 (p < 0.05). Finally, we found that using only the main algorithm for QC generally reduced the trend magnitude (p < 0.1), particularly in forests. These results reveal differences in FPAR values between the two QC methods. However, the interannual FPAR trends demonstrate greater consistency. In conclusion, this study offers a case study on evaluating the influence of different QC methods on VD monitoring. It suggests that while different QC methods may result in different magnitudes of vegetation dynamics, their impact on the time series trends is limited.

The BIOME-BGC model is a powerful tool for forest carbon sink estimation while the numerous parameters, as well as the localization, limit their application. This study takes three typical subtropical forests (evergreen broadleaf forest, EBF; evergreen needleleaf forest, ENF; and bamboo forest, BF) in China as examples, assesses the sensitivity of 43 ecophysiological parameters in the BIOME-BGC model both by the Morris method and the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST), and then evaluates the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) estimation accuracy based on the dataset of the fiveFi long-term carbon flux sites of those three typical forests from 2000 to 2015. The results showed that (1) both sensitivity analysis methods can effectively screen out important parameters affecting NEP simulation while the Morris method is more computationally efficient and the EFAST is better in the quantitative evaluation of sensitivity. (2) The highly sensitive parameters obtained using the two methods are basically the same; however, their importance varies across sites and vegetation types, e.g., the most sensitive parameters are k for the EBF and ENF and Ract25 for the BF, respectively. (3) The optimized parameters successfully improved the NEP simulation accuracy in subtropical forests, with average correlation coefficients increased by 25.19% and normalized root mean square error reduced by 21.74% compared with those simulated by original parameters. This study provides a theoretical basis for the optimization of process model parameters and important technical support for accurate NEP simulations of subtropical forest ecosystems.

However, it remains unclear what management strategies for providing forest ecosystem services are preferred by the residents. This study explores South Korean residents’ preferences for managing local forest ecosystem services, with a focus on how these preferences vary by forest ownership. Using the choice experiment method, this research identified residents’ willingness to pay for seven key local forest ecosystem services, along with a tax measure. The findings indicate a strong preference for biodiversity as the primary ecosystem service in both national/public and private forests, with residents willing to pay an average of KRW 28,370 (USD 21.80) per household per year and KRW 31,670 (USD 24.34) per household per year, respectively, for its enhancement. Preferences varied depending on forest ownership, with noticeable differences in perceptions of services like water supply, non-timber forest product supply, carbon storage, and recreation. Based on forest ownership, these variations in perceptions highlight the importance of managing ecosystem services in line with national/public forests and private forests, which significantly influences residents’ preferences. The study emphasizes the necessity of formulating ecosystem service management policies that account for the region’s unique natural resource characteristics, aiming to maximize ecological benefits for the local population.

The majority of the southern U.S.A. relies on tree-length merchandizing, with occasional identification and merchandizing of logs for a specific market or specific tree dimensions or qualities. Cut-to-length (CTL) merchandizing has generated more value when compared to tree-length (TL) marketing, but these comparisons have been limited to specific stands and markets (specifications and prices). The study objective was to demonstrate a process for evaluating cut-to-length and tree-length merchandizing systems in their production of gross value by applying a dynamic programming stem-level optimum bucking approach that maximizes the stem value given specific market conditions. TL merchandizing resulted in a better volume recovery for both regions, but the value recovery was better for CTL merchandizing. Observing the value recovery by diameter class, DSH classes of up to 100 mm had a similar value in both merchandizing systems, but CTL merchandizing yielded a greater or similar value per cubic meter across the range for larger tree sizes. Access to tree data and merchandizing tools needs to be addressed so wood suppliers and landowners may benefit from stem optimization and sensor technology being embedded into modern harvesters and processors.

This study investigates the influence of compound hot–dry (CHD) events on vegetation productivity in northern East Asia. Four of the most widespread CHD events occurring during the summer from 2003 to 2019 were selected as the focus of this research. We first verified the performance of the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) in the region and then conducted factor-controlled experiments using CLM5 to assess the effects of different climate factors on gross primary productivity (GPP) changes during CHD events. Our results show that vegetation productivity exhibits greater sensitivity to CHD events within the transitional climatic zone (TCZ) than in other affected areas. In grassland areas within the TCZ, precipitation deficit is the primary factor leading to the decrease in GPP (explaining 56%–90% of GPP anomalies), while high temperatures serve as a secondary detrimental factor (explaining 13%–32% of GPP anomalies). In high-latitude forests outside the TCZ, high temperature has a more significant impact on suppressing GPP, while the decrease in soil moisture has a synchronously negligible impact on GPP. There are differences in the effects of high solar radiation on grasslands and woodlands during CHD events. It was observed that high radiation benefits trees by increasing the maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax) and maximum electron transport rate (Jmax), as well as enhancing photosynthesis, but has a negligible impact on grasses. Furthermore, this study highlights the potential for compound events to impact vegetation productivity more than expected from individual events due to confounding nonlinear effects between meteorological factors. More than 10% of the negative anomalies in GPP during two CHD events in 2017 and 2010 were attributed to these nonlinear effects. These research findings are significant for understanding ecosystem responses to climate extremes and their influence on carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. They can also contribute to more precisely evaluating and predicting carbon dynamics in these regions.

The precise measurement of small-scale locust forest biomass is crucial to monitoring and evaluating the carbon sequestration functions of soil and water conservation vegetation. This study focuses on an artificial locust forest planted in the early 1990s in Caijiachuan Basin, Jixian County, Shanxi Province. A drone equipped with LiDAR was used to obtain point cloud data and generate a canopy height model. A watershed segmentation algorithm was used to identify tree vertices and extract individual trees. A relationship model between tree height, diameter at breast height, and biomass, combined with sample survey data, was established to explore the spatial distribution of biomass in the artificial locust forest at the level of the entire basin. The results show the following: (1) the structural parameters of locust extracted using UAV point cloud data have a good degree of fit and accuracy, and the recall rate is 72.7%; (2) the average error rate of the extracted maximum tree height value of locust is 7%, that of the minimum tree height value is 14%, and that of the average tree height value is 18%; (3) the average error rate of the extracted maximum diameter at breast height of locust is 15%, that of the minimum diameter at breast height is 37%, and that of the average diameter at breast height is 36%; and (4) the average error rate of the biomass estimation of locust calculated using point cloud data is 16.0%.

The growth-promoting plant hormone gibberellins (GAs) and growth-inhibiting abscisic acid (ABA) antagonistically regulate numerous processes throughout the plant life cycle. The homeostasis of GA and ABA plays a significant role in the normal growth and development of fruits, and the imbalance of them may lead to the occurrence of cracking or splitting during the process of fruit growth, development, ripening and postharvest storage. The pathways of GA and ABA metabolism and signaling have been studied widely, and the major components are well characterized, including the genes encoding major biosynthesis and catabolism enzymes and the key signaling components. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the mechanisms of GA and ABA governing fruit cracking is not comprehensive enough. In this review, we summarize the advances in understanding the effects of endogenous GAs and ABA contents in fruits and exogenous GAs and ABA treatments on fruit cracking, and we endeavor to provide some genetic cues on the function of GAs and ABA responsible for fruit cracking modulation. The progress in understanding the molecular bases underlying the actions of GAs and ABA in fruit cracking coordination control will facilitate breeding strategies of cracking-resistant ideotypes of fruits, and also carry great theoretical significance in guiding the establishment of integrated prevention and control measures in fruit cracking.

This assessment will facilitate research on carbon neutrality and promote regional ecological protection and development. This study utilized the “One Map” data of forest resources (2020) and the first year (2017) of the establishment of the national park in Wuyi Mountain National Park (WMNP). The continuous biomass expansion factor method, in conjunction with the vegetation carbon content coefficient, was employed to estimate the forest carbon storage within the park’s forested areas. Subsequently, the distribution of forest carbon storage was analyzed using remote sensing estimation methods, and a comparison was made between the forest carbon storage of these two years. Finally, correlation analysis and path analysis were conducted to identify the primary factors influencing forest carbon storage. The study findings reveal that in 2020, the total carbon storage in forests reached 4.851 × 106 t C, with an average carbon density of 49.55 t C·hm−2. Furthermore, the study identified positive correlations between dominant tree species, age groups, and elevation with carbon storage, whereas slope length and aspect were found to have negative correlations. Dominant tree species were observed to have the greatest impact on forest carbon storage in both 2017 and 2020, followed by age groups. These findings offer valuable scientific insights for the implementation of forest carbon storage pilot projects in WMNP.

In Sweden, forestry contractors have an important role in developing and maintaining a good working environment for the employed forestry workers. The objectives of this study were to describe forestry contractors’ current practices regarding occupational safety and health (OSH) management and identify variations in relation to the contractors’ characteristics and finances, as well as to highlight areas that need improvement. In 2023, data were collected through a survey distributed to 1200 limited liability companies registered to perform logging or silvicultural services, with a response rate of 22%. Multi- and univariate analyses were performed to compare contractor groups, and the results show that larger companies had more well-developed and formalized routines and guidelines for their operations. Geographical differences were also identified; for example, employees in the north were more likely to have access to staff facilities when working in the forest. However, no clear connection between OSH management practices and the contractors’ finances could be demonstrated. The study concludes that there is a need for improvements in OSH work within the industry because many companies do not meet all of the formal requirements that exist today.
