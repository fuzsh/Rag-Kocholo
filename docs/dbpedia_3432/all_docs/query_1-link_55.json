I've read that the screenwriter hoped to get Bunuel to direct it; I'm surprised anybody recognized Bunuel as a prestige figure in 1952, and I wonder what the writer thought he had here that was worthy of L.B.'s attention...\n\n... but now I understand that drawn-out scene where Roberto Ca√±edo helps Lilia Prado take off her shoes and stockings, and that whole subplot involving a pair of Prado's shoes... yep, makes perfect sense now.\n\nPS: Film #4000, give or take X number of titles I don't remember. Yippee."
