        "text": "The Brooklyn Academy of Music continues its winter season with Robert Lepage’s solo show 887, written by and starring the acclaimed French Canadian artist. 887 is coined after Lepage’s childhood home—887 Murray Ave., Quebec City, Canada—and shares personal experiences from his youth.\n\nThe U.S. premiere of 887 will run March 16–26 at BAM's Harvey Theater, located at 651 Fulton Street, Brooklyn.\n\nInspired by his inability to memorize a poem, Lepage explores the vastness and realm of memory.\n\n“As Lepage revisits his childhood home and other brilliantly reconstructed spaces—from the front seat of his cabdriver father’s taxi to his own ultramodern present-day flat—the questions multiply,” read production notes for the show. “Why do we remember the phone number from our youth yet forget our current one? How does a childhood song withstand the test of time while the name of a loved one escapes us? And how is theatre—an art based in part on the act of recollection—still relevant in a digital age where megabytes take the place of memory?”\n\nLepage has built an innovative reputation through his work as a director, scenic artist, playwright, actor, and film director.\n\nThe English translation is by Louisa Blair, and dramaturgy is by Peder Bjurman. Félix Fradet-Faguy is the image designer, Jean-Sébastien Côté is the music and sound designer, and Laurent Routhier is the lighting designer. Steve Blanchet serves as the creative director and designer.\n\nFor more information visit BAM.org or call BAM Ticket Services at (718) 636-4100."
