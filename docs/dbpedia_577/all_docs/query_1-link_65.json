        "text": "887\n\nUntil Feb. 21 | SFU Goldcorp Centre for the Arts\n\nTickets & Info: SFU.ca\n\nFrench Canadian theatre legend Robert Lepage’s newest production, which saw its western Canadian premier Thursday evening at the SFU Woodward’s Goldcorp Centre for the Arts, is an engrossing and technically stunning exploration of the intersections between biography and history.\n\nThe one-man show begins with a memory challenge. For a live event in 2010 Lepage was asked to memorize Speak White by Michéle Lalonde, a three-page prose poem about English-Canadian racism that weaves between languages and cultural references without even rhyme to help anchor the speaker. So he decides to use an ancient mnemonic technique called a “memory palace” to help him with the project, and the show grows from that process.\n\nGrowing up as a working class French kid in Quebec City, Lepage’s memories fit better into an apartment building than a palace. The show takes its name from his childhood home in the walk-up at 887 Rue Murray, a working class neighbourhood between Parc Des Brave and the Planes D’Abraham, both integral places to early Canadian history.\n\nUsing a variety of digital and physical effects centred on a miniature reconstruction of the building and its interiors, the show circulates through Lepage’s memories of growing up in Quebec City in the 1960s and 70s when the separatist movement was boiling toward the October Crisis. However, the central focus is more on issues of class than language — the French/English divide being ultimately a divide between poor and rich.\n\nThere is a terrific tension between the Lepage family’s three-bedroom apartment that housed seven people and the scenes of adult Lepage in his posh Montreal flat, contemplating the organization of his personal library.\n\nThe show plums a little of the same territory as Rick Miller’s PuSh Festival entry, Boom, which was developed with Lepage’s Ex Machina theatre company. But where Miller used his family’s story as a cypher for the vast cultural shifts of the era, turning the evening into a rather surface-level history lesson, Lepage revels in the intimacy of unique and specific detail. It’s through this individual story that we are able to go beyond the names and dates important to an era integral to the growth of our nation.\n\nLepage expertly balances the memoir with the historical context, allowing short meditations on the Seven Years War or French president Charles de Gaulle’s 1967 visit to Quebec to push the narrative along rather than overwhelm it. Ultimately, the emotional core of the show remains Lepage’s father, a breathtakingly hansom veteran whose lack of education and large family chained him to a life of driving taxi at night. For the most part, Lepage remains a composed presence, moving at an unhurried pace from one set piece to the next.\n\nLike much of Lepage’s work, 887 is as much an art installation as it is a play. In a particular bit of stage magic, the smartphone Lepage uses to control certain effects is deftly integrated into the plot, a thematic component rather than a simple tool as is so often the case in multimedia shows.\n\nThere are a couple of flaws despite the technical excellence. There are a couple of scenes the middle of the almost two-hour run that feel a bit baggy and less fully integrated into the whole. Most of the narration is in English, but during the French scenes, the sur-titles are quite low contrast, making it tough to follow if you’re rusty in the language department. And certainly to get the full effect of some of the miniatures, it would be helpful to sit closer to the stage.\n\nBut over all, the work moves with grace toward his stunning reading of Lalonde’s poem, which is as powerful and resonant a statement about injustice today as it was more than 40 years ago."
