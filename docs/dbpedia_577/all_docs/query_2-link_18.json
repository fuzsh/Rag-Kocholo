        "text": "The Gould Standard welcomes Robert Lepage, the 10th Laureate of the Glenn Gould Prize, for a provocative and illuminating dialogue on his trailblazing career as an actor, director, playwright, and stage director. Drawing from his Québecois roots, Lepage reflects on how his background has shaped his artistic sensibility, from grand productions like Wagner’s Ring Cycle at the Metropolitan Opera in New York to the intimate exploration of memory in his stage work “887.” His dedication to pushing his art to the limit of the possible and beyond, while maintaining a deep connection to both personal and universal themes, underscores his belief in art as a transformative experience that transcends conventional boundaries.\n\nROBERT LEPAGE\n\nOfficial Website\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nX\n\nIMDb\n\nTHE GLENN GOULD FOUNDATION"
