        "text": "Born: December 12, 1957 in Quebec City, Canada\n\nNationality: French Canadian\n\nOccupation: Playwright, actor, film director, and stage director\n\nVersatile in every form of theatre craft, Robert Lepage is equally talented as a director, playwright, actor and film director. His creative and original approach to theatre has won him international acclaim and shaken the dogma of classical stage direction to its foundations, especially through his use of new technologies. Contemporary history is his source of inspiration, and his modern and unusual work transcends all boundaries.\n\nRobert Lepage 2015, accessed 15 June 2017, http://lacaserne.net/index2.php/robertlepage/\n\nRobert Lepage [Image]. http://www.japantimes.co.jp\n\nPlaywright, actor and director Robert Lepage tells innovative stories on film and on stage. His multidisciplinary production company, Ex Machina, is a big part of that innovation. Listen to him speak about that unique process and his love of \"creating outside of the frame.\" Robert Lepage was at The Banff Centre in 2014."
