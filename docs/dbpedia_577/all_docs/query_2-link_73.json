        "text": "Le Dragon Bleu is result of a creative collaboration of Robert Lepage (winner of the 2007 Europe Theatre Prize) and Marie Michaud (co-author of The Dragons’ Trilogy). The show is performed by Lepage, Michaud, and dancer Tai Wei Foo. Le Dragon Bleu bears all the hallmarks of Lepage’s original, brilliant, and highly visual style, but it hinges upon the one inexhaustible resource the theatre possesses: the audience’s intelligence and imagination.\n\nVYV Credits: PHOTON server, used for all video projections and interactivity."
