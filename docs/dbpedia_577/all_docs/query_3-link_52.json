        "text": "Award-winning director Robert Lepage has broken his silence over a decision by the Montreal International Jazz Festival to shut down his controversial production SLĀV after just three performances, saying the move was a “direct blow to artistic freedom.”\n\nHours after his statement was released, the Parti Québécois threw its support behind Lepage, with leader Jean-François Lisée likening the cancellation to censorship and MNA Maka Kotto describing it as “intellectual terrorism.”\n\nPQ MNA Pascal Bérubé called on Quebec Culture Minister Marie Montpetit to take a stand, saying the shuttering of the show sets “a precedent that will leave its mark on creators and artists.”\n\nFriday afternoon, Montpetit weighed in, calling on Lepage and festival officials to begin a “dialogue to better understand each other.”\n\n“Freedom of expression and creation are fundamental elements in our society and should always be protected,” she tweeted. “However, we can’t control or judge the way people feel.”\n\nThe production, which features songs composed by slave cultures including black slaves in the United States, was criticized for having a mostly white cast and a white director. Protesters accused the show of appropriation of black culture.\n\nIn a release posted on his theatre company’s Facebook page, Lepage said he, show creator Betty Bonifassi, her singers and Ex Machina, his theatre company, “were aware from the beginning of the project that we were taking on a sensitive subject and that it was our responsibility to work to create this show with diligence, respect, honesty and integrity.”\n\nThe statement goes on: “My team and I felt that, in the overcharged atmosphere created by our show, it would be wiser to remain silent since any statement we might make would throw oil on the fire.”\n\nHowever, Lepage wrote, “now that SLĀV has been officially muzzled, we have to use another way to communicate.”\n\nLepage wrote that he didn’t want to enter into the debate over cultural appropriation “for it is an extremely complicated problem, and I don’t pretend to know how to solve it.”\n\nHowever, he said he finds the debate over the show on the street and in some media to be “appalling” and the decision to shut the show “a direct blow to artistic freedom.”\n\nThat assessment was echoed by Lisée, who took to Twitter to say that while he supported increasing diversity in culture, he opposed the “muzzling and censoring of art.”\n\nKotto, who is black, wrote on his Twitter account that “we are faced with a case of intellectual terrorism. (A) totalitarian move to be denounced out of hand that our freedom of artistic creation be preserved.”\n\nIn his statement, Lepage argued that “theatre has been based on a very simple principle, that of playing someone else. Pretending to be someone else. Stepping into the shoes of another person to try to understand them and, in the process, perhaps understand ourselves, better. This ancient ritual requires that we borrow, for the duration of a performance, someone else’s look, voice, accent and, at times, even gender.\n\n“But when we are no longer allowed to step into someone else’s shoes, when it is forbidden to identify with someone else, theatre is denied its very nature; it is prevented from performing its primary function and is thus rendered meaningless.\n\n“Over the course of my career, I have devoted entire shows denouncing injustices done throughout history to specific cultural groups, without actors from said groups. These shows have been performed all over the world, in front of very diverse audiences, without anyone accusing me of cultural appropriation, let alone of racism. Quite the contrary. These projects have always been very well received and have contributed to make Ex Machina one of the most respected theatre companies in the world.”\n\nLepage acknowledged that “any new show comes with its share of blunders, misfires and bad choices. But unlike a number of other art forms, theatre is not fixed. It’s a living art form that allows a play to grow and evolve constantly, to be perpetually rewritten according to audience reactions, and to be fine-tuned show after show.\n\n“This evolution was never to happen for SLĀV since the run was cancelled after only three performances. If it were up to me, the show would still be running, for I will always demand the right for theatre to talk about anything and anyone. Without exception. None.”"
