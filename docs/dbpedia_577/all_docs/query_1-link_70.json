        "text": "Storytelling is such an essential tool in career success. Whether you’re networking, interviewing for a job, building your personal brand or promoting your business/non-profit, you are sharing a story. People connect with stories and engage more when they relate. It really is a skill that everyone should learn early and fine tune throughout their life. So glad to see young, talented people getting out there and setting themselves up for success. These are our future leaders.\n\nWhat part can opera play in a conversation on #climate & #health for Louisville’s business community? #Arts can open hearts and minds. Open hearts and minds can change the world. 1) The arts are not merely entertainment, designed to make us feel good. Rather, arts exist to cause us to FEEL. And to THINK. 2) When we Feel and Think in community with others, we can be drawn out of our focus on self. We then redirect our focus on others — our neighbors — and develop empathy and compassion. 3) With compassion, we are called to stewardship of others and the world we share and are responsible for. Not because we’re told to (or fined if we don’t), but because it is the right thing to do. What an honor to participate in this important discussion moderated by Dr. Wayne Tuckson. My fellow panelists — Dr. Aruni Batnagar, Sumedha Rao, Dr. Kim Allan Williams, Sr. — had so many wonderful things to share about their work.\n\nMS: That's the danger of today too... TC: Because there's an answer to everything? MS: There's an answer. There is, understandably, a sensitivity; which has to be balanced with art somehow. Because the Art should be free. A fascinating interview with the master Martin Scorsese. How do we apply his philosophies in musical theatre education: The importance of developing a young adult's artistry within MT story telling? Directing their actions (dancing, singing, acting) in order to help a student's own understanding of themselves and the characters they portray, in order to bring their artistry to the foreground? (With some great anecdotes about NYC too!) Worth having a watch.\n\nWith a frightening lack of focus on the importance of an arts education the consequences will hit us for decades. Government policy needs to move swiftly and distinctly to support creative education in schools, colleges and Universities as a matter of urgency. This is not just about having ‘stories’ to tell. It is about nurturing and recognising the importance of these creative skills in business and corporate environments too. We need smart people in positions of authority and power - in all organisations. Time for change.\n\nTake the empty space. #wednesdaywisdom Call it whitespace, a gap or opening, call it a margin. Whatever you call it… it is opportunity. I read Peter Brook’s THE EMPTY SPACE a few times. Published in 1968, it’s still a great book today, particularly if you are in the performing arts. Highly recommend. If you aren’t involved in theatre it may not be worth the read; but you can certainly gain inspiration by some of its concepts. Particularly this theory by Brook: “A stage space has two rules: (1) Anything can happen and (2) Something must happen.” SOMETHING MUST HAPPEN The inevitability of “the empty space” being filled in some way provokes us to ask ourselves: “How am I going to SHAPE it?” When we start to look at CREATING as SHAPING, we have inertia on our side and our task can be less daunting. Anything can and something must happen with our: Salesforce pipeline Property branding Recruiting efforts LinkedIn content Tradeshow hours Discovery calls Google slide deck Lease renewal letters Podcast recordings Salesloft campaign Property design and blueprint It WILL happen. How are we SHAPING what happens? What empty spaces are YOU claiming? Take the stage, my friends! #motivation #multifamily #sales #theatre\n\nHave you ever experienced a Chinese opera? Recently, Sarah and I stumbled upon an ancient Wind God festival at Tainan, Taiwan. It was Sarah’s first time attending, and we decided to immerse ourselves in this unique celebration. Chinese operas are captivating performances that blend dance, song, and martial arts. They often narrate popular stories, drawing the audience into a world of tradition and artistry. Interestingly, storytelling plays a crucial role in sales as well. When presenting solutions to clients, how you convey your message matters. Crafting a narrative that resonates with their struggles and demonstrates how your solutions can address their needs builds trust and understanding."
