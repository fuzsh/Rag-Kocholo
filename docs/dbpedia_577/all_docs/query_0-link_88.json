        "text": "Renowned director, creator and performer Robert LePage of Ex Machina was in the audience this weekend for the closing night of Sylvain Émard Danse’s performance of Fragments – Volume I at the Firehall. M. LePage first visited the Firehall in 1984-85 Season with his award-winning production Circulations, which was at the beginning of his amazing career and the beginning of his love affair with Vancouver.\n\nHe returns to Vancouver regularly and always visits the Firehall to check out what is happening when he is in town. M. Page was last seen on stage in Vancouver in his remarkable Blue Dragon, part of the Cultural Olympiad in 2010.\n\nIn 1984, Robert LePage joined host Peter Gzowski on the CBC Radio show Morningside to discuss the unique method behind Circulations.
