Many defended SLĀV by citing the importance of better understanding the past in order to comprehend the world around us. While there is certainly merit to this argument, it is undone when artists fail to involve the communities from which these histories are drawn.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nOpinion: Robert Lepage's Kanata and SLĀV have the same major flaws Back to video\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nThere with you then.

The play tells the story of Marie-Josèphe Angélique, an enslaved woman executed in 1734 for allegedly setting a fire that ravaged Old Montreal. Despite the historical significance of this story, Marie-Josèphe is barely a footnote in mainstream history books and few remember her name.\n\nEven as the debate over SLĀV continues, another Lepage-centred controversy is brewing. His upcoming production of Kanata, a retelling of Canadian history through “the prism of relations between whites and natives,” faces growing scrutiny. Though Lepage did finally sit down with Indigenous artists to discuss the project this week, one wonders why it took an open letter signed by several prominent Indigenous artists for the meeting to take place. The furore over SLĀV should have been enough for Lepage and his colleagues to press pause on yet another project about certain communities without those communities’ explicit participation.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nCanada frames its narrative as being a welcoming and inclusive nation, that the paradigm of a giant melting pot of cultures where all are accepted stands in sharp contrast to the bigotry and xenophobia of our southern neighbour. In reality, the parallels are far greater than most Canadians are willing to admit.\n\nAdditionally, although Canada puts itself on a pedestal of intercultural excellence, the diverse voices, faces and stories of the people that make up this country are marginally represented on its screens and stages. Lepage’s artistic “colour-blindness” is rooted in white privilege and illustrates how he and others are woefully unaware of the colonial lens that encourages white artists to claim Indigenous and racialized stories as their own.\n\nIt is all the more frustrating that in those rare moments when such stories receive the funding and platform necessary for popular consumption, artists from these communities are absent from the creative process. Not only does this erasure impoverish these artists, it ultimately weakens the stories being told.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn Angélique, the playwright shed light on Canada’s seldom-discussed history of slavery and delved into the enslavement of Indigenous people. Two-thirds of the slaves in the colony of New France were, in fact, Indigenous. It would have been unconscionable to cast a white actress in the role of Manon, the Indigenous Panis who befriended the titular character in the play.\n\nLepage, as one of the most powerful theatre creators in the world, should have leveraged his clout to ensure Indigenous artists were integral to every facet of Kanata. It is his privilege and responsibility to make space for Indigenous creators on the subject of the colonization of Indigenous lands and peoples in what became Canada. Our communities and our ancestors did not survive this long only to be excluded from telling our own stories.\n\nQuincy Armorer is artistic director of Black Theatre Workshop. Mathieu Murphy-Perron is the artistic producer of Tableau D’Hôte Theatre. PJ Prudat is a Métis actor and writer who performs in the upcoming production of Angélique, which tours Ontario in 2019. The French translation will be presented at a staged reading at Centre du Théâtre d’Aujourd’hui in December.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nSLĀV: political correctness or cultural appropriation?
