Ticket holders were invited to get their money back and watch the Saturday afternoon performance for free.\n\nFour years in the making, workshops in New York, Vancouver, Quebec City, and still not ready? Some things never change, including Lepage’s down-to-the-wire method.

It’s also exquisitely beautiful, comical, lyrical, and brimming with empathy for the human misery it shoves in your face. Most assuredly, it’s preview-level work, and will remain unchanged through the end of the Paris run on Feb. 17. Maybe forever, unless Lepage finds the time and resources to continue, which surely this work deserves.\n\nWhen it was over, my immediate reaction was to join the standing ovation. Not because it is the final word on a subject that will leave any Canadian sick with shame, nor because it is a clear, coherent theatrical work. Nada. Kanata — Épisode I has miles to go before it soars. It’s confused and confusing, sometimes embarrassing. But it’s also a brave lunge at several important discussions that, as citizens and artists, we need to have.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nKanata’s public life began with a firestorm set last summer by an open letter in Le Devoir, signed by Indigenous artists, criticizing the absence of First Nations artists in a work focusing on their story. A five-hour meeting was held between Mnouchkine and Lepage and signatories in Montreal. Important partners withdrew. Plans for an international tour were cancelled. Then Mnouchkine and Lepage announced Kanata would go ahead in Paris, as part of the Festival d’automne, despite an extremely reduced budget (Lepage working for free) and only 3 1/2 weeks of rehearsal.\n\nThe result, Épisode I, carries the debate onstage, telling the story of artists drawn into the maelstrom of real-life events, grappling with how to respond in their work.\n\nThe opening scenes unfold like a dream. Flanked by a forest of perfectly cylindrical pillars, a man and a woman — museum curators — discuss the merits of 19th-century paintings of Indigenous people by European artists, then disappear into fog. Enter a drifting canoe paddled by a First Nations filmmaker capturing wilderness sounds on tape. A black bear ambles across the stage, two Mounties pass in ceremonial red jackets, the idyll broken suddenly by roaring chainsaws as a swarm of loggers reduce the woods to bare stage. A totem pole is wrecked. Mounties drag an Indigenous woman off screaming, and hand her baby to a priest.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFlash forward to Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside, 2000, where a young French couple, a painter and an actor, rent a loft from an Asian woman who owns the building. Their names plucked from Shakespeare’s Tempest, Miranda and Ferdinand are the archetypal gushing lovers in a strange new land.\n\nThere the dream ends, and a documentary nightmare begins, dissecting the daily tragedy of Canada’s Indigenous peoples at the dismal end of a wide spectrum: missing women found murdered, junkies desperate for the next fix, social workers and police burdened with inadequate resources, paralyzed by power wrangles. We’re taken to Robert Pickton’s pig farm, made to watch as he snaps handcuffs on a young Indigenous woman, drags her into his caravan, splashes her blood on the window. We follow the actor playing Pickton via film into a jail cell, where an actor posing as a fellow killer goads him into confession.\n\nMeanwhile, the French characters struggle with painter’s block, actor’s woes. These parallel stories grate, amuse, appall and intersect, sometimes with jarring effect. Ultimately, bleak reality overwhelms the artists’ journey. Ferdinand fails to find his place in “Hollywood North.” The couple argue and break up, leaving Miranda to paint portraits of the women Pickton killed — artwork that their grieving mothers can’t accept.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe ending is Miranda’s artistic breakthrough: a wild abstract painting binge on the fourth wall, while in her dreams the dead and the grief-stricken are happily reunited. In life, there is no meeting of minds and hearts. Art on trial pleads guilty.\n\nI had expected Lepage would revisit the story of English actor Edmund Kean’s 1826 encounter with the Huron-Wyandots of Lorette. We co-wrote a play on that theme, called Alanienouidet, which he directed at Ottawa’s National Arts Centre in 1992. (I’d learned of the historical incident from a column by Edgar Andrew Collard in the Montreal Gazette.) Wyandot actor and director Yves Sioui Durand worked as research consultant and performed the role of Yellow Wolf. Other Indigenous roles were played by non-Indigenous actors … speaking Mohawk.\n\nI returned to the material for my play Venus of Dublin (presented at Centaur Theatre in 2000), focusing on Kean’s memory of the event, and the importance of the identity bestowed by his being welcomed into the Wyandot tribe.\n\nWhen I spoke with Lepage backstage after Saturday’s performance, he said the Kean story was to have featured in other episodes of Kanata. Originally, the Vancouver material was Part 3, but he lacked the budget for rehearsals and period costumes. Reaction to this scaled-down work will determine whether the trilogy has a future.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAs for the absence of Indigenous involvement, that debate also continues. Two signatories to the letter in Le Devoir were on hand for the first performance: Abenaki filmmaker Kim O’Bomsawin and Innu writer Maya Cousineau Mollen, brought over by the association Décoloniser les arts.\n\n“It’s not a question of the actors — the cast could remain the same,” O’Bomsawin said. “But having an (Indigenous) co-writer or co-director could have avoided the feeling of inauthenticity. A vision from the inside would have allowed the team to go deeper, avoid stereotypes.”\n\nCousineau Mollen agreed. “Unfortunately, Ariane Mnouchkine and Robert Lepage missed a great opportunity to work with us. That’s what I find sad.”\n\nAh, but with Lepage, to date, there are no fatal mistakes — only first drafts.\n\nKanata — Épisode I: La Controverse continues at Théâtre du Soleil until Feb. 17.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nDunlevy: Post-SLAV and Kanata, let's talk about cultural appropriation\n\nLisée lauds 'victory' for controversial play Kanata\n\nControversy drowned out Lepage's goodwill: Kanata co-author\n\nKanata cancellation: Théâtre du Soleil decries 'unimaginable intimidation'\n\nDunlevy: Kanata cancellation is right result, wrong reason\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
