        "text": "Robert Lepage's production of La Casa Azul, by Sophie Faucher, opens at the Lyric, Hammersmith, on Oct. 15.\n\nInspired by the writings of Frida Kahlo and translated by the Lyric's artistic director Neil Bartlett, the play shows a dying woman (Kahlo) reassembling the images of her extraordinary life as one of Mexico's foremost painters.\n\nPlaywright Sophie Faucher plays Frida Kahlo in this tribute to a great artist and her tempestuous life, and it is also a tribute to Faucher's writing that she has attracted a director of Robert Lepage's international standing.\n\nLa Casa Azul runs through Oct. 26."
