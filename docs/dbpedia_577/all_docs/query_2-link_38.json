        "text": "Robert Lepage stepped forward at the Royal National Theater's Lyttelton auditorium for his third curtain call following \"Needles and Opium\" one recent evening and, suddenly, this most assured of performers seemed uncertain how to respond. The Quebecois actor-writer-director turned up his palms and gave a slight, very Gallic shrug, as if to ask, \"Who's all this attention for -- moi?\"\n\nThe question by now is largely rhetorical in England. Mr. Lepage has built a sizable following there since his 1987 debut with his solo performance piece \"Vinci\" and \"The Dragons' Trilogy,\" his six-hour multicultural epic. Other Lepage pieces have come here -- \"Polygraph\" (1989), a disturbing film noir pastiche, and the dense, imagistic \"Tectonic Plates\" (1990). This year there is \"Needles and Opium,\" which arrives on Tuesday for five performances at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and his controversial staging of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" set in a mud bath, now at the Royal National Theater.\n\nIn his native Canada, Mr. Lepage is regarded as one of the country's most progressive theater artists, acclaimed for his work with the Theatre Repere de Quebec and also with the National Arts Center in Ottawa, where he is artistic director of French theater. On the Continent, he's a regular on the festival circuit from Barcelona to Florence. As a film actor he's remembered as Pontius Pilate in \"Jesus of Montreal.\"\n\nNew Yorkers have a more truncated version of his career -- only \"Polygraph\" and \"The Dragons' Trilogy\" have been presented there -- but that situation should be rectified at least in part this winter. Following \"Needles and Opium,\" in which he is the solo performer, he returns to BAM in February to direct a Canadian Opera Company double bill of Bartok's \"Bluebeard's Castle\" and Schoenberg's \"Erwartung.\"\n\nWhere, then, to place Mr. Lepage artistically? The question itself gave him pause. In Britain, he is likened most often to the Paris-based British director Peter Brook (and it's no accident that Mr. Lepage's \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" caused the greatest local stir since that of Mr. Brook's for the Royal Shakespeare Company 22 years ago).\n\n\"I'm a follower of people not necessarily connected with the theater,\" Mr. Lepage said. At 34, he is more boyish-looking than he appears on stage, his aspect softened by a noticeable absence of facial hair. \"For me,\" he added, \"theater will always be very, very much alive, but not necessarily in the theatrical tradition.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
