As you know from reading my many posts here, I think Lepage is one of the most brilliant artists working in live performance today. So, I entered the contest, but figuring (like most contests) that I wouldn't win, and I bought tickets. And then, I won!\n\nSo now I have two tickets for sale (at my cost, of course-face price+Ripoffmaster service fees). If you want them, please contact me using the contact me link on the right side of this page.\n\nI really know nothing about this show, but given Lepage's involvement I wanted to see it. He has yet to dissapoint me.\n\nUpdate\n\non 2009-06-14 23:29 by controlgeek\n\nWriteup on the show here."
