        "text": "Forty years into his career, Robert Lepage remains Québec and Canada’s best-known stage director, whose touring productions were headline events in British and other international theatres in the 1980s, ‘90s and into the 2000s.\n\nIn 2020 Manchester University Press published my monograph Robert Lepage’s Original Stage Productions: Making Theatre Global, one of a number of book-length studies that have appeared in recent years treating Lepage’s direction of existing plays and operas as well as his group and solo devised work. A reappraisal is therefore underway of Lepage’s significance and influence, even as his domestic reputation was shaken by two high-profile controversies around cultural appropriation in the summer of 2018.\n\nIn this talk I will attempt to place Lepage into broader currents of international theatre practice; discuss the methods and methodology that I and other Lepage scholars use to study his work; and review the 2018 controversies and their impact."
