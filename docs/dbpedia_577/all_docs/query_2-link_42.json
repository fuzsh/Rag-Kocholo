        "text": "“I wouldn’t be happy to be a specialist.” Robert Lepage is considering the idea of choosing one artform – or even general area of interest – above all others. And rapidly discarding it: “There are some very interesting artists in history who refused to be nailed down into a category: like Da Vinci or Jean Cocteau. You could say Cocteau was a great poet, but also a film-maker, interested in theatre, sculpture, and could never identify with any of these forms exclusively.”\n\nLepage, Canada’s most prominent theatre artist, and certainly one one of its most ubiquitous – in the last few months his productions have played in New York, Toronto, Montreal, Tbilisi, Tallin, Wellington and now Adelaide – identifies more with these polymaths, interested as much in art as in science or medicine.\n\nHis eclectic creations resemble avant garde movies perhaps more than they do theatre. He is often compared to Federico Fellini, with whom he shares an extravagant visual sense, very private thematic obsessions, and an extremely democratic imagery, that combines the hermetic and the mundane with a deeply autobiographical logic.\n\n“Without meaning to sound crass,” Lepage laughs, “I’ve never had any psychological ... help. It’s because I feel my work is so revealing about who I am, and what I am trying to understand about myself. It’s a therapeutic process.”\n\nThis process also results in work that has an accessibility and extraordinary reach – after playing in Adelaide, he is off to Macau in May. In part, that may be a result of a universally appealing style that has been consciously considered. When Lepage started out as an artist in bilingual Canada, he decided early to develop shows that could overcome linguistic barriers. The two cornerstones of his approach became traditional storytelling and extraordinary visuals, freely mixing a variety of media into dramatic stage images.\n\nNeedles & Opium, the work Lepage is bringing to the Adelaide festival, is a reworking of one of his early shows, which cemented his reputation when it premiered in 1991. It connects the lives of Miles Davis and Jean Cocteau with a third, Lepage-like character, going through a break-up while in a hotel room in Paris. “It’s basically about dependence in many aspects: opium, alcohol, love. Addiction often tries to fill a hole. I’m playing with three characters who have experienced loss.”\n\nHe refers to the work as a ‘break-up story’. “If you’re going to do a show about somebody who dumped you, it’s much richer if you have three characters dealing with different aspects of that theme. There is more space for people to identify with it.”\n\nLepage believes that young artists often bump into important and interesting themes early in their career, when they are not fully prepared to deal with them artistically. “I felt there were many unturned stones, many things left unsaid, because I didn’t have the experience, the maturity, to fully understand them.”\n\nBut the other important impetus in returning to Needles & Opium was to rework the design into something more three-dimensional. The original work had a single performer standing in front of a screen. Now, Lepage believes, the work is simply more fleshed out: “We have more performers, more scenes. It’s more sensuous, more three-dimensional, the scenography is more fleshed out, the story more developed.”\n\n“More, more, more” may be something of a Lepage motto. His shows are famous for their multiple storylines, large casts, huge sets, and technical overload. He devises work through improvisation, a process which can backfire – most infamously at the 1994 Edinburgh premiere of The Seven Streams of The River Ota, which overran by two hours. Lipsynch, a show about the human voice, premiered as a 5-hour production in 2007, but was 9 hours long by the time it performed at the Sydney Festival in 2009.Then there were the steel reinforcements that The Met had to install to support his 45-tonne stage for Wagner’s Ring cycle, reportedly at an additional cost of about $16 million.\n\nIn between, Lepage has also found time to write an entire show for Cirque du Soleil. Most improbably, on the day that we speak, he has been researching Marquis de Sade for the one-man show he is preparing. “I’ve been doing some very odd readings!” he laughs, and launches into a discussion of Sade as a political philosopher. “He was preoccupied with the issue of faith and existentialism way before the 1950s. He was very ahead of his time, which is probably why Napoleon wanted him interned.”\n\nThere is something dizzying about the range of preoccupations and interests Lepage juggles simultaneously, both in his life and within specific artworks – themes that sometimes do feel amassed rather than carefully assembled. Lepage believes that they are all interconnected, however, by the overall autobiographical drive of his work; the underlying attempt to understand oneself. He speaks of creating a cosmos of linked pieces: “Seeing it this way makes everything much easier: you don’t feel propelled from one project to another, having to change the floppy disk each time.”\n\nAnd yet this gleeful maximalism, even at its most bewilderingly unrestrained, always seems to come from an ultimately humble place. Lepage’s vision of theatre is simply as a gathering place for telling stories: “I think theatre must be an event, an experience, not compete with cinema. When people are able to download stories on Netflix, you need to give them a good reason to jump into the car and drive two hours. It has to be something you can only see in the theatre, and it has to be worth it.”"
