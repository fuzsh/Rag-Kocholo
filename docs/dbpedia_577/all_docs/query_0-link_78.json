        "text": "Pages 14 and 15 of the official Courville playbill in front of the Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts Lyric Theater. Photo: Estelle Su/Shroffed\n\nAfter performing his hit solo play 887 at the 47th Hong Kong Arts Festival in 2019, Robert LePage returns to the 52nd Hong Kong Arts Festival with Courville, a semi-autobiographical play exploring themes not unlike those found in 887.\n\nThe play is a part of the month-long 52nd Hong Kong Arts Festival, which features a variety of performances including musicals, operas, dance performances, and theatre productions from local and international artists.\n\nThis festival draws people from many backgrounds, though Courville is recommended for ages 14 and up. Some primarily speak Cantonese, others Mandarin and/or English. Luckily, all of the theater staff are able to communicate in all three languages when it comes to assisting people getting their tickets and finding their seats.\n\nPeople waiting outside the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts Lyric Theatre for the doors to open.

Underneath lies caverns, threatening the integrity of the soil. In its immediate vicinity is Montmorency Falls, one of the tallest waterfalls in North America.\n\nPage 20 from the official Courville playbill.

The river rapids open the audience to the impending unrest and uncertainties approaching Simon.\n\nSimon’s father has just passed, and his shifty uncle now provides for him and his mother. Sophie has her own personal life issues and Simon is bullied at school for the unfortunate scar on his chest all while he grapples with his sexuality. Mainly residing in his basement with occasional visits from bats, Simon finds ways to cope with his rocky mental state through friends, drugs, and love.\n\nPage 19 of the official Courville playbill.

Montreal prepares for the 1976 Summer Olympics while Toronto rushes to finish the CN Tower, the tallest building in the world at the time. Sovereignty movements in French-speaking Quebec shake English-speaking Canada. The 1976 Quebec general election is on everyone’s minds.\n\nThrough the masterful use of a double-layered platform, projector, and scenic drops, Courville smoothly transitions between various locations, presenting like a mesmerizing movie montage. In some instances, the projector visuals, music, and puppet movements work together to resemble a retro point-and-click story-based adventure video game. This element of nostalgia combined with 1970s vinyl music, and a Twin Peaks-esque soundtrack helps transport the audience back in time with young Simon living in suburbia.\n\nOlivier Normand, the performer who plays adult Simon and voices all the characters, distinctly changes his voice between characters, giving each puppet a voice of their own all the while still appearing from Simon’s point of view. At times, he even speaks to the puppets in place of his younger self, heightening the emotional significance certain interactions had on his life.\n\n“I think the execution of the puppets was really well done,” stated 20-year-old university student Lilia Su. “It emphasized how this was a story told from one perspective. How it was just Simon’s story.”\n\nThe story is tight — each character, memory, and seemingly off-hand comment has a purpose. While there is comedic quippy dialogue and scene transitions sprinkled throughout, Courville is ultimately a suspenseful drama exploring trauma, tragedy, and grief.\n\nCertain themes may not resonate with those unfamiliar with Canadian politics. Adult Simon offers some brief historical primers to better familiarize the audience, but ultimately, the significance of the politics in Quebec, its relation to the rest of Canada, and how it relates to the themes of play is reliant on an individual’s personal knowledge of Canadian politics.\n\nAdditionally, there are moments throughout the play where French is spoken, or a character speaks English with a heavy French accent. Depending on where an individual is sitting, the English surtitles are obstructed with stage lights.\n\nLilia Su, 20, standing inside of the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, where the show is held.

There is some value in rewatching the play, but unlike a movie, Courville is only showing in Hong Kong for three days, potentially leaving many dissatisfied with their understanding of the themes.\n\nReporting by Estelle Su\n\nEditing by Justin Fung, Coey Fung"
