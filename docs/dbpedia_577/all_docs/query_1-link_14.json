Cirque FLIP Fabrique joins forces with renowned director and playwright Robert Lepage and Ex Machina to create SLAM!, a celebration of wrestling in all its many forms. This mega-theatrical show amplifies the exuberant nature of wrestling, drawing inspiration from around the world. In a spectacular display of acrobatics and strength, the SLAM! acrobats embody an array of characters to recreate the passionate atmosphere of wrestling matches. Lepageâ€™s influence on contemporary theater and his pioneering use of multimedia has secured his status as one of the most prominent and influential artists of his generation."
