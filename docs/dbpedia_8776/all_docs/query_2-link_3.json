        "text": "The town is built on the southern bank of the Eastern Euphrates, in a valley at the foot of Mount St. Mesrob. On the summit of that same mountain are the ruins of a fort from the Urartuan period. The town is characterised by its irregular streets and constant undulations, making movement difficult. Palu is surrounded on its northern and southern sides by high mountains which determine the climate, especially the summer, when the weather is not healthy.\n\nThere are four Armenian quarters in the town: Yerevan, Doner, St Sahag and St Giragos. The last two, at the end of the 19th century, were in ruins and deserted, therefore Armenian life is centred in the Yerevan and Doner quarters [4]. These were built at the foot of St Mesrob Mountain, on the side facing the Aradzani River. The people of Palu call this descending slope Keran. According to the facts available in the 1870s, there were 585 households of Armenians living there forming a population of 4683 people. The two working churches in the town are St Gregory the Illuminator and The Holy Mother of God although, according to the 1870s information, both St Sahag and St Giragos churches were still being used. It was a few decades later that, when the quarter’s Armenian population left, those two churches would be abandoned by their congregations. The St Toros pilgrimage site is located on the brow of the mountain, a little above the Armenian quarter [5]. The Armenian Protestants also have a prayer hall in Palu. On the south side, the summit is called Kohanamk by the Armenians and is a place of pilgrimage for the local population. Another pilgrimage place is on the northern side of the mountain, the former St Boghos monastery, of which only ruins remain [6].\n\nThe government centre was formerly located in a place about a quarter of an hour from the town, but it has been demolished and a new building was erected exactly in the centre of the town [7].\n\nThe town of Palu is not well watered. It’s true that the Aradzani flows by it, but it’s not easy to get water to the various part of the town, which is quite high up. It is probably for the same reason that the town and its immediate surroundings are generally devoid of green spaces. There are only a few poplar and almond trees in the whole town. This lack of water is somewhat alleviated by the existence of three fountains called Shar, Var and Djemi that are much used by the inhabitants of the Armenian quarters. There is also the icy water of the bath-house, the source for which is located in the lower Turkish quarter. During the summer, those in the Armenian quarters with horses or nags would come there and, having filled containers with cold water, would load them on to their animals and bring it up into the Armenian quarters [8].\n\nThe Turkish quarters are separate from those of the Armenians. The Turks live in three different areas. The first is Zovia, located in the town’s north-western area behind the fort, and is a large quarter with about 242 households and two mosques. The other Turkish quarter, Ashaghki Mehle, is located south-east of the fort just behind a fortress-like massif on the river bank called Kntiga Rock. This quarter consists of 436 households. The third, Charshe Bashi, is in the middle of the town above the market and settled on a slope. This quarter has 528 households. There are a total of 1206 Turkish-occupied households or 7236 Turkish inhabitants living in Palu itself, according to the figures produced in the 1870s [9].\n\nJust before the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-78, and based on Salname facts – that in this instance only quotes the number of males – the number of Armenians in the district was assessed at 20% of the population and in Palu itself at 40%. Immediately after the war, when Palu had been joined to the province of Mamuret-el-Aziz, the percentage of Armenians in the district was thought to be 40%, due to the extraordinary fall in the number of Muslim males. At the beginning of 1890, in the Sultan Abdul Hamid era just before the anti-Armenian massacres, the number of Armenians in the district was considered to be between 13,000 and 14,000 individuals, in other words 25% of the total population. The 1895-96 massacres were the reason for the noticeable decline in their numbers. Just before the outbreak of the First World War, however, the number of Armenians in the district was assessed as 15,000 [10].\n\nThere are practically no shops in the villages in the Palu district, although the exception is the Armenian village of Havav (Ekinözu). Thus the town’s market is the place that the townspeople and the people from the villages can trade. There are old and new khans (overnight resting households) there. Mercantile houses ply their trade and tradesmen have their own shops too. The market area is generally full of villagers who arrange the produce they’ve brought with them and sell it. Among the things they sell are wheat, barley, wood and fuel [11]. To the west of the town, on the road to Sgham (Pınartepe), is an Ottoman barracks. Anyone coming to the town from the south has to go over a bridge over the Aradzani River. It has stone-built piers, on which a wooden roadway has been built that, according to contemporary accounts, is quite decrepit. Right next to the bridge, on the same west bank, is a government guard post, supervising all the travellers and their goods that pass by [12].\n\nWhich of the villages in this area were Armenian-inhabited?\n\nThe Armenian-populated villages (most of the information concerning the population is based on the 1912 Armenian Apostolic Patriarchate’s census of 1912-1913)\n\nAMARAT or ASHEN KIUGH (now Amarat): located to the north of Palu itself, and very near Nerkhi (Nirhi).
