        "text": "Hi Everyone! I hope you all had a great week.\n\nMadeleine Albright once said, “It took me quite a long time to develop a voice, and now that I have it, I am not going to be silent.” This week’s woman is one who used her voice to share her thoughts and ideas.\n\nZabelle C. Boyajian was born in Diyarbakır in the Diyarbekir Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire (one of the ancient Armenian capitals, Tigranakert) into the family of the British Vice Consul in Diyarbakır and Harput Baron, Thomas Boyajian, and Catherine Rogers, a descendant of the English poet Samuel Rogers. After her father’s murder during the Hamidian massacres, in 1895, Boyajian, her mother and her brother, Henry, moved to London, where she enrolled at the Slade School of Fine Art. She also started writing and illustrating her own books. Her first novel, Esther, about the massacres in Sasun was published in 1901 in London under the pen name Vardeni.\n\nShe was very close with Anna Raffi, the wife of the Armenian novelist Raffi, and her two sons, Aram and Arshak, who had moved to London after Raffi’s death. Boyajian periodically translated and published excerpts from Raffi’s novels in the journal Ararat and organized various reading events to honor his work. In 1916, she compiled and translated the anthology Armenian Legends and Poems (1916), which was introduced by Viscount James Bryce and which included several poems in Alice Stone Blackwell’s translation. She travelled widely and in 1938 published her travel notes and illustrations of Greece, In Greece with Pen and Palette. In 1948 she translated and published Avetik Isahakian’s epic poem Abu Lala Mahari. Boyajian also wrote essays on Shakespeare, Byron, Euripides, Michael Arlen, Raffi, and Avetik Isahakian, as well as comparative works on English and Armenian literature.\n\nBoyajian was also a painter and had her individual exhibitions in London in 1910 and 1912, in Germany in 1920, in Egypt in 1928, in France, in Italy, and in Belgium between 1940-50.\n\nBoyajian died on 26 January 1957 in London.\n\nNext time you feel like you can’t say what is in your head because of others. Remember Zabelle Boyajain and her amazing accomplishments that came only from her thinking for herself and saying all that she believed.\n\nI hope this post helped you all learn something new and interesting today! Be sure to look forward to another post next week!\n\nHave anything to add, more cool stories or suggestions let me know in the comments below!\n\n– Manasa"
