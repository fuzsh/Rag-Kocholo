        "text": "This article focuses on Esma Sultan’s malikane-mukataa of Alasonya, which was among the estates of İstanbul Bahçekapusu Valide Sultan Vakfı, during c. 1780 to 1825. It aims to discuss the effects of the malikane system on the Ottoman provincial political-economy. It also highlights the institutional organization of a malikane in the province by focusing on actors and their relations in the case of controversies. It claims that vakıf-malikanes of absentee landlords, together with the estates of the local notables, played an important role in the process of çiftlik formation in the Balkans.\n\nThis study examines the estate of tanner İbrâhîm bin 'Alî and its inheritance in eighteenth-century Istanbul from a social historical perspective. It enhances our understanding of the lives of workers and features of guilds in early modern Ottoman cities. First, I overview the state of İbrâhîm's estate at the time of his death and process of its inheritance by analyzing his probate inventory (tereke). Second, I compare these data with the relevant details of forty-four other retailers and artisans who lived in Istanbul. Subsequently, I analyze the status of İbrâhîm's property, his outstanding expenses, and debts owed by and to him in detail. Finally, I examine the court cases on his inheritance according to four relevant court records (i'lâms). My analysis reveals the relative affluence of İbrâhîm and the significant involvement of other tanners in determining the inheritance of his estate.\n\nUsing new evidence uncovered from Istanbul court records, this paper shows that Ottoman markets were capable of spontaneous financial innovation before the introduction of modern financial instruments. At the same time, however, it demonstrates that the impact and sustainability of these innovations depended on the underlying political equilibrium. Gediks—entitlements to usufruct rights over the factors of production used in urban commercial and industrial activity—gradually transformed into liquid assets during the late eighteenth century. This transformation was enabled by the coercive power of Janissary-infiltrated guilds in response to the financial needs of small- and medium-scale actors operating within the confines of the domestic economy. The entry barriers, which enabled gedik markets to exist in the first place, also limited their use for growth-promoting purposes and thus set them apart from similar financial instruments that emerged in the West. Gedik markets disappeared as the Janissary–guild coalition declined and better financial instruments emerged during the mid-nineteenth century.\n\nABSTRACT. This article studies temporal variations in wealth levels and distribution in an Ottoman context during the eighteenth century. By analysing the probate estate inventories of the Muslim deceased in Kastamonu, located in north-central Anatolia, we demonstrate that real wealth levels generally declined over the course of the century. Our analysis also suggests that the economic conditions of poor men, if not women, deteriorated more so than those of the rich, fuelling growing inequality."
