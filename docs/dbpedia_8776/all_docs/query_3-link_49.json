        "text": "The cityâ€™s history goes back more than 12.000 years, traces of more than 30 civilisations are visible in the city centre. Diyarbakir is often named the Kurdish capital. In the 1990s the political situation forced many citizens to leave the city, only in 1999 new perspectives for development were created. Especially performing artists (Dengbej) treasure the Kurdish language. At the beginning of the exhibition some musicians performed at the Weltmuseum Wien.\n\nIt's all about people.\n\nThe Weltmuseum Wien is an ethnographic museum and houses some of the most important collections of non-European cultures."
