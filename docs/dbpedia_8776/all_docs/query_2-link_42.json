        "text": "Micro-historical investigation of the 1895 massacres in two rural districts of the Ottoman vilayet of Bitlis, Hizan and Şirvan. It builds on the assumption that wider issues can be better understood through a close study within a limited geographical frame, one that enables an identification of the various sectors, local and external. The article contains a village by village count of the number of the victims and an investigation of the perpetrators and their motives. Though the number of victims was considerably lower than often assumed it is demonstrated that the massacres were a traumatic experience and a terrible economic blow for the Christian population (Armenians, Assyrians) of the area and an important step in the kurdification of the region. a correction (footnote 3, p.126) It should be remarked that the characterisation of Edip Gölbaşı's article, \"1895-1896 katliamları: Doğu Vilayetlerinde cemaatler arasında \"şiddet iklimi\" ve Ermeni karşıtı ayaklanmalar\" (2015) (\"E. Gölbaşı presents a summary of events based largely on my articles\") that did appear in the printed version of the article does not do justice to the range of sources employed by the author. For Turkish readers this overview article is recommended as an introduction to the 1895-1896 massacres.\n\nThe role of Armenians in British intelligence has been largely neglected by historians of World War I. My thesis will explore the multifaceted identities of Armenian dragomans, vice-consuls, and intelligence officers in British service through the careers of Thomas Mugerditchian, Thomas Boyajian, and Arshak Safrastian. These Armenian agents inhabited a unique middle-ground between the East and the West as Christians living in an Islamic Empire. They manipulated their identities to navigate both European and Ottoman circles, making them effective as intelligence officers. Before World War I, Armenian dragomans and vice-consuls were important intermediaries between British consulates in the Ottoman Empire and local populations. When the Ottoman Empire joined the war on the side of the Central Powers, Armenian agents remained important to the British Empire as intelligence officers and translators. My thesis will explore the role of Armenian agents in the British war effort and how their service affected their complex identities, both how they perceived themselves and the extent to which different levels of the British government accepted them.\n\nThe eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire witnessed numerous massacres of Armenians between 1894 and 1897. Although some specialists have studied the origins, dynamics, extent, and repercussions of massacres in the eastern vilayets, few have studied events in the region of Cilicia (southern Anatolia). Drawing upon primary sources from Ottoman Turkish, Armenian, British, and missionary archives, as well as memoirs and personal papers, this article explores the massacres of 1895 in the district of Aintab."
