        "text": "was it 7 or 12 states ? names ??\n\nMos Jan usually people talk about the 6 \"Vilayets\" (Nahankner)\n\nthese are:\n\n1. Van\n\n2. Bitlis (Daron)\n\n3. Diyarbekir (Dikranagerd)\n\n4. Mamuret-Ul-Aziz (Kharpert)\n\n5. Erzurum (Garin)\n\n6. Sivas (Sepastia)\n\nAt the Centennial April 24 here in Detroit they named 12 areas of historic Armenia decimated during the Genocide. I think they got the names of these areas from the memorial of Dzidzernagapert which has 12 pillars.\n\nThe 12 areas were the above 6, plus:\n\n1. Kars\n\n2. Batum\n\n3. Trapizon\n\n4. Ankara\n\n5. Adana\n\n6. Haleb\n\nmaybe you are suprised to see the name of Ankara on the list. However aside from Kars and Batum, which were part of Russia, these other 10 areas were designated by the Vilayets of the Ottoman Empire not by historic regions of Armenia or even the dioceses of the various Armenian regions under the Armenian Church administration in Ottoman Empire. Kars and Batum as well were designated because they were Oblasts of the Russian Empire.\n\nFor example, Haleb, though the people of the city of Haleb were mostly spared the Genocide, its Vilayet included places such as Musa Dagh, Kessab, Antioch, Aintab, Marash, and Urfa which Armenians don't necessarily associate with Haleb and which were affected by the Genocide.\n\nSimilarly with Ankara, the city had only a small population of Armenians, mostly Catholic. But more importantly Ankara Vilayet included such places of Armenian settlements as Sivrihisar and Yozghat, and especially Gesaria with its many surrounding villages such as Talas, Germir, Efkere, Munjusun, Evereg, Fenese, Chomakhlu, Tomarza, Jujun, and Injesu. Armenians considered Gesaria its own region but in Ottoman maps it is part of Ankara Vilayet, and then I guess they didn't want to leave out the Yozghatsi's who are not part of Gesaria region.\n\nI was suprised to hear the name of Batum. I did not know that the Turkish army made incursions into this area...then I found out that Artvin and other cities in the area had belonged to Batum Oblast of the Russian Empire, they were given to Turkey after the war."
