Foremost, it seeks to preserve Iraqâs territorial integrity and prevent the\n\nemergence of a Kurdish state in northern Iraq. It wants its linguistic/ethnic kin in that\n\nregion, the Iraqi Turkomans, to be fairly represented in a future government. Turkey\n\nalso is worried about the economic consequences of a war, especially since it is just\n\nrecovering from a devastating recession. Finally, it is concerned about the possibilities\n\nfor a humanitarian refugee crisis and regional instability. The Bush Administration is\n\nconsulting closely with Turkish officials to assuage their concerns and has provided\n\nincreased economic assistance while attempting to enhance trade through (free trade)\n\nqualified industrial zones in H.R. 5385. Turkey expects still greater rewards for its\n\nsupport. See also CRS Report RL31429, Turkey: Issues for U.S. Policy and CRS Report\n\nRL31339, Iraq: U.S. Efforts to Change the Regime. This report will be updated if\n\ndevelopments warrant.\n\nIntroduction\n\nTurkey, a long time NATO ally of the United States which borders on Iraq, will\n\nlikely be pivotal to any U.S. military operation against Iraq. It is assumed that the United\n\nStates would like to use Turkeyâs air space, the large air base at Incirlik in southeast\n\nTurkey, and probably other airbases at Batman, Diyarbakir, or Malatya that are closer to\n\nthe Iraqi border. Additionally, access to the Mediterranean port of Mersin and the sharing\n\nof intelligence may be on the U.S. wish list. For its part, the Turkish government is\n\nuneasy about U.S. plans. Turks argue that theirs is the country that will be most affected\n\nby a war and oppose it for a variety of reasons. (See the following section.) Turkish\n\nofficials have pressed Saddam Hussein to implement U.N. resolutions and readmit\n\nweapons inspectors in order to prevent a military intervention. They also have urged the\n\nUnited States to obtain what they view as international legitimacy through a resolution\n\nauthorizing the use of force from the United Nations Security Council. Despite\n\nmisgivings, some Turks appear increasingly reconciled to a U.S. military campaign and\n\nadvocate exacting a high price from the United States in exchange for support. A few\n\nsuggest that Turkeyâs armed forces participate actively alongside Americans to ensure that\n\nTurkey has a determining say about northern Iraqâs future.\n\nCongressional Research Service Ë The Library of Congress\n\nCRS-2\n\nTurkeyâs Concerns\n\nTurkeyâs concerns about a war against Iraq are many. Foremost, Turkey is\n\nconcerned that Iraqâs territorial integrity is maintained and, relatedly, about its\n\nlinguistic/ethnic kin, the Iraqi Turkomans. Turkey also is anxious about the economic\n\nconsequences of a war, having lost billions of uncompensated dollars as a result of the\n\nfirst Gulf war, and having just begun to recover from its worst recession in 50 years.\n\nFinally, Turkey is worried about regional stability in the wake of a U.S.-Iraq war. These\n\nconcerns are examined below.\n\nIraqâs Territorial Integrity â the Kurdish Issue. Turkey argues that the power\n\nvacuum in northern Iraq after the first Gulf war enabled the Kurdistan Workers Party\n\n(PKK) to find safe havens from which to escalate its insurgency in Turkey. The PKK is\n\na guerrilla/terrorist group that waged a war for independence or autonomy in Turkeyâs\n\nsoutheast from 1984-1999. Turkey fears that another war would produce a new power\n\nvacuum and result in the partition of Iraq. The birth of a Kurdish state in northern Iraq\n\ncould serve as a model for Turkish Kurdish separatists, whom many Turks believe are still\n\nseeking their own state in southeast Turkey.1\n\nSince the Gulf War, Turkey has allowed U.S. and British planes flying from Incirlik\n\nAir Base to enforce a no-fly zone over northern Iraq (Operation Northern Watch) to\n\nprotect Iraqâs Kurds from Saddam Hussein and monitor his armed forces. Turkey has\n\ndeveloped a tenuous modus vivendi with the two main Iraqi Kurdish groups, the\n\nKurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), but it\n\ndoes not trust their assurances that they do not want an independent state. Turkish Prime\n\nMinister Bulent Ecevit and others acknowledge that the Iraqi Kurds have a de facto state\n\nin northern Iraq, with institutions and infrastructure. But they do not want the Iraqi\n\nKurds to take additional steps toward de jure independence.\n\nTurkeyâs anxiety about possible Iraqi Kurdish statehood has increased as an\n\nAmerican military campaign has appeared more likely. Some in Ankara suggest that the\n\nprobability of war has emboldened the Iraqi Kurds to take advantage of what they\n\nperceive to be the U.S. need for their assistance. Tensions surfaced between Turkey and\n\nthe KDP in August 2002 over the latterâs draft constitution for a federal Iraq in which the\n\nKurds would have greater autonomy and control of oil-rich Kirkuk.2 In reaction, Turkey\n\nclosed the Habur border gate, cutting the KDPâs revenue sources by restricting the semi-\n\n1 On April 4, 2002, the PKK renamed itself the Kurdistan Freedom and Democracy Congress\n\n(KADEK) and elected PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan as KADEK general chairman in absentia.\n\n(Ocalan was tried and sentenced to death for treason; but his sentence was changed to life without\n\nparole after Turkey abolished the death penalty.) KADEK spokesmen contend that the armed\n\nstruggle is over, and that they seek to resolve issues only by the âdemocratizationâ of Turkey,\n\nwithout changing borders of the countries in the region. Turkish Kurds currently seek increased\n\ncultural and language rights and freedom to participate politically as a party. Turkish officials\n\nbelieve that the PKK/KADEK change is tactical and that separatism remains the goal.\n\n2 Kirkuk is now controlled by the Baghdad government and is not part of the Kurdish autonomous\n\narea created in 1991. Its population is ethnically mixed: Arabs, Kurds, Turkomans.\n\nCRS-3\n\nillicit flow of diesel fuel from northern Iraq into Turkey.3 Turkish Defense Minister\n\nSabahattin Cakmakoglu, a member of the right-wing Nationalist Action Party, claimed\n\nthat Turkey has historic rights in northern Iraq dating from 1920.4 The KDPâs official\n\nnewspaper responded by threatening to turn northern Iraq into âa graveyardâ for Turkish\n\nsoldiers if they intervened, provoking angry reactions from Turkish civilian and military\n\nofficials and media.5 To repair bilateral relations, KDP leader Masâud Barzani and other\n\nKDP officials have repeatedly affirmed the KDPâs commitment to Iraqâs territorial\n\nintegrity and assurances for Turkeyâs national security and sovereignty.6\n\nOn September 25, the KDP and PUK agreed to a revised version of Barzaniâs draft\n\nconstitution for a federal zone in northern Iraq, with Kirkuk as its capital, to present to\n\nother Iraqi opposition groups. Prime Minister Ecevit responded that if the Iraqi Kurds\n\nâtake a step that could be tantamount to a declaration of independence ... Turkey would\n\nconsider its options including use of force.â7 Many experts say this was partly campaign\n\nrhetoric for the November 3 national election by a lame duck official. To mitigate any\n\ninternational misinterpretation, Foreign Ministry and military voices declared that\n\ndevelopments in northern Iraq were under control. Yet, in the 1990s, Turkish forces had\n\nmade regular incursions into northern Iraq in âhot pursuitâ of the PKK, and at least 5,000\n\nTurkish troops reportedly are there now ostensibly to control activities of the PKK and\n\nas a warning to the Iraqi Kurds.\n\nTurkomans.8 Probably in part to balance Iraqi Kurdish momentum toward\n\nautonomy, Turkey has championed the rights of Iraqi Turkomans, who reside alongside\n\nthe Kurds in northern Iraq. Turkomans are ethnic/linguistic relatives of the Turks. The\n\nTurkish government and Turkoman leaders recognized by Ankara claim that there are 3\n\nmillion Iraqi Turkomans, although most sources, including the Baghdad government, cite\n\nfar lower figures.9 Historically, the Turkomansâ relations with other ethnic groups in the\n\n3 The United Nations and United States waive sanctions on Turkey for the illicit energy traffic\n\nbecause it aids both Turkey and the Iraqi Kurds.\n\n4 This was before the emergence of the Turkish Republic and fails to recognize a 1926 Turkish\n\n-British agreement giving the Ottoman Mosul Vilayet, including Kirkuk, to Britain, which as\n\ncolonial power was the predecessor of modern Iraq. Other Turkish officials maintain that\n\nCakmakogluâs comments should be viewed in the context of his defense of Iraqi Turkomans.\n\n5 Turkish Daily Notes KDP Official Postponed Visit Fearing Ankaraâs Reaction, Hurriyet,\n\nAugust 23, 2002, translation entered into FBIS online, August 25, 2002; Turkish (Foreign)\n\nministry says Iraqi Kurd leaderâs words âaggressive,â Anatolia News Agency, in English, BBC-\n\nMonitoring Europe, September 6, 2002.\n\n6 Dialogue can resolve problems between Turkey, Iraqi Kurd group-leader, Anatolia News\n\nAgency, in English, BBC-Monitoring Europe, September 10, 2002.\n\n7 Fikret Bila, All Eyes are on North Iraq, Milliyet, October 3, 2002, translation entered into FBIS\n\nonline, October 3, 2002.\n\n8 Sometimes referred to as Turcoman and Turkmen. The latter usage, however, could be\n\nconfused with the inhabitants of Turkmenistan.\n\n9 Sources estimate that Turkomans constitute about 1.4% of the Iraqi population and probably\n\nnumber about 330,000. They have assimilated with other Iraqi groups for years. According to\n\none source, there are about 1.5 million Turkomans in the Middle East, residing in Iraq, Iran, and\n\n(continued...)\n\nCRS-4\n\nregion have been troubled. Turkey favors the Ankara-based Iraqi Turkoman Front, which\n\ncalls for a unitary state in Iraq or a regionally, not ethnically, based federal government.\n\nOf relevance to Turkeyâs interests is the residence of many Turkomans in Kirkuk,\n\nan oil-rich region in Northern Iraq. Turkey does not want that oil to finance an Iraqi\n\nKurdish state. In the event of a U.S. military operation against Iraq, some analysts suggest\n\nthat Turkey could use its sincere concern for the Turkomans as a pretext to intervene and\n\nprevent the Iraqi Kurds from controlling the oil reserves.10 Turkish Foreign Ministry\n\nofficials deny having such designs and claim that they would not interfere in Iraqâs\n\ninternal affairs. They compare their concern for the Turkomans to their feelings for\n\nBulgarian Turks under communist rule, and say that they only want to see Turkomans\n\nsimilarly represented in a democratic Iraq.11 The same mistrust of Turkeyâs alleged\n\nterritorial ambitions was expressed during the first Gulf War, but the inaction of Turkeyâs\n\nmilitary then seemed to prove suspicions groundless. Moreover, Turkey and Iran agree\n\non the need to preserve Iraqâs territorial integrity, and Turkey would not likely act\n\ncontrary to this agreement. Turkey and Iran have not battled each other for centuries\n\ndespite their different political systems, sometimes uneasy relations, and occasional\n\nskirmishes.\n\nEconomic Factors. Turkeyâs opposition to a war against Iraq also is motivated\n\nby economic concerns. Before the first Gulf War, Turkey closed its border with Iraq, then\n\none of its major trading partners, and abided by international sanctions. Turks estimate\n\nthe cost of the closure at $30 billion to $100 billion, and argue that the international\n\ncommunity never compensated Turkey for its losses. As a result of the U.N.âs\n\nhumanitarian âoil-for-foodâ program begun in December 1996 and of the semi-illicit trade\n\nin diesel and crude oil, bilateral Iraqi-Turkish trade now totals about $1 billion annually.\n\nThe two neighbors hope to reach pre-Gulf War trade levels of about $2.5 billion annually.\n\nTurkey does not want this positive trend reversed.\n\nTurkish officials and others fear the economic damage a war might inflict could\n\ninclude rising oil prices, loss of foreign investment, collapse of the vital tourism sector,\n\nclosure of the oil pipeline from Iraq to Turkeyâs Mediterranean coast, and loss of border\n\nand other bilateral trade. Achievement of the goals of a painful economic reform program\n\nalso might be set back. Turkey generally has not contemplated benefits that might ensue\n\nfrom normal economic relations with a post-Saddam Iraq because they are seen as\n\nuncertain long term prospects, while Turkey has many immediate needs in the aftermath\n\nof an impoverishing recession.\n\nHumanitarian Issues. Turkey notes that the Gulf War created a mass exodus of\n\nhundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurds to Turkey and a humanitarian crisis of enormous\n\n9 (...continued)\n\nTurkey. Colbert C.

In the event of a new war, Turkey has contingency plans to establish camps\n\nfor refugees on the Iraqi side of the border as well as at several sites in southeast Turkey.\n\nRegional Stability. Finally, Turkey is concerned about the potential for postwar\n\nregional instability, including the unleashing of now latent interethnic and religious\n\ndisputes and a worsening of the Israeli-Arab conflict. Ankara would prefer the United\n\nStates to give priority to solving the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.\n\nU.S. Policy\n\nThe Administration is attempting to assuage Turkeyâs concerns and gain its support\n\nfor possible military action against Iraq. While in Turkey in July 2002, Undersecretary\n\nof Defense Paul Wolfowitz declared that a separate Kurdish state in northern Iraq was\n\nunacceptable to the United States.12 When Secretary of State Colin Powell saluted the\n\nIraqi Kurdish parliament on October 4, 2002, he claimed that they shared the U.S. vision\n\nfor a âdemocratic, pluralistic, united Iraqâ with its âterritorial integrity intact.â Some\n\nTurks nonetheless believe that the United States is telling the Kurds and Turkey what each\n\nwants to hear. Yet, no U.S. official has expressed support for a Kurdish state.\n\nU.S. officials are closely, and with increasing frequency, consulting their Turkish\n\ncounterparts. Secretary of State Colin Powell, Wolfowitz, National Security Advisor\n\nCondoleeza Rice, and Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman met with Undersecretary\n\nof the Foreign Ministry Ugur Ziyal in Washington in late August 2002. Vice President\n\nDick Cheney spoke to Ziyal on videophone. Such high level meetings with an\n\nundersecretary are beyond the dictates of normal diplomatic protocol, but Ziyal is one of\n\nthe ministryâs experts on the Middle East and the Turkish General Staff Chief of Plans\n\nwas in his delegation. Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Elizabeth Jones\n\nthen visited Turkey in September. Most recently, Commander of the U.S. Central\n\nCommand General Tommy Franks, responsible for Iraq, and NATO Supreme Allied\n\nCommander in Europe and Commander of the U.S. European Command General Joseph\n\nRalston met Chief of the Turkish General Staff General Hilmi Ozkok and other officers\n\nin Ankara on October 21. Franks said that the purpose of his visit was âcollaboration,\n\nconsultation, and discussion,â and that he had made no requests. On October 23,\n\nPresident Bush conferred via telephone with Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer.\n\nGeneral Ozkok will visit the United States, November 4-10, when he will meet Secretary\n\nof Defense Donald Rumsfeld and others in Washington and General Franks at\n\nCENTCOM headquarters in Tampa.\n\nThe United States is paying attention to Turkey in other ways. After the September\n\n11, 2001 terror attacks, the Administration resumed foreign aid to Turkey which had been\n\nmostly discontinued in 1998 as part of a policy of âaid graduation.â The United States\n\nprovided $28 million in military aid and $200 million in economic assistance in FY 2002,\n\nlargely to support Turkeyâs command of the International Security Assistance Force\n\n(ISAF) in Afghanistan. Since 1999, the United States, as the largest contributor to the\n\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), has helped Turkey obtain $31 billion in financing to\n\n12 AA Details Wolfowitz Address at TESEV Meet on US-Turkish Relations, Ankara Anatolia in\n\nEnglish, 15 July 02, entered into FBIS online, July 15, 2002.\n\nCRS-6\n\nenable it to recover from financial crises and to undertake major economic reforms. The\n\nUnited States also has promised a new economic partnership with Turkey focused on\n\ntrade. The first step is the creation of Qualified Industrial Zones (QIZs) from which\n\nTurkish goods could be exported to the United States without tariffs as part of the U.S.-\n\nIsrael Free Trade Agreement. (See H.R. 5385, Miscellaneous Trade and Technical\n\nCorrections Act of 2002, Sec. 2002, Designation of Israeli-Turkish Qualified Industrial\n\nZones, agreed to in the House on October 7, 2002.) Some Turks are disappointed in the\n\npotential of QIZs because they exclude textiles, Turkeyâs main export to the United\n\nStates, from duty free status.\n\nSome Turks may have unrealistic expectations of U.S. assistance that might result\n\nfrom support for a war as they envision millions or billions more in aid. Yet, after the\n\nfirst Gulf war, the United States increased aid and donated 1,000 M-60 tanks to Turkey,\n\ntotaling billions.13 There also is the option of forgiveness of all or part of Turkeyâs\n\nmilitary debt to the United States. As of the end of 2000, Turkey owed about $1.6 billion\n\nin outstanding principal for direct loans and $2.8 billion in outstanding principal for\n\nguaranteed loans. Much of the debt carries high interest rates; forgiveness would be\n\ncostly and require congressional action.14\n\nTurkey expects the United States to exert pressure on the European Union (EU)\n\nsummit in Copenhagen in December 2002 to set a date for the EU to begin accession\n\nnegotiations with Turkey. A European Commission progress report issued on October\n\n9 failed to recommend that a date be set, and Turkey hopes that European political leaders\n\nwill redress that failing at their summit. The United States had energetically prodded the\n\nEU to name Turkey as a candidate for membership in 1999.\n\nOutlook\n\nBecause Turkey highly values its alliance with the United States, is indebted to the\n\nUnited States for its help at the IMF, and wants to help determine Iraqâs future, most\n\nobservers expect it to support U.S. efforts against Iraq by allowing U.S. forces to use its\n\nbases and other facilities. This will likely happen due to the influence of the Turkish\n\nmilitary and foreign policy bureaucracy no matter which party or parties win the\n\nNovember 3 national election. Iraq is not an election issue. After any U.S.-Iraq conflict,\n\nthere is a risk that Turkey will be disappointed if the economic rewards for its support fail\n\nto meet its expectations. That in itself may not irrevocably harm the U.S.-Turkish\n\nalliance. If Iraq is tacitly partitioned and the region is destabilized, Turkey may demand\n\nan active U.S. role in restabilizing the situation. Turkey could be affected by instability\n\nin its neighborhood and bilateral U.S.-Turkish relations might deteriorate if Ankara is\n\ndissatisfied with U.S. policies in the post-war period.\n\n13 Umit Enginsoy, NTV, October 21, 2002, translation entered into FBIS online October 21,\n\n2002.\n\n14 U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget, U.S. Government\n\nForeign Credit Exposure as of December 31, 2000, Part II, Region, Country and Dependency\n\nTables, pp. 306-307. Note, in 1990, Congress cancelled Egyptâs $6.7 billion military debt as a\n\nreward for its cooperation against Iraq.
