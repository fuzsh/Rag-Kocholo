        "text": "Administrative division of the Ottoman Empire from 1515 to 1846\n\nFor other uses, see Diyarbakir Province (disambiguation).\n\nThe Eyalet of Diyarbekir (Arabic: إيالة ديار بكر; Ottoman Turkish: ایالت دیاربكر, romanized: Eyālet-i Diyār-i Bekr)[2] was an eyalet of the Ottoman Empire. Its reported area in the 19th century was 20,332 square miles (52,660 km2),[3] slightly larger than the original Abbasid province in Upper Mesopotamia. In 1846 it was succeeded by the Kurdistan Eyalet.[4]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 17th-century traveller Evliya Çelebi reported on the organization of the eyalet: \"In this province there are nineteen sanjaks and five hakumets (or hereditary governments) [...] eight [sanjaks] were at the time of the conquest conferred on Kurdish begs with the patent of family inheritance for ever. Like other sanjaks they are divided into ziamets and timars, the possessors of which are obliged to serve in the field; but if they do not, the ziamet or timar may be transferred to a son or relation, but not to a stranger.\n\nThe hakumets have neither ziamets nor timars. Their governors exercise full authority, and receive not only the land revenues, but also all the other taxes which in the sanjaks are paid to the possessor of the ziamet or timar, such as the taxes for pasturage, marriages, horses, vineyards, and orchards. [...]\n\nThe officers of the divan of Diarbeker are the defterdar of the treasury with a ruz-namji (journal writer); a defterdar of the feudal forces an inspector (emin), and a lieutenant kehiya of the defter, and another for the chavushes; a secretary (katib), a colonel, and a lieutenant colonel of the militia\".[5]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter Reşid Mehmet Pasha assumed as Wāli in 1834, he led military campaigns against the local Kurdish tribes of the Garzan, Bedir Khan and Milli as well as the Yazidi in Sinjar. In 1835 he also subdued the Milli tribe in Mardin[6] and in 1836, he defeated the ruler from the Emirate of Soran.[6] After his death in 1836, his successor was Hafiz Mehmet Pasha who continued to subdue the Kurdish tribes and the Yazidi in Sincar.[6] In the 1840s, the Eyalet ceded the Sanjak of Cizre, which before was part of the Emirate of Bohtan in the Diyarbekır Eyalet, to the Mosul Eyalet, which led to a Kurdish revolt led by Bedir Khan Beg.[7]\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\n[edit]\n\nSanjaks between 1515-1526[8]\n\nSanjak of Amid\n\nSanjak of Mardin\n\nSanjak of Sincar\n\nSanjak of Birecik\n\nSanjak of Ruha\n\nSanjak of Siverek\n\nSanjak of Çermik\n\nSanjak of Ergani\n\nSanjak of Harput\n\nSanjak of Arabgir\n\nSanjak of Kiğı\n\nSanjak of Çemişkezek\n\nSanjaks between 1526-1560[8]\n\nSanjak of Amid\n\nSanjak of Mardin\n\nSanjak of Sincar\n\nSanjak of Ruha\n\nSanjak of Siverek\n\nSanjak of Çermik\n\nSanjak of Ergani\n\nSanjak of Harput\n\nSanjak of Arabgir\n\nSanjak of Kiğı\n\nSanjak of Çemişkezek\n\nSanjak of Musul\n\nSanjak of Hit\n\nSanjak of Deyr\n\nSanjak of Rahbe\n\nSanjak of Ane\n\nSanjaks after 1560[8]\n\nSanjak of Amid\n\nSanjak of Sincar\n\nSanjak of Ruha\n\nSanjak of Siverek\n\nSanjak of Çermik\n\nSanjak of Ergani\n\nSanjak of Harput\n\nSanjak of Arabgir\n\nSanjak of Kiğı\n\nSanjak of Çemişkezek\n\nSanjak of Musul\n\nSanjak of Hit\n\nSanjak of Deyr\n\nSanjak of Rahbe\n\nSanjak of Ane\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nBedr Khan Beg\n\nEmirate of Çemişgezek"
