        "text": "Order Code RL31794\n\nReport for Congress\n\nReceived through the CRS Web\n\nIraq: Turkey, the Deployment of U.S. Forces, and\n\nRelated Issues\n\nUpdated May 2 , 2003\n\nname redacted\n\nSpecialist in Middle Eastern Affairs\n\nForeign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division\n\nCongressional Research Service Ë The Library of Congress\n\nIraq: Turkey, the Deployment of U.S. Forces, and\n\nRelated Issues\n\nSummary\n\nOn March 1, 2003, the Turkish parliament rejected a resolution authorizing the\n\ndeployment of U.S. forces to Turkey to open a northern front in a war against Iraq.\n\nThe rejection resulted from strains within the ruling Justice and Development Party\n\n(AKP), an inexperienced leadership, competing influences, and the overwhelming\n\nopposition of Turkish public opinion. Moreover, the powerful Turkish military had\n\nnot actively supported the governmentâs position before the vote, and the President\n\nhad suggested that the resolution would be unconstitutional.\n\nFor a long time, Turkey had serious concerns about the prospect of a second\n\nGulf war, and these affected the vote in parliament and the negotiations with the\n\nUnited States for the troop deployment. Concerns included fear that a war would\n\nlead to an independent Iraqi Kurdish state and inspire the revival of Turkish Kurdish\n\nseparatism, worries over the fate of Iraqi Turkomans, who are ethnic kin of the Turks,\n\npotential economic losses, a potential refugee crisis on the Turkey-Iraq border, and\n\npossible detrimental effects on regional stability.\n\nThe Bush Administration engaged in intensive diplomacy to gain Turkeyâs\n\nsupport. The negotiations reportedly produced several tentative agreements. The\n\nparliamentary resolution that was rejected would have enabled a U.S. deployment of\n\ntroops, planes, and helicopters to Turkey. The United States would have provided\n\nTurkey with a $6 billion assistance package, some of which could have been used to\n\nsupport $24 billion loan guarantees. Until the funds were available, the\n\nAdministration would have provided a bridge loan of $8.5 billion. It also would have\n\nprovided enhanced trade benefits to Turkish businesses. A memorandum of\n\nunderstanding was said to have dealt with Turkish troops in northern Iraq and their\n\ncoordination with U.S. forces. But the agreements were never concluded. After the\n\nwar began, the Administration only wanted access to Turkeyâs airspace, which was\n\ngranted on March 21, 2003, and to prevent Turkish forces from interfering in\n\nnorthern Iraq. Turkey agreed to provide food, fuel, and other non-lethal supplies for\n\nU.S. troops in northern Iraq. The United States will give Turkey $1 billion in aid,\n\nwith which it can leverage $8.5 billion in loans.\n\nThe Turkish parliamentâs failure to authorize the troop deployment has\n\nsignificant implications. To govern effectively, the AKP needs to mend strains and\n\nrebuild its political standing. Moreover, despite Turkeyâs increasing democratization,\n\nthe AKP cannot ignore the militaryâs great influence. The prolonged negotiations and\n\nthe legislative defeat strained bilateral U.S.-Turkish relations. Both sides developed\n\nhard feelings which may take time to overcome. Turkey may be deprived of some\n\ninfluence concerning postwar Iraq, the Iraqi Kurds, and the Iraqi Turkomans. It also\n\nlost the substantial aid package that had been tied to acceptance of the U.S.\n\ndeployment, although a smaller one has been appropriated.\n\nThis report will not be updated.

The vote surprised the U.S. government and\n\nits Turkish counterpart. Both governments may have greatly overestimated their\n\nunderstanding of the Turkish political situation that contributed to the defeat of the\n\nresolution. This report focuses on that political scene, Turkish concerns about an Iraq\n\nconflict, the tentative, but unfulfilled, bargain struck between the U.S. and Turkish\n\ngovernments to authorize the U.S. deployment - to the extent that it is known, the\n\nfinal arrangements for U.S. access to Turkish airspace, and attendant issues. This\n\nreport also reviews the implications of parliamentâs actions for the bilateral U.S.-\n\nTurkish relationship, regional relations, Turkeyâs domestic politics, its economy, and\n\nbroader issues.\n\nTurkish Political Scene\n\nThe AKP Government\n\nIn the November 3, 2002, national election in Turkey, a single party scored a\n\nvictory for the first time in over a decade by winning 363 out of 550 seats in\n\nparliament. On November 28, 2002, the Justice and Development Party (AKP) took\n\npower in unusual way. Party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan had not been allowed to\n\nrun for a seat in parliament, having been banned from politics because of a 1996\n\nspeech that had Islamist overtones, and did not become Prime Minister. Deputy party\n\nleader Abdullah Gul became Prime Minister instead. On December 27, 2002,\n\nparliament changed the constitution to lift the ban on Erdogan and allow him to\n\ncontest a seat in parliament. He ran in a by-election in the southeast town of Siirt on\n\nMarch 9, 2003, and won. The Gul government then resigned, and on March 14,\n\nErdogan finally became Prime Minister. Between November and March, despite\n\ntheir close collaboration, each man had acted as if he were in charge, producing a\n\nlack of leadership clarity.\n\nAKP had been established by âreformersâ rebelling against Necmettin Erbakan,\n\nthe long-term, authoritarian, leader of Turkeyâs Islamists. To achieve its electoral\n\nvictory, AKP had brought together centrists, nationalists, Islamists, and Kurds, and\n\ncaptured the votes of Turkeyâs Anatolian heartland. The underlying Islamist\n\norientation of some AKP deputies undoubtedly motivated their votes against the\n\nresolution authorizing the U.S. troop deployment. Analysts note that the AKPâs\n\nCRS-2\n\ngrassroots workers, core constituency, and many members of parliament view the\n\nworld through the prism of religion or Islamism. They believe that the United States\n\nis determined to wage war against Muslims.1 Nationalism is another strong force\n\namong AKP supporters, and the partyâs nationalists suspected that the United States\n\nhad imperialist intentions of occupying their country by seeking to impose a large\n\nground force on Turkey. They also may not have wanted to be outflanked by the\n\nextreme nationalistic stance of the opposition Republican Peopleâs Party (CHP).\n\nTurkey had waged a long struggle against its domestic Kurdish separatists, and many\n\nin the AKP feared that the United States would use the war to support the\n\nestablishment of an independent Iraqi Kurdish state. The AKP also has Kurdish\n\nmembers, and they reportedly were concerned about possible Turkish military\n\noperations against their Iraqi Kurdish ethnic kin under the umbrella of a U.S. military\n\naction in northern Iraq.\n\nAll of the above concerns were at play, when, on March 1, 533 out of 550\n\nMembers of Parliament were present to vote on the resolution authorizing the U.S.\n\ndeployment of 62,000 troops to Turkey and the âforeign deploymentâ of an\n\nunspecified number of Turkish troops to an unspecified place (Iraq). The opposition\n\nCHP, ideologically nationalist as well as opportunistically negative, exercised party\n\ndiscipline and voted as a bloc to reject the resolution. The AKP allowed its members\n\na âfree vote,â without party discipline. An absolute majority of those present, or 267\n\nvotes, was required to pass the resolution, but it got only 264 votes, failing by three.\n\nNinety-nine members of the AKP voted against the measure; 19 abstained. Although\n\nthe cabinet had unanimously referred the matter to parliament, three ministers voted\n\nagainst the resolution. In the party caucus prior to the vote, approximately 30\n\ndeputies reportedly had advised the leadership that they would oppose the measure\n\nand 15 had declared that they would abstain. Therefore, the vote revealed what many\n\nobservers saw as an astonishing breakdown in AKP internal communications. Many\n\nbelieved that it also showed the inexperience of the partyâs legislators and its leaders,\n\nand the latterâs inability to read the former.\n\nCommunication appears to be a major problem for the AKP. Since taking\n\noffice, the party has spoken with many voices, which sometimes lacked harmony.\n\nAnalysts view Erdogan as a pragmatist,2 and he declared that it was in the national\n\ninterest to respond favorably to the U.S. request to deploy troops to Turkey.\n\nHowever, while he determined this was an issue of national importance, he failed to\n\nexplain that importance assertively, press members of his partyâs parliamentary\n\ndelegation strongly, or enforce party discipline on the vote. After the defeat, Erdogan\n\nexplained that the outcome was a demonstration of intraparty democracy.\n\nMeanwhile, Gul, who had served for years at the Islamic Development Bank in Saudi\n\nArabia, had worked to form a consensus with Middle Eastern states to exhaust all\n\nopportunities for peace and only very reluctantly agreed to take steps to support a\n\nwar. His government had reestablished ambassadorial level diplomatic relations with\n\nIraq and sent a minister with a delegation of more than 300 to Baghdad to discuss\n\n1 âTurkish Rebuff to U.S. Shows Regional Strains,â Wall Street Journal, March 3, 2003.\n\n2 These analysts include Soner Capotay of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy\n\nand Sahin Alpay, a Turkish professor and journalist who spoke at the Washington office of\n\nthe Turkish Industrialistsâ and Businessmenâs Association (TUSIAD) on February 21, 2003.\n\nCRS-3\n\ntrade. The normally soft-spoken Gul was particularly reticent in his advocacy of the\n\nresolution. Erdogan and Gul had publicly urged Baghdad to comply with U.N.\n\nresolutions demanding disarmament, but did not publicly support U.S. use of force\n\nto disarm Iraq, regime change, or any stated U.S. policy during the crisis. Moreover,\n\nSpeaker of Parliament Bulent Arinc, who cherishes the AKPâs formative Islamist\n\nagenda, encouraged opponents of the resolution in what may have been a power play\n\nagainst the partyâs pragmatists.3 None of the three main AKP leaders, analysts\n\nmaintain, really championed the resolution or earnestly attempted to influence\n\ndeputies and the grassroots on its behalf.\n\nAnother political player worked to undermine the AKP leadersâ effort in\n\nparliament. Former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, leader of several successive\n\nIslamist parties and the godfather of Turkish Islamist politics, had been banned from\n\npolitics in 1998. The ban was lifted in February 2003, and Erbakan is staging a\n\npolitical comeback. In recent years, his surrogates have led the Saadet (Felicity) Party\n\n(SP), which won only 2.5% of the vote in November 2002 and is not represented in\n\nparliament. Erbakan is expected to assume leadership of the SP shortly. He would\n\nprobably relish embarrassing the âdisloyalâ AKP leaders and may be trying to attract\n\ndisgruntled Islamist AKP deputies to SP. Party loyalties in Turkey are fluid, and SP\n\ncan gain immediate representation in parliament with AKP defectors. Erbakan\n\nreportedly warned deputies that they would âpay for it in the afterlifeâif they did not\n\ndefeat the resolution.4\n\nAKP leaders came to the issue of Iraq belatedly in mid-January. Much U.S.\n\ndiplomacy since summer 2002 had focused on the prior government. Although\n\nUndersecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and Undersecretary of State Marc\n\nGrossman visited Ankara to consult in early December 2002, less than a week after\n\nthe AKP took power, AKP leaders had other, imperative concerns. The AKPâs\n\nhighest priority was strengthening the countryâs domestic economic recovery after\n\nthe worst recession 50 years. The government proposed an urgent action plan and set\n\nout to reassure international investors and the International Monetary Fund. It also\n\nhad to deal with a December 12, 2002- European Union summit in Copenhagen and\n\nan end game in U.N. diplomacy to achieve a settlement for the 29-year division of\n\nthe island of Cyprus. The U.S. troop request stood behind these issues in the foreign\n\npolicy queue.\n\nThe Role of Turkeyâs President\n\nPresident Ahmet Necdet Sezer is a former chief judge of the Turkish\n\nConstitutional Court and an advocate for the rule of law as well as Turkish\n\nsecularism. He considers issues in a legalistic way, and has delayed AKP initiatives\n\nby exercising his right to veto legislation and delaying approval of government\n\nappointments. However, if parliament passes legislation a second time, unchanged,\n\nhe cannot veto it again. He can only let it stand or refer it to a national referendum\n\nor the Constitutional Court. Sezer vetoed the measures that parliament passed to\n\n3 âTurkish Vote Deals Blow to Government,â Financial Times, March 3, 2003.\n\n4 âErbakan Calculating,â Hurriyet, March 3, 2003, Foreign Broadcast Information Service\n\n(hereafter FBIS) Document GMP20030303000487.\n\nCRS-4\n\nlift the ban on Erdogan, but the President took no action when parliament passed\n\nthem again probably because a referendum would have been a costly way to achieve\n\nthe same, predictable result. Erdogan would undoubtedly have won a referendum.\n\nWith regard to the U.S. deployment of forces to Turkey, Sezer argued that the\n\nparliamentary resolution would be unconstitutional without âinternational\n\nlegitimacyâ to authorize the deployment of foreign forces in Turkey as required by\n\nArticle 92 of the Constitution. He said that a new U.N. resolution specifically\n\nauthorizing the use of force in Iraq, in addition to U.N. Security Council Resolution\n\n1441, November 8, 2002, would convey that legitimacy. The Turkish press gave\n\nSezerâs opinion wide coverage.5 After the war began, Sezer retained his legalistic\n\nperspective, maintaining, âThe United Nations Security Council process on Iraq\n\nshould have been allowed to finish. I do not find it right that the U.S. behaved\n\nunilaterally before that process ended.â6\n\nThe Role of the Military\n\nThe powerful Turkish military has identified Islamism and separatism as the\n\ngreatest threats to Turkey. (It had not considered Saddam Hussein to be a threat.)\n\nCommanders have indicated that they view the AKP and its predecessors as part of\n\nthe Islamist threat, while the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas are a threat\n\nto the countryâs territorial integrity. The Chief of Staff General Hilmi Ozkok\n\nrecognized the AKP election victory as an expression of the will of the people, but\n\nhe and other military leaders remained suspicious of the partyâs Islamist intentions\n\nand indicated that they would remain vigilant. The National Security Council (NSC),\n\nwhere nine civilian leaders and five military commanders get together to decide\n\nnational policy, met on February 28, 2003. AKP wanted the respected and popular\n\nmilitary to support its very unpopular position on the U.S. deployment. But the\n\ncommanders demurred, seeming to want the AKP leaders alone to be responsible for\n\nthe resolution. If the measure passed over popular opposition, AKPâs popularity\n\nmight decline. If it failed, the AKP would be weakened. Either way, some observers\n\npointed out, AKPâs image might be tarnished and the military would be pleased.\n\nAnother interpretation suggested that the commanders may have simply\n\nmiscalculated, having concluded that a party with control of two-thirds of parliament\n\nwould be able to pass its own resolution without their support.\n\nOn March 4, 2003, after the ramifications of the defeat of the resolution became\n\nclearer and its effect on the AKP had been felt, and after anti-Turk demonstrations\n\nby Iraqi Kurds, General Ozkok issued a statement explaining the Turkish armed\n\nforcesâ position. He said that National Security Council was not charged to advise\n\nparliament and pressuring parliament âwould not have been democratic.â7 Ozkok\n\n5 âSezer Notes Need for New U.N. Resolution,â NTV, February 18, 2003, FBIS Document\n\nGMP20030218000091.\n\n6 âTurkish President Casts Doubt on Overflight Rights,â Reuters, March 20, 2003.\n\n7 Statement by General Hilmi Ozkok, Parts I and II, NTV, March 5, 2003, FBIS Documents\n\nGMP20030305000088 and /92. As context, the European Union has urged Turkish civilian\n\n(continued...)\n\nCRS-5\n\nthen asserted that Turkey was not able to prevent the war on its own. âOur choice is\n\nbetween bad and worse.â If Turkey did not participate in the war, Ozkok said, it\n\nwould still sustain the same damages, but without compensation. However, if\n\nTurkey assisted in waging the war, part of its damages might be compensated, and\n\nthe war would be shorter, with less pain and suffering. So, Ozkok said that the\n\ngovernmentâs parliamentary motion to authorize U.S. forces had been in harmony\n\nwith the armed forcesâ reasoning. In other words, he supported the resolution after\n\nits defeat. He also laid a foundation for passage of a similar resolution if and when\n\nit were resubmitted. Immediately thereafter, politicians praised Ozkokâs statement\n\nand some members of parliament said that they would change their votes if the\n\nresolution was introduced again. Their rapid about face and remarks testified to the\n\ncontinuing, strong influence of the military in Turkish politics. However, AKP\n\nleaders decided on a course of damage control and not to resubmit the resolution.\n\nPublic Opinion and the Media\n\nAt about the time the U.S. Administration was preparing its requests for the new\n\ngovernment in Ankara, a November 2002 survey of Turkish opinion by the Pew\n\nResearch Center was published. It indicated that Turks opposed letting U.S. forces\n\nuse bases in Turkey for military action in Iraq by a margin of 83% to 13%. The\n\nsurvey further showed that pro-American perceptions in Turkey had dropped from\n\n52% in 1999-2000 to 30% in summer 2002. Moreover, 58% of Turks opposed the\n\nU.S. war on terrorism.8 Some viewed it as a war against Muslims.\n\nBy the time the Turkish government submitted the authorization resolution to\n\nparliament, opposition to the war had grown to 95% of the public, according to\n\nTurkeyâs Ambassador to the United States. Mass protests are uncommon in Turkey.\n\nYet, on the day of the vote, more than 50,000 anti-war demonstrators gathered\n\noutside parliament. These developments posed a challenge to the government, which\n\nhad focused almost exclusively on preventing a war and then on negotiating with the\n\nUnited States. It had not focused on preparing the public for the kind of support that\n\nit was willing to give to the United States. Some commentators argue that the\n\npublicâs animosity could have been more effectively addressed in U.S. efforts to\n\nconvince Ankara to provide that support. On the other hand, Undersecretary of\n\nDefense Paul Wolfowitz, one of the main U.S. interlocutors, delivered a well-\n\nreported speech on the Iraq problem in Istanbul and gave an in-depth interview to a\n\njournalist from a popular newspaper. He and other U.S. official visitors to Turkey\n\nalso held press conferences. Yet, some suspect that the Administration may not have\n\ntaken the pressure of public opinion into account sufficiently in its interactions with\n\n7 (...continued)\n\nleaders to exercise greater control over the military, and the military has heard these\n\nadmonitions. The NSC decides by consensus, but, traditionally, civilian leaders do not\n\noppose the militaryâs views. Much of the militaryâs influence is rooted in Turkeyâs culture\n\nand history.\n\n8 âTurkish People Sharply Opposed to U.S. Use of Air Bases Against Iraq,â New Survey\n\nSays, Associated Press, December 5, 2002. For more recent views documented in Pew\n\nsurveys, see [http://people-press.org/reports/print.php3?PageID=683].\n\nCRS-6\n\nTurkish politicians, on war plans, or in the size of the projected U.S. deployment to\n\nTurkey. (See below.)\n\nThe Turkish press helps form and express public opinion. It is controlled by a\n\nfew magnates, some of whom have anti-American tendencies. During the U.S-\n\nTurkish negotiations, the press depicted U.S. officials as bullies, further fueling anti-\n\nAmerican sentiment. Newspapers negatively described U.S. pressure for an accord\n\nas a great power trying to ride roughshod over a lesser one. They wrote about\n\nâbullyingâ and âthreateningâ U.S. tactics.9 The opposition newspaper Cumhurriyet\n\npresented what it claimed was the transcript of a February 14 meeting at which\n\nPresident Bush had allegedly âorderedâ the Turkish Foreign and Economic Ministers\n\nto go home and pass the resolution.10 Although the Foreign Ministry said that the\n\nreport was the product of imagination, the story gained a life of its own by repetition.\n\nThe media also reported on the presence of the flotilla of U.S. ships bearing military\n\nmateriel waiting off the Turkish coast since before the government submitted its\n\nresolution to parliament â as if confirming that the U.S. administration had taken\n\nTurkeyâs approval for granted. In other words, the press helped to transform the U.S.\n\nrequest into an issue of Turkish national honor.\n\nTurkeyâs Concerns about a War\n\nThe Turkish opposition to a war in Iraq and to the U.S. deployment stemmed\n\nfrom many deeply felt concerns. These include fear of the emergence of a Kurdish\n\nstate in northern Iraq; regard for the Iraqi Turkomans; the potential for economic\n\nlosses; dread of a humanitarian crisis in Iraq and along the Turkey-Iraq border; and\n\nconcern for effects on regional stability.\n\nIraqâs Territorial Integrity â The Kurdish Issue\n\nTurkey argues that the power vacuum in northern Iraq after the first Gulf war\n\nenabled the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) to find safe havens from which to\n\nescalate its insurgency in Turkey. The PKK is a guerrilla/terrorist group that waged\n\na war for independence or autonomy in Turkeyâs southeast from 1984-1999 â a war\n\nthat resulted in 30,000 deaths. Turkey feared that another war in Iraq would produce\n\na new power vacuum and the partition of Iraq. The birth of a Kurdish state in\n\nnorthern Iraq could then serve as a model for Turkish Kurdish separatists, whom\n\nmany Turks believe are still seeking their own state in southeast Turkey.11\n\n9 âTurkish Press Divided over Washingtonâs Opinion of Ankaraâs Bargaining Skills,â FBIS\n\nDocument GMP20030225000054.\n\n10 âIntimidation from Bush,â Cumhurriyet, February 25, 2003, FBIS Document\n\nGMP20030227000117.\n\n11 On April 4, 2002, the PKK renamed itself the Kurdistan Freedom and Democracy\n\nCongress (KADEK) and elected PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan as KADEK general chairman\n\nin absentia. (Ocalan was tried and sentenced to death for treason; but his sentence was\n\nchanged to life without parole after Turkey abolished the death penalty.) KADEK\n\n(continued...)\n\nCRS-7\n\nAfter the Gulf war, Turkey allowed U.S. and British planes flying from Incirlik\n\nAir Base to enforce a no-fly zone over northern Iraq (Operation Provide\n\nComfort/Operation Northern Watch) to protect Iraqâs Kurds from Saddam Hussein\n\nand to monitor his armed forces. Turkey developed a tenuous modus vivendi with\n\nthe two main Iraqi Kurdish groups, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the\n\nPatriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), but never trusted their assurances that they do\n\nnot want an independent state. Turkish officials acknowledge that the Iraqi Kurds\n\nhave a de facto state in northern Iraq, with institutions and infrastructure. But they\n\ndo not want the Iraqi Kurds to take additional steps toward de jure independence.\n\nTurkeyâs anxiety about possible Iraqi Kurdish statehood increased as an\n\nAmerican military campaign appeared more likely. Some in Ankara suggest that the\n\nprobability of war emboldened the Iraqi Kurds to take advantage of what they\n\nperceive to be the U.S. need for their assistance. Tensions surfaced between Turkey\n\nand the KDP in August 2002 over the latterâs draft constitution to establish a federal\n\nIraq in which the Kurds would have greater autonomy and control of oil-rich\n\nKirkuk.12 In reaction, Turkey closed the Habur border gate, cutting the KDPâs\n\nrevenue sources by restricting the semi-illicit flow of diesel fuel from northern Iraq\n\ninto Turkey.13 The former Turkish Defense Minister claimed that Turkey has historic\n\nrights in northern Iraq, and to its oil resources, dating from 1920.14\n\nThe KDPâs official newspaper responded by threatening to turn northern Iraq\n\ninto âa graveyardâ for Turkish soldiers if they intervened, provoking angry reactions\n\nfrom Turkish civilian and military officials and media.15 To end this war of words\n\nand repair bilateral relations, KDP leader Massoud Barzani and other KDP officials\n\n11 (...continued)\n\nspokesmen contended that the armed struggle was over, and that they sought to resolve\n\nissues only by the âdemocratizationâ of Turkey, without changing borders of the countries\n\nin the region. Turkish Kurds currently seek increased cultural and language rights and\n\nfreedom to participate politically as a party. Turkish officials believe that the PKK/KADEK\n\nchange is tactical and that separatism remains the goal. On February 13, 2003, because of\n\nwhat it said was the Turkish stateâs failure to respond to its peace initiative and to its\n\ntreatment of Abdullah Ocalan, KADEK called an end to its unilateral cease-fire and urged\n\na new uprising.\n\n12 Kirkuk is now controlled by the Baghdad government and is not part of the Kurdish\n\nautonomous area created in 1991. Its population is ethnically mixed: Arabs, Kurds,\n\nTurkomans.\n\n13 The United Nations and United States waive sanctions on Turkey for the illicit energy\n\ntraffic because it aids both Turkey and the Iraqi Kurds.\n\n14 This was before the emergence of the Turkish Republic and failed to recognize a 1926\n\nTurkish-British agreement giving the Ottoman Mosul Vilayet (province), including Kirkuk,\n\nto Iraq, which was under a British mandate at the time. Other Turkish officials maintained\n\nthat the Ministerâs comments should have been viewed in the context of his defense of Iraqi\n\nTurkomans.\n\n15 âTurkish Daily Notes KDP Official Postponed Visit Fearing Ankaraâs Reaction,â\n\nHurriyet, August 23, 2002, translation entered into FBIS online, August 25, 2002; Turkish\n\n(Foreign) ministry says Iraqi Kurd leaderâs words âaggressive,â Anatolia News Agency,\n\nBBC-Monitoring Europe, September 6, 2002.\n\nCRS-8\n\nrepeatedly affirmed their commitment to Iraqâs territorial integrity and assurances for\n\nTurkeyâs national security and sovereignty.16 Yet, on September 25, the KDP and\n\nPUK agreed to a revised version of Barzaniâs draft constitution for a federal zone in\n\nnorthern Iraq, with Kirkuk as its capital, to present to other Iraqi opposition groups.\n\nNot until February 2003, probably with U.S. prodding, did the Iraqi Kurds agree\n\nto participate in a postwar Iraqi government with other members of the Iraqi\n\nopposition and not to take Mosul and Kirkuk. They thereby signaled that they do not\n\nhave an immediate intention to declare their independence.\n\nTurkey remained uneasy and acted accordingly. In the 1990s, Turkish forces\n\nhad made regular incursions into northern Iraq in âhot pursuitâ of the PKK, and at\n\nleast 5,000 Turkish troops remained there ostensibly to control activities of the PKK,\n\nbut also as a warning to Iraqi Kurds. In anticipation of a war, Turkey increased its\n\nmilitary presence in northern Iraq and greatly strengthened its forces on the border.\n\nThe role of Turkish forces in northern Iraq during a war was a critical part of U.S.-\n\nTurkish negotiations for a U.S. troop deployment to Turkey and subsequently. (See\n\nbelow.) At one point, U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad claimed that Turkish forces in\n\nIraq would operate under U.S. command, prompting denials from the Turkish\n\nmilitary and outrage in the Turkish media. Eventually, Khalilzad spoke instead about\n\nU.S. and Turkish military âcoordination.â\n\nAs details of the proposed U.S.-Turkish arrangement surfaced and appeared to\n\nfavor Turkey, the Iraqi Kurds reacted. On March 1, 2003, Barzani voiced the Iraqi\n\noppositionâs rejection of a âmilitary intervention by the Turkish army in Iraqi\n\nKurdistan.â17 Other KDP officials predicted clashes between Kurds and Turks if\n\nthere were a Turkish incursion. The KDP sent militia (pesh merga) to the border.\n\nDemonstrators burned the Turkish flag and made anti-Turkish speeches.\n\nOnce again, however, the Iraqi Kurds evidently perceived that it was not in their\n\ninterest to provoke Turkey. PUK âPrime Ministerâ Barham Salih visited Ankara to\n\ncalm tension, encourage Turkey to work with the U.N. High Commissioner for\n\nRefugees on preventing a humanitarian crisis, and discourage unilateral acts by the\n\nTurkish military. He seemed satisfied that Turkey had no intention of occupying\n\nnorthern Iraq.18 On March 8, the KDP Council of Ministers condemned âthe\n\nbehavior of some ignorant people who insulted the Turkish flagâ and said that the\n\nculprits had been arrested. It also voiced respect for âmutual interestsâ with Turkey.19\n\nConsultations among Turks, Iraqi Kurds, and U.S. representatives continued.\n\n16 âDialogue Can Resolve Problems Between Turkey, Iraqi Kurd Group-leader,â Anatolia\n\nNews Agency, BBC-Monitoring Europe, September 10, 2002.\n\n17 âU.S. Vows to Keep Turks on Leash in Iraq,â Reuters, March 1, 2003.\n\n18 âSalih Received Guarantee from Turkey,â NTV, March 7, 2003, FBIS Document\n\nGMP20030307000094.\n\n19 âA Statement by the Council of Ministersâ of KDP, Brayati, March 8, 2003, BBC\n\nMonitoring Middle East-Political, March 10, 2003.\n\nCRS-9\n\nNonetheless, the situation remained tense. On March 10, soon-to-be Turkish\n\nPrime Minister Erdogan confirmed that the Turkish armed forces had sent 50,000\n\ntroops to the border with Iraq and were continuing to deploy troops there. Large\n\nquantities of Turkish military materiel were shipped to the area.\n\nTurkomans20\n\nProbably in part to balance Iraqi Kurdish momentum toward autonomy, Turkey\n\nhas championed the rights of Iraqi Turkomans, who reside alongside the Kurds in\n\nnorthern Iraq. Turkomans are ethnic/linguistic relatives of the Turks. The Turkish\n\ngovernment and Turkoman leaders recognized by Ankara claim that there are three\n\nmillion Iraqi Turkomans, although most sources cite far lower figures.21 Historically,\n\nthe Turkomansâ relations with other ethnic groups in the region have been troubled.\n\nTurkey favors the Ankara-based Iraqi Turkoman Front, which calls for a unitary state\n\nin Iraq or a regionally, not ethnically, based federal government. Turkey seeks\n\nassurances that the Turkomans will be fairly represented in a postwar Iraqi\n\ngovernment. It became angry when the Iraqi opposition named a leadership council\n\nwithout a Turkoman representative.\n\nOf relevance to Turkeyâs interests is the residence of many Turkomans in\n\nKirkuk, an oil-rich region. Turkey does not want the oil to finance an Iraqi Kurdish\n\nstate. In the event of a U.S. military operation against Iraq, some analysts suggested\n\nthat Turkey would use its concern for its ethnic relatives, the Turkomans, as a pretext\n\nto intervene and prevent the Iraqi Kurds from controlling the oil reserves.22 Turkish\n\nForeign Ministry officials denied such designs and claimed that they would not\n\ninterfere in Iraqâs internal affairs. They compared their concern for the Turkomans\n\nto their feelings for Bulgarian Turks under communist rule, and said that they only\n\nwanted to see Turkomans similarly represented in a democratic Iraq.23 The same\n\nmistrust of Turkeyâs alleged territorial ambitions was expressed during the first Gulf\n\nwar; the inaction of Turkeyâs military then seemed to prove suspicions groundless.\n\nThe Iraqi Kurds agreed with the U.S. position that Iraqâs oil assets belong to the\n\nentire Iraqi nation. There was concern, however, that the lack of a northern front from\n\nTurkey would prevent the insertion of sufficient U.S. forces in northern Iraq to secure\n\n20 Sometimes referred to as Turcoman and Turkmen. The latter usage, however, could be\n\nconfused with the inhabitants of Turkmenistan.\n\n21 Some sources estimate that Turkomans constitute about 1.4% of the Iraqi population and\n\nprobably number about 330,000. According to one source, there are about 1.5 million\n\nTurkomans in the Middle East, residing in Iraq, Iran, and Turkey. Colbert C. Held, Middle\n\nEast Patterns: Places, Peoples, and Politics, Boulder, Colorado, Westview Press, 2000, p.\n\n104. The CIA World Factbook 2002 says that Turkomans, Assyrians, and other non-Arab,\n\nnon-Kurdish Iraqis together make up 5% of a national population of 24 million. Iraqâs\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz suggested Turkeyâs Turkoman claims were âexaggeratedâ\n\nduring a visit to Turkey in September 2002.\n\n22 âTurkoman Bargaining,â Sabah, July 23, 2002, translation entered into FBIS online, July\n\n23, 2002.\n\n23 Analogy by Undersecretary of the Foreign Ministry Ugur Ziyal at The Washington\n\nInstitute for Near East Policy, August 28, 2002.\n\nCRS-10\n\nKirkuk, prevent Iraqi Kurds from returning to their former homes there, and stop\n\nSaddam Husseinâs sabotaging the oil fields.\n\nEconomic Factors\n\nTurkeyâs opposition to a war against Iraq also was motivated by economic\n\nconcerns. Before the first Gulf war, Turkey closed its border with Iraq, then one of\n\nits major trading partners, and abided by international sanctions. Turks estimate the\n\ncost of the closure at $30 billion to $100 billion, and argue that the international\n\ncommunity never compensated them for their losses.24 Others, however, suggest that\n\nthis view fails to account for the willingness of international financial institutions to\n\nprovide ample assistance during Turkeyâs financial crises, despite Turkeyâs history\n\nof poor governance and failed economic reform programs. Furthermore, as a result\n\nof the U.N.âs humanitarian âoil-for-foodâ program begun in December 1996 and of\n\nthe semi-illicit trade in diesel and crude oil, bilateral Iraqi-Turkish trade totaled about\n\n$1 billion annually. The two neighbors had hoped to reach pre-Gulf war trade levels\n\nof about $2.5 billion annually. Turkey did not want this positive trend reversed.\n\nTurkish officials and others feared a war might inflict rising oil prices, loss of\n\nforeign investment, collapse of the vital tourism sector, closure of the oil pipeline\n\nfrom Iraq to Turkeyâs Mediterranean coast, and loss of border and other bilateral\n\ntrade. Achievement of the goals of a painful economic reform program Turkey has\n\nundertaken also might be set back. Turkey generally did not contemplate the\n\npossibility that its economic cost from a war might be diminished if a northern front\n\nfrom its territory led to a shorter war. Nor did it assess benefits that might accrue\n\nfrom normal economic relations with a post-Saddam Iraq because they were seen as\n\nuncertain long term prospects, while Turkey had many immediate needs in the\n\naftermath of an impoverishing recession.\n\nHumanitarian Issues\n\nTurkey notes that the first Gulf war created a mass exodus of hundreds of\n\nthousands of Iraqi Kurds to Turkey and a humanitarian crisis of enormous\n\nproportions for which it was unprepared. Turks believe that their response to the\n\ncrisis was unjustly criticized. In the event of a second war, Turkey had contingency\n\nplans to establish camps for refugees on the Iraqi side of the border as well as at\n\nseveral sites in southeast Turkey.25\n\n24 Commentators note that Turks sometimes seem to attribute all of their financial woes to\n\nthe consequences of the Gulf war, and to ignore the effects of repeated financial\n\nmismanagement by a succession of governments in the 1990s.\n\n25 The plans reportedly were shelved weeks into the war, after it became clear that there\n\nwould be no refugee crisis. âTurkey scraps Refugee Camp Plans,â Financial Times, April\n\n4, 2003.\n\nCRS-11\n\nRegional Stability\n\nTurkey is concerned about the potential for postwar regional instability,\n\nincluding the unleashing of now latent interethnic and religious disputes and a\n\nworsening of the Israeli-Arab conflict. Ankara, like most governments in the region,\n\npreferred the United States to give priority to solving the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.\n\nProposed Bilateral Arrangements for the U.S.\n\nDeployment of Troops\n\nDiplomacy\n\nThe U.S. Administration began its campaign to gain Turkeyâs support for a war\n\nin Iraq in mid-2002, when the previous Turkish government was in power. U.S.\n\nofficials closely and frequently courted and consulted their Turkish counterparts.\n\nSecretary of State Colin Powell, Undersecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz,\n\nUndersecretary of State Marc Grossman, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld,\n\nand National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice were all active. Vice President Dick\n\nCheney spoke to Undersecretary of the Foreign Ministry Ugur Ziyal on videophone\n\nduring the latterâs visit to Washington in August 2002. Such high level meetings\n\nwith an undersecretary are beyond the dictates of normal diplomatic protocol, but\n\nZiyal is one of the ministryâs experts on the Middle East and the Turkish General\n\nStaff Chief of Plans was in his delegation. When Secretary Powell saluted the Iraqi\n\nKurdish parliament on October 4, 2002, he claimed that the Iraqi Kurds shared the\n\nU.S. vision for a âdemocratic, pluralistic, united Iraqâ with its âterritorial integrity\n\nintact.â U.S. officials also assured the Turks of U.S. opposition to Kurdish control\n\nof Mosul and Kirkuk and stated that the oil resources would be controlled by the\n\nfuture central Iraqi government.\n\nPresident Bush conferred via the telephone with President Sezer in October\n\n2002. On December 11, President Bush met AKP leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan at\n\nthe White House. Because Erdogan, at the time, was not a head of state or of\n\ngovernment, the meeting was considered highly unusual and boosted Erdoganâs\n\nstature and legitimacy. Some analysts would later suggest that the meeting also made\n\nthe AKP believe that Turkey was indispensable to a U.S. military operation.26 On\n\nFebruary 14, 2003, President Bush met Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis and Minister\n\nof State for the Economy Ali Babacan at the White House. Secretary of State Powell\n\nmet with the two Turkish ministers at length at his home to discuss the U.S. aid offer.\n\nOn February 19, the Secretary telephoned Prime Minister Gul to urge finalization of\n\nan agreement, but Gul chose to wait until after a Muslim holiday. They subsequently\n\nspoke after the March 1 defeat of the resolution, when President Bush and Vice\n\nPresident Cheney also urged Gul and Erdogan to reconsider.\n\n26 The AKP Government has not Perceived the Situation with Regard to Iraq Yet, Milliyet,\n\nMarch 24, 2003, FBIS Document GMP20030325000062.\n\nCRS-12\n\nUndersecretary Wolfowitz appears to have been most active. Attempting to\n\nassuage concerns while in Turkey in July 2002, he declared that a separate Kurdish\n\nstate in northern Iraq was unacceptable to the United States.27 Wolfowitz and\n\nUndersecretary of State Marc Grossman returned to Turkey on December 4, when\n\nWolfowitz gave an extensive interview to a popular Turkish journalist to publicly\n\nprovide assurances. He said that he had discussed with Turkish authorities âWhat\n\nshould we do in order to guarantee that an independent Kurdish state is not\n\nestablished in north Iraq after the Saddam regime falls? It is necessary to ensure that\n\nthe central government in Iraq continues to control the national assets of the\n\ncountry....â âOur goal is to safeguard the territorial integrity of Iraq....â He added.\n\nâIf we can liberate the Iraqi people, Turkeyâs real reward will be having a democratic,\n\nprosperous neighbor ....â He expressed a preference for a âcoordinated effortâ among\n\nTurkey, the Iraqi Kurds, and the United States, but said that he had received\n\nassurances that if Turkey acts in northern Iraq, âthis will not be an invasion, but will\n\nrather be certain temporary measures to defend Turkeyâs interests.â He also tried to\n\nconvince his interlocutors of the need for a âconvincing threat not only from the\n\nsouth, but also from the northâ to increase the chance of a peaceful solution or, if that\n\nis not possible, of the importance of rapid and decisive use of force.28 Wolfowitz\n\nargued that it would be better for Turkey to act to protect its interests in northern Iraq\n\nas part of a coalition rather than alone.\n\nThe U.S. military also consulted their Turkish counterparts closely. Commander\n\nof the U.S. Central Command General Tommy Franks, responsible for Iraq, and\n\nNATO Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and Commander of the U.S. European\n\nCommand General Joseph Ralston met Chief of the Turkish General Staff General\n\nHilmi Ozkok and other officers in Ankara on October 21, 2002, for âcollaboration,\n\nconsultation, and discussion.â General Ozkok visited the United States, November\n\n4-10, and met Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and others in Washington and General\n\nFranks at CENTCOM headquarters in Tampa. The Deputy Director of Central\n\nIntelligence and a large delegation visited the Turkish General Staff on November 13,\n\nand then went to Incirlik Air Base. On January 20, 2003, Chairman of the Joint\n\nChiefs of Staff General Richard Myers visited his Turkish counterpart. A week later\n\nthe new NATO military commander, General James Jones, came to call.\n\nSpecific negotiations for the U.S. deployment of forces were conducted by the\n\nTurkish Foreign Ministry and the Department of State. The gist of several tentative\n\nagreements, derived from statements of officials and media reports, is summarized\n\nbelow. The accords were voided after Turkey failed to approve the U.S. troop\n\ndeployment.\n\nAfter the failure of the negotiations, former Foreign Minister Yasir Yakis\n\nadmitted that the Turkish government had miscalculated. He said that it believed that\n\nthe United States depended on Turkish support to set up a northern front and that\n\nprotracted negotiations would only strengthen the Turkish position. In the end, he\n\n27 âAA Details Wolfowitz Address at TESEV Meet on US-Turkish Relations,â Ankara\n\nAnatolia in English, 15 July 02, entered into FBIS online, July 15, 2002.\n\n28 Sedat Ergin, Interview, Hurriyet, December 5, 2002, FBIS Document\n\nGMP20021205000151.\n\nCRS-13\n\nconcluded, the prolongation of negotiations worked to Turkeyâs disadvantage as the\n\nUnited States shifted to alternative military plans. The government, he conceded, had\n\nmade a âvery serious strategic mistake.â29\n\nU.S. Forces\n\nSince the aftermath of World War I, when allied powers attempted to carry out\n\nan occupation and partition of Anatolia, Turks have been wary of the presence of\n\nforeign forces on their soil. During the height of the Cold War, the United States\n\nhad 25,000 troops based in Turkey. During the first Gulf war, the United States used\n\nTurkish air space and air bases to launch strikes against Iraq, but it did not seek a\n\nground presence or to open a northern front. At the time, Turkey closed its border\n\nwith Iraq and deployed its forces to the border, which held Iraqi troops in the north\n\nwhile the war was being fought in the south. After 1991, as part of Operation Provide\n\nComfort/Operation Northern Watch, about 2,500 U.S. forces participated in the allied\n\neffort enforcing a no-fly zone over northern Iraq.\n\nThe Bush Administration reportedly initially requested permission to deploy\n\n80,000 plus troops to Turkey.30 In view of Turkish sensitivities, the size of U.S.\n\ntroop request related to a new war was controversial. Turkey initially countered the\n\nrequest with an offer to welcome 15,000 troops. The Defense Department deemed\n\nthis insufficient to open a northern front and negotiations continued. The\n\nunsuccessful resolution that the AKP submitted to parliament on February 25, 2003,\n\nand that was defeated on March 1, would have authorized the United States to deploy\n\n62,000 troops, 255 warplanes, and 65 helicopters for a period of six months.\n\nSite Surveys/Base Modernization\n\nIn December 2002, the Turkish government had authorized negotiations to begin\n\non a U.S. site survey of Turkish military bases and ports â to assess their capacity and\n\nthe need for upgrades to accommodate American planes and forces. Legal issues\n\ndelayed negotiations. Turkey wanted the status or rights granted the surveyors to be\n\na precedent for U.S. troops to be deployed in country later, and for Turkish law to\n\napply to them. It argued that, since the survey was not a NATO mission, the NATO\n\nStatus of Forces Agreement, under which U.S. forces are subject to U.S. law, should\n\nnot apply. The Turkish position was adopted, and the surveys began on January 13,\n\n2003. The U.S. reportedly requested use of nine airbases/airports, including airbases\n\nat Batman, Diyarbakir, and Incirlik, and ports at Mersin and Iskenderun. On February\n\n6, the Turkish parliament voted to allow the United States to upgrade bases at a\n\nreported cost of $200 million to $300 million.31 On February 6, the Turkish\n\nparliament approved the deployment of about 3,500 U.S. technical and military\n\npersonnel in Turkey for three months to undertake renovation, development, and\n\n29 âSensational Confession,â Sabah, March 21, 2003, FBIS Document,\n\nGMP20030321000096.\n\n30 âTurkey, U.S. Near Accord on Deployment,â Washington Post, January 17, 2003.\n\n31 The Defense Department is probably using funds already appropriated for this work.\n\nCRS-14\n\nconstruction of bases and ports. The U.S. Department contracted with Turkish\n\ncompanies to undertake the work, which began on February 13.\n\nUnder the mandate of the agreement on modernizing bases, U.S. forces off-\n\nloaded military vehicles and equipment at Incirlik and other air bases and at the ports\n\nof Mersin and Iskenderun, and moved them to staging sites in southeast Turkey, not\n\nfar from the Iraqi border.32 Some U.S. troops may have quietly moved into Iraq.\n\nAfter arrangements were limited to U.S. use of Turkish airspace, much equipment\n\nwas withdrawn from southeast Turkey for shipment to Kuwait. Some of it remained\n\nto be used for search and rescue operations and refugee relief. In early April, Turkey\n\npermitted 204 U.S. Humvee all-terrain light vehicles to cross into Iraq.\n\n32 Film of truck convoys was shown on CNN Turk and NTV in Turkey, and on The News\n\nHour with Jim Lehrer, March 12, 2003.\n\nCRS-15\n\nFinances33\n\nTurkeyâs highest priority was obtaining protection against the economic impact\n\nof a war. As noted above, Turkey is recovering from its worst recession in more than\n\n50 years and has sought to ensure that progress under an International Monetary\n\nFund-supervised reform program is not set back by losses in its critical tourism\n\nsector, higher oil prices, and other difficulties. Some in Turkey had hoped for a very\n\nlarge aid package.\n\nOn March 6, 2003, Secretary of State Powell confirmed that the total cost to the\n\nU.S. treasury of the offered assistance would have been $6 billion. Turkeyâs Minister\n\nof State for Economy Ali Babacan provided some details to the press. The package\n\nincluded $2 billion in military assistance and $4 billion in economic assistance.34\n\nThe $4 billion in economic aid could be leveraged to obtain $24 billion in loan\n\nguarantees, i.e., private loans at lower interest rates. Furthermore, the United States\n\nwould provide a âbridge loanâ of $8.5 billion immediately (from the U.S. Treasuryâs\n\nExchange Stability Fund), which Turkey would repay out of the $24 billion in private\n\nloans.35 The Turkish government could use the longer term, lower interest\n\nguaranteed loans to replace short term, higher interest, domestic debt and thereby\n\nimprove its debt management considerably.36 Turkey has heavy loan payments due\n\nthroughout 2003. The Turkish government reluctantly agreed to U.S. conditions that\n\nwould tie disbursement of funds to continued adherence to the IMF program. The\n\nU.S. demand for these conditions resulted from Turkeyâs history of fiscal indiscipline\n\nand concern that the AKP might spend the funds profligately to fulfill campaign\n\npromises.\n\nMilitary Understandings\n\nUnder proposals reportedly made during U.S.-Turkish negotiations, Turkish and\n\nU.S. forces would have coordinated their moves in northern Iraq through liaison\n\nofficers. Turkish forces were to have entered northern Iraq shortly after U.S. troops\n\n33 After the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, the Administration resumed foreign aid for\n\nTurkey, which had been mostly discontinued in 1998 as part of a policy of âaid\n\ngraduation,âwith $20 million from the Emergency Response Fund. The United States also\n\nprovided $28 million in military aid and $200 million in economic assistance as part of a\n\nFY2002 supplemental appropriation, largely to support Turkeyâs command of the\n\nInternational Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. For FY2003, Turkey was to\n\nreceive $17.5 million in foreign military financing (FMF) and $2.8 million in international\n\nmilitary education and training funds (IMET). For FY2004, the Administration has\n\nrequested $50 million in FMF, $200 million in economic support funds (ESF), and $5\n\nmillion in IMET. Since 1999, the United States, as the largest contributor to the\n\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), has helped Turkey obtain $31 billion in IMF loans.\n\n34 Turkeyâs $12 billion military wish list for the next decade includes helicopters,\n\nsubmarines, frigates, and other materiel.

Turks claimed\n\nthat their primary purpose was humanitarian â to secure the border and prevent an\n\ninflux of refugees. Iraq Kurdish leaders denied the possibility of a refugee crisis,\n\nalthough international and non-governmental organizations had prepared for one.\n\nTurks also wanted to protect the Iraqi Turkomans, and prevent of remnants of the\n\nPKK in northern Iraq, perhaps numbering a few thousand, from taking advantage of\n\nwartime chaos to infiltrate Turkey.\n\nAlthough Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis averred that Turkish troops would\n\nâneverâ try to occupy the oil regions of Mosul or Kirkuk,38 it was widely believed\n\nthat, should U.S. forces fail to do so, the Turkish military would act to prevent the\n\nIraqi Kurds from declaring independence and from seizing Kirkuk and other oil-rich\n\nsites that could fund a state. For humanitarian purposes alone, 40,000 Turkish\n\ntroops probably would not have been needed. Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul said\n\nthat Turkish officers would be present during the U.S. distribution of arms to and\n\nlater collection of arms from the Iraqi Kurds.39 Turkey did not want to see the\n\nweapons fall into the hands of the PKK/KADEK or be used to defend a Kurdish\n\nstate. This provision especially angered the Iraqi Kurds, who said that their militia\n\nwill be integrated into a new Iraqi army and not be disarmed.\n\nPolitical\n\nTurkey wanted written U.S. assurances to safeguard the territorial integrity and\n\nnational unity of Iraq, i.e., that an independent Kurdish state would not emerge in\n\nnorthern Iraq. The United States reportedly promised Turkey that it would be\n\nrepresented at final negotiations for a postwar Iraqi government to protect the\n\ninterests of the Turkomans, and presumably of Turkey.\n\nTrade\n\nThe United States has repeatedly promised Turkey enhanced trade, but Turks\n\nbelieve that the promise has not been fulfilled. In early 2002, the Bush\n\nAdministration proposed the establishment of qualified industrial zones (QIZs) as\n\npart of the U.S.-Israel Free Trade Area.40 QIZs are multilateral trade zones in which\n\ngoods are produced for export to the U.S. market that benefit from tariff relief. In\n\nJune 2002, H.R. 5002 and S. 2663 were introduced to authorize QIZs, but specified\n\n37 Mehmet Ali Birand interview of Erdogan, Anatolia, February 26, 2003, FBIS Document\n\nGMP20020226000245, âU.S. Assures Turkey on Kurds,â Washington Post, February 27,\n\n2003, âTurkey Has a Lot at Stake,â Turkish Daily News, March 3, 2003.\n\n38 âU.S. and Turkey Reach Accord to Let G.I.âs Establish a Base,â New York Times,\n\nFebruary 22, 2003.\n\n39 âUnderstanding Reached on Military Issues,â NTV, February 27, 2003, FBIS Document\n\nGMP20030227000044.\n\n40 See CRS Report RS21458, Turkey: Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZs) â Issues and\n\nEconomic Implications, by (name redacted).\n\nCRS-17\n\nthat Turkeyâs major exports of textiles, apparel, and leather goods would not be\n\neligible for the exemption from duties for goods produced in the QIZs.41 The Turks\n\nwere unhappy with these exceptions. The legislation was incorporated into H.R.\n\n5385, Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 2002, agreed to in the\n\nHouse on October 7, 2002. The Senate did not act on the legislation before the 107th\n\nCongress adjourned.\n\nAs partial compensation for Turkeyâs agreement to the deployment of U.S.\n\ntroops, the Administration reportedly proposed allowing the Pentagon to buy\n\nTurkish-made apparel for U.S. troops for one-year, waiving âBuy Americanâ\n\nrequirements. Turkey also would have been allowed to increase its duty-free exports\n\nof clothing above the present quota for goods made with American yarn and fabrics.42\n\nActual Arrangements for Access to\n\nAirspace and Other Issues\n\nThe war began on March 19, without agreement on the various arrangements\n\nnoted above. Therefore, no northern front against Iraq via Turkish territory opened\n\nand the United States withdrew its offer of aid. Days earlier, a dozen U.S. ships with\n\nmissile-launching capabilities moved away from Turkeyâs coast to the Red Sea.\n\nSome 36 additional ships, carrying military materiel for the 4th Infantry Division\n\nwhich was to open the northern front, subsequently moved from Turkeyâs coast\n\ntoward Kuwait.\n\nAirspace\n\nOn March 13, President Bush sent a letter congratulating Erdogan on his\n\nelection and requesting access to Turkeyâs airspace in the event of a war. Vice\n\nPresident Cheney then spoke to Erdogan requesting fast action on the request.\n\nTurkish officials determined that only parliament could grant the permission but\n\ndelayed action because, they said, they needed time to overcome the negative\n\natmosphere left after the March 1 vote. Foreign Minister Gul reportedly tried to\n\nrevive some of the arrangements previously negotiated, but Washington was no\n\nlonger interested. Secretary of State Powell emphasized that the United States was\n\nonly interested in airspace, and he telephoned Gul several times, pressing the issue.\n\nState Department spokesman Richard Boucher observed that âoverflights are\n\n41 Over 57% of Turkeyâs exports are textiles and leather goods, leading some Turks to argue\n\nthat proposed QIZs have limited value. They assert that the U.S. emphasis on using the\n\nQIZs for high tech products would not spur needed short term economic growth since, they\n\nmaintain, the tech sector provides only a very small quantity of exports to the United States\n\nand its products are already subject to minimal tariffs, Are the Qualified Industrial Zones\n\nBeing Used as a Carrot for a Military Operation?

So we would\n\nexpect that to be handled in that manner.â43 Even France and Germany, which\n\nstrongly opposed to use of force against Iraq, had granted access to their airspace.\n\nOn March 19, the Turkish parliament, by a vote of 332 to 202, with one\n\nabstention, authorized U.S. access to 11 Turkish air corridors for six months and the\n\ndeployment of Turkish troops abroad. U.S. aircraft based on carriers in the eastern\n\nMediterranean and in Europe acquired a more direct route to Iraq. However, even\n\nafter the motion was passed, the Turkish government did not immediately open its\n\nairspace. It reportedly wanted information on the number, frequency, nature, and\n\nload of overflights â information that the United States considered beyond the\n\ndemands of safety. Turkish officials also tried to tie the issue to U.S. agreement to\n\nthe deployment of Turkish troops to northern Iraq. The Administration resisted this\n\nconditionality. Only on March 21 did Turkey open its airspace without condition,\n\nand separately reserved the right to deploy its forces. Turkey was the last NATO\n\nmember to grant the United States access to its airspace. It granted the same access\n\nto the United Kingdom.\n\nTurkeyâs airspace was used by armed Tomahawk missiles, U.S. Navy B-2\n\nbombers, and U.S. planes that airlifted the 173rd Airborne Brigade paratroopers who\n\njumped into northern Iraq. Three Tomahawks fell short of their targets and onto\n\nTurkish territory without causing casualties. Missile-firing was suspended on March\n\n27, pending investigation.\n\nTurkish Troops in Northern Iraq\n\nThe government motion submitted to parliament on March 19 justified the\n\ndeployment of Turkish troops to northern Iraq as a âdissuasiveâ action, due to threats\n\nto Turkeyâs security from âacceleratedâ acts of the PKK, risks to Iraqâs territorial\n\nintegrity, an âenvironment of instabilityâ that may threaten the safety of other\n\nnational groups in the region, i.e., the Turkomans.44\n\nThere was considerable confusion about Turkeyâs intentions and actions, as well\n\nas concern that Turkish forces would enter northern Iraq without a prior agreement\n\nwith the United States. U.S. officials feared that a unilateral Turkish action might\n\ndisrupt the U.S. military campaign, spark clashes between Turks and Kurds, and\n\nprovoke similar acts by Syria and Iran. On March 20, Prime Minister Erdogan told\n\na Washington Post writer that he thought that the arrangement between the United\n\nStates and Turkey for Turkish forces in northern Iraq was âapproximately the sameâ\n\nas the agreement reached in the protracted negotiations discussed in Military\n\nUnderstandings, above.45 Yet, U.S. officials denied that there was an agreement,\n\n43 State Department press briefing, March 19, 2003.\n\n44 âTurkish Motion on U.S. Use of Airspace Refers to Security Threats,â Anatolia News\n\nAgency, BBC Monitoring Newsfile, March 20, 2003\n\n45 âQ&A: Turkeyâs Recep Tayyip Erdogan On Overflights and Understandings,â\n\n(continued...)\n\nCRS-19\n\nand negotiations continued. On March 23, Turkeyâs Ambassador to the United States\n\nhoped that the issue would be resolved in âdays.â He stated, âWe reserve both the\n\noption and intention of sending troops into northern Iraq. But we have to do this in\n\nconsultation with the U.S. administration, and hopefully with its consent.â46\n\nThe U.S. Administration communicated its position clearly and repeatedly.\n\nState Department spokesman Boucher said that the United States remained opposed\n\nto any military action that was not under coalition control and to unilateral action by\n\nTurkey or by any party in northern Iraq.47 Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld noted that\n\nTurkish forces already go in and out of northern Iraq. With regard to a possibly\n\nincreased Turkish troop deployment, however, he stated, âwe have advised the\n\nTurkish government and the Turkish armed forces that it would be notably unhelpful\n\nif they went into the north in large numbers.â48 On March 23, President Bush said,\n\nâWeâre making it very clear to the Turks that we expect them not to come into\n\nnorthern Iraq. Weâre in constant touch with the Turkish military, as well as Turkish\n\npoliticians. They know our policy ... and they know weâre working with the Kurds\n\nto make sure thereâs no incident that would cause there to be an excuse to go into\n\nnorthern Iraq.â49 Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Myers said that the\n\nU.S. government policy was that âTurkish forces should not go into northern Iraq,\n\nother than to support refugee flows.... [W]e have not seen those flows, and therefore\n\nthereâs no need at this point for Turkish forces to go in there.â He added that the\n\nTurkish general staff had been very cooperative and that forces in the region, not just\n\nthe Turkish forces, would conduct joint liaison activities to make sure that there is\n\nnot miscommunication or misperception of what each force is doing.50\n\nGeneral Myers probably was referring to the result of U.S. special envoy\n\nZalmay Khalilzadâs negotiations with eight Iraqi opposition groups, including Kurds\n\nand Turkomans, and the Turks. On March 18, Khalilzad claimed that the Kurds had\n\nagreed that their forces would operate âunder the command and control of coalition\n\ncommanders.â51 He also said that the United States would be responsible for\n\nsecuring Kirkuk and Mosul. Turkey agreed to participate in a âmechanismâ or\n\nstanding committee in which Turks, Kurds, and Americans would deal with issues\n\nas they arise and thereby minimize the risk of clashes between Turks and Kurds.\n\nTurkey maintained that its troops would be under Turkish command, but would\n\ncoordinate with the coalition.\n\n45 (...continued)\n\nWashington Post, March 23, 2003.\n\n46 âTalks on Turkish Role are Underway,â Washington Post, March 23, 2003.\n\n47 State Department press briefing, March 20, 2003.\n\n48 Defense Department press briefing, March 21, 2003.\n\n49 Bush-Remarks, Federal Document Clearing House, March 23, 2003.

Washington was said to once\n\nagain provide reassurances concerning Iraqâs territorial integrity and the Turkomans.\n\nOn March 26, Turkish Chief of Staff General Ozkok gave his own assurances.52 He\n\nsaid that the Turkish Armed Forcesâ most important security concerns were a\n\npossible attack against Turkish troops who have been present in northern Iraq for\n\nsome time, a big refugee influx, and an attack by one armed group in northern Iraq\n\nagainst another or against the civilian population. If these threats occur, then a\n\ndecision could be made to send additional forces to northern Iraq. All action âwill be\n\ncoordinated with the United Statesâ in order to avoid misunderstandings. He stressed\n\nthat Turkey had âno intention to establish a permanent buffer zoneâ and had no\n\nhidden goals. Turkish forces would not use force other than for self defense.\n\nThe United States established a command in northern Iraq to open a modified\n\nnorthern front. Its mission also was partly humanitarian, and probably partly to\n\nprevent the threats that would justify Turkeyâs entry into northern Iraq. On March\n\n31, Khalilzad announced that agreement had been reached with Turkish officials that\n\nâTurkish forces would not enter northern Iraq just for the sake of entering the\n\nregion.â53 On April 2 in Ankara, Secretary of State Powell heard Turkish officials\n\nreiterate developments which would provoke an incursion: a refugee crisis, a PKK\n\nreappearance, a threat to the Turkomans, and an Iraqi Kurd advance on Kirkuk. The\n\nSecretary assessed the likelihood of a need for an incursion as low because the United\n\nStates had stabilized the situation in northern Iraq by close consultation, a U.S.\n\nmilitary presence, control exercised by CENTCOM, and the U.S. relationship with\n\nthe Kurds. He expressed hope that issues related to the establishment of the\n\ncoordination group to create a process for early warning of potential problems would\n\nbe resolved âwithin a week.â54 The early warning system reportedly was to have two\n\nlevels. On the lower level, two units â one in Silopi, a Turkish border town, with\n\nTurkish and U.S. members, and another in northern Iraq, with Kurdish and U.S.\n\nmembers â were to be in direct communication with each other.55 It is not clear if\n\nthe lower level units were ever established. A higher level was said to involve direct\n\ncommunication by General Ozkok to General Myers, and appears to have worked.56\n\nOn April 10, Kurdish militia entered Kirkuk. When Foreign Minister Gul\n\nexpressed his alarm, Secretary Powell assured him that U.S. forces would be inserted\n\nand make sure that situations would not arise that would cause concern to the Turkish\n\ngovernment. He invited Turkey to send military observers, who rapidly deployed to\n\nKirkuk, Mosul, and the U.S. command headquarters in northern Iraq on April 11.\n\n52 Statement to the media by General Hilmi Ozkok, NTV, March 26, 2003, FBIS Document\n\nGMP20030326000084.

On April 13, U.S. armor arrived\n\nin Kirkuk and the Kurdish militia presence appeared to diminish.\n\nUse of Turkish Air Bases Not Included\n\nParliamentâs March 19 authorization of access to airspace did not extend to U.S.\n\nuse of air bases in Turkey to launch attacks on Iraq, for refueling, or for resupply. On\n\nMarch 21, the Turkish Foreign Ministry informed the U.S. and British embassies in\n\nAnkara that Operation Northern Watch was terminated and that its planes should\n\nleave Incirlik. Some planes were redeployed to support Operation Iraqi Freedom,\n\nand others returned to the United States. Undersecretary of State Richard Armitage\n\nsaid that Operation Northern Watch was no longer needed, and the operation\n\nformally ended on May 1.57 Turkish bases were used during the war for humanitarian\n\npurposes, such as evacuation of wounded coalition soldiers, and for emergency\n\nlandings by several U.S. planes that fly missions over northern Iraq.\n\nResupply and Search and Rescue Operations\n\nOn April 2, Secretary of State Powell and Foreign Minister Gul announced that\n\nTurkey had agreed to allow the provision of non-lethal supplies, i.e., food, fuel,\n\nwater, medicine, to U.S. units in northern Iraq. Turkish trucks would deliver these\n\nsupplies, and the Turkish economy would benefit from U.S. purchases and other\n\nexpenditures. They also agreed that U.S. wounded recovered by search and rescue\n\nteams operating in northern Iraq could be transported via Turkey and possibly be\n\ntreated there. They further agreed on expediting the provision of humanitarian aid\n\nto northern Iraq. Gul later estimated that U.S. purchases would exceed $1 billion.\n\nFinances\n\nOn March 24, as part of his request for supplemental funding to pay for the war\n\nin Iraq, President Bush asked for $1 billion in Economic Support Funds (ESF) for\n\nTurkey, which could secure direct loans or loan guarantees of up to $8.5 billion.\n\nOfficially, the funds are to help Turkey deal with the economic consequences of the\n\nwar, âregardless of its level of cooperation.â The Administration said that funds\n\nwould be conditioned on economic policies and tied to continued performance on\n\ninternational financial institutions programs.58 The President would set the terms and\n\nconditions of the grant. The State Department underscored that the $1 billion was\n\na request not a commitment. It and Congress could then assess Turkeyâs economic\n\nsituation, and probably Turkeyâs role at least in not complicating the U.S. operation\n\nin Iraq.\n\nThe aid was included in P.L. 108-11, April 16, 2003, the emergency wartime\n\nsupplemental appropriations act. The funds would not be provided if Turkey\n\nunilaterally deploys troops into northern Iraq, unless the Secretary of State determines\n\n57 At House International Relations Committee, Subcommittee on Foreign Operationsâ\n\nhearing, March 31, 2003.\n\n58 State Department Press Briefing, March 25, 2003.\n\nCRS-22\n\nthat it is in the national security interest. The House Appropriations Committee and\n\nthe House had earlier defeated an amendment to strip aid for Turkey from the bill.\n\nThe NATO Dimension\n\nIn January 2003, the United States asked NATO to begin contingency planning\n\nto protect Turkey in the event of a war. France, Germany, and Belgium prevented\n\naction, arguing that consideration would signal that war was inevitable and U.N.-\n\nsupervised inspections futile. However, all three individually issued promises to\n\nprotect Turkey if it were threatened. Other NATO members expressed dismay with\n\nthe French/German/Belgian position. On February 10, Turkey invoked Article IV of\n\nthe NATO Treaty, requesting consultation regarding a threat. The same three\n\ngovernments obstructed action. On February 20, however, Germany and Belgium\n\nallowed NATO to consider the issue in its Defense Planning Committee, where\n\nFrance does not participate. NATO then agreed to provide Turkey with AWACS\n\nsurveillance aircraft, Patriot air defense batteries and missiles, and chemical and\n\nbiological warfare response gear.\n\nThe Netherlands deployed Patriot anti-missile systems and troops, armed with\n\nGerman missiles to Turkey while NATO was still debating. NATO later sent two\n\nAWACS planes to Konya in Turkey. On March 21, the Spanish government\n\nauthorized its air force to contribute to NATOâs defense of Turkey with a contingent\n\nof six F-18 fighter bombers, a KC-130 Hercules refueling aircraft, and a search and\n\nrescue service Superpuma helicopter, and 232 personnel. Germany balked at sending\n\nadditional Patriot systems. Its parliament was unlikely to approve deployment of the\n\nmilitary manpower required because the government opposes war. The United States\n\nmade up the deficit by sending two Patriot systems â an action unrelated to the troop\n\ndeployment issue.\n\nAs the issue of Turkeyâs entrance into northern Iraq became more prominent,\n\nTurkeyâs NATO allies voiced their opposition. On March 22, German Foreign\n\nMinister Joschka Fischer said that if Turkey became a participant in the war by\n\nentering northern Iraq, then Germany would withdraw its soldiers from the AWACs.\n\nBelgium and Greece adopted the same position. On March 25, the Spanish\n\ngovernment announced that it would withdraw its military support from Turkey if it\n\ninvades northern Iraq. Germany and Belgium warned that NATO might review its\n\nmission if Turkey invaded northern Iraq.\n\nTurkey has always prized its membership in NATO, which remains its only\n\nformal anchor in the West. During the Cold War, Turkey was one of two NATO\n\ncountries (along with Norway) that bordered the Soviet Union. The AKP\n\ndownplayed NATOâs reluctance to consider Turkeyâs concerns, saying it did not\n\naffect Turkeyâs security. Prime Minister Gul noted, however, that it ânegatively\n\naffected the credibility of the alliance.â59 It is possible that the Turkish military may\n\nhave been especially dismayed by developments.\n\n59 âTurkish Minister Says NATO Credibility Hurt,â Reuters, February 13, 2003.\n\nCRS-23\n\nImplications\n\nU.S.-Turkish Bilateral Relations\n\nA U.S.-Turkish agreement for a substantial U.S. troop deployment and a large\n\naid package would have been a high water mark in relations between the two\n\ncountries. Instead, failure to reach an agreement may have been the worst episode\n\nin bilateral relations in decades. It produced a severe crisis of confidence. Analysts\n\nspeculated that both sides may have overreached at the start of negotiations: the\n\nUnited States with the unprecedented number of troops it requested to deploy and\n\nconfidence that permission would be granted, and Turkey with its exorbitant\n\nexpectations of aid, which sources put at $32 to $92 billion.60\n\nThe U.S. Administration publicly recognized the March 1, 2003, parliamentary\n\nvote against deployment as an expression of Turkeyâs democracy, and AKP leaders\n\nErdogan and Gul quickly and repeatedly emphasized the continuing importance of\n\nTurkeyâs strategic alliance with the United States. But U.S. officials reportedly were\n\nfurious.61 Months of negotiations had produced a package that they considered to be\n\ngenerous and to take into account Turkeyâs concerns. Yet their efforts did not bear\n\nfruit.\n\nU.S. officials initially downplayed the importance of the deployment.62\n\nHowever, without a northern front to worry about, Saddam Hussein was able to\n\nredeploy infantry and Republican Guard units from the north to reinforce Baghdad\n\nand his southern front. This could have produced more casualties and prevented U.S.\n\ntroops from protecting Iraqâs northern oil fields. On March 27, Undersecretary of\n\nDefense Wolfowitz told a House committee, âThere is no question if we had a U.S.\n\narmored force in northern Iraq right now, the end (of the war) would be closer.â63\n\nBecause the worst case scenarios did not develop, American anger against\n\nTurkey did not increase. Yet, since Turkey did not allow the deployment, Turkeyâs\n\nstrategic importance to the United States undoubtedly diminished. Turkey and its\n\nresources, such as the huge complex at the Incirlik Air Base, are important only if\n\nthey are available for use in a crisis. The United States has unfailingly supported\n\nTurkeyâs many appeals to international financial institutions, lobbied for Turkeyâs\n\nmembership in the European Union, and made concessions to accommodate Turkish\n\nconcerns in the negotiations for the troop deployment because of U.S. appreciation\n\n60 âTurkey Demands $32 Billion U.S. Aid Package,â New York Times, February 19, 2003.\n\nOne writer reported that Minister of State Babacan had demanded $92 billion. âAysli\n\nAydintasbas, U.S. Said Seeking âGuarantees,ââ Sabah, March 7, 2003, FBIS Document\n\nGMP20030308000029.\n\n61 âU.S. Fumes over Turkey Demand for More Aid,â Los Angeles Times, February 19, 2003.\n\n62 General Richard B.

It is uncertain if such support, which Ankara has\n\ntaken for granted, would be given in the future.\n\nThe unpopularity of the United States in Turkey grew during the negotiations\n\nfor the deployment. Turks felt that the U.S. press had portrayed the negotiations as\n\na bazaar, and had negatively described the size of the U.S. offer as âbuyingâ a\n\nâcoalition of the billing.â64 The Turkish press repeated these reports as outrages. U.S.\n\nofficials were openly impatient,65 and the Turkish media portrayed them as arrogant,\n\nperemptory, and as humiliating the Turks with whom they dealt. The Turks felt that\n\nmoney was only one issue out of many important ones that were dealt with in the\n\nnegotiations and was overemphasized.\n\nThe Turkish military has long been the major supporter of the bilateral alliance,\n\nYet, Chief of Staff General Ozkok himself expressed frustration with what he seemed\n\nto consider a lack of U.S. sympathy for Turkeyâs concerns. He said, âI have\n\ndifficulty understanding those who claim there is a threat to them across the ocean,\n\nand when Turkey says the same threat exists on the other side of its border, this is\n\nfound to be unbelievable.â66 In sum, the crisis over the U.S. deployment deeply\n\nstrained bilateral relations.\n\nEfforts at recovery have begun. Prime Minister Erdogan reached out to\n\nAmerican audiences with opinion pieces in U.S. newspapers, saluting bilateral\n\nrelations and the alliance. (However, he has yet to make a similar, comprehensive\n\nargument to a domestic audience.) Secretary of State Powell visited Turkey on\n\nApril 2 and met with President Sezer, Prime Minister Erdogan, Foreign Minister Gul,\n\nand Chief of Staff General Ozkok. The Secretary expressed appreciation for the\n\nsupport Turkey was giving in the war and promised to be sensitive to Turkeyâs\n\nconcerns about northern Iraq. His Turkish interlocutors described the visit as\n\nextremely beneficial. President Sezer underscored that âthere will not be any change\n\nin Turkeyâs attitudeâ of attributing great importance to its strategic partnership with\n\nthe United States.â67 President Bush called Erdogan on April 23 to reaffirm strong\n\nbilateral relations and to thank him for the role that Turkey was playing in\n\nresupplying U.S. troops in Iraq.\n\nCongress has contributed to the recovery by approving the emergency wartime\n\nsupplementary appropriations bill after defeating an amendment to cut the Presidentâs\n\n$1 billion request for aid to Turkey.

In fact, the dean\n\nof the Turkish press corps, Sami Kohen, also used the bazaar analogy, observing, âTurks\n\nknow about bargaining the bazaar. They can sense when the customer is about to walk\n\nout....,â Turks in High Risk Game, Reuters, February 18, 2003.\n\n65 White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, âIt Is Decision Time.â âU.S. Warns Turkey\n\nAgainst Blocking Iraq Plans,â Reuters, February 18, 2002.\n\n66 Statement to the media by General Hilmi Ozkok, NTV, March 26, 2003, FBIS Document\n\nGMP20030326000084.\n\n67 Turkish Industrialistsâ and Businessmenâs Association, Washington Office, âSelected\n\nNews on Turkey,â April 1-6, 2003.\n\nCRS-25\n\nterm bilateral relationship won out over those seeking to punish Turkey for its recent\n\nfailure. Given the striking deterioration in historic ties, continuous work by both\n\nsides may be needed.\n\nRegional Situation\n\nWithout an agreement on troop deployment, the United States may be less likely\n\nto consult closely with the Turkish government about the future of Iraq, the type of\n\ngovernment to be established, or the rights of the Turkomans. As yet, there has been\n\nno noticeable Turkish presence at any of the postwar meetings to discuss the future.\n\nU.S. troops initially were not present in numbers large enough to prevent the\n\nKurds from entering Kirkuk, prompting transitory fears that Turkish forces might\n\nenter northern Iraq in large numbers with unforeseeable long term consequences.\n\nThe lack of a sizeable U.S. presence appeared to allow the Kurds to assume a\n\ndominant role, perhaps foreshadowing their enhanced autonomy in the region. If\n\nIraqâs territorial integrity is questioned, ethnic groups in other countries might pose\n\nsimilar challenges to nearby regimes.\n\nDomestic Politics\n\nThe AKP and its leaders have been weakened by the defeat in parliament. The\n\ndelay in submitting the motion authorizing U.S. access to Turkish airspace may have\n\nreflected their wariness. On March 1, the AKP leadership had allowed members to\n\nvote their conscience, and allowed the measure to come to a vote without certainty\n\nthat it would pass. The defectors embarrassed their leaders. The lack of political\n\nleadership and control on an issue of paramount national interest and national\n\nsecurity was damaging to the partyâs credibility. It remains to be seen if AKP will\n\nsplinter and if AKPâs future attempts to govern strongly and pragmatically will be\n\naffected. Moreover, the militaryâs abstention on the issue of deployment may be\n\nseen as a warning to the AKP. Although the product of an unprecedented, popular\n\nelectoral victory, the AKP still needs to cultivate the military commanders. Its effort\n\nto democratize the country has to take into account a unique cultural and historical\n\ncontext in which a military role remains significant.\n\nSome analysts have suggested that the vote in parliament signals the growth of\n\nTurkeyâs democracy because parliament had been responsive to public opinion. Yet,\n\nothers see the failure of the ruling party in Turkey to have parliament pass an\n\nimportant measure as indicative of the inexperience and immaturity of Turkeyâs\n\ndemocracy and its proponents. Strong leadership and bloc voting are characteristic\n\nof most parliamentary democracies.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe U.S. offer of economic aid, military aid, and loan guarantees was intended\n\nto compensate Turkey for the cost of the U.S. deployment and was contingent upon\n\nAnkaraâs acceptance of the troops. Without the deployment, U.S. officials made\n\nclear after the vote, the larger aid package would not be forthcoming. The United\n\nStates still would support Turkey in international financial institutions. Turkey\n\nCRS-26\n\nwould still suffer serious war-related, and mostly uncompensated, economic losses.\n\nMoreover, it has large debt payments due throughout 2003, which the U.S. loan\n\nguarantees would have eased considerably. During the months of government\n\nindecision and immediately after the war began, interest rates on domestic debt rose\n\n15% to above 70%. The government already submitted a budget that requires cuts\n\nin spending and tax increases and promised strict adherence to the IMF program.\n\nInterest rates fell only after President Bush requested $1 billion in aid for Turkey.\n\nThus, Turkeyâs economic fortunes appear to be tied more than ever to the perception\n\nof the status of its relations with the United States.\n\nWider Implications\n\nSome observers have suggested that Turkeyâs stand emboldened the smaller\n\ncountries which are nonpermanent, undecided members of the U.N. Security Council\n\nto withstand U.S. pressure for a resolution that would give Iraq a short deadline to\n\ndisarm â in other words, authorize the use of force to disarm Iraq. This analysis\n\nsuggests that if such a close, long time, dependable, and dependent ally of the United\n\nStates could thwart the will of a great power, other countries could be encouraged to\n\ndo so as well.\n\nThe independence of the Turkish parliament also may suggest that U.S.\n\nchampionship of democracy in the Middle East might bring unintended\n\nconsequences. Governments might emerge that would be more responsive to the will\n\nof their people than the current authoritarian regimes, and perhaps less responsive to\n\nthe will of Washington when the two conflict.\n\nEveryCRSReport.com\n\nThe Congressional Research Service (CRS) is a federal legislative branch agency, housed inside the\n\nLibrary of Congress, charged with providing the United States Congress non-partisan advice on\n\nissues that may come before Congress.\n\nEveryCRSReport.com republishes CRS reports that are available to al Congressional staff.
