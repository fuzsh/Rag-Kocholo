        "text": "“Raising my eyes, I saw opening at my feet a beautiful valley, set with meadows and blossoming fields as if encrusted with gems; while far above, on a mesa of the opposite slope which fell almost perpendicularly to the depths of the plain, a dark mass of battlemented ramparts constructed of blocks of black basalt loomed like a crown of death. It was Djarbekir of the Arabs, the Kara-Amid or ‘Black Amid’ of the Ottomans, capital of the province of that name and the head of navigation of the Tigris. (…)\n\nDjarbekir possesses, in addition to her thirteen caravansaries and dozen or so public baths, eight or nine churches, among which the Nestorian convent mentioned above is noteworthy as are also, for various reasons, the Greek Orthodox Church of the Melekites, the very celebrated Jacobite Church of Holy Mary, and likewise another, the name of which escapes me, which I found turned into a stable. This I discovered the following day, when I went to visit my horses and found them tied to the Great Altar, in company with animals from various squadrons which occupied the rest of the sanctuary!\n\nAmong the thirty or forty mosques, several are adorned with decorative details carried out in beautifully carved stone and with superimposed ornaments and ogive arches, strewn with sparkling crystal ornaments. The most beautiful and most original of all is the justly famed Ulu-Djamissi, or Great Mosque, which some commentators believe to have been constructed from the remains of the famous Church of St. Thomas upon the ruins of the palace of Tigranis. Like many Christian shrines of this district, transformed by the Mohammedans into mosques, the Ulu-Djamissi is adorned with a minaret three or four stories high, square, and pierced with window-like apertures; all of which reveals at first glance the characteristics of the ancient steeple. Its greater nave, similarly, is not oriented to the south, as it should be; another fact tending to demonstrate its purely Christian origin. (…)\n\nThe most beautiful portion of the mosque in question is undoubtedly its great tiled court, centered by a fountain in the shape of a kiosk, and bordered on the north by a group of colums, monolithic to all seeming and in part sunken, crowned with Corinthian capitals. To the east is a double gallery or double architrave of columns, beautiful and severe in line, interrupted by the principal entrance of the mosque; and to the west, another gallery of superimposed columns of Hellenic order, but covered with fantastic and extravagant designs which must have been the equivalent, two thousand years ago, of what are today vulgarly called cursi modes: the style of the noveau riche. In fact King Tigranis, of whose palace that court formed part, seems to have been considered by the ancient Greeks as a sort of barbarian who, without ever attaining to a comprehension of the serene beauty of Hellenic art, believed that he might render that art perfect by adding to its chaste forms details and adornments of his own taste. This celebrated façade, which has given the archaeologists so much to think about, merely represents according to my way of thinking the fantastic vision of a rustic mind, traced and carved in marble by the admirable chisel of one of the numerous Greek artists whom King Tigranis had doubtless brought, along with his 300,000 other Graeco-Roman prisoners, from Cappadocia, in order that this sculptor might help construct the palace of Djarbekir. (…)\n\nAs a result of the extermination of the Armenians, who were the nucleus of its artisan and merchant classes, the bazaars of Djarbekir were almost deserted at the time of my visit; and the city’s rich industries of tapestries, Moorish leather, silks, and woolens, were practically paralyzed. Only the products of the fields – as for example wheat, barley, tobacco, cotton and fruits (among the latter the great, luscious honey-dripping melons and sandias for which Djarbekir is famous) – and likewise the coal and copper from the Komur-Hane and Argana-Maden [Ergani] mines, continued normally. This trade was thus the sole basis of life-giving commerce for a city of thirty thousand inhabitants, which even before the war had been composed for the immensely greater part of Turks, Kurds, and Turkomans: all of them purely Mohammedan elements.\n\nOf the four gates piercing the encircling city-wall, the most beautiful is the Gate of Aleppo, or Rum-kapu, which, in addition to an enormous inner door of iron, displays rich and gorgeous inscriptions in diverse characters and languages, intermingled with Greek niches and Roman eagles. Thanks to its position as a terminal point or head of navigation, Djarbekir from time immemorial has played her part as caravan center and place of transport, from which Syrian and Anatolian merchants continue sending merchandise down to Baghdad on rafts constructed upon air-filled bags of sheepskin or buffalo-hide. Such in brief is the description of Djarbekir, the Black City, which thanks to its commercial importance ranks as one of the most important cities of the Ottoman Empire, and which is that Empire’s most advanced outpost upon the desert plains of Djesiret, or northern Mesopotamia.”\n\nExcerpted from: Nogales, Rafael de: Four Years Beneath the Crescent. Translated from Spanish by Muna Lee. London: Sterndale Classics, 2003, pp. 119, 122-124\n\nIntra (Western Armenian pronunciation: Indra), born in Constantinople in 1875 as Tiran Chrakyan or Charakyan (Tiran Č'(a)rak’ean; Տիրան Չ[ա]րաքեան), went down in Armenian intellectual history as a poet, author of essays as well as a painter and teacher. He received his education at the Berberian College in Constantinople and subsequently graduated from the College of Arts, where his works were appreciated by the Armenian-Russian painter Hovhannes (Ivan) Aivazovski. Intra drew his collection of essays Inner World (1906) and his sonnet cycle Cypress Land (1908) with the anagram of his first name; his artistic, sometimes manneristic Western Armenian is a challenge for any translator.\n\nAs Adventist of the 7th Day, Intra had belonged to a tiny denominational minority within the Armenian community since 1913. His accession seems to coincide with a spiritual crisis that intensified with the beginning of the World War. The Adventist Church in the Ottoman Empire had been founded in 1893 by the Armenian Zad(o)ur Baharian (Zadowr Baharean); he presided over the congregation, which was initially banned until 1908, for the rest of his life. About 250 of the 450 Ottoman Adventists died during the genocide, among them the deported Baharian, who was shot in an ambush near Sivas by Kurdish irregulars.\n\nAfter the genocide of 1915, Intra completely lost his mental balance, broke off his teaching and moved through the provinces as the successor to Baharian, eagerly preaching peace and unity. The Adventist community at that time had less than one hundred believers, most of them in Constantinople.\n\nThe Kemalists arrested Intra in 1921 and deported him. According to the testimony of a fellow sufferer, the poet lost his mind during the thousand kilometers march that began in Konya. In 1921, at the end of his strength, Intra sent letters and notes written on paper to the brothers and sisters in faith. Shortly before his end, he wrote with a trembling hand the words of the 23rd Psalm, verse 4: “And when I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you, my God, are with me.” Shortly afterwards Intra died, exhausted and emaciated, on the banks of the Tigris near Diyarbekır.[8]\n\nIf Turkey ever officially faces the Armenian Genocide, the recognition will begin from the East of the country and not from center or West. The City of Diyarbakir, the ‘capital’ of Turkey’s Kurdistan, is the most advanced city in Turkey in terms of facing the historic reality of the Genocide. Indeed, the role of human rights activists and intellectuals of Istanbul and other settlements should and cannot be underestimated. But there is no political administration, other than the authorities of Kurdish-populated ones that would openly speak of what had happened to the Armenians and call for repentance.\n\nDiyarbakir’s administration established street signs in Armenian language, opened Armenian classes in 2012, the Seftali street officially renamed Megerdich Margosian street, who was a prominent ‘bolsahay’ (Istanbul Armenian) author. On 13 November, 2011 Nursel Aydogan, member of Turkey’s parliament (meclis) from Kurdish HDP party from Diyarbakir, submitted a petition to rename the Sur district of the city to Dikranagerd: the historic Armenian name of the place. According to parliament’s website the petition is still under discussion at the Internal affairs commission.\n\nEighty percent of ‘diarbekirtsis’, who attend the Armenian language classes, are reportedly Islamized Armenians. They used to be called crypto-Armenians before. Not in Diyarbakir anymore: in historic Dikranagerd more locals unveil their Armenian roots, even convert to Christianity and baptize at Armenian-Apostolic churches – turning from crypto-Armenians to new-Armenians. The deacon of Diyarbakir’s newly-renovated St. Giragos Church Armin Demerjian himself, until recently had a very much different name: Abdur Rahim Zorusselan.\n\nDiyarbekir’s municipality supported (also financially) the reconstruction of city’s St. Giragos Armenian Church. Apparently, Turkey’s government also has a record of reconstructing an Armenian spiritual temple: the Holy Cross church on Akdamar island of Van in 2007. However, Ankara authorities attempted to make a show out of it by putting huge Turkish flags (but no Armenian Cross) on the church. And certainly there was no Armenian flag on the whole island. The Turkish government refused to open the border-gate even for a short period of time or arrange a direct flight from Yerevan to Van for the opening ceremony day. The Armenian delegation from Yerevan had to drive all the way through Georgia.\n\nBut Diyarbakir leaders did not strive to make a PR out of church’s reopening. The reconstruction of St. Giragos was rather a step to approach their Armenian fellows and to reconcile Turkey with Turkey’s past. ‘Pari yegaq dzer dune’ Armenian posters were seen in the city during the ceremony.\n\nThe Kurdish leadership, including the one in Northern Iraq, has truly invested lot of efforts in democratization. Kurdistan has fairly good chance to turn into the locomotive of democracy in the Middle East. According to The Economist, ‘Democracy in the Kurds’ region, though imperfect and tainted with corruption, functions far better than elsewhere in Iraq.’\n\nIraq’s Kurdish leadership sent a delegate to Paris in March, where the Congress of Western Armenians was taking place. A member of Iraqi Kurdistan’s parliament Ali Halo apologized for the Kurdish participation to the Armenian Genocide. The Armenian language has become one of the official languages of Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nThe Kurdish authorities could take one more historic step in terms of bringing the Turkish Republic and society closer to facing their history. Diyarbakir has a chance to become the 1st city of modern Turkey to take position on recognizing and condemning the Armenian Genocide. Out of 92 members of Diyarbakir’s city council about 60 belong to Kurdish BDP party. Although the city council involves several members of the ruling AKP party, who theoretically should resist such recognition, the BDP politicians apparently outnumber.\n\nOn 24 April (2015) six non-governmental organizations held commemoration in Diyarbakir and called for recognition of the Armenian Genocide. ‘It has been a century-long time that the political vision of CUP leaders put a disgrace over our shoulders‘, Kurdish leader Selahettin Demirtaş stated at the ceremony next to the ruins of St Sarkis Armenian church. Although different Kurdish public and political figures in Turkey have made statements openly calling the events of 1915 a Genocide, there was no formal recognition by any administration of Turkey since Raphael Lemkin had coined the term.\n\nIt would be very much proper and fitting to vote for such resolution in 2015, the centennial year of the Armenian Genocide. In past, there were many occasions when the Armenian Genocide has been recognized on city council level: Edinburg (Scotland, UK), Cardiff (Wales, UK), Batak (Bulgaria), Milan (Italy), Rome (Italy), etc. In fact, the formal decisions adopted by various Italian city-halls eventually turned to be a major boost pushing Italy toward formal recognition of the Armenian Genocide in November of 2000. Will the same scenario work for Turkey? It may, or it may not. But in any case, it would be the right thing to do launching an important process in modern Turkey.\n\nHundred years after 1915 Dikranagerd could change history and make a critical stride toward healing the pain of the Armenians, and promoting the piece between the Armenians and Turks based on truth and justice.\n\nIndeed, this will be a huge step in bringing democracy and openness to Turkey itself.\n\nQuoted from “Asbarez” (Paris), 30 April 2015, http://asbarez.com/134670/diyarbakirs-city-council-should-recognize-armenian-genocide/"
