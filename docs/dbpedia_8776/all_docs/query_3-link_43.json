        "text": "Like ants toting food back to the colony, the families streaming out of Diyarbakir’s old city on a recent sunny afternoon tended to move in single file. They carried boxes, bags and beds on their heads and babies in their arms, hauled luggage and carts, and the occasional piece of furniture.\n\nFor two months much of Sur – the ancient heart of Diyarbakir in south-eastern Turkey – has been under 24-hour curfew and the site of pitched battles between the Turkish state and Kurdish militants. Sur has about 120,000 residents – or did before the fighting began – more than 30,000 have now fled. In late January the government added five more districts to the curfew, and many residents of those areas have been getting out before they are caught up in the violence. Many who leave may never return.\n\nSur’s history stretches back millennia, with traces of dozens of civilisations and a much-lauded legacy of pluralism. Jews, Muslims and Christians, Persians, Arabs, Armenians and Turks have all made their mark here.\n\nMore than 1,500 of Sur’s buildings have been labelled historic and protected by law. Some are 500 years old, others many centuries more. Last June, Unesco named the 40ft-high stone fortifications that encircle Sur, built around 350AD, a World Heritage Site, along with the 8,000-year-old Hevsel Gardens, which lie between the walls and the Tigris river.\n\nYet in early December Turkey’s military went in with tanks, urban assault vehicles and waves of troops to root out the young Kurdish militants. Recent photos and video footage from Sur show scenes of devastation reminiscent of present-day Syria. Untouched archaeological sites have reportedly been destroyed. Last week, a rocket-propelled grenade damaged Sur’s 1,700-year-old Virgin Mary church.\n\nNow, with military operations supposedly winding down, talk among locals and officials has turned to rebuilding – in Sur and in the central districts of other regional cities. “These cities have faced unplanned and uncontrolled growth since the 1990s, and would need urban renewal even if these events hadn’t happened,” Turkey’s prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu recently explained. “We’ll rebuild Sur so that it’s like Toledo: everyone will want to come and appreciate its architectural texture.”\n\nTurkey has been fighting an off-and-on war with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, for more than three decades. In recent years, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has made more progress toward peace than any previous government. But violence flared anew last July.\n\nDays after a bombing in Suruç – which killed 33 people who were seeking to help rebuild the Syrian Kurdish city of Kobane – Kurdish militants assassinated two policemen. Turkey responded with airstrikes on PKK positions and the tit-for-tat quickly escalated, leading to the brutal urban conflict that continues today.\n\nKurdish fighters surely shoulder some responsibility. Inspired by activists’ declarations of autonomy, they commandeered urban centres, booby-trapped narrow alleyways, dug trenches and used bricks, stones and other available materials to build barricades.\n\nMonths ago, the prominent Diyarbakir businessman Shahismail Bedirhanoglu met with these young militants and urged them not to go down this path to defend Sur. “I told them it’s as if you’re mad at someone, yet you burn down your own house,” he said to me in a recent interview. “It’s like giving the state an invitation for these operations. We told the people there will be death and destruction.”\n\nSome 220 civilians have been killed in these urban clashes, along with nearly 260 police and soldiers, according to an International Crisis Group researcher. In that time Ankara says it has killed nearly 600 fighters from the PKK, which the United States and the European Union have also labelled a terrorist group. And the violence looks set to continue for some time: security officials revealed this week that army and special forces units have been training in urban warfare, and that military operations will soon expand to at least three other small southeastern cities.\n\nThere’s little doubt that Ankara’s main motivation for its aggressive military operations in Sur and other south-eastern cities is stopping Kurdish militants. Yet many observers see a secondary objective: to remake the central districts of these nettlesome, predominantly Kurdish cities into something more profitable and more amenable to state control.\n\nIn a recent parliamentary inquiry addressed to Davutoglu, Diyarbakir MP Felaknas Uca, from the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), asked if the state’s military operations in Sur were linked to government plans for urban renewal.\n\nThe government has been pushing to remake Sur – much of which is run-down and poor – for years. “With the projects we are planning to implement in Diyarbakir, employment will increase in the province and we will make Diyarbakir an international tourism destination,” president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said in 2011, shortly after the state housing body, known as TOKI, had begun demolition work in Sur.\n\nMore than 300 structures were destroyed before the work sparked strong local opposition, forcing TOKI to halt construction in 2013 – though not before declaring Sur an at-risk area and delegating authority to the Ministry of the Environment and Urban Planning.\n\nDiyarbakir Municipality maintains highly protective zoning plans for Sur that prohibit any significant renovations or new construction without proper approval. But in certain cases, the ministry and TOKI are able to declare urgent expropriation of an at-risk urban area and essentially do as they please.\n\nThe fear now is that, rather than doing a building-by-building risk analysis, in the wake of the conflict in Sur and other urban centres, the ministry will simply declare entire districts unsafe, clear them of people and begin demolitions.\n\n“Sometimes state officials turn a security risk into an opportunity,” says Nevin Soyukaya, head of Diyarbakir Municipality’s Cultural Heritage and Tourism Department. “‘It’s not safe here,’ they say, ‘and we can rebuild to make it safer.’”\n\nThe state began military operations around Sur less than two months after Unesco handed down its honour, which significantly increased the value and tourist-attractiveness of neighbouring districts. The curfews and violence began in early September.\n\nIn November, when Tahir Elci, head of the Diyarbakir Bar Association and a prominent peace activist, visited Sur to warn about damage to crucial heritage structures, he was shot in the head and killed during a firefight that erupted during his press conference. The next month, the pro-government Star newspaper highlighted the need to rid Sur of slums, which it said promote crime and terror, and build high-end housing. It urged the government to declare Sur a disaster area and allow for urgent expropriation.\n\nThe AKP government seems to view construction as a tool that can spur broader economic growth. Much has been written about Erdoğan’s $100 billion worth of megaprojects for Istanbul, the bid-free contracts of government-friendly developers, and the $400bn government plan to restore or rebuild a third of Turkey’s housing – some 6.5 million homes.\n\nOne way to keep young men from joining militant groups is to keep them gainfully employed. The economy of Diyarbakir and the south-east has long lagged behind the rest of Turkey. The unemployment rate is about double the national average, and even higher among youth.\n\nThe recent violence in Diyarbakir and other cities has made matters worse. In Sur alone, some 1,500 shops have been destroyed or closed and 10,000 people put out of work. The city’s gleaming new airport is like a ghost town. “The Diyarbakir economy has basically hit rock bottom,” says Bedirhanoglu.\n\nThe rebuilding plans for Sur have yet to be released. But in a recent statement, the office of the Diyarbakir governor, who is an appointee of the ruling AKP, said historical structures would be restored, while slums, shops and various other commercial and residential buildings would be demolished. TOKI would then build “luxurious” housing, along with retail and tourist facilities.\n\nDavutoglu chose his model city wisely. Like Diyarbakir, Toledo in Spain is a provincial capital with ancient roots, stunning stone fortifications, a multicultural legacy and a Unesco World Heritage listing. It also suffered considerable destruction during conflict – the Spanish Civil War. Unlike Diyarbakir, it has been lovingly restored and is emerging as a popular tourist destination.\n\n“Those who impoverish the people will then emerge as their saviours,” predicts Abdullah Demirbas, the mayor of Sur from 2004 to 2014. “The desired result is an impoverished, obedient people who are domesticated and whose will to resist is broken.”\n\nThat assumes they’ll still be around. The AKP government has been known to bully its way into aged central neighbourhoods to drive mostly poor locals out to far-flung housing and build a shiny new district in their wake. Istanbul has seen this several times, in places like Sulukule, Tarlabasi and Okmeydani.\n\nObservers believe these initiatives aim to kill two birds with one stone: a highly valuable area is redeveloped, boosting local revenues and property values and lining developers’ pockets; and an opponent is literally marginalised, moved to housing on the urban periphery. In the case of Okmeydani, it’s Alevis, Kurds, and leftists. Next up is Sur and its Kurdish residents, along with a smattering of Assyrians, Yazidis and Armenians.\n\nAfter several attempts, a government contact said nobody was available for comment on this issue.\n\nIn the past decade Demirbas and others have helped revive Sur’s multiculturalism, via an interfaith dialogue group known as the Council of Forty, and restore a handful of historic buildings, most famously Surp Giragos Church, the largest Armenian church in the Middle East. He fears this progress is now being undone.\n\nAcross the region, the fighting has displaced more than 200,000 people. “The logic behind this is not just economic opportunism,” Demirbas says. “This is also an ideological and cultural hegemony project. They change the demographic profiles of places where the people don’t share their views. They replace them with people who do.”\n\nIn cities around the world, poor disadvantaged peoples are often pushed out of increasingly valuable neighbourhoods, either by market forces or the local government. It’s called gentrification, and it’s both problematic and the most common way to develop desirable urban areas. In Diyarbakir, we may be seeing something unprecedented: gentrification by military force. And it’s all the more troubling because of Sur’s ancient roots.\n\n“It’s so ridiculous to say to these people, ‘We can bring you a new economy and more commerce with these new projects,’” says Soyukaya. “This is a city that goes back 7,000 years, a centre of culture and trade. The people here have a memory of this. If you force them to leave the area, or change their lifestyle and their surroundings, you destroy their historical memory, their culture and way of life.”\n\nOn 3 February, hundreds more Sur residents streamed out of the district with their belongings after the government lifted the curfew in nine western neighbourhoods (the curfew remained in place in much of Sur’s eastern side).\n\nThe next day Davutoglu outlined a 10-step action plan to repair south-eastern Turkey, involving compensation payments and helping local employers and tradesmen. The government also intends to hold consultations with village guards (pro-government Kurdish militia), tribal and religious leaders, politicians and civic groups, and to build bulletproof security posts manned by special ops teams in urban centres across the region.\n\n“We are going to bind all the wounds,” said Davutoglu, making no mention of whether the displaced might be able to return to their homes, in Sur or other south-eastern cities. As a result, locals fear we might be witnessing a permanent exodus from one of the longest-inhabited parts of the planet.\n\n“This is no longer just about Kurds and the people of Diyarbakir,” Soyukaya says. “Sur is a part of Mesopotamia, the cradle of civilisation, so this is a global concern. This is important to human history, and it would be an international crime to destroy it.”"
