        "meta_description": "This article takes a comparative approach, looking to two small cities in the Ottoman East – Mardin and Bitlis – and a group of mansions constructed by a new Armenian bourgeoisie in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Mardin and Bitlis were similar owing to the important position that Armenian merchants held in prosperous local markets that were booming in the period following the Tanzimat reforms. Members of this Armenian bourgeoisie were committed to their locality and showed this by playing an active role in new councils. However, they also displayed their commitment through the stylistic choices and symbolic vocabulary of their homes. This article shows how in both cities a rise in mansion-building took place in the aftermath of social turmoil and argues that this was a way for wealthy Armenians to reaffirm their presence. In Bitlis, this was in the 1880s in the wake of the Russo-Turkish War, amid problematic relations with missionaries and Russian-Armenian incursions. In Mardin, it was in the 1890s to 1900s following the (averted) Hamidian Massacres. At these crucial junctures, local decorative traditions were used as a show of support for authority and to reinforce a social alliance.",

        "text": "4It is the contention of this article that these public-facing characteristics of the mansions in Bitlis and Mardin – their unusually large inscriptions and ostentatious design elements following Renaissance Italy – were a show of being “open for business” by the Armenian bourgeoisie, following rising tensions in their localities – namely, the growing power of the missionaries and Russian Armenian political presence in Bitlis, as well as the stresses of the (averted) Hamidian Massacres in Mardin. In both these cities, Armenian commercial elites had taken on a position of increased importance, had dominated trade networks feeding into the cities and their markets, and had become incredibly prosperous from trade in goods, particularly luxuries like gold. The prominence of these elites was particularly strong in small-sized cities like Mardin and Bitlis, where the mansions they constructed were in central zones and had a conspicuous degree of visibility.\n\n6This article proceeds by looking to post-reform Armenian elites in Mardin and Bitlis, arguing that commercial elites, or bourgeoisie, boomed due to the prime locations of their cities and their new position playing an active role in local government. In Bitlis, elites saw a highpoint in the early 1880s playing foil to the missionaries and incipient Russian Armenian political presence. In post-massacre Mardin, Armenians experienced a surge in confidence because violence had been averted and notables worked together to restore peace. The article argues that the style of mansions constructed in Mardin and Bitlis corresponded to this fraught social and economic context. They showed local solidarity through their uptake of indigenous building techniques and styles, specifically their carved stone motifs, that reflected their local alliances and their work in the new reformed councils – their commitment to being Mardinli, Bitlisli and, yet, Ottoman. However, their monumental inscriptions allying them with the medieval Armenian kingdom, or their echoing of features developed by the Medicis of Florence, also betrayed their wider connections and aspirations. The post-reform Armenian bourgeoisie in Bitlis and Mardin were thus both similar and different in their building and design processes.\n\nA new Armenian commercial elite, or bourgeoisie, in Mardin and Bitlis\n\nRising tensions: Bitlis in the 1880s\n\nThe impact of the massacres in Bitlis\n\n30Conditions were clearly not favourable for the building of mansions after 1894-96. Yet the decline had already begun; in 1889-91, Tahsin Pasha’s extractions had fundamentally changed the situation of Armenian elites and the Moussa Bey incident had alienated – even radicalised – many. There are few Armenian traces in Bitlis that date from between 1889 and 1897-98 (when the Municipality and Government House were built and there was a resurgent Armenian presence).\n\nMardin and the massacres: social solidarity and Catholic power?\n\n34The result of this situation was that Mardin’s Catholic Armenians were buffered in the 1890s by warm relations with Arab notables, imperial favour, and some degree of solidarity between the Latin churches based in (and around) Mardin. They embarked on a flurry of construction activity, commissioning a singularly talented and productive master-mason and architect (who was also an Armenian Catholic), Serkis Lole, to construct a series of lavish mansions, including the Çermeyan Mansion. These mansions, like those in Bitlis, combined newly open displays of wealth and status with conspicuous references to an indigenous style.\n\nIndigeneity of style\n\nBitlis Mansions in the 1880s: Writing on the Walls\n\n39Although 1876-78 has been associated with an exodus – the hammal (porters) of Constantinople were overwhelmingly from Bitlis and Muş – mansions built in the 1880s show that Armenians not only stayed on but carved out a substantial presence. In 1879, Ottoman official newspaper Tercüman-ı Efkâr (No.583, 12th June) voiced Armenians’ objections to the title ‘Consul for Kurdistan’ given to the British consular post for Erzurum, Diyarbakir, Harput, Muş and Van. The consul concluded that the post might indeed be changed to ‘Armenia and Kurdistan’, putting forward that this was “since the cooperation of the Armenians is essential to carrying out reforms in the region” and that it concerned a point on which they were “extremely sensitive”. He also added that:\n\n106 FO 195/1211, Erzurum, July 15th 1879, Trotter.\n\nThere is no doubt whatever that the Armenians in these provinces are anxious to take a more active part in public affairs than has hitherto been allotted to them […] the Armenian of today is a very different individual to what he was before the war. He is much bolder and less submissive and is bent on apparently securing rights and privileges which have hitherto often very unfairly been denied him.106\n\n43The closest contemporary parallels to the Bitlis inscriptions are from Russian-held Kars and Gyumri at the end of the nineteenth and start of the twentieth century [figures 7 and 8]. In those cities, inscriptions give the date of construction in Armenian letters, often accompanied by Latin numerals (sometimes also Russian or Greek), but only form small elements of the façade. In such locations, surrounded by fin de siecle Russian buildings, Armenian letters in keystones, small corners and pediments did not stand out. Yet, the inscriptions on Deebek Botch also recall the medieval capital of Ani and its endless churches with yerkat’agir. They manage to blend the monumentality of the medieval inscriptions with the functional content of those of the Russian territories.\n\n51The judgement in favour of Kurkdjian over Knapp in 1884 indicated that this was a period of strength for Bitlis’s Apostolic Armenians. Karmirak remained the main Armenian foundation, as Lynch (c.1901) and A-To’s (c.1912) observations show. In light of his statement after the massacres, the Bishop of Bitlis evidently saw it as his representative responsibility both to defend his community and uphold Ottomanism. Karmirak was an equivalent announcement in architecture, and it served as a compliment to the mansions of Deebek Botch in the rebuilding of Bitlis as a provincial centre.\n\nMardin Mansions in the 1890s-1900s: Medicis of the East\n\n55Despite this growth of the community and its political voice – and the threat to other populations that this might entail – Sourp Hovsep underlined a sense of loyalty through structural and stylistic choices. As was the tradition in Mardin, Sourp Hovsep did not have a street presence but was within an enclosure. The stone-carved decorative vocabulary of the church also expressed local continuity. Arabesques, eight-pointed stars, lotus, corbels, ribbed and knotted geometric patterns carved on the portal (fig. 11) were characteristic of medieval Mardin buildings, such as the Kasımiye Medrese (1407). Rounded Roman arches, classicizing framing devices, cornices, shell niches, Corinthian columns, dentil, egg-and-dart, palmettes, interlocking diamonds and acanthus can be traced to local Early Christian traditions. The grape vine, distinctive of the Deyr-ül-Zaferan Monastery, is carved on Sourp Hovsep’s altarpiece. Yet, in contrast with the other churches of Mardin-centre (the Syriac ones and the fifth-century Apostolic Armenian Sourp Kevork), Sourp Hovsep had an impressive interior space. Groin vaulting and pointed arches likened it to a Gothic cathedral, while Italianate fixtures and paintings completed the hybrid aesthetic (fig. 12).\n\n61The loggia’s design maximised its openness. It consisted of five wide round arches, with three on the main façade and two on either end. The arches opened on to bays covered with cross vaults, supported by columns. Ornate capitals and keystones with carved trefoils of the virtues of Fortitude, Temperance, Justice, and Prudence communicated the symbolism of the building. The Çermeyan Mansion repeated the three wide arches on the street façade and vaulted interior bays, but it fused Renaissance and Mardinli carved decoration with zig-zag friezes on pointed arches, calligraphic Arabic medallions in tear-drop motifs, decorative corbels and balustrades.\n\n64Renaissance references punctuate Lole’s other works. The dramatic staircase leading to the Syriac Catholic Patriarchate (1895) (fig. 14) mimics Michelangelo’s Campdoglio, Rome (1537), and the Laurentinian Library in Florence (1524). The Kasparyan Mansion (1890) also included a monumental staircase. Lole’s high school (1898) showcased a similarly theatrical ascent, topped by a ceremonial gateway, with a façade that quotes the mid-sixteenth-century Florentine Loggia del Mercanto Nuovo. Cornices and corbels on Lole’s mansion (fig. 15) are reminiscent of Alberti’s Palazzo Rucellai, Florence (1446-51).\n\n65A related fad for the Renaissance was noticed in not-so-distant Aleppo by British Foreign Office functionary Mark Sykes (circa 1906):\n\n153 M. Sykes, 1915, p. 299.\n\nThe Renaissance designs of the modern Latin architect have been appropriated and iron girders have been made use of; but the artistic spirit of Syria – flamboyant, nay, perhaps a little vulgar if you will – remains. The dividers, T-square, and drawing board of the French engineer have been unable to crush out the originality of the illiterate Syria Arab. The native mason grasped the fact that classic forms and Saracenic intricacy might be made to blend, and he seized the new basis of design and moulded from it the creatures of his imagination.153\n\n***\n\n67Architecture was a strategy used by Bitlis and Mardin’s new Armenian bourgeoisie to show wealth and status at the times of their strength. Luxurious mansions constructed by these merchants showed that they were “open for business” in the wake of the Russo-Turkish War and the (averted) massacres, respectively. Stylistic features of these mansions showed this confidence through uniquely public-facing aspects: exterior Armenian inscriptions in Bitlis and loggias as façades in Mardin. These stylistic choices were unprecedented in their localities and yet showed connections to Armenian medieval tradition, to usages in Russian-held territories, as well as to Italian Renaissance fashions that may have become popular with these (Catholic) Armenians through their trade and religious and educational networks.\n\n68At the same time, the symbolic vocabulary displayed by the mansions reaffirmed their patrons’ commitment to their localities. In Deebek Botch, mansions incorporated muqarnas, tufa stone and projecting eaves that had become associated with Bitlis through the architectural inheritance of Kurdish Beys, Turkmens, Armenians and other local powers. At the Çermeyan Mansion, stone-carved zigzags and teardrops – motifs of Islamic ancestry – were central aspects of the façade. These visual symbols echoed the roles that these wealthy Armenians were playing in new local institutions of governance, as well as in informal spheres of social protection.\n\n70Urban dynamics in Bitlis and Mardin determined when mansions were built. In Bitlis, (Apostolic) Armenians held a strong position in the 1880s as a foil to missionaries and Russian-founded political parties – and they were hopeful about the future of their new provincial capital. In the 1890s, Mardin’s Catholics oversaw mass conversions and achieved Hamidian favour, but also developed strong relations with local Arab notables. In both locations, elites became affluent through trade in luxury materials, exotic commodities and grain, and they constructed flamboyant homes in the vicinity of the market. Mansions corresponded to the prosperity of the city, but also communicated enthusiasm for the new Tanzimat and post-war institutions, and the roles of Armenians as civic, as well as communal, representatives and negotiators."
