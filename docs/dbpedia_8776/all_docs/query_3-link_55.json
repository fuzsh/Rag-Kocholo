        "text": "DIYARBAKIR, Turkey — It was the end of the day in an underground tavern with no name. Beneath a domed Ottoman ceiling, with the lights down low and the music muted, patrons could just hear a distant rumbling through the basalt block walls, five centuries old.\n\n“Bulldozers,” explained the waiter, who also had no name. He was clearing the table. The bulldozers were clearing the rubble away from what used to be residential neighborhoods here in the Sur municipality of Diyarbakir city, the informal Kurdish capital and former stronghold of the outlawed Kurdish group, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K.\n\nIt has been more than a year since the fighting started in Sur, with young supporters of the P.K.K. guerrillas digging trenches and manning barricades, and more than four months since that fighting ended, with at least 120 civilians, P.K.K. and Turkish security forces killed and scores of homes and buildings destroyed.\n\nThe Turkish Army and police won, but victory brought an Aleppo-like landscape. Two dozen acres of the old city have been cleared of the rubble so far, leaving a featureless circular gash on aerial maps. The damage is mostly invisible from street level though, because alleyways leading up to the most devastated areas have been walled up where they intersect with streets that have reopened for business. Three of Sur’s neighborhoods still remain under curfew.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
