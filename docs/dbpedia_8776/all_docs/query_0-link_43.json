        "text": "start the introductory section of this article with a discussion of the very broad title, \" Town and Tribe \" , when this title is limited as regards time and place through the con­ tinuation \" The Conflict Between Tribe and Nobility in Ottoman Diyarbekir (1891-1909) \" The reason will become clear when our analysis of a rather specific area is considered within the context of general theories about this topic. Right from the start I should indicate that this article is part of a series of urban history studies that approaches critically the classical historiography on towns in Turkey. Therefore it contains in itself a hidden criticism of this historiography. This criticism targets \" uniform \" or \" centralist \" approaches to the concept of \" Islamic Town \" and its corollary \" Ottoman Town \" , which result in rigid categorisations. Scholarship about the developments that led to the disintegration of the Ottoman State and the foundation of the Republic has been domi­ nated by approaches that often put the centre in the foreground and neglect the provinces. In this context many features characteristic of the provinces were either missed or linked back to the centre and thus deprived of their provincial element. The disintegration of the Otto­ man State itself happened right after a period that had substituted extremely centralist meth­ ods for much less centralist methods of long standing. The Republic that was then founded was built on a paradigm that linked everything back to the centre and sought to make it uniform. For the nationalism of the Republic, which rested on homogeneity, retreat from the centre as well as increase in diversity posed a vital risk. Perception of this risk necessarily led to contempt of all that was related to the provinces, despite all populist talk, and to the notion that history was predominantly made from the administrative core. This situation determined for a long time the basic starting point for historical study: \" the centre \". Indeed, even the discovery of the provinces and the development of academic sub­ disciplines such as local history and urban history did not lead to great changes in the ap­ proach that put the centre in the foreground. The provinces were an \" object \" that did (could) not transcend the boundaries that the core had determined. Consequently two different re­ searchers studying two different Ottoman cities that were considered provincial in terms of history, culture, ethnicity, religion and geography would arrive at the same conclusions even if they focused on different centuries, because the provinces were something that the centre \" created \" and were definitely to be read from a centralist point of view. The Ottoman provinces that are thus imagined are a theoretical construct and reflect not the provinces themselves but rather the image that the centre had formed of them. Consequently the inter­ pretative frameworks that had their roots in Ottoman centralism were generally even more rigid than the methods applied by the Ottomans themselves. Once one goes beyond this rigid centralist approach, one can speak of a reality of each Ottoman town that is specific to it and stands in a close relationship to the town's pre­ Ottoman phase."
