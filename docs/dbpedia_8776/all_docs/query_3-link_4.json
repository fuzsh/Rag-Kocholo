        "text": "After much research we came up short on finding any travel blog information on the Turkish region of Diyarbakir. Especially for Americans traveling to Diyarbakir there was a nothing available. Only safety warnings to visiting Northern Kurdistan. For this reason I hope this travel blog on Diyarbakir written by two American tourists comes in handy. Note: traveling to Diyarbakir, Turkey is safe, enjoyable, and a must do if visiting Turkey.\n\nEn Route to Diyarbakir\n\nThe bus from Mardin was relatively uneventful—2 hours and a security checkpoint later we were nearing the city of Diyarbakir, or Amed as is known to the Kurds. The armed policemen went around taking everyone’s IDs while the other police officers waited outside near their armored cars. When the policeman got to us he simply gave us a once-over and kept on collecting IDs. Apparently we did not fit the ‘target demographic’ and our IDs were not required. After scanning each ID our van was free to continue onwards into the city.\n\nThe first thing I noticed were the multiple layers of security fences lining the main road into the city. Tall fences with barbed wire on top gave a very clear message—the only way into or out of the city was along the main roads. Lookout towers peppered the landscape as we entered the city proper while concrete barricades and a multitude of armored vehicles greeted us.\n\nMeeting Our Couchsurfing Host\n\nWe were dropped off at a small bus station and we struggled to find a bus into the city. I had been using my google translator app on my phone with little success. I changed the language form Turkish to Kurmanji (which is the Kurdish dialect here in Turkish Kurdistan). This proved to be much more successful. We met our host at a modern café that he owned. We were greeted by another couchsurfer who had arrived just one hour prior. The couch surfer was a 30 year old man from Poland named Robert. He had previously biked through Georgia and Iranian and Iraqi Kurdistan before coming to Northern Kurdistan in Diyarbakir.\n\nOur host was a delightful man named Suat. He told us a lovely story about his first experience hosting where he had hosted a Swedish woman named Mona. This was 12 years ago and was not through couch surfing. Although only planning on hosting Mona. for a couple days Mona ended up living with Suat and his wife for 6 months while she researched Kurdish culture for her thesis. They formed an incredibly close friendship and Suat ended up naming his Café and later his first child after Mona. Mona flew back to Diyarbakir for 2 days for her Birth. Later Suat and his family went to Sweden for Mona’s wedding.\n\nSuat is also a full time teacher in a village. He described his frustration with the village children in how they were troublemakers and didn’t pay attention. Their parents are uneducated and mostly laborers so their children do not see the benefit of education.\n\nSuat told us that he and his wife were different types of Muslim (Sunni vs Shia) and that both of their parents forbade them from getting married. They were married anyways\n\nWe discussed Kurdish history and the current state of affairs. This involved detailed comparison of Eastern Kurdistan (Iran), Southern Kurdistan (Iraq), and Western Kurdistan (Syria). Suat explained the PKK to us and I found the information quite interesting. Compared to our host in Van, Suat’s feelings about the matter were different. I wonder if it’s because Suat still lives in the heart of Northern Kurdistan?\n\nA Brief History of Diyarbakir\n\nDiyarbakir, known in ancient times as Amida, has been the cradle of 26 different civilizations over the last 5000 years. Its proximity to a basalt plateau gives the city a rather dark appearance thanks to the dark grey stones found throughout the city. Located in Mesopotamia, the land between the Euphrates Valleys and the Tigris river Diyarbakir’s past involves the Mitanni, the Urartu, Assyria, Persian, Greek, Seleucids, Romans, Arabs, Safavid dynasty, and ultimately conquered by the Ottomans in 1515. They have never known long-lasting peace because in subsequent centuries they were invaded by the armies of Anatolia, Persia, and Syria all of which overcame the city’s walls.\n\nSince the 1980s the city has been the center of the Kurdish resistance movement. Throughout the 1990s many refugees from the conflict between the PKK and the Turkish government move to the city. Just a few short years ago in 2016 there was an altercation between the PKK and the Turkish government leaving a large section of Old City demolished. We witnessed some new construction in the area but could only see inside by climbing onto the city walls and looking down into the city.\n\nSafety\n\nPlease read our posting on the Safety of Travel in Turkey. Diyarbakir is highest on the list of places to avoid in Turkey. I couldn’t disagree with this more. The city is safe and the people are friendlier than what I thought was humanly possible. There are only two dangers I can see someone encountering in this city—falling off the old city wall and getting sick from the Cig Kofte—I’ll discuss these later\n\nWhen I mentioned to people that my country strongly advises against travel to Diyarbakir they seemed greatly confused. They said it was just politics and that now it’s very safe. While strolling in Old City we met an Iranian Kurdish family. We talked on the street for 15 minutes. When I explained to her the United States’ stance on travel to this area she gave me an explanation without hesitation. She said it was likely because of Turkey’s government—they were trying to paint the Kurds as terrorists. I found her explanation easy to believe after learning more about the Kurds and Diyarbakir’s history. The family was impressed that Robert, our Polish travel companion, knew more about Iranian Kurdistan than they did. After these last few days Sylvie and I wish to visit Iran in the future.\n\nInteresting Facts of Diyarbakir\n\nPigeons - Pigeons are so highly sought after that Sylvie and I could not quite wrap our heads around it. The reason is actually due to some esoteric history. Pigeons were brought into the city and bred because their feces is helpful for growing watermelon. Watermelon is incredibly popular here. Now that cotton has replaced much of the watermelon crop the love for pigeons is just a carryover from the past. Many older people still love pigeons—so much, in fact, that there are a handful of pigeon clubs around town where the notorious bird is auctioned off for as much as hundreds of dollars. We even heard stories of men selling their homes to buy pigeons. Here you can see a video of a pigeon race here.\n\nSunflower Seeds – Cheap and plentiful they can be found in buckets for sale around town. Men will down an entire bag while sipping tea and talking to other men. The seeds are eaten with such haste that it is dizzying just watching. While the mouth is busy removing the seeds from the shell the men’s hands are readying for another seed. This endless seed-eating frenzy is associated with the poorer Kurds and a “rich person would never be caught eating a sunflower seed”. Our host went as far as saying he would not even permit someone to eat “those things” in his café.\n\nDogs – Despite the numerous stray cats in the city we didn’t see too many (if any) dogs. Our host explained to us that there is a story found in Islam where a warrior was about to slay a dog but at the last moment decided not to. While certain muslins interpret this story as the warrior demonstrating mercy many Kurds believe it teaches that the warrior didn’t want to touch the dog because it was unclean/dirty. For this reason you will find many Kurd avoiding dogs completely.\n\nKurdish Wedding\n\nOur couchsurfing host invited us to his collogues wedding our first night in town. The wedding was half an hour out of the city and we arrived around 9pm. There must have been between 600 and 700 guests at the party. I wore jeans a black polo, and flip flops. Sylvie and Robert were even more casual. No one seemed to care. As is typical in wedding here people eat dinner beforehand and only snacks and drinks are served at the actual wedding. Tables were overflowing with nuts, fruit, and cookies. Men came around offering us glasses of orange Fanta and cola. No alcohol at Muslim weddings made for a wholesome experience. Suat had mentioned that they “went all out” since fruit was expensive."
