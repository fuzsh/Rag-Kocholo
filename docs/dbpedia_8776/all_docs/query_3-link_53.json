        "text": "Diyarbakır is often nicknamed the ‘unofficial capital of Kurdistan.’ But what exactly does that mean?\n\nThe Kurds are an Indo-European ethnic group native to parts of Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria. They have a global population of around 30 million, but Turkey has the largest number of Kurds by far, with around half the total population.\n\nMost Kurds in Turkey are concentrated in the east and southeast parts of the country, sometimes referred to as Turkish Kurdistan. And Diyarbakır is the largest and most important city in this region.\n\nThe Kurds, traditionally a nomadic people, have long sought to establish their own country. Over the course of history, various powers have used the Kurds to do their dirty work while promising them a homeland in return. But to this day, none of these promises have been fulfilled.\n\nFrom the 1920s, since the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, there have been numerous Kurdish separatist rebellions – all of them violently quelled.\n\nMore recently, terrorist groups like the PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party) have emerged. For the past 30 years, they’ve been waging war on the Turkish military and innocent civilians alike.\n\nIn 2016, fighting flared up between the two sides in Diyarbakır. A curfew was imposed on the city in an attempt to seek out suspected militants, and much of the Old City was destroyed in the turmoil. Tragically, hundreds of civilians also lost their lives.\n\nFortunately, as of 2020, the security situation is stable and the damaged part of the city is currently being rebuilt.\n\nThe PKK, of course, does not represent most Kurds, including other Kurdish nationalists.\n\nPresently, the closest thing to an official Kurdistan is the semi-autonomous northern half of Iraq, or Iraqi Kurdistan. But since the Kurds are present in four different countries, creating a single unified state is no simple task.\n\nTo make matters even more complicated, ‘Greater Kurdistan’ also overlaps with ‘Greater Armenia’ and ‘Greater Iran.’\n\nWith that said, not all Kurdish nationalists have such an ambitious goal in mind. Many simply want more rights and autonomy within their current countries.\n\nDuring your travels around east and southeast Turkey, you will hear the word ‘Kurdistan’ used quite a lot. Sometimes it’s merely used in a geographic sense, but often politically as well.\n\nIt’s best to avoid using this term in other parts of the country, however. It’s considered a taboo word that can even still get Turkish citizens into trouble.\n\nAs a foreign visitor, you will find the Kurds to be incredibly warm, welcoming and hospitable – especially if you’re a Westerner, as the Kurds have long considered the West to be an important ally."
