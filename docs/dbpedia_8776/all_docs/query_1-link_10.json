Supreme power is vested in the Sultan, who appoints his representatives based not on heredity or wealth, but on ability.\n\nThe Sultan appoints a Grand Vizier to administer the Empire and lead the Divan, and governors (Beys) to administer the provinces, called Vilayets. A select group of eleven Viziers meet in the Divan, a political body that allows them to debate the politics of the Empire and to make recommendations to the Sultan. The Sultan may take their recommendations if he pleases, but he may also reject them.\n\nProvincial administration is done through a dual system, with the military (Central System) and civil administration (Provincial Governing) seperate. The \"Central System\" is given orders directly from the House of Osman (The Sultan).\n\nOttoman Social Structure[]\n\nOttoman society is a class-based society, but with room for elevation, especially for those who serve in the military. The ruling class are called Askeri, and they comprise of the noblemen, military officers, and court officials. Religious officials are called the Ulema, and comprise of the muftis and imams. The m√ºteferrika are young nobles.\n\nGovernment[]\n\nPath to the Throne[]\n\nGrand Vizier: Ilyas Dana halil (Basil Brawlmonk IV)\n\nSultana Mary Anna Osman\n\nSultana Genevieve Osman\n\nSultana Sparky Whitewolf\n\nThe Sultan's Council[]\n\nGrand Vizier: Ilyas Dana halil (Basil Brawlmonk IV)\n\nVizier of War: Charles Warmonk\n\nVizier of Finance: Nathaniel Crestbreaker\n\nVizier of Foreign Affairs: Mathieu Venables I\n\nThe Crescent Court[]\n\nThe Crescent Court is an assembly of all territorial leaders of the Ottoman Empire.

They wear light armor, usually leather, and use a round shield. Typicially their first four ranks create a wall in which they use their spears to repel a charge, however the back ranks take advatage of their bows and unleash barrage after barrage upon the enemy once in range. These men are hardy fighters and since their additional training according with the new Ottoman style of war, are even tougher infantry. Recently, within the past 50 years, the Ottoman Infantry are now armed with long muskets, swords and small shields.\n\nSpahis: Spahi is an umbrella term which applies to light or medium cavalry. Many of these men have nomadic ancestors and provide their own horses, and sometimes their own arms. They use an assortment of weapons: Some use use a sword and bow alone, while others use a combination of lance and swords, and there are even some which use both spears and bows. All wear a light armor, usually leather, and use a round shield for protection. These horseman can be use to rain arrows down upon enemy formation, particulary the European pike formation, and charge home the attack when it is time. The horses they ride are often more superior to European horses, and are often able to stay of the reach of heavy enemy horseman - allowing them to pelt them with arrows as they pursue.\n\nSipahi: The Sipahi are drawn from the rich sectors of Ottoman Society, and because of this they typically were able to pay for the best of everything - cutting down on the cost of recruiting them. However, the new Ottoman system does allow for Sipahi to be recruited and supplied by the state but of course theire quality would be a bit lower. The horses that the Sipahi ride are the finest available, there stamina is near unmatched. These men wear heavier armor, usually chainmail, and have a round shield. These men typically harrassed the enemy with arrows, charged in with lances and pistol fire, and fought melee with their swords. They could often take on and defeat the heavy cavalry of Europe.\n\nPayade Top√ßƒ±: The name of these troops literally means \"Foot Artillery\", in simpler terms they are musket-armed infantry - they are the true regulars of the reformed Ottoman army. These men wear chaimail unlike the other infantry. On their backs they carry a round shield, and on their waist they carry a sword - these are their secondary weapons but their main weapon is the musket they carry into battle. Typically these men will stand behind the ranks of Ottoman Infantry and fire volleys of musket fire into the oncoming enemy - this added to the arrow barrage from the Ottoman Infantry themselves makes for a destructive combination. However, after the lines lock they typically switch to their secondary melee role and perform a flanking manuever in coordination with the cavalry.\n\nSvari Top√ßƒ± Neferi: The name of these troops literally means \"Mounted Artillery\", in simpler terms they are men mounted on horse and armed with specialized muskets. Basically they are Payade Top√ßƒ± who are given a horse and months extra training so that they may efficiently fire a musket from horseback. Their armor and arms are that of the Payade Top√ßƒ±. In battle these men will trot behind the line, and because of their height advanatge, fire over the heads of their men into the melee to kill the enemy. They are also excellent when used to destroy pike formations, and break an enemy cavalry charge - typically they can stay away from European heavy cavalry while harassing them with musket fire.\n\nNavy[]\n\nMediteranean Navy:\n\n80 Heavy Xebecs\n\n280 Xebecs\n\n48 Baggalas\n\nArabian Sea Navy:\n\n65 Xebecs\n\nFinance[]\n\nDomestic Commerce[]\n\nInternational Trade[]\n\nTrade Agreements: Mughal Empire (Silk, Tea, Javan Coca) Safavid Empire of Persia (Various goods) Great Britain (Various goods) Brandenburg (Muskets) Sweden (Muskets, Timber, Winter Gear) Tuscany (Muskets)\n\nForeign Affairs[]\n\nEastern Eurasian Union Member\n\nAllied[]\n\nFlag Nation Leader Status Ambassador The Kingdom of Britain King George II Allied Trade Partner Andrew Mallace Konungariket Sverige Drottning Elisabeth I Allied Trade Partner Kingdom of the Swiss Confederacy King William III Allied Trade Partner Empire of Ethiopia Emperor William Brawlmartin Protectorate Nation Empire of Romania Queen Genevieve I Protectorate Nation Kingdom of Sardinia King Ishmael Venables Allied Trade Partner\n\nNeutral[]\n\nFlag Nation Leader Status Repubblica di Genova Doge Ermmano No Tensions Repubblica di Venezia Doge Ernesto Vittorio No Tensions The Dutch Republic Koning Jarod I Low Tensions Â§ßÊó•Êú¨Â∏ùÂõΩ Â§©Áöá„Éì„É´Áï•Â•™„ÅÆÈ™® No Tensions K√∂nigreich Preu√üen K√∂nig Antonius I No Tensions Habsburg Empire Empress Maria Theresa No Tensions –¶–∞—Ä–∏–∑–º –∏–∑ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ —Ü–∞—Ä—è –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä–∞ Medium Tensions K√∂nigreich Bayern K√∂nig Nikolaus Nikolai No Tensions Reino de Portugal Rainha Gra√ßa I No Tensions Reino de Espa√±a Rey Felipe V No Tensions\n\nEnemies[]\n\nLand Possesions[]\n\nRegion (Province) and Land Asia\n\nAnatolia\n\nNakhchivan\n\nMesopotamia\n\nSamtskhe-Javakheti\n\nAdjara\n\nGreater Syria\n\nHedjaz\n\nKathmandu\n\nKarnali\n\nRapti\n\nJanakpur\n\nNarayani\n\nMahakali\n\nOman\n\nYemen\n\nAfrica\n\nEgypt\n\nDongola\n\nTripolitania\n\nCyrenaica\n\nEthiopia\n\nKenya (Province of Ethiopia)\n\nSomalia (Province of Ethiopia)\n\nHistory of the Ottoman Empire[]\n\nNews[]"
