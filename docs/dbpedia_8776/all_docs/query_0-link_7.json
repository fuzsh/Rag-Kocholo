        "text": "Leaving Egypt to the south aside, Diyarbakır and its environs were one of the empire’s most important grain supply centres in the east, from the year 1516 on, when the area became part of the Ottoman Empire. The vast Diyarbakır plain did not only feed the army on alert against Persia and Russia, the empire’s neighbours to the east. It also provided for army and navy forces in a broad geographical area that extended from Iraq to the Persian Gulf and from there to the Indian Ocean, forming infrastructure for the perpetuity of the empire throughout the early modern period (1400-1800).\n\nWithout wheat, rice and other important grains brought from Diyarbekir and its environs, the expansionist imperialist policy of the empire, spreading out towards the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, would not have been impossible. What rendered this policy operational was these significant raw material sources and at times, the existence of craftspeople.\n\nThe province that served as the grain storage of the empire in the east had further significant qualities than supplying wheat: Mining and lumbering.\n\nCopper mined at Ergani Maden was among the leading factors that made the area important for the empire. Raw copper mined here would be sent to Central Anatolian towns like Tokat to be processed and also transported to areas further south, like Iraq and the Persian Gulf. This important raw material source needed by the army and navy forces lost its former significance with the development of the arms industry throughout the 19th century, however, it remained a significant production item in the regional economy.\n\nThe environmental impact of continuous copper mining over centuries was enormous. The fuel needed to melt and process copper could only be supplied by using wood from the forests of Diyarbekir and the wider geographical area of Kurdistan.\n\nThe destroyed forests of Kurdistan in general and the Diyarbekir province in particular did not only cater for the wood needs of Ergani Maden. Forestry products brought from here also constituted the basic construction material for the mine site. Besides, timber harvested here was also exported to other regions of the empire that had considerable need for forestry products. Especially during the early modern period, timber brought from the Kurdistan heartland supplied a massive part of the requirements of the Ottoman Empire’s shipyards in Iraq and the Persian Gulf. Without the timber produced in Kurdistan, neither the shipbuilding industry at shipyards in Iraq, nor the imperial authority of the empire in the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean would have been possible.\n\nThe second ecological region can be described as the Diyarbakır Basin. In contrast to the mountainous north, the elevation of approximately 700 metres was much lower. Located to the south-west of the administrative capital and magnificently depicted by Ahmed Arif, the Karacadağ Volcano was the highest point of this region at 1957 metres.\n\nApart from the semi-mountainous and hilly terrains around Lice, Kulp, Sason, Beşiri and Siirt, this region was entirely formed of plains. In addition to Tigris and Euphrates, the Batman, Ambar, Sinan and Botan rivers were the main water sources of this central region.\n\nSiverek, Çermik, Ergani, Lice, Silvan (Farqin), Beşiri, Redvan and Garzan were among the leading agricultural areas in this zone.\n\nThe third ecological region can be divided into two sections in terms of the presence of water sources, elevation and differences in physical qualities.\n\nTur Abdin, the entirety of the hilly area to the north of the great Mesopotamia plain between the Tigris River to the east and Karacadağ to the west, formed the first part of this region. Further south, the conditions were even more arid. There were a few streams in addition to the Çağ Çağ River and the Tigris in the lands to the south-east of Viranşehir and Nisibin (Nusaybin). However, these streams were small and thus insufficient in supporting irrigation systems. This meant that fertile terrain suitable for agricultural production remained restricted.\n\nMardin and Midyat, both overly dependent on precipitation, were among other primary agricultural areas. Thus a series of climatological disasters that took place in the second (1844-1846) and final (1879-1895) quarters of the 19th century, threw social and economic life here into complete disarray. These disasters also caused mass animal deaths.\n\nFrom the late 1870s on, life in rural areas faced interruptions due to drought, resulting, for instance, in the abandonment of hundreds of villages around Mardin. Local people sought to balance out the arid conditions, or rather cope with the difficulty by building water wells and cisterns, to be used in irrigation as well. It was thanks to these irrigation wells that commercial agricultural products could be produced in the region, with tobacco first and foremost among them.\n\nGeographical differences within these three ecological regions, rendered some ecological areas more vulnerable to changing rainfall patterns. In the mountainous northeast, around Malatya, Harput, Çapakçur, Kulp and Lice, winters tended to be extremely cold. The winter snow allowed highly nutritious grass and other plants to cover the plains throughout, feeding hundreds of thousands of small and large cattle in the summer months. In the central plateau surrounding Diyarbakır province, summers were hot and winters cold, even if the precipitation was less. Further south, the climate resembled desert conditions; summers were hot. In these areas, in the months of July and August the temperature rose above 40 degrees Celsius at times.\n\nThe use of land and settlement also varied in these regions because of differences in elevation and precipitation. Thanks to rich water resources that created fertile land and enabled irrigation, the Diyarbakır Basin became the area of most intense agriculture in the region. Watered by various tributaries of the Euphrates, the Malatya and Harput Plain had been cultivated less compared to the central region.\n\nThe southern parts of Diyarbekir were mostly covered with orchards and pastures. Typically low and stunted and occasionally as short shrubs, oak was the most common tree. In addition to the oak tree, poplar, the most useful tree for the construction industry, grew particularly on land with high humidity around villages. There were good pastures in the meadows extending between the mountains to the northeast of Diyarbekir province. Plateaus along the skirts of Karacadağ formed further significant grazing areas in the central part of the region. Other than this, there were highly fertile pastures in Mardin and its south and especially the flatlands of Northern Mesopotamia.\n\nThis entire geographical zone and flora began to undergo major change in the 20th century. This was a transformation carried out by human hand. Control mechanisms that expanded along with the nation-state and the centrally planned and rurally implemented systematic policies of the technocratic worldview increasingly led to massive environmental destruction.\n\nToday, the sequence of dams that pervades the entire area from end to end does not only bury deep river valleys, towns and ancient cities of tens of millennia under water. Dams also submerged the endemic flora and wild life of this region. Besides, gigantic dam lakes also triggered changes to the region’s arid and semi-arid climate.\n\nThe Diyarbekir described by Ahmed Arif remains only in lines of poetry and archive documents. Today there is a different Diyarbakır, a different environment, a different flora and a different climate.\n\nWhat tomorrow brings will therefore be determined by the destruction and pillaging taking place today."
