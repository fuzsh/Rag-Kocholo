        "text": "Social Relations in Ottoman Diyarbekir, 1870-1915 offers new, microhistoric and non-nationalist perspectives on the late 19th century history of the province of Diyarbekir. Focusing on a period dominated by violent conflicts between the authorities and various local elites and population groups of the region – urban Muslims, Kurds, Armenians, Syrian Christians and others – this book offers new insights into the social history of the region and the origins of the Armenian and Kurdish \"Questions\", which were to gain such prominence in the 20th century. This book is one of the important sources to understand the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire, and especially in the Diyarbekir region.\n\nMicro-historical investigation of the 1895 massacres in two rural districts of the Ottoman vilayet of Bitlis, Hizan and Şirvan. It builds on the assumption that wider issues can be better understood through a close study within a limited geographical frame, one that enables an identification of the various sectors, local and external. The article contains a village by village count of the number of the victims and an investigation of the perpetrators and their motives. Though the number of victims was considerably lower than often assumed it is demonstrated that the massacres were a traumatic experience and a terrible economic blow for the Christian population (Armenians, Assyrians) of the area and an important step in the kurdification of the region. a correction (footnote 3, p.126) It should be remarked that the characterisation of Edip Gölbaşı's article, \"1895-1896 katliamları: Doğu Vilayetlerinde cemaatler arasında \"şiddet iklimi\" ve Ermeni karşıtı ayaklanmalar\" (2015) (\"E. Gölbaşı presents a summary of events based largely on my articles\") that did appear in the printed version of the article does not do justice to the range of sources employed by the author. For Turkish readers this overview article is recommended as an introduction to the 1895-1896 massacres.\n\nThis article contributes to the slowly growing literature on the 1894-96 Massacres by a microhistory of the event in the city of Harput (Kharpert/Harpoot) on November 11, 1895. Historians shedded light on the structural reasons behind the event and identified the individuals in charge but the collective aspect of the massacres has so far been neglected. In this study, the narratives produced before, during, and after the event are isolated and compared in order to reveal a fundamental change in how the event was described. The article argues (i) that the massacres in the city center were not expected by its residents, (ii) that the event was perceived as an invasion of the city by outsider Kurdish tribesmen rather than an Armenian conspiracy, and (iii) that the reports written after the fact, including those of the officials, missionaries and Armenians, all left out the Kurdish invasion from their later narratives."
