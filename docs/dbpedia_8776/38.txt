The Vilayet of Diyâr-ı Bekr[citation needed] (Ottoman Turkish: ولايت ديار بكر, Vilâyet-i Diyarbakır)[3] was one of the Ottoman vilayets. The vilayet extended south from Palu on the Euphrates to Mardin and Nisibin on the edge of the Mesopotamian plain.[1] After the establishment of Republic of Turkey in 1923, the region was incorporated into the newly created state.

At the beginning of the 20th century it reportedly had an area of 18,074 square miles (46,810 km2), while the preliminary results of the first Ottoman census of 1885 (published in 1908) gave the population as 471,462.[4] It should be noted that the accuracy of the population figures ranges from "approximate" to "merely conjectural" depending on the region from which they were gathered.[4]
