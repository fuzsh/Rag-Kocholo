For the very next episode to air after the shuttle’s loss, the Enterprise production family offered its own somber tribute as a silent opening message: “To the memory of the Columbia crew... You will always be an inspiration”—just as Star Trek IV remembered the Challenger crew, who were lost only months earlier in 1986. Likewise, it turns out that one of Columbia’s gallant seven, Michael Ander¬ son, admitted in many interviews to being “fascinated\" with Star Trek and other science fiction as an inspiration to get into space. As with retired astronaut and fellow African-American Mae Jemi- son, who famously did a walk-on guest spot for The Next Generation, Anderson found \"the right stuff” in himself partly thanks to a bright future offered on tele¬ vision long ago by a fellow former.Air Force pilot named Gene Roddenberry. Both space travelers, in turn, proved an inspiration to the generations after them. If there is anything to take heart from in Columbia's loss, it may be that this space tragedy—as much as any space tri¬ umph, sadly—has refocused how the great silent majority in America believes in the need, and even the inevitability, of pushing beyond our little planet. Not to equate fact with fiction, but the events of real life may even re-awaken a jaded fan- addictive spirit of optimism and faith in the future underlines why a rookie pro¬ ducer's failed little TV show would not go quietly into cancellation oblivion in 1969. Sure, the Nemesis box office tally was decidedly down, setting off think tanks both at Paramount and among fans (just check out our Letters this issue).The still- soft state of Enterprise TV ratings has oth¬ ers worried, even as the show continues to evolve and find its voice. Are these really signals, as for the umpteenth time since 1967 (or even 1964, if you go back to CBS' rejection of Gene’s first pilot) that this will be the End of Star Trek As We Know It? Well, I think not—and to prove it,just scan this latest issue—including our new recurring feature, First Person Fandom. We felt too much early fandom history was going untold toyoungerTrekkers, so look for more of these reminiscing profiles from time to time.

It was a tragic day, not only for the United States and the families of the crew of space shuttle Columbia, but a tragic day for mankind. The men and women of the Earth's space pro¬ grams, past and present, are the pio¬ neers taking us into the final frontier. They are our Captain Archers and Cap¬ tain Kirks.The men and women whose courage and-devotion creates the step¬ ping stones toward that future that was the vision of Gene Roddenberry. They personify the sprit of StarTrek.... Every astronaut and cosmonaut liv¬ ing and dead will always hold a special place in our memory as they pave mankind’s way to the stars. Let us look up at the stars and each of us remem¬ ber those past heroes that we have lost and those that we lost on Feb. 1— remember them all, in our own ways, for they are the future. They are the first to boldly go where no one has gone before. And for all who follow them to the stars, Oo'p/ol TROY M. GRACIE ALAMEDA, CA In light of the recent tragedy of the space shuttle Columbia, the opening of [Enterprise ] is, in my opinion, more powerful than ever! Anyone, any politi¬ cian or taxpayer, who feels that Amer¬ ica’s space program should be stalled should sit through the opening. The images of our past, present and Gene Roddenberry's vision for the future of space travel, combined with such a fit¬ ting song, really conveys the wonder and hope this final frontier brings. I believe if we have “faith of the heart\" and \"strength of the soul\" we really can \"reach any star.\" Thanks to the show's crew for stick¬ ing with this fabulous opening and bringing us more great StarTrek adven¬ tures! MARY ABBOTT NORWOOD, OH nemesis vsrdicta ... Nemesis [is] a great Trek movie, and while not perfect it’s still the best of the TA/C-era films. I’m sorry the box office has been disappointing, but I am convinced that it’s the fault of releasing it in such a crowded movie season (just five days ahead of The Two Towers\\). ... I can’t tell you how much I enjoyed Riker and Troi’s wedding—I smiled and laughed through the entire scene! It really was like visiting old friends again.The action scenes really rock, and the final Enterprise-Scimitar battle is awesome! It ranks right up there with Wrath of Khan and The Undiscovered Country as one of Trek's most exciting space battles. Jerry Gold¬ smith’s music is the best in years, and the effects are once again outstand¬ ing. (Finally, the Enterprise-E gets the screen time she deserves!) The ending left me completely choked up—it’s one of the most emo¬ tional StarTrek experiences I've had in years. Picard's smile as he walks down the corridor is a warm, wonderful final image of the captain.... ELROND LAWRENCE SAUNAS, CA ... Not since Star Trek III has there been so much character development among an Enterprise crew in a motion picture.... B-4 was charming in his own right, though I hope the intention isn’t that he will become a sort of replacement for Data in future films or even a katra- style resurrection plot device for Data himself.... JASON MOE LAKEWOOD, CO ...

All letters must be signed, include city/state, and marked that they are for publication; email addresses will be used unless otherwise instructed. Concise, single-topic letters are always preferred. I have done since Sept. 8,1966, the more disenchanted I’m becoming.... Nemesis was a disaster. There were so many story holes, and it seemed it was just random scenes all thrown together. It seemed way too much of a headgame theme, and headgames do not come out on film very well.... What about the race that chased Picard and company in the dune bug¬ gies. Why no exploration of who they were?... Why did Geordi, Beverly, and Worf have practically nothing to do in this movie? Picard’s toast at the beginning of the film was far too light-hearted, and whimsical, as if Picard was totally drunk as he was making it—far out of character for the captain of the Federation flag¬ ship. Why was a captain that was lost for several years in the Delta Quad¬ rant now promoted to admiral,telling the finest present captain of Starfleet what to do?... ... Why don’t you retire the fran¬ chise with honor instead of continu¬ ally ruining what was once a highly respectable family of players, and a show that enlightened thousands of lives. Enough is enough. Normally I have nothing but praise for the cast, crew and writers involved in the StarTrek universe. Unfortunately, my letter does not include praise, but unhappiness with the decision to sac¬ rifice Data at the end of Star Trek Neme¬ sis. Since this was the last StarTrek film likely to feature the Next Cen cast, manyfans, myself included, would have preferred an ending akin to that in Star Trek VI.... This must rate as one of the top Trek movies (my other favorites. The Wrath of Khan and The Undiscovered Country). Shinzon, in my opinion, is the best Villain since Khan (Tom Hardy is awesome — what talent and physical presence). Everything in the film worked: the cinematography, the acting (as always), the story, the edgy tone of the dialogue, the atmosphere of fore¬ boding and final resolution to some old story lines.... After seeing Nemesis, my passion for ST has flared up again.... [In ST II] Khan’s motives were very simple: revenge. I do not believe that the average moviegoer would be able to pick up on the motives of the new villain, Shinzon. As a ST fan, I commend John Logan for his efforts to give us fans a great movie. I do think, however, that it is a movie that you have to see more than once for it to be fully appre¬ ciated ...

I often hear criticism of Star Trek for not taking risks—well, Data’s death was a great risk! And it gave Star Trek more realism because things change, people move on, and people do die. I hope that the producers and writers will not \"back pedal” out of fear and try to resurrect Data.... ... I hope the message gets to the studio that while the loyal fans will always go to a new StarTrek movie, if you want to reach a larger audience you need to advertise A LOT, and plan when you release the movie a lot more carefully.... I mentioned to sev¬ eral people I work with that I was going to see a new Star Trek movie and they all responded with, \"There’s a new one?” AARON A. DESKIN PICARDS_PROTECEl@STARTREK.NET ... I even saw [Nemesis] twice on the opening weekend and I thought it was a great movie, but I was disap¬ pointed when it only did Number 2 at the box office and really dropped.... I really hope this won’t be the last Star Trek movie with the Next Generation crew 'cause I have stood by them for the past 16 years and I will stand by them till the end. MICHAEL MULUS CORDELE, CA As for Nemesis and its box office, this is something we just do not under¬ stand. Nemesis was a truly enjoyable, thoughtful film—objectively and sub¬ jectively. The acting was first-rate, espe¬ cially Tom Hardy and Brent Spiner as B-4.The story dealt with many topical issues. What makes us human? Are we the product of biology or environ¬ ment/experience? Cloning? The music was remarkable, and is great to listen to on its own. In many ways, it is the best of the Next Gen films. We have seen it three times and each time we get something new from the film. We think part of the problem is the reviews. For instance, Roger Ebert's review was—in our opinion—a non¬ review. He reviewed StarTrek in general, not the film, with very generalist com¬ ments. ... Another element, we think, is the plethora of reviews coming from Internet sites and persons. For instance, some popular StarTrek websites post reviews of Nemesis and episodes of Enterprise from reviewers whose cre¬ dentials we wonder about. Who are these people? Have they gone to film school? Have they taken literature classes? Of course, they have an absolute right to their opinions and to post them on the Internet (that is the great thing about the Internet), but we have an absolute right to ignore them. We think that the general negativity on such sites and by some of these review¬ ers did some harm to the box office take, as well, and also added to this inane \"Star Trek is losing steam” notion so popular in the mainstream press. Star Trek generates, we read, nearly $200 million a year in advertising and products alone. If that is losing steam, get us on that train! Unfortunately, too many fans are buying into this main¬ stream nonsense and staying away from a really nice, sweet, action-packed film. We only hope that Paramount makes enough from overseas box office and DVDs to justify another film. In any case, Nemesis was a great film and Enterprise is still one of the best hours on television (should we watch the generic sitcoms this week to see which character is sleeping with which other character, or watch a show about ideas, action, and human issues?). In closing, we would like to leave our fellow fans with some positives. First, the Club promises improvements and we look forward to them. DSg will soon be released on DVD. Larry has a new edition of his excellent TNG Com¬ panion. Nemesis (with additional footage, we hope!) will be released,too. Enterprise continues to sail. And, there are always reruns on TNN!

It has not done as well as we had all hoped. The reason for that is very enigmatic. There is no way to tell exactly right now. Do YOU THINK OPENING IN DECEMBER, WITH SO MUCH COMPETITION, HURT IT? Well, it is really easy to be a Monday¬ morning quarterback. You can blame it n the competition,you can blame it on what month it was scheduled to be released in, you can blame it on the movie itself,you can blame it on the fan base deteriorating to some degree. I think it is silly to make a guess as to what causes a film to do very well or not do very well. When will the film be released on DVD? We’ve already prepared a lot of infor¬ mation for the DVD release. We have a wonderful narration by Stuart Baird and a lot of extra scenes added and a lot of interviews with a variety of people. It will be a lot of fun. As to when they are going to release it, I don’t have a clue. [Just at presstime, Paramount Home Entertainment announced a May 20 release.] Will there now be additional SCENES ADDED? I think we have decided, after dis¬ cussion, to throw in a few new scenes. There are a lot of scenes in this movie that were cut. Almost all of the scenes in this movie that were cut out were cut because the movie was too long, not because we didn’t like the scenes. interview media dossier lettere What direction do you believe the STUDIO WILL TAKE NOW WITH THE STAR Trek film franchise? Will it be years BEFORE WE SEE ANOTHER FILM? I wish I had an answer for that. This film did not perform as well as the last couple of movies, and that will obviously influence Paramount’s position of when and howto continue the film franchise, but we have not had a single discussion on that yet. I think it is a little premature for me to be guessing. What do you think needs to BE DONE TO BRING AUDIENCES INTO THEATERS SO THAT THESE FILMS HAVE A BETTER BOX OFFICE? DO THEY NEED A BREAK, SOME TIME OFF, OR DO WE NEED A WHOLE DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT ALL OF IT? If people knew what it would take to make box- office hits they would be very rich. Whether it means a change in cast or a partial change in cast, or whether means a longer wait, or it means a drastic change in concept, I don’t know. We will obviously be discussing that over the next year, and everybody will take an educated guess. Who do you believe Star Trek’s pri¬ mary AUDIENCE IS NOW? ARE YOU SEE¬ ING YOUNGER FANS COMING ONBOARD, OR IS THE AUDIENCE JUST GETTING OLDER AND OLDER? If you realize that The Next Genera¬ tion has been off the air for eight years, the fans of that series have obviously gotten eight years older. Indeed, the younger ones are no longer young, and the older ones are eight years older. I think that, definitely, if you are consid¬ ering The Next Generation, which has had the biggest audience we have had since the original series, you realize that the audience has grown a bit older and the younger audiences are more familiar with Deep Space Nine and Voy¬ ager and Enterprise. I think the fact that our core audience has gotten a little bit older is something hard to ignore. We also have a decent size younger audience, and that demographic is something we can't overlook. 7 would be open to characters from all five series.\" Would you personally like to see A FUTURE FILM WHICH COMBINES MEMBERS OF THE VARIOUS STAR TREK CASTS? I have thought about that. I have discussed it with a few people. It’s possible. Obviously, we did that with Generations. Now that we have The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise, I think the sky is the limit in terms of mixing and matching. Does that include the original SERIES, TOO? I’m open to everything. I haven’t locked in to any specific players. I would be open to characters from all five series. Since Enterprise is only in its second SEASON, HAS THAT CAST BEEN RULED OUT AS BEING IN THE FEATURE FILMS? Absolutely not. Do YOU THINK THAT THE MARKET HAS BEEN OVER-SATURATED WITH STAR Trek, like giving people their FAVORITE FOOD UNTIL THEY’RE OF IT AND DON’T WANT MORE? It is definitely a pos¬ sibility. I certainly would not go so far as to say it is the reason. But I have always said—and you can go back and look at com¬ ments I have made for the last 10 years—that you can take too many trips to the well. Star Trek can be over-exposed; the audience can be saturated with Star Trek. It is definitely a possibility. But I think that if you look at the first-night grosses of the movie, which are almost entirely fans, the fact that those first-night and sec¬ ond-night numbers were considerably down from previous movies tells me that the fans were just not coming out like they were before. I think the promotion for the movie was excel¬ lent—the TV commercials and the trailers were good. We didn’t have any major competition that week, so I think the fact that the first weekend box-office was down is definitely an indication that the fans were holding back a little bit. That is certainly a major comment, and whether that has to do with the over-saturation of StarTrek is a very valid question. Any new directions for Enterprise THE REMAINDER OF THE SEASON? I think we’ve just got some really good episodes ... . We have a great episode called “Stigma,” which I think you'll enjoy. We have a wonderful episode coming up that deals with the Temporal Cold War [\"Crash Landing”]. We’ve got a very cool Klingon episode [\"Judgment”] and another Andorian episode, with Suzie Plakson playing a remarkable Andorian soldier [“Cease Fire’’]. We have some very dramatic and exciting episodes coming up. We’re working our way towards the end of the season—we’re hoping to have a ter¬ rific cliffhanger at the end. I think as these characters get more complex, because they have a season and a half of back stories now, it’s getting more fun to develop the interrelationships between them. that’s where our focus is right now. Has there been any more talk of BRINGING BACK CHARACTERS OR SPECIFIC ALIENS FROM THE ORIGINAL SERIES? Yes, we always play with that. We’re bringing the Andorians back, and we are bringing people from the far distant future back, and we’re bringing back the Klingons. You’ll also be seeing the Tholians.We have a good mix of aliens coming up. Does the movie franchise affect the WAY THE STUDIO LOOKS AT THE TV SERIES? Well, the motion picture division and the television division of Para¬ mount are quite different. I am not cer¬ tain that there is that much focus from one to the other. I am sure there is some degree of that taken into con¬ sideration on both sides. Rick, thanks for the update. My pleasure. We’ll keep you posted when anything new comes up. Q You have to remember, since the last movie, there have been 21/2 years of Voyager a nd 11 /2 yea rs of Enterprise on television.That is 104 episodes and four seasons; also, part of that was a new series coming out. Has there been an over-saturation? Is it because the audience has gotten older? It's any¬ body’s guess, but I think there is prob¬ ably truth in all of it. Will you and Paramount be DISCUSSING SOON THE DIRECTION THE FRANCHISE WILL BE TAKING IN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS? Yes, I think so. We’ll see. I think it is too easy to make guesses right now. ■ OFFICIAL PROP REPLICAS COMING SOON IN 2003 \"V.

But just as we believe that the best and only answer to the tragedy, after suf¬ ficient inquiry and correction, is to \"climb back in the saddle” of crewed space exploration, so too must we never forget the lighter side of it all. Weeks before the feb.i Columbia tragedy, Communicator contributor Philip Chien provided a brief look at son le of those recent fun moments at NASA involving its mutual love affair with Gene Roddenberry’s equally futuristic dream. We present them, as planned, as a testament to the good humor of heroes as well as their courage, intelligence If |jjj rf-; :: nasa meets a car tire International Space Station Alpha is gradually evolving—and the long¬ time NASA/Star Trek connection is very much intact. With most of the station’s major construction complete—the remain¬ ing American, European and Japanese modules are due over the next two years—more time can be spent on working science. NASA’s advisory pan¬ els recommended that each crew have a trained scientist assigned as the \"sci¬ ence officer,’’ so it's almost inevitable there have been plenty of comparisons with the most famous science officer of all time—Spock! The first astronaut to hold the title \"science officer” was Peggy Whitson, a biochemist and a member of the Expe¬ dition 5 crew aboard Alpha when NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe made the announcement. O’Keefe said NASA would designate a science officer for each Expedition flight from now on. \"And given your qualifications, we are asking you to serve as the first,” he told Whitson, who said she was honored to accept. \"I obviously don’t mind the new title,\" she later noted in an email to friends, \"in spite of the fact that my many supportive friends have sent an incredible amount of Star Trek/Mr. Spock-related email!” -again \"I think it’s important not just as a symbolic effort, but a substantive one,” O'Keefe said, \"which recognizes we’re transitioning from an engineering proj¬ ect to a scientific operations objective. On every flight, every mission will incor¬ porate a very ambitious scientific agenda. Our imaginations are the only limit to what we can yield from this marvelous remarkable facility that gives us the 'gold standard' for micro¬ gravity conditions, which we couldn’t possibly duplicate on Earth. Peggy will be the first of many, every single mis¬ sion—every expedition, we will have an officer onboard who is responsible for the scientific content.” The new title doesn’t come with a pay raise or added job benefits, though, but it did come with a pair of pointed ears. For Halloween, Whitson decided to dress up for the part and put on a pair of Spock ears to show off to Mis¬ sion Control. “I hope your Halloween celebration on Earth is going okay,” she radioed, in her most Vulcan-like tone— to which Mission Control replied:\"You know, Peg, there just isn't much you can say at a moment like this.” \"Peggy, being the only U.S. crewmember onboard, has been doing the lion’s share of the U.S. research onboard,” said space station manager Mike Suffredini during her stint. \"So, as science officer, from her perspective it really hasn’t changed much of what she has done. It doesn't change her duties; she’s been working very hard on orbit to get all the research done that the teams desire and it didn’t change her work¬ load. When she comes home, we hope to use her to decide exactly what the sci¬ ence officer’s roles and responsibilities are when there is more than one [Amer¬ ican] crewmember onboard.” Whitson returned home in Decem¬ ber after a six-month stay in space and the replacement crew included Alpha's second science officer, nuclear physicist Don Pettit. When Whitson signed off with the science control center for the final time she said, \"I just have a few special words for you: 'Live Long and Prosper.’\" Q —Philip Chien T 1 PI CO^*» TT^fj W STAR TREK COMMUNICATOR « THE MAGAZINE OF THE OFFICIAL STAR TREK FAN CLUB □n-unE! startrEhFanclub.cam TDLLi FREE! 1 [SOB] 3D3-1B13 The boundaries oF space and time don't applawhenyou use star trek communicator to put yourself in touch with five Starfleet crews from three different centuries and a 35 -year science fiction legacy.

With patience as infinite as space itself, however, Montgomery is not one to complain;, as he awaits his own chance to shine, he lives by a wise motto: Come what may ...weather it and smile. The grandson of legendary jazz gui tarist and composerWes Montgomery, Anthony Montgomery is a relative new¬ comer to Hollywood. With guest stints on JAG, Frasier and Charmed, as well as a semi-recurring role on the short-lived comedy series Popular, Montgomery had only appeared in a small handful of films before landing the part of Travis Mayweather on Enterprise —films like Leprechaun in the Hood and ESP: Extra Sexual Perception, no less. Enterprise is not Montgomery’s first encounter with Star Trek, as he audi¬ tioned for the role of Tuvok’s son in an episode of Star Trek: Voyager entitled \"Repression.” He didn't get the part, but producers Rick Berman and Bran¬ non Braga asked him back to read for a lead role on Enterprise .\"It was a trans¬ mission of his son,\" recalls Montgomery. \"It wouldn’t even have been a physical character in the studio—and had I got¬ ten that, they’ve said I would never have been read for Travis in the first place, so I’m glad I didn’t get it!\" To date, only six actors—Majel Bar¬ rett, Michelle Forbes, Armin Shimerman, Max Grodenchik, Tim Russ and Robert Duncan McNeill—have earned an ongo¬ ing role on StarTrek after first appearing as a different character, so Montgomery is likely correct in assuming he would not have gotten both roles. That such a loss would lead to a better gain is no surprise to the actor, who embraces the concepts of destiny and Cod’s will. “My mother told me, growing up, that if God closes one door, another one opens,” he says. \"I truly believe I did not get that role because of Travis —this is where I am supposed to be at this time in my life.” One thing is clear when speaking with Montgomery: He’s very grateful to be a part of Star Trek. His reaction to the show and his co-stars is unend¬ ingly positive ...with one exception: \"If I can say I am dissatisfied with any¬ thing,” he considers, \"it’s just the fact that I want to work more. As an actor, I want to act—I want to be given the opportunity to do what I do—and sometimes I’ve felt stifled in not being able to get out there and do me.” eventually. “They’re going to,” he insists. “They just have to make sure the tri- fecta ofTrip.T'Pol and Archer is always met because that’s the key.\" What Montgomery hopes for with his character is not necessarily center stage (though obviously that would suit him nicely), so much as knowing that his presence matters. “Some of my favorite episodes, I can say honestly, are ones that have all of us. I don't really have to feel like, 'OK, this episode’ is about me, so I feel like I’m working.’ As long as my character is working toward the common good on the ship, then even if you just hear Travis says such-and-such'or‘Travis thinks this-or- that,’ I'm fine with that,too.”The impor¬ tant thing, he says, is to feel utilized. \"If \"Rs an actor. I uiant to act -1 mant to be given the opportunity to do uihat I do-and sometimes I've Felt stiFled in not being able to get out there and da me.\" Still, the actor stresses, he’s not com¬ plaining. In fact, he’s quite happy. “I signed on to be part of an ensemble cast,” he says.“l just need to have that release as an actor,as an entertainer, as j a performer. I get a bit frustrated in that I’m not able to get that release out, but when I can go work on a good play or go do other things outside Enterprise, then I still get my release so it’s OK.” Mayweather’s lack of development, the actor notes with irony, is most noticeable not when Travis doesn’t have anything interesting to do... but rather when he does .\"People will call, or I’ll get fan mail or something, saying,‘Oh my God, they finally gave you something to do in an episode!”’ Ever the optimist, Montgomery is able to laugh good- naturedly about this, confident that the writers will get to his character not, that’s kind of a downer. But these guys [Berman and Braga] are great. I’ve had an open dialogue [with them] since I got the job.\" The actor is aware that other Trek veterans have left over similar frustra- : tions or a yen to expand into other fields. However, you won’t find Mont¬ gomery running for the unemployment line any time soon. “A lot of those people, I was told, took it almost personally, and then there becomes this big feud between that actor and the writers, and that actor and the producers,\" he offers. \"Not me. I’m like, ‘Guys, I am blessed. I know how blessed I truly am.’ So it’s not that big a deal to me—really it isn’t. As long as I know I’m going to be working, and as tongas I do other stuff to feel complete, to feel satisfied as an entertainer, then I’m fine.” The golden rule, he says, is not to take it personally. \"There are seven people. The show's not called Star Trek: Mayweather. It’s not called The Travis Show. So I’m really not worried about it. I make sure I keep dialogue open with them, and if any insecurities set in, if ever I'm feeling like maybe it’s something I'm not bringing to the table, I go right to Rick or Brannon. I don’t go to the writers because they're only going to put out what Rick and Brannon OK ... and then I don’t worry about it. I just have to get it from them that everything is fine, and then I don’t stress it.” Coming from Indianapolis, and hav¬ ing had very little for most of his life, Montgomery says he is blessed to be a part of the Star Trek franchise with all that it has afforded him so far. \"I’m able to travel around the world,” he says. “I’m known in Germany now—and I’ve never even been to Germany!” Going from obscurity to instant worldwide recognition was a bit over¬ whelming, the actor admits. \"Yeah, man, it’s wild!\" he exclaims.“That’s the biggest adjustment I’ve been making. I mean, I haven’t been everywhere, so it’s not quite an issue yet ... but it's going to be.” He gets fan mail from around the globe, most recently from Germany, Australia and New Zealand. \"Just knowing I’m someday going to have the opportunity to go to these places, that’s better for me than I could ever put into words! It’s incredible.This is an opportunity of a lifetime, and I would never walk away from it. They’ll have to kick me off the set!\" Montgomery knows how lucky he is, especially for someone so new to the neighborhood. \"I’ve only been in L.A. six years, and I’ve come farther than some people have in 60 years of living in California. And I’m not done—I’m still just getting started\" Fame, how- cver, has not changed him at all. he believes. \"Do I live my life differently? No. Do I put my pants on differently? No. I was a positive person before I got the show, so I just try to do more, and now that I'm given an opportunity like this, I try to utilize that to do more of what I was doing before.” The actor’s gratitude at being a part of StarTrek partly comes from his own status as a fan and his knowledge of Trek’s importance to television history. \"I am more a fan of the original series than anything else,’’ he admits, “and then Next Generation!' He remains in awe of Nichelle Nichols for her role in \"opening the doors” to African-Ameri¬ cans on television. \"She did more by being on the bridge than all of those people running around screaming mil- itantly, trying to say they want to do everything but truly doing nothing. By her just being there, and doing what she did, she broke down so many incredible barriers.\" Nichols, says Montgomery, is the reason he’s able to do what he does now, and he’s honored to be able to continue opening those doors, no mat¬ ter how much or how little May- weather has to do in any given episode! “Not being a drug dealer... not being a gang-banger... I am so blessed and excited and happy that I get to be a part of what Nichelle started, being the positive African-American on tele¬ vision.\" In keeping with that philoso¬ phy, Montgomery devotes much of his time to an organization called Stop the Abuse Against Families Founda¬ tion, or STAAFF. “Having never had much in my life,\" he says, “it’s really easy for me to do the things I do now—to work with the char¬ ity I work with, to try to help kids see they can do more.” staaff, a Los Angeles- based non-profit group, is committed to ending family violence, domestic abuse and stalking, by working with jjglj abuse centers, corporate partners and law enforcement officials!

I staaff has been a happy outlet for Montgomery to channel his fame, but he admits there is one bit of his new¬ found fame that really stokes his ego. \"I’m an action figure!” he revels with a laugh.\"Oh my God! I’ve got my entire career to work on getting an Oscar— that’s the ultimate. I will keep con¬ stantly working to get better as an actor, and if I’m truly blessed and the planets align, then I will have Oscar on the mantel. In the meanwhile, I’ve got a 7-inch version of me!” When he first saw the figure, Mont¬ gomery called his mother, ecstatic. \"I said,‘Mom, you are not going to believe this.’ Then I said, ‘You know what, I’m not even going to tell you.’And I bought a couple of extras and I sent them to her, and she was like,‘Baby, I got them!’ and I was like,‘I know, Mom, I’m an action figureV\" Being immortalized as a toy, he feels, was the culmination of all his hard work until that point, bringing an overwhelming realization that he’d done what he set out to do. \"If I stop now, I've already done more than most anybody in my family. I could have been a product of my environment—I wasn’t always an actor, you know—so the fact that I’m even out here right now, all I can do is smile. I smile brighter than the brightest star, I promise!\" If that weren't enough to smile about, Montgomery is finally getting his wish regarding Travis’s role on the show. \"The episode we’re about to shoot [“Horizon”] is a huge episode for my character,\" he beams. \"It’s not just big, it's huge. You get to meet more of my family; I'm not going to give a bunch away because I want people to tune in, but basically, you get to go to ... well,, from what they’re telling me, we're actually going to get to see my cargo ship, the cargo ship Travis was raised done it before; you've seen him get hurt on a glacier, having only seen snow twice. So I just want him to keep grow¬ ing, and that’s what I tell the writers: Whatever it is we’re going to do with Travis, I want to feel like he's evolving into whatever is next for him.\" That journey, so far, has taken Travis from a cargo ship to Starfleet and out to the great beyond. So where will the future take him next? The actor says he doesn’t know—or if he does, he's not telling.\"! have no idea,\"says Mont¬ gomery, \"but as long as it continues to go, I'll be there for the ride. I’ve already strapped on my seat belt, and I hope everybody else does as well.\" 9 Rich Handley is the regular RecDeck columnist for Star Trek Communicator, and also writes for several other publications.

I want him to be able to grow as a person because as Travis grows, I know I'm growing as an actor. In the episodes they’ve aired so far,you’ve seen him fly a ship through a minefield, having never ^ on. You get to meet Travis's mother, e you get to meet Travis’s brother, so it’s □ going to be a really intense episode. I u can’t wait!\" w As Montgomery's star burns brighter, £ so, he hopes, will that of Travis May- c weather: \"I just want Travis to continue n: ui :: it’s been e long raed... J ust at presstime, Montgomery caught up with Commu¬ nicator after he had filmed his character's first spotlight show,\"Horizon” [tentatively airing April 16]—and he couldn’t be happier. \"In this episode,\" he says,\"you see more than just the pleas¬ ant Travis you’ve seen. You see the inner workings of the machine, and it was wonderful.” He could not praise his guest “family\" too highly, either—Joan Pringle as Travis’ newly widowed mother and Corey Mendell Parker as his brother Paul. “It was a really touching episode for me,” Montgomery recalls. “You get a feel of how hard it was for Travis to leave the family to join Starfleet.” In the story. Enterprise is sent “backward\" 30 light-years to study an unusual star, giv¬ ing Mayweather the chance to visit his family’s cargo ship nearby—an unexpectedly tense reunion. Montgomery hopes this isn’t the last that the audience will see of Mayweather's family, as he enjoyed working with Parker and Pringle and hopes to develop their storyline further. “I don't expect it to happen any time in the near future ... [but] when we do it again, hopefully the same actors will be available to play the family again. The more time we work together, the more we're going to look like a family unit.” Despite the show’s importance for him, Montgomery says he was very conscious to be considerate of his “guest”family. “I’ve worked with some leading actors as a guest star,” he says,“and not everybody, but enough where I felt the entire scene was just about them. So I [had] said, Alright, Anthony, whenever you’re in this position and you’re blessed to be able to do this, you make sure you’re giving to your guest actors as well as getting from them.’ And i do feel like I accomplished that.” Sensors show even more ahead. The day he updated Com¬ municator, Montgomery had finished some coaching on rock- climbing, as Travis is called upon to do in the very next episode, “The Breach.”“l used to host a kids’ adventure show [Awesome Adventures], and climbed several times on that,\" he notes. Still, he jokes, when did Travis become an expert? “He was born and raised on a cargo ship\\\" he laughs.“It’s not like he had a Holodeck to practice on, so when did he learn to rock-climb? When did he get the angst to go out and do all these thrill-seeking things?” But, as always, you won’t hear Anthony Montgomery complaining. \"Mayweather is \"the thrill-seeker of Enterprise,\" he acknowledges. \"I myself have to find the happy medium, but Travis is very proficient at doing these things!” In any case, as Montgomery's alter ego gets the chance to evolve, the actor plans to enjoy the ride, no matter what: \"We're going to be fine, it’s going to be fun, and there’s definitely going to be more of Travis!\" Q COMMUNIC Check rjur our scretenshatm af cne 5zar Trek dinartFlasft™ Universe at i/y m m, sir jar i flsashcard.com and get ijaur Smart Flash™ 1 card set rude v^SMARTFLASH THE ULTIMATE INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE Each card takes you to a different se. ^ 1 . (U C > sTja JRE - + ri ffW V 2B ra T wo years ago this summer, writer Chris Black decided it was time for a vaca¬ tion, No television staff jobs had turned up for the upcoming fall season, despite his resume of free-lance and staff work—much of it tilted toward fantasy and sci-fi.The July Fourth holiday rolled around and found him back in his native Ohio for a family barbecue, resting up before an apparent year of free-lance work. \"So, all my brothers and sisters-in- law and nieces and nephews are there, and my cell phone rings—it’s my agent!” the Toledo native recalls with a smile.\"And we're cooking burgers, and I'm like, ‘I gotta take this, it’s my agent!'—and they’re all like, \"Oh yeah, Mr. Bigshot Hollywood i And then his agent dropped the bombshell: Would a staff job on Enter¬ prise be of interest? \"And I was like, 'What, are you crazy! Of course I’m interested!”’ laughs Black, a Trek fan since boyhood. One phone call with executive pro¬ ducer Brannon Braga, who grew up in nearby Canton, and one meeting With exec producer Rick Berma weeks later Black found himself on a Paramount soundstage amid the, icons of his childhood. \"They were shooting Roxann [Dawsonj’s show ‘The Andorian Incident’ the week I actual showed up,” he recalls,\"and I couldn’t believe it, you know? To go the set and see Andorians there their antennas moving around Vulcans, and guys running around with phase pistols, flip-open commu tors—I'd thought I’d died and gone heaven! ”1 was actually a little young when the original series was on; I mean, I remember being a kindergartener and seeing the 'salt vampire,'the M113 crea¬ ture, and running out of the room in terror,\" he remembers, chuckling. But then came rerun fandom in the ’70s, his first convention in Columbus (\"My Dad drove rhy friend Jeff and I from Toledo, a three-hour drive—James Doohan and Bruce Hyde and Grace Lee Whitney were there; [we] were just in hog heaven!’’) and the TNG years, before work got in the way of the later series. But don't paint Black as another \"overnight sensation”; he's more than earned his stripes coming up through the TV trenches. \"I grew up with all my friends and I running around with our Super-8 movie cameras, wanting to be film makers,” he recalls. After a Star Wars- inspired career at USC film school (George Lucas'alma mater) the would- be scribe by day drove a delivery van and ran a movie-theater film projec¬ tor; by night, he like his pals stuck to the dream of a seven-figure script sale. All but pals Tom Spezialy and Alan Cross, who got into TV and went on to run USA Network’s Weird Science-, their friend Black, a self-professed \"feature- film snob,”wouldn’t budge. “I finally just went, 'Well, OK, I’ll deign to do televi¬ sion!” Black says now, laughing at his attitude; a spec script led to two years on staff, and he never looked back. Scripts for Poltergeist: The Legacy, Xena: Warrior Princess, and the two-hour pilot for TV’s brief The Magnificent Seven on CBS fol¬ lowed, along with two seasons on loring the scripts to take advantage of those strengths, and it's really the most fun time to be on the show, the first season,” he says. \"I was the last guy to come on board at that point—they had already bro¬ ken a dozen stories,” he adds. \"Bran¬ non was great about letting me sort of figure things out. I immediately sat in on story meetings, pitch meetings, pro¬ duction meetings, optical meetings... going to the stage, meeting the pro¬ duction people, meeting the actors— just living and breathing Enterprise.\" In fact, it was \"BreakingThe Ice” that brought him face-to-face with Star Trek’sfabled \"well-oiled machine.”\"That was when I realized they really pull out all the stops for this show,\" he says. \"It just feels sometimes like there’s virtu¬ ally nothing that they can’t do!‘Guys!, can you turn Stage 9 into the surface of a comet?’—'Yeah, when do you want it by?' They’re completely unflappable, and their work is consistently brilliant. And they’re such a nice group.” Black earned full or partial credit on three episodes by first season’s end— although he is quick to point out how misleading TV writing credits can be. For instance, he notes, his \"Rogue Planet” script began as an in-house pitch by story editor Andre Bormanis about a sunless, orphaned planet that is still “Class M” because of its extreme geo-thermal vents; another was doing some kind of a \"safari show,” and Berman brought the idea of the Yeats poem Archer quotes, having the captain \"To go damn to the set and see Rndorians there tuith their antennas moving around, Rnd Uulcans. and guys running around ujith phase pistols. Flip-open communicators-l'd thought I'd died and gone to heaven!\" staff for Sliders, supervising producer on Cleopatra 2525, and a fond year on USA’s short-lived The Huntress —can¬ celed right before that Fourth of July trip back to Ohio. \"They were right—TV is a blast!\" he says. \"I had done some feature develop¬ ment work for a time, and you could just see things be stuck in development for two years, and the writers would get fired and new writers would come on.... Where in TV, you pitch an idea and you can see the story, you break it out,you write the script, and they go out and shoot it and a couple weeks later it’s on. And you hope it’s great—and if it’s not, you go, ‘Well, we got 21 more to go!’ If you’ve been lucky like I have, [you also] work with ... talented, fun, cre¬ ative people who enjoy what they do.” R lthough a big SF reader as a teenager, and a fan of the original Star Trek and TNG as well, Black says he never thought of himself as a “sci-fi writer.” Weird Science was a sitcom, he notes, but the title gave it a sci-fi feel that colored most of his jobs and led him to Enterprise —and he’s not com¬ plaining, especially in the series' semi¬ nal season. \"You sorta learn what [the new cast’s] strengths are,you start tai¬ who had been an idol ofT’PoW’Toss in a final script by his old friend Alan Cross of Weird Science days and a notable guest turn byFionnulla Flanigan as V’Lar, and the show was one of his favorites. \"There’s great insight toT'Pol in that episode,\" Black goes on. “Plus, I love the fact that we ran the ship up to Warp 5 for the first time—and it’s not even good enough!” Having Trip sweat bul¬ lets over his engines—“I don’t know how much more I can give you!’’—was a fun homage to Scotty, too, he reveals. The story also answers critics who have been unhappy with the way the Vulcans have been treated in the series, Black adds—especially since their spy- ing on Andoria from the ancient monastery on P'Jem was exposed in Season 1. “We took a lot of heat on 'The Ando- rian Incident' that [the Vulcans] flat- out lied—they flat-out lied —that they have this spy station there,” he admits. “There's no two ways about it. But it’s very logical for them to do so—they have an ongoing, potentially volatile border dispute with a very hostile, unpredictable race, and they need to keep tabs on them.” Too, he offers, all but two or three of P'Jem’s residents truly were monks or supplicants, unaware of the base. “I certainly don't think we want to ; portray the Vulcans as being war-like— I don’t think they make war;’’ he adds. “But I don’t necessarily think they're conscientious objectors, either,-1 mean, Spock never hesitated to use his phaser when the situation called for it.... Cer¬ tainly the Vulcans have a security serv¬ ice, they have a High Command with a fleet of [very powerful] starships, and they apply that power judiciously and logically in their own self-interest when they need to.\" V'Lar of \"Fallen Hero,” though, helps restore the balance. \"You see a character who’s noble, who is self-sacrificing, who—when confronted by Archer—tells him the truth because he deserves to know,” Black notes.The ending, he adds, intentionally offers V’Lar's comment on Archer and T’Pol’s cooperation as a \"glim¬ mer of what is going to come when you get to the original series’’a century hence. Just as importantly, meeting V’Lar has an effect on Archer and his long¬ time Vulcan grudge as well, Black notes: \"He’s always been very wary of them, and felt that his father wasn’t allowed to see his dream realized because the Vul¬ cans had been withholding information from him. And then to meet a character like V’Lar... now, he's learning that T’Pol somehow touched by some kind of alien creature. F rom that, the story evolved into one of alien hunters whose prey turns out to be shape-shifting crea¬ tures seeking protection from the Starfleet visitors.The show posits that hunting as sport has become passe on Earth by Archer’s time, but Black says - the script was not meant as an ant hunting story. “We didn’t want it to be a A preachy episode—my Dad has hunted for years, and it’s not some¬ thing I feel particularly strongly about,” he explains. \"It’s only when it's revealed that they’re hunting intelli¬ gent species that it becomes an issue The plot did give Black a chance delve into the character of the enig¬ matic Reed, whose Royal Navy lineage leaves him intrigued by the newcom¬ ers' tactical elements of hunting and tracking. \"So when he says to Archer, ‘Don’t worry, captain, I won't kill anything’— Dominic actually delivered that line a little more slyly then I intended; you’re not entirely sure he means it!” Black reveals. \"Which was something that Dominic did; I told him later I thought was wonderful because it wasn’t really in the script, but his take on the char¬ acter was ‘Well, he might like to take a shot—you never know.’ \"I always hear stories about dis¬ gruntled writers, griping about how the actors'screwed up’their dialogue,” he adds. “Believe me, I have the exact opposite point of view ... they make me look good week after week!\" \"Fallen Hero,\" his next story credit shared with Berman and Braga, began simply with a disgraced Vulcan ambas¬ sador to be ferried home. \"And when we sat down and started kicking around the story, I was the one who said,'Well,.what if we make it a woman and someone \"UJe wanted to have Rrcher involved in a little intriaue, to put him into an almost Cara Brant-lihe role From a Hitchcoch movie-where he meets Grace Kelly in the villa next door and she's very mysterious.\" isn’t the exception—that there are many Vulcans who are honest and noble, loyal and helpful.” B esides, the basic Trek time¬ line presents an even big¬ ger problem in evolution.\"In a decade or so, the Federation is founded,” he says of the Enterprise era. “You think we’ve got to bring the Vulcans a long ways in a hundred years [to Spock’s time]—we’ve only got 10 years to get the Andorians there!” If “Two Days and Two Nights” wasn’t Black’s favorite credit of the season—he wrote the teleplay from a Berman & Braga story—it was more due to situa¬ tion than anyone’s fault. “We got down to the end of the season, and we were really up against it in terms of budget; we would have loved to do more with Risa, and we found out we just couldn’t afford to,” he explains. “We had been talking about doing a shore-leave episode literally from the time I showed up.\" Fans should know that TOS canon came into play here, too. The Keeper’s planet from “Shore Leave” was consid¬ ered and quickly tossed out since it was new to Kirk, Black says, while Wrigley’s Pleasure Planet—mentioned once in \"The Man Trap”—sounded too human and too well-known for this distant region.\"So we went with Risa,\" he adds, \"because it’s something that’s been established, and the Vulcans have been there and T’Pol would know about it\" Of all the episode’s fun side plots and performances by the regulars, he explains, the Archer storyline was per¬ haps the most tweaked from start to finish. “We wanted to have Archer involved in a little intrigue, to put him into an almost Cary Grant-like role from a Hitchcock movie—-where he meets Grace Kelly in the villa next door and she’s very mysterious. More of a flirtation than a full-blown romance [here]; we didn’t want Archer to be ‘involved.’ We want to try and keep the captain a little bit reserved and above that, for now—which isn’t to say he isn’t going to have his ‘City on the Edge of Forever’ episode at some point in the future.” Despite Bakula’s performance, Black feels the script was hobbled by the sheer need to explain the back story of “Detained\" once the mystery woman was made an agent of the earlier episode's Tandarans and Colonel Graff. “So I don’t want anyone to get the impression that I didn’t like ‘Two Days and Two Nights’,\" he emphasizes. \"I did like the show, but you always go through the process and kind of kick yourself when you think, 'It could’ve been more!'—when you wanted to do something a little extra and you either did¬ n’t have the time, which is very much what working in televi¬ sion is all about, or the money.” Since the end of his \"rookie” sea¬ son, Black has added another tele¬ play credit for \"Carbon Creek” and solo credits for\"Singularity” and “Cease Fire.\" he has eased into the series, he is still well aware of fan reaction and the growing pains yet ongoing. \"I hope the fans enjoy seeing these characters being fallible and having fears,\" he reflects. “I don’t think we want to de-mythologize Starfleet; we don’t want to make these characters look like they're bumbling their way through the universe! But we very much want to maintain that sense that they're just figuring it out. And they’re going to make mistakes... but they’re going to learn from these mis¬ takes.” Like crew, like writing staff? \"We work hard, we put in long hours, we work weekends ... And sometimes... it doesn’t always work!” he admits with good humor. \"There's an occasional mis¬ fire, you know, but I think we have a pretty good track record.” 0 Look for more insights on his Season 2 epsiodesfrom co-executive producer Chris Black in Communicator #145, our annual Review/Preview TV issue- Dawson particularly liked Jeffrey Combs' Shran, the leader of the Ando¬ rians, who returned in the episodes “Shadows of P’Jem\" and \"Cease Fire.\" : \"He was wonderful to work with,” she: says. “He really created an extraordi¬ nary character there, didn't he?\" \" At the end of \"The Andorian inci¬ dent,\" Captain Archer (Scott Bakula) and his crew find a hidden surveillance facility under the monastery, proving the Andorians correct. The teleplay of the episode was written by Season i staffer Fred Dekker, with a story by Dekker and executive producers and co-creators Rick Berman & Brannon R oxann Dawson reels like almost no time passed oetween tne day sne last donned B’Elanna Torres’ makeup for Star Trek: Voyager and the day her first Enterprise directing job began. \"I really feel like I haven’t left,” she laughs. \"Enterprise started up right after we wrapped, and I think I did the fifth episode. It wasn’t very long at all.\" Dawson’s first Enterprise episode was \"The Andorian Incident,\" which reintroduced the Andorians, seen in the original Star Trek series. These Andorians attacked the Vulcan monastery at P’Jem, insisting that the Vulcans were using the facility to spy on them. Dawson was worried about the appearance of the Andorians. \"I was told they were going to be blue with antennae,\" she recalls. ”1 was concerned about it when I first read it in the script, because I didn’t want it to look like the original ones that they had in the old Star Trek days. I wanted to make sure we had some¬ thing updated, something believable, something scary and threatening. I thought, 'How can we make this work?’ But we did, I think. Now they are becoming a regular part of the Enterprise world.” \"I thought that was particularly good writing on their part,” Dawson notes. \"It's nice when they can throw in curves like that, and make you seethe gray in issues. Everything is not black and white. I think that Star Trek works best when it's exploring the gray areas, whether it be of human nature or political issues. We don't come down on one side, being too politically cor¬ rect or being too preachy, but we pres¬ ent a problem and you see there are issues on both sides that need to be explored.” The next script Dawson directed,\"Vox Sola,” called for an alien life-form to invade the ship and engulf various crew members. Envisioning and executing that concept was no mean task, she notes. \"That was probably the most difficult episode to bring to life on the screen what they had written on the page, which was this creature that has to grow in size and ensnare our crew in its web-like tendrils,” she recalls. “You go, 'How do we do something like this?’To have to create that was an extraordinary job, and it required all of the depart¬ ments coming together to work.” The actors trapped in the alien ten¬ tacles, especially Bakula and Connor \"Trip”Trinneer, had to do some rather unpleasant work. \"They were har¬ nessed, stuck up there for hours, and smothered in goo,” Dawson recalls. \"It was a terribly difficult episode for Scott and Connor. But they were such troop¬ ers, it was amazing.” And it was all recorded:The making of \"Vox Sola” was documented by a PBS television crew as part of what will be a short series. \"It will be featured on a show called On The Set on PBS,” Dawson explains. \"They are exploring the making of dif¬ ferent television shows. They followed me from inception through post[-pro- duction] on this particular episode.They go into great detail on how we created this from the page to the screen.\" \"Dead Stop” was Dawson’s next episode, her first for Enterprise's sec¬ ond season. This show posed its own unique production problems, as the script called for a space station that could repair anything but used living beings as an energy source. “We wanted a very different feel, an antiseptic feel, almost like 2001: A adapted from the same-named BBC hit. \"It's a new NBC show that they are looking at to go into the Friends slot, when Friends leaves,\" she explains. “I had a great guest starring role in the pilot, the only guest star in the show. I had never done a sitcom before, and when the script came to me, I thought, 'This is such a fun role. I have to go in on this.' I was very pleased to get this role and to do it.” Nevertheless, Dawson feels that Voy¬ ager and her half-Klingon character have had their day. “I thought Voyager was an extraordinary seven-year experience,” she says. \"But the makeup was very gru¬ eling for me. I had seven years with a great character. As far as the acting side Of myself, I’m really ready to try other things. I think that that character, and that experience, had a great run. I don’t know that I would want to return to it in any way, at least not in that form.\" But she will no doubt be back on the Paramount lotto direct Enterprise, whenever she gets the call. Q Space Odyssey,\" Dawson says. \"That's what we were going for in style, and I think that it was accomplished. It was such a stark difference from Enterprise. Its brightness—I loved the contrast to the deep, dark underbelly that had all of these bodies. I thought that the design elements that we finally brought together really worked in terms of the storytelling.” Dawson also supplied the voice of the space station’s computer. \"Rick Berman requested that I do it,\" she explains. \"I had some ambivalence about that, because I didn't want peo¬ ple to recognize my voice and for that to take away from it. I thought, 'Maybe they won’t,' but I guess most people did recognize my voice. I did it as an uncredited thing, but didn’t stay a secret too longl” Next up for Dawson was “Dawn,” written by co-executive producer John Shiban. In this story, Tucker is attacked by a territorial alien, with whom he ends up being marooned. \"‘Dawn’ is a beautifully written episode,” Dawson says. \"We've got a great guest star, Gregg Henry, [whose] character has been trying to shoot at Tucker’s ship—and in the process,they both crash-land on this moon. They have little hope of being rescued, and have to learn howto communicate and get along in order to survive. It was wonderful character exploration. Gregg is extraordinary, as well as Connor, and their relationship grows and develops. I think it’s a really wonderful episode.\" Dawson is particularly happy with the extended fight scene in \"Dawn.” \"We worked extremely hard on [that] with our stunt co-ordinator, Vince Deadrick,” Dawson notes. \"They wanted it to be the longest and biggest fight that Star Trek has ever had. It ends up being about two-and-a-half minutes long, and it’s a very pivotal moment in the script. I am very proud of it. The two actors and our stunt doubles did great jobs.” Dawson was due to return to Enter¬ prise to direct a fifth episode in March. She also helmed an episode of Charmed and tried to fit The Division into her schedule.

TM, ® & © 2002 Param DECIPHER The Art of Great Games .startrek.com One of McNeill’s first directing assignments after Voyager wrapped was Enterprise's first-season episode “Cold Front’’This presented a challenge, since the Temporal Cold War was and still is somewhat unclear to many view- ; ers, and apparently, to some directors. ‘“Cold Front'was interesting,”McNeill explains. \"They were just trying to begin this concept of something that I think is going to be a real foundation of this series, which is chasing down these guys, and tryingto explain this Temporal Cold War. It was made to be a real enigma in the episode that I did, and therefore it was really hard to pinpoint in terms of performance, or the way it was shot, or what I should be doing. \"I’ve seen quite a few of the Enter¬ prise episodes,\" he adds. “If I had to pick, I would have picked probably another episode to direct. But it was a m ore than a year and a half after the end of Voyager, Robert Duncan \"Tom Paris\" McNeill is enjoying the kind of post-Star Trek career he envisioned for himself—right in his own kind of \"center seat,\" the director’s chair. But now, tired from almost too much work, is McNeill questioning his ideas? Far from home, he is preparing to shoot an episode of Dawson’s Creek in North Carolina. “What was I thinking?\" he asks, laughing. \"I must have been crazy. You know, it’s like‘Be careful what you wish for!’ I wonder if it’s what I really wanted. This season I have worked nonstop, which is really exciting when I think about it—but it is really exhausting doing it right now.\" Of course, McNeill is following in the footsteps of other StarTrek actors who have gone on to direct, including LeVar “Geordi” Burton and Jonathan \"Riker\" Frakes, both of The Next Generation cast. \"I remember Jonathan Frakes, one of the first times I met him,\" McNeill recalls. “Fie said,'You know, I hear you want to direct. Everybody tells me you are going to be the next Jonathan Frakes. What are you, insane? You work io times as hard and you get paid a tenth of the money. Go be a TV star. What are you, crazy, wanting to direct?’ “But it’s been a good year,” McNeill admits. “I’ve done four episodes of Dawson's Creek so far. I did an episode of Everwood, the new Treat Williams show. I'm going to do an Enterprise [tentatively titled “The Breach,” air¬ ing April 23], then back to Dawson’s Creek, and then over to do a show for Dead Zone.” fun experience to be working with the same crew, yet on a different space¬ ship, and similar things and similar styles of shooting and performance, yet very different because of the new actors.lt was fun.\" McNeill was happy to get to direct Scott Bakula as Captain Archer. “I had worked with Scott Bakula as an actor many years ago on Quantum Leap,\" McNeill explains. \"I did a guest star role on that show. I was very impressed with Scott when I worked with him on Quantum Leap —and even more impressed to see him a little more closely as a director. He is a real profes¬ sional, and he really sets the tone for that whole show in terms of attitude and professionalism.\" As is the case in many episodes, Bakula’s character was placed in pre¬ carious positions in “Cold Front.” \"We had some stunt sequences in the episode,” McNeill recalls. \"He had to hang off of rails, being sucked out into space. He chose to do all of the stunts, hanging up on the rails, high above the stage, by himself. He didn’t have a stunt man do it. He did it over and over, because we had some technical problems, and he never complained. He was great.” In \"Cold Front,” Connor Trinneer as Chief Engineer \"Trip\"Tuckeralso had a fair amount to do. McNeill enjoyed working with him. \"Connor Trinneer is great,” McNeill says. “He is very easy-going, very friendly, very open, easy to talk to. I squeezed in a Star Trek convention [later on] and Connor was there. We had dinner together, and that was very nice—to spend some time away from work, comparing notes.” McNeill has certainly had a long journey since leaving Tom Paris behind, both as an actor and a director. “The day after we wrapped on Voy¬ ager,” he recalls, “I got on a plane and went back to the Hamptons to do this low-budget horror movie that I think is finally coming out on video, Infested. We had a fun time making it. It was just a silly romp of a horror movie version of The Big Chill. I did that, [then] I went off ol the last Outer limits /episodes as an actor..Then: I started directing at Dawson's I did the [sea son] premiere of Classing iorddn as an, actor this year.:I started directing in: ; August, and I really haven’t stopped.” McNeill was happy to work on a show like Dawson's Creek. “I have to say, when I left Voyager, I was so excited to come over and work at Dawson's Creek,\" he admits. \"It was such a differ¬ ent kind of show. It was a real charac¬ ter-based show. It was all about character and dialogue, and very little action—very little plot, sometimes. I was really excited with that change, because Star Trek is such a plot-driven show, and such an action show. It's all about a very strong plot, and very tech¬ nical. Dawson’s was not; it was more tone and mood and style.” But after all this time, McNeill is ready to return to the Paramount lot. He was happy to get the call to direct another Enterprise episode. \"Now that I have done so much Dawson's Creek, I am so excited to go back to Star Trek,” McNeill says, sincerely but not without humor.“Let’s do some special effects for a change! I don’t want to talk to actors about character any¬ more—I want to shootptiasers and blow up ships! I'm just excited to go back and see all the old guys.” Q B ince McNeill's Paris and Roxanne Dawson’s B'Elanna i were'married near tjre end of Voyager, the actors : worked out something special for Las Vegas con-goers last fall. \"Roxann and I found a play called The Blue Room,\" McNeill explains,\"which is two actors playing different couples [for] io scenes. In each scene, one of the actors switches to a new character, so it’s like these love relationships—these part¬ ners—pass on.They have a romance with one person, then the actor switches to a new character, and then they have a romance with that. Then the second actor switches, and it just keeps going down the line. \"It was a really interesting play for us to do at a conven- tion,\"he adds. \"Because of the whole Tom Paris-B'Elanna rela¬ tionship, I think it was interesting for the fans to see us playing all these different characters in these romantic sto¬ ries/' ; 18 - * ' \" j |jg gi ij ■ li \"I’m hoping that we’ll have a chance to do it again,” Dawson adds.\"It was a good choice.and I was very pleased with how we were able to adapt it.

So I was Leslie from then on. He would say set and be in makeup; I’d get in and get my own makeup on 'Warp Factor One, Mr. Leslie.’” and be in costume, and I’d stop by his dressing room and ask That hi if he wanted a cup of coffee. He’d be in there with his dogs, meet—evi Doberman pinschers, which scared the hell out of me at pole. \"You That higher profile of sorts helped Paskey make ends ;et—even at the bottom of the show business totem le. \"You went in on a regular daily salary as a stand-in, first—but they were good dogs.

The speakin e $125 a day, but if you went into overtime or double-time, or went on location, you’d get triple-time because of the hours.\" The glamour of stardom had its own risks, however, as the new thespian found out.\"My first time delivering lines in ‘The Naked Time’ I was so nervous I could barely read them,” Paskey recalls.\"They wrote the lines down on the monitor in front of me, and I went through the two lines and dropped the third one, and Leonard Nimoy jumped in and picked up the third line right away, saved the shot and saved me. That's something I appreciate so much, because I was embarrassed.” □ f course, the most dangerous job on Star Trek was security guard: the legendary, ever-expendable \"red- shirts,” always first to die on any exploration of an unknown planet. With Lt. Leslie enduring numerous shifts on security detail, Paskey knew that death could lurk behind every Sty¬ rofoam rock.\"l was very, very careful about dying on camera, because I wanted to stay on the show!” Paskey says.\"l would 'get lost’ in certain circumstances; I wouldn’t be around when they’d decide who was going to die in certain scenes. The security guards were always dispensable!\" Despite all the strategy, even Paskey couldn’t hold out for¬ ever against the “curse of the redshirt.” Leslie’s time finally ran out in Season 2's \"Obsession,\" in which he is clearly shown on camera (in close-up, no less) having his red corpuscles drained by the gaseous alien \"vampire cloud.” Remarkably, Leslie shows up the following week looking none the worse for wear. \"When I finally went to these conventions, everyone came up to me and said, ‘You're the one who dies in an episode and then comes back to life the next week!’ ” As Paskey explains, however, he accepted the job with the understanding that his character wouldn't really be dead.\"ln the script, at the end of the show, there were wordings about the people that were killed being brought back to life—for continuity. But they never shot it. So I knew it was going to happen, but I knew from reading the script that I would not really be dead.” His constant set presence gave Paskey a unique perspec¬ tive on the work of the show’s cinematographer and lighting crew. \"The beautiful part about the original Star Trek was that the lighting was so super,” Paskey says.\"Jerry Finnerman, the cinematographer, had such a way with colors. You don't even think about it, but with me being a stand-in I was there all the time [to focus lights for a scene]. He would flood a whole wall with magenta or, if an actor had a little bit of gold in their hair, he would toplight them with yellow. His way of flooding the set with different colors was just amazing.” Paskey also got to be on good terms with not only Shat- ner but with the lighting crew in general. \"I would watch the rehearsals an"
