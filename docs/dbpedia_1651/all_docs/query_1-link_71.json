THE STAR TREK ENCYCLOPEDIA: A REFERENCE GUIDE TO THE FDTURE INTRODUCTION The Star Trek saga now spans more than three decades, far longer than anyone imagined when Gene Roddenberry’s creation first hit the airwaves in iMgJStaLlMJtoSiqdeed become an icon of 20th-century popular culture. Yet because of this extraordinary success, it has become increasingly difficult for those involved with the show (either as viewers or as writers and production staff) to remember the enormous body of details that has been created for the show. This book has been created to help keep track of all that stuff. This updated and expanded (1999) edition includes material partway through the 1996-1997 production seasons of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager. The special supple¬ ment at the end of this edition completes the 1996-97 season, as well as the entirety of the following year, and covers part of the 1998-1999 season. In compiling this! material, we have assumed editorially that both authors and readers are residents of the future, a number of years aftei the current Star Trek adventures. This is our attempt to place everything in a historical perspective. Dates indicated in this work are drawn from our own Star Trek Chronology: The History of the Future, 1 996 edition, pub¬ lished by Pocket Books. We have stayed fairly strictly with material only from finished, aired versions of episodes and released versions of films. We have not used any material from the Star Trek novels or other publications. This isn’t because we don’t like those works (we’re quite fond of many of them, and we hope this information will be useful to our writer friends), but as with the Chronology, we wanted to create ^-reference to the source material itself-^— that is, the episodes and the movies. This way, anyone building on this Encyclopedia can be reasonably sure that his or her work is directly based on actual Star Trek source material. In a related vein, this work adheres to Paramount studio policy that regards the animated Star Trek series as not being part ojMhe “official” Star Trek universe, even though we count ourselves among that show’s fans. Of course, the final decision as to the “authenticity” of the animated episodes, as with all elements of the show, must clearly be the choice of each individual reader. Episode numbers. In the main listing for each episode, we have indicated an episode number. These are not Paramount’s internal production numbers (which are sometimes confusing), but are simply the number of that episode within that series in order of production. In other words, “The Cage” (TOS), “Encounter at Farpoint, Part I” (TNG), “Emissary, Part l”,f(DS9), and “Caretaker, Part I” (VGR) are all episode #1 of their respective series. The suffix (TOS) indi¬ cates an episode of The Original Series, while (TNG) denotes an episode of The Next Generation, a title labeled (DS9) is from Deep Space Nine, and (VGR) is an episode of Star Trek: Voyager. (For those who simply must know: Episode numbers assigned to episodes of the Original Series are indeed the internal Desilu/Paramount numbers. Studio production numbers for Next Generation episodes can be determined by adding 100 to our episode number, so that “Encounter at Farpoint, Part I” is procfuction number 1 01 . The same numbering scheme was used for episodes of Voyager, as well. Add 400 to our episode numbers to get production numbers for Deep Space Nine episodes, so that “Emissary, Part I” is production num¬ ber 401 . To further complicate matters, the two-hour pilot movie versions of the three new shows were also assigned the production dumber 721 . Don’t ask us. It has something to do with studio accounting.) Please note that boldfaced items indicate cross references to other entries in the Encyclopedia. If a word is bpldfaced, it means there is an entry by that name containing related information.

These people appeared largely human with the exception of a facial cleft in their foreheads. They are also notable for individualized decorative facial tattooing. Acamarian blood is based on an unusual iron and copper composite, making it readily iden¬ tifiable. Within Acamarian culture, member¬ ship in a clan is considered of great social and political importance, and conflicts between the various clans often became violent. One such feud, between the Lornaks and the Tralestas, lasted some three centuries, and ended only after the last Tralesta was dead. The Acamarian government, headed by Sovereign Marouk (pictured), extended an offer of reconciliation to the renegade Gatherers in 2366. The negotiations, mediated by Jean-Luc Picard, were even¬ tually successful. (“The Vengeance Factor” [TNG]). SEE: Yuta. ACB. SEE: annular confinement beam. accelerated critical neural pathway formation. Medical proce¬ dure that uses genetic recoding to alter the brain of a humanoid patient.

Accolan. (Dan Mason). Citizen and artist on planet Aldea who would have helped raise Harry Bernard, Jr., child of an Enterprise- D crew member, had Harry and other children remained on Aldea in 2364. (“When the Bough Breaks” [TNG]). aceton assimilators. Weapon used by the ancient Menthars in their war with the Promellians a thousand years ago. Aceton assimilators could drain power from distant sources (such as an enemy ship), then use that power to generate deadly radiation to kill the ship’s crew. The Menthars placed hundreds of thousands of these devices in the asteroid field near Orelious IX, thus trapping the Promellian cruiser Cleponji a millennium ago. The devices remained active for centuries and trapped the Enterprise-D there in 2366. (“Booby Trap” [TNG]). acetylcholine. Biochemical substance, a neurotransmitter that promotes the propagation of electrical impulses from one nerve cell to another in carbon-based life. Spock performed an acetyl¬ choline test on a huge spaceborne amoeba creature that destroyed the Gamma 7A System in 2268, although McCoy felt the test was improperly done. (“The Immunity Syndrome” [TOS]). Levels of acetylcholine in the hippocampus can quantify the amount of memory an individual has accumulated. (“All Good Things...” [TNG]). The clamps implanted in Akritirian prison inmates were designed to stimulate the production of acetyl¬ choline in the hypothalamus to stimulate their aggressive tenden¬ cies, thus keeping them at each other’s throats. (“The Chute” [VGR]). Achilles. (Max Kelvin). Popular gladiator on planet Eight Ninety- Two IV. Achilles fought McCoy and Spock in the planet’s televised arena in 2267. (“Bread and Circuses” [TOS]).

(“Starship Down” [DS9]). Adam. (Charles Napier). Follower of Dr. Sevrin who sought the mythical planet Eden in 2269. The musically inclined Adam died when he ate an acid-saturated fruit on a world he thought was Eden. (“The Way to Eden” [TOS]). Charles Napier also played General Rex Denning in “Little Green Men” (DS9), and country - and-western singer Tucker McElroy in The Blues Brothers. Adams, Dr. Tristan. (James Gregory). Assistant director of the Tantalus V penal colony in 2266. Adams seized control of the colony after director Simon Van Gelder became insane from testing a neural neutralizer device. Adams later died from exposure to the unit. (“Dagger of the Mind” [TOS]). adanji. Variety of incense used in the Klingon Mauk-to’Vor ritual. (“Sons of Mogh” [DS9]). adaptive heuristic matrix.

Akorem, who had not aged at all, believed that his experience in discovering the wormhole and encountering the Pro¬ phets made him the Emissary of the Bajoran people. Benjamin Sisko willingly relinquished the title to Akorem, who immediately instituted a series of conservative reli¬ gious reforms in Bajoran society. Unfortunately, certain traditional Bajoran values, such as the discriminatory D’jarra caste sys¬ tem, while comforting to Akorem, were no longer appropriate in modern Bajoran society, and even infringed on individual rights. Akorem returned to his own time after the Prophets made it clear that he was not the Emissary of Bajoran prophecy. Akorem’s return to his own time caused a change in the time¬ line. Instead of disappearing in 2172, Akorem returned from his voyage to live out his life, even completing his epic poem, The Call of the Prophets. (History had previously recorded that the poem was unfinished at the time of his disappearance.) Such alternations in time would ordinarily be undetectable to individ¬ uals within the affected timeline, but for some reason, Kira Nerys retained a memory of the changes, even though Akorem THE STAR TREK ENCYCLOPEDIA: A REFERENCE GUIDE TO THE FUTURE ALDABREN EXCHANGE 5 evidently did not.

The three fathers, along with Curzon Dax (godfather to Kang’s son), swore a blood oath ot revenge, so the Albino spent decades in hiding. The four nearly caught up to him at planet Galdonterre, but the Albino’s informants tipped him off, and he fled. In 2345, the Albino went to planet Secarus IV, where he remained in hiding until 2370, when Kang learned his whereabouts. The Albino offered a fair fight, but instead tried to booby-trap the four.

Planet, long thought to be mere legend, discovered in 2364. Aldea was held to be a peaceful, advanced world where technology provided for every citizen to pursue intellectual and artistic endeavors. The legends had a basis in truth. The Aldeans had indeed achieved an idyllic existence, then used a powerful cloaking device to mask their planet from potential intruders. Over the centuries, the planet, located in the Epsilon Mynos sys¬ tem, faded into the obscurity of legend. Unfortunately, the plan¬ et’s cloaking and shielding systems caused damage to the plan¬ et’s ozone layer, resulting in widespread radiation poisoning to the Aldeans. Eventually, the Aldeans became sterile, unable to bear children. Finally, in the year 2364, they attempted to kidnap children from the Enterprise- D crew in a desperate bid to perpet¬ uate their society. After the attempt failed, starship personnel assisted the Aldeans in dismantling their shielding systems so that the planet’s ozone layer would have a chance to return to normal.

(“Relics” [TNG]). Data served some Aldebaran whiskey to Scotty after he expressed displeasure with synthehol-based Scotch. Data must have been unfamiliar with Aldebaran whiskey, because he described the drink by simply noting that “it is green, ” an homage by episode writer Ron Moore to Scotty’s delivery of (nearly) the same line in “By Any Other Name” (TOS). Aldebaran whiskey was available at Quark’s bar on Deep Space 9. (“Prophet Motive” [DS9]). SEE: Tomar. Aldebaran. Star system.

It was not learned until ten years later that Alixus had planned the forced landing in order to establish a society that conformed to her ideals. Alixus had selected Orellius because it was far from shipping lanes, and even went so far as to create a duonet- ic field around the colony site, to make it impossible for her fol¬ lowers to use any advanced technology. Although many of her followers seemed happy with this way of life, Alixus was responsible for several deaths because she also rejected any form of technologically-based medicine. After her colony was accidentally discovered in 2370 by Ben Sisko and Miles O’Brien, Alixus and her son, Vinod, were taken into custody for having permitted these deaths. (“Paradise” [DS9]). alizine.
