        "text": "<strong>Tuesday</strong> <strong>Morning</strong> Quarterbackhttp://www.nfl.com/features/tmq/081004Page 1 of 132/8/2005Dumbledore returns, plus cheerleaders from the future travelbackward in time to save Star Trek!By Gregg EasterbrookSpecial to <strong>NFL</strong>.com(Aug. 10, <strong>2004</strong>) -- Thank goodness it's about to end -- that long, lonely <strong>NFL</strong> offseason will conclude, andthe nutty artificial universe of pro football resumes. Not a moment too soon! All the madness, the hype,the ill-tempered gentlemen slamming into each other, the scantily attired cheer-babes. I don't knowabout you, but I can't wait.In a moment, my annual review of offseason highlights -- actually, lowlights. But first, a <strong>Tuesday</strong><strong>Morning</strong> Quarterback public-policy proposal: uniform amnesty. All <strong>NFL</strong> teams that have adopted garishnew color schemes or monochrome looks, TMQ is proclaiming an amnesty. Return to your old uniforms,and no questions asked.For my money, the Bills, Bolts, Broncos, Cowboys, Falcons, Giants, Jets, Patriots, Seahawks and Titanswent downhill with their uniform alterations; only the Bucs, Eagles and Rams look better in theirrevisionist duds than those that came before.<strong>The</strong> Cowboys: What, exactly, was wrong with preserving the look that won all those Super Bowls?<strong>The</strong> Giants: <strong>The</strong>y switched to gray as an accent color, now there's a color that really pops, and madethemselves the slowest-looking team in the league.<strong>The</strong> Seahawks: <strong>The</strong>y look like they just fell into a pot of finger paintsTennessee: <strong>The</strong> old Oiler jerseys were sleek and glistening, the new shoulder-pads-squares thing makesTitans' players appear to be sewing mannequins escaped from a couturi√®re.<strong>The</strong> Falcons: <strong>The</strong>ir unis are now so busy, the players look like walking computer screensavers.<strong>The</strong> Broncos: Sure orange and blue was weird, but it was also bold, and if it was good enough for FloydLittle, it's good enough for me.<strong>The</strong> Bills: How could a team abandon red, white and American flag blue? Which, not to put too fine apoint on it, is the single-most successful color scheme in world history.Please, <strong>NFL</strong> teams, return to your old uniforms. You can bring the new ones to the league headquartersloading dock and abandon them there. You won't have to give your names.Not only are uniforms now in constant flux -- the Bengals and Falcons seem to have new uniforms everyother year -- it is astonishing to think that with 32 <strong>NFL</strong> teams, not one uses red, white and American flagblue. Jersey/A officially calls its color scheme \"blue, red and white,\" but when I look at G-Men I see a lotof gray. Officially, the Texans' colors are \"Deep Steel Blue, Battle Red and Liberty White,\" but the latterlooks like Copy Paper White to me, and the blue is Bridge Abutment Blue.<strong>The</strong>n there is the annoying new practice of special-occasion monochrome outfits. In recent years, forindividual games the Bengals and Jax have gone all-black, the Browns and Dolphins all-orange, theFalcons all-red, the Eagles and Jets all-green, and the Bills have shown a monochrome of their dismalnew color, Nineteenth Century Rusting Russian Dreadnaught Aft Bulkhead Cyanic. <strong>The</strong> Ravensannounced they will wear all-black on Nov. 7, when they host Cleveland. If the Browns go all-orange, itwould be the Tootsie Roll Bowl.On an exclusive basis, <strong>Tuesday</strong> <strong>Morning</strong> Quarterback has learned that when the Green Bay Packers hostDallas on Oct. 24, they will take the field in the <strong>NFL</strong>'s first all-yellow uniform. See accompanying photo ofBrett Favre modeling the Pack's tradition-smashing all-yellow look. Remember, this is a TMQ exclusive.<strong>The</strong> only hope is uniform amnesty. Please, everyone go back to how you looked in 1975 -- no questionsasked!Page 1 of 355"
