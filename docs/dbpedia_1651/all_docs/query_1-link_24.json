At 1 GeV, the RCS will perform a merge of two bunches into one, adding longitudinal dynamics that effects the dynamic aperture, depending on the merge parameters.

An Energy Recovery Linac is used to deliver the high-current high-brightness electron beam for cooling. For the best cooling effect, the electron beam requires low emittance, small energy spread, and uniform longitudinal distribution. In this work, we simulate and optimize the longitudinal laser-beam distribution shaping at the photo-cathode, modeling space charge forces accurately.

Electron polarization is directly characterized by the RMS of the so-called spin orbit coupling function in the bends. In the Electron Storage Ring (ESR) of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), as was the case in HERA, this function is excited by the spin rotators. Individual vertical orbit bumps in the arcs can have varying impacts on this function globally. In this method, we use a singular value decomposition of the response matrix of the spin-orbit coupling function with each orbit bump to define a minimal number of most effective groups of bumps, motivating the name âBest Adjustment Groups for ELectron Spinâ (BAGELS) method. These groups can then be used to minimize the depolarizing effects in an ideal lattice, and to restore the minimization in rings with realistic closed orbit distortions. Furthermore, BAGELS can be used to construct groups for other applications where a minimal impact on polarization is desirable, e.g. global coupling compensation or vertical emittance creation. Application of the BAGELS method has significantly increased the polarization in simulations of the 18 GeV ESR, beyond achievable with conventional methods.\n\nM. Signorelli, G.

However, it is possible to obtain the resonance strength without computing the Fourier integral directly. If a resonance is sufficiently strong, then to a good approximation, one can neglect all other depolarizing effects when near the resonance. Such an approximation leads to the single resonance model (SRM), for which many aspects of spin motion are analytically solvable. In this paper, we calculate the strength of first-order resonances using various formulae derived from the SRM, utilizing spin tracking data, the direction of the invariant spin field, and jumps in the amplitude-dependent spin tune.

Here we describe a symplectic field approximations of both Siberian Snakes in the AGS, enabling practical long-term tracking calculations. Without such symplectic representations, particle motion destabilizes very quickly close to injection energy. This optical instability manifests in $O(10^3)$ turns, and makes dynamic aperture smaller than realistic emittances. Combined with optimization using the Bmad toolkit, we implement steering and optical corrections of the snake effects at 80 distinct energies from injection to extraction, mimicking the measured lattice conditions at each energy. This process unveils unforeseen snake distortions of the vertical dispersion near injection energy, which are addressed. By interpolating between such optimized lattice configurations, Bmad's tracking capabilities allow advanced simulation of polarization transmission through the full AGS cycle.\n\nE. Hamwi, G.

For the AGS Booster, discrepancies between the real physical system and online simulation model have been a long-standing issue. Due to the lack of a reliable model, the current practice of beam control relies mainly on empirical tuning by experienced operators, which may be inefficient or sub-optimal. In this work, we investigate two main factors that can cause discrepancies between simulation and reality in the AGS Booster: magnet misalignments and magnet transfer functions. We developed a orbit response measurement script that collects real machine data in the Booster for model calibration. By matching simulated data with real data, we can develop a more accurate simulation model for future polarization optimizations, and build the foundation for a fully functional digital-twin.\n\nW.

Such a scheme provides an efficient path towards high-energy, high-power continuous beams. This paper describes the development of a conceptual design of an FFA RLA focusing on but not limited to a high-power hadron beam case. We present a complete optics design including arc, linac, and matching sections. The matching sections are implemented following the adiabatic approach whereby matching of all beam passes occurs simultaneously within a single beam line. Harmonic correction is applied for precise orbit and optics control of the individual passes. We discuss approaches to optimization of the linac timing and control of the longitudinal beam dynamics.\n\nV. Morozov\n\nOak Ridge National Laboratory\n\nA. Bogacz, A. Seryi, B. Gamage, D.

This high luminosity, the wide center-of-mass energy range from 29 to 141 GeV (e-p) and the high level of polarization require innovative solutions to maximize the performance of the machine, which makes the EIC one of the most challenging accelerator projects to date.

Electron beam is brought back to the linac by the single beam line without requiring electric power REDUCING estimated wall power of 100 MW in the present LHeC design to a negligible power for arcs as the permanent magnets are used. The design is based on experience from the very successful commissioning of the Cornell University and Brookhaven National Laboratory Energy Recovery Test Accelerator â âCBETAâ. The proposal supports sustainability efforts for LHeC by making a 'green' accelerator. It is an energy recovery linac with 99.9% energy efficiency and reduces the power consumption by using small permanent magnets. The FFA non-linear gradient design is a racetrack shape, where, as in the CBETA, the arcs are matched by adiabatic transition to the two (LHeC) or multiple straight sections. Two 10 GeV superconducting linacs are placed on both sides of the Interaction Region (IR) significantly reducing the power of synchrotron radiation loss.\n\nD. Trbojevic, S. Brooks, J.

Electron bunches with polarizations parallel and anti-parallel to the arc dipole fields will co-circulate in the ring at the same time, and each bunch must be replaced once it is sufficiently depolarized by synchrotron radiation. In this work, we detail the unique challenges posed by designing such a collider ring to operate at different energies, and their solutions. This includes satisfying spin matching conditions, calculating optimal energies for polarization, determining best figures-of-merit, maintaining high polarization without a traditional longitudinal spin match, restoring the spin match with random closed orbit distortions, and implementing global coupling compensation and vertical emittance creation schemes that preserve high polarization. Nonlinear tracking results are presented showing polarization requirements are exceeded.\n\nM. Signorelli, G. Hoffstaetter\n\nCornell University (CLASSE)\n\nY.

The upgrade pushes the boundaries of the current CEBAF facilities and will require several state-of-the-art beamline components. The first of which is nonscaling Fixed Field Alternating (FFA) Gradient recirculation arcs, using novel Halbach-style permanent magnets. These new arcs would replace the current highest-energy recirculating arcs and allow up to six new beam passes spanning approximately a factor of two in energy. Matching into these arcs will require the design of splitter bend systems proceeding the north and south linac sections. Matching from these arcs into the proceeding linac section will be achieved using a novel transition section. Additionally, several major changes to the existing CEBAF accelerator will be implemented including a 650 MeV recirculating injector, a new multi-pass linac optics design based on a triplet focusing lattice, and a newly designed spreader/recombiner bend systems to accommodate the higher energy requirement.\n\nD.

However, for non-resonant orbital tunes, resonant depolarization by single resonance crossing is impossible in the SRM while using a pair of Siberian Snakes since the amplitude-dependent spin tune is then fixed to one-half. Polarization loss in RHIC demonstrates that the isolated resonances model is not a good approximation of polarization dynamics with two Siberian Snakes. We therefore extend the model in which a pair of resonances in close proximity push the amplitude-dependent spin tune away from one-half in the presence of Siberian Snakes, allowing the crossing of higher-order spin resonances associated with depolarization. We present results from applying Machine Learning methods that establish spin transport models with two overlapping resonances from tracking data.\n\nE. Hamwi, G. Hoffstaetter, J.

The time-averaged polarization for that run actually ended up higher than in the Yellow ring, after casting the undamaged snake as a partial snake as well. In this work, we simulate polarization transmission through a series of increasingly realistic models of the Blue ring in the âdangerous regionâ of polarization loss. At first the bare lattice has a perfect closed-orbit and ideal magnet strengths. Then the measured magnet-to-magnet field strength variations were added to the lattice. Finally, the six Interaction Region 5mm closed orbit bumps were implemented. Each of these model lattices compared the use of a pair of partial snakes against a pair of a full snakes, and in simulations with realistic emittances, realistic polarization losses were not reproducible without inclusion of nonzero RMS lattice misalignments.\n\nE.

In this work we have used long-term tracking based on the Bmad toolkit to run third integer resonant extraction simulations of beams of various ion species in the booster synchrotron at Brookhaven National Laboratory. In this paper, we will present results of detailed slow extraction, multi-particle tracking simulations, and we will describe the features that make Bmad a useful tool for this work. We will show comparisons to other simulation tools of our results.\n\nB. Dhital, K. Brown\n\nBrookhaven National Laboratory\n\nD. Sagan, E. Hamwi, G. Hoffstaetter, W.

In this device the hadrons are cooled by the electrons and the electrons are cooled through radiation damping, which is enhanced by a number of 4 meter-long wigglers with 2.4 T field. When optimizing the beam envelope, intra beam scattering and Touschek scattering are also considered. Using a field configuration with additional focusing to keep the emittance at an acceptable value, these wigglers make up a substantial portion of the ring, with the wiggler section contributing the majority of the ringâs chromaticity. In this paper, the effects of the RECâs unusual properties on dynamic aperture are analyzed and a correction scheme is proposed.\n\nJ. Unger, E. Hamwi, G.

However, a high density of first-order resonances correlates with the presence of higher-order resonances after the installation of snakes. Thus, one effective tactic of mitigating higher-order resonances is by weakening the surrounding first-order ones, equivalent to minimizing the spin-orbit coupling integrals. Such a proxy helps sidestep a multi-hour polarization transmission simulation for each lattice configuration. In a three-fold super-periodic ring, using 12 snakes is a sufficient condition for completely eliminating the spin-orbit coupling integrals at all energies and tunes. Since the HSR will only have up to 6 snakes, we opt to focus on suppressing the strongest first-order resonances instead of the whole spectrum. By varying the snake reflection axes and the betatron phase advance in two of the arcs, we search in a 7-dimensional lattice space for the weakest resonance structure using a variety of metrics and find the configuration with highest polarization transmission.\n\nE.

Intensity and emittance preservation during these gymnastics require careful setup of the voltages and phases of RF cavities operating at several different harmonic numbers. The optimum setting tends to drift over time, degrading performance and requiring operator attention to correct. We describe a reinforcement learning approach to learning and maintaining an optimum configuration, accounting for the relevant RF parameters and external perturbations (e.g., a changing main dipole field) using a physics-based simulator at Brookhaven Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS).\n\nY.

As compared to existing accelerator codes, reverse differentiability, e.g. for the optimization of neural networks, will be embedded. Multiple standalone Julia packages are being developed that provide fundamental tools and methods commonly needed in accelerator simulations, it is envisaged that Bmad-Julia will be able to serve as the basis for developing new programs to meet the ever changing simulation requirements of high energy machines. By avoiding the necessity of \"reinventing the wheel\", programs that make use of Bmad-Julia packages can be developed in less time and with fewer bugs than programs developed from scratch. Included will be a package for accelerator lattice instantiation and bookkeeping, a package for handling physical and atomic constants, and a package for truncated Power Series Algebra (TPSA) with routines for manipulations and analysis including map inversion, partial map inversion, normal form decomposition, Poisson bracket, etc. Ultimately, all features of todayâs versatile Bmad toolkit will be transferred, including polarized beams, radiation effects, beam scattering, symplectic tracking, and long-term dynamics. Discussed is the present state of the project as well as plans for the future.\n\nD. Sagan, G. Hoffstaetter, M. Signorelli\n\nCornell University (CLASSE)\n\nA.

It considers addition of six more linac passes. The highest energy passes will share two new arcs designed using the Fixed-Field Alternating Gradient (FFA) technology. The FFA arcs are built using permanent combined-function magnets. They will be connected to the linacs through transition sections that will match the optics of all six passes to the linacs. With the high number of constraints and the limited space available, we are investigating a parametric resonance technique to match the optics quasi-independently at each energy. A resonance is excited at each individual energy to selectively control its optics. The resonant dipole and quadrupole kick harmonics are imposed for all energies simultaneously using Panofsky corrector magnets placed throughout the FFA arcs. This paper presents the current progress on that transition section design.\n\nB. Gamage, A. Bogacz, A. Seryi, D. Turner, D. Khan, E. Nissen, G. Krafft, K. Price, K. Deitrick, R. Kazimi, R.
