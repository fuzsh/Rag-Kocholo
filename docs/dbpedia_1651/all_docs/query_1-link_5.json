        "text": "The newly commissioned starship Voyager and a Maquis raider are flung into the far reaches of the remote Delta Quadrant by a powerful entity known as the Caretaker. (Series premiere)\n\nSummary[]\n\nUnhappy with a new treaty, Federation Colonists along the Cardassian border have banded together.\n\nCalling themselves \"The Maquis\", they continue to fight the Cardassians.\n\nSome consider them heroes, but to the governments of the Federation and Cardassia, they are outlaws.\n\nTeaser[]\n\nWeapons fire streaks through space as a Cardassian warship attacks a much smaller Maquis raider with phasers. The latter ship's crew, led by Chakotay and also including B'Elanna Torres and Tuvok, are struggling to hold their spacecraft together and get the impulse engines' power steady, but Torres frustratedly points out the vessel has thirty-nine-year-old rebuilt engines. The Cardassian commander, Gul Evek, hails the Maquis ship, ordering them to stand down, but Chakotay defiantly shuts off the transmission. The Maquis crew then deactivate their vessel's weapon systems in order to channel enough power to the engines to reach the Badlands, with the Cardassian warship all the while in close pursuit. Whereas Chakotay's piloting skills are sufficient to avoid the plasma storms in the Badlands, the Cardassian ship is less lucky and is severely damaged. Relieved, Chakotay sets a course for a planet where they can make repairs when a bright flash erupts through the ship; the vessel has passed through a coherent tetryon beam from an unknown source and, despite beginning to move away at full impulse, the ship is intercepted by a huge displacement wave.\n\nAct One[]\n\nIn the Federation penal settlement in New Zealand on Earth, several inmates wearing ankle monitors are performing labor. One man's work is interrupted when a woman in a Starfleet uniform approaches him and asks, \"Tom Paris?\" The man glances up at her and she introduces herself as Kathryn Janeway. She states that she served with his father on the USS Al-Batani and that she would like to speak with him about a job she wants him to do. He sarcastically replies that he is already doing a job for the Federation, but Janeway says that the Rehab Commission is very pleased with his work and has given her permission to discuss the matter with him. He replies, \"Well, then I guess I'm yours.\"\n\nAs they walk together, Janeway informs Paris that she was his father's science officer on the Arias Expedition. Paris comments that she must be good, as his father only accepts the best and brightest. Janeway tells him that her mission is to track down a Maquis vessel that vanished in the Badlands a week previous. Paris advises against it, having never seen a Federation starship that could maneuver through the plasma storms; Janeway retorts by saying that he has never seen the USS Voyager.\n\nParis infers that Janeway's motive is to have him lead the Federation to his former Maquis colleagues. Paris reminds Janeway that because he was only with them a few weeks before being captured, so he didn't know many of their hiding places. Janeway replies that he knows the territory better than anyone in the Federation. When Paris asks why this specific Maquis ship is so important, Janeway tells him that her chief of security was on board the ship undercover and had not reported in for some time. Paris muses that perhaps it was only the chief of security that disappeared. Janeway reveals that the ship was under the command of Chakotay, a another former Starfleet officer.\n\nParis acknowledges that he knew Chakotay and that the two never got along. Paris says that the point of disagreement was that Chakotay left Starfleet \"on principle,\" to defend his home colony, but he considered Paris a mercenary who joined \"whoever would pay [his] bar bills,\" an accusation to which he admits. Paris concludes that he will help track down the Maquis, but asks what he has to gain from the venture. Janeway says that the Federation will help him at his next parole review. Janeway informs him that officially, he'd be a Starfleet observer, to which Paris replies that he's the best pilot Janeway could have. Janeway is firm about Paris' role and once the mission is over, he'll be 'cut loose', causing Paris to agree with the rejoinder, \"Story of my life.\"\n\nTom Paris arrives to Voyager, docked at Deep Space 9, via a shuttle, piloted by a Betazoid female pilot, Lieutenant Stadi. Now clad in a fresh Starfleet uniform, Paris walks up to her. Stadi focuses on flying the craft, but she livens up to Paris a little as he turns on the charm. He says that Stadi is changing his mind about Betazoids, because he always thought that they were warm and sensual. Stadi says that she can be warm and sensual, but Paris replies that she can, but just not to him. The conversation shifts as a sleek vessel comes into view at one of DS9's docking pylons. Stadi proudly identifies it as their ship, the Voyager. She states that the ship is of the Intrepid-class, has a new variable warp nacelle configuration, giving it a sustainable cruising speed of warp 9.975; it has fifteen decks and a crew complement of 141. It is also equipped with bio-neural circuitry. Paris inquires as to the circuitry, and as she flies around Voyager towards the shuttlebay, she informs Paris that the bio-neural circuitry speeds up response time in the ship's computer.\n\nMeanwhile, on board Deep Space 9, Quark is trying to sell bright, rare crystals to a young Starfleet ensign seated in his bar. He tries to politely tell Quark he is not interested and says cadets were warned about Ferengi at the Academy. Upon hearing this, Quark feigns being upset that the Federation is spreading lies about the Ferengi and that he will make a formal protest to the Federation Council. Quark asks for the young ensign's name for the report, to which he replies, \"Kim, Harry Kim.\" Kim backs downs and offers to buy the whole tray of crystals in an effort to smooth things over. As Quark brings over the crystals and begins to negotiate, Paris interrupts and tells Ensign Kim that the crystals Quark is trying to sell him can be found on virtually any planet in the system and can be bought for little or nothing. Now knowing that Quark was trying to rip him off, Ensign Kim leaves with Tom Paris who says, \"Didn't they warn you about Ferengi at the Academy?\"\n\nParis and Kim enter sickbay aboard Voyager and report to the chief medical officer. When Paris identifies himself, the doctor comments, \"Ah, yes. The observer.\" When Paris comments that he seems to be observing some kind of problem now, the doctor says that he was a surgeon on Caldik Prime when Paris was stationed there, though they never met. He says Paris' medical records from his previous posting have arrived and that the captain had asked if he were on board, saying that he should check in with her. Kim, sensing a tense situation, says that he hasn't yet paid his respects to the captain, either. The doctor says that perhaps it would be a good thing for a new operations officer to do. After they leave sickbay, Kim asks Paris what the story is between him and the CMO. Paris responds that he's gotten tired of telling it and that he's sure someone will be happy to tell him.\n\nMeanwhile, Captain Janeway is in her ready room talking to her fiancé, Mark Johnson, on her desktop monitor about her dog, who turns out to be pregnant. Janeway insists that the dog stays with him, leading him to reply, \"Is this another 'love me, love my dog' demand?\", to which Janeway quickly replies, \"Yes.\" Janeway says they will be leaving as soon as she approves the system status reports. Johnson says he won't bother her anymore, leading Janeway to get on her knees in front of the terminal and says, \"You never bother me, except the way I love to be bothered. Understand?\" Saying that she'll see him in a few weeks, Janeway quickly asks Johnson to pick up her dog's doggie bed, which Johnson then says he already did – an hour ago.\n\nAfter the connection closes, the door chimes. Paris and Kim enter. Janeway welcomes them aboard Voyager, to which Kim replies with a stiff, \"Thank you, sir,\" standing at full attention, causing Paris to look at him curiously. Telling the nervous ensign to stand \"at ease, before you sprain something,\" she lets him know that protocol aside, she doesn't like being addressed as \"sir,\" to which Kim responds, \"I'm sorry… ma'am.\" Janeway smiles and says that ma'am is acceptable in a crunch, but that she prefers \"captain.\" She tells them they are getting ready to leave and she shows them to the bridge. Walking out onto the bridge, she introduces them to her first officer, Lieutenant Commander Cavit, who exchanges a hearty handshake with Kim and one with Paris reluctantly and only after Paris extends his hand first. Janeway shows Kim to the operations station and asks if he would like to take over. Kim responds, \"Yes, ma'am,\" to which she replies, \"It's not crunch time yet, Mr. Kim. I'll let you know when.\"\n\nAt a nod from Janeway, the first officer instructs Lt. Stadi to lay in their course and clear departure with Operations. After Stadi confirms this, they complete the pre-launch sequence and prepare for launch, which Janeway orders with \"Engage.\" The dorsal light of the ship comes on, illuminating the ship's registration, and the ship departs.\n\nAct Two[]\n\nWith the ship under way, Paris heads down to the mess hall for some hot tomato soup. As he is ordering the soup from the replicator, he notices that Voyager's chief medical officer and Commander Cavit are looking at him with judgmental eyes, while talking to Kim at a nearby table. As Paris makes his way over to Kim's table, Cavit and the CMO make a hasty departure. When Paris finally sits down, he says to Kim, \"There. You see, I told you it wouldn't take long.\" Paris then begins to tell Kim that it was true that he caused an accident which led to the deaths of three Starfleet officers and that he falsified reports. What led him to turn himself in and tell the truth despite the fact that he would have gotten away with it otherwise, Paris sarcastically remarks that it took \"the three dead officers to come in the middle of the night and (teach) me the true meaning of Christmas.\". Paris therefore confessed everything, and was promptly discharged from service… upon which, looking for a fight, he joined the Maquis and was arrested during his very first assignment for them. Paris gets up to leave and says that he knows that Cavit and the CMO told him to stay away from him and that he should listen to them. As Paris walks away, Kim replies \"I don't need anyone to choose my friends for me.\" As a curious Paris regards Kim following this statement, Captain Janeway summons them both to the bridge to inform them that the ship has reached the Badlands.\n\nVoyager enters the volatile region. Janeway, Cavit, and Ensign Rollins are crowded around the tactical station trying to ascertain where the Maquis ship would be. With some assistance from Paris, the ship begins to head in. Shortly after, Ensign Kim's sensors read that a coherent tetryon beam is scanning the ship. Janeway asks Kim if he can identify the source of the beam, but he cannot. The sensors then find out that a displacement wave is quickly moving towards the ship. Cavit suggests that they may be able to disperse the wave with a graviton particle field. Janeway orders that it be done. It is later found that the field had no effect on the wave. Janeway orders Stadi to move the ship away from the wave at full impulse. However, the ship is unable to outrun it and the wave collides with Voyager.\n\nAfter the ship has been released from the wave, it has suffered heavy damage. Janeway comes to and checks Cavit's pulse, only to find that he is dead. Stadi also did not survive after Paris checks Stadi's pulse. Janeway asks where they are. Kim gets the viewscreen working, but the Badlands are gone – there's only empty space and an enormous array. Kim replies that if his sensors are working perfectly, they are over 70,000 light years from the Badlands… Voyager has been transported to the Delta Quadrant, the other side of the galaxy.\n\nAct Three[]\n\nAs the crew begins to make repairs, Voyager finds the Maquis ship, but scans show that there is nobody aboard it and attempts to hail the array are unsuccessful. Just then, engineering contacts the bridge and informs Janeway that the chief engineer was also killed and that the ship is facing a possible warp core breach. Janeway heads down to engineering to help and orders Kim to see what the situation is in sickbay leaving Rollins to assume command of the bridge. Paris heads down with Kim as well. Adding to the list of casualties, Paris sees that the CMO and the entire medical staff were killed. Janeway makes it to engineering and finds out that there is a microfracture in the warp core and that a breach is imminent. In order to save the ship, Janeway orders the lock down of the magnetic constrictor and Lieutenant Joe Carey warns Janeway that they may not be able to initialize the dilithium reaction and that it would make warp drive impossible. Janeway sees that there are not many other alternatives and orders that it be done nevertheless. At the same time, Harry Kim orders the computer to activate Voyager's Emergency Medical Hologram, a holographic doctor designed as a supplement to the medical staff. The EMH appears, giving his default statement: \"Please state the nature of the medical emergency.\" Kim replies that the ship's doctor is dead and that the hologram is the only medical officer on board the ship since the entire medical staff was killed too. The Doctor informs Kim and Paris that, as he is only intended to be used on a short-term basis, a replacement will be needed as soon as possible. Paris then informs the EMH that he will be stuck with them for a while. The EMH then begins treating crewmembers, showing himself to be very efficient but also very brusque and lacking any kind of bedside manner.\n\nMeanwhile, down in engineering, the warp core breach appears to have been averted. Janeway then orders that the magnetic constrictor be engaged. The pressure begins to stabilize. Just then, the ship is being scanned and people begin to disappear. Eventually, everyone disappears with the exception of the Doctor. Strangely enough, the crew finds themselves on a farm, with wheat and cattle. Soon after, a middle aged woman emerges from the farmhouse named \"Aunt Adah\" and asks the crew to come up to the house for some lemonade and sugar cookies. Janeway says that the crew shouldn't be fooled, since they have only been transported a hundred kilometers from Voyager and that they are actually inside the array with Ensign Kim confirming that everything around them are holograms. The crew is greeted by holographic projections of lively southerners, including a man playing a banjo, who encourage them to make themselves at home.\n\nAct Four[]\n\nJaneway orders that Kim and Paris find the holographic projector. As Kim scans with his tricorder, he finds strange readings coming from a barn.\n\nA holographic projection of an attractive southern girl tries to pull Kim and Paris away from the barn, but is unsuccessful. Kim finds Vulcan and Human bio-signs in an unknown location. The southerners get a lot less friendly and start to attack Kim and Paris due to their curiosity. Janeway gets Kim's signal from his combadge and takes the crew she has with her to the barn. They arrive, to find Paris and Kim being threatened with a pitchfork by Aunt Adah. She says that she hoped the crew would do things the easy way but she sees that that will not work. A giant door opens to reveal the missing Maquis crew, all unconscious and restrained. The Voyager crew are soon subjected to the same painful genetic tests.\n\nThree days later the Voyager crew is returned to their ship, as well as with the Maquis on the Val Jean. When Tom Paris emerges in sickbay (with the Doctor, having been left alone for the last three days, demanding to know what happened) after being returned, he notices that Harry Kim did not return with them. Janeway calls up the computer to search for Kim, but it confirms he is not on board and is the only crewmember missing. Janeway asks Rollins to hail the Val Jean to see if Kim was accidentally transported there, but Chakotay says that he was not and that they also are missing a crewman of their own, their engineer B'Elanna Torres. Janeway asks that Chakotay beam aboard Voyager so they can discuss what to do. Chakotay turns to Tuvok and agrees. Moments later, Chakotay, Tuvok, and Maquis security guard Ayala beam on board. Janeway then reveals that Tuvok is a Federation undercover operative, and Tuvok confirms that his mission was to gain intelligence on Maquis activity before delivering the crew of the Val Jean to Starfleet. Chakotay is at once angry about this, but then he sees that Tom Paris is on the bridge. After remarking that, while Tuvok was doing his duty as a Starfleet officer, Paris only does things that benefit himself, he is ready to attack him, but Janeway asks him to treat Paris as he would with any other member of her crew. Though reluctant to do so, Chakotay agrees with her. Tuvok explains that he believes there is only a single lifeform on the array, and the testing they all went through was an examination. Janeway decides to lead a team over to the array in order to retrieve their missing people and be returned to the Alpha Quadrant. Paris requests to join the away team, promising Janeway that it has nothing to do with Chakotay; rather he doesn't want to see anything bad happen to Kim\n\nJaneway, along with Chakotay and Paris return to the so called farm (this time armed with phaser rifles) and demand answers about their missing crewmen who are no longer on the array. The only person there is the old man playing the banjo. The man says that Janeway and the rest of the crew don't have what he needs, but Janeway isn't the least concerned about this but wants the missing officers returned and for both crews to be returned to the Alpha Quadrant. The man refuses to tell her what he's done with the crew, and although he understands why they're angry and sympathizes, he tells them that Kim and Torres might have what he needs, as he must \"honor a debt that can never be repaid\" but his search has not been going well. Janeway then offers to help, but the old man tells her she can't, and that there's not enough time left before he suddenly returns everyone to Voyager.\n\nKim and Torres awaken in what appears to be a hospital room and notice growths on their arms and neck. Torres tries to escape, but two doctors come in and sedate her.\n\nThe crew determines that the energy pulses that the array is firing towards the fifth planet of a nearby system might have been used to transport Kim and Torres there so they set a course. Tuvok later reports to Janeway in her ready room that the pulses emitted from the ray have been steadily getting faster. Meanwhile, Janeway has been studying the planet where the Array's pulses are being sent: while it meets all the other requirements of an M Class planet there are no nucleogenic particles in the atmosphere, meaning it is incapable of producing rain and has left the planet as a desert. Tuvok tells Janeway that she needs rest, as she recalls that Harry Kim's mother contacted her after he'd left Earth since he'd forgotten his clarinet and wanted to know if she had time to send it, Harry having been a member of the Juilliard Youth Symphony. After noting that she barely knew the young ensign, just as she barely knows any of her crew and that she really should take the time to, Janeway promises she'll get Kim and Torres back and get everyone home. Tuvok points out that the crew needs a captain that is not exhausted, and Janeway thanks him telling him that she's missed his counsel. She tells him that his family miss him, and tells her friend that she'll get him back to them.\n\nAct Five[]\n\nWhile on the way to the fifth planet in the system where the energy pulses are being sent, Voyager encounters a small cargo ship inside a debris field, commanded by a Talaxian named Neelix. At first, Neelix thinks that Voyager might be wanting to take a piece of the debris field, but Captain Janeway assures him that they will do nothing of the sort, upon which the Talaxian's demeanor noticeably and immediately improves. Janeway then asks if he knows where the missing officers of Voyager and the Val Jean might have gone. Neelix suspects that they may have been taken to the Ocampan homeworld, to a city located deep beneath the planet's surface. Neelix offers to guide Voyager to the planet in exchange for water and Janeway agrees. Neelix is beamed aboard (marveling at the technology, which is new to him); Tuvok greets him and is embraced by the irrepressible Talaxian.\n\nTorres and Kim awaken once more and are greeted by an Ocampan doctor who tells them that they were sent here to protect their own people from their \"illness\". He takes them to the food dispensers, which are provided by the Caretaker, who built their entire underground construct when the surface of their planet turned into a desert. He also reveals that, unfortunately, other aliens with this \"disease\" that were brought to the Ocampa did not survive.\n\nAct Six[]\n\nVoyager finally makes its way to the planet. Upon arriving, Tuvok is sent to fetch Neelix from his quarters, where he finds the Talaxian has helped himself to a mountain of food from the replicator and is noisily enjoying a bath. After welcoming 'Mr. Vulcan', Neelix prepares to head down to the planet and suggests where they might begin looking for Kim and Torres as well as recommending bringing water for barter. He then asks if the replicator makes clothes, and Tuvok replies yes… but then makes a point, when asked, of telling Neelix that it will not make him a Starfleet uniform. Janeway, Paris, Chakotay, Neelix, and Tuvok beam down and are immediately captured by a group of Kazon-Ogla, a rogue faction in the Delta Quadrant.\n\nFor some assistance and since the Kazon desperately need water, Janeway arranges for huge canisters of water to be beamed down in exchange for some answers. She asks where those Ocampa might be, and the Kazon leader, Jabin points to a battered Ocampan woman and says, \"she is an Ocampa.\" As Jabin continues, he explains that the array is used by the Caretaker who provides the Ocampa with everything they need. Jabin has been torturing Kes to find a way into the Ocampan underground complex, but she does not give an answer. Around this time Neelix tries to barter with Jabin for the release of Kes in exchange for the water as well. Jabin refuses and Neelix grabs him and warns the surrounding Kazon to drop their weapons or he will kill him. The rest of the crew gets their weapons back and shoot at the enormous water containers. With the Kazon distracted with the water spilling out onto the ground quickly, Janeway contacts Voyager to beam them up. Soon after, the crew realizes that Neelix and Kes are lovers.\n\nMeanwhile, Torres and Kim are still being held against their will by the Ocampa. They try to devise a way out when a young Ocampa nurse comes up to them and tells them about secret passageways to the surface. But, she says that there are meters of solid rock to get through and even with the proper tools, it may take days or even weeks to get through. Ever determined, Kim and Torres ask for her help.\n\nWhile Kes is being tended to by The Doctor, Janeway asks if there is any way to get to their crew members. Kes replies that she escaped through a tunnel underground, but now, the passageway she came out of is sealed by solid rock and they won't be able to get through. Janeway assures they will be able to with their transporter technology. Kes then says that there are breaches in the tunnels which will help them get through. They beam to the surface where Kes reunites with her people, who are telepathic, but she defies them by helping the crew rescue their friends.\n\nAct Seven[]\n\nKim and Torres manage to escape, meanwhile the pulses from the array stop and the array re-positions itself and begins firing weapons at the surface in order to seal the conduits leading down to the facility. This action allows Tuvok to come to a conclusion for what is going on… the Caretaker is dying. Asked to explain his reasoning, Tuvok explains that the fact the Caretaker has given the Ocampa enough energy to last for five years before sealing the conduits means he will no longer be continuing as Caretaker. Chakotay suggests that he may not be dying but just leaving, however Tuvok counters this by explaining that it's doubtful the Caretaker would just leave after providing for the Ocampa for a thousand years… the \"debt that can never be repaid\" is likely a debt to them. Also his references to \"not enough time\" indicate that he knows he is going to die. Janeway realizes that if the Caretaker dies, the crew may be stranded in the Delta Quadrant. The crew decide they need to find Torres and Kim and splits up.\n\nSoon after, Tom Paris, Neelix and Kes find Kim and Torres. They go to the passageway to the surface, and eventually get past the barrier. Kes, Kim, and Torres beam to Voyager; Paris and Neelix remain behind to help the others. They find them, but Chakotay, who had broken a leg, nearly dies when the metal staircase he is on breaks apart. Paris goes back for him and saves his life, thus proving Paris' loyalty. Later, the crew is all beamed aboard and Janeway sets a course back to the array.\n\nAct Eight[]\n\nAs the Kazon arrive at the array intending to take control, Janeway (who allows Paris to take the helm) and Tuvok beam over and come to realize the old man playing the banjo is, in fact, the Caretaker. The Caretaker explains that he can't send the crew home as he barely has the strength to complete his work – sealing the conduits before he dies. He knows that he has to in order to stop the Kazon from stealing the Ocampa's water and killing them. However, the Caretaker regretfully states that in a few years it won't matter as when the energy runs out the Ocampa will be forced to surface where they'll die anyway. Janeway realizes that something the Caretaker did turned the planet into a desert and that is the debt that can never be repaid. The Caretaker explains that his species were explorers from another galaxy, however their technology damaged Ocampa's atmosphere. In order to right this wrong, the Caretaker remained behind with a female counterpart, who abandoned her post in order to explore the galaxy. Before his death, he wanted to find someone who could take over from him. To that end, he has been abducting ships from across the galaxy in order to find someone he could procreate with, so the Ocampa would be taken care of. Janeway reassures him that, as explorers too, they've met species who have managed to overcome all kinds of adversity without a Caretaker; the Ocampa will manage to somehow survive without him. The Caretaker reveals that, in order to stop the Kazon from taking the array, he has activated a self-destruct program despite the fact this will leave the crew stranded in the Delta Quadrant.\n\nMeanwhile, the battle between the Kazon and the two Alpha Quadrant ships intensifies. Eventually, in order to take some of the pressure off Voyager, Chakotay transports his crew to the Starfleet vessel. He then pilots the Val Jean to ram into the main Kazon ship just before transporting to Voyager himself, destroying the fighter and sending the Kazon crashing into the array, damaging it.\n\nInside the array, the holographic simulation fails revealing the array's true layout. The Caretaker, now in his natural form, tells Janeway that the self-destruct system was damaged so now the array won't be destroyed. The Caretaker then finally dies, leaving behind a small crystalline form, and as he dies he says that if Kazon control the array, they will annihilate the Ocampa.\n\nTuvok asks Janeway if he should activate the program to return them to the Alpha Quadrant. She asks him what will become of the Ocampa once they have gone. Tuvok reminds her that any action taken to protect the Ocampa would affect the balance of power in this region of space; they would have to comply with the Prime Directive. But Janeway questions this because, regardless of whether they chose to become involved in the affairs of the Ocampa or the Kazon, they are involved nonetheless. She and Tuvok beam back to Voyager where they discover that a Kazon fleet has arrived at the array. Janeway tells Tuvok to prepare tricobalt devices to destroy the array. B'Elanna Torres loudly argues that they will never be able to get home, but Chakotay bluntly overrules her, stating Janeway is the Captain. Janeway then orders Tuvok to fire and the tricobalt devices destroy the array, leaving no debris. After this, Jabin contacts Voyager and tells them that they have made an enemy this day. The Kazon ships withdraw.\n\nParis is later summoned to Janeway's ready room, where she tells him that due to the circumstances she's asked the Maquis to join the crew given their own ship is destroyed. She has also asked Chakotay, given that he was previously in Starfleet, to be her first officer and ensures Paris doesn't have a problem with that, especially since he'll have to report to him given the fact he is being made conn officer permanently. Paris is surprised and grateful as Janeway gives him a field commission of Lieutenant, but she is sorry that his father doesn't know. Paris promises he'll find out when the ship gets home. Neelix and Kes then enter and ask Janeway if they can join the crew. After saying that Voyager is not a passenger ship, Neelix convinces Janeway that he will be able to be a guide for the crew through the Delta Quadrant. Kes assures Janeway that they want to be a part of the crew's journey back to Earth. Janeway agrees.\n\nAfter bringing the two crews together on the bridge (the Maquis now wearing Starfleet uniforms), Janeway tells the assembled officers that, as Voyager is the only Federation ship in the Delta Quadrant, they will carry forward Starfleet's mandate of exploring new worlds and meeting new species and she also informs that both crews are going to work together in order to survive as she and Chakotay have agreed that this will be one Starfleet crew. However, she maintains that, even though the return trip would take 75 years at maximum speeds, Voyager's primary mission is to return to Federation space. They hopefully will find anomalies, wormholes, spatial rifts or new technologies that will shorten their journey back home to the Alpha Quadrant. With that in place, Captain Janeway orders Lieutenant Paris to \"set a course… for home.\" Thus, Voyager's 75-year journey back home to the Alpha Quadrant begins.\n\nLog entries[]\n\n\"Captain's log, stardate 48315.6.

I have to, um… I have to take more time to do that. It's a fine crew, and I've gotta get them home.\"\n\n- Janeway to Tuvok, regarding Voyager's crew\n\n\"Are they well?\"\n\n\"Well, but worried about you.\"\n\n\"That would not be an accurate perception, Captain. Vulcans do not worry.\"\n\n\"They… miss you.\"\n\n\"As I do them.\"\n\n- Tuvok and Janeway, concerning the former's family\n\n\"Since you're not interested in my debris, well… I'm delighted to know you!\"\n\n- Neelix\n\n\"A very impressive title!

You Federations are obviously an advanced culture.\"\n\n\"The Federation is made up of many cultures. I am Vulcan.\"\n\n\"Neelix. Good to meet you!\"\n\n- Neelix and Tuvok, as the former arrives aboard Voyager and embraces the latter in a bear hug\n\n\"Interesting… What… what exactly… (He chuckles) What exactly does all this… all this do?\"\n\n\"I assure you that everything in this room has a specific function. However, it would take several hours to explain it all. I suggest we proceed to your quarters. (Pause) Perhaps you would care for a bath.\"\n\n\"A what?\"\n\n- Tuvok and Neelix, when Neelix first boards Voyager\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Ah, Mister Vulcan. Come in, come in, please.\"\n\n- Tuvok and Neelix, while the latter enjoys a bath\n\n\"Do these, uh, replicators make clothing as well?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Will it make me a uniform like yours?\"\n\n\"No. It most certainly will not.\"\n\n- Neelix and Tuvok\n\n\"The Kazon-Ogla? Who are the Kazon-Ogla?!\"\n\n- Janeway, upon first hearing about the Kazon\n\n\"I must speak with your maje, the ever-wise Jabin.\"\n\n- Neelix, asking the Kazon subordinates to speak with their leader\n\n\"Dearest, didn't I promise to save you?\"\n\n- Neelix asking a rhetorical question of Kes, revealing that they are lovers\n\n\"If I save your butt, your life belongs to me. Isn't that some kind of Indian custom?\"\n\n\"Wrong tribe.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you. You'd rather die than let me be the one to rescue you?\"\n\n\"Fine, be a fool. If I have to die, at least I'll get the pleasure of watching you go with me.\"\n\n\"Isn't there some Indian trick where you can turn yourself into a bird and fly us out of here?\"\n\n\"You're too heavy.\"\n\n- Paris and Chakotay\n\n\"Is the crew always this difficult?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Doc. It's my first mission.\"\n\n- The Doctor and Kim\n\n\"Doesn't anyone know how to turn off the program when they leave?\"\n\n- The Doctor\n\n\"Well… you're nothing if not persistent.\"\n\n- The Caretaker to Janeway, laughing and seeing she has come aboard his array for the third time\n\n\"We're explorers from another galaxy, but we had no idea that our technology would be so destructive to their atmosphere. Two of us were chosen to stay behind and care for them.\"\n\n\"There's another like you here?\"\n\n\"Not anymore. No, no. She… she went off to look for more interesting places.\"\n\n- The Caretaker and Janeway, discussing the second Caretaker and the duty of caring for the Ocampa\n\n\"Did you ever consider allowing the Ocampa to care for themselves?\"\n\n\"Oh, they're children!\"\n\n\"Children have to grow up.\"\n\n- Janeway and The Caretaker\n\n\"Tell one of your cracker-jack Starfleet transporter chiefs to keep a lock on me.\"\n\n- Chakotay\n\n\"Stand by to transport!\"\n\n\"Wait! Now!!\"\n\n- Paris and Chakotay, arranging the latter's rescue from his Maquis raider in the nick of time\n\n\"Now, this installation will not be destroyed. But it must be. The Kazon must not be allowed to gain control of it. They will annihilate the Ocampa.\"\n\n- The Caretaker's final words\n\n\"Captain, any action we take to protect the Ocampa would affect the balance of power in this system. The Prime Directive would seem to apply.\"\n\n\"Would it? We never asked to be involved, Tuvok. But we are. We are.\"\n\n- Tuvok and Janeway\n\n\"We'll have to find another way home.\"\n\n- Janeway to Torres, deciding to destroy the Caretaker's array, Voyager's only then-evident way home\n\n\"Who is she to be making these decisions for all of us?\"\n\n\"She's the captain.\"\n\n- Torres and Chakotay\n\n\"You have made an enemy today.\"\n\n- Jabin's only words to Captain Janeway when he contacts Voyager for the last time\n\n\"I've entered into the ship's log, on this date, that I'm granting a field commission of lieutenant to Thomas Eugene Paris. Congratulations.\"\n\n- Kathryn Janeway, making Tom Paris an officer again\n\n\"Whatever you need is what I have to offer. You need a guide? I'm your guide. You need supplies? I know where to procure them. I have friends among races you don't even know exist. You need a cook? Oh, you haven't lived until you've tasted my angla'bosque. It will be my job to anticipate your needs before you know you have them. And I anticipate your first need… will be me.\"\n\n\"Captain, we both want very much to be a part of your journey.\"\n\n- Neelix's and Kes' pitch to Captain Janeway\n\n\"We're alone, in an uncharted part of the galaxy. We've already made some friends here, and some enemies. We have no idea of the dangers we're going to face, but one thing is clear. Both crews are going to have to work together if we're to survive. That's why Commander Chakotay and I have agreed that this should be one crew: a Starfleet crew. And as the only Starfleet vessel assigned to the Delta Quadrant, we'll continue to follow our directive to seek out new worlds and explore space. But our primary goal is clear. Even at maximum speeds, it would take seventy-five years to reach the Federation, but I'm not willing to settle for that. There's another entity like the Caretaker out there somewhere, who has the ability to get us there a lot faster. We'll be looking for her, and we'll be looking for wormholes, spatial rifts, or new technologies to help us. Somewhere, along this journey, we'll find a way back. Mister Paris, set a course… for home.\"\n\n- Captain Kathryn Janeway's speech during their journey through the Delta Quadrant\n\nBackground information[]\n\nWriting the pilot[]\n\nStory[]\n\nBrannon Braga missed the chance to be involved in the writing of this episode; he was on vacation at the time. (The Official Star Trek: Voyager Magazine issue 5, p. 45)\n\nThis pilot episode was a result of development lunches between Executive Producers Rick Berman, Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor about Star Trek: Voyager. (\"Braving the Unknown: Season 1\", VOY Season 1 DVD special features) Noted Piller, \"Rick, Jeri and I ate lots of cheap lunches over several weeks to hammer out the plot.\" (The Official Star Trek: Voyager Magazine issue 4, p. 10) The writing process – actually first concerning development of the series' concept and characters – began in July 1993. The team routinely met at noon, four days a week or so, and each of their discussions was for two or three hours. The meetings continued through July, August and September 1993. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 155 & 157-158)\n\nThe galaxy-crossing leap which the USS Voyager and its crew make in this outing was inspired by certain installments of Star Trek: The Next Generation. \"We remembered the episodes, many episodes,\" Michael Piller said, with a laugh, \"where Q would show up and throw one of our ships or one of our people off to some strange part of the universe. And we'd have to figure out why we were there, how we were going to get back, and ultimately – by the end of an episode – we'd get back home. But as we had one of those lunches – the three of us, Jeri [Taylor], Rick [Berman] and I – we started to talk about what would happen if… we didn't get home. That appealed to us a great deal.\" (\"Braving the Unknown: Season 1\", VOY Season 1 DVD special features) The idea also came about as an effort to make the new series extremely different from its predecessors. \"That led to the thought about the ship, in the pilot episode, of being tossed into the netherworld, into another quadrant,\" recalled Berman. (Star Trek Magazine issue 179, p. 25) Taylor remembered, \"We decided, in a very calculated way, to cut our ties with everything that was familiar.\" (\"Braving the Unknown: Season 1\", VOY Season 1 DVD special features)\n\nHowever, establishing the journey herein obviously wasn't the only initial goal of this outing. \"We had a lot to accomplish,\" stated Rick Berman. \"We had to introduce a whole cast of characters, and get these people over to the other side of the galaxy […] I had a lot to do with the conception of it.\" (Star Trek Magazine issue 179, p. 27) One of Michael Piller's contributions was to suggest that the characters in this pilot were \"really neat,\" and he made it his goal to ensure that they would be. (OMNI, Vol. 17, No. 5) \"I think we learned from our mistakes on Deep Space Nine and, to a lesser extent, on Next Generation,\" he reflected, \"that we needed to immediately find these people as individuals and as a crew.\" (Captains' Logs Supplemental - The Unauthorized Guide to the New Trek Voyages, p. 124)\n\nIndeed, the development of this episode was highly influenced by the single most recent Star Trek series to have been created. \"The thing about 'Caretaker' that must be remembered in all discussions,\" said Michael Piller, \"is that it was created in the shadow of ST:DS9.\" (Star Trek Magazine issue 119, p. 79)\n\nThe conception of this installment took cues, for example, from the DS9 pilot episode \"Emissary\", which Michael Piller had been involved in writing. Whereas \"Emissary\" concentrates on cerebral matters to a relatively high degree, a primary goal in the writing of this episode was to make it action-packed. Piller stated, \"When we started the pilot, I felt that after all the psychological stuff we had done on Deep Space Nine, we could let loose and have a wild ride and adventure with this. My push on the pilot was to let it all hang out in a real old-fashioned adventure story.\" (Captains' Logs Supplemental - The Unauthorized Guide to the New Trek Voyages, p. 126) Piller believed the audience was ready for a pilot episode which highlighted action-adventure. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 235) He admitted, \"As an audience member, I was ready for a real rock-'em, sock-'em adventure and I really wanted to […] spend all the studio's money in creating a really neat adventure.\" (Captains' Logs Supplemental - The Unauthorized Guide to the New Trek Voyages, p. 134) Thus, Piller also felt, as a writer, that it was time he tried to write a fun, action-based \"yarn\". (The Official Star Trek: Voyager Magazine issue 4, p. 11) The other executive producers agreed to this strategy. Jeri Taylor remembered, \"We had really made the choice to make this an action-adventure kind of romp.\" (Cinefantastique, Vol. 27, No. 4/5, p. 35) Ultimately, Piller was of the opinion that \"our ambitions were a little less lofty,\" in contrast to the ambitions which had motivated the writing of \"Emissary\". (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 235 & 236)\n\nWhile working on this episode's story, Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor followed a method of hammering out the plot whereby, repeatedly, they brainstormed ideas, Taylor took notes, and Piller typed up digests of the progress they made each day. (Cinefantastique, Vol. 27, No. 4/5, p. 62) Taylor kept taking notes as Piller transcribed the evolving story to computer, and both would routinely review their notes during the next session with the group. (Star Trek Monthly issue 4, p. 54) \"It was just a process of adding and embellishing and then going back and changing,\" clarified Taylor. \"It was a collaborative process that took quite a while.\" (Cinefantastique, Vol. 27, No. 4/5, p. 62) The process, in fact, seemed endless. It entailed many weeks of thinking, discussing, devising ideas, discarding them, going back to square one and repeating the entire process again. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 174)\n\nBy the end of July 1993, some story and character elements were beginning to emerge from the regular conversations, such as the notion of having a split crew – some Starfleet and some rebels, the latter of whom were commonly referred to by the team of executive producers, at this early stage of development, as \"misfits\". (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 174-175) After the executive producing trio struck upon this split-crew concept, they had the idea of having the crews join forces to embark, as explorers, on the long journey home. (The Official Star Trek: Voyager Magazine issue 1, p. 12)\n\nSome of the earliest concepts that eventually ended up in this episode were included in a list of handwritten notes which was written by Jeri Taylor and dated 30 July 1993. The notes stated, \"We get zapped to the ends of the galaxy – it will take 10 years to get home. We explore on the way. The misfits are stuck with us.\" (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 175)\n\nThe executive producers subsequently thought up the concept of the Starfleet crew initially hurrying after the group of renegades, a notion that was inspired by the series co-creators asking themselves what they believed might make an interesting Star Trek crew. \"The answer for us was to find ourselves chasing an outlaw group,\" reflected Piller. \"We all get tossed onto the other side of the universe and everybody has to team up […] That seemed to be an interesting dynamic that would give us plenty of story material.\" (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 200)\n\nThere was a great deal of discussion and controversy as to whether the renegades should be given Starfleet uniforms. (Cinefantastique, Vol. 27, No. 4/5, p. 76) Ronald D. Moore recalled, \"The initial idea for Voyager was that the Maquis who joined the crew would not put on the Starfleet uniforms.\" Michael Piller was a strong proponent of this idea. (Star Trek: The Next Generation 365, p. 352) However, Rick Berman believed the Maquis needed to wear Starfleet uniforms. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 200) Noted Moore, \"Michael lost that fight.\" (Star Trek: The Next Generation 365, p. 352) With hindsight, Berman explained, \"We wanted to get the Maquis into Starfleet uniforms, with a captain who had to pull together diverse groups of people into a functioning, solid, effective unit.\" The actual reason the rebels were incorporated into the Starfleet crew, by the end of the episode, was that Berman felt having tension between the two groups in every installment of the subsequent series \"would get pretty irritating, and cumbersome.\" (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 181, 198 & 202) The fact this episode was preceded by the creation of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine also had an impact on this outcome, as DS9 had been considered a failure as far as Paramount was concerned, due to that series having significantly lower ratings than TNG. \"So, the driving philosophy was to recapture the bright, optimistic, ship-driven energy of ST:TNG,\" explained Piller. \"The most notable decision in this regard was to put the Maquis into Starfleet uniforms at the end of the pilot.\" (Star Trek Magazine issue 119, pp. 79-80)\n\nAnother example of one of the compilations of notes Jeri Taylor regularly wrote up was notated on 3 August 1993 (at a time when Star Trek: Voyager was still unnamed). In a note regarding the forthcoming show's \"premise,\" Taylor wrote, \"Starfleet sends a ship and crew on a dangerous covert mission […] To accomplish the mission, we must take along someone who has fallen from grace – a former Starfleet officer who may even be in prison. Given a chance to redeem himself, he agrees to help us. During the course of the mission we must find two other nefarious characters; our former officer may have information about them, or know them, or know the area in which they are working. The mission unfolds, and during the course of it – perhaps near the end? – we are somehow zapped to the far reaches of the galaxy, somewhere so far that, by conventional means, it will take ten years or so to get back. The Captain steels herself for this journey, and offers uniforms to the three misfits. Two of them accept and take positions on the bridge; the other won't take the uniform, but agrees to serve in Engineering. The Captain makes clear that the journey home will fulfill their Starfleet job descriptions: they will map and investigate and explore this unknown space. They will get back, and when they do they will have a wealth of information and research to bring to the Federation.\" Other characteristics of this episode which were included in the same notes involve mention of a short-lived alien \"Mayfly\" \"whom we meet after we've been zapped to the ends of the galaxy,\" and the death of the ship's medical officer during the mission, followed by him being replaced by a self-aware holographic doctor. Meanwhile, the other characters included a total of three \"misfits\" – a tactical officer (who was the aforementioned former Starfleet officer), a conn officer, and an assistant engineer. Finally, a listing of \"other idle thoughts\" included the name \"Nick Locarno\" (a reference to a TNG character) and what was most likely an early allusion to the Caretaker alien, with the notes mentioning \"an omnipotent being who has lost its powers.\" (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 175-176 & 177)\n\nThe story continued its gradual development in the regular talks between the trio of executive producers. Another series of notes written by Jeri Taylor, this time dated 8 August 1993, contained a note on the \"story.\" Taylor simply wrote, \"New ship's being commissioned – They take it for mission.\" (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 181 & 186)\n\nIn notes written two days later, the \"Badlands\" were first posited, along with the notion that \"some ships have been lost\" in the area. Also, by this point, an association was begun which linked the character of the former Starfleet officer with the aforementioned TNG role of Nicholas Locarno, though the character, as created for VOY, was to later be renamed \"Tom Paris\". After describing the Badlands, the notes went on to say, \"It's a hiding place for our bad guys, who think they're invulnerable. We take Locarno along, who knows the area, having been with the baddies.\" Another relevant note in the same document suggested that the aforementioned \"Mayfly\" was \"from a world that has been squatted on.\" The squatters were conceived as aliens temporarily known, using shorthand at this early stage of the narrative's development, as \"Crips and Bloods\", though later to be named \"Kazon\". The same notes reiterated too that \"the doctor is killed going through the bubble.\" An ultimately unused story concept in these notes stated, \"We may lose an older Mayfly and take the young one with us.\" A summation of the \"story thoughts,\" up to that point, was also provided in the document. It said, \"Probably 30 minutes setting up, getting Tactical [Officer Locarno] on Board, going into Badlands to chase the other two ['misfits': the conn officer and the assistant engineer]; we get caught in the phenomenon while tractored to the baddy ship, when we come through on the other side, we're still tethered but something weird has happened to the other ship – it's empty, it's six days older, it's a derelict.\" (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 186-187, 176, 177 & 178)\n\nJeri Taylor included more \"story thoughts\" in another summary of notes, dated 16 August 1993 and detailing the warring alien gangs. This document included the note, \"The two baddies we've been hunting for are captured by the Crips and taken to the Mayfly planet.\" (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 187) Featuring the alien planet as a setting of the story allowed for not only the introduction of a new alien species, in the form of one of the gangs, but also some location filming. (Star Trek: Voyager - Inside the New Adventure) Another story possibility was presented in the same document, which suggested, \"We make amends with one of the gangs – but not the other, making us enemies of that gang.\" (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 188)\n\nIn a considerably long summary of notes dated 17 August 1993, Jeri Taylor pondered, \"What is the moral issue which will be addressed in the pilot? Is it the decision to behave as Starfleet people, even though there is 'no more' Starfleet as far as our situation is concerned? Perhaps there are temptations to settle on a planet… to make a new life in this unknown territory… but ultimately we realize we have to head for home, exploring and gathering information, because that's what we, as Starfleet, do. This means there has to be conflict – those who want to remain. Who might that be? […] It might come from the baddies, who will ultimately be redeemed and come to realize that being Starfleet is the way to go (except the assistant engineer).\" An updated listing of the characters in the ultimately amalgamated crew followed, in which one of the three misfits was changed to a science officer rather than a conn officer, though the other two were still a tactical officer (who was no longer identified as Nick Locarno) and an assistant engineer. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 182, 188 & 189) In a subsection called \"What We Know of the Story\", the document then explained,\n\n\"There is an area of space that is like the Bermuda Triangle: ships tend to disappear there, for unknown reasons. But we learn that it's being used as the 'Badlands' – a hiding place for daring bad guys. We are sent in to capture a ship of these bad guys. To that end, we procure the services of a former, fallen Starfleet officer who jumps at the chance to redeem himself and who is made the Tactical Officer of the ship.\n\n\"We enter the Badlands and find the bad guy ship. During our efforts to tractor it, something happens in the anomaly, and we are ﬂung through an incredible array of effects and come out of it in deep deep deep space. We are still tethered to the bad guy ship – but something's weird about it. It's empty, or aged, or shot up. How did that happen? And where's the crew?\n\n\"We soon realize that we're so far from Federation space that it would take fifty years or so to fly back. What are we to do? Search for a world where we might assimilate? Keep chasing the bad guys? Why? Our orders are somewhat meaningless – there's no more 'Starfleet' as far as we're concerned. We can't even send messages. Why bother?\n\n\"Our first instinct is to try to find out how we got flung out here, and if we can get flung back again. But there's no information, no clues – except the bad guy ship, strangely deserted. We investigate it, and decide we'd better find those two guys. They might, through their experience in coming through, have some idea what's happened and how to get back.\n\n\"We're able to track them to the planet of the Mayflys, and find they've been taken prisoner by the Crips – a gang which, in conflict with two other gangs, competes for territory in this region of space. During this time we encounter our Mayfly and another of her species – an older one, near the end of a brief life span.\n\n\"Our adventure allows us to rescue the bad guys from the Crips, and we end up with them, and the Mayfly, on board. But the rescue has incurred the wrath of the Crips and we must extricate ourselves from them. One possibility: we forge a truce, or understanding with them – only to learn that in doing so we have ensured the enmity of the Bloods, who swear to eliminate us.\n\n\"Ultimately, we make the decision to head home. Some may never get there… but it's the journey, the decision, which matters. During this time the two bad guys will have shown themselves to be helpful, and are offered uniforms and positions on the ship. The Science Officer accepts; the Assistant Engineer refuses to don a uniform, but reluctantly accepts a job rather than be bored to death.\n\n\"We will continue to do what Starfleet does – explore and investigate – and whoever makes it back will arrive with a wealth of knowledge to enrich the cultural coffers of the Federation. We will live responsibly, living up to expectations, even though no one's there to make sure we do, because it's the right thing.\" (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 190-191)\n\nThe plot point about the Caretaker having a partner who had left him was inspired by concerns which Paramount Television President Kerry McCluggage voiced to Rick Berman regarding the slowly evolving series' premise, as presented in the 17 August 1993 document. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 188, 191-192) Paramount urged the episode's writers to retain a sense of hopefulness and optimism in the new show, which led to the plot element about the Caretaker's partner. (Star Trek Monthly issue 4, p. 55) Berman remembered, \"Frankly we made a concession to finally finish the sales job… we put the one-armed man out there – which is the other entity that we met in the pilot.\" The existence of the missing Caretaker's partner was conceived as a viable \"out,\" meant as potentially a convenient method of returning the USS Voyager's crew home, if viewer response indicated the series had to make a fundamental shift in its premise and setting. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 192)\n\nThe evolution of the narrative proceeded through September 1993. This episode was influenced by the fact that, as September began, the development talks started including more staff members, such as Senior Art Supervisor/Technical Consultant Michael Okuda and Senior Illustrator/Technical Consultant Rick Sternbach. One topic the pair was tasked with devising was finding a technical rationale for Voyager's leap to a distant part of the galaxy. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 181 & 198)\n\nPlot ideas for this episode continued being discussed by the three executive producers personally and in notes written by Jeri Taylor. One of these, dated 9 September 1993, regarded \"Version Two: Procreation\" and read, \"We are the match he's looking for in DNA; he needs pieces of a strand to build a new Mayfly. 'Give me a child.' After sampling us, he discards us.\" The same document reveals that the creative trio were meanwhile imagining the male alien as a deity who felt it was essential for him to continue acting as parent to the Mayfly. Wrote Taylor, \"We're able to say to him, 'Let go. Your children are stronger than you think.'\" (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 204) She later explained, \"We were thinking as speaking to our children and saying you must learn to take responsibility for yourselves. If we do too much for you, this does not prepare you to go forth into the world.\" (Captains' Logs Supplemental - The Unauthorized Guide to the New Trek Voyages, p. 134)\n\nThe executive producers also worked on encompassing more jeopardy and conflict into the episode. They envisioned the male alien deity as being near death and situated on an array which would be of strategic importance to the alien gangs. It was about this time, too, that the executive producers decided that, rather than have the intermixed crew become allies with one of those gangs, the episode would culminate in a battle between the alien antagonists and the combined crew. In a series of notes dated 10 September 1993, Jeri Taylor stated, \"The dying goo-man is the protector of the Mayflys – sees the fragile balance of their society cracking. If it does, they'll be overrun by the Crips and Bloods. She's a curious, eager person – breaking from her culture, wanting adventure, unwilling to settle for what everyone else has settled for. The Bloods and Crips have taken over the Mayfly planet, and they are now a third world culture. Everything is given them, they're taken care of. Our girl is a heretic because she wants to work – till the land, become self-sufficient. 'Our people are stronger than he thinks.' But goo-man feels they'll be 'run into the sea' when he dies, by the Blood [sic] and Crips. At the end, there's a standoff to hold the B's and C's back; so we have to go to the array to use it (to get back) but end up destroying it to keep the B's and C's from taking control of it.\" (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 188 & 205)\n\nThe developing of the story progressed concurrently with conceptual refinements of the relationship between the rebels, namely the Maquis, and the Starfleet officers. Another of Jeri Taylor's notes, dated 15 September 1993, included her specifying, \"Michael [Piller] introduced the notion of a 'joined by necessity' move at the end of the story, in which the raiders and SF join forces in order to survive, and the raider captain negotiates for his people to have certain key positions on the ship.\" (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 205)\n\nRick Berman and his two producing collaborators wanted to avoid this installment having some burdensome backstory for the Maquis, so the trio opted to conceptually establish the group in TNG and DS9 beforehand. (Star Trek: The Official Starships Collection, issue 28, p. 12) Michael Piller was grateful for this, believing a \"necessary evil\" of pilot episodes is exposition. He expressed, \"Thankfully […] we didn't have to do a lot of work in that regard.\" (Captains' Logs Supplemental - The Unauthorized Guide to the New Trek Voyages, p. 133)\n\nNeither the story nor script for this episode was planned to be written by committee. The task of writing a draft of both fell to Michael Piller. Jeri Taylor and Rick Berman were then to give notes, either written or verbal, after which Piller would include their suggestions in the next drafts. The story and script would be based on the series bible for Star Trek: Voyager, so it made sense for that to be written first. While the first-draft bible was being written, the ship and the region it would end up in during the course of this episode were respectively identified as the \"USS Voyager\" on 25 September and the Delta Quadrant on 27 September. A page-and-a-half story summary for this episode was provided in the initial draft of the bible. The \"Mayfly\" species was now named \"Ocampa\", and the joint crew consisted of nine characters. Although the conn officer was by now named \"Tom Paris\" and the chief engineer was now simply called \"B'Elanna\", the main characters also included Captain \"Kate Janeway\", First Officer \"Chakatoy\", Tactical/Security Chief \"Vicon\", Ops/Communications Officer \"Jay Osaka\", Intern/Medic \"Dah\" (the Ocampa, or \"Mayfly\", female), Doctor \"Zimmerman\", and gofer/guide \"Felux\". After writing the first-draft bible, Piller set to work with expanding on its story summary, as the next step was to write a draft of the pilot story, though it was far too early to initiate work on the script for this outing. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 206, 207 & 208)\n\nAs Michael Piller started drafting the story, he was in his office on the first floor of Paramount's Hart Building. Piller wasn't writing in a vacuum, influenced by the busy environment he was in, the experience of having worked as a writer on DS9: \"Emissary\", and focus groups who strongly suggested viewers wanted a female captain as the central character of the new series. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 209, 214-215)\n\nWhile trying to draft the story for this episode, Michael Piller became aware that he felt the installment should centrally feature one of the main characters undergoing an arc, much like what happens, for example, to Sisko during the course of \"Emissary\". In a memo he wrote Rick Berman and Jeri Taylor (on the subject of \"futures\"), Piller remarked, \"I think we have to re-direct our thinking process. I sat down this week to start on a draft of the story as we've been discussing it and almost immediately realized, I had no through line to work with […] All the plot elements we've come up with will be wonderful to play with after we decide what our through line is going to be. What we're looking for, I think, is the same thing that every successful Star Trek episode has (check the Top 25 if you doubt me) and that is a story that builds to a moral dilemma or crisis for one or more of our characters. Either a life-changing series of events (rare and not necessary) or at least a moment for the audience to ask themselves: Gosh, what would I do in that situation? Assuming it is our Captain that should be faced with this dilemma (and by the way, it is perfectly acceptable that this be a crisis of command a la 'Yesterday's Enterprise[!]': do I sacrifice a few to save the many based on the word of a bartender…), we have to define who she is, what her weaknesses or strengths are, what vulnerabilities she might be to exploit, if there's an inherent moral dilemma available to explore in our theme. Until we know the beginning, middle and end to the through line, or as I always say, get our arms around the perimeter of the story, we can't begin to tell ourselves the plot.\" [1]\n\nThe trio of executive producers wanted the narrative of this pilot episode to be told from a rather fresh perspective, employing an approach not previously used. \"This is a story of how the family comes together,\" said Michael Piller. \"We decided to tell it in a unique way… from the point of view – at least in the beginning – of one of the lesser-ranking officers, Paris, which we felt would make it different from all other Star Trek pilots. Because all the others had taken the captain's point-of-view – starting from the center [or focus, of all the cast members]. So we thought it would be interesting to introduce our captain through the eyes of one of the other characters, and we follow his development.\" (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 218)\n\nAs the story continued to be developed, the character of Dah was discarded from the plot, which nonetheless still incorporated an outcast from the alien \"Mayfly\" species, members of which lived only until they were ten years old. She, along with another female character, named \"Dumas\", joined the Voyager crew in the narrative. However, Michael Piller felt that a lot of exposition was established, focusing on Dumas, in the episode's sixth act. [2]\n\nBetween the issuing of the first-draft series bible – which was ready by the end of September 1993 – and 4 October 1993, the name of the \"gofer/guide\" character was changed from \"Felux\" to \"Felox\". (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 208; [3]) The writing of the story was further influenced by Michael Piller considering, in early October 1993, having more sexual inferences in the plot by making the \"Mayfly\", her species having been named \"Ocampa\", a science officer whose species was instead J'naii, an androgynous alien race that had been established in TNG: \"The Outcast\". Piller now imagined that, rather than having the Voyager crew meet her during the course of the episode, the story began with her already aboard the ship. In a memo he sent Rick Berman and Jeri Taylor on 4 October, Piller reckoned, \"The side benefits to the pilot become immediately clear. We can lose a character – no need for Dumas at all… and lose all the exposition about that character which fall into the expo hole called Act Six. There seemed to be no time for an emotional connection between Dumas and our people anyway – no real reward to the audience for bringing her along. No yays! On the other hand, we've got that 'yay' all set up and ready to go with Felox who fulfills that 'come and join us' urge. The 'Me Too' problem we would have faced by taking along two pick-ups goes away as well.\" However, if the alien outcast was to become a J'naii, Piller wondered what would happen to the concept of having an alien crew member whose race had only ten-year lifespans. [4] After contemplating the possibility of making Felox or Osaka into a Mayfly, Piller decided to resurrect a previously discarded character, Dah, and make her into the Mayfly. ([5]; A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 208) The notion of having a J'naii science officer as a crewmember was ultimately dropped.\n\nSince the three executive producers had decided that Paris' character arc was to be one of The Fall and eventually Redemption, Michael Piller had to, in telling the story about the formation of a family of characters, weave in the character arc for Paris. During early October 1993, Piller was struggling with this aspect of the plot. He began a memo to Rick Berman and Jeri Taylor, dated 6 October, with the statement, \"The good news is that I think once we complete Paris's arc in the second hour, most everything else will fall into place. The bad news is I still don't see the arc and that's what we need to talk about today.\" As the memo went on, Piller described his progress with writing the character arc, though also detailed his uncertainties and questions. \"We've now set up a quest for redemption,\" he wrote, \"for rebirth in traditional Joseph Campbell terms […] and it seems to me we will somehow need new plot elements in part two to force Paris to confront his demons and conquer them. But I'm not living well inside this character yet and I'm not sure I understand what those demons are.\" In a later paragraph of the memo, Piller related, \"Some of the turns that pass through my mind that don't quite seem to work at first glance include: in the array, Paris doesn't follow orders and that's why we're recaptured so he ultimately blames himself for Osaka's fate… or maybe it's too early, maybe he does something the second time they go to the array that gets him in trouble with the Captain or maybe even all the way down on the planet… somewhere maybe Janeway busts him and conﬁnes him to quarters for the rest of the mission and something happens which he alone has to act upon in order to salvage their hopes of getting home or getting Osaka back. In his old pattern, he would turn his back and not take responsibility (do you sense my struggle for the character's identity? That doesn't feel right as I write it). Or is he locked in the brig and fools the holographic doctor so he can escape and do whatever he has to do? (I like that).\" Berman and Taylor met with Piller later the same day, 6 October 1993, and the three talked about the points Piller was struggling with. These issues were ultimately resolved and the process continued. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 218-220)\n\nIn the story as ultimately conceived and outlined, the Voyager crew was captured in and escaped from a hi-tech prison aboard the Caretaker's array. (Star Trek Monthly issue 4, p. 55)\n\nThe team of producers wanted to establish a connection between the new show and the already established parts of the Star Trek universe, much like how Captain Picard had appeared in DS9 pilot \"Emissary\". The end result, this time, was that they wrote Quark into \"Caretaker\", to give Voyager a similar send-off. (Star Trek Monthly issue 36, p. 46)\n\nThe practice of meetings, note-taking, and further revisions allowed the pilot's story outline to develop. It grew from three to seven pages, then fifteen and finally about thirty. (Star Trek Monthly issue 4, p. 54) When Michael Piller delivered his first draft of the episode's story, it ran thirty-six pages. He submitted the document on 18 October 1993 or thereabouts. This draft of the story reflected the name change from \"Felux\" to \"Felox\", and Chakotay was now given a tribal affiliation: Sioux. The story outline was planned to undergo multiple revisions and rewrites and was read by Rick Berman and Jeri Taylor, who each made many notes on it, with comments and suggestions. They next met and spoke with Piller, who made notes of his own. He subsequently began the second draft, which was submitted about two weeks later, on 1 November 1993. After more notes were made on the story, a third draft – in which Chakotay had become a Hopi – was completed by Piller, four days later. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 221)\n\nThe meetings, notes and revisions continued until February 1994, with a draft of the story dated 15 February. The names of the main characters continued to change, such that, in a draft of the series bible which was also dated 15 February, the captain's name was no longer \"Kate Janeway\" but was \"Elizabeth Janeway\", \"Vicon\" was changed to \"Nivok\", \"Jay Osaka\" became \"Harry Kim\", \"Dah\" was replaced with \"Kes\", and \"Felox\" became \"Neelix\". However, the draft of the story from the same date had Neelix's name as \"Neelox\", whereas Kes' name was spelled \"Kess\", and B'Elanna's surname was \"Cortez\". Another draft of the story was submitted the following day, on 16 February. Among the names of the main characters, it listed \"Tuvok\", \"B'Elanna Torres\", \"Neelix\", and \"Kes\", while the same draft of the story cited no particular tribal affiliation for Chakotay, referring to him merely as being \"from a colony of American Indians.\" Essentially, the only main characters who were still to be renamed were \"Elizabeth Janeway\" and the holographic doctor, \"Zimmerman\". (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 221)\n\nEach phase of the story was reviewed and approved by Paramount. (Cinefantastique, Vol. 27, No. 4/5, p. 62) The studio submitted a few small notes on the February outline, advice which the trio of executive producers accepted. (Star Trek Monthly issue 4, p. 54)\n\nAlthough the 16 February draft was considered complete, it underwent additional changes well into March 1994. With the story drafts having finally been completed, it was now time to tackle the challenge of drafting the installment's script. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 222)\n\nBeat outline and script[]\n\nMichael Piller was ready to start trying to draft the script for this pilot episode by early March 1994. Though hectically busy at the time, Piller, Rick Berman, and Jeri Taylor knew this episode had to be a spectacularly high-quality production. If it wasn't, it was hard to imagine how the series and the new network UPN, which was depending on Star Trek: Voyager being a success, could recover. The fact that none of the previous Star Trek pilot episodes had been weak put extra pressure on the makers of this episode, especially Piller. It was in this environment that he started writing the script for the installment, which was still untitled. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 223 & 228)\n\nBefore a complete draft of the script could be written, the producers had to structure this feature-length episode into ten separate acts, before delineating the main scenes in each act. Breaking this story into its constituent parts involved multiple lengthy meetings over a long process which proceeded through March 1994 and into the next month. By mid-April, the consequently produced \"beat outline\" was more-or-less fixed. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 229) As of 13 April, the first three acts of the outline read:\n\n\"TEASER\n\n\"1. INT. MAQUIS SHIP\n\n\"On the run from Cardassians. Est. Chakotay B'Elanna and Tuvok – they proceed into Badlands. Run into strange beam – white out.\n\n\"ACT ONE\n\n\"1. EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE – PENAL COLONY\n\n\"Paris is working as carpenter.

Janeway demands explanation – he ignores her.\" (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 230-232)\n\nIn the writing of the pilot script, Michael Piller wrote, Jeri Taylor rewrote, and Rick Berman, the busiest of them all, gave notes when he had time. All three regularly met, conversed with each other, and made even more notes before Piller returned to his computer. Between early April 1994 and mid-May of the same year, the teleplay went through four drafts, with the episode's name eventually chosen to be \"Caretaker\". In general, the script seemed to be developing well. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 232-233) Piller and Taylor dived into writing the script, polishing it, during the one week of late May between the end of TNG and the official start-up of VOY. (Star Trek Monthly issue 4, p. 54) Said Taylor, \"Michael and I […] divided up the screenplay. He wrote the first half and I wrote the second, then we switched and he worked on the first and I worked on the second. So it was all sort of a mish-mash.\" (Cinefantastique, Vol. 27, No. 4/5, p. 62) Berman said, \"The writing of it was mostly done by Michael and Jeri, but I was very involved in that process [too].\" (Star Trek Magazine issue 179, p. 27) As had been the case with the story, each phase of the script was reviewed and approved by Paramount. (Cinefantastique, Vol. 27, No. 4/5, p. 62)\n\nWhile he was working on the episode's teleplay, Michael Piller became bothered by something about the script. It took him a while to figure out what he felt was wrong with the story. When in bed very late at night on 23 May 1994, Piller realized that the element he thought was missing was a mysterious, surreal environment such as had been in every Star Trek pilot up to that point (for example, an illusory version of Mojave in TOS: \"The Cage\", Q's courtroom in TNG: \"Encounter at Farpoint\", and the realm of the Prophets in DS9: \"Emissary\"). Piller laid out his thoughts in a memo to Jeri Taylor and Rick Berman, dated 24 May 1994 and titled \"The Missing Link on Voyager\". The memo included Piller stating;\n\n\"Our story works, I believe, but it is all real in 24th Century terms – it never leaves the baseline universe as we know it. In fact, it never goes into the UNKNOWN. The fix may be simple. Here's the idea I came up with: what if the inside of the Array isn't test tubes and probes. What if, when we're transported off Voyager, we find ourselves suddenly on the Heather on the Hill from Brigadoon, beautiful people coming to greet us, embrace us… or on the beach of Bora Bora with naked Polynesians coming to greet us… or it's the Orientals from Shogun… or some other earth-like metaphor for voyagers who've landed on strange shores. If the entity can create himself as an old man and a bagpipe, he can create an entire environment from his data bank scans, can't he? So, it seems briefly like an idyllic environment we've come to… the entity in some appropriate guise, tells us relax, I don't mean you any harm, but Janeway knows better not to trust what she sees… Tuvok says it's a hologram… The Polynesian natives, if we go that way, are putting leis around our neck, dancing the dances to the drums and it's hard not to get caught up in this if you're Kim or Paris. It's almost like we were in an old 19th Century whaling ship thrown off course by a hurricane, says Kim. But quickly, the idyllic setting becomes dangerous… not exactly sure how… but instead of probes, some optical zapping might occur, (looking for something more subtle, indigenous to test for this DNA particle)… then one laughing native girl pulls Kim into the bushes as native girls are wont to do… but as he expects carnal delights, he winds up being grabbed by an optical beast and disappears. \"Problems occur: how do we show the entire crew of Voyager has been taken to this wondrous environment… (yes, Captain, the rest of them are just over the ridge) (matte shot on the beach maybe?) (a cast of hundreds?) How do we ﬁnd the Maquis? Maybe we never get to the test for the DNA particle in this sequence – maybe Tuvok uses a tricorder to track down the source of the holographic generator, stumbles into the real world where the Maquis are on ice… which sets off a melee and we're all zapped into unconsciousness right there on the beach. And when we wake up we're back on the ship, more confused than ever. So, the result is – we will never actually see the interior of the Array except for that Maquis on ice moment which might be a matte shot with a few close-ups of the Maquis we know. Every time we go to the Array, we go to this environment. We'd have to lose the tubes… well, let me take that back… maybe they reveal in the very last sequence as he's dying, the signal that he's dead, is the dissolution of the fantasy environment and they reveal that he's an ooze monster. This probably only adds another million to the budget. But it only affects about twenty pages or so – maybe only ten in a substantial way. Anything here, guys?\" ([6]; A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 233-235)\n\nThe basic concept outlined in Michael Piller's memo became the setting of an illusory farmyard and the scene which introduces the alien Caretaker into the story, a scene that is key to the plot. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 235) Added as a minor change while the story evolved into script, the holographic farmyard setting replaced the Caretaker array's hi-tech prison. (Star Trek Monthly issue 4, p. 55) The questions and difficulties Piller mentioned in the memo were eventually dealt with, either by being resolved or simply going away. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 235)\n\nThe executive producers were careful to ensure that the illusory farmyard setting would be significantly different from a Western-themed holonovel they were developing for Janeway to involve herself in, later in the first season (the holonovel eventually developed into the Victoria-era Janeway Lambda One). Their concern about this degree of potential similarity was mentioned in a series of notes (dated 27 May 1994) from one of their many staff meetings regarding the creation of Star Trek: Voyager. [7]\n\nBy mid-1994, the species which involved alien gangs had been named the \"Gazon\" (pronounced with an \"a\" sound, as opposed to an \"ay\" sound). (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 232)\n\nThe first draft of this episode's script was submitted on 8 June 1994. This early version obviously elaborated extensively on what had been outlined in the beat sheet. It also introduced many elements that eventually wound up being included in the final version of the episode. The first draft of the script had Janeway's first name still as \"Elizabeth\" and the species of alien sects was still called the \"Gazon\".\n\nThe first-draft script of \"Caretaker\" started with an extreme close-up of Chakotay's face, rather than with a crawl of text followed by an exterior shot of his spacecraft under attack. The malevolent Cardassian forces were established as being one Cardassian ship, under Gul Evek's command. Not only did the Maquis proceed into the Badlands but they were pursued into that hazardous area by the Cardassian vessel, though Evek's spacecraft then received so much damage in the plasma storms that it couldn't continue. The Maquis ship was now intercepted by \"a massive displacement wave,\" rather than running into \"a strange beam.\"\n\nThere was now no scene involving sexual innuendo between Paris and his supervisor (with the latter not even featuring into the script at all). In the park, he and Janeway visited a \"hotdog replimat\" and each ordered a hotdog from a computerized hotdog vendor (Janeway's with Keladan leeks and capsicum relish, whereas, Paris, referring to himself as \"a purist\", had his with just mustard), which they proceeded to eat while they walked and conversed. However, there was a flirtatious aspect to Paris' conversation with the captain; a script note stated, \"He's using his roguish charm to try and impress her and it almost seems like he's coming on to her with his soft eyes and tone of voice. For much of the scene, it almost seems to be working.\" Right after this script note, Janeway moved an inch toward Paris and, in a soft voice, threatened him that, if a member of her crew became injured because he had made a mistake, she would ensure he was committed to a full-time prison sentence, to which he laughed \"an empty laugh\" to himself, ending the scene. Paris, wearing a gold Starfleet uniform rather than a red one, then flirted with the newly created character of Stadi during the shuttle ride to DS9.\n\nUpon arriving at Quark's in the initial draft of the script, Paris ordered a Romulan ale served in a tall glass. During Harry Kim's discussion with Quark, Kim mentioned that his parents had very affectionately bid him farewell at the Mars colony, and that Starfleet officers don't carry currency. The next scene wasn't set in an airlock corridor aboard DS9 nor had Paris and Kim exiting a turbolift; instead, they entered a corridor onboard Voyager through an airlock. Although they meanwhile chatted about Kim's first posting, he didn't mention how familiar he was with Voyager's class of ship. When introducing himself to the vessel's doctor, Paris referred to himself as an ensign. Thereafter, Janeway obtained some coffee from a replicator in her ready room, prior to Kim and Paris arriving there, before the vessel left DS9.\n\nIn the first-draft script, the episode's second act didn't start with Paris chatting with his father; it started with a shot of Voyager at warp before the mess hall scene with Paris, Kim and others. Those who briefly dined with Kim were limited to being the doctor and only one other crewmember, rather than multiple others. Instead of saying, \"I choose my own friends,\" Kim stated, \"I don't need anyone to choose my friends for me.\"\n\nKerry McCluggage read the draft script and sent a series of his own notes on it to Rick Berman in early June 1994, expressing his concerns about the show. For instance, he felt that the script, as written, didn't make it clear enough that Janeway wouldn't end up breaking the Prime Directive. The next week, Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor responded in a memo to McCluggage, which addressed his concerns. The document explained, \"We've managed to keep Janeway from a direct violation of the Prime Directive, and we believe it's important that she not cross the line and meddle overtly with the destiny of the Ocampa – or we risk sending a message to viewers that we're abandoning one of the basic principles of the Star Trek franchise. She will, however, provide the satisfying message that they are not doomed; rather, they are being given an opportunity to grow and flourish – an opportunity she will guarantee by the selfless act of destroying the Array.\" The same memo also indicated that the trio of writing staffers planned to further clarify, in the script, language which distinguished between the array and the Caretaker, the memo pointing out that Janeway would eschew using the array to return home in order to prevent the Kazon from employing the array to destroy the Ocampa. Furthermore, the memo reassured McCluggage that the next draft of \"Caretaker\" would address his concerns by incorporating appropriate changes. (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, pp. 260-261)\n\nIn drafting the script, Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor struggled with various issues, such as trying to make the viewers invest in the plot. Explained Piller, \"The second hour always seemed to dog us. The biggest danger in the pilot was in creating a story that nobody cared about […] When we got to that second hour and we started to get into the mystery of this underground planet and the Array, there was a little question mark in our minds about how to do it in such a way that the audience would care.\" (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 235) Piller elaborated, \"The most interesting aspect of writing that show was the second hour. The first hour seemed to be quite clearly what a first hour needed to be. When we got into the second hour, the story of the Ocampa, it seemed to get very odd, dry and political. It was hard to care about the Ocampa in the script stage because you couldn't get to know them very well. Why should you root for the Ocampa to be saved if they're rather foolish about the way they blindly follow the Caretaker's wishes and are willing to hold our people against their wishes. That was bothering us.\" (The Official Star Trek: Voyager Magazine issue 4, p. 11)\n\nAnother struggle was making the viewers care about the characters. Because the decision had been made to try to imbue a palpable sense of action-adventure in the episode, the writers spent minimal time on any single character in particular, apart from Paris. Michael Piller believed writing more character material into the installment would, in a way, have been easier to write, as writing about characters was far more comfortable to him than writing about events or technology. \"Instead we played the adventure off the family,\" Piller pointed out. \"So the only true character arc in this show is Paris's.\" (A Vision of the Future - Star Trek: Voyager, p. 235) As a result, many of those inside the series' inner circle felt the episode, even after the first draft of its script was completed, lacked what Piller later referred to as \"heart\". (The Official Star Trek: Voyager Magazine issue 4, p. 11) He further commented, \"I remember feeling that ['Caretaker'] was passionless […] When it was over a couple of people said, 'You know, it's got the kitchen sink in it but no heart', so we really had to get the audience to care about these people […] I think the hardest part of the process was making anyone care about Neelix.\" (Captains' Logs Supplemental - The Unauthorized Guide to the New Trek Voyages, p. 134)\n\nIt was only after the script was written, by Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor, that Brannon Braga got involved in the series. When he returned from vacation, the teleplay had been written. (The Official Star Trek: Voyager Magazine issue 5, p. 45) Braga remembered, \"Me and Ron [Moore] and René [Echevarria] and the other young writers, we were as curious to see that script as anyone else. In fact […] I think we snuck into Jeri Taylor's office and stole a copy out of the drawer and read it, because it was top secret.\" (\"The Sky's the Limit, The Eclipse of Star Trek: The Next Generation, Part One: Umbra\", TNG Season 7 Blu-ray special features) Braga thereafter influenced the development process. \"I really got involved with giving notes on the pilot script and providing input on that,\" he explained. (The Official Star Trek: Voyager Magazine issue 5, p. 45) The show's premise of cutting a starship off from the Federation pleased him, and the executive producers were highly receptive to his advice. \"They were very gracious in taking my input and notes on the pilot,\" Braga remarked. (Cinefantastique, Vol. 27, No. 4/5, p. 67)\n\nSeveral of those who were inside the series' inner circle felt that the lead character of Janeway, not yet cast, was written as incomplete and that no-one would finish watching the pilot episode with a sense that they knew her personality very well. (The Official Star Trek: Voyager Magazine issue 4, p. 11) Extremely late in the writing process, the executive producers came to the realization that, whereas the episode featured many \"brooding moments\" (in Jeri Taylor's words) that demonstrated Janeway's command style, the nurturing and sensitive sides of her personality weren't sufficiently established in the script. The team wanted to highlight them in this episode so as to help differentiate her from Captain Picard. (Cinefantastique, Vol. 27, No. 4/5, p. 35) Despite therefore agreeing with the opinions that the character's depiction in this outing was incomplete and not entirely relatable, Michael Piller, Rick Berman, and Jeri Taylor were uncertain about how to address the issue without upending the structure of the installment's narrative. (The Official Star Trek: Voyager Magazine issue 4, p. 11)\n\nTo further distinguish both Captain Janeway and (by extension) the new series from their respective predecessors, the group of executive producers sought to incorporate a scene in which Janeway would reveal something of her innermost feelings. Michael Piller thought up this idea while he and others were at Kerry McCluggage's home, watching a 4 July fireworks display, televised from the Hollywood Rose Bowl. \"We had written a version of the story which was pretty successful, but it was missing something,\" he remembered. \"We were watching the fireworks at the Rose Bowl, and thinking about some of the notes that we had been given by the studio. I was sitting with Brannon Braga, and I said, 'You know, this really moves, but it doesn't have passion. Where is the passion going to come from? How do I make people understand what Janeway is feeling about what's happening to her crew and everything that is going on?' I was talking about that with Rick [Berman], and Rick's wife, Liz, said 'Yeah, I didn't really feel that I got to know Janeway during the course of the script.' So I said, 'I don't know where we're going to do this, because the structure of this thing is so tight – and it's already long – but we're going to have to find passion and explain Janeway. Somehow, we're going to have to do it in one scene. And it probably will have to be a scene in which we understand from her how she feels about her responsibilities to get this crew home.'\" (Cinefantastique, Vol. 27, No. 4/5, p. 35)\n\nThe solution that the writers eventually hit upon was the scene in which Janeway has a private conversation with Tuvok in the captain's ready room.
