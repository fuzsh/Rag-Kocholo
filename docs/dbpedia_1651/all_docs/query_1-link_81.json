Despite this, phlebology remains a relatively under-represented specialty in many countries, and there is sometimes a lack of high-quality data and access to training materials. As a result, sufferers of venous and lymphatic problems are often inadequately investigated or mismanaged. This is a situation that cannot be allowed to continue. Venous and lymphatic diseases are both common and distressing for suffers. They also impose a large financial burden on the health services of most industrialized countries. These alone are reasons why the topic is worthy of study, and patients have the right to be seen by physicians and nurses with a special interest in the management of their condition. This book, Venous and Lymphatic Diseases, is an attempt to draw together a wide range of experts in various aspects of venous disease to cover the full range of conditions encountered in clinical practice. The aim has been to produce chapters that are both definitive and readable, so that they will be of utility to both the expert in the subject and the novice. To aid this, most chapters have a clear “key points” section. In addition, we have deliberately chosen to invite a mixture of North American and European authors to produce a genuinely international, multidisciplinary approach to the subject. The book is subdivided and organized into related sections and includes sections on investigation as well as treatment, including complex venous surgery and radiological therapies. However, it has been the deliberate aim of the editors that this should not simply be a surgical textbook; as a result, there are extensive sections on non-surgical topics, including drug therapy, venous disorders in pregnancy, compression therapy, and conservative therapies in lymphedema. The first three chapters set the scene by reviewing the historical context, the anatomical terminology, and the physiology of the veins and lymphatics. If the book is useful to those involved in caring for patients with venous or lymphatic disease, then we will have accomplished our aim.\n\niii\n\niv\n\nPreface\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT The editors express their sincere thanks to the contributors who have given so much of their valuable time to produce their sections. Thanks also go to Geoff Greenwood who initially saw the need for such a book and who was pivotal in taking the idea forward to fruition.

This hard-won knowledge still underpins any modern study of venous and lymphatic function in both health and disease.\n\nTHE “DISCOVERY” OF THE VENOUS DRAINING SYSTEMS Meticulous but partial descriptions of the venous system are to be found in the works of Aristotle (384–322 BC ), who described the vena cava and the superficial veins of the upper extremities. However, the real beginning of the study of vascular and lymphatic anatomy is due to Herophilus of Chalcedon (300–250 BC ), a Greek physician living in Egypt. He practiced in Alexandria, where human dissections were permitted, even performing some in public. Herophilus furnished the first anatomical and functional discrimination between arteries and veins. In addition, he was the first to note and describe lacteals, which he observed in the mesentery of man. Galen of Pergamum (130–200 AD ) subsequently described the course of the veins of the whole body and called the smallest vessels “tricoide´,” i.e., “hair-like.” He confirmed that these small vessels connect arteries and veins throughout the body. He believed that blood originated in the liver and moved back and forth through the body, passing through the heart, where it was mixed with air (“pneuma”) by pores in the septum. Galen also introduced the concept of the “spirit” system, consisting of natural spirit or “pneuma” (he thought air was found in the arteries), vital spirit (blood mixed with air found in the arteries), and animal spirit (which he believed to be found in the nervous system). The first complete and systematic description of the whole venous system was finally furnished by Andre´ Vesale (1514–1564) in the De Humanis Corporis Fabrica, illustrated by the magnificent drawings of Jan Stefan van Kalkan (Fig. 1). A depiction of venous valves did not appear in the original Fabrica. They were first described in the renal, azygos, and external iliac veins by Giovanni Battista Canano (1515–1579) from Ferrara in 1540. They were included in the subsequent editions of the Fabrica. Many decades later, Hyeronimus Fabricius of Acquapendente (1533–1619) was 1\n\n2\n\nFigure 1\n\nCaggiati\n\nThe venous system as represented by Vesale in his Fabrica.\n\nthe first to furnish a good description of the valves of the veins and of their role (Fig. 2). He was Harvey’s teacher at Padua and undoubtedly must have stimulated his interest in the circulation of the blood. A description of the perforating veins did not appear until two centuries later. In 1803, they were first described by Justus Christian Von Loder (Fig. 3). In 1824, Paul Briquet described the anatomy of the calf venous pump but believed that blood would be pushed by the calf pump from deep to superficial veins via the perforators. The correct hemodynamic role of perforators was finally stated by Aristide August Verneuil, a French surgeon, in 1855.\n\nLYMPHATIC VESSELS Herophilus (third century BC ) mentioned the existence of the lymphatics. Bartolomeus Eustachii (1500–1574), Professor at La Sapienza University of Rome, described in 1563 the thoracic duct nearly a century before Pecquet (1651); “.a whitish canal going from the clavicular area to lower parts..” Sixty years later (1622) Gaspare Aselli (1581–1626) described the lymphatics. In a posthumous account published in 1627, he stated that lacteals contained milky or creamy fluid. Aselli described also the valves placed along lymphatics, especially at their confluences. His book De Lactibus Sive Lacteis Venis\n\nHistorical Background\n\nFigure 2\n\n3\n\nValves of the sapheno-femoral junction as represented by Fabricius in 1603.\n\nwas published just before the De Motu of Harvey, who had not appreciated Aselli’s discovery and perhaps was not aware of it. Paolo Mascagni (1752–1815) was prosector in anatomy at the University of Siena (Italy). In 1787, Mascagni published a large folio volume entitled Vasorum lymphaticorum corporis humani historia et iconographia. This important monograph contained the first systematic and definitive description of the human lymphatic system (Fig. 4). Mascagni has been credited with discovering some 50% of the lymphatic vessels.\n\nTHE “DISCOVERY” OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD William Harvey (1578–1657) is correctly credited with the “discovery” of the circulation of the blood. He proved that the heart receives and expels blood during each cycle by observing the action of the heart in small animals and fishes. By compressing the visible veins of the forearm, he simply but persuasively confirmed Fabricius’ observation that the venous valves permitted flow in only one direction, toward the heart. But the concept of blood circulation was not new. In fact, Wang Shu So reported in the Mei Ching (China, third century AD ) that “the heart regulates all the blood in the body.The blood\n\n4\n\nCaggiati\n\nFigure 3\n\nThe first drawing in which perforators are reported (Van Loder, 1803).\n\nFigure 4\n\nThe lymph trunks of the pelvis and of the abdomen as represented by Mascagni (1787).\n\nHistorical Background\n\n5\n\ncurrent flows continuously in a circle and never stops.” The Spanish anatomist Ludovicus Vassaeus in 1544 depicted exactly the anatomy of the cardiovascular system and the flow direction in the main vessels. The Spanish theologian Miguel Servede, alias Servetus of Villanueva (1509–1553), described in 1564 the pulmonary circulation: he stated that the blood enters the lungs by the way of the pulmonary artery in greater quantities than necessary for their nutrition, mixes with the “pneuma” and returns by way of the pulmonary veins. The discovery of Servetus did not disseminate to contemporary physicians, probably because it was reported in a theological work. Andrea Cesalpino (1519–1603) from Arezzo, was Professor of Medicine at Pisa and at Rome. He first delineated that blood flows into the heart (“.the blood enters the right ventricle by the vena cava.exit from the heart to open into the lungs.from the left ventricle opens the orifice of the aorta.”). Furthermore, Cesalpino identified the function of the valves (“.certain membranes placed at the openings of the vessels prevent the blood from returning.”) and coined the term “circulation” supposing the existence of “vasa in capillamenta resoluta.” Finally, Realdo Colombo (c. 1510–1577) from Cremona, successor of Vesalius as the chair of anatomy in Padua, furnished an exact description of the circulatory system, denying the previously suggested existence of porosity in the interventricular septum. Harvey’s theory of blood circulation was completely accepted only in 1661, when the Italian Marcello Malpighi (1628–1694) demonstrated using rudimentary microscopes, the existence and hemodynamic role of the capillaries. Mechanisms of venous return were better defined by: (1) Richard Lower, who emphasized the role of the muscular pump and theorized the vis a tergo: “the return of the venous blood is the result of the impulse given to the arterial blood.,” (2) Antonio Maria Valsalva, pupil of Malpighi and teacher of Morgagni, who in 1710 described the respiratory forces that enhance venous return to the heart: the “vis a fronte,” and (3) Giovanni Lancisi, who in 1728 demonstrated experimentally the spontaneous rhythmical contraction of the larger veins.\n\nSCLEROTHERAPY Sclerotherapy is based upon the observation reported in 1815 by Joseph Hodgson (1788–1869) who noted that “thrombosis extinguished varicose veins.” Sclerotherapy developed after the invention of the hypodermic needle in 1845 by Francis Rynd and of the syringe by Pravaz in 1851. However, former attempts of venous cannulation were made by Francesco Folli (1623–1685) who in 1654 accomplished artero-venous blood transfusion by insertion of a silver tube into the artery of the donor and a bone cannula into the vein of the recipient, uniting the two by means of a tube especially made from an animal blood vessel. In 1665, Sigismond Johann Elsholz (1623–1688) used a chicken bone as a needle and the bladder of a pigeon as a syringe to irrigate ulcers by intravenous injection of distilled water or of essences from plants. Many substances have been used to induce venous obstruction. Here are a few examples: Monteggio and De Leroy d’Etoilles (1840) proposed absolute alcohol for sclerotherapy. Pravaz (1851) used ferric chloride. Benedetto Schiassi from Bologna used a combination of iodine and potassium iodide. Kausche (1917) proposed inverted sugar for sclerotherapy of varicose veins. After having used sodium carbonate for 4 years, Sicard came to prefer sodium salicylate because “it occluded varicose veins and, at the same time, it mitigated the arthritis that occurred in so many patients with varicose veins.” In 1921, Genevrier, a military surgeon, discovered that injection of quinine solution to treat malarial crisis could cause venous sclerosis. He suggested injecting a concentrated quinine solution in the diseased veins of malarial varicose patients thereby treating both\n\n6\n\nCaggiati\n\ndiseases. In 1925, Linser of Dresden reported the use of a 20% solution of ordinary table salt to sclerose varicose veins. Different techniques of venipuncture and strategies for sclerotherapy developed in the last century. Benedetto Schiassi from Bologna, was the first to perform intraoperative injections. In 1944, Horbach introduced the technique called “air block” to enhance the effects of sclerotherapy. In 1963, Fegan described his methods of sclerosing varicose veins based upon tight post injective compression and in the 1990s Shadek introduced the Duplex evaluation of the effect of sclerosing agents. Duplex monitoring has recently allowed the use sclerosing foam obtained chemically (Juan Cabrera) or by a mechanical procedure (Lorenzo Tessari).\n\nSURGERY Historically, venous surgery started in the second century BC with Heliodorus. He gave the first description of ligation and torsion of blood vessels to control hemorrhage. The Roman Celsus extirpated varicose veins with a blunt hook and used cauterization with a red hot iron. Oribasius of Pergamum (325–405 BC ) was the first of the Byzantine surgeons who dealt with varicose veins. He devoted three chapters of his Book XLV to this subject and recommended: (1) shaving and bathing the leg to be operated, (2) with the leg still warm, the surgeon has to mark varicose veins with the patient standing (they marked them by small incisions!), (3) the use of a special hook, called a cirsulce, (4) to extirpate varicose vein of the lower leg firstly, then at the thigh, (5) to remove the veins because, if only ligated, they can form new varices. “Open surgery” of varicose veins started with Paulus of Aegina (625–690). He recommended isolation of varicose veins at the thigh by a longitudinal incision, and, after bloodletting, to ligate them at both ends. The tied-off portion was excised or allowed to slough off later with the ligatures. Arab surgeons operated on varicose veins by cautery. Guglielmo Saliceti, from Piacenza (Italy), alias Williams of Saliceto (1210–1277), had the great merit of reintroducing the use of the knife into surgery, which had been abolished by the Arabs. Giovanni da Vigo (1460–1525), surgeon to Pope Julius II, ligated the veins “.intromittendo acum sub vena desuper filium stringendo.” (by introducing a needle beneath the vein and tightening the thread from above) (1514). In 1545, Ambroise Pare` (1510–1590), after initially treating varicose veins by external cauterization (Arab tradition), reintroduced the use of ligature of varicose veins. Modern venous surgery started with the Swiss surgeon Tommaso Rima (1777–1843), who was the first to propose in 1806, a hemodynamic treatment of varicose veins with ligation of the upper portion of the great saphenous vein, an operation generally credited to Trendelemburg (1896). In 1816, Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie (1783–1862) operated on varicose veins: “.after the skin over a varix was incised, the varix was divided with a curved bistoury and pressure was applied to prevent haemorrhage...” Alfred Armand Louis Marie Velpeau (1795–1864) introduced a pin or needle through the skin, which was passed underneath the vein, and at right angles to it. A twisted suture was then applied round the two ends of the pin, so as to compress the vein sufficiently to produce its obliteration. In 1877, Max Schede reported a technique for radical removal of varicosities based upon multiple ligature or venesections and percutaneous ligations. In 1884, Madelung proposed the complete excision of the great saphenous vein through a long incision much like those used today in vein harvest for coronary bypass. In 1906, Delbet proposed to treat varicose veins by re-implantation of the terminal portion of the great saphenous vein just below a healthy femoral valve.\n\nHistorical Background\n\n7\n\nIn 1905, W.L. Keller described a rigid intraluminal stripper to extirpate the Great Saphenous Vein. Two years later, Babcock modified the technique of Keller and devised the acorn tip and used a flexible rod. Finally, in 1907 Mayo proposed an extraluminal ring stripper that was modified by Myers and Smith in 1947. In 1956, Robert Muller elaborated a modern technique for ambulatory stab avulsion of varicose veins. In 1963, Jean Van der Stricht described the “saphenectomy by invagination” refining similar techniques proposed in the past. Utilizing Duplex preoperative evaluation of the varicose bed, in 1988 Claude Franceschi proposed a minimally-invasive and conservative treatment of varicose veins designated with the acronym CHIVA (“conservative haemodynamic treatment of incompetent and varicose veins in the ambulatory patient”). Endovascular treatment of the Saphenous vein started in 1964 when Politowski destroyed varicosities by endovenous electrosurgical dessication. In 1972 Watts described the treatment of saphenous varicosities by endovenous diathermy. In 1981 Milleret and Le-Pivert proposed a freezing technique to treat saphenous insufficiency. In 1989, Puglisi and his colleagues of the School of Malan (Milan) firstly reported at the IUP Congress in Strasbourg, the use of endovenous Laser to treat varicose saphenous veins. At the end of the 1990s, radiofrequency probes were introduced into clinical practice to induce endovenous obliteration of the Saphenous veins. Selective surgery of perforating veins was proposed in 1938 by R.R. Linton, who proposed a medial subfascial approach to treat incompetent perforating veins. In 1953, Cockett and Jones proposed the epifascial ligature of medial ankle perforators. Two years later, Felder recommended that subfascial incision for ligation of perforating veins should be placed in the posterior midline of the calf to avoid placing the lower end of the incision over the ulcer itself or in the compromised skin of the medial leg, the so-called “posterior stocking seam” approach. Bassi suggested avulsion of perforators by use of a hook. Finally, in 1985, Hauer performed the first subfascial endoscopic interruption of perforating veins.\n\n2 Venous and Lymphatic Anatomy Alberto Caggiati Department of Anatomy, University “La Sapienza,” Rome, Italy\n\nTHE ROOTS OF THE DRAINING SYSTEMS: THE MICROVASCULAR BED The microvascular bed includes the terminal arterioles, the precapillary sphincters, the capillaries and the small venules. The microvascular bed also includes the initial lymphatics, the lymphatic capillaries and artero-venous anastomoses (AVA). The wall of the arterioles contains smooth muscle cells and these are the major site of systemic vascular resistance. The rhythmical contractile activity of the precapillary sphincter causes intermittent flow in the capillaries (vasomotion) and allows a large number of capillaries to remain open or closed for long periods. The walls of the capillaries are made up of flat endothelial cells lying on a basal lamina (BL) and oriented with the vessel’s long axis. In some organs, capillaries have pericapillary cells (pericytes) imbedded within the BL, which play a contractile role. Endothelial cells secrete vasoconstrictor, vasodilator, mitotic agents, and their own BL. Capillaries are drained by venules. Initially, the venular wall is strengthened by pericytes, then by smooth muscle cells, increasing in number and layers. Initial lymphatics are blindly ending tubes, 5–50 mm wide, making up a net of lymphatic capillaries. Their wall is made up of flat endothelial cells, a discontinuous BL and fine anchoring fibrils. The wall permits the capillary to drain water, solutes, cells or cellular remnants from the tissue spaces. Then, the lymph passes into larger and richly valvulated lymphatic vessels with a very thin wall composed of endothelium, basal lamina and collagen, with scattered smooth muscle cells. The microvascular bed of some tissues (e.g., skin) contains direct connections between arterioles and venules. Such AVA allow blood to bypass the capillary bed. Accordingly, the flow in these shunts does not participate in transfer of gases, nutrients or wastes. The arrangement of these connections may be extremely simple (direct connections) or extremely complex, like in the skin, where AVA play an important role in heat regulation.\n\nTHE SUPERFICIAL VENOUS SYSTEM OF THE LOWER LIMB The capillaries of the subcutaneous tissue are drained by two main venular plexuses. The more superficial is situated in the dermal papillae. The deeper venular plexus is placed 9\n\n10\n\nCaggiati\n\nFigure 1 Planar anatomy of the veins of the lower limb. The saphenous compartment (*) is delimited by the saphenous fascia (sf) and the muscular fascia (mf) and hosts only the great saphenous vein. Epifascial veins course in the epifascial compartment (EC). The deep compartment (DC) hosts intramuscular veins (imv) and axial veins (av).\n\nat the boundary between the papillary and the reticular layers of the dermis. These plexuses are drained by a tremendously complicated net of interconnected veins that lie superficially with respect to all the fasciae of the limb: the epifascial veins (Fig. 1) These are very thin-walled and run close to the dermis surrounded only by amorphous fat. For these reasons, epifascial veins are more prone to varicose changes (dilatation, elongation, and tortuosity). Epifascial veins are extremely variable in number, size, and path. Nevertheless, there is some order in their variability, because a few of them are quite constant in size, path, and connections. These have been designated in longitudinal and oblique groups (Table 1). Longitudinal epifascial veins are parallel to the saphenous veins (SVs) and richly connected with them. For these reasons, they have been designated “accessories” of the relative saphenae, and in order to allow their easy identification, they are discriminated on the basis of their topography [for the great SV: anterior,a posterior, and superficial accessories (Figs. 2 and 3); for the small SV: superficial accessory]. Besides the accessories of the saphenae, longitudinal epifascial veins also include the lateral venous plexus, whose veins course along the lateral leg and thigh. Oblique epifascial veins connect main longitudinal veins, SVs, or their accessories (Fig. 4). In the thigh, oblique veins are called “circumflex veins” due to their path. The anterior thigh circumflex vein (ATCV) connects the lateral venous plexus with the GSV. The posterior thigh circumflex vein (PTCV) originates from the SSV, from the lateral plexus, or from reticular veins of the posterior thigh to drain into the GSV or its posterior accessory. These veins are responsible for reflux transmission between the great and the small SVs. Interfascial (saphenous) veins course in an intermediate plane between epifascial and deep veins and are the great saphenous vein (GSV), the small saphenous vein (SSV), and its thigh extension (not mentioned in the CEAP). They course deeply in the subcutaneous tissue, close to the deep fascia (DF). They are covered by a continuous\n\na\n\nThe anterior accessory of the GSV at the upper thigh, courses deeply (just above the muscular fascia, like the GSV) and below a hyperechoic fascia that resembles the GSV covering (Fig. 4). However, the AAGSV can be easily identified because it courses more anteriorly with respect to the GSV with a path corresponding to that of the underlying femoral artery and veins.\n\nVenous and Lymphatic Anatomy Table 1\n\n11\n\nNomenclature of the Superficial Veins\n\nGreat saphenous vein: Sapheno-femoral junction Terminal valve Pre-terminal valve External pudendal vein Superficial circumflexiliac vein Superficial epigastric vein Superficial dorsal vein of clitoris or penis Anterior labial veins Anterior scrotal veins Anterior accessory of the great saphenous vein Posterior accessory of the great saphenous vein Superficial accessory of the great saphenous vein Small saphenous vein: Sapheno-popliteal junction Terminal valve Pre-terminal valve Cranial extension of the small saphenous vein Superficial accessory small saphenous vein Anterior thigh circumflex vein Posterior thigh circumflex vein Intersaphenous veins Lateral venous system Dorsal venous network of the foot Dorsal venous arch of the foot Superficial metatarsal veins (dorsal and plantar) Plantar venous subcutaneous network Superficial digital veins (dorsal and plantar) Lateral marginal vein Medial marginal vein Source: Modified from Ref. 1.\n\nconnective membrane, the saphenous fascia (SF).

Varicose changes in refluxing SVs are relatively slow to develop and less pronounced than those of nonsaphenous, being visible only by Duplex sonography in many limbs. This is due to the deep position of the SVs, to their thicker wall, and to the fasciae of the SC, which oppose their dilatation. Sapheno-Femoral Junction The GSV terminates at the groin in the common femoral vein (CFV). In about 70% of limbs, a valve is placed just above its opening (supra-saphenic valve) to protect the lower limb vasculature from the abdomino-pelvic hydrostatic column (Fig. 5). There is also usually a valve at the GSV opening (terminal valve, TV), to prevent reflux from the CFV.\n\nOblique epifascial veins\n\nFigure 4 Oblique epifascial veins connect longitudinal epifascial with the great saphenous vein or with deep veins, via perforators.\n\nVenous and Lymphatic Anatomy\n\n13\n\nA few centimeters below the terminal valve is the pre-terminal valve (PTV), which prevents reflux from tributaries of the SFJ into the GSV trunk. The TV is present in 100% of limbs and the PTV in about 70%. SFJ tributaries reach the GSV between the PTV and the TV. All SFJ tributaries may be the source of reflux, especially those connected to pelvic veins (external pudendal vein, genital veins). Full Duplex evaluation of the SFJ should assess PFV, TV, PTV competence and flow patterns in SFJ tributaries. Classic descriptions of the SFJ tributaries include the following vessels: external pudendal, superficial dorsal vein of clitoris or penis, anterior labial or scrotal veins (from the external genitalia), superficial circumflex iliac vein (from the lateral abdominal and pelvic wall), and the superficial epigastric vein (from the anterior abdominal wall). The accessories of the GSV must also be included in the group of SFJ tributaries. The termination of the SFJ tributaries varies greatly. In fact, they usually end into the GSV, but, less frequently, they can join directly the common femoral vein. Further, saphenous tributaries can join themselves before ending, forming large trunks that can be confused with the GSV (Fig. 6). In about one-third of limbs with an incompetent GSV, the reflux does not originate from the CFV, but it comes from one of the GSV inguinal tributaries. This occurs more frequently from the external pudendal or from veins draining the external genitalia. In most cases, junctional reflux descend along the GSV. It is not rare to observe a junctional reflux passing from the GSV in one of its inguinal tributaries at the groin or at the upper thigh. This occurs more frequently into the anterior accessory. SSV Termination and SPJ The morphology of the SSV termination varies greatly. This is because in the embryo, the SSV extends along the posterior face of the thigh (the so-called “post-axial vein”) to end into the inferior gluteal vein. In most limbs, the thigh portion of the embryonic SSV disappears when the deep system develops and the SSV ends in the popliteal vein. In about one-third of limbs, the thigh portion of the SSV persists in part (Fig. 7). It is of particular clinical relevance when the termination of the SSV is into the GSV via the posterior thigh circumflex vein (Giacomini’s anastomosis).\n\nSSV\n\nTV\n\nISV PTV\n\nFigure 5 Valves of the sapheno-femoral junctions.

Source: Modified from Ref. 5.\n\nDEEP VEINS OF THE LOWER LIMB The term deep veins designates indiscriminately all veins that course below the deep (muscular) fascia. In turn, this group of veins is quite heterogeneous from both anatomic and functional points of view (Table 2). Intramuscular veins are arranged as a plexus around bundles of myocites. They are particularly developed in the muscles of the foot sole, of the calf, and of the buttock, where they actively contribute to the propulsion of blood (muscle pumps). Isolated thrombosis of muscular sinusoids may simulate muscular disease but are easy to be evidenced by Duplex.\n\nVenous and Lymphatic Anatomy\n\nFigure 7\n\n15\n\nThe path of the thigh extension of the small saphenous vein (dotted line).\n\nAxial veins, whose role is to conduct blood toward pelvic collectors, are satellite of the corresponding arteries. They are constantly double at the leg. Anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal veins join to form the popliteal at different levels of the popliteal fossa. For this reason, in many limbs the popliteal may appear double. The popliteal passes into the femoral vein, which receives the deep femoral vein at the upper thigh to form the common femoral vein. The common femoral vein, after receiving the great saphenous, continues into the external iliac. Duplex investigation of limbs with clinical evidence of DVT must take into account that occlusion may occur in only one branch of a duplicated femoral or popliteal. In case of thrombosis of the popliteal-femoral axis, the drainage of the limb can be allowed by other veins, which, in normal conditions, are small sized and hemodynamically irrelevant. Main collateral path are: 1. A double femoral vein 2. The deep femoral venous axis. In fact, the popliteal vein is connected with the roots of the deep femoral by anonymous muscular veins, which can enlarge when the femoral vein is occluded 3. The obturator vein, which normally drains only a small portion of the medial thigh to confluence into the internal iliac 4. The sciatic vein, which normally drains only the sciatic nerve and drains into the inferior gluteal veins. It may be connected with the deep and superficial veins of the posterior leg. The sciatic vein can be the source of a reflux responsible for leg varicose veins. 5. Perforating veins (PVs) (Table 3 and Fig. 8).\n\n16 Table 2 Thigh\n\nKnee Leg\n\nFoot\n\nCaggiati Nomenclature of the Deep Veins Common femoral vein Femoral vein Deep femoral vein Deep femoral communicating veins (accompanying veins of perforating arteries) Medial circumflex femoral vein Lateral circumflex femoral vein Sciatic vein Popliteal vein Genicular venous plexus Sural veins Soleal veins Gastrocnemius veins Medial gastrocnemius veins Lateral gastrocnemius veins Intergemellar vein Anterior tibial veins Posterior tibial veins Fibular or peroneal veins Medial plantar veins Lateral plantar veins Deep plantar venous arch Deep metatarsal veins (plantar and dorsal) Deep digital veins (plantar and dorsal) Pedal vein\n\nSource: Modified from Ref. 1.\n\nPERFORATING VEINS PVs are the vessels that connect superficial collectors with subfascial veins. Most of them are valvulated and permit only flow toward the subfascial compartment. Most of them are microscopically sized and hemodynamically irrelevant. PVs have been designated in “direct PVs” (those connecting a superficial vein with an axial deep vein) and “indirect PVs” (those connecting a superficial vein with a intramuscular vein). More than 100 PVs are in the lower limbs. In fact, one or two veins accompany all the perforating arteries that supply the subcutaneous layer. Theoretically, each of these PVs can dilate and assume clinical relevance in varicose syndromes or in DVT. However, PVs, which more frequently assume clinical relevance, are quite constant and have been grouped and designated according with their topography. CEAP designates only thigh (AP17) and leg (AP18) PVs. PVs may represent the starting point of a reflux or its point of re-entry. In both conditions, they play a pivotal role in the hemodynamics of varicose limbs and need specific treatment for their selective interruption. PVs have been designated on the basis of their topography (Fig. 8). The Veins of the Pelvis Pelvic veins are of great clinical importance due to their role in venous thrombo embolism (VTE), pelvic congestive syndromes, and varicose veins of the lower trunk and limbs.\n\nVenous and Lymphatic Anatomy Table 3\n\n17\n\nNomenclature of the Perforating Veins (PVs)\n\nFoot perforators\n\nAnkle perforators\n\nLeg perforators\n\nKnee perforators\n\nThigh perforators\n\nGluteal perforators\n\nDorsal foot PV or intercapitular veins Medial foot PV Lateral foot PV Plantar foot PV Medial ankle PV Anterior ankle PV Lateral ankle PV Medial leg PV Paratibial PV Posterior tibial PV (cockett PV) Anterior leg PV Lateral leg PV Posterior leg PV Medial gastrocnemius PV Lateral gastrocnemius PV Intergemellar PV Para-achillean PV Medial knee PV Suprapatellar PV Lateral knee PV Infrapatellar PV Popliteal fossa PV Medial thigh PV PV of the femoral canal Inguinal PV Anterior thigh PV Lateral thigh PV Posterior thigh PV Postero-medial Sciatic PV Posterolateral Pudendal PV Superior gluteal PV Mid gluteal PV Lower gluteal PV\n\nSource: Modified from Ref. 1.\n\nFigure 8\n\nTopography of main groups of perforating veins.\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31\n\n18\n\nCaggiati\n\nPelvic venous anatomy is extremely complex, due to the presence of many veins and plexuses, showing variable pathways, size, and connections (Table 4). The pelvic walls and the pelvic organs are covered by plexuses of tiny avalvulated veins. These plexuses are connected by numerous avalvulated anonymous vessels and drained by larger (mostly avalvulated) veins that (Table 5) open into mayor collectors (poorly valvulated). Pelvic venous congestive hypertension can be transmitted to the venous system of the lower limb due to many “latent” connections. The more important occur at the level of the: (1) obturator vein, which connect the hypogastric vein with veins of the upper medial thigh (2) sciatic vein, which connect with deep and superficial veins of the posterior thigh and leg (3) gluteal veins, which connect with the sciatic vein or with superficial veins of the posterior thigh (4) pudendal veins, which connect the hypogastric venous district with superficial veins of the perineum (5) the veins of the round ligament, which connect uterine plexus with the superficial inguinal veins.\n\nTable 4\n\nNomenclature of Pelvic Veins\n\nPlexuses and peripheral veins 1 5 11 12 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 29 30 31 32 33 34\n\nPampiniform plexus Sacral venous plexus External rectal plexus Internal rectal plexus (Hemorrhoidal) Deep perineal veins Superficial perineal veins Deep dorsal veins of clitoris Deep veins of clitoris Deep dorsal veins of penis Deep veins of penis Urethral bulb veins Pudendal plexus Vesical plexus Prostatic plexus Uterine plexus Vein of the broad ligament Vaginal plexus\n\nSource: Modified from Ref. 2.\n\nDraining veins 2 3 6 7 8 8 13 15 16 17 18 19 27 28 35 36 37 39 40 41 42\n\nOvarian veins Testicular veins Median sacral vein Ileolumbar vein Internal iliac (hypogastric) External iliac Superior rectal vein Middle rectal veins Inferior rectal veins Superior gluteal veins Inferior gluteal veins Lateral sacral veins Internal pudendal vein Obturator veins Vesical veins Uterine veins Vaginal veins Pubic veins (accessory obturator veins) Sovrapubic veins Inferior epigastric vein Deep circumflex iliac vein\n\nMain collectors 4 10 14 38 43\n\nInferior vena cava Common iliac vein Inferior mesenteric vein Internal iliac vein (Hypogastric) External iliac vein\n\nVenous and Lymphatic Anatomy Table 5\n\nDesignation of Lymphatics\n\nName\n\nNumber\n\nTopography\n\nLateral group\n\n4–6\n\nMedial and posterior aspects of the axillary vein\n\nAnterior or pectoral group\n\n4–5\n\nPosterior or subscapular group Central group\n\n6–7\n\nApical group\n\n19\n\n3–4\n\n6–12\n\nProvenience of afferents\n\nFrom the whole arm with the exception of the lymphatics, which course along the cephanlic vein Along the lower bor- From the anterior and lateral thoracic der of the pectoralis walls, and the minor, close the central and lateral lateral thoracic parts of the mamma artery Lower margin of the From the back of the neck and of the posterior wall of the posterior thoracic axilla close to the wall subscapular artery Adipose tissue near From all the preceding the base of the groups of axillary axilla glands Posterior to the upper From all the preceding groups and portion of the peclymphatics accomtoralis minor and panying the cephaabove the upper lic vein border of this muscle\n\nDestination of efferents Part to the central and apical axillary nodes, part to the inferior deep cervical glands To the central and apical group of axillary glands\n\nTo the apical and central group of axillary glands To the apical glands\n\nConsitute the subclavian trunk, which joins directly the junction of the internal jugular and subclavian veins\n\nThe Venous System of the Upper Limb The general arrangement of the venous system of the upper limb resembles that of the inferior one, being divided into two sets, superficial and deep; the two sets are richly anastomosed by perforating vessels. Both groups of veins are valvulated. The deep veins follow the course of the arteries, forming their venæ comitantes. They are generally arranged in pairs situated one on either side of the corresponding artery, connected at intervals by short avalvulated oblique. Paired deep veins accompany the arteries in the hand, forearm and arm, to confluence into the axillary vein, which continues into the subclavian at the outer border of the first rib. This vein passes behind the clavicle and subclavius and in front of the subclavian artery, from which it is separated by the scalenus anterior and the phrenic nerve. The subclavian vein ends at the sterno-clavicular joint, where it joins with the internal jugular to form the brachiocephalic trunk. Main superficial veins originate from a tiny plexus of subdermic veins. The cephalic vein originate from the radial side of the dorsal network of the hand to course along the radial border of the forearm. At the elbow it joins the basilic vein by the median basilic vein, which corresponds to the vein of Giacomini of the inferior limb. Then, the cephalic vein courses in the groove between the brachioradialis and the biceps brachii. In the upper third of the arm, it passes between the pectoralis major and deltoideus. Finally, it pierces the coracoclavicular fascia to end in the axillary vein.\n\n20\n\nCaggiati\n\nThe basilic vein begins in the ulnar side of the dorsal venous network and runs up the posterior surface of the ulnar margin of the forearm. At the elbow, it is joined by the vena mediana cubiti. It ascends obliquely in the groove between the biceps brachii and pronator teres and perforates the deep fascia at the middle of the arm, to reach the axillary vein after having sided the brachial artery. Lymphatic System The lymph passes from initial lymphatics to lymphatic capillaries, which join to form lymphatic vessels. These are richly valvulated and provided with smooth muscle. The segments of lymphatic vessels comprised between two sets of valves are called lymphangions. Smooth muscles in the walls of the lymphatic vessels cause the lymphangions to contract sequentially allowing the flow of lymph toward the thoracic region. Valves prevent backward flow. Lymphatic Vessels of the Lower Extremity The lymphatic vessels of the lower extremity consist in a superficial and a deep set, like veins. The existence of connections between these two systems by perforating lymphatics has been postulated but never clearly demonstrated. The main superficial lymphatic vessels arise from a plexus of tiny lymphatics that pervade the skin everywhere. They are divisible into two groups: a medial, which follows the course of the GSV, and a lateral, which accompanies the SSV. The vessels of the medial group are larger and more numerous than those of the lateral group They commence on the dorsum of the foot and ascend close to the GSV to end in the subinguinal group of superficial nodes. The vessels of the lateral group arise from the fibular margin of the foot and accompany the SSV to enter the popliteal glands. The deep lymphatic vessels accompany the deep axial veins. They are few in number and smaller in size, if compared with the superficial ones. Leg deep lymphatics enter the popliteal lymph glands. Six or seven small popliteal glands are embedded in the fat contained in the popliteal fossa. One of them is close to the terminal part of the SSV, while the others lie at the sides of the popliteal vessels. Most of popliteal efferents course along the femoral vessels to enter the deep inguinal glands. Twelve to twenty inguinal glands are in the upper portion of the femoral triangle. A horizontal line at the level of the termination of the GSV divides them into the superficial inguinal glands, which are designated in a proximal and a distal group. Proximal glands are located just below the inguinal ligament and receive afferents from the gluteal region and from the abdominal wall (lateral glands) and from the external genitalia and perineum (medial glands). The glands of the distal group are located close to the saphenous ending, and they drain all the superficial lymphatics that course close to the GSV. One to three deep subinguinal glands are on the medial side of the common femoral vein. Usually, the lowest is just below the SFJ, the middle in the femoral canal, and the highest in the femoral ring. They receive the femoral lymphatics and small lymphatics from the external genitalia and superficial inguinal nodes. The efferentes of the inguinal glands reach the external iliac glands, from eight to ten in number, which lie along the external iliac vessels and the common iliac glands, four to six in number, located along the common iliac artery and below the bifurcation of the aorta. Common iliac glands also drain the hypogastric collectors, and their efferents pass to the lateral aortic glands. Most of the vessels originating from the lateral aortic glands converge to form the right and left lumbar trunks, which join the cisterna chyli to continue into the thoracic\n\nVenous and Lymphatic Anatomy\n\n21\n\nduct. The thoracic duct enters the thorax through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm and ascends between the aorta and azygos vein. It ends in the left subclavian vein, at its angle of junction with the internal jugular vein. Its termination is protected by two semilunar valves, which prevent the passage of venous blood into the duct. The Lymphatics of the Upper Extremity Also in the upper extremity, lymphatic vessels are arranged into two sets, superficial and deep. The superficial lymphatic vessels originate in the lymphatic plexus of the palm and on the flexor aspect of the digits. From the dense plexus of the palm, main lymphatics run upward in front of and behind the wrist, and they are collected into radial and ulnar groups, which accompany the cephalic and basilic veins respectively. Most of ulnar (or basilic) lymphatics end in the lateral group of axillary glands. Some of the radial (or cephalic) vessels are collected into a trunk which ascends with the cephalic vein to the deltoideopectoral glands, located below the clavicle. The efferents from this group pass either to the subclavicular axillary glands or to the inferior cervical glands. The deep lymphatic vessels course close to the deep veins and arteries. In the forearm, they consist of four sets, corresponding with the radial, ulnar, volar, and dorsal interosseous arteries. At the elbow, (Fig. 9) they unite to form small collectors that course\n\nFigure 9\n\nThe venous system of the upper limb.

A few of them end in glands scattered along the brachial artery. Most of them pass into the lateral group of the axillary glands. Twenty to thirty nodes are located in the axilla (Fig. 10). They are designated topographically. Table 5 summarizes their connections.\n\nREFERENCES 1. Caggiari A, Bergan JJ, Gloviczki P, Jantet G, Wendell-Simith CP, Partsch H.

In the lower limbs these systems are particularly adapted to man’s erect posture with modifications for the high venous pressures to which the lower limb tissues would normally be exposed. The Edinburgh Vein Study found that 32% of women and 40% of men had clinical evidence of venous disease in the lower limb (1), making this group of diseases some of the most common vascular disorders.\n\nTHE CIRCULATION AND THE VENOUS SYSTEM The heart is ultimately responsible for all flow in the circulatory system. The pressure produced by contraction of the left ventricle is transmitted through the arterial system, and via the capillary bed to the venous system. This capillary venous filling pressure is known as the vis a tergo. This depends on arterial pressure which is dependent on cardiac output and on peripheral resistance. Cardiac output, in turn, is dependent on venous return via the left atrium, the vis a fronte. Cardiac output is extremely sensitive to cardiac filling pressure. Stroke volume may change up to 50% in response to a change in venous filling pressure of as little as 1 cm H2O. Reflex changes in heart rate, cardiac contractility, peripheral vascular resistance and venous capacitance minimise this effect, however, central venous pressure remains pivotal in cardiovascular homeostasis. At any one time, 70% of the total blood volume lies within the veins. This is made possible by the physical properties of the vein wall. At low transmural pressures, veins collapse, their walls approximating. On filling, the major veins assume an elliptical shape. Passive distension then occurs with little increase in pressure within the walls, allowing a large volume of blood to be accommodated. Only when the cross-section becomes circular does pressure rise appreciably (Fig. 1). A very much larger volume of blood is then required to stretch the vein wall than was required for passive distension. Blood may be rapidly mobilized from these capacitance vessels to improve central venous pressure. This is achieved partly by contraction of smooth muscle within the vein wall, which is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system, and partly by elastic recoil of the vein wall in the face 23\n\n24\n\nSmith Vein empty\n\nPartial filling\n\nVein full\n\nFigure 1 One of the main functions of large veins is to act as capacitance vessels and contain about 70% of circulating blood volume.\n\nof reduced flow. Although all veins have similar properties, the splanchnic veins are the main capacitance vessels. Veins of skeletal muscle and skin are more concerned with temperature regulation. Most of the large veins in the lower extremity lie within the muscular compartments of the leg and are subject to external compression during calf muscle contraction. Using Duplex ultrasound B-mode scanning to observe the large axial veins that are not subject to muscular compression, it was found that they collapsed in a circular rather than elliptical configuration is response to a decrease in venous volume (2). These veins are supported on all sides by connective tissue and/or fat and are subject to equal external pressure vectors at all points on the vein wall. They expand or collapse in response to changes in venous volume through changes in circular diameter rather than change in the shape of the vein resulting from external compression. Once the vein reaches a circular shape, further increases in venous volume require increased intra-luminal pressure to increase the venous circumference and venous volume. Due to the thinness of the vein walls, minimal pressure increases are needed to overcome the inherent stiffness of the adventitial layer. The venous volume is increased by over 250% as a result of an increase in the venous transmural pressure from 0 to 15 mmHg (3). The veins of the lower limb are influenced by gravity due to man’s erect posture. On standing, about 250 mls of venous blood fills the veins of each lower limb resulting in an increase in calf volume of about 2%. This leads to a fall in central venous pressure and, therefore, a transient fall in cardiac output. A new equilibrium between venous return and cardiac output is quickly achieved by reflex mechanisms. Pressure in the veins of the leg is\n\nPhysiology of the Veins and Lymphatics\n\n25\n\nIncrement in venous pressure due to gravity (mm Hg)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nFigure 2 The venous pressure in the lower limb on standing are attributable to the hydrostatic effects of a column of blood extending to the right atrium.

This is proportional to the weight of the column of blood extending from the right atrium to the level at which pressure is being measured. Ph ZKrgh where r is the density of blood, g is the gravitational acceleration constant and h is the distance from the heart (Fig. 2). The same hydrostatic pressure is added to the arteries and as a result the pressure differential across the capillary bed remains the same in supine and standing positions. Flow is therefore maintained but at the price of a high venous pressure. A series of muscle pumps within the lower limb augments the return of venous blood and the action of these lowers venous pressure in the leg considerably. As a result, the pressure differential between arterial and venous limbs of the capillary bed increases, and blood flow increases dramatically.\n\nTHE VENOUS VALVES Valves are present in lower extremity veins and are bicuspid with a fine connective tissue skeleton and are extremely strong even though they are just a thin layer of collagen fibres covered with endothelium (4). The valve cusps are stronger and more elastic than the\n\n26\n\nSmith\n\nvein wall. The valve sinus is always wider than the vein above and below the cusps (5). The calf muscle pump in combination with functioning venous valves provides the force necessary to overcome venous compliance and hydrostatic pressure and promotes venous return in the upright position. There are more valves in the distal leg veins and they decrease in numbers proximally. The inferior vena cava and common iliac veins have no valves and 75% of external iliac veins have no valves, but only 25% of common femoral veins are valveless (6). Valves in the internal iliac systems are less frequent, occurring in about 7% of the population (7). It has been suggested that the lack of valves in the iliac and common femoral veins is the starting point for the development of a progressive descending valvular incompetence that causes varicose veins (8), although this hypothesis has largely been rejected in the light of more modern evidence. The valves in the axial veins ensure that blood flows from caudal to cephalad and from superficial to deep in the communicating veins of the calf with the exception of foot communicating veins where venous flow is from the deep veins in the muscles of the sole of the foot to the superficial veins on the dorsum (9,10). The valves close in response to cephalad to caudal blood flow and a reverse flow velocity of at least 30 cm/s appears to be required for venous valve closure (11).\n\nSUPERFICIAL VENOUS SYSTEM The lower extremity veins can be divided into three types: superficial, deep and perforating veins (Fig. 3). The superficial venous system lies above the investing fascial layer of the leg and thigh and consists of the long and short saphenous veins and their tributaries. These veins are not compressed by muscle contraction. The great saphenous vein (GSV) and small saphenous vein (SSV) are the major superficial veins, although each of these veins has numerous tributaries.\n\nCOMMUNICATING OR PERFORATING VEINS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LONG SAPHENOUS VEIN Numerous communications exist between the superficial and deep veins. Some of these have eponymous names such as the Cockett medial calf perforating veins, Boyd’s perforating vein lying just below the knee, and the Hunter perforating vein in the mid-thigh region. The purpose of these veins is to drain blood from the superficial venous system into the deep veins of the lower limb. Some perforating veins contain valves, but many travel an oblique track through the fascia of the limb resulting in a functional valve which prevents outward flow of blood during normal muscle activity.\n\nDEEP VENOUS SYSTEM The deep veins lie beneath the fascial covering and are subject to compressive forces when the muscles of the limb contract. Most venous return from the lower extremities flows though the deep veins. In the calf the major axial veins are accompanied by pairs of venae comitantes. The veins accompanying the posterior tibial and peroneal veins are especially large (up to 10 mm in diameter in male subjects) and participate in the pumping mechanism that returns blood from the leg. In addition, the medial and lateral heads of gastrocnemius and soleus also contain pairs of veins accompanying the major arteries\n\nPhysiology of the Veins and Lymphatics\n\n27\n\nSuperficial circumflex iliac vein Femoral vein\n\nMedial vein of thigh\n\nAntero-lateral vein of thigh Mid thigh perforators (DODD)\n\nLong saphenous vein Popliteal vein\n\nGastrocnemius perforator (BOYD)\n\nAnterior vein of leg\n\nPosterior arch vein\n\nIII Lower leg perforators II (COCKETT) I Ankle perforators (MAY or KUSTER)\n\nFigure 3\n\nThe deep and superficial veins of the lower limb. (See color insert.)\n\nto these muscles. These are also often of large diameter and participate in the calf muscle pump. The calf veins empty into the popliteal vein which is often duplicated. Flow from the popliteal vein returns via the femoral vein in the thigh. The muscles of the thigh are drained via the deep femoral vein which joins the femoral vein to form the common femoral vein in the inguinal triangle. This is joined by the GSV and is the major route of venous drainage from the lower limb.\n\nNORMAL VENOUS PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LOWER LIMBS There are many factors that influence the return of blood from the lower extremities to the heart and the relative importance of each factor varies with body position and activity.\n\nIn the Supine Position When the subject is in the supine position, the respiratory cycle plays an important part in the venous return from the lower extremities. The foot vein pressure in the supine position is approximately 15 mmHg. The right atrial pressure is normally between 0 and 2 mmHg so the venous return to the heart in the supine position is generated by a pressure gradient\n\n28\n\nSmith\n\nof 13–15 mmHg. During inspiration, the volume of the veins of the thorax increases and the pressure decreases in response to reduced intrathoracic pressure (12,13). Expiration leads to the opposite effect, with decreased venous volume and increased pressure. The venous response to respiration is reversed in the abdomen, where the pressure increases during inspiration because of the descent of the diaphragm, and decreases during expiration as the diaphragm ascends. Increased abdominal pressure during inspiration decreases pressure gradients between peripheral veins in the lower extremities and the abdomen, thus reducing flow in the peripheral vessels (14). During expiration, when intraabdominal pressure is reduced, the pressure gradient from the lower limbs to the abdomen is increased and the flow in the peripheral veins rises correspondingly. The respiratory effects are usually associated with clear phasic changes in venous flow in the extremities. These can be detected by various instruments, including many forms of plethysmography and Doppler flow detectors. The respiratory changes in venous velocity may be exaggerated by respiratory manoeuvres, such as the Valsalva manoeuvre, which increases intra-thoracic and abdominal pressures and decreases, abolishes, or even reverses flow in some peripheral veins.\n\nFrom the Supine to the Upright Position When the subject moves from the supine position to the upright position, the influence of the respiratory cycle changes and the effect on the venous blood flow patterns has been demonstrated in the common femoral vein using duplex ultrasonography with simultaneously recordings of the cardiac and respiratory cycles using an electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor and a respiratory monitor (2). The subject was placed in the non weightbearing supine position and on a tilt table and gradually moved until fully upright. At minus 10 degrees head down, the weight of the abdominal viscera presses on the diaphragm and this is sufficient to counteract the descent of the diaphragm during inspiration. In this position, the outward movement of the chest wall generates the negative intra-thoracic pressure that is required for inspiration with little change in the intra-abdominal pressure. The venous blood flow patterns were shown to be primarily dependent upon the cardiac cycle but virtually independent of the respiratory cycle. Blood leaving the legs essentially flows downhill into the passively dilating right atrium until it is stopped by the onset of the cardiac contraction. As the subject becomes more upright, the influence of the cardiac cycle on the venous return rapidly diminishes as the respiratory cycle becomes more important. It has been shown in the study above that with the subject in the non weightbearing and 30 degree head-up position on a tilt table, the respiratory monitor indicated presence of flow in the common femoral vein during expiration and flow ceased with normal inspiratory effort.\n\nIn the Fully Upright Position In the upright position, the column of blood between the level of the manubrium sterni, the point used as the zero reference for the pressure measurement, and the foot exerts a gravitational force known as the hydrostatic pressure. The pressure in the foot vein then becomes 15 mmHg plus the hydrostatic pressure (Fig. 1). In this position, the expiratory promotion of venous flow is not enough to overcome the gravitational hydrostatic forces and promote adequate venous return. The contraction of the calf muscles is required to overcome this gravitational forces and promote venous return.\n\nPhysiology of the Veins and Lymphatics\n\n29\n\nTHE RETURN OF BLOOD TO THE HEART Blood returning from the lower extremity must flow against the forces of gravity to return to the right atrium. The foot vein pressure in the supine position is about 100 mmHg, so in order for blood to return from the foot, it has to reach this pressure to ensure adequate return. Since the vascular system is a closed series of tubes, the return pressure on the venous side is balanced by an equal hydrostatic arterial pressure supplying the limb. The pumping force of the heart results in the blood leaving the capillary system having a small residual pressure of 15–20 mmHg. This is sufficient to ensure venous return whether in the supine or erect position. In the supine position, the venous return takes place at the expense of a high venous pressure in the extremity. A highly specialised pumping mechanism has been evolved to actively pump venous blood back to the heart from the lower limb. It is thought that the principal participants in the pumping mechanism are the calf veins, gastrocnemius and soleus, within the calf muscles. Failure of this system results in symptoms ranging from varicose veins to severe ulceration of the lower limb.\n\nTHE CALF MUSCLE PUMP It is thought that the principal participants in the pumping mechanism are the veins of the calf within the calf muscles, gastrocnemius and soleus. These contain as much as 250 ml of blood (15). Additional muscle pumps are also recognized in the thigh and foot (9,16). The latter has a much smaller capacity (about 25 ml), but assists in the return of blood from the foot. It may have a “pump priming” effect on the calf muscle pump. The calf pump is often referred to as the peripheral heart. Venous flow is also dependent upon the contractile force of the heart, static filling pressure and gravity. During calf contraction, the pressure within the deep fascia becomes raised to as much as 250 mmHg resulting in all the intramuscular veins becoming completely compressed (Fig. 4). Blood that was present in these veins is emptied into the outflow tract, the first part of which is the popliteal vein. The large veins within the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles form the main chamber of the pump but the venae comitantes of the posterior tibial and peroneal veins and all other deep veins participate (16). Distal deep venous valves prevent axial reflux and functional or physiological valves in the communicating veins prevent reflux from the deep venous system to the superficial venous system (17). With continuous exercise, the calf blood volume is reduced by 1.5–2.0 ml/100 ml mainly as a result of the compression of the veins in the pump chamber and the average expelled volume is approximately 100–120 ml, that is, about 50% of all the blood within the pump. The pump will normally expel this volume in four or five contractions though one single sustained contraction can expel as much. The popliteal vein is a large bore vein which offers virtually no resistance to outflow. As the gradient of 10–15 mmHg between the small veins and the heart is sufficient to ensure venous blood flow in the supine position, the increase in gradient produced by the calf muscle pump during contraction is more than enough to ensure an adequate rapid venous return to the heart during vigorous erect muscle exercise. As the calf muscles relax, valves cephalad to the muscle pump close and prevent reflux of blood from more proximally in the axial veins. The pressure within the muscle fascia falls to low levels. The valves in the communicating veins open and allow normal blood flow from the superficial to the deep venous system. In addition, arterial inflow from the lower extremity capillary beds re-primes the calf muscle pump for a subsequent\n\n30\n\nSmith\n\ncontraction. At the moment when the calf muscles relax, their contained veins are empty, at low pressure and as yet unfilled by arterial inflow. As the veins are collapsed, they are unaffected by hydrostatic pressure. On the other hand, the superficial veins are full and subjected to hydrostatic pressure plus the remnant of cardiac generated pressure, the “vis a tergo.” The pressure gradient between the two compartments becomes 100–110 mmHg resulting in blood immediately flowing from the superficial to the deep compartment through the many communicating veins (18). This empties the superficial compartment and reduces its pressure (19). Therefore, the function of the calf muscle pump is vital in ensuring venous return from the lower limbs during exercise and the reduction of the superficial venous pressure, thus removing the damaging effects of the hydrostatic pressure ever present as a result of man’s upright posture. The effectiveness of the calf muscle pump can be investigated by air plethysmography and ambulatory venous pressure measurement technique which measures deep venous pressure directly by placing a needle in a dorsal foot vein and connecting it to a standard pressure transducer and a recording device during rest and exercise.\n\nREST\n\nEXERCISE\n\n100\n\n30\n\n30\n\nUpper femoral vein\n\n0 40 140\n\nmm.

The most commonly affected structure is the venous valve. In varicose veins the valves of the superficial veins spontaneously become incompetent permitting reverse flow in the GSV, SSV and their tributaries. This does not normally cause any problem since the pumping capacity of the muscle pumps can usually compensate for incompetent superficial veins. Should the superficial veins become very dilated then the volume of venous reflux may be considerable resulting in ankle edema, skin changes or even leg ulceration. The valves of the deep veins may also be damaged, most commonly as a consequence of deep vein thrombosis. In some patients spontaneous incompetence of the deep vein valves may occur. Veins may also become temporarily or permanently occluded by venous thrombosis. In the major axial veins this results in considerable disturbance of normal flow with large collateral channels of venous drainage developing. The pressure in the lower limb remains permanently elevated and edema is a common clinical problem in these patients.\n\nVALVULAR REFLUX OR RETROGRADE FLOW Venous reflux is the flow of blood in the opposite direction from physiological flow. This reflux may be natural, physiological or pathological. The duration of the reflux flow depends on the physiological or pathological state of the valvular apparatus. There have been studies (20) to show that the duration of reflux in the deep venous trunks in normal subjects was less than 0.5 sec in 95% of subjects scanned. Other studies (21,22) have also shown that reflux is significant if the duration of the retrograde flow within the veins exceeds 0.5 sec. Although it is not necessarily correlated to the development of varicose disease, this minimum duration of 0.5 sec does seem to be universally recognised as indicative of pathological reflux (23–25). Kistner proposed a classification of deep vein reflux according to the level of descent of radiological contrast medium, during descending venography (26). He defined four classes in increasing order of severity, with class 1 corresponding to reflux descending to mid-thigh, class 2 corresponding to reflux descending to the knee, class 3 corresponding to reflux descending to the mid-calf and class 4 corresponding to reflux descending to the ankle. There are several ways of eliciting reflux flow in the lower limb venous system, and the most effective ones include manual compression of the calf by means of a cuff. Compression with the cuff placed on the calf and inflated to 120 mmHg and then rapidly deflated, thus mobilizing the blood from the superficial and deep veins, is the method that is easy to reproduce systematically since automatic cuffs that can inflate and deflate rapidly are available. The accurate quantification of venous reflux in individual veins has not yet been fully established. Several methods of quantifying venous reflux in individual veins have been described using duplex scanning. These include measurements of valve closure time (27), venous reflux index or the Doppler efficiency index (EId) (28), velocity at peak reflux, and quantitative volume flow measurements by calculating the cross-sectional area of the vessel and the time-averaged velocity.\n\n32\n\nSmith\n\nEDEMA Starling Forces and How Edema Is Formed Edema is described as a perceptible expansion of the interstitial fluid volume. While the clinical importance of edema is usually that of its underlying cause, the accumulation of edema fluid and elevation of tissue pressure may directly interfere with various physiological activities. Most of the fluid that enters the tissue space by ultrafiltration from the arterial end of the capillary bed is absorbed back into the circulation at the venous end of that network (Fig. 5). Ernest Starling, in 1896, described interstitial fluid formation and absorption in terms of the pressure gradients acting across the capillary endothelium, the surface area available for fluid transfer and the permeability of the capillary membrane to protein. The direct and immediate causes of edema are alterations in the Starling forces that lead to an increase in the capillary-absorption ratio and a decrease in lymphatic drainage. In the capillary circulation the capillary endothelium is slightly permeable to plasma proteins allowing a small amount to enter the interstitial space. In general, there is little protein in extracellular fluid compared to blood and the colloid osmotic pressure due to the plasma proteins (which amounts to about 25 mmHg) favors reabsorption of fluid into the capillaries. At the arterial end of the capillary bed the capillary pressure may be as high as 50 mmHg. This would favor egress of water into the tissues, since this exceeds, the colloid osmotic pressure. Near the venous end of the capillary, when the pressure is 15 mmHg, the osmotic pressure is higher than the capillary pressure and fluid is reabsorbed by the capillary. This situation is summarized by Fig. 5. It must be recognized that this diagram is a considerable simplification of what actually happens in the capillary network but it depicts the net consequences of many complex events. Edema is observed in a wide variety of diseases in which one or more of the Starling forces are modified by the disease process. In most cases, there is a complex interaction among the factors that control transcapillary fluid exchange and interstitial volume. A simple example of edema is the orthostatic edema that occurs in the dependent parts of the body. In this case, gravity acts to impair venous return resulting in increased capillary filtration rate as a result of increased capillary volume and capillary pressure. The single affected element of the system is the capillary pressure. Any procedure that will facilitate Starling equilibrium\n\nArteriolar inflow 50 mm Hg\n\nVenular outflow\n\nFluid\n\nFluid reabsorption\n\nFigure 5\n\nDiagrammatic representation of the Starling equilibrium.\n\nPhysiology of the Veins and Lymphatics\n\n33\n\nvenous return, such as muscle activity or compression stockings, will alleviate the condition. It is clear from this consideration that if capillary pressure was allowed to rise to that of the potential hydrostatic pressure in the veins at the ankle, considerable edema would develop. The need for an efficient pumping system which maintains a low pressure in the superficial veins of the leg becomes obvious. In lower limb chronic venous insufficiency, edema may occur as a result of increased capillary pressure, secondary to an elevation in venous pressure due to venous obstruction, or increased venous hypertension due to valvular incompetence. Other causes of clinical edema include pregnancy, congestive heart failure, and renal or hepatic insufficiency. Edema may also occur in inflammatory conditions of any type since these tend to increase the amount of protein escaping into the tissues. This reduces the difference in colloid osmotic pressure between the interstitial fluid and the capillaries favoring the development of edema. Plasma proteins that escape into the interstitial fluid cannot be reabsorbed by the capillaries since there is no active mechanism to achieve this. In order to prevent a steady rise in interstitial protein levels, these must be removed continuously. Failure to do this would result in the development of edema as the osmotic pressure rose in the interstitial fluids. The lymphatic system is responsible for removing plasma proteins from the interstitial fluid. The volumetric flow in these vessels is very small in comparison to the arterial inflow. For example, at rest the flow of blood to the lower limbs is about 1 L per minute whereas the total flow of lymph returning via the thoracic duct is 100 mL per hour. This small volume of f"
