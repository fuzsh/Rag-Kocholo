        "text": "2017 Steven Culp confirmed that in 2011 he filmed a series of commercials for AT&T. They were shown in select markets on the East Coast and the Midwest. If one of them aired in your area and you recorded it by any chance, I would greatly appreciate it if you forward a copy. Oct 8, 2017\n\nAs previously announced, Steven Culp will appear on an episode of \"The Orville\"\n\nThe episode will be shown on Oct 26, 2017 on FOX.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nED AND THE CREW FACE THE MAJORITY ON AN ALL-NEW \"THE ORVILLE\" THURSDAY, OCTOBER 26, ON FOX\n\nWhen two Union anthropologists go missing on a planet similar to 21st century Earth, Ed sends a team led by Kelly to find them, but the mission quickly goes awry when they realize the society's government is completely based on a public voting system to determine punishment in the all-new \"Majority Rule\" episode of THE ORVILLE airing Thursday, Oct. 26 (9:01-10:00 PM ET) on FOX. (ORV-107) (TV-14 D, L, V)\n\nCast: Seth MacFarlane as Captain Ed Mercer; Adrianne Palicki as Commander Kelly Grayson; Penny Johnson Jerald as Dr. Claire Finn; Scott Grimes as Lieutenant Gordon Malloy; Peter Macon as Lieutenant Commander Bortus; Halston Sage as Chief Security Officer Alara Kitan; J Lee as Lieutenant John Lamarr; Mark Jackson as Isaac\n\nGuest Cast: Ron Canada as Admiral Tucker, Giorgia Whigham as Lysella, Loren Lester as Lewis, Barry Livingston as Tom, *Steven Culp as Willks*\n\nOct 30, 2017 edited to add:\n\n(October 27, 2017, variety.com, by Joe Otterson)\n\nFox sci-fi series \"The Orville\" is currently up in both measures in the Thursday overnight ratings, drawing its best numbers since its second episode.\n\nAccording to Nielsen data, \"The Orville\" averaged a 1.2 rating on adults 18-49 and 4.2 million viewers, up by over 20 percent in both measures compared to its last original episode two weeks ago. That is also the third-highest night on record for the freshman series, with the next highest being Episode 2, which drew a 2.2 and 6.6 million viewers.\n\nSep 12, 2017\n\nAs previously announced, Steven was scheduled to attend the \"Not So Desperate Convention\" in Paris, France, next year.\n\nUnfortunately, the convention was cancelled today... :-(\n\nSource: facebook.com/ASCEvents/ - Sep 12, 2017\n\nHello,\n\nWe are coming to you today for a difficult announcement, we have spent a lot of time looking for solutions, but it is with a heavy heart that we announce the cancellation of our two conventions \"Not So Desperate\" and \"Amazing Surgeon Conventions \".\n\nFirst of all, we would like to say that we would never have taken the risk of announcing such events if we did not have serious, solid and positive feedback on the presence of actors to these conventions.\n\nUnfortunately, we had tough obstacles to overcome for our two conventions. Since our last announcement we have done everything to keep the conventions alive, we fought but the exchanges with the agents became more difficult. The agents decided unilaterally to revisit the negotiations, and it was impossible for us to follow these new negotiations without you suffering from the tariffs.\n\n[...]\n\nThe association ASC Events does not close its doors, we did not say our last word. We learn from the obstacles that have stood in our way, and we will emerge stronger for our future projects.

Mai 2015 um 22.50 Uhr bei RTL Nitro ausgestrahlt.\n\nNachdem die Leiche der jungen Grafikdesignerin Kim Lee gefunden wird und von ihrem Freund Derrick Joyner jede Spur fehlt, gehen die Detectives Winters und Jaruszalski von einer Beziehungstat aus. Die Ermittler geben unverzüglich eine Fahndung nach dem jungen Mann heraus, doch niemand will ihn gesehen haben. Die einzigen Indizien sind Derricks Wagen, der in der Nähe des Bahnhofs geparkt wurde und ein auf seinen Namen gebuchtes Zugticket nach San Diego. Für Winters und Jaruszalski ist klar, dass sich Derrick nach der Tat abgesetzt hat, bis die Festnahme eines Mannes, der mit Derricks Kreditkarte gezahlt hat, eine entscheidende Wende in den Fall bringt: Dieser sagt aus, Derricks Portemonnaie samt Karten und Bargeld in einem Mülleimer gefunden zu haben. Diese Aussage lässt bei den Detectives erste Zweifel aufkommen und nur wenig später bestätigen sich ihre Bedenken, als sie Derricks Leiche unter seinem Haus finden. Der Täter muss sie dort absichtlich platziert haben, um alles nach einer Beziehungstat aussehen zu lassen. Als Winters und Jaruszalski im Umfeld der Opfer ermitteln, stoßen sie auf Roland Davidson, einen Arbeitskollegen von Derrick, der am Tattag mit Derrick in Streit geraten ist. Obwohl der Verdächtige aussagt, niemals im Haus des Paares gewesen zu sein, können seine Fingerabdrücke auf Kims Schmuckkästchen sichergestellt werden, sodass er unverzüglich verhaftet wird. Doch welches Motiv hatte Roland überhaupt und worum ging es in dem Streit zwischen den beiden Männern?

Jul 25, 2012 Unfortunately it happened again :-((\n\nI just found out that Steven appeared on the A&E serie \"Longmire\" last Sunday (July 22, 2012).

The actor's voice was familiar, and I had to see the commercial a few times to convince myself it's him. It's the commercial where the wife is talking to the phone company, daughter rushes in to say she's been accepted at Juilliard, and wife then asks about bundling services, while daughter and hubby (Culp) are in the background. His hair is different in more ways than one -- longer, and gray!\"\n\nAfter reading that message I tried to find a video online and was looking at every AT&T commercial I could find, but had no luck.\n\nNow I read a new entry on my Facebook page \"a friend in the U.S. Midwest has told me that Mr. Culp is currently appearing in a series of television commercials for AT&T UVerse. I think it might be a regional thing, because I haven't seen the ads yet in the New York City area.\"\n\nI tried to find a video clip online again, but could not find one.\n\nIf anyone who reads this knows where I can find one, please let me know. If anyone is able to record the commercial, please do so and let me know. I'd love to see it.
