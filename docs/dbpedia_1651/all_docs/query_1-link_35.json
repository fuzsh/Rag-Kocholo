This panel will debate why this question strikes such a nerve with scholars, fans, and readers. Why is it so important to find the first scholar, and does that tell us something about why comics studies started in the first place?\n\nThursday July 9, 2015 10:30am – 11:30am\n\nRoom 26AB\n\nTags Comics, Comics Arts Conference\n\n10:30am\n\nHow to Get News Coverage\n\nSmall press publishers: What makes the difference between an item that will get news coverage, previews, and interviews and what doesn't?

Comic Book Law School is designed to help you navigate the best possible route and provide help in deciphering the map legend. Noted IP attorney Michael Lovitz, author of The Trademark and Copyright Book comic book, presents the first of three fun, interactive, and informative programs, which this year will progressively study the case of fictional client Fitzgerald Scott, a fledgling comic book writer, and explore the many stages involved in the creation, development, protection, and commercialization of his newest comic book creation, The Strange Situation of Benjamin \"Button\" Cabeza. This first installment focuses on \"The Basics,\" in an effort to provide the necessary foundation needed for understanding the different intellectual property rights available to creators and business owners; and will include insights on how to protect those rights, focusing on how best to safeguard ideas, creative works, characters, brands and names, from conception through publication. Attendees are invited to participate in an interactive discussion about rights provided under U.S. copyright and trademark laws, including a discussion on the protections these laws provide, the benefits of federal registrations, tips on working with collaborators, and issues of joint authorship and work-made-for-hire. Along the way, there will be plenty to learn about the protections available, as well as the numerous potential pitfalls, under the U.S. trademark and copyright systems. [Please note that Comic Book Law School seminars are designed to provide relevant information and insights to practicing attorneys, as well as practical tips to creators and other professionals who may wish to attend.

Superman: Dawn of Justice), Trina Robbins ( Pretty in Ink: American Women Cartoonists 1896-2013),Karen Green (Columbia University), Jared Gardner (Ohio State University), and moderator Danny Fingeroth (Disguised as Clark Kent: Jews, Comics and the Creation of the Superhero) discuss the two major phases of Will Eisner's career. Beginning with the 1940 creation of his iconic character the Spirit, used by Eisner to tell stories of sophistication and depth, the discussion will then shift to his 1970s reinvention of comics, catalyzing the literary comics movement with A Contract with God, the first of many graphic novels he'd create. While The Spirit is by no means forgotten, it wrestles for primacy regarding what Eisner's more important achievements were. Academia tends to focus on his personal work of the '70s and beyond. This focus overlooks, perhaps due to The Spirit's action-adventure milieu, the fact that in the feature Eisner told stories with great personal meaning, a harbinger of the rich work to come. Today, we celebrate the innovations of 23-year-old Eisner, explore what makes the Spirit important, and trace Eisner's evolving interests, from action-adventure to memoir and social commentary.\n\nThursday July 9, 2015 2:30pm – 3:30pm\n\nRoom 26AB\n\nTags Comic-Con Special Guest Spotlights & Appearances, Comics Arts Conference, Seminars & Workshops\n\n2:30pm\n\nComiXology: Ask Me Anything\n\nComiXology, the revolutionary cloud-based digital comics platform, spills the beans on everything you've ever wanted to know about digital comics, publishing, life, and more.
