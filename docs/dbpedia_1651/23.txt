I LOVE Eleventh Hour. This is, in fact, the only CBS show that I actually watch. Before Eleventh Hour came on, I always referred to CBS as the "CSI Channel". I'm also not into reality TV. BUT THEN CAME DR. HOOD! Eleventh Hour is SMART! It's engaging. It shows genuine human concern and compassion. It grapples with the very real possibilities of when science and technology go too far and what that means. IT MAKES YOU THINK! I have always thought Rufus Sewell was an excellent actor, and he has been a joy and pleasure to follow in this series. The chemistry between him and Rachel, and now Felix, is AWESOME. I DVR'd every episode so I wouldn't have to sit through commercials--I hated breaking up the story with ads, I was always on the edge of my seat. I'd very much like to see some reruns of Season 1 this summer and am definitely planning on getting the first season on DVD when it's available. This show has great potential for several continuing seasons. I'm eagerly (and slightly impatiently) waiting for the fall so that I can see new episodes of Eleventh Hour and Dr. Hood.
