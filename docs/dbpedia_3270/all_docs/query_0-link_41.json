        "text": "I run this blog for two main reasons. First, in order to publish my Team of the Season selections. This is an ongoing project. I post a new Team of the Season after the end of every football season (usually shortly after the UEFA Champions League final). The second big project that makes up a significant part of the content posted on this blog is the Teams of the Decade project. I watched my way through male football history and compiled what I thought was the best XI for every decade. In order not to discriminate against players who reached their peak around the turn of a decade (say, 1978-1982), the project progressed in overlapping five year steps. So for example, the 1970-1980 Team of the Decade was followed by the 1965-1975 Team of the Decade. This second project was completed in 2017. Working my way back in time, I reached the 1950s which is the first decade for which enough footage of classic football matches exist in order for me to form my own opinion on the top players of the period in question. The project finished with a post about what I consider to be the Best XI in Football History and one about the Best Player. After having finished the 1950-1960 Team of the Decade there were simply no more decades in football history to write about.\n\nUntil now, that is. We have reached the end of another decade in football history: the 2010-2020 decade. I therefore finally have the opportunity to compile another Team of the Decade. Compiling this selection has been fundamentally different from choosing the players for all other Teams. Since I started watching football in earnest in 2008, the 2010-2020 decade was the first that I witnessed in real time and more or less completely. “More or less completely” means that I watched more than a 1,000 matches this decade and most of the ones that are important for the purposes of this blog post. Of course, I could not, and did not, watch everything and not even every important match. But I feel confident in saying that I watched enough to form an educated opinion.\n\nFurthermore, the Team of the Season selections that I made during the last ten years come in handy now. They support my memory and help to prevent the worst effects of recency or nostalgia bias. One thing I could have done is to simply deduce the Team of the Decade from the Team of the Season selections: ascribe points for being named Player of the Season, member of the first XI, and being placed on the bench and choose the eleven players with the highest total score (or the players with the highest score for each position). I did not do that. Or, more precisely, I did do that but decided against using this method to determine my overall selection. Here is the reason why: the Teams of the Season are only an imperfect way to measure the thing I want to base my Team of the Decade selection on. Sometimes a player is named in the first eleven not because he had a particularly outstanding season but simply because he was the best in a rather mediocre competition for a particular spot. And sometimes a player plays a marvellous season and yet hardly makes the bench because so many others in his position did so as well. Simply assigning scores and basing the Team of the Decade solely upon them therefore risks missing out on much valuable information. The team would be (or at least, could be) worse for it. Hence my Team of the Season selections heavily support me in choosing a Team of the Decade – but they do not determine my selections in any straightforward way.\n\nHaving said that, awarding points for being named in a Team of the Season and finding out who has won the most points over the course of the decade is fun anyway. This is why I did that, too, but without basing my final selection on it. I used the following system for awarding points:\n\nPlayer of the Season: 8 Points\n\nXI of the Season: 4 Points\n\nBench Team of the Season: 2 Points\n\nPlayer of the Tournament: 6 Points\n\nXI of the Tournament: 3 Points\n\nBench Team of the Tournament: 1 Point\n\nEuropean players have a bit of an advantage because I compile a Team of the Tournament for the Euros but not for other continental trophies. However, performances in other continental trophies like the Copa America are part of the basis for my Team of the Season selections and thus non-European players have a slight advantage there.\n\nWith that out of the way, let us turn to the team itself: inclusion in the team is based solely on quantity and quality of performance during the respective period of time. It’s not about whether a player has won a lot of trophies, or fits some artistic ideal, even whether a player was ahead of his time in itself isn’t a criterion. It’s about performance and performance alone. You don’t necessarily have to get top marks for both quantity and quality of performance to be included. If the quality of your performances was outstanding, you have a chance to be included even if, for example, you only performed on that level for, say, 5 of the 10 years. But the lack of quantity of performance will speak against you. Also, the chances of any given player to be included, of course, heavily depend on the quality and quantity of performance of other players who played in the same position during the same period of time. This is all still a bit vague, but since fantasy football teams are far from being exact science to begin with, I think that’s okay. The main point that I want to emphasize simply is, that both quantity and quality of performance matter. I define the 2010-2020 decade as starting with the final whistle of the 2010 Champions League final and ending with the final whistle of the 2020 Champions League final.\n\nHere is the team:\n\nManager: Pep Guardiola\n\nBench (3 players per starter): de Gea, Courtois, Buffon; Alaba, Alba, F. Luis; Bonucci, S. Ramos, Chiellini, Pique, Boateng, Varane; Carvajal, D. Alves, Walker; Kanté, Thiago A., Y. Touré; Iniesta, A. Vidal, D. Silva; De Bruyne, di Maria, Özil; Neymar, Hazard, Griezmann; Suarez, Benzema, Agüero; Robben, T. Müller, Bale\n\nBest Player: Lionel Messi\n\nBest Team: FC Barcelona 2010-12\n\nBest Club: Real Madrid\n\nBest Match: FC Barcelona – Real Madrid 5-0, 29.11.2010\n\nManuel Neuer\n\nOverall Score: 31 (6+(4×4)+3+(2×2)+(2×1))\n\nWas this one of the more difficult decisions? Good question. I have in fact just declared goalkeeper to be one of the harder positions on Twitter before writing these lines, only for Bayern-Blogger Justin Kraft to object that it really shouldn’t be. I think he might have a point. I always thought of goalkeeper as a two-horse race between de Gea and Neuer – in which the latter ultimately gets the edge. But looking back at my selections, maybe the case in Neuer’s favor was clearer than I thought it was. Neuer makes the Team of the Season first XI four times between 2010 and 2017; de Gea only twice, both in the second half of the decade. And then there are Neuer’s tournament exploits. He at least made the bench in every tournament he participated in between 2010 and 2016. Oh, and Neuer won Player of the Tournament in 2014. But more on that a little later. So maybe goalkeeper is a position that is better described as ‘more than one worthy candidate but one quite a bit more worthy than the rest’. Yeah, I think that is about right.\n\nManuel Neuer. Where to begin? Perhaps with the big statement: I think Manuel Neuer is at least on the outer edges of the greatest goalkeeper of all time debate. He is that good. As late as 2016 I thought he might even be on a trajectory to claim the top spot for himself without having to face too much contradiction. The last couple of seasons were a bit too shaky to remain on that course, but he still has a couple of years left for a golden autumn to his career (the greatest goalkeepers have often performed at the highest level well into their late 30s). His historical status is neatly mirrored on these pages because this is not the first Team of the Decade he stars in. He was also my first choice for the 2005-15 Team. That decision certainly was a tough one because Neuer only really hit the heights after 2010, but in the end I found choosing him to be justified and stand by that decision. But let me just say that making two consecutive Teams of the Decade is, while not unwarranted, a bit flattering to him.\n\nFor the first half of the decade Manuel Neuer was the uncontested incumbent for the title ‘most progressive world class keeper’. I highlighted his “revolutionary” style in my portrait on him for the 2005-15 Team. His ability with the ball, the way he frequently left his penalty box to intercept through balls and his superhuman ability to throw (!) the ball way into midfield were basically unheard of in world football. By now we can say that Neuer was a successful revolutionary insofar that other goalkeepers modeled their game after him and he no longer is as unique as he used to be. At the time of writing these words, players like ter Stegen and Ederson have arguably overtaken him in at least some of the ways goalkeeping is considered to be ‘modern’ (Bayern have also become a more conservative team, using his sweeper abilities less).\n\nBut whether any of his successors have yet reached the overall level that Neuer had at his peak is a different question altogether. Because Neuer was not only a trailblazer, but the complete goalkeeper. At his best his game was without weaknesses and, what is more, one was hard-pressed to name any regard in which he wasn’t outstanding. I’m not sure there has been a goalkeeper since Yashin for which this was true for an extended period of time (which further strengthens the case for Neuer belonging to the historical elite). For Neuer also excels at the ‘basics’ of goalkeeping: he is great at stopping shots both from short and long range. He is also one of the best keepers in 1vs1 situations that I have ever seen. I’m guessing the textbook on how to handle these situations is actually just a collection of Neuer clips. He has the perfect physique for a goalkeeper: tall, imposing, yet flexible and agile. Perfect, simply perfect.\n\nSpeaking about perfect: the 2014 World Cup. As I wrote at the time, that world cup contained exactly one aggregate performance that transcended the world class level and for once it wasn’t Messi’s. Manuel Neuer produced a tournament for the ages including legendary performances against France, Brazil (although Germany would have arguably won that one anyway) and perhaps most famously against Algeria. I compared that performance with Maradona’s greatest exploits (minus the cheating) in 1986. It could take decades until this game is no longer the ultimate sweeper keeper performance. You should definitely check out the highlights if you don’t know them already. Also, if you want to see Neuer excel at more traditional goalkeeping, this Man of the Match performance against Real Madrid in 2017 is a good choice (THAT save against Ronaldo!).\n\nAs I said earlier, some of the later seasons of the decade weren’t Neuer’s finest. He had injury problems and took some time to reach anything resembling his old level. But towards the very end of the decade he yet again became a world class player. By then, however, he had already done enough to secure the place in the team and his closest pursuer, de Gea, had some problems of his own anyway. So in the end, Manuel Neuer makes the Team of the Decade for a second consecutive time. Well earned, I’d say.\n\nMarcelo\n\nOverall Score: 16 ((3×4)+(2×2))\n\nBrazil might be more famous for its seemingly endless supply of fine attacking players, but it seems fair to say that football’s premier country has dominated the two fullback positions to an even greater degree. On the left it produced players like Nilton Santos and Roberto Carlos; on the right legends such as Djalma Santos, Carlos Alberto, Cafu, and Dani Alves. Marcelo is the last in line of these players and he is a worthy member of this exclusive club. In some respects I even deem him to be superior to the aforementioned players. Where any of them as technically gifted as Marcelo? One or two of them might come close but I don’t think any of them has a good shout at having noticeably superior technique than Marcelo. (Just look at the average quality of his goals!) Taking one step back, I don’t think Marcelo is one of the three best left-backs in the history of football, but I would disagree with anyone placing him outside of the Top 10. Hence we are talking about a player who in my opinion comes close to being within the all-time-legends category for his chosen position.\n\nWhat makes Marcelo stand out are his qualities with the ball. His defensive game isn’t as bad as it is sometimes made out to be, but he wouldn’t make this team, first eleven or bench, on defensive merits alone. That much is clear. With the ball at his feet, Marcelo is a fascinating type of player. Attacking fullbacks typically resemble wingers style-wise. They are good dribblers, deliver precise crosses, and have pace. And yes, Marcelo has at least some these characteristics. He even played as a winger for a period of time earlier in his Real Madrid career. Then there are attacking fullbacks who resemble central midfielders. Lahm is the ultimate example and Joshua Kimmich a recent one. And finally there are some offensive-minded fullbacks who share some characteristics of box-to-box midfielders. Think of Trent Alexander-Arnold or David Alaba (who actually plays as a box-to-box midfielder for Austria). But Marcelo ultimately belongs to a different category still. Yes, his game has elements of the typical winger, but the kind of player I am reminded of the most when I watch him play is a kind of old-school No. 10. South American style, that is. Rivelino in particular is a player I’m drawn to thinking about when watching Marcelo play. Marcelo has the technique of this kind of player, the poise, the knack for creating moments of magic, the inventiveness, even the shortcomings (he is not exactly the greatest athlete ever to set foot on a football field).\n\nMarcelo, in my opinion, had two breakthrough moments this decade. The first was the 2010-11 season in which he anounced himself as a player who is capable of being among the best in his position, without being truly outstanding. He wasn’t even a guaranteed starter during this period but this was only because Real had a second world class left-back in the form of Fabio Coentrao. The second breakthrough moment is a bit harder to pin down but it came somewhere around 2014. This was when he turned from being a regular cast member in the ensemble of world class players into the preeminent player in his position. He retained this position until ~2018. After that, his form took a considerable hit. He even lost his starting spot at Real Madrid – and not because the competition was that strong. He showed some signs of regained confidence in early 2020 but it’s not like I would bet money on Marcelo returning to his absolute best. His career at the very, very top seems over. Given the career he had and his age, this is nothing to be ashamed of. Not everyone is Gianluigi Buffon and remains world class way into his 30s.\n\nTo experience Marcelo at his best, I can recommend this masterclass performance against Bayern. It includes one of the greatest solo runs in his career and even some outstanding defensive action.\n\nMats Hummels\n\nOverall Score: 27 ((3×4)+(4×2)+(2×3)+1)\n\nCentre-back was tough. There are positions in this team where I struggled to find a single deserving player (*cough* right-back *cough*). And then there were positions where the thing that brought me headaches was the very fact that there were too many deserving players. And worse than that: they were roughly equally deserving! The two positions in central defense are the prime example for this nice-to-have problem. So here is a list of players who could have been worthy choices as starting central defenders in this team: Bonucci, Ramos, Chiellini, Pique, Boateng, and Varane. These are the players on the bench. Any one of them would not be out of place in the first eleven. Plus the same is arguably true for Pepe, who did not even manage to make the bench. I’d say that at least half of these players are more worthy of a place in the first team than Philipp Lahm, who actually did make it. (But see the section on Lahm for the reasons that speak against him; it’s not about a lack of quality.) So yes, centre-back was a tough decision because of the excess supply of very good candidates. As you know by now, I ended up choosing Mats Hummels and Thiago Silva. One of them, Thiago Silva, is a great alrounder without noticeable weaknesses while Hummels is a player who, I think, reigns supreme in some regards, which makes up for relative weaknesses in others.\n\nWhat makes Hummels so particularly outstanding? One and a half things, really. Or one big thing and one slightly smaller thing. The big thing is his playmaking ability. I rate the German as the best playmaker in defense since at least Franco Baresi, maybe even since Franz Beckenbauer himself. Hummels is an expert at finding and playing low passes into pockets of space in midfield where his teammates can continue the attacking move. (Good example.) He is also among the very best centre-backs at playing the final ball (together maybe with Leonardo Bonucci). He is adept both at playing high ball over the opponent’s defensive line and cutting the defense open with low passes between the defenders. In order to improve his passing options he frequently pushes up into midfield, thereby cleverly forcing the opponent to break formation. Every once in a while Hummels even does the full Beckenbauer and makes forays all the way into the attacking third, usually not to score himself but play a final pass in the manner of a No.10.\n\nThe second thing that makes him special is the peak quality of his defensive actions. Hummels frequently performs the best interceptions and the best tackles you are likely to find in modern football. If I knew that it takes something special to stop an attack and had to find a player to perform an extremely difficult to pull off tackle or a very hard to time interceptive movement, Hummels would be my pick. Good defending, for all its physicality and sometimes even brutality, often takes the precision of a surgeon and when he is on form no one is more precise in his defensive actions than Hummels. Because of this his defensive actions frequently result not only in a disrupted attack but in high-quality ball retrievals. Fitting to this focus on high-quality actions is the fact that he often steps out of defense to confront opposing strikers or even midfielders just when they receive the ball. This video shows you many of the defensive qualities just described.\n\nIf Hummels had played at his peak level for all of his career, there would be no doubt that he belongs in this team and I would classify him as one of the all-time great central defenders. That, however, wasn’t the case. There are two things worth noting here. First, Hummels had phases in his career where he played much worse than he can play. And, second, even when he was relatively close to his peak form, his high-risk high-reward way of playing resulted in major errors. Now, every defender makes mistakes but more conservative players like, for example, Diego Godin do make less of them than Hummels (which has its own price, of course). And if Hummels commits a mistake, he isn’t well equipped to immediately correct it because of his lack of acceleration. He basically has to get it right the first time. Most of the time he does, and at his best he almost always does, but there is a drawback to his preferred style of playing. So if you value basic reliability above all in a defender, Hummels is unlikely to be your choice. But if you think that the modern game makes it possible for a defender not to be among the very, very best in the “keep it safe, keep it simple” category but still be among the very, very best all things considered, than there is a strong case in Hummels’ favor. I endorse the latter view. The things he does well he does so well that he, in my opinion, has earned the place in the first eleven.\n\nThiago Silva\n\nOverall score: 24 (2×4+5×2+2×3)\n\nI will be honest with you. I had already written a portrait of Sergio Ramos. In fact, you can find it at the very end of this blogpost as a little peek in an alternative reality in which he makes the team. Now, why did I include Thiago Silva at the latest possible moment, only days before this blogpost goes online? He did play some additional games in the final stage of the 2019-20 Champions League and performed very well, but no, this is not why I picked him. Justifying my decision based on these few games would smell of recency bias. I picked him because I thought long and hard about my selections during the last decade and could not fail to notice that I consistently ranked Silva higher than Ramos. Ramos has frequently been my twelfth man. He made the bench for the 2011-12, 2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, and 2019-20 seasons, but never the first eleven. Now to elevate a player who was so consistently close to the first team in almost every year of the decade into the first eleven of the Team of the Decade can be perfectly justifiable. But Thiago Silva made the bench for the 2012-13, 2014-15, 2015-16, 2017-18, and 2019-20 seasons, which is quite impressive on its own, but even the first eleven of the 2011-12 and the 2013-14 team plus the first eleven of the 2014 and 2018 World Cups. He came mightily close to winning Player of the Tournament in the latter. So what I want to say is that Sergio Ramos and Thiago Silva, although quite different in playing style, both played decades at almost the same level. Silva narrowly wins it because I continue to think he is the slightly better player.\n\nThiago Silva is the last in line of the great Milan school of defending. The roots of his game can be traced back to Baresi, Costacurta, Maldini, and finally Nesta, the player he learned from in his years at Milan. In my profile on him for the 2018 World Cup I wrote that “what really catches the eye about Silva’s game is the utter cleanliness apparent in almost everything he does.” I also called him “a textbook on defending that came alive.” I still think these descriptions are quite apt. Hummels, and Ramos too, are eccentric centre backs insofar as their profile diverges from what might be considered the perfectly balanced modern centre back game. Hummels relies a bit too heavily on his anticipation and consequently makes decisions that are at least on the verge of being too risky. Ramos is arguably too physical and certainly at times too aggressive for his own good. Thiago Silva on the other hand is a good Aristotelian insofar as he firmly embodies the golden mean. If there is one adjective that described him perfectly, it is “composed”. Thiago Silva is a composed defender. He plays in a composed way. I have not seen a centre back this decade for which this description would be more fitting.\n\nThe game of the Brazilian skipper is thus less about crunching tackles or heroic acts at either end of the pitch, but about positioning, about organizing the defense (of which he is unquestionably the leader), about playing passes that are constructive and precise, yes, playmaking even, but rarely mind-boggling (he plays through one defensive line, not two, not zero, one). Given his composed nature it should go without saying that Silva excels under pressure. When others have long lost control, he still delivers the pass or finds the right moment to intercept. Unsurprisingly, ‘control’ is another word one associates with him.\n\nThiago Silva did not feature in my selections during the very early years of the decade but I think it is quite likely that this is down to me, not him. For example, he made the official Serie A Team of the Season in 2010-11, which to me is one of the more reputable awards in football. Hence I think he started the decade on a relatively high level – and never really looked back. The fact that his appearances in my selections are spread across the decade already tells you that he performed on a very consistent level. Even in 2019-20, when he ended the season at 35 years of age, he was still mightily close to making the first eleven.\n\nOne final word to end this profile: Thiago Silva features in the first eleven of my 2005-2015 Team of the Decade as well. Well, he does for now. He only really rose to prominence around 2010 and, as good as he was even back then, I now think that his breakthrough came too late to justify his inclusion in the first team. I’m slowly watching my way back in football history and when I reach the year 2005, I will present a new 2005-2015 Team of the Decade. (It might be that Thiago Silva will be the only change, hence “new” might be a bit over the top.) So I don’t think my final verdict will be that Thiago Silva features two times in a first eleven of a Team of the Decade. But he does feature in this one.\n\nPhilipp Lahm\n\nOverall Score: 29 ((4×4)+(2×2)+(3×3))\n\nPhilipp Lahm is one of the best full-backs of all time. In fact I named him as the starting right-back for my Team of Football History. Was giving him the place in this Team of the Decade therefore an easy decision? Not quite. Lahm retired in 2017. The end of his international career came even earlier, right after the victorious 2014 World Cup. Making the first eleven while playing only 7 out of 10 seasons is rather difficult. You basically have to perform on a historic level and face opposition that isn’t quite up to standard. Given the fact that you are currently reading a profile on Philipp Lahm, you will not be surprised to hear that I think this is exactly what happened.\n\nLahm was the outstanding right-back for 3/4 of the decade. His regular presence in the Team of the Season/Tournament selections underscore this point. At his best, Dani Alves reached a similar level but Alves’ form faded relatively early in the decade. 2010-11 was the last time he made the first eleven and 2011-12 was the last time he made the bench before regaining it one more time in the autumn of his career (2016-17). I’m not saying that Alves isn’t a player of historic calibre. He won a starting spot in the 2005-2015 Team of the Decade. Lahm still featured as a left-back back then. But Alves’ career was not as consistent as Lahm’s and certainly not as consistent within the period relevant for this selection. In fact, the greatest threat to Lahm’s position is someone else. Dani Carvajal is, in my opinion, the best right-back of the decade who actually ended the decade as an active player. He often made the bench, was the best regular right-back in 2014-15 (a season in which I fielded Robben as a right wing-back) and won a first team spot in 2016-17. Back then I was reasonably certain that Carvajal would go on to win a first XI place in this team. Lahm was about to retire, Dani Alves’ golden autumn came too late ( and wasn’t that golden), other contenders were far behind. The thing is, once Lahm retired, Carvajal’s form took a turn for the worse. He did not go on to become the dominant right-back for the rest of the decade. Players like Kimmich and Alexander-Arnold took over Lahm’s crown. Hence Carvajal’s claim for a first team spot turned out to be much weaker than I thought it would be. And the new kids on the block were simply too new to rival Lahm for quantity of performance. To cut a long story short: Lahm’s retirement didn’t cost him the starting spot. The man who already was a bench player for the 2000-2010 Team of the Decade wins a starting spot almost 20 years after he began playing professional football and three years after he retired.\n\nI have written about Lahm’s playing style quite a few times already and don’t want to catch myself repeating whole paragraphs. Therefore short and sweet: the Xavi of full-backs, highly intelligent player who dominates both with and without the ball, fantastic timing and anticipation when defending, playmaker when attacking, has at times played as a defensive midfielder when Guadiola managed Bayern, world class in that position too, unsurprisingly. Weaknesses: utterly incapable of playing badly. Okay, more honestly: given his stature there are obvious limitations when it comes to aerial duels and physical encounters. He isn’t exactly the second incarnation of Usain Bolt, either.\n\nThe quality of Philipp Lahm’s performances remained extremely stable for the first four years of the decade. He basically played the same upper-edge-of-world-class-category season time and time again. The same goes for his performance in tournaments. The 2014-15 season was the one in which he left the plateau of excellence that he had stayed on for many years. Despite his still youthful looks, Lahm, too, was getting older. I think it is fair to say that he never fully regained his very best performance level. Still, he remained among the very best right-backs in the world right until he retired, winning a starting spot in 2015-16 (against weak competition) and a place on the bench for his final season. As it turned out, that was enough to win a second starting spot in a Team of the Decade.\n\nSergio Busquets\n\nOverall Score: 42 ((3×8)+(2×4)+(4×2)+(2×1))\n\nSergio Busquets is in my opinion the third or maybe even second best player of the decade. He doesn’t come close to Messi’s level but he does rival Cristiano Ronaldo for the place just behind Messi. Maybe he doesn’t quite catch him, but there is far, far less between them quality-wise than most people think – I say, immediately admitting that comparisons between forwards and defensive midfielders will always be quite vague. In the end, it doesn’t really matter how far behind Ronaldo, if at all, Busquets is. The important point I want to make is that Busquets is one of the players in this team that stand out. He does have a place in the football pantheon. And I think he has a good shout of being the best ever in his position. In fact I rate him as the best defensive midfielder in football history, and that is mostly based on what he did between 2010 and 2020.\n\nBusquets is a technically accomplished player. He has an assured first touch, can do little dribbles even under heavy pressure, and has a very, very precise passing game. However, his feet are but a small part of what makes Busquets great. It’s really all about his head. No, not his heading ability (nothing to write home about here), but his footballing brain. For it is his understanding of the game that makes him stand out. I don’t think I have ever seen a more cerebral player than Sergio Busquets. Yes, there are elements of his technique that are truly outstanding, but the way he plays the game is fundamentally about his intelligence. Everything else comes second.\n\nBusquets is a special player for this reason. But no portrait of him is complete without adding that he is a special player for another reason: his physical attributes are, let’s say, peculiar. He is quite slow, not very agile, not strong, and not good in the air for someone his size. He simply isn’t an athlete. Now don’t get me wrong. He is a professional athlete insofar as, by all accounts, he trains well, lives a healthy lifestyle, and has trained himself into someone who can play a full season without tiring all too much. But his body doesn’t quite look like that of a professional football player. Too lanky, too thin, still a bit awkward. It is not entirely inconceivable that under slightly different circumstances, if he had not been promoted to the first team under Pep Guardiola in 2008, Busquets could have failed to have a top level career in football. Something you cannot say about any of the other great players of the decade. The Catalan is a player who needs an environment that suits his strengths and weaknesses. In a team that does not play out from the back, or in a team whose defensive game lacks compactness and in which the defensive midfielder is constantly asked to chase his opponents in acres of space, he would be both wasted and lost. There are dozens, maybe hundreds of players out there who would do a better job under those circumstances than he. But if the team suits his needs, if they play out from the back and utilize a high and compact pressing and counter pressing game, his strengths come out and his weaknesses vanish. Luckily for him, and luckily for us, Busquets played in teams that fit this description for most of the decade. And so he was able to fulfill his peculiar, yet very special potential.\n\nLet us chronicle his evolution as a player throughout the decade: by 2010, at 22 years of age, he had become an established world class performer and a regular both in Guardiola’s all-conquering Barcelona and the Spanish national team that won the World Cup. His playing style, both with and without the ball, was already marked by the exquisite blend of technique and intelligence that marks his whole career. As Johan Cruyff declared right after Busquets broke through in 2008:\n\nPositionally, he seems like a veteran with or without the ball. With the ball he makes what is difficult look easy: he disposes of the ball with one or two touches. Without the ball, he gives us a lesson: that of being in the right place to intercept and running just to recover the ball.\n\nCruyff’s mention of interceptions is very apt. Back then Busquets played in teams that pressed as far forward as any of the teams he was ever going to play in. And he played a major part in that because of his ability to sniff out opportunities for winning the ball back way before they arose, for example before the ball is even lost in the first place. His counter pressing performances in those days were among the best in his career (which is course aided by the fact that the Barcelona team in particular was so very good at it on a team level). With the ball he was already an accomplished system player in a team that set the highest standards imaginable in regards to ball rotation and crisp, precise passing game. However, when it came to providing moments of inspiration himself, doing the thing that turns secure possession into dangerous possession, he was less important than he later became. With prime Xavi and prime Iniesta and Messi as a false 9 by his side, he kept it a bit more “simple” than in later years. His ingeniousness was already present, but mostly without the ball. It showed in the decisions he made in high pressing and counter pressing scenarios: in the numerous times he won the ball back high up the field, when everybody else would have opted for a more conservative approach. These were the situations that earned him the nickname “the Octopus of Badia”. But with the ball he was more of a very accomplished wheel in a machine that as a whole produced feats of genius, rather than a genius himself. Still, he was the best defensive midfielder in the world by the time the decade began. That I placed Jack Wilshere ahead of him for the 2010-11 Team of the Season is not one of my prouder moments. (Still, I don’t change my selections later on. They do reflect what I thought at the time.)\n\nThe years between 2011 and 2014 mark Busquets’ ascent from a “regular world class player” into one of historic quality. This was primarily down to a change in the way he played when he had the ball. In those years Busquets discovered more and more that he could actually be a decisive player with the ball at his feet. He began inviting pressure, only to somehow evade his pursuers time and time again. He became an expert in employing the speed and energy of opponents chasing him for his own purposes. He made them think they had him pinned down, only to go the other way in the last possible moment and leave them chasing shadows. He baited them like a bullfighter baits a bull, to use a ubiquitous but in this case very fitting analogy. This way of playing naturally opened up spaces and passing angles for himself and his teammates. Spaces and passing angles that weren’t there previously and that often proved decisive. His passing game, too, became more adventurous. He never registered too many assists (5 Liga assists were the highest he ever got, and that was in 2017-18), but he became much more adept at playing the penultimate pass or simply the key pass that initiated a dangerous dynamic. He had always been good at finding teammates between the lines but his ability increased further in these years. In short, Busquets transformed from a deeply rational, solid-beyond-his-years, La Masia model pupil into a genius in his own right that did not “just” keep the machine rolling but added decisive moments of the highest caliber. For that he made my Team of the Season in 2011-12 and was even named Player of the Season in 2012-13 and 2013-14. Retrospectively I can say that I’m not sure he should have gotten the last two awards. Despite a small slump in the spring, Messi was clearly the best player in 2012-13. And in 2013-14 Cristiano Ronaldo has a very good case. Still, by 2014 Busquets had produced his first string of peak seasons.\n\nThe 2014-15 season, despite ending in a triple for FC Barcelona, marked the end of Busquets’ first phase of excellence. You see, the kind of stuff he played between, say, 2012 and 2014 was a tightrope act. Actively inviting pressure 30 meters from your own goal, when there are just two further teammates behind you, almost by definition means flirting with disaster. That Busquets pulled it off for two years while hardly making any mistake along the way is a miracle. Especially given the fact that the opponents he faced, many of them world class players of their own, very soon knew what was coming. Busquets had to be at his very best to play this way. As soon as his form dropped off only a little the tightrope act became unsustainable. That is what happened in 2014-15, especially in the first half of the season. He began making mistakes and given his way of playing “mistakes” were often bound to be “major mistakes”. His form improved in the new year, at least partly because he kept it a bit more simple. However, that meant he would never be his old self again…\n\n…until next season. When he arguably surpassed his previous peak! He regained the sharpness that allowed him to blend audacious genius with more solid rational play without falling off the tightrope. I, yet again, named him Player of the Season in 2015-16 and this is the one I’m standing by. His ability to win balls close to the opponent’s box was at least as good as in the early years of the decade, and that in a system that supported him less. More generally, his overall range on the field further improved in this season, possibly because his anticipation was at its all-time-best. With the ball he proved that the tightrope act was possible even years after every opponent he ever faced must have seen it dozens of times. It seems that there is simply no way to “figure out” that kind of footballing quality.\n\nThe years from 2016 to 2020 mark the autumn of his career. He never again quite hit the heights of 2013-14 or 2015-6 (although his 2017-18 was very good indeed), but oscillated between “some (very) good, some bad” and “best defensive midfielder in the world”. He made the bench of the 2016-17 Team of the Season, first eleven of the 2017-18 Team of the Season, and again the bench of the 2018-19 Team of the Season. 2019-20 was the first time in this decade that he failed to make it into my selection. One general problem in these years was that Barcelona’s system suited him less and less. They became more conservative, less intense in pressing and counter pressing, and in general more suitable to a more ordinary kind of pivot – and thereby less suitable to Busquets. Even at his relative worst, say towards the very end of the decade, Busquets produced outstanding peaks. I don’t think there is a season this decade in which some of the very best performances by any defensive midfielder aren’t of his making. It might even be true that he produced more Top 10 performances than any other DM in every season of the last ten years – including his weaker ones! The problem was not so much that he no longer couldn’t be very good, but that he never again (with the exception of 2017-18) became as flawless as he used to be. He still was as special, just not quite as good. However, the fact that he did make the bench for every season bar the last puts his ratio of mistakes into perspective. He still was quite good. World class or bordering on world class even. But no longer at the historic level he set for himself earlier on. One can’t help but wonder whether a transfer to, say, Manchester City somewhere around 2017 or 2018 would have meant even more years of Busquets-excellence for us to witness.\n\nI hadn’t yet begun writing match notes when Busquets played his best seasons and I, too, am guilty of not remembering the standout performances of defensive midfielers as well as those of players further forward. Hence I recommend you watch some of the peak performances of his later years. One came against Juventus in a Champions League group match on the 22nd of November 2017. A standout Clasico performance is the one from the 3rd of December 2016. And his performance against Lyon on the 13th of March 2019 is well worth watching as well. You’ll see the historical high water mark for a defensive midfielder in these and many more matches.\n\nToni Kroos\n\nOverall Score: 18 (4+(4×2)+(2×3))\n\nTo tell you the truth, I thought Toni Kroos would become a different player than the one he actually did become. Back in 2007-2008, when Kroos was the hottest youth player in Germany (although some nerds talked about a certain teenager named Götze), me and many other people who followed German football thought Kroos would go on to be a mixture of, say, Steven Gerrard and Kevin de Bruyne. A high-scoring, high-assisting, box-to-box dominator. This is not what happened. But that is not to say that Toni Kroos did not fulfill his potential. It may have looked like he would go on to be a different player, but a better one? Well, maybe a bit better. But not much. And in terms of the career he had, it is hardly conceivable how it could have gone any better. So, career wise Kroos is a 10/10 and he lived up to at least 90% of his potential. It’s therefore fair to say that he is one of those rare wunderkinder who really delivered on their promise. Even though he did so in a slightly different fashion than I anticipated.\n\nThere are players whose main strength lies in their ability to put the cherry on the cake. Toni Kroos, on the other hand, while capable of the occasional exquisite cherry, is very much a dough baker. He tirelessly creates the foundation on which the cherry can be placed. He does so with great precision (perhaps the most important adjective when describing Kroos), with utter reliability, and with a minimum of fuss. And he is a tad conservative. Yes, I can’t deny it: he embodies the cliché of quality work “Made in Germany” like very few players before him. There is a spark of magic to his game, but it is subtle magic. The quality of his first touch, a body feint here and there, and the way he passes the ball into the bottom corner from the edge of the area every once in a while. Apart from these things, he has cut almost every form of embellishmen from his style of play. In a way, he personifies the modern midfield game. It is high quality, relying on speed of thought and a sure touch more than sprints across the field or athletic heroics (apart from doing one’s share of long distance running every game). But it is rarely flamboyant, because flamboyance will never minimize the ratio of mistakes one makes. Opponents despair when facing the likes of Kroos not because of any individual action of his but because of the relentless stream of flawless quality contributions coming from him. Death by a thousand Querpässe. (Nonono, that Kroos only plays sideward passes is a German cliché about him and not true. He is more of a Diagonalpass-Toni than a Querpass-Toni. Which makes a hell of a difference!)\n\nOne of the best decisions of Kroos’ career was to accept a transfer to Real Madrid. He did become an important player at Bayern Munich and his influence would have grown as the years go by, but going to a different country and a different culture was an act of emancipation for him. He got to be his true self, without having to deal with the vision of what he ought to become that people formed in their mind seven years earlier. In Spain he became the new Makelele. Not style-wise, of course, but in relation to his role in the team: the world-class player that didn’t make you go ‘oh!’ and ‘ah!’ with every other touch. The dough baker, not the cherry placer. And this time Real Madrid learnt from their past mistakes and recognized the value of such a player. Only after he made this switch did Kroos become the gold standard for central midfield play in world football. He made the first eleven of my Team of the Season in 2014-15 and sat on the bench in the three seasons that followed. Add to that two outstanding international tournaments in 2014 and 2016. Heck, he wasn’t even that bad in 2018!\n\nThe central midfielders of the last two Teams of the Decade were Xavi Hernandez and Andrea Pirlo. I have to say that I place Kroos not as highly as those two. Paul Scholes also featured as a central midfielder for the 2000-2010 Team and that to me seems a more appropriate point of comparison. What I want to say is that I don’t think that Toni Kroos belongs to the very best central midfielders of all time. However, choosing him wasn’t some kind of stopgap either. He is a worthy member of a Team of the Decade, just not the kind of indispensable automatic starter who belongs on the cover page of the great book of football history. Kroos was maybe not the best midfield player in any given year but he was the quintessential central midfielder of the decade. He did what central midfielders did this decade better and more consistently than anyone else – except for…\n\nLuka Modric\n\nOverall Score: 21 ((3×4)+(2×2)+3+ (2×1))\n\nToni Kroos may be the finest player in the central midfielder mould that leans towards the classic regista role. But if we also talk about central midfielders who play in a more advanced role that borders on the attacking midfielder style, there is another player who edges him out as the best of the decade. That player is Luka Modric. He is the best central midfielder of the decade, full stop. And he is the closest thing we have to a worthy successor to the likes of Xavi and Pirlo. (Although he too does not quite reach those heights in my opinion.)\n\nModric scores few goals and, perhaps more surprisingly, doesn’t assist a lot either. Furthermore, he evidently hasn’t the kind of physical presence necessary to engage opponents in a physical midfield battle or win duels in the air. And he isn’t a set piece specialist, neither from corners nor from free-kicks. Now that we know what he isn’t good at, we can proceed to ask: what is he good at? Well, everything else. Like, absolutely. everything. else. Modric is the kind of player that is universally respected in expert circles. Everyone who knows a bit about football and what makes a good footballer imediately recognizes that Modric is a very good footballer indeed. His overall technique is exquisite, his ball handling and first touch are as good as Kroos’. His awareness and understanding of the game matches that of the German as well. But his low centre of gravity and his dribbling skills provide him with greater means to receive the ball in tight spaces and do something productive, and even something inventive, with it. Modric is a player whose true value becomes apparent in big games against strong opponents. When spaces become smaller and smaller, when the time you have to figure out what to do becomes less and less, when the opponents’ quality becomes so high that lesser players are suffocated out of their game – that is when Modric shines. He may not be the player that registers tons of scoring points against lesser teams, but he is the kind of player that gives you that extra yard of space, that surprising first touch flick that surprises even the best of opponents, that moment of pure quality that can decide games at the very pinnacle of the modern game. In this sense, he resembles Andres Iniesta, his predecessor in 2005-2015 Team of the Decade; another universally respected player who could make the difference at the highest level. A good example of Modric’s quality was last season’s encounter against Ajax. Frenkie de Jong was Modric’s direct opponent. The young Dutchman played a fine game but the then 33 year-old Modric was equally impressive. What unfolded was a duel of two complete modern technical midfielders. De Jong might be the future, but the veteran Modric was at least as good as the new kid on the block.\n\nSpeaking about Modric being a veteran, his public acclaim has grown considerably during the last two years. The high water mark was his Ballon d’Or and World Cup Golden Ball double in 2018. However, these accolades are best understood as lifetime achievement awards. Yes, he had a strong World Cup in 2018 and did win the Champions League, but by then he wasn’t at his very best anymore. His finest seasons came around the middle of the decade. 2016-2017 was the last one that I consider to be part of his peak – and perhaps the pick of the bunch. His performances in the later stages of that year’s Champions League in particular exhibited everything that is good about the player they call ‘Mozart’. Check out the Bayern match for a particular highlight.\n\nLet me close the section on this decade’s midfielders with a word on a few players who missed out on the first eleven: Iniesta and Xavi, the latter in particular, belong to the highest echelon of midfield players. They produced the best seasons any central or attacking midfielder has played in this decade. They both miss out on the first team because of a lack of quantity of performance. Xavi essentially retired in 2015 and was a part time player for the 1-2 years preceding his Barcelona exit. Iniesta was the more difficult to omit player. He played quality seasons even after the middle of the decade. Having said that, the last time he made a first eleven was in 2012-2013. I ultimately think the golden autumn of his great career wasn’t quite golden enough (although he was very good in 2014-15 and 2015-16… tough one). Finally, Kevin de Bruyne. He should have made the first team. At his best he is easily the best attacking midfielder since at least Iniesta. What stopped him were injuries and the lost time at Chelsea. So in the end I settled for a team without a true attacking midfielder and chose the two fantastic central midfielders at the heart of the Real Madrid machine that came to dominate this decade’s Champions League.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo\n\nOverall Score: 43 ((9×4)+3+2+(2×1))\n\nLet us briefly get the elephant out of the room: there is no way Cristiano Ronaldo wins Player of the Decade. Lionel Messi is the significantly better player because, among other things, he outclasses Ronaldo as a creator while matching him as a finisher. The difference in their Overall Score – Messi has 28 points more than Cristiano, only 7 less than the latter has in total – roughly captures the gulf in quality between them.\n\nWith that being said, let us close the Ronaldo-Messi comparison for now. Because if this were to be about the both of them, I would need to mainly talk about what Cristiano Ronaldo is not. And doing so would be a wasted opportunity and, frankly, unfair. Because Cristiano has done more than enough to warrant me to talk about what he is, rather than what he is not.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo is an all-time great. He is one of the10 best players in the history of the sport. And his last decade was one of the best decades any player has ever played. He is a strong contender for a place in the next Team of Football History. If he doesn’t make the first team, he will definitely be on the bench. He is one of the three truly outstanding players of the 2010s and perhaps the second best of them overall.\n\nAll of these positive asssessments are closely linked to Cristiano Ronaldo’s ability to do one thing: find the back of the net. At the time of writing these lines, he stands at 725 professional career goals. The vast majority of which came during the decade in question. Sometimes when I describe what makes a player great, I feel I need to go into the subtleties of that player’s style. With Ronaldo, I could just as well stop after writing down this number. 725 goals. You don’t need to know anything more about him to know that he is a player of historic quality and an obvious pick for this team.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo started out as a winger, but as his career progressed he became more and more of a centre-forward. When he made my Team of the Season selections, as he almost always did, I mostly placed him on the left wing but with one or even multiple arrows pointing to the penalty box. At Real Madrid Karim Benzema was the nominal striker but was actually more of an alround forward while Ronaldo started from the wing but then made off-the-ball runs into the box – where his most important contributions took place.\n\nHere is what I wrote about him way back in the 2014-15 Team of the Season:\n\n“Ronaldo is now past his 30th birthday and he has trimmed off all those parts of his game that aren’t directly about scoring goals. This is a logical step since scoring goals is, and has been for some time, his biggest strength. He still got that speed, that strength, that jump and that determination to reach every ball. These qualities make him an absolute nightmare for every defender having to face him in the box.”\n\nAnd three seasons later I described his quality in the box in the following way:\n\n“He may still station himself on the left wing on occasion but his game is all about those actions in and around the penalty box. He combines the raw poacher’s instinct of Gerd Müller with the physical ability of peak Marco van Basten. His prowess in the air, in particular, is almost unmatched in football history, which is an even more fantastic feat for a player who isn’t that tall. [I mean, come on, that is different class!] As soon as a ball – be it in the form of a cross, a pass, or some random action – enters the area, Ronaldo seems to be almost magnetically attracted to it. His short sprints to reach the ball are so forceful, so well-timed that hardly any defender is able to keep up. In this form, he continues to build his case for being maybe the best true centre forward the game has even seen.”\n\nI stand by these statements. By narrowing the focus of his game, Ronaldo made himself a better player than he was in the early years of the decade. When he still roamed more freely on the left wing and outside the penalty box, he made more questionable decisions. Taking shots even a player with a Top 5 Right Foot in Football History should not take; showing his limitations as a playmaker. All of that became far less important when his game (and Real Madrid’s) became much more about heading home one cross after another.\n\nA further thing that makes Cristiano Ronaldo stand out is his relentless ambition. He wants to be the best all day, everyday. Of course, most professional football players show a high level of ambition that makes them do the things one needs to do to succeed in this business. But Ronaldo is something else. It certainly seems that there are very few players as driven as he is. This drive is the key reason for his consistency (although his first half of the season became less consistent in later years, it has to be said). He never lets up because there is always another opportunity to prove himself. Cristiano is a player that will always be his team’s main man. Not just because he is in fact the best player, but also because he couldn’t stand it any other way. This can be a weakness which results in egoism and petulance. But in the pressure-cooker that is top level football, it can also be a blessing for the team that has Ronaldo on its roster. He wants the responsibility, he needs the responsibility – thus making it the case that others need not bear it themselves. He casts a giant shadow, allowing plants to grow around him that fare better out of the direct sunlight.\n\nI never named Cristiano Ronaldo Player of the Season. He made almost all selections but was never singled out as the season’s best player. Looking back I wonder whether he shouldn’t have won it at least once. But when? All the years in which Messi won, Messi was better. Which leaves us with 12-13, 13-14, and 15-16. Messi should have won 12-13, so that season isn’t an option as well. 15-16 wasn’t a great Cristiano season, which leaves us with 13-14. Busquets won Player of the Season that year and he really was outstanding. But so was Ronaldo. So in retrospective I’d say that maybe he should have won it in 2013-14. I only started compiling Teams of the Season in 2008-09, but there is little doubt that Cristiano would have won the 2007-08 edition, bringing his total ‘Footballarguments Ballon d’Ors’ to at least two. This seems about right. If it wasn’t for Messi, he’d have won half a dozen or so. If you want to experience what makes Cristiano Ronaldo an all-time great, just watch the compilation of all his Real Madrid goals. It tells you everything you need to know. For an individual match the 2017 Champions League final is a good choice.\n\nIn closing, let me mention that this is purely about the player Cristiano Ronaldo, not the person. There are serious allegations against the person, which do not affect the evaluation of the player that is the subject of this blog.\n\nRobert Lewandowski\n\nOverall Score: 22 (8+4+(5×2))\n\nWhen you read this, you will know which player I picked to lead the line of the 2010-20 Team of the Decade. But at the time of writing these lines, I am still undecided. For picking a striker was the hardest decision of the whole selection process. I’m writing these words at the end of July 2020 and there still isn’t a decision. I’m waiting for the Champions League 19-20 to finish in order to better decide between the two candidates I have in mind. Which tells you everything you need to know about just how close the race was. The two candidates are Luis Suarez and Robert Lewandowski. The decade has seen quite a few great striker. Kun Agüero and Karim Benzema make the bench of this team and would have been worthy candidates for the first eleven as well – if it weren’t for Suarez and Lewandowski. I don’t want to claim that they are far ahead of the competition, but I for one am certain that there is far less seperates these two than what seperates them from the rest.\n\nNote that there could have been a way to spare me from having to make this decision. If I had classified Lionel Messi as a centre forward, he would have easily won the place. And even if I didn’t, I could have classified Cristiano Ronaldo as a centre forward instead. Had I done so, the Portuguese would have outclassed all other contenders. As you know by now, I did neither. Messi stop playing the false 9 role that he occupied in the beginning of the decade somewhere around 2014 and hence played most of the decade on the right or in a playmaking position in the right half space. Fielding him as a central striker would therefore be misleading at best. The case of Cristiano is less clear cut. He, too, mostly started from the wing, the left in his case, and that is why I chose to play him there – but to say that he played as a centre forward is much less wrong than it is in the case of Messi. Yes, he started matches on the wing, but his decisive actions usually came when he occupied the centre. Much like, you know, a striker would do. On the other hand, however, he rarely played as the lone centre forward of his team. At Madrid he always had Karim Benzema by his side. And at Juventus there was Gonzalo Higuain occupying the middle, or even Dybala who acted as a false 9, opening up spaces for Ronaldo to run into. Hence fielding him as the one centre forward of my team would have been ahistorical as well.\n\nWhich means we’re back with the tough decision we started with. I will now briefly outline what speaks in favour of Suarez and Lewandowski, and what their respective drawbacks are in comparison to one another, and then later add a short part where I explain my final choice.\n\nGenerally speaking, I see Lewandowski as the more well-rounded player. He is a complete striker who has fully adapted to the modern game. He has the body, he has the mindset, he has the workrate, he has the passing game, he has the intelligence, and so on. With Lewandowski you know what you are getting. And what you are getting basically is the state of the art of the modern striker’s game. He is the closest thing we currently have to the van Basten archetype of the ideal modern striker. With Luis Suarez, you don’t know what you are getting. I have on more than one occasion expressed the conviction that before every action by him, God flips a coin. Heads, you get all that you wished for and more. Tails, you get considerably less than you wished for.\n\nA high ball sails into the area and finds Suarez with this back to goal – he will either score some absurd dream goal or boot it in the general direction of the corner flag.\n\nA high ball sails into the area and finds Lewandowski with his back to goal – he will probably try to control it and maybe try to turn and shoot or play it to an onrushing midfielder.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, there is a sense in which Luis Suarez is a very dependable player, at least as dependable as Lewandowski. Over the course of the season the odds will even out and Suarez will be roughly as reliable a provider of goals as Lewandowski is. The South American has scored 223 league goals over the course of the decade and the European 236. Suarez played in leagues that had 38 matchdays while Lewandowski’s Bundesliga has only 34. But Lewandowski was his team’s main goalscorer for most of the decade, while Suarez played with Messi. However, playing with Messi arguably makes it easier to score goals. And there was one season where Lewandowski was fielded as more of a No.10. But… yet… however… you see, it kind of evens out between these two when it comes to their goalscoring prowess, doesn’t it?\n\nBoth Lewandowski and Suarez had amazing peak achievements. For Suarez that was his last Premier League season with Liverpool in which he almost drove them to the title and his second Barcelona season, 2015-16, in which he scored 40 goals (being fed by a Leo Messi who has having his perhaps best season as a playmaker). For Lewandowski it was (or, at the time of writing, is) the 2019-20 season when he scored more than a goal a match in the Bundesliga and played his most complete season yet, further proving the point I made earlier on about him being the complete modern striker. Also, there were those legendary four goals against Madrid in the 2013 Champions League semi-final (and my God, those were great goals, even the penalty is class!). Suarez has never performed that well on that big an occasion. But still, Suarez had two absolute standout seasons while Lewandowski had only one. So advantage Suarez, right? Yes, but an advantage that will immediately be nullified by the fact that Suarez’s lows were quite a bit lower than Lewandowski’s. The Pole hasn’t played a bad season all decade, while Suarez’s 2019-20 must be counted as decidedly sub-par. And then there is the lengthy ban Suarez got after biting Chiellini in the 2014 World Cup and the not-quite-as-lengthy-but-still ban he got after racially abusing Patrice Evra (short reminder that this selection reflects my sporting judgments, not my moral ones). Both meant that he wasn’t able to perform for some time during the respective seasons. I have said that Suarez’s hit-or-miss nature evened out over longer periods of time, but at this macro level it might actually be evident again. Higher highs, lower lows.\n\nOkay, that’s it from me for the moment. Future-me will take over right after the break.\n\n———————————————————————————————————\n\nHi there. So it’s Robert Lewandowski who won the starting spot. His 2019-20 was strong enough to clinch the place in the first eleven. Suarez on the other hand had a thoroughly underwhelming end to the decade. Now, I do think Suarez lay slightly ahead before this last season and hence the end result was very close, but the Polish striker did just enough. The fact that he is the more modern, more hardworking striker didn’t hurt him either. The only non-Barcelona player to win Player of the Season this decade. (However, see the profile on Cristiano Ronaldo and the various tournaments in which a non-Barca player was rated highest (2010, 2014, 2016, 2018).)\n\nLionel Messi\n\nOverall Score: 67 ((6×8)+(3×4)+2+3+(2×1))\n\nOh boy, the big portrait of Lionel Messi. I have to say that the prospect of writing this piece alarmed me ever so slightly. I really want to get this right. The problem is not that there is nothing to say about Leo Messi, but that I have already said so much about him. Let me therefore use this opportunity to point you to some of the things I wrote about him in the past. You can find some of my Messi-related musings here, here and here. Okay, with that out of the way, here it goes.\n\nThree years ago I argued that Lionel Messi is the best player in the history of men’s football. I stand by that opinion. The three years since 2017 have only strengthened his case. He won Player of the Season in 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, the latter ranking among his very best seasons. The 2018 World Cup, for which he made the bench, was no vintage tournament for him but, of course, didn’t weaken his case either. The argument for Messi being the best player of all time does not solely rest on what he did during the decade that is the topic of this blogpost. The 2008-09 and 2009-10 seasons in particular marked early highlights of his career and should not be forgotten. Having said that, I think it is defensible to say that Messi would be the GOAT even without these seasons. This is because his performances between 2010 and 2020, the period of time we are talking about here, are on their own strong enough to edge out all competitors. In my opinion Messi’s 2010-2020 decade was the best decade any footballer has ever played. Better than Pelé’s 1960s, better than Maradona’s 1980s, and yes, better than Cristiano Ronaldo’s 2010s. In this decade alone Messi played at a higher level than anyone ever before and he sustained the level of excellence for longer than his closest competitors did. There can be no doubt that Messi belongs in the first eleven of this Team of the Decade. And there can be no doubt that he must win Player of the Decade. The scoring system that I introduced in the beginning gives you a decent sense of how great his dominance was. Only Cristiano Ronaldo and Sergio Busquets, the other two historic giants of this decade*, managed to gain more than half (!) the points Messi amassed. And both do not come close to matching Messi’s tally. As I said, the scoring system is imperfect in tracing excellence. But the result is telling nevertheless.\n\n*To be sure, other players of historic calibre played professional football at some point in time this decade. But their decade was the 2005-2015 or even 2000-2010 one.\n\nIn what follows I will first describe Messi’s playing style. Then I chronicle his exploits of the last ten years in club football before commenting on his career with the Argentine national team.\n\nHow he plays\n\nThe thing that sets Messi apart from almost all players in the history of the game is that he is supernaturally good at two things, scoring goals and creating goals. The vast majority of professional footballers (~99,99999%) is supernaturally good at no single thing (good, yes, very good, maybe, but not supernaturally good). A tiny minority, a subset of the historic elite, is supernaturally good at one of these things. The likes of Gerd Müller and Cristiano Ronaldo, for example, are supernaturally good at scoring goals, but far from being supernaturally good at creating goals. Someone like peak-Özil or peak-De Bruyne is supernaturally good at creating goals, but far from supernaturally good at scoring goals. Messi does both. Furthermore, he is not only supernaturally good at creating goals for others but also supernaturally good at creating goals for himself. He is the man behind his own goals to a much higher degree than the aforementioned Müller and C. Ronaldo are. (Don’t get me wrong, I may compare these players unfavourably to Messi, but the very fact that I chose them as points of comparison is a hidden compliment.) Some players are brilliant at creating goals for themselves (think of peak Ronaldo), but less brilliant at creating goals for others. And Messi has not just one principal means of creating goals for others but two. He is supernaturally good at creating by means of dribbling and supernaturally good at creating by means of passing.\n\nNo other player this decade can claim to be supernaturally good at scoring and creating goals. And only very few players in the history of the game can claim to have ever reached this double-god-level. Those who did – Pelé and Maradona, for example – didn’t do it as well and for as long as Messi did. But enough with the historical comparisons. This is not ‘Who is the best Footballer of All Time? 2.0′. Messi essentially gives you three players of historical quality: an inverted winger who mainly operates by using his dribbling skills; a No.10 playmaker who utilises his touch, passing range and, most of all, vision; and a centre-forward who relies on his nose for goal, precise shot, and utter calm in front of goal. By the beginning of the decade all three pillars were recognizable, but over the years Messi has greatly improved his playmaking ability in particular. He always was one of the best playmakers in the world, but he only became the single greatest later on, especially in and after 2014-2015. Oh, and before I forget it, Messi also became the premier free-kick specialist in the world in the second half of the decade. Doesn’t make him a worse player, does it?\n\nOne thing about Messi’s playing style that is at the centre of some of my earlier writings on him is the rationality that permeates his game. Since I have already written so much about it (check the links in the first paragraph of this profile), I just want to briefly touch upon it. Messi rarely overcomplicates things. He knows what he has to do, he knows what he can do and what even he can’t do, and he can be trusted to choose his actions accordingly. The same is typically not true for players who are as talented as Messi is. They often try to force their way into success by applying their skills with little regard for the overall situation. Trial and error is the name of the game. Messi is different. He is ‘the Playstation player’, as Arsene Wenger has called him. It’s like he sees the game from above. He controls his actions like an all-knowing third-person observer who has the cool head of someone sitting on his couch at home; not like a sweating, heavy-breathing, emotionally-charged, first-person human deep in the fog of contest. Messi simpy does what needs doing. Of course, not everything he does works, but Messi very rarely makes outright mistakes, opts for the Hail Mary approach, or the like. He is the chess player among world class forwards.\n\nNow, one of the things that were always important to me in writing this blog is not to get lost in hyperbole when writing about admittedly great players. Even the best have weaknesses or things they are not outstanding at and they should not be overlooked. This is true for everybody, including the best of them all. For large parts of this decade Messi’s defensive workrate has been poor. He is, ironically enough, insanely good at pressing, counterpressing and winning the ball, but the quantity of his defensive work is nothing to write home about. This wasn’t always the case. His inclusion in his team’s defensive plan was much greater under Pep Guardiola but got less and less as the years went by and has stagnated at an absolutely low level during the second half of the decade. When it comes to defensive work, Messi is not the spearhead of modern football but a relic of the past. It might be true that this state of affairs is a necessary precondition of his offensive longevity, but I wonder if there wasn’t a slightly less tilted compromise that could have worked even better. Alas, ‘it is what it is’.\n\nHis club career\n\nTo summarize Messi’s Barcelona career between 2010 and 2020 (and in fact between 2008 and 2020) with the words ‘he went from strength to strength’ wouldn’t be that wrong. Still, there have been important developments that I want to sketch in this section.\n\nFor the first two seasons of the decade Messi was part of the strongest club side in football history (in my opinion, that they are one of the strongest should be beyond doubt): Pep Guardiola’s FC Barcelona. The 2010-11 season in particular was their high water mark. Messi’s individual genius was in perfect harmony with the collective approach of the team. He played as a false 9 back then and didn’t even score thaaaat many goals that season. 31 in the league… and 22 in other competitions, which adds up to 53 goals in total… okay, he scored plenty of goals, sure, but, my point is, not as much as in some later seasons! And this is a sign of a more fundamental truth about his role back then: he played in a team that didn’t rely that much on him scoring. David Villa and Pedro, too, were natural finishers and contributed their fair share. Messi could therefore take a more multi-faceted role and contributed plenty to his side’s midfield play. His role was more strategic than it would be in the years to come. Only in the last seasons of the decade did he come close to doing so again – for very different reasons. The prime example of his role back then was the legendary 5-0 Clasico in November 2010. Messi didn’t score that day, but still produced a masterclass performance. He assisted Villa twice and ran the show from midfield.\n\nIn the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seaons Messi still played in a team whose midfield featured prime Xavi, Iniesta and Busquets (plus Fabregas and Thiago Alcantara!). The quality in middle of the park therefore remained excellent. However, his supporting cast up front grew weaker and the team’s attacking focus shifted to an approach that basically consisted of giving Messi a solid foundation, creating the space and the opportunity for him (if he didn’t create it himself, which he often did), and then trusting him to do the rest. When it came to scoring goals, he did more and more of the heavy lifting. And boy, heavy he did lift! 50 league goals in 2011-12 and 46 league goals in 2012-13, when he missed the last few games due to injury, are quite frankly insane statistics. I personally, though, don’t think of the 11-13 Messi as being much better than the 2010-11 one. Sure, his goal statistics got even more insane. His greatness became even more obvious. But only because it had to. Only because the team got worse. The 2010-11 Messi could be more of a team player, more often playing in a supporting role, because the system made other shine brightly as well. And Messi still produced strictly individual moments of utmost brilliance such as his solo goal against Madrid in the 2011 Champions League semi-final. Hence I tend to think of the whole 2010-2013 phase as being on a roughly equal level of quality. And that quality was superb.\n\n2013-14 was when his first plateau of greateness ended. The problems with injury that plagued the young Messi returned and he never seemed fully fit. Barcelona as a whole, managed by Tata Martino at the time, where playing far worse than in previous seasons. This was not only down to Messi’s relative lack of contribution (41 goals in all competitions and 14 assists clearly should make us stress the word ‘relative’… there was also a Clasico hattrick). His supporting cast, by now an apt term, got considerably worse – if not in name than certainly in performance. This was the only season so far (I write this in May 2020) that Messi failed to make the first eleven of a Team of the Season. Looking back, this could very well be an overreaction on my part. Underrating worse-than-usual performances of special players compared to peak performances of lesser players seems a common bias in football, perhaps because ‘not as good as he used to be, but still the best’ doesn’t make for a very compelling story.\n\n2014-15 marked the beginning and in fact the highest point of Messi’s second plateau of greateness. This era lasted at least until 2019. The second half of the decade saw him become an even more complete player. His qualities as a playmaker grew considerably and he acquired the rank of a set-piece specialist. The 2014-15 season was, in my opinion, when we hit peak-Messi. By now he fully ticked both the ‘supernatural scorer’ and the ‘supernatural creator’ box and was still at his physical peak. I have seen no other player who dominated the opponent’s half quite like Messi did that season. The addition of Neymar and Luis Suarez meant that he had very capable goalscorers at his side. One might think that this would result in Messi scoring less but the opposite was the case. 43 league goals marked almost a return to 2011-13 levels – while Messi was playing further from goal than he did back then! By now he was switching between his old position on the right wing and the role of a classic No.10.\n\nThe years 2015-2018 saw the continuation of this phase of his career, albeit on a somewhat diminished level compared to his absolute peak in 2014-15. He drifted more and more towards playing as a No.10, while still scoring goals like an elite centre forward in his best ever season. Barcelona grew less and less of a total team, but Messi remained a total player. The 2018-19 season did not quite break with this trend but still brought a noticeable change. Messi was by now the captain of Barcelona and perhaps that was what made him change his style somewhat. Messi was playing like someone who saw it as his personal responsibility to carry his team all the way to winning major trophies. His game actually became somewhat more akin to the earlier described model of the über-talented player who tries to force success by applying his talents time and time again, no matter the odds. Thing is, the results were spectacular. I don’t think it is far fetched to say that Barcelona – no, that Messi fell only one goal short of winning the treble. In games like the Champions League match against Tottenham a physically diminished Leo Messi carried Barcelona to surprising heights in a fashion very rarely seen in modern football and more reminiscent of ancient players like Di Stefano. Others performed well, too, but Barcelona was by now Messi’s team in a much stronger sense than one should think possible in a team sport. Assuming this role changed Messi, and not just for the better, but seeing him play like this was certainly a sight to behold. Having said that, the effort involved took its toll. The Messi who played at 2019s Copa America and in the 2019-20 season, while still operating at a very high level, often seemed like a player whose last major effort to roll back the years lay behind him. At the time of writing this, Messi’s 2019-20 was closer to his 2013-14 than his 2014-15. Classic moments alternated with niggling injuries and the feeling that he wasn’t fully fit.\n\nMessi and Argentina\n\nOne of the main criticisms directed at Messi is that he never won a major trophy with his national team. For my purposes the missing titles are of no importance. As I said in the beginning of the blogpost, my selection is about performance only. And you can perform brilliantly and go trophyless. The more interesting criticism thus is that Messi did not perform as well for Argentina than he did for Barcelona. While I think that arguments for Messi not being the best player ever that build on this observation are not convincing, there is some truth to it. If Messi played for Barcelona as he does for Argentina, he would not be as great a player as he is. Yes, Argentina has featured peak-Messi as well, in particular at the Copa America Centenario in 2016, but much more intermittently than Barcelona did. Even the 2014 World Cup where Messi was named best player by FIFA was not vintage Messi if we compare his performances to his usual level at Barcelona. To be clear, Messi has played very well for Argentina on numerous occasions. World class and beyond. But not as well as he does for Barcelona.\n\nAn apparent reason is that the Argentine national team – his teammates, the manager, and perhaps he himself – has often failed to integrate him properly. They failed to integrate him properly because they over-integrated him. They built their whole game around him, channeling every move through Messi. There is no better build-up player in the squad than Messi? Then it’s best he does that. There is no better creator in the final third than Messi? Then it’s best he does that. There is no better finisher in the squad than Messi? Then let’s try to make it the case that he finishes every move. The problem is that if you add these things up, you basically stop being a football team. You become Messi plus spectators. Argentina had many fine attacking player other than Messi during the last decade. But it often felt like they were little more than cones that, at best, redirect Messi’s passes back to him, incapable of doing anything on their own. Whose fault that is is open to debate. What is not up for debate is that Argentina became a far worse team than they could have been because their gameplan was so Messi-centred. The deeper reasons for this sorry state of affairs probably lie in the complicated and deepy unhealthy relation between Messi and his country. How close Messi came to succeed even under these toxic conditions is testament to his quality.\n\nDue to Messi’s consistency it is hard to point to performances that were absolute highlights of his career. Choose a match in which he was reasonably fit and you can hardly go wrong. Having said that, here is a short and incomplete list of special performances: the 2011 Champions League semi-final first leg against Madrid, both the first and the second leg of the 2011 Supercopa against Madrid, his goal fest against Leverkusen in 2012, the 2015 Copa del Rey final, the 2017 Liga Clasico at the Bernabeu, and the 2018 Champions League match at Tottenham. I remain confident that when you watch these matches, you watch the best player in the history of football.\n\nA Note on the Manager\n\nThis was a two-horse race (with all due respect to Diego Simeone and some others). Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp were clearly the two best managers of the decade. The difference between them was certainly smaller than the difference between them and the rest. Guardiola built two very strong sides and one extraterrestrial team. Klopp built two very strong sides. The decision between them gets even tougher because Klopp’s teams were build with less money and only the last two years of Guardiola’s best team fall within the decade in question. What made me decide in the Catalan’s favor was his overall impact on the game (including Klopp) which arguably surpasses even Klopp’s. And what he made his Barcelona team do ranks as one of the greatest feats in football management in my opinion. Still, they are both modern greats.\n\nA Note on Best Team and Best Club\n\nReal Madrid are the Best Club of the decade because their teams have remained competitive for the whole decade and they dominated the Champions League for many years. The Champions League is increasingly becoming the one competition that all the major clubs focus not only some but most of their attention on. I find this lamentable and much prefer the priority setting of the late 90s and early 2000s (a handful very competitive leagues with multiple top sides, Champions League on par with league title, respectable UEFA Cup). Still, my choices should not reflect my wishes but what has happened. And the Champions League is by now the dominant competition in world football. Hence there is no way past Real Madrid. What should be noted, though, is that ‘Best Club’ does not equate with ‘best run club’ or even a normative evaluation of the club and its influence on the world.\n\nFor all the reasons I have just given the ~2014-2018 Real Madrid side has been the quintessential team of the decade. But I think it was only the second best side. Pep’s Barcelona did not win as much (especially in this decade) but they reached a much higher peak. In this case their superior quality of performance beats Real’s superior quantity of performance.\n\nA Note on Best Match\n\nI take it that “Best Match” can mean multiple things. “Highest quality of football from both sides”, “most memorable match”, “match that encapsulates the most about the football played this decade”, “most aesthetically pleasing match” and “includes best performance by one side” are some possible interpretations. I want to remain open between these meanings. One decade I might choose a match because it tells the story of the football played that decade the best, another decade I choose one with so much drama that it will be talked about in a 100 years time. This decade I choose to go with the match that includes the best performance by a team I have seen in the last ten years. Other interpretations would lead me to choose other matches.\n\nBonus\n\nA look into the parallel universe in which Sergio Ramos makes the first eleven (see Thiago Silva profile):\n\nSergio Ramos\n\nAs I said: centre-back was tough. I have little doubt that Ramos was one of the outstanding central defenders of the last decade and choosing him is therefore not wrong in any strong sense. But is he more deserving of a spot than, say, Bonucci or Thiago Silva? I’m not sure. But the same is true the other way around. Hence my lingering doubts.\n\nThere is at least one thing that separates Sergio Ramos from all other players I chose for the first eleven. Okay, the number of red cards he received is also makes him unique, but I mean one other thing: he never made it into the first eleven of any of my Team of the Season or Team of the Tournament selections. He made the bench of the Team of the Season seven times straight from 2011 to 2018 and the bench of the Team of the Tournament for the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012. When I wrote in the introductory text above that just choosing the players who made the Team of the Season/Tournament selections the most times might be unfair on some players, Sergio Ramos was the player I had in mind. He was, so to speak, never my first choice but so often my second choice that making him my first choice for the decade is in fact justified, or so I think. I said that both quality and quantity of performance matter for this team and Ramos certainly is a player whose quantity of performance (at a high level of quality, of course) gets him the place in the first eleven.\n\nSergio Ramos, just like Hummels, is a defender not without flaws. Sergio Ramos is an outstanding hands-on (quite literally) centre-back. He is dynamic enough to stay very close to attackers, physically intimidating enough not to get bullied by them, and tough enough to bully them himself. I’m sure attackers curse him in the foulest imaginable terms after they had to endure him for 90 minutes and this is an important part of what makes him great. If Hummels and Ramos were an old-school sweeper-marker duo, Ramos would certainly be the man-marker. His defensive weaknesses are that he is prone to the odd lapse of concentration and recurring lapses in discipline (as is evident by his red card tally).\n\nTwo further qualities that give him the edge over the other contenders are his knack for scoring (important) goals and his leadership. 80 goals in this decade alone are an excellent figure for a centre-back, especially given the fact that he wasn’t Real Madrid’s regular penalty taker for most of the time. None of these goals were more important than those in the Champions League finals of 2014 and 2016. Saying that Real wouldn’t have won both games without Ramos is merited. Coming up with crucial goals in important moments is also a sign of his worth as one of Real’s leaders. He has occasionally led his team down by resorting to needless violence, but he arguably is the greatest example of the “don’t fuck with my team or I will do bad things to you” kind of captain previously examplified by players like Oliver Kahn or Roy Keane. I’m not saying that this is how a captain should act, there are many good ways to lead in football (as there are in life). But having this kind of player on your side and especially as a captain can undoubtedly be very valuable for a team and has been very valuable for Real Madrid in the past.\n\nNeither Hummels nor Ramos are in my opinion among the very best central defenders of all time. They are worthy of making a Team of the Decade, none of them are stopgaps. But so were half a dozen other central defenders. Centre-back was tough indeed."
