        "text": "SÃ£o Paulo FC\n\nAs an inaugural member of Clube dos 13, itâs no surprise that SÃ£o Paulo Futebol Clube is considered one of the marquee clubs in Brazilian football. Their trophy room speaks for itself: 6 BrasileirÃ£o titles, 3 Copa Libertadores trophies, and 21 state titles. Unsurprisingly, theyâre also one of the most popular clubs in the country, with more than 16 million fans and an annual revenue of over $100 million.\n\nHistory\n\nFoundation and early exploits\n\nSÃ£o Paulo’s official history begins in 1930, when the club was founded by 60 players, former officials, friends, and members of two older clubs from the area: CA Paulistano and AA das Palmeiras. Due to various internal disagreements and financial issues, the club was disbanded in 1935. The same year, it was reformed under the name SÃ£o Paulo Futebol Clube.\n\nThe 40’s were the first truly successful era for SÃ£o Paulo, which started acquiring star players from competing clubs. The new players settled in fairly quickly, leading the club to five Paulista championship titles by the end of the decade. During this time, the club earned the nickname “The Steamroller.” However, the rise of PelÃ©’s Santos in the 50’s soon relegated SÃ£o Paulo back to the sidelines.\n\nIn 1960, the construction of EstÃ¡dio do Morumbi, officially named EstÃ¡dio CÃ­cero Pompeu de Toledo, was finished. This was a huge stadium planned for 120,000 people. The construction of the stadium continued during the decade and it got even more seats - in the end of the decade it was big enough to held an attendance of 140,000! After later reconstructions, the attendance potential has decreased radically.\n\nThe TelÃª era\n\nDespite winning two BrasileirÃ£o titles in 1977 and 1986, SÃ£o Paulo struggled to assert its dominance for most of the 20th century. However, this changed with the arrival of TelÃª Santana, a respected manager most known for putting together the legendary 1982 and 1986 Brazil national squads. TelÃª ended up staying at the club for five seasons, and this is widely considered to be one of the most successful periods in the history of SÃ£o Paulo.\n\nLed by TelÃª and the influential midfielder RaÃ­, the club claimed its third BrasileirÃ£o title in 1991. The next season, they went one step further and won their first Copa Libertadores title by defeating Newell’s Old Boys in a penalty shoot-out. In 1993, they managed to retain their title by defeating Universidad CatÃ³lica 5-1 in the first leg of the final; the second leg was merely a formality. Unfortunately, TelÃª was soon forced to leave the club due to health issues.\n\nReturn to prominence\n\nFrom 1995 to 2004, SÃ£o Paulo changed no less than 14 managers. Despite these setbacks, the club remained competitive at the highest level, mainly due to the star power of players such as KakÃ¡, Luis Fabiano, and RogÃ©rio Ceni. In 2005, the club finally won its third Copa Libertadores by outlasting AtlÃ©tico Paranaense in the final. With this victory, SÃ£o Paulo became the first Brazilian club to claim three Copa Libertadores titles.\n\nIn 2006, the controversial Muricy Ramalho took over as coach, immediately implementing his trademark defensive style. Though some of the club’s fans didn’t like this change, they couldn’t argue with the results. From 2006 to 2009, SÃ£o Paulo won three consecutive BrasileirÃ£o titles, with Ramalho becoming the first coach to achieve this feat with the same team.\n\nBy Martin Wahl\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrivia\n\nClub nicknames:\n\nTricolor (Tricolour)"
