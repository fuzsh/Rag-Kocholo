        "text": "Football one of the most important and popular sports branches around the world. As is known in general, football is not just football. Football is not a chance to have more fans than other sports branches. Soccer leads to the happiness and sadness of societies. This is not a simple situation and there are many reasons behind the football industry. Not only does soccer serve the body and health, but it also addresses the heart and soul of the humans. The football industry that develops over time includes historical, social, psychological, sociological and political elements. To define the football industry today, it is necessary to know the history of football. The foundations of the modern football school were laid by the British and systematically formed in the second half of the 19th century. The structure of primitive football dates back to 2000s BC. The first form of football is considered as ‘'a game played with a round object''. People used the foot organ in the rules of play in the Roman period and called it '' Harpastum ''. ‘The game remained popular for 700-800 years, but, although the Romans took it to Britain with them, the use of feet was so small as to scarcely be of consequence' (Klacsanzky, 2018). The primitive footballers started the historical process by hitting a round ball with a foot in a rectangular area. They also came together on special occasions to turn football into a social ritual.\n\nThe progressive commercialization of football in Brazil has been accompanied by the emergence of social movements that seek increased visibility and power over decision-making processes in the sport industrial complex. These groups are responding to rapid changes in the political economy of Brazilian sport, particularly football. While many of these processes were well underway before FIFA selected Brazil to host the 2014 World Cup in 2007, the event preparations are accelerating the trends toward corporatization, privatization, and mercantilization of football culture. In the years leading up to the 2014 World Cup, social movements have formed to respond to these changes in the political economy of football. This article will analyze the emergence and decline of the National Fans’ Association (Associação Nacional dos Torcedores, ANT) as an attempt from Brazilian civil society to insert more progressive social agendas into the rapidly neo-liberalizing framework of Brazilian sport. I contextualize this movement with the larger frames of fandom and fans’ rights, the role of activist academics within social movements more generally, and explore the successes and failures of the ANT. The conclusion suggests that even short-lived experiments in the formation of social movements are worthwhile as they can take future shapes and directions that can eventually bring about the desired change.\n\nAccording to current trends in the analysis of new social movements, protests are related to economic issues or social inequalities, particularly those of a religious or ethnic nature which, in turn, produce new communications directed at the political system. The present study aims to determine the relationship between football and the social movements that occurred in Brazil in June 2013, as well as investigate the responses of the political system to these social grievances, centered primarily on the juridification of these social spheres. Thus, it focuses on how the legal and political systems absorb these communications into their self-referential logic. To that end, the methodology used is based on the structural functionalism of Niklas Luhmann and his theory of autopoietic social systems. The results demonstrate that both systems – political and legal – were significantly influenced by football, specifically by the substantial investments allocated to hosting the 2014 World Cup in Brazil which, when contrasted with the low return of public services in the country, reveal the root causes of June 2013. Resumen Según las tendencias actuales en el análisis de los nuevos movimientos sociales, las protestas están relacionadas con cuestiones económicas o desigualdades sociales, en particular las de carácter religioso o étnico que, a su vez, producen nuevas comunicaciones dirigidas al sistema político. Este estudio pretende determinar la relación entre el fútbol y los movimientos sociales que se produjeron en Brasil en junio de 2013, así como investigar las respuestas del sistema político a estas demandas sociales, centradas principalmente en la juridificación de estas esferas\n\nEnglish (Portugues em baixo): One of the grand paradoxes of empire, association football (Soccer), a sport introduced to modern industrial life by Europe’s imperial-colonial elites, has become one of the major social currencies of workers, migrants, and Diasporas throughout the world. Today, excellence as a footballer represents for many a rare means of accessing citizenship, education, employment, leisure and social mobility, especially in Europe. Indeed, the beauty, history and immense popularity of the sport have often overshadowed the industry’s current involvement in the gendering and globalisation of poverty and inequality. This article discusses the confluence of gender, migration, race and international relations, identity discourse and capitalism in the cultural industry of Soccer and addresses the argument that World Soccer, as a Eurocentric economic and cultural exercise, replicates and legitimates the dynamics of the Global Plantation. Keywords: Football, Soccer, Political Economy, Diaspora, Cultural Studies Resumo O futebol profissional, sobre tudo no Sul, representa hoje o acesso à cidadania, educação, emprego e mobilidade social. Mais seria possível que este mesmo fenômeno, o futebol, serve para replicar e legitimar a dinâmica do capitalismo neo-liberal? Este artigo explora o argumento que a popularidade, história e beleza do esporte têm servido para ofuscar o rol do futebol na globalização da pobreza e da desigualdade. A partir desta polêmica, discutimos a confluência do gênero, a migração, o racismo, as relações internacionais e o capitalismo no contexto da indústria cultural do Futebol Global. Palavras-Chave: Futebol, economia política, globalização, diáspora, cultura."
