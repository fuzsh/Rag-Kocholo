I believe the desire to show off his dribbling ability and package of tricks is one of the most important impediments for his performances in the important matches.\n\nThat was a great technical gesture to win a game in the last few minutes. But his match was pretty bad for his standards, he looked little lost, seemed unmotivated and out of the tatics. If I would say more than Neymar, Tuchel is doing a pity job... perhaps it is better back to 4-3-3 with Neymar on the left (wide playmaker), Mbappe on the right (Inside forward) and Cavani or Icardi at the top and 3 midfielders (Gueye, Herrera and Verratti)... that would be a more consistent team.\n\nChilena of Arrascaeta looked superior, but he had more things in his favor, a cross in the measure and a very positive scenario against Ceara.\n\nPD: It is not the first time that the Uruguayan player of Flamengo scored a Puskas level goal.\n\nNeymar's game\n\n@carlito86\n\nMaybe Neymar could catch Zico in the Brazilian all ranking time but it is unlikely due to injuries and unprofesional behaviours, to do that he needs more three years of a elite football (or until Catar 2022) and one Champions League as a key player of the team. His record against the TOP6 NT is similar of Zico's record (5G+5A in 18 matches vs 6G+4A in 19 matches) and he has - fit form - a consistent number of seasons as a TOP10 from at least 2013 until now (Guardian list), so more three seasons would 2013-2022 peak that match Zico's 1974-1983 peak.. Zico had some good season in 1987 (and 1988 too), but Neymar has also 2010-2012 at Santos on his side (3 Paulistas against a strong Corinthians, 1 Libertadores as the key player and top dribbler of that competition with 5.5 completed dribbles per match, 2 Bola de Ouro of Brazilian League (not the same value of before but still), 2 South American POY, U20 South American best player) and some world class seasons (2011 arguably and 2012 imo).\n\nIt is possible, but unlikely at this point imo.\n\nZico was likely a better scorer and even a better pure passer (elite scorer and playmaker), but Neymar is a better dribbler/ball carrier than the former Brazilian ten and a tier 1 playmaker of his generation too... and Neymar is starting to be prolific in front of the goal for PSG (Goals x Chances missed - Sofascore, Expected Goal metric - Understat) he was somewhat wasteful at Barcelona.\n\nWe can compare Neymar with Ronaldinho too.\n\nNeymar, Santos > Ronaldinho, Gremio (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, half 2013 vs 1998, 1999, 2000, half 2001)\n\nNeymar, PSG > Ronaldinho, PSG (2017/18, 2018/19 vs 2001/02, 2002/03)\n\nNeymar, Brazil > Ronaldinho, Brazil (2010-2019 vs 1999-2014)\n\nNeymar, Barcelona < Ronaldinho, Barcelona (2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16, 2016/17 vs 2003/04, 2004/05, 2005/06, 2006/07)\n\nBut I guess the difference between Neymar vs Ronaldinho at Barcelona is smaller than those in Brazilian scenary or with PSG.\n\nThat's league level:\n\nRonaldinho 6.84 Overall Rating, Media DBS 6.49 VS Neymar 6.92 Overall Rating, Media DBS 6.50\n\nThat looks pretty similar in terms of league, but Ronaldinho earn merits to be the key player/focal point of that team, but that doesn't mean Neymar couldn't have done the same if he had a chance, in fact Neymar's best ratings and numbers came with Messi off the field.\n\nWhile we can say that Ronaldinho still has the biggest career peak for now, Neymar's consistency, numbers and performances are superior in more or less similar scenarios. You can say that PSG was not a superteam in 2001 and 2002, I know, but still Ronaldinho should have seemed more dominant playing in that 'farmers league' as they call it, and that wasn't the case at all. Neymar's PSG is also superior to Neymar's Barcelona, I would say in the last two seasons he improved in all areas (even being a better dribbler in the CL).\n\nNumbers with wide assists included (Spanish Wikipedia)\n\nRonaldinho 301 Goals and 219 Assists in 797 Matches (0.65)\n\nNeymar 354 Goals and 195 Assists in 570 Matches (0.96)\n\nIf Neymar needs three more World Class seasons + 1 CL as key player to match Zico, I think he reached Ronaldinho's level or if he still has not reached, it is almost guaranteed that he will reach at some point (probably outperforming if he keeps his focus)... if he will be considered the best in the world i don't know nor if he will win the golden ball but that's based on how things are.\n\nThat's true, doesn't excuse his own performance though which I thought was really bad.\n\nIn his defence Tuchel overprotected him these past few weeks to the point he just looked heavy and rusty, and the change from 4-2-2-2 to 4-3-3 when the former has been working well couldn't have helped him much.\n\nIn a way Neymar is unfortunate rather than having not fulfilled his potential or lacking mentality but only going past the CL QF once so far while playing for Barcelona and PSG doesn't look good.\n\nHe was bad, but coming from a injury with Mbappe playing as the only 9 (the french is better playing with other striker or in the sides) he still manage to put out the best xA + xG of the team. https://fbref.com/en/matches/f778e3...int-Germain-February-18-2020-Champions-League\n\nI mean he just had a bad match (for his standards), unfit, slow, and still managed to get 1.5 xA+xG, with goal, 3 KP, hitting the post etc... imagine him in his best physical conditions.\n\nBtww, PSG was a wrong move, too much pression to won the CL and the only metric they have to measure the sucess of all their investiments, I mean he win nothing playing in the French Ligue from a recognition point of view while suffering many injuries in the process. There is no such thing as a legend in the French league, as Messi is in the Spanish league for example.\n\nPSG should go to a higher regarded league to be better recognized and to have less pressure in the final stages of Europe (instead of leaving your biggest player in the fridge for fear of losing him against the minors but not always lessers opponents in France compared to the rest of Europe).\n\nJadon Sancho 23 Possession losses (relative to 79 touches), 0.1xG + 0.2xA. Neymar 31 Posessions Losses (relative to 90 touches) 1.1xG + 0.4 xG (Goal, hitting the post, 3KP).\n\nNow it is easy to say he wasn't worth it, but if scored 3 Goals (instead of 1 since he had chance to) and Haland didn't scored that improbable shot outside of the area, then things goes different.\n\nIt was a bad match, he looked slow etc, but a bad match for many 'stars' players are much more anonymous and with much less end product than the Neymar's bad matches, think about it.\n\nBtw, Dortmund at home was a favourite against PSG, but according to the expected goals metric PSG was a bit better than the german team. Dortmund isn't a bad team at all in fact, a TOP10 in the Elo method. Liverpool performance vs Atlético was worse than PSG vs Dortmund at the end of the day.\n\n\"Vasconcelos was 10 times better than Neymar\"\n\nIn an interview with 'Placar' magazine, Pelé questioned Neymar's heading ability and said that he has \"shortcomings\" when it comes to defensive work and organisation.\n\n\"Neymar is an attacking player. He plays going forward. He is specific. He doesn't get back, he doesn't organise, he doesn't play the ball out\", said Pelé in the interview, which was published in the November issue of 'Placar'.\n\nThe former striker, who has just turned 75, even claimed that Vasconcelos, who played for Santos in the '50s, \"was without a doubt 10 times better than Neymar\".\n\nAccording to Pelé \"it is difficult to compare so many shortcomings\" between Neymar and the great players of the past who, in his view, were more complete, although he did describe the Barcelona player as the only \"icon\" in the current Brazil side.\n\nhttps://www.marca.com/en/2015/10/30/en/football/international_football/1446232839.html\n\n2019/2020\n\n19 Goals (14 Non-PK Goals) 11 Assists 2124 minutes\n\n1 Assists or 1 Non-PK Goal each 85 minutes\n\n18 Matches 8.60 Rating (Ligue 1, UCL)\n\n_____________________________________-\n\nTotal 2013/14 - 2016/17 Barcelona and Brazil\n\n133 Goals (119 Non-PK Goals) 92 Assists 18619 minutes\n\n1 Assist or Non-PK Goal each 88 minutes\n\n156 Matches 8.20 Rating (La Liga, UCL, CA, WC)\n\n1.08 Goals+Assists per 90 minutes (1.02 NPK Goals+Assists per 90)\n\nTotal 2017/2018 - 2019/2020 PSG and Brazil\n\n80 Goals (61 Non-PK Goals) 50 Assists 8736 minutes\n\n1 Assist or Non-PK Goal each 78.7 minutes\n\n72 Matches 8.65 Rating (Ligue 1, UCL, WC)\n\n1.34 Goals+Assists per 90 minutes (1.14 NPK Goals+Assists per 90)\n\nand Neymar is not only about numbers...\n\nhttps://opta.b-cdn.net/app/uploads/2019/08/1819_progressive_carries_p90_top5-1400x1500.png\n\nhttps://public.tableau.com/profile/...ogressionStyleAcrossEurope/Sheet1?publish=yes\n\nhttps://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-sports-analytics/jsa200432"
