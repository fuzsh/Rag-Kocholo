        "text": "To some it's pizza, to others porn. Or maybe it's chocolate, sex, golf, Texas Fried Chicken, a Coen Brothers film, a Charlie Brooker column, an episode of Blockbusters. You know: the thing that, even when it's bad, it's still good. You might as well chuck in Brazilian footballers. They can all do 1,000 keepy-uppies with a tennis ball while blindfolded and being randomly cattle-prodded about the chapstick, can't they? How bad can anybody who has been capped by Brazil possibly be? Not very.\n\nThere is one exception. Serginho, the huge centre-forward who played in Brazil's sublime 1982 side, is one of the most notorious and derided footballers of all time: the man whose inability to put it in the onion bag made the whole of Brazil cry; the donkey who infiltrated Brazil's passing carousel and, by common consensus, cost them the World Cup. But this goes deeper than the mere issue of success and failure. Given the almost overwhelmingly artistic nature of that side, Serginho is also seen a cultural vandal: the man who peed on the Mona Lisa; the man who added a phat beat to Beethoven's 5th; the man who made Romeo and Juliet a pair of chain-smoking chavs from Sittingbourne.\n\nThe most withering verdict came from the former Brazil manager Joao Saldanha. When Serginho was substituted against New Zealand, he said: \"Now the ball is round again.\" It's a delicious line, but it doesn't mean it's right. That said, criticism came from everywhere, although in this country much of it emerged after the event: Hugh McIlvanney wrote in The Observer in 1985 that \"[Serginho] probably meant the difference between winning and not winning the championship\". In 1997, in the Sunday Times, our Kevin McCarra called him a \"talentless brute\". Even this nugget, working on the not unreasonable assumption that other people knew more than him, called Serginho a \"club-footed lummox\" in a recent blog.\n\nA study of all five of Brazil's World Cup games in their entirety suggests that this is an extremely harsh verdict. In technical terms, Serginho was palpably the least accomplished of that sexiest of attacking sextets, but then a 7ft fella isn't going to win the world's tallest man competition. These things are relative. In the Guardian in 1983, Patrick Barclay wrote that Careca \"replaces the lumbering (a comparative term) Serginho\". Russell Milton, a journeyman who played with Socrates and Serginho in the late 1980s, noted that: \"People said he was a donkey, and in that Brazil side he probably was, but he had awesome touch and ability.\"\n\nIt is increasingly hard to escape the conclusion that here was a very good player asked to play a hugely important and slightly unfamiliar role at short notice (the first choices, Reinaldo and Careca, were injured; Careca knacked himself just four days before Brazil's first game) who probably performed a fraction below his best. He certainly didn't finish as well as he could – although there was only one gruesome miss, against Italy – but in a sense that was a red herring, as it obscured his more important role as a Heskey-like pivot. Overall he scored two goals in five games and made a couple as well. He was just like the thousands of players who have had an average to good World Cup.\n\nYet none of the others played for Brazil's 1982 side. When a side as accomplished as that – and if you aren't familiar with them, stop pushing that paper and get on YouTube, because they are like nothing you've ever seen – fails to win the World Cup, a scapegoat is necessary. Yet Brazil scored 15 goals in five games, including two in the fateful defeat to Italy, so to blame any segment of their attack is to embrace a most perverse logic. The problem, please, surely lay with the defence and goalkeeper, yet their eccentricities and inadequacies were largely indulged because, well, this is Brazil and they never have good defenders. What insulting poppycock.\n\nIt wasn't Serginho's fault that Brazil kept only one clean sheet in five games, against New Zealand. It wasn't his fault that Valdir Peres kept goal like Edward Scissorhands. It wasn't his fault that Toninho Cerezo misinterpreted the notion of an homage to the 1970s side and played a staggeringly negligent square-pass to gift Italy a goal. It wasn't his fault that, instead of pushing out at a corner as he was supposed to do, Junior shuffled away from the near post with all the urgency of a slacker on his way to the dentist, thus playing Paolo Rossi onside to score the winning goal. It wasn't his fault that, when Brazil needed a goal in the last 15 minutes against Italy, he wasn't on the pitch because he had been taken off at 2-2. It wasn't even his fault that he inspired a mother to inflict the name Serginho van Dijk on her son.\n\nSerginho's name soon became apparent in 1982. By the start of the second half of their first game against the USSR, four people on the BBC's coverage – the co-commentator Bobby Charlton, Scotland's Alan Brazil in the token from-the-camp interview, and Lou Macari and Lawrie McMenemy in the studio – had gone out of their way to praise him. Charlton called him a \"super player\"; Macari said he \"looks great\".\n\nPress reports of the time weren't quite so generous, but nor were they particularly damning. In the Guardian, Patrick Barclay legitimately noted a number of missed half-chances against the USSR, but then he also said that Serginho \"flowered\" in the 4-1 win over Scotland. A day after that game, Hugh McIlvanney wrote in the Observer that: \"Serginho ... is as yet an enigma. He has been admirably game in the face of buffetings and often tricky on the ball and against Scotland it was his sensibly contrived pass (allied with Scottish neglect) that freed Eder for his spectacular goal. But at other times he has looked clumsy and unsure when in killing positions around the six-yard box. The trouble is that he tries to do things too well.\"\n\nWouldn't you if you were in such company? If Serginho didn't play quite as well as he might, then that was probably down to an asphyxiating combination of perfectionism and an inferiority complex. That's understandable. If you pulled [insert name of celebrity crush du jour here], would you be able to do that special little thing you do with the same elan? Course not: you'd be terrified. And so Serginho wasn't quite himself at times; he seemed diffident – not in keeping with a man who has quite the rap sheet for bursts of aggression – and his finishing, so trusty at club level, seemed afflicted by a psychosomatic frailty.\n\nDespite that, there were some striking contributions. The goal against Argentina sealed that game, while he also won the free-kick for the first goal by duping the streetwise Daniel Passarella. He created Eder's goal against Scotland with a smart turn and insouciant nutmeg. Such subtlety wasn't Serginho's forte – though, again, he was only damned by his relative ability in this area – and yet, paradoxically, his role was arguably the subtlest of all. While the rat-a-tat attacks of Zico, Socrates, Falcao, Eder and Cerezo immediately caught the eye and the hairs on the back of the neck, Serginho's job was to smooth those movements with often invisible contributions. It was a role also played by the equally derided Stéphane Guivarc'h in France's World Cup-winning team of 1998. Guivarc'h was gauche at times, but that did not especially matter in the context of his position, and his coach Aimé Jacquet – who, let's be honest here, knows more about football than us – remains incredulous that he is perceived as a flop in that tournament.\n\nIn Inverting the Pyramid, Jonathan Wilson argues convincingly that, in the modern game, scoring goals need not be a centre-forward's principal purpose. The international ostracism of Michael Owen lends huge weight to such a view. Brazil had eight different scorers in their five games; why would they want a specialist goalscorer? If we accept that, it is not entirely mischievous to suggest that Serginho was 15 or 20 years ahead of his time.\n\nThe idea that Brazil just rocked up and played is romantic bunkum. Even they need structure and discipline. There was a palpable co-ordination to their movements, particularly in the way the midfielders exchanged positions. In what often amounted to a 2-7-1 formation, given the adventure of the full-backs, Serginho became the faciliator. His role was precise and rigid, a nod to futebol de resultados even though most would like to believe that Brazil played futebol d'arte. He defended from the front (his goal against Argentina stems directly from him dispossessing Daniel Passarella); he dragged defenders across the field, into dark alleys where they could not see what was going on behind them; he used his marker as a La-Z-Boy, easing into him while waiting for the midfield cavalry to arrive. Routine stuff these days; less so in 1982.\n\nMost of his hold-up play was textbook; there were some clunky moments, but to criticise a target man for that is like criticising a fluffer for going downstairs. It's part of the job description. Watch, for example, the way he creates a chance for Cerezo in the early minutes of the Scotland game. Or look at the beautifully aware touch from which Socrates volleys over against Argentina. Serginho also gave Brazil another way of playing in emergencies: at 1-1 against Russia, for example, Eder speared over an angled cross that Serginho won regally at the far post, heading it down for Zico to stab wide from four yards. The exasperating thing is that, when the big emergency came, against Italy, he wasn't on the pitch: Tele Santana had replaced him with Paulo Isidoro and put Socrates up front, a move that arguably weakened Brazil's midfield and attack to a fatal degree.\n\nIn truth Serginho had his one poor game against Italy. He scuffed a one-on-one miserably wide in the 12th minute – although given that Socrates equalised almost immediately, it is legitimate to argue that it had no impact on the game whatsoever. Besides, Socrates and Romario missed open goals in equally big games in 1986 and 1994. It happens.\n\nIt is unfair to say that miss was representative of Serginho, because he was a goal machine domestically. When he scored 32 goals in the 1977 Campeonato Paulista, only Pele had hit more in one season for 20 years. He also recovered from the World Cup to top score the following season with his new club Santos, a bravura, granite-stoned response to the ridicule enveloping him. He scored the winner for them in the 1984 final, and the decisive goal in Sao Paulo's victory over Ponte Preta in the 1981 final. On fifa.com, he is listed as one of Sao Paulo's 11 legendary players. For Brazil he scored an entirely respectable 8 goals in 20 games, which doesn't compare particularly unfavourably to, say, Careca's 29 in 60 (or 9.67 in 20). This wasn't some bloke who lucked out, or some punter who won Jim'll Fix It. He was a player.\n\n\"He was a fearsome prospect: huge, physical, aggressive,\" says Tim Vickery, the BBC's South American expert. \"Knowledgeable people I talk to in Brazil say that he was no joke at all – play with two wingers and get service into the box and he would attack it and score goals. What he couldn't do, though, was combine with the super-skilled midfield that Brazil played in 1982 – he simply didn't have the technique for it. Although he wasn't first choice, I think we have to blame Tele for asking a player to carry out a function that he wasn't cut out for.\" A function he performed, at the very least, adequately. Even though he wasn't especially good, he still wasn't bad. And he was a lot better than that defence."
