My Personal Football Coach is a programme allowing players to train at home with guidance against a consistent and technical development programme.\n\nIt’s definitely an app we would recommend”.\n\n“I’ve been working with Saul since I was 14, he’s really helped me on my journey to the Premier League. Saul know’s what it takes for players to get to the highest level”\n\nToby started using the My Personal Football Coach App in 2020 and subscribed to the Dynamic Ball Mastery age 8-11 training programme.\n\nWe really liked the way the wide selection of training programmes helped develop Toby’s ball mastery and other areas of his game away from academy football training.\n\nToby had always found the sessions very enjoyable and beneficial and has recently subscribed to the midfielder specific training programme.\n\nWe would highly recommend subscribing."
