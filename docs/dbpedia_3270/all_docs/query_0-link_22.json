        "text": "Ryan Joseph Giggs OBE is a Welsh football coach and former player. He was most recently the manager of the Wales national team. He is also a co-owner of Salford City. Giggs played his entire professional career for Manchester United and briefly served as the club's interim manager after the sacking of David Moyes in April 2014. Giggs is regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation.\n\nThe son of rugby union and Wales international rugby league footballer Danny Wilson, Giggs was born in Cardiff but moved to Manchester at the age of six when his father joined Swinton RLFC. Predominantly a left midfielder, he began his career with Manchester City, but joined Manchester United on his 14th birthday in 1987. He made his professional debut for the club in 1991 and spent the next 23 years in the Manchester United first team. At the end of the 2013-14 season, he was named as Manchester United's interim player-manager following the sacking of David Moyes. He was named as assistant manager under Moyes' permanent replacement, Louis van Gaal, on 19 May 2014; he retired from playing the same day holding the club record for competitive appearances - 963. At international level, Giggs played for the Wales national team 64 times between 1991 and 2007 and was named as the captain of the Great Britain team that competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics. He is one of only 28 players to have made over 1,000 career appearances.\n\nGiggs is one of the most decorated footballers of all time. During his time at United, he won 13 Premier League winner's medals- more than any other player in history, four FA Cup winner's medals, three League Cup winner's medals, two UEFA Champions League winner's medals, a FIFA Club World Cup winners medal, an Intercontinental Cup winner's medal, a UEFA Super Cup winner's medal and nine FA Community Shield winner's medals. Manchester United and Liverpool are the only clubs in English football history to have won more league championships than Giggs. Giggs captained United on numerous occasions, particularly in the 2007-08 season when regular captain Gary Neville was ruled out with various injuries.\n\nGiggs also has many personal achievements. He was the first player in history to win two consecutive PFA Young Player of the Year awards (1992 and 1993), though he did not win the PFA Player of the Year award until 2009. He was the only player to play in each of the first 22 seasons of the Premier League, as well as the only player to score in each of the first 21 seasons. He was elected into the PFA Team of the Century in 2007, the Premier League Team of the Decade in 2003, as well as the FA Cup Team of the Century. Giggs holds the record for the most assists in Premier League history, with 162. He was named as BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2009. In addition to the many honors Giggs has received within football, he was appointed an OBE in the Queen's 2007 Birthday Honours List for his services to football.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on February 5, 1985, in Madeira, Portugal to Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro and José Diniz Aveiro. Cristiano has an elder brother, Hugo and two elder sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia. His name was inspired by the former US-president, Ronald Reagan, whom his father was influenced by.\n\nThe island of Madeira was also the place where Cristiano first learned to master his skills as a footballer. He spent his early years playing for his local team, Nacional, and by the time he turned 12 years old, he already made his name for himself as one of Madeira's top footballers . It wasn't long before he started to catch the attention of other big Portuguese clubs. Among Sporting was Benfica, a team Cristiano and his father followed as a young boy. However he eventually chose to play for Sporting which was a team his mother loved and followed as she was growing up, to play with the likes of Figo was the dream for her son.\n\nHe was then spotted by former Liverpool manager, Gerard Houllier at the age of sixteen but Liverpool had no intentions to sign him at that time because they thought he was too young and he needed more time to develop his skills. However, in the summer of 2003, when Sporting played against Manchester United and defeated them, Cristiano caught the attention of Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nRonaldo became Manchester United's first-ever Portuguese player. Initially, he requested for the number 28 as his jersey number because he didn't feel that he could live up to the pressure of previous players such as George Best and David Beckham who wore the number 7 jersey.\n\nThe year 2006 to 2008 proved to be a rather controversial year for the star. In the 2006 World Cup, Cristiano faced accusations regarding his sportsmanship. In a quarter-final match against England, he was heavily criticized for sending of his club team mate, Wayne Rooney who was playing for the England team. It wasn't too long until fans started accepting Cristiano again. In 2007, he won PFA Young Player of the Year, PFA Player of the Year, PFA Fans' Player of the Year, Portuguese Footballer of the Year, FWA Footballer of the Year, Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year and Manchester United's Players' Player of the Year. The year 2008 also saw him taking back the PFA Player Of The Year Award for the second time running. That same year, Ronaldo also had to deal with controversies regarding his club transfer to Spanish giants, Real Madrid. He eventually chose to stay with Manchester United and stressed to the public that he had no intentions of leaving the club.\n\nCristiano now lives with his cousin, Nuno and his brother in law Ze. When he is not on the field, he is a very family oriented person. Growing up, when he was about to choose football as his career, he said that it was very difficult for him as that would mean lesser time with his family, especially his mother, whom he says play a major role in his life.\n\nDuring his free time, Cristiano enjoys cooking. He mentioned in an interview that he usually cooks before he leaves for his soccer practice. Because he is constantly training, Cristiano rarely has time to watch TV. If he does get the time to watch, he says he loves watching one of the local Portuguese game show which is mostly about trivia questions. Cristiano is an avid learner and he takes interest in learning new things everyday. Among Cristiano's biggest pet peeves are smoking, people who don't make an effort and dishonesty.\n\nWhen the tsunami hit South East Asia, Cristiano flew to Indonesia to help those in need. He auctioned off a few stuff to help raise funds for charity. He hopes to get involved in more charity projects in the future because he believes his star status will help him reach out to others for help.\n\nKarim Mostafa Benzema (born 19 December 1987) is a French professional footballer who plays as a striker for Spanish club Real Madrid and the France national team. He has been described as an \"immensely talented striker\" who is \"strong and powerful\" and \"a potent finisher from inside the box\".\n\nBenzema was born in the city of Lyon and began his football career with local club Bron Terraillon. In 1996, he joined Olympique Lyonnais, and subsequently came through the club's youth academy. Benzema made his professional debut in the 2004-05 season and appeared sporadically in his first three seasons as Lyon won three titles in that span. In the 2007-08 season, Benzema became a starter and had a breakthrough year scoring over 30 goals as Lyon won its seventh straight league title. For his performances, he was named the National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP) Ligue 1 Player of the Year and named to the organization's Team of the Year. Benzema was also the league's top scorer and given the Bravo Award by Italian magazine Guerin Sportivo. After another season at Lyon, in July 2009, Benzema moved to Real Madrid in a transfer fee worth over EUR35 million ($50 million), and signed a six-year contract. After struggling to establish himself in his debut season with the club, in the ensuing two seasons, Benzema reached prominence, scoring 32 goals en route to helping Real Madrid win the Copa del Rey in 2011 and the 2011-12 edition of La Liga. He has been named French Player of the Year three times for his performances in 2011, 2012 and 2014.\n\nBenzema is a former French youth international and has represented his nation from under-17 level onwards. Prior to playing for the senior team, he played on the under-17 team that won the 2004 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. Benzema made his senior international debut in March 2007 in a friendly match against Austria, scoring in a 1-0 win. Benzema has earned over 80 caps and represented France at three major international tournaments: the 2008 and 2012 editions of the UEFA European Championship and the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\n\nÁngel Fabián Di María (born 14 February 1988) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays for Paris Saint-Germain and the Argentina national team. He can play as either a winger or attacking midfielder.\n\nAfter beginning his career with Rosario Central, Di María moved to Europe in 2007 to play for Benfica, earning a EUR25 million move to Real Madrid three years later. He played a major role in the club's 2011-12 La Liga triumph. After winning the UEFA Champions League with Real Madrid, he signed for Manchester United in 2014 for a British record £59.7 million, but joined PSG a year later for around £44 million.\n\nA full international for Argentina since 2008, Di María has earned over 90 caps for his country. He scored the goal that won the country gold at the 2008 Olympics, and has also represented them at three FIFA World Cups and four Copa América tournaments, reaching the final of the 2014 World Cup, the 2015 Copa América, and the Copa América Centenario.\n\nDi María was born on 14 February 1988 in Rosario, Argentina, as one of three children of Miguel and Diana, and grew up in Perdriel. As an infant, he was unusually active, and on recommendation of a doctor was signed up for football at age three. He also helped his parents with their work at a local coal yard along with his two sisters, Vanesa and Evelyn. Due to the low income his family earned, purchasing football boots and keeping up with Di María's hobby was difficult for his parents. He considers himself to be a \"family man\" and has used a significant amount of his salary to \"give back\" to his family. After being transferred to Benfica, he asked his father not to work anymore and purchased a house for his parents and sisters.\n\nDi María was transferred to Portuguese side Benfica in July 2007, where he played as a winger. Benfica paid Rosario Central EUR6 million for 80% of his sports rights and 50% of sports right of Andrés Díaz. Later, in August 2008, the Portuguese club paid an extra EUR2 million for the remaining 20%, but re-sold 10% to GestiFute. Di María was signed as a replacement for Benfica's departing captain, Simão, who joined Atlético Madrid earlier that summer.\n\nDi María signed a new deal with Benfica in October 2009, adding three more years to his current deal, which was to last until 30 June 2015 with his release fee set at a minimum of EUR40 million. Later that month, he was backed by Diego Maradona to become \"Argentina's next superstar\".\n\nOn 27 February 2010, Di María scored his first hat-trick in a classic 4-0 win against Leixões. The next day, he made the headlines as \"Magic Tri María\" in all sports newspapers in Portugal.\n\nOn 28 June 2010, Real Madrid posted on their website that they had come to terms with Benfica for the transfer of Di María. He signed a five-year contract for EUR25 million, plus EUR11 million in incentives, as announced one day later by the Portuguese Stock Exchange regulating entity. On 7 July 2010, Di María arrived to Madrid directly from Buenos Aires, and passed the medical test on 8 July.\n\nHe made his debut on 4 August 2010 in a friendly match against Mexican side América, which Real Madrid won 3-2. On 22 August, Di María scored his first goal in another friendly away against Hércules, which Real Madrid won 1-3. In the last match of the pre-season, on 24 August, after an individual play described as a \"magic moment\", he opened the score of the 2-0 win against Peñarol for the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu.\n\nHis league debut came on 29 August in a 0-0 draw against Mallorca. On 18 September, Di María scored his first league goal for Real Madrid in their 1-2 away win over Real Sociedad. Ten days later, he scored his first goal in the UEFA Champions League against Auxerre in a 0-1 victory. He scored a controversial first goal against Sevilla on 19 December. Days later, Di María assisted Karim Benzema's two goals and Cristiano Ronaldo's goal in an astonishing 8-0 drubbing of Levante on 22 December. In the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 against Lyon, he scored the third and final goal in a 3-0 win to send Real Madrid through to the quarter-finals for the first time in seven years.\n\nDi María scored Real Madrid's third goal during their first-leg Champions League quarter-final victory over Tottenham Hotspur on 5 April 2011. On 20 April, he was sent off in the 31st minute of extra time in the Copa del Rey final against rivals Barcelona. Real Madrid won the match 1-0, the lone goal of the match (in the 13th minute of extra time) being a header from Cristiano Ronaldo, which came from his cross, thus obtaining his first honour with Real Madrid.\n\nOn 26 August 2014, Di María signed a five-year deal with Manchester United for a transfer fee of £59.7 million, one of the most expensive transfers of all time and the highest fee ever paid by a British club at the time. He inherited the number 7 shirt at United, which was previously worn by club legends such as George Best, Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nOn 2 August, it was reported Di María would undergo a medical ahead of a move to Paris Saint-Germain, and four days later, Manchester United confirmed he had been sold to the French champions for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around £44 million, signing a four-year contract.\n\nXavier Hernández Creus , known as Xavi, is a Spanish professional football manager and former player who is the manager of La Liga club Barcelona. Widely considered one of the greatest midfielders of all time, Xavi was renowned for his passing, vision, ball retention, and positioning.\n\nXavi joined La Masia, the Barcelona youth academy, at age 11, and made his first-team debut against Mallorca in August 1998. In all, he played 767 official matches, a former club record-now held by Lionel Messi-and scored 85 goals. Xavi is the first player in the club's history to play 150 European and FIFA Club World Cup matches combined. With Barcelona, Xavi won eight La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions League titles. Xavi came third in the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year, followed by third place for its successor award, the FIFA Ballon d'Or, in 2010 and 2011. In 2011, he was runner up to Messi for the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award. In 2015, he departed Barcelona for Al Sadd, where he won four trophies before retiring in 2019. He is one of the few recorded players to have made over 1,000 professional career appearances.\n\nFollowing retirement, it was announced in May 2019 that Xavi would take over as manger of Al Sadd on a two-year contract. Over the course of the 97 days he was in charge, spanning two and a half years, Xavi led the club to win 7 trophies, including the coveted Qatar Cup in the Qatar Stars League. In November 2021, it was announced Xavi would return to his former club Barcelona as the new manager replacing Ronald Koeman, on contract until June 2024. At the time, the club was struggling both competitively and economically. However, after a difficult first few months, Xavi revitalized the club and turned around Barcelona's form with the implementation of structure and new guidelines, while also playing a vital role in the signing of new players to strengthen the squad. When Xavi first took charge, the club was in ninth position in LaLiga, but by the end of the 2021-22 season, he led Barcelona to a second-placed finish.\n\nXavi continued to succeed in his role as manager during the 2022 summer transfer window by orchestrating the signing of world-renowned footballers, such as Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha, Jules Koundé, Andreas Christensen, and Franck Kessié. In January 2023, Barcelona won their first title under Xavi, following a 3-1 victory against Real Madrid in the Supercopa de España Final. Xavi would go on to win the 2022-23 LaLiga with Barcelona after amassing an astonishing 88 points in 33 games, sitting 13 points above second-placed Atlético Madrid. Xavi is now regarded by many as a hero within the club for taking charge when Barcelona was arguably at one of the club's lowest points and quickly achieving extraordinary success as a manger in a short period of time.\n\nLuka Modric is a Croatian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Spanish club Real Madrid and captains the Croatia national team. He plays mainly as a central midfielder, but can also play as an attacking midfielder or as a defensive midfielder, usually deployed as a deep-lying playmaker. He is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation, and the greatest Croatian footballer of all-time.\n\nBorn in Zadar, Modric's childhood coincided with the Croatian War of Independence which displaced his family. In 2002, he was signed by Dinamo Zagreb at age 16, after showing promise with his hometown club NK Zadar's youth team. He continued his development in Zagreb, before spells on loan to Zrinjski Mostar and Inter Zapresic. He made his debut for Dinamo in 2005 and won three consecutive league titles and domestic cups, being named the Prva HNL Player of the Year in 2007. In 2008, he moved to Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur for a club-record transfer fee of £16.5 million, where he led Spurs to their first UEFA Champions League appearance in almost 50 years, reaching the quarter-finals of the 2010-11 tournament.\n\nIn the summer of 2012, Modric joined Real Madrid for a £30 million transfer fee. There he became a key contributor and helped the team win La Décima and was selected for the 2013-14 Champions League squad of the season. After Zinedine Zidane took over Madrid, Modric was critical to three consecutive Champions League titles from 2015-16 to 2017-18, each time being voted into the squad of the season. He has won 17 major trophies at Real Madrid including four UEFA Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, one Copa del Rey and four FIFA Club World Cup titles. He won the La Liga Award for \"Best Midfielder\" in 2016 for the second time, and the UEFA Club Football Award for \"Best Midfielder\" in 2017 and 2018. In 2015, he became the first Croatian player to be included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI, in which he was regularly included until 2019, as well in the UEFA Team of the Year between 2016 and 2018. In 2018, Modric became the first Croatian player to win the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award, and by winning The Best FIFA Men's Player and Ballon d'Or awards, he became the first player other than Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo to claim the awards in more than a decade. In 2019, was awarded the Golden Foot award for career results and personality.\n\nModric made his international debut for Croatia against Argentina in March 2006, and scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Italy. He has since anchored Croatia's \"second Golden Generation\", participating in every major tournament Croatia has qualified for, including the UEFA Euro 2008, 2012, and 2016, as well the 2006, 2014, and 2018 FIFA World Cup. At UEFA Euro 2008, he was selected for the Team of the Tournament, becoming only the second Croatian to ever achieve this honour. Following group stage eliminations in his first two World Cups, Modric led Croatia to the 2018 World Cup Final, and he received the Golden Ball award for Best Player of the Tournament. Furthermore, he has been named the Croatian Footballer of the Year a record eight times between 2007-2019.\n\nToni Kroos (born 4 January 1990) is a German professional footballer who plays for Spanish club Real Madrid and the German national team. Kroos plays mainly as a central midfielder, but is also used as a defensive midfielder or deep-lying play-maker. He is known for his vision, creativity, passing, and set-piece ability, and is widely considered to be one of the best midfielders in the world.\n\nBorn in the small German city of Greifswald, Kroos began his senior club career playing for Bayern Munich, where he made his debut at age 17 in 2007. He was sparingly used, and quickly opted for an 18-month loan spell at fellow Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen, where he became a key contributor, and returned to his parent club with an increased profile in 2010. Kroos then became indispensable for the Bavarian club, and was critical to several successes, including two consecutive league titles, a UEFA Champions League title, and two DFB-Pokal titles. He was also voted into the league team of the season three times, before moving to Spain to join La Liga side Real Madrid in 2014, for a fee of EUR25 million.\n\nIn Madrid, Kroos became a vital part of the team under head coaches Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane, and he helped Real win three consecutive Champions League titles from 2015-16 to 2017-18, each time being selected in the squad of the season. He also contributed heavily as the club captured a La Liga title in 2016-17, when he was also chosen for the team of the season. Kroos was also voted into both the FIFPro World XI and UEFA Team of the Year in 2016 and 2017, and has won further championships, including five FIFA Club World Cup titles. In 2018, Kroos was named German Footballer of the Year by a selection of journalists and the publication kicker.\n\nAfter a successful youth international career, in which he won the Golden Player award and finished as top goalscorer in the UEFA European Under-17 Championship in 2006, and won the Golden Ball award for best player at the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2007, Kroos made his senior debut for Germany in 2010. He scored his first international goal in 2011 in a friendly match against Poland, and has since been key to the national team, appearing in every major tournament Germany has qualified for, beginning with the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In 2014, Kroos led his country to victory in that year's World Cup, where he was the top assist provider and was selected to the All-Star team and Dream Team. He was also named German Player of the Year. At UEFA Euro 2016, Kroos was voted to the Team of the Tournament."
