However, by summer of 2013, he decided to switch his commitment to Spain after becoming Spanish citizens, which caused a controversy in Brazil. He is believed to be the first Brazilian to turn his back against his country.\n\nDiego Costa\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nDanilo Clementino (Equatorial Guinea), Rodrigo Moreno (Spain), Zague (Mexico), Sinha (Mexico), Agenor Muniz (Australia), Amauri (Italy), Dino da Costa (Italy), Eder (Italy), Paulo Rink (Germany), Kevin Kuranyi (Germany), Thiago Cionek (Poland), Roger Guerreiro (Poland), Phan Van Santos (Vietnam), Francileudo Santos (Tunisia), Francileudo Santos (Tunisia), Cristiano Cordeiro (Hong Kong), Alex (Japan), Ruy Ramos (Japan), Wagner Lopes (Japan), Egmar Goncalves (Singapore), Lucio Wagner (Bulgaria), Marcos Pizzelli (Armenia), Rodrigo (Spain), Catanha (Spain), Heraldo Bezerra (Spain), Rodrigo Tabata (Qatar), Montezine (Qatar), Renan Bressan (Belarus), Igor de Camargo (Belgium), Edivaldo Hermoza (Bolivia), Alexandre Guimarães (Costa Rica), Leandro Augusto (Mexico), Julinho (Peru), Ari (Russia), Leandro(Hungary) , Eilkson (China), Benny Feilhaber (USA), Edmar (Ukraine), Marlos (Ukraine), Junior Moraes (Ukraine), Ernani Pereira (Azerbaijan), Pavlos Papaioannou (Greece), Adrianinho (Austria), Marcelo Martins (Bolivia), Lúcio Wagner (Bulgaria), Cicinho (Bulgaria).\n\nSquad Explanation\n\n-- I redid the team in August, 2023.\n\n-- Most players I selected moved to their adoptive country for \"football reasons\". What do I meant by \"football reasons'? The players came to those countries as professional footballers. They were in that country for football only. For example, Kevin Kuranyi moved to Germany for reasons other than football. He would still be living in Germany if he is a baker, a lawyer, a teacher, etc. He is not in Germany for football reasons. I tried to select players who went to those countries for \"football reasons\".\n\n-- Anfilogino Guarisi, Angelo Sormani and Jose Altafini were of Italian ancestry, but they went to Italy for \"football reasons\".\n\n-- In 2021, Italy used three Brazilian-born footballers as they won the Euro 2020. Jorghinho, Emerson Palieri and Raphael Toloi all played a part in the tournament. In 2016, Pepe was named the Man of the Match in the Final as Portugal beat France for the title. Spain won the Euro 2012 without a Brazilian born players, but Senna was their key player in 2008.\n\n-- Senna, Deco and Pepe would also have contributed to Brazil if they never turned down Brazil. Deco probably would have limited chances playing for Brazil because Brazil had plenty of attacking midfielders during his prime. Pepe was around the same age as Dante, Thiago Silva and David Luiz. He would probably make it with Brazil even through those Brazilian defenders were very good. Of course, Brazil badly needed Diego Costa in 2014. The other candidates for Brazil's number 9 position were very weak in that period. Fred was injury prone at that point. As of 2021 when I edited this team, Jorginho probably would be a standout for the Seleção. He was voted the UEFA Player of the year in 2021.\n\n-- Andreas Pereira is the first foreign-born player to play for Brazil in a 100 years. I did not know where to put this in a blog.\n\n-- In 2003, Togo naturalised five Brazilians who played in the 2004 Nations Cup qualification games. None of whom were related to the country. Soon after, Qatar also tried to naturalise German-based trio of Ailton, Dede and Leandro. It was reported that Qatar offered Ailton one million dollars to play for them. FIFA quickly passed a new nationality to stop their progress. Players must have clear connection to a country for them to play for them.\n\n-- Before I created this team, I thought this team would be better than a team with Argentine-born footballers who played for other national teams because it seemed that many more Brazilian footballers have played for other national teams. However, the \"Argentine\" team consisted of players such as Alfredo Di Stefano, Omar Sivori, Luis Monti, etc. The Italian \"Oriundi\" policy naturalised many Argentine star players before FIFA banned the switch of national allegiance. Meanwhile, Argentina did not select overseas players, which made it easier for Italy to naturalise the top Italian Argentine players.\n\n--Anfilogino Guarisi helped Italy to win the World Cup in 1934. He was the first Brazilian to win the trophy. Jose Altafini \"Mazzola\" had won a World Cup with Brazil in 1958. Senna, Pepe and Jorginho won the European Championship for Spain, Portugal and Italy respectively.\n\nJose Altafini \"Mazzola\"\n\n-- This team had too many forwards. It lacked one more good central defender.\n\n-- No Brazilian-born player ever capped for England and France. All other countries who had won the World Cup had capped at least one Brazilian-born player.\n\nGoalkeepers\n\n-- Guilherme Marinato of Russia was the only Brazilian-born goalkeepers I could find to have played international football regularly for a better football nation.\n\n-- Mauricio Viana is an exceptional case. He remained an uncapped players at the senior level, but he sat on the bench for Chile. He also played at the youth level for Chile. But he is not cap-tied to Chile. I selected him because the other option at goalkeeper is Phan Van Santos who played for Vietnam.\n\n-- In 2023, I discovered Alexander Negri. He was called up by Cyprus for a Euro 2016 qualifier against Bosnia and Herzegovina in October 2015. He was also represented Brazil at the 2003 Gold Cup. He was a backup to Heurelho Gomes. The team was actually Brazil's Olympic team playing in a senior tournament as a guest team. Thiago Motta played on that team. I put him on the team in place of Danilo Clementino (Equatorial Guinea).\n\n-- Danilo was a journeyman in Brazil, mainly in the lower division. He was one of the players recruited by Brazilian coach Antônio Dumasto to play for Equatorial Guinea in 2006. He had no ties with the country. He had not even played club football there. He had 19 caps with them.\n\nDefenders\n\n-- With 134 caps for Portugal, Pepe had done well for his adopted country. He was the Man of the Match as Portugal won the Euro 2016 trophy. For club football, he was well-decorated with Real Madrid. In his prime, Donato was one of the best defenders in La Liga and a key player for \"Súper Dépor\". Both Donato and Pepe would have made it to the Brazilian national team. Pepe was around the same age as Dante, Thiago Silva and David Luiz. He and Thiago Silva would have starred for Brazil. Perhaps, Brazil's exit in the 2014 World Cup Fimals would be different. Donato's prime would have played around the same time as Aldair, Carlos Mozer, Ricardo Gomez, Ricardo Rocha, Júlio César and Mauro Galvão. He would have contributed to Brazil, but his career would have been limited.\n\n-- There are many attackers and midfielders eligible for the team, but there ain't many center-backs. Tony Menezes was also eligible, but he went to Canada for non-football reasons. Marcus Túlio Tanaka (Japan) was born in Brazil of Japanese ancestry. He moved to Japan as a teenager for non-football reason. So I excluded him. Cristiano Cordeiro (Hong Kong) was also considered as he was one of the few center-backs available. In 2021, Rafael Tolói was capped by Italy. I replaced Ernani Pereira (Azerbaijan) with him. My problem with centerbacks solved. Rafael Tolói along with Pepe, Donato and Mehmet Aurelio made a great corps of central defenders. He could also play rightback.\n\n-- Mehmet Aurelio was actually a defensive midfielder, but I took him over Thiago Cionek (Poland). Cionek was mainly a Serie B player in Italy after he became \"Polish\". Mehmet Aurelio was a star with Fenerbahçe.\n\nMehmet Aurelio\n\n-- Bruno Alvas' father was a former Brazilian footballer, but he was born and grew up in Portugal. Zague (Mexico) played youth football in Brazil before going to Mexico, but Bruno Alvas' football journey started in Portugal. I ruled him ineligible for this team because he was not a naturalised citizen of Portugal.\n\n-- Marcos Gonzalez (Chile) was born in Brazil of Chilean parents. He moved back to Chile as a 2 years old. So I excluded him. He is Chilean. He was a centerback. He was named in 2011 South American Team of the Year. He would have replaced Mehmet Aurelio on the team.\n\n-- Matias Aguirregaray was born to Uruguayan parents in Brazil. His father was a former player named Oscar Aguirregaray who was playing in Brazil when Matias was born. Oscar was capped 10 times with Uruguay while Matias had 6 caps. I also ruled him out because he was an Uruguayan even through he was born in Brazil. He could play on both sides of the fullback position. This team actually lacked good fullbacks.\n\n-- Douglas (Netherlands) was originally on this team. He never played for the Dutch, but he sat on the bench for at least one game. Originally, I have to select him since I could not find a rightback. I took him name off the team after I found Mario Fernandes (Russia). Mario Fernandes was awarded a Bola de Prata in 2011. He later represented Russia at the 2018 World Cup Finals. He scored the tying goal against Croatia, but missed his penalty shoot in the shootout on the same game. Romulo was on Italy's provisional World Cup team in 2014, but he was never capped by Italy. Liked Douglas, his eligibility was in question. The goalkeeper position was different because I did not have enough candidates. So I took two uncapped goalkeepers who made the national team bench. Both Douglas and Romulo were off this team. Pepe and Rafael Tolói also played rightback.\n\n-- Aarón Wergifker was elected in 2011 as one of River Plate's \"100 Greatest Idols\". He was a leftback, a position I badly needed, but his \"Brazilness\" was being questioned. He was born in Brazil, but he was born there because his parents were on their way to Argentina from Russia. The family only stayed in Brazil for three months, after which they moved to the Argentine city of Buenos Aires. I ruled him ineligible because he never played football in Brazil and was in Argentina for non-football reasons.\n\n-- Lúcio Wagner (Bulgaria) and Leandro (Hungary) were my leftbacks I first created the team. When I discovered Emerson Palmieri (Italy) in 2019, I replaced one of the leftbacks for him. I had no idea about either ones. So I dropped Leandro (Hungary) for no particular reason. In 2023, I decided to select José Clayton (Tunisia) instead. I actually heard of him before I did this research. He stood out as a Brazilian on a Middle Eastern national team while playing in the World Cup Finals. He at least had some World Cup experiences.\n\n-- Before 2002, Lucio Wagner played for many clubs, including Benfica and Sevilla. He moved to Cherno More in Bulgaria in 2002. A year later, he joined Levski Sofia. They became the first Bulgarian side to reach group stage of Champions' League in 2006-2007. In 2006, Wagner was granted Bulgarian nationality, and made his debut for the national team on 9 May, in a Kirin Cup match against Japan.\n\n-- Leftback Tiago Silva (Bulgaria)'s single cap in 2006 for Bulgaria was ruled ineligible by FIFA since he played for the youth team of Brazil. He was capped by Bulgaria before FIFA changed its rule in 2009.\n\nMidfielders\n\n-- From the deep position, I first took Senna and Thiago Motta. Both of whom were well-known in their prime. Mehmet Aurelio as mentioned was a defensive midfielder. All three played in big international tournaments. Senna was an important player as Spain won the 2008 European Championship.\n\n-- Thiago Motta played for Brazil in the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup. The team was Brazil's Olympic team, but it was a full international tournament. Nevertheless, he was allowed to switch his allegiance to Italy in 2011. I did not know how it happened, but it did not matter for this blog. He played for Italy which was all that mattered here.\n\n-- \"Jorginho (Italy) will make the team one day. Sammir is likely to be dropped, \" I wrote that when I created this blog team. In December, 2019, I dropped Sammir (Croatia) and added Jorginho to the team. Later, he would be the star of Azzurri as they won the 2020 European Championship in 2021. He was named the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award that year.\n\n-- I made an exceptional case for Thiago Alcântara who was not born in Brazil. He is eligible because he is the son of Mazinho, which made Thiago Alcântara very Brazilian. Furthermore, he was born in Italy, not Spain. He lived briefly in Spain when he was growing up, but he spent part of his youth career with Flamengo, which made him a \"Brazilian footballer in Brazil\". He went to Spain in 2005 because Barcelona signed him as a footballer. He was in Spain for footballing reasons. Zague (Mexico)'s story is similar, but he was born in Mexico. He returned to Brazil and was playing youth football there before going back to Mexico for \"football reasons\".\n\nThiago Alcântara\n\n-- Otávio Fantoni (Nininho) and his cousins were important members of Palestra Italian (Cruzeiro's former name). The Fantoni family was important to the club's history. His cousins were Ninão (aka Fantoni I), Leonízio Fantoni (Niginho) and Orlando Fantoni. They would move to Lazio in the 1930's, Lazio was then known \"Brasilazio\" as Brazilian players such as Anfilogino Guarisi (Filó), Alejandro De Maria, Del Debbio, Rato and Amílcar also played for them, but Otávio Fantoni (Nininho) and Anfilogino Guarisi were the only Brazilian players capped by Italy from \"Brasilazio\". His only cap came in 1934, where he played alongside fellow Brazilian Anfilogino Guarisi. He was not called up for the World Cup Finals, but died a year later. I do not know if he would have earned more caps if he had a longer life. In July, 2023, I added him to this team because of the lack of midfielders. I dropped Cacau (Germany). Cacau moved to Germany to play fifth level football in 1999. He earned a move to Nürnberg in 2001. He joined VfB Stuttgart in 2003 and stayed there until 2014.He won the Bundesliga in 2007. He became a German citizen in 2009. He made his German national team debut in the same year. He went to the World Cup Finals in 2010..\n\n-- José Ufarte who was a legend with Atletico Madrid was born in Spain, but he grew up in Brazil where he started his career with Flamengo and Corinthians. But since he was a Spaniard born in Spain and was capped by Spain, I did not consider him eligible for this team.\n\n-- I was surprised that Deco was the only playmaker of note who was eligible for this team, given that Brazil is a national known for their number 10s. I assumed that many playmakers were naturalised all over the world. Ruy Ramos received an honor mention because he was one of the greatest Japanese players of all-time.\n\n-- In Brazil, Deco faced competition from Kaka, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Alex, Juninho Pernambucano, Juninho Paulista, etc in his prime. He was never called up. His performance in Barcelona would have easily made him a Brazilian international, but he already played for Portugal in 2003 when he was with Porto. His first international cap coincidentally was against Brazil on March, 2003. He scored the winning goal in a 2-1 victory. This was Portugal's first win over Brazil since the 1966 World Cup Finals. Later that year, he helped Porto to win the UEFA Cup, which turned him into a major star in the world. His inclusion into Portugal national team caused a lot of opposition in Portugal. Luis Figo openly criticised the move as Portugal already had Rui Costa, but Rui Costa was 6 years older.\n\n-- Jonathan dos Santos (Mexico) is different from Thiago. His father is a former Brazilian footballers playing in Mexico, but he decided to settle down in Mexico. So Jonathan dos Santos would have been living in Mexico if he chose not to become a footballer. He also has a Mexican mother.\n\nForwards\n\n-- Jose Altafini was known as Mazzola in Brazil because of his likeness to the Italian legend Valentino Mazzola. When he moved to Italy, he used his real name and became known as Jose Altafini. He was actually a part of Brazil's World Cup winning team in 1958. He helped Milan to win the European Cup in 1963. Angelo Sormani played for Milan after Jose Altafini left. He also won an European Cup in 1969 with them as well. They would later join force in Napoli. They were a good team for the 1970-1971 season, but only finished third behind the two Milan teams.\n\n-- Most players \"turned\" down representing Brazil because Brazil did not need him. Heading to the World Cup Finals in 2014, Brazil was in need of a better striker. Fred and Hulk were Brazil's main strikers at the time, and Diego Costa was a better player. He scored 36 goals in all competitions for Atletico Madrid, leading them to the Champions League final on the season before the World Cup Finals. He actually played for Brazil 6 months before he switched to Spain. He turned his back toward Brazil. Scolari commented on him, \"A Brazilian player who refuses to wear the shirt of the Brazilian national team and compete in a World Cup in your country is automatically withdrawn. He is turning his back on a dream of millions, to represent our national team, the five-time champions in a World Cup in Brazil.\" He would play in the 2014 World Cup Finals, but his performance was average. Brazil selected Fred, Hulk and Jo in the same tournament.\n\n-- Italy featured several South Americans on their 1934 World Cup winning team. Anfilogino Guarisi was the first Brazilian player to win the World Cup. Enrique Guaita on the other hand normally was listed as born in Argentina. He was one of the first Argentine-born to have won the World Cup in 1934 while playing for Italy alongside Luis Monti and Raimundo Orsi. However, some source claimed that he was born in Nogayå, Brazil, making him one of the first two Brazilian-born player to have won the World Cup. For this blog, I ruled him out because of unconfirmed information. Alejandro Demaría was also incorrectly listed as a World Cup winner. It was Attilio Demaría former of Argentina who played on the 1934 World Cup team. Alejandro Demaria only played for Italy B national team.\n\n-- Marlos was a big star in FC Shakhtar Donetsk where he played with Eduardo da Silva at one point. Although he is a bigger star in Ukraine than Eduardo, Eduardo has a better overall career. So I selected him over Marlos.\n\n-- Luis Oliveria was a top striker playing in Italy during the 1990's. He was known for being Gabriel Batistuta's striker partner in Fiorentina. Liedson was one of Sporting CP's greatest players in the more current history. With them, he won four major titles helping it to four Champions League participations."
