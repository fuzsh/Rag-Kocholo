        "text": "Culture\n\nBrazil is internationally known for its music (especially the samba) and for Carnaval celebrations, but its literature, filmmaking history, and cuisine also have been highly influential. The country’s major cultural institutions and universities are clustered in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo—notably the Brazilian Academy of Letters, the National Library, and galleries, museums, theater companies, and orchestras.\n\nPainting, sculpture, and architecture\n\nThe earliest Brazilian paintings were made thousands of years ago as petroglyphs. Thousands of these carvings on rock survive in Serra da Capivara National Park (a UNESCO World Heritage site in Piauí state) and at lesser sites, such as Itacoatiara in the Amazon basin. During the colonial period Brazilian artists created Baroque works rivaling those of Iberia and Spanish America. The most famous colonial-era sculptor was Aleijadinho; his ornate carvings still grace churches in Minas Gerais state. Brazil’s more renowned artists of the late 1800s and 1900s included Eliseu d’Angelo Visconti, Tarsila do Amaral, and the muralist Cândido Portinari.\n\nBrazilian architecture is internationally famous mainly because of Oscar Niemeyer, who designed several public buildings. In the 1950s Niemeyer and the urban planner Lúcio Costa led the planning of the new capital, Brasília. The city’s residential blocks and multilane highways provided a fitting backdrop for the National Congress, presidential palace, and other major public buildings.\n\nLiterature\n\nMuch of Brazil’s history and culture have been reflected in and influenced by its writers. American Indians in the region lacked writing systems prior to European contact, but they did have oral literature. After contact, missionaries and other Portuguese colonizers chronicled their views of Brazil. Among them was Gabriel Soares de Sousa with his Descriptive Treatise of Brazil in 1587. In the 1600s the nationalistic hero Gregório de Matos Guerra satirized the Portuguese-descended ruling classes. In the next century, Basílio da Gama wrote the epic poem The Uruguay (1769), which tells of Jesuit-led missions and struggles against European slave-hunters. Some novels of the 1700s and 1800s are called Indianista because they idealize Indians. Examples are José Martiniano de Alencar’s The Guarani Indian (1857) and Iracema (1865), which focus on interracial romances. In the mid-1800s Manuel Antônio de Almeida wrote Memoirs of a Militia Sergeant, revealing commoners’ gritty lives in Rio de Janeiro, while Bernardo Guimarães and Alencar related the travails of the backlands.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis’s best-regarded novels were Dom Casmurro (1899); Epitaph of a Small Winner (1881), which centered on a pessimistic bachelor; and Philosopher or Dog? (1891), a tale of social scheming, vice, madness, and jealousy. The pre-Modernist writer Euclides da Cunha’s 1902 book Rebellion in the Backlands portrays a bloody war between a community of messianic backlanders and government forces. In a more comical light, José Bento Monteiro Lobato caricatured backlanders with protagonists such as Jeca Tatu (“Joe Armadillo”).\n\nIn the 1940s João Guimarães Rosa and Clarice Lispector became highly influential authors. Guimarães Rosa depicted rural misery in stories and in his novel The Devil to Pay in the Backlands (1956). Lispector’s The Apple in the Dark (1961) was set in rural Brazil, from which also sprang her protagonist in The Hour of the Star (1977), a novel that became an acclaimed film. Érico Veríssimo creatively portrayed Brazilian families and gauchos in his Time and the Wind (1951) trilogy, Cecília Meireles penned symbolic poetry and children’s books, and Manuel Carneiro de Sousa Bandeira Filho was a poet and writer of memoirs.\n\nJorge Amado rose above humble origins to become one of the most admired figures in Latin American literature. Troubled by injustice and inequality, Amado wrote The Violent Land (1942) to expose the oppression of cacao workers. However, much of his fame grew from comedies such as Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands: A Moral and Amorous Tale (1966), which also became a major film. Amado influenced millions with his irreverent humor and themes of social justice, sexuality, and women’s rights.\n\nIn addition to those themes, racism and political rights have been examined by many recent writers, including Luiz Antônio de Assis Brasil, Antônio Callado, Lygia Fagundes Telles, and Darcy Ribeiro, as well as the influential writers/poets/critics Carlos Drummond de Andrade and Haroldo de Campos, the poet and novelist Décio Pignatari, and such poets as João Cabral de Melo Neto, Ferreira Gullar (José Ribamar Ferreira), Waly Salomão, and Adão Ventura. Ethics, sexuality, and poverty inform Rachel de Queiroz’s novels The Three Marias (1939) and Dôra, Doralina (1975), which revolves around women from the harsh Northeast. Edla van Steen and Rubem Fonseca have kept the seamy underside of city life in the limelight. Paulo Coelho has crafted mystically oriented tales such as The Alchemist (1993) and The Diary of a Magus (1992; reissued as The Pilgrimage in 1995). João Ubaldo Ribeiro’s 2002 portrayal of an unethical priest became a best-seller at a time when scandals marred the Roman Catholic Church. Brazilian literature in the 21st century continues to interweave the social, psychological, and economic threads that make up the nation’s cultural fabric.\n\nTheater, film, and television\n\nThe stage and screen are immensely popular in Brazil. The grandest theaters are in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. However, one Brazilian concert venue is world-famous for its unlikely location: the opera house of Manaus, in the heart of the Amazon, was built in 1896 by the newly rich rubber barons. Some of Brazil’s notable dramatists of recent decades have included Nelson Rodrigues, Pedro Bloch, João Bethencourt, Alfredo Dias Gomes, and Augusto Boal, who founded Brazil’s Theatre of the Oppressed. Many professionals also have developed the Brazilian film industry, which has suffered periodically from censorship under military dictatorships. It now competes for its very survival against big-budget films from North America and Europe.\n\nIn the 1950s Brazil launched its famous Cinema Novo (“New Cinema”) movement, which aimed to show common people and the underside of Brazilian life. Nelson Pereira dos Santos helped create the movement with Rio, North Zone (1957), set in a favela (shantytown), and Barren Lives (1963), based on a novel by Graciliano Ramos. Among dos Santos’s later works are Prison Memories (1984), based on a Ramos novel about political repression, and The Third Bank of the River (1994), in the vein of magical realism. New Cinema also revolved around Joaquim Pedro de Andrade and Glauber Rocha, who examined syncretic mysticism and sociopolitical ills in The Turning Wind (1962), Black God, White Devil (1964), and Antônio das Mortes (1969). Carlos Diegues became known for dramas about slavery—Ganga Zumba (1963), Xica da Silva (1976), and Quilombo (1984). He also directed Bye Bye Brazil (1979), in which a performers’ caravan travels through the country, and the comedy God Is Brazilian (2004), in which God seeks a temporary replacement in Brazil. Along with Mexico, Brazil had some of the first major films by women, starting with Ana Carolina Teixeira Soares’s Sea of Roses (1977).\n\nAmong the Brazilian filmmakers who have enjoyed recent success overseas is Walter Salles. He dealt with diamond smuggling in Foreign Land (1995) and pulled at heartstrings in Central Station (1998) before making such international films as The Motorcycle Diaries (2004) and Dark Water (2005). Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund’s film City of God (2002) portrays horrific violence among street children in a favela of Rio de Janeiro. Vicente Amorim’s acclaimed movie The Middle of the Road (2004) shows a family taking a 2,000-mile bicycle trip in search of a decent job. With their troubled sociopolitical backdrop, Brazilians have also created powerful documentaries, such as José Padilha’s Bus 174 (2003), which concerned a bus hijacking in Rio de Janeiro, the killing of a passenger by police, and the citywide riots that followed.\n\nSome of Latin America’s more dazzling movie and TV performers have come from Brazil, including Carmen Miranda, radio and film star from the 1930s to the mid-1950s; the Cinema Novo starlet Odete Lara, who is depicted in the autobiographical film Lara (2002); and the blond superstar Xuxa, who hosted internationally syndicated kids’ TV shows in the 1980s and ’90s. The widely admired actor Fernanda Montenegro has graced several Brazilian films, including Central Station, and popular TV shows. Her daughter, Fernanda Torres, appeared in The House of Sand (2005) and Redeemer (2004). Among the chief types of TV programs in Brazil are novelas (soap operas), sports events, and variety shows.\n\nMusic and dance\n\nFor thousands of years music and dance have been central to indigenous religious ceremonies. In most of Brazil today, however, African rhythms and influences are more profoundly felt, especially in the ladainha, chula, and corrida music that accompanies the capoeira (an Afro-Brazilian blend of martial arts and dance). African music has also influenced music-and-dance styles such as the batuque, congada, choro, samba, Brazilian funk (akin to rap and hip-hop), and axé (a high-energy music linked with samba, syncretic religions, and Carnaval in the Northeast). These and other Brazilian blends of musical styles are driven by drum beats, traditional instruments such as rattles and the berimbau (a musical bow), and other electric or acoustic instruments. In anticipation of Carnaval, the young and old dance the samba year-long in Rio de Janeiro’s dancing schools. Even classical music in Brazil has African and American Indian influences, thanks to the tradition-breaking compositions of Heitor Villa-Lobos.\n\nRio de Janeiro is also known for bossa nova (the “new beat” created in the 1960s) and for its most beloved song, “The Girl from Ipanema.” The music of the tropicália countercultural movement, also called tropicalism, is also still admired. A list of Brazil’s world-famous pop stars and singers might be topped with João Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim (creators of bossa nova), Astrud Gilberto, the “music king” Roberto Carlos Braga, Gilberto Gil (of tropicália fame), influential rocker Raul Seixas, the country musicians Leandro and Leonardo, Chico Buarque, Caetano Veloso, Elis Regina, and Gal Costa. Despite these contributions to world music, however, many Brazilian radios, music-minded websites, and music stores are more attuned to exports from European and U.S. studios.\n\nSports\n\nSoccer (association football) is Brazil’s most popular sport. Its national team has won several World Cups, and players such as Pelé and Ronaldo have been listed among the world’s best. The country’s string of successes in volleyball since the mid-20th century have made it Brazil’s second most popular sport. Municipal governments often provide volleyball courts and other recreational equipment for the country’s beaches, including Rio de Janeiro’s famous Copacabana and Ipanema. The mixture of martial arts and dance called capoeira is uniquely Brazilian and regarded as a sport. Millions of Brazilians are fans of Formula One auto racing and of drivers such as Emerson Fittipaldi and the late Ayrton Senna. Brazil has competed in every Olympic Games since 1920, except the 1928 Summer Games in Amsterdam. It has been successful in many events, including track and field, swimming, yachting, and such team sports as soccer, volleyball, and basketball. Rio de Janeiro was the site of the 2016 Summer Games. It was the first city in South America to host the Olympics.\n\nFood and drink\n\nBrazil is widely known for its ubiquitous steakhouses (churrascarias), yet beef is not easily affordable for the poor. One of the most preferred staple foods in Brazil is the protein-rich arroz com feijão (rice and beans). Also popular and inexpensive are cassava soup, plantains, and bananas. Feijoada completa (a thick stew of beans, rice, and pork) is Brazil’s national dish. Side dishes might include couve mineira (sautéed kale or collard greens) or farofa (toasted cassava flour). Two of the delicacies of the North are tacacá soup (containing shrimp, tapioca, and seasonings) and pato no tucupi (duck marinated in lemon juice, oil, and a manioc-based sauce). Guava, coconuts, and other fruits are abundant. Coffee, fruit blends, and various soft drinks (from Guaraná to Fanta) are popular beverages. Brazilians also patronize Italian, Japanese, and other ethnic restaurants, though these now compete with fast-food establishments.\n\nThe Republic to the 1990s\n\nIn 1889 Pedro II was overthrown and exiled. A group of military officers and wealthy coffee planters then proclaimed Brazil a federal republic. A new constitution was adopted in 1891. Nevertheless, only some landowners were allowed to vote, and few Brazilians enjoyed new privileges. In its early years the republic put down several regional uprisings.\n\nNon-Portuguese Europeans, especially from Italy and Germany, began to arrive in large numbers in the mid- and late 1800s. Most joined the teeming crowds of São Paulo and Rio, but thousands joined the “rubber booms” in the Amazon, supplying tires to a rapidly developing world.\n\nPartly because of social injustices and a lack of democratic practices, such as free and fair elections, Brazil remained unstable in the early 1900s. There were hundreds of local strikes and protests as workers demanded better conditions. Disgruntled tenentes (“lieutenants,” or junior army officers) led several revolts.\n\nTaking power in a coup, Getúlio Vargas ruled from 1930 to 1945. During the global Great Depression of the 1930s, Brazil floundered economically and saw bloody revolts, encouraging Vargas to become more dictatorial. However, he also enacted reforms that reinforced workers’ rights, and in 1934 women gained the right to vote. In addition, Vargas enacted a policy in which the government promoted Brazilian industries while taxing and restricting foreign-made goods.\n\nDuring World War II (1939–45), Brazil patrolled against German submarines in the Atlantic Ocean and contributed thousands of troops to the Allied invasion of Italy. Vargas welcomed the U.S. lend-lease program, which supplied Brazil with new weapons and military supplies—much to the dismay of Brazil’s old rival Argentina.\n\nIn the three decades after World War II, Brazilians differed in their beliefs about politics and democracy (as evidenced in the election of Vargas to a scandal-ridden 1951–54 presidential term). However, they tended to keep faith in their motto “Order and Progress.” One symbol of progress was the brand-new national capital, Brasília. The city was built in just a few years, starting in the late 1950s. Brasília became a link for new highways leading hundreds of miles farther north to the Amazon. But the key to the economy remained in the Southeast. It led Brazil’s transformation from a chiefly agricultural country into South America’s main industrial powerhouse, exporting metals and goods in growing quantities. Even so, Brazil continued to be the world’s chief source of coffee (grown mainly in the Southeast) and a leading exporter of other crops.\n\nAfter a brief return to democracy, another period of military rule began in 1964. As was typical in Latin America, Brazil’s rulers were loosely allied with the United States during the Cold War. They adored capitalism but distrusted real democracy, even as they sought to destroy communism. While controlling dissidents with censorship and the threat of arrest, the rulers welcomed foreign and private investment, especially in the petrochemical (oil) industry. Through the 1980s Brazil and its neighbors cooperated in “dirty wars” wherein their governments tortured and killed thousands of leftist insurgents. However, in their zeal they also killed and abused peace-loving citizens. Brazil’s economy declined again during the 1980s, but this helped bring about the end of the dictatorship in 1985. Amid high inflation, a new constitution was approved in 1988.\n\nIn 1990 Fernando Collor de Mello took office as the first freely elected president in three decades. After being charged with corruption, however, he resigned in 1992, and Vice President Itamar Franco became president. The finance minister, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, used austerity measures (price controls and cuts to social programs) to stabilize the out-of-control economy. So successful was he that he won election to the presidency twice, in 1994 and 1998, despite subsequent scandals and criticism.\n\nThe 21st Century\n\nBrazilian voters placed the leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the presidency in 2003. He attempted to steer the country toward social reform while maintaining economic stability. During his first term Lula oversaw a growing economy and a reduction in the poverty rate. Although his popularity was hurt when members of his Workers’ Party were accused of bribery and illegal campaign financing, he went on to win reelection. He began a second term in 2007. The Brazilian economy continued to grow under his administration. One of the high points of his second term came in 2009 when Rio de Janeiro was chosen to host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. Constitutionally unable to run for a third consecutive term, Lula supported his former chief of staff, Dilma Rousseff, in the 2010 elections. Although she did not win with an outright majority, she defeated her opponent in runoff elections later that year. She entered office in January 2011, becoming the first female president of Brazil.\n\nShortly after Rousseff took office, she had to address one of Brazil’s worst natural disasters in decades. Torrential rain created floods and mudslides that left thousands homeless and killed more than 500 in several mountainside communities just north of Rio de Janeiro. On the economic front, several years of robust expansion soon came to an end. Increasingly anxious about the administration’s handling of the economy and poor delivery of public services, Brazilians staged massive street protests across the country in June 2013. Rousseff’s approval rating dropped abruptly. Her popularity recovered in 2014, especially following Brazil’s largely successful hosting of the World Cup soccer (association football) tournament that year. Rousseff was narrowly reelected in October 2014, in one of the closest presidential elections in recent Brazilian history.\n\nIn early 2015 Brazil’s economy continued to decline, inflation rose, and the deficit grew. The Rousseff government’s efforts to combat those problems were complicated by its embroilment in the largest political scandal in the country’s history. Dozens of politicians and businesspeople were implicated in the so-called Petrobras scandal. The scandal involved millions of dollars in alleged kickbacks by prominent Brazilian corporations to officials of the state-run oil concern Petrobras and members of the Workers’ Party. An investigation by the attorney general cleared Rousseff of any involvement in the affair. Nevertheless, large numbers of Brazilians again took to the streets in March and April to protest the scandal, with many calling for Rousseff’s impeachment.\n\nThe extensive and rapid spread of the Zika virus in the Americas starting in 2015 also created anxiety in Brazil. Between October 2015 and January 2016 nearly 4,000 babies born with microcephaly (abnormal smallness of the head) were reported in Brazil. The mothers of many of those babies were presumed to have been infected with the Zika virus. Concerned not only about the health of its citizens but also about the effect that the virus might have on the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in August 2016, the Brazilian government undertook aggressive measures to combat the outbreak of the virus.\n\nIn 2016 the movement to impeach Rousseff gained momentum as the Petrobras scandal widened to involve Lula himself. He was formally charged with money laundering in March. Although Rousseff was not implicated in the scandal, she came in for withering criticism when she sought to appoint Lula to her cabinet. Many viewed that move as an attempt to protect him from prosecution. In May the Senate voted to suspend Rousseff from office, and Vice President Michel Temer was named acting president. Rousseff was permanently removed from office on August 31, following an impeachment trial. In that trial she was convicted of having used state bank funds to cover up a budget deficit in the run-up to her 2014 reelection. After Rousseff was found guilty, “acting” was dropped from Temer’s title as president.\n\nIn July 2017 Lula was convicted of money laundering and corruption. An appellate court unanimously upheld his conviction in January 2018. The following April the Supreme Court voted 6–5 to deny Lula’s request to remain free while he pursued his final appeal options. He began serving a 12-year prison sentence shortly thereafter. Despite Lula’s incarceration, the Workers’ Party chose him as its presidential nominee at the party’s national convention in early August. However, the Superior Electoral Court ruled on August 31 that Lula was ineligible to run in the October 2018 presidential election. Lula subsequently ended his candidacy and threw his support behind Fernando Haddad, a former mayor of São Paulo.\n\nSoon after Lula withdrew from the presidential race, Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain and seven-term legislator, emerged as the front-runner. Bolsonaro was a right-wing nationalist. His law-and-order anticorruption rhetoric seemed to resonate with much of the Brazilian electorate. At the same time, opponents of Bolsonaro strongly condemned many of his past remarks as anti-gay, anti-woman, and racist. At a campaign appearance on September 6, Bolsonaro was the victim of an assassination attempt in which he was stabbed. His wounds required lifesaving surgery. Nevertheless, Bolsonaro won the first round of balloting on October 7, though he did not secure enough votes to avoid a runoff with Haddad. In the runoff election on October 28, Bolsonaro decisively defeated Haddad, taking more than 55 percent of the vote.\n\nIn early 2020 Bolsonaro’s term began to be dominated by the outbreak of COVID-19, an illness caused by a coronavirus. On March 11 the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global pandemic. The disease eventually spread throughout Brazil. Many observers blamed the country’s inadequate response to the outbreak on Bolsonaro. He repeatedly downplayed the disease’s severity. He also undermined the country’s vaccination program by falsely claiming that the vaccinations posed health hazards. As the crisis worsened, Bolsonaro’s popularity sharply declined. By mid-2021 more than 500,000 people in Brazil had died from COVID-19-related causes.\n\nMeanwhile, Lula had been released from prison in 2019, and a Supreme Court judge had dismissed the corruption charges against him in 2021. In July 2022 he became the official candidate of the Workers’ Party in the upcoming presidential election. Brazilians cast their ballots in the first round of the election in early October. Lula was the top vote-getter, followed by Bolsonaro. The two advanced to a runoff on October 30. Lula won the runoff by a close margin (roughly 51 percent to 49 percent) to return to the presidency.\n\nThroughout the years Brazilians have taken pride in their homeland. Few worry about armed conflict with Argentina and other neighbors, largely because democracy and international trade have germinated deeper feelings of security than the military dictatorships of the past ever could have. Brazil still has security concerns, however. These include smuggling and violence in the Amazon region, corruption and mismanagement in police forces and prisons, and high murder rates and gang activities in cities. Much crime has been linked to Brazil’s highly unequal distribution of wealth and land ownership, as well as political corruption. Moreover, racial discrimination remains a social barrier, despite claims to the contrary. Despite the social and economic strains linked with its huge urban populations, Brazil has continued to create opportunities and to inspire hope for its citizenry in the 21st century."
