        "text": "Football legends Johan Cruyff, Eusébio, Gerd Müller, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have all won the prestigious Ballon d'Or or ‘Golden Ball’, which honours the best player of the season.\n\nMessi currently holds the record for most Ballon d'Ors with eight (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019, 2021 and 2023), while five-time winner Cristiano Ronaldo has the most nominations with 18.\n\nThe Ballon d’Or has been awarded every year since 1956, except 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nStanley Matthews of England was the first-ever player to receive the prize, which was created by French news magazine France Football.\n\nIn 2018, the Ballon d'Or Féminin was awarded for the first time, with Norway’s Ada Hegerberg being the inaugural recipient.\n\nFind the full list of Ballon d’Or winners below."
