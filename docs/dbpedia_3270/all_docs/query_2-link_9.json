        "text": "Football legend Peleâs greatest achievements\n\nBrazilian football icon Pele (1940-2022) is the only player in the history of the game to win three World Cups, achievements that helped earn him legendary status. Pele, among footballâs most prolific scorers, spent nearly two decades mesmerising fans and dazzling opponents with his skills. Hereâs a visual explainer about Peleâs greatest achievements, and the âThree Heartsâ for which âThe Kingâ of football was known.\n\nPeleâs beautiful game\n\nPele personified âjoga bonitoâ, an expression he popularised, meaning the beautiful game. Peleâs samba-like flair and his fast, fluid style revolutionised football and transfixed players and fans alike. Hereâs what some footballers have said about him:\n\nâPele was fast, agile, scored with the head, and controlled the ball with both legs like no one else.â\n\nCesar Luis Menotti (former teammate at Santos FC, former Argentina head coach)\n\nâHe is the most complete player I ever saw.â\n\nFranz Beckenbauer (former teammate at New York Cosmos)\n\nâHe had speed, power, and strength; he played very well on both sides of the pitch, he had fantastic heading and he was able to stop the ball with his chest like no one else.â\n\nMilton âTitaâ Queiroz (former teammate in Brazil)\n\nâHe used to stop the ball with his chest, then lower it to his feet and kick a shot that made the door tremble.â\n\nAlfio Basile (former Argentina player)\n\nâWhen God created Pele, he put everything into him: speed, strength, momentum, technique, shooting, heading, dribbling, everything.â\n\nZico (former Brazil player)\n\nâPele did incredible things on the field; the best headed goals, he showed extraordinary energy. He did things that I never saw before. Also, he kept evolving to show new skills.â\n\nPepe Macia (former Brazil player, Santos FC)\n\nPeleâs âthree heartsâ\n\nPele was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento on October 23, 1940 in the town of Tres Coracoes (Three Hearts) in southeastern Brazil. His father named him after Thomas Edison, the famous inventor who created light bulbs. Pele won the World Cup three times, in 1958, 1962 and 1970, a football milestone no other player has yet achieved. In 2000, Fifa named Pele as the player of the century along with Argentinaâs Diego Maradona, who died in 2020 at 60.\n\nFirst heart\n\n1958 Fifa World Cup, Sweden\n\nPele was 17 when he made his World Cup debut playing for Brazil, the youngest player ever at the tournament. He scored his first goal against Wales. However, it was in the semi-final against France that he put on a show of offensive brilliance, scoring three goals. In the final against Sweden, he scored two goals in a 5-2 win to take the trophy home. The first time Pele was hailed as âThe Kingâ was in Paris Match magazine in July 1958, following Brazilâs World Cup triumph.\n\nSecond Heart\n\n1962 Fifa World Cup, Chile\n\nThen 21, Pele suffered a serious groin injury after attempting a shot with his left foot against Czechoslovakia during the group stage. It was an injury that âhurt the whole nationâ, an announcer said about its impact on Brazilian fans. Pele attempted to return, but 12 days later suffered another injury in training, forcing him to sit out for the rest of the World Cup. Despite Peleâs injury, Brazil won the World Cup again.\n\nThird Heart\n\n1970 Fifa World Cup, Mexico\n\nPele promised that he would never play in another World Cup after Brazil were eliminated at the 1966 Fifa World Cup in England in the group stage for the first time. But in Mexico in 1970, Pele, then 29, took his virtuosity to another level, making some of the most magical moments in football history. He scored four goals, including one in the final against Italy.\n\nPeleâs best tricks\n\nPele performed fast, unpredictable moves and could outplay opponents on the pitch. Here are some of his famous plays, variations of which have been adopted by players around the world.\n\nThe nutmeg\n\nA nutmeg is a skill used mainly in football and in other sports. The aim is to kick, roll, dribble, throw, or push the ball between an opponentâs legs.\n\nThe cut\n\nWhile controlling the ball with speed, he suddenly stops and changes direction to leave the opponent behind.\n\nThe hat\n\nControls the ball with the tip of the foot, passing it over the defender to mislead him and regain control of the ball. A one-two with himself, but by air.\n\nThe step-over (bicycle)\n\nThe step-over is a dribbling play that consists of wrapping the legs around the ball. Often it is done parallel to an opposing player, previously facing him without knowing which direction the attacker can go with the ball.\n\nThe âCroquetaâ\n\nThe attacker shifts the ball quickly from one foot to the other, before using the second foot to power himself away from the defender.\n\nPeleâs fame\n\nPele was so famous that he briefly stopped a war in 1967. Factions of a civil war in Nigeria agreed to a brief ceasefire so the football star could play an exhibition match there. In 1997, Pele was knighted by Britainâs Queen Elizabeth. Hereâs what some famous figures said about him:\n\nâTo watch him play was to watch the delight of a child combined with the extraordinary grace of a man in full.â\n\nâNelson Mandela\n\nâPele was one of the few who contradicted my theory: instead of 15 minutes of fame, he will have 15 centuries.â\n\nâAndy Warhol\n\nâI am Ronald Reagan, president of the United States of America. But you donât have to introduce yourself, because everyone knows who Pele is.â\n\nâRonald Reagan\n\nâAbsolutely everybody wanted to shake his hand, to get a photo with him. Saying you had partied with Pele was the biggest badge of honour going.â\n\nâMick Jagger\n\nPeleâs many goals\n\nPeleâs goal tally is controversial. According to Brazilâs football association (CBF) and Santos, Pele scored 1,283 goals in 1,367 matches in his career. Fifa put his goal record at 757 in 812 matches. Many statisticians claim that only official games should be considered as part of the tally.\n\nThree of the greatest\n\nPele, Maradona, and Lionel Messi are widely considered the sportâs best.
