        "text": "Welcome to today’s Olympic newsletter. I’m your tour guide John Cherwa as we discover that Simon Biles is actually human.\n\nWe won’t sugarcoat it. Simone Biles had a bad day on Monday. She hopped off the balance beam and finished fifth and only got silver in the floor exercise. If you are the G.O.A.T., a silver or bronze is more like a participation medal. Nonetheless she handled it with grace, full of smiles.\n\nSuni Lee was fourth in the beam.\n\nIn the floor exercise, an event Biles always wins, she stepped out of bounds twice leaving, the floor open for Rebeca Andrade of Brazil. Jordan Chiles of the U.S. got the bronze. Biles and Chiles bowed and saluted Andrade as she received the gold medal, going viral for their sportsmanship to close the gymnastics competition. Our Thuc Nhi Nguyen recaps it all here.\n\nOther highs and lows from Monday:\n\n—In 3 X 3 women’s play, the U.S. won the bronze medal after beating Canada 16-13. The U.S. missed the gold-medal game when it lost to Spain, 18-16 in overtime in the semifinals. Our Kevin Baxter looks at how crowds are flocking to these Games, right here.\n\n—The highlight of track and field was Noah Lyles breezing in his 200-meter heat. Valarie Allman won consecutive golds in the women’s discus.\n\n—The U.S. beach volleyball contingent went from four to two after the round of 16. Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes advanced on Sunday night and Miles Evans and Andy Benesh won on Monday, advancing to the Elite 8. The U.S. men’s team of Chase Budinger and Miles Evans lost to the defending Olympic champions from Norway, while Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss lost to Canada.\n\n—Competing in shooting’s first mixed team trap event, the U.S. took silver losing to Italy 44-43. It was the fifth shooting medal for the U.S. at the Games.\n\n—In the sport where the venue got more notice than the athletes, the U.S. took silver in the triathlon mixed team relay behind Germany. Officials ruled the bacteria level in the Seine River was at an acceptable level so the swimming part of the sport could take place.\n\n—In a match that was closer than the score, the U.S. men’s volleyball team beat Brazil 3-1 in the quarterfinals. It will play Poland on Wednesday in the semis.\n\n—The U.S. men’s water polo team closed pool play with a 14-11 win over Croatia, an important win because it will allow it to avoid favored Spain until a potential gold-medal match. It plays Australia in the quarters Wednesday.\n\nMiscall for the ages\n\nIt’s a day or so later and there is still talk about what might be the biggest miscall of a major sport event in quite some time. NBC’s Leigh Diffey miscalled the winner of the men’s 100 as Kishane Thompson of Jamaica instead of Noah Lyles of the U.S.\n\nDiffey got two things wrong. First, he miscalled a race during which he never should have tried to call the winner. The margin was .005 seconds. If he thinks he can correctly call the winner of a race that close, he has a an opinion of his ability that far exceeds any human reality.\n\nSecond, he never said he was sorry or used the word “apology” or acknowledged his mistake on air. In fact, he didn’t even seem contrite.\n\n“My eyes & instinct told me Kishane Thompson won,” Diffey posted on X. “Obviously, that wasn’t the case. I shouldn’t have been so bold to call it, but I genuinely thought he won. I got it wrong.”\n\nHe seemed a little chippy when talking to the Associated Press.\n\n“They’re all experts after it’s over, right?” he said. “I trusted my eyes and instinct and got it wrong by .005 seconds.”\n\nThis is in stark contrast to 1988 when Charlie Jones got his Kenyans mixed up and called the wrong winner of the men’s 800.\n\n“We have blown this call,” Jones said on air after the replay. “Gentleman, we were wrong.”\n\n“Paul Ereng has the gold … as we just wrote our names in the record book of blunders,” Jones went on to say.\n\nGuess you can’t teach class.\n\nWhich sports do you want to get rid of?\n\nWe’ve got no power, but we can pretend. So, let’s get rid of a few Olympic sports. Here are the choices. You can vote for two.\n\n3 X 3 basketball: Do you want to expand to 2 X 2 or 4 X 4 or 6 X 6? Where does it end?\n\nArtistic swimming: Used to be synchronized swimming but needed rebranding. Reached peak with Esther Williams.\n\nBasketball: Little competitive balance, especially with the women.\n\nBoxing: Growing more insignificant by the day. Bad scoring system. Gateway sport to UFC.\n\nGolf: Too elite and players are judged on how many majors they win, not Olympic medals.\n\nModern pentathlon: About as outdated as it comes. What kid doesn’t have a daily routine of fencing, swimming, horseback riding, shooting and running?\n\nRhythmic gymnastics: Ball, ribbon and hoop. Need we say more?\n\nTennis: See golf.\n\nTrampoline: Extra deduction if you land in the neighbor’s back yard.\n\nSomething else: Self explanatory.\n\n(Note to readers: Comments for entertainment purposes only. And, no, Leigh Diffey was not eligible for this category.)\n\nYou can vote here.\n\nWhat to watch for today\n\nThe volume starts to get turned down early in the week. There are 19 sports competing. Here’s the most interesting.\n\n—Imane Khelif, the Algerian boxer at the center of a gender controversy of which she has done nothing wrong, is back in the ring against a Thai boxer having already assured herself of at least a bronze medal. NBC, at least of what I’ve seen, has mostly stayed away from this story with only occasional mentions. The bout should start around 4:34 a.m. PDT.\n\n—The highlight of the track and field will be the women’s 200 meters featuring Gabby Thomas of the U.S. She won bronze in Tokyo. Also in the race is Julien Alfred of St. Lucia, who won the women’s 100. Other finals are the women’s hammer throw, men’s long jump, men’s 1,500 and women’s 3,000 steeplechase (that’s the one with water). Track starts at 10:57 a.m. PDT and finishes with the 200 at 12:40 p.m. PDT.\n\n—The men’s basketball team opens play in the knockout round against Brazil. Tip off is around 12:30 p.m. PDT.\n\n—The U.S. women’s soccer team plays Germany in the semifinal. It should start at 9 a.m. PDT.\n\nLet’s catch up on some stories you might have missed but shouldn’t have:\n\nParis Olympics TV schedule: Tuesday’s listings\n\n‘We ugly cried’: Jordan Chiles savors euphoria of surprise Olympic bronze medal\n\nSparks star Dearica Hamby helps U.S. rally for bronze medal in 3x3 basketball\n\nDevin Booker goes from facepalm emoji to congratulating Noah Lyles: ‘Great for America’\n\nTaiwanese athletes claim Olympic gold against China, and not everyone was happy about it\n\nHow timekeepers determined Noah Lyles won 100 meters by slimmest of margins\n\n‘She’s queen.’ Simone Biles, Jordan Chiles honor floor gold medalist Rebeca Andrade\n\nCalabasas jeweler shares story behind Simone Biles’ iconic goat diamond necklace\n\nMeet the UCLA softball legend influencing U.S. women’s volleyball’s success\n\nSan Clemente’s Caroline Marks celebrates Olympic surfing gold medal win\n\n2024 Paris Olympics live updates\n\n2024 Paris Summer Olympic Games: Complete coverage\n\n2024 Paris Olympics: How to watch every event and the closing ceremony\n\nYour TV guide"
