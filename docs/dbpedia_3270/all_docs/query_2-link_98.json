Suicidal behavior in adolescents is associated with the interaction of complex relationships between personal, interpersonal, and sociocultural factors. Through a quantitative, descriptive, and correlational cross-sectional study, the present study aimed to analyze the prevalence and risk factors associated with suicidal ideation among adolescents from different high schools of the high school system (SEMS) of the University of Guadalajara, in response to the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive statistical analysis was carried out on the data obtained from the 3583 students surveyed, followed by a principal component analysis (PCA) to identify closely related social, emotional, and behavioral variables. The PCA yielded eight principal components, which together represent 75.42% of the variance across psychometric tests. A multiple linear regression analysis was used, with a regression value (R2) of 0.4811, indicating that the explanatory model can predict 48.1% of the variability in suicidal ideation, with a statistical significance level of 0.05. According to the studies conducted, 19% (688 students) showed indicators of high suicide risk and 26.8% (960 students) showed moderate risk. Depression, mental health, health-related quality of life, physical and psychological well-being, and mood and emotions are the most influential factors in suicidal ideation.

This study used qualitative methods to examine factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine decision making and the effects of anxiety and depression on these decisions within the CHASING COVID Cohort (C3). Between October and December 2023, we conducted 25 interviews with participants from 16 different US states, 14 of whom endorsed recent symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Using grounded theory methodology for coding and thematic analysis, we categorized participants into “One-Shot Wonders” and “Booster Enthusiasts”. Our findings indicate that the US COVID-19 vaccination environment has shifted from active promotion to a notable absence of COVID-19 discussions, leading to reduced worry about infection and severe illness, diminished perception of the benefits of the vaccine on personal and community levels, and fewer cues to action. Initially influential factors like family, personal experiences, and physician recommendations lost impact over time. Although the relationship between symptoms of depression and anxiety and vaccination was not prominent, one case highlighted a direct relationship. The study emphasizes the importance of timely and accurate public health messaging adaptable to individuals’ needs and misconceptions, highlighting the need for dynamic communication strategies in future initiatives with rapidly changing landscapes.

This study, conducted from 1 March 2023 to 31 March 2024 at sub-district health-promoting hospitals in Thailand, aims to identify the factors affecting hospital service quality post-transfer and evaluate the role of professional nurses in maintaining service standards under new governance. Utilizing a mixed-methods design based on the Global Fund-HSS framework (2012), which categorizes factors into accessibility, processes, productivity, and outcomes, we collected data from 340 nurses and 400 patients through structured questionnaires. These questionnaires were divided into seven sections, capturing metrics such as the personal data of nurses, hospital service activities, and leadership qualities. We employed a Likert scale to gauge the perceptions and expectations of service quality and conducted paired t-tests to compare performance metrics before and after the administrative transfer. One-way ANOVA was used to assess variability among different service units, and binary logistic regression helped identify the key determinants of service quality. The analysis revealed a significant correlation between the attitudes and competencies of healthcare teams and the levels of service quality. Notably, service units transferred less than 50% exhibited minimal changes, indicating that the degree of transfer significantly impacts service outcomes. Despite these variations, the fundamental mission of promoting health remained consistent. The study emphasizes the critical role of nurses and recommends further research to identify additional factors that could improve service quality in transferred healthcare facilities, potentially contributing to enhanced healthcare delivery across restructured health systems.

Therefore, it is important to understand the coping strategies employed by this population to navigate minority stress and how coping strategies may impact mental health outcomes. Drawing from a U.S. national diverse sample of 387 queer young adults (ages 18–39 years), we analyzed descriptive results of 11 behavioral strategies to cope with minority stress and used ordered logistic and linear regression to examine the following objectives: the frequency of the use of each coping strategy, and the associations between each strategy and demographic characteristics as well as depression and anxiety. Results revealed that avoidance and talking with friends were the most frequently utilized coping strategies, while prayer/religious activities and counseling/psychotherapy/support groups were infrequently used. We examined utilization preferences of coping strategies across demographic factors (e.g., assigned sex at birth and sexual orientation). The use of counseling/psychotherapy/support group was positively associated with mental health symptoms, while exercise and mindfulness/mediation were associated with lower mental health symptoms. Our findings provide insights for mental health researchers and professionals in selecting appropriate coping strategies for queer young adults in prevention and intervention efforts.

Methods: Using the RE-AIM framework, we assessed Pasos Para Prevenir Cancer for efficacy and potential for sustainability. Survey, administrative, and observational data were collected between 2018 and 2022. The program was evaluated to determine reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Results: Tailoring and adapting to the U.S.–Mexico border context is feasible and necessary to deliver evidence-based healthy eating and active living education content. Pasos Para Prevenir Cancer was well received and delivered in diverse settings with varying linguistic needs. Components of the program were adopted by other organizations and integrated into existing programming. Conclusions: Adapting and tailoring evidence-based programs to improve healthy eating and active living is required to meet the needs of Latino subgroup populations, like those on the U.S.–Mexico border.

To increase the knowledge of OMWW’s biological effects, with an aim to developing a food supplement, we performed a chemical characterisation of the extract using the Liquid Chromatography–Quadrupole Time-of-flight spectrometry (LC–QTOF) and an in vitro genotoxicity/antigenotoxicity assessment on HepaRG ™ cells. Chemical analysis revealed that the most abundant phenolic compound was hydroxytyrosol. Biological tests showed that the extract was not cytotoxic at the lowest tested concentrations (from 0.25 to 2.5 mg/mL), unlike the highest concentrations (from 5 to 20 mg/mL). Regarding genotoxic activity, when tested at non-cytotoxic concentrations, the extract did not display any effect. Additionally, the lowest tested OMWW concentrations showed antigenotoxic activity (J-shaped dose–response effect) against a known mutagenic substance, reducing the extent of DNA damage in the co-exposure treatment. The antigenotoxic effect was also obtained in the post-exposure procedure, although only at the extract concentrations of 0.015625 and 0.03125 mg/mL. This behaviour was not confirmed in the pre-exposure protocol. In conclusion, the present study established a maximum non-toxic OMWW extract dose for the HepaRG cell model, smoothing the path for future research.

Identification of low-health-interest populations is important, but a definition of people with low health interest has not yet been established. We aimed to quantitatively define low-health-interest populations. Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional internet survey was conducted in 2022. We compiled regression tree (RT) analyses with/without adjustment for age, sex, and socioeconomic status with the 12-item Interest in Health Scale (IHS, score range 12–48) as an explanatory variable and the 10 composite health behaviors as a dependent variable. We defined the first IHS branching condition from the root node as a lower-health-interest group and the terminal node with the lowest health behaviors as the lowest-health-interest group. Results: The mean IHS value of 22,263 analyzed participants was 32.1 ± 5.6; it was higher in females and in those who were aged over 45 years, had a high education, a high income, or a spouse. The first branching condition was IHS 31.5, and the terminal node branched at 24.5, before/after adjustment for covariates. Conclusions: We determined the cutoff values of the IHS as <32 for a lower-health-interest group and <25 for the lowest-health-interest group. Using these cutoffs might enable us to reveal the characteristics of low-health-interest populations.

Research has shown the crucial importance of health literacy in everyday life. Nurses play an important role in fostering patients’ health literacy. But there is a lack in research on nurses’ health literacy and how it influences their work. Therefore, this study aims to determine nursing students’ health literacy and find out whether this group assessed that there was a change in their health literacy before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, this study aims to find out whether there is a relation between nursing students’ assessments of their health literacy and their assessments of whether and how they use strategies to foster their patients’ health literary in everyday work. We conducted a longitudinal study with two points of measurement, before the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 112) and after (N = 304). Nursing students filled out an online questionnaire using validated scales. To analyze the data, we used descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and Welch’s t-test. The results show that before the COVID-19 pandemic, the nursing students assessed their health literacy as quite high, and after the COVID-19 pandemic, they found it difficult to access (t = 17.881; p < 0.001; Cohen’s d = 0.46), understand (t = 16.404; p < 0.001; Cohen’s d = 0.56), appraise (t = 15.429; p < 0.00; Cohen’s d = 0.47), and apply health-related information (t = 13.761; p < 0.001; Cohen’s d = 0.54). Implications of our study concern nurses’ vocational education and training in which nurses must learn about health literacy and strategies to foster their patients’ health literacy.

However, for individuals with Young-Onset Dementia (YOD), who have particular symptoms and needs, the content and design of these environments are underexplored. This study aimed to explore the needs of individuals with YOD in a garden setting, to generate design-related knowledge for ‘dementia-friendly’ outdoor environments, while contributing to the field of Evidence-Based Design (EBD). An 8-week long nature-based program was carried out in Alnarp’s rehabilitation garden, a specifically developed garden based on research from e.g., landscape architecture, environmental psychology and medical science. The study used a triangulation of qualitative methods including six participants with YOD and a multidisciplinary team of five staff members. Content analysis was used for all gathered data, including 17 semi-structured interviews with participants with YOD and with staff. Data collection and analysis was performed based on the evidence-based Quality Evaluation Tool (QET). The study led to a target group adapted version of the QET for people with YOD containing 20 developed environmental qualities for designers to pursue in therapeutic gardens, including the additional quality of Calmness. A progression was noted, as a result of perceived positive effects during the intervention, indicating possible change and development of the group’s needs and preferences in the outdoors.

A systematic search identified relevant studies published between 2000 and 2021; no articles found reflected both SRH and TIC principles among refugee women. The search was therefore separated into two aims: to review the literature about SRH needs for refugee women in resettlement countries who experienced GBV (Aim 1) and to examine the use of TIC principles in SRH care among women who experienced GBV (Aim 2). Thematic analysis of the articles identified key themes. Twenty-six articles were included in the analysis across both aims (Aim 1 = 8, Aim 2 = 18). Aim 1 articles shared three factors shaping the SRH needs of resettled refugee women: the centrality of violence and trauma; structural barriers to SRH care; and actions, practices, and resources for service providers. Aim 2 articles illustrated seven key principles of TIC used in SRH service provision, such as empowerment; trauma-specific services and integrated care; connection; safety; collaboration; identity culture and context; and trustworthiness. Resettled refugee women’s experiences of violence necessitate trauma-informed SRH health care. While there is limited peer-reviewed literature regarding TIC-SRH care for refugee women, the findings regarding the SRH needs of refugee women and the findings regarding the implementation of TIC in SRH collectively frame recommendations for how SRH can be infused with TIC. An example from practice, in the form of the Refugee Women’s Health Clinic, is included as an exemplar of TIC SRH principles in action for the health of resettled refugee women who have survived gendered violence.

This investigation assessed relationship intimacy in Pakistani women experiencing trauma symptoms (PTSD) from domestic abuse (DA) who received a culturally informed trauma intervention in a context that differs greatly in values and assumptions about marital relationships relative to Western traditions. Forty women meeting inclusion criteria were assessed on domestic violence type and characteristics (both victim and perpetrator characteristics), PTSD symptomology, and three aspects of relationship intimacy: engagement, communication, and shared friendships. PTSD symptomology and relationship intimacy were reassessed post-intervention. Results indicated significant changes in engagement and communication intimacy following the intervention, with engagement decreasing and communication increasing. The third aspect of intimacy, namely, shared friendships, showed no change. Engagement and overall intimacy showed significant negative correlations with physical abuse, though not with sexual or psychological/emotional abuse. These findings are interpreted within a cultural context where women have few options for leaving an abusive relationship. As such, the results highlight the importance of culture when studying facets of intimate relationships and the need to use culturally informed assessments to better understand the experience of intimacy within abusive relationships.

Given the mixed findings in previous research and the limited specific investigation into the concept of self-stigma within the context of opioid misuse, examining factors associated with self-stigma in the context of opioid use disorder (OUD) is warranted. The current study examines the influence of individual-level factors (race, sex, urban/rural status, support group attendance) on self-stigma and willingness to disclose opioid use. Data for this study were from a larger study of OUD-related stigma among adults in Pennsylvania, U.S. The current study included participants who indicated a personal past or current history with OUD were included (n = 84). Exploratory factor analysis and multiple indicators, multiple causes (MIMIC) model were used to explore the associations between demographic factors (i.e., sex, age, race/ethnicity, urban/rural status), attendance at mutual support groups, and self-stigma factors. Results indicated that sex and attendance at mutual support groups significantly predicted levels of self-stigma. Women and individuals with no previous experience attending mutual support groups endorsed lower levels of self-stigma. Additionally, attendance at mutual support groups predicted willingness to self-disclose past and present opioid use. Individuals who reported no history of attending mutual support groups demonstrated less willingness to disclose past and present OUD use compared to participants who were support group attendees. The current research findings enhance the understanding of OUD-related self-stigma by examining its relationship with individual-level factors, disclosure, and attendance to mutual support groups. The results offer insights into the influence of sex and support group attendance on self-stigma and disclosure. These findings have significant clinical implications for developing future interventions and promoting health policy changes.

We conducted this qualitative study to explore stakeholders’ experiences and preferences of CSE in Kitwe district, Zambia. Methods: We employed a qualitative descriptive design within the interpretive paradigm at nine purposefully selected secondary schools. Data were collected through classroom observation, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions. In depth interviews were undertaken among 21 pupils, 17 teachers, 4 policymakers, 4 parents, and 4 religious leaders. Two focus group discussions were conducted among 14 pupils with each group having seven pupils. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Interviews continued until data saturation. Results: Our analysis yielded themes on stakeholder experiences of CSE which included: a lack of pupil-centred pedagogy; a lack of stakeholder engagement; a lack of CSE competency and skills; holding back culturally sensitive topics; a lack of guidance from the comprehensive sexuality curriculum; and a lack of CSE prioritisation in schools. Themes on preferences included: the formation of community advisory boards; the need to enhance teachers’ professional competencies, linking CSE with community SRH services, pupils SRH needs assessment. Conclusions: A community participatory approach to the design and implementation of a CSE programme is critical in enhancing programme acceptability in schools. While understanding the experiences and preferences of pupils regarding CSE can help determine programme content and priority, improving teachers’ competency and skills through appropriate CSE training can help to reconcile teachers’ personal beliefs and the content of CSE.

However, complications such as transfusion reactions may occur. Knowledge of these reactions is essential for patient safety. Nurses play a crucial role in this process by identifying complications and adverse reactions early on. A lack of professional competence in blood transfusion can lead to errors and serious complications, such as death. The aim of this study was to present evidence of the content validity of a simulated clinical scenario on transfusion reactions for teaching and learning for nursing students. This methodological study was carried out in three phases: (1) development of the simulated scenario of a transfusion reaction; (2) analysis of evidence of content validity by experts (n = 11); and (3) determination of satisfaction and self-confidence in the use of the simulated scenario by the nursing students (n = 45). The Content Validity Index was 94%. After the scenario had been developed, the content was validated and approved by 100% of the experts. All the items in the simulated scenario obtained agreement scores above 0.90. The simulated scenario was validated in terms of content and can be used to teach the management of transfusion reactions.

In general, approximately 40% of survivors experience high levels of fear of recurrence. This study aims to fill this gap by synthesizing the findings of systematic reviews studies investigating ecosystems, correlates or predictors, and barriers and facilitators of fear of cancer recurrence among cancer survivors. An umbrella meta-synthesis was conducted using the following databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, CINAHL, Business source premier, and SOCindex, ending in April 2024 with PRISMA methods. A total of 24 systematic reviews, representing 729 articles, were included in the study. In total, six ecosystems were identified, including family, work, friends, the healthcare system, caregivers, and religion. As part of this umbrella review, 55 specific ecosystemic factors were identified that may contribute to fear of cancer recurrence. Furthermore, the umbrella review identified 12 facilitators and 12 barriers related to fear of cancer recurrence. This umbrella meta-synthesis contributed significantly to our review’s strength in synthesizing the main ecosystem and its influence on fears of cancer recurrence. Understanding the interdependence of ecosystems should enable future research on intervention effectiveness or the development of interventions that could reduce the fear of cancer recurrence.

To inform interventions aimed at reducing sedentary behavior and increasing lifestyle activity, this study examined psychological and behavioral economic factors that may be associated with these behaviors. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 4072 adults in Israel. Participants completed a survey pertaining to lifestyle behaviors and economic preferences using an online platform in September 2020. The psychological and behavioral economic factors of interest were patience, self-control, risk-taking, grit, and general self-efficacy. Sedentary behavior and lifestyle activity (e.g., time spent moving about) was assessed using the Rapid Assessment Disuse Index (RADI) tool (higher score indicative of more sitting and less activity). Multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses examined the association between psychological and behavioral economic factors and RADI score. Among 4072 participants, those who were impatient (vs. patient, β: −1.13; 95% CI: −1.89, −0.38) had higher grit (β: −1.25, 95% CI: −1.73, −0.77), and those who were more risk-seeking (β: −0.23; 95% CI: −0.33, −0.13) had lower RADI scores (i.e., less sedentary, more active). Significant associations for grit and risk-taking were also observed when the RADI score was dichotomized, such that individuals who had higher grit or were more risk-seeking were more likely to be non-sedentary/active. No significant associations were observed for self-control or general self-efficacy. Higher grit and more risk-seeking were associated with a decreased propensity for sedentary behaviors and inactivity; these factors may provide targets for interventions aimed at reducing sedentary behavior and increasing lifestyle activity.

Understanding the neural correlates of mobility limitations is crucial for treating individuals with cerebral palsy (CP). The aim is to summarize the neural correlates of mobility in children with CP and to describe the brain mapping methods that have been utilized in the existing literature. This systematic review was conducted based on PRISMA guidelines and was registered on PROSPERO (n° CRD42021240296). The literature search was conducted in the PubMed and Embase databases. Observational studies involving participants with CP, with a mean age of up to 18 years, that utilized brain mapping techniques and correlated these with mobility outcomes were included. The results were analyzed in terms of sample characteristics, brain mapping methods, mobility measures, and main results. The risk of bias was evaluated using a checklist previously created by our research group, based on STROBE guidelines, the Cochrane Handbook, and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). A total of 15 studies comprising 313 children with CP and 229 with typical development using both static and mobile techniques met the inclusion criteria. The studies indicate that children”with’CP have increased cerebral activity and higher variability in brain reorganization during mobility activities, such as gait, quiet standing, cycling, and gross motor tasks when compared with children with typical development. Altered brain activity and reorganization underline the importance of conducting more studies to investigate the neural correlates during mobility activities in children with CP. Such information could guide neurorehabilitation strategies targeting brain neuroplasticity for functional gains.

This study aimed to identify the dietary patterns of Brazilian adults (20–59 years old; n = 28,153) related to dietary components associated with the risk of obesity. Data from the 2017–2018 Brazilian National Dietary Survey were analyzed. Food consumption was obtained through 24 h recall. Dietary patterns were extracted using partial least squares regression, using energy density (ED), percentage of total fat (%TF), and fiber density (FD) as response variables. In addition, 32 food groups were established as predictor variables in the model. The first dietary pattern, named as energy-dense and low-fiber (ED-LF), included with the positive factor loadings solid fats, breads, added-sugar beverages, fast foods, sauces, pasta, and cheeses, and negative factor loadings rice, beans, vegetables, water, and fruits (≥|0.15|). Higher adherence to the ED-LF dietary pattern was observed for individuals >40 years old from urban areas, in the highest income level, who were not on a diet, reported away-from-home food consumption, and having ≥1 snack/day. The dietary pattern characterized by a low intake of fruits, vegetables, and staple foods and a high intake of fast foods and sugar-sweetened beverages may contribute to the obesity scenario in Brazil.
