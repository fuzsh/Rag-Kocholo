        "text": "Ok, joking with the title. Obviously they had more success than any other nation.\n\nBut seriously, why did they fail to make the semifinals in the last two world cups, when they were considered one of the favorites if not the favorite to win it all?\n\nIs it the coaching holding them back, is it the fact that some of the players are prima donnas and don't care much as some say, or is it that they are not as clearly above everybody else as people think?\n\nQuestions to ponder.\n\nYes. Last World Cup the coach simply stuck to the old farts too long. He made some statement about experience prior to the Cup, and proceeded to start a half team of guys at the end of their useful international careers. This time, Dunga simply was too defensive. And that led him to taking a couple of guys who could have really made a difference. At least that's my opinion. Having said that, Melo was a fool.\n\nInteresting thread.\n\nFirst point is that they lost today to a strong team. Going into the tournament the two teams that I thought offered real value at the bookies were Holland and Germany, though I was wary of Holland due to the fact that they were on course to meet Brazil at this stage.\n\nHaving said that, Brazil didn't play well today and neither did Holland.\n\nBrazil lost to two soft balls in the box, which given the fact that they have two excellent CBs is poor. The best goalkeeper in the world made a very poor mistake, and they showed nothing going forward.\n\nI'm not sure there are systemic reasons behind it, more the fact that good teams can beat each other and that even very good teams have bad days.\n\nWC2006 was a total lazyness, fat players. The end of that team was highly predictable: a defeat sooner or later in the tournament.\n\nWC2010 was a mix of bad choices of benching players (Brasil had no option for Kaka or even for Elano) and a bad day of the defense in a moment when you go back home if you fail (I never saw a fail from Julio Cesar like that one in the first Holland goal). Those errors drove some players nuts and the rest was mere consequence.\n\nAs I see it, this team had no soul. I'm not saying they didn't lose to a good team, but it's how they lost that is the problem.\n\nIt's one thing to be defensive, thinking that you have the players to win the match on a counterattack. But on an elimination match when there are 30 minutes to go and you're down, you have to change your approach. When there are 15 minutes to go, you have to go all out. When there are 5 minutes to go just fight like a madman and put the ball in the penalty area and go fight for it.\n\nThe red card is no excuse. There's no tomorrow and it doesn't matter if you give up two or five goals at that point, you have to go all out to try to score. Brazil never went all out, they never fought, they never sweated, they never seemed to be able to get out of Dunga's conservative system, not even with the match and the tournament on the line.\n\nThey were winning without breaking a sweat, and they lost without breaking a sweat. Disappointing.\n\nWell, let's look at the goals that took them out: 1) T Henry scores, unmarked for France while R. Carlos is tying his shoelaces; 2) O.G. today.\n\nClearly, mistakes like these against high quality teams don't leave you in a very good position. Not only that, but they kill any potential counter-attacking situation, and Brazil has largely based their team around this. Pretty simple on the surface level, IMO. The deeper question is why Brazil has trouble offensively against 2 DM teams.\n\nIf you say that 2006's team had no soul, I'd completely agree with you. To say that 2010's team has no soul is just because you probably are not a brazilian and have just a superficial knowledgment about these brazilian players outside the pitch. It's not a criticism, don't get me wrong, it's just a misjudgement.\n\nWhen Holland got the equalize, Brasil got extremely nervous (I don't know why). From that point on, Holland took the leadership of the match, soon scored again, Felipe was sent out and everything ruined.\n\nIt has nothing to do with soul. It was all about desperation and mind state. Clearly, brazilian players weren't prepared to handle with negative situations in a critical context like a WC quarter-final match.\n\nIndeed. Above all else, I think the issue today was simply luck. And in our case, a lack thereof.\n\nThe supposed best goalkeeper in the world committed what was perhaps the worst-ever defensive mistake I've ever seen from Brazil. Really. Julio Cesar. Still really hard to believe.\n\nI mostly agree with BlackDiamond.\n\n2006 Brazil was one of the greatest collections of football talent ever in my opinion. And like BlackDiamond said, fat and lazy. No team effort, noone was willing to run.\n\n2010, they just weren't as great as everyone thought... For me, it was a bit the opposite to 2006, too many workers, not enough flair. They did not have the players to take apart a good, agressive midfield and defense. At least to a certain extent, Dunga is to blame, for not bringing another creative player or 2 to South Africa. 4 strikers is enough, but there were no real replacements for Kaka or Elano in the squad. Though even with a different selection, I'm just not sure Brazil has the players to expect to easily beat Holland these days - a bit of bad luck, a mistake of the goalkeeper... it's one game of 2 very good teams, it can always end either way.\n\nI already had thsi discussion before with one of the Brazillians. Everyone says Elano and Kaka were not enough, but who else could play? This WC is all about lackage of playmakers, not only in BRA\n\nBecause other teams are closing the talent gap and now the game is so much more tactical. The differences are scarce.\n\nNo more parity as far as the top teams are concerned and even the mid-top tier teams like the U.S., Uruguay, Ghana, Paraguay, Japan, SK etc. etc. Any of those teams can give Brasil a run whereas back even in the late 1990s the gap was a lot wider.\n\nRonaldinho, obviously. Carlos Alberto, Anderson Oliveira, Diego Ribas. I believe Vagner Love can play am, though I have no idea how he does these days, and I'm pretty sure one or the other good player is running around in the Brasileiro as well.\n\nMaybe Kleberson and Julio Baptista were just thoroughly disappointing, but reading comments from Brazilians about the selection, I'm pretty convinced a defender or dm less and some kind of a quick, creative am or winger to bring on in the 2nd half or in case of injury/suspension would have been a good idea.\n\nThere's a lot of bashing of the 2006 team when it wasn't a lot worse than this one. Sure their group was easy but they still put up a clinic in the first round, followed by solid routings of Japan and Ghana. Scored more goals, conceded fewer goals and won one more game instead of that pitiful draw we saw with Portugal this year. If a fat and lazy team could manage those kinds of results... it'd be scary to see what they could've done if they were actually motivated\n\nThat team was all talent and no heart, this one was all heart and, relatively speaking, less talent. Claiming this team had \"no soul\" is a bit baseless - They were frustrated and clearly emotionally invested into the game.\n\nbut cesar showed at other times this season his main weakness is crosses/high balls, and some poor catches and punches. This season was not his best season imo\n\noh well, brazil still has a ton of good talent and I feel that this year coming up pato will finally have a breakout season. he and robinho should be quite the pair over the next few years.\n\nBrazil is the 5th-largest country in the World, no other great soccer nation has even half the population Brazil has. It is no surprise that Brazil has been ranked #1 in the world in the monthly rankings for 12 years and 3 months out of the last 16 years. Only 4 other teams have been ranked #1 during that time, and only for totals of 6 months to 1 year and 4 months... nobody is close to Brazil's 12 years and 3 months... how are they different from Team USA in basketball?\n\nYou really can't compare basketball and football. There isnt a gap between Brazil and the rest of the world as deep as the one between USA basketball team and the others.\n\nIt's unfair to suppose that Brazil will win or reach the WC final every 1 in 2. There are several strong and traditional teams that can confortably beat Brazil. Don't forget that we were absent from the final game for 24 years (1970-1994).\n\nDo you really give that damn to the FIFA ranking? It means nothing.\n\nJust look at the ranking released soon after WC2006 ended.\n\n1º Brasil\n\n2º Itália\n\n3º Argentina\n\n4º França\n\n5º Inglaterra\n\n6º Holanda\n\n7º Espanha\n\n8º Portugal\n\n9º Alemanha\n\n10º República Tcheca\n\nBrazil got eliminated early in the tournament but sustained the first place ahead of the champions. France, the runner-up, just 4th. What's the logic?"
