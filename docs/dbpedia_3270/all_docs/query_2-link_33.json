        "text": "The results validated the proposed model. The results also showed that the greater the identification of the sports consumer with his team, the greater the impact on his satisfaction, increasing his loyalty to the team and his intention to buy tickets for a soccer match. It was also detected that the higher the risk perception, the lower the purchase intention of tickets. In addition, the study showed that the greater the involvement of sports consumers with soccer, the greater their intention to buy tickets.\n\nOne of the academic implications was to prove that team identification can be a predictor of satisfaction, and that the interrelationship between identification with the team, satisfaction at attending soccer matches at the stadium and loyalty to the team constructs has a high impact on the purchase decision of the sports consumer. In addition, the study tests a model that aggregates several constructs with empirical data for other researchers to better understand the phenomenon of attendance in stadiums and arenas."
