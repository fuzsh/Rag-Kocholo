        "meta_description": "In the last decade, injury prevention has received a lot of attention in sports medicine, and recently international sports-governing bodies, such as the International Olympic Committee, declared the protection of the athletes’ health as one of their major objectives. \n\nIn 1994, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) established its Medical Assessment and Research Centre (F-MARC) with the aim ‘to prevent football injuries and to promote football as a health-enhancing leisure activity, improving social behaviour’. Since then, FIFA has developed and evaluated its injury-prevention programmes ‘The 11’ and ‘FIFA 11+’ have demonstrated in several scientific studies how simple exercise-based programmes can decrease the incidence of injuries in amateur football players. This paper summarises 18 years of scientific and on-field work in injury prevention by an international sports federation (FIFA), from formulating the aim to make its sport safer to the worldwide dissemination of its injury-prevention programme in amateur football.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nFootball is played on an amateur or recreational level by almost 300 million people all over the world.1 Besides being a healthy leisure activity, football, as a contact team sport, has a certain risk of injury. The medical treatment of football-related injuries could have a significant socioeconomic impact: for example, in Switzerland (with 7.9 million inhabitants), the healthcare costs for football injuries were nearly US$170 million in 2010.2\n\nThere is extensive literature on the frequency and characteristics of football injuries,3–7 and several scientific studies on injury-prevention programmes in amateur football players have been published.8–25 However, the implementation of injury-prevention programmes in the real world of sports represents a major challenge.26 ,27 However the effectiveness of countrywide campaigns to reduce the incidence of football injuries has been proven.28 ,29\n\nIn 1994, Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) founded its Medical Assessment and Research Centre (F-MARC) in order to create and disseminate scientific knowledge on various medical topics in football, to reduce football injuries and to promote football as a health-enhancing leisure activity.\n\nEighteen years later, this paper summarises the historical background, development, scientific evaluation and dissemination strategies of FIFA’s injury-prevention programmes (‘FIFA 11+’) in order to provide a model of how an international sports federation can make its sport safer.\n\nLessons learnt\n\nThe F-MARC team has gained experience during the years of dissemination of the injury-prevention programmes. It has been found that understanding the coach's character and highlighting the importance of the programme to the coach is especially important. Preventing injuries and thereby reducing the number of injured players means that the coach will have more players available for his/her ideal team. Therefore, it is not only information and education about the role of injury prevention that is important, but also speaking the same language as the coach. One of the keys while conducting a course is of ‘proposing’ rather than ‘imposing’ ‘FIFA 11+’. The dialogue on the pitch with coaches is often more important than the distributed materials, thus allowing for friendly discussion and practical work with the preventive programme. Therefore, the choice of the instructors is crucial and F-MARC's best experiences have been with sports physiotherapists or athletic trainers who have an active involvement in football, because they already ‘live and speak the football language’. Additionally, the cooperation with famous players and coaches acting as ‘FIFA 11+’ ambassadors (see teaser on https://vimeo.com/45562029 and http://www.f-marc.com/11plus) has helped significantly in the communication with coaches. ‘FIFA 11+’ has also been presented to the delegates of all MAs at the last two FIFA Medical Conferences (Zürich 2009, Budapest 2012). After initial enthusiasm from the interested MAs, F-MARC has experienced a wide range of dedication and compliance from those MAs to the proposed ‘FIFA 11+’ implementation guidelines. At the MA level, it has to be acknowledged that highly motivated people are needed in order to successfully plan, realise and constantly monitor a countrywide implementation."
