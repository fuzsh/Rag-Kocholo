        "text": "The FIFA World Player of the Year award is given annually to the football player who is voted as the best in the world. Here are all the award winners since 1991. Since 2004 the voting process is based on a shortlist of 35 players produced by FIFA, from which team captains, national team managers and select journalists vote for the winner.\n\nFrom 2010 until 2015, the FIFA player of the year award was merged with the Ballon d'Or and called the FIFA Ballon d'Or. Compare this list to the player of the year according to World Soccer magazine, and also the female player of the year.\n\nIncluding the FIFA Ballon d'Or (years 2010-2015), Lionel Messi has won the award eight times, with Cristiano Ronaldo having won it five times.\n\nThe 2016 and 2017 winner of the FIFA World Player of the Year winner was Cristiano Ronaldo, who also won the Ballon d'Or for the same periods. In 2018 he failed to win the hat-trick, polling second behind Croatian Luka ModriÄ. In 2022, Messi won the award for the 7th time.\n\nIn 2023, Messi and Erling Haaland both scored 48 points, requiring a tiebreaker to decide the winner. Messi was the winner based on receiving more points from national captains.\n\nRelated Pages\n\nFIFA Awards, including the female FIFA player of the year.\n\nList of winners of the Ballon d'Or award\n\nComparison of three player of the year awards\n\nFootball Awards Lists\n\nMore Soccer Lists\n\nMore sporting lists\n\nOld Comments\n\nCommenting is closed on this page, though you can read some previous comments below which is interesting to read, and may answer some of your questions."
