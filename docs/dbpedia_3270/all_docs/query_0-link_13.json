        "text": "Discussion\n\nSagittal alignment demonstrates trunk balance axis and embraces osteoarticular (spinopelvic parameters) and muscle elements24,25). Sagittal imbalance is associated with increased energy expenditure as the individual compensates to stay as erect as possible, causing pain, muscle fatigue, and functional disability17,26,27).\n\nThis system can be evaluated clinically and through radiographs. The advantage of radiographic markers is to provide data for objective evaluation. These parameters document the position of the axis involving the head, spine, and pelvis. They are divided into the pelvic and spinal parameters28-30).\n\nPI ( ) is described as an anatomical parameter exclusive to each individual, regardless of the spatial orientation of the pelvis. The SS and PT ( ) are non-fixed positional parameters. The anatomical parameter (PI) is the algebraic sum of the positional parameters, that is, SS PT: PI=SS+PT26-29).\n\nThe pelvis is an essential structure in the human locomotor mechanism. The sacrum, considered a “pelvic vertebra,” forms a connection between the trunk and the lower limbs, in addition to being the point of transfer of load from the trunk to the pelvis. As the femoral heads are highly mobile, they play a key role in the spatial orientation of the pelvis30,31).\n\nThe PT determines the sagittal position of the S1 plateau in relation to the femoral heads. Lordosis is closely related to the orientation of the pelvis, expressed by the SS, which is strongly influenced by the PI. There is a significant chain of interdependence between the pelvic and spinal parameters. Therefore, a low angular value of the PI implies low values of pelvic parameters and rectification of lordosis. Similarly, a high angular value of PI implies high values of pelvic parameters and pronounced lordosis30,31).\n\nSpinal parameters consist of the LL angle between L1 and S1, measured using the Cobb method; the thoracic kyphosis angle between T1 and T12 is also measured using the same method. The SVA ( ) is used to document the location of the head in relation to the normal center of gravity. The Scoliosis Research Society described the normal SVA when a plumb line, drawn from the center of the C7 body, is located ±2 cm from the posterior edge of the S1 plateau32-34).\n\nLL should not be studied as a single curve. The upper arc of the LL is equal to the lower arc of thoracic kyphosis, and the second lower (distal) arc of lordosis corresponds to the SS, which means that it has substantial importance in determining global lordosis15).\n\nThis classification system considers the position of the apex of the thoracic and lumbar curves, the position of the inflection point, the number of vertebral bodies in each curvature, the total kyphosis, the lordosis in degrees, the angle of inclination of the inferior lordotic arch, and the angle of the sacral inclination15).\n\nSeveral factors may modify lordosis and sagittal balance: age, sex, weight, height, ethnicity, heredity, occupational activity, muscle strengthening, and sports practices15,28,35).\n\nCertain sports modalities demonstrate a higher incidence of postural disorders, in adolescent athletes14). Todd et al. studied young elite skiers and found a different spinopelvic sagittal alignment compared with that of the control group (similar ages)29). Other studies also found differences in the sagittal alignment and spinopelvic angles in volleyball players, Olympic weightlifters, and swimmers when compared to non-athletes14,30,31).\n\nThe normal development of the sagittal curvatures of the spine depends on the interaction between hereditary growth factors and the mechanical environment in which the spine develops. Strenuous exercises can have deleterious effects on immature bone structure, damaging the growth plate, which can cause growth abnormalities36).\n\nAbdominal and lumbar musculature (spinal erectors), hamstrings, gluteus maximus, iliopsoas, and rectus femoris may influence LL and PT mainly28).\n\nThe strength of the relationship between trunk flexors and extensors may influence LL and spinopelvic angles levels. Abdominal muscle weakness may induce pelvic anteversion, which increases lordosis and SS. On the other hand, strengthening abdominal muscles may cause pelvic retroversion, which rectifies lumbar curvature and increases PT. The same occurs to lumbar musculature, which may cause pelvic anteversion and lordotic increase when strengthened. On the other hand, the shortening of hamstrings and gluteus maximus causes retroversion of the pelvis and a lordosis decrease, while iliopsoas and rectus femoris have antagonistic action28,32) ( ).\n\nComparing sagittal alignment and spinopelvic parameters in football (soccer) players and the control group, Wodecki et al. found a significant difference in means of PI (55.7°×50.3°), thoracic kyphosis (36.4°×41.87°), and SS (41.4°×36.6°). They also found a higher mean of LL (44.2°×39.1°) without a statistical significance. Authors credited those results to an action of the musculature during athletes' skeletal muscle development33), as well as differences between the biotype of the population, type of training, and the beginning of age for sports training; however, more studies must be carried out to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nDespite PI being a fixed morphological angle, some authors believe that it may be influenced by sports activities during growth according to muscle demands. Muscle stress, which is associated with mechanical restrictions and constitutional characteristics, may influence spine and pelvis architecture during development28,34,36).\n\nIn Pratali et al.21) study, a comparison of the spinopelvic parameters of Brazilian professional football (soccer) players took place with a mean of 25 Brazilian male individuals with the same ages. It was verified that PI value was similar (50.3°×49.1°), but PT and SVA showed statistically lower values in professional players (P=0.013) and (P=0.037). A hypothesis would be a greater strengthening of hip flexor and knee extensor muscles used frequently in the act of kicking the ball, which would promote pelvic anteversion in football (soccer) players33,35).\n\nWhen comparing LL values of professional football (soccer) players with that of the Brazilian male gender individuals in the same ages, we verifed similar values (54.8°×59.3°), according to Damasceno et al.22) study.\n\nWhen contrasting values obtained from Brazilian football (soccer) players with those from young French players, similar mean values for SS (41.9°×41.4°) were found, as well as lower values for PI (50.3°×55.7°) and PT (8.5°×14.3°) and higher values to LL (54.8°×44.2°). Nonetheless, a statistical analysis did not take place for that comparison. As variations may be related to body size, type of training and the age at which training started, further studies are needed to determine the cause of those variations.\n\nWhen Brazilian football (soccer) players were compared to Swedish elite skiers in a similar age group29), a different distribution related to type of lordosis was verified. These variations were noticed as follows: Type 1 (6.7%×18.2%), Type 2 (11.5%×4.5%), Type 3 (55.8%×59.1%), and Type 4 (26.9%×18.2%). They demonstrate a higher frequency of Type 1 lordosis in Swedish skiers and Type 4 in Brazilian football (soccer) players. Such distinctions may be related to the sporting gestures inherent in the modalities. The adoption and improvement of complex movements and postures through sport are products of the interaction of the human body with the environment through movements, by reacting and responding quickly to changes in the circumstances to which the individual is exposed36).\n\nOf the muscle groups that can influence LL and PT, the following stand out: abdominal and lumbar muscles (spinal erectors); hamstrings; maximum gluteus; iliopsoas; and rectus femoris28,32).\n\nThe strength ratio between trunk flexors and extensors can influence the degree of LL and spinopelvic angles. Abdominal muscle weakness may allow for anteversion of the pelvis, which causes increased lordosis and SS. On the other hand, strengthening can cause retroversion of the pelvis, straightening the lumbar curvature and increasing the PT. The same reasoning applies to the lumbar musculature, which can cause anteversion of the pelvis and the increased lordosis when strengthened. In turn, the shortening of the hamstrings and the gluteus maximus causes retroversion of the pelvis and a decrease in lordosis, while the iliopsoas and rectus femoris have an antagonistic action28) ( ).\n\nA hypothesis for the change in Roussouly's type of classification is the alteration of the musculature, which could be the factor in the alteration of the PT. As the PI is a fixed angle that does not change due to environmental factors and is the algebraic sum of the SS and PT, this could justify professional soccer players having a higher classification in the Roussouly Type 3 classification than the general population and a higher incidence in Type 4 than the original work by Roussouly15); however, no statistical evaluation was carried out, and more work needs to be done to prove this hypothesis.\n\nRoussouly et al. described four types of LL, which may suggest a tendency toward degenerative evolution and pathological balance. Regarding lordosis Type 1, there is a hypothesis of a risk of retrolisthesis in the hyperlordotic area, and of spondylolysis of L5 due to the “nutcracker” effect. With regard to lrdosis Type 2, there is a hypothesis that it is more associated with symptomatic disk herniation. Regarding lordosis Type 3, the spine is well balanced, and patients with symptomatic complaints are rarely found. With regard to lordosis Type 4, there is a hypothesis that it is more associated with isthmic lysis, degenerative spondylolisthesis between L4 and L5, and vertebral stenosis15).\n\nSports that require repeated hyperextension and rotation movements are related to stress fracture of the pars interarticularis (spondylolysis). This injury becomes even more common in young athletes and those with increased LL13,37,38). Spondylolysis is a common cause of lumbar pain in young athletes. A study conducted with athlete's age below 18 found spondylolysis in 47% of athletes with chronic lumbar pain. According to Selhorst et al., the risk of an athlete with lumbar pain, presenting spondylolysis may vary according to the kind of sports modality9,13). It has been suggested that the kicking mechanism, associated with rotational and flexion-extension movements of the trunk at high speed, can generate overload and be responsible for lumbar spondylolysis in soccer players37-40).\n\nNo athlete had chronic lumbar pain in the analyzed sample. Spondylolysis was identified in eight (7.7%) athletes, and seven (6.7%) of those also had spondylolisthesis with an incidence higher than 6%, described in the literature for the general population37-41), but lower to a mean of 13.35% found in football (soccer) players, according Tawfik et al.41).\n\nOther factors related to postural changes in athletes, such as weight, height, and body mass index, were not evaluated, this being a study limitation. Furthermore, football (soccer) players sporting gestures may differ significantly, depending on the position the athlete performs. That analysis was not conducted as well.\n\nAlthough we know the anatomy and function of each muscle group inserted or original from spine and pelvis, the effects of the asymmetric strengthening of musculature on posture and on radiographic alteration view of spinopelvic angles and sagittal balance are not clear. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of different sports on these parameters."
