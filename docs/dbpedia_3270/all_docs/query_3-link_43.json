These chapters Country Profile, The Society, Government and Politics, The Economy, Military Geog- raphy, Transportation and Teiecommunications, Armed Forces, Science, and Intelligence and Security, provic the primary NIS coverage. Some chapters, particularly Science and Intelligence and Security, that are not pertinent to all countries, are produced selectively. For small ountries requiring only minimal NIS treatment, the General Survey coverage may be bound into one volume. Supplementing the General Survey is the NIS Basic Intelligence Fact book, a ready reference publication that semiol.nual!y updates key sta- tistical data found in the Survey. An unclassified edition of the factbook omits some details on the economy, the defense forces, and the intelligence and security organ;zations. Although detailed sections on many topics were part of the NIS Program, production or these sections has been phased out. Those pre- viously produced will continue to by available as long as the major portion of the study is considered valid. A quarterly listing of all active NIS units is published in the Inventory of Available NIS Publications, which is also boun,J into the concurrent classified Foctbook. The Inventory lists all NIS units by area name and number and includes classification and date of issue; it thus facilitates the ordering of NIS units as wall as their filing, cataloging, and utilization. Initial dissemination, additional copies of NIS units, or separate chapters of the General Surveys can be obtained directly or through liaison channels from the Central Intelligence Agency. The General Survey is prepared for the NIS by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency under the general direction of the NIS Committee. It is coordi -iated, edited, published, and dissemi- nated by the Central Intelligence Agency.

Native Brazilian children attend school with children of Italian, German, and Japanese immigrants (U/OU) created so genetically complex a population that some authorities consider Brazilians to he a new and distinct people. European civilization, especially the traditions, customs, and language of Portugal �and, to a degree, the traditions and customs of Italy �form the basis for Brazilian culture. Al the same time, the tropical environment and elements from various other Enropean, African, and Amerindian traditions have contributed to the development of a uniquely Brazilian character and culture. The national characteristic of cultural absorption and metamorpho- sis led Brazilian anthropologist Gilberto Freyre to call Brazil a \"tropical China.\" The unassimilated Indian elerneni is very small approximately 2% of the total population according to a 1960 estimate, and much less than that today. Largely because of the sparsity of the indigenous inhabitants and the primitive level of their civilization, Indian influence on Brazilian culture and physical appearance has not been great, although Indian names for places, animals, and plants survive throughout Brazil. Unlike the Aztec, Maya, and Inca civilizations, whose highly developed cultures resisted the European imprint, the Brazilian aborigines lived at a hunting and food gathering level of development and were comparatively p;iant and vulnerable. Although there were five main linguistic groups within the territory which is now Brazil (the Tupi- Guarani along the coast, the Tapuya in the northeastern area, the Arawak in western Amazonas, the Caribs in the northern and central areas, and the Guaycurn in Mato Grosso), they lived in hundreds of small, isolated, and nonwdic hands. Even within the main language groups, there. was little bond in linguistic affinities; most groups were either unacquainted with or hostile toward others. Following the period of European exploration and settlement, the indigenous population for the mos part gas decimated by disease, slaver%, and force of arms, or was eventually absorbed into the mixed portion of Brazil's population. Most of the Indians who continue to folio a tribal way of life live in the northern and ycstern border regions and in the upper Amazon Basin. Indians in an ear y stage of assimilation are located mainly across the northern part of the country and in some western areas. Bringing with them a technologically superior civilization, the Portuguese subjugated and exploited the natives, forcing them to supply labor for the economic development of the new settlements. Some Indians resisted, and many fled into the interior. Many were willing to accept the protection of the Jesuit missionaries, who played an important role in the early history of Brazil by dedicating themselves to the protection and conversion of the Indians. 'I'll( activities of the Jesuits aroused the resentment of the plantation owners, but the missionaries won it partial victory in the Crowns decision in 1574 which granted the Jesuits control over Indians resettled in villages but which allowed the colonists to enslave I captured in warfare. Many Jesuits took up arms against their own countrvmen in defense of their Indian wards; this was probably a contributing factor to the expulsion of the Jesuits from Brazil in 1759. The Indians for both psychological and physical reasons were poorly adapted to plantation labor, and, with the introduction of sugarcane in the mid -16th century, the need for labor became acute As it result, the colonists turned to importing slaves from Africa. At least 4 million and perhaps as many as 18 million Negroes were brought to Brazil by the middle of the 19th century. Most came from the west coast of Africa, but so re were imported from Arabic speaking areas, such as the Sudan. Negroes and persons of mixed Negro and white ancestry are found throughout Brazil, but the African element predominates in the State of Bahia and along the cast coast as far south as Rio de Janeiro. In these areas, African traits survive in language, dress, food preparation, music and dance, folk tales, and religious cults. Many of these cultural traits have not been confined to the Negro portion of the population, but have been incorporated into the regional culture. The white or near white population, while located throughout the country, predominates in the southern States of Sao Paulo,' Santa Catarina, Parana, and Rio 'For diacritics on place names see uugi, Figure I. and the list of names at the en:l of the chapter.

Mane European immigrants settled in these states because the climate permitted the same mixed type of farming they had practiced in Europe. Not only have the white, black, and Indian racial groups been together in Brazil for about 400 years, but conditions have been conducive to miscegenation. Vew women arrived with the early Portuguese colonists. The :absence of white women, therefore, coupled Nyith the inferior status of women in general and the superior status of the white men, gave early settlers almost ace i+ampered access to Indian women, especially slaves. The importation of African slaves resulted in a comparable pattern. Consequently, a large group of racially mixed pe s: n% developed within it few generations. There was relatively little crossbreeding between the Indian and Negro, however, largely because of the culturally detenn :ned division of labor among the Indians. Agricultural work was considered woman's work, so the India men fled the plantations; African men were more tractable and accepted agricultural duties, causing the Indian women to despise them. The only immigrant group which resisted assimilation into the Brazilian population until the late 1950's was the Japanese. They settled mostly .round Sao Paulo, where many were originally employed on coffee farms. Manny, especially younger Japanese, have since shifted to family truck farms or have moved into cities. There are now about 600,000 people of Japanese ancestry in Brazil. 2. Language (U /OU) Portuguese, the national language, is spoken by more than 98% of the people. Inasmuch as Brazil *F population constitutes nea.,ly half that of the continent and in several Andean countries a large percentage of the people continue to speak only Amerindian languages, Portuguese is probably more widely spoken in South America than is Spanish. The Brazilian takes pride in his national language and continually :seeks new ways to express himself, delighting; in word inventions and colorful phrases. Portuguese as spoken by most Brazilians, therefore, often differs significantly from the forms taught in the schools, which are based on the language spoken in Portugal, with traditional rules and literary usage. A law sanctioned in 1938 requires that all instruction must be given in Portuguese, and courses in the language, given by native speakers, are compulsory. Names of enterprises, such as businesses, cooperatives, and foreign agricultural colonies, must be in Portuguese. Immigrants are encouraged to learn the language as rapidly as possible, and the great majority of them. originating in countries where languages of Latin derivation are spoken, experience little difficult in doing so. The linguistic- similarities of Spanish and Italian, for example, may he influential in accelerating the process of acculturation among these immigrants. The principal Indian languages �Tupi, Ge. Carib. Arawak, and Nambicuara �are still spoken but by only a fe%y isolated remnants of the Indian population. When the Portuguese first arrived in Brazil_ Tupi was generally spoken among the natives along the coast and throughout the Amazon Bain. The Jesuits learned Tupi and used it as a means c;f communica- tion among even those Indians whose native language was cif a different stock. It eventual) I ecame the lingua franca, popular among all segments of the population except for the socia', elite, and in Maranhao and Para it was used exclusively in the pulpit. It appear(-(] for it time that it would become the language of Brazil, or at least it second language. since the ratio of Tnpi speakers to Portuguese speakers in 17th and early 18th century Brazil was three to one. Portuguese was. however, the official language and the necessary one for communicating with the rnotlrc r country. In the 18th century it number of outstanding literary works, including the renowned dictionary by Antonio de Morais Silva, renewed interest in Portuguese. All this literary activity, coupled with the expulsion of the Jesuits, Nvho Were the principal popularizers and promoters of Tupi, assured the supremacy of the Portuguese language in Brazil. The direct rivalry between Portuguese and Tupi can be attributed to the relative purity that Portuguese retained in the New World. Portuguese was reserved for the intellectuals and upper socia! str:ua of the colony, who took pride in the purity (that is, similarity to the F,uropean language) Nvilh which they used it. Not until the 19th century, when it began to Filter clown to all the social levels, did Portuguese come into contact with both Indian and African languages and undergo chaange to any extent. Both Tupi and t1w African languages contributed significantly to the vocabulary but had no apparent influence on the structure of Braziliau Portuguese. Although Por- tuguese remains effectively the sane language as that spoken in Portugal, the vocabulary and pronunciation of the average Brazilian differ enough to complicate communication with it native of Portugal. Regional linguistic differences are readily apparent, but they constitute no harrier to understanding. Variations occur mainly in slang vocabular and in APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200080016 -0 J 0 pronunciation. particularly of %o%%el sounds.

I'll(- speech of an educated person or one of t'te upper levels of Society (the teo are usually synonymous) more c�losek resembles that of Portugal and carries prestig The value placed upon a regional variation, however, depends on the circle of listeners. Of all the regional variations, the idiom of Rio de Janeiro exerts the strongest influence because of its use on radio and television programs broadcast from Rio and heard throughout it considerable area of the country. A (carioca (native of Rio de Janeiro) hss departed most sharply from traditional Portuguese. Ife generally speaks very rapidly, slurring his words and pronunciation. The main characteristics of the speech of Rio appear throughout most of Minas Gerais, lapirito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro States. The South, particularly the State of Rio Grande do Sul, exhibits other variations in speech, such as the use of clear final vowel sounds and the strongly rolled double r, which are probably the result of linguistic diffusion from Spanish-speaking Urugnav and Argentina. The Pct� li.sta pronunciation in Sao Paolo resembles this speech and contrasts with that of the carioca. In the Northeast, unstressed vo-el sounds are more open than anywhere else in the country and, as in the other regions, it large number of purely local terms and expressions distinguish speakers from this area. Knowledge of more than one language is considered to be it sign of education and carries prestige. In the 19th century, when French manner aad customs were highly regarded by all Brazilians, French was the secorc i language aniong the educated elite. Although still popular, it has been surpassed by English, which is considered to he of greater commercial value. Bec�a11se of the emphasis on acculturation, few children of immigrants, except ill the most rural areas, retain the language of their parents. The retention of foreign language and cultural traits on the part of immigrant groups, especially those Isom Germany and Japan, was viewed %with disfavor by ,any Brazilians, Who considered it a threat to national unity. )luring the Vargas era. these foreign elements were (lesc�ribed as e\\ in the hod% politic, and various policies were instituted to encourage assimilation, such as the legal prohibition of elementary education in foreign languages.

I The family (U /OU) The most striking and perhaps the ,lost rele\\anl single aspect of Brazilian culture is the fancily. In all othcrwis(� individualistic or amorphous social system, the extended family has developed it strong sense of community and cooperation among its ,u�nnbers. 'I'll(- highly valued self- direc�tedness ae!I self- suffic�icnc�y of the personality, although respected %within the fancily, do not interfere with the obligations of faun!\\ membership. On the contrary, there is it tendency to yal)^ the individual socially as it nu�,iber of a given kin group rather than an isolated personality. Thus� personal status has traditionally been derived fro, family status. The structure of the modern farnil\\ has peen idluencc�d h\\ the colonial plantation funnily system, in which it large, extended family lived under one roof, sharing domestic tasks, in an isolated frontier environment. Controlled by a powerful patriarch, the s\\stera included numerous distant relatives, cntplo\\- ees, and slaves who were all de�pcndent un the family fortunes. The kinship ties were thus reinforced by interdependence, c�omnion re%idet.c�e, participation in a c�onunon industry, and the sharing of i t c�onu,on culture. Vario,s social ac t iyitie usually to conimemorate it family event, c�onstantl_y s(r\\ed as it reminder to the fancily of its unity. The fancily maintains its prcdoncinant role in the societ and is the focal point of social life. although )here is a tendency, particularly in the urban areas, to expand the circle to include a larger noinher d friends and acquaintances. In upperand niiddleclass families it large network of kin is important for the ec�ononcic advancement and social life of the individual, and, (Well aniong the poorest people i, the urban slum.. the family structure is the most powerful cohesive force. Nevertheless, the mod( rn family is beginning to lose its all- (nhracing quality under the influence of urbanization and ec)nomic diversification, %chieh adds to the opporttmities for it young person to live \"without the assistance of his fannil\\ and in it different household.

Most individuals still maintain contact with a large number of more distant relatives, however, and a man with a large family is envied. The complete network of kin, either paternally or maternally related to a person through blood, marriage, or godparent tie and which he recognizes as his kinsmen, are known as his parentela. Depending on the stabilit of his community and his class background, this group may be msignif-cant or as large as an entire village. The large parentela is more characteristic of the upper and middle classes, both in the city and in the country, than it is of the lower classes. In areas where the upper classes are descendants of the plantation aristocracy, the parentela is particularly influential. Marriage is likely to occur within the class of the parents and often in the same town, strengthening the tics between the major families. Often a distant relative is chosen as a compadre (godparent), in which case the relationship is close and lasting. Nonrelatives, however, can also be named. They become ritual kin of the child and thus enlarge his kinship circle. There is a tendency among lower class parents to name as godparent a more prosperous individual who can be of assistance to the child. Migration has had a detrimental effect on the kinship group, especially in the lower classes, where the migration of a family member usually means loss of contact with him altogether, since most of these families are illiterate. The middle class individual too is cut off from the larger family by migration between towns and movement between classes. Thus, the extended family is most often found in the traditional upper classes. The upper and the middle class urban families are similar in most respects hilt the latter usually has fewer kin. Frequently, the middle class individual has either moved from one area to another or one class to another, losing contact with the rest of his kin group in the process; however, he usually values large, extended families. In rural areas, the middle and upper classes both h ave more extensive ties than the lower classes. Middle and upper class women tend to work in hanks, stores, offices, and in social service fields. In 1968 nearly all of the elementary school teachers and half of the secondary school teachers were women. In general, the lower class family tends to be unstable and lacks the large cohesive parentela of the other classes, since the economic basis of the family is uncertain and children must often migrate to other areas for better economic opportunities. Rural f amilies that own land are more apt to be stable, since the family can remain in the same area. In the drought ridden Northeast many families are left to tale care and control of the mother while the father migrates in search of work. The father is apt to send money to support his family when he finds work, and he may even return. In the meantime, strong ties continue between the mother and her in -laws, as well as with her own family. Over half of Brazil's population is urban; the rate of migration to the city has been especially high since 1950. The lower class family has been most decph affected by this tre�d, since most of the migrants come from this stratum, entering the ranks of the poorest in the city. Although many migrants simply move from one rural area to another seeking a better situation, some migrate to nearby towns and perhaps later to large cities. In a study in 1966 it was found that most migrants who moved from one rural area to another took their wives and children with them, but of the migrants to Brasilia, only one -third came with their families, one -third planned to send for their wives aold children later, and one -third %were single. Those who came together, however, came by mutual consent. All but about 13% of the group that moved to Brasilia decided jointly to move. Among migrants in the urban population women slightly outnumber men. Many such women find jobs as domestics and arc unwilling to sacrifice their independence for a permanentl binding marriage, while others are forced to remain spinsters because of a shortage of men. Both groups add to the number of women who engage in temporary relationships rather than permanent marriages. Marriages can be formalized by either civil or religious authorities. C ivil marriage constitutes recognition of the uni(,n by the state, it insures social security and official recognition of the marriage for the purposes of inheritance. Church marriage is the traditional form of establishing a union and continues to be the accepted norm in isolated rural communities. Upper and middle class couples almost invariably have both forms; lower class families have only the religious ceremonies or, in many cases, dispense with a formal marriage altogether. A type of common law marriage called anursiado, or living in friendship, is very common, having the advantages of being inexpensive, easy to break if the partners wish, and possible after a previous official marriage. Because illigitimacy is not recognized in Brazilian law, the offspring of such anions have general legal status. Since no divorce is permitted in the country, a marriage is it permanent, binding contract. A form of legal separation exists, termed dc,. cite, by which a lop\" :t it 6 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200080016 -0 9 couple officially separates and div;des its material goods. It is granted only on grounds of proven adultery, attempted murde- or grave injury of the spouse, or voluntary abandonment for 2 continuous years. Although still relatively infrequent, the number of desquites is increasing. Many lower class couples fail to contract any form of marriage and live amasiado. In many rural areas, both religious and civil authorities are absent, so that any other form of marriage is impossible. Although some amasiado relationships are temporary, many are long lasting and relatively stable unions recognized by the community as marriage. The relationship may last from a few years to a lifetime. Usually, socially accepted patterns of mutual assistance and obligation define the relationship between an established amasiado pair. In some cases, the men take little responsibility for the children, and the education, training, and care of the progeny are the duty of the mother. She may rule the family but usually will consult the father and consider his wishes. Women are traditionally considered secondary to men, and their primary function is defined as serving their husbands and rearing their children. Men exercise a dominant role in the financial and decisionmaking aspects of the family. Children are valued and are taught proper moral behavior by their fathers. Young men are given considerable freedom to explore and develop their character and ability to make decisions, while voting women are often confined to the house, both to assist the mother and to safeguard their reputations. The situation is changing, however, as women increasingly attend schools and universities and enter the working world (Figure 3). FIGURE 3. Higher education is drawing more women (U /OU) Kinship has traditionally dominated Brazilian economic life. Practically all commerciaj' and industrial enterprises were once family owned and administered, and many still are. In business and professional life kinsmen constantly called upon one another for favors and support. Kinship groups are still very important in small towns, and parentela, and patriarchal families still tend to dominate economic life in the industrial centers and in the northern part of the country. Members of the new economic elite, though some of them were immigrants without families, have nevertheless adopted the same patterns of familism and nepotism which characterized the traditional power structure, and which limited efficiency in both business and government. Kinship has been important in politics also. In the early years of the 20th century certain well- knoN%n patriarchal families in each state dominated local political parties, and even national politics were based on coalitions among large regional families. Nepotism �still prevalent �was expected and was rife in government service. This was an important cause of the widespread laxness in political morality, pervading corruption in overnment, inefficient administration in both government and government -owned en- terprises, and a sprawling and often venal bureaucracy. 4. Class structure (U /OU) a. Urban -rural and regional differences In general, Brazilian society remains stratified with well- defined lines of class membership, pronounced status differences, and limited vertical social mobility. APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP0l- 00707R000200080016 -0 in the urban areas, however, there is continuing change, lar;ely undirected, accompanying the development of an urban technological culture. Among significant trends are the mass movement to the cities; emergence of a new class consciousness among both urban and ntr:a lower classes; and growth of the industrial elite Lind of the urban white collar and industrial blue collar workers. Since the 1930'x, industrial development, improved transportation, and better communications, combined with and contributing to he spread of it money economy and the rush of rural people to the cities, have begun to erode the traditional lines of social stratification. With increasing social mobility and geographic movement, several important new urban social groups have emerged within the past three decades �the middle or white collar sector, the tipper class industrial entrepreneurs, and the industrial working class. From the standpoint of their leadership potential and the continuing trend toward an urban industrial society, their influence may be expected to grow. Vast geographic distances and regional isolation sharply delineate differences in social structure in various parts of the country. The most marked contrast is perhaps still the one that separates modern urban from traditional rural society, but a clear distinction is not present because of a broadening range of variation within the urban and rural sectors. For example, in the South the middle class is large and complex and has begun to expand into rural occupations, the per capita income is relatively high, and most people are literate. income and degree of wealth are more significant criteria of individual status than the traditional factor of family and lineage. At the opposite extreme is the Northeast region and the isolated Central -West, where life expectancy, living conditions, and income are such that the great majority of the population must be classified in the lowest social level. Flere social structure remains much as it was in colonial society -a two -class system in which the small class at the top of the social hierarchy has a monopoly on land, wealth, and power, and the mass of the people at the bottom live in complete dependence upon them. islands of modernism exist in the larger cities of the region, such as Recife, which exhibits the complexity and variation in social stratification characteristic of other urban centers. The middle class is concentrated in these few centers and is absent in the countryside, except for a few government officials and managers of large estates. Between these two extremes in terms of social organization is the area that includes most of Sao 6 1 Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais States. Society in this zone has been changing rapidly and is best described as transitional, juxtaposing large modern cities and a few flourishing rural agricultural areas with areas that exhibit a rigidly hierarchical society similar to the colonial prototype. Despite sharp regional ind rural -urban differences, class considerations are universally important; the class structure in some respects is a national one and increasingly tends to displace the distinctions between the country's many regional environments as improvements in education, transportation, and communication draw ideas and people together. Members of the urban upper class, because of the traditional prestige attached to landowning, continue to obtain rural e.,tates whenever they have the N%ealth and opportunity to do so. In this way they frequentl cone in contact with the rural gentry, increasing class solidarity through intermarriage and mutual interests. 'The urban middle class is also expanding into the rural areas, where they find employment as farm managers and government officials. b. Upper class According to acme authorities, the upper class comprises between 3% and 7% of the population and is maintaining this percentage through natural increase. The birth rate in the urban upper class is approximately as high as that of the other classes, and its infant mortality rate is somewhat lower, because of better nutrition and medical care. By the beginning of the 20th century a group of \"traditional families\" had supplanted the nobility of the empire and had become dominant in the country's political, social, and economic life. To a large extent, they carried on the aristocratic traditions of the empire and preserved the paternalistic attitude of the aristocracy toward the lower class. Through intermarriage this group absorbed other families, which had achieved wealth and political position after the advent of the republic in 1889. Members of the upper class could list the names of those who belonged to it, not only in their own region but in other parts of the country. Membership in one of these prestigious families was nearly always it prerequisite to rconomic, professional, social, or political success. Although many members of the upper class resided in the cities. especially politicians and members of the legal and medical professions, the basis of the class was wealth derived from large -scale agriculture and cattle raising. After the emancipation of the slaves and the establishment of the republic in the late 19th century, a new upper class, which was predominantly urban in r APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200080016 -0 its orientation emerged. It was made rip of persons who had gained prominence in the new government, industrial and commercial entrepreneurs, and some members of the rural elite who, having been deprived of slave labor, turned to urban pursuits. Within a short time the new elite had also developed landed interests through intermarriage with the rural gentry. Despite the merging of the two groups and the continued tie between the member% of the traditional elite and their rural landholdings, a large segment of the new upper class had interests that were mainly or largely urban, many members dividing their time between plantations or cattle ranches and their homes in the metropolitan centers. Largely in the last 30 or 40 years, the processes of urbanization have given rise to another segment of the upper class usually called the industrial elite. Often of non Portuguese immigrant background and middle class origins, the members of this group have usually gained economic success through their own entrepreneurship or that of their parents. Because the prerequisite of distinguished family ties continues to be essential for membership in the social elite �as is wealth �the new industrial upper class has assured its acceptance through intermarriage with the more firmly established elite. Thus, a merger, parallel to the one that occurred SO years ago between an old and a new elite, is occurring between the two segments of the urban upper class. The continued importance of family and lineage in determining elite status serves mainly to exclude persons who have acquired very recent wealth through c ;uestionahle dealings and speculation or persons whose behavior, attitudes, and values do not conform to tLose of the established tipper class. Members of the urban elite retain many traditiona' aristocratic values and frequently seek alliances with rural upper class landowners. Although they are usually more cosmopolitan than their rurai counterparts and have traveled widely in Europe and North America, they continue to attach great prestige to iandowtnership. At the same time, because their source of income and consequently their power and status depend upon commerce, industry, and capital, they are actively involved in the management and administration of their enterprises evincing a prep cupation with monevmaking that is generally disparaged by the more tradition oriented landed gentry. To a degree, these vigorous entrepreneurs are overwhelming the trad;:ional elite �ul appear to be transforming them while retaining basic humanistic values. The urban elite group has demonstrated a high degree of national pride, partly because elements of this group have played a prominent role in the nation's history. Furthermore, this group derives its wealth primarily from trade and industry and is intensely interested in the countrv's economic development and political stability. Its members are also concerned with technological development and a successful foreign trade policy and have shown considerable dynamism and an innovative spirit. E c. Middle class The middle class, which is concentrated in the urban centers, has become increasingly important numerically since the 1920'x. In the late 1960's it comprised between 13% and 23% of the population. Since the early 19th century, Brazil has had a small group of people who might be considered middle class. These were the families of men who were clerks in government offices or who were engaged in other white collar occupations. The army, too, has been a means of upward mobility and has been dominated by the middle class. Immigration from Europe to southern Brazil added to this small class. Since World War II, the middle class has increased greatly and is still growing. The expansion of the federal, state, and municipal civil service has provided many white collar positions, and, with the growth of industry and commerce, many such jobs have become available in offices and stores. Furthermore, the demands of an expanding population have resulted in an urgent recd for professionals, such as chemists, nurses, and engineers. The core of the middle class is made up of the white collar workers, such as clerks in the hetterstores, nurses, schoolteachers, secretarial arid middle -level administrative employees, as well as most scientists, academicians, and army officers. A relatively large number of persons have elite ancestrv, but the majority are of lower class origins. There is it tendency among the middle class to identify with the upper class and conform to their values. This frequently leads to personal conflicts, because insufficient finances prohibit matching real behavior with ideals. Although the ideal is for women to remain in the home, daughters are even wives do accept office employment to enable he family to live at the desired higher standard. Persons often disdain the economically productive pursuits they are forced to engage in, and children are encouraged to pursue professions traditional among the upper class, neglecting career.< with less prestige but higher income. 9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200080016 -0 Most middle class Brazilians attempt to provide their children with at least a secondary education, since education is one of the main routes to higher status. If at all possible, the children are educated in private schools; while tuition is not expensive by North American standards (US$10 to $15 per month) it represents a heavy drain on the middle class pocketbook. In general, the members of the middle class attach great importance to material possessions and are conscious of fashions in clothing and furniture. They are anxious to have modern housing and are susceptible to fads and advertising. Most families have at least one maid, several radios, and possibly a television set, attend movies frequently, and read magazines and newspapers. Because their wants exceed their income, they buy on credit and are usually in debt. Because of its recent emergence, the disparate social and economic origins of its members, and the heterogeneity of its composition, the middle class has not yet developed it sense of group solidarity and class consciousness. It continues to accept the values and ideals of the upper class. Furthermore, inflation and individual economic concerns have preoccupied most members of the urban middle sector, diverting their attention from political and social matters. Nevertheless, its members exhibit a growing degree of political unity and a similarity of interests that may enable them to assume it role of national leadership. As the largest segment of the voting population, they have some influence on the course of national policy although elections have it less direct role than before 1964. Through their attainment of high positions in the military, they have achieved another base of power. The members of the middle class are generally well educated and aware that political and economic stability are interdependent. Among the issues on which they focus their concern are educational expansion, industrialization, urban growth, and national economic development. d. Lower class The great majority of the Brazilian people belong to the lower class, some, especially in rural areas, existing in semistarvation. They earn their living as workers in cane fields and on coffee plantations, as cowboys on the ranges in the South and ranches in the Northeast, as rubber collector in the Amazon valley, as sharecroppers on large estates, as squatters living by subsistence agriculture on other people's land, as renters of land, and even as owner of small parcels of land. Many have migrated to large towns and cities, where, for lack of education and training, they work as laborers, mostly on construction projects. For most of those who remain in rural areas, the pattern of life has not changed significantly over several centuries. Economic security is sought through the establishment of a patrao (patron) worker relationship with a member of the rural elite. Essentially, such a relationship is an economic one between employer and worker, landlord and tenant, creditor and debtor. It is highly exploitive, yet it involves paternalistic obligations on the part of the employer, landlord, or creditor, in exchange for which he expects loyalty and political support. The patrao system provides security in time of need, frequently the only form of social security available; the relationship thus established is an intimate one within the confines cf a rather rigid protocol. While the patrao system is still important, it is no longer strong enough to tic rural workers to the land; large -scale migration to the cities has underlined the need for land reform and an improved agrarian order. The urban lower class is probably the fastest growing segnent of society, supplemented by an uninterrupted flow of rural migrants and by its own high birth rate. Members of the urban lower class, like their rural c,anterparts, generally lack the at,ributes of education, occupation, housing, income, dress, and manners that characterize people in the middle and upper classes. Often such individuals are second generation residents of the slum areas, perhaps descendants of people who moved to the city after the abolition of slavery. Many are manual laborers, but others have acquired skills and arc employed as artisans, mechanics, cabdrivers, busdrivers, gas station attendants, clerks, or peddlers in the markets. The lack of skills and education of many of the recent migrants to the city limits their prospects for employment and their ability to adjust to urban life. Unemployment and underemployment in this migrant population are high, and the life style is relatively unchanged from that of the peasantry. They merely exchange rural poverty and unemployment for the s:sme conditions in the urban context. Although they occupy the lowest levels of urban society, the urban migrants are still intrigr,ed by the city life, lights, dancing, films, and soccer games, and by the genera! air of movimento (movement), it term used by Brazilians to describe the rapid and active pace of urban life. These migrants retain traditional values and continue to seek out familiar associations and tip' i APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200080016 -0 E 0 institutions particularly the Roman Catholic Church, close personal associations based on the family model, and the security of it patrao, whether it be an employer, a union leader, or it political organizer. Their aspirations have not vet exceeded their level of income; they are occasionall' able to buy items that are symbolic of status in the country �a radio, clock, wristwatch, or phonograph. They often consider themselves only temporary residents of the city and dream of returning to their own village, carrying with them their newly acquired material possessions and perhaps enough money to establish a small store. Few urban migrants ever return, however; their children grow up, and they may gain a few years of education and become frilly accustomed to urban life. Slightly above the unskilled, unemployed, and illiterate in status are persons who possess some skill or training and therefore have a greater measure of economic security than recent migrants and other unskilled workers. They gradually merge into the industrial workers' segment, both wishing for a greater shy re of material benefits. e. Social mobility A U.S. Government study in 1971 suggested that social mobilty is considerable among certain sectors of the population but extremely limited among others. The study divided the population into five vertical levels on the basis of income. The lowest level contains families with less than $100 per capita income, mainly farm laborers �a group of miserably poor people which numbers over 20 million and is still growing. Brazil's population at the mere subsistence level has been increasing for 400 years; in 1972 it was about as large as the total population of 1920. Most people in this category are trapped there because of poor health and a lack of education. Less than I of them escape into it higher level each year; these are basically the few youths who obtain schooling. The second level, containing families with between US$1(X) and $200 per capita income, included some of the better off in rural areas and many of the new arrivals in the cities. This income group developed slowly during the first half of the 20th century out of the very poor. They were far enough ahead of the bottom group in diet, education, and adaptability to facilitate mobility whenever the opportunity arose, as during the 1950's and again in the late 1960's. Many of the able and ambitious members of this income group rise into the third level, the urban proletariat� families with it per capita annual income of between US$200 and $500. This sector has grown from about 7 million people in 1950 to approximately 40 million in 1970. The average family may have five members earning a total of $2,000 per year. They are participants in modern society, owning electrical appliances such as radios and refrigerators, but rarely an automobile. Since most members of this group are better off than their parents were, they are fairly satisfied with their status. T;iose who are dissatisfied are prevented b,, 'y government restrictions from striking or otherwise showing their frustration. The children in this group get only 1 to 4 years of education, which is inadequate for a middle class job. Less then 1 it of this level rise higher annually. Those who are able to obtain a high school or technical school education usually are able to climb to the fourth level, families with US$500 to $1,000 per capita income, and many of them then soon ascend to a fifth level, those with a per capita annual income of over $1,000. This level, which at its top contains the small wealthy sector, has over 12 million people who, in general, enjoy a standard of living equal to that of middle class West Europeans or North Americans. Brazil's middle class, one of the 10 largest in the world, is over 2'/2 times as large as in 1950. Over half of the adults in the middle class started in a lower income group. This study did not attempt to quantify separately the very small top income group. The study suggests that economic self improvement of individuals in Brazil has dramatically reduced the effect of traditional hereditary barriers to social mobility at least in some areas. Technological development and industrialization have created demands for more skilled workers and new specialties. Although they remain in it broadly conceived lower stratum, such workers hold it social and economic position higher than that of the nonskilled laborer. A similar pattern of subdivisions prevails with variations throughout all echelons of society. Economic and technological development has creaied demands for more consumer goods, resulting in an increase in sales personnel and clerical, secretarial, and managerial positions. Still another factor in sociai mobility has been the population explosion coupled with increased urbanization. For the first time, the individual can cloak himself in anonymity if he so desires and move up the social ladder so long as he manages to conform to the requirements of his new status. For the most part, however, elevation in the social hierarch still takes place within the broad boundaries of each class, and the person who climbs from rags to riches in it single lifetime must overcome great obstacles. n APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200080016 -0 The average lower class individual and even most of those in the middle class cannot hope to achieve this goal. What the socially ambitious person generally strives for is to move up one or two rungs on the social ladder within his own class and, by judicious selection, to marry his children to persons of still higher status. Thus, although mobility is slow, it is possible for the members of a family to raise themselves from lower to middle or from middle to upper class in two generations. in the last fe%v years the government has taken some measures that have, directly or indirectly, increased social mobility. Undoubtedly the most important is the expansion of state supported education. increased opportunities for social mobilit may also be a product of programs such as construction of the Trans- Amazon Ilighway and expansion of industry in the Northeast. Through such projects people are brought into contact with modern society and in some cases are allowed job opportunities formerly unavailable. Because there probably will always he a large, cheap labor force in the settled rural areas, for most of them the only chance for improvement seems to be to leave for the cities or for agricultural colonies such as the government is establishing under the National Integration Program along the Trans- Amazon Ilighway. 5. Social values and attitudes (C) a. Regarding the nation Nationalism is it characteristic ingredient of Brazilian attitudes and is best illustrated by the Portuguese word ufania, to Brazilians, this word connotes pride and optimism juxtaposed with somewhat a defensive attitude. Such sentiments are in part the outgrowth of a conviction of the potential greatness of the country coupled with a recognition of the obstacles to be overcome before the greatness can be realized, as expressed in the saving \"Brazil is the country of the future �and always will be.\" Cornrnon customs, language, and religion had laid the foundation for national unity, in the 17th century. But the nation lacked politica! institutions which could surmount the problems posed by the lack of speedy communications and the predominance of state political machines. Under President Vargas, who stmt� to power in 1930, the government cultivated broader popular participation in government aril called on the nation to redress social and economic injustices. National symbols were created, and nationalistic legislation, such as that restricting immigration and foreign Ida capital and requiring that the Portuguese language he used in all schools, was passed. National integration and cultural assimilation were also encouraged by the works of scholars such as Gilberto Freyre, who maintained that the crossbreeding of Negroes, Indians, and Europeans had created a new distinctively Brazilian race and culture. Under the democratic system after 1945, regional competition again became significant, but the forces of national unity were also strengthened. Urbaniza- tion and industrialization continued to undermine provincial attitudes, and the development of better transportation networks and of modern means of communication helped to overcome the isolation of the rural communities and of one region from another. The governments of the period su _ceeded, for example, in convincing important �ctors of the population that the periodic droughts .id the general impoverishment of the Northeast region were a national problem and not merely it regional one. National elution campaigns, cat-; -d out vigorously even in the more remote regions, began to introduce larger audiences to the meaning of citizenship and to national issues. Since the coup d'etat of 1964. the government bL, been more highly centralized than in the past. Regional competition has lost much of its political significance, since the exercise of initiative on the part of state governments has been greatly curtailed. Federtl intervention in state and local affairs has had the effect in many cases of t:,king the normal functions of government out of the hands of civilian officials and placing them tinder the centralized structure of the military. A factor affecting the cultivation of national pride and unity has been a relative lack of national heroes. Because of the absence of a revolutionary war and of wars genuinely threatening national sovereignty, there are few military heroes, and the PoNtical figures revered by some have been held in disrepute by others. Brazil, however, has a sense of national historical continuity rare in the Western Hemisphere. The country has never felt the need to reject its European heritage. it never suffered it major civil war and never forced to adapt to a loss of national territory. Domestic frustrations have often been diverted by international aspirations. Throughout the 20111 century the country has aspired to a larger role in world affairs. In the early 1960's the independent foreign policies of Presidents Janio Quadros and Joao Coulart aimed at cooperating with the nonaligned nations. Under the control of the armed forces, the government since 1964 ha:; sought to build support for APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200080016 -0 s 0 0 its foreign policies by emphasizipg the relationship of internal and continental geographic features to national securit� and de�lopment. Geopolitics has become an important part of the curriculum of every major university. Nevertheless, to many citizens the state h.s remained a rather distant entity. Outside the more developed southern part of the country, tl?.- direct influence of the central government has only recently been felt. In much of the remote rural interior, the local community or plantation is virtually self contained and isolated from national and state affairs. Although civismo (good citizenship) is often cited as a widely shared value, it has remained, for the most part, an abstract concept. Even those who expect most from the state rarely indicate a corresponding sense of personal obligation to it. Strong loy!dties are generally reserved for relatives, friends, patrons, and local religious leaders. The struggle of many for physical surviva! has left little room for concern about the national welfare. Legalism, li';e civismo, has been more in evidence as an ideal than as it practice. The tipper and middle classes have it strong juridical sense and take pride in the fact that their government has traditionally been a government of laws. The lower classes have had little understanding of their rights under the law and have been puzzled by the complicated procedures involved in the functioning of the bureaucracy. Members of the upper class, on the other hand, have often kern able to use their influence and personal connections to expedite the operations of government bureaus. A wealthy landowner, for example, may use his ties with the tux collector, the labor inspector, the local judge, and the police to obtain special favors. One reason for ite lack of understanding of the rights and duties of citizenship has been a lack of institutions, public or private, that performed the service of civic education. Schools have taught the verbal expressions and symbols of civismo but have generally failed to impart its deeper meaning and practical application. The local political bosses (coroneis) merely told their clientele how to vote and the political parties made only limited contributions toward educating the population in civic affairs. Governments have made some progress in this area through adult education programs. In the early 1960's intensive programs of civic education were carried out by teams composed of university students and worker- priests. These learns, which worked in urban slums and rural villages, combined literacy training with instruction in civil rights and in methods of community action to ensure protection of those rights. The activities of the \"peasant leagues' in the Northeast and other groups participating in the Popular Mobilization Front also stimulated political awareness among the lower classes. The coup (Fetat of 1964 put an end to such activities. The new government, through the media, the schools, and through billboards in public places, launched its own campaign of civic education, emphasizing the responsibility of all for the maintenance of order and the capture of insurrec- tionists. The government campaigned against corruption, one of its principal themes; and some of the more widespread practices, such as tax evasion and dealing in c have been gr. `v curtailed. Public attitudes toward the Medici government remain a matter of speculation, since the communica- tions media are controlled and virtually all public expressions of dissent are discouraged. For the majority of the population, who have not participated in the political system, a trap between ideals and experience has created ambivalence toward the system. Even the literate of the lower and lower middle classes have been taught in the rural areas to vote with their landowners or political bosses rather than to make independent decisions, and for those who have moved to the city, political dependence has often been shifted to the union leader or it foreman. Nonparticipation or guided participation and the observance of the actual, as opposed to the ideal, system has led many to an attitude of cynicism. The people in the past did not expect the government to be impartial, and the use of bribery and influence was considered usual and, in some cases, even justified. But despite the historic prevalence of oligarchic 'manipulation of the political system and the consolidation after 1964 of authoritarian control, the ideals of constitutionalism, dentocncy, apr' civil libertarianism have persisted. The military govern- ment, while suppressing civilian opposition and repressing dissent, has tried to maintain the outward form of constitutional government with separate executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Even though the Constitution itself grants almost unlimited powers to the executive, the idea of exercising power under constitutional legitimacy has remained important. Schoolchildren are taught that the\". live under a democratic system, although of necessity it operates under certain temporary limitations. The government has created a considerable propaganda mechanism, including journalists and psychologists and using the cinema, television, avd radio, as well as posters throughout the country I,roclaiming \"The revolution of 1964 is irreversible. and will perfect Brazilian democracy. 13 h. Attitudes toward exploitation of the land Except for owners of large plantations, the traditional Brazilian attitude toward the land -.vas that it is to be exploited and left behind. With few exceptions, the Brazilian peasant differed profoundly from his European counterpart. He seldom fi rtilized his land, following instead slash- and -burn techniques closer to aboriginal than to European patterns. He has tended to be seminomadic, planting and collecting in one locality until forced to migrate, generally by the exhaustion of his land. This \"extractive\" mentality has contributed to the failure of the Brazilians to settle their land and to the relative poverty of rural areas. Unlike the United States and Canada, Brazil has neglected to establish an effective national land tenure system; inadequate surveys, clouded titles, and the absence of a homestead law have discouraged permanent settlement on the lands. The traditional attitude has been modified as some agricultural areas have become more thickly populated. One of the principal goals of the construction of the Trans Amazon Highway is to develop part of the country's unexploited land in a rational way. A program is under way to open the immense territorial expanse the highway system crosses to organized colonization and agricultural settlement by landless families, principally from the impoverished Northeast. This idea was conceived on the basis of the success of the Belem� Brasilia highway in attracting agricultural colonists. It is estimated that between a million and 2 million people have settled along that highway in the last 10 years, making a prosperous livelihood from farming and cvttle raising. Unlike 116. Belem� Brasilia highway, wnich was settled in a random fashion, colonization along the Trans- Amazon Highway is being supervised by the National Institete of Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA). Although only 2,000 families have been settled along the roadway, INCRA has mentioned settling as many as 100,000 families by 1977. The success of the colonizat. ^,n project and the success of the highway are indelibly joined together. Tl;e Trans Amazon project is not without its dissenters. Manv Brazilians feel that the financial resources diverted to its construction could b. better used for other purposes. Ecologists maintain that the soil cannot support the kind of agriculture planned for the area, and that the cutting down of so many trees will upset the precarious balance of nature peculiar to the area. Some sociologists predict that the opening of a roadway will serve to draw more people to the crowded cities than colonists to the rural areas. Moreover, INCRA's ability to accomplish its goals has 6-en questioned. e. Attitudes toward minority groups r 14 The adjustment of non Portuguese immigrants to the Brazilian social environment has required considerable change on their part. Most were German, Italian, and Polish in origin; a 'esser number came from Japan and the mid -East. Except for a few isolated communities, most European immigrants have been assimilated into the Brazilian culture, have married outside their national group, and speak Portuguese. This was not the case in the beginning, for these colonists came in groups, settled in groups, retained their national language, and generally considered themselves superior to the Brazilians around them. Unlike the seminomadic peasants elsewhere in Brazil, these colonists brought with them the European mixed farming system, establishing small farms with a balanced variety of crops, livestock, and dairy products, and built solid houses of wood or brick, which contrasted with the adobe walls and straw- thatched roofs of other rural houses. They also lacked the usual Brazilian disdain for manual labor. This characteristic was true of the Germans, iii particular. Many Germans resisted assimilation most tena- ciously; the government during World War II closed German clubs and schools, and forced acculturation by requiring young men from southern areas to do their military service in northern areas, where they learned the national language. In political terms, Europeans have been well assimilated. For example, the many Brazilians of Italian origin in Sao Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul are spread out geographically so that it seems impossible to link an \"Italian vote. :1 to any particular political tendency. Japanese immi- grants, on the other hand, remained largely unassimilated until the 1950'x. They married within their own gr.ntp, and most continued to speak Japanese. Many Japanese have settled near Sao Paulo, where they have specialized in truck farming, supplying Sao Paulo with most of its fresh produce. They also now have important places in the industrial and financial communities. Sao Paulo provides numerous examples of self -made men who, although the sons of immigrants, rose to positions of wealth and influence. These men in, tude hotel magnate Jose Tjurs, whose parents were Russian; industrialist Francisco Matarazzo, Jr., son of Italian immigrants; banker Amador Aguiar, scn of an illiterate Portuguese peasant; and financier Nagib Audi, -on of a Lebanese immigrant. The aboriginal Indian peoples probably never numbered more than 1.5 million. They began to blend with the whites in the 16th century. so that the tribal APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200080016 -0 1 1 Indian population is fewer than 130,0M, scattered in the remote areas of the far west and the Amazon Basin. Even in the 1970's tribes have been discovered that have had almost no contact with white men. The original tribes were decimated by massacre, enslavement, and disease. In the 20th century not even the idealistic efforts of Marshal Candido Rondon, who founded the Indian Protection Service and gave it the motto \"Die if necessary, but never kill,\" could protect their dwindling ranks from further encroachment. The Indian Protection Service itself became a vehicle for exploitation of the Indians after Marshal Rondon's retirement in the late 1940's. Charges of atrocities culminated in a scandal of gigantic proportions ir, December 1967 and the replacement of the service with the National Indian Foundation. The Indians who have survived are in poor health and live in poverty. The penetration of roads into previously undeveloped areas o` the Amazon Basin continue to bring the Indians into contact with other Brazilians, and in some cases friction is the inevitable result. Some Indian groups have been moved off their lands to make way for roads and colonization projects, and nore are likely to he affected in the future. According to it go spokesman, the goal of the government's policy is to integrate the Indians into the economy as producers and consumers. The issue of whether to protect the Indian from outside influence or to integrate him as rapidly as possible into the rest of sc -Aety is -;till highly controversial in Brazil. No matter which policy is followed, it appears inevitable that, with ti., opening up of the interior, the majority of Indian trines remaining will either be assimilated into the frontier society or will die out through it combination of low resistance to civilization's diseases and awned clashes (Figure I). The government re )urces allocated to the foundation are neither sufficient to move many Indians to e,.iequate reservations where they can he protected, similar to the renowned Xingu Park, nor to maintain an adequate patrol and medical service to supervise areas the Indians presently inhabit. In early 1973, world famous anthropologist: Claudio and Orlando Villas Boas, the� founders of Xingu Park, declared that they were retiring from their :,0 years of work with the Indians because cash time they contacted a new tribe they contr0juted to the destruction of the Indians' culture. Brazilians feel that their country's racial mixture is a real international asset and it national contribution to world harmony. The Constitution provides for equality before the law, and it law adopted in 1951, known as the Affonso Arinos Law, imposes large fines 7( 7 I I for proven discriminator acts. Color prejudice does exist, however, large'.y as an aspect of class discrimination. Because of the limited opportunities for upward mobility, the rule of thumb \"the darker the skin, the lower the class\" often app:\"es. A disproportionate number of darker people are in the lower wo I categories, with the exception of it few fields such as sports. Because of the tendency to marry within one's own social level, a member of the upper class is likely to he of predominantly European descent. Any Indian blood in the family usually has been acquired several generations earlier, although many upper class individuals, taking pride in even it small degree of Indian ancestry, may overemphasize it. The Brazilian vocabulary is rich in terminology that can he used to denote any color or physical type. In addition, there are words that not only distinguish it person's physical appearance but further indicate his occupation, regional origin, or some othc: attribute. Yet even a complete glossary of color terms used in Brazil would fail to tell the whole story, because classification may also he sociologically conditioned. pular terminology distinguishes a variety of hues 15 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200080016 -0 FIGURE 4. Civilization's march into the interior has driven many Indians to the cities (U/0U) and shades, some of which are visually recognizable, while others possess social rather than physiological reality. Brancos are, generally, persons whose appearance is definitely European. It is common to refer to those with light hair, kin, and eves as brancos finos (refined whites) and th, -se whose physical characteristics are more markedly Moth~; rranean, that is, darker skin and hair, as brunettes (brunets). Preto (black) is both the official and vernacular term applied to Negro physical types. The word Negro is seldom used except in a scientific sense to describe race, any other use being considered derogatory and insulting. Pretos of lighter skin are referred to as fulos (a corruption of fullah to denote fulani Islamized Negroes of the West African Sudan). Cor do carvao (color of coal) and retinto (dyed) are very dark negroid types. Amarelo (yellow), the only fairly clear -cut color designation, describes Asians, represented in Brazil chiefly by Japanese and a few Chinese. Pardo is a catchall term 'that includes all persons not otherwise classified. It makes no racial distinctions as, for example, between Indians or light colored Negroes. The army for identification purposes distinguishes pardo claao (light brown) and Pardo escuro (dark brown), and popular usage denotes it myriad of different shades of Pardo. Most caboclos (a name given to acculturated Indians, which is now used also in reference to copper colored mulattoes and most peasants of the interior) are classified as pardos, as are persons of mixed blood. Brazilians use the general terms mulatto for persons of white and Negro mixture and cafuso for a cress between Indian and Negro. d. Regarding foreigners While Brazilians are often highly critical of the United States, U.S. society represents, at least materially, the type of society to which they aspire. Many educated Brazlians view themselves as occupying an intermediate position between the United States and Europe, tied to the former by the direction of social change in their way of life, and to the latter by their cultural traditions. Brazil maintains close ties with Portugal, although in a slightly patronizing fashion; today the cultures of the two lands are very different. Brazilians have been outgrowing a certain sense of inferiority vis -a -vis Europe and North America; for the first time, large numbers of Brazilians are taking sightseeing trips within Brazil itself. Brazilians find the British efficient and reliable though not cordial; thev admire the ability of the Germans but strongly objected to the 16 \"master race' co-icept. They are on generally friendly terms with the other American republics but resent the Argentine assumption of racial superiority. e. Personal characteristics In general, the southern part of Brazil is similar in history and culture to the northern part of the United States, and northern Brazil, with its background of a slave -based plantation economy, resembles the southern United States. Although there are also many exceptions to these similarities, they do provide the basis for some comparisons. Regionalism has been as important a factor in Brazilian politics, economics, literature, and art as it has beep in the United States. Brazilians f.equently refer to their country as \"many Brazils.\" They characterize the Bahiano from Bahia as eloquent and superficially brilliant. The Paulista from Sao Paulo is considered an energetic, efficient businessman; the Paulista in turn looks upon his industrialized state as a locomotive pulling 21 empty boxcars, representing the rest of Brazil. The carioca, as inhabitants of the city of Rio de Janeiro are called, is stereotyped as sly, urbane, talkative, and fun loving. The cearense from the northeastern state of Ceara is considered a keen commercial man, while the mineiro from Minas Gerais is characterized as politically minded, highly traditional, and the possessor of it dry sense of humor. Individualism is highly regarded and has been called the dominant motive of action in the value system. Each person is expected to he self reliant and independent and to look after his own interests. He has the freedom to follow .his own inclinations and ideas so long as they do not conflict with his fami;v obligations. The family serves as the major organizing force in an otherwise amorphous and individualistic society. The general lack of social welfare agencies and the financial instability caused by inflation contribute to the sense that each person, especially a patrao, must look after himself and his dependents. In many urban areas, however, change is becoming more desired and has even been termed the \"enemy of backwardness\" by soma Another barrier to social change is it lack of involvement in problems beyond those of the immediate family and friends. A resident of Rio de Janeiro may ignore the misery of the favelados (slum dwellers) unless he has personal contact with one of them (Figure 5). These attitudes are changing, however; the Superintendency for Development of the Northeast (SUDENE), the federal governments development project started in 1959, represents it massive, impersonal attempt to improve the economic situation of that part of the country.

The people generally display tolerance and resignation toward the inconveniences of life in overcrowded cities, occasionally releasing tensions by attending the very popular soccer games or by participating in carnivals. Although professional soccer dates only from 1933, Brazilian audiences follow the sport with a devotion that may he unmatched anywhere in the world (Figure 6). During the late 1960's the National Sports Confederation had some 1,500 professional soccer clubs among its 20,000 -club membership. No city or town of any size is without its soccer club. Nearly everyone can afford to sec a major game occasional) at standee prices, which often run as low as US$0.10, and radio coverage of games is followed with excitement in remote rural areas. The Marcana Stadium in Rio de J aneiro built for the 1950 World Cup soccer matches, can accommodate up to 200,000 persons, including standees. An indication of popular enthusia..rrr is shown by the fact that a moat surrounds the stadium's playing field to keep off overenthusiastic spectators. Another is the bedlam occasioned by the custom of bringing along transistor radios to hear as well as watch the contests. On November 19, 1969, when Pele, the star of the Santos professional soccer club, scored the thousandth goal of his distinguished career, a circumstance duly reported to the world by the international wire services. it was a matter for national celebration.

C. Population Deficiencies in statistics greatly complicate the analysis of population trends in Brazil.

T he Brazilian censuses (Figures 7 and 8) are considered more accurate than those in many other countries of Latin America, hilt the census of 1960 apparently dropped sharply in quality and was never fully tabulated, and there have been mane questions about the reliability of statistics Millions of Persons 100 i so 60 I I I 40 20 0 1872 few 1900 1920 1940 SO 60 70 FIGURE 7. Population growth by census year (U /0l FIGURE 8. Population statistics (U /OU) based on it. The census taken in September 1970 is eventually expected to fill many of these gaps, but thus far only very minimal preliminary data are available. The slowness in releasing the figures probably- is teased in part on tin size and complexity of the undertaking, but also the government is highly sensitive to the use of preliminary figures, on such subjects as income distribution, by domestic and foreign critics intent on embarrassing the regime. (U /OU) 1. Size and growth rates (U /OU) With a population estimated at 101,035,000 in mid 1973, Brazil is the world's seventh most populaus nation. It has almost twice as many inhabitants as Mexico, its nearest rival in terms of population in Latin America, and four times as mane as Argentina, the second most popalous South American country. Brazilians comprise more that half the people of South America, and heir numbers are expected to double, reaching ovt 00 million, by the year 2000. On the basis of the reported population in 1960 and 1970, the estimated rate of natural increase during the decade was about 2.9 a decrease from the approximately 3% annual rate registered during the previous decade. Errors in the census m,.v mean the real rate between 1960 and 1970 was closer to 2.8',i. Brazil's high rate of natural increase, like that of many developing nations, is primarily a result of it sharp decline in the death rate accompanied by only a slight decline in the birth rate. Although the infant inortality rate has declined sharply in the past 20 gars, it remains one of the highest in Latin America. with wide regional variations within the conntrv. Ir 1970 the infant mortality rate ran as high as 205 per 1,000 live hirths in Recife in the Northeast; in viral areas of that region the rate probably was considerably higher. The decline in infant mortality and other death rates has more than doubled life expectancy at birth since the latter part of the 19th century. In 1971 life expectancy was estimated at 63.1 years.

Immigration and emigration (U /OU) 100 Immigration, although an important factor in population growth in the past, has not peen it significant source of population gain in recent decades. Between 1884 and 1964 nearly 5 million immigrants entered the country, with six countries Italy, Portugal, Spain, Japan, Germany, and Russia contributing 4.3 million of these. Portugal and Italy contributed approximately equal amounts, totaling over 62% of all immigrants during the 80 -year period. Other countries adding significantly to the total were Austria, Turkey, Poland, Romania, France, the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, and Argentina; lesser numbers have immigrated from most of the remaining countries of Europe, the Middle Fast, and other South American co(intries. Japanese immigration started in 1906, and over 2(H),tN)0 hoc, arrived by 1957, the largest group came in the years 1925 to 1935 (Figure 10). Over 1.1 million immigrants carne to Brazil during the decade just before 19(10, representing the largest number in any 10 -year period. During that decade the ratio between immigration and natural increase as it cause of population growth ahc!.t 1 to 3. During the yt�rs 1900 to 1920, the ratio dropped to 1 to 6, and between 1920 and 1940 it was I to 10. During recent notable rise in life expectancy in the developed South, the gain !ias been much less in other areas, particularly the Northeast. 2. Age -sex structure (U /OU) Continued high fertility and reduction of infant and child mortality have made Brazil a very youthful country; the age -sex structure of the population in 1970 is compared wyith that of the United States in Figure 9. About 42% of the population is 14 years old or younger, and less than I 1 r is 50 or over. The high proportion of younger people means that Brazil has a very large number of dependents for each wage earner and that the nation also faces an enormous task in providing education. The population in both urban and rural areas is almost evenly divided between male and female; the estimated ratio is 100.6 males per 100 females. 2. iitacial composition (U /OU) The hulk of the population is derived from three major ethnic components, which during four centuries have become amalgamated to an extraordinary degree: European (particularly Portuguese and Italian), African Negro, and to it lesser extent American Indian. More recent immigration has brought additional European elements, Japanese, and also Christian Arahs from Lebanon and Syria. The Aral) community totals about 3 million, most of whore are iocated in the States of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Guanabara, Parana, Rio Grande do Sul, and Goias. Figures pertaining to racial percentages have only marginal value, since there has been such a high degree of amalgamation that it is difficult to APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200080016 -0 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Percent FIGURE 9. Population by age and sex, Brazil and the United States, 1970 (U /OU) FIGURE 10. Descendents of Japanese immigrants (U/OU) years it has become still lower, as the number of immigrants declined stea �ily from an annual average of 60,000 in the mid- 1950's to 6,378 in 1971. In the mid- 1960's there were only about 21 aliens and naturalized Brazilians per 1,000 of the total population. Official immigration records, particularly during the early period, do not completely reflect the real situation, as many immigrants returned to their native lands or migrated to another countrv. The overall return rate for the period between 1884 and 1962 appears to have been about 30%, kvith a relatively high rate of return for Italians, Spanish, and other Europeans, but a low one for Japanese, nearly all of whom chose to remain in Brazil. The basic legislation governing immigration, Decree -Law Number 7467 of 1945, and Decree -Law 941 of 1970, set both qualitative and quantitative limitations. In most cases, immigration from a particular country may not exceed 2% of the total number of persons who entered Brazil from that country during the preceding 50 years. Immigration is limited in general to those persons deemed capable of contributing to the country's economic and social development. Naturalization requires 2 years of residence for a citizen of Portugal, 3 years for persons coming from other countries and engaging in agriculture or industry, and 5 years for all others. The 20 total of persons naturalized has averaged about 3,000 annually since the late 1960's. Several se ^ns of the 1945 Act promote the use of selective irr. gyration to settle unoccupied lands, establish ne population centers, or contribute to industrial growth. Individuals entering under these provisions are required to sign contracts agreeing to engage in agricultural or industrial undertakings for a specific time. Settlement of immigrants is a responsibility of the National Institute for Immigration and Settlement, created in 1954. Particular emphasis is placed on attracting agriculturists, but out of 6,887 immigrants in 1970 only 235 were listed as agriculturists. Agreements for administration of immigration and colonization programs have been concluded with the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, and Japan, and Brazil cooperates closely with the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration, created to assist refugees and other persons desiring to emigrate. Although Brazil's need for immigration is greatest in the agriculfiural sector, most newcomers, except the Japanese, have shown a decided preference for urban settlement. The number of emigrants totaled approximately 55,000 during 1960 -70, resulting in a net immigration to Brazil of 120,000 during that period. This net immigration compared with a total of 553,000 during 1950 -60. The emigrants included a significant number of engineers, physicians, and scientists. This \"brain drain' has become a matter of serious concern to the government. Some programs have been undertaken to encourage skilled Brazilians who have gone abroad to return, but the degree of success of these efforts is uncertain. 5. Geographic distribution and density (U /OU) Historically an agrarian country, Brazil is now officially more urban than rural (Figure 11). The 1970 census indicated that Brazil had acquired an urban majority in the mid- 1960's, the urban population having grown from about 451 of total population in 1960 to in 1970. The figure may reach 671 by 1980. The 1970 census classified as \"urban and suburban\" those areas having 2,000 or more residents, thereby including not only the urban centers but also rural pockets and fringes of the municipio (county) in which the center is located. Thus, many of the localities classified as urban have few if any urban characteristics. Brazilians, throughout the course of the country's history, have been a highly mobile people. Although the study of these internal migrations is still in an early stage, it is clear that the most significant migrations are those that have extended agriculture into ne ,y h APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200080016 -0 PJ 0 FIGURE 1 1. Population by major regions and urban/ rural distribution, 1970 (U /OU) areas and those that have drawn people from the countryside to the cities and towns. Migrants participating in both of these movements came primarily from the older rural regions. The net migration from these areas� particularly in the Northeast� during the 1950 -60 period included about 7 million people, of whom 6 million moved into urban areas and 1 million moved to new agricultural frontiers. An estimated one -third of those who left rural homes during this decade found the move unsatisfactory and returned to their original points of departure, and sonic moved from one urban area to another, but there was no discernible movement of people from established urban localities to new rural homes. Although no official data are yet available on the 1960 -70 period, the migration trends evident in the previous decade probably continued. Of the several types of migrations since World War 11, by far the most significant has been the shift from country to town. During the decade between 1960 and 1970, the growth rate of the rural sector was 1.1 annually, whereas for the urban sector it was 4.6 Migration combined with natural increase has resulted in a tremendous expansion in Brazils cities (Figure 12). In 1970 almost 79% of all urbanites lived in cities with more than 10,000 inhabitants, and 94 cities had more than 100,000 people. Although in absolute terms Sao Paulo continued to have the greatest population increase, the most rapid rate of growth during the decade was recorded by Brasilia. It is possible that Goiania, the capital of Goias State, is growing even more rapidly than the Federal Capital. Almost the only area which has taken steps to try to stem the wave of migration to urban areas has been Sao Paulo State. In July 1971, the mayor of Sao Paulo noted that some 200,000 migrants converged annualh on the Greater Sao Paulo area (the city plus the 36 surrounding municipios) and that the city could not adequately provide housing or public services at the rate required. He recommended that the city replace its slogan of \"Sao Paulo Cant Stop\" with \"Sao Paulo Must Stop.\" Greater Sao Paulo, with over 8 million people in 1970, is one of the largest metropolitan areas in the Western Hemisphere. The annual growth rate of 5.4% during the period 1960 -70 would mean it doubling of population every 14 years. Some 87% of the migrants to Greater Sao Paulo are illiterate, more than 50% have serious health problems, and almost none have job skills. Part of the state's effort to resolve the problem has been to train some workers and aid others in returning to their original residence. Also, since 1972 areas in the state outside of the Greater Sao Paulo zone have been assisted in providing (xouonlic opportunities for migrants from other states and for their own residents, thus deterring them from moving to the metropolis.
