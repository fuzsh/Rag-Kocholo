        "text": "Getty Images\n\nCarlos Dunga is officially returning to coach the Brazilian national team after a previous four-year stint leading up to the 2010 World Cup. He replaces Luiz Felipe Scolari, who watched over a meltdown during the final rounds of this year's marquee international tournament.\n\nSun Sport Now reports the deal is now done after being rumored in recent days:\n\nDunga took the position in 2006 despite having no prior managerial experience. The longtime midfielder had enjoyed success at both the club and the international levels, giving Brazil enough confidence in him to lead the national team.\n\nThe results were good for most of his tenure. He led the side to championships in the 2007 Copa America and the 2009 Confederations Cup along with ensuring the squad qualified for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.\n\nAlas, the only result good enough for a storied national team like Brazil's is a title on the sport's biggest stage. Dunga couldn't deliver that as the Netherlands eliminated the Selecao in the quarterfinals, marking the end of his first stint as manager.\n\nNow he returns, following a disappointing finish by the Scolari-led group on home soil. They made it to the semifinals before being shockingly routed 7-1 by eventual champions Germany and then losing the third-place match to the Netherlands, 3-0.\n\nThe 10-1 cumulative defeats prompted the exit of Scolari, who previously led Brazil to the World Cup title in 2002, and now the return of Dunga.\n\nSoccer journalist Joe Crann provides his take on the hire:\n\nOptaJean points out some numbers featuring the two managers:\n\nFernando Duarte of ESPN passed along comments from Dunga, who made it clear the team has work to do in order to reach the mountaintop again:\n\nIt's a risky hire by Brazil. Dunga only had one managerial job between his two stays with the Selecao, and it featured limited success at Internacional. It's far from a guarantee that he'll be able to get the national team back on track.\n\nRichard Heathcote/Getty Images\n\nThat said, he was with the side during some of its peak years and understands what it takes to win at the highest levels. Creating the same sense of determination and belief within the current group will be one of his biggest tasks."
