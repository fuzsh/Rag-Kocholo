        "text": "Au revoir, Kylian Mbappé: How should we judge his PSG legacy?\n\n7. Andrés Iniesta\n\nKey accomplishments: World Cup winner, two-time European Championship winner, four-time Champions League winner, nine-time LaLiga winner, Ballon d'Or runner-up\n\nOn July 11, 2010, Iniesta changed Spanish football forever. In the 116th minute of the World Cup final in Johannesburg, South Africa -- with the game, tied at 0-0, having gone to extra time -- Iniesta collected a pass from Cesc Fabregas inside the penalty box and coolly fired the bouncing ball low past Netherlands goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg. Cue euphoria. Spain won the game 1-0, lifting the World Cup for the first and only time, and Iniesta instantly became the most popular man in the country.\n\nAn elegant, skillful playmaker, he also was a key member of one of the best club sides of the modern era -- Pep Guardiola's Barcelona. -- Kirkland\n\nAndrés Iniesta talks Barcelona, Xavi and 1,000 career games\n\n8. Xavi Hernández\n\nKey accomplishments: World Cup winner, two-time European Championship winner, two-time Champions League winner, eight-time LaLiga winner\n\nXavi had so many career highs that it's impossible to pick just one. You might choose Barcelona's famous 6-2 win at rivals Real Madrid, with Xavi playing a part in four of the goals. Or his performance in the 2009 Champions League final, supplying the pass for Lionel Messi's headed opening goal.\n\nYou could pick Barcelona's dominant 3-1 win over Manchester United in 2011. For a game that summed up an era, you'd highlight Spain's 4-0 demolition of Italy at Euro 2012, the apotheosis of their tiki-taka short-passing style that Xavi personified.\n\nBut let's choose an entire season: Xavi's imperial 2008-09, when the midfielder -- arguably the game's best-ever passer -- registered a staggering 20 assists in 35 LaLiga matches. -- Kirkland\n\nXavi's last stand\n\n9. Ronaldo Nazário\n\nKey accomplishments: Two-time FIFA World Cup winner, two-time Ballon d'Or winner, two-time Copa América winner, three-time FIFA World Player of the Year, Golden Ball winner 1998 World Cup, Golden Boot winner 2002 World Cup\n\nThe original Ronaldo was probably the fastest, most powerful striker running with the ball in the history of the game, capable of variations at pace and able to slow down, keep his head still and shoot at goal with cool precision. All of these virtues were best seen in the 20th century -- but the 21st century came up with the best storyline. Twice his knee collapsed beneath him and he was left howling in gruesome pain; many thought the second time was the end of his career.\n\nIn the buildup to the 2002 World Cup, Inter Milan, his club in Italy, could not get him fit. Brazil took charge of his recovery, and Ronaldo took the tournament by storm, carrying a side that nearly failed to qualify all the way to a memorable triumph. It is one of the great comeback stories in the history of sport. -- Tim Vickery\n\nSoccer's all-time Top 20: No. 6 Ronaldo\n\n10. Ronaldinho\n\nKey accomplishments: FIFA World Cup winner, Ballon d'Or winner, Copa América winner, two-time FIFA World Player of the Year, two-time LaLiga winner\n\nIf longevity were not a factor in defining the greatest of all time, then Ronaldinho would certainly be a candidate for his feats during his first three years with Barcelona. From 2003 to 2006, there was no better show in soccer. There have been few, if any, more talented players in the history of the global game, and all too briefly Ronaldinho captivated with his childlike glee at his own achievements, reminding so many of why they fell in love with the sport in the first place.\n\nA disappointing 2006 World Cup was a turning point, and he appeared to grow weary of the sacrifices needed to stay at the top level. But those three years were unforgettable. -- Vickery\n\nRonaldinho's 'what ifs' are irrelevant, just celebrate one of the greatest ever\n\n11. Zlatan Ibrahimović\n\nKey accomplishments: 511 career goals, scored at least one Champions League goal with six teams, 12 league titles with five European clubs, named to UEFA's team of the year four times, Sweden's leading career scorer, represented Sweden at six major tournaments\n\n\"I can't help but laugh at how perfect I am.\" There has never existed an athlete who was as good as Zlatan Ibrahimović said he was, but the 6-foot-5 striker did as well as anyone could -- and for as long as anyone could -- at approaching that level. He was the purest scorer this side of Cristiano Ronaldo. Ibrahimović put the ball in the net at least once in four different decades, and he kept improving into his 30s. Oh, and he also scored at least 30 goals in all competitions six times between 2011 and 2019, peaking with an incredible 50-goal campaign with Paris Saint-Germain in 2015-16.\n\nIbrahimović was the personification of artistry and brute force at the same time. -- Bill Connelly\n\nZlatan's best quotes as the 41-year-old retires from soccer\n\n12. Kevin De Bruyne\n\nKey accomplishments: Three-time league player of the season (twice in Premier League, once in Bundesliga), Champions League winner, six-time Premier League champion, seven-time FA Cup or EFL Cup champion\n\nDe Bruyne has been the most consistently brilliant attacker on the most consistently brilliant team in Premier League history. After a frustrating early experience at Chelsea, De Bruyne erupted for 16 goals and 23 assists in all competitions in one season at Wolfsburg, moved to Manchester City and, after a transition year, became the main cog of the Pep Guardiola era.\n\nIn nine seasons with City, he has combined 102 goals with 161 assists in all competitions; he has been the best table setter in England for most of a decade; and, when necessary, he has been more than happy to put the ball in the net himself, often from range. Just a brilliant all-around attacker. -- Connelly\n\nGuardiola: 'Legend' De Bruyne can lead Man City title charge\n\n13. Toni Kroos\n\nKey accomplishments: World Cup winner, six-time Champions League winner, four-time LaLiga winner, three-time Bundesliga winner\n\nToni Kroos' superpower? Passing the ball better than anybody, more accurately and more often. Kroos successfully played 20,780 passes in his 10 years in LaLiga -- more than any other player -- with a league-high completion rate (among those who played 5,000-plus minutes) of 93.6%. It might not be as exciting as scoring goals or dribbling, but if one man set the tempo of Real Madrid's all-time great midfield in the past decade, it was Kroos, one pass at a time.\n\nHis finest work? This through ball for Vinícius Júnior in last season's Champions League, bisecting Bayern Munich's defence. It was a pass so good, it made teammate Jude Bellingham stop and applaud as the play was unfolding. -- Kirkland\n\nModric and Kroos are the ageless wonders keeping Real Madrid from ushering in a new era\n\n14. Sergio Ramos\n\nKey accomplishments: World Cup winner, two-time European Championship winner, four-time Champions League winner, five-time LaLiga winner, 11-time FIFPRO World 11 nominee\n\nAsk Real Madrid fans to pick their favourite Sergio Ramos moment and they won't hesitate: the 2014 Champions League final, the 93rd minute and the most important goal in the club's history. Real Madrid were seconds away from losing to archrivals Atlético Madrid on the biggest stage in club football, until Ramos' header found the net, levelling at 1-1 and forcing extra time. Real Madrid won the match, picked up their first European Cup in 12 years and kicked off an era of unparalleled success.\n\n\"I remember it with a smile,\" Ramos told UEFA when asked about the goal in 2016. \"At the end of the day, that will be the lasting memory. I'll be able to show it to my son, my grandchildren.\" -- Kirkland\n\nSergio Ramos' 20-year career: Trophies, goals and drama\n\n15. Carles Puyol\n\nKey accomplishments: FIFA World Cup winner, six-time LaLiga champion, three-time Champions League winner, two-time Club World Cup winner, UEFA European Championship winner\n\nPuyol was not known for goals. He scored three in 100 appearances for Spain. As a centre-back, his forte was keeping them out. One of his three scores, though, was one of the most significant goals in the history of Spanish soccer. Climbing highest at a corner, he thumped a header past Manuel Neuer in the 73rd minute to give Spain a 1-0 win over Germany in the 2010 World Cup semifinal. It was a goal that displayed the strength, desire and commitment that characterised Puyol's career. Spain went on to win the World Cup for the first and only time in their history.\n\n\"Puyol puts his face where most would be afraid to put their foot,\" said legendary Italian defender Franco Baresi. That was Puyol. -- Marsden\n\nCarles Puyol: The inspiring leader\n\n16. Karim Benzema\n\nKey accomplishments: Four-time LaLiga winner, five-time Champions League winner, four-time Ligue 1 winner, three-time Copa del Rey winner, five-time Club World Cups winner, Ballon d'Or winner, UEFA Nations League winner\n\nFrom being a prodigy at Lyon when he started his career at 17 in 2005 to joining Real Madrid at 21 in 2002 to then becoming the best player in the world and winning the Ballon d'Or almost 20 years later in 2022, Benzema went through a lot in his career. He was criticised for his lack of efficiency at times in front of goal, but he became a wonderful team player, helping Cristiano Ronaldo to shine and Real Madrid to win trophies before becoming the superstar after CR7's departure in the summer of 2019. In five seasons from 2019 to 2023, he scored 30, 27, 30, 44 and 31 goals, adding 51 assists in total over this period too. He was unstoppable and produced his best football while over the age of 30.\n\n\"Like great French wine, Benzema becomes even better with age. He is one of the footballers with the highest IQ and intelligence in the game and an incredible desire to always help his team and be the best,\" Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. -- Laurens\n\nKarim Benzema fulfills a lifelong dream in winning 2022 Ballon d'Or\n\n17. Sergio Busquets\n\nKey accomplishments: FIFA World Cup winner, nine-time LaLiga champion, three-time Champions League winner, three-time Club World Cup winner, UEFA European Championship winner\n\nNo one summed up the role and importance of Busquets better than former Spain coach Vicente del Bosque. \"You watch the game, you don't see Busquets,\" he said. \"But if you watch Busquets, you see the whole game.\" While teammates Andrés Iniesta, Xavi Hernández and Lionel Messi took the plaudits, they would all say that their success would not have been possible without Busquets cleaning up and starting attacks at the base of the midfield.\n\nThere is no one moment or season but rather sustained excellence over more than a decade. (Although there is his trademark drag back move with the ball at his feet.) In 15 seasons with Barcelona's first team, he never played fewer than 40 matches, winning everything there is to win for club and country. -- Marsden\n\nBarcelona's Sergio Busquets holds the key to future midfield\n\n18. Robert Lewandowski\n\nKey accomplishments: UEFA Champions League winner, 10-time Bundesliga champion, LaLiga winner, two-time World Soccer Player of the Year, two-time Ballon d'Or Striker of the Year, UEFA Player of the Year, seven-time Bundesliga leading goal scorer, 83 international goals (most for a Polish player, fourth most for any European man)\n\nLewandowski is one of the most consistent and technically brilliant forwards of the 21st century, but he will forever be known for the time he made Pep Guardiola smile like a drunken romantic. Early in the 2015-16 season, Guardiola's Bayern Munich trailed Wolfsburg 1-0 at halftime; Lewandowski entered the match for the second half and proceeded to score in the 51st (with his left foot), 52nd (with his right foot from distance), 55th (off a rebound), 57th (on a counterattack) and 60th minutes.\n\nOn the last one, Lewandowski was almost imitating the technique on the Bundesliga logo. That makes sense, as he and his Bayern team defined the Bundesliga for his entire eight-year stay in Munich. -- Connelly\n\nBayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski among 'footballing gods' - media\n\n19. Kaká\n\nKey accomplishments: FIFA World Cup winner, Ballon d'Or winner, UEFA Champions League winner, FIFA World Player of the Year (2007), LaLiga winner, Serie A winner\n\nThe last Brazilian to be chosen as World Player of the Year is the son of a prominent engineer, and one could say Kaká constructed his career with methodical precision. Kaká was at his best in his first spell with AC Milan from 2003 to 2009, when he excelled as an attacking midfielder with few frills, flicks and tricks but with a burst of acceleration, sustained power, vision and an eye for goal.\n\nInjuries took away some of his speed and brought about a relatively early decline, but in his prime, he was an almost unstoppable force whose lack of ornamentation made the game look very simple. -- Vickery\n\nKaka's spectacular run overshadowed by his successors\n\n20. Neymar\n\nKey accomplishments: UEFA Champions League winner, two-time LaLiga winner, five-time Ligue 1 winner, FIFA Puskas Award (2011), Brazil's all-time top goal scorer\n\nThe boy prince has never quite grown into the king of the game; the World Player of the Year award, always seen as an objective, has proved elusive, and he has yet to win a major title with his country. Neymar also is widely associated with antics and excessive diving. But it would be unwise to write off his career as a complete disappointment. He has scored more goals for Brazil than anyone else -- a mighty achievement -- and he has produced moments of exceptional magic, especially in his time with Barcelona. And there are still further chapters to be written. -- Vickery\n\nNeymar's mixed legacy after 15 years: where do we stand?\n\nJust missed the list\n\n21. Andrea Pirlo\n\nKey accomplishments: FIFA World Cup winner, two-time UEFA Champions League winner, six-time Serie A winner, three-time Serie A Footballer of the Year\n\nSo great was the Italian maestro's impact on the game that the \"Pirlo role\" was recognized globally as the position its namesake perfected, picking inch-perfect passes for his teammates with a nonchalance and technique that etched his name among the greatest midfielders to have played the game. -- SherShah Atif\n\nAnother architect in Manaus\n\n22. Wayne Rooney\n\nKey accomplishments: Five-time English Premier League winner, UEFA Champions League winner, two-time PFA Young Player of the Year, 2004 Golden Boy Award, Premier League Hall of Fame inductee, Manchester United all-time top scorer\n\nWidely regarded as one of the most complete strikers to grace modern soccer, Rooney looked the full package upon scoring in his Premier League debut at just 16 years old. He went on to display grit, power and finishing ability over a stellar career for club and country. -- Atif\n\nRooney is Man United's greatest goal scorer, but what is his legacy?\n\n23. Patrick Vieira\n\nKey accomplishments: FIFA World Cup winner, UEFA European Championship winner, three-time English Premier League winner, four-time English FA Cup winner, five-time Serie A winner, Premier League Hall of Fame inductee\n\nAs captain of Arsenal, Vieira's composure, leadership and fearless spirit were central to the club's unprecedented season in 2003-04, when \"The Invincibles\" went undefeated to lift the English Premier League title. -- Atif\n\nWhat did the 'Invincibles' have that Arsene Wenger's newer Arsenal lacked?\n\n24. Luis Suárez\n\nKey accomplishments: UEFA Champions League winner, four-time LaLiga winner, four-time Copa del Rey winner, Copa América winner, all-time goal scorer for Uruguay\n\nA player with a knack for scoring goals, Suarez found the net wherever he went, whether that was Ajax, Liverpool, Barcelona or Atlético Madrid, making him one of the most fearsome strikers in the world during his heyday. -- Atif\n\nPortrait of a serial winner\n\n25. Gianluigi Buffon\n\nKey accomplishments: FIFA World Cup winner, FIFA World Cup Golden Glove Award (2006), 10-time Serie A winner, six-time Coppa Italia winner, 13-time Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year award, most appearances in Serie A, most appearances for Italy, two-time UEFA Goalkeeper of the Year winner\n\nThe talismanic goalkeeper enjoyed a 28-year career, and he is arguably the greatest player at his position following a trophy-laden career. That he was named the UEFA Goalkeeper of the Year at 39 years old is a testament to his ageless class. -- Atif"
