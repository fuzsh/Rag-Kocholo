WILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) — They are here to serve and protect and to every once in a while push a car.

Viewer Elaine O’Donnell sent WWAY a photo of a Wilmington Police officer.

She said she was driving on Military Cutoff at Eastwood Road and saw the officer pushing a young man’s car down the road.

She wanted to acknowledge the officer and let others know how awesome she thought the scene was.

WPD says this is Officer Michael Wenzel, a new officer in training, and they thank and appreciate citizens who call their attention to these situations.
