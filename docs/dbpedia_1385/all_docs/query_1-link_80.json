        "text": "It was four days of wine tastings, talks, and Pinot Noir parties, with live music and gourmet meals at the Pinot Noir 2004, held at Wellington in the last week of January.\n\nFour days and nights of a hectic schedule which showcased rather effectively, that the New Zealand wine industry is a passionate body, proud of what it is doing and means serious business.\n\nAbout 400 delegates from around the world were invited to Wellington in the last week of January, a perfect time to be in NZ, for this four-day celebration of what is now New Zealandï¿½s leading grape variety, the Pinot Noir.\n\nIt was in 2001 that the first Pinot Noir Festival was held. The objective was to showcase New Zealand Pinot Noir (NZPN) on the world stage and establish new export markets. It worked perfectly for them because since then exports of NZPN have trebled and plantings of this fickle, not-so-easy-to-grow grape have doubled. Millions of dollars are being invested in the production of Pinot Noir, which though was first grown in NZ in 1890s only made its presence felt in the 1970s when the first quality Pinot Noirs started appearing. It took the Martinborough wineries to lead the way in the mid-80s when the NZPN wines really took off. Now Pinot Noir is grown in all South Island grape-growing regions ï¿½ Canterbury/ Waipara, Marlborough, Nelson and Central Otago - and in the North Islands in selected areas like Martinborough, Hawkes Bay, Gisborne and Auckland.\n\nIf the passion and commitment of winemakers is sustained, momentum maintained and quality controlled, the NZPN has a rosy future with a wonderful bouquet and a lovely red hue. After all NZPN is viewed as one of two or three serious Pinot Noir producers outside of Burgundy, France. Like Richard Riddiford, managing director of Martinboroughï¿½s Palliser Estate Winery and also chairman of the Pinot Noir 2004 Board, said in his closing speech. ï¿½My belief is still very much that provided we do what we have done in the past 10 years in terms of quality and distribution, the New Zealand Pinot Noir industry has a wonderful future.ï¿½\n\nPlans to hold the next Pinot festival are already afoot. In 2007. And why not! Pinot Noir 2004 was a huge success. On this strong platform, there were presentations from international winemakers and wine writers, great cuisine and plenty of Pinot Noir tastings from more than 110 wineries.\n\nThere was a range of subjects discussed. ï¿½Trends in Marketï¿½, ï¿½The Secrets of Successï¿½, ï¿½A Question of Styleï¿½. International speakers included famous wine writers like James Halliday and Huon Hooke (Australia), Tim Aitkin and Robert Joseph (Britain) and Michel Bettane (France). There was British Masters of Wine Jasper Morris and Phil Reedman. Also, US wine lecturer and Crown Wine and Spirits director Chip Cassidy and Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa Wine Director Inez Ribustello, also from the US.\n\nAmong the international guest winemakers, there was Larry Brooks (USA), Karl Heinz Johner (Germany), Michael Dhillon (Australia), George Fromm (Switzerland), Claudio Radenti (Australia), Patrice Rion (France), Michael Wenzel (Austria), Benjamin Leroux (France) and Ken Wright (USA). From New Zealand there was Warren Moran, Professor Emeritus at University of Auckland, and Bob Campell who not only possesses a fantastic sense of humour but is also a super moderator.\n\nRight from the word Go, the festival which began at the hall of the Te Papa Museum, where Dame Silvia Cartwright, the Governor-General of New Zealand inaugurated the event, to the lunch thrown by Kerry, the most charming and informal Mayor of Wellington, to the final Gala Dinner on the last night, the events went with clockwork precision and most smoothly. If there were any glitches behind the scenes, well they were behind the scenes and we delegates were oblivious to them.\n\nIt takes a huge effort to put up a show as mammoth and I have no doubt there were many sleepless nights spent by many who were responsible for the operations. There was a great deal of creativity that went in too. It was amusing to be led by tall, silent, reef thin figures all in flowing white robes, walking on stilts, from the Te Papa on the opening evening, to the Marquee, a white tent by the sea, where a Street Party was being held. Amusing, but the novel idea was appreciated by all the 400 delegates that followed these waifs. The Chefs Choice Dinner was unique too. People in groups of 20 were taken for dinner to 18 top restaurants of Wellington where chefs and sommeliers enlightened us on the Pinots that were accompanying our gourmet meals.\n\nTo my good fortune, the best restaurant of the city ï¿½Citron, came my way, with who is hailed as one of the most talented Chefs of the country, Rex Morgan. I also had Danny Schuster of Daniel Schuster Wines, sitting across me on the table. Indeed a memorable evening. And I absolutely must quote Dannyï¿½s take on two grape varieties. ï¿½Chardonnayï¿½, he drawled, ï¿½is to do with the mind ï¿½ makes you think. Pinot Noir is for the heart, it gives you a hug.ï¿½\n\nAnother interesting encounter I had was with Ruth Pretty, the catering queen of Wellington. This 50-year-old is the head of the Kapiti Coast cooking empire Ruth Pretty Catering, which also includes a cooking school. About 11,000 aspiring learners have gone through her school in the last decade, no doubt having learnt the ropes of good cooking. Ruth was the culinary director of the event which she handled with spectacular efficiency. The ï¿½Gala Dinnerï¿½, which was a sit down dinner had 400 diners being served simultaneously. Not easy, but the strategy, which I made a point to find out, was instrumental in executing such a job.\n\nThe hall was divided into four quarters, each quarter came under the purview of one chef, with each serving a different main course, the pre-preparation of which was done elsewhere in the main kitchen (donï¿½t forget, we were sitting under a fabric marquee and they were operating under a make-shift kitchen). Luckily my quarter of the Marquee was being served lamb, and what was served to me was a perfect lamb rack. Sitting next to me was the man responsible for supplying the produce and the Ambassador Chefs of the evening, the Managing Director of New Zealand Beef and Lamband. I bowed to him in appreciation.\n\nI canï¿½t decide which aspect of New Zealand I like most. Food, wine, its orchards, or its landscapes with all the natural glory? Well, I think there is no question, I like its people the ï¿½mostestï¿½. They are warm, fun-loving, friendly, easy-going. And they are all this most genuinely so, without any falseness about. Tena koutou katoa."
