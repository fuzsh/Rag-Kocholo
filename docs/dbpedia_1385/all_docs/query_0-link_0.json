        "text": "Chemistry\n\nThe two synthetic approaches we employed in the preparation of the indazole-based constrained mimetics of (E)-4EGI-1 library are outlined in . The first, a convergent synthesis in which two fragments, 1H-indazole-3-carboxylic acid and 2-halo-4-phenylthiazole, were combined via a regioselective N-arylation to yield the final 4EGI-1 mimetic ( , route i); and the second, a linear synthesis in which a 4EGI-1-like hydrazone was assembled in a stepwise manner followed by an intramolecular cyclization, involving the N-arylation of the NH of the hydrazone, generating the anticipated indazole-containing 4EGI-1 mimetic ( , route ii).\n\nIn the convergent synthesis pathway ( , i), the preparation of the 2-halo-4-phenyl thiazolyl fragment was carried out by a well-documented pathway. First, the bromoacetophenones 2a-h were transformed to the corresponding thiocyanateacetophenones by treatment of potassium thiocyanate[31] and subsequently underwent an intramolecular cyclization upon treatment with either gaseous HCl or HBr, to generate the corresponding 2-halo-4-phenylthiazole,[32] 4a-h, in moderate yields ( ). Nitration of 1H-indazole-3-carboxylic acid in fuming nitric acid yielded the other fragment, 5-nitro-1H-indazole-3-carboxylic acid.[33] Subsequent N-arylation of the indazole, or 5-nitroindazole, in the presence of powdered sodium hydroxide in DMSO, by 2-halo-4-phenylthiazole 4 at 110 °C, afforded the anticipated indazole-derived 4EGI-1 mimetic (1′a-c and 1a-g) in low to moderate yields ( ). Replacement of bromoacetophenones 2a-g with 2-bromo-1-phenylpropan-1-one 2h led to the introduction of a methyl group on C-5 of the thiazolyl ring ( ).\n\nThe second strategy for the synthesis was developed with the goal of obtaining higher yields of the focused 3-substituted indazole library of 1 ( , ii). The synthetic pathway was designed to generate a derivative of 2-(2-bromo-4-phenyl)-2-[(4-arylthiazol-2-yl)hydrazono]acetic acid 7 that will form a fused pyrazole ring (i.e. indazole) through an intramolecular cyclization ( ). The transformation of arylhydrazones, usually formed by the condensation of a hydrazine derivative and 2-benzaldehydes or ketones, into indazoles is well established. This intramolecular aromatic nucleophilic substitution, with emphasis on the appropriate reaction conditions (dictated by the leaving group and the hydrazine moiety), is extensively documented in the literature.[22, 25, 34]\n\nIn the first step of this pathway, we utilized a Hantzsch-type reaction[35] between thiosemicarbazide[36] and α-halo-acetophenones (2a-d, 2g and 2i-t) or 2-bromo-1-phenylpropan-1-one (2h and 2u). In most cases, this reaction led to the formation of two cyclic products, the desired 2-hydrazinyl-4-phenylthiazole (5a-d, 5g and 5i-t) (or 2-hydrazinyl-4-phenyl-5-methyl-thiazole (5h and 5u)) and the non-relevant 6-phenyl-6H-1,3,4-thiadiazin-2-amines 5*.[36] These side products 5*a-u were formed in variable quantities and in several cases in equal amount as the desired 5-membered ring intermediates 5a-u. For characterization purposes we have isolated few of the 2-aminothiadiazines 5* (e.g. 5*a, k, m, see experimental section) and confirmed their structural integrity. Practically, we could use the crude mixtures containing both 5 and 5* and subject them to the subsequent condensation with oxoacetic acid derivatives 6, obtaining the same yield of hydrazones 7 as in preparations where we used isolated hydrazines 5. This synthetic shortcut is possible because the 2-aminothiadiazines 5* are weaker nucleophiles than the 2-hydrazinyl-4-phenylthiazoles 5 and cannot compete in the condensation reaction. Moreover, the disparity in the polarity between 5* and 7 is much greater than between 5* and 5 making the isolation of 7 by chromatography a straightforward task.\n\nOf note is the lack of understanding of the anticipated product distribution in the Hantzsch reactions of α-halocarbonyl-containing compounds with thiosemicarbazide. Many studies report the formation of mixtures of 2-hydrazinyl-4-phenylthiazole- and 2-aminothiadiazine-derivatives similar to what we have observed.[37] On the other hand, there are reports on reaction conditions that lead to the exclusive formation of 2-aminothiadiazine derivatives.[36, 38] In the absence of systematic studies that will provide mechanistic insight on the different reaction pathways we remain unable to control the reaction course to generate the 5-membered ring as the exclusive or predominant product.\n\nA three step transformation of isatin into the critical 2-(2-bromo-5-nitro-phenyl)-2-oxoacetic acid 6 ( ) was accomplished by following two previously reported procedures that include nitration of isatin[39] and subsequent basic hydrolysis into the related 2-amino-5-nitro-2-oxoacetic acid.[40] For the last step, we adapted the Sandmeyer reaction to convert the aromatic amine into 6. Condensation of the 2-hydrazinyl-4-phenylthiazoles 5 with the 2-(2-bromophenyl)-2-oxoacetic acid 6 generated the targeted linear precursor 2-(2-bromo-4-phenyl)-2-[(4-arylthiazol-2-yl)hydrazono]-acetic acid 7. In general, we obtained a mixture of (E)- and (Z)-hydrazones in which (E) is the predominant one (>94%). The major isomer was isolated and purified for characterization, but this was not essential: Monitoring the intramolecular cyclization reaction by HPLC-MS indicated that both isomers in the mixture were fully consumed and transformed to the anticipated indazole 1. We assume that dynamic (Z)-to-(E) isomerization under the conditions of the cyclization reaction explains the disappearance of the (Z)-isomer. Our arylhydrazones 7 required a combination of base (Na2CO3/N,N’-dimethylethylenediamine) and CuI used as a catalyst, which proved to be successful in many N-arylation reactions.[41] This combination afforded synthesis of constrained indazole-based (E)-4EGI-1 mimetic library 1 ( ), in moderate to excellent yields.\n\nComparison of the two synthetic pathways shows that, in spite of the larger number of synthetic steps, the linear synthesis is advantageous over the convergent one. In almost all cases we obtained better yields of the same 3-substituted indazoles (e.g. 1g - 47% vs. 12%; 1a – 30% vs. 21%; and 1b – 34% vs. 14%). The N-arylation step that combines the two fragments, 5-nitroindazole and 4a-h (route i in ), is the main culprit for the lower overall yield of the convergent synthetic pathway. Taken together, our synthetic work generated a focused library of pure (>95% by RP-HPLC) constrained indazole-based (E)-4EGI-1 mimetic 1a-u, established their structural integrity by 1H-, 13C-NMR, and HR-MS, and laid the synthetic groundwork for further structural optimization.\n\nIntroduction of a nitro group on C-5 of the indazole ring compromised the solubility of these compounds: while 1′a-c had good solubility in methanol and DMSO at rt, their nitrated homologs 1a-c became poorly soluble. The nitro group is an integral part of the 4EGI-1 pharmacophore and contributes to the activity of its indazole-derived mimetic (vide infra). In order to increase the solubility of the 5-nitroindazole derivatives, we introduced polar groups on the phenylthiazolyl moiety. As expected, substituting the phenyl ring with polar groups such as hydroxy, carboxy, or amine groups resulted in improved solubility of up to 32-fold. For example, an improvement in DMSO solubility at room temperature was observed as we went from 1a (3.125 mm), the non-decorated constrained indazole-based 4EGI-1 mimetic, to 1c (50 mm), and to 1t (100 mm). Notably, introduction of a methyl on C-5 of the thiazole ring was also accompanied by improved solubility as demonstrated by comparing the non-methylated analog 1a (3.125 mm) with the methylated 1h (37.5 mm). The better solubility of 1h as compared to 1a, suggests that steric hindrance introduced by C-5 methylation may prevent facile aggregation and nucleation, which could accelerate precipitation.[42]\n\nBiology\n\nThe newly synthesized constrained indazole-based 4EGI-1 mimetic library 1 was evaluated in a cell-free fluorescent polarization (FP) eIF4E/eIF4G interaction assay. This assay reports on the ability of a small molecule to disrupt the interaction of fluorescent-labeled eIF4G-derived peptide, which contains the eIF4E-binding consensus sequence, with eIF4E,[20a] a proxy for disruption of the eIF4F complex. We chose a set of compounds (1a, 1d, and 1l) to further evaluate their activity in cell-based secondary mechanistic assays: expression of oncogenic proteins encoded by weak mRNAs and disruption of endogenous eIF4E/eIF4G interaction in intact cells. Finally, we determined the cell proliferation inhibitory activity of these selected compounds to serve as a reporter of a global activity that may be comprised of their on-target as well as off-target activities.\n\nCompetitive inhibition of the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction by the constrained 4EGI-1 analogs\n\nWe have previously reported on using the same FP assay for the discovery and development of small molecules that disrupt eIF4E/eIF4G interactions.[20a] Briefly, we synthesized a fluorescein-tagged eIF4G-derived peptide that acts as a surrogate to the endogenous eIF4G. The synthetic fluorescent peptide contains the consensus eIF4E-binding motif (Y(X)4LΦ). We also generated a recombinant glutathione S-transferase-tagged fusion protein GST-DN26-eIF4E (in which eIF4E was truncated by the first N-terminal 26 amino acids). Herein, the (Z)-4EGI-1 was used in the FP assay as a positive control and the vehicle (DMSO) as a negative control. We report the potency of the new constrained indazole-based 4EGI-1 mimetic 1 as the ratio between the IC50 of the (Z)-4EGI-1 and the IC50 of compound 1 ( ).\n\nTable 1\n\nEntry Compound R1 R2 R3 IC50 (Z)-4EGI-1 /IC50 1a1(E)-4EGI-1NO23,4-dichloroH0.84±0.07 (41.5)b2(Z)-4EGI-1NO23,4-dichloroH1.00±0.00 (32.0)b3 1′a HHHNAc4 1′b H3,4-dichloroHNAc5 1′c H4-OCH3H0.40±0.056 1a NO2HH0.82±0.017 1b NO23,4-dichloroH1.40±0.118 1c NO24-OCH3H1.70±0.189 1d NO23-OCH3H4.04±0.5210 1e NO24-ClH0.91±0.0811 1f NO22,4-difluoroH0.98±0.0312 1g NO24-FH0.61±0.0613 1h NO2HMe2.10±0.1414 1i NO22-OCH3H1.92±0.1215 1j NO22,5-dimethoxyH1.05±0.0116 1k NO22,4-dichloroH2.61±0.2417 1l NO24-pyrrolidineH2.70±0.1218 1m NO24-morpholineH2.24±0.0519 1n NO24-N(Me)2H1.81±0.0320 1o NO24-CO2HH2.83±0.0721 1p NO22-CO2HHNAc22 1q NO22-OHH1.02±0.0323 1r NO23-OHH0.75±0.0124 1s NO24-OHH4.12±0.4025 1t NO23,4-dihydroxyH4.09±0.1226 1u NO23,4-dihydroxyMe2.26±0.35\n\nLocking (E)-4EGI-1 in the corresponding indazole-based mimetic 1b resulted in a significant increase in relative binding affinity (cf. IC50 (Z)-4EGI-1/IC50 (E)-4EGI-1 = 0.84 to IC50 (Z)-4EGI-1/ IC50 1b = 1.40) (entries 1 and 7 in ). Evidently, locking the hit compound 4EGI-1 in the (E)-mimicking configuration, as in the indazole system, is either neutral or enhances the affinity for eIF4E, compared to either the (E)- or the (Z)-isomers of 4EGI-1. This result was encouraging and suggested that the indazole scaffold is a constrained chemotype that mimics 4EGI-1 in inhibiting eIF4E/eIF4G interaction. Compounds 1a-u exhibit a range of competitive binding affinities that from no-activity to 4-fold higher affinity than (Z)-4EGI-1 ( ). Comparing the relative competitive-binding affinity of 1′a-c with 1a-c highlights the notable contribution of 5-NO2 group to the binding affinity of these nitrated derivatives to eIF4E. Previous SAR studies conducted in our laboratory revealed that the ortho-nitro group on of the phenylpyruvic moiety of 4EGI-1 itself was an indispensable feature of the minimal pharmacophore.\n\nSubstitution on the para position of the 4-phenylthiazolyl moiety plays an important role in the interaction of the indazole-derived ligands with eIF4E. While 4-chloro-, 4-fluoro-, and 2,4-difluoro-phenyl substituents, as in the respective 1e, 1g, and 1f, are less potent than, or equipotent to the hit 4EGI-1, the 2,4- and 3,4-dichlorophenyl substituents, as in derivatives 1k and 1b, respectively, are more potent than (Z)-4EGI-1. Diversifying the nature of substituents on the para position of the 4-phenylthiazolyl moiety, to include polar and potentially charged ones, contributed not only to improved solubility but also generated some of the most potent competitive binders to eIF4E. The change in apparent binding affinity of the 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxy- (1q, 1r, and 1s) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl (1t) substituted analogs exemplifies the complex structure-activity relationship in this focused library. While 1r, the 3-hydroxy substituted analog, is less potent than 4EGI-1 and the 2-hydroxy and 4-hydroxy substituted analogs (1q and 1s, respectively) the 3,4-dihydroxy analog 1t and the 4-hydroxy analog 1s are the most potent analogs in this series (IC50 (Z)-4EGI-1/IC50 1 = 4.09 and 4.12, respectively). O-Methylation of the hydroxyl affects apparent binding affinity in a position-dependent manner: while O-methylation of the 2-OH and 3-OH enhances relative binding affinity (cf. 1.02 for 1q vs. 1.92 for 1i and 0.75 for 1r vs. 4.04 for 1d), O-methylation of 4-OH results in significant loss of apparent binding affinity (4.12 for 1s vs. 1.70 for 1c). Interestingly, the apparent binding affinity of the 2,4-dimethoxy analog is significantly lower than that of the 2-methoxy and 4-methoxy substituted analogs (cf. 1.05 for 1j vs. 1.92 and 1.70 for 1i and 1c, respectively). Introduction of potentially positive charged disubstituted amines in the para position of the 4-phenylthiazolyl group enhances apparent binding affinity gradually from 4-dimethylamino to 4-morpholino and 4-pyrrolidino (1.81 for 1n, 2.24 for 1m, and 2.70 for 1l). The positional dependency of binding affinity is also underscored in the marked differences between the inactive 2-and the potent 4-CO2H substituted derivatives, 1p and 1o, respectively. In summary, it is evident that apparent binding affinity of the constrained 4EGI-1 mimetic to eIF4E is greatly affected by the nature and position of substituents on the 4-phenylthiazolyl moiety. We are greatly encouraged by the tolerance of polar and potentially charge-bearing substituents that could be important modifiers of physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties.\n\nInhibition of eIF4E/eIF4G interaction in cells\n\nEncouraged by the results of the cell-free FP assay where the constrained indazole-based (E)-4EGI-1 mimetic displayed high activity, we selected representative analogs from this series for target validation in cell-based assays. Inhibition of eIF4E/eIF4G PPI in CRL-2813 cells by 1d was demonstrated in an eIF4E pull-down assay and compared with (E)-4EGI-1 ( ). Western blot analysis of cap-affinity pulled-down material from lysates of melanoma cells treated with either 1d, (E)-4EGI-1, or vehicle (DMSO) revealed that 1d or (E)-4EGI-1 treatment depletes eIF4G from eIF4E complex without any effect on the amount of eIF4E. As previously reported for 4EGI-1,[20a] here too, we observed enhancement of 4E-BP1 binding in (E)-4EGI-1 or 1d treated cells relative to DMSO-treated cells ( ).\n\nInhibition of oncogenic but not housekeeping protein expression\n\nWe anticipate that inhibition of translation initiation by disrupting eIF4F assembly should preferentially inhibit expression of growth promoting, anti-apoptotic, and oncogenic proteins with minimal effect on the expression of housekeeping proteins. To validate this concept, we treated CRL-2813 cells with two constrained indazole-based 4EGI-1 mimetic: 1a, and 1d that represent two levels of apparent binding affinity to eIF4E, 4EGI-1 and DMSO as positive and negative controls, respectively ( ). Indeed, similar to 4EGI-1, selected indazole-based compounds inhibited significantly the expression of survivin, an oncogenic protein that inhibits apoptosis and expression of cyclin D1, a promoter of G1/S cell cycle progression ( ). Importantly, none of the constrained indazole-based 4EGI-1 mimetic analogs had any impact on the expression of β-actin or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), two bona fide housekeeping proteins. Interestingly, while active in the FP assay, 1l does not appear to be active in the cell-based assays (see also ). This may either be due to poor cell penetration, in vivo instability, or binding with higher affinity to other cellular proteins.\n\nInhibition of cancer cells proliferation\n\nAdherent human melanoma cells (CRL-2813), in addition to representing a prevalent human cancer, were found to be the most responsive to inhibition of proliferation by 4EGI-1.[20a] This sensitivity to anti-proliferative agents is most likely attributed to the presence of a BRAF mutation.[43] We have previously shown that Ras-Raf-MAPK driven cell proliferation is dependent on cyclin D1 expression.[44] The significant inhibition of cyclin D1 expression by our compounds may therefore explain, at least in part, the sensitivity of the melanoma cells to these agents. We therefore chose the CRL-2813 cells for evaluating the anti-proliferative activity of the three selected compounds, 1a, 1d, and 1l, from the configurationally constrained (E)-4EGI-1 mimetic library ( ).\n\nTable 2\n\nCompoundR1R2R3cLogPSRB Assay\n\nIC50 (μm) in\n\nCRL-28131(E)-4EGI-1NO23,4-dichloroH4.761.23±0.152(Z)-4EGI-1NO23,4-dichloroH4.7612.17±0.953 1a NO2HH3.995.65±1.774 1d NO23-OCH3H4.004.40±0.57\n\nEffect on regulators of the translation initiation machinery\n\nWe have previously shown that 4EGI-1 inhibits expression of mTOR and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1.[44] Similar inhibition of mTOR expression was observed with compound 1d as can be seen in . Indazole derivative 1d also inhibited p70S6K, a substrate for mTOR. This finding prompted us to investigate the effects of selected constrained indazole-based 4EGI-1 mimetic on the expression and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, downstream effector of mTOR. Western blot analysis of 4EGI-1-, 1a-, 1l-, or 1d-treated CRL-2813 cell lysates shows that similar to 4EGI-1, 1a and 1d reduced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (P-4E-BP1) ( ). Quantitative analysis of the ratio of phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (P-4E-BP1) to total 4E-BP1 (T-4E-BP1) indicates significant effect for 4EGI-1 and 1d, one of the most potent constrained indazole-based 4EGI-1 mimetic ( ), but a lesser effect for 1a. Consistent with its modest effect on the expression of cyclin D1 or survivin (see ) compound 1l had a marginal effect on phoshoylation of 4E-BP1 ( ). As anticipated, treatment with these agents did not affect expression of the housekeeping proteins β-actin and GAPDH. These data indicate that, interfering with eIF4E/eIF4G PPI ( ) inhibits translation initiation not only by blocking eIF4F formation but also by modifying expression of upstream mediators of phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70S6K ( and ) perhaps in a feed-forward loop that further contributes to inhibition of translation initiation.\n\nEffect of the constrained 4EGI-1 mimetic on protein expression is translational\n\nTo determine the mechanism of suppression of oncogenic protein expression by constrained indazole-based 4EGI-1 mimetic ( and ) we carried out real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of the corresponding mRNAs using the 18S ribosomal RNA as an internal reference ( ). Similar to 4EGI-1, the indazoles-derived 4EGI-1 mimetic 1a and 1d did not reduce the levels of cyclin D1, survivin, and p70S6K mRNAs. We therefore conclude that inhibition of oncogenic protein expression by constrained 4EGI-1 derivatives is translational."
