The project aims to create a learning landscape surrounding SBG’s Welcome Center to showcase the beauty and practicality of native flora in safeguarding against wildfires, promoting water conservation, and sustaining local wildlife.\n\nThe initiative represents a significant stride towards sustainable landscape design and environmental stewardship in Sonoma County.\n\n“We are thrilled to embark on this innovative project alongside Sonoma Ecology Center and Habitat Corridor Project, generously supported, in part, by the Maxwell/Hanrahan Foundation,” says Jeannie Perales, Executive Director, SBG. “This important collaboration leverages the expertise and resources of three esteemed regional organizations dedicated to conservation, education, and ecological resilience and builds significantly on SBG’s recently opened California Oaks Trail and the Garden’s enhanced mission to inspire an appreciation of the beauty and value of California native plants alongside its Asian plant collection.”\n\n“The Maxwell/Hanrahan Foundation is supporting Sonoma Botanical Garden’s new focus that will connect more people with nature and educate them about the beauty, resilience, and importance of our native plant species,” Says Delle Maxwell, Foundation President.\n\nThe envisioned garden, which has recently broken ground and will be unveiled to the public in stages over the next several years, will offer visitors an immersive experience to explore and understand the vital role native plants can play in the future of California gardening, demonstrating practical techniques for homeowners, landscape professionals, and community planners to create fire-resistant and water-efficient landscapes that support biodiversity. The garden will also serve as an educational hub with public programs for all ages and special tours designed to deepen the public’s appreciation of California flora.\n\n“Botanical gardens are places of beauty, respite, and appreciation for the natural world,” says Bob Schneider, Design & Implementation Project Manager, Sonoma Ecology Center. “They can also serve as sites for biodiversity and conservation. The Sonoma Ecology Center is excited to work alongside Habitat Corridor Project in growing the Sonoma Botanical Garden’s California native plant collection. California is a biodiversity hotspot, and Sonoma Valley, in particular, is home to a lot of plant diversity. We are excited to showcase more of our region’s native plants, as well as demonstrate fire-wise landscape design principles.”\n\n“This demonstration garden is a unique opportunity to show plant enthusiasts and the public how to use local plants to create a sense of place in the California landscape,” adds April Owens, Executive Director, Habitat Corridor Project. “We are honored to team with Sonoma Ecology Center to diversify the native plant collection at SBG with both plants that are easy to find in the nursery trade and ones that are rare and protected in the Sonoma Valley. The space will provide a substantial amount of habitat garden to support biodiversity where it has been lost in the Sonoma Valley and throughout California. It provides an opportunity to demonstrate for landowners and others the value of adding larger California native shrubs to support butterflies, bees, and birds; the benefit of swales and rain gardens to collect and filter water; and plant design for defensible space.”\n\nAbout Sonoma Botanical Garden\n\nFounded in 1987, Sonoma Botanical Garden (SBG) is a woodland experience where East meets West by celebrating the beauty and importance of Asian and California native plants.

In the coming two to three weeks, approximately March 11-31, more than a dozen of these spectacular trees and shrubs will erupt in a stunning riot of pink and white. With often large, saucer-shaped flowers emerging on bare branches, the winter magnolia bloom is one of the Garden’s most breathtaking highlights of the year.\n\n“There are towering trees and diminutive shrubs with foliage that ranges from glossy to felty, and elegant flowers that nod, hiding their bright red stamens, to luscious 2 foot-wide, giant flowers pointed to the sky,” says Michael Wenzel, Living Collections Curator.\n\nThe most plentiful in March is the Star Magnolia (Magnolia stellata) with 15 specimens planted throughout the Garden. This smaller statured species blooms just before the leaves emerge. Its thin white to pink petals evoke a star shape, leading to its name. These plants started as wild seed collected in central Japan and have been part of several studies examining the genetics of magnolias.\n\nAnother March bloomer is the Kobus Magnolia (Magnolia kobus) with skyward facing white flowers often blooming just as the glossy new leaves are emerging from their winter buds. Native to Japan and South Korea, the specimens at the Garden are representatives of wild genetics from multiple locations across Japan.\n\nThe often fragrant, evergreen Smooth Leaf Magnolia (Magnolia laevifolia) from SW China can be quite floriferous with many two-inch flowers developing along the sides of the spreading branches. Even before the flowers open, the felty brown buds arranged along the stem are particularly eye catching.\n\nWhile peak bloom is especially photo-worthy, Wenzel assures visitors that there are still wonderful opportunities to see blooming magnolias at the Garden well into spring, including the most asked about species at the Garden, the Japanese Big Leaf Magnolia (Magnolia obovata). After the enormous leaves have developed, often longer than 2 feet, the equally massive, white petaled flowers open in April.\n\nVisitors are encouraged to follow the Garden’s social media channels for notable bloom alerts.\n\nOn Sunday, March 17 from 2-3:30pm, the Garden offers a special magnolia tour with an expert guide. Tickets are $27 and include Garden admission.
