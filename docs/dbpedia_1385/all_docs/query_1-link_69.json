        "text": "Poshard and Furst-Bowe Preside over SIUE Science Building Ribbon Cutting\n\nSouthern Illinois University Edwardsville will christen its $52 million Science Building West Monday, Nov. 4, at 3:30 p.m. The event will be open to the public until 6 p.m.\n\nSIU President Glenn Poshard, SIUE Chancellor Julie Furst-Bowe, Interim Provost Ann Boyle and College of Arts and Sciences Dean Aldemaro Romero will be in attendance.\n\nThe facility incorporates laboratories for faculty and student research initiatives in a state-of-the-art learning environment. It opened for use during the 2013 fall semester.\n\nThree departments, including chemistry, biological sciences and environmental sciences, have moved into Science Lab Building West. Physics, mathematics, statistics and the STEM Center will stay in Science Lab Building East.\n\nThe new building features the newest renewable power source on campus – a 30 kilowatt solar array. The Illinois Clean Energy Community Foundation (ICECF) provided a $103,000 grant to provide financial assistance to reach the goal of providing a portion of the new building’s electricity via the sun’s rays.\n\nThe ICECF collaborated with the University, Illinois Capital Development Board, Hastings & Chivetta architects, BRiC Partnership engineers and contractor JF Electric, Inc., to make the $230,000 solar array functional and effective.\n\nWith the array’s electrical output displayed on video monitors in the building, there will be a continuing demonstration of renewable solar power’s possibilities and practical application.\n\nOther Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) features include use of non-heat absorbing roofing materials; low water use plumbing fixtures; high efficiency insulating materials; collection and use of recyclable materials; sun shades on the south and west facing windows; high efficiency window glazing; lighting and air conditioning occupancy sensors, and active teaching displays showing building energy use.\n\nThe next phase of the project is a $30 million renovation to the existing Science Lab Building East that will begin in early 2014.\n\nIERC Research Shows Unequal Dual Credit Access for High School Students\n\nThe Illinois Education Research Council (IERC) at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville today released a research brief examining characteristics of high schools and dual credit participation rates.\n\nThe project, titled “Who Has Access to Dual Credit in Illinois? Examining High School Characteristics and Dual Credit Participation Rates,” was conducted jointly by Dr. Eric Lichtenberger from the IERC and Dr. Jason Taylor, a researcher from the Office of Community College Research and Leadership at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\n“Research, including evidence from Illinois, has shown tangible benefits related to dual credit participation, such as increasing students’ chances of enrolling in college and decreased time to degree completion,” Lichtenberger said. “However, access to dual credit appears to be unequal depending on the high school students attend.”\n\nThe study cites previous research that has shown an association between student characteristics and dual credit participation. “The literature suggests that dual credit is more likely to be available to white, middle- and upper-income, and higher achieving students, as opposed to students who are historically underrepresented in higher education, such as students of color” Taylor said.\n\nAs Taylor notes, the researchers aimed to measure the potential differences in high schools’ dual credit participation rates and determine how those differences were associated with high school characteristics.\n\nIn order to do this, Taylor said the researchers conducting the study used a longitudinal database that included the entire Illinois public high school graduating class in 2003. Dual credit participation was tracked throughout high school enrollment, although most of it occurred during the junior and senior years.\n\nThe study found that high school dual credit participation rates ranged from 0 percent to 88 percent and that students’ access to dual credit is partially dependent on a high school’s geographic location and the composition of the student body, said Lichtenberger.\n\n“High schools in towns or rural areas, as well as high schools in the central and southern parts of Illinois, had higher dual credit participation rates relative to other areas, namely Chicago,” Lichtenberger said.\n\nThe study concluded that high schools with the largest share of students participating in dual credit tended to excel on other measures of academic performance, in addition to measures of student attendance and graduation. The researchers also found that schools with higher rates of dual credit participation had larger proportions of white students and smaller proportions of low-income students.\n\n“It is important to recognize these results are descriptive, and we are pursuing additional inferential analyses with these data. We also know that dual credit participation in Illinois has expanded dramatically since 2003, so we are planning an analysis with more recent data,” Taylor said. “Nevertheless, these data suggest there are large inequities in students’ access to college courses.”\n\nLichtenberger and Taylor will present these results at the Lt. Governor’s “Scaling Up: Effective Practices in Higher Education Conference” in Normal, on Thursday, Oct.31.\n\nThe IERC, established in 2000, provides Illinois with education research to support education policy making and program development for preschool through graduate school.\n\nIn accordance with its mission, the IERC undertakes independent research and policy analysis, which informs and strengthens Illinois’ commitment to providing a seamless system of educational opportunities for its citizens.\n\nFor more information about the IERC, and its research visit www.siue.edu/ierc, follow the organization on Facebook and Twitter @IERC_SIUE, email ierc@siue.edu, or call 618-650-2840, or toll-free, 866-799-4372.\n\nSIUE Emeritus Professor Redmond Hosts Poetry Jam on Trayvon Martin\n\nTrayvon Martin was both the subject and an ancestor invoked at the 23rd Annual “Break Word with the World,” recently hosted by Dr. Eugene B. Redmond, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville emeritus professor.\n\nAt the request of Ishmael Reed’s PEN/Oakland group, Redmond created the lyrical format, “Break Word with the World,” as a “town hall-style ‘conch/us/nest’ forum–that features an evening of satirical, serio-comic, ironic and direct assaults on bigotry, abuse, oppression, racism and scape-goating.”\n\nIt was a night of poets and poetry, history and current events, drums and drummers, all converging into cultural expression and dissonance. A Eugene B. Redmond (EBR) Writers Club’s annual event, “Word” was held at the East St. Louis Higher Education Campus in East St. Louis. Like most Club events, it was co-sponsored by SIUE’s Department of English Language and Literature.\n\n“We chose to spotlight Trayvon Martin this year to keep his memory alive,” said Redmond, former SIUE English Language and Literature professor. “And what better way to keep his memory alive than to have writers pay homage to him.\n\n“This venue also gives writers a chance to vent about social justice in poetic form,” Redmond said. “This is our way of giving Trayvon poetic justice, and giving Zimmerman his ‘justice desserts.”\n\nTrayvon Martin was an unarmed 17-year-old African American high school student who was fatally shot Feb. 26, 2012, in Sanford, Florida, by George Zimmerman. At the time, Zimmerman was a 28-year-old neighborhood watch coordinator. Zimmerman’s defense was based on Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” statute. Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges on July 13, 2013.\n\nThe Trayvon commemoration included drumming provided by Sunshine Lee’s Community Performance Ensemble and the reading of kwansaba poems and prose by members of the Club’s\n\nSoular Systems Ensemble: Roscoe “Ros” Crenshaw, Susan “Spit-Fire” Lively, Darlene Roy (EBRWC president) and Jaye P. Willis. Among the special guests and “open mic” participants were Michael Castro, Manuel and Treasure Shields Redmond.\n\n“Many young black men who wear certain clothes always gets judged,” said Manuel, an SIUE senior and English major whose stage name is “Ackurate.” “The Stand Your Ground law did not give Zimmerman the right to cause violence against someone else.” During the poetry session, Ackurate performed his Trayvon poem, “Warm Embrace.”\n\nThe EBR Writers Club, chartered in 1986 by Sherman L. Fowler, Roy and Redmond, meets twice monthly. The Club created the literary device now widely known as the kwansaba. Both the name and the principles of the poetic device come from Kwanzaa, the seven-day African-American cultural holiday created by Dr. Maulana Karenga. A kwansaba is a seven-line poem with seven words on each line and no word containing more than seven letters.\n\nThe Club’s trustees are Maya Angelou, Amiri Baraka, Avery Brooks, Haki R. Madhubuti, Walter Mosley, Quincy Troupe, Jerry Ward Jr. and Lena J. Weathers. For more information about the Club and Redmond, visit eugenebredmond.com/home/, email eredmon@siue.edu or call (618) 650-3991.\n\nThe following samples are portions of kwansabas about Trayvon Martin read at the poetry jam:\n\n• From Crenshaw’s Trayvesty (A BeTrayal Kwansaba): “When Sanford’s savage son saw strange hooded fruit, his blood-racing pace shaped fairy tales of hostile night time side walking. . .”\n\n• From Lively’s Shades of History: “. . . Like Emmett Till he was just being a boy –naïve face, white hoodie, dying to live in a safe naybor-hood . . . ”\n\n• From Roy’s Racial Safari: “. . .‘Stand Your Ground’ Laws herald widely opened season on our pride of men.”\n\nPhoto Information:\n\nDr. Eugene B. Redmond, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville emeritus professor, welcomes an audience of approximately 50 people to the 23rd Annual “Break Word with the World,” paying homage to Trayvon Martin at the East St. Louis Higher Education Campus in East St. Louis.\n\nPerforming kwansaba poems about Trayvon Martin are Darlene Roy, EBRWC president; and Roscoe Crenshaw, EBRWC member.\n\nParenteBeard Partner Visits with SIUE Business Students\n\nSouthern Illinois University Edwardsville business students learned about forensic accounting Oct. 9-10 from alumnus Bob Gray, ‘76, partner at ParenteBeard LLC.\n\nGray oversees the national practice of Forensic, Litigation & Valuation Services for the firm from both his Dallas and New York offices. He returned to his alma mater as the executive in residence for the School of Business.\n\n“When I was asked to be the executive in residence, I jumped at the chance, because SIUE was my launching point,” said Gray. “I’ve been very blessed with my career in public accounting, so it is always nice to give back to the industry and the community.”\n\nThe purpose of the executive in residence program is to provide students with the opportunity to learn from alumni who have exceeded in their field. Gray, a native of Decatur, has had an extensive career, having worked in St. Louis, Davenport, Omaha, Houston, New York and Louisville offices of Deloitte & Touche prior to joining ParenteBeard.\n\n“Forensic accounting is a practice area that is growing in importance,” said Dr. Mike Costigan, chair of the SIUE Department of Accounting. “Bob has significant experience, both performing the analyses and testifying in court, about economic damages and other litigation matters.\n\n“Bob has a unique perspective because of his recent term as chair of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ (AICPA) Committee on Forensic and Litigation Services.”\n\nAssistant Professor of Accounting Dr. Jamie Hoelscher believes the executive in residence program is beneficial to the School of Business, noting, “Students are intrigued to hear from individuals who once sat in their seats and the significant contributions those alumni have been able to make in their respective fields.\n\n“The program helps students by bridging the gap between classroom learning and real-world issues, in addition to providing networking opportunities many of my students have already taken advantage of.”\n\nDuring his visit, Gray taught two classes ordinarily taught by Hoelscher. Gray discussed the accounting field and the various career paths available, such as forensic accounting. Hoelscher said she hoped the students were able to take away the diverse options accountants have.\n\n“In addition, I hope they gained an understanding of the resources available to them to obtain these career aspirations,” she said.\n\nGray said he wanted to provide students with real-world examples and field advice.\n\n“The advice I would give them is not to look at themselves as just another CPA or just another accountant. They are business people,” said Gray. “Students need to be equipped with the hard skills of accounting as well as other skills of communication, ethics, and marketing. If they view themselves as a business person, they will go a lot longer and farther in this field.”\n\nSenior accounting and political science major Jonathan Roberts of St. Louis found the presentations to be beneficial, adding, “I have been considering the possibility of getting a legal degree after my master’s in accountancy. Gray explained how forensic accounting is related to the legal field and the opportunities that are available. After this presentation, I have been inspired to do some additional research on forensic accounting.”\n\nAs part of the executive in residence program, Gray spoke to students in the Continuing Professional Education (CPE) program. All certified public accountants (CPA) are required to have CPE hours each year to remain licensed. In attendance were accounting faculty, alumni and area CPA’s.\n\nHoelscher attended the CPE presentation and also found Gray’s discussions to be beneficial. “I was interested in learning the varied cases Mr. Gray has been involved with and how those cases related directly to concepts and the terminology I’ve been discussing with my students,” said Hoelscher.\n\n“We hope that our accounting majors saw that it’s possible for an SIUE accounting alum to rise to the highest ranks of the profession,” stated Costigan.\n\nPhoto: SIUE alumnus Bob Gray, ‘76, partner at ParenteBeard LLC spoke to business students about forensic accounting as part of Executive in Residence program.\n\nChinese Visiting Scholars Talk About Their SIUE Experience\n\nSIUE Chancellor Julie Furst-Bowe, front row, far right, met with the University’s Chinese visiting scholars and SIUE School of Education faculty during a recent reception. The scholars will be on campus through December. They are working with faculty members in the School of Education.\n\nA good teacher is wise, knowledgeable, charming and of good character. That was the consensus among the group of eight visiting Chinese scholars on the campus of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville this semester.\n\nThey agreed they have been exposed to outstanding faculty members on the SIUE campus who possess all these qualities.\n\nGathered around a table in the Vadalabene Center, each of the scholars had the chance to recount their international journey.\n\nAt times Dr. Huaibo Xin, an SIUE assistant professor of kinesiology and health education in the School of Education, translated from Chinese to English and English to Chinese during the informal chit-chat. The scholars, all from Northwest Normal University in China, represent a mix of disciplines. The scholars and their disciplines include:\n\n• Weijun Wang, associate dean of the School of Educational Technology\n\n• Huajun Xiong, higher education\n\n• Zuhua Dai and Honghong Chen, both in computer science and engineering\n\n• Kun Li, music\n\n• Zhihua Wang, analytical chemistry\n\n• Aiping Guan, business\n\n• Lan Wang, social work\n\nMoving around the table, most of the scholars had something to say about their SIUE or American experience.\n\nRegarding his experience with the School, Wang said, “I think it is important to work on assessment, but that alone is not enough. Online course assessment tools need to be integrated in China. The focus needs to be on quantitative and qualitative analysis, and we’re examining ways to begin with qualitative analysis and turn that into quantitative.”\n\nXiong noted being impressed by the students “good study habits,” saying, “Students here are motivated to work and think about questions deeply.”\n\nDai had what she called a “life” observation. “The cross walks here are something we don’t have. It is critical for people to be reminded to take care of the people who are walking. I was astonished when I saw people stopping at a cross walk for me.”\n\nChen noted being “fascinated by the students sitting together outside areas to study together after classes. There are so many places to converse and put their thoughts together. It is very impressive to see this before and after class.”\n\nLi noted, “The teachers’ knowledge is very rich.” She spent a recent Friday listening to students and faculty members playing the piano in Dunham Hall.\n\nA different concept from education in China: “The students here have a lot of homework before class,” said Wang. “The class time is used to discuss different problems and they have lots of practice at the end.”\n\nLan Wang added, “I think what first impressed me is this beautiful campus, and the students have such good manners.” She added, “The baseball game was very impressive. There were thousands of people there watching, making their dreams come true.”\n\nThe scholars are participating in the School of Education’s International Training Program in Pedagogy. Mary Weishaar, associate dean of the School of Education, has been working closely with the leadership team for the program, including Dr. Yuliang Liu, professor from Educational Leadership, Dr. Huaibo Xin, assistant professor from Kinesiology and Health Education, and Gretchen Fricke, director, School of Education Student Services, to ensure the campus guests have a visit filled with a mix of education, culture, historical perspective and good old-fashioned fun.\n\nThe scholars have gone to a Cardinals baseball game, visited the campus Pagoda for a reception in The Gardens, given lectures to faculty, staff and students on campus, and more.\n\nThe next scholar lecture will take place from 10:30 a.m.-11:30 a.m. Friday, Dec. 6 in a location to be determined. The scholars will discuss lessons they have learned in the U.S. and how American style pedagogy and English will be used to enhance teaching in China.\n\nU.S. and Iranian Relations Topic of Wednesday Luncheon\n\nDr. Haleh Esfandiari spoke compellingly Wednesday about her 200-day detainment as an Iranian prisoner and the state of Iran today, during an event held in the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Morris University Center.\n\nThe timely topic examined international relations between the United States and Iran, and the possibility of a less adversarial future between the two nations. She compared Iran’s new president, Hussan Rohani, and how his diplomatic approach to foreign relations differed greatly from the adversarial approach taken by his predecessor, former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\n\n“Putting the words Iran, U.S. and progress in the same sentence is not so naïve, perhaps,” she said.\n\nEsfandiari talked about a recent interchange between U.S. President Barack Obama and the popular new Iranian president, noting for the first time in nearly 35 years, a short verbal interchange transpired between U.S. and Iranian leaders. It was over the telephone, and it was civil.\n\nDuring Rohani’s visit, he used his social media savvy to show to the world what he referred to as “the true face of Iran.” He has been empowered by Iran’s Supreme Leader Sayyid Ali Khamenei and is skillfully making the case for reforms to U.N. sanctions, Esfandiari said.\n\n“Rohani was “Tweeting” everything he did; everything he said,” Esfandiari said. “He said he borrowed the Iranian ambassador’s phone to speak with President Obama.\n\n“Rohani met with many influential people and gained favor with individuals to show how people have been suffering from the last 35 years of sanctions all along. His friends and adversaries were watching every move he made.”\n\nThese U.N. sanctions have included import and export limitations; the freezing of assets so that the government has limited financial resources; the inability to procure enriched uranium and denied access to pharmaceutical and medical advances to fight diseases in the country, Esfandiari said.\n\nShe described Rohani as “straight-forward and cunning, reliable and deceptively charming; a centrist and a pragmatist.” “While Ahmadinejad was ‘in your face,’ Rohani is a breath of fresh air,” she added. Since taking the helm as Iran’s president, Rohani has added three women to his cabinet and has been outspoken about Iran’s domestic conditions in pursuit of resolve.\n\nEsfandiari, director of Middle East programs at the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars in Washington D.C. dined with faculty members, students and staff in the University Club. During lunch she spoke on “The United States and Iran: Is Real Progress Possible?”\n\nThe event was the latest installment of programs planned by the SIUE Office of International Programs to engage the University community in thinking about global issues.\n\nShe is a widely published author, most recently completing the book, My Prison, My Home: One Woman’s Story of Captivity in Iran.\n\nBefore joining the Wilson Center she taught at Oxford and Princeton, and received numerous grants, including a highly-coveted MacArthur Foundation Fellowship. International luncheons are routinely hosted by the SIUE Office of International Programs. Attendance to the Dutch-treat event is open to the SIUE and the surrounding community. For more information, contact International Programs, dschill@siue.edu or rschaef@siue.edu, 618-650-3785.\n\nSIUE’s Educational Outreach Offers Reviews of Global, Historical & Health Topics This Week\n\nThe Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Office of Educational Outreach presents a week of topics ranging from global affairs, historical perspectives and the tackling of health issues.\n\n“The Present and Future of the European Union,” featuring presenter Sorin Nastasia, assistant professor of speech communication, will take place from 10:30-11:45 a.m. Wednesday, Oct. 23 in the SIUE Morris University Center (MUC) Mississippi-Illinois room.\n\nThe European Union (EU) has opened an array of opportunities for its citizens and its members, and it has also faced a series of economic and social challenges.\n\n“The presentation will provide an overview of opportunities and challenges, and will address how they are marking EU’s development and future,” said Cheryl Brunsmann, assistant director of educational outreach.\n\n“The Woman in the Dress: A Genealogic Portrait,” with presenter Gloria Perry, emerita professor of nursing, will be held from 1:15-2:30 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 23 in the MUC Mississippi-Illinois room. Attendees are encouraged to learn the historical story of the life of a 17-year-old German immigrant in the year 1855.\n\nThe presentation will allow time for the display of exhibits from this story provided from one German family’s experience.\n\n“It is intended to inspire attendees to write their own stories from a contextual basis,” Brunsmann said. “The presenter will wear the dress mentioned in the presentation title.”\n\nBoth events are sponsored by Stillwater Senior Living. The cost to attend is $2 for Lifelong Learning members and $5 for non-members.\n\nLocal historian and author, and SIUE retiree, Cindy Reinhardt will present “The Full Story: Combining Oral History, Photographs and Source Materials” from 9:30-10:30 a.m. Thursday, Oct. 24 at the Main Street Community Center, 1003 N. Main St. in Edwardsville.\n\n“Reinhardt will demonstrate through examples how the use of all three of these sources enrich and expand a story,” Brunsmann said.\n\nReinhardt is the author of two books of local history, and the editor of two newsletters about regional history for the Madison County Historical Society and the Friends of Leclaire Newsletter.\n\nShe has written many social histories of historic Edwardsville buildings, where, combining the above elements have led her to create rich, interesting stories about amazing people from our communities. There is no cost to attend the event and it is open to the public.\n\nAs part of the Brown Bag Speaker Series, held in collaboration with the SIUE Office of Human Resources, “Understanding Memory Loss,” with speaker Darrell Coons, Illinois outreach coordinator with the Alzheimer’s Association St. Louis Chapter, will be the topic of a program from 12:15-1 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 24 in the MUC Mississippi-Illinois room.\n\n“The discussion will focus on normal memory loss versus when it can be categorized as a problem; dementia and its risk factors, stages and the outlook for individuals living with it,” Brunsmann said. “A question and answer session will follow the presentation.”\n\nAdvanced registration is requested. For more information or to register, contact Cheryl Brunsmann, assistant director of educational outreach, cbrunsm@siue.edu with name, email address and daytime phone numbers of each individual planning to attend.\n\nThere is no cost to attend the Brown Bag event and it is open to the public. Campus visitors must pay to park in either lots B or C. Both lots are easily accessible to the location. Cost is $1 per hour.

Your so-called friends just posted a picture of you partying at homecoming. It was taken several hours after the game, your hair is messy, one of your eyes is closed and there is some unidentifiable stain on your favorite shirt. Sure, the picture is hilarious, but what will future employers think?\n\nThis year, a team of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville speech communication seniors is spreading the word about Bonfyre, a new social media app. They want their fellow Cougars to never worry about those embarrassing photos and regrettable social media posts.\n\nBonfyre is a social media company based in St. Louis with offices in Chicago and New York City. It was founded by two Washington University in St. Louis graduates who recognized the challenges and limitations of social media when it came to group organization and user privacy.\n\n“Bonfyre has always been focused on building a smarter platform to capture and share life’s moments with the people that matter,” remarked Ray Gobberg, Bonfyre co-founder.\n\nEssentially, the app organizes people around events and experiences where the user can post content and media to specific groups and no one else. The user can start a group, or Bonfyre, specifically for a specific circle such as peers from a class or colleagues at work. The user then posts content related to only those groups that only those in the group can view.\n\nThis means grandma and others in her group only get to see the wholesome, homecoming pictures that you give her. Meanwhile, your friends get to see the rough, Denny’s at 3 a.m., don’t-look-at-me-I’m-hideous photos.\n\nThe company launched a year ago this month at the DEMO tech conference as a check-in app for local college students. From there, the app was tweaked and reworked into its current form. Relying solely on word-of-mouth advertising, Bonfyre has found early success.\n\nWhile the app has dramatically changed from its original version, it still maintains ties with its early market—college students. Bonfyre already has ties to SIUE by employing many of its alumni. This year, Bonfyre is eager to share the app with the student body.\n\nBonfyre has teamed up with seniors from the SIUE Department of Speech Communication in the College of Arts and Sciences to help draft a public relations campaign targeted at the University in spring 2014.\n\nAlexa Hillery, SIUE student body president and copywriter for Ignite PR, the student team working with Bonfyre, said several big things are planned.\n\n“Bonfyre is known most often as a party app, and we intend to take full advantage of that,” Hillery said.\n\nThe team plans to lead training sessions for SIUE event planners and faculty to share ideas on how to effectively use the app at SIUE events and in the classroom. They also plan to host contests, distribute prizes and pass out free stuff at University events to encourage students to download the free app.\n\nHopefully after this year, students will know more about Bonfyre and begin to use the app daily. Most importantly by using Bonfyre to keep their personal, professional and school lives separate, students will stop shocking grandma and giving the wrong impression to employers, and might finally be able to run a successful campaign for New York City’s next mayor without the unnecessary faux pas.\n\nFor more information, contact Taylor Zimmerman at (615) 290-4347 or tzimmerman92@gmail.com.\n\nChronicle’s Selingo Reviews the State of Higher Ed\n\nThe Chronicle of Higher Education’s Jeffrey Selingo used Southern Illinois University Edwardsville as a stage for his analysis of higher education on Monday, Oct. 14. His thought-provoking presentation in the Morris University Center’s Meridian Ballroom touched on current issues faced by universities and colleges throughout the nation.\n\nSelingo is the editor-at-large of The Chronicle, where he has worked for 16 years in a variety of reporting and editing roles. An author, writer and thought leader on higher education, he has spent his journalism career covering colleges and universities worldwide. His work has been honored with awards from the Education Writers Association, Society of Professional Journalists and the Associated Press.\n\nSIUE Interim Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Ann Boyle brought Selingo to campus as part of the new REALITY project. Through a series of on-campus presentations for faculty and staff during the past two months, Boyle has addressed the changing landscape of higher education and the challenges posed for SIUE.\n\n“Changing student demographics and an increasing array of alternatives to traditional education programs are having a pronounced impact on higher education across the country,” Boyle said. “SIUE is susceptible to these changes, and we must strategically address them.”\n\nSelingo urged the audience to keep open minds as to what is possible for the future of higher education.\n\nHe listed the trouble signs as:\n\nRising costs of a college education and stagnant income of families\n\nDisappearing state support for public education\n\nFewer full-paying students\n\nSea of red ink as colleges’ debt has doubled since 2001\n\nSelingo noted that families face more out of pocket costs as their lack of home equity combines with squeezed state budgets and federal deficits.\n\nHe discussed the “Value Gap” as more families question whether a college education is still a good investment. Surveys of college presidents, faculty and parents demonstrated that 81 percent perceived a college education as a good value in 2008, but that number fell to 57 percent in 2012. Selingo stated that 40 percent of the public still sees a college diploma as a good investment.\n\nAs the U.S. falls behind the rest of the world in math skills, Selingo pondered what the future will bring? He indicated that there is not a lot of innovation at the core of most universities, but various schools and departments demonstrate creativity within that university structure.\n\n“Prestige is to higher education as profit is to corporations,” Selingo said. Those institutions with the household names and nationwide brand recognition will continue to do well. It is the challenge for smaller state and private schools to carve out their niche.\n\nNevertheless, Selingo is optimistic about the future of higher education, because there is still huge demand, particularly with international students. He expects that innovative schools will thrive, particularly those who focus on the student-centered model.\n\nSelingo believes universities will need to address how to effectively compete with their one size fits all approach as opposed to the a la carte educational experiences that are available to prospective students.\n\nStudents are seeking a personalized experience, according to Selingo. That can involve blending high school and college learning; experiential learning; competency-based or adaptive learning; free online courses; and 2+2 degrees.\n\nSelingo drew the biggest crowd reaction when he stated that the average age of a college grad finally finding economic independence is 32. He noted that colleges have a10-year impact on students from the year prior to entering the institution, through their four years of matriculation and the five years immediately following graduation.\n\nSelingo says the question now becomes how do we design structured pathways to help students? He described a few of the advantages of the traditional campus experience:\n\nFaculty as mentors\n\nUndergraduate research\n\nCross-cultural experiences\n\nBeing creative, taking risks and learning how to fail\n\nHe reviewed the risks faced by colleges as being: commodity courses, graduate studies, free agent professors and simple credentialing above and beyond a bachelor’s. He balanced those risks against the opportunities: certifying experiences, college alliances, redesigning first year and last year experiences, and proving value before external forces define it.\n\nSelingo’s newest book, College (Un)Bound: The Future of Higher Education and What It Means for Students, explores the college of the future – how families will pay, what campuses will look like, and how students will learn and prove their value in the job market.\n\nHow Can States Attract More High Achieving Minority Teachers? IERC at SIUE Releases Study on Teacher Supply Pipeline\n\nAn Illinois Education Research Council (IERC) study released today focuses on the racial diversity and academic composition of Illinois’ teachers and the factors that influence the makeup of the state’s teacher corps.\n\nBradford R. White and Eric J. Lichtenberger, both from the IERC, and Karen J. DeAngelis from the University of Rochester, collaborated on the study and found that several factors contribute to the composition of the state’s teacher corps.\n\n“Research has found that academically skilled teachers have positive impacts on student achievement and racial/ethnic minority teachers have a positive impact on minority student outcomes,” White said. “As a result, there are currently numerous efforts underway to improve the selectivity and the diversity of the teaching force, both nationally and in Illinois.”\n\nThe study sites the Council for Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP), which calls for recruiting candidates that reflect the diversity of the nation’s students. CAEP proposes admission standards for teacher preparation programs to require entering candidates have an average achievement in the top one-third of a national assessment.\n\n“Some evidence suggests that efforts to improve the academic skills of the overall teaching force can have a negative impact on teacher diversity, without a parallel commitment to maintaining such diversity,” White said. “Therefore, our goal in this study is to inform the design of policies and practices to improve the supply of academically skilled, diverse individuals into teaching.”\n\nIn order to do this, White notes the researchers conducting the study used a unique, longitudinal state database to track two Illinois high school cohorts from the classes of 2002 and 2003 through college and into the workforce. These students were tracked through five stages in the new teacher supply pipeline:\n\n• College entry\n\n• Enrollment in a four-year college\n\n• Completion of a bachelor’s degree\n\n• Achievement of teacher certification\n\n• Employment as Illinois public school teachers\n\n“We examine how each stage in this pipeline affects the composition of new entrants to K-12 public school teaching in Illinois, with particular attention to academic skills and racial/ethnic diversity; two characteristics of the teaching force that are at the forefront of local and national policy concerns,” White said.\n\nThe study found that only 3.2 percent of the Illinois public high school students studied became public school teachers by roughly a decade after completing high school.\n\nAnother important finding was that teachers from these cohorts were stronger academically, but less racially/ethnically diverse than their high school classmates who did not become teachers.\n\nHowever, “those who obtained teaching certificates had notably weaker academic qualifications compared to other bachelor’s degree earners,” White noted. “But those who actually became teachers were quite similar academically to non-teaching college graduates.”\n\nThe study concluded that the transition from certification to employment was one of the most critical stages in the new teacher pipeline. The researchers were surprised to learn that although one in five bachelor’s degree recipients across all disciplines became certified to teach, less than half of all certified teachers gained employment as a classroom teacher.\n\nThe IERC, established in 2000, provides Illinois with education research to support education policy making and program development for preschool through graduate school.\n\nIn accordance with its mission, the IERC undertakes independent research and policy analysis, which informs and strengthens Illinois’ commitment to providing a seamless system of educational opportunities for its citizens.\n\nFor more information about the IERC, and its research, policy work, and outreach visit www.siue.edu/ierc, follow the organization on Facebook and Twitter @IERC_SIUE, email ierc@siue.edu, or call 618-650-2840, or toll-free, 866-799-4372.\n\nArab-Israeli Relations First Topic of SIUE’s International Speaker Series\n\nDr. Robert Diprizio spoke to a captivated audience in the MUC during a presentation on the Arab-Israeli Conflict.\n\nDr. Robert C. Diprizio spoke to a full crowd in the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Morris University Center Mississippi-Illinois room Thursday, Oct. 10 about “The Arab-Israeli Conflict and the Dilemma of the Two State Solution.”\n\nDiprizio, an associate professor at the United States Air Force Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base, presented both sides of the Arab-Israeli conflict. From the side of the Palestinians, who occupied the region of today’s Israel for 1,400 years, to the side of the Israelis who claim the region was promised to them by God.\n\n“Both claim it to be their ancient homeland,” Diprizio said. “These are two peoples with heartfelt claims to the same land that they can’t share. Any effort to create a two-state solution will encounter stumbling blocks.”\n\nIn the late 1800s, the Jewish national movement known as Zionism was introduced in response to centuries of European Anti-Semitism in order to establish an independent Jewish state within Palestine. But it wasn’t until after World War II and the Holocaust that the movement took off, gaining the support of the United Nations and a horrified Europe looking to “assuage its guilt,” Diprizio said.\n\n“The Arabs had nothing to do with the Holocaust, and thought they shouldn’t have half their property taken away from them for this,” he said.\n\nDiprizio walked the group of attendees through a comprehensive history of the plight of both groups and what has led to the tension in Israel and Palestine today.\n\n“The problem is the region has too much history, and there is not enough land,” he said. “The Israelis believe they are God’s chosen people and the region is their national homeland. They need territories that belong to Palestine as security buffers, which present issues regarding the West Bank. The collective view is that the Arabs lost the war they started and that the Palestinians aren’t a real nation; just Arabs.\n\n“The Palestinians have lived in this region for centuries,” he added. “There are holy sites on these lands for the Muslim population. They are not responsible for the Holocaust and take the perspective that self-determination is a human right. They have argued that they have already given up 78 percent of their homeland, and that Jews are a religious, not a national group.”\n\nJerusalem is home to a prime holy site for both Palestinian Muslims and the Israelis, Diprizio said.\n\nThe Temple Mount, known as the Haram al-Sharif in Arabic, was erected on the site that the Jewish believe to be the remnants of the old great temple. The Romans tore down the temple.\n\nThe Green Line, which had been established more than 60 years ago to form a de facto border between the then new state of Israel and its neighbors—Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt—was challenged by Palestine and Arab armies during a six-day war. During this war, the Israelis held their ground. Since that time, the Israelis have usurped new territories and stretched their reach to the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nPalestinians, who gave up 78 percent of their land 60 years ago, are losing more of their territories and more of their human rights because of Israeli domination. Palestinians, who have been fleeing the region since the inception of the Palestinian state, are continuing to do so, choosing to reside in refugee camps.\n\n“Israel is annexing blocks of the Palestinian state,” Diprizio said. “This settlement situation is truly corrosive for the Palestinians.”\n\nDiprizio spent a great deal of time explaining the stumbling blocks between these two groups:\n\nEast Jerusalem and its holy buildings\n\nThe usurping of settlements and upheaval of the Palestinian people\n\nMaintaining security\n\nEstablishing clear borders\n\nProviding assistance and support to refugees\n\nEnsuring both groups of peoples gain equal access to water resources\n\nHe referenced how the Geneva Initiative calls for the following:\n\nA return to the previously established 1967 Israeli borders\n\nA swap of equal quality land between both groups, making Arab villages part of Palestine and Israeli villages part of Israel\n\nCompensating refugees for their losses as a result of the 1948-49 conflict and allowing them to return to a new Palestinian state, which will include multinational peacekeeping forces and shared access to water supplies\n\nSplitting Jerusalem and granting only shared, dual key permissions for any alterations to the holy site within the city\n\nThe next International Speakers Series event will take place from 9:30-10:45 a.m. in the MUC Mississippi-Illinois room on Thursday, Nov. 7. Dr. Paul R. Viotti, the executive director of the Institute on Globalization and Security (IGLOS) at the University of Denver in Colorado will discuss “Gay and Minorities in the Armed Forces and the Evolving Role of Women in Armed Combat.”\n\nThe International Speakers Series is hosted by the Center for International Programs and made possible by the United States Institute of Peace. The USIP is an independent, non-partisan conflict management center created by Congress to prevent and mitigate international conflict without resorting to violence.\n\n“USIP is pleased to support organizations like the SIUE Center for International Programs and their contributions to the national conversation around international conflict—and methods for resolving those conflicts nonviolently,” stated USIP President Jim Marshall in a statement about the funding.\n\nSIUE’s Center for International Programs provides a wealth of programming designed to educate the campus population and surrounding community about issues of global significance. A spring series is scheduled, which is funded in part by the SIUE Meridian Society, an organization of women philanthropists. Independent of the International Speaker Series, the Center often hosts luncheons that provide valuable programs.\n\nLast month, the Center introduced retired Ambassador John Maisto to the campus to discuss “Dealing with Dictators and Difficult Democrats: Half a Century of American Foreign Policy.” Some lively conversation ensued between those who attended the lunch meeting and Maisto.\n\n“All of our presentations are based on balance,” said Brent Shapiro, program director for the International Speaker Series.\n\nMaisto had served as the U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua after the Sandinistas lost the presidency and had a transition in government. He later became the U.S. ambassador to Venezuela and director of Latin American Affairs on the National Security Council, and the U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of American States.\n\nRetired Ambassador John Maisto spoke in September as part of one of many lunch engagements made possible by the SIUE Center for International Programs.\n\nHe had served as deputy ambassador to the OAS during the Haitian crisis. Prior to that, and just as the Marcos regime began to crumble, Maisto became the political officer in Manila.\n\nThe opportunities to meet foreign and domestic dignataries, and scholars offer attendees the chance to engage in enriching discussions, allowing them to ask questions and gain valuable insights about diplomats and diplomacy from other countries around the globe.\n\nFor more information, contact the Center for International Programs, located in the lower level of the Student Success Center, (618) 650-3785.\n\nAmerican and Muslim Series Continues at SIUE\n\nTwo lectures remain in the American and Muslim Series sponsored by Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Library and Information Services. The student-centered series is being held in cooperation with the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Library Association.\n\n“Children of Abraham: An Interfaith Discussion with Muslim and Christian SIUE Students” will take place from 4-5 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 23 in the Friends’ Corner of Lovejoy Library. During the event, a discussion will take place about the significance of Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Mary to Muslims and Christians.\n\n“The Muslim world is everywhere,” said Steve Tamari, an associate professor of Historical Studies at SIUE. He has worked closely with the Muslim Student Organization on campus to bring programs to campus. “The Muslim American population is as diverse as the world population.\n\n“There are Muslims everywhere, just as there are Christians everywhere.”\n\nThe event planned for Oct. 23 will include representatives from the Jewish, Christian and Muslim faiths. These representatives will discuss their shared traditions and similar views, as well as their unique differences.\n\nThe showing of “Allah Made Me Funny: A Film” will take place from 7-8:30 p.m. Tuesday, Nov. 19 in the SIUE Abbott Auditorium. The film features three Muslim comics who find the humor in everything from family to food to American politics and their fellow Muslims.\n\nThe first event, “Being Muslim and American: A Student Panel,” was widely attended. The frank discussion focused on what it means to be Muslim and American; the misunderstandings, ambivalence and even hostility Muslims face among non-Muslim America.\n\nThis series has been made possible through the “Bridging Cultures: The Muslim Journey’s Bookshelf” grant from the NEH and ALA.\n\n“I think there are a lot of misconceptions about the Muslim world in general among Americans,” Tamari said. “There are a lot of reasons for that—especially in the post 9/11 world in which we live.\n\n“There is this general lack of understanding that so many Americans are Muslims. It’s a growing number and they are as much American as they are Muslim.”\n\nThe purpose of the programs offered through the grant funding is “to broaden and deepen the understanding” about this segment of the population. There are more American and Muslim programs as part of the series slated to take place in the spring.\n\nPrinceton Review Tabs SIUE School of Business Among Nation’s Best\n\nSouthern Illinois University Edwardsville’s School of Business is named again as one of the best in the country by The Princeton Review. The education services company features the school in the new 2014 edition of its book “The Best 295 Business Schools.”\n\n“We are very pleased to once again be selected by The Princeton Review,” said School of Business Interim Dean John Navin. “The fact that this list is based on students’ ratings of their educational experience is a sound acknowledgement of the quality of education we provide our students.”\n\nAccording to Robert Franek, Princeton Review senior vice president-publisher, “We recommend Southern Illinois University Edwardsville as one of the best institutions a student could attend to earn a business school degree.\n\n“We chose the schools we profile in this book based on our high regard for their academic programs and our reviews of institutional data we collect from the schools. We also solicit and greatly respect the opinions of students attending these schools that rate and report on their experiences at them on our 80-question student survey for the book.”\n\n“The Best 295 Business Schools: 2014 Edition” has two-page profiles of the schools with write-ups on their academics, student life and admissions. In the profile of SIUE, The Princeton Review editors describe the school as: “exceptional and convenient, and located close to a metropolitan area.”\n\nSIUE students in the publication are quoted as saying, “Most of my professors still consult in their respective industries. They are very current on business trends and developments.”\n\nAdditional comments from students about faculty included, “They seem to truly care about students learning and being able to apply information in the real world,” and that faculty “know how to communicate their information to their students effectively.”\n\nIn a “Survey Says . . .” sidebar in the profile, The Princeton Review lists “good peer network, solid preparation in general management, communication, interpersonal skills and doing business in a global economy” as topics that students it surveyed were in most agreement about pertaining to the University. The 80-question survey asked business school students about their school’s academics, student body and campus life, as well as about themselves and their career plans.\n\nThe Princeton Review tallied lists based on its surveys of 19,000 students attending the 295 business schools. The survey asked students to rate multiple attributes of their schools, including their professors and fellow classmates.\n\n“The Best 295 Business Schools” is one of more than 150 Princeton Review books published by Random House. The line includes “The Best 169 Law Schools” and “The Best 167 Medical Schools,” plus guides to graduate school admission exams and application essays.\n\nThe Princeton Review is also known for its guides to colleges and to standardized tests, its classroom and online test-prep courses, tutoring, and other education services. Headquartered in Framingham, Mass., The Princeton Review is not affiliated with Princeton University, and it is not a magazine.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Costello Spoke at SIUE on Nation’s Infrastructure\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Jerry Costello delivered a thoughtful lecture on “Our Nation’s Infrastructure—Approaching Crisis?” on Tuesday night to a full audience in the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Morris University Center Mississippi-Illinois room.\n\nMostly political science and engineering students turned out for the event. Costello is the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute Leader in Residence at SIU Carbondale. His visit was being made possible by the SIUE Department of Political Science Civic Education Project.\n\n“Population growth and development place additional stress on all forms of infrastructure in the United States,” Costello said. “Our infrastructure is important for us to deliver products and provide services every day. People use our bridges to get to and from work. Our waterways are used to get goods to market. Our aviation industry transports goods and people across the nation and around the world.\n\n“When the majority of our nation’s infrastructure is outdated and in need of repair, it affects how we do everything. It has a direct impact on every aspect of our economy.”\n\nCostello cited the American Society of Civil Engineers’ 2013 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure, which gave the nation’s infrastructure as a whole a D+, infrastructure in Illinois a D+ and infrastructure in Missouri a C-.\n\nHe noted recent investments in railways place that form of infrastructure to move people and goods in the best position regarding its health, safety and viability. Amtrak, he said, had the greatest number of travelers in its history in 2012.\n\nThe talk was particularly timely following the recent closure of a Wisconsin bridge because one of its sections dropped several feet, and this summer’s bridge collapse in Washington that sent three individuals to the hospital.\n\n“And who can forget the tragic bridge collapse in Minnesota?” said Laurie Rice, associate professor of Political Science. “Studies of the state of our nation’s infrastructure warn more tragedies could be on the horizon unless something is done.”\n\nRice thought the topic was an important issue to bring to the public’s attention and that Costello was the perfect person to present the information. She thanked him for offering his expertise in this area to SIUE’s students and attendees from the outside community.\n\n“We rely on the health of our nation’s infrastructure every day,” said Rice, adding, “whether it’s relying on the safety of our drinking water as it comes out of the faucet, expecting lights to come on when we flip a switch, driving across a bridge and assuming it will hold the weight of our vehicles, or trusting that the plane or train we board will get us to our destination safely and on time.”\n\nDuring his 25-year tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives, Costello served on several committees and subcommittees. Those included the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, highways subcommittee, the water resources subcommittee, the rail subcommittee and more. He also served as the chairman of the aviation subcommittee, making him uniquely suited to address this pressing public policy issue.\n\nPNC Director Speaks at SIUE Power Breakfast\n\nSouthern Illinois University Edwardsville’s School of Business held its annual Power Breakfast on Oct. 3. The keynote speaker was Gordon A. Johnson, BS BA ’82, MBA ’84, managing director and senior portfolio manager of the select equity investment team at PNC Capital Advisors.\n\nThe Power Breakfast helps to connect prominent alumni from the region and across the U.S. with their alma mater. The event also encourages students to develop valuable mentoring relationships with successful alumni and faculty.\n\nMore than 80 School of Business faculty, alumni and their mentees attended the Power Breakfast. The “invitation only” aspect of the event makes it an honor for students to be invited.\n\nA proud supporter of SIUE, Johnson started his presentation by providing his reasons for attending the University.\n\n“When I first came to SIUE, I didn’t know much about it,” said Johnson. “I knew it was near St. Louis which was going to help with looking for a job after graduation. I also knew it had a great business school and a great accounting reputation.”\n\nThroughout the presentation, Johnson discussed the different changes that occurred throughout his career and how it ended up being beneficial. Noting the importance of flexibility, Johnson stressed the need for students and employees to be able to adapt when there is a bump in the road.\n\nEntering into his undergraduate program, Johnson majored in business. With a plan to work in finance and investments, he found some struggles along the way.\n\n“Looking back, some classes were really hard,” he said. “I took a class called ‘Money in Banking,’ and I just didn’t get it. You think you’re on a career path, but then there is that one class that makes you rethink your path. It happens in every major.”\n\nUpon receiving his degree, Johnson found himself in a tough economy and a bad time for the banking industry. After an extensive job search, Johnson returned to SIUE to pursue his master’s degree.\n\n“Graduate school wasn’t in my original plan, but all of a sudden it seemed to be a very good idea to me,” Johnson stated.\n\nJohnson met Mark Deschaine during his time in the MBA program. Deschaine was the president of a small investment firm called Investment Counselors, Inc., located in Clayton. Johnson described how he bothered Shane for months to get a job at the firm.\n\n“After talking with him in class, I thought it sounded like an interesting career,” said Johnson. “I thought if I stuck around and persisted enough I would be able to join his firm.”\n\nDuring the presentation, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Narbeth Emmanuel asked what students should do to prepare for the workforce. Johnson explained the importance of making connections and learning soft skills such as communication.\n\nJohn Navin, interim dean of the School of Business, concurs. “Over the years, the School of Business has heard several employers say they want employees with good communication skills,” Navin stated. “We have taken that feedback and begun to provide our students with the tools they need to obtain those skills.”\n\n“We are proud to have Gordon as an alumnus,” said Navin. “He is an example of what great determination can do for you. I hope the students were able to take that away from his presentation.”\n\nPhoto: PNC Managing Director and Senior Portfolio Manager Gordon Johnson speaks to SIUE School of Business faculty, staff and students.\n\nWorld Famous Fiddler, Eileen Ivers, in Concert at SIUE\n\nNamed as the “Jimi Hendrix of the violin” by The New York Times, Eileen Ivers will bring her electrifying performance to Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.\n\nIvers, world-renowned American fiddler/violinist and Grammy-Award winner, will appear with her band, Immigrant Soul, at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 23 in the Morris University Center Meridian Ballroom.\n\nThe Irish-American fiddler demonstrates a blend of traditional and contemporary violin music that captivates a wide range of audiences.

The SBDC operates out of SIUE’s School of Business with offices located in Edwardsville and at the East St. Louis Center.\n\n“After interviewing a number of qualified candidates, it was clear to the selection committee that Jo Ann’s background was a perfect fit for our Center,” said SBDC Director Patrick McKeehan. “Her personal experience in a family-owned business followed by work at the SBDC and a bank has given Jo Ann a strong insight into the challenges faced by small businesses. Jo Ann is a great addition for SBDC clients within our nine-county region.”\n\n“I look forward to promoting the SBDC and becoming a key supporter of small business and entrepreneurial success in southwestern Illinois,” Di Maggio said.\n\nDi Maggio earned a bachelor’s in business administration from SIUE in 2005 and followed with an MBA in 2007.\n\n“My education at SIUE has been a tremendous asset to my personal and professional development,” Di Maggio said. “My degree choice was simple since my family owns a small Italian restaurant, and I wanted to expand my knowledge and training in all aspects of running a business.”\n\nDi Maggio’s brothers own Di Maggio Brothers Pizza and Pasta in Highland, while her parents own Di Maggio’s Pizza and Pasta in Pinckneyville.\n\nA Glen Carbon resident, Di Maggio was a graduate assistant for the Small Business Development Center at SIUE from August 2005-September 2007. She also has served as an international business consultant for the SBDC’s International Trade Center (ITC). Di Maggio’s other work experience included being an assistant manager at Walgreen’s in Edwardsville, a personal banker for US Bank in Belleville and a mortgage counselor for US Bank in St. Louis.\n\n“I have experienced first-hand not only the joy, but also the sacrifice and struggles of small business owners and entrepreneurs,” Di Maggio said. For this reason I am passionately dedicated to helping these individuals reach their goals.”\n\nSIUE’s Karen Kelly Receives Outstanding Friend to Nursing Award\n\nThe Southern Illinois University Edwardsville School of Nursing honored five recipients with 2013 School of Nursing Excellence Awards at the Nursing Excellence Gala and 50th Anniversary Celebration on Saturday, Oct. 5.

These alumni have achieved notoriety in their respective fields, are role models and are a testament to SIUE’s educational excellence.\n\n“Those selected for the Alumni Hall of Fame represent the best who have received an SIUE education,” said Steve Jankowski, director of Alumni Affairs. “It is our honor to induct these outstanding individuals.”\n\nThe 2013 honorees listed by their college school:\n\nSchool of Business\n\nMichael Wenzel graduated from SIUE in 1970 with a bachelor’s in business administration/general accounting.

Later in the week, ELITE took a tour of the St. Louis-based investment firm to get more information.\n\nELITE President Maeve Juenger is a senior accounting and economics and finance major from Waterloo. He said the point of the workshop was to give School of Business students the opportunity to get feedback on their resumes before attending SIUE Career Development Center’s career fairs. “It never hurts to have another opinion,” said Juenger. “The goal of the workshop was to help students refine their resumes in time for the career fair.”\n\nDuring the week, students learned the dos and don’ts of interviewing. Smucker and Marcheski discussed networking, types of resumes, first impressions and the importance of thank you cards. After the presentation, students had the opportunity to speak one-on-one with Smucker and Marcheski to discuss their resumes.\n\nJuenger hoped the students were able to make a connection with Smucker and Marcheski to help with their future job searches. “Since students had the opportunity to talk to the Edward Jones employees one-on-one, I hope they built their network by establishing a connection. This could be someone the student could reach out to in the future.”\n\nOn Friday, ELITE members visited the Edward Jones campus to learn about employment opportunities, such as internships and entry-level positions. During the visit, students also were provided information about the company, its strategy and its history. “This knowledge will be useful during an interview if the students decide to apply at Edward Jones,” said Juenger.\n\n“ELITE hopes that this is only the first of many events of this nature,” said Juenger. “One of our goals is to provide professional and career development opportunities to School of Business students.”\n\nIn the past, ELITE has partnered with other companies and individuals such as Monsanto and alumnus Corey Wenzel, BSA ’02, MBA ’03. Wenzel spoke to students about his development of the Enclave apartment complex, as well as entrepreneurship.\n\n“ELITE is always looking for ideas for guest speakers and company tours and is on the lookout for contacts we can tap into,” said Juenger.\n\nELITE is a group of School of Business student leaders who serve as a liaison between students, faculty, alumni, and others affiliated with the School of Business.\n\nPhoto (L to R): Nathan Vogt, Josh Smucker, Sean Tran, Robert Guynn and Zach Carter."
