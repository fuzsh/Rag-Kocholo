        "text": "Eight workers showed up at 6:30 a.m. Saturday morning in front of the Redoute building with a 100-ton crane. Piece by piece, they began at 8:00 a.m. to cut down a 160-year old beech tree. The 25-meter tall tree with a four-meter trunk circumference had been infested with a fungus for some time already. Two branches had fallen on the sidewalk, the crown was visibly infected and its condition deteriorated every year. The fungus ate at the wood and weakened the tree, which could have put it in danger of falling. Officials worried the tree was a danger to the public.\n\nOne man who came with his two small daughters to watch the tree cutting, said they will miss the tree. It was always a part of their trip as they passed by it on their way into Bad Godesberg. But they understood why it had to go. City Parks worker Rolf Dung took the time to show the family how the fungus looked on a piece of the tree which they had already cut down. Dung said he was not sure what kind of tree would be planted in its place but that an exotic tree might fit well in the Redoute garden."
