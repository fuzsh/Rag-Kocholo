action\n\nRelative deprivation\n\n\n\nArises from the perception that you are worse off compared to other people or groups\n\nThree components\n\n\n\nSocial comparison - compare yourself to another\n\n\n\nAppraisal - appraises that he/she is disadvantaged relative to that other group\n\n\n\nIllegiticimacy - the disadvantage is perceived as illegitimate and unfair\n\nArises from a subjective evaluation\n\n\n\nStructurally advantaged people can experience relative deprivation\n\nDistinction between individual deprivation (called egoistic) and group based deprivation (called\n\nfraternal)\n\n\n\nIndividual deprivation based on interpersonal social comparisons (s/he has more than me)\n\n\n\nGroup deprivation based on intergroup social comparisons\n\n\n\nFit between the level and the outcome\n\nCollective action\n\nRelative deprivation is a strong predictor of collective action\n\n\n\nIt makes people angry\n\n\n\nDifference between perceiving an inequality and feeling an inequality\n\nGroup based anger\n\n\n\nAnger based on group membership\n\n\n\nInvokes specific action tendencies to confront those responsible\n\n\n\nState of action readiness\n\nA meta-analysis showed that anger is a better predictor of engagement in collective action than\n\nperceptions of injustice\n\nSocial identifiation\n\n\n\nThat part of an individuals self concept which derives from his of her knowledge of\n\nmembership to a social group (or groups) together with the value and emotional significance\n\nattached to it\n\nKlandermans (2002)\n\n\n\nCollective action presents a social dilemma:\n\no Based on pure rationality (cost-benefit), individuals would take a 'free ride'\n\n\n\nThe more someone identifies with a group, the more likely it is that s/he will participate in\n\nprotest if they feel that the group is being treated unjustly\n\n\n\nSocial identification helps us to 'overcome the dilemma of collective action'\n\no The group is self\n\no Fosters an inner-obligation\n\nWhat kind of social identity?\n\n\n\nPoliticised identities\n\no Group members engage as a mindful and self-conscious collective in a power\n\nstruggle knowing that it is the wider, more inclusive societal context in which this\n\nstruggle takes place and needs to be orchestrated accordingly\n\n\n\nSocial identities are based on opinions about how the world should be are particularly useful\n\no Pro marriage\n\no Anti poverty\n\no Pro-reconcilliation\n\no Pro-animal welfare\n\nThe Social Identity Model of Collective Action\n\nEngaging Online\n\nFriday, 20 September 2019\n\n10:24 am\n\nNew technologies and social change\n\n\n\nFacilitation hypothesis\n\n\n\nSlacktivism hypothesis\n\nKony 2012\n\n\n\nCampaign to

internet phenomena\n\n\n\n100 million downloads\n\n\n\n50% of young American adults had heard about Kony2012 in the days following the release\n\n\n\nThe offline campaign attracted a low level of support\n\n\n\nSlacktivism pointed out Kony2012 as another failure of online action\n\nWorkshop Part\n\nEnaging online is a valid, meaningful expression of social identities based on opinions about how we\n\nwant the world to be\n\n\n\nNot disconnected or part of a personal, self promoting agenda\n\nEngaging online reflects a desire to enhance the groups interests\n\nConventional, political collective action:\n\n\n\nAction that conforms to the norms of the existing social system, such as political\n\nparticipation or peaceful protest\n\nExtreme, radical collective action\n\n\n\nAction that violates the rules of the exisiting social system, such as unlawful behaviour,\n\nviolence and at its most extreme - terrorism\n\nOnline forms of civic engagement/participation are 'slack', meaningless and trivial\n\n\n\nBut\n\nOnline radicalisation is a real threat\n\nPathways to engagement and extremism\n\n\n\nEngagement and extremism are processes\n\no Politicisation\n\n\n\nIncreasing awareness that a given issue/problem is embedded in a system of\n\nunequal power relation\n\no Radicalisation\n\n\n\nA change in beliefs, feelings and behaviours in directions that increasingly\n\njustify intergroup violence and demand sacrifice in defense of the ingroup\n\no The 'ends justify the means'\n\nMobilisation through social interaction\n\n\n\nThrough discussion and debate people can develop and reach consensus about who we are\n\nand what we do\n\n\n\nSocial interaction is a driver of 'grassroots' (bottom up) social identity formation\n\nExtremism\n\n\n\nPolitical violence literature\n\no Analysis of web content showed how group members can radicalise through online\n\ninteraction\n\nSocial interaction can contribute to both political engagement and extremism\n\nRadicalisation can emerge from social interaction in context\n\n\n\nCombination of inter and intra group factors\n\n\n\nInteraction is not inevitably linked to extremism\n\nPoliticisation and radicalisation can be understood as a social process or pathway\n\n\n\nNot a product of specific social conditions in certain societies or religious groups, nor an\n\naspect of psychopathology\n\nExtremism\n\nFriday, 20 September 2019\n\n11:05 am\n\nHow can we understand the drivers of diverging forms of collective action?\n\n\n\nLots of different

that conforms to the norms of the existing social system, such as political\n\nparticipation or peaceful protest\n\nExtreme, radical collective action:\n\n\n\nAction that violates the rules of the existing social system, such as unlawful behaviour,\n\nviolence and at its most - terrorism\n\nUnderstanding radical action\n\n\n\nThe relations between emotional reactions to injustice, efficacy and action differs for more\n\nextreme, radical (non-normative) forms of collective action.\n\nEmotional pathway\n\n\n\nAnger predicts engagement in conventional, political actions\n\no Anger is a constructive emotion\n\n\n\nContempt predicts engagement in extreme, radical (non-normative) forms of collective\n\naction\n\no Contempt is associated with derogation of social relationships and social exclusion\n\no Leads to a physical and psychological distancing\n\nEfficacy pathway\n\n\n\nGroup efficacy predicts engagement in conventional, political (normative) actions\n\n\n\nA lack of efficacy predicts engagement in extreme, radical (non-normative) forms of\n\ncollective action\n\no Individuals feel that their group is powerless to address an injustice\n\no Nothing to lose\n\nDistributive justice and entitlement\n\nSunday, 13 October 2019\n\n5:30 pm\n\nThe perspective of psychology\n\n\n\nSubjective perceptions of justice\n\no How they respond to experiences of justice\n\nThree areas of justice:\n\n\n\nDistributive justice\n\nMulti-principle approaches\n\n\n\nAssumption of several distinct justice principles\n\no Contribution (equity) principle\n\n\n\nShould be based on input/contribution, shared resources or benefits\n\no Equality principle\n\n\n\nShould ignore any differentiating outcomes, and should share it\n\no Need principle\n\n\n\nShould be based on need\n\n\n\nAppropriateness depends on the social construction of the situation\n\n\n\nDeutsch (1975) - value orientation\n\no Economical orientation (productivity): equity\n\no Solidarity orientation (relationships): equality\n\no Care orientation (welfare of others): need\n\nNormative and instrumental reasons for adoption of principle\n\n\n\nDefinition of situation requires certain principles\n\n\n\nApply principle to define situation in a certain way\n\nImplications\n\n\n\nRelative to equity theory less individualistic: a more social conception of justice\n\no Justice exisits and has a normative power distinct from concerns about (immediate)\n\nself interest\n\no There are multiple notions of justice\n\no Their normativeness/relevance depends on the situation\n\no Understanding of justice shared when social construction of the situation is shared\n\nBelief in a Just World\n\nSunday, 13 October 2019\n\n6:03 pm\n\nNormal people will reject, or devalue an innocent victim, if they are not able to intervene effectively\n\nto correct the injustice.\n\nBelief in a just world theory\n\n\n\nPeople generally need to believe that the world is a just place where people get what they\n\ndeserve\n\n\n\nThis is the basis of their justice motive, the motivation to maintain justice and fairness\n\no Through\n\n\n\nRational strategies Non-rational strategies Protective strategies\n\nPrevention\n\nRestitution\n\nBlaming the victim\n\nDerogating the victim\n\nReinterpreting outcomes\n\nDenial/withdrawal\n\nBelief in ultimate justice\n\nJust and unjust words\n\nWhy do people need to believe in a just world?\n\n\n\nA personal contract\n\no When children to delay gratifications\n\no Personal contract requires that the world is just: people get what they deserve\n\no BJW is part of humans' long-term goal-orientated behaviour\n\no But becomes value in itself (impartial commitment to justice)\n\nLong term goal orientation\n\n\n\nParticipants focused on long term goals\n\n\n\nBlamed, derogated and disassociated from an innocent victim (but not a non-innocent\n\nvictim)\n\nResponses to own suffering\n\n\n\nWould people similarly protect their BJW when they are the victim?\n\no Bulman and Wortman interviews with paraplegic victims of accidents\n\n\n\nRather than avoiding blame, Ps attributed more blame to themselves than\n\nthe objective circumstances would warrant\n\n\n\nThe more victimes blamed themselves for the accident, the better their\n\nsubsequent adjustment (as rated by nurses and social workers)\n\no Is self blame always adaptive?\n\nBJW as a personal resource?\n\n\n\nDalbert: BJW as a personal resource\n\no Helps to maintain and foster a sense of well-being, specifically in the face of\n\nnegative-life events\n\no Conceptualised and measured as an individual difference variable\n\n\n\nBuffered against anger and self-esteem loss when recalling an anger provoking experience\n\n(injustice)\n\n\n\nWhy should people high in BJW manage their anger and maintain their health better?\n\nProcedural Justice and Legitimacy\n\nTuesday, 15 October 2019\n\n2:12 pm\n\nProcedural justice\n\n\n\nHow do people want to see their disputes resolved?\n\no When would people turn to third parties?\n\nDisputes in legal contexts: inquisitorial vs adversarial systems.\n\nObjective accuracy and subjective fairness\n\n\n\nIn group charged with stealing ideas from other teams\n\no Hearing: inquisitorial v adversarial procedure\n\no Verdict: innocent v guilty\n\nExtending the concept\n\n\n\nLeventhal (1980)\n\no Consistency\n\no Bias suppression\n\no Accuracy of information\n\no Correctability\n\nInstrumental v relational perspectives\n\n\n\nInstrumental concerns: legitimacy attributions based on favourability of outcomes and\n\ndecisions\n\nRelational concerns- legitimacy attributuons based on the relationship and identity communicated\n\nthrough authorities/system\n\n\n\nProcedural justice, in decision-making and treatment\n\no Communicates respect and standing within group\n\no Provides basis for pride and identification with group\n\n\n\nPositive social identity\n\nLegitimacy beyond compliance\n\n\n\nCompliance: willingness to obey the rules, to accept decisions Obligation\n\n\n\nCooperation: volunteering efforts to work with and support the authority Trust and\n\nConfidence\n\n\n\nCommunity engagement: conducting ones own initiatives and working alongside the\n\nauthority to advance shared goals and values Normative alignment\n\nMoral conviction\n\n= the strong belief that certain outcomes, certain duties or rights derive from a higher moral\n\npurpose, from fundamentals of right and wrong\n\n\n\nMay trump procedural fairness of decision making in determining decision acceptance\n\n\n\nAnd may also affect legitimacy perceptions\n\nRetributive Justice\n\nFriday, 18 October 2019\n\n2:06 pm\n\nRestoration of justice after wrongdoing\n\n\n\nIt implies holding someone accountable for the injustice\n\n\n\nSee punishment\n\nCompensation and punishment\n\n\n\nCompensation is the repair of harm/injustice caused by trangression\n\no Restitution (undone)\n\no Reparation (equivalent payment)\n\n\n\nPunishment: suffering or costs imposed on the offender in addition to\n\ncompensation, in response to the wrongdoing itself.\n\no Retributive justice in a narrow sense: a principle of justice restoration\n\nthrough the imposition of punishment on the offender in proportion to the moral\n\nseverity of their wrongdoing\n\nAttribution of responsibility and blame\n\n\n\nDarley and pittman (2003)\n\no Unintentional harm leads to compensation\n\no Intentional is punishment\n\no Negligent: may vary between compensation and punishment\n\n\n\nAttributions of responsibility are key determinants, mediated by moral outrage\n\no Intention = moral outrage = retribution\n\nPunishment and revenge\n\n\n\nA matter of perspective\n\no Revenge: punitive punishment by the victim\n\no Punishment: punitive response by a third-party authority\n\nPunishment goals:\n\n\n\nJustice (just desert, retributivism): backward looking, restoring a moral balance\n\n\n\nBehaviour control (utalitarinaism) forward looking, prevention of future occurences\n\no Specific detterence\n\no General deterrence\n\no Incapacitation\n\no Rehabilitation\n\nBehaviour control vs justice\n\n\n\nPeople don’t have insight into their true punishment motives\n\n\n\nBehavioural process tracing method\n\nWhy the urge to punish?\n\nDoes it make us feel better?\n\n\n\nDe Quervain et al. (2004): brain regions activated during decision to punish a\n\nwrongdoer (the dorsal striatum), involved the processing of rewards\n\n\n\nCarlsmith, Wilson, &amp; Gilbert (2008): participants wrongly anticipate to feel better\n\nafter punishing wrong-doer, they actually feel worse\n\n\n\nGollwitzer &amp; Bushman (2012): “frozen-mood pills” and “good-mood rooms” with no\n\neffect on willingness to punish\n\n. Do we merely want to see the offender suffer?\n\n\n\nImagine an offence against you ... and then the offender has bad luck and loses\n\nmoney by fate, or you are in the position to impose a loss on the offender:\n\nWould you feel equally satisfied?\n\n\n\nGollwitzer et al. (2011): it depends on whether the offender recognises the imposed\n\nsuffering as a punishment for their wrongdoing – if so, imposition is more satisfying\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; communicative function of punishment (Funk et al., 2014)\n\nRetributive and restorative justice\n\n\n\nRetributive justice: justice through imposition of punishment\n\no Punishment per se: no moral transformation (acceptance or remorse) of\n\noffender required\n\n\n\nRestorative justice: justice through consensus between parties\n\no Punishment may be part of the process if parties agree on it as a measure\n\nWhen do people endorse which notion of justice?\n\nSymbolic implications of trangressions"
