        "text": "By Curt Herron\n\nFor the IWCOA\n\nThe sign of a quality program is that when it experiences some disappointment it usually bounces right back and responds in a positive way to help ease some of the pain.\n\nThat’s just what Lockport did over the weekend when it fell just short of winning another conference title but instead came away with a strong tournament showing that should benefit it as it heads into the postseason.\n\nTwo days after seeing visiting Lincoln-Way East win its first-ever conference title when it prevailed on criteria for matches won with eight in a 33-33 SouthWest Suburban Conference Blue Division dual meet, the Porters responded with a quality effort in the Tom Lahey Tournament at Stagg in Palos Hills to capture their first tournament title.\n\nLockport won four championships and had four second-place finishes to score 251 points, which placed it well ahead of the runner-up Griffins, who finished with 206.5 points. Homewood-Flossmoor edged Lincoln-Way West 176-170 for third while Carl Sandburg took fifth place with 136 points and Lincoln-Way Central was next with 112 points.\n\nWinning titles for coach Josh Oster’s Porters were Keegan Roberson (25-10 at 145), Logan Swaw (25-5 at 152), Brayden Thompson (35-0 at 170) and Andrew Blackburn-Forst (26-5 at 220) while Nore Turner (19-6 at 106), David Vukobratovich (25-8 at 113), Jad Alwawi (17-14 at 126) and Paul Kadlec (26-13 at 160) all placed second. Carlos Munoz-Flores (20-7 at 132) and Logan Kaminski (18-16 at 138) were fourth and Cody Silzer (13-12 at 285) finished sixth.\n\nThompson, who’s top-ranked at 170 in 3A, continues his impressive debut season with the Porters by remaining unbeaten through 35 matches and winning his fifth tournament title in five attempts, adding to firsts at the Gable Donnybrook, the Dvorak, the Powerade and the Cheesehead. Blackburn-Forst, top-ranked at 220, is in the groove following his standout football season and added to his trip to the finals at the Dvorak with his first title of the season. Roberson, ranked third at 145, also is beginning to perform well after his successful football season and he won his first title of the season and Swaw, who’s ranked eighth at 145, also captured his first title of the season.\n\n“We had a tough one Thursday night so we had a talk afterwards and we discussed some of our shortcomings and we fixed some of those here,” Oster said. “They (East) came to wrestle Thursday and they wrestled hard and they did what they had to do to win. I’m not necessarily mad that we lost since those things happen sometimes. But there were definitely things that we could have done better and we did those better but it wasn’t perfect today.\n\n“As we say every year, it’s about advancement now. The individual advancement from regionals to sectionals, then sectionals to state and team-wise, you have to win the regional to advance to the sectional. It’s how it’s always been, next man up if someone is out and twe he next guy steps in and we’re ready and we kind of build that into the program. And we’re just looking for improvement from everyone and what we do every year is start beating kids that beat us earlier in the year.”\n\nWhile the Griffins won four-straight regional titles from 2004-07 and advanced to the dual team sectional final in 2004, they had not captured a conference title in the sport.\n\nOnly four schools had won SWSC titles with Carl Sandburg winning seven and Lockport five in the Blue Division and Lincoln-Way West winning nine and Lincoln-way Central three in the Red Division. Sandburg also won three combined titles and Lockport won the other since the conference’s initial season of 2005-06.\n\nAs a result of the week’s dual meets, there was a shakeup in Rob Sherrill’s IWCOA Class 3A rankings with DeKalb moving up a spot to first and Marist going from fifth to second following a 30-29 victory over Mount Carmel, which dropped from first to third place and Marmion Academy remained fourth.\n\nCoach Kevin Rockett’s Griffins, who had a 20-0 record going into their final dual meet against Lemont, moved up from eighth place to fifth while the Porters dropped from third place to sixth. The rest of the top-10 in the Class 3A rankings show Naperville Central in seventh, St. Charles East in eighth, Yorkville in ninth and McHenry in tenth.\n\nLincoln-Way East got titles from Dominic Adamo (17-6 at 160) and Connor Lindaur (27-4 at 195), the first championships that each won this season. Tyson Zvonar (29-5 at 120) and Jack Marion (30-3 at 152) finished second while Connor Koehler (15-7 at 126), Ari Zaeske (24-6 at 170) and Gavin Jones (28-1 at 182) all took third place. Domanic Abeja (19-8 at 145) and Alex Knaperek (21-7 at 285) were fourth while Brayden Mortell (21-14 at 113) and Alex Lizak (19-8 at 138) finished fifth.\n\n“We’re all excited about this and we know that this is the time of the year that we need to peak,” Rockett said. “And our schedule has gotten toward this end and that’s kind of how we like it. As a team I think we’re solid up and down in most weight classes and I think what makes us a pretty good dual team. At times, I think that we have to do a little bit better in a tournament setting to get more guys in championship matches and to get those points. Hopefully these two-day tournaments help us prepare for the postseason.”\n\nLeading the way for Homewood-Flossmoor were champions Deion Johnson (30-6 at 106) and Vincent Robinson (24-2 at 132). Robinson, top-ranked at 126, added to his championship at the Ironman with a second title while Johnson, ranked third at 106, also won his second tournament, with the other at Joliet Central to kick off the season. Jermaine Butler (23-6 at 138), Jaydon Robinson (24-5 at 145) and Justin Thomas (26-7 at 220) all finished second for coach Jim Sokoloski’s Vikings.\n\nLincoln-Way West was led by champion Karter Guzman (26-8 at 126), who captured his first title of the season while Anthony Sherman (24-14 at 195) placed second. Carl Sandburg, the 2020 Lahey title winners, was led by champion Kevin Zimmer (10-0 at 285), who’s ranked third at 285 and added to a title at the Illini Classic one week earlier.\n\nLincoln-Way Central had two champions, Joey Malito (35-1 at 120) and Conor Smetana (32-4 at 138). It was the third title of the season for Malito, who’s third-ranked at 120 and previously took firsts at Glenbrook South and Lincoln, while Smetana won his first title of the season. Andrew got a title from Trevor Silzer (25-1 at 113), who’s ranked seventh at 113 and added to a first-place effort at Batavia. The other finalist from the SWSC was Bradley-Bourbonnais’ AJ Mancilla (30-4 at 170), who took second place.\n\nThe only champion that wasn’t from an SWSC team was Belleville East’s Dominic Thebeau (30-1 at 182). It’s the fourth title in four finals appearances for Thebeau, who’s ranked second in 3A at 182. His other titles were at Mascoutah, Granite City and Geneseo. The top performer for Glenwood was Alex Hamrick (40-2 at 285), who lost to unbeaten Zimmer in a clash of highly-ranked heavyweights. Hamrick, ranked second at 285 in 2A won two other titles this season.\n\nCrystal Lake South’s Shane Moran (24-4 at 182) was edged 5-3 by Thebeau in the 182 finals in a clash between the second-ranked individuals in Class 3A and 2A. And\n\nHinsdale Central had one placewinner, Cody Tavoso (16-3 at 132), ranked seventh in 3A, who gave H-F’s Robinson a good battle before falling 8-7 in the 132 finals.\n\nThere were eight championship matches that were decided by two points or less, beginning with Johnson edging Turner 4-2 at 106 and Silzer claiming a 5-3 victory over Vukobratovich at 113. Guzman prevailed 2-0 over Alwawi at 126 and Vincent Robinson edged Tavoso 8-7 at 132. Then Smetana pulled out a 2-1 win over Butler at 138 and Roberson followed with a 7-6 thriller over Jaydon Robinson at 145. Later, Thebeau edged Moran 5-3 at 182 and Lindaur captured a 4-2 triumph over Sherman at 195.\n\nThompson (170) and Blackburn-Forst (220) both won their title matches by technical fall and Zimmer (285) recorded the lone fall in the final title match. Malito (120), Swaw (152) and Adamo (160) all won decisions by either five or six points to wrap up their titles.\n\nZimmer also won Lahey Tournament championships in 2019 and 2020 while Blackburn-Forst and Roberson both captured titles in 2020 and were placewinners in 2019. Adamo won a title in the event after placing second in 2020 and third in 2019. And Bolingbrook’s Joe McDermott claimed fifth place in the tournament for the third time.\n\nThompson and Blackburn-Forst tied for first in team points with 29.5 apiece while Zimmer had 29. Lindaur, Vincent Robinson, Silzer and Smetana all had 28 points with Thebeau and Roberson collecting 27.5 points with Malito rounding out the top 10 with 27 points. Lincoln-Way West’s Jase Salin (29-11), who finished third at 120, had the most match points with 42, which was one better than Vincent Robinson. Salin also had the two quickest falls, which both required just 18 seconds.\n\nThe Lahey Tournament featured the 10 members of the SWSC as well as five other schools, including three from downstate. The event is named for 2001 IWCOA hall of fame inductee Tom Lahey, who was coach at Andrew for 20 years where he won 270 duals and seven SICA titles and six regionals and coached 19 placewinners, including the first four-time Class AA champion, Joey Gilbert, Illinois’ second four-time title winner, with Providence Catholic’s Mark Ruettiger, a longtime Lincoln-Way coach, being the first.\n\nThe top three teams in the Lahey Tournament meet again on February 5 in the Class 3A Homewood-Flossmoor Regional, with Lincoln-Way Central and Andrew again in the field, and that event also includes Providence Catholic, Rich Township and Bloom Township, with the champion advancing to the IHSA dual team series.\n\nLincoln-Way East has finished third or better in all four of its tournaments, winning titles at Wheaton Warrenville South and Niles West and placing third at the Illini Classic behind Marist and No. 8 St. Charles East. This was the Porters’ first title of the season, with their previous best finishes being fourths at more-challenging competitions, the Dvorak and the Cheeshead, and they took fifth at DeKalb’s Flavin duals despite missing four top performers who were at the Powerade in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Porters hope that they have what it takes to advance to team state for the seventh time since Oster succeeded Joe Williams as coach in 2011-12. In the last six years of the dual team series, Lockport has advanced five times, winning three-straight trophies from 2015-17, with that run was capped by a state championship.\n\nWhile the Homewood-Flossmoor Regional figures to be one of the most competitive in Class 3A, several other teams in the Lahey field also will be in tough regionals in 3A.\n\nLincoln-Way West, ranked 23rd in 3A, joins Bradley-Bourbonnais and honorable mention teams Joliet West, Minooka and Moline in the Joliet West Regional. Carl Sandburg, Stagg and Bolingbrook will be at the Marist Regional. And Belleville East and Granite City join No. 25 Edwardsville at Quincy. Some of the Lahey matchups may be renewed on February 11-12 since competitors from the H-F, Joliet West and Quincy regionals will meet the qualifiers from Plainfield Central at the Granite City Sectional.\n\nHere’s a look at the champions of the Tom Lahey Tournament, as well as a breakdown of their weight classes:\n\n106 – Deion Johnson, Homewood-Flossmoor\n\nDeion Johnson was happy to be back on top of the awards stand for the first time since his tournament debut for the season on December 4, when he captured a title at Joliet Central’s McLaughlin Classic.\n\nBut it’s not like the Homewood-Flossmoor junior hasn’t accomplished anything special since then, as evidenced by his 30-6 record and number three ranking in 3A at 106 that includes seventh-place finishes at two quality competitions, the Ironman and the Powerade, as well as a third at Crown Point’s Carnahan. Johnson followed a fall with a 10-9 semifinals victory over Bradley-Bourbonnais junior Ethan Spacht before capturing the Lahey Tournament title at 106 with a 4-2 victory over Lockport junior Nore Turner.\n\n“I’m very excited, but those losses that I took at the Ironman and Powerade are still on my mind and I’m trying to work better,” Johnson said. “There were real tough people, people ranked across the nation and all of that, so it was good but I don’t really like how I lost there. I love my team. If you see how we work in the room, this wouldn’t be a surprise to you. It’s like a family, everybody clicks, and that’s what I love about this team.”\n\nTurner (19-6, tenth in 3A), whose best tournament showing had been a sixth-place finish at the Cheesehead, earned his spot as one of Lockport’s eight finalists after recording a fall in his opener and then capturing an 11-7 semifinals victory over Andrew sophomore Max Siegel (19-2, second in 3A), who entered the tournament with a 17-0 record, but also lost his next match 4-3 to Sandburg freshman Rocco Hayes (21-11) and then had to injury default in the fifth-place match to Lincoln-Way West senior Matt Soltis.\n\nSpacht (22-2, sixth in 3A), bounced back from his tough semifinals defeat to capture a 6-0 victory over Hayes to take third place. Soltis (26-12) responded to his quarterfinals loss to Turner with a major decision and a win by technical fall in the consolation bracket before falling 6-0 to Spacht, who like Soltis had won two previous tournaments.\n\n113 – Trevor Silzer, Andrew\n\nA competitor has to be feeling pretty good about how things have been going when they reach this point of the season with two tournament titles to their credit and just one overtime loss, and that’s just what Trevor Silzer has accomplished thus far .\n\nThe Andrew junior, who’s ranked seventh in Class 3A, added to a title at Batavia with a championship of a tournament named after an IWCOA hall of fame coach at his school. Silzer improved to 25-1 after claiming a 5-3 title victory at 113 over Lockport senior David Vukobratovich. The Thunderbolts’ champion earned his spot in the finals with two first-period falls, including one in 1:47 over Granite City freshman Brenden Rayl in the semifinals. His lone loss is to Lincoln-Way Central’s Joey Malito, who won the title at 120.\n\n“It does feel pretty good today,” Silzer said. “Knowing that I had tough competition and I still came out in first place, that feels good. I only have one loss to Joey Malito when I bumped up to face him in a dual. I’m just wrestling hard in the practice room and I had an ego-booster at Batavia by winning that. I have my buddy Max (Siegel), which is tough and I have Casey Griffin also, who’s a good practice partner. And I have my brother Kyle also in the room wrestling with me.”\n\nVukobratovich (25-8), ranked second in 3A with a runner-up finish in the Dvorak this season, advanced to the title mat with a pair of falls, including one in 3:05 in the semifinals over Sandburg freshman Ryan Hinger (25-8, fifth in 3A), who was coming off of a tournament title a week ago at the Illini Classic. Hinger responded to his loss in the semifinals by capturing a win by technical fall in 1:51 over Rayl (21-8) in the third-place match.\n\nLincoln-Way East freshman Brayden Mortell (21-14), who got pinned in the quarterfinals by Rayl, went 2-1 in the consolation and claimed a 17-5 major decision in the fifth-place match over Stagg sophomore Anas Ahmed (14-12), who also responded to a quarterfinal pin by Vukobratovich with a pair of wins.\n\n120 – Joey Malito, Lincoln-Way Central\n\nA week after suffering his first loss of the season to Bloomington’s Carson Nishida in the semifinals of the Illini Classic, Joey Malito was focused on not only getting back to the finals in his next tournament, but also winning his third title of the season.\n\nAnd that’s just what the 35-1 Lincoln-Way Central senior who placed third at the IWCOA finals did when he followed a win by technical fall with a pin in 1:42 in the semifinals over Andrew sophomore Casey Griffin and went on to capture the Lahey title at 120 with a 9-3 win over Lincoln-Way East freshman Tyson Zvonar, adding to title wins at Glenbrook South and Lincoln. Malito also advanced to the finals of the Lahey Tournament in 2020 but took second, losing 3-0 to the eventual state runner-up, Sandburg’s Sammie Hayes.\n\n“I’m super excited right now and I’m looking forward to regionals and the state tournament,” Malito said. “And getting down there is my big goal right now. It’s been fun since this is my last year so I’m just going out and laying it all out there and just trying to have fun and get to the podium. And we have a really good team. I just have to keep working hard at practice and giving it my all. In these type of matches, the tough one, you have to go in with the mentality that I should be there with these kids and I know I can beat them.”\n\nZvonar (29-5), who advanced to his third tournament finals and was hoping to add to a title win at Wheaton Warrenville South, earned his spot on the title mat with a pair of major decisions, including a 10-2 triumph over Belleville East junior Nick Fetters (12-5) in the semifinals. Lincoln-Way West sophomore Jase Salin (29-11) took an interesting route to the third-place match, where he avenged a quarterfinal loss to Fetters by winning 7-5 in sudden victory. Salin had the two quickest falls at 0:18 and won his final four matches.\n\nAfter suffering a loss by technical fall to Malito in the quarterfinals, Bolingbrook senior Josh Cruz (17-14) won two of his final three matches to claim fifth place after recording a fall in 4:37 over Griffin (12-7).\n\n126 – Karter Guzman, Lincoln-Way West\n\nKarter Guzman was focused on not only improving on his best showing of the season, a third at Hinsdale Central’s Whitlatch, by advancing to the 126 finals at the Lahey Tournament but he also wanted to collect his first title of the season.\n\nAnd that’s just what the Lincoln-Way West junior was able to achieve and he certainly also did so in a dramatic fashion as he improved to 26-8 after getting a takedown right before regulation time expired to capture a 2-0 victory over Lockport junior Jad Alwawi in the championship match. Guzman was the only title winner for the Warriors and one of two finalists and advanced to the title mat with a 4-0 semifinals win over Sandburg senior Kasey Kolke.\n\n“I knew that he couldn’t stay with me,” Guzman said. “I just kept going, kept pushing forward and got a shot and scored and that’s how it works. I saw that he was tired and I’m not tired, I don’t get tired, I keep pushing and I got it, and that’s what matters. It’s awesome here and I wouldn’t want to go anywhere else. Coming in as a freshman, I wasn’t the best but look where I am now, I can go places. I’m going to keep pushing forward and I want to place downstate, and that’s what matters.”\n\nAlwawi (17-14), one of eight Porters to advance to the finals, earned his spot there with a first-period fall in the quarterfinals and then claimed a 6-1 victory over Lincoln-Way East junior Connor Koehler (15-7) in the semifinals. Koehler responded to his loss to Alwawi by recording a fall in the next match and then beating Kolke (15-14) 8-2 to finish third.\n\nHomewood-Flossmoor senior Carter Maclin claimed fifth place at 126 with a 16-3 major decision over Andrew junior Keeghan Oreilly.\n\n132 – Vincent Robinson, Homewood-Flossmoor\n\nIt had been awhile since Vincent Robinson had been on top of the awards stand. And even though winning a title at the Lahey Tournament is a big deal for most individuals, when you get the first place medal at the Ironman and finish just ahead of some of Illinois’ best there, then the bar has been set very high.\n\nFor the first time since December 11, when the Homewood-Flossmoor junior placed first at 126 with Washington’s Kannon Webster and Mount Carmel’s Sergio Lemley getting the next two medals, Robinson has been focused on not only doing what he achieved in 2020, which was competing in an IHSA title match, but he intends to be on top of the awards stand this year in Champaign. The top-ranked individual in 3A at 126 improved to 24-2 after claiming the Lahey Tournament title at 132 by prevailing 8-7 in a struggle with Hinsdale Central junior Cody Tavoso to cap a day where he recorded falls in his other three matches, including a pin in 2:55 in the semifinals over Granite City junior Dylan Boyd.\n\n“We’ve just started locking in since we already know that the state series is coming up,” Robinson said. “So we just go harder at practice and pushing ourselves more knowing what we need to do to get ready for state. Every time we go up against somebody that’s stronger competition, we just get better because we learn from that. Every match that we wrestle is a learning experience, win or lose. Today in my finals match I was disappointed because it was too close for me. He gave me a little bit of trouble and he was bigger than me, so I’m like, it’s cool, since I’m going back down to 126 for state, so we’re going to get our state title there.”\n\nTavaso (16-3, seventh at 132), who placed third in the IWCOA and was sixth in 2020 in the IHSA, had a title win at his own Whitlatch and took third at Batavia. He opened with a fall and won a major decision before recording a fall in 2:51 in the semifinals over Glenwood sophomore John Ben Maduena. In the third-place match, Boyd (24-6) won by injury default over Lockport junior Carlos Munoz-Flores (20-6, third at 132), a runner-up at the Gable Donnybrook, lost to Boyd in the quarterfinals and then had three-straight falls.\n\nBolingbrook senior Joe McDermott (22-9), who won titles at Hinsdale South and Berwyn/Cicero Morton, claimed fifth place for the third time in the tournament after capturing a 6-0 decision over Maduena (25-14, tenth in 2A), who has won a title and been in three finals this season.\n\n138 – Conor Smetana, Lincoln-Way Central\n\nConor Smetana seemed to be hobbling around a bit after walking off of the championship mat at 138 in the Lahey Invitational, which didn’t seem to bother him a whole lot after what he had just accomplished.\n\nAnd that was the Lincoln-Way Central senior not only winning his first title of the season in his fourth trip to the finals but also doing so in an event that he competed in the finals as a freshman. Smetana (32-4, eighth at 132) won a 2-1 decision over Homewood-Flossmoor junior Jermaine Butler in the 138 finals that was set up by three-straight first period falls, which included one in 1:58 in the semifinals over Lockport junior Logan Kaminski. Smetana placed second at Glenbrook South, Lincoln and the Illini Classic this season.\n\n“I’ve had a few tough matches and I’ve been working on it in the practice room and I’m just getting better every day,” Smetana said. “It’s just great to have the energy in the room with the coaches always pushing you and your teammates always getting on you to get better every day. I was 0-3 in finals and I used that as motivation. I haven’t wrestled since freshman year so getting back in the room just messed with my head so I knew that I had to work 10 times harder than everyone in the room to get here.”\n\nButler (23-6), who was appearing in his first tournament finals since early December at Joliet Central and was seeking his initial title, won his first two matches by technical fall and then captured a 5-3 semifinals victory over Belleville East junior Warren Zeisset (19-7). In the third-place match between the two individuals who fell in the semifinals, Zeisset recorded a fall in 4:25 to give him his best tournament finish of the season, something that Kaminski also achieved.\n\nAfter falling 3-2 in the quarterfinals to Kaminski, Lincoln-Way East freshman Alex Lizak (19-8) recorded three falls in four consolation matches to claim fifth place with a pin in 1:43 over Granite City freshman Braden Kelly (19-16), who responded to a quarterfinal loss to Butler with a fall and major decision before dropping his last two matches.\n\n145 – Keegan Roberson, Lockport\n\nKeegan Roberson admitted that it took him a while to bounce back from an extended football season in which he was a starting receiver for a Porters squad that went 13-1 and captured the Class 8A title for the school’s third championship in the sport and its first since 2003.\n\nAfter facing quality competition at the Gable Donnybrook, Powerade and Cheesehead, where he placed between fifth and seventh, the senior who was second in the IWCOA hopes to make a deep run in two more state series, the individual finals and dual team state. Roberson (25-10, third at 145) got falls in his first two matches and won by technical fall in the semifinals over Lincoln-Way East sophomore Domanic Abeja. Then in the 145 finals, he captured a 7-6 win over Homewood-Flossmoor sophomore Jaydon Robinson.\n\n“Coming out of football and missing the first couple of weeks, I was definitely not where I needed to be with my gas tank,” Roberson said. “So we’ve been working a lot harder in the room. In the first couple weeks of practice we were slacking off and messing around the whole entire time, kind of like knowing that we were going to win. But we got smacked in the mouth and we needed that. Now we’re working harder and harder and the coaches are definitely getting on us now. At first I was going to quit football, but then they were like do it since you’re not going to get worse at wrestling. So I took the shot and we won and I’m definitely glad I did since I had some good catches in the state game.”\n\nRobinson (24-5, fourth at 145) advanced to his second final but wasn’t able to add to his early-season title win at Joliet Central. After recording a fall in the quarterfinals, Robinson claimed an 11-3 major decision in the semifinals over Glenwood junior Aden Byal (33-6). The two individuals who fell in the semifinals met up for third place with Byal capturing a 9-2 win to give him his fourth-straight tournament where he finished third or better while Abeja has placed fourth or better in all four of his tournaments.\n\nTwo juniors named Tyler met up in the fifth place match with Bradley-Bourbonnais’ Tyler Starr (26-12) getting the better of Lincoln-Way West’s Tyler Mansker (16-20) by an 8-1 score. Starr bounced back from a 4-3 quarterfinal loss to Byal with a pin and a win by technical fall while Mansker responded to a quarterfinal loss to Abeja with two falls.\n\n152 – Logan Swaw, Lockport\n\nAfter turning in a fourth-place showing at the Dvorak, people started to take notice of Logan Swaw and now following a good finals win at 152 over a quality opponent in the Lahey Tournament, the Lockport junior looks to build on his first tournament championship.\n\nSwaw, who’s ranked eighth at 145, improved to 25-5 after claiming a 7-0 victory on the 152 title mat over Lincoln-Way East senior Jack Marion (30-3), who’s ranked fifth at 152 with title wins at Niles West and Wheaton Warrenville South to go with a second at the Illini Classic. Swaw earned his spot in the finals with a fall in the quarterfinals and a 7-0 victory in the semifinals over Stagg sophomore Luke Barham.\n\n“I’ve got some of the best training partners in the state and we’re working hard every day,” Swaw said. “Keegan (Roberson) is the weight below me and I’m with him every day. Our coaches told us that we needed to pick it up and we responded and won this tournament by a lot. We have goals, we want to win the state duals and we have to achieve those. So we’re going to turn it up this week and see where we’re at at the end of the year.”\n\nMarion, whose only previous losses were to Shepard’s Damari Reed (No. 1 at 152) and H-F’s Jaydon Robinson (No. 4 at 145) advanced to his fourth-straight tournament finals after getting a first-minute fall in the quarterfinals and then claiming a 12-2 major decision in the semifinals over Lincoln-Way West senior Cameron Knepper. The two individuals who fell in the semifinals scored decisive wins in their next matches to earn a spot on the third-place mat, where Knepper (28-13) claimed a 5-0 victory over Barham (15-12).\n\nIn the fifth-place match, a pair of sophomores met up with Lincoln-Way Central’s Tim Key (23-16) recording a fall in 4:38 over Bradley-Bourbonnais’ Zach Anderson (17-17). After Key fell 5-2 to Barham in the quarterfinals, he got a win by sudden victory and a fall while Anderson advanced with two falls before the pair fell to the third-place competitors.\n\n160 – Dominic Adamo, Lincoln-Way East\n\nBy most standards, Dominic Adamo has been having a successful season, advancing to two tournament finals before taking fourth place in a tough bracket the previous week at the Illini Classic.\n\nBut everything finally came together for the Lincoln-Way East senior when he improved on second-place finishes at Niles West and Wheaton Warrenville South by winning his first-ever title, finishing first at 160 at the Lahey Tournament after capturing a 6-0 win over Lockport senior Paul Kadlec. Adamo (17-6) followed a fall and 5-0 decision with a win by technical fall in the semifinals over Stagg’s Ibrahim Hamideh. This is also the third-straight time that Adamo has placed in the event, taking third in 2019 and second in 2020.\n\n“This should be like regionals so I’m expecting to see all of these guys again,” Adamo said. “This is my first title of the year and I had a couple of close calls. Actually, this is the first title of my high school career, since I’ve always come in second or third. This was really unexpected that all of the freshmen would be stepping up big this year. All of our heavier weights were lighter when I was younger and now we’re all there. Being a younger guy and then growing up and then seeing the younger guys come in, it’s awesome.”\n\nKadlec (26-13, tenth at 160), who was sixth at the IWCOA meet and took fourth at the Dvorak, reached the finals of a tournament for the first time this season after recording falls in both the quarterfinals and semifinals, getting a pin in 3:05 over Carl Sandburg junior John Thompson to advance to the 160 title mat.\n\nBolingbrook junior Chris Lozano (13-11), who lost by fall in the quarterfinals to Kadlec, recorded three-straight falls before winning 7-1 in the third place match over Lincoln-Way West freshman Chris Yirsa (10-7), who was pinned by Hamideh in the quarterfinals but bounced back with two falls and a decision. Yirsa was seeded 13th but improved nine spots to finish fourth. In the fifth-place match that featured the two individuals who lost in the semifinals, Thompson (3-2) won 10-8 by sudden victory over Hamideh.\n\n170 – Brayden Thompson, Lockport\n\nIt’s safe to say that Brayden Thompson wasn’t wasting any time on the mat as he used three falls and a win by technical to capture the Lahey Tournament title at 170, which was his fifth championship of the season.\n\nThompson, who’s top-ranked ranked at 170 and improved to 35-0, defeated Bradley-Bourbonnais sophomore AJ Mancilla in the finals by technical fall to add to championships that he’s won at the Gable Donnybrook, the Dvorak, the Powerade and the Cheesehead. The junior, who’s competing in his first season for Lockport after placing third in the IHSA while at Montini Catholic in 2020, earned his fifth trip to the finals when he recorded a fall in 1:28 over Lincoln-Way East junior Ari Zaeske in the semifinals.\n\n“I’m on the hunt for that first state title, that’s the goal right now,” Thompson said. “It’s not only about just pushing myself but it’s also about pushing everyone else on this team and picking them up when they’re down, maybe after a loss. It’s great here, they’re very welcoming. I’ve gotten to know them very well and they’re almost like brothers to me now. So anything that I can give them advice on, they really take it in and they listen to me. It’s just about getting better and having fun.”\n\nMancilla (30-4), ranked ninth in 3A, entered with good credentials after finishing third or better in all three of his tournaments and advanced to his third finals this season. After winning a 6-4 decision over Lincoln-Way West freshman Nate Elsner in the quarterfinals, he earned a spot opposite of Thompson on the title mat following an 8-1 semifinals victory over Homewood-Flossmoor senior Romeo Williams.\n\nAfter the losers in the semifinals both recorded falls in the consolation bracket, they advanced to the third-place mat where Zaeske (24-6) recorded a fall in 2:37 over Williams (21-6). It was the third third-place finish for Zaeske this season. In the fifth-place match, Elsner (10-6) captured a 7-3 decision over Andrew junior Mike Barberi (18-9), who was seeded 15th but improved nine spots to finish sixth.\n\n182 – Dominic Thebeau, Belleville East\n\nWhile Dominic Thebeau realized that he faced a big challenge in the the 182 title match at the Lahey Tournament, the junior demonstrated why he’s won titles in all four of his tournaments and been beaten just once this season, a one-point decision in his initial match.\n\nThe Belleville East junior beat Crystal Lake South senior Shane Moran 5-3 in the finals in a clash of the second-ranked individuals in Class 3A and 2A. Thebeau (30-1) added to title wins at Mascoutah, Granite City and Geneseo while Moran (24-4), who was fourth at the IWCOA and sixth at the IHSA in 2020, had his best tournament showing of the season. Thebeau followed a fall with a win by technical fall in the semifinals over Lincoln-Way East senior Gavin Jones, who suffered his first loss of the season.\n\n“I just stuck to the game plan because I knew that I had the ability to win,” Thebeau said. “So it was really just about following through on what my coach teaches me and stuff like that. I knew that if I had good cardio that no one would be able to stop me from taking them down and no one in the state can ride me so I feel pretty confident in my abilities. At the end of the day, this is an individual sport so if you want to be great, you have to put it on yourself. I feel like a champion right now so as long as I stick to my game plan, I should be fine. My eyes are on a state championship and it doesn’t matter how I get there, as long as I do my best, and I know that I will.”\n\nMoran followed up on two falls with a 7-1 semifinals victory over Homewood-Flossmoor senior Haku Watson-Castro. The semifinals losers advanced to the third-place mat with Jones (28-1, sixth at 182) winning by major decision and Watson-Castro (23-8) by sudden victory and then Jones, who took first at Niles West and the Illini Classic, won a 7-6 decision to finish third.\n\nThe competitors who faced off for fifth place actually met one another in the opening round. Carl Sandburg junior Max Pitura (18-13) pinned Stagg senior Mark Jones (15-11) in 3:09 in the opening round of the competition. But after Mark Jones lost to Gavin Jones and Pitura was edged in sudden victory by Watson-Castro, the two met again for fifth with Pitura again winning by fall, this time in 2:35.\n\n195 – Connor Lindaur, Lincoln-Way East\n\nAfter placing third at Niles West early in the season and then fifth just one week earlier at the Illini Classic, Connor Lindaur was hopeful that he could not only earn his first finals appearance of the season but also end up with a title at 195 at the Lahey Tournament.\n\nAnd that’s just what the Lincoln-Way East senior accomplished when he claimed a 4-2 triumph over Lincoln-Way West junior Anthony Sherman in the championship match. Lindaur, who improved to 27-4, joined classmate Dominic Adamo as one of the Griffins’ two champions as he earned his spot on the title mat with a pair of falls, including one in the semifinals in 3:05 over Homewood-Flossmoor senior Rahmal Graham.\n\n“Honestly, this makes me feel great,” Lindaur said. “I had three matches and three wins and the last one did kind of make me realize that I need to put in a little more work. I’ve wrestled that kid a few times and he came closer to beating me. We were able to beat Lockport and that felt incredible and there was a lot of celebration. Having a really strong team motivates each of us to do better. We want to match with them and we don’t want to disappoint our team. I like how our season is looking and how our regionals are looking, so I’m excited.”\n\nSherman (24-14), whose best previous tournament showing was a sixth-place effort at Hinsdale Central, won his first two matches by fall and then claimed an 8-2 decision in the semifinals over Andrew senior Jack Cronin. Lincoln-Way Central senior Nathan Jarres (21-15) got pinned in the quarterfinals by Graham (19-12) but after recording a pair of falls in the consolation bracket, Jarres met up with Graham again, this time for third place, and Jarres recorded another fall, in 3:40 to finish third.\n\nIn the fifth-place match, Cronin (18-7) and Crystal Lake South’s KC Brichta Bachar (11-11) met for the second time. In the quarterfinals, Cronin claimed an 8-0 major decision but in the pair’s next meeting for fifth, Cronin prevailed again, but this time only by a 4-3 score.\n\n220 – Andrew Blackburn-Forst, Lockport\n\nAfter being one of the top players on a state championship football team in the fall, Andrew Blackburn-Forst wouldn’t mind seeing a similar scenario play out in the current season with the bonus being that he could receive a different type of honor for once again being one of the best at his sport in Illinois.\n\nThe Lockport senior had accomplished a lot thus far with a second at the Dvorak, fifth at the Powerade and third at the Cheesehead and a No. 1 ranking in 3A after going unbeaten against Illinois competitors. He reached the top of the awards stand for the first time this season at the Lahey Tournament, a feat that he’d like to repeat in upcoming weeks. The IWCOA champion and fifth-place finisher in the IHSA in 2020 improved to 26-5 after recording two falls and getting a win by technical fall in 5:36 over Homewood-Flossmoor senior Justin Thomas in the 220 finals. It was the third time that Blackburn-Forst placed in the tournament and was his second title, with the other in 2020.\n\n“I think we improved a lot since Thursday when we had a few guys out, but those things happen,” Blackburn-Forst said. “From last year to now, East has made a lot of progress with a lot of the freshmen and sophomores coming in and H-F is much-improved from other years. I feel like as we get deeper into the season and going into regionals now, that everyone is starting to dot the i’s and cross the t’s. We’re making our technique perfect and getting stronger every day and the extra week of practice is going to make us better.”\n\nThomas (26-7), ranked fifth in 3A with two titles and three finals to his credit, won two matches by fall and claimed a 7-3 semifinals victory over Lincoln-Way Central senior Braeden Barrett (34-6), who had reached two tournament finals. The third-place match featured the losers of the two semifinals as Lincoln-Way West senior Michael Sneed (25-8), who fell in 0:46 to Blackburn-Forst, responded with two decisions, including a 4-2 victory over Barrett to claim third place, which was his best tournament finish of the season.\n\nGlenwood junior Jaidyn Lee (23-8) was pinned by Sneed in the quarterfinals and Carl Sandburg senior Yazan Arafeh (19-15) lost by fall to Barrett in the same round but the pair responded with falls in their first consolation match before Barrett and Sneed sent them to the fifth-place match, where Lee recorded a fall in 2:42 to finish fifth.\n\n285 – Kevin Zimmer, Carl Sandburg\n\nNot many individuals get the opportunity to win a tournament three times, and even fewer pull off that feat when they only get three opportunities to win championships, but that’s just what Kevin Zimmer accomplished on Saturday at the Lahey Tournament.\n\nThe Carl Sandburg senior, a 2020 IHSA runner-up who is ranked third in 3A, followed up on a tournament title at the Illini Classic with a second championship a week later and improved to 10-0 since returning from injury after recording a fall in his first match, following that with a 13-3 major decision over Lincoln-Way East senior Alex Knaperek in the semifinals and then recording a fall in 1:46 over Glenwood junior Alex Hamrick in the 285 title match to capture his third Lahey Tournament championship.\n\n“I’m excited for what the future holds,” Zimmer said. “I’m stoked for it, especially with state coming up. That’s the main goal, it’s not this bracket board, it’s the big one when you get to stand on the podium down at Champaign. That’s the goal at the end of the tunnel.”\n\nHamrick (40-2), who took third in the IWCOA and is ranked second in 2A with titles at Glenwood and Mahomet-Seymour and just one other loss early in the season to Glenbard North’s No. 2 Paulie Robertson at Conant, earned his third trip to a tournament finals with a fall and a 6-3 semifinals victory over Lincoln-Way West senior Jake Ziemniarski. The two individuals who lost in the semifinals bounced back with consolation wins and Ziemniarski (26-11, eighth in 3A) won a 3-2 decision over Knaperek (21-7) to place third.\n\nCrystal Lake South sophomore Andy Burburija (24-8, seventh in 2A) fell 6-0 to Knaperek in the quarterfinals and Lockport junior Cody Silzer (13-12) lost 3-2 on a tiebreaker to Ziemniarski in the same round. After both recorded pins, they fell in the next round and met for fifth with Burburija prevailing 4-2 by sudden victory to claim his best finish.\n\nFROM THE IWCOA: If you are enjoying these articles, please consider a small donation to the IWCOA so that we can continue funding feature stories for our website and social media.

Thank you!\n\nBy Gary Larsen\n\nFor the IWCOA\n\nThere will be no IHSA team dual team state finals for girls this year but if there were, you can bet Oak Park and River Forest would be one of Illinois’ favorites to make a run at a team state title.\n\nThe host Huskies won their second big-tournament title in as many weeks after out-pointing second-place Andrew 182-118 in Saturday’s 26-team OPRF Girls Invitational Tournament.\n\nOak Park won a 26-team tournament at Hoffman Estates one week earlier, 187-183 over second-place Schaumburg.\n\n“I’m pretty pleased with how things are progressing this season,” Huskies coach Fred Arkin said. “It’s been a good couple of weeks.”\n\nThree OPRF wrestlers scaled the highest step on the awards stand Saturday, in Bentley Hills (100), Tiffany White (190), and Sarah Epshtein (235). White also won an individual title at Hoffman Estates.\n\nArkin’s Huskies also got seconds from Camila Neuman (110), Maria Diaz (120), Keydy Peralta (145) and Tamera Erving (235), with Erving placing as a non-scoring wrestler for Oak Park, which also got fourths from Ana Banuelos (105), Bella Tyma (135) and Megan Barajas (155).\n\nArkin is happy with his girls’ on-mat accomplishments thus far but he’s even happier about what they’ve shown him during trying times.\n\n“I’m so proud of the way these girls have hung together through some incredible circumstances,” he said. “We were on our way to the IWCOA state tournament in March of 2020 when COVID hit and the tournament was shut down. Since that time, these girls have stuck together, worked hard and done workouts on zoom from basements and bedrooms and back porches.\n\n“We’ve been in parks, parking lots — you name it, we’ve done whatever we could to keep them together as a team and they’ve all been there and participated. They’ve worked hard, haven’t complained and it’s been heartening to see it, for them to come together under circumstances that have really been onerous.”\n\nOf the 26 teams present, six had a double-digit number of wrestlers entered in the tournament and all of those teams predictably finished among the top eight. Oak Park entered 13 wrestlers and Andrew entered 11 into the tournament.\n\nMorton’s 11 wrestlers finished third (110 points), Homewood-Flossmoor’s 12 wrestlers place fourth (96), and Glenbard West (80) placed fifth with 10 wrestlers.\n\nLarkin placed sixth with four wrestlers entered, Lane Tech placed seventh with four wrestlers, and Wilmington’s four wrestlers brought home an eight-place finish.\n\nYorkville only entered two wrestlers in the tournament and both won titles, in Yami Aguirre (115) and Natasha Markoutsis (130).\n\nAndrew’s second-place finish came thanks to a title win from Kate Cygan (125), a third from Janae Vargas (140), fourths from Charlianne Johnson (120) and Alyssa Keane (130), fifths from Sophia Figueroa (110) and Lana Shualbi (135), and sixths from Ava McGuire (145) and Emma Akpan (170).\n\n2022 OPRF Invitational champions stories:\n\n100 – Bentley Hills, Oak Park and River Forest\n\nOnly two wrestlers were entered into the bracket at 100, in Morton’s Ariana Diaz and OPRF’s Bentley Hills, so the two squared off in a best-of-three-match showdown for the title.\n\nHills posted a pair of falls against Diaz to improve to 12-3 on the season.\n\nHills placed third at the 26-team Hoffman Estates Invitational one week prior with a pin in her third-place match over Gracie Pattison of Bismarck-Henning.\n\n“Bentley has been awesome,” OPRF coach Fred Arkin said. “She started out as a manager for the boys team her freshman year and we convinced her to try wrestling her sophomore year.\n\n“She’s been working hard, developing strength, and she has really good agility and quickness. She can get physical, she’s not afraid of anybody, she has a good leg attack and she can be a hammer on top.”\n\nHills won both matches against Diaz (9-7) by fall to take the best-of-three pairing.\n\n105 – Gabriella Gomez, Glenbard North\n\nA pair of top freshmen met on the title mat at 105 and when it was over, Glenbard North’s Gabriella Gomez (2-0) had earned a 17-10 decision over Burlington Central’s Victoria Macias (15-2).\n\nGomez was the Panthers’ lone entrant in the tournament and is currently ranked No. 9 in the country at 100 pounds by USA Wrestling.\n\nGomez pinned Hubbard’s Diana Cervantes (2-1) in their semifinal match while Macias won by tech fall in her semifinal against Oak Park’s Ana Banuelos (4-7).\n\n110 – Ariana Flores, Evanston\n\nEvanston junior Ariana Flores was a dancer a few years ago, when she was introduced to wrestling and needed to make a choice. For her, the choice was easy.\n\n“I gave up dancing,” Flores said. “I did not enjoy it whatsoever.”\n\nThat decision set Flores on a path that most recently resulted in her beating a previously unbeaten wrestler and winning a tournament title. Flores (9-3) had a takedown and a reversal before posting a third-period pin of OPRF’s Camila Neuman (16-1) in the finals at 110.\n\nFlores didn’t know Neuman was unbeaten, or that she had won a tournament title at Hoffman Estates one week earlier.\n\n“Going into matches I try not to focus on the other person, and just wrestle to the best of my ability,” Flores said. “I was kind of following through with everything I’ve been practicing and stick to my basics and what I can do.”\n\nFlores posted three pins on the day in winning her title, while Neuman had a pin and a major decision to reach the finals. Joliet Catholic’s Grace Laird placed third with a fall against Maine East’s Amy Villegas.\n\nFlores has gone from a shy freshman to a junior captain for Evanston’s girls program and coach Rudy Salinas.\n\n“She has put in a lot of hard work and she’s a good ambassador for us, as a captain,” Salinas said. “It was a good breakthrough weekend for her in terms of getting some recognition but we’ve also reminded her that the goal this year was not to win the Oak Park tournament. She has loftier goals and she’s keeping her eyes on the prize.”\n\nThat prize is obviously a place on the awards stand at this year’s inaugural IHSA girls state tournament in February. And after topping a wrestler in Neuman, who placed fifth at 101 at last year’s IWCOA state finals, Flores is on track.\n\n“My mindset has changed this year. It’s become much more of a positive mindset,” Flores said. “And last year I wasn’t always the person to take the first shot but this year my mindset is to be the shooter, get the first move, get the first takedown. I’ve been improving but I want to improve a lot more with that.\n\n“(Salinas) always says wrestling helps build and show character and I think that’s something I’ve seen in myself. My confidence has grown as a wrestler and I can see myself become a better and more well-rounded person. It’s a hard sport but it does push you to be better and have a better mindset.”\n\n115 – Yami Aguirre, Yorkville\n\nA stacked weight class at 115 featured four semifinalists with a cumulative season record of 62-12.The lone wrestler left standing atop the awards stand was Yorkville sophomore Yami Aguirre (14-2).\n\nAguirre opened with a win by fall over OPRF’s Andrea Munoz (12-7) in their quarterfinal match, then won 3-1 in overtime against previously unbeaten Hannah Suboni-Kaufman (18-1) of Maine East in a semifinal match.\n\n“I didn’t know she was undefeated because I try not to look at my bracket so I don’t get intimidated,” Aguirre said. “My coach just told me I’d be wrestling a tough girl but I had no clue she was undefeated. I don’t think I’ve ever beaten someone who was undefeated this year. She was tough and it was a really good match.”\n\nAguirre and Suboni-Kaufman were tied 1-1 after three periods.\n\n“I was trying to go for shots the whole match but she kept getting me in a headlock so I couldn’t finish my shots,” Aguirre said. “Neither one of us could finish our shots.”\n\nAguirre escaped twice to get the 3-1 overtime win, advancing to the finals against Morton’s Neida Arreola (10-7). Arreola opened with a pair of pins before reaching the finals with a 4-2 semifinal win over Lane Tech’s second-seeded Sharon Moreno (19-6).\n\nAguirre said she felt more in control of her finals match, where she topped Arreola by 7-0 decision. Suboni-Kaufman bounced back to take third, pinning Moreno in the second period.\n\nThe sophomore Aguirre didn’t wrestle last year due to COVID and although she’s in her first full year of high school wrestling, she’s been in the sport for eight years.\n\n“I’d go and support my brothers at practice,” Aguirre said. “One day I just got tired of sitting there and decided to get on the mat. I liked being able to beat up on boys and not get in trouble for it.”\n\nAguirre’s only two losses this year came to Ashlyn Strenz of Sandwich and Lincoln-Way Central’s Gracie Guarino, and those losses taught her arguably the sport’s most important lesson.\n\n“I need to be more confident. I tend to get a bit intimidated and that can’t happen,” Aguirre said. “I need to worry about myself and not be worried about anyone else, or overthinking it. I’m looking forward to wrestling those girls again.”\n\nCoach Kevin Roth agrees with Aguirre’s perspective moving forward.\n\n“When she’s confident, she’s pretty unstoppable,” Roth said. “She wrestled really well. She knows her stuff and she looked pretty dominant all day. She has a good shot, she’s not afraid to shoot, and she’s aggressive.”\n\n120 – Leilany De Leon-Martinez, Morton\n\nWhen Morton junior Leilany De Leon-Martinez develops the consistent ability to truly open up in a match, she’s going to be a handful for opponents who line up against her.\n\nHeck, she’s already a handful.\n\n“She’s a very talented young lady,” Morton coach Joe Helton said.\n\nDe Leon-Martinez won an OPRF title at 120 pounds when she posted an 11-0 decision against a tough wrestler in OPRF’s top-seeded Maria Diaz (14-5). De Leon-Martinez improved to 12-2 on the year in winning her first tournament title. She also placed second in a tournament at Maine East this season.\n\nThe thing is, De Leon-Martinez is not quite as comfortable taking shots as she’d like to be. She did manage to find a comfort zone offensively earlier this year, but that was when the friendly junior discovered that if she talked to her opponents or the referee during a match — just your basic chit-chat — only then was she able to relax enough to engage her own offense.\n\n“The only time I felt comfortable was talking before shooting,” De Leon-Martinez laughed. “But I got in trouble for doing that.”\n\nDiscouraged from talking during her matches, De Leon-Martinez had to instead rely on being a more defensive, counter wrestler. During her title match against Diaz, she twice scored off Diaz’s shots and turned her each time in building a lead.\n\n“I saw Maria wrestle on her Instagram and she’s really good,” De Leon-Martinez said. “I didn’t feel comfortable shooting so it was mostly sprawling. She shot, I got (behind her), and then I got back points.”\n\nDe Leon-Martinez opened the tournament with a decision win, then a pin in her semifinal match against Andrew’s Charlianne Johnson. Diaz posted two pins to reach the finals, including a semifinal pin against Morton’s Ximena Juarez (13-5). Juarez then pinned Johnson on the third-place mat.\n\nAnd it was one of the friendliest wrestlers in the gym who took home the top prize.\n\n“She’s just a selfless person and cares about each of her teammates,” Helton said. “She has the ability to go out carefree and wrestle to the best of her ability. She did very well against her opponents and she continues to surprise people with her abilities each week.”\n\n125 – Kate Cygan, Andrew\n\nFour pins and a tournament title.\n\nThat’s what Andrew junior Katherine Cygan earned Saturday but simplifying her day down to such simple math doesn’t do justice to what the Thunderbolts’ 125-pounder did in Oak Park: none of her four opponents even survived to the second period against her.\n\nCygan is proof of something that’s always been true in wrestling — that the most important part of any wrestler is the six inches of space between their ears, where either confidence or nervousness dictates everything.\n\n“When I’m nervous I’m too hesitant and I’m second-guessing myself,” Cygan said. “When I’m more confident, I just go for it. I think about what I need to do and I just do it.”\n\nAndrew coach Demeri Pajic has watched Cygan’s growth firsthand.\n\n“I’ve seen a full 180 of her confidence this year,” Pajic said. “In her second match she got taken down and I didn’t see any fear in her. She got a reversal and a pin, right away. She looked confident and just went out there tough, and mean, like nobody was going to stop her. Something clicked for her.”\n\nCygan’s pins came at the :40, :37, 1:42, and 1:50 marks of her four matches, capped by her pin of Lane Tech’s Uyen Le on the title mat. Ask Cygan about her day and it turns out she was just looking for redemption.\n\n“I was a little nervous because Thursday we had a meet and I didn’t do very well. I was worried about having the same outcome,” Cygan said. “But it turned out the opposite.”\n\nCygan wasn’t able to wrestle last year due to injury and she’s looking forward to participating inthe inaugural IHSA girls state tournament in February.\n\n“I was really excited to come into this year,” Cygan said. “I am so excited. I can’t wait.”\n\n“I started wrestling because I wanted to get tough. People might see me and think ‘she’s so nice’ but I have a tough side and I wanted to show that with wrestling. So it’s been a good outlet.”\n\n130 – Natasha Markoutsis, Yorkville\n\nReturning high school wrestlers who placed second at the state finals the previous year have a unique perspective, having come so close to winning the state’s top prize before falling just short.\n\nYorkville senior Natasha Markoutsis was an IWCOA state runner-up at 132 last year, and she has taken that unique perspective to toss a shovelful of coal into the blast furnace of her motivation.\n\n“For sure I used that as motivation,” she said. “I just want to keep getting better and I want to be number one so bad. Taking second last year was an awakening for me that I’m not the best yet and I have things that I have to work out. There are people out there who work harder than me but if I keep working harder to be the best I can be, I can live with whatever happens.”\n\nMarkoutsis (16-0) won the Oak Park title at 130 with a second-period fall in the finals against Morton’s Karla Topete (14-3), but in a tough bracket she had to first win her semifinal match over Coal City’s Carly Ford (9-2), who placed third in state at 132 last year.\n\nMarkoutsis won by fall in the third period against Ford. Yorkville only brought two wrestlers to the tournament and with her fall against Topete, Markoutsis joined teammate Yami Aguirre (115) as an Oak Park champion.\n\n“She knows her stuff and she just goes to work,” coach Kevin Roth said of Markoutsis. “She’s fun to watch and she’s a student of the sport. Where guys can get by on their strength, girls don’t always have that so they have to be good technicians. And I love Natasha’s wrestling on the mat. When she gets you down on the mat, she’s going to ride you out.”\n\nMarkoutsis is currently ranked No. 10 nationally at 132 by USA Wrestling. But even a nationally-ranked wrestler can have a scare, and Markoutsis got a wakeup call in her title match against Topete.\n\n“I almost got put on my back,” Markoutsis said. “(Topete) had a lot of arm strength, there was a lot of scrambling, and she knew her offense and defense. She was a really good opponent and I’m glad I got to wrestle her.”\n\n135 – Al Ghala Mariam Al-Radi, Niles West\n\nOdds are, no one has taken the path into Illinois high school wrestling that Niles West junior Al Ghala Mariam Al-Radi has traveled.\n\nBorn in Syria, Al-Radi and her family moved to Jordan before arriving in the U.S. when she was in sixth grade, as the oldest of six children. She began wrestling her freshman year for coach Anthony Genovesi and she hit the ground running.\n\n“We took her down to the IWCOA tournament last year and she took fourth,” Genovesi said. “This year she only has one loss. She’s a strong kid and now she’s learning how to actually wrestle. She’s more focused, trying to improve her technique, and she’s working harder. It’s been really nice to see. She’s getting better and she’s a tough kid.”\n\nAl-Radi (11-1) took the crown at 135 with a tech fall win over Morton’s Faith Comas (11-3). Top-seeded Al-Radi posted two wins by fall to reach the finals. The formerly raw freshman is striving for seasoning in her junior year.\n\n“Freshman year I really only knew a couple moves. Now I’m focusing more on the techniques and moves, using my coaches feedback more often and I am listening way better on the mat,” Al-Radi said. “I didn’t like taking fourth place at the state tournament last year so I am very excited to be a part of the tournament this year.”\n\nAl-Radi has not hesitated to get involved in athletics at Niles West and wrestling fills a unique need.\n\n“I’ve done diving, wrestling, and water polo. I like being a part of a team,” Al-Radi said. “But I like wrestling because I focus more on myself and improving my own skills. It is easier to depend on myself and know that I can win individually.”\n\nComas reached the finals with a pair of pins, over Evanston’s Carmen Tracey-Amoroso and Lane Tech’s Noemi Marchan, who finished third with a 2-1 decision over OPRF’s Bella Tyma.\n\n140 – Attalia Watson-Castro, Homewood-Flossmoor\n\nAfter opening the tournament with two byes, it was past noon in Oak Park before Homewood-Flossmoor’s Attalia Watson-Castro wrestled her first match, a semifinal against Niles West’s Aiazah Khan.\n\n“That match had to be a ‘go’ match for me, since I didn’t have as many matches as the other girls,” Watson-Castro said.\n\n‘Go’ she did, winning by fall in the first period to set up her title match at 140 against previously unbeaten Ari Navarro (17-1) of Glenbard West, who had won an individual title one week prior at Hoffman Estates.\n\nWatson-Castro (7-2) made it count, winning by fall over Navarro at the 1:57 mark of their finals match.\n\n“She was stronger and taller so I had to adjust what I was going to do,” Watson-Castro said “The goal was to get a takedown in the first fifteen seconds, get three takedowns, and work my turns.”\n\nThe game plan worked for the junior Watson-Castro, who has battled injury this season and whose coach believes the following: “She is poised to dominate the state series if she can stay healthy,” Homewood-Flossmoor coach Scott Aronson said.\n\nWatson-Castro also won an individual title at this year’s 25-team Normal Community Invitational. She didn’t wrestle her freshman year due to COVID and focused on Fargo last year.\n\nThis year, she’s ready to make a run at a state title, at the inaugural IHSA state tournament for girls in February.\n\n“This is my ninth year wrestling,” Watson-Castro said. “It’s going to be fun getting a chance to win a state title. The thing I love about wrestling is it teaches you so many life lessons. It isn’t just wrestling.\n\n“It’s hard and it gets harder, but you just have to fight through it. Getting out there and wrestling in front of everyone is the easy part; practicing and being in a hot wrestling room for two to three hours a day — that’s the hard part. Once you get past the hard part, it’s easy.”\n\nNavarro won by fall in her semifinal match against Andrew’s Janae Vargas, and Vargas then pinned Niles West’s Khan for third place.\n\n145 – Dyani Rivera, West Aurora\n\nCheerleading, softball, wrestling — with so little time to spare outside of those three interests, it’s no wonder West Aurora senior Dyani Rivera was happy to only spend 47 seconds on the title mat at 145 in Oak Park.\n\n“My season never comes to an end. I’m always busy,” Rivera said. “I’ll have to skip nationals in cheerleading to go to the state tournament in wrestling this year. I have a lot of titles in cheer but I want a state title in wrestling.”\n\nAfter opening Saturday’s tournament with a fall in 56 seconds, Rivera’s biggest test of the day came in her semifinal match against top-seeded Adrianna Demos (12-3) of Warren.\n\nA back-and-forth match against Demos ended with Rivera posting a 4-0 decision win. Rivera scored a takedown on a single-leg shot in the first period and countered a Demos shot in the second period for her 4-0 lead.\n\nDemos chose top in the third period, riding Rivera out but unable to turn her to the final buzzer.\n\n“(Demos) was really good and I was kind of nervous going into that match,” Rivera said. “But I just went into it with the mindset that I needed to work hard and focus on what I need to work on. Then I was able to do what I did.”\n\nRivera won by fall at the :47 mark of her title match against OPRF’s Keydy Peralta. That win marked Rivera’s second tournament title of the season, having also won a title at Maine East. She also placed second at Normal’s 25-team tournament this year.\n\nRivera began wrestling at age four at her mother’s urging and quickly fell in love with the sport.\n\n“I loved the feeling when you win, especially when you beat the boys,” Rivera said. “It’s even better when you can make them cry.\n\n“Wrestling has taught me to stay strong and never give up. It’s great that girls are getting more into it and getting recognized.”\n\nPeralta (7-2) reached the finals with a fall and then a 9-3 semifinal decision against Fenton’s Sophia Sosa (10-6). Demos then topped Sosa by 8-4 decision on the third-place mat\n\n155 – Lexi Ritchie, Unity\n\nUnity’s Lexi Ritchie could be the poster child for toughness.\n\nThe sophomore is now fully committed to year-round wrestling and plans to wrestle in college. She placed second at 152 pounds at last year’s IWCOA state tournament as a freshman.\n\nBefore that, Ritchie played tackle football with the boys’ team. And what she liked about playing linebacker tells you all you need to know about her competitive nature.\n\n“My favorite part was the contact,” Ritchie said. “There was no complicated part about it.”\n\nUnity coach Logan Patton admires the edge that Ritchie brings to the mat.\n\n“She’s physical. She’d rather wrestle boys than girls and she’s still learning,” Patton said. “She wants to grasp so much wrestling so quickly and honestly doesn’t really even know her style yet. But she’s a brute and she’s going to come at you and wrestle hard.”\n\nRitchie (8-0) entered the OPRF tournament as the top seed at 155 and tore a path to an individual title. She posted a tech fall and three pins, capped by a pin in the finals against Larkin’s Giselle Ayala (12-7).\n\nAyala won by fall and then won a 4-2 semifinal decision over Fenton’s Yamile Penaloza to reach the finals. Penaloza then won by fall on the third-place mat against Oak Park’s Megan Barajas.\n\nRitchie has only been taken into the third period of a match once this season, and all of her wins have been by fall and tech fall. As she develops her own style, Ritchie is already more comfortable than she was in certain positions on the mat as a newcomer to the sport last year.\n\n“Now I get to positions where before I might end up on my back, but now I’m coming out on top of those scrambles,” she said.\n\nRitchie was a Fargo all-American during the off-season and she views that experience as pivotal in her young wrestling career. “Wrestling those people was a good measure of where I am at the national level,” Ritchie said. “Later I was able to beat a lot of those girls. I also wrestle with the boys, and where I have to be careful against boys, that fear isn’t in my mind against girls.”\n\nAfter placing second downstate last year, nothing but the top of the awards stand at this year’s state tournament will do for Ritchie.\n\n“The opportunity for me to win four state titles has been taken away, so I want to do the next best thing and win three,” she said.\n\n170 – Maria Ferrer, Larkin\n\n2021 IWCOA state champion Maria Ferrer’s rampage through the 170-pound weight class in Illinois continued in Oak Park. The Larkin junior won another individual title as she chases her goal to win her first IHSA state crown.\n\nFerrer earned three pins and improved to 21-0 with her pin of Downer Grove South’s Gracie Swierczynski. To this point in the season, through 21 matches, no opponent has made it through six minutes of wrestling with her and none of her three opponents in Oak Park made it to the second period with the reigning state champion.\n\nFerrer is even better this year.\n\n“Last year it was more hip-toss and headlock. This year it’s more shooting, and sweeps, and me getting lower and shooting more. I’m being faster when it comes to shooting,” she said.\n\nLarkin coach Patrick Hillebrand has enjoyed watching his junior’s evolution as a wrestler.\n\n“I’ve had her since she was a freshman. It’s been a lot about her confidence,” Hillebrand said. “She works hard, battles anyone she goes up against, she’s easily coached, and the biggest thing for her was understanding what she’s good at.”\n\nFerrer suffered the only two losses of her high school career during her freshman year two years ago. She has 21 pins in 21 wins this season. She even bumped up in weight for this season’s Normal tournament to win a title at 190 pounds.\n\nDespite her dominance, Ferrer takes nothing for granted.\n\n“I’m getting to know more people and they’re coming closer to me. It’s more competitive now,” Ferrer said.“I don’t pay attention to who I need to beat. Anything can happen so I just focus on what I have to do. If someone is strong I just have to be stronger.”\n\nNot to be overlooked where Ferrer is concerned is her level of desire to see girls wrestling flourish in Illinois, and her willingness to help foster that growth.\n\nShe wants to see Larkin’s girls program grow to a level that teams like Schaumburg, Oak Park, and Morton already enjoy.\n\n“There were full teams at Oak Park and that was so amazing to see,” Ferrer said. “So that’s something I have to work towards for our program. I have to work for that.”\n\n190 – Tiffany White, Oak Park and River Forest\n\nThe lone title match in Oak Park between previously unbeaten wrestlers took place at 190, where 2021 IWCOA state champion Noella Vazquez of Fenton took on IWCOA state runner-up Tiffany White of Oak Park. Vazquez won her state title last year at 182 pounds, while White was a state runner-up at 170.\n\nBoth wrestlers cruised to the finals before White (16-0) won by fall over Vazquez (13-1) to take the tournament crown.\n\n“It was a really good match and Tiffany looked really aggressive,” OPRF coach Fred Arkin said. “She’s a real physical wrestler, she likes to hand-fight hard, has a good leg attack and she brings it. She’s just a tough, aggressive girl.”\n\nWhite won the title at 190 one week earlier at Hoffman Estates. Glenbard West’s Ella Rejman (14-5) placed third in Oak Park and Morton’s Diana Rodriguez (7-6) finished fourth.\n\n235 – Sarah Epshtein, Oak Park and River Forest\n\nA week after placing second at Hoffman Estates, Oak Park sophomore Sarah Epshtein (9-1) took the title in Oak Park with a pin in the finals over Huskies teammate Tamera Erving.\n\nErving (6-6) won 7-0 in her semifinal match against Downers Grove South’s Brianna Fellows (9-4). Epshtein pinned Homewood-Flossmoor’s Jocelyn Williams (9-4) in their semifinal match to reach the finals.\n\nThe sophomore Epshtein placed second one week prior at the Hoffman Estates tournament and OPRF coach Fred Arkin has a blue-collar, cerebral wrestler in his practice room at 235.\n\n“Sarah came out during the pandemic and she has been working incredibly hard,” Arkin said. “She’s gaining strength, looks good and moves well, and she’s like a straight-A student. She approaches her wrestling as though it’s a chemistry experiment. She’s very analytical. She knows what she wants to do, she knows how to get there, and she’s a real student of the sport.”\n\nFROM THE IWCOA: If you are enjoying these articles, please consider a small donation to the IWCOA so that we can continue funding feature stories for our website and social media.

The Silver Streaks entered the week 15-2 in dual meets and needed just one more win to tie the school record. The squad hopes to continue its success on Saturday when it competes in the Western Big 6 Conference Tournament, which will be held at one of the state’s legendary sports settings, historic Wharton Field House in Moline. (Thanks to Matthew Wheaton of the Register-Mail for information on Galesburg).\n\nLeading the way for coach Lucas Smith’s runner-up Rockets were champion Reese Finch (30-3 at 145) and second-place finishers Jude Finch (27-7 at 126) and Sam Buser (24-10 at 285).
