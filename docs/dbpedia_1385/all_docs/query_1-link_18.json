        "text": "CJ-Optik in periodontal surgery has truly revolutionized my practice\n\nUsing a surgical microscope of CJ-Optik in periodontal surgery has truly revolutionized my practice. The enhanced visualization and precision it provides are unparalleled.\n\nBefore incorporating the microscope, delicate procedures like flap elevation and root surface debridement required significant skill and were prone to errors. Now, with the microscope’s magnification and illumination, I can navigate through intricate anatomy with confidence and accuracy.\n\nFor surgical purposes, a microscope needs to be very flexible and easy to manoever. The Flexion is just that.\n\nThe ability to see detailed anatomy at high magnification allows for the ultimate precision. And this level of precision ultimately leads to better outcomes and improved healing for my patients.\n\nBeing able to document cases at high quality is furthermore very beneficial for educational purposes.\n\nOverall, the surgical microscope has elevated the quality of care I provide. It’s not just a tool; it’s an essential partner in achieving optimal results in periodontal surgery. Therefore both in my private practice and at the University (KU Leuven – Belgium), I have chosen CJ-Optik.\n\nClick the YouTube video\n\nProf. Dr. Andy Temmerman\n\nDDS, MSc, PhD\n\nProfessor in Periodontology and Head & Neck Anatomy\n\nDepartment of Oral Health Sciences | Periodontology & Oral Microbiology\n\nKU Leuven – Department of Oral Health Sciences | University Hospitals Leuven – Periodontology\n\n… simply the best.\n\nHello! We spoke at IDS 2023 about how satisfied we are of the dental microscope we purchased from you. I’m sending my review and real time photo while working with it. I’ll be glad if you decide to post my honest opinion on your website.\n\nThe only regret I have about CJ-Optik’s dental microscope is that I haven’t bought it earlier. As a short size doctor married to a tall one, I can say this microscope has the amazing ability to transform and be ergonomic for both of us. As a woman, I think it’s the most beautiful and stylish model compared to any other at the market and the quality of image, light and flexibility are simply the best.\n\nBest regards,\n\nEkaterina Gerganova, DDM\n\nGEMDENT Clinic\n\nSofia, Bulgaria\n\nThe optics are extremely clear\n\nHi Rob, just want to let you know that I’m very happy choosing the CJ-Optik Microscope for my practice over the competition. I have been loving the scope and use it all the time for pretty much everything from documentation and patient education, restorative, crown and bridge, and of course endodontics. It’s even been great for several surgical applications which I did not expect.\n\nIn my opinion, CJ-Optik is the best value on the market. For the price you pay and the quality of build it’s incomparable. The optics are extremely clear, the light is bright, the uniball design makes it so easy to manipulate, and it’s well balanced. The adjustability of the binoculars accommodates any angle so I’m always in an ergonomic position.\n\nThe vario focus covers such a broad range of distances that I rarely have to move the scope; its so easy to focus anywhere. This facilitates a more efficient workflow with less adjustments in comparison to the other scopes I’ve used in the past.\n\nThe other thing I really enjoy is the documentation, I have it hooked up to a large TV screen which makes patient education so easy as they can really see what I’m seeing, it helps build confidence, trust, and improves acceptance to treatment.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend the CJ-Optik line of scopes, I would not see myself every going back to low magnification dentistry, you just see so much more! It’s like when you use loupes and then try to practice without them. Now I feel the same with the microscope vs loupes, I’m just so spoiled at seeing so much detail. I think the biggest compliment that I can give to the scope is that I am starting to look at adding another one for my secondary OP, so we’ll talk again soon!\n\nThank you Synca for such a great piece of equipment.\n\nDr Chris Godbout\n\nHBSc, MSc, DMD, Dental Surgeon\n\nOntario, Canada\n\n… the current leaders in my opinion.\n\nAfter reviewing the top microscopes on the market I decided to invest with CJ-Optik/Synca. I was a bit surprised at this, as I thought I would have gone with another vendor initially, but once I saw through the scope and was able to experience the optical clarity, the larger diameter optical channels, and the uni-ball centrally balanced mobility, it became the obvious choice.\n\nThere are reasons why CJ-Optik won the award for the best designed microscope, and I could see why. As a specialist, my work entails very intricate details and my decision making is based on my visual acuity that directly impacts treatment. This CJ-Optik twin microscope allows me to easily detect root fractures and root damage. My surgical work has become much more conservative and clean which expedites the healing process and the results are more aesthetically pleasing. The addition of the fluorescent illumination really differentiates the filing materials, the calculus, and caries which allows me to be extremely conservative and precise in my removal of restorations vs tooth structure.\n\nErgonomically I can feel the improved working posture which reduces tension on my neck and back. The angled ergonomic binoculars with horizontal and vertical adjustability allow me to maintain a straight upright position regardless of the angle of the scope body. This makes those longer procedures much more comfortable to complete.\n\nThe fact that CJ-Optik has great camera adaptors makes documentation easy and the image quality is great for patient communication and treatment validation. I can generate beautiful professional reports documenting the treatments.\n\nI’m very happy with my investment in CJ-Optik and working with a partner like Synca on this investment. They’ve been supplying visual aids and digital solutions for over 25yrs and their experience and knowledge reassured me in this investment. I recommend you look at CJ-Optik if you are in the market for a microscope. They are the company that is changing the Microscope game right now. They are the current leaders in my opinion.\n\nDr Freddy Fokam\n\nDDS MSc (perio)\n\nPeriodontist & Implant Surgeon\n\nOttawa, Canada\n\nHighly recommend\n\nI think the CJ-Optik FLEXION is an incredible microscope. All of the essential components and accessories are included, and you’re set up right away to take amazing still images and video (be prepared for a learning curve, however; microscope photography is a new world!). There is also a learning curve with performing treatment through a microscope, so having all the right components for success is very important. This includes a variable focus lens, which allows you to focus the scope with a knob instead of having to move the scope up and down. This component comes standard with the FLEXION and shortens the learning curve drastically.\n\nThe movement of the FLEXION is excellent; it is very nimble and as such makes a great scope for the general dentist who wants to do restorative and surgical work in addition to endodontics. My absolute favourite feature is the light diaphragm, which is not present in most (if not all) other scopes on the market. It allows you to dial down the diameter of the “circle of light” that the scope emits on the patient without altering the intensity of the light. I rarely ever need the full diameter of light the scope provides, so I almost always have it dialed down as to prevent light from shining in my patients’ eyes.\n\nMicroscope LEDs are super bright, and patients will comment if it gets in their eyes. I have two different scopes now; whenever I am doing anything in the upper anterior, I will only use the FLEXION for this reason alone. If I use my other scope, the light is in their eyes for the entire appointment, even with protective sunglasses. Overall, it is a fantastic scope and if I could do it all over again, I would buy it again. Highly recommend.\n\nDr. Michael Wenzel\n\nDDS, Medicine Hat\n\nAlberta, Canada\n\nMy work is improved\n\nHonestly, the microscope is the best investment that I’ve ever made. My back feels amazing. My work is improved. My patients are impressed. And I get referrals from other dentists.\n\nI am so happy with my microscope. I tried 3 other makes of microscopes and the CJ-Optik was, in my opinion, the best. It is easy to position thanks to the monoball coupling, the iris diaphragm is very useful for upper anteriors and the plan-apochromatic lenses with the full frame photo tube allow for exceptional photography/video. I used 4.5x loupes and now the scope for everything (including exams) and my neck and back have never been happier. Hugo’s and SYNCA’s support have been unparalleled and I can’t wait to put two more microscopes in my clinic.\n\nDr. Russ Butler\n\nDDS\n\nBattleford, Canada\n\nUnique\n\nAlong 10 years of academic career in Cairo University and 5 years in continuous education worldwide institutes, I always believed that magnification is the cornerstone and game changer in dental field. Magnification doesn’t only affect the outcome of your treatments but also directly affects your passion along every case and eagerness to see more and thus enjoy more details of every case. CJ-Optik in my opinion solved many parts of the magnification equation, providing a very high degree of clarity, amazing illumination, very well selected degrees of magnifications suiting different dental procedures and finally the fluorescent mode the future of visualizing what was never seen before. CJ-Optik is very special in taking care of every single detail, inventing and developing rather than pretending or copying, this is clearly seen starting from the very unique external design, ergonomic joints and along every single detail in the microscope. Through educational career and after trying several brands I can conclude my experience with CJ-Optik in an single word simply UNIQUE.\n\nDr. Mohamed Mohsen Aboelhassan\n\nMSc, PhD of Endodontics\n\nLecturer of Endodontics, Cairo University\n\nFounder of Everyday Endodontic Challenges International Institute"
