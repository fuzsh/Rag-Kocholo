        "text": "Allostery refers to the regulation of protein function resulting from the binding of an effector to a site distal to the protein’s functional centre (the active site in the case of enzymes) and is a crucial mechanism for the control of multiple physiological processes (Shen et al., 2016; Nussinov and Tsai, 2013). The functional response of enzymes to allosteric ligands occurs on the ns - ms time scale, preceding other important regulatory mechanisms such as changes in gene expression or signalling-induced post-translational modifications (PTMs) (Gerosa and Sauer, 2011), thereby enabling fast cellular responses to various stimuli. Despite the demonstrated importance of protein allostery, the investigation of underlying mechanisms remains a challenge for conventional structural approaches and necessitates multi-disciplinary strategies. Latent allosteric pockets can emerge as a consequence of protein flexibility (Bowman and Geissler, 2012; Keedy et al., 2018) making their identification elusive. Even for known allosteric pockets, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underpin the propagation of free energy between an identified allosteric site and the active site can be complicated because of the involvement of protein structural motions on a variety of time scales (Motlagh et al., 2014). Furthermore, many proteins contain several allosteric pockets and can simultaneously bind more than one ligand (Iturriaga-Vásquez et al., 2015; Macpherson and Anastasiou, 2017; Sieghart, 2015). Concurrent binding of allosteric ligands can modulate the functional response of a protein through the action of multiple allosteric pathways (del Sol et al., 2009), however, it remains unclear whether such allosteric pathways operate independently, or integrate, either synergistically or antagonistically, to control protein function.\n\nAltered allosteric regulation has a prominent role in the control of tumour metabolism, as well as a number of other pathological processes (Nussinov and Tsai, 2013; Macpherson and Anastasiou, 2017; DeLaBarre et al., 2014). Changes in glycolysis observed in some tumours have been linked to aberrant allosteric regulation of glycolytic enzymes including phosphofructokinase, triose phosphate isomerase and pyruvate kinase. Pyruvate kinases (PKs) catalyse the transfer of a phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and produce pyruvate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). There are four mammalian isoforms of pyruvate kinase: PKM1, PKM2, PKL and PKR. PKM2 is highly expressed in tumour cells and in many proliferative tissues, and has critical roles in cancer metabolism that remain under intense investigation (Allen and Locasale, 2018; Anastasiou et al., 2011; Christofk et al., 2008a; Dayton et al., 2016), as well as in controlling systemic metabolic homeostasis and inflammation (Palsson-McDermott et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2016; Qi et al., 2017).\n\nIn contrast to the highly homologous alternatively spliced variant PKM1, which is thought to be constitutively active, PKM2 activity in cancer cells is maintained at a low level by the action of various allosteric ligands or post-translational modifications (PTMs) (Chaneton and Gottlieb, 2012). Low PKM2 activity promotes pro-tumorigenic functions, including divergence of glucose carbons into biosynthetic and redox-regulating pathways that support proliferation and defence against oxidative stress (Anastasiou et al., 2011; Christofk et al., 2008a; Anastasiou et al., 2012; Lunt et al., 2015). Small-molecule activators, which render PKM2 constitutively active by overcoming endogenous inhibitory cues, attenuate tumour growth, suggesting that regulation of PKM2 activity, rather than increased PKM2 expression per se, is important (Anastasiou et al., 2011; Anastasiou et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2017a; Kim et al., 2015). Therefore, PKM2 has emerged as a prototypical metabolic enzyme target for allosteric modulators and this has contributed to the renewed impetus to develop allosteric drugs for metabolic enzymes, which are expected to specifically interfere with cancer cell metabolism while sparing normal tissues (DeLaBarre et al., 2014).\n\nThe structure of the PKM2 protomer comprises N-terminal, A, B and C domains (Figure 1). Various ligands that regulate PKM2 activity bind to sites distal from the catalytic core, nestled between the A and B domains. The upstream glycolytic intermediate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) binds to a pocket in the C-domain (Dombrauckas et al., 2005) and increases the enzymatic activity of PKM2, thereby establishing a feed-forward loop that prepares lower glycolysis for increased levels of incoming glucose carbons. Activation of PKM2 by FBP is associated with a decreased KM for the substrate PEP (KMPEP), while the kcat remains unchanged (Chaneton et al., 2012; Boxer et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2010; Yacovan et al., 2012), although some reports also find an elevated kcat (Morgan et al., 2013; Akhtar et al., 2009) and the reason for this discrepancy remains unknown. Additionally, several amino acids regulate PKM2 activity by binding to a pocket in the A domain TIM-barrel core (Chaneton et al., 2012; Yuan et al., 2018; Eigenbrodt et al., 1983). L-serine (Ser) and L-histidine (His) increase, whereas L-phenylalanine (Phe), L-alanine (Ala), L-tryptophan (Trp), L-valine (Val) and L-proline (Pro) decrease KMPEP. Similar to FBP, the reported effects on kcat vary (Chaneton et al., 2012; Morgan et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2018; Gosalvez et al., 1975). Furthermore, succinyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-ribose 5′-phosphate (SAICAR) (Keller et al., 2012) and the triiodothyronine (T3) hormone (Morgan et al., 2013) bind to unidentified PKM2 pockets to increase and decrease, respectively, the affinity for PEP.\n\nMany of these allosteric effectors have been shown to regulate PKM2 activity by changing the equilibrium of PKM2 between one of three states – a low activity monomer, a low activity tetramer (T-state), and a high activity tetramer (R-state) – with some studies reporting the existence of low activity dimers (Dombrauckas et al., 2005; Morgan et al., 2013; Gavriilidou et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2016; Ashizawa et al., 1991a; Hofmann et al., 1975; Mazurek, 2011). FBP promotes, whereas T3 prevents, tetramerisation (Dombrauckas et al., 2005; Morgan et al., 2013; Kato et al., 1989). The mode of PKM2 regulation by amino acids is unclear. Some reports suggest that Ala promotes the formation of inactive PKM2 dimers (Hofmann et al., 1975; Felíu and Sols, 1976), whereas others show that Phe, Ala and Trp stabilise the T-state tetramer (Morgan et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2018). In addition to allosteric effectors, PTMs can also influence the oligomerisation of PKM2 protomers, although the effects of PTMs on the enzyme mechanism remain elusive. Nevertheless, cellular PKM2 activity is often inferred from the oligomeric state PKM2 is found to adopt (Anastasiou et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2017a; Wang et al., 2017b; Lim et al., 2016; Hitosugi et al., 2009; Lv et al., 2013; Christofk et al., 2008b). Collectively, current evidence suggests that a link between enzyme activity and oligomerisation state exists and, while not well understood, it may play a role in PKM2 regulation.\n\nIn vitro, PKM2 can bind concurrently to multiple allosteric effectors that might either reciprocally influence each other’s action or exert independent effects on enzymatic activity. A PKM2 mutant that cannot bind FBP can still be activated by Ser and, conversely, a mutant that abolishes Ser binding can be activated by FBP (Chaneton et al., 2012), suggesting that amino acids could work independently from FBP to regulate PKM2. However, inhibitory amino acids that bind to the same pocket as Ser fail to inhibit the enzyme in the presence of FBP indicating a dominant influence of the latter (Yuan et al., 2018; Sparmann et al., 1973). Similarly, FBP can overcome PKM2 inhibition by T3 (Kato et al., 1989). FBP has also been shown to attenuate, but not completely prevent, inhibition of PKM2 by Ala (Ashizawa et al., 1991b). Together, these observations highlight PKM2 as a suitable model system to study how inputs from multiple allosteric cues are integrated to regulate enzymatic activity. Such insights may also have implications for metabolic regulation in vivo. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether simultaneous binding of PKM2 to more than one ligands is functionally relevant in cells, because little is known about the intracellular concentrations of allosteric effectors relative to their binding affinities for PKM2.\n\nHere, we first measure intracellular concentrations of key allosteric regulators and their respective affinities for PKM2, and provide evidence that, in cells, PKM2 is saturated with FBP. We then show that FBP binding in vitro alters the outcome of Phe binding on PKM2 oligomerisation and activity compared to apo-PKM2. Using a novel computational framework to predict residues implicated in allosteric signal transmission from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identify a network of PKM2 residues that mediates allosteric activation by FBP. Intriguingly, mutagenesis of some of these residues interferes with the ability of Phe to hinder PKM2 regulation by FBP but does not perturb FBP–induced activation itself. These residues, therefore, integrate inputs from Phe in FBP-bound PKM2 and underlie the functional synergism between ligands that bind to distinct pockets in regulating PKM2 activity."
