Pamela Stanley gave a prepared speech unrelated to board agenda items that sought to mischaracterize parents' concerns. I requested Board President Michael D'Aquila to control the meeting and bring it back in order. He asked for Ms. Stanley to stay on topic, but she refused, and he did not exercise his powers as Board President. I brought it to Mark Wenczel's attention -our BOE attorney, who is also representing Ms. Stanley on behalf of the Board of Ed in their ethics complaint against me. I asked him if it was appropriate for Ms. Stanley to give a prepared speech unrelated to her donation, which was on the board's agenda. Mr. Wenczel agreed that my request to stay with the board agenda was appropriate but did not run interference with Ms. Stanley's monologue. The Board's attorney confirmed that she was out of order. I informed Board president Michael D'Aquila that I was not happy with having a board attorney present at every board meeting but respected his decision and pointed out the futility of spending Taxpayer dollars ($165/hr) to have an attorney present when neither Mr. D'Aquila nor Mr. Wenczel can maintain order. I walked out as the board president, nor the board attorney could control the meeting. It is clear that the machinery surrounding the board meeting exists for one reason: it has nothing to do with protecting our students, families, or the district. As always these are my thoughts and opinions as an individual and do not represent the opinion of the Berkeley Heights Board of Education.",
