So far we have raised over $2,500 and it seems like people are still sending in money. Hopefully someday in the future I can send you an email thanking you for helping find a cure because of this money being raised.\n\nI am ready for the marathon. If you would like to see how I do you can go to:\n\nhttp://www.nyrrc.org/nyrrc/marathon/results/index.html\n\nduring the race and it will tell you my times for my half marathon, 20k and the finish. You can type in my name\n\nor even easier my number which is 5510. Thanks again for your support.\n\nTom Metz\n\nAmazing Story:\n\nThis is an article about Marla Runyan, the first legally blind athelete to compete in the Olympics.\n\nhttp://usatoday.com/sports/olympics/summer/2002-10-29-runyan-cover_x.htm\n\nAnything's possible if you put your mind to it.\n\nOctober 29, 2002\n\nAlumnus Article:\n\nLeukemia not a hurdle for this runner\n\nBy Rob Jennings, Daily Record\n\nROCKAWAY - A 36-year-old borough man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia will be one of more than 30,000 runners at Sunday's 33rd annual New York City Marathon. Tom Metz, who remains at an early stage of the disease, is using his 26.2-mile effort as a fundraiser for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.\n\nThrough noon on Monday, Metz had raised $2,039 - \"and 79 cents,\" he added lightly. It will be Metz's second marathon. His first, also in New York City, was in 1992.\n\nThe one-time track star at Trenton State College (now known as The College of New Jersey) initially signed up to support his friend, John Hanlon of Hackettstown, who will run his first marathon Sunday. Then Metz was placed in contact with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society's chapter in Springfield, which organizes participation in numerous races, including Monday's Dublin Marathon in Ireland, as a means of raising money.\n\nIn addition to his running number, Metz will wear the nicknames of two close friends - \"Wrobo\" and \"Pig\" - on his running jersey.\n\nJoe Wroblewski, who died of leukemia complications in 1998 at age 36, was Metz's college teammate.\n\nMichael Pignatello, 34, who lives in Lafayette, is in remission from leukemia, Metz said. Pignatello said Monday that he appreciated Metz's acknowledgment of his struggle.\n\nMetz was diagnosed in 1999 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a malignancy of the white blood cells known as lymphocytes. The disease is so rare in young people that doctors initially attributed Metz's test results to a lab mistake. When Metz first received the news, he was unsure whether he'd ever run again. However, because he remains at an early stage of the disease, he's been able to remain active, despite battling occasional fatigue, joint pain and swollen lymph nodes.\n\nLess than a year after being diagnosed, Metz won a 1,500-meter race in the 30- to 34-year-old group at the USA Track & Field championships in Oregon, finishing in 4:26. Last March, Metz and three friends set a U.S. indoor record at a 4 x 800-meter relay race in New York City in 8:44.\n\nMetz's wife, Kathleen, will watch him run Sunday, using the New York City subways to catch him at different places on the course.\n\nOctober 28, 2002\n\nSports Hall of Fame Dinner:\n\nCoach McCorkle's dinner and induction was fantastic! Approximately a dozen or more cross country and track alumni from many different years came to show support for Coach. Members from the programs first year (who's names I can't remember, please email me and I'll post them) came out to show Coach they hadn't forgotten about him. Coach was absolutely thrilled to see so many of us there. Coach's acceptance speech was very humble and individually thanked each of us that came to the dinner. I don't think Coach could have been more proud to see so many of his previous runners from over the years. Dan Magee gave a very eloquent introduction speech highlighting the caring gentleman we all enjoyed calling \"Coach\" throughout our years at TSC/TCNJ.\n\nWe met so many older alumni Friday that we can't remember everyone's name, please email us so we can list you here. Partial list of those alumni in attendance:\n\nDan Magee\n\nGlenn Fuchs\n\nBrendan Jacobs\n\nMark Mirabelli\n\nPatsy Marino\n\nJim Webb\n\nWe'll have more coverage and photos as well shortly.\n\nConnecting with the Younger Alumni:\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting a large group of the younger alumni on homecoming Saturday. The only name I recall off the top of my head is Joe Geismar (spelling?) Please email me your email addresses and thanks for the beer.\n\nOlder alumni please be aware that the younger guys are still keeping our traditions alive. Keep pride in the program!\n\nNew Alumnus Photo Gallery:\n\nJim Webb was at Coach McCorkle's Induction dinner the other night and gave us some old photos to post. Check them out here.\n\nOctober 24, 2002\n\nMessage from Coach Rick McCorkle:\n\nGlenn,\n\nThanks so much for yours and Tara's \"best wishes.\" Dan suggested I contact you in regard to posting a message on the Alumni website. I have received so many messages of \"best wishes\" and other very complementary messages from Alumni. It would be very time consuming to contact each of them individually. Suffice to say, I am very honored and humbled by their response, and want to thank each and every one of them for their kind words. It was indeed a pleasure to work with so many fine individuals over the years, and even more gratifying to see what successes each has had with career, community, and family. This response has made my coaching and teaching years so worthwhile.\n\nThanks so much, Rick McCorkle\n\nOctober 22, 2002\n\nVERY IMPORTANT\n\nCoach Rick McCorkle's Sports Hall of Fame Induction Dinner and Ceremony Update:\n\nSeveral of us alumni are attending Coach McCorkle's induction dinner, if you wish to join us watching Coach get inducted please do the following:\n\nPlease RSVP for the Sports Hall of Fame dinner by calling TCNJÂ’s Office of Development and Alumni Affairs at 609-771-2393 to get on the guest list.

Former softball player, Ilene Cohen (Bayville, NJ) and former wrestler, Max Calehuff (San Jose, CA) will be inducted for their accomplishments at The College, while former coaches, Melissa Magee Speidel (Lawrenceville, NJ) and Rick McCorkle (Yardley, PA) also joined the Hall of Fame for their outstanding accomplishments as coaches and mentors. Additionally, The College will be recognizing two athletic teams for their outstanding accomplishments as Â“Teams of Distinction.Â” They are the 1971-1972 wrestling team that went 16-0 and the 1981 womenÂ’s lacrosse team that won the programÂ’s first-ever national championship as it won the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) Division III Championship. For further information on the Hall of Fame or to RSVP for the Hall of Fame dinner, please call TCNJÂ’s Office of Development and Alumni Affairs at 609-771-2393.\n\nRick McCorkle (Yardley, PA)\n\nHead MenÂ’s Cross Country, MenÂ’s Track and Field, and MenÂ’s and WomenÂ’s Swimming Coach. For more than three decades Rick McCorkle led the menÂ’s cross country and track and field programs at The College. During his 32-year tenure, he guided the program to numerous conference and regional honors, while also coaching nine All-Americans in track and field. In addition, a number of student-athletes established school records in track and field, many of which still stand today. After arriving at The College in 1963 as a member of the faculty in the health and physical education department, McCorkle wasted no time on making his mark on the athletic department as a coach. His coaching career commenced in 1963 when he started the menÂ’s cross country program. He served as the programÂ’s coach for more than 30-years, stepping down in 1994. During that same time, he also started the menÂ’s winter track and field indoor program, serving as its coach from 1969 until 1995. McCorkle also served as the head coach of the menÂ’s outdoor track and field squad from 1970 until 1995. Not a person that enjoys idle time, he also managed to start the menÂ’s swimming program at The College and served as its coach from 1967 until 1970. During that same era, he also served as the womenÂ’s swimming coach from 1967 until 1970. After retiring from coaching in 1995, he maintained his position as a member of the faculty in the health and physical education department until 1999.\n\n6Â–10 PM Athletic Hall of Fame Dinner\n\nStudent Center 201 East and West\n\nHonoring the 2002 Alumni Athletic Hall of Fame recipients and the Team of Distinction.\n\nRecipients:\n\nMax Calehuff Â’73\n\nEileen Cohen Â’88\n\nRick McCorkle (coach)\n\nMelissa MaGee Speidel (coach)\n\nAlumni Email Update:\n\nThe following alumni have either been found changed their email address.Bob \"Kemo\" Nielson (found)\n\nMIA/ Let's track down the following alumni (additions):\n\nThe following is an incomplete of alumni we'd like to track down.

It was a view that nearly killed him. At about 8:45 a.m. Tuesday, Giaccardo heard a noise he still finds hard to describe. He looked out to see fire erupting from Tower 1. \"I just saw an orange ball come across our windows,\" Giaccardo said. \"When I looked again, World 1 was smoking. I backed up and I could smell jet fuel ... through the vents.\" The tower, and many of its people, would soon be gone. And Giaccardo, a 35-year-old father of two, would cheat death twice in one long morning. Within five minutes of the blast, Giaccardo had helped round up 80 to 100 colleagues at Corporation Service Co., a company that helps businesses incorporate. He and others from his team scrambled to an express elevator, but it was jammed with people, many starting to panic. So they took the stairs.\n\nHundreds were already walking briskly down the stairwell. He, like others, figured a small plane had accidentally crashed into Tower 1; no need to panic. The descent remained orderly - at least at first. Hundreds more flooded the\n\nstairway, walking two by two. At the 40th floor, an announcement came over a loudspeaker: Everyone should stay where they are. One man, Giaccardo said, went back upstairs, saying he had work to finish. Giaccardo does not know if that man made it out. But Giaccardo kept going. He thought of his son Shane's birthday today. He wanted to be there when Shane turned 2. He and others kept moving. Sirens blared, but the lights were still on and the building was functioning - until they descended two more floors. \"When we got to the 38th floor, we heard a crash or a loud bang. We all froze. Literally, the whole building shook floor by floor. You could feel it coming down, like dominoes.\" Giaccardo and the others didn't know at the time, but a second hijacked airliner had ripped through his building - right where he was sitting only minutes before in his office.\n\nPeople on the stairs began to panic, rushing down. Giaccardo yelled for them to remain calm. The panic subsided. The group finally made it to the second floor. Emergency personnel were waiting there, pointing the way out. Giaccardo walked a block or two before coming across a young woman crying hysterically. \"She couldn't move,\" he said. \"I helped her up, but she was just frozen with terror. I said, `You can't stay here. You have to keep moving.'\" Just then, Giaccardo heard a loud thud. He saw a plume of smoke 20 stories high come toward him. His building had just collapsed. He had twice missed death. People around him were covered in a fine white dust that filled the air. Debris flew everywhere. People walked like zombies. Paramedics worked on a bloodied man lying in the street. Giaccardo was alone and lost.\n\nHe made it to Chinatown, where he asked another man to help him find Penn Station. Though they had never met, the two walked uptown to the train station. Giaccardo waited there two hours before catching a train back to New Jersey about 3 p.m. He arrived in Westmont about 6 p.m. Earlier in the day, his wife, Beth, had been waiting anxiously for a call from her husband as she watched her sons Shane and Louie, 4, at their home on Virginia Avenue. \"For two hours I thought he was dead,\" she said. \"I knew he worked on the 87th floor and I knew he couldn't survive what happened there.\" Giaccardo had been unable to reach his wife early in the morning because cell phone lines were jammed. Eventually he got through to his mother, who relayed the message that he had survived.\n\nArriving at home Tuesday night, \"The first thing I did was hug my family,\" he said.\n\nNow that his office is gone, Giaccardo, who graduated from Audubon High School and Trenton State College, plans to work at the company's Delaware office. A supervisor has already contacted him about counseling. \"It was amazing to see how people react in that situation,\" he said. \"There were people crying, there were people calm. \"I just wonder about the impact of all this. My sons will learn about what happened today when they're in college.\"\n\nOctober 7, 2002\n\nAlumni Spotlight:\n\nPatrick J.

I am fortunate enough to be feeling very strong the last few months which has allowed me to train with my friend John to run the marathon. I have decided to run the marathon as part of team in training to raise money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Leukemia has killed one of my close college teammates and nearly killed one of my best friends from high school. Fortunately my friend from high school battled the disease and won. I thank god every time I see him and enjoy so much the time that we spend together. In December of 1999 I was diagnosed with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. I am lucky enough that I am in stage zero which is a watch and wait stage, meaning that I get my blood tested every four months and if I can continue to stay in the lower stages of this disease I will not need treatment. If I progress to a stage three or four I would then need treatment. My hope is that I will never need treatment. Right now there is no cure for the kind of Leukemia that I have. I am hoping that they will find a cure before I ever need treatment. I am raising money for the team in training in hopes that the money will lead to a cure for my type of Leukemia. The society has helped to raise money to spend on the drug Gleevac which is a drug that is taken to cure C.M.L. That is the type of leukemia that my college friend died from in 1998. Unfortunately the drug came out a little too late for my friend Joe. So as I run in memory of my friend Joe and in honor of my friend Mike please help me raise money for a great cause.Thank you everyone for your support and I will keep you posted on my marathon and my next blood test in December.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTom Metz\n\nPlease Note: Click here to view the donor form.
