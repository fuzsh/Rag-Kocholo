        "text": "The UC Botanical Garden at Berkeley is thrilled to welcome Clare Loughran (she/her) as the new Curator and Conservation Officer starting this month. Previously, Clare was the Assistant Curator at the Garden from 2016 to 2022. Clare is excited to return to the Garden in this new role, bringing with her a wealth of experience and a deep-rooted passion for plant conservation and curation. Director of Collections Andrew Doran writes, \"It goes without saying that Clare will bring a whole range of talents with her back to the Garden, as well as knowledge of the collections and the challenges that lie ahead. I can think of no better person for this job.\" Clare’s love of plants began during her time at UC Davis, where she earned a B.S. in Environmental Horticulture with an emphasis in Biodiversity and Restoration in 2011. Shortly after graduating, she took a role as an Assistant Museum Scientist at the UC and Jepson Herbaria at UC Berkeley. There, she trained and led a team of undergraduates and volunteers in digitizing herbarium specimens including large collections of algae, fungi, and lichens. In her roles at UC and, more recently, at Nomad Ecology as a Botanist, Clare has been a key part of projects as wide ranging as database management and development, seed collection and banking, growing plants in the nursery, conducting botanical surveys, monitoring restoration projects, and vegetation mapping. With her passion for plant conservation, Clare is eager to add to the Garden's legacy of promoting plant diversity, conservation, and public education. Please join us in welcoming Clare back to the UC Botanical Garden!\n\nRetirement Announcement: After a long and distinguished career Garden curator Holly Forbes has retired. Holly has worked at the UC Botanical Garden at Berkeley for over 35 years, beginning as a curatorial assistant in 1988 and as lead curator in the mid-90s. Holly's work has had a tremendous impact and influenced every aspect of the Garden, from research and conservation to education. She helped boost the Garden's professional and public stature through her involvement with organizations such as the American Public Gardens Association (APGA), the Center for Plant Conservation, and the California Native Plant Society (CNPS). Through her meticulous attention to detail and persistence for producing work to the highest standards she contributed greatly to the Garden's recognition as a world-renowned research Garden. We invite you to read more about Holly and her remarkable career: https://ow.ly/i5Jv50SALOF We wish her well in her retirement and future endeavors!

UCBG has a small but remarkable collection of Banksia species (12 of an estimated 183 different species), many of which are now flowering in the Garden's Australasian Area. These plants are native to Australia and New Guinea, ranging in size from prostrate shrubs to trees, up to 30 meters tall (100 ft). Nearly half of the Garden’s species are from New South Wales, collected as seeds by a former horticulturist. The genus is named after Joseph Banks, an English naturalist (1743-1820) who was a member of Captain James Cook’s round-the-world voyage (1768-1771), and who, working with the botanist Daniel Solander, first collected this plant. In 1782, the great Swedish naturalist Linnaeus honored Bank’s discovery with the name Banksia. The flowers of Banksia are arranged into elongated heads or spikes, which can be made up of hundreds or even thousands of tiny, individual flowers, which together give the impression of a rounded brush. 1.

This is a short video that show the progress we have made on the Japanese Pool. We have successfully removed newts, drained and repaired the pool and installed the new liner. The pool has been filled for several weeks now and we have already started reintroducing Asian plants from the Wuhan Botanical Garden and from a world authority on the genus Nymphaea. We hope they like their new home. https://lnkd.in/g55Y48YZ\n\nSummer isn't over yet, and the Garden's Eastern North American Area is putting on a floral display! The collection spans nearly an acre and was developed in the late 1970s. It includes plants that occur east of the Mississippi, from the Canadian provinces through the Gulf states. They represent mixed coniferous-deciduous forest communities, meadows and prairies, and to our knowledge this botanic collection is unique to the West Coast. The diversity of this area is impressive for such a small space, with over 500 species represented in the collection. The latest issue of Garden News is out.
