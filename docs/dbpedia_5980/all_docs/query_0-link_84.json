        "text": "Okay, I found a post on Reddit from 2015 that essentially asks the same question as this question. And there is an answer there that provides translation of some of the dialogue, but it is in a PDF format.\n\nSo I am posting that translation here as plain text—with some copy edits and formatting tweaks—so it’s easier to read. Here is the scene with “Nobody” and his girlfriend translated by Dorothy Thunder from the University of Alberta from Cree to English:\n\nGirlfriend: Tâp’we cî ôma ewînakasiyan? (Is it true that you are going to leave me?)\n\nNobody: Nîcimos! (My sweetheart!)\n\nGirlfriend: Ketweyan kîya esaweyimikâsot maskwa mâka ki-tâpwem kîminîcâkanis! (You say you are a gifted/blessed bear but a true/real bastard. I pray here to night moon every night you to have a child but you don’t agree to it. This is not me — I am still young and kind — you dick/penis!)\n\nNobody: Nîcimos! (My sweetheart!)\n\nGirlfriend: Nikiskeyihten, nikiskeyihten keyâpic ka-nitaweyimin! Ekosi! (I know, I know that you will still want me! That’s it!)\n\nNobody: Nîcimos! (My sweetheart!)\n\nGirlfriend: Awas! (Get out of here! / Get lost!)\n\nNobody: Ceskwa! Nîcimos, ceskwa! (Wait! My sweetheart, wait!)\n\nAnd here is info on the scenes in the Makah Village near the end of the film translated by Maria Parker Pascua and according to her those scenes are in the Makah language and the tribes mentioned were Cree and Blackfoot. Leaving in some descriptions for context from the translator:\n\nThe 6th scene has Makah words when they arrive by canoe on the Columbia River to a Native Village.\n\nNobody: Hello! Is that you folks, my Makah people (A form of greeting in Makah). I am Nobody.\n\nThe next part is not as clear, but it sounds like he is continues on to say something like:\n\nNobody: Needing an Indian Doctor (Shaman/Healer).\n\nNobody: Give. (Like give help or maybe give them the sick man?)\n\nThe last scene with Native language is also Makah, but the first part sounds a little clipped.\n\nNobody: Hello! Is that you folks? (A form of greeting in Makah). It’s a nice day!\n\nAnd a village man answers him with:\n\nVillage Man: Yes. It is a nice day."
