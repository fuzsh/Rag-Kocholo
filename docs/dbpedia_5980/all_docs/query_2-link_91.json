        "text": "If the idea of seeing an Academy-Award-winning movie before anyone else does, you'll want to spend time at the Rhode Island International Film Festival, now through Sunday.\n\n\"We have a very consistent record of getting of getting Oscar nominations and wins,\" said Shawn Quirk, the festival's executive director.\n\nThe festival is one of several that can qualify a film for Oscar consideration. In fact, the winners in three categories at the festival — live-action short film, animated short film and documentary short film — will be entered into consideration. The festival also qualifies films for the Oscar equivalents in Britain, Canada and Spain.\n\nA 2017 festival winner, \"The Silent Child,\" about a social worker who teaches a deaf six-year-old to communicate through sign language, went on to win the 2018 Academy Award for Live Action Short Film.\n\nThat success has attracted entrants to the festival, which has been an Oscar qualifier since 2000. \"It's really been a mainstay for filmmakers for the last two decades,\" said Quirk.\n\nHow to attend the RI International Film Festival\n\nScreenings of short and feature-length films, plus workshops and talks, are scheduled Wednesday through Sunday at 11 locations in Westerly, East Greenwich and Providence, including an outdoor venue on the Providence River at Providence Innovation District Park.\n\nSome of the events are free, while others require a ticket, which can be purchased at the festival website, which has the schedule.\n\nHighlights of the 2024 RI International Film Festival\n\n\"Federal Hill\"\n\nWednesday will be \"Federal Hill\" night at the Showcase Cinema in Providence Place Mall as filmmaker Michael Corrente hosts a screening of his 1994 film set and filmed in Providence's historically Italian neighborhood, and then premieres the pilot of a TV show he is developing, also by the same name.\n\n\"Chosen Family\"\n\nThe film, produced by the East Greenwich team of Chad A. Verdi, Chad Verdi Jr. and Paul Luba, stars Heather Graham, Julia Stiles and John Brotherton, and will play Thursday at 8 p.m. at the Greenwich Odeum, East Greenwich. Written and directed by Graham, it tells the story of a yoga teacher trying to find inner peace despite a chaotic life and trying to fix everyone else's problems.\n\n\"HOLD\"\n\nThe 14-minute film, which was shown at the festival's opening night Tuesday at Providence Performing Arts Center, stars Debra Monk, who plays Armstrong on the HBO series \"The Gilded Age.\"\n\nIt tells the story of a family dealing with a dying member and the apparent miracle that comes from holding on to loved ones.\n\n\"It's a well-made short that's very strong, and Debra gives an amazing performance,\" said Quirk.\n\n\"Gordie\"\n\nA 2024 French film about a 12-year-old dreamer who locks himself into the imaginary universe of his favorite movie, “Stand By Me,” as his mother deals with a medical crisis. It also was shown at the festival's opening night Tuesday."
