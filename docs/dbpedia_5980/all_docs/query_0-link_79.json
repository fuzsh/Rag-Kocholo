        "text": "January 27 – February 25, 2024\n\nSheryl and Harvey White Theatre\n\nConrad Prebys Theatre Center\n\nBy Sanaz Toossi\n\nDirected by Arya Shahi\n\nWinner of the 2023 Pulitzer Prize, the Obie Award, and the Lucille Lortel Award. In a classroom near Tehran, four adult students prepare for an English proficiency exam. They each have a reason for being there: a chance at opportunity, access, or a new calling. But as they bond over this new way to express themselves, they also grapple with the lives they must leave behind. Told with hilarious wit and genuine compassion, Sanaz Toossi’s English is “both a buoyant comedy of communication and a subtle but probing exploration of what it means to speak and feel understood” (New York Theatre Guide).\n\nRunning time: One hour and 40 minutes (one act with no intermission).\n\nThis production includes strong language.\n\nVicki and Carl Zeiger Insights Seminar: Tuesday, January 30 at 6:00 p.m.\n\nPost Show Forum: Tuesday, February 6; Wednesday, February 7; and Tuesday, February 13.\n\nOpen-Caption Performance: Saturday, February 17 at 2:00 p.m.\n\nEnglish is supported by major production sponsor The Bernard J. Eggertsen, M.D. Fund.\n\nDigital Program"
