        "text": "In June, the actress Ayelet Zurer stood at a microphone in a Los Angeles recording studio, reading English dialogue aloud as it scrolled, karaoke-like, under scenes of Netflix’s Spanish crime drama “La Casa de Papel,” or “Money Heist.”\n\nShe voices Raquel, a tough police inspector played by Itziar Ituño, but her performance transcended words: She sighed, she shrugged, she shook her head — all of it carefully synced to Raquel’s actions onscreen — as the dubbing director Matt Kollar coached her from behind the sound board.\n\n“Where did the Professor go?” Zurer said into the microphone.\n\nKollar: “Don’t say ‘Professor,’ that’s too dubby.”\n\nZurer: “We’re looking for a middle-aged male.”\n\nKollar: “Too short. And ‘male’ is too dubby.”\n\n“Dubby,” in this context, means anything that is not speech-like — jarring diction or awkward wording — or is conspicuously out of time with how the actors mouths are moving onscreen. (Think of the vintage Japanese monster movies you watched on Saturday afternoon TV.)\n\nDubbed versions of shows have long been commonplace in Europe’s TV marketplace, where shows routinely cross borders — it is a thriving industry with its own award ceremonies, and voice actors are famous in their own right. But in the more insular United States, they have frequently been treated as a joke, thanks to decades of schlocky martial arts films and spaghetti Westerns defined by indifferent voice-casting and terrible lip-syncing.\n\nNetflix, which has perhaps the world’s fastest-growing library of international series and movies, wants badly to change that perception. Over the past nine months, it has been actively recruiting actors and filmmakers to build a production chain it hopes will drastically elevate the quality of its English-language versions of foreign shows, making them seamless enough to win over more American subscribers and, in the process, significantly boost viewing of Netflix’s international offerings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
