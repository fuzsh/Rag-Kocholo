        "text": "Who would watch this film and say, you know, an hour fiddling around inventing rocket travel with some light comedy isn't enough! Forget the moon itself, I want an entire film that's just about making the rockets! Harry Alan Towers, that's who, with his production Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon made three years later, also with Lionel Jeffries. So if I am overly generous with the rating here, keep in mind that not only do they build a rocket in this one (more of a ball, really), but they take it to the moon and encounter some incredibly cool bug aliens, both of the kids-in-bug-costumes variety and stop motion. Also, a giant vicious stop motion caterpillar, all done byâ€¦\n\nFilms I Watched On TCM / Film4 While I Was 'Working'\n\nWonderful poster, wonderful title - and so nearly a wonderful film.\n\nIt's a strange thing in a sci-fi adventure such as First Men In The Moon for the bit before they actually set off on their adventure to be more fun than the adventure itself.\n\nOnce Lionel Jeffries, Edward Judd and Martha Hyer (<3) do get to the moon, this film is just not nearly as good. It dispenses with most of the delightful comedy that the first half is shot through with for a slightly disappointing tale about aliens (that looked suspiciously like Clangers) and something that didn't really make full sense to me.\n\nTo be honest, Iâ€¦\n\nQuite unlike any Harryhausen film I've seen so far. The first thing I absolutely have to mention is the very first shot of the film. In glorious 70mm, we see a beautiful model rocket orbiting the moon. Its last stage breaks off and the lander propels towards the surface. I noticed in the credits that NASA was actually consulted for the film, and you have to remember this is in the heat of the space race. Just a dazzling and shockingly accurate sequence. I was won over that quickly.\n\nAnother literary adaptation, this time of H.G. Wells novel of the same name, though it's heavily reminiscent of Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s' A Trip to the Moon. That's because the astronauts that landâ€¦\n\nIn 1964, the US and the Soviet Union had already taken their first tentative steps towards our nearest planetary neighbor. Anything seemed possible to a space-nutty kid like me back then, even the prospect of another civilization in our solar system didn't strike me as too far-fetched, so with that in mind, you can imagine how much I loved this movie the first time I saw it in a theater. Much older now, I still enjoy FMITM greatly, but I can't help but look on it with a bit more of a critical and jaundiced eye.\n\nAlthough things start off briskly with an exciting framing sequence of the first UN expedition to the Moon, that looks like it could've sprungâ€¦\n\n\"If you believe they put some men in the moon\" ðŸŽ¶ well, then you should give credit to the brilliant special effects of Ray Harryhausen.\n\nAn Elon Musk type puts his money behind someone else's hard work and travels to the moon, where he and his crew encounter a bunch of Elon Musk fans (aka overgrown insects). Finding the prospect of being overwhelmed by this fanboy swarm to be a bit much, he must then repair his ship and make his way back to Earth, presumably where he will resume being a useless shitlord with a hairline that is somehow worse than his attitude.\n\nSorry, where were we? Ah yes, The First Men in the Moon. Not on the Moon,â€¦\n\nThere's a distinctly adulterated feel to Nigel Kneale's script - I can't imagine him writing nearly an hour's worth of goofy comedy as the first half of his screenplay. I have no doubt these outdated comedy stylings will give people the cringes, but maybe I was feeling a little indulgent. The first half reminds me a lot of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in that sense, and that is such a favourite for my kids that I've developed a tolerance for anything similar. Also, I suppose Lionel Jeffries' performance should probably annoy the hell out of me but for some reason I found him incredibly funny. I guess you have to be willing to get in on the joke a bit.â€¦"
