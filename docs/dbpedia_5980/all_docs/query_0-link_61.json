        "text": "Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver has rocketed to the top of Netflix’s charts but has landed fewer viewers than its opening saga.\n\nThe film, which was released on April 19, opened with 21.4M views, making it the most-watched title of the week.\n\nHowever, it came in lower than its prequel, which managed 23.9M when it was released in December.\n\nIts launch did help the first part re-enter the film charts at number five, bringing in 5.5M views over the week. This means that Snyder has had three chart-topping films following the launch of Army of the Dead.\n\nElsewhere, the live-action/animated crossover Woody the Woodpecker Goes to Camp was number two with 18.8M views, followed by the true-crime documentary What Jennifer Did that brought in 16.3M views at number three.\n\nOn the TV side, Richard Gadd’s creepy stalker series Baby Reindeer moved to the top of Netflix’s English-language TV charts with 13.3M views. It moved up from fifth place, where it recorded 2.6M views in its first few days on the service after its April 11 launch.\n\nThe series is a lightly fictionalized account of Gadd’s own experience with a stalker, who sent him more than 40,000 emails, as well as hundreds of tweets, letters and voicemails. It stars Gadd and Jessica Gunning and comes from The End Of The F***ing World producer Clerkenwell Films, based on Gadd’s own Edinburgh Fringe one-man play.\n\nIt surpassed 3 Body Problem, which spent its fifth week on the list in third place with 3.2M views, and Guy Ritchie’s gangster series The Gentlemen, which spent its seventh week on the list in sixth place with 2.9M views. Unlocked: A Jail Experiment came in second place.\n\nElsewhere in TV, Cate Blanchett-narrated nature docuseries Our Living World was in fourth place with 3.2M views, stand-up special Jimmy Carr: Natural Born Killer was in eighth with 2.3M views, and season six of reality competition series The Circle came in ninth place with 2M views."
