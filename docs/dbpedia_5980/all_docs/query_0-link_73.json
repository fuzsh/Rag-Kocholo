        "text": "What is it about the moon that fascinates us so?\n\nSometimes, it’s a wispy sliver, like a fading dream. Other times, it hangs so low and full in the night sky it seems we could touch it. (That George Bailey quote from It’s a Wonderful Life comes to mind: “What is it you want, Mary? … You want the moon? Just say the word and I’ll throw a lasso around it and pull it down.”)\n\nThough our moon is ever changing (that’s why Shakespeare’s Juliet tells Romeo, “O, swear not by the moon, th’ inconstant moon”), in many ways it is quite dependable. Civilization’s first calendars were lunar ones. The full Harvest Moon and Hunters Moon, which are both determined by the autumn equinox, reliably provided our ancestors with extra light around sunset for a few days’ stretch during crucial times for storing up food for winter.\n\nOur moon moves oceans, and, lest we forget, it was humankind’s first steppingstone into the universe.\n\nFor the many ways la bella luna inspires us in all its glorious moon phases, it’s no wonder it has long been used as imagery in everything from love songs to romantic movies (helloooo Moonstruck!). Just take a gander at our rundown of the 75 most magnificent Moon quotes, if you doubt how inspirational all that lunar loveliness has proven for painters, poets and pop stars, not to mention philosophers and one very notable physicist, too.\n\nRead on. We guarantee you’ll be over the moon about these quotes—whether to caption an Instagram pic of the night’s gorgeous display, or simply because the moonlight has put you of a mind to relish a poetic turn of phrase.\n\nBest Moon Quotes\n\n“Like the moon, come out from behind the clouds!
