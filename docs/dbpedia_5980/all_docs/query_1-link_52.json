        "text": "Director Milos Forman teams up again with the Golden Globe-winning screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karazewski to bring a distinctive vision to \"Man on the Moon\" starring Jim Carrey as the last Andy Kaufman, who was considered one of the most innovative, eccentric and enigmatic performers of his time. A master at manipulating audiences, Kaufman could generate belly laughs, stony silence, tears or brawls. Whether inviting the audiences out for a milk and cookies or challenging women to inter-gender wrestling matches, he specialized in creating performances so real that even his close friends never sure where the truth lay. He was definitely one of America's true freaks."
