        "text": "SPY x FAMILY spoilers follow.\n\nAll families have their problems, but what about when your dad is a spy, your mum is an assassin, and your dog can see into the future? Oh, and you can also read minds, but no-one in the family knows about each other's secrets?\n\nLife in the Forger household is hectic to say the least, but the love this family shares through all these hijinks is exactly why so many fans have fallen in love with SPY x FAMILY.\n\nBut with the end of season two, what's next in store for Anya and co? The good news is that season three has officially been renewed, so grab your fake moustache and a cookbook for Yor, as we share everything you need to know about what comes next.\n\nSPY x FAMILY season 3 potential release date: When will it air?\n\nThe SPY x FAMILY team confirmed the adaptation of the hit manga will be back for a third season, sharing a first look at new poster art for the season.\n\nThe new visual shows pink-haired psychic Anya Forger peacefully sleeping atop her pet dog Bond, illuminated by various lights in her tastefully littered bedroom. Anya's adoptive parents Yor and Loid can be seen in the hall looking at the sweet scene through the door.\n\n\"We look forward to everyone's continued support with season three,\" creator Tatsuya Endo shared alongside the poster.\n\nWe don't have a release date quite yet, but check back here for all the updates once we have them.\n\nSPY x FAMILY season 3 voice cast: Who's in SPY x FAMILY season 3?\n\nAssuming all goes to plan, fans can expect to see the same English and Japanese voice actors return for season three, which means we'll be hearing a lot more from the following soon:\n\nLoid Forger - Takuya Eguchi (Japanese) / Alex Organ (English)\n\nAnya Forger - Atsumi Tanezaki (Japanese) / Megan Shipman (English)\n\nYor Forger - Saori Hayami (Japanese) / Natalie Van Sistine (English)\n\nEmile Elman - Hana Sato (Japanese) / Macy Anne Johnson (English)\n\nYuri Briar - Kenshô Ono (Japanese) / Dallas Reid (English)\n\nSylvia Sherwood - Yūko Kaida (Japanese) / Stephanie Young (English)\n\nThis same assumption can also be made for the actors who dub SPY x FAMILY in other languages too, and given the show's global popularity, there's now a whole host of them.\n\nSPY x FAMILY season 3 plot: What will happen in SPY x FAMILY season 3?\n\nThe third season of SPY x FAMILY has plenty of source material to draw from as series creator Tatsuya Endo is still a few arcs ahead in the manga.\n\nIf you don't mind some broad spoilers, here are some details on the arcs that fans can expect to see adapted in season three and beyond (depending on whether we get a full two-cour season like the first, or a single like the second).\n\nFirst up is the Friendship Schemes Arc which runs through Missions 64-68. The official synopsis reads: \"Yor makes an unlikely friend while Anya tries to improve her friendship with Damian.\"\n\nNext up is the thrilling Red Circus Arc, which accounts for Missions 69-78, with a synopsis as follows:\n\n\"On their way to a field trip, Anya's school bus gets hijacked by the Red Circus terrorist group, leaving her and her classmates to figure out a way of solving the situation without being harmed.\"\n\nIf season three speeds through those first two storylines, there's a chance that the 'Mole Hunt Arc' may also come into play sooner rather than later. Missions 79-81 cover the following:\n\n\"The lives of Westalian agents in Ostania are put at risk after a mysterious mole steals classified documents, including information about Operation Strix. The intelligence services of the two countries begin the pursuit of the thief and the stolen files in the hope of getting to them first.\"\n\nIf you're keen to get ahead of the anime, these missions are all available to read in full via Endo's best-selling manga.\n\nSPY x FAMILY season 3 trailer: When can I see it?\n\nWhile season three has now been officially announced, we don't have any new footage quite yet.\n\nWithout Bond's precognitive powers, we can't even tell you exactly what said footage will contain. Just know that a third season is on the cards.\n\nSPY x FAMILY season 3 streaming: How can I watch it?\n\nA basic Crunchyroll membership is free, giving you limited access to its library of shows (usually only subtitled versions) with adverts.\n\ninclude £4.99/$7.99 for the 'Fan' tier, which lets you watch new shows without adverts just an hour after they air in Japan, and the 'Mega Fan' tier for £5.99/$9.99 which lets you download shows for offline viewing and lets you stream on up to four devices at the same time.\n\nSubscribers can save 16% by paying upfront for a 12-month subscription to Crunchyroll for £59.99.\n\nBut if you've not signed up before, or only have a free account, you're in luck! Crunchyroll free trials are currently available for new, non-paying members – giving you free access to the premium perks for 14 days.\n\nSPY x FAMILY is available to watch on .\n\n.."
