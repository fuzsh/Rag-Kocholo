        "text": "Moon on the Man is an observational and exploratory feature length documentary that questions the most basic assumptions of reality, perception and choices. As such, it is synonymous with every individual’s struggle to find direction, some that bear fruit in the ever-evolving landscape of human perspectives and others that segue into mental illness, old age and broken dreams.\n\nPrince Shah has worked as assistant director in Tenet, Mission Impossible – Ghost Protocol (India Schedule), Gandhi Of The Month, Talaash, Sense8 (India Schedule), Gully Boy, The Best Is Yet To Come (India Schedule) and Desert Dolphin. He made his first short film A Better Bargain and a music video for the 48 Hour Film Project, with the latter winning an award. For another short film 2733 See You On The Other Side, he won the Audience Choice Award at the prestigious Mumbai Academy of Moving Images Festival (MAMI Festival 2011). He has also been directing digital films and Music videos besides TV commercials."
