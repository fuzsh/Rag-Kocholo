        "text": "C’ ‘na luna mezz’u mare\n\nMamma mia m’a maritare\n\nFiglia mia a cu te dare\n\nMamma mia pensace tu!\n\nOne of my earliest memories from my childhood is of when my dad used to play CDs of old Italian songs during car rides. He would tell me that these were the songs my grandfather, whose own parents came to America from Naples, loved to listen to a long time ago. Even then, I loved listening to these songs that were in a completely different language, despite the fact that I was still trying to get a grasp on English. After all, I loved the idea that I was listening to something that my grandpa listened to in another time; I loved my grandpa very much and I think that made me feel more connected to him.\n\nOne of the songs my dad would play was Luna Mezzo Mare, or “Moon Amid the Sea” in English. This was an old folk song that has been recorded by many singers over the years and is popular at Italian weddings due to its story of a girl asking her mother to find her a man to marry. The version I specifically remember my dad playing was by the Italian-American singer Lou Monte and carried the additional title of Lazy Mary. This version contained a verse in English for, in Monte’s words, those who “don’t understand the I-talian language” (“Italian” pronounced “eye-talian,” here. It still makes me cringe.) So, naturally, as a kid I didn’t think I was listening to anything different; it was a song in Italian that my Italian grandpa used to listen to, and that was that.\n\nIt was only very recently that I realized that this was the very first time I heard an endangered language.\n\nNot too long ago, I watched my favorite film, The Godfather, for the first time (and then maybe a bazillion more times since then). The opening scene of the film features a lavish wedding for Connie Corleone, the daughter of Don Vito Corleone. At one point, Connie’s mother is pulled in front of a microphone on the dance floor to sing a song. And what does she sing?\n\nI hadn’t heard the song in maybe 15 years, but I immediately remembered. Before I knew it, I had a huge smile on my face as my oldest childhood memory came rushing back to me. The innocence of this memory was then subsequently tainted by my learning that this song is full of innuendos after a Google search of the lyrics’ English translation. This is visually represented by the old man who follows Mrs. Corleone at the mic thrusting his hands from side to side. But that’s beside the point.\n\nThe Corleone family is of Sicilian descent. This region of Italy is home to its own language that is, according to Ethnologue, distinct enough from standard Italian to be considered its own language.[1] The language is featured throughout much of the movie as well, so I began to wonder about the language of the song. I tried to dive deeper into what exact language I heard so long ago, and couldn’t really come up with a more definitive answer than “not standard Italian.”\n\nWhat I found was that Luna Mezzo Mare has roots stretching back as far as 1835 in a Neapolitan tarantella called La Danza, by composer Gioachino Rossini. The song underwent many changes over the years that followed: the more innuendo-heavy version began circulating around Italy in 1871, and in 1927, a version was arranged and recorded by a Sicilian, Paolo Citorello, for New York City’s Italian Book Company.[2]\n\nSo the song was born from a text that was originally Neapolitan. This, like Sicilian, is another language of Italy that is distinct from standard Italian. The song travelled across Italy over decades and picked up Sicilian influence along the way, and when it made its way into America in the 20th century, it was rearranged and recorded by a handful of Italian-American singers. But what language did the version I first encountered as a child belong to? I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t secretly hoping for it to be decisively Neapolitan and to suddenly have a newfound link between this song, my grandfather, and my heritage, as my grandfather’s Neapolitan parents surely would have spoken this language. In search of the answer, I sent the Lou Monte version to a former grad school professor and long-time advisor of mine, who has done many studies on the languages of Italy. She informed me that in America, the various languages of Italy blended to form a kind of pidgin, or a simplified means of communication where vocabulary and grammar are drawn from several languages. So, it may not be clear as to which language this version belongs. It may not even be correct to assume it definitively belongs to any one Italian language; it is the product of decades of linguistic interaction.\n\nAnyone who immigrated to America from Italy most likely brought with them the language of the region they came from. Often, these regional languages carry the misconception of being “dialects” of Italian. That would imply that Italian existed first, and regional varieties of this standard developed throughout Italy. In reality, these regional languages predate standard Italian; standard Italian itself is based on a dialect of Tuscan, one of these regional languages. Neapolitan, the language of my great-grandparents and beyond, Sicilian, the language featured in The Godfather, and all the other regional Romance languages of Italy evolved from Latin. (The keyword here is Romance, there are other languages in Italy officially recognized as regional Italian languages but belong to different language families, like the Germanic Mòcheno language or the Arbëresh language, related to Albanian.)[3]\n\nIn short, the development of the regional languages of Italy was not like this…\n\nbut a little more like this…\n\n(In an extremely condensed sense, of course.)\n\nAs for the endangerment status of the languages surrounding Luna Mezzo Mare, Sicilian is included in the UNESCO Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger as “Vulnerable,” defined by the fact that “most children speak the language, but it may be restricted to certain domains.”[4] As for Neapolitan, it is not included in the UNESCO atlas but is classified as “Developing” on Ethnologue, meaning “the language is in vigorous use, with literature in a standardized form being used by some though this is not yet widespread or sustainable.”[5] (Note: Both of these definitions pertain to the classifications of “Vulnerable” and “Developing” and are not given exclusively as descriptions of Sicilian and Neapolitan.)\n\nThe Endangered Language Alliance notes that Neapolitan is being passed on to younger generations less and less, due to the overpowering prestige of standard Italian. They bring attention to unique linguistic features of Neapolitan that separate it from Italian, such as the doubling of initial consonants in certain syntactic positions.[6] For example:\n\n’o nnapulitano (Neapolitan language)\n\n’o napulitano (Neapolitan man)\n\nNeapolitan has three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Since the singular definite article for both the masculine and neuter is ‘o, the initial consonant of the neuter word is doubled to make the semantic distinction in speech.[7]\n\nSicilian is facing a similar problem where the dominance of Italian in the media is making Sicilian less relevant to younger people. Its development is characterized by a history of influence from surrounding languages. Sicily endured invasion and occupation by the Romans, Arabs, and Norman French. Below is a chart outlining some examples of how Arabic left its mark on Sicilian:[8]\n\nSo, despite my mixed findings on Luna Mezzo Mare, I still chalk this up as my first encounter with an endangered language. It has origins in two endangered languages of Italy, and given the later development of my passion in endangered languages, I found the fact that I had my first encounter with them unknowingly at a young age to be pretty cool. Not only that, but the first ones I encountered had connections to my own cultural heritage.\n\nO cummà ca m’ voglio marità\n\nTrovame ‘na uagliotta Ca me voglio marità\n\nTrovame ‘na uagliotta Ca me voglio marità\n\nTrovame ‘na uagliotta Ca me voglio marità\n\nHey!\n\nFor a video of Neapolitan being spoken (Neapolitan and English subtitles) – https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lugnI8Yq9yI\n\nFor a video of Sicilian being spoken (Sicilian and English subtitles) – https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7LAEd5CRYo\n\nFor more on the languages of Italy and the differences between regional languages and standard Italian – https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e34M6P1NXYM\n\n[1] Ethnologue entry on Sicilian – https://www.ethnologue.com/language/scn\n\n[2] Behind The Hits Story: Lazy Mary – https://web.archive.org/web/20100328102035/http://www.bobshannon.com/stories/lazymaryback.html\n\n[3] Languages of Italy – https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Italy\n\n[4] Sicilian – UNESCO Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger (“vulnerable” definition found by clicking on “more on vitality”) http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php?hl=en&page=atlasmap&lid=1023\n\n[5] Ethnologue classification of Napoletano-Calabrese – https://www.ethnologue.com/cloud/nap\n\n[6] Neapolitan – Endangered Language Alliance – http://elalliance.org/languages/italian/neapolitan/\n\n[7] Neapolitan language – http://www.scuolitalia.com/1/wiki/neapolitan.htm"
