        "text": "2021 | 75 mins | English and Hindi | India\n\nMoon on the Man is an observational and exploratory feature length documentary that questions the most basic assumptions of reality, perception and choices. As such, it is synonymous with every individual’s struggle to find direction, some that bear fruit in the ever-evolving landscape of human perspectives and others that segue into mental illness, old age and broken dreams.\n\nThe film looks at two eccentric personalities Praklawn and Sailesh, through their stories, life experiences and their everyday activities. This narrative is annexed by Aasif and Wadood at a juncture when the stories of Praklawn and Sailesh enter into the realms of magic realism. They scrutinize Praklawn’s and Sailesh’s eventful past and their debate on the men’s life throws open a Pandora’s box which questions the very nature of our reality.\n\nThe screening of the film will be followed by a discussion with Director, Prince Shah and Filmmaker, Sunanda Bhat. A Q&A with the audience will follow.\n\nCredits:\n\nDirector: Prince Shah\n\nCinematographer: Vaibhav Sorte\n\nEditors: Ashish Ranglani, Prince Shah\n\nMusic Composer: Prassanna Vishwanathan\n\nSound: Tarun Bhandari\n\nGrade: Kabir Nagranee\n\nProducers: Anshul Pandey, Prince Shah\n\nIn collaboration with:"
