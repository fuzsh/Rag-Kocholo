        "text": "Fritz Lang’s last silent film, “Die Frau im Mond” (1929), known in English as “Woman in the Moon,” was also a first — the earliest movie to depict space travel as a realistic possibility.\n\nThe film impressed even those familiar with newfangled talking pictures. The New York Times reported that Lang’s movie, titled “By Rocket to the Moon” on its United States release in 1931, gave audiences “a breathtaking jaunt into the mysteries of interstellar communication.”\n\nIf Georges Méliès ’s silent fantasy “A Trip to the Moon” was the “Star Wars” of 1902, it can be said that “Woman in the Moon” was the “2001: A Space Odyssey” of 1929. Lang’s movie was at once pedantically scientific and outlandishly speculative — a spectacle low on human interest and high on cutting-edge special effects, some developed by the avant-garde animator Oskar Fischinger. “Motion picture technology celebrates its triumph,” a German reviewer wrote.\n\nWorking from a novel by his wife, Thea von Harbou, Lang sought the imprimatur of Hermann Oberth, whose 1923 book, “The Rocket Into Interplanetary Space,” fueled a German craze for spaceflight. Oberth and his young disciple, the science writer Willy Ley, served as technical advisers, adding weight to von Harbou’s flimsy story about a privately funded rocket , with an unconventional crew, in search of gold on the moon. As a favor to Oberth, and as a publicity ploy, Lang helped finance a planned rocket launch to celebrate the movie’s premiere. (Although the proposal fizzled out, Oberth was later recruited by the Nazi missile program and contributed to the development of the V-2 rocket.)\n\n“Woman in the Moon” begins as an energetic, if routine, reprise of Lang’s previous film, “Spies” (1928). The first half is largely devoted to criminal conspiracy. A gang of plutocrats, fronted by a master of disguise and suave thuggery named Turner (played by German cinema’s favorite villain, Fritz Rasp), plot to steal a rocket designed by an aging mad scientist from his earnest young protégé, the entrepreneurial astrophysicist Helius (the popular leading man Willy Fritsch).\n\nAs a counterpoint to the assorted burglaries and deceptions, the movie establishes a romantic triangle involving Helius and his two assistants, the cowardly Windegger (Gustav von Wangenheim, the hapless hero of “Nosferatu”) and the courageous Frieda (the Croatian actress Gerda Maurus). As resourceful as she is noble, Frieda had managed to produce close-up movies of the lunar surface, which resembles something grown in a petri dish. Amid much talk of trajectory, velocity and the “weightless zone,” a lunar expedition is organized that will involve all five of the principals and a young stowaway, first seen reading a science fiction pulp magazine.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
