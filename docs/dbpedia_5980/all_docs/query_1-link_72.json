        "text": "Der Mondmann, or Moon Man, is a quirky new children's animation from Germany, now redubbed into English, based on the 1967 picture book by the French illustrator Tomi Ungerer. The movie has an oddball charm and innocence; it is like a footnote to Spielberg's ET, and looks to me a little like Astrid Henning-Jensen's 1940s children's fantasy Palle Alone in the World, a movie featured in Mark Cousins's recent cine-essay A Story of Children and Film. The man in the moon makes a trip to Earth, which is governed by a preposterous megalomaniac \"President\", who is himself obsessed with conquering the moon, and bullies a reclusive scientist into inventing a \"rocket\" to help him to get up there. Weirdly, despite its lack of progress with space-travel technology, this alternative-reality Earth appears to have drive-in cinemas and pre-broadband dialup internet. The man in the moon realises his visit has put things out of joint and might need to commandeer the President's hubristic space-craft for the return journey. It's a sweet, eccentric film, with some interestingly adult moments in the way it portrays the President's private life – and some wacky Pink Floydish visuals at the end. An interesting alternative to Hollywood entertainment."
