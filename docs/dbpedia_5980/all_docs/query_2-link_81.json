        "text": "As Zack Snyder’s Justice League previously proved, when filmmakers Zack and Deborah Snyder embark on creating director’s cuts of their films, fans are in for a whole new experience.\n\nThe latest films to get the deluxe treatment in the Snyders' movie universe are the first two parts of their Netflix sci-fi opus, Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire and Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver. Both rated PG-13, Part One was released on Netflix in December of 2023 while Part Two debuted on the streamer in April.\n\nNew on Netflix Friday, the director’s cuts of both films—which are both rated R—have new titles and longer run times to allow for more narrative depth and character development.\n\nAs such, Chapter One: Chalice of Blood, runs 3 hours, 24 minutes and is 1 hour and 8 minutes longer than Part One: A Child of Fire. Meanwhile, Chapter Two: The Curse of Forgiveness runs 2 hours, 53 minutes, which is 50 minutes longer than Part Two: The Scargiver.\n\nIn a Zoom conversation on Monday with the husband-and-wife filmmaking team, Zack and Deborah Snyder detailed for me how a lot more went into the making of the director’s cuts than just adding scenes here and there to the original films.\n\n“I feel like the thing that's incredible about this process—that was surprising—was that we made four movies,” Zack Snyder said. “People may think that like, ‘Oh, well, you just knocked the director's cuts out. They're just the same movie and you just added a couple of shots’ but they are literally four different movies. So, we really had to approach [the films] that way. It just took a lot of effort—more effort than we thought.”\n\nAt the heart of both the original and director’s cuts of Rebel Moon is Kora (Sofia Boutella). As a young girl, Kora was torn from her home and raised to be a soldier under the tyrannical rule of Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee) and his militaristic empire known as the Imperium, which is located in a collection of planets called the Motherworld.\n\nForbes'Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire' Debuts Big On Netflix Global Top 10 Chart\n\nWhen Kora manages to escape the brutality of the Imperium, she eventually finds peace and a path to healing on the distant moon of Veldt where a farming community harvests grain.\n\nKora’s new existence is torn apart, however, when a large Imperium contingent under the command of the sadistic Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) arrives and quickly brutalizes Veldt’s leadership.\n\nNoble lays down a mandate where the farmers of Veldt produce more grain to feed his soldiers than they can possibly supply—a move that would essentially leave the moon’s inhabitants to starve to death. Knowing first-hand how lethal the Imperium is, Kora assembles a band of rebels to try to stop the army from not only seizing Veldt but to defeat their oppressors altogether.\n\nBoutella Embodied All Of Makings Of A Snyder Hero\n\nDeborah and Zack Snyder said they love everything Sofia Boutella brought to Kora because she embodies all of the heroic attributes—and flaws—of the protagonists in their movies. As such, Deborah Snyder is proud of the way Zack Snyder has always taken great care in the construction of each of their stories’ female characters and how Boutella latched on to all of Kora’s complexities.\n\n“Kora is a strong character, but also a character that lives in the gray, who's done things that have been bad and who can't forgive herself,” Deborah Snyder said. “I think oftentimes in action and sci-fi, the women characters are very one-dimensional. So, it's really refreshing to have a character that has flaws—that's on a journey of redemption and has done some very questionable if not really horrible things—and to have her come back and become this hero.”\n\nUltimately, Deborah Snyder was thrilled at the effort Boutella put in to embodying Kora.\n\n“Sophia worked so hard, I mean, physically as well as emotionally, really wanting to understand the nuances of her character,” the producer said. “I love her so much as a person and as an actor.”\n\nThe R-Rated Versions Of ‘Rebel Moon’ Are About More Than Blood And Gore\n\nWithout question, the biggest difference between the original, PG-13 versions of the Rebel Moon movies and the R-rated director’s cuts is that there were no limits in terms of the films’ mature content.\n\nAs such, both director’s cut versions of Rebel Moon earned their R ratings from the Motion Pictures Association because of “strong bloody violence and gore throughout, strong sexuality, nudity and some language.”\n\nDeborah Snyder said the director’s cuts weren’t made solely for the sake of creating mayhem, even though she admits seeing the blood and gore in some instances makes the movies more fun to watch. More importantly, she explained, the expanded versions of the films give her and the director a chance to flesh out the story's huge ensemble of characters.\n\n“[The director’s cuts are] more fun in a way, and more ironic and it's more satirical. They’re all those things,” Deborah Snyder said. “And for me, you can talk about the violence and you can talk about the gore and the sex or whatever, but I think it's the character development that you have more of because we didn't have any time constraints.\n\n“So, you really get the arcs of the characters to me are much more fulfilling, because you're seeing a little bit in each scene that we had to cut out [of the original films] to keep it to a certain length,” she added.\n\nAnother reason the Snyders wanted to deliver director’s cuts of the first two Rebel Moon films is because they realize there’s a demand for them from viewers. The record-breaking debut of a film like Deadpool & Wolverine, for example, shows more than ever that there’s an appetite for R-rated content.\n\n“There's so much now in the marketplace with the streamers and there's so much material that there's an extra need for something extra,” Zack Snyder observed. “I think that people are ready for it and are saying, ‘Really show me something. Really give me an experience. I need a full experience.’”\n\nIn addition to getting the opportunity to make movies with unrestricted content, Zack Snyder is happy that filmmakers like his Man of Steel producer Christopher Nolan have all the runtime that they need to accomplish his storytelling goal.\n\n“Oppenheimer is a good example of movies that really go all the way,” Zack Snyder said. “I think that that's what people are looking for—a real rich and thorough experience in a movie that doesn't play it safe … People are thinking, ‘Well, we're here. Let's go. We're ready. We're sophisticated.’”\n\nThe director’s cuts of the Snyders’ films—Rebel Moon - Chapter One: Chalice of Blood and Rebel Moon – Chapter Two: The Curse of Forgiveness—are streaming exclusively on Netflix.\n\nForbesHow Many F-Bombs Are There In 'Deadpool & Wolverine'?\n\nNote: This interview was edited for clarity."
