        "text": "The claim: Video implies moon landings were faked\n\nSome social media users are sharing a video that implies NASA's crewed moon landings were faked.\n\nThe video features a montage of people in astronaut suits on a moon-like landscape. However, some of the scenes in the video appear to be from a movie set and were clearly not captured on the moon.\n\nFor instance, astronauts are shown attached to stage wires or standing with individuals dressed in plain clothes.\n\nIn addition to other commentary, a vocal track on the video states, \"What I'd like to talk about for a few minutes today is the so-called 'moon hoax,' the belief that we never actually landed on the moon.\"\n\nA July 20 Instagram post featuring the video garnered more than 9,500 interactions in a week.\n\n\"How do you build trust with someone who's been caught in a lie,\" reads the post's caption. Text on the video says, \"You can tell us now. We already know.\"\n\nRather than exposing a moon landing hoax, however, the clips in the video showing staged moon scenes are behind-the-scenes footage from the Ryan Gosling film, First Man.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the social media user who shared the post for comment.\n\nFollow us on Facebook!

The other is called \"FIRST MAN | VFX Featurette | DNEG\" and was uploaded Jan. 3, 2019.\n\nEvidence that the NASA crewed moon landings occurred includes photos and videos captured by astronauts on the moon as well as modern satellite photos documenting past lunar activity.\n\nThe video was previously debunked by Lead Stories.\n\nFact check: WikiLeaks did not release footage that proves moon landing staged\n\nOur rating: Missing context\n\nBased on our research, we rate MISSING CONTEXT the claim that a video implies moon landings were faked.
