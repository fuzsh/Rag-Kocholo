        "text": "New Delhi: Bollywood actor Karan Singh Grover recently got married to his lady love Bipasha Basu. Their wedding has been the talk of the town since a while.\n\nThe couple got married as per the Bengali tradition on April 30. Their wedding was followed by a grand reception which was a star-studded affair.\n\nThough, Karan and Bipaha seem to be much in love with each other, however, this is not the first time that the ‘Hate Story 3’ actor is walking down the aisle.\n\nKaran has been married twice earlier. In fact, he just got divorced from his second wife Jennifer Winget this Februaury.\n\nWhen his first wife Shraddha Nigam was quizzed about his third wedding, the actress said that she wishes Karan all the luck for his wedding and life ahead.\n\nKaran married Shraddha on December 2, 2008, however, their marriage survived just for 10 months before they got divorced in 2009.\n\nEarlier, Karan’s second wife too had sent her best wishes for him and his new bride Bipasha.\n\nTalking about her married life with Karan, Jennifer had said, “It was an experience, and an amazing roller-coaster ride. There were some happy and sad moments. But I know that I gave my 500% (to my marriage), and no one can point a finger at me. I don't regret a single day of my life. But, s**t happens. I don't feel bitter or hold any grudges. I am in a happy space. People might think otherwise, but that's not the case,” she added."
