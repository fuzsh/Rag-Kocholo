He was heard saying:\n\n\"I wasn't a professional actor. So, I can't say that, but I'm not the kind of person who would go and justify anything to anybody because I don't need to. I'm not somebody who gets bothered if people think good or bad about me. It's ok. It's their choice. It's their life. It is not even coming into my force field.\"\n\nAlso Read: Shatrughan Sinha Rubbishes Reports Of Him Being Miffed About Sonakshi's Wedding, 'I'll Be There...'\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nKaran reveals why he never spoke about his ugly separations\n\nSpeaking along the same lines, Karan shared that a breakup or a divorce is always bad, but it happens for the best.

Whoever's in her life stays connected with her. All the heavy, all the negative, the lower vibration stuff just falls. I have another profession (he has also started painting) because of her. She helped me understand and connect with me. The real me. I know myself today because of her. The change that has happened is so drastic.
