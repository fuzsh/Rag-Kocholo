        "text": "Karan Singh Grover, who started his career as a model has become a prominent name in the television industry, but his life is no less than a dramatic film. Thanks to all the controversies he’s been a part of.\n\nHere is the compilation of some of his most talked-about controversies.\n\n1. The ‘Slap’ By Jennifer\n\nWhen Karan and his ex-wife Jennifer Winget were allegedly dating, it was reported that Jennifer slapped Karan on the sets of Dill Mill Gayye when she found out that Karan was cheating on her. Reportedly, Karan was cheating on her with Nicole and Shraddha.\n\n2. His ‘Multiple’ Affairs\n\nKaran got married to Shraddha Nigam, but the couple got divorced just after 10 months of their wedding. The reason was Karan's attraction towards the 'other women'. It compelled Shraddha to part ways with the Alone star.\n\n3. The ‘Tantrumatic’ Karan\n\nKaran Singh Grover reportedly got cast out of a project named Qubool Hai due to his starry tantrums and unprofessionalism during the shoot.\n\nAllegedly, Karan used to come late on sets and leave without informing anyone. The story of the show had to be changed several times because of him.\n\n4. The ‘Drunk’ Alone Karan\n\nAccording to a DNA report, Karan Singh Grover reached the trailer launch event of her debut film Alone drunk and in an inebriated state. So much so that he was about to fall down on Bipasha’s gown.\n\nKaran Singh Grover starred in many Television series and reality shows such as; Kasautii Zindagy Kay, Dill Mill Gayye, Nach Baliye 3, Parrivaar and then married Bollywood’s dusky beauty Bipasha Basu after filing a divorce with then-wife Jennifer, who is also a renowned television star.\n\nIt seems like Bipasha was pretty lucky for Karan because while they were dating, Karan did two films and one of them proved to be a commercial success."
