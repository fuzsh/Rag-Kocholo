        "text": "Actor Karan Singh Grover is one of the popular celebrities from the television industry who forayed into Bollywood and has had a good innings. However, more than his acting career, he remained in the headlines for his personal life, failed marriages and marriage with BTown diva Bipasha Basu. Earlier, Grover remained tight-lipped about his failed marriages. However, recently, for the first time, he broke his silence about his failed marriages with Jennifer Winget and Shraddha Nigam.\n\nDuring an interview with Times Of India, Grover was asked about his divorce. To this, he replied, “There’s nothing good about a breakup or a divorce.”\n\nFurther, he also said that people move on and realise that it happened for the best, which is a good thing.\n\nNotably, after marrying Bipasha Basu, Grover, for the first time, opened up about his failed marriages. To this, Grover said that he never needed to speak to anyone about what was happening in his life. He also added that he doesn't expect anyone to come and talk to him and share their life problems with him.\n\n“That is not my main motive,” he said, and added, “I would like to spread some love and joy. Everyone has their own s**t to deal with and I think everyone deserves that kind of privacy to handle their own s**t,” said Grover.\n\nMore from the Author | All is well!

Later, he met actress Jennifer Winget while shooting for Dill Mill Gayye, and they started dating. They tied the knot in 2012. However, they filed for divorce after 10 months of their marriage. After that Grover met Bipasha Basu in 2015 on the sets of Alone. They fell in love and tied the knot on April 30, 2016. They welcomed their daughter Devi in November 2022.\n\nTalking about his marriage with Bipasha, Grover said that the marriage transformed him.\n\n“I know myself today because of her. The change that has happened is so drastic,” he said.\n\nFurther, the Fighter actor shared that he used to be a “nocturnal being” before his life changed for the good. But, now he wakes up at 5 a.m., wanting to see every sunrise and every sunset."
