        "text": "Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover tied the knot last month. And ever since, their fans and social-media followers have been treated to the fairytale wedding that the two had. From pre-wedding photoshoot giving people major relationship goals to honeymoon snaps leaving people to battle envy big time, Bipasha and Karan have made sure theirs was a wedding to remember.\n\nALSO READ: Karan Singh Grover's message for wife Bipasha Basu\n\nadvertisement\n\nALSO READ: Here's what Karan Singh Grover's first wife Shraddha Nigam has to say about his marriage to Bipasha Basu\n\nNow, nearly a month after their big fat Bollywood wedding, Bipasha and Karan shared titbits from their married life in an interview to the Times of India. Among other things, Bipasha was asked whether Karan's earlier marriages bothered her. For the uninitiated, Karan Singh Grover was married to TV actors Shraddha Nigam and Jennifer Winget.\n\nSeveral people were cynical when Karan and Bipasha announced that they were indeed getting married. It was Karan's third marriage, after all. Howver, none of it bothers Bipasha.\n\nBipasha told the daily, \"It didn't bother me and we spoke about it. I believe that everyone has a journey, and it is very easy for anyone to exclaim, \"Oh... this is his third marriage, nahin chalega... divorce ho jaayega.\" I tell people that you have to be in someone's shoes to know their story and understand their journey. This world is full of cynics, and thankfully, I have never been cynical no matter what has happened in my life. I have always been a believer. And Karan is like that, too.\n\nThe Raaz 3 actor went on to say, \"I feel I am lucky, as I live only for love. And no man has given me more love and respect than Karan. I might not be looking for the same thing in marriage, like others do. I have my own checklist, and I have ticked my boxes accordingly. And I believe you can't judge anyone for their bad relationships. I have had bad relationships, and I could have been easily married twice. The relationship could have been as deep, but I didn't fall into the legality and that is the only difference. You can't condemn someone on the basis of a piece of paper.\"\n\nBipasha and Karan first met on the sets of the 2015 film Alone, and dated for more than a year before tying the knot."
