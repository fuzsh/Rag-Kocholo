        "text": "The inevitable elements that tie a marriage together are commitment and fidelity. The purity of love marriage is when you fall for each other, and you promise to preserve the endearment and warmth for each other all life-long.\n\nBollywood marriages of love often end badly in divorce. Blame the glamour industry's dark side. Here we carry six of the famous and 'juicy' Bollywood stars' failed marriages and their falling in love (and several of them marrying yet again) aftermaths.\n\nMalaika Arora, Arbaaz Khan\n\nArbaaz Khan and Malaika Arora split in 2016 after 18 years of marriage. They were married for 22 years. They have a baby together and have joint custody of the child. The couple is still close and often seen together.\n\nThe two remain a part of each other's lives, and are frequently seen going out and vacationing together. However, Malaika Arora has moved on and is currently seen dating actor Arjun Kapoor, while Arbaaz Khan has been spotted with Giorgia Andriani on numerous occasions.\n\nFarhan Akhtar, Adhuna Akhtar\n\nFarhan Akhtar and Adhuna Akhtar, divorcing after 15 years of marriage, have stories of couples having difficulty in their partnership. The couples begged the media to provide them with anonymity and keep their kids out of it. In January 2016, the Akhtar's released a joint resolution declaring their split, and in 2017 there was a divorce.\n\nAt present, Farhan is 'going strong' with VJ, actor and Indi-pop singer Shibani Dandekar, while Adhuna is dating Dino Morea's brother, Nicolo Morea.\n\nAnurag Kashyap, Kalki Koechlin\n\nThe couple separated and began living separately for more than a year, but the two were recently granted a divorce. They fell in love while working in the movie 'Dev D' in 2009 and got married in 2011. But they parted ways with a mutual divorce in 2015.\n\nKalki is now blessed with a baby with her boyfriend, Guy Hershberg, while Kashyap was last rumored to be in a relationship with a 23-year-old Shubhra Shetty, who was an assistant director at his production company, Phantom.\n\nKaran Singh Grover, Jennifer Winget\n\nThe two of them became one of small screen's most beloved couples, but it didn't last long. Karan began dating his solo co-star Bipasha Basu after the split, whom he finally married on April 30, 2016. Karan was married to actress Shraddha Nigam for around a year before Jennifer, and the two divorced in 2009. And to date, he is 'happily married' with our very own Bengali beauty 'Bips', aka Bipasha Basu.\n\nSaif Ali Khan, Amrita Singh\n\nThe love tale of both of them, from faith to age disparities, was packed with several variations. Twelve years older than Saif was Amrita. The two of them got married without Saif's kin's consent, but their friendship was not so good! And Saif and Amrita had a highly-publicised split after 13 years of marital life and two children later on.\n\nBut it's not all that! Saif tied a knot with none other than our very own 'Bebo' (Kareena Kapoor) and is a happy dad of 'portfolio boy' Taimur as the couple welcomes another baby.\n\nAamir Khan, Reena Dutta\n\nAamir and Reena tied the knot in 1986 and remained together for 15 years until they split. It is not established the proper explanation behind the divorced, though many suspect that it could be Aamir's friendship with Kiran Rao that triggered the pair's split.\n\nAamir married Kiran Rao later on. After the split, Aamir and Reena remain good friends. Together, they have two childrenâ€” Ira and Junaid."
