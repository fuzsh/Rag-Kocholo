        "text": "Karan Singh Grover’s reaction to his divorce from Jennifer Winget has been one of contemplation and openness about the personal challenges they both faced during their separation. Karan has spoken about the difficult nature of breakups and how, despite the pain, they can lead to personal growth and a better understanding of oneself. He acknowledged the heavy emotional toll it took on both him and Jennifer, expressing a sentiment that breakups are inherently challenging but also opportunities for personal development​ (Hindustan Times)​​ (Bollywood Hungama)​.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Dishi Sanghvi (@dishisanghvii)\n\nOn the other hand, Jennifer Winget has been very candid about her feelings during the separation. She described feeling lost and overwhelmed by the public nature of their divorce, which was compounded by the invasion of privacy from media and public speculation. This period was particularly stressful for her, and she retreated from public attention, focusing on her work to cope with the situation. Over time, Jennifer viewed this phase as transformative, helping her emerge stronger and more resilient, referring to her post-divorce phase as becoming “Jennifer 2.0,” a period where she rediscovered herself and her strengths​ (India Today)​.\n\nBoth Karan and Jennifer have since moved forward with their lives, with Karan marrying actress Bipasha Basu and Jennifer continuing her successful career in television. Their experiences highlight the personal and often public struggles that come with celebrity divorces, reflecting on the growth and new beginnings that can emerge from such challenging times."
