        "text": "Karan Singh Grover: Do you know the Dill Mill Gayye actor has a degree in Hotel Management?\n\nBorn on February 23, 1982, Karan Singh Grover's birthplace is New Delhi but he has been raised in Saudi Arabia after his family shifted Al Khobar. He completed his schooling in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, and moved to Mumbai to pursue a degree in Hotel Management from IHM Mumbai. However, Karan moved to Oman to work as a Marketing Executive in the Sheraton Hotel. (All photos/mid-day archives and Karan Singh Grover's official Instagram account)\n\nKaran Singh Grover was 22 when he started his career with MTV show Kitni Mast Hai Zindagi. \"I started my career in showbiz as a model but I didn't do well. I was actually a hotel management student and was also working at a hotel in Muscat and today I am an actor. It all depends on the luck and that's why I don't plan my career,\" said Karan in a candid interview, earlier.\n\nIn picture: Karan Singh Grover with his parents - Amrita Pal Singh and Deepa Singh\n\nKaran Singh Grover was 26 when he married actress Shraddha Nigam in 2008. However, the marriage ended in a divorce barely 10 months later due to his alleged flirtatious nature.\n\nWhile his first marriage ended too soon, his professional was about to flourish as he starred in the show Dill Mill Gayye, a medical youth drama. Grover as Dr Armaan Malik became an instant hit and teen's favourite!\n\nThanks to his growing popularity, he appeared on reality shows like Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa and Fear Factor - Khatron Ke Khiladi. Karan was soon linked with Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa choreographer Nicole Alvares after he was spotted with her in public at various.\n\nIn 2012, Karan Singh Grover tied the knot with his 'Dill Mill Gayye' co-star Jennifer Winget. However, in two years, the couple announced their separation.\n\n\"For all those who are concerned, you might have heard that Jennifer and I have separated and will soon be getting divorced. I just wanted to confirm that it's true. The decision has been mutually agreed upon and the reasons are too personal to share. What happens between only two people know... All else are merely speculations and assumptions...,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nTalking about the qualities turn him on in a woman, Karan Singh Grover, in an exclusive chat with mid-day said, \"I dislike impolite women. Courtesy and grace are two qualities that make a woman perfect. My perfect girl should always talk politely to others and show consideration towards people. She should treat people well.\"\n\nAnd well, in 2015, Karan Singh Grover finally found his perfect match. Karan Singh Grover and Bipasha Basu met on the sets of their erotic-thriller Alone in 2015 where they played the lead roles. While shooting for Alone, Karan, whose marriage to Jennifer Winget was on the rocks, was quick to find solace in Bips. Incidentally, during the same phase, Bipasha broke up with her then-beau Harman Baweja amid alleged rumours of Harman cheating on her.\n\nKaran Singh Grover celebrated his 34th birthday in February 2016 with Bipasha Basu in Goa. On the same day, coincidentally, Karan and his second wife Jennifer Winget got divorced.\n\nBipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover tied the knot on April 30, 2016, in Mumbai. The couple will celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary this year, but their social media pictures filled with mush will make you believe that they are a newly married couple.\n\nAfter two failed marriages, Karan Singh Grover said he found his best friend, wife, and boss in actress Bipasha Basu. \"Bipasha is my best friend and I actually consider her my boss. She is one of the strongest women I have ever met, and the way she juggles between work and home, I can hardly imagine doing all of it. She's definitely got the skills of a boss and I love to follow her orders. In fact, I have to,\" Karan quipped.\n\nOn the work front, after a decade-long successful career on the small screen, Karan Singh Grover made his Bollywood debut in 2015 with the film Alone and then did Hate Story 3 and 3 Dev. The switch didn't pan out well for him, but he feels experimenting must never stop.\n\nIn 2019, Karan Singh Grover made his web debut with the ALT Balaji's show Boss: Baap of Special Services, opposite Sagarika Ghatge.\n\nHe even made a comeback of sorts to the silver screen as Rishabh Bajaj in the television show Kasautii Zindagii Kay, a reboot of the original show that continued from 2001 to 2008. Karan Singh Grover played a role originally played by Ronit Roy. But the actor bid adieu to the show within few months.\n\nKaran Singh Grover, who is also a fitness enthusiast just like his wife Bipasha Basu, has currently taken to art and is nowadays giving the abstract painting a shot. He has been painting for a couple of years now, and through social media, he had the opportunity to share his artwork. Karan plans to exhibit 18 of his paintings at an exhibition very soon. He said: \"My freedom of expression over the last three years has brought me here. Soon, I will be exhibiting my labor of love to all.\""
