        "text": "Karan Singh Grover recently reflected on his past relationships and shared insights into his divorces from Jennifer Winget and Shraddha Nigam. Before his marriage to Bipasha Basu, Karan was married to Jennifer Winget. Their relationship, however, did not last, and they separated in 2014, subsequently filing for divorce in 2015. Karan's candid discussion about these significant chapters of his life offers a deeper understanding of his journey and the challenges he has faced in his personal life.\n\nKaran Singh Grover Opens Up On Divorce With Ex-Wives\n\nKaran said in an interview with ETimes, “There’s nothing good about a breakup or a divorce. Yeah, later when people move on, they realise that it happened for the best. That’s a good thing.”\n\nHe went on to state, “But I never felt the need to speak to anyone about the crap that’s happening in my life because I don’t expect people to come and talk to me about the crap that’s happening in their life. That is not my main motive. I would like to spread some love and joy. Everyone has their own sh*t to deal with and I think everyone deserves that kind of privacy to handle their own sh*t.”\n\nBipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover tied the knot in 2016, and they recently celebrated eight years of marital bliss. The couple first met in 2015 while working together on the film \"Alone,\" and their on-screen chemistry quickly blossomed into a real-life romance, leading to their marriage in 2016. Since then, Bipasha and Karan have been setting major couple goals with their adorable public displays of affection. Their strong bond is evident in the loving and affectionate posts they share on social media.\n\nIn a recent interview, Karan Singh Grover spoke about how profoundly Bipasha has influenced his life. He described her as a person who is constantly giving and nurturing, ensuring that everyone in her life feels connected to her. Karan credited Bipasha for helping him shed all the negativity and low vibrations from his life. He revealed that she has been a pivotal force in his life, even inspiring him to pursue a new profession—painting."
