        "text": "What’s cooking behind the scenes of the television industry is not just saas, bahu and saazish! TV celebrities quite often end up finding their significant other in their co-star or people working with them. A lot of small screen couples have found love on the sets, but some of them witnessed a heartbreaking end shortly after.\n\nSplitting up with the (once presumed) love of your life can be shattering, but when you’re famous, it’s vulnerable and tragically public. These famous TV celebrities who were immensely loved by their fans had the most shocking divorces ever.\n\n1. Juhi Parmar And Sachin Shroff\n\nTV’s beloved ‘Kumkum’ aka Juhi Parmar ended her eight-year-old marriage with actor-husband Sachin Shroff in 2018. Sachin met Juhi for the first time in a not-so-extraordinary setting, but what followed was truly magical. They were just two co-stars who came together to shoot for a TV show that didn’t even go on air. After a brief courtship period, the two tied up the knot in 2009. According to rumours, Juhi and Sachin remained cordial through their divorce and it was an amicable one. It was also reported that Juhi did not demand any alimony, and received the sole custody of their six-year-old daughter Samairra.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n2. Shraddha Nigam And Karan Singh Grover\n\nKaran Singh Grover found his first love in Shraddha Nigam and married her in 2008. However, after a brief period of 10 months, the couple decided to part ways. They got divorced in 2009, and the reason behind their divorce was supposedly Karan’s flirtatious nature and his affair with his Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 3 choreographer Nicole Alvares. If reports are to be believed, the Krishna Arjun actress called off the marriage when she caught Karan red-handed with Nicole.\n\n3. Rashami Desai And Nandish Sandhu\n\nRashami and Nandish fell in love on the sets of the Colors TV show, Uttaran. They dated for a while and were shipped by numerous fans of the show. They got married in 2012, but their relationship hit rock bottom in 2013, and Rashami decided to file for divorce. To rekindle their lost romance they decided to give another chance to their relationship, and therefore, participated in the seventh season of the celeb dance reality show, Nach Baliye. However, they were unable to save their marriage. While Rashmi’s friends accuse Nandish of cheating on her, Nandish’s group blame Rashmi’s possessiveness as the main reason behind the divorce.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n4. Jennifer Winget And Karan Singh Grover\n\nKaran Singh Grover was labelled as the ‘casanova of telly world’ when his second marriage ended in divorce. Remember Armaan and Riddhima from the popular TV show Dill Mill Gayye? Karan Singh Grover and Jennifer Winget‘s chemistry on the show was an instant hit with the audience. Jennifer and Karan started as best friends, then dated for several months and tied the knot in 2012. However, they parted ways only after two years, much to the disappointment of their fans. According to grapevine, it was once again Karan’s flirtatious nature and his alleged proximity with his Alone movie co-star Bipasha Basu, which created the rift between the couple. Karan finally married Bipasha in 2016 and the couple celebrated their third wedding anniversary this month.\n\n5. Rajeev Paul and Delnaaz Irani\n\nDelnaaz and Rajeev met on the sets of Parivartan, a popular soap in 1993. The couple later married, but got divorced in 2012. Delnaaz cited Rajeev’s infidelity as the cause for the divorce. Things had been rosy between them for more than a decade. So much so, that their compatibility in the sixth season of Nach Baliye was adored by both the judges as well as other participants. However, things started turning sour for this bubbly couple and they parted ways after 14-long years of marriage.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n6. Ali Merchant And Sara Khan\n\nRemember the show-it-off wedding of Sara Khan and Ali Merchant on Bigg Boss 4? The lovebirds who had been dating for four years and had a nikaah on the show in 2010. However, the marriage was apparently a publicity stunt and ended after two months. Numerous reasons have been cited as to why the couple (who BTW DID NOT look like they were in love while at the Bigg Boss house) might have called it quits, but according to a source, Sara divorced Ali because he ate up all her hard-earned money. However, Ali accepted getting married on TV for publicity. He even went on to say that marrying Sara was his ‘biggest mistake’.\n\n7. Shweta Tiwari And Raja Chaudhary\n\nKnown for portraying the role Prerna in Ekta Kapoor’s Kasautii Zindagii Kay, Shweta Tiwari entered the telly world happily married to Meerut-born actor Raja Chaudhary. The couple even featured together in dance reality show Nach Baliye 2. They got married in 1998 and have a daughter, Palak Chaudhary. Their marriage was always troubled, but Shweta never spoke about it until she divorced Raja after 9 years of staying in an ‘abusive’ marriage. She accused him of domestic violence and finally got a divorce in 2012. After settling the divorce proceedings, Shweta tied the knot with TV actor Abhinav Kohli who was also her co-star in the show Jaane Kya Baat Hui. The two now have a two-year-old son together, Reyansh Kohli.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlso read about celebrities who had the most expensive divorces.\n\nImages: Instagram\n\nPOPxo is now available in six languages: English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi and Bangla.\n\nAWESOME NEWS!
