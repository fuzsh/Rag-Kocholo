        "text": "GUL KHAN AND ACTOR HAVE OPENLY STARTED MAKING PUBLIC APPEARANCES TOGETHER EVEN AS TROUBLES MOUNT BETWEEN HIM AND JENNIFER WINGET\n\nOctober 28, 2014\n\nAnil Merani\n\nIs producer Gul Khan the real reason behind all the troubles in the marriage between Karan Singh Grover and Jennifer Winget? According to sources, the two have been together ever since Karan was part of Gul's Zee TV show, Qubool Hai. As a result Karan would always get preferential treatment on the sets. It is said that whenever Gul would come on the sets she would spend long hours with Karan in his room, putting the shoot on hold. Even when the crew went out of Mumbai, Karan would travel first class along with Gul while the other actors had to be satisfied with economy class seats.\n\nIt is this proximity with Gul which also cost Karan a lot of money when he quit Qubool Hai as he could not pressurise his lady love to clear his arrears which supposedly ran into lakhs.\n\nThough we were aware of a third angle between Karan and Jennifer when we first broke the story of their marriage being on the rocks, we weren't sure about Gul's part in it and we had to be especially careful as Gul is married. However our suspicions got credence when Karan recently attended a media party along with Gul, raising a lot of eyebrows.\n\nIt was also said that Karan's parents were unhappy with his second marriage floundering ( he was earlier married to Shraddha Nigam). Karan had since moved out of his flat with Jennifer who also shifted bag and baggage out of her matrimonial home. He had apparently taken a flat in Bandra.\n\nNow it seems that Karan's folks might have made peace with his relationship status as his mother, who was very upset when he decided to end his marriage with Jennifer, had moved in with Karan to be with him during Diwali.\n\nAnother source added that the relationship between Jennifer and Karan was unique. But Karan was not faithful to his wife. He had apparently done the same with Shraddha as well.\n\nNo wonder after we earlier broke the story about their failing marriage, it was Jennifer alone who reacted by saying that all is well.\n\nInterestingly, Karan has not uttered a word about the entire affair."
