        "text": "Bollywood stars came alive while celebrating their colleague Bipasha Basu's wedding to TV/Bollywood star, Karan Singh Grover. Though this is Bipasha Basu's first marriage, Karan Singh Grover has walked the path twice before.\n\nKaran Singh Grover married his girlfriend Shraddha Nigam after they met on the sets of their popular TV show, 'Dil Mil Gaye'. After dating for just a few months, the duo decided to tie the knot. Unfortunately for them, the marriage lasted for only 10 months.\n\nShraddha Nigam, who is now happily married to her co-star from the same show Mayank Anand, finally opened up about Karan and Bipasha's wedding. Shraddha Nigam wished the newlyweds all the luck for their wedding and life ahead.\n\nShraddha and Karan started having problems in their marriage when Karan started having an affair with Nicole, a choreographer with 'Jhalak Dikhlaa Jaa'. After the divorce, Karan started dating another co-star of his, Jennifer Winget, whom he was later married to for 2 years.\n\nWinget too spoke about Karan and Bipasha's wedding. She said, 'It was an experience, and an amazing roller-coaster ride. There were some happy and sad moments. But I know that I gave my 500% (to my marriage), and no one can point a finger at me. I don't regret a single day of my life. But, s**t happens. I don't feel bitter or hold any grudges. I am in a happy space. People might think otherwise, but that's not the case.'\n\nBoth the wives have now moved on, while Karan got hitched for the third time with Bollywood actress Bipasha Basu. We wish the newlyweds a lifetime of togetherness."
