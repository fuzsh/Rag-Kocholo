        "text": "1. Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput\n\nAfter several failed relationships, when this Bollywood hunk decided to look for a partner outside the industry, in a traditional arranged set-up—he got hitched with a girl his family chose, from his religious community. After that, there was no looking back!\n\nShahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput are the couple to emulate, and their generous doses of social media PDA are enough evidence of the fact that this couple is madly in love. Shahid Kapoor's marriage made headlines not just because his wife was not a celebrity, but because she was younger to him, with a whopping age-gap of 13 years! Their baby daughter, Misha will soon turn one, and the young mother recently gave an interview that they are planning a second baby as well. #FamilyGoals anyone?\n\n2. Sridevi and Boney Kapoor\n\nSridevi and Boney Kapoor's love story shocked Bollywood, thanks to it's twisted conception. Boney Kapoor's ex-wife, Mona went into complete denial when she got to know that Sridevi, who she had generously hosted when she was new to Mumbai, would end up getting cozy with her husband! Sridevi, was considered the reason for ending a 13 year marriage between Boney Kapoor and Mona Kapoor.\n\nHaving first met on the sets of Mr. India, it was love at first sight for Boney Kapoor, but he didn't know how to approach Sridevi, not to mention the fact that he was already married with two children. She stayed at his house at that time when the city was under high-alert in 1993, and eventually got pregnant with his child, after finally confessing her attraction for him. Soon after, the couple got married(keeping it a secret for six months), despite differences with Boney Kapoor's first wife—crowning their marriage as one of the most controversial in the history of Bollywood.\n\n3. Hema Malini and Dharmendra\n\nRegional differences, as well as an existing marriage—these were some obstacles that this 'dream' couple had to undergo, to tie the knot. While Dharmendra belonged to Punjab, Hema Malini was the reigning queen down South, so obviously their union did not go down well with their respective families, especially Hema Malini's father. To top this off, Dharmendra was already married and a father to two, when he had an affair with Hema Malini.\n\nAfter her father passed away, she decided to marry Dharmendra, and both of them adopted Islam as their religion, getting married in a secret Nikaah ceremony, when the latter's wife refused to divorce him.\n\n4. Amrita Singh and Saif Ali Khan\n\nBack in the 90s, following a traditional Islamic wedding, this duo tied the knot, which created a lot of buzz. Amrita Singh had left her career in acting at its peak, to be a home-maker, and together they became parents to Sara and Ibrahim.\n\nTheir love story began at a party, when Amrita Singh invited him over to her place. A few hours and a bottle of Scotch later, the couple fell in love. Amidst a lot of uproar and disapproval from their families—owing to their different religious background and their striking age-gap (13 years, woah!), they got married in October 1991. But alas, their marriage eventually hit the rocks and they split up in 2004.\n\n5. Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover\n\nThis marriage with its own hashtag to boast of, titled #MonkeyLove—became the butt of memes as soon as it was announced! The groom, Karan Singh Grover is infamous for his romantic relationships err marriages, that went down the drain. When his first marriage with Shraddha Nigam ended in less than a year, followed by another failed marriage with his Dil Mill Gayye co-star Jennifer Winget within a short span of two years, people lost faith in his loyalty, thanks to his frivolous love interests. As of yet this newly married couple is going strong, and with one year into wedlock, one can only wish that this one lasts, including Salman Khan! Yes, Salman, who also attended their reception, said he likes the couple together — \"I hope Bipasha and Karan's pair will last and that's important.\"\n\n6. Nargis and Sunil Dutt\n\nEven today, inter-religion marriages are frowned upon by several communities, so during the post-partition era—you could imagine the catastrophe it would be pitched as! After a very heart-breaking break-up with Raj Kapoor, Nargis found solace in the company of Sunil Dutt, especially after he heroically saved her life in an accidental fire on set. After the accident, the actress made an entry in her personal diary, \"If it were not for him, perhaps I would have ended my life. For I alone know the turmoil that was going through me. 'I want you to live,' he (Sunil Dutt) said and I felt I had to live.\"\n\nAwaiting the release of their film, Mother India, the couple has to keep their relationship discreet, as they played the role of mother-son in the film and it would have appeared scandalous to declare a romantic relationship at that time. Only after the movie's release and success, the two openly talked about their relationship, and got married in 1958.\n\n7. Rani Mukerji and Aditya Chopra\n\nBeing Yash Chopra's most prized actor, Rani Mukherjee ended up working and spending some time with his son, Aditya Chopra as well. They shocked the world with the news of their sudden marriage in 2014, many deeming it to be a hoax. It was only when an official statement was issued by Yash Raj Studios revealing, \"We are happy to announce that Mr. Aditya Chopra and Ms. Rani Mukerji got married last night on April 21, in Italy. The wedding was a very small intimate affair with very close family and friends,\" did people actually believe it and the news obviously, spread like wild fire!\n\nThere are speculations that Rani was the one who came between Aditya Chopra and his ex-wife, Payal's seven year long marriage, which made their union pretty controversial.\n\n8. Shilpa Shetty and Raj Kundra\n\nThis actress too met with her fair share of disappointment in love, the most scandalous one being dumped by Akshay Kumar for another woman (Twinkle Khanna).\n\nWhen Shilpa Shetty finally settled down with NRI businessman, Raj Kundra, the country couldn't stop raving about their wedding and it's grandeur. They tied the knot on 22nd November '09, and are now proud parents to a son. The couple seem to be blissfully married, even though Raj Kundra's ex-wife openly accused Shilpa to be the reason behind her broken marriage."
