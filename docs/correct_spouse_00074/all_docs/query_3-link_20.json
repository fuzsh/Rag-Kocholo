Grover's family relocated to Al Khobar Saudi Arabia while he was a young child.\n\nEducation\n\nShe attended school in Dammam Saudi Arabia and later attended IHM Mumbai to earn a degree in hotel management. The Sheraton Hotel in Oman was where he later worked as a marketing executive.\n\nRelationships\n\nShraddha Nigam\n\nIn Goa Karan Singh Grover married Shraddha Nigam in 2008 in a very private ceremony. But problems arose very quickly and after only ten months of marriage actress Shraddha Nigam decided to leave her husband's frolicking husband because she had grown close to a choreographer from the Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 3 sets.\n\nSurbhi Jyoti\n\nSurbhi Jyoti a well-known actress is next on our list. In addition to being co-stars and having excellent on-screen chemistry Subhi Jyoti and Karan had a fantastic personal relationship.\n\nGul Khan\n\nGul Khan the Qubool hai producer is listed next. There were rumors that the famous cavalier Karan Singh Grover began dating the producer of his program Qubool Hai and since they were frequently spotted together it's possible that the rumours were true.\n\nNicole\n\nWhen Jennifer learned of Karan's involvement with Nicole she broke up their relationship. Karan had told Jennifer he would divorce his wife and marry her. At the same time, Shraddha also got a divorce from him. Following his divorce from Shraddha and split from Jennifer Karan started dating Nicole. After being together for one and a half years Karan and Nicole called it quits in 2011.\n\nEx Wife Jennifer Winget\n\nAfter getting to know each other on the Dill Mill Gayye set Jennifer Winget and Karan began dating.

Karan wed Shraddha Nigam before getting hitched to Jennifer.\n\nBefore being married in 2012 Jennifer and Karan dated for a few years. They filed for divorce in 2014. Jennifer has said that following their divorce she had to isolate herself from people because they weren't ready when the choice was made.\n\nIn a recent interview with Bollywood Bubble Jennifer stated I suppose neither of us was prepared. We both weren't prepared to make that move so it's not just him (Karan Singh Grover) or just me. We had been close for a very long time. Every time we met it was like a house on fire. But I suppose the timing was unfortunate.\n\nBipasha Basu\n\nOn April 30, 2016, Bipasha and Karan were married in Mumbai. The couple's storybook wedding setup gave us wedding goals, and their hashtag monkey love has become part of our vocabulary. On January 1 Karan popped the question to Bipasha and their happiness ever after began. Let's look at their heartwarming love tale.\n\nKaran Singh Grover and Bipasha Basu fell in love while filming their movie Alone (2015). Bipasha discussed the magnificent proposal that completely floored her in an interview with The Times Of India. When asked how Karan had proposed to her Bipasha had responded as follows: I did however not think I would get married even though I did believe in marriage.\n\nTherefore when he said I do my immediate thought was What are you telling me? And... Karan cut her off before she had finished: Allow me to wrap up the tale for you. On December 31 the sky over Koh Samui was illuminated by fireworks. Something told me that this is the proper time as I was carrying the ring. I therefore used the chance to propose to her while she was filming the fireworks.\n\nConvincing their parents was the next step in their relationship. Bipasha's family was a little hesitant although Karan's family had enthusiastically agreed. Bipasha admitted to using her previous relationship as an example to persuade her disapproving parents in an interview with Pinkvilla. She stated: A failed marriage is not proof that a person is inherently bad. Therefore they shouldn't be condemned. For example, when it came to me I told my parents that our relationship was far deeper and longer than his marriage. Just a piece of paper that I didn't sign that's all.\n\nHow does that differentiate me from him then? It's bad when relationships don't work out but in the long run looking back you're always happy. The adage everything happens for a purpose in your life is consistently accurate. Bipasha and Karan know how to show each other a lot of love and appreciation. Bipasha had always supported Karan's ability to paint. She had even created a unique rooftop studio just for him. On the other hand Bipasha Karan's sweetheart had discovered a new interest in preparing delicious food for him during the quarantine in the year 2020.
