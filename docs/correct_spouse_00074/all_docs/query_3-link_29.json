        "text": "Karan Singh Grover (born 23rd February 1982) spent his childhood in Saudi Arabia and moved to Mumbai in the year 2000 to pursue a degree and career in Hotel Management. However, after bagging the label of the \"Most Popular Model\" at the Gladrags contest in 2004, acting became a natural progression. Karan debuted on our TV screens with Ekta Kapoor & MTV's 'Kitni Mast Hai Zindagi', after which he was a part of many projects including 'Kasautii Zindagi Kay', 'Solah Singaar', 'CID', 'Princess Dolly aur Uska Magic Wand' and 'Parrivaar'. However, it was with the launch of StarOne & Cinevistaas 'Dill Mill Gayye' in August 2007, that he shot to instant fame!\n\nHis portrayal as Dr Armaan Malik has won him many million fans across the globe and today, his good looks, charming personality and immensely natural talent have assured his position as the most popular and loved star on Indian television. KSG married actress Shraddha Nigam in a private ceremony, held at Goa, on 2nd December 2008.\n\nAlong with DMG, Karan has also been a part of a couple of reality shows... Such as StarOne's dance show 'Zara Nachke Dikha' [July-September 2008] which he hosted (interestingly, Jennifer was a contestant in this show also!), and Sony/BBC's 'Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 3' [Feb-May 2009] in which he participated as a contestant and reached the position of 2nd Runner Up.\n\nWe know he will keep on making us proud with everything he does, because he is our 'armaan' for a reason...and he will always be our one & only winner! We love you Karan, keep rocking!\n\nCharacter: Dr Riddhima Gupta / Actor: Jennifer Winget\n\nJennifer Winget (30th May 1985): After acting in small roles in movies such as 'Raja Ko Rani Se Pyar Ho Gaya' and 'Kuch Na Kaho', Jennifer made her television debut on the comedy show 'Shaka Laka Boom Boom'. Later, she went on to being a part of many serials such as 'Kkusum' and 'Kahin To Hoga'. She also appeared opposite KSG in 'Kasauti Zindagii Kay' and played the lead role in 'Sangam'. Her other work on TV includes having participated in the dance reality show 'Zara Nachke Dikha' (which KSG hosted). Jennifer started shooting for 'Dill Mill Gayye', as Dr Riddhima, in April 2009 and is already living up to our expectations and doing a very impressive job portraying the character. She has already proved to be one of Indian television's most talented and adorable actresses and the audience has welcomed her as our Dr Riddhima with open arms!"
