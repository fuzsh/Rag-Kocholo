        "text": "Plot\n\nDill Mill Gayye is a show aimed at the urban educated youth. Set in Sanjeevani Hospital, it deals with the pressures, the drama, the romance, the interpersonal relationships and humour in the lives of young doctors.\n\nThe protagonist, Riddhima (Shilpa Anand) is a 21-year-old intern with dreams of becoming a top doctor. Like any other youngster of today, she has spunk and the spirit to have fun. What sets her apart is her ability to ride through the roughest storms relying on the honesty and integrity, which has been a part of her upbringing. Riddhima has all the ingredients of being a competent yet compassionate doctor and her faith never falters when following the right path in complex medical cases or a real life situations.\n\nAlongside Riddhima several other young characters, representing the wide and varied lifestyles in India are present. The spitfire, focused and at times selfish Anjali, the rich, charming and laid-back lover boy Armaan, the anxious to please Gujarati, middle class girl Sapna,the always sweet appealing to all girls is Atul, the cool Punjabi dude Rahul,and the chatter-box Muskaan.\n\nIt has been revealed that Atul is the adopted son of Omi, one of the protagonists in the first season of Sanjeevani. It has also been revealed that although Riddhima and Anjali are sisters, they are in fact only half-sisters. Padma, one of the nurses in Sanjeevani, is the birth mother of Riddhima.\n\nMain Characters\n\nDr. Shashank Gupta\n\nHe is the head of Sanjeevni hospital and has spent his entire career as a doctor for this hospital and its patients.He is considered a 'God' in the world of surgery and all interns wait for an opportunity to assist him in the operation theater. Dr Shashank is an idol not only for interns but also other resident doctors of Sanjeevani. Dr Shashank's two daughters Riddhima and Anjali are world to him and all he wants is to see his daughters become competent doctors. Both Riddhima and Anjali come to Sanjieevani to do their internship but get no special treatment for being the daughters of the head of the hospital.Played by Mohnish Behl.\n\nDr Riddhima Gupta\n\nRiddhima is a 21 year old, warm hearted, kind and good-natured girl. This single most important thing in her life along with being a good human being is her dream to make her father, Shashank Gupta proud off her achievements in the medical arena. She is intelligent and modern in her outlook to life, and yet respects and represents all the core Indian values. Quick to forgive and forget, at the same time she will not take blatant injustice lying down. Riddhima's weak spot is Anjali, as she allows Anjali to always get the better from her, but that again is not a sign of her weakness. She does so simply because her nature is amenable to everything. Yet, there is one person, an intern like her in Sanjeevani, who manages to get a rise out of the generally very easy going Riddhima. How much ever Riddhima tries to ignore Armnaan, she unexplainable cannot.Later,like any other girl,she falls in love with Armaan,and reveals it to him. Played by Shilpa Anand.\n\nDr. Armaan Mallik\n\n22 year old Armaan represents the new age man; one who is self confident, efficient, cheeky and occasionally even smug. He is also extremely handsome and gives the impression of being a skirt chaser. He enjoys female company and makes no bones about the fact that he has a weakening knee effect on women. He is used to being the centre of female attention and also knows how to sustain that attention when he does receive it. Armaan comes from an affluent family and has never wanted for anything materialistic ever in his life. But beneath the suave and confident exterior lies a focussed doctor, whose sole aim is to outgrow the stigma of being the son of an alcoholic anesthesiologist.He falls in love with Riddhima,making her fall in love with him,too. Played by Karan Singh Grover.\n\nDr. Anjali Gupta\n\nAnjali at 22, is Shashank's older daughter and is basically one who is used to having her way. Extremly beautiful, she is quiet conscious of her looks and not above using them .She is manipulative and conniving. In addition she is also academically intelligent, making her a good doctor in her own right,though she is never a favourite amongst the patients,owing to her to-the-point attitude. Her ultimate aim is to be the head of the organisation Sanjeevani, as it means that she will have power, respectability. And it will declare her as the fitting heir apparent to Shashank's legacy. She will employ all the methods of saam, daam, dand and bhed to get whatever she sets her eyes on. Anjali's manipulative ways are most obvious in the way she handles her sister Riddhima.Played by Sunaina Gulia.\n\nDr. Atul Joshi\n\nA lovable character, Atul is the best guy friend a girl can ever have, without ever making him a real boy friend. He is a good natured, easy going boy, who has become a doctor to fulfill the wish of his dead father, who is part of Sanjeevani alumni. His father worshiped Sanjeevani and Shashank Gupta and he has come to the place of his father's worship to pay his tribute to the man who adopted him. He is always treated like one of the girls when girlie talks are being discussed. When he realizes certain people cannot be changed, he takes mater into his own hands and empties trash, puts cups in trash and carries his own porcelain cup so that the use of Styrofoam cups in Sanjeevani can be reduced.Played by Pankit Thakker.\n\nDr. Sapna Shah\n\nShe is a simple girl from a simple, yet reasonably rich Gujarati household. She is the youngest of three daughters and her father always encouraged her to do what she wanted. Having seen her older sisters married off and straddled with bawling children early in their life, she escaped in the direction of a possible career, with the intention that it would be a legitimate excuse for the family to delay her marriage. Her mother is possessive and she is always trying to make excuses for her mothers over domineering and loving over indulgence. She gets a dabba full of Gujrathi food, large enough to feed all the interns. And she has to very often leave work early, or keep Friday evenings free to meet a potential match.Finally,it is now being showed that Sapna is getting married with a person named Amit,who loves Sapna and that he,along with his and Sapna's parents had arranged their marriage and that is why he did the acting of being ill and made Sapna say 'yes' to him. Played By Muskaan Mehani.\n\nDr.Rahul Grewal\n\nHe is a smart,good-looking and cool dude like Armaan and is a new intern from Sanjeevani Amritsar.He was in Armaan's college and was a complete champu.Everyone in the college would have-the-time laugh at him and all the girls would roam around with Armaan,which he hated.He liked one girl-'Sonia'in his college who in turn liked Armaan.He is now in Sanjeevani and is out to trouble Armaan.Played by Mayank Anand.\n\nDr.Muskaan Chedda\n\nShe is the typical non-stop Punjabi chatter box and new intern from Sanjeevani Amritsar.She hates Rahul a lot and is always out to give him bad words.She loves her 'Dhanu' or her Scooty a lot.She always gets shouting from Dr.Keerti because of her foolish but funny questions.She can make one laugh with her laugh Punjabi jokes and bad words.Played by Aayushi Singh Sai.\n\nSecondary Characters\n\nDr.Shubhankar\n\nHe is the head cardiologist of Sanjeevani and is very dedicated and efficient in his work.He lost his wife in accident and was indeed depressed about it.But in a period of time,he recovered from it.He has a small bubbly daughter.He likes Keerti a lot,but feels shy to tell her.Played by Ayaz Khan.\n\nDr.Keerti\n\nShe is the strict disciplinarian who gives her interns their duties and is very good in her work.She can never spare any mistake from her interns.She is strict from outside,but is very caring from inside.Played by Sonia Singh.\n\nNani\n\nShe is Dr.Smriti's mother and is very sweet,loving and caring.She loves Riddhima and Anjali a lot.She knows well that Shashank has certain feelings for Padma and as she lost her daughter,she wants someone to take care of Shashank,Riddhima and Anjali.Hence,she and Anjali set out to make Padma and Shashank one.Played by Vinita Malik.\n\nSister Padma\n\nShe is the head nurse of Sanjeevani and also Riddhima's birth mother.She is very loving,caring,sweet and good at heart.She never wanted to tell Riddhima that she is her mother,but somehow,to she was very unfortunate and some how Riddhima came to know.She has special feelings for Shashank.She takes a lot of care of Dr.Shashank and his family.She has placed herself as a family member of Gupta family now.Played by Shilpa Tulaskar.\n\nCast"
