A woman who would tell one that would tell one anything.\n\n― Oscar Wilde\n\n5 Actresses who hide their age\n\nThe Times of India\n\n[Indpaedia’s comment: What is the big deal if a girl—or man—does not want to reveal something as personal as her/ his age? People are not public property. In any case Rekha claimed to be 13 when she joined the films in 1969. Dimple claimed to be 14, in which case her marriage to Rajesh Khanna was null and void under the law.]\n\nBipasha Basu: Bipasha Basu grabs the third position in this list. The curious case of Bipasha's mysterious age is another one to look out for. A few years back the actress claimed that she was 28. It was at this point that one of her juniors from school came out in the open and said that Bipasha was three years older to her and in no way she could be 28 then. As per IMDB, the actress is 35 now.\n\nGauahar Khan: Whether it was her traumatic stay in the Bigg Boss house that made her forget her real age or her hide-and-seek love story with Kushal, we don't know. But there is just one thing we know for sure, Gauahar Khan celebrated her 29th birthday in 2011 too. When Bigg Boss 7 winner, Gauahar openly answered Salman Khan and mentioned that her age was 29 during one of the 'Jannat Ka Wow' episodes, the feisty diva clearly forgot that she had already celebrated her 29th birthday two years ago. Gauahar celebrated her 29th birthday with sister Nigaar Khan on their reality show 'The Khan Sisters'. Well, looks like age is just a number for Gauahar.\n\nKatrina Kaif: Katrina's true age is a mystery all Bollywood divas are trying to solve. In an exclusive interview with TOI Katrina had revealed that she was only 8 years old when the Berlin Wall fell. So if we calculate, Katrina was born in 1981. If we go by this detail, Katrina should be 33 today. But what caught us off guard was when Katrina said, \"Just because I've acted with Akshay and Salman doesn't make me older. I'm younger than Ranbir.\" If we go by the data again, Ranbir is born in 1982 so Katrina indeed is older than Ranbir. Wonder why Deepika wanted to see Katrina's passport.\n\nMallika Sherawat: Aaprt from her bold statements there is one more thing that keeps the actress in the news, her fluctuating age. While Mallika claims to be 'very young' her IMDB account says she is born in 1976. That makes the actress 38 years old now. We wonder if 38 is the new 16 for this leggy lass.\n\nSherlyn Chopra: Sherlyn Chopra has made it very clear that she does not like hiding behind her clothes, but there is just one thing she likes to hide, i.e, her age. Sources claim the actress has celebrated her 22nd birthday many a times. While actresses like - Aishwarya and Shilpa proudly talk about their age, Sherlyn definitely does seem too inspired by them. According to IMDB, the actress is 30 years old\n\nActresses who chose silicon implants for (a) fuller look\n\nThe Times of India\n\nBipasha Basu is one actress who inspired many to get fit and her sultry body is reason for many to be jealous. However, this Bong beauty too allegedly opted for silicon implants and she grabbed headlines when she was allegedly accused of not paying her doctor after the treatment.\n\nKangana Ranaut, who is known for her performances in films like Fashion, Life In A Metro, too allegedly chose silicon implants and got a different avatar. However, Kangana denied all the reports and claimed that she never had any surgery.\n\nMallika Sherawat, who is known for her international trips and hot body, allegedly depends on surgeries to make sure that she gets a fuller look. The actress reportedly went under the knife and got silicon implants done for her Bollywood entry.\n\nMinisha Lamba grabbed more headlines for her alleged plastic surgeries than her films. According to reports, the actress went under the knife to get a perfect body and reportedly even chose to go for silicon implants.\n\nRakhi Sawant is one proud member of the implant bandwagon. She cannot help flaunt her cleavage on screen and in parties. She also admitted about her plastic surgeries and later there were also reports that the item girl got them removed and spoke about it openly.\n\nShilpa Shetty is one example of transformation which will inspire many aspiring actresses. The lady allegedly went through a nose job and also opted for implants to give her body a fuller look. Shilpa's yummy mummy status gives you an inkling of her fab looks even today.\n\nSushmita Sen, who charmed many and made our nation proud by winning the Miss Universe title, has also allegedly been under the knife to make sure that she gets a envy-worthy body. According to reports, Sushmita the beauty also publicly admitted about her silicon implants.\n\nActors/ actresses with serious ailments and diseases\n\nCelebs who battled illnesses and diseases\n\nThe Times of India\n\nAmitabh Bachchan - He's the Shahenshah of Bollywood and an actor par excellence. His larger than life persona and charisma combined with that baritone voice, has wooed fans over decades now. But very few known that the actor suffers from a terrible disease called Myasthenia gravis. The occurrence of this disease is 3–30 cases per million per year. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease leading to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue. Big B has been suffering from it for the past 30 years! The actor has also been suffering from other health issues and underwent two abdominal surgeries. The actor revealed to his fans that he was suffering from cirrhosis of the liver, caused by a blood transfusion following a near-fatal accident while shooting for Coolie in 1982. The megastar was quoted saying on his website, \"I (am) a patient that had developed cirrhosis of the liver - a condition that is normally associated with that of an alcoholic. Now since the liver and any ailment associated with it is extremely sensitive, I have to be under constant vigil and monitoring. Some of them are at an extreme stage of repair and I may have to go under the knife sooner rather than later. It is a saga that never seems to end, for, what is more in store for me I cannot comprehend.\" (sic)\n\nDharmendra- The Veeru of Sholay was handsome, a heart breaker and one of India's most good looking, loved and popular stars. Little did anyone know that the actor battled depression for 15 years. Dharmendra then took to drinking and became an alcoholic. The veteran was quoted saying in the media that he has kicked the habit and is more focused on his film career now. The actor also admitted that the habit destroyed him in the past but he has come to terms with it.\n\nHrithik Roshan- The actor suffered from Chronic Subdural Haematoma, a type of hematoma, usually associated with traumatic brain injury. Hrithik was treated for the same at a hospital in Mumbai and underwent a successful brain surgery to remove a clot that developed from \"head injuries\" suffered during filming. Due to this condition, the actor suffered severe headaches and a CT scan and an MRI revealed that he was suffering from Subdural Haematoma, a brain condition normally seen in those above 65. Hrithik's surgery included drilling a small hole in the skull and sucking the clot out. But the surgery was successful and the actor's estranged wife Sussanne Roshan had released a statement saying, \"Thank you for all your love and concern. Hrithik has come out of the surgery stronger than ever before.\"\n\nLisa Ray- When the model turned actress forayed in India, she created a storm. She was bold, beautiful and simply gorgeous. Her videos for Nusrat Fateh Ali khan made her popular, especially the song Afreen Afreen. But tragedy struck the actress when she was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer- multiple myeloma in 2009, a cancer of the white blood cells known as plasma cells, which produce antibodies.. Ten months after being diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, the Canadian born actress says she is cancer free after a stem cell transplant. Initially Lisa stayed mum, but later chose to spoke about it on several platforms and adopted a positive attitude to fight the cancer. Kudos to her fighting spirit. The former actress got married to Jason Dehni and proves that cancer survivors can have a normal life. Her blog, The Yellow Diaries, chronicles her cancer experience. In an interview to The Times of India, Lisa spoke about contributing to a cause, \" I want to contribute in my own little way to help people. Money is certainly an issue when you are fighting cancer but there are hospitals like AIIMS in Delhi that have very good doctors who can take care of you. I have been working with Living with Cancer, an organization in Delhi started by Shiladitya Sengupta, helping cancer patients. I donate whatever I can raise. I have started a line of cocktail saris with a designer and I am trying to donate to this organization from the sale. In India is we don't have enough oncologists. Also, the drugs need to be more accessible here.\" (sic)\n\nManisha Koirala- Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2012. The 42 year old star got treated in New York and ever since her diagnosis, she has been very brave about it. This year on 2nd May, she celebrated one year of being cancer free with her friends and colleagues. Her strength and will power have inspired many. In an interview to TOI, the actress spoke about her illness, \"I didn't care about my health before, but now I take a lot of care of my health. But there is always a fear whether the cancer will come back, so I now know how to deal with it.\" Manisha received a lot of support from the industry and was posting pictures during her treatment.\n\nSalman Khan- The troubled yet Dabangg actor of Bollywood was diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia and is being treated for it. Also known as prosopalgia, Trigeminal neuralgia is a neuropathic disorder characterized by episodes of intense pain in the face, originating from the trigeminal nerve. It is known to be one of the most painful human condition. The pain also spreads to the jaw and cheek and this diseases is commonly called commonly known as the suicide disease. The actor has flown to the US a few times to take treatment for this disease and has been suffering from it for seven years. In an interview to the Hindustan Times, the actor was quoted saying, \"I am suffering from trigeminal neuralgia, a facial nerve problem I have had since the last seven years. But now, it’s getting worse. Ab dard hadd se paar ho gaya hai and I am going to kill it.\" (sic)\n\nActresses who gave up their careers after marriage\n\nSharbani Mukherjee | 11 actorss who chose family over films! | October 15, 2017 | IndiaTimes/ The Times of India\n\nMarriage is considered to be a game changer for most of the actors in Bollywood (especially the leading ladies). Though the scenario has changed over the time and many actors like Kajol and Kareena Kapoor Khan have been working post marriage; there have been a few actors who've been at the top of their game but have chosen to exit the industry post they have tied the knot.\n\nLet us have a look at 11 such actors who've chosen family over films!\n\nAmrita Arora Amrita Arora, who started her career as a model, went on to become a TV presenter and VJ, went on to act in several films. She married businessman Shakeel Ladak in 2009. They have two sons named Azaan and Rayaan.\n\nAsin Thottumkal The 'Ghajini' actor, Asin Thottumkal, married Micromax CEO, Rahul Sharma in January 2016. She had released a statement on her official Instagram account that made it clear that she is not looking for work after marriage.\n\nShe had said: \"For all my media friends who still have not got the message, I'm once again reiterating that I have stopped taking up any assignments and have wrapped all my commitments before my wedding itself including my brand endorsements. Request people to stop making assumptions about my assignments and work as I'm not doing that at this stage. Had made this announcement before the wedding itself.\"\n\nBabita The actor starred in around 20 films before tying the knot with Randhir Kapoor.

Let's take a look at the actresses who smoke in real life.\n\nDimple Kapadia\n\nKangana Ranaut is famous for her depressed, pipe smoking roles in the cine world. In films like Fashion, Tanu Weds Manu and Gangster, she's played the troubled female protagonist. But very few know that the actress is a chain smoker in real life too. Kangana even stood up openly against the ban on smoking. She also went on record to say smoking is a personal choice and should never be banned.\n\nKonkana: Now Konkana is one such actress who is known for breaking all stereotypes so when we got to know that the actress is a chain smoker in real life, it did not really come across as a surprise. The actress revealed in an interview that she found it extremely difficult and irritating to control her urge to smoke while she was pregnant with her first child. Konkona is married to actor Ranvir Shorey.\n\nManisha Koirala That Manisha Koirala is a chain smoker is not one of the world's best kept secrets but what the actress did on her wedding day was totally unimaginable. While brides are supposed to be shy and coy on their wedding day, actress Manisha Koirala was clicked puffing away with friends on her wedding day, in her wedding dress.

The actress says she has chosen this life style and would quit if she feels she should.\n\nActresses who struggle with Hindi\n\nTop Bollywood actresses who struggle with Hindi\n\nThe Times of India\n\nWhile several actresses like Katrina Kaif are often targeted for their poor Hindi, we also look at some other foreign beauties and top actresses who have forayed into mainstream cinema and who have trouble with the language.\n\nKatrina Kaif- She captures the numero uno spot on this list. Katrina Kaif, who was born as Katrina Turquotte is half British and Half Indian. She made her Bollywood debut in 2003 with the film Boom which bombed at the box office. Ever since, Kats has been trying to learn Hindi and speak the language and has made quite a progress after a decade in the industry. She has also been criticized for her poor Hindi and actors like SRK have come to her defence. In fact, in the Varun Dhawan starrer Main Tera Hero there is a reference to Katrina's poor Hindi. But seems like the actress has taken it in her stride and is working hard to get better and better.\n\nNargis Fakhri- Nargis is an American model and actress born to a Pakistani father and a Czech mother. She made her debut opposite Ranbir Kapoor in Imitiaz Ali's Rockstar but due to her poor Hindi, the actress's voice was dubbed but for Main Tera Hero, the actress dubbed for the film in her own voice. According to her interview in indiatoday.in, the actress spoke about working on Hindi. She was quoted saying, \"There is no less offers because of my language problem. If I get a script, I understand it when I read it,\" said the actor and added that script reading sessions with co-stars help too.\" Further adding in the interview, \"You get time to sit with your co-actors and prepare, but to improvise in Hindi is tough. (Initially) I had to stick to my lines, but now I can understand and that's a great progress.\"\n\nSunny Leone- The former porn star turned actress scored big when she was noticed in the Bigg Boss house by film maker Mahesh Bhatt who then offered her Jism 2. An Indo Canadian, Sunny's Hindi was poor and her voice was dubbed for the film. Talking about her Hindi, the actress was quoted saying in DNA, \"I am improving. I took Hindi classes for 2-3 hours daily. But I still feel that my American accent will probably never go,\" she said at a programme organised by Hotel Hindusthan International.\n\nElli Avram- She's cute, humble and bubbly and wooed a million hearts when she participated as a contestant on controversial reality show Bigg Boss. Elli even charmed host Salman Khan with her antics and impressive attempts to speak Hindi and wear saris at various occasions. Elli made her Bollywood debut opposite Manish Paul in Mickey Virus and this Swedish born artist has tried hard to speak Hindi. In the Bigg Boss house, she managed to succeed most times as only Hindi was allowed in the Boss' house and punishment was meted to those who violated this law. Elli has a love for India and kudos to her just for her attempts to even try and attempt the language.\n\nLisa Haydon- Lisa Haydon was born as Elisabeth Marie Haydon to a Malayali father and an Australian mother. Having lived in countries like Australia and United States, it is only natural that the model turned actress has an accent. She wooed us with her performance in the Kangana starrer Queen where her French accent and cute attempts at Hindi made us all smile at her. This sexy model made her debut in Aisha and was also seen in Rascals. But despite her good performances, Lisa has not been able to get rid of her accent which is prominent in her films. In her interview to PTI, the petite model spoke about her film Shaukeen where Khiladi Kumar helped her with Hindi. \"Yes, Akshay helped me a lot with Hindi. He does half of my lines. In fact His Hindi is far better than mine ever be. It is a slow process. I know one can’t learn Hindi in a day. But shooting for so many days and speaking it every day has surely bettered it. Akshay is amazing and lots of fun. He is immensely talented and very encouraging.\"\n\nSophie Choudry- The former MTV India VJ and occasional model and television presenter was born and brought up in England. So it's natural that the Hindi language may seem foreign to her. She participated in Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 7 and has also tried her hands at films like Shootout at Wadala, Heyy Babyy, Pyaar Ke Side Effects, Daddy Cool to name a few, where she made special appearances and she has also done a few item numbers. But yet, the actress speaks Hindi with a foreign accent and it is inseparable from her speech while she responds in Hindi.\n\nAssistant directorships before stardom\n\nAssistants who've made it big\n\nThe Times of India\n\nThe children of A-list Filmistanis--actors, actresses, directors, writers—often receive an apprenticeship (normally as assistant director) under a famous film director (a friend of their parents) before they set out on a career as actors themselves.\n\nThe children of stars\n\nArjun Kapoor worked as assistant producer and assistant director before making is career as a full-fledged actor in Ishaqzaade in 2012.\n\nEmraan Hashmi (a star- nephew) Before starting his career as an actor, Emraan Hashmi worked with Vishesh Films as an assistant director on Vikram Bhatt's Raaz (2002), which featured actors Bipasha and Dino Morea.\n\nHarshvardhan Actor Anil Kapoor's son Harshvardhan assisted Anurag Kashyap on his film, Bombay Velvet and he will be debuting in Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's film, Mirza Sahibaan.\n\nHrithik Roshan: After doing cameo in Aap Ke Deewane (1980) and Bhagwan Dada (1986) Hrithik Roshan went on to become assistant director and worked under his father Rakesh Roshan for films like Karan Arjun (1995) and Koyla (1997).\n\nJunaid Aamir Khan's son Junaid too is said to be assisting director Rajkumar Hirani on Aamir's film PK\n\nKaran Deol Sunny Deol's son, Karan Deol assisted Sangeeth Sivan on Yamla Pagla Deewana 2.

Stardust even announced that Vinod Khanna had turned no.1. Stardust hurt its own reputation in the process. Mr Bachchan rose to be no.1—and stayed at that position—during the period of the media ban on him.\n\n(In the 2010s the photographers are banning Salman Khan because his security won’t let twenty aggressive cameramen stick their cameras into his nose. We hope his Kick does great business and he retains his no.1 position, like Mr Bachchan did. In the 2010s, as then, responsible groups like The Times of India are not part of the ban.)\n\nSalman Khan, film actor The latest celebrity to have been boycotted by the media is none other than Salman Khan.

The shutterbugs claim to have been roughed up by the superstar's bodyguards and the security at the venue. Adding fuel to fire was Salman Khan's statement \"Those who want to cover the event are welcome to stay, the rest can leave if they wish\" (sic). It is believed that the photographers asked Salman to pose at a particular spot during the promotional event but apparently he refused. In a response to the ongoing controversy, Salman Khan's father told Mumbai Mirror that he didn't know what happened at the event but agreed that the cameramen get very close sometimes. So much so that Salim Khan said they were almost hit by the cameras at their faces at Baba Siddiqui's iftar party.\n\nShraddha Kapoor- 'Aashiqui 2' star Shraddha Kapoor may be basking in the glory of her recent success 'Ek Villain' but like they say, success comes with a price! Shraddha, known for her goody-two-shoes image shocked her fans with the news of her media ban thanks to the ire of the paparazzi. Shraddha allegedly made the media wait for two hours and then apparently refused to pose for photographs. While daddy dearest Shakti Kapoor came to his daughter's defense, his not-so-clean image with respect to the media got him no brownie points.\n\nBelieve it or not but the shy and sweet Shraddha Kapoor faced a media ban not so long ago because of her unwillingness to pose for the paparazzi. Shraddha has been turning her face away from the photographers too many times and finally invited a ban from the community. According to a news report in Mumbai Mirror dated July 4, 2014, it all started when she refused to look up on her way out of the airport and then kept the lensmen hanging around on the sets of a reality TV show where she was making an appearance. An assistant informed the gathered photographers that they will have to wait until the shoot is over, which meant waiting for a couple of hours. The stance continued as she had refused to pose for them at two other events as well. However, Shraddha sorted out the matter after she met with the photographers union regarding the same. With her film 'Haider' almost ready for release, a rising star like Shraddha couldn't have afforded a media ban.\n\nSaif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor- Saif Ali Khan and his ladylove Kareena Kapoor also had the media walk over them back in 2010. This incident took place almost four years back when Saif and Kareena were supposed to address the media and promote a shoe brand the two were endorsing. While the media including the cameramen reached the venue bang on time, the much in love couple were not in sight. According to news reports, the media started fuming after a couple of hours of waiting when Saifeena were still not in sight. The couple walked in later but the members of the media decided to walk away instead. While Saif being the gentleman that he is profusely apologized to them and reasoned out that they were stuck in a traffic jam, the media boycotted the pair instead.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan And till you thought that its the young guns of the industry that the press has targeted think again! Megastar Amitabh Bachchan was once banned by the press. In his blog Big B had revealed once that the entire media went against him after praising him initially. According to an article in Pinkvilla, Amitabh Bachchan had blogged that he was banned because the press were apparently informed by ‘sources’ that he had brought on the idea of the Emergency and a ban on the press. The press ban meant no interviews, no mention or pictures. This was a time when Amitabh Bachchan was doing well career wise and some of the biggest hits of his career had released. The media ban coincided with films like Sholay, 'Deewar', 'Sharabi', 'Muquaddar ka Sikander', 'Lawaaris', 'Natwarlal' etc. The media ban that lasted for more than a decade saw Big B's biggest hits release at that time.\n\n(Indpaedia adds: No, it was not the Emergency. Stardust had some ego problem with Mr Bachchan. Stardust had become the biggest selling film magazine in English and expected him to kowtow to him. Some magazines followed suit. However, responsible ones like Filmfare did mot. In any case, the ban did not make the slightest difference to Mr Bachchan’s career. He rose to be no.1 during the ban. )\n\nBusiness interests of Mumbai stars and other celebrities\n\nThe Times of India\n\nRajendra Kumar. who for a few years in the mid-1960s was the highest paid star in Bombay, arguably started the trend of investing earnings from cinema into business--tea and coffee estates in his case.

Here's a look at few celebs who changed their religion to attain spirituality or for their love.\n\nAmrita Singh: Actress Amrita Singh was born to a Sikh-Muslim family. She made her debut in Bollywood in 1983 with Betaab and delivered several hits like Sunny, Mard and Saaheb. Amrita, who followed the Sikh religion since birth, converted to Islam just before her marriage to actor Saif Ali Khan. Saif, who was a Muslim, is the son of the late Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, the ninth Nawab of Pataudi and actress Sharmila Tagore. After thirteen years of marriage, they divorced in 2004. However, what is interesting is that Saif’s current wife and famous actress Kareena Kapoor has not converted to Islam after her marriage.\n\nAR Rahman (Allah-Rakha Rahman): Though the whole world knows about his music, not much is known about his personal life. India’s most famous music composer, singer-songwriter, music producer and musician was born a Hindu and named A. S. Dileep Kumar. However, he converted to Islam later. The musician was introduced to Qadiri Islam when his younger sister fell severely ill in 1984. He was enchanted by the ideals and values of the religion. His mother, who belonged to an Islamic family before her marriage, too was influenced by Sufism. Though AR Rahman was an atheist during his childhood, he embraced Islam with his full heart.

But in order to give legitimacy to his union with Hema Malini, the couple had converted to Islam. Dharamendra (born as Dharam Singh Deol) is one of the most charismatic heroes that Indian cinema has ever had. The dashing actor, who played both romantic as well as the action hero with finesse, converted to Islam in 1979. The actor was already married to Prakash Kaur and had four kids with her when he met actress Hema Malini and fell in love with her. Since he could not divorce his wife due to his commitment and could not marry again as per the Hindu Marriage Act, he converted to Islam and married Hema. Since then he has maintained two separate families. It is said that since there were many protests during his second marriage, the actor had no option but to change his religion to give legitimacy to his union with Hema Malini.\n\n(Around the same time as Dharmenrra's 'conversion,' Shama, the biggest selling and very respectable Urdu film magazine, reported that Raj Babbar-Smita Patil and Vinod Mehra and his then latest wife had also converted to Islam in order to give similar legitimacy to their second marriages.)\n\nHans Raj Hans: The Pakistani media is abuzz with reports that popular Indian singer Hans Raj Hans has converted to Islam.

He is reportedly proud to embrace Islam and has also expressed a desire to visit Medina. He was allegedly studying Islamic literature for the past few days and has developed faith in the values of Islam as a religion. His fascination for Islam is pretty evident from the fact that he decided to stick to only the Sufi genre of singing, which has its origin in Islam. However, his son Navraj has denied these reports.\n\nNagma Actress Nagma who was born to a Muslim mother and a Hindu father took up Christianity in the year 2007.\n\nNargis Actress Nargis took up Hinduism and changed her name to Nirmala Dutt when she married Sunil Dutt.\n\nSharmila Tagore Bengali beauty Sharmila Tagore converted to Islam when she married Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi on 27 December 1969.

The couple was blessed with three children – actor Saif Ali Khan, jewellery designer Saba Ali Khan and actress Soha Ali Khan. Her husband Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi died on 22 September, 2011.\n\nYuvan Shankar Raja Music director Yuvan Shankar Raja took to his micro-blogging page to announce something very personal. While dismissing rumours about him getting married for the third time, the composer also tweeted that he is now following Islam. “Yes, I follow Islam and I’m proud about it. Alhamdhulillah.

But surely there must also be some big-hearted Filmistani employers as well. bookmybai.com should definitely blacklist the 25 errant and mean Filmistanis. However, bookmybai.com should not generalise about an industry with hundreds, perhaps a few thousand, cineastes that employ domestic staff. Instead, bookmybai.com should do a statistical analysis. Even if 66 per cent of Filmistanis turn out to be mean employers, that should not be held against the remaining, big-hearted Filmistani employers.\n\nHimanshi Dhawan | Startup says bai-bai to Bollywood stars |Apr 19 2017 : The Times of India (Delhi)\n\nTinsel town's ugly underbelly is showing.
