        "text": "Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover are all set to take their relationship to the next level: marriage. While the couple is busy preparing for the big day and their friends are beside themselves with happiness for them, it has now been revealed that Karan and Bipasha could have gotten married a year ago. However, Bipasha couldn't accept Karan's proposal of marriage because of, well, her father.\n\nadvertisement\n\nALSO READ: All you need to know about Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover's wedding\n\nSeveral reports in the media have hinted at Bipasha's parents having had issues with their daughter planning on getting married to a twice-divorced man.\n\nKaran was first married to TV actor Shraddha Nigam, and the marriage fell apart in a mere 10 months. While married to Shraddha, Karan had begun dating his Dill Mill Gaye co-star Jennifer Winget, who he later married. Karan and Jennifer's marriage lasted for about two years, from April 2012 when the two tied the knot, to November 2015, when they filed for a divorce.\n\nA report in Mumbai Mirror has stated that Karan had proposed to Bipasha with a solitaire long ago. Though the Raaz 3 actor was exhilarated at the same, she could not take the relationship further because her father Hirak Basu wasn't very happy with it all.\n\nA friend of Karan has been quoted by the tabloid as saying, \"So even though Karan was clear, since early 2015, that he wanted to marry Bipasha, her father did not want her to tie the knot with him and even told Karan's mother (Deepa Singh) this.\"\n\n\"Since Bipasha's father wasn't ready to give them his blessings, the couple moved in together into a plush Khar apartment, much to their parents' dismay. After a year, their parents called it truce, and Bipasha will now take the pheras with Karan,\" added the friend.\n\nBipasha and Karan have been dating since the time they shot together for the film Alone."
