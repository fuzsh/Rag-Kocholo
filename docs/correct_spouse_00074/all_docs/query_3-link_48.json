        "text": "Bollywood is the most lucrative industry in India, where people, particularly actors make money in millions. They not only make money through films, but also through advertisements and endorsements, besides getting great deal of fame and recognition all over the world. Gone are the days when Bollywood was a masochist institution where males were paid higher than female actresses even though they deserved more. I think it is safe to say that it was a revolutionary time and year when a female actress was paid higher than a male actor. Thanks to Sridevi who is bollywood’s first female superstar. It is said that Sridevi is the first ever female actress in Bollywood who was paid higher than her male colleagues. Well, we must say that it was a glorious time that she made it happen and since then there has been no looking back.\n\nHaving said that, it brings us to a time where bollywood actresses are creating milestones in their acting careers and bank balance perhaps, more than a male actor at the given point of time. If you believe me, I would say there is no better time to be alive than to see women ruling the world and making big bucks. Talking about bucks, here is a list of top 10 richest bollywwod actresses whose net worth’s is going to take you to a wonderland.\n\nHere are the top 10 richest actresses in India:\n\n10. Kangana Ranaut\n\nOn number 10 in this list is Kangana Ranaut, the small town girl who has made it big in Bollywood. In a short span of time in the industry, this beautiful young actress has amassed a net worth of $ 3 million and earns Rs 2-3 crore for every movie. She is known for her versatility and ability to play complex characters with a natural ease. People love Kangana for her badass girl role that she played in Tanu weds Manu and the unstoppable and uneducated women who find herself alone on her dream honeymoon to London in the movie Queen.\n\n9. Sonam Kapoor\n\nSonam Kapoor, star daughter of Anil Kapoor, is the next in the list of top earning actresses in India. This young diva has a net worth of $ 3 million and charges Rs 3-5 crore for a movie. She is known for her acting skills as well as cool fashion sense. It is safe to say that Sonam has received a big bundle of good acting, and good looking genes from her father; the macho man of Bollywood. But if you ask me, I for one, love Sonam’s edgy sense of style and her out of the box fashion.\n\n8. Sonakshi Sinha\n\nThe next name on this list is that of Sonakshi Sinha, daughter of the veteran actor Shatrughan Sinha, with a net worth of $ 3. 5 million. She is said to be quoting between 3-5 crores per movie. She made a grand debut opposite Salman Khan in the super hit movie “Dabangg” and has never looked back since then. Sonakshi Sinha has been giving goals to every girl in the country by being once a fat girl to now the hottest chick in B-town.\n\n7. Anushka Sharma\n\nThis young actress from Bangalore comes next among top earning actresses of India, with a net worth of $ 6 million and Rs 5 crore as earning per movie.
