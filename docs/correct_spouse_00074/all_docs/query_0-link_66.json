        "text": "Karan Singh Grover recently looked back at his past relationships and opened up on his divorce with Jennifer Winget and Shraddha Nigam. Before tying the knot with Bipasha Basu, the actor was married to Jennifer Winget. However, the duo separated in 2014 and filed for divorce in 2015.\n\nIn an interview with ETimes, the Dill Mill Gaye shared, “There’s nothing good about a breakup or a divorce. Yeah, later when people move on, they realize that it happened for the best. That’s a good thing.”\n\nShe shared, “But I never felt the need to speak to anyone about the crap that’s happening in my life because I don’t expect people to come and talk to me about the crap that’s happening in their life. That is not my main motive. I would like to spread some love and joy. Everyone has their own sh*t to deal with and I think everyone deserves that kind of privacy to handle their own sh*t.”\n\nBipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover got married back in 2016. They recently completed eight years of marital bliss. The couple met in 2015 and worked together on the film Alone. They fell for each other and tied the knot in 2016. Ever since then, they have been giving us a major couple of goals with their cute PDA. Bipasha and Karan share a great bond, which is visible through their social media posts.\n\nIn the same interview, Karan shared, how Bipasha has changed his life. “She is the kind of person who is in a constant state of giving. Whoever’s in her life stays connected with her. All the heavy, all the negative, the lower vibration stuff just falls. I have another profession (he has also started painting) because of her. She helped me understand and connect with me. The real me. I know myself today because of her. The change that has happened is so drastic. Like from being a nocturnal being to somebody waking up at 5 a.m. and wanting to see every sunrise and every sunset,” he shared."
