        "text": "Their families are not happy about the relationship.\n\nBy Sreekanth A. Nair\n\nThe year 2016 seems to be really unlucky for Bollywood. After the breakup of Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli and Hrithik Roshan-Kangana Ranaut controversy, now it is rumored that the relationship of Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover is also in deep trouble.\n\nSeveral media reports say that their families are not happy about their relationship.\n\nReports say Bipasha’s mother is not happy about her relationship with Grover as he is a two-time divorcee. He was married to TV actresses Shraddha Nigam and Jennifer Winget. He divorced Winget very recently.\n\nGrover’s mother is also not happy to see him getting married soon after his second divorce. She has threatened to end all relations with him if he doesn’t obey her. Earlier, Grover had promised that he would ask for her opinion before getting married again.\n\nGrover’s mother hadn’t approved his relationship with Winget.\n\nA report in India.com says that Basu has managed to convince her family about the relationship and they are ready to accept Grover as her life partner.\n\nThe duo was expected to get hitched this past April."
