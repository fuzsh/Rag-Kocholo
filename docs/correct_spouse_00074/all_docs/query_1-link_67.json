        "text": "Compared to his other affairs, this relationship is the one that is the least spoken about\n\nWhenever someone talks of Karan Singh Grover, the three exes that come immediately to mind are Jennifer Winget, Nicole Alvares and Shraddha Nigam. The actor has been married twice and linked to quite a few women. However, one of the names that is forgotten now is that of his first love, Barkha Bisht Sengupta.\n\nThe two got together on the sets of MTV’s Kitni Mast Hai Zindagi somewhere in 2004. As Arnav and Udita they did not have any chemistry onscreen but their offscreen bonding was for all to see. Karan and Barkha were spotted at discs and parties together and were soon a couple. The two dated for two years and grapevine was abuzz about how they got engaged.\n\nHowever, the couple split in 2006. While they maintained that it was due to personal differences rumour mills were abuzz that Barkha was upset with his flirtatious ways. His proximity to her friend, Jennifer Winget, who was his wife in Kasauti Zindagi Kay did not apparently go down well with her. Other reports suggest that it was Barkha who dumped him as she grew close to her Pyaar Ke Do Naam – Ek Radha Ek Shyam co-star Indraneil Sengupta. They two started dating and eventually married in a few years time.\n\nKaran was apparently heartbroken after the split and found solace in his friendship with Jennifer. Post that he met Shraddha Nigam and married her. After his divorce, he married good friend Jennifer Winget but sadly that marriage was also terminated in a couple of years. We hope the actor is third time lucky with Bipasha Basu!\n\nStay tuned to BollywoodLife for the latest scoops and updates from Bollywood, Hollywood, South, TV and Web-Series."
