These include names ranging from sanjay dutt to karan Singh Grover.\n\nThe lives of bollywood stars have always been a topic of discussion. Be it their luxury lifestyle or affairs, fans always try to know more and more about their favorite celebs. In such a situation, there is a different craze for the marriages of bollywood celebs. However, just like the marriages of celebs bring happiness to their fans, the news of their breakups and divorces leaves fans heartbroken.\n\nSeparation seems to be the easiest way to deal with deteriorating relationships. There are many such stars in bollywood too, whose first marriage was not successful and they chose the option of second marriage. Many have done 3 or 4 marriages as well. So without any delay let us tell you about those stars who have done 3 or more marriages.\n\n1. kishore Kumar\n\nThe first name in this list comes from the famous singer and actor of hindi cinema, kishore kumar, who had not one or two, but 4 marriages in his life.\n\nKishore Kumar's first wife\n\nThe singer who charmed the world with his magical voice, first married bengali singer-actress Ruma Guha Thakurta in 1950, the niece of bollywood veteran director Satyajit Ray. Two years later, the couple welcomed their son amit Kumar, who is a singer like his father.

However, this marriage also did not last long, as madhubala died in 1969 at the age of just 36 due to a hole in the heart.\n\nKishore Kumar's third wife\n\nAfter the departure of madhubala, kishore kumar struggled with emptiness for a long time, which was fulfilled by the then-rising actress Yogita Bali. kishore married Yogita in 1976. However, kishore and Yogita's marriage also did not last long and the couple separated in 1978 after just 2 years.\n\nKishore Kumar's fourth wife\n\nEven after three unsuccessful marriages, kishore believed in marriage, that's why he married for the fourth time in 1980 with Leena Chandavarkar, the most sought-after actress of her time. The couple welcomed their son sumit Kumar in 1984. Leena stayed with kishore till his last days.\n\n2. mithun Chakraborty\n\nBollywood's 'Disco Dancer' mithun chakraborty has created a special identity in the hearts of the audience with his dance moves as well as acting and unique dialogue delivery. The actor has done two marriages in his life. He married model-turned-actress Helena Luke in 1979 after a breakup with actress Sarika. However, the couple parted ways after 5 months.\n\nSoon after, mithun married his ex-girlfriend Yogita Bali in 1979. This was also the time when Yogita separated from her husband kishore Kumar. Also, mithun had separated from his wife Helena. In such a situation, both were struggling with the pain of their broken marriage and soon both became sympathizers of each other. The couple has three sons, Mahaakshay Chakraborty, Ushme Chakraborty, and Namashi Chakraborty. At the same time, he has adopted a daughter Dishani Chakraborty.\n\nHowever, Yogita and Mithun's marriage started turning sour when reports of the actor's growing closeness with sridevi surfaced.
