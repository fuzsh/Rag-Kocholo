In a recent interview with the Bombay Times, popular actor Karan Singh Grover spoke candidly about his past marriages and separations for the first time. Known for his roles in television and films, Grover has often made headlines for his personal life. He was previously married to actresses Shraddha Nigam and Jennifer Winget before finding lasting happiness with Bipasha Basu, with whom he shares a daughter, Devi.

Early marriages and divorces

Karan first tied the knot with Shraddha Nigam in 2008, but the marriage ended in 2009. He then married Jennifer Winget in 2012, a union that lasted until 2014. Reflecting on these experiences, Grover mentioned that he was not a professional actor at the time and felt no need to justify his actions to anyone. He emphasized his indifference to public opinion, stating, “I’m not somebody who gets bothered if people think good or bad about me.”

Choosing privacy over public disclosure

Discussing why he remained silent about his separations, Grover explained that he believes breakups and divorces are inherently painful but ultimately for the best. He preferred to handle his personal issues privately, as he did not expect others to share their problems with him. “I would like to spread some love and joy. Everyone has their own sh*t to deal with and I think everyone deserves that kind of privacy to handle their own sh*t,” he said.

Transformation through love and support

Karan Singh Grover is now happily married to Bipasha Basu, who has had a profound impact on his life. Grover shared how Bipasha encouraged him to pursue painting and helped him connect with his true self. He credited her with transforming his lifestyle, turning him from a nocturnal person into someone who cherishes early mornings and the beauty of sunrises and sunsets. “The change that has happened is so drastic. Like from being a nocturnal being to somebody waking up at 5 a.m. and wanting to see every sunrise and every sunset,” he revealed.

Jennifer Winget’s perspective on their divorce

Jennifer Winget, who married Grover in 2012, also spoke about their divorce in a previous interview with Bollywood Bubble. She mentioned that neither of them was ready for the commitment at the time, and it was a mutual decision to part ways. Winget described the post-divorce period as challenging due to public sympathy, which led her to withdraw from social interactions. Despite the difficulties, she acknowledged that the experience was part of her personal growth.
