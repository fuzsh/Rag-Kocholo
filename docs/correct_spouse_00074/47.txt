New Delhi: The television heartthrob Karan Singh Grover is known for his casanova image.

After divorce with first wife Shraddha Nigam, when Karan tie the knot with Jennifer Winget many thought that this marriage will sustain. But as per the latest reports Karan and Jennifer are parting their ways.

According to sources Karan and Jennifer are living separately. The source as quoted by a leading website said that "stardom" has gone into Karan's head and it is one of the reasons behind his break up with Jennifer.

Karan's flirty nature came into limelight in 2009, when he was caught by his first wife Shraddha Nigam, red-handed having a relationship with his 'Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa' choreographer Nichole.

Sometime back the media had reported that the split between the two television actors, Jennifer Winget and Karan Singh Grover was evident. Upset by the rumors, Jennifer retorted back defensively saying that she was very much with her husband and all was hunky dory between them. But why did Karan not respond the same?

Karan, who is known for her womanizing ways, does not wish to continue with the tie up with Jennifer and is non-committal with her. It is sad because all along we have seen Jennifer playing the part of a good wife and daughter-in-law, and adultery is not what she really deserved for all that love and devotion.

Well, this is not the first time Karan came in limelight for bad behaviour. Both personally and professionally Karan is often being slammed for his non-flexible and starry attitude.

A source close to the couple just told to a website that KSG has broken all ties with Jennifer and wants to end it once and for all. However, Jennifer is not yet ready to let go, or so we hear.

When the rumours came out, the couple decided to work on their relationship, but it seems like even that has not worked in their favour.
