Karan's first wife Shraddha has now opened up about ex-husband's marriage. In an interview with Tellybytes, Nigam wished Karan all the luck for his wedding and life ahead.

Shraddha Nigam married Karan Singh Grover on December 2, 2008 and their marriage ended in 2009 after 10 months of marital life. Shraddha is now happily married to TV actor Mayank Anand.

Earlier, Karan's second wife Jennifer Winget had said, "It was an experience, and an amazing roller-coaster ride. There were some happy and sad moments. But I know that I gave my 500% (to my marriage), and no one can point a finger at me. I don't regret a single day of my life. But, s**t happens. I don't feel bitter or hold any grudges. I am in a happy space. People might think otherwise, but that's not the case," she added.
