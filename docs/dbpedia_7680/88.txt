What was Robert Downey, Sr.'s Net Worth?

Robert Downey, Sr. was an American actor and filmmaker who had a net worth of $4 million at the time of his death. Robert died on July 7, 2021 at the age of 85. Though he did have a successful career of his own, Robert will always be best known for being the father and namesake of Academy Award winning actor Robert Downey, Jr.

Early Life

He was born Robert John Elias Jr. on June 24, 1936, in New York City. His father, Robert Elias Sr., was a motel owner, and his mother, Elizabeth McLauchlen, was a model. Robert grew up in Rockville Centre, Long Island, and attended the Putney School in Vermont. At some point his parents divorced and his mother would later marry a man named James Downey. In the early 1950s, Robert wanted to enlist in the US Army. He was under 18 at this point so he opted to use his stepfather's last name on his Army enlistment papers, hoping his true age wouldn't be obvious/traceable. The trick worked and from that point on he went by Robert Downey. It wasn't until decades later that he would be known as "Robert Downey, Sr." And that name only truly stuck after his son became a famous actor under the name "Robert Downey, Jr."

Career

Robert Downey began his film career in the early 1960s, making low-budget, underground films that challenged mainstream Hollywood conventions.
