        "text": "Robert Downey Jr.‘s late father revealed that he was the one to first introduce his son to drugs at just six years old.\n\nSr., the new Netflix documentary, focuses on the life and career of filmmaker Robert Downey Sr.\n\nClick inside to read more…More Here! »\n\nSr. is heading to Netflix very soon.\n\nThe forthcoming documentary from Chris Smith (American Movie) about the life and career of filmmaker Robert Downey Sr. will hit the streaming service on December 2, and the first trailer has just arrived.\n\nProduced by Robert Downey Jr., Susan Downey, Kevin Ford, Emily Barclay Ford and Chris Smith, the 89-minute film is described as a “lovingly irreverent portrait” of the filmmaker’s life.\n\nHere’s a full description: “Sr. widens the lens from Downey’s art to the life with which it was deeply intertwined, including an intimate examination of his relationship with son Robert Downey, Jr. Shot over the course of three years, the film truly honors Senior’s nonlinear, outlaw-life approach, including capturing his decision to embark on his own concurrent and final film project. Smith’s portrait of a family and an artist is a meditation on life that’s as surreal as it is sentimental, a celebration of making art with no rules that tosses out its own rulebook along the way.”\n\nWatch the trailer…\n\nRobert Downey, Jr. has released a statement after the death of his father, Robert Downey, Sr., at the age of 85 on Wednesday (July 7).\n\nThe 85-year-old filmmaker’s wife confirmed his death earlier today, and Robert posted a message on social media.\n\nClick inside to read his tribute…More Here! »\n\nRobert Downey, Sr. has sadly passed away, his wife confirmed to the New York Daily News. He was married to bestselling author Rosemary Rogers, who was home at the time of his death.\n\nThe 85-year-old filmmaker, responsible for films like Putney Swope and Greaser’s Palace, passed away in his sleep on Wednesday (July 7) at his home in New York City. Robert Sr. is the father of actor Robert Downey, Jr.\n\nIn addition to directing credits, Robert Sr. also acted in films like Boogie Nights, Magnolia, and To Live And Die in L.A.\n\nHe had also been battling Parkinson’s Disease.\n\nOur thoughts are with Robert‘s entire family, as well as his friends and loved ones during this difficult time. RIP."
