        "text": "\"It was this idea that films kinda brought us together, and to this day, still do.\" Same with my Dad and me. Netflix has revealed the official trailer for an acclaimed documentary film titled simply Sr., directed by award-winning doc filmmaker Chris Smith (American Movie, Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond, Fyre). The title is a reference to Robert Downey Sr., the father of actor Robert Downey Jr. (they even make fun of the title in this trailer). The very intimate, very personal film is about their father-son relationship and his father's work in the film industry. Like Father. Like Son. Like No Other. Sr. is a lovingly irreverent portrait of the life and career of maverick filmmaker Robert Downey Sr. (who passed away in 2021) that devolves into a meditation on art, mortality, and healing generational dysfunction. The film originally premiered at the 2022 Telluride Film Festival and also showed up at NYFF, AFI Fest, and DOC NYC this fall. It has been receiving glowing reviews and is expected to get some documentary nominations during the awards season.\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ poster) for Chris Smith's documentary Sr., direct from Netflix's YouTube:"
