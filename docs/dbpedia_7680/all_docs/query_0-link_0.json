        "text": "American filmmaker and actor (1936–2021)\n\nRobert John Downey Sr. (né Elias Jr.; June 24, 1936 – July 7, 2021) was an American film director, screenwriter and actor. He was known for writing and directing his underground film Putney Swope (1969), a satire on the New York Madison Avenue advertising world. According to film scholar Wheeler Winston Dixon, Downey's films during the 1960s were \"strictly take-no-prisoners affairs, with minimal budgets and outrageous satire, effectively pushing forward the countercultural agenda of the day.\"[2] He was the father of the renowned American movie superstar Robert Downey Jr.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nRobert John Downey Sr. was born Robert John Elias Jr. in the Manhattan borough of New York City, on June 24, 1936.[3] He was the son of Elizabeth \"Betty\" McLauchlen, a model and magazine editor, and Robert John Elias Sr., who worked in management of motels and restaurants.[3] His paternal grandparents were Lithuanian Jews,[4] while his mother was of half Hungarian Jewish and half Irish ancestry.[5][6][7][8][9] He grew up in Rockville Centre, New York.[10] He changed his surname to Downey after his stepfather, when he wanted to enlist in the United States Army while being underage.[11][9] Downey later said he wrote an unpublished novel during his time in the army, though he spent much of his military career \"in the stockade\".[10]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nDowney initially made his mark creating very low-budget independent films aligning with the absurdist movement, in line with counterculture, anti-establishment, 1960s America. His work in the late 1960s and 1970s was quintessential anti-establishment, reflecting the nonconformity popularized by larger counterculture movements and given impetus by new freedoms in films, such as the breakdown of codes on censorship. In keeping with the underground tradition, his 1970s films were independently made on shoestring budgets and were relatively obscure in the Absurdist movement, finding cult notoriety.[12]\n\nIn 1961, working with film editor Fred von Bernewitz, Downey began writing and directing low-budget 16mm films that gained an underground following, beginning with Ball's Bluff (1961), a fantasy short about a Civil War soldier who awakens in Central Park in 1961. He moved into big-budget filmmaking with the surrealistic Greaser's Palace (1972).[13] His last film was Rittenhouse Square (2005), a documentary capturing life in a Philadelphia park.[14]\n\nDowney's films were often family affairs. His first wife appears in four of his films (Chafed Elbows, Pound, Greaser's Palace, Moment to Moment), as well as co-writing one (Moment to Moment). Daughter Allyson and son Robert Downey Jr. each made their film debuts in the 1970 absurdist comedy Pound at the ages of 7 and 5, respectively; Allyson would appear in one more film by her father, Up the Academy. Robert Jr.'s lengthy acting résumé includes appearances in eight films directed by his father (Pound, Greaser's Palace, Moment to Moment, Up the Academy, America, Rented Lips, Too Much Sun, Hugo Pool), as well as two acting appearances in movies where his father was also an actor (Johnny Be Good, Hail Caesar).[15][16][17]\n\nPersonal life and death\n\n[edit]\n\nDowney was married three times. His first marriage was to actress Elsie Ann Ford (1934–2014) in 1962, with whom he had two children: actress-writer Allyson (b. 1963) and actor Robert Jr. (b. 1965). The marriage ended in divorce in 1975. His second marriage, to actress-writer Laura Ernst, lasted until her death on January 27, 1994, from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[10] In 1998, he married his third wife, Rosemary Rogers, humorist and co-author of Saints Preserve Us! and other books. They lived in New York City.[18] Downey died of complications from Parkinson's disease in his sleep at his home in Manhattan, on July 7, 2021, thirteen days after his 85th birthday.[10][19][20]\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Criterion Collection released five of his films (the National Film Registry inductee Putney Swope, Babo 73, Chafed Elbows, No More Excuses and Taos Tonight) as part of the Eclipse Series.[21] A 2022 documentary film simply called \"Sr.\" was made by Chris Smith of American Movie fame and was produced by his son. It won the National Board of Review Award for Best Documentary Feature.[22]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nFilmmaking credits\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Director Writer Producer Notes Ref. 1953 The American Road No No No Short film; cinematographer [23] 1961 Balls Bluff Yes Yes Yes Short film; also actor [24] 1964 A Touch of Greatness Yes No Yes Documentary film; also cinematographer [15] Babo 73 Yes Yes Yes [15][16] 1965 Sweet Smell of Sex Yes Yes No Also cinematographer [16] 1966 Chafed Elbows Yes Yes Yes [15][16] 1968 No More Excuses Yes Yes Yes Also actor [15][16] 1969 Putney Swope Yes Yes No Also uncredited voice dubbing [15][16] 1970 Pound Yes Yes No [15][16] 1971 Cold Turkey 2nd unit No No [16] 1972 Greaser's Palace Yes Yes No [15][16] 1973 Sticks and Bones Yes Yes No Television film [24] 1975 Moment to Moment Yes Yes No a.k.a.
