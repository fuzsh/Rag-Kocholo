        "text": "Robert John Downey Jr., born on 4 April 1965 in Manhattan, was foreordained for the spotlight. His parents, Robert John Downey Jr. and Robert Downey Sr. were advanced-garde filmmakers, and Elsie Ann was a good actress. Rising in an imaginative environment, it was almost inescapable that youthful he would find his way into an acting career. His childhood was far from conventional.\n\nDowney Sr. was known for his counterculture films and unorthodox lifestyle, which comprised allowing his son to use marijuana at the tender age of six years. This early exposure to drugs would haunt him for years to come. Despite the puzzlement at home, he showed an early aptitude for acting. He is just five years old and made his wonderful acting debut in his father’s film, “Pound.” He showed great acting in this film.\n\nHe listened to the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in upstate New York during his teenage years. His multi-talented was evident, and by the time he was in his twenties, he joined the model of Saturday Night Live for the 1985-1986 season. Though his period on the show was temporary, it paved the way for his film journey."
