        "text": "It's clear Robert Downey Jr. has a lot of love for his kids.\n\nThe Avengers actor is a father of three: Robert welcomed son Indio Falconer Downey in 1993 with his then-wife Deborah Falconer, and has two children, son Exton Elias Downey and daughter Avri Roel Downey, with his wife Susan Downey.\n\nExton was born in 2012 and Avri in 2014, less than a year before Robert turned 50. During an interview with Extra in 2014, the actor was asked if he enjoyed fatherhood more being a \"little bit older.\"\n\n\"I mean, it's always great to be a dad no matter where you're at or what else is going on,\" Robert replied. \"But it's nice to really be able to show up because life now is I'm either working or I'm with him. You know, I'm not like 20 something and trying to like party or hang out with my buddies.\"\n\nThe Golden Globe winner doesn't often share photos of his kids, but in 2022, Robert posted a funny video of Exton and Avri helping him prepare for his role in The Sympathizer by shaving his head. \"The things we do for our work ... and our kids. #Sympathizer set ready,\" Robert wrote in the caption.\n\nIn 2023, Robert's kids followed in their dad's footsteps, starring in his series Downey’s Dream Cars, which the actor told PEOPLE was a \"blast.\" All three appeared in the series, and Indio also wrote an episode.\n\n\"[My wife Susan Downey] has raised him not to be a ham,\" Robert said of Exton. \"He's not, like, putting together his audition tapes or anything. He's just a natural extrovert when he wants to be.\" The producer added that Avri brought her own strengths to the set. He said his daughter is \"a little different, even though she is off the charts in the series, too.\"\n\nWhen Robert won his first Oscar in March 2024 for his performance in Oppenheimer, he made sure to shout out his love and admiration for his three kids.\n\nHere's everything to know about Robert Downey Jr.'s children.\n\nIndio Falconer Downey, 30\n\nRobert welcomed his first child, son Indio, with his then-wife Deborah on Sept. 7, 1993. After an eight-year separation, the couple officially ended their marriage in 2004.\n\nThough Indio mainly grew up out of the spotlight, he has made a few appearances with his dad over the years. Indio played a younger version of Robert's character Harry Lockhart in 2005's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.\n\nRobert and Indio walked the red carpet at the Los Angeles premieres of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, The Shaggy Dog, Zodiac and the Netflix documentary Sr., which honored the life of Indio's grandfather, Robert Downey Sr.\n\nBeyond his work in Hollywood, Robert's eldest has a band called Indio Ink, formerly known as The Dose. Robert shared on Instagram in 2022 that he was \"literally gob smacked\" when witnessing Indio's \"musicianship up close\" during a recording session that he dropped in on.\n\nIn a touching Instagram tribute to celebrate Indio's 30th birthday in 2023, the proud dad wrote that his son is \"a magical person\" and \"a legend to his siblings.\"\n\n\"From day one, a joy, a deep thinker, an empath and an artist. Absolutely the least materialistic human I know, and positively one of the most dedicated singer/ songwriter / musicians in LA!!!!\" Robert wrote alongside a montage of photos and videos of his son over the years. \"Indio Falconer Downey, I salute your soul, spirit and wisdom.\"\n\nIn January 2024, Robert promoted one of Indio's songs by putting a link to the new release in his Instagram bio and writing, \"My glorious firstborn continues to impress. Strong recommend!!!\" on a post of the song's cover image.\n\nExton Elias Downey, 12\n\nRobert and Susan welcomed their first child together, Exton Elias, on Feb. 7, 2012, in L.A.\n\nThe Age of Ultron star showed off a photo of his then-3-month-old son during an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, where he also explained his newborn's name. After admiring the photo and saying, “He’s so darn cute, isn’t he?” the actor added, \"My wife's great-uncle Joe was kind of eccentric — when he was in fourth grade, he realized he didn't have a middle name, so he changed his name to J. Exton.\"\n\nEarly on, Robert's younger son was involved in his dad's career, appearing in Netflix's 2022 documentary Sr. \"Exton said, 'Yeah, you can film me or not, I just want to go and see grandpa. I think I need to do this,' \" Robert recalled in an interview with Esquire. \"It was organic. I wasn't there when he talked to the camera.\"\n\nThe Iron Man star continued, reflecting on his own childhood in Hollywood, \"It was this amazing moment of a much healthier, sustainable version of what I had. The great triumph of the whole project is the next generation's opportunity to get the upside without the dark.\"\n\nRobert involved Exton in another one of his projects, too, his Max series Downey's Dream Cars, which premiered in June 2023. Exton, along with his sister and older brother, made a few appearances in the series and poked fun at his dad's car skills.\n\n\"There's been a couple times when ... he's wanted to participate in something I was doing,\" Robert told PEOPLE of his younger son. \"And when I ran this one by him, he said, 'Yeah, sure.' And then he came in and absolutely wiped the floor with me.\"\n\nAvri Roel Downey, 9\n\nRobert and Susan's daughter, Avri Roel, was born on Nov. 4, 2014. The Sherlock Holmes star announced his daughter's arrival with a post on Facebook.\n\n\"After 9 months of intensive development, Team Downey is pleased to announce our 2014 fall/winter project,\" he wrote, referencing his and Susan's production company. \"Yep...Avri Roel Downey joined the party and is accompanied by a variety of Susan's traits that have seemingly overwritten my 'junk DNA.'\"\n\nAvri's middle name, Roel, is a tribute to her grandparents. The first two letters are for Robert Sr., his wife Rosemary and Susan's mom Rosie. Meanwhile, the \"el\" comes from the Infinity War star's mother, Elsie Ford, and Susan's father, Eliot Levin.\n\nIn November 2021, Robert shared videos from Avri's 7th birthday celebration. Alongside a clip of himself dressed up like a piñata and being hit by children with sticks, he jokingly wrote on X (formerly Twitter): \"For my dearest daughter AVRI's 7th bday I gave the kids what they want. Which is clearly mob violence.\"\n\nLike her big brother Exton, Avri was in the Netflix documentary about her paternal grandfather. She also appeared alongside both Exton and Indio in Downey's Dream Cars in 2023."
