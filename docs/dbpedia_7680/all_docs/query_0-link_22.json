        "text": "Robert John Downey (né Elias Jr.; June 24, 1936 – July 7, 2021)[2] was an American filmmaker and actor. He is known for having written and directed the 1969 underground film Putney Swope, a satire on the New York Madison Avenue advertising world. According to film scholar Wheeler Winston Dixon, Downey Sr.'s films during the 1960s were \"strictly take-no-prisoners affairs, with minimal budgets and outrageous satire, effectively pushing forward the countercultural agenda of the day.\"[3]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nRobert John Elias Jr. was born in the Manhattan borough of New York City, the son of Elizabeth (née McLauchlen), a model, and Robert John Elias, who worked in management of motels and restaurants.[2] His paternal grandparents were Lithuanian Jews,[4] while his mother was of half Hungarian Jewish and half Irish ancestry.[5][6][7][8][9] He grew up in Rockville Centre, New York.[10] He changed his surname to Downey (after his stepfather, James Downey) when he wanted to enlist in the United States Army while being underage.[9][11] Downey later said he wrote an unpublished novel during his time in the army, though he spent much of his military career \"in the stockade\".[10]\n\nCareer[]\n\nDowney initially made his mark creating basement budget, independent films aligning with the Absurdist movement, coming of age in counterculture anti-establishment 1960s America. His work in the late 1960s and 1970s was quintessential anti-establishment, reflecting the nonconformity popularized by larger counterculture movements and given impetus by new freedoms in films, such as the breakdown of codes on censorship. In keeping with the underground tradition, his 1970s films were independently made on shoestring budgets and were relatively obscure in the Absurdist movement, finding culture notoriety.[12]\n\nIn 1961, work with film editor Fred von Bernewitz, Downey began writing and directing low-budget 16mm films that gained an underground following, beginning with Ball's Bluff (1961), a fantasy short about a Civil War soldier who awakens in Central Park in 1961. He moved into big-budget filmmaking with the surrealistic Greaser's Palace (1972).[13] His last film was Rittenhouse Square (2005), a documentary capturing life in a Philadelphia park.[14]\n\nDowney's films were often family affairs. His first wife, Elsie, appears in four of his movies (Chafed Elbows, Pound, Greaser's Palace, Moment to Moment), as well as co-writing one (Moment to Moment). Daughter Allyson and son Robert Downey Jr. each made their film debuts in the 1970 absurdist comedy Pound at the ages of 7 and 5, respectively; Allyson would appear in one more film by her father, Up the Academy. Robert Jr.'s lengthy acting résumé includes appearances in eight films directed by his father (Pound, Greaser's Palace, Moment to Moment, Up the Academy, America, Rented Lips, Too Much Sun, Hugo Pool), as well as two acting appearances in movies where his father was also an actor (Johnny Be Good, Hail Caesar).[15][16][17]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nDowney was married three times. His first marriage was to actress Elsie Ann Downey (née Ford; 1934–2014), with whom he had two children: actress-writer Allyson Downey (born 1963) and actor Robert Downey Jr. (born 1965). The marriage ended in divorce in 1975. His second marriage, to actress-writer Laura Ernst, lasted until her death on January 27, 1994, from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[10] In 1998 he married his third wife, Rosemary Rogers, humorist and co-author of Saints Preserve Us! and other books. They lived in New York City.[18]\n\nDowney died at his home in Manhattan on July 7, 2021, at age 85, after having Parkinson's disease for over five years.[10][19][20] The film Licorice Pizza is dedicated to his memory.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nYear Film Role Credit Notes 1953 The American Road[21] Unknown Cinematographer Short film 1961 Balls Bluff[22] Civil War Union Soldier Director, writer, and producer Short film 1964 A Touch of Greatness[15] Unknown Director, producer, and cinematographer Documentary 1964 Babo 73[15][16] Unknown Director, writer, and producer 1965 Sweet Smell of Sex[16] Unknown Director, writer, and cinematographer 1966 Chafed Elbows[15][16] Unknown Director, writer, and producer 1968 No More Excuses[15][16] Private Stewart Thompson Director, writer, and producer 1969 Putney Swope[15][16] Unknown Director and writer Voice, uncredited 1969 Naughty Nurse[23] Desk Clerk Short film 1970 Pound[15][16] Unknown Director and writer 1971 You've Got to Walk It Like You Talk It or You'll Lose That Beat[16] Head of Ad Agency 1971 Is There Sex After Death?[16][22] Himself Mockumentary and mondo film 1971 Cold Turkey[16] Unknown Second unit director 1972 Greaser's Palace[15][16] Unknown Director and writer 1973 Sticks and Bones[22] Unknown Director and writer Television film 1975 Moment to Moment[15][24] Unknown Director and writer Retitled Two Tons of\n\nTurquoise to Taos Tonight 1980 Up the Academy[15][16] Unknown Director 1980 The Gong Show Movie[15][16] Unknown Co-writer 1985 To Live and Die in L.A.[15][16] Senior Secret Service Agent Thomas Bateman 1985–1986 The Twilight Zone Mr. Miller[25] Director[26] Directed 3 episodes\n\nacted in segment: \"Wordplay\" 1986 America[15][16] Unknown Director and co-writer 1986 Matlock[15] Judge Warren Anderson Episode: \"Judge Warren Anderson\" 1988 Rented Lips[15][16] Unknown Director 1988 Moving Target[15][16] Weinberg Television film 1988 Johnny Be Good[16][27] NCAA Investigator Floyd Gondoli 1988–1989 1st & Ten[28][29] Mike McDonald / Reporter #4 /\n\nReporter / Sports Writer 4 episodes 1991 Too Much Sun[15][16] Unknown Director and co-writer 1993 Tales of the City[16][22] Edgar's Doctor Miniseries; 1 episode 1994 Hail Caesar[17] Butler 1996 Sunchaser[22][24] Telephone Voices 1997 Hugo Pool[15][27] Unknown Director and co-writer 1997 Boogie Nights[16][22] Burt 1999 Magnolia[16][22] WDKK Show Director 2000 The Family Man[16][22] Man In House 2004 From Other Worlds[15][16] Baker 2005 Rittenhouse Square[15][27] Unknown Director Documentary 2011 Tower Heist[16][22] Judge Ramos\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nRobert Downey, Sr. at the Internet Movie Database\n\nTemplate:Robert Downey Sr."
