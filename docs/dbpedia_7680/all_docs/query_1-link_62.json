        "text": "Robert Downey Jr recently opened up about his relationship with his late father, Robert Downey Sr, in the new Netflix documentary, Sr.\n\nAt one point in the father-son film, the 57-year-old Iron Man star addressed his past addiction and revealed that his father introduced him to drugs when he was six years old.\n\nDowney Sr recalled playing poker at their family home in New York when he caught his son sipping on a glass of wine. Instead of reprimanding Downey Jr, he offered him a joint instead.\n\n\"It was an idiot move on our part, a lot of us, to share that with our children. I'm just happy he's here,\" the late director said, adding that he often worried his son wouldn't survive.\n\nDowney Jr then shared that he became a full-blown drug addict by the time he turned eight.\n\n\"It's like I have a shotgun in my mouth, and I've got my finger on the trigger ... and I like the taste of the gun metal,” he explained.\n\nThis wasn't the first time the A-list actor came clean about his drug addiction.\n\nIn a 1998 interview for the book, The New Breed, the Marvel alum admitted that doing drugs was something he and his father bonded over.\n\n\"When my dad and I would do drugs together, it was like him trying to express his love for me in the only way he knew,\" said Downey Jr, who is now sober.\n\nDespite the dismal upbringing, the 57-year-old actor assured that he still loved his father, and that he never blamed him.\n\nDowney Sr confirmed this in the documentary: \"I'll never forgive myself, but Robert and I have dealt with it, and he's said to me, 'I'm not a victim, Dad. I don't blame anybody'.\"\n\nDowney Sr died at age 85 from Parkinson’s disease in July 2021. He is best known for writing and directing the satirical comedy film Putney Swope."
