        "text": "Robert Downey Jr. credited TV legend Norman Lear for helping take care of his family financially when his dad was an experimental director.\n\nAt a Los Angeles celebration of a new documentary on Downey Jr.’s dad, Lear — the 100-year-old creator of classic shows including “All in the Family” — recalled offering underground director Robert Downey Sr. a more lucrative gig.\n\nSaid Lear at the Tower Bar reception for Netflix film, “Sr.,” “In 1971 I was making a film called ‘Cold Turkey,’ and I called Bob [Downey, Sr.] and said ‘Would you like to come out to Iowa and be an assistant?’”\n\nDowney Sr. had written and directed the edgy, counterculture satire of the advertising world, “Putney Swope” in 1969. “Cold Turkey” starred Dick Van Dyke in a skewering of the tobacco industry, and was released by United Artists.\n\nLear also told the crowd, including Downey Jr., 57, and wife Susan Downey, who produced “Sr.,” “I thought of Bob Downey Sr. as unique, and lovely, and tender, and funny, and creative, and as special of a human being as I ever knew.”\n\nAlso in attendance were “Spider-Man” stars Tom Holland and Zendaya, Adrien Brody and “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” star Rachael Harris.\n\nDuring a Q&A, The Hollywood Reporter’s Scott Feinberg asked Downey Jr. if he “still has the voice of his dad in his head saying [to him after he made it as an actor], ‘Alright so… you made a lot of money. Now what are you going to do?'”\n\nThe “Iron Man” star said that he “always wants to be appropriately critical of himself and [wants] to push himself,” an attendee told Page Six.\n\nThe star added of his dad, who passed away last year, that he wasn’t sure at times if the film they made would ever see the light of day.\n\nLear added of the movie, directed by Chris Smith, “I was so immensely touched. And not just because I knew Bob [Downey, Sr.] so well, but because the father-son thing got to me, it’s a wonderful piece of work.”\n\nEmily Barclay Ford and Kevin Ford also produced the project, which screened at the New York Film Festival in October."
