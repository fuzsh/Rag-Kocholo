        "text": "Embarking on his acting journey in the 1980s, Robert Downey Jr. swiftly rose to prominence, garnering acclaim and even securing an Oscar nomination for his role in the 1992 film Chaplin. However, he faced a significant setback due to struggles with substance abuse, a problem he had been exposed to at an early age by his father, Robert Downey Sr.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor was reportedly introduced to marijuana at the age of six by his father. The filmmaker later regretted introducing his son to such substances, as he expressed that he was not sure if the Iron Man star could overcome such challenges and make something of himself.\n\nRobert Downey Jr.’s Father Expressed Regret For Fueling His Son’s Addiction\n\nHollywood star Robert Downey Jr. shared the complex relationship between him and his father in the Netflix documentary Sr. The father-son also opened up about their issues with substance abuse in the documentary, as the Oppenheimer star admitted that he was addicted to cocaine for 15 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also features a clip that seems to be from the time when Downey Jr. got sober, where his father reflected on his role in fostering his son’s addiction from a young age, candidly admitting it was a regrettable mistake. He said,\n\n“A lot of us did things and thought it would be hypocritical to not have our kids participate in marijuana and stuff like that—So we thought it was cute to let them smoke. It was an idiot move on our parts, a lot of us, to share that with our children.”\n\nThe clip further features Robert Downey Sr. expressing gratitude for his son’s survival, acknowledging that there were numerous instances when he feared otherwise. However, the Oscar-nominated actor has since overcome his addictions and is among some of the most acclaimed and beloved stars in the industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Downey Jr. is Grateful He Did Not Win Oscar For Chaplin\n\nRobert Downey Jr. received his first Oscar nomination for the biographical comedy-drama Chaplin. However, he lost the award to Al Pacino, who was awarded the Best Actor Oscar for the 1992 drama film Scent of a Woman.\n\nAs his performance in the 1992 film was brought up during his recent appearance on The View, the actor shared that he is grateful he did not win the award, as it would have been a false sense of validation for the path he was on at the time. Downey Jr. had struggled with substance abuse for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it is believed to have spiraled out of control after he gained recognition for movies like Less Than Zero and Chaplin. “I was young and crazy…[Winning] would have put me under the impression that I was on the right track,” he said, suggesting that the acclaim and validation might have fueled a false sense of security during a time when these issues were intensifying."
