        "text": "A celebrated director and artist, Robert Downey Sr left a legacy of avant-garde film that spans 40 years. Best described as quirky and humorous, Robert Downey Sr’s films were known for leaving half of the audience tired, confused, and displeased while the other half would be humored and intrigued about the personality behind the work they were watching.\n\nBefore he passed away in 2021, his son Robert Downey Jr. — best known for his main role in the Iron Man trilogy — decided to film a documentary to commemorate his father’s greatest achievements. The documentary was called “Sr.”, inviting potential viewers to peek into the underground film scene of New York in the light of Robert Downey Sr’s contributions.\n\nOne film in particular, Putney Swope, was marked as one of his significant works in the documentary. The film was inducted into the national film registry by the U.S. Library of Congress and was featured in multiple famous New York newspapers when it was released. The film came out in 1969 and the plot was nothing short of revolutionary at the time.\n\nPutney Swope, the only African American on the board of a failing advertising company, wins a leadership vote to become the CEO. Putney Swope seizes the opportunity and overturns the firm, hiring a workforce that is primarily composed of African Americans. He then goes on to refuse work from firms dealing in tobacco, war toys, and liquor. The company is renamed Truth and Soul and under Putney Swope’s chaotic leadership, some of the weirdest commercials get made.\n\nThe film has a scrambled feel to it, with a plot that shoots through an hour and a half of screen time. This style of haphazard filming would continue to be a strong feature of all of Robert Downey’s Sr.’s films. For the rest of his career, Sr’s work always possessed a disorganized feel. While Robert Downey Jr. has opted for more commercial films, the legacy of acting and films pushes on with the Downey name stamped on some of the most popular films in Hollywood."
