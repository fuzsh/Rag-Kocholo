        "text": "Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey have made everything from a prestige HBO series (Perry Mason) to a family-friendly blockbuster (Dolittle) together, but for the married couple and producing partners, no professional endeavor has turned emotional quite like Sr. did. The Netflix documentary, which traces the relationship between Jr. and his Parkinson’s-stricken father, the filmmaker Robert Downey Sr., evolved the deeper the producers and director Chris Smith (Tiger King) got into it. They eventually realized they were also making a film about the final days of Sr.’s life—and of his son’s pursuit of understanding him better before losing him. And Susan happened to lose her father to Parkinson’s right around the same time that Robert did. The final product of Sr., then, is a wrenching watch, made in loving and complex tribute to Sr.’s avant-garde sensibility—with his “version” of the movie actually weaved in throughout—as Jr. becomes both a crucial character on-camera and a key creative force behind it.\n\nThe movie premiered nine months ago in Telluride to critical acclaim. Now Robert and Susan continue to ride the roller-coaster of the film’s rollout, as it reaches new audiences on Netflix and enters the Emmy race. Over Zoom from their Malibu home, they speak of the project as still very much alive—a feeling reinforced by the rambling, funny, uniquely revealing nature of our conversation, which takes some unusual detours. But as we cover everything from the movie’s influence on them as filmmakers to how their relationship has grown over time, it’s reasonable—and ultimately gratifying—to expect an interview that hews from convention. It’s also, again, very much in their subject’s spirit. As Susan puts it, “There’s a lot of Sr. baked into Robert—whether he’s conscious of it or not.”\n\nVanity Fair: This is an interesting time for this interview because the movie premiered in Telluride last September, you did a press cycle, and now it’s been out for a while. Given the personal nature of it, what has the long tail of this movie being out there been like for both of you?\n\nSusan Downey: Well, the great thing about it being on a platform like Netflix is that people discover it over time. So there’s the sort of first wave of folks who watch it right when it comes out, but then what’s great is we continue to hear from people. And the thing that I think is so exciting about this movie compared to a lot of other stuff we’ve done, even if people have liked it, is the real personal conversation that is the starting point of them telling us about the movie and what it means to them. And yes, they’ll start by saying, “Oh, we really like it,” but it really immediately becomes them talking about their relationship with their parents or their father or someone going through something. [Turns to Robert] What about you, dude?\n\nRobert Downey Jr.: For us, with both of our dads having been taken by Parkinson’s, we fall into another category, without having wanted to or tried to, of probably the more instantly relatable version of this—it’s someone you know, it’s someone that’s older, and, hopefully not but as often is the case, someone you’re related to. The great thing about Netflix having the most confounding and impossible to navigate system that has ever been devised is that it is evergreen. People have finally just found it with a search, 16 weeks later. There’s something about that discovery.\n\nSusan: Now a lot of people want to dig in—everyone’s like, “How do we watch Sr.’s work? I kind of know about Putney Swope, but I wasn’t aware of the other stuff. I want to dig in deeper.” Anything that inspires people to think outside the box in an artistic realm—great.\n\nHe was a very avant-garde filmmaker, and I’m curious how making a movie in his spirit—about him, in tribute to him—made you think about filmmaking as producers on this movie and your own careers.\n\nRobert: Half of our relationship is this creative dialogue about reconciling the sequential and associative nature of what it is we try to do. And I’m not Mr. Far Afield. I’m actually a lot more logical than some of the experiences people may have wanted to report about developing things with me or shooting me. They’re all fucking liars. [Laughs] Susan is much more left of center, and the films that inspired her to go to film school and graduate first in her class, as I was long dropped out, are not the commercial things one might expect from all of the successful projects we’ve done together.\n\nThere’s an incompleteness to Sr.’s process, which you just have to chalk up to chemical dependency. There’s a bit of an unrequited thing there. Because we’re pretty darn square and functional now, there’s a bit of an onus on, “Okay, so I still think along the lines of the Sr. or just the Downey fashion, that recipe that I grew up with.” The closest I’ve ever gotten, according to my shrink, was Due Date, where Todd Phillips and I took the simplest story you could imagine and made it so weird and angry and kind of odd that it almost became like Sr. had gone to Betty Ford in 1975 and gone into the mainstream and directed this film in the mid-’90s.\n\nSusan: That’s the product?\n\nRobert: Of course you could say Todd is someone who—it’s not a chip on his shoulder, it’s that he’s always seen Hollywood for what it is, and he exists to see what he can get away with while he’s playing, trying to beat the casino at their own game. So he’s always doing two things. One is, “I’d like you to offer me negative $3 million to do this movie, and I’d like you to owe it to me on the backside in case this works out a little better than you thought.” He’s kind of a new school of maverick that has not only figured out the creative side, but also the business side in a way that is psychologically survivable.\n\nSusan: How I would answer your question—\n\nRobert: That wasn’t an answer, by the way. I just wanted to say that in response to a question you didn’t ask.\n\nSusan: I think his answer proves that there’s a lot of Sr. baked into Robert—whether he’s conscious of it or not. The part that you’re by design separating from is, How can you try and be a maverick without just completely rejecting a system and trying to do it on your own and hoping to make a living with it? There’s something that’s more survival-oriented, probably because of the way that you grew up, to do it.\n\nBut I’ll just say for me personally, the very first cut we saw of it—we hadn’t shot all the stuff in New York, going to visit him. We hadn’t shot his last days. We didn’t even know that was coming. So much of his health stuff was exacerbated by COVID keeping him in his apartment. And Parkinson’s, if you’re not mobile, it’s going to accelerate the issues. [The first cut] was more closely aligned with the original intent, which was an examination of this artist, and I sat down mildly skeptical about whether or not this had any reason to exist outside of people who knew of his work. It was a proof of concept screening in my mind. And I watched it and I was like, “You know what? This is inspirational.” Whether you know his stuff or not, here’s a guy who just tells you to think and look at something differently. We realized, “Oh my god, there’s so much more story that we have to tell here.” It was: How do we preserve that original spirit that was working in that very first cut, but then let it evolve into a story about something so much more?\n\nRobert: You know how nowadays, they’re talking about “written in the style of”? There’s this whole thing when folks say, “Hey, I kind of wrote this in your voice, Robert. I think you’re going to like it.” And I read it and I go, “I don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about.” The first cut and the first passes at this we’re kind of like, “Let’s do a Downey, Sr. doc in the style of Downey, Sr.” And all that was fine, but the real a-ha was just the storytelling 101 of, “This really needs to have a beginning, middle and an end.” And then Susan said, “It’s kind of right there in front of you. You have to realize that this guy talks about his life in the context of what movie he was shooting, what project he was doing, and his major relationships.” That’s it. That’s as much objectivity as you’re going to get from him. If it’s completely subjective, he knows how to discuss it.\n\nYou mentioned both of you losing your fathers to Parkinson’s. What was it like to navigate the creative and also just functional part of this process of making a movie amid something that was pretty emotionally intense?\n\nRobert: Elliot, her dad, had passed away at about the least opportune time to be able to gather and grieve. And we were able to do something and have a version of it a little while after the fact with a rabbi. And then we were just still in the pandemic. And then it just seemed like... Remember back then when everybody just had a million projects going on, most of which were just you might as well have just been doing a really complex crossword puzzle to keep yourself busy? There was that. Some of it I think was the avoidance of that huge loss. Sr. was no worse for the wear presently, but I think it really hit him hard when he saw that Elliot was, he was in a decline, but then when it happened, it happened rather quickly. And he went in about the most heroic way you could go and kept his dignity. I did not believe that that was going to be the case for or with my father, and I wanted to try to get the best of him while we could.\n\nSusan: Honestly, every time I watch it, I still cry, and I don’t cry easily, in general or in movies. Yeah, there’s personal elements to it, but I just think that that’s where I started to feel—once it started clicking as a movie, that’s when I had an emotional connection to it.\n\nRobert: Then there’s Sr.’s final cut.\n\nSusan: Oh my god.\n\nRobert: It’s a fever dream.\n\nSusan: It should be played at a rave on the walls.\n\nRobert: Exactly. When he saw our first cut, he was so delightful and thoughtful. He said [impersonates Sr.], “It’s got no rhythm.” After two and a half years of effort. But it found its rhythm.\n\nI know you’ve both talked about not intending to make a “tearjerker,” quote-unquote, even though it’s a very sad movie at times. At what point did you kind of realize you had to let that be a part of the film, or live within the film?\n\nSusan: I’m going to answer that. And then you can talk for another 10 minutes.\n\nRobert: Okay. Was that your subtle cue that you’re taking this one?\n\nSusan: Well—\n\nRobert: What part of “I’m going to answer this” didn’t you understand?\n\nSusan: [Laughs] So. I think that once we realized the decline of Sr. was happening, and there was an inevitability to it, and that he wanted us to keep shooting, and he wanted to keep doing his cut, and he wanted us to capture him doing his cut or at least was okay with us capturing him doing the cut—that, to me, I knew that it was going to be something deeply emotional. Before Robert was aware of it, Chris and I were saying that we set out to make this movie about Sr., so it wasn’t like we didn’t know what we were trying to do. We had intention, so we set out to make this movie about Sr., but we quickly understood that it was really about Robert trying to understand Sr. before it was too late. And it was Sr. doing his final project before it was too late…. When we all made the collective decision with Sr. and with Rosemary, his wife, to just shoot, shoot, shoot—that’s what he wanted, again—it was inevitable that there was a chance that if we built everything else right up to that point, it was going to be something pretty emotional.\n\nRobert: There’s a quote in there somewhere. Trust me.\n\nSusan: Oh, you’re acting like I’m long-winded and not making sense? Good luck for your first three answers, dude.\n\nRobert: Those weren’t answers because there was no question before that.\n\nSusan: There was absolutely a question of when we knew the movie was so emotional.\n\nRobert: Listen. I’m fucking with you. It was perfect.\n\nSusan: Okay. [Laughs]\n\nRobert: With loss of loved ones and all that stuff, it really is this thing that transcends time. I don’t know, I just consider it, I’m just so grateful we did it because it continues to be this thing for us. For a pretty large percentage of people who watch it, it winds up being this kind of abstract grieving mechanism that’s kind of like what happens when you get together when someone is near end of life passing and in celebration of them after they’re gone, where it’s kind of like the emotions are just really dialed up. It’s funnier than it is given the sadness of it. It’s more evocative than it is given the simplicity and inevitability of it.\n\nSusan: I’m sure there’s a quote in there, too.\n\nYou guys are doing great. Can you ballpark how many times you’ve seen this movie, the final cut, and if your relationship to it has changed over time?\n\nSusan: Well over a dozen. I mean, probably in the 20s, I would say.\n\nRobert: Yeah, probably 20-something times. And by the way, we’ve seen the last 10 minutes of it even more.\n\nHaving done many Q&As in my time, I know what that one’s about.\n\nRobert: There is something about any good piece of storytelling or any effective piece of storytelling, the most important parts are the first 15 minutes, where you do or don’t have the audience, and how you land. So that’s been gratifying, too. It’s kind of weird. It’s kind of like going in at the end of the process that you’ve kind of forcibly ejected an audience into. Then you just get to get a kind of like, “Oh, see how it kind of comes together?”\n\nSusan: For me, it’s not wildly dissimilar to other stuff that we’ve made and had to see a million times, where you go in, you’re sort of frozen terrified about how’s it going to play. The first time we saw it play with a proper wide audience was in Telluride. Prior to that, I’d seen it in a room with people related to it and then maybe five of us. And then we kind of finished it right before Telluride, finish-finished. Obviously there was something to show them. And you’re sort of frozen with, “Is this working at all?” And then you kind of relax and you can enjoy the next couple screenings of it. But it becomes a bit of a science. And then, I become a little desensitized to that, and just start to enjoy it again as an experience of watching it. It’s a whole evolution over the number of times.\n\nRobert: Those three, four days we spent in Telluride really were the end of the process for us in that, as you know, it was beautiful there. There was a good vibe. It felt like the world was kind of opening back up enough to do something like this. And it felt like people were ready to be transported by a bunch of different kinds of stories that were there. And we got to hang out. I’d been there previously with my dad for Two Tons of Turquoise to Taos Tonight, back in the mid-’70s. It was just this beautiful kind of closing circle, and there was no expectation on it other than just like, “People dug it. Great.” Yeah.\n\nBeautiful. Let’s end there.\n\nRobert: Okay, David, now we have some questions for you.\n\nAlright. I’m stopping my recorder.\n\nRobert: So—\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nListen to Vanity Fair’s Little Gold Men podcast now."
