        "text": "2.4 Write in the active and positive form\n\nWrite in the active voice and positive form. Direct your audience to what they need to know. Use action verbs to guide them to their next steps.\n\nWrite in the active voice\n\nIn most cases, using the active voice will help your audience understand what they’re reading. Sentences in the active voice are direct, clear and easier to understand. Their structure is logical and easy to follow because the subject is the doer of the action:\n\nsubject (the doer) + verb (the action) + object (who/what the action is about)\n\nAvoid the passive voice\n\nIn a passive sentence, it may not be clear who or what is doing the action. This makes the sentence harder to understand. The structure of a passive sentence is:\n\nObject + verb + subject\n\nExamples of active and passive voice\n\nWrite: We may ask you to provide proof of citizenship. (active)\n\nInstead of: You may be asked to provide proof of citizenship. (passive)\n\nWrite: You must file your returns electronically. (active)\n\nInstead of: Your returns must be filed electronically. (passive)\n\nThe passive voice is useful in some cases. For more on this topic, consult:\n\nWriting Tips Plus: Active voice, passive voice\n\nUse the positive form\n\nWhenever possible, tell people what they may or must do instead of what they may not or must not do to complete their task. Avoid negatives, double negatives and exceptions to exceptions.\n\nExamples of positive and negative sentences\n\nPositive: You will receive your Notice of Assessment once you’ve filed your return.\n\nNegative: You can’t receive your Notice of Assessment if you haven’t filed your taxes.\n\nPositive: You're entitled to part of the deduction.\n\nNegative: You're not entitled to the entire deduction.\n\nPositive: The procedure will be effective.\n\nDouble negative: The procedure will not be ineffective.\n\nPositive: You may claim a child born in 1972 or earlier as a dependent if they have a mental or physical disability.\n\nDouble negative: You may not claim anything for a dependent child born in 1972 or earlier unless the child has a mental or physical disability.\n\nException: Acceptable use of the negative form\n\nYou can use the negative form when something has serious or fatal consequences. The negative form will make it easier to explain what is not possible or should not be done. Do not use contractions (don’t) to make sure your audience will read and understand the statement.\n\nExamples of using the negative form for something that has serious consequences\n\nDo not try to locate the source of carbon monoxide. Leave your home immediately and move to fresh air.\n\nDo not attempt on your own as this can have serious or fatal consequences.\n\nUse verbs instead of nouns formed from verbs\n\nAvoid using nouns that are formed from verbs. Verbs alone clearly express the action needed. Always use the simplest form of a verb. When possible, use the present tense.\n\nExamples of the use of verbs instead of nouns\n\nWrite: apply\n\nInstead of: submit your application\n\nWrite: consider\n\nInstead of: take into consideration\n\nWrite: modify\n\nInstead of: make a modification\n\nWrite: needs\n\nInstead of: is in need of\n\nFor more details read:\n\nWriting Tips Plus: Turn nouns into verbs\n\nAvoid noun strings\n\nDon’t use a group of 2 or more nouns to modify another noun.\n\nThese noun strings are hard to understand. They force people to do a lot of unpacking to get at what the phrase means.\n\nWrite: standards for post-mortem evaluation of food animal carcasses\n\nInstead of: Food Animal Carcass Post-mortem Evaluation Standards\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n2.4 Rédigez avec la voix active, directe, et affirmative\n\n2.5 Avoid jargon and similar language\n\nWhere possible, avoid using jargon, idioms, metaphors and expressions. Use the clearest, most popular term for your audience.\n\nLegal and technical terms and \"government-speak\" confuse most people.\n\nPeople who don't speak English or French might use online tools to translate text. These tools do not always translate words and ideas accurately.\n\nExamples\n\nJargon:\n\nadverse effect (effect)\n\ncitizen engagement (meaningful involvement of citizens)\n\nremuneration (pay)\n\ndisclosure (making information available)\n\npro bono (legal service provided free of charge)\n\nIdiom: to hire a helping hand (meaning to hire an employee)\n\nExpression: attack your least favourite task first (meaning do your least favourite task first)\n\nMetaphor: the sun was a ball of fire (meaning the sun was very hot)\n\nIf you must include jargon familiar to your target audience, be sure to:\n\nexplain it using clear, easy-to-understand words or give an example to help non-specialists understand\n\nnever use jargon to explain jargon\n\nExamples of statements that avoid the use of jargon\n\nWrite: You have to file your income tax return (T1) by April 30.\n\nInstead of: You have to file your T1 return by April 30.\n\nWrite: Learn about savings plans that can help you save enough money to retire.\n\nInstead of: Learn about different types of savings plans that will let you build up your retirement nest egg.\n\nIdentify keywords your audience is using to find your content\n\nKeywords are the words your audience uses to find your content. They are the most common terms used to talk about, or search for, a specific topic.\n\nIf you have access to primary sources (interviews, usability research, support tickets, emails, call centre transcripts, etc.) use these sources to identify your keywords.\n\nYou can also use online keyword research tools. Tools you can use to find popular search terms include:\n\nAhrefs Free SEO Tools (no account required)\n\nBing Keyword Research (need Microsoft account to access)\n\nGoogle Trends (no login required)\n\nGoogle Keyword Planner (need Google AdWords account to access)\n\nHoth Free Google Keyword Planner (no account required)\n\nMoz Keyword Explorer\n\nYou can also use hashtag research tools to help identify trending keywords.\n\nRefer to your analytics to find out which search terms your audience uses to find related content.\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n2.5 Éviter le jargon et les expressions familières ou imagées\n\n2.6 Use short sentences and paragraphs\n\nUse simple sentence and paragraph structure. Avoid complexity.\n\nBe direct. Start sentences with the subject and verb. This structure helps people know immediately who is doing what.\n\nBe brief. Use as few words as possible to express an idea. Being concise helps everyone, including specialists, complete their task.\n\nWrite easy-to-scan content. Keep sentences and paragraphs short. This makes them easier to scan and understand by everyone, on any screen size. Keep some paragraphs to one sentence when it makes the content easier to scan.\n\nUse the following strategies to write clear, easy-to-scan content:\n\nbreak up long sentences (optimal is under 15 to 20 words)\n\navoid sentences with lots of commas\n\nkeep sentences to one idea each\n\nremove unnecessary words (modifiers, adverbs, adjectives, words that add no meaning)\n\nkeep paragraphs to one main idea and no more than 3 sentences\n\npresent a series of 2 or more ideas or words as a vertical list\n\nExamples of shortened sentences\n\nWrite: We approved your request for funding.\n\nInstead of: We received your request for funding, which we've thoroughly reviewed and approved in a timely manner.\n\nWrite: We'll consider any type of investment.\n\nInstead of: Any type of investment will be taken into consideration.\n\nExamples of concise and simple sentence structure\n\nWrite: Learn about Canada's transportation system. Find information about using paved roads, bike trails, airports and ports across the country.\n\nInstead of: Learn all about Canada's vast transportation system, including information, tools and resources about using paved roads, bike trails, airports and ports all across the country, from coast to coast to coast.\n\nExamples of a direct statement\n\nWrite: You have until April 30 to file your tax return.\n\nInstead of: The period of time that you have to file your tax return ends on April 30.\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n2.6 Utiliser des phrases et paragraphes simples et concis\n\n2.7 Explain references to legislation\n\nWhen explaining a requirement that comes from an act or regulation, avoid mentioning the act or regulation by name. Include only the information people need to complete the task.\n\nIf you must include the name of the act or regulation, always give a plain-language description. First, explain what your audience needs to know and why they need to know more about the act or regulation. Then, you may add a reference to the act or regulation.\n\nExamples of references to legislation\n\nWrite: You can apply for your child to become a Canadian citizen after they arrive in Canada as a permanent resident.\n\nRelated links\n\nCitizenship Act, section 5.1\n\nInstead of: After your child arrives in Canada as a permanent resident, you can apply for citizenship on the child's behalf under section 5.1 of the Citizenship Act.\n\nFor later mentions, you can refer to it as “the Act” or “the Legislation”. Alternatively, include an abbreviated form in parentheses after the first mention. For additional guidance and examples see:\n\nSection 4.4 abbreviations and acronyms\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n2.7 Expliquer les références aux lois\n\n2.8 Additional resources on plain language and clear communication\n\nThe following resources offer trustworthy information to help you write clearly in plain language:\n\nRelevant Writing Tips Plus articles on clear communication\n\nchoose positive over negative phrasing\n\ncoherence\n\noverview of the writing process and techniques\n\npolish your paragraphs\n\nreduce redundancy\n\nresponsibilities of writers, editors and decision makers\n\nsimplify your sentences\n\ntransition words\n\nturn nouns into verbs\n\nuse clear words and expressions\n\nuse the active voice\n\nwrite clear and effective briefing notes\n\nwrite relevant and effective emails\n\nExternal resources:\n\nContent Design London | Readability Guidelines\n\nISO 24495-1:2023 Plain language\n\nPlain Language - International Plain Language Federation\n\nPlainLanguage.gov | Plain language guidelines (US government)\n\nProvince of British Columbia:\n\nWriting web content - Province of British Columbia\n\nGovernment of British Columbia Plain language checklist\n\nWebAIM Writing Clearly and Simply Guide (external link)\n\nSee how this section applies in French:\n\n2.8 Liens vers des ressources externes sur le langage clair\n\n3.0 Tone\n\nThe tone of the government's web content should be:\n\ndirect\n\ninformative\n\nconversational\n\nprofessional\n\nWrite as if you were talking to your audience in person, but with the authority of an institution that provides information as part of its mandate.\n\n3.1 Write directly to the person\n\nUse an informal tone, and speak directly to people by using the second person (\"you,\" \"your\").\n\nExamples of statements that use the second person\n\nSend your application to…\n\nTo get this benefit you must…\n\nAddress the person in page titles, links and navigation labels\n\nFor page titles, links and navigation labels, use the possessive adjective \"your\" when the audience might consider the item being referred to as belonging to them.\n\nExamples of navigation labels that address the person\n\nChange your address\n\nReplace your card\n\nIf the subject of the title, link or label refers to general information, use the indefinite article (\"a\" or \"an\") or no article at all.\n\nExamples of navigation labels that don't use a possessive adjective\n\nStart a new business\n\nPay application fees\n\nDon't use the first person\n\nDon't switch from speaking to people to speaking on their behalf. Don't use \"I\" or \"my\" statements.\n\nExample of statements that don't use \"I\" or \"my\"\n\nWrite:\n\nHow to renew your passport\n\nRenew your passport\n\nInstead of: How do I renew my passport?\n\nException\n\nYou may use \"my\" in content, page titles and links for proper names (such as My Service Canada Account).\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n3.1 Écrire directement à la personne\n\n3.2 Use \"we\" to refer to the Government of Canada\n\nWe generally provide information to people from the perspective of the government as a whole rather than from a specific institution.\n\nUse \"we\" and \"our\" when writing on behalf of the Government of Canada.\n\nExamples of statements that use \"we\" or \"our\" to refer to the Government of Canada\n\nWrite: If you started a new claim within the last 52 weeks and there are still weeks payable on that claim, we will automatically renew your existing claim.\n\nInstead of: If you started a new claim within the last 52 weeks and there are still weeks payable on that claim, Service Canada will automatically renew your existing claim.\n\nUse \"Government of Canada\" when:\n\ndescribing Canada's stance on a topic relative to another named jurisdiction (country, province, territory city, etc.)\n\nexplaining Canada's role with respect to a topic or issue\n\nUse the name of a specific institution in situations when the:\n\ninstitution will be contacting the person\n\nperson needs to contact the institution by phone, mail or online process\n\nrole of the institution in a process is relevant to the task\n\nExamples of statements that refer to specific institutions\n\nThe Canada Revenue Agency will inform you if you have to repay benefits.\n\nThe Canadian Food Inspection Agency gives permits for some meat products.\n\nAll restricted or controlled drugs need an import permit from Health Canada.\n\nDon't include references to your website on your website.\n\nExample of a statement that doesn't refer to Canada.ca on the Canada.ca site\n\nWrite: Determine whether you're eligible.\n\nInstead of: Get more information about eligibility on the Canada.ca website.\n\nThird parties\n\nDon't provide information on behalf of another organization. Don't duplicate information provided on another organization's website. Instead, direct people to that website to get the information.\n\nName the other organization when your content refers to it.\n\nExample of a reference to a third party\n\nWrite: If you plan to travel to or transit through the United States, find out about the rules you need to follow from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nInstead of: If you plan to travel to or transit through the U.S., CBSA encourages you to visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website for information on the U.S. Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, and the requirements for entering or returning to the U.S.\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n3.2 Utiliser le pronom « nous » pour désigner le gouvernement du Canada\n\n3.3 Expressing an obligation or a recommendation\n\nAs a government organization, we often publish rules, information and instructions that are set out in law. We also provide advice on how to follow them.\n\nExpress an obligation\n\nWhen telling people about:\n\nwhat the law requires them to do, use \"must\" instead of \"legally required to\" or similar language\n\nan administrative requirement, use \"need to\"\n\nExample of statements that express legal and administrative requirements\n\nLegal: To be eligible for compassionate care benefits, you must be able to show that…\n\nAdministrative: After you apply online, you'll need to provide us with the following documents before we can finalize your claim.\n\nExpress a recommendation\n\nWhen telling people that they're allowed to perform an action:\n\ndo use \"may\" or \"might\" (expresses permission or a possibility)\n\ndon't use \"can\" or \"could\" (expresses ability)\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n3.3 Exprimer une obligation ou une recommandation\n\n4.0 Style\n\nOn the web, less is more. Keep style and punctuation simple. Formatting (such as bold, italics and underlining) and complex punctuation can be distracting and make reading difficult for many people.\n\n4.1 Capitalization and punctuation\n\nUse these styles for capitalization and punctuation of content in text, links and applications.\n\nCapitalize the main words of:\n\ntitles of official publications (such as reports, frameworks, strategies and plans)\n\ninstitution names\n\nprogram names\n\ntitles of policy instruments\n\ntitles of legislation (in other words, acts and regulations)\n\nGovernment of Canada\n\nLowercase the short form of proper names.\n\nExample of proper names and their short forms\n\nFull names: Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Canada Pension Plan, the Public Service of Canada\n\nShort form: the department, the plan, the public service\n\nAll caps\n\nDon't capitalize all the letters in a word.\n\nExceptions\n\nAbbreviations (although avoid them unless they're necessary)\n\nMilitary exercise or operation names (for example, Operation PROVISION)\n\nTitles, headings and subheadings\n\nCapitalize the first letter of the first word (sentence case) of all page titles, headings, subheadings, table captions and table headers\n\nCapitalize proper nouns in page titles, headings and subheadings\n\nDon't use punctuation at the end of page titles, headings and subheadings\n\nExceptions\n\nYou may use punctuation at the end of page titles, headings and subheadings for campaign slogans\n\nOnly use question marks when asking for information in a form, wizard, survey or quiz\n\nExample of question marks being used in forms, wizards, surveys or quizzes\n\nLists\n\nAvoid having more than 1 sentence in a single list item\n\nDon't end the list items with any punctuation\n\nWhen list items are grammatically independent of each other or follow a heading, capitalize the first letter of each list item.\n\nExample of punctuation in independent list items\n\nMost requested\n\nFinancing your new business\n\nFinancing for innovation\n\nFind a loan for your small business\n\nCanada job grants for employers\n\nWhen the meaning of list items depends on a lead-in phrase, don't capitalize the first letter of each unless it's a proper name.\n\nExample of punctuation in interdependent list items preceded by a colon\n\nRepresentatives can be:\n\ncitizenship or immigration consultants\n\nlawyers\n\nother representatives\n\nLinks\n\nUse lower case for a link in a sentence, unless the link contains a proper name.\n\nCommas\n\nRemove unnecessary commas to make web content easier to read:\n\navoid multiple commas in a sentence by breaking it up into a few shorter sentences\n\nplace a comma before \"and\" and \"or\" only if it will help people understand a list of items in a sentence\n\nHyphen and dashes\n\nHyphens and dashes have different uses. They aren't interchangeable. Avoid using dashes:\n\nuse a hyphen (-) to join words together\n\nuse \"to\" instead of the en dash (–) in a span or range of numbers, dates or time\n\nuse a comma (,) to emphasize or frame an idea instead of an em dash (—)\n\nsimplify your sentence instead of using em dashes\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n4.1 Majuscules et ponctuation\n\n4.2 Underlining, bold and italics\n\nFormatting must support the most important information on the page.\n\nDon't combine styles, like underlining and bold formatting, unless it's part of the hyperlinked text found on a topic page.\n\nUnderlining\n\nUse underlining for links only.\n\nBold\n\nUse bold for emphasis, but use it sparingly: the more you use it, the less effective it is.\n\nItalics\n\nPeople with dyslexia or other reading disorders may find it difficult to read italicized text.\n\nDon't use italics:\n\nfor design or decorative purposes\n\nto emphasize a word or phrase (use bold sparingly instead)\n\nfor long passages of text, such as quotations\n\nin page titles\n\nFollow Writing Tips Plus rules for applying italics for the following:\n\nitalics: French and foreign words\n\nitalics: legal references\n\nitalics: mathematical and scientific material\n\nitalics: titles of works\n\nLatin terms and abbreviations\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n4.2 Soulignement, caractères gras et italique\n\n4.3 Symbols\n\nSome symbols make web content more difficult to read while others improve readability. Research whether they're understood by a wide audience before using them.\n\nAmpersand\n\nSpell out the word \"and\" instead of using an ampersand (&)\n\nUse the ampersand only for proper names when it's part of a company name and in certain abbreviations, including:\n\nR&D (research and development)\n\nO&M (operating and maintenance)\n\nPercent\n\n20% (not 20 percent)\n\nA quarter or one quarter (not ¼)\n\nHalf (not ½)\n\nCurrency\n\n$100 per month\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n4.3 Symboles\n\n4.4 Abbreviations and acronyms\n\nAbbreviations are shortened forms of full terms. Both acronyms and initialisms are types of abbreviations. They are formed from the first letters of a group of words, without spaces.\n\nWrite out the long form of the term with the abbreviated form in parentheses at first mention. For example:\n\nCanadian Space Agency (CSA)\n\nDisaster Assistance Response Team (DART)\n\nOntario (Ont.)\n\nUse the abbreviation without its long form once it’s been introduced.\n\nResearch common keywords\n\nCheck your analytics to find out what keywords your audiences are using to find your content.\n\nIf you have to use a multi-word term more than once on a web page, use the full term the first time you use it. For any further uses of the term use a short form such as \"the program\" or \"the plan,\" in lower case instead of repeating the full term or using an abbreviation.\n\nExample of statements that avoid the use of abbreviations and acronyms\n\nWrite: There are 15 client contact centres across Canada.\n\nInstead of: There are 15 CCCs across Canada.\n\nWrite: The act strengthens the Government of Canada's commitment to…\n\nInstead of: The EEA strengthens the Government of Canada's commitment to…\n\nInclude abbreviations that your audience uses in your metadata (for example, in the description field) to help search engines find your page more easily.\n\nAvoid abbreviations and acronyms by rethinking the content\n\nIf your content contains a lot of abbreviations and acronyms, rethink its structure. Consider placing related content under distinct headings and sections.\n\nFor example, when introducing legal requirements, use the title of the act once, if necessary, and then talk about what people \"must\" do. The context will make it clear that the things they \"must\" do are requirements under the act. Don't use the abbreviation for the act, because it makes the text harder to follow.\n\nClose the topic before referring to other obligations under different legislation.\n\nLatin abbreviations\n\nAvoid using e.g. and i.e. Use clearer alternatives instead, for example:\n\nWrite: for example, such as, or like\n\nInstead of: e.g.\n\nWrite: that is, in other words\n\nInstead of: i.e.\n\nYou may use these abbreviations when space is limited, for example, in a table or a figure.\n\nStyles of address: How to abbreviate and punctuate titles with personal names\n\nFollow the Writing Tips Plus rules:\n\nabbreviations: titles with personal names (abbreviations for non-military titles preceding or following personal names)\n\ndoctors when using PhD, Ph.D., Dr.\n\nabbreviations: degrees and distinctions\n\nstyles of address: how to use formal and honorific titles to address individuals respectfully, both in writing and in conversation.\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n4.4 Abréviations, acronymes et référence\n\n4.5 Contractions\n\nUse contractions that people use when they speak. They're easier to scan than the full form.\n\nUse most positive contractions of auxiliary verbs. For example:\n\nyou've (you have), you're (you are), you'll (you will) or you'd (you would)\n\nwe've (we have), we're (we are), we'll (we will) or we'd (we would)\n\nUse some negative contractions of auxiliary verbs. For example:\n\ncan't (cannot)\n\ndon't (do not) or didn't (did not)\n\nwon't (will not)\n\nisn't (is not)\n\nweren't (were not) or wasn't (was not)\n\naren't (are not)\n\nUse, but don't confuse:\n\nits (possessive) and it's (it is)\n\nthey're (they are) and their (possessive)\n\nUncommon or more complex contractions can be harder for people with low literacy skills to understand.\n\nDon't use:\n\nshould've (should have) or could've (could have)\n\nshouldn't (should not), couldn't (could not) or wouldn't (would not)\n\nmightn't (might not)\n\nmustn't (must not)\n\nit'll (it will)\n\nNegative contractions: exceptions\n\nDon't use contractions when there is a critical difference between two things, for example, between doing and not doing something.\n\nExample of statements showing differences that are critical and not critical\n\nCritical: Do not drive while taking this medicine.\n\nNot critical: Most people don't have reactions to the flu vaccine.\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n4.5 Forme contractée\n\n4.6 Numbers\n\nGeneral\n\nWrite numbers as numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.), except in:\n\nproper names (First Baptist Church)\n\ntitles (Three Men in a Boat)\n\nfigurative expressions (one day, things will be better)\n\nKeep Roman numerals when used in proper names (Canada Gazette, Part II)\n\nPlace a non-breaking space (Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar) between all numeral and word combinations ($5 million, 20 years)\n\nWrite first, second, third, and so on, up to and including ninth\n\nUse the ordinal indicator in the same text size (not in superscript) for numbers 10 and above (10th, 50th, 150th)\n\nUse \"to\" instead of an en dash in number ranges (for example, $4,000 to $10,000, 4 to 10 years)\n\nAges\n\nAdults aged 30 or more\n\nPeople 30 to 65 years old\n\nA 10-year-old child\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n4.6 Nombres\n\n4.7 Dates\n\nWrite dates without an ordinal indicator (\"st,\" \"nd,\" \"rd,\" \"th\")\n\nWrite: July 31, 2016, or just July 31 if the year is already clear\n\nInstead of: July 31st, 2016, or July 31st\n\nUse non-breaking spaces between the month and the day\n\nUse the numeric date format only when space is limited (for example, in a table)\n\nwrite yyyy-mm-dd\n\nexplain the format in surrounding text (for example, notes, legends)\n\nCapitalize the first letter of the month (for example, January, February, March)\n\nAbbreviate month names when space is limited (for example, Jan, Feb, Mar)\n\nDate ranges\n\nUse \"to\" instead of an en dash in date ranges. For example:\n\ncalendar year 2014\n\nMonday to Friday\n\nMarch 29 to April 4\n\nfiscal year 2015 to 2016\n\nJanuary to March 2016 (instead of Q1, Q2, Q3 or Q4)\n\nFor date ranges like fiscal years, explain what period the range covers in surrounding text.

Content components include:\n\npage title\n\nheadings\n\nlists\n\ntables\n\nOn a web page\n\nMake sure you:\n\ndivide the page into logical sections to give an overview of the information it contains\n\nfocus on the task and show only the information people need to complete the task\n\nStructure the content components efficiently to make your page:\n\nmore visible to search engines and easier to find\n\neasier to view on mobile devices\n\nAcross multiple web pages\n\nThink about how a person will journey through the content. If:\n\nyour web page content covers too many topics, you might need to divide it into several pages\n\nseveral web pages contain pieces of content that relate to the same subject, consider combining them into a single page\n\n5.1 Write useful page titles and headings\n\nIn your page title, accurately describe what's on the page. A descriptive page title is important because search engines often display the title without the context that the rest of the page provides.\n\nMost people scan page titles and headings, looking for keywords that will confirm that they have found what they're looking for. People who use assistive technology may listen for keywords using software or may use keyboard shortcuts to access all the headings on a page.\n\nWhen writing a page title, heading or subheading, make sure that it:\n\ngives a clear idea of what follows\n\nis short and contains no unnecessary words\n\ncontains the most relevant terms at the beginning\n\nmakes sense on its own\n\nis followed by text and not by another heading, unless the heading introduces a table of contents on the same page\n\nhas no punctuation at the end\n\ncontains no promotional messaging (boastful, subjective claims) because it might confuse and stop people from navigating to the page\n\nMake the page title unique\n\nMost search engines identify relevant search results based on:\n\npage title\n\nheadings\n\nsubheadings\n\nThey display the page title as a link on the results page.\n\nUnique page titles help search engines tell the difference between similar pages. They also help ensure that people don't need to look at many pages with the same name to find the information they need.\n\nCheck whether your page title is unique by using a search engine. Search for the title of the page followed by \"site:\" and the domain extension (for example, \"food safety site:gc.ca\" or \"food safety site:canada.ca\").\n\nUse a page title, headings and subheadings to show structure\n\nThe page title, headings and subheadings help people find information on the screen easily. Use headings to divide text into logical sections approximately every 200 words.\n\nStructuring headings clearly helps establish the authority of one heading over another.\n\nFor the page title:\n\nuse this style: Heading 1\n\napply a Heading 1 only once per page\n\nFor the main sections:\n\nuse this style: Heading 2\n\ncan appear many times\n\nFor subsections:\n\nuse this style: Heading 3\n\ncan appear many times and in many main sections\n\nFor sub-subsections:\n\nuse this style: Heading 4 (and so on)\n\ncan appear many times in many subsections\n\nStructure your content with automated style features\n\nHaving clear and consistently formatted headings helps your web team produce the web pages more quickly and with fewer errors.\n\nUse the automated styles feature of your word processing software to structure headings. The styles feature clearly differentiates headings from content and helps you format headings consistently.\n\nTable of contents\n\nUse the table of contents feature from your Word processing software to automatically generate a table of contents based on the heading levels in your document. Then, check the table of contents to make sure you've correctly structured the page title, headings and subheadings.\n\nDelete the table of contents before you send the document for approval if it isn't required for the final online version.\n\nNavigation pane\n\nUse the navigation pane feature in Microsoft Word. When you select Find (or press Control + F), a small window will display all the headings in your document.\n\nPublication and program titles usually don't make good web page titles\n\nUsing the titles of reports, brochures, publications or programs as the web page title can make it difficult for people to find your content, even if it relates to their task.\n\nThe titles of publications are usually not written in plain language, short enough or descriptive enough.\n\nTo help make sure your page ranks high in search results, use page titles that:\n\nare short\n\ndescribe the page accurately\n\nare relevant to what people type into search engines\n\nWhen you post a publication online, you must adapt it for the web. Here are some things you can do to get better results:\n\nWrite a title that describes the contents of the page\n\nThe web page title (Heading1) is the title you see at the top of the page when you're looking at it. Make sure that it accurately describes, in plain language, what your publication is about.\n\nUse the first paragraph to introduce your publication\n\nThe first paragraph of your web page should introduce your publication in plain language. It helps people who've landed on the page decide whether they've found what they are looking for. You can include the title of your publication here.\n\nInclude keywords in the page's metadata\n\nUse the title tag and the description metadata field to improve where your publication ranks in search results. Here's what you can do:\n\nTitle tag: The page title tag is the blue hyperlinked text you see when a search engine generates a list of results. Write an effective page title (Heading1), and use it as your title tag.\n\nDescription metadata field: The description metatdata is the content you see under the blue hyperlinked text in search results. Avoid listing only keywords, because search engines might ignore these. Write 1 or 2 short sentences that summarize the page. Make sure they contain keywords that people use when searching for your content (for example, abbreviations familiar to your audience).\n\nRefer to the section on plain language for tips on using simple and common words as keywords.\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n5.1 Rédiger des titres et sous-titres de page descriptifs\n\n5.2 Use lists to help people scan\n\nA short vertical list is easier for people to scan and remember than a long paragraph. If possible, aim for maximum of 7 items in your list.\n\nWhen writing lists:\n\nuse positive statements as much as possible\n\nplace negatively phrased items together, if you must use them\n\nuse consistent grammatical structure. For example, if you:\n\nuse the imperative mood (or command) for the first item of your list, use the same mood for each subsequent list item\n\nstart your first item with a noun, start the other list items with nouns\n\nif a list contains more than 7 items, consider breaking it up into categories\n\nLead-in sentence\n\nIf you need to clarify the relationship between each element, start the list with a lead-in paragraph that:\n\nintroduces or applies to all the list items\n\nemphasizes the common element between all the items\n\nIf necessary, specify \"all\" or \"or\" in the introductory paragraph to clarify whether the list is comprehensive or conditional. For example, you can write:\n\n\"You must meet all of the following requirements:\"\n\n\"To be eligible, you must meet 1 or more of the following requirements:\"\n\nNumbered lists\n\nUse numbered lists to show:\n\nranking\n\norder\n\npriority\n\nstep-by-step instructions\n\nBulleted lists\n\nPlace only one idea in each bulleted item. If you need to include more information to explain an idea, use sub-bullets, but use them sparingly.\n\nExample of bulleted list items\n\nWrite:\n\nTo draft a high-quality source document:\n\norganize your ideas\n\narrange your ideas from most to least important to the task\n\ntest your order with a representative audience\n\nuse the active voice\n\nuse the right words\n\nwrite short sentences and paragraphs\n\nfollow the guidelines in the Canada.ca Content Style Guide\n\nInstead of:\n\nTo draft a high-quality source document:\n\norganize your ideas\n\narrange your ideas from most to least important to the task\n\ntest your order with a representative audience\n\ndo not use the passive voice\n\nit is important to use the right words\n\nuse only short sentences and paragraphs\n\nuse the Canada.ca Content Style Guide to ensure you have followed the guidelines\n\nTake a look at the section on capitalization and punctuation rules that apply to lists.\n\nAlphabetical lists\n\nOnly present your web content in an alphabetical order if it's the most logical and intuitive approach for the audience.\n\nFor example, listing provinces and territories in alphabetical order could be appropriate.\n\nIf you present content in alphabetical order in English, also present it in alphabetical order in French to provide the same intuitive experience.\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n5.2 Utiliser des listes d'éléments pour aider les gens à survoler le texte\n\n5.3 Use tables to organize data\n\nUse tables to organize and present data. Make sure that the:\n\nvalue of each cell relates to the column and row headers\n\nentries in a column don't contain information that could be considered a subhead\n\nvalue of each cell aligns with the column header that appears directly above it\n\nGive your table a clear title that describes the information in it.\n\nExample of a table that organizes data\n\nComparison of net budgetary authorities and expenditures for Vote 1 as of December 31, for fiscal years 2011 to 2012 and 2012 to 2013 ($ millions) Vote 1 2011 to 2012 2012 to 2013 Net budgetary authorities 287.4 252.4 Year-to-date expenditures ending December 31 184.1 154.6\n\nUse column and row headers\n\nEach column and row of a table must have a header that describes the information in that column or row.\n\nColumn and row headers are different from headings and subheadings:\n\ncolumn and row headers appear in the cells at the top and on the far left of a table\n\nheadings and subheadings refer to the title of a table or a section of content that appears on a web page\n\nCheck that there is a consistent relationship between the columns and rows.\n\nFor example, to check the table above, ask yourself whether you can align the information that appears in:\n\nthe column, with the column header that appears directly above it (\"Vote 1,\" \"2011 to 2012\" ($ millions) and \"2012 to 2013\" ($ millions))\n\na row, with the row header that defines it (\"Net budgetary authorities\" and \"Year-to-date expenditures ending December 31\")\n\nYour web team will use the information in the headers to code the table. Afterwards, screen readers will be able to correctly interpret the data within the table.\n\nIn the following example, all the cells in the first:\n\nrow are column headers and appear bolded and in grey\n\ncolumn are row headers (except the top-left cell) and appear bolded\n\nDisclosure of contracts over $10,000 from January to March 2010table 2 note * Date contract was awarded Vendor name Description Value 2010-02-01table 2 note ** ABC Business Solutions Rental of machinery office furniture and fixtures $227,703.22 2010-02-20 IT Consultants R Us Other professional services not elsewhere specified $227,956.64 2010-02-23 Management Consulting Group Limited Management consulting $285,575.89 2010-03-01 XYZ Consultants Other professional services not elsewhere specified $56,294.42\n\nTable 2 Notes\n\nTable 2 Note *\n\nFourth quarter of the April 1, 2009, to March 31, 2010, fiscal year.\n\nReturn to table 2 note * referrer\n\nTable 2 Note **\n\nDates in this table represent the year, month and day (yyyy-mm-dd).\n\nReturn to table 2 note ** referrer\n\nBy looking at the column headers \"Date contract was awarded,\" \"Vendor name\" and \"Value,\" people can understand that on February 23, 2010, Management Consulting Group Limited was awarded a contract valued at $285,575.89.\n\nUse the simplest structure possible\n\nIt can be difficult to make tables accessible and easy to read for people using screen readers or mobile devices.\n\nTo make information useful to the widest possible audience:\n\nturn a complex table into one or more simple tables\n\nconvert a table to a list if the data is simple\n\nBefore: complex table\n\nThe following table is complex and poorly designed. It would be difficult for someone using a screen reader or a mobile device to access and understand the information.\n\nExample of a complex table\n\nNational Hockey League Stanley Cup Canadian winning teams Eastern Conference Western Conference Team Wins Team Wins Team Wins Team Wins Team Wins Montréal Canadiens 22 Toronto Maple Leafs 11 Ottawa Senators 1 Edmonton Oilers 5 Calgary Flames 1\n\nAfter: simple tables\n\nThe complex table easily converts into simple tables.\n\nExample: one simple table\n\nNational Hockey League Stanley Cup Canadian winning teams Team Conference Wins Montreal Canadiens Eastern 22 Toronto Maple Leafs Eastern 11 Edmonton Oilers Western 5 Calgary Flames Western 1 Ottawa Senators Eastern 1\n\nIf it's important to highlight Stanley Cup championships by NHL conference (region), present the information using 2 simpler tables, and use table titles to clarify which conference the teams represent.\n\nExample: multiple simple tables\n\nTable 1: Eastern conference: National Hockey League Stanley Cup Canadian winning teams Team Wins Montreal Canadiens 22 Toronto Maple Leafs 11 Ottawa Senators 1\n\nTable 2: Western conference: National Hockey League Stanley Cup Canadian winning teams Team Wins Edmonton Oilers 5 Calgary Flames 1\n\nThe complex table also easily converts into 2 lists.\n\nExample: convert tables to text\n\nEastern conference National Hockey League:\n\nThe Stanley Cup Canadian winning teams\n\nMontreal Canadiens: 22\n\nToronto Maple Leafs: 11\n\nOttawa Senators: 1\n\nWestern conference National Hockey League:\n\nThe Stanley Cup Canadian winning teams\n\nEdmonton Oilers: 5\n\nCalgary Flames: 1\n\nLimit the use of texture and colour\n\nAvoid formatting cells with textures or colours, because it can make text difficult to read.\n\nIf you must use textures and colours in a table, explain what they mean (for example, in a table note or in a legend). Make sure you comply with the minimum colour contrast rules (1.4.3) from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.\n\nNever rely on colour or texture alone to convey important information.\n\nAvoid having blank cells\n\nAssistive technologies like a screen reader will notify the person if the cell is blank. If a cell has no value, explain why in your table's:\n\nnotes\n\nlegend\n\ncaption\n\nsurrounding content\n\nYou may also write one of the following in the cell, as long as it's clear and doesn't create visual noise that would distract your audience:\n\n\"no data\"\n\n\"0\" (zero)\n\n\"n/a\" (not applicable)\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n5.3 Utiliser des tableaux pour organiser des données\n\n6.0 Images and videos\n\nYou can use images and videos to:\n\nenhance key messages\n\nhelp people complete their task\n\nmake complicated information easier to understand\n\nreflect Canada's diverse population as much as possible (including seniors, youth, Indigenous peoples, and people from a wide variety of ethnic origins)\n\nWhen planning your content, weigh the benefits of using videos with the impact on people who will try to view them using mobile devices. Data plans and reliable network access vary.\n\nObtain permission to publish\n\nMake sure that you have the appropriate permissions to publish images, audio files and videos online. You'll need to have the written proof of those rights. Refer to the Procedures for Publishing or contact your institution's authoring team for more details.\n\nHelp with images, audio files or videos on Canada.ca\n\nFor specific information about consent forms or licensing requirements related to Canada.ca, contact the Principal Publisher: na-web_support-soutien_du_web-gd@servicecanada.gc.ca.\n\n6.1 Understand the purpose of images online\n\nImages can distract people. They can also make the page take longer to load. Make sure your images add value to your content.\n\nThere are 2 main types of images:\n\nfunctional images\n\ndecorative images\n\nFunctional images\n\nFunctional images:\n\nillustrate information or data to help people understand it\n\nexplain a complex concept\n\nillustrate concrete things (such as a valid passport, species at risk, standard symbols)\n\nconvey branding (such as approved logos and campaign graphics)\n\nFunctional images add value to the content because they provide more information than can be provided through text alone. Examples of functional images:\n\ninfographics\n\nillustration\n\ndiagram\n\nimage map\n\nInclude the appropriate alternative text to describe the image for people who are unable to view it.\n\nExample of functional images\n\nDecorative images\n\nUse decorative images only to provide visual context for the following templates:\n\na theme or topic page\n\nthe home page\n\ncampaign pages\n\npromotional features on a topic page or home page (Government of Canada activities and initiatives)\n\nDon't place meaningful text, such as campaign or program titles, in decorative images.\n\nGet details about the templates above in the Canada.ca Content and Information Architecture Specification.\n\nExample of a decorative image\n\nDon’t describe decorative images\n\nDecorative images don’t require a description. Their only purpose is to add visual appeal to content, not to add contextual information. The decorative image in our example just helps to create visual interest. Using a description for a decorative image gives users unnecessary information that can distract from the content on the page.\n\nAlt text for decorative images\n\nUse the null indicator as the alternative text (alt=\"\") for decorative images. This tells screen readers to ignore the image.\n\nImage sizing and placement\n\nLearn where to place images and videos on Canada.ca and what size they should be:\n\nuse the templates in the Canada.ca Content and Information Architecture Specification\n\nsee the Canada.ca page types on GitHub\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n6.1 Comprendre le but des images sur le Web\n\n6.2 Include alternative text for images\n\nAlternative text (or alt text) is text that describes an image. It makes it possible for people using assistive technologies to access the information conveyed by an image. It also helps search engines better understand the purpose of the image.\n\nWhen you're writing alternative text for a functional image:\n\ndescribe the image as if you were describing it to someone over the phone\n\nuse as few words as possible\n\nlimit the text to around 140 characters (including spaces)\n\nuse the text that is embedded in the image only if it provides enough context; otherwise, write different text that includes more information\n\nuse the null indicator as the alternative text (alt=\"\") if the image doesn't provide any more information than what is already provided in the text on the page\n\ndon't use \"image of...\" or \"graphic of...\" to describe the image; screen readers do this already\n\nDecorative images don't require additional information to make them accessible or visible to search engines. Use the null indicator as the alternative text (alt=\"\").\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n6.2 Ajouter un texte alternatif aux images\n\n6.3 Include long descriptions for complex images\n\nLong descriptions explain information that is presented in complex infographics or images. You must provide a long description if you can't describe the content and function of the image in less than 140 characters. If you can describe the image in less than 140 characters, use alternative text instead.\n\nIf a detailed and equivalent explanation of the image appears in the text immediately before or after a complex image, you don't have to provide a long description.\n\nIf you provide a long description for an image, you must also provide alternative text for the long description.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates a number of concepts. It requires a long description.\n\nExample: Long description for the balanced scorecard\n\nFigure 2 is a bar chart. The information in it came from a data table. You could therefore use the table as the long description for this image.\n\nExample: Long description for the bar chart illustrating the proportion of men and women in the public service for selected years from 1983 to 2010\n\nWork with your web team to determine the best way to include the long description information. They'll guide you on how to make sure the image is accessible to people using assistive technology. They'll also ensure that your image meets the Canada.ca Content and Information Architecture Specification.\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n6.3 Ajouter une description longue pour expliquer les images complexes\n\n6.4 Include transcripts to describe audio and video files\n\nA transcript is the text equivalent of an audio or video file. They make it easier for people who need to access information in audio or visual media but can't hear or see the content because:\n\nthey have a disability\n\ndon't have equipment such as speakers or headphones\n\ndon't want to download a large file\n\nMake sure the transcript describes all pre-recorded information and action, including:\n\non-screen text\n\ndialogue and narration\n\nimportant sounds (such as an explosion)\n\nimportant action (for example, people running away from an explosion or characters wearing disguises)\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n6.4 Ajouter une transcription pour décrire les fichiers audio et vidéo\n\n7.0 Links\n\nA link (or hyperlink) is a word, phrase or image on a web page that people click on to move to another part of the same content or to access an entirely different web resource (such as a web page, video or downloadable file).\n\nPeople who use assistive technology can navigate web content using links. For example, screen readers list all links on a page without the contextual content.\n\nYour links should be descriptive and able to stand alone so that it's clear what people can expect if they click on them.\n\n7.1 Use links strategically\n\nBe strategic about how you place and create links on a web page and about how many links you provide:\n\ninclude links that directly support the topic or task on the current page\n\nlink to the original information posted by the authoritative source\n\ndon't include links to intranet sites unless the content targets government employees, in which case you should add \"(accessible only on the Government of Canada network)\"\n\ndon't bury links that are crucial to completing a task in the middle of a paragraph or at the bottom of the page\n\nExample of appropriate use of links\n\nWrite:\n\nA Food Guide serving is how much food you should eat from each of the 4 food groups every day. In some cases, a serving is the amount of a given food group that you normally eat in one sitting, like an apple. In other cases, the daily amount is more than one serving, such as for rice or pasta.\n\nNumber of daily food servings for children, teens and adults\n\nInstead of:\n\nA Food Guide Serving is simply a reference amount. It helps you understand how much food is recommended every day from each of the four food groups. In some cases, a Food Guide Serving may be close to what you eat, such as an apple. In other cases, such as rice or pasta, you may serve yourself more than one Food Guide Serving.\n\nCarefully select related content\n\nProviding links to other relevant web pages can help people find related information quickly. Links to your pages from other pages may also help improve where your page ranks in search results.\n\nBe sure to select related links carefully. Too many links on a page can cause people to leave the page without reading important information or can discourage them from completing a task.\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n7.1 Utiliser les liens de façon stratégique\n\n7.2 Write descriptive links\n\nA link must describe the content a person will find once they click on it. It's easier to complete a task when a link's destination matches a person's expectations.\n\nTips for providing useful links:\n\nuse the first words of the target page or its entire title if it's descriptive enough\n\nstart with keywords that accurately describe the target page if the page title isn't enough\n\nmake sure that all links on the same page use unique descriptive text if they link to different target pages\n\nwhen more than one link on a web page links to the same destination page, use the same words for the hyperlink\n\ndescribe any content that must be downloaded\n\nwrite email addresses in full, in lower case and as active links (contact helpdesk@canada.ca)\n\nDon't use:\n\nthe same link text to point to 2 different pages\n\nvague statements such as \"click here\" or \"read more\"\n\npromotional messaging that might confuse someone who is deciding whether to go to the page that is being linked to\n\nFocus on the task\n\nWhen writing instructions for completing a task, sometimes you need to insert a link to guide the person to forms or other documents. Focus on the action they must perform when you create the link.\n\nDon't repeat the name of a form or document in the steps to accomplish a task if the name isn't descriptive.\n\nExample of the use of links that focus on the task\n\nWrite:\n\nTo get the highest Employment Insurance amount available to you:\n\nopen the form you need to declare your income\n\nidentify your highest weeks of insurable income in the shortest period below:\n\nthe last 52 weeks of employment\n\nsince the start of your last claim\n\nreturn the completed form in person to the Service Canada office closest to you\n\nInstead of:\n\nTo ensure that you are paid the maximum Employment Insurance (EI) benefit rate that you are entitled to, complete the Claimant Attestation - Highest Weeks of Insurable Earnings (Variable Best Weeks) form with the required information about your highest weeks of insurable earnings in the last 52 weeks of employment or since the start of your last claim, whichever is the shorter period of the two.\n\nUse parentheses for contextual information\n\nUse parentheses inside a link to add information that provides context about the linked content. Only provide necessary, contextual information to help users decide whether to proceed.\n\nThis guidance applies in the following situations:\n\nLink is to a downloadable document. Make sure to include the file type and size in the parentheses:\n\nExample: State of the Canadian Space Sector Report (PDF, 4.35 MB)\n\nLink to external content is in a different language.\n\nSome non-government web content isn't available in both official languages. If you're linking to external web content that isn't available in the language of the current page, say in which language(s) it is available after the link.\n\nAdd parentheses inside the link and specify the language of the linked content, formatted as (Language X only).\n\nDo not translate the title of the linked content.\n\nEnsure its language is indicated in the link’s code.\n\nOn an English page, write:\n\nLink text (French only)\n\nLink text (Inuktitut only)\n\nLink text (Spanish and Portuguese only)\n\nExample: To renew your French passport while abroad in Canada, follow the steps described in Effectuer le renouvellement de votre passeport (French only).\n\nFollow the same structure on French-language pages linking to English content:\n\nL’article 508 révisé, la norme EN 301 549 ou les Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) (en anglais seulement)\n\nLink opens video or audio content. Specify the length of the content inside the parentheses.\n\nExample: Using Magnifier in Windows: At a Glance - YouTube (2:07 minutes)\n\nWhen more than one situation applies, include all applicable information in parentheses.\n\nExample: Complete your application « Demande de passeport temporaire (French only, PDF 0.46 MB) »\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n7.2 Rédiger des liens descriptifs\n\n7.3 Make sure that links work\n\nMake sure that your links work and point to the correct information. Broken or outdated links are frustrating. They can cause people to lose confidence in your content.\n\nYou should check your links and update them as part of your regular content maintenance schedule:\n\nfix broken links (those that lead to a 404 \"Page not found\" message, for example)\n\nmake sure that link destinations are correct and have relevant, up-to-date information\n\nevaluate your URL redirects:\n\nmake sure they are current, redirecting people to the correct page\n\nupdate your site links so they to point to current links, not to the URLs that are being redirected\n\nverify that links point to the appropriate official language\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n7.3 Vérifier que les liens fonctionnent\n\n7.4 Linking to internal-to-government content\n\nIn most cases, public-facing content should not link to content that is accessible only through internal government networks. Occasionally, the audience for content that is accessible to the public may be primarily internal.\n\nWhen a link leads to content available only on internal government networks, write \"(accessible only on the Government of Canada network).\"\n\nSee how this rule applies in French:\n\n7.4 Créer des liens vers du contenu interne\n\nWeb content makeovers\n\nCase study A: improve plain language and content structure\n\nBefore\n\nThe Employment Insurance (EI) program offers temporary financial assistance to Canadians and individuals who are legally entitled to work in Canada, have a valid Social Insurance Number and remain in Canada during their benefit period. One type of benefits that the EI program offers is regular benefits. EI regular benefits are offered to people who have lost their employment through no fault of their own (for example, because of a shortage of work or because they were employed in seasonal work) and

pyramid approach to provide the summary or conclusion first, followed by increasingly detailed information\n\ncreated a clear title for each table\n\nupdated titles to reflect capitalization requirements\n\nused existing subheadings embedded in the original example to create table headers\n\nmade sure that the last 3 column headers reflect the unit value of the information in each column\n\nadded zeros to provide relevant information in otherwise empty cells\n\nremoved empty cells, rows and irrelevant information (underlining) and subheadings (such as those that were not aligned with the column headers)"
