Or someone who doesn't or can't love anymore, or is perhaps too damaged to love again?\n\nThe closest word I found was someone who's \"Apathetic\" but can it be used to describe an individual that has an absence of interest in love due to previous damaged relationships he's been through. Someone who is love repressed that they no longer have the desire to love again or feel emotions. Maybe a word similar to \"Anhedonia\" but to describe the inability to love again.\n\nUpdate: I'm sharing the meaning and explanation of this word \"Philophobia\", because I found it really interesting.\n\nPhilophobia, Philophobic\n\nThe fear of falling in love or emotional attachment. The risk is usually when a person has confronted any emotional turmoil relating to love in the past but also can be chronic phobia.\n\nA fear of being in love or falling in love. Usually because of past relationships or family issues. Philophobia is closely related with a previous traumatic experience involving love and relationships. If a person had any past relationship failure such as divorce, it can strongly cause philophobia in a person.\n\nDwelling on bitter memories of past relationships that didn’t go well or that ended badly, whether romantic or familial. Or the sufferer may have an intense fear of rejection and avoids relationships as a way to avoid the embarrassment of being refused by a potential lover. Others may have gone through an acrimonious divorce and be convinced that falling in love again will only lead to another painful divorce or breakup.\n\nCommon symptoms occurring in philophobia are:\n\n-Extreme anxiety and nervousness of falling in love or getting in relationship\n\n-Suppressing inner feelings as much as possible\n\n-Complete avoidance of places where couples are found such as parks and movie theaters\n\n-Avoiding Marriage and others’ wedding ceremonies as well\n\n-Isolation from external world due to the fear of falling in love\n\n-Physical signs such as shaking, racing heart beat, trouble in breathing, sweating, numbness, nausea, and even fainting when confronted with anything associated with love and romance"
