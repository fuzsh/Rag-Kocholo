Editor Neil Serven helps explain the differences between these phrasal verbs.\n\nTo give up means to stop trying to do something because you are not having success doing it:\n\nI still haven’t found a job, but I’m not giving up yet.\n\nWe spent all day looking for the dog, but we gave up when it got dark.\n\nGive up is often followed by a verb in its present participle (-ing) form:\n\nWhen nightfall came, we gave up looking for the lost dog.\n\nI’ve given up trying to reason with you.\n\nGive up can also mean to stop doing something that you have been doing for a period of time.\n\nHer doctor advised her to give up smoking.\n\nHe gave up basketball in order to focus on his musical career."
