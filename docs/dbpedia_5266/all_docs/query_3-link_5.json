        "text": "What is a thesis statement?\n\nA thesis statement clearly identifies the topic being discussed, includes the points discussed in the paper, and is written for a specific audience. Your thesis statement belongs at the end of your first paragraph, also known as your introduction. Use it to generate interest in your topic and encourage your audience to continue reading.\n\nYou can read chapter four of Schaum's Quick Guide to Writing Great Research Papers an eBook in our online collection, click the title to open: \"How Do I Write a Thesis Statement?\".\n\nAnother option is to think of a thesis statement as one complete sentence that expresses your position.\n\nNarrows the topic down to a specific focus of an investigation.\n\nEstablishes a direction for the entire paper.\n\nPoints forward to the conclusion.\n\nAlways stated in your introduction. (Usually at the end of the first paragraph).\n\nAlways take a stand and justify further discussion.\n\nA thesis statement is not a statement of fact.\n\nYour readers—especially your instructors—want to read writing that engages them. Consequently, you must write thesis statements that are arguable, not factual. Statements of fact seem easy to write about because, well, they are easy to prove. After all, they’re facts. The problem is that you cannot write engaging papers around statements of fact. Such theses prevent you from demonstrating critical thinking and analytical skills, which you want to show your instructor. If you were to write a paper around the next two statements, your writing would probably be quite dull because you would be restating facts that the general public already knows.\n\nThesis Statements always take a stand and justify further discussion.\n\nIn order to make your writing interesting, you should develop a thesis statement that is arguable. Sometimes you will be writing to persuade others to see things your way and other times you will simply be giving your strong opinion and laying out your case for it.\n\nTake a look at the following examples:\n\nStatement of fact:\n\nSmall cars get better fuel mileage than 4x4 pickup trucks.\n\nArguable thesis statement:\n\nThe government should ban 4x4 pickup trucks except for work-related use.\n\nStatement of fact:\n\nFoul language is common in movies.\n\nArguable thesis statement:\n\nThe amount of foul language in movies is disproportionate to the amount of foul language in real life.\n\nStatement of fact:\n\nCeliac disease is an autoimmune disease.\n\nArguable thesis statement/opening paragraph:"
