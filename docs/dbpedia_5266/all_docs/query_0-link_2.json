        "text": "Answer\n\nThe term kenosis refers to the doctrine of Christâs âself-emptyingâ in His incarnation. The word comes from the Greek of Philippians 2:7, which says that Jesus âemptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of menâ (ESV). The word translated âemptiedâ is a form of kenoÃ³, from which we get the word kenosis.\n\nNotice that Philippians 2:7 does not specify what the Son of God âemptiedâ Himself of. And here we must be careful not to go beyond what Scripture says. Jesus did not empty Himself of His divine attributes—no such attributes are mentioned in the verse, and it is obvious in the gospels that Jesus possessed the power and wisdom of God. Calming the storm is just one display of Jesusâ divine power (Mark 4:39). In coming to earth, the Son of God did not cease to be God, and He did not become a âlesser god.â Whatever the âemptyingâ entailed, Jesus remained fully God: âin Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily formâ (Colossians 2:9).\n\nIt is better to think of Christâs âemptyingâ of Himself as a laying aside of the privileges that were His in heaven. Rather than stay on His throne in heaven, Jesus âmade himself nothingâ (as the NIV translates Philippians 2:7). When He came to earth, âhe gave up his divine privilegesâ (NLT). He veiled His glory, and He chose to occupy the position of a slave.\n\nThe kenosis was a self-renunciation, not an emptying Himself of deity. Nor was it an exchange of deity for humanity. Jesus never ceased to be God during any part of His earthly ministry. He did set aside His heavenly glory. He also voluntarily refrained from using His divinity to make His way easier. During His earthly ministry, Christ completely submitted Himself to the will of the Father (John 5:19).\n\nAs part of the kenosis, Jesus sometimes operated within the limitations of humanity. God does not get tired or thirsty, but Jesus did (John 4:6; 19:28). God knows all things, but it seems that, at least once, Jesus voluntarily surrendered the use of His omniscience (Matthew 24:36). Other times, Jesusâ omniscience was on full display (Luke 6:8; John 13:11; 18:4).\n\nThere are some false teachers who take the concept of kenosis too far, saying that Jesus gave up all or some of His divine nature when He came to earth. This heresy is sometimes referred to as the kenosis theory, but a better term is kenoticism or kenotic theology, to distinguish it from biblical understanding of the kenosis.\n\nWhen it comes to the kenosis, we often focus too much on what Jesus gave up. The kenosis also deals with what Christ took on. Jesus added to His divine nature a human nature as He humbled Himself for us. Jesus went from being the glory of glories in heaven to being a human being who was put to death on the cross. Philippians 2:7–8 declares, âTaking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to death—even death on a cross!â In the ultimate act of humility, the God of the universe became a human being and died for His creation.\n\nThe kenosis is the act of Christ taking on a human nature with all of its limitations, except with no sin. As one Bible scholar wrote, âAt His incarnation He remained âin the form of Godâ and as such He is Lord and Ruler over all, but He also accepted the nature of a servant as part of His humanityâ (J. J. MÃ¼ller, The Epistles of Paul to the Philippians and to Philemon, p. 82)."
