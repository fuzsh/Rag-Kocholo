        "text": "The following parameters can be used to help you formulate a suitable research paper title:\n\nThe purpose of the research\n\nThe scope of the research\n\nThe narrative tone of the paper [typically defined by the type of the research]\n\nThe methods used to study the problem\n\nThe initial aim of a title is to capture the readerâ€™s attention and to highlight the research problem under investigation.\n\nCreate a Working Title\n\nTypically, the final title you submit to your professor is created after the research is complete so that the title accurately captures what has been done. The working title should be developed early in the research process because it can help anchor the focus of the study in much the same way the research problem does. Referring back to the working title can help you reorient yourself back to the main purpose of the study if you find yourself drifting off on a tangent while writing.\n\nThe Final Title\n\nEffective titles in research papers have several characteristics that reflect general principles of academic writing.\n\nIndicate accurately the subject and scope of the study,\n\nRarely use abbreviations or acronyms unless they are commonly known,\n\nUse words that create a positive impression and stimulate reader interest,\n\nUse current nomenclature from the field of study,\n\nIdentify key variables, both dependent and independent,\n\nReveal how the paper will be organized,\n\nSuggest a relationship between variables which supports the major hypothesis,\n\nIs limited to 5 to 15 substantive words,\n\nDoes not include redundant phrasing, such as, \"A Study of,\" \"An Analysis of\" or similar constructions,\n\nTakes the form of a question or declarative statement,\n\nIf you use a quote as part of the title, the source of the quote is cited [usually using an asterisk and footnote],\n\nUse correct grammar and capitalization with all first words and last words capitalized, including the first word of a subtitle. All nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs that appear between the first and last words of the title are also capitalized, and\n\nRarely uses an exclamation mark at the end of the title.\n\nThe Subtitle\n\nSubtitles are frequently used in social sciences research papers because it helps the reader understand the scope of the study in relation to how it was designed to address the research problem. Think about what type of subtitle listed below reflects the overall approach to your study and whether you believe a subtitle is needed to emphasize the investigative parameters of your research.\n\n1. Explains or provides additional context, e.g., \"Linguistic Ethnography and the Study of Welfare Institutions as a Flow of Social Practices: The Case of Residential Child Care Institutions as Paradoxical Institutions.\" [Palomares, Manuel and David Poveda. Text & Talk: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Language, Discourse and Communication Studies 30 (January 2010): 193-212]\n\n2. Adds substance to a literary, provocative, or imaginative title or quote, e.g., \"Listen to What I Say, Not How I Vote\": Congressional Support for the President in Washington and at Home.\" [Grose, Christian R. and Keesha M. Middlemass. Social Science Quarterly 91 (March 2010): 143-167]\n\n3. Qualifies the geographic scope of the research, e.g., \"The Geopolitics of the Eastern Border of the European Union: The Case of Romania-Moldova-Ukraine.\" [Marcu, Silvia. Geopolitics 14 (August 2009): 409-432]\n\n4. Qualifies the temporal scope of the research, e.g., \"A Comparison of the Progressive Era and the Depression Years: Societal Influences on Predictions of the Future of the Library, 1895-1940.\" [Grossman, Hal B. Libraries & the Cultural Record 46 (2011): 102-128]\n\n5. Focuses on investigating the ideas, theories, or work of a particular individual, e.g., \"A Deliberative Conception of Politics: How Francesco Saverio Merlino Related Anarchy and Democracy.\" [La Torre, Massimo. Sociologia del Diritto 28 (January 2001): 75 - 98]\n\n6. Identifies the methodology used, e.g. \"Student Activism of the 1960s Revisited: A Multivariate Analysis Research Note.\" [Aron, William S. Social Forces 52 (March 1974): 408-414]\n\n7. Defines the overarching technique for analyzing the research problem, e.g., \"Explaining Territorial Change in Federal Democracies: A Comparative Historical Institutionalist Approach.\" [Tillin, Louise. Political Studies 63 (August 2015): 626-641.\n\nWith these examples in mind, think about what type of subtitle reflects the overall approach to your study. This will help the reader understand the scope of the study in relation to how it was designed to address the research problem."
