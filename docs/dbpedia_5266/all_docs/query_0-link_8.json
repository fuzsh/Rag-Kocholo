        "text": "Disclaimer: The content on our website is for informational purposes only and is not legal or medical advice.\n\n“I feel like such a failure because my marriage ended. I’m sure God is disappointed with me. What will my church think of me now?! Did I let go or give up on us?\"\n\nRight after I left my abusive marriage, I immediately felt like a failure. My mind tugged back and forth trying to conclude if I had quit my marriage or if I had it let go. I was engulfed in shame and confusion.\n\nDivorce brings out many different questions and feelings. Being divorced as a Christian adds more shame because we are worried about what God and the church think of us.\n\nThe difference between letting go and giving up is considerable. Knowing the difference between the two is crucial because it will help with your mental healing.\n\nYou will be able to make healthier conclusions about yourself, what happened to you and where you are going. It is easier to heal emotionally and mentally when you know the truth.\n\nWhat Does it Mean to Give Up?\n\nWhen you give up, you are abandoning or quitting a goal, decision or intention without making an effort to change or improve the situation.\n\nFor example, in high school, I quit the girl’s volleyball team because I was intimidated by the other players. I felt I was not good enough, and therefore did not belong there. Even though I knew the game well, and LOVED it, my lack of confidence resulted in me giving up. I didn’t make an effort to practice more, talk to the coach or work on my mindset.\n\nNope. I just quit.\n\nGiving up results in a feeling of defeat which may leave us feeling frustrated, disappointed, hopeless or in despair. Giving up is also viewed as having negative connotations or attitudes attached to it because it implies a lack of resilience, determination, or perseverance in the face of challenges or struggles.\n\nGiving up can negatively affect your confidence and reinforce the belief that you can’t do something, or that you're not good enough. It can also become a pattern. After you give up once, it’s easier to give up on something else later on.\n\nGiving up causes you to miss out on opportunities and/or connections, just like I missed out on being part of the volleyball team. Why? All in the name of fear. Fear of failing, looking stupid, being rejected or abandoned.\n\nWhat Does it Mean to Let Go?\n\nLetting go means you are releasing someone or something that is no longer serving you in a positive way. You have done the hard work to try and make it work. You have analyzed the situation and the different avenues you could take to improve it. Lastly, you realize you are getting burned, left and right, and to hold on means you will continue to get hurt.\n\nFor example, when I was going through my divorce, a dear friend of mine was helping me pack my belongings. As we packed, she looked up at me and commented, “I can tell you worked hard and tried to make your marriage work. Look at all these self-help and marriage books!”\n\nShe didn't know this then, but my friend's words were a balm to my wounded heart. I HAD worked so hard to make it work, even though it ended. I struggled with feeling like a failure. However, it took that comment and intentional reflection on my part to peacefully conclude that I had LET GO of my marriage. I did not quit.\n\nThink of letting go as a proactive and intentional action you take, with the aim of creating a healthier, happier and more fulfilling life for yourself. Even though you are experiencing loss, in the end you are gaining more than you lost.\n\nWhen I left my abusive marriage, I had to acknowledge and accept that it was not working. Not because I did not try, but because he was not willing to change, I was continually at risk, and I deserved a life where I was safe and sound.\n\nMoving forward in a positive direction is a HEALTHY choice. To let go is to release. And you know what? I believe God isn’t mad at you for that!\n\nSo, Did You Let Go or Give Up on Your Marriage?\n\nEven though we don’t know each other, let’s process this question a bit together.\n\n1. Did You Fully Realize and Understand that You Were Being Abused?\n\nI know this sounds like a silly question, but really, did you?\n\nThe reality that you were abused, manipulated and have lost time (years for most of us!), due to living in domestic violence, is a hard pill to swallow.\n\nReflect on the reason you left.\n\nIn short, if you left because you were being abused, and your partner wouldn't change, you didn’t quit.\n\n2. Did You Try to Make the Marriage Work?\n\nAlrighty, please don't read this title and assume I’m implying it was your responsibility to make an abusive marriage “work”. Because it wasn't. You didn't have a marriage problem. Domestic violence isn’t a marriage problem, but an individual’s problem. Your husband had problems he chose not to change.\n\nDomestic violence isn’t a marriage problem, but an individual’s problem.\n\nHowever, were you like me and tried HARD to change yourself to make it work? Did you research marriage tips, read the Bible, went for marriage counselling together (I bet that didn't work!) or talk to your pastor?\n\nMy goal is to help you reflect on all the individual efforts you made during the years of your marriage. Even though most of them probably didn't obtain the outcome you hoped for, I bet you tried numerous things to bring more happiness and peace to your home.\n\nGod saw all your efforts, heard all your prayers and kept all your tears.\n\nI’m sure you tried sis! I’m really sure you did.\n\nBut it wasn’t your problem to fix.\n\n3. How Did Staying in the Marriage Affect You?\n\nWhat was life like for you? How did the abuse affect your mental, physical and emotional health? How did the abuse affect your children?\n\nTake some time to really reflect on what life was like for you then.\n\nTo be honest, when I think about my story, life was like a slow death. The abuse affected EVERY area of my life. It was daunting to think of leaving, and I worried about what life would look like on the “other side.”\n\nNow, Release\n\nThere are many more prompting questions we could ponder together. However, I believe these 3 have stirred enough thoughts, emotions and contemplations within you.\n\nDo you remember what letting go means? In brief, it means to release something or someone that you have concluded is causing you more harm than good. If your answers to the above questions painted a picture of a life that was filled with abuse, a husband that refused to change, and a decline in your well being and quality of life, then my sister, you LET GO.\n\nRelease the shame, guilt, fear and defeat that comes from trauma and divorce, whether you are receiving that from yourself or others within the Christian community.\n\nYou chose YOU. You chose LIFE.\n\nYou. Let. Go.\n\nWhy is Letting Go So Hard?\n\nLetting go is terrifying, even though it may bring you relief or a desired outcome. For example, when I left my ex husband, I found some relief in leaving the abuse, the walking on eggshells and the feeling of imprisonment. However I was scared of starting over, of all the unknowns, the stigma of divorce, what God would think of me, and the vulnerable season I was entering.\n\nIt is hard to let go because you don't know the future. The phrase “better the devil you know, then the devil you don’t know” perfectly describes why many people choose to stick with what they know, even if it's negatively affecting them.\n\nWe are afraid. And leaving an abusive relationship involves risks and barriers.\n\nBut, who is the father of all lies and loves to keep us living in a bondage of fear?\n\nThe enemy.\n\nHe throws lies at survivors such as, “You will never make it on your own”, “No one else will ever love you”, “God is mad at you”, “You are damaged goods”, “Good Christians don’t divorce” or “You’re a quitter.”\n\nHow do we combat lies? With truth!\n\nGod says in Proverbs 3: 5-6 AMP, “Trust in and rely confidently on the Lord with all your heart And do not rely on your own insight or understanding. In all your ways know and acknowledge and recognize Him, And He will make your paths straight and smooth [removing obstacles that block your way].”\n\nThis verse gives us courage and assurance that God is with us when we take leaps into the unknown. He won’t let us fumble around forever, like blind mice. He is a good father that directs our steps, provides for us, and makes a path through our obstacles. Fear not.\n\nWith fears come worries. As a survivor you have a LOAD of worries and concerns. 1 Peter 5:7 AMP states, “casting all your cares [all your anxieties, all your worries, and all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares about you [with deepest affection, and watches over you very carefully].”\n\nI think casting our cares is a daily choice and lifestyle. It’s really difficult to let go, and then immediately cast all your cares and worries over to God without feeling mixed emotions or fighting the temptation to take back control from God.\n\nRest assured that God is strong enough to hold your worries. Every single worry that comes with letting that situation go, is not intimidating to Him.\n\nHow Letting Go Will Help Your Healing\n\nAgain, you aren’t “bad”, or a failure or a 'bad Christian' because you left an abusive marriage. You released a toxic person from your life and invited healing, love and a better future.\n\nNow that you realize you let go vs. gave up, you have changed your mindset about yourself and your decision to leave. This can take you to a new level of healing mentally and emotionally.\n\nIn my opinion, healing our minds and hearts is the hardest to repair after domestic abuse.\n\nOur healing is hindered by negative beliefs and strongholds in our life. So instead of shaming yourself with the label of “quitter” or “disappointment”, you can assign positive labels to yourself such as “self-love”, “overcomer”, and “daughter of the King.”\n\nDoesn't that feel better already?\n\nIt may be helpful to seek support from a professional who can help you process your trauma if you feel you need this. They can also help you develop new goals and aspirations as you move forward.\n\nLet's Recap\n\nAs we have discussed, there is an ample difference between letting go and giving up. Letting go often releases you into new chapters, opportunities and a better version of yourself. Giving up is often a result of a negative mindset or attitude about something, leaving you with feelings of frustration, defeat or shame.\n\nBut you’re not a quitter.\n\nYou’re an overcomer.\n\nYour future is yours again, and your steps are directed by God. There is no shame for letting go. I’m proud of you!\n\nShare this article with other survivors, family and friends to help us raise awareness of domestic violence and educate the church and community.\n\nWe are stronger together.\n\nHe is faithful,"
