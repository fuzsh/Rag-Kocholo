        "text": "Purpose of this fact sheet: This fact sheet gives a summary of the rule. The summary is designed to provide introductory information about the rule’s requirements, particularly for people who may not have a legal background. For more information, please read the full rule. The official version of the rule is published in the Federal Register.\n\nWhat is Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)?\n\nTitle II of the ADA requires state and local governments to make sure that their services, programs, and activities are accessible to people with disabilities. Title II applies to all services, programs, or activities of state and local governments, from adoption services to zoning regulation. This includes the services, programs, and activities that state and local governments offer online and through mobile apps.\n\nTerms in this fact sheet\n\nTitle II uses the term “public entities” to describe who it applies to, but in this fact sheet, we call these “state and local governments.”\n\nWhat is a rule?\n\nA regulation, also called a “rule,” is a set of requirements issued by a federal agency for laws passed by Congress. When Congress passed the ADA, it gave the Department the authority to make regulations that explain the rights and requirements for Titles II and III of the ADA. A regulation usually has two parts. The first part is regulatory text. The second part provides information about the regulatory text and what it means, which is sometimes in an appendix in the rule.\n\nHow did the Department make this rule?\n\nThe Department made this rule using a process sometimes called “notice and comment rulemaking.” As part of this process, the Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). The NPRM was basically a first draft of the regulation. It let the public know about the requirements the Department was considering and gave an opportunity for feedback.\n\nThe Department got feedback from the public on the NPRM. Based on that feedback, the Department made changes to certain parts of the rule. A description of the feedback the Department got and how it updated the rule is available in the appendix in the rule.\n\nWho has to follow the web and mobile app accessibility requirements in the rule?\n\nLike the rest of Title II, the rule applies to all state and local governments (which includes any agencies or departments of state or local governments) as well as special purpose districts, Amtrak, and other commuter authorities.\n\nState and local governments that contract with other entities to provide public services for them (like non-profit organizations that run drug treatment programs on behalf of a state agency) also have to make sure that their contractors follow Title II.\n\nExamples of state and local governments include:\n\nState and local government offices that provide benefits and/or social services, like food assistance, health insurance, or employment services\n\nPublic schools, community colleges, and public universities\n\nState and local police departments\n\nState and local courts\n\nState and local elections offices\n\nPublic hospitals and public healthcare clinics\n\nPublic parks and recreation programs\n\nPublic libraries\n\nPublic transit agencies\n\nFor more information about the responsibilities of state and local governments under Title II, visit our State and Local Governments page.\n\nThe Reasons the Department Set Specific Requirements for Web and Mobile App Accessibility\n\nState and local governments provide many of their services, programs, and activities through websites and mobile apps. When these websites and mobile apps are not accessible, they can create barriers for people with disabilities.\n\nFor example, individuals who are blind may use a screen reader to deliver visual information on a website or mobile app as speech. A state or local government might post an image on its website that provides information to the public. If the website does not include text describing the image (sometimes called “alternative text” or “alt text”), individuals who are blind and who use screen readers may have no way of knowing what is in the image because a screen reader cannot “read” an image.\n\nWebsites and mobile apps that are not accessible can make it difficult or impossible for people with disabilities to access government services, like ordering mail-in ballots or getting tax information, that are quickly and easily available to other members of the public online. Sometimes, inaccessible websites and mobile apps can keep people with disabilities from joining or fully participating in civic or other community events like town meetings or programs at their child’s school.\n\nThis rule will help make sure people with disabilities have access to state and local governments’ services, programs, and activities available on websites and mobile apps. This rule will also provide state and local governments with more clarity about what they have to do to comply with the ADA.\n\nYou can find more information about why the Department made this rule in the section of the rule called “Need for Department Action.”\n\nHighlights of the Requirements in the Rule\n\nThe rule’s requirements for making web content and mobile apps accessible are highlighted below. The full rule explains these requirements in more detail.\n\nRequirement: The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Version 2.1, Level AA is the technical standard for state and local governments’ web content and mobile apps.\n\nThis rule sets a specific technical standard that state and local governments must follow to meet their existing obligations under Title II of the ADA for web and mobile app accessibility.\n\nWCAG, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, is a set of guidelines that say what is needed for web accessibility, such as requirements for captions for videos. WCAG is developed by the World Wide Web Consortium.\n\nYou can find more information about why the Department picked WCAG 2.1, Level AA as the technical standard for state and local governments’ web content and mobile apps in the rule in the section of the appendix called “Technical Standard—WCAG 2.1 Level AA.”\n\nWhat is a technical standard?\n\nA technical standard says specifically what is needed for something to be accessible. For example, the existing ADA Standards for Accessible Design are technical standards that say what is needed for a building to be physically accessible under the ADA, such as how wide a door must be or how steep a ramp can be.\n\nRequirement: State and local governments’ web content usually needs to meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA.\n\nThe rule applies to web content that a state or local government provides or makes available. This includes when a state or local government has an arrangement with someone else who provides or makes available web content for them.\n\nExample: If a county web page lists the addresses and hours of operation for all county parks, that web page must meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA even if a local web design company made the web page and updates it for the county.\n\nWhat is web content?\n\n“Web content” is defined as the information and experiences available on the web, like text, images, sound, videos, and documents. You can find more information about how the Department defines “web content” in the rule in the section of the appendix called “Section 35.104 Definitions.”\n\nRequirement: State and local governments’ mobile apps usually need to meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA\n\nThe rule applies to mobile apps that a state or local government provides or makes available. This includes when a state or local government has an arrangement with someone else who provides or makes available a mobile app for them.\n\nExample: If a city lets people pay for public parking using a mobile app, that mobile app must meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA even if the app is run by a private company.\n\nWhat is a mobile app?\n\nMobile apps are software applications that are downloaded and designed to run on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. You can find more information about how the Department defines mobile apps in the rule in the section of the appendix called “Definitions.”\n\nCan state and local governments provide web content or mobile apps that follow a higher standard than WCAG 2.1, Level AA?\n\nYes, this rule does not stop a state or local government from using designs, methods, or techniques as alternatives to WCAG 2.1, Level AA if the state or local government can prove the alternatives provide the same or more accessibility and usability. The rule refers to this as “equivalent facilitation.” The rule allows this so that state and local governments can have some flexibility, while also making sure that people with disabilities still have equal access to state and local government web content and mobile apps.\n\nExample: There may be new web accessibility standards that are developed in the future, such as WCAG Version 3.0. Under this rule, a state parks department would probably be allowed to create a new mobile app for campground reservations that meets a future standard if the standard provides the same or more accessibility and usability than WCAG 2.1, Level AA.\n\nExceptions: In limited situations, some kinds of web content and content in mobile apps do not have to meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA.\n\nIt is important that state and local governments can prioritize so they can choose the most important content—like current or commonly used information—to make accessible to people with disabilities quickly.\n\nThere are limited exceptions for some kinds of content that are not as frequently used or that may be particularly hard for state and local governments to address right away.\n\nIf an exception applies to certain content, it means that content would not have to meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA.\n\nIn the next section, we describe the exceptions and provide examples of how they might apply. We also give examples of when the exceptions would not apply.\n\nWhat the exceptions do not change\n\nThe ADA requires that state and local governments must provide individuals with disabilities with effective communication, reasonable modifications, and an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from their services, programs, and activities. So even when web content or content in mobile apps does not have to meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA, a state or local government would likely still need to provide the content to a person with a disability who needs it in a format that is accessible to them.\n\nLearn more about existing ADA obligations to ensure effective communication.\n\nLearn more about existing ADA obligations to make reasonable modifications.\n\nSummary of the Exceptions\n\n1. Archived web content\n\nState and local governments’ websites often include a lot of content that is not currently used. This information may be outdated, not needed, or repeated somewhere else. Sometimes, this information is archived on the website.\n\nWeb content that meets all four of the following points would not need to meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA:\n\nThe content was created before the date the state or local government must comply with this rule, or reproduces paper documents or the contents of other physical media (audiotapes, film negatives, and CD-ROMs for example) that were created before the government must comply with this rule, AND\n\nThe content is kept only for reference, research, or recordkeeping, AND\n\nThe content is kept in a special area for archived content, AND\n\nThe content has not been changed since it was archived.\n\nExample: A water quality report from 1998 that a state has stored in an “archive” section of its website and has not updated would probably fall under the exception. The exception would also probably apply to handwritten research notes or photos that go with the 1998 water quality report that the state scans and posts to its website in the archive section.\n\n2. Preexisting conventional electronic documents\n\nSome state and local governments have a lot of old documents, like PDFs, on their website. It can sometimes be hard to make these documents meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA.\n\nDocuments that meet both of the following points usually do not need to meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA, except in some situations:\n\nThe documents are word processing, presentation, PDF, or spreadsheet files; AND\n\nThey were available on the state or local government’s website or mobile app before the date the state or local government must comply with this rule.\n\nExample: This exception would probably apply to a PDF flyer for a Thanksgiving Day parade posted on a town’s website in 2018, or a Microsoft Word version of a sample ballot for a school board election posted on a school district’s website in 2014.\n\nWhen the exception does not apply: Documents that are currently being used to apply for, access, or participate in a state or local government’s services, programs, or activities do not fall under the exception even if the documents were posted before the date the government has to comply with the rule.\n\nExample: A state posted a PDF version of a business license application on its website in 2020. Members of the public still use that PDF to apply for a business license after the date the state has to comply with the rule. The exception would not apply to the application and it would usually need to meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA.\n\n3. Content posted by a third party where the third party is not posting due to contractual, licensing, or other arrangements with a public entity\n\nThird parties sometimes post content on state and local governments’ websites or mobile apps. Third parties are members of the public or others who are not controlled by or acting for state or local governments. The state or local government may not be able to change the content third parties post.\n\nContent that is posted by third parties on a state or local government’s website or mobile app would not need to meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA.\n\nExample: A message that a member of the public posts on a town’s online message board would probably fall under the exception.\n\n4. Individualized documents that are password-protected\n\nState and local governments sometimes use password-protected websites to share documents that are for specific individuals, like a water or tax bill. It might be hard to make all of these documents accessible right away for everyone, and there might not be a person with a disability who needs access to these documents.\n\nDocuments that meet all three of the following points do not need to meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA:\n\nThe documents are word processing, presentation, PDF, or spreadsheet files, AND\n\nThe documents are about a specific person, property, or account, AND\n\nThe documents are password-protected or otherwise secured.\n\nExample: A PDF version of a water bill for a person’s home that is available in that person’s secure account on a city’s website would probably fall under the exception. However, the exception does not apply to the city’s website itself.\n\n5. Preexisting social media posts\n\nFor many state and local governments, making all of their past social media posts accessible may be impossible. There also may be very little use to making these old posts accessible because they were usually intended to provide updates about things happening at the time they were posted in the past.\n\nFor these reasons, social media posts made by a state or local government before the date the state or local government must comply with this rule do not need to meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA.\n\nExample: This exception would apply to a 2017 social media post by a city’s sanitation department announcing that trash collection would be delayed due to a snowstorm.\n\nOther Information About Complying with the Rule\n\nUse of Conforming Alternate Versions\n\nSometimes a state or local government tries to have two versions of the same web content or content in a mobile app: one version that is not accessible and another version that is accessible and provides all the same information and features. The second version is called a “conforming alternate version.”\n\nUsually state and local governments should not have a main web page that is inaccessible and a separate accessible version of the same content, because people with disabilities should get equal access to that content on the same page.\n\nUnder the rule, state and local governments may use conforming alternate versions as an alternative to inaccessible content only in very limited circumstances. State and local governments are allowed to do this only when there is a technical or legal limitation that prevents inaccessible web content or mobile apps from being made accessible.\n\nFor more information about conforming alternate versions and when they are allowed, see the final rule in the section of the appendix called “Section 35.202 Conforming Alternate Versions.”\n\nWhat if an individual with a disability still cannot access web content and mobile apps that meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA?\n\nSometimes an individual with a disability may not be able to access a state or local government’s web content or mobile apps even if they meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA. If this happens, the state or local government is not required to make more changes to its web content or mobile apps that meet the technical requirement, but the government must still satisfy its other obligations under the ADA to provide individuals with disabilities with effective communication, reasonable modifications, and an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from their services, programs, and activities. The state or local government must figure out on a case-by-case basis how best to meet the needs of the individual with a disability.\n\nExample: If a person’s disability stops them from accessing a county's mobile app that meets WCAG 2.1, Level AA to buy tickets to the county's annual fair, the county needs to provide an alternative way for the person to purchase tickets.\n\nWhat Happens If a State or Local Government Has Failed to Meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA in a Minor Way?\n\nIn some limited situations, state and local governments may be able to show that their web content or mobile apps do not meet WCAG Version 2.1, Level AA in a way that is so minor that it would not change a person with a disability’s access to the content or mobile app. If the state or local government can show that, then they are not violating the rule.\n\nState and local governments cannot use this part of the rule to avoid trying to meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA. If a state or local government’s web content does not fully meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA, there are many things the government would have to prove to show that they did not violate the rule.\n\nExample that violates the rule: A state’s online renewal form does not meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA. Because of that, a person with a manual dexterity disability may need to spend a lot more time to renew their professional license online than someone without a disability. This person might also need to get help from someone who does not have a disability, give personal information to someone else, or go through a much harder and frustrating process than someone without a disability. Even if this person with a disability could ultimately renew their license online, the state would violate the rule.\n\nExample that meets the rule: A state’s web page with information about a park has text with a color contrast ratio that is 4.45:1. WCAG 2.1, Level AA requires a color contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for this text. It can be hard for some people with vision disabilities to see text on a web page if there is not enough contrast between the color of the text and the background color. But that very small difference in color contrast ratio probably would not change whether most people with vision disabilities could read the text on the website and access the information about the park. If the state can prove the difference in color contrast is so small that it would not make it harder for people with disabilities to access the information about the park, the state would not violate the rule.\n\nFor more information, see the final rule in the section of the appendix called “Section 35.205 Effect of Noncompliance That Has a Minimal Impact on Access.”\n\nHow Long State and Local Governments Have to Comply with the Rule\n\nState and local governments must make sure that their web content and mobile apps meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA within two or three years of when the rule was published on April 24, 2024, depending on their population.\n\nYou can find more information about why the Department is requiring compliance with this timeline in the rule in the section of the appendix called “Requirements by Entity Size.”\n\nThis table shows how much time a state or local government has to comply with this rule. State and local government size Compliance date 0 to 49,999 persons April 26, 2027 Special district governments April 26, 2027 50,000 or more persons April 24, 2026\n\nAfter this time, state and local governments must continue to make sure their web content and mobile apps meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA.\n\nADA Information Resources\n\nIf you have questions about this rule or the ADA, you can call the Department’s ADA Information Line.\n\nAnother source of information is the ADA National Network. The National Network includes ten regional centers that provide ADA technical assistance to businesses, state and local governments, and individuals with disabilities. One toll-free number connects you to the center in your region: 800-949-4232 (Voice and TTY)."
