        "text": "I was pregnant at the age of 20, it was an accident and by about 5 months pregnant, my relationship had broken down and I was back living at home with my parents. This was 1985.\n\nOne day I was discussing names for the baby with my Mum and I said I‚Äôd settled on the name Joshua, I loved it. Mum turned to me and scoffed at what an awful name it was, and in that moment I dropped the name and I settled on Christopher.\n\nI‚Äôve always regretted that I didn‚Äôt stick to my guns but Mum was very influential in my and my sisters lives although she was in no way an ogre and we thought the world of her.\n\nI also remember my sister getting married at 22 and without asking her, Mum went out and bought reams of pink material to make sister a wedding dress. Sister hated the colour but didn‚Äôt dare say anything and she got married in that dress.\n\nI can‚Äôt imagine my own son putting up with that behaviour from me and neither would I want him too or ever do anything like that over his head.\n\nDo you have any similar stories, serious or funny?\n\nDue to a split in the family I spent my childhood envying my cousins their middle class lifestyles. I came to resent my mother for \"marrying down\" (as my grandmother called it) and therefore denying her children the same lifestyle. I can remember my pre-teens and teens as a constant battle to assert my independence and aspire to something better.\n\nMy parents took it for granted that I would get a working class job (shop or factory) marry a working class man and have a bunch of kids.\n\nI did none of these things.\n\nFrom the time I left home at 22 my parents had even less influence in my life. My grandmother was my main influence.\n\nSo many ways.\n\nThey really made me feel worthless and like I wasn't capable of anything. I gave up trying to please them quite early in life and was suicidal as a teen...Desperate to escape their controlling ways, I ended up as a teenager in an abusive relationship and everything continued to be \"my fault\" for many more years and then in an extended way because that abuser told damning lies when I managed to escape.\n\nEventually I started a new life, held my head up high even if only I knew the truth, and found success in all the things that were always in me, that they had seen my potential and tried to squash. I regret listening to selfish, controlling and abusive people who didn't have my best interests at heart.\n\nI was born bolshy. Yes, of course in childhood my parents did provide the environment I grew up in, but I find it difficult to think of anything where I conformed to their wishes and regretted it.\n\nGenerally, I either did as I wished, but didn't tell them what I was doing, or on minor things I did do as they wish. I mean they were my parents, I did love them, and any relationship involves a certain amount of compromise.\n\nAt 18 I went away to university a long way from home so they ahd no idea what I got up to there. By the time I graduated and returned home for a year I was 21, the age ofadulthood then and my parents always respected the autonomy that gave me.\n\nI wish my parents HAD actually sat me down and given me advice. But I'm not sure that I would have heeded it or that it would have been wise advice in any case. My parents were not particularly intelligent - particularly my mother. I do not recall any occasion when they made positive suggestions to me about anything very much. I made an awful lot of mistakes in my early life and had to work out everything for myself. By the skin of my teeth at times I got through life.\n\nI wish I‚Äôd had the wherewithal and common sense to say hold on a minute that‚Äôs not what I want to do at all, it‚Äôs my life let me decide. But I went along with their wishes, was miserable and left home as soon as I could.\n\nI loved them and they loved me but they expected greater things from me and I wasn‚Äôt able to carry it off.\n\nEvery time my parents gave me advice it was wrong. I used to listen and respect their advice and then when it went wrong I thought it was my fault.\n\nAs an adult I realised they were causing mischief on purpose, like giving me the wrong directions to go somewhere so I'd get lost or be late. They later told me I'd die young and said how much better other people were than me. They tried to put all kinds of awful life limiting beliefs on me. I distanced from them for my own mental well being although I looked after them when elderly. They didn't really deserve that, but I never intended on being like them, so there's that.\n\nI suppose we all have to remember that each generation has its own values and beliefs. When I was a small child in the 1950s virtually everyone went to church and children went to Sunday School. Women stayed at home and looked after children. Men went to work and often to the pub - women only went when accompanied by a man. Women usually did not drive. Homosexuality was illegal. Capital punishment existed. There are so many examples like this so it is no wonder that our parents thought differently to us. And of course our children will think the same about us.\n\nI am grateful to my parents for giving me the opportunity o make the most of education, even though there was no money and they probably would have welcome another wage coming in to the household.\n\nSo I was brought up to appreciate that money has to go a long way and to think twice before spending it on anything other than necessities. I save rather than spend. The downside is that I find it quite hard to spend money.\n\nI had good, loving parents who instilled in me the virtues of honesty, decency, and hard work.\n\nBut they didn‚Äôt encourage me to branch out. At a careers meeting at school, I was interested in joining the police force, the police reps seemed to think I would be suitable.\n\nI went home, told my parents, Dad‚Äôs attitude was, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd never stand it, it‚Äôs not for you‚Äù.\n\nPut me off. What did I end up doing? Worked in a local bank. Safe, steady, living at home‚Ä¶. Even thought about going to London to work in the bank there, back then the city was always short handed and begging for relief staff. .\n\n‚ÄúWhy do you want to do that? You‚Äôve got a good job locally‚Äù.\n\nDid I go? No.\n\nIs it any wonder I encouraged my own daughter to work away from home, travel, live in other countries?\n\nü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nbiglouis, but did you never consider that if your mother had married someone else, you wouldn't exist at all. there wouldn't have been a comfortable confident version of you holding tea-parties with cucumber sandwiches\n\nMy mother jilted her fiance while he was away serving in the war and fell pregnant by a man who worked on the docks. It was a time when a single man who got a girl pregnant HAD to marry her. My grandparents disowned her. Real life is not like Downton Abbey where the Earl forgives his daughter for running off with the chauffeur,\n\nI later met the man who should have been my father. He was introduced to me by my grandmother as \"Uncle Jim\" and I did not learn the full story until I was 19. Uncle Jim never married after my mother broke with him. He maintained a friendship with my grandmother who was very fond of him. Sadly he died prematurely asa result of wounds sustained in the war He left money in his will to my grandmother, asking that she use it \"as she thought best\" to help the daughter he never had (me).\n\nIt was that money that helped me go to university as a mature student. Had I been Uncle Jim's daughter I would certainly have gone at 18.\n\nOh god, where to start? I have spent most of my life believing that I am never good enough, thanks to my mother! I was very academic and my teachers fully expected me to go to university and I certainly had the grades to do so, but my mother told me very firmly not to 'get ideas above my station' and that they couldn't afford it. I say now that I could have grown up to invent a cure for cancer and bring about world peace and it still wouldn't have been enough for my mother. It's just a shame it took me the best part of 50 years to realise that.\n\nMy parents were people of their time, born in the early 1900s. Dad felt University was for males. I believe I could have finished, however my husband and I quite wanted to marry and have babies.\n\nI was 16 when I left school, happily married that week - I do wonder, slightly, how my life would differ. However, I'm not one to be managed, programmed, told what to do - my life has been as God planned, perfect for me."
