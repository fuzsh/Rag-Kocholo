        "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex left the UK after stepping back from official royal duties.\n\nThe couple has since launched various commercial ventures, including a new lifestyle brand headed by Meghan Markle called American Riviera Orchard.\n\nWhy did Harry and Meghan leave the Royal Family?\n\nHarry and Meghan met in 2016 and married in 2018. They stepped down as senior royals in January 2020.\n\nAngry about media intrusion, they were frustrated that Buckingham Palace stopped them developing their \"SussexRoyal\" brand.\n\nHarry remains a prince and is fifth in line to the throne.\n\nThe couple kept their Duke and Duchess of Sussex titles, but are no longer addressed as his or her royal highness (HRH). Harry also gave up his military titles.\n\nWhen Harry's father Charles became King, the couple's two children became Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet of Sussex.\n\nWhere do Harry and Meghan live?\n\nHarry and Meghan moved to California in June 2020, saying they wanted space to raise Archie. Lilibet was born there in 2021.\n\nThe couple no longer has an official UK residence.\n\nIn early 2023, they were asked to vacate Frogmore Cottage, a Grade-II listed property on the Windsor estate.\n\nIn April 2024, documents filed to Companies House listed the US as the country where Harry is usually resident, instead of the UK.\n\nThe change was dated 29 June 2023, thought to be the date the couple formally left Frogmore Cottage.\n\nThe conservative US think tank The Heritage Foundation has raised questions about Harry's immigration status because of his previous comments about taking cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms.\n\nDrug use can block US visa applications.\n\nDo Harry and Meghan still come to the UK?\n\nOn 8 May, the duke attended a service at St Paul's Cathedral in London to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, the sporting competition for injured servicemen and women which he helped found.\n\nHe did not see his father Charles or his brother William during his brief visit.\n\nIn February, he flew back for a 45-minute meeting with Charles after Buckingham Palace announced that the King was being treated for cancer.\n\nThe duke has also returned to London several times for his various court cases against newspaper publishers.\n\nHarry attended the King's coronation in May 2023 without Meghan.\n\nThe duke and duchess both came back to the UK for the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee in June 2022, and her funeral in September of that year.\n\nHow do Meghan and Harry earn their money?\n\nAs working royals, they received 95% of their annual income from Harry's father, then Prince of Wales. The taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant made up the other 5%.\n\nWhen they stepped down as senior royals, King Charles gave them \"a substantial sum\" to help establish their new life.\n\nHarry and Meghan set up the Archewell charitable foundation, and entered into a number of commercial arrangements with private companies.\n\nIn February 2024 the couple launched their Sussex.com website, which says they are \"shaping the future through business and philanthropy\".\n\nAmerican Riviera Orchard\n\nIn March 2024, Meghan launched what appeared to be a new lifestyle brand, American Riviera Orchard.\n\nLittle is known about the new venture, but in April 2024, pictures of branded jam jars circulated on social media, suggesting it may sell food products.\n\nTelevision and podcasts\n\nThe Sussexes' media company, Archewell Productions, makes programmes for Netflix, under a deal thought to be worth millions of dollars.\n\nIn April 2024, Archewell said two new series were in production, one celebrating \"the joys of cooking & gardening, entertaining, and friendship\", and another exploring the world of professional polo.\n\nThe couple previously featured in the Harry and Meghan documentary series, where they talked about life in the Royal Family, and The Heart of Invictus series, which discussed the duke's emotional \"unravelling\" after military service in Afghanistan.\n\nArchewell also made podcasts for Spotify under a contract thought to be worth $25m (£19.7m).
