        "text": "Well.\n\nWell, well, well, well, well.\n\nI don‚Äôt know about you, but this movie just KILLED me.\n\nThailand presents a gem of a movie in this teen romance about Nam, a girl whose crush on the school‚Äôs most popular boy, Shone, drive her to improve herself in terms of looks, academics and social life to the detriment of her relationship with her closest friends.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nThis beautiful Thai movie manages to speak to every single person in the world who‚Äôs ever had a crush on anybody, whether they were popular or not. Nam‚Äôs awkward looks and demeanor are easily relatable and is portrayed very charmingly and beautifully by breakthrough actress Baifern Pimchanok.\n\nNam‚Äôs swan story provides inspiration to many and fuel for mockery for some people, whose pessimism lead them to comment, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wrong that she changed herself all for a guy.‚Äù To them I say this: Nam‚Äôs motivation may have been a guy, but she used it instead to create beauty for herself and, when she grew up, for other people as well. She never let her disappointments lead her down a darker path, which is one of the things that is very admirable about her character.\n\nThe other half of this beautiful teen romance is courtesy of Mario Maurer, the Thai-German young actor who shot to international fame (and by international I mean now Philippine-famous) with this movie. He plays P‚ÄôShone, the older, handsome, popular student who captures Nam‚Äôs eye and her heart. The movie begins with an older version of Shone at his photography exhibit where he is found seemingly to be the father to a lovely baby boy. We flash back to his school days when girls, including our heroine Nam, obsess and chase after him.\n\n(Just an aside, one interesting parallel to the Nam-Shone romance is that of Nam‚Äôs English teacher In, who has a huge crush on the hunky PE teacher. She was a brilliant addition to the film.)\n\nSo.\n\nIs Nam successful in catching P‚ÄôShone‚Äôs attention? You‚Äôll have to watch the movie. It‚Äôs one of those things that one has to experience in order to fully appreciate. The beauty of the story lies in its transcendence of all cultures, for what person hasn‚Äôt felt her heart flutter whenever her crush walks by? What person hasn‚Äôt felt giddy when the crush says her name? Because all of us have gone through this experience at one point in our lives or another, we sympathize with Nam and find ourselves cheering for her every single step of the way. And in the end, when we see if she makes up with her friends and whether or not her hard work pays off, you can‚Äôt help but say ‚ÄúAwwwww.‚Äù\n\nTruth be told, you‚Äôll be doing a lot more than say ‚ÄúAww‚Äù at the end. I‚Äôve been holding back in this post. My feelings for this movie are downplayed by this rather sedate praise-slash-review. The sole reason for this is that if I let my feelings run amok and take over this entry, all I‚Äôd be able to say is:\n\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH! I LOVE THIS MOVIE!\n\nCare to join me? Watch this movie. NOW. And fall in love with the story of Nam, the girl who loved.\n\n‚Äî\n\nI googled the name of the actress who played Nam, and I just copy-pasted what I found. The translation in the movie spelled it as Pimchanok Luevisedpibool, but I‚Äôm not a hundred percent sure it‚Äôs correct. If what I wrote was incorrect, please leave a comment so that I can make the necessary changes. Thanks!\n\n(minor spoilers)\n\nMaking the online waves (at least here in the Philippines) is Thailand‚Äôs equivalent of our very own Gerald Anderson: Mario Maurer. Filipinos first heard of this young man through his 2010 movie, First Love (A Little Thing Called Love), a review of which I‚Äôll post later on.\n\nIn this movie set in the 80‚Äôs, Maurer plays a teen named Singha who picks on Mituna, one of his classmates who recently transfers in. For some reason, which we all know to be love, he picks on her relentlessly even though he‚Äôs not really the bad guy in school. He comes to his senses when another new student whom he befriends talk to him about Mituna. Well, that and after she nearly beats him to a pulp for making fun of her in public.\n\nThe two teens‚Äô romantic feelings for each other blossom eventually but not without problems, which make up the meat of the story so I won‚Äôt go there anymore.\n\nWow.\n\nI literally have nothing to say. Or maybe I do, but I just haven‚Äôt found the words yet.\n\nWhat I CAN say right now is that it was disappointing for a movie called ‚ÄúFriendship,‚Äù they didn‚Äôt really give much attention to the relationship between Singha and his new friend, Lam. If they had meant it to be a romantic movie, they should have just left out Lam because his character was WASTED there. The Lam subplot felt out of place in the romance between Singha and Mituna, which was obviously the focus of the movie. I was waiting for the guys to do something big for Lam to show how much his friendship meant to them but there was nothing. at. all. And the friendship book? What happened to it? Singha placed such a big importance on it, but it was also relegated to the sidelines to make way for the romance. *sigh*\n\nAnyway, I didn‚Äôt exactly understand the ending, about what happened to one of the characters and whether or not it had something to do with whatever sickness this character contracted.\n\nOh well.\n\nIt was still a pretty decent and enjoyable movie. üôÇ\n\n‚Äî-\n\nIf you‚Äôre Filipino, you‚Äôll get this next part:\n\nMario Maurer ‚Äì Gerald Anderson / Mituna ‚Äì Shaina Magdayao.\n\nAminin. haha"
