        "text": "High school sweethearts meet years after the accident that tore them apart.\n\nAs a series, First Love isn’t that long—it clocks in at a grand total of nine episodes, but that’s all it needs to be. I kind of wished it was longer because by the end I was attached to these characters, but I can see why they chose to end it where it’s at.\n\nIt opens in the nineties, when a girl, Yae, goes to high school in her native Hokkaido. She’s caught the eye of every boy in the school and constantly gets asked out, but bad boy Harumichi is the one to end up nabbing her. The show transitions between the past and the present.\n\nFirst, we learn that Yae grows up to be a cab driver in what I presume is Tokyo. She has a son and is divorced, but shows no recollection about her relationship with Harumichi. He’s become a night guard with a complicated relationship with his fiancé, who, as the show goes on, we learn was his therapist after serving in the air force.\n\nThe two of them live completely separates lives, but the narratives set in the past show how close they were. They were thick as thieves in their relationship and everyone knew it, and Yae even learned sign language to communicate with Harumichi’s deaf sister.\n\nTheir paths cross again in the present day when Yae’s son comes to the building Harumichi works in. He lets her son sneak in to see his favorite performance artist, and they become closer despite the age gap. Her son has a crush on the performance artist, making that an entirely different subplot throughout the show.\n\nWhen Harumichi sees Yae driving her car one day, his thoughts become geared towards her yet again—as his sister points out, his passcode is still her birthday after all of these years.\n\nThe flashback scenes further show their relationship, and what ended up causing it to end.\n\nHarumichi joins the air force because Yae once said it would be cool for a guy to be in it, and Yae goes off to college. She had a knack for English when she was in high school, as pointed out by one of her teachers, and her dream is to become a flight attendant.\n\nWhen in college, she starts to pave out a life for herself independent of Harumichi, despite telling him everything through their letters and calls, but one day she ends up receiving an acceptance to study abroad.\n\nShe doesn’t tell Harumichi about that, but when he comes to visit and one of her friends leaks the info to him, he becomes upset, leading to a big argument. Harumichi turns around after leaving her behind, calling her on the phone, but realizes something terrible happens.\n\nHe runs back to where he left her, and discovers she has been hit by the car. This leaves her with amnesia, and when she returns home, her mother intercepts his letters to her in hopes she would forget who Harumichi was. It works and Yae ends up pregnant and engaged to her doctor, which breaks Harumichi’s heart when he finds out.\n\nAt the same time, this is tragically sad because we can see that Yae was such a bright girl with a great future ahead of her, but she ends up having to leave everything behind because of the accident.\n\nThat relationship crashes and burns though, as Yae’s new husband’s family can’t accept the fact she grew up from a poorer background and he ends up cheating on her.\n\nShe takes her son to her mother’s home, but is forced to give him up because of her financial situation, creating the visitation rules where he can only see her once a week. In the present moment, Yae and Harumichi continue to meet again and seem to continue right where they left off, even though he’s engaged and she can’t remember anything about the shared past they had.\n\nThey end up falling in love, and, in the final episode when he leaves everything behind to go to Iceland, she remembers everything and follows him, becoming a flight attendant and achieving that dream that was abandoned when she had the accident."
