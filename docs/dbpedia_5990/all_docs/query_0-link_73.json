        "text": "KHON KAEN, Thailand  The red carpet of the Cannes Film Festival is a world apart from the villages of rural Thailand, but Apichatpong Weerasethakul glides effortlessly between the two.\n\nMr. Apichatpong stunned the movie world in May by winning the coveted Palme d’Or at Cannes for his latest film, “Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives.”\n\nHe will take the picture to the New York Film Festival, which begins Sept. 24, but his first stop on a global tour to promote the film was here in his hometown, Khon Kaen, a small city in Thailand’s rice-growing and poor northeastern plateau.\n\n“Uncle Boonmee,” an unconventional, impressionistic film about a dying man and his encounters with ghosts, was filmed in the jungles and farmland of northeastern Thailand using amateur actors on a budget of less than $700,000.\n\nMr. Apichatpong (pronounced aa-pee-chat-pohng), who has won two other awards at Cannes for previous films, is somewhat polarizing as a filmmaker. He has a small but loyal international base of fans who see his work as an innovative counterpoint to what they condemn as Hollywood standardization.\n\n“He’s one of the very few directors who can make films that speak to the senses,” said Anocha Suwichakornpong, an award-winning Thai director who is part of a new wave of independent filmmakers here. “If I go in a cinema and watch his films, it doesn’t matter what the film is about. It’s a sensory experience.”\n\nThe director Tim Burton, the head of the jury that awarded the Palme d’Or to “Uncle Boonmee,” called the film a “beautiful, strange dream.”\n\nOthers simply found it strange. Or confusing. The French newspaper Le Figaro described it as “impenetrable and slow” and skewered some of its more peculiar scenes: in one, Uncle Boonmee’s son returns from the dead and joins him at the dinner table as a monkey with glowing red eyes; in another, a princess appears to copulate with a fish.\n\nHe is also a polarizing figure in Thailand, although not as much for his films, which until recently were barely known among the general public, as for his championing of antigovernment protesters and his biting critique of the political establishment.\n\n“You’d better stay silent because when you talk it shows your stupidity,” said one typical posting of about 550 in July on manager.co.th, the Web site of a Thai-language newspaper that was staunchly against the most recent round of antigovernment protests.\n\nA popular online message board, Pantip.com, had roughly 100 comments about Mr. Apichatpong, half of which were critical.\n\n“We don’t consider you Thai anymore,” someone with the screen name Noom Sua Ball wrote. “We regret so much that we once admired you.”\n\nA supporter writing on the same site defended Mr. Apichatpong: “I thought everyone who worked in the entertainment industry was a slave to the government  I’m glad we have such an independent director who deviates from the dominant thinking.”\n\nThe unrest in Thailand is complex, but one of its main sources has been a struggle for political power between Mr. Apichatpong’s childhood region and a royalist, well-entrenched elite in Bangkok.\n\n“Uncle Boonmee” does not come across as a political film. Yet Mr. Apichatpong’s empathy for northeastern Thais, who have traditionally been manual laborers and farmers, shines through. The film’s characters disparage big-city life and speak a dialect close to the Lao language, which is not spoken by people born and raised in Bangkok. To the outside world “Uncle Boonmee” is a Thai film, but viewers in Bangkok relied on Thai subtitles to understand the northeastern vernacular.\n\nThe Bangkok establishment has for decades viewed people from the northeast, or Isaan as the region is known, as uncouth but generally hard-working. Mr. Apichatpong, who grew up next to the hospital in Khon Kaen where his parents worked as doctors, said he shot the film in the northeast because he was trying to recapture the faces and rugged lifestyles of the people he remembered meeting during his youth.\n\nIn an interview on the campus of the university here, where Mr. Apichatpong studied architecture (a profession he abandoned for filmmaking), he said his ethnic roots were Chinese, and that both of his parents had graduated from elite universities in Bangkok before moving to the northeast. Despite this pedigree, Mr. Apichatpong said he remembered a keen sense of inferiority when he traveled to Bangkok.\n\nHis victory at Cannes came so soon after a crackdown in Bangkok on antigovernment protesters, many of them from the northeast, that it seemed to become part of the country’s political narrative. On May 19 the Thai military swept protesters out from their entrenched positions in central Bangkok. The crackdown was the climax of two months of tensions and fighting in Bangkok that left about 90 people dead and thousands injured, a vast majority of them protesters.\n\nMr. Apichatpong left this tumult for the French Riviera, barely managing to obtain his visa from European consular officials, who were closing their offices because of the spreading violence. On May 23, as defeated and humiliated protesters returned to their villages, “Uncle Boonmee” won the Palme d’Or.\n\nMr. Apichatpong described the protests as an “uprising of the poor.” The perception of Thailand as a gentle, harmonious society is wrong, he said: “Thailand is violent and full of inequality.”\n\nThese kinds of statements infuriate monarchists in Thailand, who say the protests had nothing to do with income inequality and were orchestrated by Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire tycoon removed as prime minister by the military in 2006.\n\nMr. Apichatpong’s critics have used the anonymity of the Internet to suggest that he would be better off dead, a statement no one takes lightly in Thailand these days, after several high-profile murders and assassination attempts on political figures.\n\nAll of this bitterness clearly troubles Mr. Apichatpong, who is soft-spoken even when outspoken. He said he was worried about the power of the military in Thailand, the government’s censorship campaigns after the May crackdown and the “frustration and anger” of young people in the countryside who lack opportunities."
