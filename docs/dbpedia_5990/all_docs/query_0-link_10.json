        "text": "Ped (Jirayu La-ongmanee) is a shy boy who never listened to music until would-be childhood crush Ern (Nattasha Nualjam) introduced him to the world of Pop and Rock. But she left for Bangkok soon after, and it's six years later, in their final school year, before she's reintroduced to Ped and his brash best friend Koong (Pachara Chirathivat). Koong convinces Ped, along with schoolmate Ex (Thawat Pornrattanaprasert), to form a band, partly to be cool and attract girls, partly so Koong can try to one-up his popular twin brother Kay. Their musical talents aren't great, but that doesn't stop them from trying. However, when Ern decides to lend them her outstanding guitar skills, Ped and Koong's shared attraction to her puts a strain on the band's survival, as well as their friendship.\n\nThe story takes place at the College of Music, Mahidol University over one year and covers the three seasons that Bangkok typically experiences - summer, winter and monsoon. It chronicles the life of a young high school student, Pom, and his impulsive decision to attend a music school, unknown to his parents, because of a girl he has secretly liked for three years, Dao. At the music school, he befriends Aom, who eventually becomes his best friend at the academy. As a talented rock drummer he aids a wise Japanese instructor, Jitaro in research. He also forms a rock band with two friends, Ched and Chat. However, in order to become closer to the talented violinist Dao, he joins the orchestra and is assigned by the feisty conductor, Rosie, to play timpani. Eventually, as time schedule collides, he is forced to choose between playing in a rock band or the orchestra, and is also forced to choose between his crush on Dao, or his best friend, Aom.\n\nSua (Ter - Chantavit Dhnasevi) and Jib (Ice - Preechaya Pongthananikorn) are like any other couple in the world, with one exception: for the past 5 years they have kept their relationship secret since the bank where they work has a strict \"No Fraternization\" policy. It's no big deal until they decide to get married. The only problem: Which one of these two Type-A overachievers will put marriage before career and resign? With neither willing to take the leap of faith, they both turn incident into opportunity when an ATM glitch in Chonburi province cashes out over $130,000 baht. The terms are simple: whoever can recover the money first stays at the job. The couple turns into no-holds-barred competitors. Who will literally \"go big\" in their career or \"go home\" in this romantic comedy about what two people will or won't do for each other in the name of love? It's the age-old battle of the sexes, but this time, how can victory be easily declared in a war where there are no more traditional \"rules of engagement\"?\n\nSeven Something is a special love movie made to celebrate the glorious film company, GTH's 7th anniversary. Starring Thailand's top stars and Nichkhun, the Asian idol from 2PM, the movie tells various love stories from three generations at different ages: 14, 21 and 42. In the first part, the relationship of a teenage couple is altered by the power of social networking. In the second part, an acting couple's relationship is put to test as fame takes its toll. In the last episode, a 42 year old reporter encounters a tragic loss in her life; when she meets a young marathon runner, her life is changed forever.\n\nMat a mother forced to raise her son Tan on her own after being widowed early in her marriage. In this Mat gets help from Watt, who falls in love with her for long time. Tan is expected to be like his dad but instead wants to escape what he regards as the narrow confines of his mother's world. His dreams look like coming true when he meets June, a free spirit who knows what she wants from life. The young woman quickly makes up for what Tan feels he's missing and in the process helps him reconnect with his mother.\n\n4BIA is a Horror Anthology. The first segment, \"Happiness\" is about a lonely girl who corresponded with a stranger over hand phone text messaging and soon discovered something strange about this new stranger that she is attracted to. \"Tit For Tat\" spun a tale of black magic and vengeance for a school kid that had been bullied by a school gang. \"In The Middle\" - a group of friends faced one of their worst camping trip after water kayaking accident. The final segment \"Last Fright\" takes horror to new heights with a psychological thriller that involves a stewardess flying solo in a cabin with a dead body."
