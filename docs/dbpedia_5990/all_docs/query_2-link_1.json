Edwards\n\nHenry Kittredge\n\nLucas Jarach\n\nNadine de Barros\n\nStarringDiane Kruger\n\nHero Fiennes Tiffin\n\nSydney Park\n\nJeffrey DonovanMusic byGeorge Kallis\n\nProduction\n\ncompany\n\nDistributed byVertical Entertainment\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n96 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglish\n\nFirst Love is a 2022 American romance film written and directed by A. J. Edwards and starring Diane Kruger, Hero Fiennes Tiffin, Sydney Park and Jeffrey Donovan.\n\nThe story follows how Jim and Ann meet, lose contact and their lives eventually join.\n\nThe film was released on June 17, 2022 in the United States.\n\nDue to the great economic recession starting in 2008, senior high school student Jim Albright's father Greg loses his bank job. Jim lets him know he's going to try to apply to colleges where he might be able to get at least part of a ride for track.\n\nDiscovering he has only 20 minutes to write a paper for a class, Jim holes himself into the school library to finish it. There, as he's seeking a book, he seeks fellow senior Ann on the other side of the bookcase and is captivated. Jim later watches her rehearsing a theatrical play in the auditorium.\n\nTaking Ann out of her Spanish class with a false note from a school administrator, Jim confesses he faked the summons so as to talk to her alone. Shy, and not sharing any classes with Ann, he explains he'd just wanted to talk to her alone briefly. Jim compliments her on her eyes.\n\nAfter school, Ann asks Jim for a ride. Rather than take her right home, he takes her to a pretty spot overlooking the ocean and they hang out. As she arrives home later than normal, Ann's mom asks her why. When Ann tells her he's someone new, she assumes she's dating around and approves.\n\nGreg meets with an employment recruiter across town, while Kay deals with her Aunt Irene's carer challenges. She doesn't keep carers for long, so Kay suggests a home, which goes over badly. Irene reminds her that she practically raised her as her own as her sister essentially abandoned her, then throws her out.\n\nThat night Kay's brother, after bragging about how busy he and his wife are, openly criticizes Greg. A blue-collar worker, he implies that the white-collar, former banker's layoff was deserved.\n\nAt Ann's birthday party, when playing a dare game, Jim is one of three people tasked to kiss her so she can rate them. Ann gives him a ten. Chatting with her friends at school later, they all say he's weird but she admits she likes him.\n\nJim and Ann's relationship progresses...he has her over for dinner with his parents. While they are out in the afternoon with friends and colleagues on their 21st anniversary, the young couple is intimate. Afterwards Jim declares his love.\n\nOver dinner with her mom, Ann's mom suggests the connection with Jim ought to be fleeting, as she ought to be a free agent in college. This influences her next interaction with him. Ann tells him she's going to college in NYC, while Jim's staying in California. He suggests they play things by ear, but she suggests they 'keep it light'.\n\nJim and Ann stop spending time together, and she becomes distant. Time passes, they graduate and his grandmother passes. Before Jim heads to UCLA, he's told his parents are downsizing as Greg still is unemployed and they can't get another bank extension. When he asks his dad for advice on Ann, he says if it is meant to be it will be.\n\nTwo years later, Jim visits his parents' apartment. Greg does odd jobs here and there to help with their expenses. Kay confides in him that they are both feeling low and cries on his shoulder.\n\nAnn sends Jim a voicemail, expressing interest in meeting up. When they do, they both confirm the other is free, learn that neither has another meaningful relationship so are together intimately again. Afterwards, Ann confesses she loves Jim, has always loved him and asks what next.\n\nAfter Jim has a minor health care scare, he gets Ann an engagement ring. When Kay finds it, she tries to dissuade him unsuccessfully. Jim approaches Ann's mom, telling of his intention to propose at her graduation. Although she's skeptical, she sees he's ernest. Meanwhile, Greg successfully interviews for a Phoenix company, just he's contemplating moving them abroad.\n\nThe film ends with Jim and Ann's simple wedding and reception, with Greg urging them to hold on to their most important moments.\n\nHero Fiennes Tiffin as Jim\n\nSydney Park as Ann\n\nDiane Kruger as Kay Albright\n\nJeffrey Donovan as Greg Albright\n\nBlake Weise as Nick\n\nDiane Venora as Aunt Irene\n\nNikolai Tsankov as Father Alex\n\nHarrison Cone as Tol\n\nElena Heuz√© as Kim\n\nChris Galust as Nick Albright\n\nBruce Wexler as Vance Hughes\n\nKiara T.
