        "text": "Thai actor and model (born 1988)\n\nMario Maurer (Thai: มาริโอ้ เมาเร่อ, Thai: [māːrīʔôː māw.rɤ̂ː]; German: [ˈmaːʁio ˈmaʊ̯ʁɐ]) is a Thai actor and model. He was in the 2007 film Love of Siam and the 2010 sleeper hit Crazy Little Thing Called Love. He was also in Thailand's highest grossing film of all time, Pee Mak alongside Davika Hoorne. He was part of a group called 4+1 Channel 3 Superstar with actors Nadech Kugimiya, Prin Suparat, Pakorn Chatborirak and Phupoom Pongpanu.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nMaurer was born to a German father and a Thai Chinese mother.[2] He has an older brother named Marco, who is a Thai rapper.[3][4] Maurer graduated from Saint Dominic School and earned his bachelor's degree from the Faculty of Law, Ramkhamhaeng University.[5][6] In 2017, he received his master's degree in Political Communication from Krirk University.[7]\n\nActor and model\n\n[edit]\n\nAt 16 years old, Maurer was approached at Siam Square to try out modeling.[8] From then on, he started doing photo shoots, commercials and music videos. In 2007, he made his feature film debut in a leading role in Love of Siam, written and directed by Chukiat Sakweerakul.[9] The role \"Tong\" was his first big break; it brought him many accolades and instant fame far beyond Thailand's borders. Commenting on his newfound fame, Maurer said, \"I didn't want to do it, acting wasn't on my to-do list.\" He decided to do the movie because he trusted director Chukiat and the movie would give him many opportunities and money to help his family.[10]\n\nHe won the Best Actor award in the Starpics Thai Films Awards, and was also nominated in the Bangkok Critics Assembly and Star Entertainment Awards.[11]\n\nDirector Bhandit Rittakol had approached Maurer for Boonchu 9, but he was tied up with other projects.[12] He was cast in the 2008 Chatchai Naksuriya film Friendship. The film is set around 1983. Maurer starred opposite Apinya Sakuljaroensuk,[13] as a 12th grade student. That same year, he appeared in a segment of the four-story anthology 4 Romance, (segment \"Joob\" or Kiss) directed by Rashane Limtrakul.[14] Maurer's projects after 2008 included a comedy-horror film written and directed by Yuthlert Sippapak, and the 2009 film Rahtree Reborn, in which he starred opposite Chermarn Boonyasak.[15]\n\nMaurer gained popularity after he starred in the 2010 film First Love and Thailand's highest grossing film of all time, Pee Mak.\n\nOther work\n\n[edit]\n\nMaurer teamed up with his older brother Marco in the hip hop duo \"PsyCho & Lil'Mario\". They released their debut PsyCho & Lil'Mario: Dem Crazy Boyz on 31 October 2007.[16] Maurer worked as a hypeman in this album. He would later on describe it as \"just for fun. I know myself – I'm not a singer. That's not my dream.\"[10]\n\nMaurer participated in endorsements for the first time for Exit Rollon and other popular brands such as The Pizza Company, Sugus, and Foremost. He was also the presenter for Honda Jazz, and was in the cloud 9 commercial by Unilever company.[17] He also did endorsements for Pepsi, Dutchmill, and Sony Ericsson. In July 2011, he signed an endorsement contract for the Philippine clothing brand Penshoppe, following the unexpected popularity from his film Crazy Little Thing Called Love shown on the ABS-CBN network.[18] He also signed a movie contract with Star Cinema, a Philippine film production company. He was paired with Filipina film and television actress Erich Gonzales in the film released in 2012, Suddenly It's Magic.[19] On 28 October 2011, Maurer had a press and fan conference at the Philippine International Convention Center with thousands of fans in attendance, as a part of his official launch as a Penshoppe endorser.[20] On 29 October, he hit the runway at the Philippine Fashion Week held at the SMX Convention Center.[21][22] On 3 August 2013, Maurer returned to the Philippines to promote his movie Pee Mak and had a fan conference at two venues, SM North EDSA and SM Mall of Asia the following day with Baifern Pimchanok,[23] as part of Pimchanok's official launch as Penshoppe endorser.[24] Thousands of fans were in attendance in continuing support for both stars and their 2010 hit movie First Love.\n\nMaurer person can be revived up to hours after falling the word ice into the water of the year, Suddenly It's Magic and Kissed by the Rain figure ice skating biggest project Taiwanese Drama Frozen Heart co-starring Ivy Shao Yu-wei Samuel Gu and Aggie Hsieh in Disney + Hotstar and SETTV 2025\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMaurer's personal interests include skateboarding, hip hop, and driving cars. He is also a naturist. Although he is of German descent, he doesn't speak German. He understands basic words and phrases in Mandarin as he studied the language while he was in high school.[25][26] His father Roland Maurer died of a diabetes-related heart attack on 27 June 2011.[27] He has a very close relationship with his brother Marco, a hip-hop artist and actor.[28][29]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes With 2007 The Love of Siam Tong Main role Witwisit Hiranyawongkul 2008 Friendship Singha Apinya Sakuljaroensuk 4 Romance Mee / Beaver Apissara Tudti 2009 Rahtree Reborn Rung Laila Boonyasak Rahtree Revenge 2010 Saranae Siblor Ake Araya A.Hargate A Little Thing Called Love Shone Pimchanok Luevisadpaibul Eternity Young buddhist monk Cameo appearance None The Dog Art Main role Saranae Hen Phi Doh Patcharapa Chaichua 2011 The Outrage Monk None Bangkok Assassins Na Jarinya Sirimongkolsakul 2012 Friends Never Die Gun Monchanok Saengchaipiangpen Rak Sud Teen Aek Amena Gul Love On That Day Martin Chinese film Ye Qing Jan Dara: The Beginning Jan Dara Main role None Thailand (Long Distance Relationship) Himself Short film cameo Suddenly It's Magic Marcus Hanson Philippine film Erich Gonzales 2013 Pee Mak Mak Main role Davika Hoorne Jan Dara: The Finale Jan Dara None 2015 Prisana Mario Short film Davika Hoorne 2016 Take Me Home Tan Main role Wannarot Sonthichai 2017 Saranae Love You Himself Seo Ji-yeon 2019 Khun Phaen Begins Keaw None 2020 Low Season Phut Ploypailin Thangprabhaporn 2021 77 Heartwarmings Marvel Chinese film None 2022 Al Love You Bobby Main role Pimchanok Luevisadpaibul Six Characters Khamron Singha None 2023 Khun Phan 3 Suea Mahesuan TBA Rider Tien Sarocha Chankimha\n\nTelevision series\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role With Network 2010 Tai Fah Tawan Diew Minho Varitthisa Limthammahisorn Modernine TV 2011 Plerng Torranong Plerngrit \"Plerng\" Natapohn Tameeruks Channel 3 2012 Rak Kerd Nai Talad Sode Tong Rasri Balenciaga Chirathiwat 2013 Madam Dun Neks Laila Boonyasak 2014 Roy Ruk Hak Liam Tawan Onizuka Takeshi (Tawan) Natapohn Tameeruks Roy Fun Tawan Duerd 2015 Song Huajai Nee Puea Tur Tharatorn / Warong Chalida Vijitvongthong 2017 Bunlang Dok Mai Anawin Jarinporn Joonkiat Game of Thrones Season 7 Jon Snow (Voice only, Thai dub) None HBO Asia Buang Banjathorn Laoperng Davika Hoorne Channel 3 2019 Thong Ake Mor Yah Tah Chaloang Thong Ake Kimberley Anne Woltemas 2022 Keu Ter (Bad Romeo) Kaokla Urassaya Sperbund 2023 Mor Luang Thong-on Kimberley Anne Woltemas 2024 Kissed by the Rain \"Mai\" Mawin Natapohn Tameeruks 2025 Frozen Heart Tong Warong Ivy Shao SETTV TBA Bad Dog Kaoaka Supassara Thanachat Channel 3\n\nOst.\n\n[edit]\n\nMovies: Pee Mak (พี่มาก..พระโขนง)\n\nSongs: (ขอมือเธอหน่อย(cover version) ร้องร่วมกับ ณัฏฐพงษ์ ชาติพงศ์, พงศธร จงวิลาส, อัฒรุต คงราศรี และ กันตพัฒน์ สีดา) On Air YouTube:GTHchannel\n\nDramas: Bunlang Dok Mai (บัลลังก์ดอกไม้)\n\nSongs: (กลัวจะเผลอรักเธอไปสักวัน ร้องร่วมกับ จรินทร์พร จุนเกียรติ) On Air YouTube:Ch3Thailand Music\n\nSongs: (ขอบคุณ (Acoustic Version)) On Air YouTube:Ch3Thailand Music\n\nDramas: Bad Romeo (คือเธอ)\n\nSongs: Touch Touch - (ศดานันท์ บาเล็นซิเอก้า (Feat.))
