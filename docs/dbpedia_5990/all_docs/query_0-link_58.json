Thai cinema is back!\n\nBy Sarisa Pokawattana\n\n| Nov 06, 2023\n\nAfter suffering from the pandemic, the Thai entertainment industry is finally finding its footing at the tail end of 2023. This month’s offerings include local blockbusters, internationally acclaimed indie darlings, and classic comebacks.

Pae barely knew the “friend” at all.\n\nRelease date: Oct 26\n\nPlatform: Thailand cinemas\n\nLove Live Love!\n\nPhoto: Long Live Love! / imdb\n\nA tale as old as time.
