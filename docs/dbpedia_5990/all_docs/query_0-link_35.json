        "text": "Share with:\n\nBy Laura Saxton\n\nDirected by Sranya Noithai\n\nShe: Their Love Story is a film inspired by true stories of Thai women. Writer and director Sranya Noithai displays two unrelated yet similarly diverse love stories that provoke the idea of equality through love and togetherness. Connecting an array of individuals in unexpected situations the film highlights the aphorism: you can’t help who you fall in love with, and attempts to follow in the footsteps of Yes or No: So, I love You, the successful 2010 Thai lesbian romance.\n\nWhen June (Ann Siriwan Baker), a young freelance photographer, is commissioned to create the imagery for Bua’s (Penpak Sirikul) resort brochure, an unexpected relationship blossoms as the pair share a connection they both cannot dismiss. The audience is already aware that Bua considered leaving her husband before she met June. When she ends her long-term marriage without explanation, questions are asked about the truth behind the divorce, which could change the dynamic of their newly found love.\n\nParallel to this story comes an unconnected tale of unpredicted union as feminine columnist, Da (Apassaporn Sangthong), reluctantly agrees to write a story on the love lives of lesbians in Thailand. She nonchalantly approaches her lesbian tomboy next-door neighbour, Be (Kitchya Kaesuwan), in search for answers but doesn’t seem to relate, acting ignorantly close-minded towards her. As they open up to each other they form a fun, light-hearted bond that makes Da question her previous lifestyle choices. One is left to wonder whether Da will accept the truth and follow her heart or there are simply too many obstacles to overcome.\n\nShe: Their Love Story is sensitive and calmingly lyrical as it displays two unassuming love stories. Although the first half follows a typical love story structure and is somewhat melodramatic, Sarunya Noithai adds depth as things turn for the worst and the foundations of both relationships are questioned. Although the film has received mixed reviews for its overdramatic nature, it does provide room for thought as it allows for lesbian relationships to be without question and rejects conformity."
