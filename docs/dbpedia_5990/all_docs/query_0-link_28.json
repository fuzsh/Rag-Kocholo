I remember watching this for the first time and I was crying like shit at the last scenes. Can't figure out why back then but now I know why. Since then, this became my favorite to the point that I've memorized all the ost in thai and I know all the background songs. Rewatching it now, for maybe like 4th time, still gives me chills and feelings despite the negative things I now noticed about it. I really love this film that even tho I noticed weird things, I'd still rate this high and will continue to love this.\n\nBack then, I love Pie so much that I want her to be my girlfriend. Now? Damn, I still feel the same.\n\nSo here's the thing. This is like, objectively (?) bad as in: weird pace, too long, it looks very basic, it falls into dramatics for no reason, it's filled with clichés and there's also some jokes that did not age well (and probably were terrible back then, too)\n\nIt's also amazing: it's sweet to the point of rotting your teeth (i couldn't stop smiling), the struggles of both characters feels super real to me, and their love story is incredibly endearing. Even though the movie is ridiculously long (considering what it's about), most of it it's tender and cute bonding moments between the two protagonists: does it move the plot forward? no, but damn I enjoyed them\n\nThis remains groundbreaking,…"
