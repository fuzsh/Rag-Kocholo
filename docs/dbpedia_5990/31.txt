Can you believe ten years have passed since the kilig-filled Thai movie “A Little Thing Called Love” came out?

Singer-actress Baifern, who played Mario Maurer’s leading lady in the romantic comedy film, marked the occasion by sharing a fan-made poster on Instagram. She also wrote a heartfelt message for her fans who have been supporting her through the years.

“Thank you for all the fans who have always been supporting me,” Baifern wrote.

“It’s been 10 years since 'Little thing called Love' was released and I promise to keep bringing in more of my work for you to enjoy," she added.

“A Little Thing Called Love” is a Thai coming-of-age romantic comedy that follows a high school girl named Nam (Baifern) who tries to do all she can to impress her crush, Shone (Mario Maurer).

With some help from her friends, Nam transforms herself physically — from her teeth, skin and glasses to her popularity at school — but she later finds other circumstances that hinder her chances with Shone.

Since its release in 2010, the film has taken not only Thailand but also the international audience on a emotional rollercoaster with its sweet and relatable story about young love.
