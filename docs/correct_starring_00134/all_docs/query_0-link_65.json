        "text": "Kevin Smith stopped by The Paramount Theatre in Austin Monday night to present the third installment of Clerks, the movie that kicked off his career. Austin was his 46th city of the 52 cities of what he has called The Convenience Tour. It was a treat to see Smith back on The Paramount stage coining the event as \"You are supposed to be here today!\" He was here for the premiere of Clerks II 16 years ago.\n\nSmith introduced the film talking about how much he loved movies growing up. He described the ending of The Best Whorehouse In Texas where Burt stops Dolly in the middle of singing I Will Always Love You and tells her that they are going to be together. Burt picks her up and carries her to his truck. Smith said that movies really deceived him as a kid because he thought everything had a happy ending. \"Sheriff Ed and Mona probably looked at each other 10 months down the road and said 'what are we doing' and called it quits. But we don't see that story,\" Smith said. He wanted to always have happy endings so he decided to make movies.\n\nKevin Smith lays it on thick in Clerks III with all heart and humor. It's a nice wrap up of the trilogy and a very different experience than what you will probably expect. Dante and Randal are back along with their stoner hangouts, Jay and Silent Bob. Elias (Trevor Fehrman) is back from Clerks II in a whole new way.\n\nIn Clerks III, Dante and Randal are back working at the Quick Stop Groceries Convenience Store in New Jersey. Elias stops by with his own \"Silent Bob\" and is still religious after all these years. Randal is still as sarcastic as ever, but when he has a heart attack and survives, everything comes into focus and he decides to make a movie about working in a convenience store for 3 decades instead of wasting anymore time watching movies. He gathers his cast and crew and gets Dante to be his producer to find the funding for the film. He also hires Silent Bob to shoot the whole thing in black and white. Sound familiar? Well, there's twists and turns along the way.\n\nKevin Smith had a Q&A that was as long as the movie itself, which had a running time of an hour and 40 minutes. They coined it as \"let him use his mouth on you\" at the post-show Q&A. Smith talked about his career and how movies like Richard Linklater's Slacker and Robert Rodriguez's El Mariachi inspired him because they both made those movies on a shoestring budget. He knew he could do it as well. And a man right here in Austin helped get his start. Independent film producer John Pierson, who is married to SXSW's Janet Pierson, use to discover and sell movies to major film distributors and this is just what he did for Smith. Pierson only wanted him to change one thing, the ending of the movie. Well, let's just say Kevin Smith brought back that original ending and put it in Clerks III. It comes full circle for him after 3 decades and being a seasoned member of the Hollywood film industry.\n\nSmith went on and talked about his father, who worked overnights and how he started checking him out of school early to go see afternoon movies. His dad took him to see Raging Bull and he saw his dad cry in the movie. \"I thought to myself, if this piece of art can make my dad cry who I have never seen cry, then why can't I make movies to get people to be emotional,\" Smith said. Well, that's exactly what he did and the rest is history.\n\nThe film was released in September even though Kevin will still be on the Convenience Tour hitting other cities through December. Check out the film if you love the other ones. It's a nice follow up to the second film.\n\nFor more info of other cities that Kevin Smith will be attending, go to\n\nFor more information about The Paramount Theatre,"
