        "text": "Kevin Smith is an American screenwriter, actor, film producer, and director. He came to prominence with the low-budget comedy Clerks (1994), in which he appeared as the character Silent Bob. His first several films were mostly set in his home state of New Jersey, and while not strictly sequential, they frequently feature crossover plot elements, character references, and a shared canon described by fans as the \"View Askewniverse\"—named after his production company View Askew Productions, which he co-founded with Scott Mosier.[1]\n\nSmith also directed and produced films such as the buddy cop action comedy Cop Out, as well as the thriller Red State. Outside of film, Smith has worked in various capacities on several television series.\n\nSmith also participates in Q&A sessions that have routinely been filmed for DVD release, beginning with An Evening with Kevin Smith.\n\nFilm[edit]\n\nYear Title Credited as Notes Director Writer Editor 1994 Clerks Yes Yes Yes Also producer 1995 Mallrats Yes Yes No 1997 Chasing Amy Yes Yes Yes 1999 Dogma Yes Yes Yes Also puppeteer as Kevin P.
