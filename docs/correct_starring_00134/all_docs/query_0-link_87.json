        "text": "Every fan of sci-fi remembers where they were when they first saw Clerks. I was in high school, and I’d been left home alone (presumably while my parents went to a UT Vols football game). I rented a stack of movies from Hollywood Video, and one of them was Clerks. There’s a moment in the movie that stuck with me, and you already know what I’m talking about if you’ve also spent your entire life getting swept up in adventures set in far away lands/universes/realities. I’m talking about the scene wherein the titular clerk Dante (Brian O’Halloran) and his best bud Randal (Jeff Anderson) kill time by talking about Star Wars.\n\nBut there’s more to this scene, which you can watch above. Now that decades have passed, I realize it was way more than just an endlessly quotable exchange in everyone’s first favorite indie movie. That’s because Randal and Dante weren’t just talking about the plot of Return of the Jedi, and they weren’t even arguing about the merits of the Ewoks. They were talking around the text, with Randal bringing up the idea that when Lando Calrissian and Nien Nunb blew up the unfinished second Death Star, they also killed a whole lotta innocent independent contractors that were just hired to do a job.\n\nI remember this scene blowing my mind as a high schooler, because I’d never thought about applying that kind of mundane, real-world logic to something as fantastical as the most whimsical Star Wars film (the most whimsical one pre-Phantom Menace, at least). But this exchange makes sense. There would have been a lot of independent contractors on the Death Star, installing space toilets and putting up space siding. Whether or not this was the first time a film had devoted a scene to talking about the real world implications of the actions taken in a fictional tale, that’s beside the point. For me, and probably for a generation of high schoolers before and after me, Clerks was the film that opened our mind to thinking outside the plot.\n\nAnd isn’t that what a big chunk of today’s meme culture is all about, taking things out of one context and slapping them into another for emotional impact? Randal’s trying to prove a point to an exasperated Dante, but you can also see where this same idea eventually led to endless online jokes about the meal Han Solo and Leia Organa had to have with Darth Vader after he crashed their Cloud City dinner. The spirit of this scene led to all of the Robot Chicken parody specials, too. And when people point out that Batman would probably be a Republican or that Captain America is probably a virgin, or when Team Decider gets into a spirited half-hour debate about whether or not Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sattler are a couple, we’re all doing what Randal and Dante are doing in that one scene.\n\nToday is Clerks writer/director Kevin Smith’s birthday and, coincidentally, you can now stream Clerks on Netflix. Why not celebrate by revisiting the film that expanded your high school brain? And afterwards ask yourself some important pop culture questions… like will a person be crushed to death if they are seated in a Transformer when they turn into a robot?"
