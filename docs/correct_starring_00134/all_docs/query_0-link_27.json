Meanwhile, Wallace offers to help transfer student Jackie Cook, the fiery, flirty daughter of professional baseball player Terrence Cook, track down the person who damaged her car in the school lot. Later, mayoral candidate Woody Goodman asks Keith to consider running for sheriff.\n\nGoin' Down the Road, Pt. 2\n\nOff his meds and out of control, Craig disappears into the streets.
