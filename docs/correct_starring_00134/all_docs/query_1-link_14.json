        "text": "The film - which is set in the 80’s - follows “three sixteen-year-old friends (played by Austin Zajur, Nicholas Cirillo, and Reed Northrup) who spend their Saturdays sneaking into movies at the local multiplex. But when one of the guys also invites the girl of his dreams (Siena Agudong) to see the latest comedy, each of the teens will learn something serious about life and love before the credits roll.”\n\nWritten and directed by Smith, it also features a star-studded cast including Ken Jeong, Sam Richardson, Genesis Rodriguez, Justin Long, Jason Lee, Rachel Dratch, Kate Micucci, Adam Pally, Harley Quinn Smith, Method Man, and more.\n\nIt was filmed in Highlands, New Jersey, and was filmed at the movie theater which Smith owns, SModcastle Cinemas. It’s especially unique considering the fact that this is the theater where Smith would go see movies as a teenager.\n\nThe film will be distributed by Saban Films and comes out this year."
