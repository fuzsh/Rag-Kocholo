The show included photographs of Marilyn Monroe and Dwight D. Eisenhower, among others. Avedon said about this work, \"I want to make portraits as intense as people. I want your intensity to pass into me, go through the camera and become a recognition to a stranger.\"  \r\n\tUnlike the sharp focus maintained by August Sander, Avedon chose to use a blurred image for Chaplin's portrait. Chaplin's grin may be seen as a devilish reference to his self-imposed horns, a clever reflection of the American media's disapproval of his bohemian lifestyle. Notice how neutral backgrounds and even lighting allows Avedon's portraits of Chaplin and Buster Keaton to pop.",
