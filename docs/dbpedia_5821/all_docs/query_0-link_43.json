It was the era where films were watched while accompanied by a pianist. In this era, Charlie Chaplin became most popular for his character, The Tramp. Charlie Chaplin’s career spanned more than 75 years, since his childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977. His life has sparked both admiration and controversy.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on the Charlie Chaplin or alternatively, you can download our 24-page Charlie Chaplin worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nCharlie Chaplin’s rise to fame is a rags-to-riches story.\n\nCharles Spencer Chaplin was born on April 16, 1889, in London, England.\n\nNot long after his birth, Chaplin’s father became an alcoholic and abandoned him with his mother and older half-brother, Sydney.\n\nChaplin’s mother, Hannah, went by the stage name of Lily Harley, as she was a music hall singer and vaudevillian.\n\nShe was able to support her family for a few years.\n\nOn one performance, Hannah lost her voice for unknown reasons; to continue the show, young Charlie came to the stage to replace her.\n\nChaplin, only five at the time, continued his mother’s performance.\n\nChaplin knew comedy at the time, as he imitated his mother’s cracking voice.\n\nThe audience loved his performance.\n\nUnfortunately, his mother’s voice never returned.\n\nSadly, she also suffered from mental illness and was later confined to an asylum.\n\nEARLY CAREER\n\nChaplin used his mothers contacts to enter showbiz in 1897.\n\nHe landed in a clog-dancing troupe named the Eight Lancashire Lads.\n\nChaplin worked many jobs, such as being a news vendor, printer, and toymaker, but he never lost his dream to be an actor.\n\nChaplin made his first acting role as a pageboy in a production of Sherlock Holmes (1903-1906).\n\nIn 1908, he toured with a vaudeville group named Casey’s Court Circus.\n\nHe teamed up with the Fred Karno Pantomime Troupe and became a star as a drunk man in a comedic sketch.\n\nChaplin got to the United States with the Pantomime Troupe, and there he caught the eye of Mack Sennett, who signed him to a contract for 150 dollars a week.\n\nFILM CAREER\n\nChaplin debuted in a film called Make a Living in 1914.\n\nIn order to be a unique actor, Chaplin decided to stick to a character in his next film.\n\nHis identifiable character is known as “The Little Tramp,” who first appeared in Kid Auto Races at Venice in 1914.\n\nChaplin left Sennett in 1915 to join the Essanay Company, which contracted to pay him $1,250 dollars a week.\n\nWith the Essanay Company, Charlie hired Sydney, his older half-brother, to be his business manager.\n\nChaplin then rose to stardom.\n\nChaplin made 14 films in his first year in the company.\n\nHis first classic film was The Tramp (1915).\n\nThe Tramp is about how his character became an unexpected hero, saving a farmer’s daughter from a gang of robbers.\n\nBy the age of 26, Chaplin moved to Mutual Company, which paid him $670,000 a year.\n\nWhile with Mutual Company, he made some of his best work, such as One A.M. (1916), The Rink (1916), and Easy Street (1917).\n\nAs a filmmaker, Chaplin was known to be a perfectionist.\n\nHowever, the good results were hard to deny as he made his greatest films, such as The Kid (1921), The Pilgrim (1923), A Woman in Paris (1923), and The Gold Rush (1925).\n\nThese films were produced by a company he co-founded named United Artists.\n\nPERSONAL LIFE\n\nChaplin had numerous affairs with women who had roles in his films.\n\nChaplin married Mildred Harris in 1918, who was 16 years old.\n\nChaplin wed again in 1925 with another 16-year-old actress, Lita Grey, whom he’d cast in The Gold Rush. They divorced in 1927.\n\nHe wed again in 1936 to Paulette Goddard, and their marriage lasted until 1942.\n\nIn 1943, Chaplin married Oona O’Neill, who was the daughter of playwright Eugene O’Neill.\n\nTheir marriage was happy and resulted in eight children.\n\nFINAL YEARS\n\nChaplin made his last visit to the United States in 1972 to receive an Honorary Academy Award.\n\nIn 1975, Chaplin was knighted by Queen Elizabeth.\n\nCharlie Chaplin died at his home in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Vaud, Switzerland on December 25, 1977.\n\nTwo men stole Chaplin’s body from the grave for a ransom of $400,000.\n\nEleven weeks later, Chaplin’s body was recovered and the robbers were arrested.\n\nCharlie Chaplin Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about the Charlie Chaplin across 24 in-depth pages.
