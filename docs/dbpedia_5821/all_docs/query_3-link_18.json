        "text": "(1889–1977) . Start with a coat that is too small, trousers and shoes that are too large, a derby hat, a cane, and a ridiculous moustache. Put them together with the genius of Charlie Chaplin and the result is “the Little Tramp,” one of the most famous and best-loved characters ever created for the movie screen. Although he is best known as an actor, Chaplin also wrote, produced, and directed the classic films in which he appeared.\n\nCharles Spencer Chaplin was born in London, England, on April 16, 1889. His parents were music hall performers, and he first appeared on the stage in a dance act at age 8. When Chaplin was 17 he began working for the Fred Karno vaudeville company, which put on shows consisting of short comic sketches. In 1913 the American producer Mack Sennett saw him in the Karno show and urged him to move to California to make motion pictures.\n\nWhile making his second short film, Kid Auto Races at Venice, released in 1914, Chaplin put together the character of the tramp. He developed this foolish, mischievous, yet lovable little man through successive films, creating a character audiences laughed at yet sympathized with at the same time. His movies were great successes, and by 1917 Chaplin was making a million dollars for eight pictures, a fabulous sum at the time. Two years later he, his fellow actors Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, and the director D.W. Griffith formed their own film production company, United Artists.\n\nChaplin’s tramp appeared in such classic feature-length silent films as The Kid (1921) and The Gold Rush (1925). City Lights (1931) was released without dialogue after the end of the silent film era. However, the film had a music score composed by Chaplin, as did all his films thereafter. In Modern Times (1936), he combined comedy with social commentary and fine technical craftsmanship. As World War II began, Chaplin made The Great Dictator (1940), which was intended to ridicule the German dictator Adolf Hitler.\n\nChaplin attracted controversy for his offscreen activities: first for marrying very young women, and later for political views that were considered by some to be un-American. His 1947 film Monsieur Verdoux was attacked as antiwar. In 1952 he released his last American film, Limelight, and moved with his family to Switzerland. His final film was A Countess from Hong Kong (1966). In 1972 he visited the United States to accept a special Academy Award, and in 1975 he was knighted by the queen of England. Chaplin died in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland, on December 25, 1977."
