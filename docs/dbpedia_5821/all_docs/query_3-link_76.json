        "text": "Modern Times is, on the surface, a typical, very physical, Chaplin comedy, but it has some very serious underlying messages. It explores the conflict between man and machine and the affects of automation on work. With the rise of AI, this film has lost none of its topicality…\n\nChaplin’s music beautifully underpins the film, essential in coveting its humour, emotion and powerful themes.\n\nAn all-time great\n\nModern Times is often seen as one of the greatest films of all time. Film review site Rotten Tomatoes has an approval rating for it of 98%, with it’s own review saying “”A slapstick skewering of industrialised America, Modern Times is as politically incisive as it is laugh-out-loud hilarious.”\n\nWhistle while you work\n\nChaplin played the violin and had some musical knowledge, but it didn’t extend to writing out music for a full orchestra. So he used to instead sit (often in the bathroom) and whistle or hum the tunes as they came to him. His assistant, composer David Raskin would then take these raw tunes and write them out for orchestra, working out how they’d synchronise with the action."
