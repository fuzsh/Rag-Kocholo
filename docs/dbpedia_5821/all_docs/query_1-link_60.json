        "text": "Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin popularly known as Charlie Chaplin released his film “The Great Dictator” on 15 October, 1940 in New York City. Where he played a role of dictator who denounced violence and pledged for freedom, democracy, and humanity at large. Whereas around six million Jews lost their lives due to hatred generated by a real dictator between 1941 and 1945, and who later scared to face reality and committed suicide. It appears that in real life humans find violence as an act of courage, admirable, entertaining, inspiring, etc., and remember humanity or act cowardly when they themselves become victims of violence. Incidentally, Charlie Chaplin was born in the month of April (16 April 1889) and in the month of April only Adolf Hitler was born (20 April 1889) and committed suicide (30 April 1945). The irony is that after banning the film “The Great Dictator,” which remained in force until 1958, Adolf Hitler brought print through Portugal and in private screened it twice. But he does not feel any remorse that he and his thoughts were committing a heinous crime on humanity in the name of purity, nobility of race. Ultimately, what happened to that purity, nobility, as many may be wondering today whether they are half-American or half-Russian. However, “The Great Dictator” will remain in world history as a strong voice against the violence raised by a great Braveheart and Champion of humanity, Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin.\n\nCharlie Chaplin was born at East Street, Walworth, in South London. His father was a butcher’s son and working as an entertainer at British music-hall. Whereas his mother was the daughter of a shoemaker and working as a singer in music-hall. Interestingly, Charlie Chaplin has an Indian link through his parental side as his father’s mother was belonged to Romani people who were originated in the Punjab region of northern India and entered Europe between eight and tenth centuries C.E., and they were called as “Gypsies.” The early years of Charlie Chaplin spent with his mother and step brother Sydney in the London district of Kennington. However, his mother does not have any regular source of income and his father does not provide any financial support, and ultimately, they were estranged when Charlie Chaplin was only about one year old. When Charlie Chaplin was twelve-year old his father died at the age of thirty-eight due to alcoholism. Prior to that his father toured the U.S. and performed in New York in 1890, and was arrested for his failure to provide for his children. However, to cope up with Charlie Chaplin’s mother health and financial problem, he was introduced on the stage at the age of five. But the situation further deteriorated and Charlie Chaplin was sent to Lambeth Workhouse when he was seven-year old. However, the council housed him at the Central London District School because of a very poor person and he remembered those days as very sad and lonely. Interestingly, his father introduced him as a professional actor into “The Eight Lancashire Lads.” It was a troupe of young male clog dancers who toured the music halls of Great Britain and Ireland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Charlie Chaplin failed to take any formal education due to family financial problems. However, his mother ensured that he can attend the school when he was touring with the “Eight Lancashire Lads.” But that does not work out and ultimately, he abandoned education by the age of thirteen. It appears that he learned the art of how to laugh with empty pockets during his childhood days. And that becomes his ultimate trump card and make him Charlie Chaplin. Because the common people find something to laugh in the form of Charlie Chaplin to forget their worries and miseries of day-to-day life for some time. However, Charlie Chaplin said about his early days that “I was hardly aware of a crisis because we lived in a continual crisis; and, being a boy, I dismissed our troubles with gracious forgetfulness.”\n\nCharlie Chaplin along with his step brother Sydney, who was also interested in pursuing an acting career start working with different companies. However, he became an accomplished comic performer at the age of eighteen year. And in April 1910 he gets the lead role in “Jimmy the Fearless”, which received considerable press attention. He toured North America as a young comedian who headed the show. His performance impressed the reviewer and got the recognition as “one of the best pantomime artists ever seen here.” He was invited to join the New York Motion Picture Company during his second American tour. This way Charlie Chaplin arrived in Los Angeles and started working for the Keystone studio from 5 January 1914. However, he does not like his first film appearance and he decided to change it. He invented the Tramp character with baggy pants, tight coat, small hat, large shoes, small moustache, which appeared first time in film “Kid Auto Races at Venice,” which became symbol of his existence and enormous popularity. He starts directing the film and his first film was “Caught in the Rain,” which was released on 4 May 1914 and became highly successful. His Tramp image became a cultural phenomenon during 1915, and his merchandise came in the market, he was featured in cartoons and comic strips, and several songs were written about him. Charlie Chaplin’s popularity reaches almost everywhere and he became the film industry’s first international star. He almost works in eighty-two films, and made several cameo appearance and feature in several compilation films. But his film “The Great Dictator,” which remains till date one of the great film and work of courage that dare to call a spade a spade.\n\nBasically, it is natural for a creative person to exert his political opinion when he witnesses atrocities being committed on humanity at large. Probably the same thing might have happened with Charlie Chaplin when he starts a film that mocked Adolf Hitler “The Great Dictator.” As once he said that “To me, the funniest thing in the world is to ridicule impostors, and it would be hard to find a bigger impostor than Hitler. However, he was warned by his colleges from United Artist a movie studio co-owned by him not to proceed with the film. Their concern was that this film will run into censorship trouble. Because English office was very concerned about an anti-Hitler picture and doubted whether it could be shown in Britain. Whereas New York office issued a letter not to make the film that would never be shown in England or America. Because Britain’s appeasement policy was kept going on until March 1939, and America did not enter World War Two until December 1941. But all these apprehensions do not deter Charlie Chaplin from making “The Great Dictator.” However, it was a different matter that the film became 1941’s second biggest hit in the US.\n\nThe most striking highlight of “The Great Dictator” is when the film dictator (Hynkel) tries to borrow money to enhance military power from a Jewish banker and he refused, then furious dictator orders a purge of the Jews. Secondly, the perfect caricature of a dictator such as the fetish for photo opportunities, the lavish lifestyles, policy flip-flops, crackpot schemes, self- aggrandizing events, etc. And thirdly, a climactic monologue that is known as the greatest monologue in film history, and possibly the most poignant recorded speech of the 20th century. Some part of monologue says that “You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power. Let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves, but they enslave the people.” Charlie Chaplin has said that “Had I known the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made The Great Dictator; I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis.” This exactly shows the sincerity and commitment towards humanity of a person who engaged in positive creativity. Probably this tribute will remain shallow and superficial unless and until we do not commit ourselves in the protection and practice of democracy to hand over a civilized world to the coming generations."
