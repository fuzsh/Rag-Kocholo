        "text": "Silent film legend Charlie Chaplin has become Sir Charles after a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe star of such films as The Kid and The Great Dictator was knighted in the New Year's Honours List.\n\nThe ceremony took place just miles from the south London district where he spent much of his childhood.\n\nSir Charles was accompanied to Buckingham Palace by his fourth wife, Oona, and the two youngest of his nine children.\n\nThe slapstick legend, famed for his acrobatic routines, received his knighthood, from a wheelchair.\n\nIt was a reflection of just how late in life - at the age of 85 - his honour had finally come.\n\n'Dumbfounded'\n\nAs he was pushed into the hall where the ceremony was taking place the band struck up his signature tune, the theme from his 1951 film, Limelight.\n\nHe sat stiffly as the Queen tapped him on each shoulder and stooped to hang the KBE insignia around his neck.\n\nThe two then chatted briefly before Sir Charles was wheeled to the front of the hall to watch the rest of the ceremony.\n\nSpeaking to reporters afterwards Sir Charles said he had been \"dumbfounded\" by the occasion.\n\nHe said the Queen had thanked him for what he had done and that his films had helped her a great deal.\n\nSir Charles' knighthood follows years of calls for him to be honoured.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s he was accused of \"communist sympathies\" and vilified in his adopted home of the United States.\n\nIn 1952 his US visa was cancelled forcing Chaplin to relocate to Switzerland.\n\nThree years ago, in what was seen as an act of contrition, he was awarded a special Oscar by the US' Academy of Motion Pictures."
