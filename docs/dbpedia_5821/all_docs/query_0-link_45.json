        "text": "Charlie Chaplin. The name is synonymous with the earliest Hollywood motion pictures.\n\nEveryone recognizes the mustache-sporting, bowler-wearing character that Chaplin so frequently portrayed.\n\nBut fewer people associate Chaplin with a different description: that of an immigrant.\n\nLet’s take a look at Sir Charles Chaplin’s rags-to-riches life and the memorable 1917 film, The Immigrant that was inspired by it.\n\nA Childhood in the Workhouse\n\nCharlie Chaplin lived the good life, spending weekends as the guest of top hotels and at the ultra lavish home of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, aptly named Hearst Castle.\n\nBut life wasn’t always golden for Charlie Chaplin.\n\nRaised in London in the late 19th century, young Chaplin’s existence was a tapestry of turmoil and poverty, punctuated by family struggles and periods of instability.\n\nAt the age of seven, he was sent to a workhouse and housed at the Central London District School for paupers.\n\nTeen Actor, Then Hollywood Star\n\nHis childhood workhouse days were followed by his earliest forays in acting and comedy, ultimately leading him to America during his teenage years thanks to his vaudeville connections.\n\nWithout question, Charlie Chaplin had firsthand knowledge of the struggles that faced immigrants – and the universal feelings and emotions that could be expressed (in the case of a silent film like The Immigrant) without words.\n\nAnd, because he was Charlie Chaplin, he portrayed these struggles with a comedic twist that endeared and enchanted audiences.\n\nA scene from The Immigrant, via giphy.com\n\nIt’s About Time To Find Your Story\n\nWhy, in a career that spanned decades and included dozens of films was “The Immigrant” the film that touched Chaplin “more than any film I’ve made”?\n\nPerhaps because even in the face of fame, fortune, and fan-dom, we’re all affected by our former experiences in a lasting way. And at its core, America is a nation of immigrants.\n\nStart your family search below.\n\nOr take a quick AncestryDNA test to find out more about where your ancestors came from.\n\n– Samantha Johnson"
