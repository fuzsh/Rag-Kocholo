        "text": "Sir Charles (Charlie) Spencer Chaplin was comedic actor, film director, composer and musician. He was born in the United Kingdom and moved to the United States of America (USA) in 1913 and eventually became one of the most creative and influential personalities of the silent-film era. His working life in entertainment spanned over 75 years, from the Victorian stage and the Music-hall in the United Kingdom as a child performer until his death at the age of 88. Chaplin’s most prolific creative activity occurred in the USA from 1914 to the mid 1940s. His most well-regarded movies were made with United Artists and include City Lights (1931), Modern Times (1936), The Great Dictator (1940) and Monsieur Verdoux (1947), although he made many other classic movies. Chaplin was critical to the development of film as an art form and he showed the potential of the medium to communicate complex themes. Chaplin, in his mature period, made intricate films, and provided an abrasive exploitation of p...\n\nIt’s not surprising to see Charlie Chaplin’s on-screen character fall in love with a beautiful girl. Within the body of his work, it’s not even surprising that many of those cinematic charmers were characters on the margins of society, given the social space occupied by many of Chaplin’s own portrayals. The theme of the dance hall girl, however is one that repeats through several of Chaplins’ films over time – A Dog’s Life, The Gold Rush, and A Countess from Hong Kong – and bears additional attention. Not merely wayward or down-and-out, dance hall girls are significant cultural archetypes that combine gender and spectacle in ways that are particularly well-suited to Chaplin’s cinematic characters and bittersweet comedy. This paper, then, will explore the importance of relationships between Charlie and the dance hall girls, with a particular eye toward what these significant cultural figures bring to the construction of Chaplin’s character and narratives.\n\nAlthough many critics have discussed the influence of Chaplin on the theory and practice of Brecht’s epic theater, few have examined the political ramifications of this interaction. That such interaction spanned Brecht’s entire literary career suggests the importance of reciprocally reading these two figures, especially considering the politico-ethical concern they inherit from their nineteenth century forerunner, Karl Marx. If the Marx of The Eighteenth Brumaire is forced into satirical anger by the intrusive interruption of the lumpenproletariat, Chaplin and Brecht make this discontinuous, distracted and trampish figure the central object of their formal and narrative strategies. Beyond the teleology of Marxist science, the lumpen performs the political by exposing the repressed nonsense of social relations, thus suggesting their critique and transformation. This essay argues that epic theater screens these relations in a Chaplin-inflected montage of gestures, positions and attitudes, finding a means, to paraphrase Marx, to separate from the past cheerfully.\n\nThis chapter explores how duality plays out within and across Chaplin’s screen comedy. As a means identifying what is specific about Chaplin’s handling of duality, I contrast the use of this trope within Chaplin’s films with how it operates within the films of other Hollywood comedians such as Bob Hope, Danny Kaye, Jerry Lewis, Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, and Jim Carrey. As I suggest, duality is a recurring technique within comedian comedy, but the various performers deploy and interpret in very different ways. For Kaye and Lewis, for example, duality frequently has a psychological rationale, while Chaplin persistently uses it to address and expose social inequality. I map out the diverse senses in which the concept of duality can be seen to apply to Chaplin’s work and image, arguing that within the films it points towards the way his comic character is identified as a figure who straddles social boundaries (exemplified most tellingly, perhaps, in the ending of The Pilgrim). I connect this to broader operations of comedian comedy, where the comedian figure is frequently a conduit for channelling otherness. I am not proposing that the later comedians are explicitly influenced by Chaplin in this respect, as I suggest that this function is a foundational principle of performer-centred comedy. In The Art of Charlie Chaplin, John Kimber goes so far as to proclaim “compulsive doubleness” as “the most important single clue to his (ie. the Charlie figure’s) spirit”. Kimber identifies Chaplin’s duality as an inheritance of the fool tradition, and I draw upon critical work on the fool and the carnivalesque to scrutinize the manifestations and significance of duality. Following on from Kimber, I explore the various ways in which duality informs Chaplin’s films, focussing in particular on Police and The Pilgrom – but I will also suggest how it characterises the relations between director and performer, performer and role, and the contradictions within Chaplin’s public image."
