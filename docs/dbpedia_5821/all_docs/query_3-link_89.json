        "text": "The inmates have taken over the asylum!\n\nReported by many sites to have been said by Chaplin upon signing the papers to create the United Artists studio (1919), this is believed to actually be derived from a remark about the same event attributed to Richard Rowland, the head of Metro Pictures: \"The lunatics have taken charge of the asylum\"; variant derivations or reports of this statement also include \"The lunatics have taken over the asylum\", and the attribution to Rowland is reported to have occurred at least as early as 1926, in the work A Million and One Nights by Terry Ramsaye, and as recently as in Variety (16 October 2005)\n\nDavid Robinson In Charlie Chaplin: Comic Genius (1996), p. 57, also asserts that a disgruntled film distributor said \"The lunatics are taking over the asylum.\"\n\nSmile though your heart is aching\n\nSmile even though its breaking\n\nWhen there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by\n\nIf you smile with your fear and sorrow\n\nSmile and maybe tomorrow\n\nYou'll find that life is still worthwhile,\n\nIf you just smile\n\n[[Light]] up your face with gladness\n\nHide every trace of sadness\n\nAlthough a tear may be ever so near\n\nThat's the time you must keep on trying\n\nSmile, what's the use of crying?\n\nYou'll find that life is still worthwhile\n\nIf you just smile.\n\nLyrics to \"Smile\", written by John Turner and Geoffrey Claremont Parsons in 1954, the music of which was composed by Chaplin in 1936. - \"Smile\" music, as used in Modern Times (1936) - \"Smile\" tribute to Chaplin, as sung by Michael Jackson\n\nA day without laughter is a day wasted.\n\nWidely attributed to Chaplin and a few others, research done for \"A Day Without Laughter is a Day Wasted\" at Quote Investigator indicate that such expressions date back to that of Nicolas Chamfort, published in \"Historique, Politique et Litteraire, Maximes détachées extraites des manuscrits de Champfort\" Mercure Français (18 July 1795), p. 351: La plus perdue de toutes les journées est celle où l’on n’a pas ri. Translations of this into English have been found as early as one in \"Laughing\" in Flowers of Literature (1803) by F. Prevost and F. Blagdon :\n\nI admire the man who exclaimed, “I have lost a day!” because he had neglected to do any good in the course of it; but another has observed that “the most lost of all days, is that in which we have not laughed;” and, I must confess, that I feel myself greatly of his opinion."
