        "text": "Charlie Chaplin (Charles Chaplin), whose real name is Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin, Jr.. , Is an actor, director, producer and writer born in London UK burlesque April 16, 1889, and died December 25, 1977 in Vevey, Switzerland. By his mime and clowning, he has to get noticed, and become one of the greatest sons of the bullet in Hollywood. He greatly influenced other performers in the film world. Charlie Chaplin was one of the most creative people in the era of silent films. Director, screenwriter, producer, editor, composer and even of his films, his career lasted more than sixty-five years, the music hall in England, until his death in Switzerland. His character Charlie, The Tramp (the tramp) in the Anglo-Saxons, appears for the first time in Kid Auto Races at Venice February 7, 1914. This is a homeless who refined manners and dignity of a gentleman wearing a bowler hat, wearing a jacket and narrow trousers of falling and carrying a bamboo cane flexible. This looks earned him the reputation of \"vagrant\" miserable and beaten, unsocial, stubborn, rebellious and sentimentalHe was strongly inspired by the French burlesque actor Max Linder: both choose a costume of their own. But Max Linder, unlike Charlie Chaplin, will not be represented as a victim of society [3]. The public and private life of Charlie Chaplin will be the subject of adulation, as controversy.\n\nGoogle machine translation: Charlie CHAPLIN's original bio"
