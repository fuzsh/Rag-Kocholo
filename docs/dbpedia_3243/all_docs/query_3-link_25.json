Plaintiff alleges that when a borrower was required to have insurance for his or her property pursuant to a residential mortgage or home equity loan or line of credit, and evidence of acceptable coverage was not provided (for example, when the insurance policy did not exist or had lapsed), RoundPoint would place insurance in a manner such that RoundPoint allegedly received an unauthorized benefit.

In Cobell v. Salazar, No. 96 CV 1285 (TFH) (D. D.C.), which settled for $3.4 billion, Ms. Keough worked with the U.S. Government to implement the administration program responsible for identifying and providing notice to the two distinct but overlapping settlement classes. As part of the notice outreach program, Ms. Keough participated in multiple town hall meetings held at Indian reservations located across the country. Due to the efforts of the outreach program, over 80% of all class members were provided notice. Additionally, Ms. Keough played a role in creating the processes for evaluating claims and ensuring the correct distributions were made. Under Ms. Keough’s supervision, the processing team processed over 480,000 claims forms to determine eligibility. Less than one half of one percent of all claim determinations made by the processing team were appealed. Ms. Keough was called upon to testify before the Senate Committee for Indian Affairs, where Senator Jon Tester of Montana praised her work in connection with notice efforts to the American Indian community when he stated: “Oh, wow. Okay… the administrator has done a good job, as your testimony has indicated, [discovering] 80 percent of the whereabouts of the unknown class members.” Additionally, when evaluating the Notice Program, Judge Thomas F. Hogan concluded (July 27, 2011):\n\n…that adequate notice of the Settlement has been provided to members of the Historical Accounting Class and to members of the Trust Administration Class…. Notice met and, in many cases, exceeded the requirements of F.R.C.P. 23(c)(2) for classes certified under F.R.C.P. 23(b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3). The best notice practicable has been provided class members, including individual notice where members could be identified through reasonable effort. The contents of that notice are stated in plain, easily understood language and satisfy all requirements of F.R.C.P. 23(c)(2)(B).\n\nCIT\n\nOn April 27, 2021, the court granted final approval to a proposed settlement in a class action lawsuit, Georgina Contreras v.

The settlement provides for a fund of $110,000.00 to be paid to individuals that were employed by Monterey Fish Company. This Lawsuit was filed on October 25, 2019 on behalf of all persons who are employed or have been employed by Monterey in the State of California. The operative complaint alleges class-wide claims for failure to provide accurate itemized wage statements and penalties pursuant to Labor Code § 2699, et seq. Defendant denies Plaintiff’s claims, and asserts that it has complied with all of its legal obligations to its employees. The Court has not determined whether Plaintiffs or Defendants are correct, and by reaching a settlement, the parties have agreed to the benefits as described in the Settlement Agreement. The Gross Settlement Fund has been distributed in accordance with the terms of the settlement.\n\nmfc\n\nA proposed settlement has been reached in a class action lawsuit against Costco Wholesale Corporation (\"Costco\").

That way, they avoid the cost of a trial, and the people affected will get compensation. The Class Representative and the attorneys think the settlement is best for everyone who is in the Class.\n\nCS2\n\nOn August 7, 2020, the Court entered an Order and Judgment in an action, Karen Cruz v.

The settlement provides for payments to qualified Class Members to supplement the amount(s) they previously received as reimbursement after making a claim under a SquareTrade Protection Plan.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that SquareTrade underpaid two groups of consumers who purchased SquareTrade Protection Plans, made claims under those Plans, and received a reimbursement from SquareTrade under those Plans. For the first group, known as the Fast Cash Subclass, the lawsuit alleges that after some customers submitted claims under their Protection Plans, SquareTrade sent them a Fast Cash payment equal to its estimate of the replacement cost of the covered item and that this payment was less than it should have been. SquareTrade denies this. For the second group, known as the SKU-cap Subclass, the lawsuit alleges that SquareTrade inadvertently applied a “cap” to the reimbursement amount it paid to a small number of customers. The Plaintiffs and Defendant agree that this cap should not have been applied.\n\nPayment has been distributed in accordance with the terms of the settlement.
