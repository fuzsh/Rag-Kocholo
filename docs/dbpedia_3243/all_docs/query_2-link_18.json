        "text": "You know, you probably don't want to know too many of the players that featured on the side in thos e years you have specified. We had some real impuissant players, to put it nicely. There is a reason that 00 and 01 were the only two years since 1990 that Milan or Juve didn't win the Scudetto. Looking at our roster from then, and you will certainly know why we didn't have a chance in hell.\n\nBergkamp_is_god said:\n\nThey certainly don't look that bad to me\n\nI don't know what super quality you infer out of both of those lineups. Be specific, and I will let you know where a certain player was in his career during a certain year. For example, that 99-00 side that has the likes of Weah and Boban. On initial glimpse, one might say, 'wow.' Now for reality, Weah was a has-been by that point in his career. As for Boban in that year, he had come off a high in the WC 98, and that season saw him start his inevitable decline. 5 or 6 goals he mustered that season, and he was eventually replaced by Rui Costa a season later."
