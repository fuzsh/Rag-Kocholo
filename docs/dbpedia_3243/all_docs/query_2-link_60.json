        "text": "Spalletti guided the unfashionable Udine side to a surprise fourth-placed finish and a Champions League place last season, before opting to head for the challenge of resuscitating Roma.\n\nBut as he prepares the giallorossi for the game, the new man in charge at the Olimpico says his tug-of-war departure from Udinese and the behaviour of club president Giampaolo Pozzo still rankles.\n\n\"Giampaolo Pozzo aimed several insults at me that it will be very difficult to forget or forgive,\" said Spalletti. \"It was easy for Pozzo to say certain things to the fans and picture me as a demon, but I have always treated him with respect, perhaps more than he showed me.\"\n\nEuropa League\n\nLeverkusen stage another dramatic late comeback to reach final and break unbeaten record\n\n09/05/2024 at 21:51\n\nBut Spalletti admitted he was looking forward to seeing many of the players he was able to inspire to new heights last term, and conceded he was fortunate to have gotten the Roma job ahead of the man who ultimately replaced him at the Friuli, Serse Cosmi.\n\n\"It will be a very difficult game against a team that always knows what it wants,\" Spalletti said. \"Serse Cosmi is a great professional and I know he's a lifelong Roma fan who perhaps wanted my job. I guess it just means I was luckier than him this summer.\"\n\nSpalletti will be without injured defensive pair Philippe Mexes and Luigi Sartor, so Sammy Kuffour and Cristian Chivu will continue as the central defensive pairing.\n\nBut Antonio Cassano - who missed the opening day win against Reggina - is again likely to miss out on a place in the starting line-up, despite contract talks between the temperamental ex-Bari forward and the club.\n\n\"I will continue to treat Cassano the same as any of my players,\" declared Spalletti. \"What does irritate me is that Roma won 3-0 at Reggina and all anyone wanted to talk about was Cassano, not the fact that we got the three points without him.\"\n\nUdinese boss Cosmi - who saw his side squeeze past Empoli 1-0 on the opening day - is without the injured Gian Piero Pinzi and Valerio Bertotto.\n\nCHIEVO v PARMA\n\nKeeper Alberto Fontana has overcome a shoulder injury sustained during his heroic display against Juve - Marco Malago and Andrea Mantovani make way for the returns of Lorenzo D'Anna and Fabio Moro in defence, while Sergio Pellissier is dropped in favour of Carvalho Amauri.\n\nParma boss Mario Beretta - sacked by Chievo last season - is expected to give Domenico Morfeo after an impressive substitute performance agasint Palermo, while Bernardo Corradi should keep his place as the lone striker ahead of Marco Delvecchio.\n\nEMPOLI v JUVE\n\nFrancesco Tavano is expected to play on the right wing for Empoli, with Mirco Gasparetto continuing as the lone striker despite the club bringing in Christian Rigano.\n\nLECCE v ASCOLI\n\nAfter the opening day defeat to Livorno, coach Angelo Gregucci will opt for a 4-4-2 formation with Alexei Eremenko being dropped in favour of the muscular Axel Konan, with Graziano Pelle losing out to last season's top scorer Mirko Vucinic.\n\nCoach Marco Giampaolo is expected to tinker with the side that drew with Milan on the opening day with new boys Maurizio Domizzi and Massimo Paci coming into central defence.\n\nMESSINA v FIORENTINA\n\nRafael the only man missing for Bortolo Mutti's side, who only lost two home games last season.\n\nCesare Prandelli is without Christian Maggio and Brazilian midfielder Guilherme Do Prado, but will hope Luca Toni and Stefano Fiore can repeat their goalscoring feats of the opening-day win over Samp.\n\nSAMPDORIA v REGGINA\n\nMarco Pisano will replace Lamberto Zauli at left-back, while Emiliano Bonazzoli and Francesco Flachi will continue to form the strikeforce with Fabio Bazzani and Giulio Falcone still injured.\n\nCarlos Humberto Paredes is banned after being sent off in the opening day loss to Roma, while Rolando Bianchi is injured - Filippo Carobbio and Luca Vigiani come in.\n\nTREVISO v LIVORNO\n\nNew boys Raffaele De Martino, Dino Fava and William Viali will have to wait a little longer as Ezio Rossi surprisingly keeps faith with the same side that were well beaten 3-0 by an Adriano-inspired Inter.\n\nMarco Amelia keeps his place in goal for Livorno despite the arrival of Paolo Acerbis, but Francesco Coco and Diego De Ascentis look likely to make their debuts.\n\nCAGLIARI v LAZIO (20:30 cet)\n\nAntonio Langella and Andrea Cossu miss out for the home side, while Uruguayan defender Joe Bizera is also unavailable.\n\nGoran Pandev is set to keep his place alongside Tommaso Rocchi up front for Lazio after scoring the winner against Messina. Former Cagliari striker Igli Tare is still injured, as is Fabio Liverani.\n\nSerie A\n\nRoma and Juventus share the points in tense draw\n\n05/05/2024 at 21:09\n\nEuropa League\n\nAndrich stunner sees Leverkusen's unbeaten run continue with first-leg triumph\n\n02/05/2024 at 21:21"
