The Art Institute of California – Inland Empire is opening its own 1,500 square art gallery, one of the largest in San Bernardino, and the first in the Hospitality Lane area. It will open with an exhibition of rarely-seen advertising posters from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including works by Jules Chéret and Alphonse Mucha.\n\nThe show, The Golden Age of Poster Design, runs Jan. 21 through Feb. 5, 2010. An opening reception takes place 6:30 to 9 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 21.\n\n“We are pleased to bring to the Inland Empire this glimpse of life from that era, as immortalized by the leading designers and illustrators of the time,” said Jonathan DeAscentis, Dean of Academic Affairs for The Art Institute of California – Inland Empire. “Many of these posters are on loan from Gary Gibson, owner of The Vintage Poster Gallery of Laguna Beach, others from private collections.”\n\n“We are really privileged to have this exhibit” said Ronald Lana, MFA, Director of the new gallery. “These artists were the original masters of graphic design and advertising.”\n\nThe posters range primarily from the 1890s to the 1930s. The featured posters include:\n\n• Pippermint Get Frere, Jules Chéret, 1899\n\n• Princezna Hyacinta, Alphonse Mucha, 1910\n\n• La Mason du Porte-Plume, Jean D’Ylen, 1928\n\n• Vermouth Martini, Leonetto Cappiello, 1912\n\n• Meton, Roger Broders, 1923\n\n• Brittania Day, James Montgomery Flagg, 1918\n\n• Scribner’s, Charles Dana Gibson, 1897\n\nThe posters are lithographs, a style of printing still used today to create original works of art. Today, an artist can create the work on a computer, then send it electronically to a printing press.\n\n“Many of the posters to be exhibited are stone lithographs,” Lana explained. “An artist draws directly on the stone with grease pencils. After a process, the stone is covered with ink, which is then pressed onto paper. They could only print a few posters at a time from each stone.”\n\nIn late 19th century Europe, poster art began when booksellers displayed small lithograph posters in their store windows to attract attention to various literary works. These works of art then progressed into large format advertising posters.\n\n“Poster art was different from the art that people were familiar with then,” Lana said. “Before this type of art developed, people went to galleries and appreciated the original art solely for its beauty. The poster was intended from the very beginning for functional use, in other words, for the street.”\n\nAmong the early masters of poster art were Paris artists Jules Cheret, who is considered “The Father of Poster Art,” and Alphonse Mucha, the orignator of the style “Art Nouveau.”\n\nCheret’s posters promoted operas, cabarets, circuses and a kerosene distributor whose fuel lit the gas lamps of Paris, toys and many other items sold by merchants of his day.\n\nAlphonse Mucha was a Czech illustrator and designer who advertised many products, including theaters and cabarets. He created the most well-known poster for actress Sara Bernhardt, who became one of the most famous actresses of her time.\n\nIn the 20th century, and in the past decade, graphic design and other forms of commercial art have become essential to our lives. Most people see many forms of commercial art on a daily basis, from newspapers and magazines, billboards, t-shirts and other clothing, to television, websites, video games and movies.\n\nThe Art Institutes (a system of more than 45 colleges, including The Art Institute of California – Inland Empire) dedicates its programs to forms of commercial art.\n\nThe Art Institute of California – Inland Empire offers Bachelor of Science degree programs in Game Art & Design, Graphic Design, Web Design & Interactive Media, Interior Design, Fashion & Retail Management, Culinary Management and Media Arts & Animation. It offers Associate of Science degree programs in Graphic Design, Culinary Arts and Baking and Pastry, and a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree program in Fashion Design.\n\nEach program is offered on a year-round basis, allowing students to work uninterrupted toward their degrees.\n\nIt’s not too late to start at The Art Institute of California – Inland Empire. Courses begin January 11 and classes are offered in the day, evening and on weekends for new and reentry students.\n\nFor more information or a tour of The Art Institute of California – Inland Empire call (909) 915-2100 or go on line to artinstitutes.edu/inlandempire.\n\nThe Art Institute of California – Inland Empire is one of The Art Institutes (www.artinstitutes.edu), a system of over 45 education institutions located throughout North America, providing an important source of design, media arts, fashion and culinary arts professionals.\n\n-end-\n\nContinue Reading\n\nNo Comments\n\nCulinary Students Bring Smiles To Hospital's Kids\n\nJeanne Durbin, a.k.a. Mrs. Claus, puts a completed gingerbread house into the Gingerbread Village that will be on display all of December at Loma Linda University Children’s Hospital.\n\nJessica Jones, a Culinary Arts student at The Art Institute of California – Inland Empire, helps Jessica Smith, 12, who receives outpatient chemotherapy at Loma Linda University Children’s Hospital, in putting the finishing touches on a gingerbread house on Tuesday, Dec. 1. Jessica Smith’s house is one of 100 created by children at the hospital, now on display in the lobby.\n\nBradley Mandapat, a Culinary Arts student at The Art Institute of California – Inland Empire helps Loma Linda University Children’s Hospital Patient Nicholas Iraheta, 6, decorate a gingerbread house at the hospital, one of 100 created by patients like him and other children who came to the hospital on Tuesday, Dec. 1.\n\nJim Durbin, who as Santa Claus delights patients and other young hospital visitors alike, prepares to place a newly-completed gingerbread house in the Loma Linda University Children’s Hospital Gingerbread Village.\n\n(SAN BERNARDINO, Calif.) Culinary Arts students from The International Culinary School at The Art Institute of California – Inland Empire lent their artistic flair on Tuesday, Dec. 1 to help seriously ill children at Loma Linda University Children’s Hospital create beautiful and unique gingerbread homes.\n\n“The children are just delighted,” said Eloise Habekost, president of Big Hearts for Little Hearts, a service organization for the children’s hospital and the organizer of this annual event. “They are thrilled to have this distraction from their usual hospital routines.”\n\nIn addition, The Art Institute of California – Inland Empire donated 50 of the gingerbread houses created by the children. Big Hearts for Little Hearts, donated another 50, and its member Dottie Rice donated candy to use for decoration.\n\n“She spends the entire year collecting this candy,” said Habekost.\n\nJessica Smith, 12, spent two months not long ago at Loma Linda University Children’s Hospital battling cancer. She still must return frequently for chemotherapy, and at the end of her Dec. 1 treatment, a hospital worker suggested she join other children in the hospital lobby to decorate one of the gingerbread houses.\n\nFor two hours, Jessica and her mother Teresa Aripez worked on an elaborate gingerbread house together. Then, to Aripez’s relief, six students from The Art Institute of California – Inland Empire arrived ready to help and encourage Jessica and the other sick children.\n\n“When they got here, my energy and patience were running low,” Aripez noted. “They came in with new ideas and a lot of patience. Jessica loved it.”\n\nJessica Smith immediately bonded with Culinary Arts student Jessica Jones because of their shared first name. Jessica Jones recalled that the only other time she had ever decorated a gingerbread house was when she was 12, the same age as her new friend is now.\n\nFor almost another hour, the two Jessicas continued working on the gingerbread house, which now features several candy trees and two well-decorated gingerbread people.\n\nMeanwhile, fellow Culinary Arts student Bradley Mandapat entertained both Jessicas with jokes, until more children arrived needing his expertise on their gingerbread houses.\n\nHabekost noted that many children are involved in creating these homes. They include patients, children like Jessica who come for outpatient services, and in some cases, children simply visiting the hospital.\n\n“Some of them are in isolation because they have swine flu,” she said. “They work on the gingerbread houses in their rooms, wearing gloves to prevent contamination. Other children come here to receive kidney dialysis, and work on these during their treatment to pass the time.”\n\nThe finished houses are on public display in the hospital lobby where they’ll be shown through the middle of January.\n\nHabekost says that people come from all over the Inland Empire just to see what the young patients have come up with.\n\nThe Art Institute of California – Inland Empire offers Bachelor of Science degree programs in Game Art & Design, Graphic Design, Web Design & Interactive Media, Interior Design, Fashion & Retail Management, Culinary Management and Media Arts & Animation.

He primarily worked as an illustrator for National Geographic magazine after moving to New York, but in 2005 transitioned to a full-time career as an author and freelance illustrator.\n\nHis freelance clients include the U.S. Postal Service, for which he illustrated stamps featuring dinosaurs and sickle-cell awareness, and a post card depicting pioneer settlements in the Northwest Territory in 1788.\n\nGurney has exhibited his work at many museums, including the Smithsonian in Washington D.C., the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass. and a museum in Switzerland.
