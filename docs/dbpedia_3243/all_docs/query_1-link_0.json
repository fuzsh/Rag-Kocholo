        "text": "Italian former footballer\n\nDiego De Ascentis (born 31 July 1976) is an Italian former footballer who played as a midfielder.\n\nClub career\n\n[edit]\n\nDe Ascentis started his career at Como in 1993 before moving to Bari in 1996. Three years later, he transferred to AC Milan for a season.\n\nIn 2000, he transferred to Torino. After Torino went bankrupt in 2005 he moved to Genoa, joining the club in July 2005; however, Genoa was demoted to Serie C1 later that month as punishment for match-fixing, prompting De Ascentis to transfer to Livorno. After the reformed Torino regained promotion to Serie A, he rejoined the Turin club for another season.\n\nHe signed a three-year contract with Atalanta in the summer of 2007[citation needed] and was released in the summer of 2009. He re-signed with the club on 8 October that year,[1][2] and departed again at the end of the 2009â€“10 season.\n\nInternational career\n\n[edit]\n\nDe Ascentis was capped for the U-21 and Olympic teams (the former of which won the 1997 Mediterranean Games).\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
