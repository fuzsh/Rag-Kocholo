He works for the people and is an example for others. His training programmes are simply mindblowing! His men were the first to reach Orissa after the super cyclone.

I'd vote him as the Indian of the year for his dynamism and his struggle for the upliftment of the poor.\n\nName: shankar\n\nEmail: shankar_t@satyam.net.in\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: Our country has had people who became local heroes and momentary champions, but 1999 saw this man emerge taller than ever before to symbolise the true India.\n\nName: Siva Kumar M Pillai\n\nEmail: siva@public1.sta.net.cn\n\nNomination: Sachin Tendulkar\n\nReason why: In a nation divided over caste, religion, language etc, Sachin is the unifying figure admired by one and all.\n\nName: abeezar burhanpurwala\n\nEmail: abeezar@sasi.com\n\nNomination: Mahatma Gandhi\n\nReason why: He sacrificed his life for our freedom.\n\nName: Ritwick Ray\n\nEmail: ritwick@tata.cummins.com\n\nNomination: Saurav Ganguly\n\nReason why: For consistent performance in the cricketing arena throughout 1999.\n\nName: hemjith\n\nEmail: hemjith@rediff.com\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: An outstanding personality.

He also knows how to win mass appeal through populist schemes. I would vote for him if he is to be elected as our prime minister. We need many such people. Well done Mr Naidu!\n\nName: Mohd meeran\n\nEmail: samr72@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Annai Teresa\n\nReason why: Sacrificing nature and for her gratitude.\n\nName: RAMESH PILLAI\n\nEmail: rameshanpillai@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: Best suited for his job as the prime minister of this great nation in these troubled times.\n\nName: dr amit dave\n\nEmail: amitdoc@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Prof Amartya Sen\n\nReason why: He made us proud to be Indians.\n\nName: Neilabh\n\nEmail: neilabh@yahoo.com\n\nNomination: Acharya Ramlochan Saran\n\nReason why: He is the pioneer of publishing in Bihar.

Got a shot in his arm when the US did the same thing in Afghanistan. I am really proud to nominate him as the Indian of the year.\n\nName: s s rao\n\nEmail: ssrao19@rediffmail.com\n\nNomination: Sonia Gandhi\n\nReason why: This dynamic lady is the sole reason why the Congress fared well in the recent elections. But truly speaking, she deserves to be voted as the Indian of the year because this year saw her rise from simply being Mrs Rajiv Gandhi to a becoming a force to reckon with in politics -- a force upon whom the Congress party relied heavily to restore its lost glory. And the fact that she had no prior political experience just goes to show the strength of her persona ! (This comes from a long time BJP voter )\n\nName: alok kumar\n\nEmail: poorti@mantraonline.com\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: He has given India stability, victory in war and pride. He has a very clean image and is the only person on whom we people pin our hopes for a resurgence of our nation.\n\nName: Akumalla Subramanyam\n\nEmail: ak_sub@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: He has really stood out as a successful politician and leader. He has changed the outlook of our country by going ahead with his nuclear plans and successfully testing our nuclear scientists' abilities. This has reposed lot of confidence in the countrymen. Also, heading a party like the BJP which is doing a balancing act between the Hindu fascists and the rest, he has proved to be an astute statesman. He leaves me with no other choice. Vajpayeeji is my 'Indian Of the Year'!\n\nName: D.Ravikumar\n\nEmail: dravi@www.com\n\nNomination: Arundhati Roy\n\nReason why: She created history with her debut novel. She donated the money that came to her with the Booker Prize for a good cause. She is fighting for real social problems.\n\nName: Ram Enganti\n\nEmail: enagantir@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: P V Narasimha Rao\n\nReason why: The man who changed the way we had been doing business for the last 50 years!\n\nName: Nimish Thaker\n\nEmail: n_cthaker@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: A good leader after a long, long time. He has the vision and the capability to take our country into the next millennium.\n\nName: mvsrao\n\nEmail: mvsrao@hd2.dot.net.in\n\nNomination: Chandrababu Naidu\n\nReason why: Man with a vision, works hard to achieve his goal -- to make Andhra Pradesh the number one state in India in all spheres. His policies are very object-oriented. He seems to have a grasp over all fields. His main ideology is to eradicate poverty and to make education compulsory. He is an intellectual, a genius! He is completely different from the rest of the Indian politicians.. In barely four-and-a-half years as chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, his achievements are many. He is the first CM in India to bring IT into the day-to-day administration of a state. In India, Andhra Pradesh is the only state to computerise registration offices, which in itself is a big task. He talks less of politics and makes efforts to increase efficiency in all spheres of administration. While all the other politicians can only talk, Naidu is proving himself by implementing various development schemes. We require such ideal politicians to take the country to glorious heights.\n\nName: krishna chandak\n\nEmail: eehaw@rocketmail.com\n\nNomination:Sardar Patel.\n\nReason why: Would there have been a unified India were it not for his efforts?\n\nName: Vibha Agarwal\n\nEmail: a_vibha@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: Because he is the best. He is taking India in the right direction He is the greatest politician India has ever had.\n\nName: som Kolluri\n\nEmail: somkolluri@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: His tenacious and clean handling of the Kargil crisis earned a special place for modern India as a silent super power.\n\nName: Esther c Mascarenhas\n\nEmail:\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: With his super smooth skills he has pulled his government and the country through a year of trials.\n\nName: Devadas\n\nEmail: dsrinivasan@dellnet.com\n\nNomination: Abdul Kalam\n\nReason why: Every Indian is proud of him!\n\nName: SITARAM\n\nEmail: sitaram_yakkati@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Dr Raj Reddy\n\nReason why: Technical advisor to the American President\n\nName: Sridhar Raju\n\nEmail: sridhar_raju@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Chandrababu Naidu\n\nReason why: A very successful person who has managed to grow as a politician and strengthen the economy of Andhra Pradesh..\n\nName: Deepraj S Deshmukh\n\nEmail: deeprajdeshmukh@yahoo.com\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: He is a true politician, a true human being, a real thinker and a great PM!\n\nName: Krishna\n\nEmail: kudaravalli@usa.com\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: Because there is no alternative to him.\n\nName: Mohan Dadlani\n\nEmail: mgdadlani@rediff.com\n\nNomination: Swami Vivekananda\n\nReason why: Swamiji awakened Indians. After being ruled by Muslims and Britishers for nearly 1000 years, we Hindus had lost self -respect and self-confidence. Swamiji's speeches and his trips to USA made Hindus realise that we are second to none. He walked through Indian towns and saw the plight of his countrymen. He sympathised with poor people. Swamiji established the Ramakrishna Mission and Math. These two institutions have been rendering selfless service to the people of India and spreading Vedantic philosophy in many countries. There is no one who has achieved so much. Let us pay homage to this great modern saint.\n\nName: Dr.Suhas Kotbagi\n\nEmail: kotbagi@usa.net\n\nNomination: JRD Tata\n\nReason why: A great pioneering industrialist. Because of him, millions of people have food on their plates today. He also put India on the international map with his first flight from Karachi to Bombay.\n\nName: Kishore\n\nEmail: pkkishore@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Chandrababu Naidu\n\nReason why: For his excellent service to Andhra Pradesh\n\nName: Sandeep\n\nEmail: sandeeppimplapure@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: The unknown Indian soldier\n\nReason why: 'His is not to reason why, his is but to do and die'. He made the country proud and kept it safe (thereby helping the BJP win the polls). Of course, most of us will give our votes to Sachin Tendulkar, Leander Paes, Yukta Mookhey, Infosys and others, but it is the Indian soldier who is the real hero who acted with exemplary courage. Kudos!\n\nName: sanyukta dutta\n\nEmail: sandy_21@rediffmail.com\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: Brought glory to India with the way he handled Kargil.\n\nName: Rajesh\n\nEmail: rajeshcs@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Dr Abdul Kalam\n\nReason why: Nuclear power made our country proud this century\n\nName: Karuna Kiran\n\nEmail: k_kiran@mailcity.com\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: He singlehandedly brought his party back to power. And the way he handled Kargil was exemplary. He is not involved in scams or unnecessary controversies.. He seems to know the power of the post he is holding and through his way of administration, has so far not brought any danger to his coalition ministry. He is fair and just, not bowing to outside pressure. He is the man of the year. In fact, 1999 has been the year of Mr Vajpayee!\n\nName: Nadella Srinivas\n\nEmail: nadellasv@yahoo.com\n\nNomination: Chandrababu Naidu\n\nReason why: He is a great politician\n\nName: Akshat Khandelwal\n\nEmail: khandu@telebot.com\n\nNomination: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupati\n\nReason why: They have brought us so much glory! Whoever thought that Indians could excel in a sport like tennis!! They are the only Indians to display team spirit in any kind of activity\n\nName: Vidya Krishnan\n\nEmail: srkvid@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: He proved his worth and answered his critics by winning the elections.\n\nName: dinkarrao\n\nEmail: dinkarrao@hotmail.com\n\nNomination:Indian soldiers\n\nReason why: These fine young men are ready to lay down their lives for their country which is run by corrupt politicians, bureaucrats and tax dodging citizens.\n\nName: arvind dundoo\n\nEmail: adundoo@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Amitabh Bachchan\n\nReason why: He is the only superstar in the world who has ruled the film industry for 25 long years and is still going strong .\n\nName: hithendra\n\nEmail: hithendra@rediffmail.com\n\nNomination: Subhas Chandra Bose\n\nReason why: Fought for the nation with true heart.\n\nName: Nataraj\n\nEmail: bsnataraj@rediffmail.com\n\nNomination: Swami Vivekananda\n\nReason why: Changed the whole nation and brought India and Hinduism to the forefront in the world.\n\nName: Dinesh\n\nEmail: dineshsheshadri@rediffmail.com\n\nNomination: Swami Vivekananda\n\nReason why: Changed the whole nation and brought India and Hinduism to the forefront in the world\n\nName: jairaj\n\nEmail: jairajk@rediff.com\n\nNomination: Chandrababu Naidu\n\nReason why: For his administrative skills and his ability to shun dirty politics. He should be a lesson for other Indian politicians.\n\nName: rahul jain\n\nEmail: rah_jain@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Chandrababu Naidu\n\nReason why: Great visionary and is development oriented.\n\nName: Haresh Mirchandaney\n\nEmail: ham10@cornell.edu\n\nNomination: Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose\n\nReason why: Netaji serves as an inspiration to Indians everywhere and was a great foil to the defeatist, pacifist strain that runs through Indian history. Unlike the pretenders, charlatans and fakers who supposedly led India to independence, Netaji did his duty and created a record of action and accomplishments which all Indians can admire, be they Pathans in the northwest frontier, Baluchis in Baluchistan, Punjabis in Lahore or Bengalis in Dhaka. It is only right that the current Indian leadership make the reunification of India a top priority given his legacy. If Germany can reunite and Northern Ireland can achieve home rule, there is absolutely no reason for India to remain partitioned. As the INA demonstrated, religious differences are artificial and are a product of Britain's colonial ambitions.\n\nName: G Santhanam\n\nEmail: gsanthanam@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Abdul Kalam and R Chidambaram\n\nReason why: The Pokhran nuclear test.\n\nName: sankar\n\nEmail: ssn_sce@yahoo.com,ssn_sce@hotmail.com,sankaranarayanan_ssn@rediff.com\n\nNomination: Sachin Tendulkar\n\nReason why: He is the best captain and cricketer in the whole cricketing world.\n\nName: G Santhanam\n\nEmail: gsanthanam@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Kargil heroes\n\nReason why: Kargil\n\nName: BIPIN VORA\n\nEmail: telenet@cal2.vsnl.net.in\n\nNomination: Yukta Mookhey\n\nReason why: Best woman of the year!\n\nName: shamsiya\n\nEmail: shamsiya@123india.com\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: He is a good prime minister.\n\nName: Shreelakshmi K\n\nEmail: shreeraj12@aol.com\n\nNomination: Chandrababu Naidu\n\nReason why: The AP chief minister has brought about a lot of changes in the state. Although he hasn't done much at the national level, he seems to be an inspiration to many other politicians. I personally have nothing to gain from him nor do I belong to the state of Andhra Pradesh, but I do feel that he is one of the few politically sound people in India.\n\nName: Naresh Holla B\n\nEmail: hollan2@anz.com\n\nNomination: Leander Paes\n\nReason why: At least in one sport we have a world number one thanks to him. He has greatly helped in popularising tennis in India. India needs more such people.\n\nName: Dhiraj Mirchandaney\n\nEmail: dhirajm@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Mahatma Gandhi\n\nReason why: If it weren't for his satyagrahas, my generation would never had heard of a term called 'Dharna'. There would have been civil war long back and life wouldn't be the same today.\n\nName: S. SATYANARAYANA RAO\n\nEmail: satya999@rediffmail.com\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: He is the first prime minister of India who has come back to power on a pro-vote after Indira Gandhi. He is also the first prime minister to do so without the Indian National Congress mark.\n\nName: C Srinivas\n\nEmail: srini@niithyd.niit.co.in\n\nNomination: Indian army\n\nReason why: For its valiant efforts in defending the territorial integrity of this nation.\n\nName: Amal\n\nEmail: amal@kodak.com\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: Makes me feel proud to be an Indian. He is changing the public's perception of politicians who are all seen as power hungry and corrupt.\n\nName: Sashidhar R\n\nEmail: rsashidhar@usa.net\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: For the way he handled the Kargil conflict\n\nName: SANJAY AGNIHOTRI\n\nEmail: agnis@rediff.com\n\nNomination: JRD TATA\n\nReason why: He is the architect of modern India. He spent his entire life trying to make India and Indians prosperous. I personally think that in the present scenario, India needs people like JRD Tata, not foolish politicians.\n\nName: Alok\n\nEmail: alokgera@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Subhas Chandra Bose\n\nReason why: Because he fought bravely for the independence of our country. And singlehandedly raised the Indian National Army. He is the greatest freedom fighter.\n\nName: Thakare Rajesh B\n\nEmail: rajthakare@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Lata Mangeshkar\n\nReason why: Because every second of the day someone, somewhere, is listening to her voice.\n\nName: Sanjoy Sinha\n\nEmail: ssinha@cal.bhel.co.in\n\nNomination: Kashmiri Pandits\n\nReason why: For their resilience in coping with whatever comes their way. They have been displaced from their homes, they have been promised a lot of things but nothing has materialised. Theirs has been an endless wait with no light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nName: DIPANKAR DE\n\nEmail: d_de53@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: He has brought us fame after we won the Kargil war. His strong leadership is helping India progress finally.\n\nName: Srinivasa Prasad K\n\nEmail: srinivasaprasad@rediffmail.com\n\nNomination: N Chandrababu Naidu\n\nReason why: Providing vision for the development of not just his state but also to other states. He has been a sort of a model for other chief minister s, many of whom have now started following his plans, policies and actions.\n\nName: MADHURI RAO\n\nEmail: madhurirao@eudoramail.com\n\nNomination: Chandrababu Naidu\n\nReason why: One has to only visit Hyderabad to see how Andhra Pradesh has changed so much for the better. It is a state to watch in the next millennium.\n\nName: Dilip jain\n\nEmail: dilipsjain@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Mahatma Gandhi\n\nReason why: The only person I feel is worth the honour.\n\nName: alpana mishra\n\nEmail: alpana.mishra@lintasindia.com\n\nNomination: Mahatama Gandhi\n\nReason why: He made the biggest difference to this country. There would have been no independence for anyone without his endeavours.\n\nName: Gemma Dhanaraj\n\nEmail: gemma1210@rediffmail.com\n\nNomination: Mother Teresa\n\nReason why: The reasons are obvious. She was a true angel of mercy and a guiding light for millions, the epitome of goodness, kindness and mercy.\n\nName: vijay.ch\n\nEmail: chennupati@rediffmail.com\n\nNomination: Chandrababu Naidu\n\nReason why: He has redefined present day politics with his hard work and interest in implementing new technologies.\n\nName: John Joseph\n\nEmail: josephj@parlis.nic.in\n\nNomination: K.R.Narayanan\n\nReason why: Well, isn't he the first citizen?\n\nName: kailash joshi\n\nEmail: kailash87@hotmail.com\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: He not only fought and won political wars but also the Kargil war.\n\nName: Shivendra Prasad\n\nEmail: shivendraprasad@rediffmail.com\n\nNomination: Atal Bihari Vajpayee\n\nReason why: He not only led his party from the front but the whole coalition as well. Now he is all set to lead the nation into the next millennium. In his fresh term he has proved that he is ready to take hard decisions like opening up the insurance sector etc., the results of which will benefit citizens in the years to come.\n\nName: divya shukla\n\nEmail: divya.shukla@mailcity.com\n\nNomination: Rabindranath Tagore\n\nReason why: Because he was a great man, a man of many talents -- in poetry, painting and also writing."
