        "text": "Indian Poets – A Tribute\n\nHonouring poets like Shakespeare and Keats is fine, but do you know any Indian poet? Chances are that Indians don’t know much about their own poets except perhaps Kabir. 24 February is celebrated as Sant Ravidas Diwas.\n\nRavidas or Raidas (flourished 15th or 16th century) was an Indian mystic poet-saint of the North Indian Bhakti movement. Venerated as a guru in the modern regions of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, and Haryana, he was a poet, social reformer and spiritual figure.\n\nRavidas was born in Varanasi as a member of an untouchable leather-working caste, and his poems and songs often revolve around his low social position. While objecting to the notion that caste plays a fundamental role in an individual’s relationship to God, Ravidas contrasted his own lowliness to the exalted place of the divine.\n\nSome 40 of the poems attributed to Ravidas were included in the Adi Granth (“First Volume”), the sacred scripture of Sikhism, and it is generally accepted that Ravidas met Nanak, the first Guru and founder of the Sikh tradition. In the 19th and 20th centuries a new religious movement formed around his figure. A temple was built in his hometown, where he was worshipped; his hymns were recited every morning and night; and his birthday was celebrated as a religious event. His egalitarian teachings made him a figure of veneration and pride among various scheduled classes, or Dalit (as untouchables are now known), social-reform movements of the 20th century.\n\nSome of his poems / dohas –\n\nरैदास प्रेम नहिं छिप सकई, लाख छिपाए कोय।\n\nप्रेम न मुख खोलै कभऊँ, नैन देत हैं रोय॥\n\nभावार्थ:- रैदास कहते हैं कि प्रेम कोशिश करने पर भी छिप नहीं पाता, वह प्रकट हो ही जाता है। प्रेम का बखान वाणी द्वारा नहीं हो सकता। प्रेम को तो आँखों से निकले हुए आँसू ही व्यक्त करते हैं।\n\nजनम जात मत पूछिए, का जात अरू पात।\n\nरैदास पूत सब प्रभु के, कोए नहिं जात कुजात॥\n\nभावार्थ:- रैदास कहते हैं कि किसी की जाति नहीं पूछनी चाहिए क्योंकि संसार में कोई जाति−पाँति नहीं है। सभी मनुष्य एक ही ईश्वर की संतान हैं। यहाँ कोई जाति, बुरी जाति नहीं है।\n\nIf You are a mountain\n\nby Ravidas\n\nEnglish version by Nirmal Dass\n\nIf You are a mountain,\n\nthen I am a peacock.\n\nIf You are the moon,\n\nthen I am a partridge.\n\nO Madho, if You break from me,\n\nthen I shall break with You.\n\nAnd if I break from You,\n\nto whom shall I then go?\n\nIf You are the lamp,\n\nthen I am the wick.\n\nIf You are the shrine,\n\nthen I am the pilgrim.\n\nMy love for You\n\nis true and real.\n\nWhen I fell in love with You,\n\nI gave up my love for others.\n\nWherever I go,\n\nthere I seek to serve You.\n\nNo other god\n\ncan be a Master like You.\n\nBy praising You,\n\nI cut Yama’s noose.\n\nYearning for love\n\nRavi Dass loudly sings.\n\nSeeing the beautiful dohas (couplets) and poems by Sant Ravidas don’t you feel that it is so beautiful seeing the words flow with so much love and meaning?\n\nLet’s discover more Indian Poets and learn about them and their important works.\n\nA few of them are being listed here –\n\nAmulya Barua (1922–1946), first published posthumously in 1964\n\nAtul Chandra Hazarika (1903–1986), poet, dramatist, children’s story writer and translator\n\nParvati Prasad Baruva (1904-1964), lyricist, poet and filmmaker\n\nBhabananda Deka (born 1929), writer, poet, critic, columnist, playwright\n\nGanesh Gogoi (born 1907–1938)\n\nHem Barua (1915–1977), poet and politician\n\nLakshminath Bezbarua, a doyen of Assamese literature\n\nChandra Kumar Agarwala, Romantic poet\n\nHemchandra Goswami, Romantic poet\n\nAmbikagiri Raichoudhury, Romantic poet\n\nAbul Bashar (born 1951), poet and writer\n\nAnnadashankar Roy (1905–2002)\n\nBharatchandra Ray (1712–1760), Raygunakar, Shakta court poet and song writer in Krishnanagar\n\nBinoy Majumdar (1934–2006), Indian poet\n\nBishnu Dey (1909–1982), poet, prose writer, movie critic\n\nBuddhadeb Basu (also spelled “Buddhadeva Bose”) (1908–1974), poet, novelist, short-story writer and essayist\n\nChandidas (born 1408 CE), refers to (possibly more than one) medieval poet\n\nDwijendralal Ray (1863–1913), poet, playwright, and musician, known primarily for patriotic plays and songs, as well as Hindu devotional lyrics\n\nGirindramohini Dasi (1858–1924), 19th century poet\n\nA.
