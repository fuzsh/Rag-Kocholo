        "text": "Bihar like other states of India is rich in various languages and dialects . There are 38 districts in Bihar where linguistic classification can be seen . There are various languages or dialects spoken in Bihar . People outside the Bihar get confuse most of the time and consider different languages or dialects as one and also started terming them together as Bihari language.\n\nBihari language is a General term for the languages speak in Bihar . There is also a big misconception about the languages of Bihar that all Biharis speak only Bhojpuri .\n\nDifference between Language and Dialect :\n\nAs wikipedia says language is written as well as spoken where as Dialects is just spoken until it is promoted to the ellite status usually for political purposes. Simply we can say , dialect is a particular form of a language which is peculiar to a particular region or a social group. Dialect is a regional variation of a language .When different regions use different words to describe the same thing thisis dialect.\n\nThere are mainly three languages spoken in Bihar , otherwise there are other dialects spoken in Bihar.\n\nMaithili, Magahi and Bhojpuri are the three main languages,apart from these Angika and Brajika are also spoken in Bihar in most of the places as Maithili , these are the dialects of Maithili which is politically influenced by the time.\n\nMagahi or Magadhi is spoken in the district of Patna, and Gaya. From the time immemorial it is called the language of common people. There is no indegenous written literature , though number of folktales and popular songs tell the history of this language.\n\nBhojpuri is spoken in Bhojpur district, Buxar, Kaimur and Rohtas. It is also spoken in some states of Uttar Pradesh like Varanasi and Gorakhpur .\n\nAngika is spoken in districs like Araria, Katihaar, Bhagalpur\n\nIn Bhagalpur , Munger and east Champaran Maithili is spoken.\n\nTalking about the dialects spoken in Bihar they are : Musase, Sadri , Surajpuri, Kudmali, Panch Pargania , Sarmami, Vajjika\n\nso as we saw there are different languages and dialects spoken in Bihar in different districts.This blog will take you to the Maithili speaking districts and will introduce you about the Maithili language of Bihar.\n\nIntroduction\n\n“If you talk to a man in a language he understands , that goes to his head . If you talk to him in his language , that goes to his heart” – Nelson Mandela\n\nMaithili is an Indo – Aryan language spoken in Darbhanga, Saharsa, Samastipur, Madhubani, Sitamarhi, Purnia, Katihar, Kishanganj, Bhagalpur, Madhepura, some parts of Muzaffarpur, Munger, Khagaria, Sheohar, Araria, Supaul, Shehohar and some parts of Vaishali.\n\nDarbhanga and Madhubani constitute cultural and linguistic centers of Maithili language.\n\nJanakpur in Nepal is an important linguistic center of Maithili.\n\nIt is also spoken in Terai region of Nepal. Maithili is the second most prevalent language of Nepal.\n\nIt is also spoken in some districts of Jharkhand like Ranchi, Bokaro, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad and Deoghar. Maithili received the second official language status of Jharkhand in March 2018.\n\nAccording to the census of Government of India there are in total 13.5 million people at present who authorised their mother tongue as Maithili.\n\nIn 2003, Maithili was included in the 8th schedule of the Indian constitution as a recognized Indian language. Maithili literature is even older than Hindi. Vidayapati is the great name of Maithili Literature. As early as 1324 , Jyotirishwar Thakur wrote a prose work in Maithili. Many monthly magazines publish in Maithili language.\n\nMaithili language is included as an optional paper in the UPSC exam.\n\nHistory\n\nMaithili is the only language of Bihar which has an ancient literary History. Going long back in history Maithili was called the language of common people and Sanskrit was considered as the language of Scholars.\n\nTalking about the history of the Language . The oldest record of Maithii go back to 1771 when Amaduzzi’s preface to Belgatti’s Alphabetum Brammhanicum published.\n\nIn 1880, Hoernle in his book A comparative Grammar of the Gaudian Languages with special reference to Eastern Hindi and treated Maithili as a dialect very close to Bengal.\n\nThen in 1801 Colebrooke in his famous essay on the sanskrit and Prakrit Languages describe Maithili as a different dialect . He also included Maithili’s affinity with Bengali.\n\nIn the year 1875 , Mr. Fallon gave a few few specimens of it in the Indian Antiquary.\n\nIn 1881 , Grierson in his book Introduction to the Maithili Language of North Bihar where he explained all the grammar rules of Maithili . In his book he gave glimpse on the alphabet, pronounciations, , parts of speech . The description however is based heavily upon Maithili forms obtained from by the Pundits, village school masters and educated Native Gentlemen. In next year he published its part 2 of the book in which he included large number of words that is vocabulary .\n\n1893 was the year when Kelly the writer of the time continues to treat Maithili as a dialect of Hindi.\n\nAs per the record , 1958 was the first time when the formation of Maithili language was appeared . He did the most exhaustive diachronic description on Maithili. In it, he has undertaken to trace the history of Maithili from the old Indo – Aryan Period and has laboured assiduously to assign Sanskrit etymologically to practically all forms of Maithili.\n\nThe Royal Nepal Academy published a dictionary of synonyms of 14 languages including Maithili .\n\nOther Informations:\n\nThe dialects of Bihar were legally absorbed under the overreaching lebel Hindi in 1961 census.\n\nHindi was given the official status through the Bihar Official language Act 1950.\n\nHindi was displaced as the sole official language of Bihar in 1981. Generally Hindi is a widely spoken language in Bihar.\n\nHindi is literary language of the state and several renowned and gifted Bihari writers created his literature in Hindi .\n\nDespite the large number of speakers of these [Hindi, Bhojpuri, Magdhi] languages , only Maithili has been consitutionally recognised in India, which gained constitutional status via the 92nd amendment to the constitution of India.\n\nUniversities of Bihar have adopted Maithili as the medium of correspondence . It is also teach in Indian Universities of Kolkata, Bihar, Patna, Bhagalpur, Darbhanga and Varanasi. It is also teach in Tribhuvan University of NEPAL.\n\nAccording to the International P.E.N. [ Poets, Essayists and Novelists] and the Sahitya Akadami [ National Academy of letters ] ,Maithili is the 16th largest language of India.\n\nCinema is supposed to be the vehicle of expression of literature of a language. Cinema is the biggest form of cultural representation. It may say that Cinema is the representation of us on the screen. Cinema is the biggest form of entertainment . It is the weapon which can change the point of view of the society . This is the time when the Cinema is not only limited to the Entertainment , it is going beyond this. It raises the issues of the society, it makes the vision clear towards any topic, it makes us understand the different aspects of any theme. Cinema is more than it appears in front of us. It is the language in which people can connect. There are millions of stories in me , in you and in all of us that are dying to be told. Cinema is the way in which our stories could come in front of the world.\n\nCinema make lives beautiful.\n\nMAITHILI CINEMA\n\nMaithili Cinema is the cinema of Mithila region of India and Nepal in the Maithili language . Maithili language is considered to be the sweetest and the most cultured language. There are 6 – 7 crores people in India and even in abroad too who speak Maithili.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIt was happening for the first time in the history when a Maithili film was nominated for the National Film Award . It was the year 2016 when MITHILA MAKHAAN won the 63rd National Film Award. Mithila Makhaan is the first ever film from Bihar and Jharkhand to get a National Award. Director Nitin Chandra said it was possible because he has always believed in standing by his roots. He is adding more by saying ” more rooted you are, more global you would be”. It is the collective achievement for the Maithili language and the identity. This movie takes Maithili Language Cinema on to a new horizon in terms of Film’s budget , script, cast and cinematography. Its 2nd part has also released in the year 2020.\n\nAchieving a National Award by any regional Film,is not as easy. For this milestone to reach The Maithili Film Industry has to see many hurdles, many unsuccessful nights and many sacrificing faces. Lets come with me in this journey of Maithili Cinema where I will talk about every aspect of Maithil Films.\n\nREGIONAL CINEMA\n\nRegional Cinema is the Cinema of any specific region in its own regional language . There are five dialects of Bihar in which Regional Cinema is being made and those are Bhojpuri, Maithili, Maghi, Vajjika and Angika.\n\nBhojpuri Film Industry , is often mistaken as the only Film Industry in Bihar . But what people don’t know is that there are three other Film Industries too and they are : Maithili , Angika and Maghi . These all three function simultaneously. In these three Industries the Filmmakers of Bihar make films in all five dialects of Bihar.\n\nMaithili Films in those times were mostly made on the lives of POETS and on the happenings in the society. Talking about the issues of making Maithili Films are that, Films don’t get enough exposure as most of the small theatres have shut down in Bihar . And as the Box Office collection for those movies are not enough . Due to the absence of the proper space for Film releases even good Maithili Films don’t reach the audience .\n\nGoing back in the time when the Maithili Film Industry was emerging, that was the time when the Filmmakers were experimenting , soon the Films deviated from local issues and started copying films from the mainstream Bollywood and the South Industry. Thus Cinema from Mithilanchal hardly has an original story. There is also another aspect with the Maithili Films which we can put that in the issue . Most of the people think that the regional Films are made for lower segment of the society. They think these films are not for the sophisticated people.\n\nToday we are in 2020 and Maithili Cinema has completed its fifty years . The Industry is still struggling and aspiring to be a known regional Film Industry in India.\n\nHISTORY OF MAITHILI CINEMA\n\nFirst MaithilI Film was Kanyadaan , which was released in 1965 , directed by Phani Majumdaar . It was not completely in Maithili language , but its significant portion was made in Maithili language. The film’s story revolves around a man , who is the protagonist of the story too who does not know Maithili language , but decided to learn Maithili as his wife knows only this language. This movie is based on Hari mohan Jha’s novel by the same name .\n\nIn the year 1984 – 1985 , another Maithili Film was released Mamta Gaave Geet .

After that most of the films made but in dubbed form, one was Bhauji May . This film was dubbed from Gujarati film. Jai Baba Bijunath , and Ijot were some more movies of the time. The film Ijot means ray of light was produced by famous playback singer Udit Narayan . The songs of the Film were very good, but it flopped because of the bad script.\n\nThe year of 1999, a film made which went a long way in revival of Maithili Film Industries . The name of the film was Sasta Jingi Mahag Sinur . Muarli Dhar , a great director , Music Composer , Singer, Actor was directed this film. Moreover, Balkrishna Jha’s contribution in the film can also not be ruled out. It was the super – duper hit of that time. The songs in the movie were given by Md. Aziz, Sadhana Sargam , Udit Narayan and Deepa Narayan . The series of films were made in this time .Film like Senurak Laaj was also a good film of that time.\n\nThe main agenda of these films were more than entertainment. These films focussed on the daily lives of the natives and present them in the cinematic screen . Most films were based on local isuues like Dowry, Untouchability, Unemployement and Poverty. Some films also made which showed the actual problems of the region related to the environment , related to the government . These films had become the platform where problems were being told and discussed in the society . The films also showed the local culture and traditions .\n\nThe Maithil Films was facing ups and downs and in between all these, a film named Sindurdaan was released in 2007 , but it was quickly withdrawn from the theatres due to some sound problem.\n\nKakhan Harab Dukh Mor . It was a successful Maithili Film based on the life of Maithili Poet Vidyapati.\n\nIn the year 2000 when the world was meeting the new millenium, The Maithili Film Industry was also growing by making more films.

Prasad Chaudhary with music by Gyaneshwar Dubey , is dubbed from Tamil into Maithili with Surya and Divashree in lead roles as actors and Rami Reddy as an antagonist.\n\nIn 2005, Garibak Beti listed in the list of successful Maithili Films. Manoj Jha was the director of the Film and Ajay Yash was the producer.The film was made in low budget and that is why it is considered as the low Budget Maithili success. Manoj Jha is considered as one of the best Filmmakers of Maithili Cinema. 2011 was the year when the films like Suhagin and Khurluchhi came on screen.\n\nDirector Murli Dhar directed Film Sajna ke Anagna me Solah Singaar and Mukhiya Jee was directed by Vikash Jha . In the year 2014 a successful Maithili Film was directed by Niraj Yadav and Randhir Singh and the film was An ideal Lady – Ramaulwali.\n\nIn the year 2019 , Gaamak Ghar was premiered at 21st Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival 2019, becoming the first Maithili Film to be selected for the Festival .

India has been always popular for its culture and traditions and marriage is one of the biggest ceremony of Indians.The bond between a husband and a wife is among the most solemn of human relationship.Wedding is an ausicious occassion and is done by the utmost enthusiasm . It is an extravagent affair between two families which is constituted by a traditional bent of mind. In Mithila it has its own traditions and rituals which has been following from thousands of years. There are many communities in Mithila region and all have there own wedding rituals , but Maithil Brahmims’ wedding is something which is considered as one of the popular among all because of its speciality and pecularity .Inhabitants of Mithila have until today managed to retain ties with their past traditions.\n\nThe major question that come into mind is , why only Maithil Brahmins wedding is special among all? It is because it has a direct connection to Ramayana. It is a belief that Maithil Brahmins’ marriage happens the same way with the same customs and rites as the marriage of Lord Rama and Mata Sita is mentioned in the Ramayana. Mata Sita was the daughter of Raja Janak of Mithila. For her wedding Raja Janak called for a ‘swayambar’ . Lord Rama won her in the ‘swaymbar’ and married her. Songs related to Ram and Sita is sung only. Thus this kind of marriage is exclusive to Mithila only.\n\nSaurath sabha (Bada Gaachhi)\n\nIn the old times, this was a fair of bride- grooms held in the marriage season in the Saurath Village of the Madhubani district of Mithila. All the ‘elligible’ grooms would come to this fair , male members of the bride family would also reach, marriages would be fixed in this fair, and almost immediately carried out. This was something exclusive to the Mithila region which is now not in the tradition.The local folks are trying to revive this tradition .\n\nCustoms of marriages of Maithil Brahmins are very special and peculiar .\n\n🌸 Marriage is not a ‘marriage on day -1 and Vidai on day -2 , period’ kind of ocassion in Maithil Brahmins. It is a four day affairs. Yes and without Chaturthi( 4th day of marriage) is not valid . Groom have to live at Bride’s home for four days , have to do many rituals and then can go with his bride or maybe sometime not with her. Traditionally, Bride does not go to her in law’s house even after chaturthi, that happens only in Dwirangman/Vidai which taken place in some odd year of marriage (1st, 3rd, 5th , 7th) due to early age of boys and girls. Now Dwirangman done soon after Chaturthi usually within 15 days , since within 15 days one need not look for a particular Mahurta – any day is fine.\n\n🌸 For a marriage to take place , the 1st thing to be looked at is’Gotra’. This system is familier to the people of many other Indian communities too. Each Gotra is named after some great Rishi/Monk . People belonging to a particular gotra are supposedly descendents of the Rishi after whom the gotra is named. Hence, people from the same gotra are considered brothers and sisters and cannot be married to each other. So for marriage to be happen the Bride and Groom should have same caste but different gotra.\n\n🌸 There are things like Mool(stocks),Paanti which determine how high your Kul(lineage) is . Now consider this. If it were just the gotra the two families would have different gotra , then only the girl and the boy will marry. And also, there will be no any marriage relationship between these two families for seven generations. It means for the marriage to take place tjere should be no marriage affair between tjese two families for seven generations. So , after gotra is sorted out, family tree of past seven generations is matched to see that the intended bride and groom are not in any relation, where marriage should be prohibited . This process is called sidhananta . No family maintains its family tree. It is done by some people who are into this profession and maintaining family trees. They are called Panjiyaar. That is why they say There is only one person made for you!Not many people can possibly pass all these tests . Talking about these traditions following now, then yes some of them are not followed by those who have setteled somewhere else but those who are stills live in Mithila follows all the traditions till now.\n\nIt is a belief that Kanyadaan or the gift of a girl in marriage is equal to a gift to a God. Wedding is a grand affair in the Maithil Brahmin caste. Having their own cultural and social traditions , the marriage ceremonies involve several steps or rituals that start from the pre-wedding period and extend till the post wedding period. The number of rites, traditions and rituals are perform on the wedding day in which involvement of the both families can be seen.\n\nRituals and Rites\n\nDay before wedding day (Bride’s place)\n\n🌸Mandappachadan/ Marhwa(settling of the Mandap / wedding alter)\n\nSet up with bamboos and decorated with banana trees and mango leaves in the courtyard one day before martiage at the Bride’s place.\n\n🌸Day Time: Bunch of married women gathered at to be bride’s place for singing the local songs of Lord Shiva, Lord Hanuman, Goddess Durga and songs referring to Brahmins.
