Excerpt: Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar' ( '') (September 23, 1908 April 24, 1974) was an Indian Hindi poet, essayist and academician, who is considered as one of the most important modern Hindi poets. Dinkar emerged as a rebellious poet with his nationalist poetry in pre-Independence days. His poetry exuded veer rasa, and he has been hailed as a Rashtrakavi (\"National poet\") evoking the spirit of nationalism on account of his inspiring patriotic composition. As a mark of respect for him, his portrait was unveiled in the Central Hall of Parliament of India by the Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh on his centenary year, 2008. Dinkar initially supported the revolutionary movement during the Indian Independence struggle, but later became a Gandhian.He was close to the prominent nationalists of the time like Rajendra Prasad,Anugrah Narayan Sinha\n\nBooks LLC is a reprint publisher of nonfiction and fiction which is out of copyright.
