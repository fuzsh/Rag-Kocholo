        "text": "You‚Äôre probably looking for a day of the week calculator. Chances are you have a date in mind and you want to find out what day of the week it was. You‚Äôre in luck! This nifty little website will help you solve your problem. Let‚Äôs face it, it‚Äôs not easy to find an old calendar just to find out what day of the week a particular day is.\n\nIt‚Äôs also possible that you might be asking the question: ‚ÄúWhat day of the week was I born?‚Äù Whatever your reason is, you‚Äôll get the days of the week you are looking for.\n\nAs an added bonus, this website utilizes pages from Wikipedia to extract historical events and birthday of popular individuals. This is useful if you‚Äôre creating a scrapbook and you want to know some important events that took place about a particular day.\n\nThis website is using the Gregorian calendar system as the basis for computing the day of the week. Dates before 1752 in some European countries were recorded as a Julian calendar date such as the one engraved in the above picture of a church tower in Salisbury, a city in England. (Photo credit: Alan Clarke) Just for fun. Try entering the date you see in the above picture and verify the day of the week.\n\nHere are some interesting facts about the Julian and Gregorian calendars. When the Calendar Act was implemented in Britain, on September 2, 1752 the Britons slept using the old Julian calendar and woke up the following morning using the Gregorian calendar but it suddenly became September 14, 1752. They skipped 11 days overnight. Some neighboring countries made the switch to Gregorian calendar a few centuries earlier while others a few centuries later. For example, the Russians only adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1918. The Greeks did not switch to it until 1923 and they have to skip 13 days instead of just 11 days.\n\nNow, let us begin with today‚Äôs date. You may also enter a specific day using the form on the top bar. The year is optional and this website will use the current year if it is not given. All date and time computations are based on the server‚Äôs current date and time which is Tuesday, August 27, 2024 03:45:15 AM UTC.\n\nAugust 27: Day of the Week\n\nAugust 27, 2024 is the 240th day of the year 2024 in the Gregorian calendar. There are 126 days remaining until the end of the year.

You can also browse the full year monthly calendar.\n\nZodiac & Birthstone\n\nVirgo is the zodiac sign of a person born on this day. Peridot is the modern birthstone for this month.
