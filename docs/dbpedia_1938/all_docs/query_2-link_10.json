When the person become a personality , it reflects the essence of the place. Nationalist, writers, poets, artists, musicians, theater artist, all have their fair share of contribution to the place.\n\nHere is a constantly edited list of famous maithils/maithilanis whom you should be familiar with as you engage here. If you have more suggestions, please leave them in the comments below.\n\n1. King Janaka - The Rishi King of Mithila\n\nKing Janaka (राजा जनक, Raja Janak) was king of Mithila (Videha) and the adoptive father of Sita, the key character of the Hindu epic Ramayana. Janak’s name was Seeradhwaja. He was regarded as an enlightened soul and ruled his kingdom with wisdom and courage.\n\nJanaka was an ancient Indian king of Videha which was located in Mithila region, approximately in the 8th or 7th century BCE. The rulers of the Videha kingdom were called Janakas. He also appears in epic Ramayana as father of Sita. His original name was Seeradhwaja[citation needed] and he had a brother named Kushadhwaja. His father name was Hroshhoroma. King Nimi was the first ruler of Videha kingdom. Then king Mithi, supposed the name Mithila came after him. His son king Janaka(1st), he was the first janaka. Then after three successor came king Devraat and after Devraat the 15th successor was Hroshhoroma.\n\nJanaka is revered as being an ideal example of non-attachment to material possessions. He was intensely interested in spiritual discourse and considered himself free from worldly illusions. His interactions with sages and seekers such as Ashtavakra and Sulabha are recorded in ancient texts. His relationship with adopted daughter Sita led her to be called Janaki Mata. The city of Janakpur is named for him and daughter Sita. The Videha (or Mithila) kingdom was located between east of Gandaki River, west of Mahananda River, north of Ganga river and south of Himalayas.\n\n2.

She was the ideal daughter to her parents, ideal wife to her husband, Rama, and the ideal mother to her twins, Luv and Kush.\n\nDevi Sita had to undergo a lot of trials and tribulations in her marital life and it was her courage, chastity and adherence to Dharma (righteousness) that finally made her emerge the ultimate winner.
