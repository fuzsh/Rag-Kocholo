        "text": "Acharya Ramlochan Saran Biography\n\nAcharya Ramlochan Saran was a Hindi littérateur, grammarian and publisher. He founded the publishing house Pustak Bhandar in Laheriasarai and Patna in 1915, which made Laheriasarai a prominent hub in Indian publishing, which employed 500 local people also. Those employees were trained by none other than Saran. Through his publishing houses, he encouraged many Indian writers like Ramavriksha Benipuri, Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar', Acharya Shivapujan Sahay and many more. Later in 1929 the publishing house was completely shifted to Patna. Balak magazine (1926-1986), Himalaya (1946-1948) and Honhar (Hindi and Urdu) (1939) are the noted magazines started by him. He also guided the noted artist Upendra Maharthi over a decade. His publishing house also published a few works of Mahatma Gandhi in Hindi and Gujarati languages.\n\nHe was born in Sitamarhi Bihar of British India on 11 February 1889. He started his publishing house Pustak Bhandar in Laheriasarai and Patna in 1915 whose sole aim was to encourage budding writers, particularly those young writers from Bihar. Later the publishing house gave Laheriasarai a significant place in the publishing map of the world. Through his editing he standardized Hindi language. Ramacharitamanasa by Tulsidas, Tolstoy and Gandhi by Dr. Kali Das Nag and ‘Some Eminent Bihar Cotemporaries’ by Sachidanand Sinha are among his famous published books.\n\nHe published Maithili language books in Mithilakshar script, the first Indian publisher to do so.
