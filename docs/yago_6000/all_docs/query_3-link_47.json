        "text": "In the realm of Beatles lore, Stu Sutcliffe is the man who got away. He was the Liverpool art student who exerted a strong stylistic influence over his best friend, John Lennon, and turned his back on Lennon's band just as that band reached the threshold of fame. Sutcliffe preferred to pursue a career as an Abstract Expressionist painter and to live in Hamburg with his German girlfriend, Astrid Kirchherr. Ms. Kirchherr, then celebrated for her bohemian style, is now the guiding force behind \"Backbeat,\" an evocative new Sutcliffe-centric account of the Beatles' early history.\n\n\"Backbeat,\" directed by Iain Softley, is lively, galvanizing and unexpectedly well made, a far cry from the Madame Tussaud approach often used to enshrine contemporary celebrities. But it also has the whiff of the authorized version, which brings it more than a touch of smugness. After all, it's possible to view Sutcliffe's drifting away from the Beatles as an act of extremely shortsighted folly. But \"Backbeat\" celebrates his lofty rejection of rock music in favor of more serious art. It also sees a grand act of abdication in Sutcliffe's decision to be with the woman he loved.\n\nThis sort of myth making can be strenuous. \"With or without the Beatles, he satisfies every requirement of a doomed pop hero,\" write Alan Clayson and Pauline Sutcliffe (Stu's sister) in their biography, \"The Lost Beatle.\" \"Gilding the aura of fated youth are dark glasses shielding restless eyes; prominent cheekbones in an ashen complexion; the slouch; the kismet supercool; the brooding intensity, and to round it off, the 'beautiful sadness' of an early death.\" True, Sutcliffe was admired for having a look reminiscent of James Dean's, and Ms. Kirchherr is credited with having talked the Beatles into the mop-top hairdo. But beyond that the Sutcliffe mystique has never succeeded in striking much of a chord.\n\n\"Backbeat\" tries to correct that with hip revisionism, the kind that will work best for viewers born after the Beatles' heyday. It presents these young musicians as pre-punk nihilists, concentrating on the raunchy Hamburg interludes that helped solidify their hard-rocking style. Although it underscores the Sutcliffe factor, all its energy comes from John Lennon, who is presented as bristling and self-destructive in ways that would light a fire under any rock band. John is also conveniently romantic, saying of Astrid: \"I might have fallen in love with her, but she fell in love with me best friend and that was the end of that.\"\n\nJohn is played furiously well by Ian Hart (who actually looks a lot more like Julian Lennon, John's son). And Mr. Hart improves forcefully upon his strong earlier performance as John in \"The Hours and Times.\" Each of these films (the other was about John and Brian Epstein, the Beatles' manager) gave John the kind of homoerotic longings best hinted at when the principal is no longer able to sue. The character is confused, but Mr. Hart's raging, bitterly funny John is a still welcome contrast to Stephen Dorff's Stu, who is all self-important attitude and dark glasses.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Dorff has the hard job of keeping a straight face while being told: \"We're gonna be big, you know. You'll miss it, Stu. You're gonna kick yourself.\" Luckily, only when \"Backbeat\" resorts to such fateful-sounding dialogue does it really ring false. For the most part, Mr. Softley (who wrote the film with Michael Thomas and Stephen Ward) has done a fond, imaginative job of summoning the try-anything atmosphere in which the Beatles' style was born. You need not recognize the Reeperbahn, the Cavern Club or any of the other sites painstakingly re-created here to find in \"Backbeat\" a colorful chapter in pop music history.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
