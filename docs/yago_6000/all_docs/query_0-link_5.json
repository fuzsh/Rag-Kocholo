        "text": "Backbeat is the story of the once but not future Beatle, painter Stuart Sutcliffe (Stephen Dorff). But mostly it's a Beatles coming of age story as the band came of age in Hamburg, Germany before exploding worldwide a few years later. Cynically, it's an early test of the waters for how many different shades of Beatlemania movies one might be able to get out of the Beatles without having to do a full blown biopic. It's a handsome paint-by-the-numbers little pic that's slightly enhanced by showing John Lennon's (played by Ian Hart) friendship with Sutcliffe as being close to borderline obsessive, as the two talk while they have sex in the same room, Lennon gets jealous of Sutcliffe's German girlfriend…\n\nThere are a lot of factual innacuracies and also some not-so-accurate portrayals in this but it's still an enjoyable film.\n\nApparently, Paul McCartney and George Harrison were less than impressed with the film, and in fairness, probably with good reason. I'm sure Pete Best probably wasn't best pleased either. John aside, not much focus is placed on The Beatles themselves and their characters are pretty threadbare. Paul is shown as someone who was bitter about Stuart's presence and focused only on becoming famous while George and Pete are practical non-entities.\n\nJohn, meanwhile, is portrayed as a talented though entirely angry young prick with few redeeming qualities. Ian Hart plays John, a role he's played on at least two other occasions…"
