A low flat rate for the rest of the world.\n\nSize: 69 cm x 102 cm (27 in x 40 in)\n\nA guaranteed original one sheet movie poster from 1994 for Iain Softley's rock and roll biographical movie \"BackBeat\", with Ian Hart, Gary Bakewell, Chris O'Neill and Paul Duckworth as the young fab four.\n\nAcclaimed for capturing the style of the early 1960's, the film finds The Beatles working in Hamburg, where their bassist Stuart Sutcliffe (played fantastically by Stephen Dorff) meets and falls in love with photographer Astrid Kirchherr, before leaving the group to pursue a promising career as an artist and dying, tragically, at the tender age of 21.\n\nSutcliffe's photo would appear amongst the many famous faces on the cover of The Beatles' 'Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' album.\n\nThis single-sided one sheet movie poster has never been folded and as out photos show, is in super condition. A fantastic poster for any lover of The Beatles.\n\nWe only sell guaranteed original movie posters. We do not sell reproductions."
