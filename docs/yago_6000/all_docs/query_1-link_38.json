        "text": "Click here for Boxing Day to New Year's Day\n\nSATURDAY 19 DECEMBER\n\nInkheart (2008)\n\nSky Movies Premiere/SMPHD, 11.50am ***\n\nDelightful, effects-heavy fantasy adventure directed by Iain Softley (Backbeat). The film, which features great British stars such as Helen Mirren and Jim Broadbent, is adapted from a tale by German children’s author Cornelia Funke, and tells of a book restorer (Brendan Fraser) who can bring literary characters literally to life when he reads aloud. However, his skill comes at a price when his wife ends up imprisoned in a book called Inkheart.\n\nBlade Runner: the Final Cut (1982)\n\nBBC Two, 9.00pm *****\n\nA darkly sublime masterpiece of sci-fi by Ridley Scott, inspired by Philip K Dick’s vision of a dystopian LA in 2019. Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a policeman who must hunt down a band of rogue “replicants” – fierce, but strangely noble, human-like androids. This is the “final cut” of 2007, which comes with Scott’s complete approval (other cuts haven’t).\n\nLove Actually (2003)\n\nITV1, 9.00pm ***\n\nRichard Curtis’s winsome romcom seems to be becoming a Christmas staple. Featuring a host of Britain’s favourite actors including Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman and Bill Nighy, it delves into the personal lives of 10 very different individuals whose lives become loosely entangled in the run-up to the holiday.\n\nKing Kong (2005)\n\nITV2, 10.00pm ****\n\nPeter Jackson brings the 1933 classic back to the screen with monstrous power. It tells the story of the brash Carl Denham (Jack Black) who travels to a mysterious island with a writer, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), and a starlet Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts). There they encounter murderous natives, dinosaurs and the great ape itself. The film’s strength is matched by its wit, and the 25ft Kong is a terrific creation (a CGI-enhanced Andy Serkis).\n\nRussian Ark (2002)\n\nBBC Four, 11.30pm ****\n\nThis remarkable film (it features 2,000 actors and extras) is part historical reflection and part museum tour comprising a single 96-minute Steadicam shot which takes us through the world’s largest museum, the Hermitage in St Petersburg. The unseen film-maker (Alexsandr Sokurov) and an unnamed 19th-century French diplomat act as guides through a meditation on the Russian psyche. In Russian with subtitles.\n\nSUNDAY 20 DECEMBER\n\nTim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)\n\nBBC Two, 11.30am ****\n\nFor those who prefer their festive films to come without a side of schmaltz. Tim Burton’s story (directed by Henry Selick) mixes dark surrealism with beautiful stop-motion animation and haunting music by Danny Elfman. When Jack Skellington (voiced by Chris Sarandon), the king of Halloween Town, stumbles across Christmas Town, he decides that he wants to be Santa instead.\n\nMatilda (1996)\n\nFive, 3.30pm ***\n\nNearly as saccharine as the giant chocolate cake devoured by one of the story’s heroes, this adaptation of Roald Dahl’s classic still has charm in abundance. It stars Mara Wilson (Mrs Doubtfire, Miracle on 34th Street) as the eponymous Matilda, a child genius who overcomes some horrendous parenting (Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman) and a sadistic headmaster (Pam Ferris) to realise her true potential.\n\nThe Family Man (2000)\n\nChannel 4, 8.00pm **\n\nIt’s not up there with It’s a Wonderful Life (what is?), but this pleasant Christmas romcom tries to hit the same emotional spots. It’s about an unmarried workaholic (Nicolas Cage) who learns how his life might have turned out differently. One night he goes to bed as normal, a lonely exec; next day, magically, he wakes to find he’s married with children.\n\nMONDAY 21 DECEMBER\n\nThe Ten Commandments (1956)\n\nChannel 4, 12.05pm ****\n\nThe final film made by the celebrated producer/director Cecil B DeMille eschews subtlety in favour of epic set-pieces and dramatic storytelling. Charlton Heston, never one to turn down a thunderous lead role, plays Moses in the story of the prophet’s life. Highlights include the pleasingly OTT dialogue (e.g. Anne Baxter’s Nefertiti: “Oh, Moses, Moses, you splendid, stubborn, adorable fool”) and, of course, the parting of the Red Sea.\n\nThe Muppet Christmas Carol (1992)\n\nFive, 4.25pm ***\n\nMichael Caine stars as Ebenezer Scrooge in thischild-friendly, Muppet-packed, musical adaptation of Charles Dickens’s festive masterpiece. Kermit heads the puppet cast as Bob Cratchit. One wonders what Dickens would have made of being portrayed by sausage-nosed “weirdo” Gonzo the Great.\n\nGremlins (1984)\n\nITV2, 9.00pm ***\n\nAn enjoyably boisterous if sometimes grisly horror comedy that should make older children coo (at the furry, cuddly-looking Mogwai creatures) and shriek (at the hideous scaly Gremlins). For Christmas, a father buys his son (Zach Galligan) a pet: a cute but mysterious little beast, which must never be fed after midnight – or very nasty things will happen.\n\nFrost/Nixon (2008)\n\nSky Movies Premiere/SMPHD, 10.00pm *****\n\nMichael Sheen, as smarmy interviewer David Frost, and Frank Langella, as disgraced ex-president Richard Nixon, reprise their roles from a gripping play by Peter Morgan, who also wrote the screenplay. The main action, in which Frost/Nixon battle to nhance/rescue their reputations during a series of intense TV interviews (Nixon’s first since Watergate), is based on real events but would still be unmissable if you’d never heard of either man.\n\nGangs of New York (2002)\n\nFilm4, 10.45pm ****\n\nMartin Scorsese’s grand 19th-century epic tempted Method master Daniel Day-Lewis out of retirement and introduced Scorsese to his new favourite actor – Leonardo DiCaprio, whom he has cast in four more films since. DiCaprio plays Amsterdam Vallon, who returns to New York to avenge the death of his Irish immigrant father by killing Day-Lewis’s brutally scary Bill the Butcher. But Vallon is soon sucked into the city’s gang culture.\n\nTUESDAY 22 DECEMBER\n\nDick Tracy (1990)\n\nChannel 4, 11.55am ***\n\nWarren Beatty directed and starred in this visually perfect adaptation of Chester Gould’s comic strip, and Madonna performed the Sondheim soundtrack. That, surely, should ensure a superb film? Not quite, because the characters never entirely gel, and the action and the comedy sit uneasily together. But with supporting performances from Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino, this is still an enjoyable enough drama.\n\nAirplane! (1980)\n\nSky Movies Modern Greats/SMMGHD, 6.25pm *****\n\nThis ecstatically funny comedy, a pastiche of disaster movies, stars Robert Hays as a passenger called on to fly a plane after its pilots are taken ill mid-flight. More importantly, it features Leslie Nielsen (who would later perform similarly glorious roles in Police Squad! and the Naked Gun films) as a deliciously deadpan doctor. “Surely there must be something you can do.” “I’m doing everything I can – and stop calling me Shirley.”\n\nLemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004)\n\nBBC Three, 8.25pm **\n\nStarring Jim Carrey, this adaptation of Daniel Handler’s books about the misadventures of three children was long-awaited. Handler’s style is to use laconic asides from narrator Lemony Snicket (Jude Law), but on screen it doesn’t quite work. Despite this disappointment, it’s a fabulously gothic vision.\n\nBasic Instinct (1992)\n\nITV1, 10.35pm; not Ulster/STV **\n\nA trashy but titillating cat-and-mouse thriller made famous by some rather risqué scenes between its two stars, Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas. Directed by Paul Verhoeven (Starship Troopers), the film follows a rugged cop (Douglas) on the trail of a serial killer whose weapon of choice is an ice pick. Stone plays the prime suspect, a stoic, sexually charged novelist who sets her sights on seducing Douglas’s character.\n\nYes Man (2008)\n\nSky Movies Premiere/SMPHD, 10.10pm ***\n\nThis comedy is based on Danny Wallace’s memoir and sees Jim Carrey return to his gimmicky comfort zone. Carrey stars as Carl, a bank worker who accepts a challenge to say yes to everything. This leads Carl into a host of madcap situations, including a gross-out sexual encounter with his elderly neighbour before he finds true happiness with Allison (Zooey Deschanel).\n\nWEDNESDAY 23 DECEMBER\n\nCinderella (1965)\n\nBBC Two, 9.50am ***\n\nGinger Rogers features (as the Queen) in this sweet version of the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical. Lesley Ann Warren makes a lovely Cinders, Stuart Damon a tender prince. Curious fact: Cinderella’s ball gown was so heavy that, after a long day’s shooting, Warren’s shoulders seized up and had to be injected with a muscle relaxant.\n\nJames and the Giant Peach (1996)\n\nChannel 4, 12.05pm ***\n\nCombining live action with stop-motion animation, this retelling of Roald Dahl’s sumptuous tale stars Joanna Lumley and features the voices of Susan Sarandon and Richard Dreyfuss. Its plot is irresistibly bizarre: a recently orphaned boy called James (Paul Terry) embarks on a magical journey when he, quite literally, climbs inside a giant peach and befriends its inhabitants. Includes a musical score by Randy Newman.\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000)\n\nMore4, 10.05pm ****\n\nAng Lee’s Oscar-winning martial arts epic appeals to audiences across the board. Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh star as warriors who subdue their feelings for each other to hunt down a sword with mystic powers. This is beautifully shot and breathtaking to watch, especially the fight scenes.\n\nMulholland Drive (2001)\n\nSky Movies Indie/SMIHD, 11.30pm ***\n\nOriginally meant to be a television series, David Lynch’s film is fascinating and beautiful if frustratingly cryptic. What’s initially clear is that a woman (Laura Elena Harring) loses her memory and is helped by an aspiring actress (Naomi Watts). It then becomes a case of swapped identities and Lynchian trickery with Twin Peaks-like red herrings.\n\nCHRISTMAS EVE\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005)\n\nBBC One, 2.15pm; Wales, 1.15pm ****\n\nThis film version of CS Lewis’s fantasy tale delivers in all the ways it should. The children are adorable (although not as sweet as James McAvoy’s Mr Tumnus); the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) is terrifying; the battle scenes exhilarating. And with a sub-plot about the cheering arrival of Santa Claus in a land where Christmas had been cancelled, it’s perfect for the festive season.\n\nOver the Hedge (2006)\n\nBBC One, 4.25pm; Wales, 3.25pm ***\n\nAn endearing animated adventure about a group of forest creatures that wake up after the winter hibernation to discover humans have moved in next door to them. Apprehension gives way to curiosity and excitement as they discover what the humans have to offer. Featuring the voices of Bruce Willis, Steve Carell and Avril Lavigne, among others.\n\nCorpse Bride (2005)\n\nITV1, 6.00pm ***\n\nAn eerie animated fairy tale from that modern master of the surreal, Tim Burton. Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp) puts a ring on what he thinks is a branch of a tree only to discover it is the bony finger of the bewitched “corpse bride” (Helena Bonham Carter) who whisks him off for some netherworld nuptials. Inventive and engaging.\n\nNight Mail (1936, b/w)\n\nSky Arts 2/SA2HD, 6.35pm *****\n\nThis inspired film, about an overnight London-to-Glasgow postal train, was made as a promotional piece by the General Post Office Film Unit during the British documentary film movement (1926-46) and represented a creative peak for the genre. Its most celebrated sequence features music by Benjamin Britten and the narration of WH Auden’s poem Night Mail over rhythmic montage images of racing train wheels.\n\nGilda (1946, b/w)\n\nBBC Two, 2.10am *****\n\nOf all the noir women in all the noir films, none betters hair-flicking siren Rita Hayworth in this sexy and atmospheric tale of the ultimate femme fatale. The film is narrated by a gambler (Glenn Ford) who is hired by a casino owner (George Macready) to keep an eye on his wife (Hayworth). Stirring up the sexual tension, the vampish Hayworth puts in a blistering performance, most notably as she temptingly slips off a glove to Put the Blame on Mame.\n\nCHRISTMAS DAY\n\nThe Incredibles (2004)\n\nBBC One, 3.10pm *****\n\nBob Parr (Craig T Nelson) is a disaffected loss adjuster, but he used to be incredible. Mr Incredible, no less. Sadly Parr and his superheroic family have been forced to conceal their powers in suburbia. Now Parr is summoned to a mysterious island for a mission that sends his family back into action in this warm, witty, brilliantly animated adventure that is right up there with Pixar classics Finding Nemo and Toy Story 2.\n\nHappy Feet (2006)\n\nITV1, 3.40pm ***\n\nAustralian director George Miller won a Best Animated Feature Oscar for this entertaining believe-in-yourself animation. Mumble, a misfit emperor penguin (baby voice by Elizabeth Daily, adult voice by Elijah Wood) is causing his parents concern because he can’t sing and is therefore unable to attract a mate. Mumble can tap-dance, though, and therein lies his salvation. The voice cast also includes Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman.\n\nCitizen Kane (1941)\n\nBBC Four, 7.00pm *****\n\nOrson Welles was only 25 when he directed, starred in and produced this spellbinding film, and it’s considered by many to be one of the greatest ever made for its experimental innovations in editing, photography and sound. When an eccentric media mogul (Welles) utters “rosebud” as his last word, a reporter (Joseph Cotten) tries to find out why.\n\nBilly Elliot (2000)\n\nBBC Three, 9.00pm ****\n\nTheatre director Stephen Daldry makes his film debut with this stirring British drama set during the 1984 miners’ strike. Combining realism with uplifting sentiment, the film follows 11-year-old Billy (a Bafta-winning Jamie Bell), who is encouraged by a chain-smoking dance instructor (Julie Walters) to take up ballet. His reactionary father (Gary Lewis), struggling to raise his motherless son, is less keen on the idea. Effortlessly charming.\n\nGladiator (2000)\n\nITV1, 11.15pm ****\n\nThis modern take on the traditional swords-and-sandals epic proved that Russell Crowe deserved to be recognised as a mainstream star, and reaffirmed Ridley Scott’s reputation as a first-rate director. Crowe is Maximus, a former Roman general who rebuilds his career as a gladiator. His bid for vengeance against a vile emperor is compelling."
