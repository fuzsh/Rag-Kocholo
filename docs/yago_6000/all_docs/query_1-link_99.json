        "text": "Bringing Up Baby\n\nBBC2, Saturday, 1.45pm\n\nThere just isn't a bad word to say about Howard Hawks's enchanting screwball comedy. How could there be, given the presence of a charmingly hapless Cary Grant, an elegantly skittish Katharine Hepburn, a runaway leopard named Baby and some of the funniest rapid-fire repartee ever committed to film?\n\nGrant plays David, a timid palaeontologist with little experience of passion, chaos, or big cats; she's madcap socialite Susan, who gives him a crash course in all three. Smitten with David, but aware that he's about to get married to his bluestocking museum assistant (Virginia Walker), Susan employs a series of bizarre schemes to keep him by her side. This entails pursuing the aforementioned lost feline, striving to reclaim a lost dinosaur bone, getting arrested, and dressing up in a lady's nightgown (an episode that inspired, intriguingly, the first modern usage of the word ''gay'' in a movie).\n\nA box office failure at the time (it got Hawks sacked from RKO), Bringing Up Baby has since been rightfully embraced as a classic of its genre. What's striking to the contemporary viewer is how anarchic and fluid it is. Grant and Hepburn are so spontaneous that it's easy to believe that they have no idea what catastrophe is going to befall them next. The dialogue sparkles and the romance is all loopy charm.\n\nCancel any outstanding appointments, because watching this film is pretty much the most fun you can have within the parameters of the law. (1938)\n\nSaturday\n\nThe Magnificent Seven\n\nChannel 4, 7.35pm\n\nJohn Sturges's remake of Akira Kurosawa's classic The Seven Samurai may not have extended the vocabulary of the Western very far, but it is well loved nonetheless. A Mexican town beset by bandits hires seven hip young gunslingers to send the baddies on their way, once and for all. The cast includes a gaggle of leathery Sixties icons-in-the-making - Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson and Robert Vaughn. And then there's that stirring theme by Elmer Bernstein. (1960)\n\nWings of the Dove\n\nBBC2, 9.10pm\n\nA bleak, beautiful addition to the canon of Henry James adaptations, directed by Iain Softley (who also made the lovely Backbeat and the less lovely\n\nK-Pax). Kate Croy (Helena Bonham Carter) is in love, but her suitor Merton (Linus Roache) isn't rich enough to please her family. With the arrival of a beautiful American heiress (Alison Elliot), motives become distinctly mixed, and an ambiguous love triangle ensues. Roache is good enough to make you glad that original choice Ralph Fiennes couldn't make it, and Bonham Carter's stunning performance as the shady, complex heroine started her decisive move into edgier, sexier territory. First class. (1997)\n\nCourage Under Fire\n\nBBC1, 9.15pm\n\nDid deceased Gulf War heroine Karen Walden (Meg Ryan) deserve her posthumous medal of honour - the first ever awarded to a woman? Superior officer Denzel\n\nWashington examines the facts, troubled not only by conflicting reports in Walden's case, but by his own guilt over a fatal bungle of his own. Lou Diamond Philips and Matt Damon co-star in an ambitious attempt to take on the murky morality of war, inevitably compromised by its star vehicle status. (1996)\n\nMars Attacks\n\nITV, 10.35pm\n\nLavish but little-praised sci-fi spoof, from the lesser end of the patchy Tim Burton canon. Jack Nicholson, playing the US President, heads an all-star cast that also includes Glenn Close, Michael J Fox, Danny DeVito, Pierce Brosnan and Sarah Jessica Parker. They're among the hordes who must save Earth when excitable Martians decide to have some destructive fun with their planet. Under-plotted and too expensive, but with plenty of Burton's maniacal energy and idiosyncratic vision. (1996)\n\nSwimming with Sharks\n\nChannel 5, 10.50pm\n\nEvil-minded black comedy, starring Kevin Spacey as an utterly obnoxious big-shot producer who vents his not inconsiderable rage on his inexperienced young assistant Guy (Frank Whaley). Matters progress until Guy cracks under the pressure and takes vicious revenge on his abuser. Writer/director George Huang was a minion at Columbia before he made this, so the fierce attack on Hollywood ethics comes from bitter experience. (1994)\n\nGeorgy Girl\n\nChannel 4, 2.40am\n\nPure kitsch, very much of its time and possessed of more historical interest than artistic merit. Lynne Redgrave stars as a dance teacher caught between a lascivious middle-aged employer (James Mason), and all the hectic demands of Swinging London, personified by her glamorous flatmate (Charlotte Rampling). Alan Bates co-stars. (1966)\n\nSunday\n\nBlue Steel\n\nChannel 4, 11.05pm\n\nFrom its opening scenes - loving, close-up shots of cop Jamie Lee Curtis donning uniform, belt, badge and gun - Kathryn Bigelow's film seeks to anatomise the relationship between women, violence and power. It's no dry piece of feminist theory, however - it takes the form of a wholly conventional thriller. Curtis plays Megan, a rookie who gets into serious trouble on her first day of active service and then finds herself the plaything of a smooth psychopath (Ron Silver). (1990)\n\nMonday\n\nJane Eyre\n\nBBC2, 1.10pm\n\nFranco Zeffirelli's version of the Charlotte Bronte novel draws most of its strength from a varied and sophisticated cast, including Anna Paquin as little Jane, Charlotte Gainsbourg as the grown-up incarnation, William Hurt as Mr Rochester and Billie Whitelaw as poor old Grace Poole. Elegantly photographed,\n\nif a little bloodless in its\n\nearnest evocation of Victorian repression. (1995)\n\nThe Birdman of Alcatraz\n\nChannel 4, 3.05am\n\nSentenced to life in solitary confinement for two murders, Alcatraz inmate Robert Stroud (Burt Lancaster) finds solace raising and selling birds, eventually becoming a renowned expert. Worthy but powerful\n\nfact-based drama, co-starring Telly Savalas and Thelma Ritter - and directed by John Frankenheimer, who died recently. (1961)\n\nWednesday\n\nFirst Blood\n\nChannel 5, 10pm\n\nGet your headband on and prepare to sweat. Sylvester Stallone plays John Rambo, a Vietnam veteran with a few issues around authority and violence. While travelling around visiting old war buddies, he's hassled by a smalltown sheriff, and it brings back bad memories, sending him on a psychotic rampage. Somewhat crude effort to portray the marginalisation of Vietnam survivors. (1982)\n\nFriday\n\nSpanking the Monkey\n\nBBC2, 1.20am\n\nDirector David O Russell, recently feted for the Gulf War satire Three Kings, made his first big splash with this distinctly icky domestic drama. Marketed as a black comedy, it's relentless in its bleakness - think Todd Solondz on a particularly misanthropic day. Jeremy Davies stars as a troubled teenager charged with taking care of his mother over the summer holidays. She's got a broken leg, but that's the least of her worries, judging by her strange interest in her son. (1994)\n\nThe Omega Man\n\nChannel 5, 2.35am\n\nCharlton Heston plays the last man on earth (as in, ''I wouldn't give the time of day to that gun-crazy right-wing ratbag Charlton Heston even if he was the last man on earth'') in Boris Sagal's adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic sci-fi novel I Am Legend. A plague has destroyed the rest\n\nof humankind, but it has left a\n\nfew homicidal albino mutant monsters behind just to keep things interesting. As the last representative of the old human order, Heston is marked for death, and must enlist all the scientific ingenuity of his annihilated race. (1971)\n\nNineteen Eighty-Four\n\nChannel 4, 2.45am\n\nMemorably atmospheric adaptation of George Orwell's visionary novel, directed by Michael Radford (Il Postino). John Hurt stars as the brutalised thought-criminal Winston Smith; Suzanna Hamilton plays Julia,\n\nthe girl whose love forces him to question the regimented dystopia in which he lives. Radford employs a stunningly effective retro-futuristic mise en scene, reflecting Orwell's own\n\nwar-ravaged 1940s milieu. Also stars Richard Burton, Cyril Cusack and Phyllis Logan. (1984)"
