        "text": "Scot was born in Liverpool in 1972, (in the very hospital in which John Lennon had been Born, 32 years previous). He grew up in the PENNY LANE area of the City, just two streets away from where Lennon had once lived and attended the same School that Paul McCartney had attended several years earlier.\n\nAt the age of 18, (whilst in Czechoslovakia performing Shakespeare’s A MIDSUMMER NIGHTS DREAM with The Liverpool Playhouse), he wrote his first stage play, GROWING YOUNG. The Liverpool Playhouse selected the play to go into production and in 1992 it was staged under the direction of Scot to great critical acclaim. (See Press)\n\nAt aged just 19, Scot was represented by the respected literary agent Alan Brodie and encouraged to write. What followed was five full length stage plays, THE HERD OF BRUTES, GET ANOTHER LOVER MOTHER, THE PLASTIC DAFT, LEVEL MINUS 99 and HUGGERMUGGER, three of which where produced at The Liverpool Playhouse and Unity Theatres between 1992 and 1995, earning him nominations in both the BEST NEW THEATRE TALENT and BEST NEW TALENT IN LITERATURE categories at the Liverpool Echo and Daily Post arts awards.\n\n(Further nominations in the BEST ACTOR and BEST CONTRIBUTION TO FILM categories, makes Scot the only person to ever receive nominations in FOUR different categories at these awards).\n\nIt was during this time, that Scot was cast (alongside fellow Writer Chris O’Neill) in the 1994 Beatles Biog Motion Picture BACKBEAT (directed by Iain Softley) in the Role of original drummer PETE BEST.\n\nThe BAFTA winning movie was a huge international success and sprung Scot into a successful acting career, a career he has enjoyed ever since. In the years that have followed, he has starred in over a dozen films, Two dozen Television Dramas and played lead roles on both the West End’s prestigious Criterion and Donmar Warehouse theatres.\n\nAmongst Scot’s many credits are:\n\nThe Palm D’or nominated trilogy of films entitled THE TULSE LUPER SUITCASES (written and directed by the legendary film maker Peter Greenaway). The BAFTA award winning drama HILLSBOROUGH; written by BAFTA winner Jimmy McGovern and directed by Emmy Award winner Charles McDougall (Desperate Housewives, Sex In The City). Lead roles in the U.S. movies TEMPESTA alongside Malcolm McDowell and Rutger Hauer (directed by Walt Disney’s great nephew Tim Disney).\n\nBesides Feature Films, Scot has also starred in regular roles in the TV drama’s LIVERPOOL 1 (Alongside Samantha Womack), MERSEYBEAT, NICE GUY EDDIE (With Ricky Thomlinson), and most recently the hugely popular period drama LILIES for The BBC (as Father Melia) and the mysterious CAPEWRATH for Channel 4 and Showtime in The United States, (alongside David Morrissey, Tom Hardy and Felicity Jones).\n\nScot has also guested in some of Britain’s most popular television shows including CASUALTY, HOLBY CITY, NEW TRICKS, HEARTBEAT, WHERE THE HEART IS and MURDER IN MIND. Despite this busy work load, Scot has continued to write; notching up two screenplays THE GUILTY GUESSED and FROM GRACE (the later being optioned by Kasander Films for a possible future movie production).\n\nScot’s brand new stage play DESERTED is due to receive it’s World Premiere this Winter at the Contemporary Urban Centre in Liverpool."
