        "text": "Coal Miner's Daughter (Michael Apted, 1980)\n\nThe most maudlin country songs pale when set against the life of one of the genre's biggest stars, Loretta Lynn. Married at 13 and the mother of four by the time she was 20, Lynn not only sung the songs of woe and lost love, she lived them. Apted brilliantly unpacks her rags to riches tale with stunning performances from Sissy Spacek (for which she won an Oscar) and Tommy Lee Jones as husband Doolittle.\n\nShine (Scott Hicks, 1996)\n\nThe Australian piano prodigy David Helfgott's traumatic early life and subsequent breakdown are painfully portrayed by Geoffrey Rush, who won the best actor Oscar for his role. Unlike many biopics, Shine's strengths lie not simply in the musical recognition factor or the international fame of the artist, but in the pure human drama that effortlessly unfolds under Hicks's careful direction.\n\nRay (Taylor Hackford, 2004)\n\nJamie Foxx pulls off a head-swaying sunglasses-wearing facsimile in Taylor Hackford's film of the life of soul singer and American icon Ray Charles. Charles fought against racism and blindness to reshape American popular music in the Fifties and Sixties and it's this combination of social setting and brilliant musicianship that Hackford deftly captures. Foxx shows just what it was that fans went crazy for in Charles and his increasingly hard-living, womanising ways.\n\nIn OMM's review of the movie, published in November 2004, Charles Shaar Murray wrote: 'Foxx achieves such uncanny verisimilitude that, throughout Ray, I had to keep reminding myself that I was watching an actor and not the young Ray Charles. Hackford's movie raises the bar for the entire sub-genre. Anyone attempting such a movie should be aware that Ray is the one to beat.'\n\nBackbeat (Iain Softley, 1994)\n\nStephen Dorff is Stuart 'the fifth Beatle' Sutcliffe during their pre-Beatlemania Hamburg jaunt. Thrown into an intense relationship with local bohemian Astrid Kirchherr, Sutcliffe has to choose the girl or the band. He picks the girl. The gritty soundtrack is played by, among others, Dave Grohl and Thurston Moore.\n\nBound For Glory (Hal Ashby, 1976)\n\nBased on Woody Guthrie's superb autobiography, Ashby's film tells the story of the proto-folk star who set out in the Thirties from his dustbowl town in Texas in search of work and found inspiration in the suffering and strength of America's Depression-era underclass. David Carradine's portrayal of Guthrie carries the film and Ashby conveys perfectly the spirit of the man who shaped American songwriting.\n\nBird (Clint Eastwood, 1988)\n\nCharlie 'Bird' Parker, the troubled, but brilliant, jazz musician, is brought to life by a star performance from Forest Whitaker and exceptional directing from lifelong jazz head Eastwood. During the research for the movie, Eastwood approached Parker's partner Chan Richardson, whose memoirs form the basis of Bird, and she gave the director a stack of long lost recordings, many of which can be heard in the film.\n\nWalk The Line (James Mangold, 2005)\n\nOstensibly a love story, Walk the Line also traces Johnny Cash's heroic story as he battles with drink, drugs and divorce before finding redemption and success with longtime love June Carter. Joaquin Phoenix pulls out all the stops in his portrayal of the man in black, opposite an exceptional performance from Reese Witherspoon, who seamlessly becomes June Carter. And sings!\n\nSid And Nancy (Alex Cox, 1986)\n\nA sort of punk Romeo and Juliet, this is a cautionary tale replayed in many forms since. That great screen shape-shifter Gary Oldman gets under the skin of Sid Vicious in this depiction of the volatile relationship between the Sex Pistols bassist and luckless girlfriend Nancy Spungen. Courtney Love also took a bit part, just eight years before life imitated art (imitating life) when Kurt Cobain shot himself.\n\nAmadeus (Milos Forman, 1984)\n\nForman's lavishly intense life of Mozart won eight Oscars and a host of other plaudits. Tom Hulce in the title role runs away with the film and the music isn't bad either: Formanemployed Sir Neville Mariner and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields. Framing Mozart's life through the story the jealous older composerSalieri, Forman brings to life all the elements of a multifaceted genius.\n\n24 Hour Party People (Michael Winterbottom, 2002)\n\nA celebration of the Manchester scene through the story of Factory impresario Tony Wilson (peerlessly played by Steve Coogan). Winterbottom shot the Hacienda scenes in an almost perfect recreation of the original, which was pulled down in 2000: it was an emotional experience for many of the extras, who had visited the real thing.\n\nRock'n'oll suicide: the five worst films ...\n\nElvis (John Carpenter, 1979)\n\nKurt Russell slips on his blue suede shoes in this risible life of the King. Imagine a wedding singer crossed with an Elvis impersonator and you're close.\n\nLast Days (Gus Van Sant, 2005)\n\nBeautifully filmed, but a mess. Van Sant's Cobain-like central character Blake (Michael Pitt) mumbles his way through a drowsy turn as the doomed rock'n'roll cliche.\n\nDe-Lovely (Irwin Winkler, 2004)\n\nCole Porter deserved better than this. Where Porter's work had wit and razzmatazz, Kevin Kline's interpretation is workaday. Worse, Robbie Williams Sheryl Crow and a host of others indulge in karaoke on the soundtrack.\n\nThe Doors (Oliver Stone, 1991)\n\nStone's experiment in psychedelic film-making is one bad trip. Val Kilmer is a spit for Jim Morrison, even pinning down his vocals perfectly, but it is the bombarding nature of the film that makes it such an epic failure.\n\nStoned (Stephen Woolley, 2005)\n\nThe short life of the Stones's Brian Jones is tragic in a non-classical sense. He doesn't so much burn out gloriously as fade away after some intense drug addiction, which leaves the film lacking in impact."
