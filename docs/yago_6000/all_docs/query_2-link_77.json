        "text": "Hugh Newsam\n\nHugh Newsam and BAL Ami 1958 Juke Box, happy and content at Film Farm 30thÂ April 2022\n\nIâm very sad to report that film editor, filmmaker, film educator, amateur thespian and my very good friend and long-time business partner Hugh Newsam died early this morning, Saturday 14thÂ May. ThisÂ has come as a bit of a shock, because we had a very happy and successful weekend together here only a fortnight ago when Huge (as he is generally known) seemed on excellent form and in good spirits.\n\nHowever, early this morning he was stricken with massive internal pains; an ambulance was called to his Hull home which arrived in reasonable time and he was taken to A&E; he was apparently waiting in an anti-room and, while his appointed consultant was out of the room for âtwo or three minutesâ his heart stopped, and in spite of several attempts to get it started, he was pronounced dead at the scene. Hugh has a bit of history here, for we joked during his recent visit about his heart stopping twice previously whilst in hospital, but on those occasions, fortunately they were quickly able to get him going again.\n\nA particular disappointment about Hughâs sudden departure is that he had already planned his Swan Song: in July thisÂ year he had been cast as Bottom in Shakespeareâs A Midsummer Nightâs Dream, a weekÂ of performances on the main stage of the Hull Truck Theatre. Iâd already booked tickets.Â\n\nÂ Hugh was a highly skilled craftsman and a consummate film editor who applied his own realistic but imaginative vision to countless productions, taking them to another level - Â including many of mine. He had a warm and very dry sense of humour; once asked what was his role in Malachite (our joint business venture), he repliedÂ âMy role in Malachite is to put a dampener on the proceedingsâ.Â He will be greatly missed, by me and his many friends.\n\nWith great regret we report the death of Patrick Reyntiens on 25th October 2021, just weeks away from his 96th birthday; Â Patrick had a dream in which an angel told him he would live to 96, so he almost made it. We worked together on the Malachite film biography From Coventry to Cochem - The Art of Patrick Reyntiens (2011). Patrick really was the most remarkable character who managed to combine great scholarship, impeccable craftsmanship, profound insight and impish fun within a robust and down-to-earth personality which was a joy to work with. He has been described by the Daily Telegraph as the 'genius of 20th century stained glassâ - Patrick is totally irreplaceable.\n\nHis huge output of beautiful stainedÂ glass windows will live on to delight and inspire generations to come, who will be amazed, as we are, that so much was produced by one exceptional man.\n\nAfter weÂ completed the film, Libby Horner went on to compile and write the Catalogue Raisonee of Patrickâs work.\n\nThe DVD of our film is available here\n\nIan Wilson BSC, a brilliant cameraman and a very old friend, sadly died of Covid-19 on 20th January 2021. Ian had been suffering fromÂ Parkinsonâs for some years; a tragic end to a luminous career.\n\nIan first worked with Malachite in 1975, shooting Land of the Falcon, made for Falcon Inns and the British Tourist Authority, which went on to win the Golden Compass International Tourism Film Competition, competing against 29 films from 17 countries. There is a short extract here.\n\nIan & Charles got on so well that Ian was easily tempted to become Director of Photography on our long-running film profile of sculptor Fiore de Henriquez and her Tuscan hill village (now titled Magnum Opus):Â âI canât give you any actual money, but Iâll pay for all the travelling expenses and as much red wine as youÂ can drinkâ. This production took us to Tuscany several times, and also Rome, London and New York. You can watch theÂ trailer here.\n\nIan was a joy to work with; a consummate professional with a wicked sense of humour and a delight in practical jokes and fireworks, although fortunately not usually at the same time. He loved food and wine and was both an excellent cook and a generous host, in his Primrose Hill flat or Dorset cottage.\n\nIn addition to working on Malachiteâs small-scale productions, Ian had a string of major TV drama series andÂ feature films to his name, includingÂ Quatermass (1979 d. Piers Haggard);Â The Flame Trees of Thika (1981 d. Roy Ward Baker);Â Wish You Were Here (1987 d. David Leland);Â Edward II (1991 d. Derek Jarman); Backbeat (1994 d. Iain Softley); Erik the Viking (1989 d. Terry Jones); Emma (1996 d. Douglas McGrath); The Crying Game (1992 d. Neil Jordan) and A Christmas Carol (1999 d. David Jones).Â\n\nAs well as being a magician with light, Ian preferred to do his own operating, and both these skills are very much to the fore in Music in Progress, our filmÂ about jazz composer Mike Westbrook, madeÂ for The Arts Council. Â Here is a clip:\n\nBecause of Parkinsonâs, Ian has been slipping away from us for several years, but Iâm left with so many happy memories and gratitude for his friendship and his brilliant work for Malachite over the years. Thank you Ian, you really were a Gentleman*\n\n* Ian Wilsonâs passport entry under Occupation:\n\nPotter Phil Rogers, seen here relaxing after a successful wood-firing, very sadly diedÂ Â on 22nd December 2020; he was 69.Â\n\nIn 2006, CM flew out to Japan to film Phil Rogers working with Ken Matsuzaki on a major wood-fired kiln burn, which went on around the clock for seven days. We later filmed him doing his own wood-firing in his rural studio at Lower Cefnfaes near Rhayader, Wales (above). Phil was a delight to work with; a consummate craftsman, funny, articulate and a passionate advocate of craft pottery.Â\n\nYou can watch Phil Rogers working in Japan and Wales on the Malachite DVD âA Passion for Potsâ available from Goldmarkart.\n\nThere is a Guardian obituary of Phil Rogers here.\n\nWhilst in Japan, Phil was keen to learn about more than pottery:\n\nIt is with great sadness that I must record the death of my very good friend and colleague Ken Baynes, who died on Saturday 5th October 2019; he was 85. Ken was Professor of Design Education, Exhibition Designer, Writer and also the mastermind of our three Design Matters TV series for Channel 4 in the 1980s.Â Ken was always incredibly enthusiastic and positive and was an absolute delight to work with. We made a total of 22 Design Matters programmes, which were broadcast from 1983 to 1987, receiving very positive reviews.Â He was a particular pleasure to work with as a filmmaker, because he was always very articulate, measured his words carefully, and thought and spoke most fluently. But for all his academicÂ scholarship, Â he always kept the world in perspective and, for example, could appreciate (as I do) that Dennis the Menace is a major cultural icon!\n\nKen Baynes on location in Newcastle upon Tyne during the filming of the Design Matters series for Channel 4 TV\n\nYou can read about Kenâs final book and the culmination of ten yearsâ work DESIGN: Models of Change here."
