Participants will get hands-on insight into the process of creating drama in a film using the human capacity to respond emotionally to fictional situations. The Singular Drama method is applicable on professional actors as well as non-actors. Filmmakers often use the element of surprise to direct actors for certain scenes to get authentic emotional responses. The directors of AJAMI based their film entirely on this principle. Unlike other forays into improvisation, AJAMI had a very precise screenplay and a well-constructed plot that demanded specific emotional responses from its actors. The actors ended up acting out a story, without being aware that they were being directed according to a pre-written script. The film is a work of fiction which shows â€œrealâ€ people acting in situations that are orchestrated by the directors, but very â€œrealâ€ to the performers, resulting in the actors projecting emotions on camera that they actually experienced at the time. This was achieved over specialized workshops, in which the actors were brought to each characterâ€™s emotional and psychological state as written in the script. Workshop learning objectives: 1. Participants will learn techniques to liberate their non-actors from the fear of the camera. 2. Participants will learn how to prepare their actors/non-actors for filming. 3. Participants will learn and experiment with improvisation techniques. 4. Participants will experience the method as actors in order to get a better understanding of the involved processes. 5. Participants will get insights on pre-production, production and shooting techniques when applying the method. 6. Participants will learn how to direct actors and non-actors using the Singular Drama method. Participants are encouraged to bring scenes they would like to direct. ABOUT SCANDAR COPTI Scandar Copti is an Oscar-nominated filmmaker and an acclaimed visual artist. His first full-length feature film 'Ajami' won the Camera d'Or Special Mention at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the 82nd Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Film category.

MIchal Luka experience speaks for itself and guarantees the high standards our participants have come to expect from FEST FILM LAB. COURSE DESCRIPTION Nowadays, it is rare for a film to not use any kind of VFX, which can range from slight background changes to entire VFX shots. But when should a filmmaker start thinking about VFX? VFX, if used right, can be an important tool for the betterment of the narrative. When filmmakers think of VFX only after filming, it will often end up as a botched attempt, since VFX elements werenâ€™t thought out, leaving the VFX team with the job of coming up with solutions and working around the mistakes made during filming. Storyboarding is a great way to put the filmmaker, and the VFX team, on the same page, allowing for a better understanding of the wanted final product, offering clear and concrete imagery of the needed VFX elements. Cinematographers must increasingly be prepared to work with VFX and similar digital environments such as Virtual Production. Increasingly these tools will become more standard in independent, small film production, therefore it is imperative for, not only producers and directors, but also cinematographers to better grasp the specifications of this. In this workshops, Michal Luka will show how to work with these tools, and how to better achieves your results The course will also cover the following topic list: ESSENCE OF THE CRAFT Auteur versus Industry â€“ the realities of the business. DIY - low budget approaches Understanding your abilities Overview and â€œCase Studyâ€ clips of my work Documentary and feature film approach PREPPING Script break down Aesthetic overview â€“ the look and the story - Stylistic Approach Crewing up Location hunting Rehearsing before the shoot Storyboard How to work with: Art department Costume Camera Planning for Digital VFX Green screen / blue screen environment SHOOTING Camera angle and framing, Different aspect ratios Static vs movement cameraâ€™s personality LIGHT light meters Lighting Setup - Mood natural light location lighting studio lighting PROFILE OF PARTICIPANT The workshop designed for Cinematographers, Camera Operators, Directors, DIT, VFX artists, CGI Artists, Film Students, or anyone serious about a career in the Film Business on the area of cinematography.

WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Film Financing workshop will focus on the art of producing a film in our entrepreneurial age, where the means of manufacture and distribution are in flux and where finding your audience is key. The workshop will look at the how to develop, finance and complete a movie from the viewpoint of a creative producer. The workshop wonâ€™t be looking so much at the making of a movie more about setting off on the right track and finishing ahead of the game. The workshop will be practical and interactive, with participants also having the opportunity to assess the issues they encountered on their own films, and receiving the feedback to help similar situations in the future. Participants should be prepared to discuss an unproduced project that has been previously developed by them to the point of a first draft screenplay. The project doesnâ€™t have to be an active project, just an idea that the participant can use in the workshop. The scripts will not be read or shared during the workshop. If the participant doesnâ€™t have one, then an idea that has been developed to treatment stage is also sufficient. For each film idea, the participants should also think of a director, lead cast, location, budget range and core audience.In addition, each participant should be prepared to informally pitch a recent idea based on a recent news article or event. These pitches will involve other participants role playing as potential buyers. The topics covered in the workshop: A.
