        "text": "If there is a ‘most valuable player’ to this film it is Ian Hart, who blends an uncannily accurate voice with perfectly mimicked mannerisms and an impressive depth of character.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 7/10 | Apr 17, 2024\n\nThe truth often undercuts the film’s simplistic notions about true love and about friendship.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Jun 6, 2022\n\nWhen we have a comprehensive documentary available in the form of The Beatles Anthology, films like Backbeat end up serving as a moot point.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Jul 1, 2019\n\nWhy would anyone would want to see a movie about the pre-fame Beatles when the post-fame Beatles had enough drama and excitement to fill several movies.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1.5/4 | Feb 24, 2019\n\nGet back, get back to where you once belonged, you want to shout. But the movie is stuck in the wrong groove.\n\nFull Review | Apr 4, 2018\n\nIt is the band, the group - with or without Sutcliffe - that makes Backbeat such a powerfully emotional elegy.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Apr 4, 2018\n\nThere's nothing very profound here, but we do at least get a nice handling of period and milieu, and pretty good performances of the songs.\n\nFull Review | Sep 10, 2007\n\nThe film tells the story of the original, little-known fifth Beatle, Stuart Sutcliffe, a young painter with rock n' roll sensibility who in 1960 forgoes his promising art career to join his best friend John Lennon (nicely played by Ian Hart) in Berlin\n\nFull Review | Original Score: B- | Sep 12, 2006\n\nYou can't miss the affection and sincerity Backbeat carries from start to finish.... Softley bottles the attitude and energy, the excitement of the new, that were as integral to the Beatles' success as their songs.\n\nFull Review | Apr 9, 2006\n\nThe music, done here by a group of grunge all-stars, doesn't even attempt to sound dead-on, but remains mostly true to the raucous spirit of the time.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Dec 6, 2005\n\nIain Softley directs his feature debut with simplicity and feeling, and you don't have to have been a Beatles fan to get with the beat. Gives you hope for the British film industry.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Jun 22, 2005"
