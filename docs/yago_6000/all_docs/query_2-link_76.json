        "text": "I never had the previous DVD but there some decent extras. This is what Amazon listed...\n\nDVD Features:\n\nAvailable Audio Tracks: English (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n\nAll-new remastered sound and picture\n\nA conversation with Astrid Kirchherr\n\nDeleted scenes\n\nInterviews with director Iain Softley and actor Ian Hart\n\nWhen it was first announced last year it was supposed to have a still gallery\n\nof Stu's art, but I haven't seen that on the current description of the disk.\n\nMaybe it got held up for those dreaded \"legal issues.\"\n\nMark\n\nYeah, I'm pretty sure you're correct. I thought it'd come out in a barebones version, but I found no evidence of that.\n\nIf you'd like to see my review, here's the link: http://www.dvdmg.com/backbeat.shtml\n\nWarning: I didn't like the movie! I found it to be a real disappointment...\n\nBackbeat first came out on DVD on the 12th August 2003. I got my copy a couple of weeks later. The new version looks to be identical except it now has a 5.1 soundtrack compared to stereo before. However, the stereo soundtrack was still excellent. The only difference in extra's is the interview with Astrid on the new version.\n\nI saw this movie when it first came out in 1993. I thought it was fantastic then and my opinion hasn't changed. Well worth picking up.\n\nHi Colin,\n\nIt did come out in Region 1. That's what my copy is. Universal released it. I imported my copy from Amazon. If you look up Backbeat on Amazon's site, the second one on the list say's \"Special Order\". Look at the details, it says release date 12th August 2003. This is the one I have.\n\nI am holding one in my hands as I type this: Universal 21233--c2003\n\nSpecial Fearures are: Feature Commentary with director Iain Softley; Deleted Scenes; Interview with Director Iain Softley; Stills Gallery; Interview with Actor Ian Hart; Director's Essay; Casting Sessions; TV Featurette. Sound is Dolby Surround. Anamorphic widescreen 1.85:1. The new edition seems to be missing many of the prior features.\n\nLooks like it has the same stuff as the original plus a bit more. Here's what was listed on Oatsdad's site.\n\nBonus:\n\n• Audio Commentary with Director Iain Softley and Actors Ian Hart And Stephen Dorff\n\n• “A Conversation with Astrid Kirchherr” Featurette\n\n• Two Deleted Scenes\n\n• Sundance Channel Iain Softley Interview\n\n• Interview with Iain Softley and Ian Hart\n\n• TV Featurette\n\n• Casting Session\n\n• Director’s Essay\n\n• Photo Gallery\n\n??? There's nothing you list that's not on the current DVD..."
