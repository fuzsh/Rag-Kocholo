        "text": "\"Bean\"\n\nDirected by Mel Smith.\n\nStarring Rowan Atkinson, Peter Macnicol, Pamela Reed\n\nIn case you are under the impression that a film based on a\n\nBritish TV series which appears on PBS must be refined and\n\nrespectable, \"Bean\" will surprise you. The show, and now the\n\nfull-length movie, are engagingly as far from sophistication as you\n\ncan get.\n\nThe story is pretty simple. Bean, played by Rowan Atkinson\n\n(\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\"), enjoying a protected job, sits\n\nquietly in a corner of the London National Art Gallery – sleeping\n\nlike the Maytag repairman. Naturally, the childish,\n\nM&M-scarfing fool doesn’t mix well with the gallery’s priggish,\n\nintellectual board of directors. When they spot an opportunity to\n\nship him away to California to pose as a renowned art scholar, the\n\nboard seizes the chance. Besides, they figure, those barbaric,\n\nculture-deprived Yankees won’t know the difference.\n\nThe running joke, of course, is that we Americans don’t know the\n\ndifference. Despite proving his absolutely mind-boggling stupidity\n\nscene after scene, Bean still manages to retain respect as \"the\n\ncelebrated Dr. Bean.\"\n\nAngelenos label his childishness as mere \"eccentricity\" and note\n\nhis shocking social ineptness as the result of too much reading.\n\nBean’s stupidity puts Ace Ventura to shame, yet the very\n\nintellectuals who would probably turn their noses up to Jim Carrey\n\nare shown here embracing Bean – with hilariously open arms.\n\nIn a particularly clever jab at America’s lack of refinement,\n\nBurt Reynolds (popping up unexpectedly all over the place these\n\ndays), appears briefly as an \"art-lover\" who purchases \"Whistler’s\n\nMother\" for $50 million just because he can’t stand the thought of\n\nthose \"Frenchies\" owning the greatest painting ever to come out of\n\nAmerica.\n\nNot only does Bean bridge the gap between the United States and\n\nBritain, he bridges the gap between childhood and adulthood. He has\n\nnever grown up, and doesn’t want to. This is probably why Bean has\n\ncaptured the hearts of millions.\n\nThe only crime \"Bean\" commits is not showcasing Atkinson’s\n\ntalents enough. Often, the gifted comedian takes a back seat to the\n\ndisappointingly bland supporting cast. Peter Macnicol turns in a\n\nboring, one-note performance as the Grierson curator continually\n\nannoyed and baffled by Bean’s stunts.\n\nYet Bean’s ample hilarity is dumb and dumber enough that the\n\nBritish buffoon should become America’s next comic sensation.\n\nAsh Steffy\n\nGrade: B+\n\n\"The Wings of the Dove\"\n\nDirected by Iain Softley\n\nStarring Helena Bonham Carter, Linus Roache and Alison\n\nElliott\n\nIain Softley sure was an interesting choice to direct \"The Wings\n\nof the Dove,\" the third adaptation of a Henry James novel in a\n\nlittle over a year. Softley’s first feature was the insipid\n\n\"Backbeat.\" His most recent film was (cough) \"Hackers\" – ’nuff\n\nsaid.\n\nWith this latest film, Softley starts on a clean slate, wiping\n\nout the memory of his first two films in the process. Though the\n\nfilm lacks the visuals in Merchant/Ivory films, it more than makes\n\nup for it in Softley’s ability to create a low-key environment\n\nenabling his principle stars to subtly peel off layers of inner\n\nturmoil that demonstrate the struggle between the heart and the\n\nmind.\n\nPeriod piece queen Helena Bonham Carter plays free-spirited Kate\n\nCroy, living a life of luxury and high-class during the early\n\n1900s, under her aunt’s (Charlotte Rampling) watchful eye.\n\nRight from the opening, we see the passionate love Kate shares\n\nwith journalist Merton Densher (Linus Roache). Their love is\n\nrestricted, however, because of Merton’s status as a commoner and\n\nthe connivance of Kate’s aunt. Then Millie Theale (Allison Elliott)\n\nappears as the solution to Kate’s problem, an American heiress with\n\na vast fortune and waning health.\n\nThe film comes into its own as we see Kate’s duplicitous nature\n\nwhen she attempts to make Millie fall for Merton. The developing\n\nfriendship of the principle characters gives insight into the\n\npsychological manifestations that come as a result of the complex\n\nmanipulation of fate by everyone involved.\n\n\"The Wings of the Dove\" was tailor-made to let its actors shine.\n\nKate’s inner demons give Carter her most memorable role since\n\n\"Howard’s End.\" Carter demonstrates her depth as an actress as she\n\nshows us a sympathetic and human side to a woman who outwardly\n\ncomes off as cold and detached.\n\nFilm buffs will recognize Roache, Carter’s partner in crime, in\n\nhis first film since his debut as the title character in the\n\ncontroversy-laden \"Priest.\" The two roles are not dissimilar.\n\nIn \"Priest,\" Roache played a character struggling between his\n\nlove for the church and his love for another man. Here, Roache\n\nplays a character struggling between his rooted love for Kate and\n\nhis blossoming love for Millie.\n\nThe most surprising performance in the film though goes to\n\nElliott (\"The Spitfire Grill\"), who could have easily played Millie\n\nas your typical, sweet and innocent tragic heroine. Instead,\n\nElliott gives us a character who is bold and unafraid to obtain\n\nwhat she wants, yet good-natured enough to make your heart\n\nmelt.\n\nEach character’s desire best represents Henry James’s most\n\ncommon themes. Kate looks for the freedom to break away from the\n\nchains of a rigid class system. Merton desires the wealth that will\n\nallow him to marry Kate. Millie longs for love that will sweep her\n\naway before her imminent departure from the world.\n\nIn the end, \"The Wings of the Dove\" is not so much a statement\n\nabout life being a struggle between good and evil, but rather about\n\nlife being a struggle between good and bad circumstances.\n\nTristan Thai\n\nGrade: A-\n\n\"Sick\"\n\nDirected by Kirby Dick\n\nFeaturing Bob Flanagan\n\nShriek contentedly as you drive that nail through the tip of\n\nyour penis. Groan with pleasure as you feel your wife shove a\n\nfist-sized metal ball up your anus. Hell, do anything to take your\n\nmind off the fact that you’re dying.\n\nAt least, that’s how Bob Flanagan saw it, having been born with\n\ncystic fibrosis, a disease which fills the lungs with mucous and\n\nkills most of its victims before age 30.\n\nYet Flanagan, an award-winning writer and performance artist who\n\nbased his art on his masochistic obsessions, held out until age 43.\n\nHis death last year and the two years prior provide the bulk of\n\nKirby Dick’s intriguing documentary, \"Sick.\"\n\nThis piece meticulously explores what shapes the strange sexual\n\nand emotional hunger of a masochist as much as it attempts to\n\ncapture the decline of an individual into the realms of death. A\n\nfascinating examination of a subcultural phenomenon, \"Sick\" eases\n\nviewers into a position comfortable with Flanagan’s destructive\n\nbehavior without suggesting that self-brutality offers itself as\n\nthe only means of coping with a life-threatening disease. And how\n\ncould it when sewing one’s testicles together so rarely finds its\n\nway into medical journals as a reliever of internal physical\n\nills?\n\nHowever, the film never holds back, or causes audiences to feel\n\nisolated from Flanagan’s world. Including everything from taped\n\nperformances at S&M clubs to readings to short films that\n\nFlanagan and his wife crafted in the ’80s, the man’s psyche is laid\n\nbare. Interviews with his family find their way on screen to sketch\n\na broad portrait of the social misfit.\n\nThe piece does feel like a side show carnival at times, throwing\n\nin gratuitous scenes of Flanagan’s sexual perverseness solely for\n\nshock effect.\n\nStill, it would seem inappropriate to keep footage tame. For\n\ninstance, why not show his wife slice a lightning shaped scar into\n\nhis chest or apply industrial clamps to his stomach? Flanagan would\n\nhave wanted fans to watch and in an voyeuristic way, audiences will\n\nwant to humor him. At least, they won’t be able to tear their eyes\n\nfrom the screen.\n\nBeyond the inclusion of the grotesque, though, Kirby deals\n\nlovingly with Flanagan as a suffering individual, constantly biting\n\nback unendurable amounts of physical pain. Neither portrayed as a\n\nvictim or a hero, a freak or an average Joe, Flanagan comes across\n\nas human. A human with quirks and trauma, a human who knows he will\n\ndie. And, though his life may have been one of extremes, he died\n\njust as unglamourously as anyone.\n\nVanessa VanderZanden\n\nGrade: A"
