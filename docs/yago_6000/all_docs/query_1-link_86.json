        "text": "Some retro movies and some actual older movies have made their way to DVD this week.\n\n\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" (Paramount, 2004, PG, $29.99).\n\nThis sci-fi epic could almost qualify as an animated film, in that it is entirely computer-generated, save for the actors. Even the sets are \"blue-screen\" designs; the actors performed against blank backgrounds, and everything else was digitally inserted later.\n\nThe film is not a complete success; there are places where the seams wear through and the artificiality is a detriment. But for the most part it's visually fascinating, a throwback to old-time serials with futuristic trappings, art-deco designs and 1940s costumes.\n\nThe swashbuckling hero is a flier played by Jude Law. Gwyneth Paltrow is a snoopy reporter and his former girlfriend, and Angelina Jolie, wearing an eye patch, is Paltrow's rival. The plot, which is occasionally incomprehensible, has them battling giant robots while they track down an evil scientist.\n\nBonus features include the six-minute short on which the film is based and plenty of talk about how the film was made.\n\nExtras: Separate widescreen and full-frame editions, audio commentaries (by producer Jon Avnet, and another by writer/director Kerry Conran and the special-effects crew), deleted scenes, making-of featurettes, bloopers, language options (English, French), subtitle options (English, Spanish), chapters.\n\n\"Bunny Lake Is Missing\" (Columbia, 1965, not rated, b/w, $19.95).\n\nOtto Preminger directed this gorgeous black-and-white widescreen picture, which is more intimate than most of Preminger's '60s films. It's a kidnap-mystery about the title child being taken from a private school in London. Or was she?\n\nAs the police inspector (Laurence Olivier) who is in charge of the investigation looks into the matter, he begins to wonder if the child actually exists, or if her frantic mother (Carol Lynley) and creepy uncle (Keir Dullea) are simply deluded.\n\nA compelling psychological tale with terrific performances from everyone except Dullea, who goes from stiff to weird to over the top.\n\nExtras: Widescreen, trailers, subtitle options (English, French), chapters.\n\n\"Backbeat\" (Universal, 1994; R for language, sex, nudity, violence, drugs; $19.98).\n\nThough primarily aimed at Beatles fans, this story of the group in its pre-stardom early days is pretty good drama on its own.\n\nPrimarily it is the story of Stuart Sutcliffe (Stephen Dorff), \"the lost Beatle,\" who left the band before it gained fame in the early '60s. The film concentrates primarily on Sutcliffe's relationship with his childhood best friend John Lennon (Ian Hart) and, later, a German photographer named Astrid Kirchherr, considered the creative force behind the band's look.\n\nDorff is quite good in the lead, and Hart is nothing short of amazing as Lennon (whom he also played in the little black-and-white art film \"The Hours and the Times\"). Too bad it's so raunchy\n\nExtras: Widescreen, interview with Astrid Kirchherr, interviews with Hart and director Iain Softley, Sundance Channel interview with Softley, deleted scenes, making-of featurette, casting session, text essay by Softley, photo gallery, language options (English, French), subtitle options (English, Spanish, French), chapters.\n\nExtras: Widescreen, audio commentary, storyboards, optional English subtitles, chapters.\n\n\"The Beastmaster: Special Edition\" (Anchor Bay, 1982, PG, $19.98).\n\nThis is a curious genre mix, made shortly after \"Conan the Barbarian\" gave a boost to sword-and-sandal fantasies in the 1980s. The title character (Marc Singer) communes with the animals â€” and even sees through their eyes. And for comic relief, he carries a pair of ferrets with him.\n\nJohn Amos is very good in support, and Rip Torn is the chief villain, and the sense of humor helps (this has been a basic-cable staple in edited form). But it's not really for youngsters; it's quite violent, and there's a nude scene with Tanya Roberts.\n\nExtras: Widescreen, audio commentary (writer/director Don Coscarelli, writer/producer Paul Pepperman) making-of featurettes, production gallery, bios, trailer, DVD-Rom applications, poster, liner notes, chapters."
