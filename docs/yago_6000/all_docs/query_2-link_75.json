The film captures the moment when the band starts gaining popularity, and bass guitarist Stuart Sutcliffe (played by Stephen Dorff) finds himself torn between his best friend John Lennon (played by Ian Hart), his new love Astrid (played by Sheryl Lee), and the iconic rock 'n' roll band.\n\nBackbeat is a film full of vitality and heart, with a soundtrack that includes music from legendary artists such as Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters, David Pirner of Soul Asylum, and Mike Mills of R.E.M. Rolling Stone described the film as a thrilling spectacle that is defiant, raucous, and erotic.\n\nIn addition to the main feature, the bonus content includes a conversation with Astrid Kirchherr, deleted scenes, an interview with director Iain Softley and actor Ian Hart, an interview with Iain Softley for the Sundance Channel, audio commentary with Iain Softley, Ian Hart, and Stephen Dorff, a TV featurette, and a casting session.\n\nBackbeat offers a unique and captivating look into the early days of one of the greatest bands in music history, showcasing the struggles and triumphs of the Beatles as they navigated the complexities of fame, friendship, and love. Experience the excitement and drama of the band's journey to stardom in this must-see film.\n\nproduct information:"
