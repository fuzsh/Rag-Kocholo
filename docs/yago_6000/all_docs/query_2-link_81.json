        "text": "I have been watching a few documentaries over the past few months and thought I share an opinion or two. If yout are interested in rock and roll, New York City history, or baseball there is something here for you.\n\nJerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind\n\nDirected by Ethan Coen this documentary is filled with incredible performance footage of “The Killer” rocking his life away. He was a powerhouse on the piano. On the flip side of the coin, there is plenty of interview footage, some disturbing when it came to his marriage to his 13-year cousin, Myra. It’s all straightforward and the music rocks. Streaming on Amazon.\n\nIf These Walls Could Sing\n\nDirected by Mary McCartney, this documentary is a fascinating look at the long history of Abbey Road Studios whose many artists made history there including Mary’s dad and the other members of his band known as The Beatles (you may have heard of them). But there are many more than just the four lads from Liverpool who recorded there. Other artists included Elton John, Jimmy Page, Shirley Bassey, Cilla Black, John Williams and many more. Streaming on Disney.\n\nTriangle Fire\n\nThe Triangle Shirtwaist Fire is one of the most famous and infamous in New York City history. 146 workers, 123 women and girls died in the fire. The youngest girls were 14. Most victims died of burns, asphyxiation, and the impact from jumping out of the 8th and 9th floor windows of the building. The company owners, Max Blanck and Issac Harris, their office on the 10th floor were quickly notified. They escaped by going up to the roof and jumping to the next building uncaring about their employees below. Most of the workers were poor Italian and Jewish immigrants working long hours for two dollars a day. Click on the link here to watch.\n\nIt Ain’t Over\n\nGrowing up I was a baseball fan, more specifically a Yankees fan. Mickey Mantle was my idol. It was the days of The Mick, Whitey Ford, Elston Howard, Hank Bauer, Bill “Moose” Skowron and Yogi Berra. “It Ain’t Over” is a loving documentary on one of the great ballplayers of his day. Ten World Series championships, three American League MVP Awards and eighteen All-Star appearances showed Yogi was one of the greatest players of his day and any other day. The film touches on his skills guiding pitchers during a game including Don Larsen’s perfect World Series game. Yogi knew batters better than most as both a player and later as a coach and manager. Oh yeah, his “Yogisms” and his unhappiness with the media, including the Yogi the Bear caricature, that many times overshadowed his abilities on the field and his feud with George Steinbrenner are all on display. Yogi was one of a kind, and as he once said, “if you can’t imitate him, don’t copy him.” No one could. Streaming on Netflix and other services.\n\nThe Lynchpin of Bensonhurst\n\nI unexpectedly came across this documentary yesterday and what caught my eye was the title. Having grown up in Bensonhurst I was interested. The film is a look at the life of the Carlo Gambino family hitman, Dominick Montiglio. The film covers his career as a member of a doo-wop singing group called The Four Directions who made a few minor records. From there he went to become a Vietnam War hero, to Gambino hitman to witness protection and finally becoming an artist. A long, strange, violent trip. Available on various platforms.\n\nThe Ballad of Greenwich Village\n\nInteresting documentary praising the famous bohemian neighborhood, tracing its rebellious roots all the way back to the early 1800s. There are plenty of vintage photos, film clips of rallies, outdoor hootenannies, visits to famed landmarks and an array of the now famous who lived or hung out including Richie Havens, Norman Mailer, Peter, Paul and Mary, Tim Robbins and more. Available here!\n\nAlbert Brooks: Defending My Life\n\nA comprehensive take on the brilliant career of one of the most inventive funnymen ever. Albert Brooks broke all the rules, created new ones and quickly became a regular return guest on Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show. Soon there were comedy albums and a series of some of the funniest, offbeat films (Modern Romance, Lost in America, Mother) he both acted and directed in recent history. Brooks’ talent as an actor expanded into serious dramas including “Taxi Driver”, “Out of Sight” and “Drive.” A must see. Available on HBO.\n\nThe Lost Weekend: A Love Story\n\nBoth a nostalgic and revelatory take on the John Lennon’s “lost weekend” with May Pang that lasted 18 months. The documentary is a visual treat and a moving journey offering a variety of personal photos and audio recordings. Most intriguing are the takes of Lennon’s reunions with his former Beatles bandmate Paul McCartney. Available on verious platforms.\n\n“Let It Be” is a glorious mess, with little continuity, poor editing, a lack of direction and at times poor sound quality. You also get to see the most influential group in Rock and Roll history argue, mock each other, play poorly at times, look bored (Ringo) and watch a curious shadowy Yoko Ono cling to John Lennon throughout. Despite all this, there are ample things to enjoy, primarily the opportunity to watch this celebrated band rehearse and create their work in the studio and a now legendary rooftop concert.\n\nEven with all the in fighting and hard feelings that were rising to the surface, they could still have fun and play well, as they do, from the top of the Apple Building, which turned out to be the final time John, Paul, George and Ringo ever performed together. The film is not for the casual fan who will probably find it somewhat boring at times and skip over directly to the concert. On the other hand, serious Beatles and Rock and Roll fans will find the film a fascinating look at the most celebrated band ever in the final stages of their career. As previously pointed out, the film is technically bad, director Michael Lindsay-Hogg should never be allowed behind a camera again. There were hours and hours of film shot and it seems no one knew how to put all this footage together. Except for an occasionally nice cut here and there, the film looks like it was chopped with a cleaver by a character from the Sopranos. While the sound of the music is crisp and loud, much of the dialogue between the fab four is hard to hear and at times unclear, forcing you to raise the volume on your TV. This is especially noticeable during the now well known “tutoring” Paul gave to George on how to play the guitar in which George, fed up finally said, and I am paraphrasing here a bit, “I’ll play anyway you want me too or I don’t have to play at all.” George apparently walked out and quite the group at this point (this is not noted in the film) and there was talk of replacing him with Eric Clapton. George did return and Billy Preston was brought into the sessions to help ease the tension. Poor George also became the brunt of some mocking by John, when during a rehearsal of George’s song “I Me Mine”, John began to dance a waltz with Yoko. John, off camera, sarcastically had told George as he listened to the slower portion of the song “We’re a Rock and Roll band!”\n\nIt’s not all bad; there is plenty in the film to savor. Ringo and George rehearsing “Octopus’ Garden” with Ringo on piano and eventually John joining in on drums. We see the group singing tidbits of songs never completed like “Suzy Parker.” While warming up the band would jump into bits and pieces of oldies like “Rip it Up”, “Shake Rattle and Roll”, “Kansas City” and “Lawdy Miss Clawdy” segueing from one to the other. You get a look at their creative process as you watch Paul and John work out specific cords Paul wanted for his song, “I Got a Feeling.” There is as he Paul reminisces to someone off camera about the early days, how he and John would write songs in his family’s living room, mostly pretty bad stuff, but some that were eventually used liked “Love Me Do.” He talked how they both hated the words to “One After 909” and in one of the more inspired edited moments, we quickly cut to the band in the studio doing a blazing version of the song, one much better than the official released version on the “Let It Be” album.\n\nThe original concept was to do a TV special with a concert performance at the end. The TV idea was scraped and a feature film was now planned, which would fulfill their three-picture deal with United Artists. Still, they discussed doing a live performance somewhere, Paul and John were for it, George, never wanted to perform live again. Paul liked the idea of performing in a small venue; John suggested somewhere more exotic, Africa. They were unable to come up with an idea all could agree on. According to the book “The Beatles: An Oral History” by David Prichard and Alan Lysasht, engineer/producer Glyn Johns came up with the idea of doing a concert on the roof of the Apple Building. A competing version of the story comes from Tony Branwell in his book “Magical Mystery Tours: My Life with The Beatles” where he states it was Paul who came up with the idea for the concert on the roof. Whatever the truth may be, all four members of the group liked the off beat idea of playing to all of the West End of London.\n\nHowever disjointed the rest of the film may be the final twenty minutes is pure magic. The concert actually lasted about forty five minutes before the police pulled the proverbial plug. They played only seven songs, short versions of “God Save the Queen” and “She’s So Heavy” were edited out along with multiple versions of “Don’t Let Me Down”, “I’ve Got a Feeling” and “Get Back.” They also performed “One After 909” and “Dig a Pony.” Intercut with the performances, the filmmakers showed the bewildered crowds down below as the music began to play.\n\nIt was a chilly and windy day in London, hair is blowing and jackets are worn. The group begins to play.\n\n#1 – Get Back – The group kicks off with a rocking version of “Get Back.” Down on the street we see passerby’s looking up bewildered, wondering what is going on? Can it be The Beatles are performing live up on the roof?\n\n#2 – Don’t Let Me Down – As John wails out this tune, young men are now climbing up to the rooftops of adjacent buildings to get a better view. The crowd on the street is beginning to grow.\n\n#3 – I’ve Got a Feeling – By the end of this song the crowds have increased. The police make their first appearance trying to control the crowds and keep auto traffic moving. Not everyone on the street is happy with this free concert. One middle-aged woman complained that, “it made no sense.” A businessman, stated, “the music was alright in its place….it’s a bit of an imposition to interrupt the business area in this way.” On the other side of the generation gap, one young lady thought it was “fantastic” and another simply said, “it was great.”\n\n#4 – One After 909 – With this song one has to wonder how prophetic the boys were being here playing one of the earliest songs they ever wrote and now it was one of the last they would ever perform together.\n\n#5 – Dig A Pony – The police presence was gathering, stern faces looking very concerned moving among the crowd. They were getting ready to make their move. Two police officers are seen knocking on the front door of Apple and are let in. They soon make their way upstairs.\n\n#6 – Get Back – The police are on the rooftop talking to a Beatles associate. John and George turn and notice the two officers however continue playing. As the song comes toward it close, Paul changes the words, singing, “Get Back Loretta, you’ve been playing on the roof again, and that’s no good. Momma doesn’t like it and she’s gonna get you arrested.”\n\nAs the band puts their instruments down, John who always had the witty last word said, “On behalf of the group and ourselves, I hope we passed the audition.”\n\nWith that, The Beatles as a group never performed again.\n\n“Let It Be” won an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and a Grammy for Best Original Score for a Motion Picture. Watching the concert part of the movie puts to rest any thoughts anyone may have that The Beatles could no longer perform well as a live four piece Rock and Roll band. The film remains criminally unreleased on DVD. Legally, only VHS and laser disc copies of the film are available and both are scarce. Bootleg copies abound, some claiming to be official releases, and the internet is filled with clips from the film. Still why isn’t this film and the multitude of outtakes available? What a great 2-disc package this would be. In 2007, the film was being remastered with plans for an eventual release on DVD, however for reasons unknown the process was stopped and the film remains a rare treasure.\n\nAttached here is a interview with director Michael Lindsay-Hogg from 2003 on releasing a DVD of “Let It Be.”"
