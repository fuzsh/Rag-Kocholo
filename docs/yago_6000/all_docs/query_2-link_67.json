Palminteri was offered over a million to walk away from the project, but with only $200 left in the bank, he refused.

He soon had a class of pupils of his own, some of whom are still studying with him. By age 17, he’d achieved local fame as a performer, winning the Griffith Artist Award. Inducted into the Army during the Korean War, he gave concerts on the front lines and for top military leaders. During this experience, he came to understand that he possessed a missionary zeal, a desire to bring music’s message to a wider audience.\n\nBernstein realized this goal through a concert career that took him to Asia, Europe, and throughout the Americas, and with his books With Your Own Two Hands and 20 Lessons in Keyboard Choreography, which have been published in German, Japanese, Korean, Russian and Chinese. Two new books, Monsters and Angels: Surviving a Career in Music and Chopin: Interpreting His Notational Symbols have recently been published by Manduca Music Publishing.\n\nBernstein studied with such notable musicians as Alexander Brailowsky, Sir Clifford Curzon, Jan Gorbaty, Nadia Boulanger and Georges Enesco. He debuted in 1969 with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, playing the world premiÃ¨re of Concerto No. 2 by VillaâLobos. He’s won First Prize and Prix Jacques Durand at Fontainebleau, the National Federation of Music Clubs Award for Furthering American Music Abroad, a Beebe Foundation grant, 2 Martha Baird Rockefeller grants and 4 State Department grants. Wherever his concert tours took him, he made a point of offering master classes and lecture recitals. When grant money allowed, he filled his suitcases with scores to distribute to teachers and students.\n\nOne of the most soughtâafter clinicians in this country and abroad, Bernstein is also a prolific composer, with many works on the bestseller list. His compositions range from teaching material for students of all levels to the most sophisticated concert pieces. He continues to perform as a guest artist with chamber ensembles and serves regularly on the juries of a number of international competitions. In addition to his piano faculty appointment at NYU Steinhardt, Bernstein maintains a private studio in New York City. On December 18, 2004, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Music degree from Shenandoah University.\n\nAudience and press responses to Ethan Hawke’s documentary on Bernstein have eclipsed all expectations. Sundance Selects purchased the rights to the film and released it to theaters throughout the US and South America."
