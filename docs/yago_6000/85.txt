Directed by Iain Softley, Backbeat is an energetic, musical drama chronicling the pre-fame Beatles as they head to Hamburg in search of success. As they gain popularity, the "fifth Beatle" bass guitarist Stuart Sutcliffe (Stephen Dorff), falls in love and ultimately must choose between his best friend John Lennon, and his new love (Sheryl Lee) and the greatest rock and roll band in the world. Full of vitality and heart, with a soundtrack that includes rock and roll classics, including music from Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Foo Fighters), David Pirner (Soul Asylum), and Mike Mills (R.E.M).
