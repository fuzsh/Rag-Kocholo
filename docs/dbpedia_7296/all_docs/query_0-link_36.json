        "text": "CONTENTS October 17th, 2011 [pages 6-15] I Persecution and the Art of Writing or Towards a Hermeneutics of Suspicion from interpretation of the meaning between lines to explanation of the transcendental effect of forms 1. ‘PERSECUTION’: from the threat of philosophical truth to the subversion of the verisimilitude of fiction 2. ‘THE ART OF WRITING’: protection for the author and selective communication with accomplices i. The protective output: the censor’s impasse and authority outwitted ii. The communicational output: separation of readerships and selective training in the subversive knowledge 3. The ‘ART OF READING’: from interpretation of the implicit message to explanation of the transcendental revolution in forms i. The ‘interpretation’ stage: moving from the explicit sense to the implicit intended meaning—criteria for recognizing and reconstructing the concealed message. * First stage: criteria for recognizing anomalies that give grounds to suspect second intentions * Second stage: reconstruction criteria allowing the implicit meaning to be established ii. The stage of ‘explanation’: from the sociology of knowledge to transcendental stylistics October 18th, 2011 [pages 16-31] II The Latin Erotic Elegy and the Case of Propertius from subversion of the Augustan imperial ethos to the metaphysics of dissimulatio 1. Introduction. From the elegiac paradox (irrepressible passion-love in an interruptive texture) to an art of writing between the lines 2. A historico-literary context of substitution: the Roman erotic elegy between poetic dissimulatio and Augustan auctoritas i. Literary elements that contribute to ‘recognition’ of the elegiac art of writing: from literature as imitatio to irony as dissimulatio ii. Political elements that contribute to the ‘reconstruction’ of the implied message: elegiac values versus the values of Augustan auctoritas—Propertius’ authorial situation vis-à-vis the vates, Horace and Virgil. 3. Interpretation: an amatory façade for the subversion of imperial values—progressive dissimulatio in Propertius’ writing i. Propertius’ independence in the Monobiblos: from amatory etiology to the sphragis of political resistance ii. Propertius’ precautions in Maecenas’ circle, or the art of writing in Books 2 and 3: from the amatory mask to the mask of literary rivalry * The love mask: frontal subversion of Augustan moral reforms and marriage laws sheltered in the imperative of ‘irregular elegiac passion’ * The mask of literary rivalry in the programmatic elegies: from urban recusatio, the refusal to write epic on national themes, to subversion of the Augustan ideals expressed in the official poetry of Horace and Virgil. -Subversion of the imperial ideals in Virgil’s poetry: mocking the claims of the Aeneid. Propertius 2.34. -Subversion of Horace’s public stances in the Odes. Propertius 3.1-2. * The final mask: the use of hyperbole, bad taste and mythological harmonics to subvert the political values and legitimated triumphs of the imperial authority iii. Propertius under Augustus’ eye: the final dissimulatio in Book 4—subversion by deliberate bad taste and allusion by mythological harmonics. 4. Explanation: from the counterworld of the elegiac fiction to the metaphysics of dissimulatio i. The sociology of discourse: the counterworld of the elegiac fiction, or the Dionysiac inversion of Apollonian values ii. Transcendental poetics: the metaphysics of dissimulatio October 19th, 2011 [pages 32-56] III The Love Poetry of the Provençal Troubadours from the sensualism of the gai saber to the synthesis of sound against the totalitarianism of vision 1. Introduction. A paradoxical contrast – the monotony of the motives of idealized love versus the originality of the couplings of rhyme – as promotion of the queen in a game of warfare 2. A historico-literary context of substitution. Troubadour joi: from the gai saber of Occitan dispersion to the linguistic joculum of the couplings of rhyme i. The philosophico-discursive side: the naturalistic sensualism of the gai saber vs. Christian orthodox ontotheology ii. The poetico-literary aspect: the promotion of musical joculum in the couplings of rhyme 3. Interpretation. The naturalistic sensualism of the gai saber: a provocative defense of ‘sensory passion’ in a ‘world governed by chance’ i. The trobar prim (naturau e cortes) of William of Aquitaine (1071-1126): from the paradox of a ‘double-faced poet’ to the game of con in a world of chance * The contradictions of a ‘double-faced poet.’ A reading in context * The natural register in the companion songs: a pornographic imaginary behind the explicit defense of natural passion. * The invention of the ‘courtly love’ register: a confession of unsatisfied desire and submission to the domna as a parody of the new ideals of monastic asceticism. * The pseudo-metaphysical register in Farai un vers de dreit nien: an ‘Enigma about Nothingness’ as a parody of the Hyperessence, or immanent naturalism against negative theology. * Conclusion regarding the interwoven registers at the origin of the trobar: the promotion of passion-love in the immanence of the world behind the defensive façade of courtly love. ii. Marcabrú’s trobar brau: the paradox of a moralizing but obscene condemnation of love as a parody of preachers that awakens desire. iii. The courtly trobar or the classic canso in anamorphosis: from confession of a belligerent confrontation over sensory passion to staging of the experience of joi iv. Arnaut Daniel’s trobar clus: concealment and final communication of the gai saber in the arts of the miglior fabbro del parlar materno * The trobar leu and the arrival of the trobar clus: the case of Arnaut Daniel’s trobar ric. * The concealment of meanings in the trobar clus. * Lexicon and images: the dir strano e bello or the subversion of the metaphorical order * Linguistic Marranism and barbarolexia: the Provençal parody of official Latin * Impossible images and dream allegories: subversion of the metaphorical order. * Verbal music: from the sensory materialization of the joi of the world to the experience of pleasure in the arts of delay * Daniel’s characteristic consonance: the song of nature as an invitation to joi * The cobla ‘dissoluta’: the arts of amatory delay, intensification of desire by deferred satisfaction, in the sensory field of rhyme. (Sim fos amors de joi donar tan larga). * The last stage of the trobar (Lo ferm voler qu’el cor m’intra): linguistic, sexual and metaphysical dissemination in the ‘sestina.’ -The involution of the sestina as the final stage of experimentation in the arts of delay of the trobar (mot refranh, rims estrams, permutations). -The linguistic dissemination of the words in the poem: from the banal motifs of courtly love to the martial imagery and sensory experience of the pleasures of delay -The sexual dissemination of images: the pornographic double meaning behind the mask of courtly love -Metaphysical dissemination in the formal device: the imperative of a ‘game of chance’ 4. Explanation. From the foundation of the space of modern lyrical fiction to the synthesis of sound against the totalitarianism of vision i. Sociology of discourse: the forms of meaning of the trobar as the foundation for the sphere of modern lyrical fiction – from concealment of enjoyment in form to promotion of independent enjoyment of form ii. Emancipation of the synthesis of hearing versus the totalitarianism of vision and the diurnal image * The oral forms of meaning of the Romance tongues versus the written Latinitas * From reversal of the hierarchy between material sound and spiritual light to the synthesis of listening vs. the epistemology of vision * The significant detail of the ‘alba’: explicit defense of natural passion in the context of a musical and nocturnal perception that turns away from the diurnal vision of the opponents of joi * Coda. A detective’s art of reading of selective application"
