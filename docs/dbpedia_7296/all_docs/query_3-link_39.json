        "text": "If there’s any truth to trends, it’s that they’re cyclical. And neoclassical architecture remains one of the most prominent examples of this in the world of structural design and construction. “It’s an architecture style that references the rules and the traditions of classicism,” says Daniel Kahan, principal architect at Smith and Moore Architects in Palm Beach, Florida. Sometimes referred to as classical revival, the neoclassical style was part of a prominent movement that emerged in the mid-18th century and sought to reimagine the refined simplicity of the classical era. To learn more about neoclassical design, as well as its history and notable examples, dive into this essential guide from AD.\n\nWhat is Neoclassical architecture?\n\nAccording to Encyclopedia Britannica, neoclassical architecture is defined as the “revival of classical architecture during the 18th and early 19th centuries.” The aesthetic is a distinct architectural style that references elements of classical antiquity—mostly ancient Greek and Roman architecture—that flourished throughout Western countries, particularly in Europe and the United States. “It’s interpreting—and in some cases directly referencing—the rules or principles of order, proportion, [and] scale that were fundamentally the basis of classical architecture.”\n\nNeoclassical buildings typically feature columns, simple geometric forms, a grand scale, and ornamental details—particularly the Doric order—that were popular in ancient Greece and Rome. The style is different from Greek Revival, which was more concerned with reusing certain classical parts. Neoclassicism, on the other hand, was about the full-scale revival of entire classical volumes.\n\nHistory of neoclassical architecture\n\nNeoclassical architecture is often seen as a reaction against Baroque architecture and Rococo style. These buildings, which were popular particularly throughout Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, were highly dramatic and utilized theatric ornamentation. Neoclassicism was born from the desire to approach architectural design more simplistically and in a pared-down way. Generally, the movement is considered to have begun in England and France before spreading throughout the world and was spearheaded by architects such as Robert Adam and John Soane.\n\nMost historians consider 1750 as the start of the neoclassical movement, although some buildings which exemplify neoclassical ideals were designed prior to this. Aside from the shift from ornamented buildings in the Baroque period, archaeologist Sir William Hamilton’s excavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum prompted a renewed interest in classical forms. In what was called the Grand Tour, European aristocrats would visit these cities, inspiring intrigue in these civilizations’ designs.\n\n“To some degree, it all stems back to Andrea Palladio and his Four Books of Architecture,” says Kahan. An Italian architect, Palladio was heavily influenced by Roman and Greek architecture, particularly the work of Vitruvius. A key figure in the Italian renaissance during the 16th century, he’s considered one of the most influential architects in Western design. His writings on the classical orders in I quattro libri dell’architettura were extremely relevant to neoclassicism.\n\nMany countries can trace their neoclassical histories to specific figures and champions of the aesthetic. In Russia, for example, Catherine the Great embraced the style and is largely credited with the breadth of neoclassical work in St. Petersburg. In France, French art students who studied in Rome were catalysts. The writings of German art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann, the first person to define the difference between Greek, Greco-Roman, and Roman art, were also highly influential. The style is often classified in each country by the name of the monarch who was ruling during its emergence. For example, in London, neoclassical design is sometimes referred to as Georgian for George I, George II, George III, and George IV, who reigned in succession from 1714 until 1830.\n\nThe style was important for the young nation of the United States, which didn’t become a country until 26 years into the neoclassical era. Many architects drew the comparison between the recently independent country and imperial Rome, prompting many government buildings to be designed in the style. For this reason, Washington, DC, holds a large collection of neoclassical buildings, including the White House, the US Treasury Building, and the United States Capitol.\n\nWhat was the purpose of neoclassical architecture?\n\nAs Kahan notes, “to some degree, it was a response to Baroque architecture, [which] some maybe felt was a little overboard, but it [was] also a way of getting back to buildings that are inherently pleasing to the body and feel like the right thing.” These innate, involuntary reactions to neoclassical buildings—and original classical buildings—were a primary focus for the ancient Greeks and Romans. With a distinct emphasis on symmetry, proportions, and ratios, the buildings were designed to naturally evoke positive emotions. “All of the details [in classical or neoclassical architecture] have a purpose, and you understand them inherently when you look at them.” In many countries, the style also served as a part of a broader cultural movement in which political leaders sought to rule in a way that emulated the ethos of the ancient Greek and Roman republics.\n\nClassical block buildings, on the other hand, also make use of exterior columns, though they typically have flat roofs. These neoclassical structures are also designed around a square or rectangular floor plan.\n\nDefining elements and characteristics of Neoclassical architecture\n\nThough many buildings may make use of classical elements, these alone don’t necessarily constitute a neoclassical building. “It’s not as simple as saying look for one of the orders,” Kahan explains. “They can be used—and unfortunately they often are used—in inappropriate ways. So you’ve got the vocabulary of classicism without the grammar.” Generally, successful neoclassical buildings not only use elements of classical design, but do so in a similar way to their predecessors. They often honor symmetrical proportion and balance and do so in a refined, simplistic way.\n\nWhat are the characteristics of neoclassical architecture?\n\nTo better understand neoclassical architecture, consider the following elements often present in buildings of the style:\n\nRows of columns. These are often of the Doric order, though Ionic columns and corinthian columns were also used\n\nA grand scale\n\nRectangular or square floor plans\n\nLittle ornamentation\n\nPorticos, friezes, and other elements of Greek and Roman design\n\nDomed, flat, and gable roofs, depending on the style\n\nFamous Examples of Neoclassical Architecture"
