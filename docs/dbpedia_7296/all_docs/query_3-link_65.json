        "text": "“The one way for us to become great, perhaps inimitable, is by imitating the ancients.”\n\nThis quote from one of Winckelmann’s publications is what our blog is all about.\n\nLet me walk you through this quote and the topic we are going to cover.\n\nYou already have an idea that there have been several different movements introduced in the history of art.\n\nAnd you must also be aware of classical art that portrays the image of Greek and Roman history.\n\nBut, in the late 18th century or, you can even say, the early 19th century another art movement was introduced that was somewhat similar to the classics.\n\nCan you guess?\n\nIt was “Neoclassical art.”\n\nBut let me clarify that this art movement was the revival of classical art.\n\nYes, a revival!\n\nA part that captures our mind is why a revival of any art movement?\n\nWhat initially caused this movement to arise?\n\nIs there really a need for such an art movement, or is it just a part of experiments?\n\nWell, all your queries are brought to this one blog.\n\nBy the end, you’ll be familiar with all the aspects of Neoclassical art.\n\nSo, sit back and enjoy the read, which will uncover thousands of realities about Neoclassicism.\n\nWhat is Neoclassical Art?\n\nPeople mostly ask, “What is neoclassical vs. classical art?”\n\nWell, they are not opposite, but instead a continuous art movement with different styles and natures.\n\nDidn’t get me?\n\nAs I’ve mentioned, Neoclassicism was a return to ancient Greco-Roman art.\n\nIn other words, it is an imitation of the classical period with a new meaning.\n\nBut what is the main reason behind the introduction of the neoclassical period or continuing classical art with a new name?\n\nNeoclassicism was not only the outcome of new discoveries of ancient culture and styles but also the rise against the luxurious Baroque and Rococo art movements that already existed.\n\nThe art was to portray the ideas of simplicity and a civilized society.\n\nIf you look at the term “neoclassical,” it originates from the Greek roots (neos), which mean new, young, or fresh, and “classics,” which translates to highest class.\n\nIt was a new movement in art spanning not only some amazing neoclassical paintings but sculptures, decorative furniture, and architecture.\n\nThe movement included four main things that gave rise to Neo-Classical art.\n\nBaroque and Rococo art\n\nWritings of Winckelmann\n\nExcavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum\n\n18th-century Age of Enlightenment\n\nThe main Neoclassical movement conflicts with the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment, also known as the Age of Reasons.\n\nI have explained the entire piece in the next part, which will make you understand it in an elaborate way.\n\nInfluence and Growth of Neoclassicism\n\nThis topic surely needs to be included.\n\nI mean, who were the people or the scenarios that contributed to the growth of the neoclassical movement?\n\nWe already know about the Enlightenment but one of its major supporters is Johann Joachim Winckelmann.\n\nHe was a German art historian and archeologist.\n\nMany also believe that Winckelmann was the father of art history.\n\nThis belief was because of his two publications, “Thoughts on the Imitations of Classical Works in Painting and Sculpture” and “The History of Art in Antiquity.”\n\nHis writings did the magic in contributing to Neo-Classical art.\n\nJohann described the Greek-Roman art culture in the most detailed form in his books.\n\nHe created the first chronological order of classical art.\n\nIn the mid-1700s, he explained how art should aim for simplicity and calmness.\n\nHe also mentioned that the only way we could become great is to bring back the ancients and by this, he meant imitation of classical art.\n\nHis writings made a huge impact on the return of Greek and Roman ideals.\n\nAnother part that influenced the neoclassicism movement were the excavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum.\n\nYou must be wondering how excavations can influence a movement?\n\nCuriosity, my friend, is the key to many inventions.\n\nCuriosity to discover antiquity led to the digging up of many ancient sites.\n\nThe most popular were Pompeii (excavated in 1748) and Herculaneum (excavated in 1738).\n\nThe Grand Tour was a new way to discover antiques, which made it possible throughout Europe.\n\nThe tour included only upper-class men, who brought many souvenirs from their travels.\n\nThe extensively vast collection of art and culture from the classical era illuminated neoclassicism.\n\nThemes, styles, nature—these mold art into a perfect shape.\n\nTo get a view of how neoclassicism is, we surely need to know its features and qualities.\n\nSuggested read: 24 Interesting Renaissance Facts\n\nCharacteristics of Neoclassical Art\n\nQuality is the primary idea used to describe any art movement.\n\nIt narrates all the aspects of art to its admirers.\n\nI’ve already iterated on the simplicity and calmness Neoclassical art possesses.\n\nIf you ask me about the themes of Neoclassical art, I’d reply in just five words:\n\nHarmony\n\nClarity\n\nRestraint\n\nUniversality\n\nAnd Idealism\n\nTo make you understand all of it, let me explain it in a detailed manner.\n\nHonor and Simplicity\n\n“Noble simplicity” is often brought up in Winckelmann’s “Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture” (1750).\n\nHe writes about Greek sculptures and exemplifies them with reference to Raphael paintings, who was one of the best Renaissance painters.\n\nOne primary characteristic of neoclassical art was the return to simplicity and symmetry.\n\nThe harmony in art was the most important feature of Neo-Classical art.\n\nIt is important to note the difference between imitation and copying art.\n\nAll the Neoclassical art is an imitation of classical art.\n\nIt revives the clarity of shapes from the classical period.\n\nLet us visit the mini gallery, which displays the best of Neoclassical art.\n\nSuggested Read: The Death of Socrates\n\n5 Famous Neoclassical Artists and their Arts\n\nTalking about the Neoclassicism period will be incomplete without the famous paintings and the artists who made the era beautiful with their skillful hands.\n\nThere are two famous French painters worth noting when it comes to Neoclassical art—Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain.\n\nThese two artists can also be counted among the influential people who defined neoclassicism.\n\nThey belong to the Baroque era, which makes them the most magnificent Baroque artists of all time.\n\nTheir styles depict classical ideals and historical views from Biblical times.\n\nSome of the famous neoclassicism in art can be seen below.\n\n1. Parnassus by Anton Raphael Mengs\n\nAbout Mengs:\n\nAnton Raphael Mengs was a bohemian painter and ancestor belonging to the neoclassical art style.\n\nEven though he painted in baroque style at various times.\n\nWinckelmann described Mengs as the “greatest” artist of the time.\n\nHe shared values and beliefs with Winckelmann, where Mengs believe in significant classical art.\n\nThey both worked closely together.\n\nAbout Parnassus:\n\nParnassus is one of the well-known works in which Mengs depicts his move towards Neo-Classical art.\n\nThis art was an inspiration by one of Raphael’s frescoes with a similar title, The Parnassus (c. 1509–1511).\n\nThe fresco narrates the story of Apollo (the Sun God), who is surrounded by various muses.\n\nThe art had subdued colors on the robes and clearer lines.\n\nSuggested read: Famous Baroque Paintings\n\n2.
