Designed as a general survey, this course focuses on how French and Italian literature engage with similar cultural phenomena at different moments in their respective histories. For this reason, students study the literary evolution of France and Italy while simultaneously familiarizing themselves with the historical contexts in which these and related artistic movements developed. By the end of the course, students should be able to see how literature engages with the cultural context that produced it, both mirroring this context and acting as a powerful agent of cultural change. 388 • Allison Stedman SYLLABUS Week 1 Introduction; Courtly Love: France Day 1 Introduction Day 2 Roger Price, A Concise History of France, 13–23, 30–48 Marie de France: Lais; Prologue, “Lanval” (to p. 76) Week 2 Courtly Love: France (cont.)
