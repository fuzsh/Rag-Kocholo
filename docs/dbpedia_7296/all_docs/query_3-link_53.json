        "text": "Last month, I shared a list of 25 artists from the 1800s to include in your Picture Study time. I received such a positive response to the post that I thought I might offer up another list of artists from the 1700s, which I’m posting today!\n\nAs I mentioned last month, these are certainly not the only ones to explore, nor is it necessary to include every single one. These are, however, some of the ones I’ve enjoyed learning more about either in my college classes or later on as I have pursued more art history knowledge on my own.\n\nI’ve again tried to include a good range of styles, nationalities, and perspectives; however, if you see an artist you feel should be listed here, feel free to leave a comment below!\n\nThe Artists\n\nJeong Seon (Gyeomjae)\n\nNationality: Korean\n\nMovement: True-View Painting (Joseon Period)\n\nJeong Seon (Gyeomjae) (1676-1759) is one of the most well-known painters from this time in Korean history, and his landscape paintings, in particular, are beautiful examples of Korean “true-view painting.” This movement emphasized painting from life rather than more abstractly or creating scenes from one’s imagination, and is especially associated with Korea’s unique identity.\n\nAntoine Watteau\n\nNationality: French\n\nMovement: Rococo\n\nAntoine Watteau (1684-1721) is credited with being the father of the Rococo movement. In 1717, he submitted the painting above to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, however, they were unsure to which genre it belonged and ended up giving it its own classification of fête galante (“courtship party”). In turn, this piece inspired the growth of the Rococo movement in France. Though he isn’t necessarily the most well-known artist of the Rococo period (he died at age 37, so who knows what might have happened had he lived longer!), I feel that his paintings represent it well.\n\nTobias Stranover\n\nNationality: German (Transylvania)\n\nMovement: Baroque\n\nTobias Stranover (1684-1756) primarily made still lifes and nature paintings. Though not well-known outside of the world of art history, his paintings are very detailed and would be good options for picture study.\n\nGiovanni Paolo Panini\n\nNationality: Italian\n\nMovement: Baroque\n\nPanini (1691-1765) was also an architect, which is evident in his many large-scale paintings (vedute) of landscapes and buildings, particularly those from antiquity. He also painted scenes from history and the Bible.\n\nMiguel Cabrera\n\nNationality: Mexican\n\nMovement: Baroque\n\nMiguel Cabrera (1695-1768) painted both religious and secular art and is known for his casta paintings of families that included European and indigenous ancestry. He was very popular in Mexico during his lifetime.\n\nGiovanni Battista Tiepolo\n\nNationality: Italian (Venetian)\n\nMovement: Rococo\n\nTiepolo’s (1696-1770) paintings, and particularly his frescos, are majestic. They are majestic and sweeping and awe-inspiring. Though he is technically considered a Rococo painter, his style and subject matter was somewhat different than the French Rococo painters.\n\nGiovanni Antonio Canal (Canaletto)\n\nNationality: Italian (Venetian)\n\nMovement: Baroque\n\nCanaletto (1697-1768), as with Panini, is another artist known for his city views (vedute) of both Italian and British subjects. His paintings are highly detailed and are an excellent record of what a given town or place looked like during his lifetime.\n\nJean Siméon Chardin\n\nNationality: French\n\nMovement: Baroque\n\nJean Siméon Chardin (1699-1779) is known for his still lifes and genre paintings. His work features muted lighting and domestic scenes with women and children.\n\nJean-Étienne Liotard\n\nNationality: Swiss\n\nMovement: Rococo\n\nJean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789) was a portraitist who spent the majority of his life in Switzerland. His pieces are highly-detailed and have an almost photographic quality to them.\n\nYosa Buson\n\nNationality: Japanese\n\nMovement: Edo Period\n\nYosa Buson (1716-1784) is known for being both an artist and a poet. He was active during the Japanese Edo Period and incorporated his poetry into his art in the haiga style, but I think his nature paintings are particularly beautiful.\n\nÉtienne Maurice Falconet\n\nNationality: French\n\nMovement: Neoclassicism (Sculpture)\n\nÉtienne-Maurice Falconet (1716-1791) is a good option if you’re looking for alternative media like sculpture. He is most well-known for the sculpture above in St. Petersburg, but he also made many smaller sculptures.\n\nItō Jakuchū\n\nNationality: Japanese\n\nMovement: Edo Period\n\nItō Jakuchū (1716-1800) was another Japanese artist from the Edo period. He is known for his highly-detailed and realistic nature paintings, especially those of birds.\n\nJoshua Reynolds\n\nNationality: English\n\nMovement: Rococo\n\nSir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792) is one of the most well-known English portraitists of the 18th century, though he also painted other subjects.\n\nThomas Gainsborough\n\nNationality: English\n\nMovement: Rococo\n\nThomas Gainsborough (1727-1788) is another giant in the world of 18th-century English portraiture, though he also painted landscapes as well.\n\nAnton Raphael Mengs\n\nNationality: Bohemian\n\nMovement: Neoclassicism\n\nAnton Raphael Mengs (1728-1779) is credited as one of the first neoclassical painters when Rococo was still very popular. He started in portraiture but later moved to frescoes of events and people from antiquity.\n\nHubert Robert\n\nNationality: French\n\nMovement: Romanticism\n\nHubert Robert (1733-1808) is known for his landscapes, usually featuring ruins of some kind. He is sometimes referred to as “Robert des Ruines” because of this.\n\nJoseph Wright of Derby\n\nNationality: English\n\nMovement: Neoclassicism\n\nJoseph Wright (1734-1797) was a master of tenebrism. The first time I saw the above painting, I was completely fascinated by his use of light and how perfectly he captured it. Most of his paintings have this quality and would be excellent for picture study.\n\nJohn Singleton Copley\n\nNationality: American (also active in England)\n\nMovement: Neoclassicism\n\nJohn Singleton Copley (1738-1815) began his career in America as a portraitist and earned a very positive reputation for his skill. He later moved to England, where he continued portraiture before venturing into the world of history paintings. (His “Nativity” is included in my Advent Art Devotions Volume IV.)\n\nBenjamin West\n\nNationality: American (active in England)\n\nMovement: Neoclassicism\n\nBenjamin West (1738-1820) painted into the 19th century but was most active in the 18th century. He was born in America but moved to Europe in his 20s and spent most of his life in England. He is known for his history paintings.\n\nAngelica Kauffman\n\nNationality: Swiss\n\nMovement: Neoclassicism\n\nAngelica Kauffman (1741-1807) was born in Switzerland but was active throughout Europe, especially in Italy and England. She is known for her portraits and history paintings.\n\nFrancisco Goya\n\nNationality: Spanish\n\nMovement: Romanticism\n\nFrancisco Goya (1746-1828) is another artist who was active in the 18th and 19th centuries. His oeuvre includes a wide range of subjects, but he is mainly known for his depictions of significant events in Spain during his lifetime. Some of his pieces are very graphic, but he also painted beautiful genre, religious, and portrait pieces.\n\nJacques-Louis David\n\nNationality: French\n\nMovement: Neoclassicism\n\nDavid (1748-1825) was the quintessential Neoclassical artist, and no list of 18th-century artists would be complete without him. He is most well-known for his portraits (a few of Napoleon) and history paintings, including depictions of significant events in France during his lifetime.\n\nElisabeth Vigée Le Brun\n\nNationality: French\n\nMovement: Rococo\n\nElisabeth Vigée Le Brun (1755-1842) was the official portrait painter of Marie Antoinette and made many paintings of the queen and other French nobles. She escaped France at the beginning of the Revolution and eventually made her way to Russia, where she also painted portraits of the Russian royal family. (I also wrote about Vigée Le Brun in Volume 2, Issue 3 of Common Place Quarterly.)\n\nJohn Trumbull\n\nNationality: American\n\nMovement: Neoclassicism\n\nJohn Trumbull (1756-1843) painted many scenes of events during the American Revolution. He was alive during this period, but some of the paintings were not commissioned until the early 19th century, so his oeuvre is also a mix of these two centuries. He also painted portraits of Revolutionary leaders.\n\nAntonio Canova\n\nNationality: Italian (Venetian)\n\nMovement: Neoclassicism\n\nAntonio Canova (1757-1822), a well-known Italian sculptor, rounds out the list. His sculptures of primarily women are simple but beautiful."
