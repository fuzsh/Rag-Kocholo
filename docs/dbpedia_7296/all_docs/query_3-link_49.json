        "text": "The difference between neoclassicism and romanticism\n\nNeoclassicism and romanticism are frequently viewed as reactionary movements that arose from different historical periods. The principle distinction between neoclassicism and romanticism is that neoclassicism focuses on objectivity, reason, and Intellect. While romanticism stresses on human creativity, nature, and emotions or feelings.\n\nThe romanticism movement has influenced various topics, styles, and themes. Neoclassicism pays respect to the old-style of Greece and Roman art periods.\n\nWhat is Romanticism in writing?\n\nRomanticism in the writing usually focuses on an individual(s) and the creative aspect of the character as opposed to the current social norms.\n\nNeoclassicism Vs Romanticism Table\n\nWhat Is Neoclassicism?\n\nNeoclassicism is a movement that drew motivation from the classical Greek/Roman age. The scholars of this period attempted to emulate the style of Greeks and Romans. Neoclassicism was a response against the renaissance, which was between 1660 and 1798.\n\nNeoclassical Authors\n\nJohn Milton\n\nAlexander Pope\n\nVoltaire\n\nJohn Dryden\n\nJonathan Swift\n\nDaniel Defoe\n\nNeoclassicism depended on traditional topics: Structure, rationality, and objectivity were the primary highlights of neoclassical writing. These were old topics that neoclassical authors appreciated and endeavored to emulate.\n\nThis Neoclassicism movement can be partitioned into three periods:\n\nThe Restoration Age (1660 to 1700): This period denotes the British King's rebuilding their position of authority.\n\nThe Augustan Age (1700 to 1750): The Augustans accepted that their period was like that of Augustus Ceaser in Rome, which was a time of refinement and purity.\n\nThe Age of Johnson (1750 to 1798): Also called the Age of Transition, this period was set apart by the up and coming romantic beliefs which impacted the neoclassical standards to be more sentimental.\n\nNeoclassical School\n\nThe School Of David - The Art School of Athens\n\nThe painting was painted by Italian Renaissance artist Raphael. However, it was created in a neoclassical style.\n\nNeoclassical art increased in popularity with the extraordinary painting of David's Oath of the Horatii which was displayed at the Paris Salon of 1785.\n\nOath of the Horatii by Jacques-Louis David\n\nThe painting caused a phenomenal reaction in the art world. David was declared as an neoclassical artists who accurately presented the characteristics of the Neoclassical style in his paintings. David is among one of the quintessential painters who helped develop and promote the neoclassical style. Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres was another Neoclassical painter who symbolically painted historical settings and was one of David's apprentices. Some of his works that incorporate the neoclassical style are: Virgil Reading to Augustus (1812), and Oedipus and the Sphinx (1864). Both David and Ingres utilized symbolism and fables in their neoclassical paintings during the eighteenth century.\n\nWhile some prominent art school like the Académie Française banished women from the Neoclassical style. David accepted that women were talented enough to learn the style and invited numerous women to be his understudies. Among the best were Marie-Guillemine Benoist, who in the end won commissions from the Bonaparte family; and Angélique Mongez, who got world wide recognition for her neoclassical style, especially in Russia.\n\nFemale Neoclassical Artists\n\nMarie-Guillemine Benoist\n\nAngélique Mongez\n\nDid Neoclassicism Influence Romanticism?\n\nNo, the French Revolution influenced Romanticism. Romanticism was a rebellious movement against the social and political standards of the Age of Enlightenment.\n\nRomanticism legitimized the individuals' creative mind as the basis of power. And gave the opportunity for artists to use Greek/Roman ideas of structure in their creativity.\n\nCharacteristics Of Neoclassicism\n\nAs stated before, the characteristics of Neoclassicism incorporate a focus on Greek and Roman folklore, historical subjects, and brave heroes. The influence of neoclassicism is evident in paintings, sculptures, and writings. Neoclassical arts: are characterized by clear purposeful lines, solid concrete structures, and rationality.\n\nNeoclassical Artists\n\nJacques-Louis David\n\nJean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres\n\nAntonio Canova\n\nWilliam-Adolphe Bouguereau\n\nJacques-Louis David\n\nThe art of Jacques-Louis David thrived in France during the late eighteenth and mid-nineteenth hundreds.

Such as King Louis XVI's execution during the French Revolution and the fall of Napoleon's rule.\n\nJacques-Louis David Paintings\n\nJean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres\n\nJean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres was a French painter who advocated neoclassicism during a period that saw the ascent of Romantic painters like Eugène Delacroix. He rendered compositions with exact shapes. Jupiter and Thetis (1811) is a classical painting by Ingres; and it showcases Ingres's eagerness to misshape the human figure and display the structure and organization that is rendered by neoclassicism.\n\nAntonio Canova\n\nAntonio Canova was an Italian Neoclassical sculptor, well known for his marble figures.

Bouguereau learned at the École des Beaux-Arts. He endeavored to influence Renaissance painters like Titian, he was granted the esteemed price of Prix de Rome in 1850. Bouguereau's life-sized oil paintings of fanciful accounts were profoundly expressive. With definite brushstrokes and a nuanced tonal style, his neoclassical art was a contradiction to his peers, the French Impressionists.\n\nAdolphe William Bouguereau Paintings\n\nWhat Is Romanticism?\n\nRomanticism is an abstract movement that started around 1789. The fundamental elements of this movement is its accentuation on the creative mind, subjectivity, inspiration, and human emotions. The Romantic movement drew motivation from Medieval and Baroque periods and its primary topics were nature, life, and love.\n\nWilliam Wordsworth who is an English Romantic poet describes this 'accentuation on the creative mind':\n\n“Tis more to guide than spur the Muse’s Steed;\n\nRestrain his Fury, than provoke his Speed;\n\nThe winged Courser, like a gen’rous Horse,\n\nShows most true Mettle when you check his Course”\n\nBelow are some of the acclaimed scholars of the Romantic Movement.\n\nRomantic Writers\n\nWilliam Wordsworth\n\nJohn Keats\n\nLord Byron\n\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge\n\nWalter Scott\n\nPercy Bysshe Shelley\n\nMary Shelly\n\nWilliam Blake\n\nGerman Sturm und Drang Movement\n\nRomanticism was propelled by the German Sturm und Drang (Storm and Stress) movement, which valued instinct and feeling over realism. This proto-romantic movement began in Germany and paved the way for romanticism. It focused on writing, music, and human visual expressions. The movement underlined singular subjectivity.
