        "text": "The Fame of Dante in Italy and Worldwide\n\nDante and the Cult of the “Romantic Genius”\n\nIn the 18th century, a new sensibility emerged around Dante. Voltaire endorsed his poetry as “bizarre, but gleaming with natural beauties” (1756) and the educational rite of passage known as the Grand Tour began to include Dante. In 1778, Philip Yorke, nephew of an English earl, wrote from Rome that his Italian chaperone had assigned to him the reading of a very strange, still untranslated poem called “L’Inferno”.\n\nThe Romantics were fascinated with the Middle Ages. In the fictional Last letters of Jacopo Ortis (1798–1802), the Italian poet Ugo Foscolo complained about the “irreligious” disrespect towards Petrarch’s tomb Arquà, contrasting with the new monument built over Dante’s tomb in Ravenna, in 1780. Dante was now seen as the ultimate Romantic genius: an artist on the one hand, absolutely original and uncompromising and, on the other hand, receptive to both the sublimity of nature and the soul of the nation. Lord Byron celebrated his pilgrimage to the tomb of Dante’s beloved Beatrice in Santa Croce church (Childe Harrow, 1817.)\n\nThe development of literary tourism and the production of memorabilia boosted the cult of Dante. Visiting Italy in 1852, Sara Jane Lippincott, a member of the New York literary society, wrote: “We drove to Dante’s stone, a slab of marble by the side of the way, on which he used to sit in the long summer evenings, rapt in mournful meditations, and dreaming his immortal dreams.”"
