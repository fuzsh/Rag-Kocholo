At his deathbed, his confessor desired him, by way of penance, to acknowledge the superiority of Ariosto. ‚ÄúFather,‚Äù answered the dying man, ‚Äúto tell the truth, I never read either Dante or Ariosto.‚Äù Fun fact: He fought 14 duels over both the poets, only to admit on his deathbed that he hadn't even read either poet! This anecdote sums up that many people who love to debate, especially those who debate online and are often strongly opinionated and defensive about their views, haven't actually researched the topic thoroughly, haven't read or experienced the subject matter first-hand, and haven't considered multiple perspectives. They are mostly parroting what others have said or replying to second-hand information, usually driven by bias or ego. This encourages us to be more humble and open-minded rather than overly opinionated. Also, be informed in our discussions, especially online.\n\nIn Ecopoetic Place-Making, Judith Rauscher analyzes the works of five contemporary American poets of migration, drawing from ecocriticism and mobility studies. The poets discussed in her study challenge exclusionary notions of place-attachment and engage in ecopoetic place-making from different perspectives of mobility, testifying to the potential of poetry as a means of conceptualizing alternative environmental imaginaries for our contemporary world on the move. https://amzn.to/4eEDBmj\n\nAn author, Freemason, and poet, Oscar Wilde is one of the greatest writers of the modern era. Throughout the course of his life he explored the higher meaning of life, through his work and art.

Rilke‚Äôs guidance is an invitation to have a bias towards action, to experience contrast, to try, fail, learn and try again, to have appreciation for the process that is unfolding. Full reflections on substack:\n\nThe great Polish poet Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz said: be happy if you have never opened Marx‚Äôs books because what they will do to you is unpredictable. Read Mi≈Çosz's book The Captive Mind (1953). It is wonderful; also read his poems. His book attempts to explain the allure of Stalinism to intellectuals, and its adherents' thought processes. The book opens by exploring Witkiewicz's dystopian novel, \"Insatiability\". In this story, a revived Mongol Empire conquers Poland and introduces Murti-Bing pills as a cure for independent thought. At first, the pills create contentment and blind obedience, but ultimately lead those taking them to develop dual personalities. Mi≈Çosz draws a parallel between these pills and the stifling impact of Marxism-Leninism in the USSR and Eastern Bloc countries. It's very interesting. If you're a thoughtful person, you'll find its analysis and criticisms of the cultural and psychological machinery of Communism to be thought-provoking. https://lnkd.in/dV6FsWdg\n\nHere is your \"QuoteAction\" of the day: \"He who cannot forgive others destroys the bridge over which he himself must pass, 17th Century Poet, George Herbert Your action for today is to think of someone who has hurt you and determine when you can forgive them.
