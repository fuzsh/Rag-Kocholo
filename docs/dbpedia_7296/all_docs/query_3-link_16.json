        "text": "“Drawing is the honesty of art. To draw does not mean simply to reproduce contours: drawing does not consist merely of line. Drawing is also expression, the inner form, the plane and modeling.”\n\nThis quote by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres best explains the essence of neoclassical paintings!\n\nArtworks from this era have always enthralled art admirers—the credit goes to its grace and intricate expression.\n\nBut how much do you know about neoclassical art?\n\nTo put it in simple terms, Neoclassical art was the attempt to bring a new era of paintings, and revive Greek and Roman art!\n\nThis rediscovery paved the way to producing a variety of neoclassical paintings that made a compelling influence in the art world.\n\nWant to see some of these breathtaking paintings and learn more about neoclassicism?\n\nBelow, I have curated a listicle of neoclassical paintings and shared a brief history of their origin.\n\nBut before we get into the artworks, let me give you a brief understanding of the Neoclassicism movement and how the period unfolded!\n\nWhat is Neoclassicism?\n\nTo understand neoclassical art, you need to first understand the Neoclassicism movement and what it stands for.\n\nLet us break down the term “neoclassical”, shall we?\n\n“Neo” is derived from a Greek word; “neos” which means new, young, or fresh.\n\nWhereas, “classical” is derived from a Latin word, “classicus” which translates to highest rank or highest class.\n\nHere “classical” indicates the era where the Roman and Greek flourished in their way of life— that included art too!\n\nBut then, why Neoclassicism?\n\nThe Neoclassical era came with new discoveries, grandeur; a new style bringing unity in art!\n\nBut they were also a movement that came to dismiss the luxuriousness the Baroque and Rococo movements brought!\n\nThis new era came and developed a new perspective–the revival of Roman and Greek art and architecture.\n\nThe time frame of Neoclassicism was from around the middle of the 18th century to all through the 19th century.\n\nThe focus of all neoclassical paintings is on how the class of the painting is handled.\n\nBe it the hues used, the brush stroke style, small details, or other painting techniques— they all together made sure the painting delivered had grandeur and grace!\n\nNow that we have an idea of what Neoclassicism stands for, let us dive into the list of paintings from the era.\n\nSuggested Read: Famous Baroque Paintings\n\n1. Parnassus (1761)\n\nParnassus is a neoclassical painting made by Anton Raphael Mengs.\n\nThe literal meaning of “Parnassus” is “the world of poetry or poets collectively”, which is beautifully depicted by the artist!\n\nBreaking away from the Baroque traditions, neoclassical style and technique have been incorporated into art .\n\nThis particular painting was done with oil paint on canvas, but it was inspired by the fresco version of Parnassus, by the artist himself.\n\nThe painting depicts the Greek God Apollo at the center and around him the other figures are his muses.\n\nMeng’s neoclassical artwork influenced many across Italy and made neoclassicism famous at the time!\n\n2. The Death of General Wolfe (1770)\n\nThe artist of this neoclassical painting is Benjamin West, who was famous for painting historical events.\n\nThe Death of General Wolfe is one such painting that portrays the scene from the Battle of Quebec!\n\nIf you notice closely, this painting makes a stellar example for neoclassical art because of the way the faces are painted.\n\nThe pale faces here have a certain glow, almost brightened like Christ’s face.\n\nWest brilliantly depicts the drama that happens on the battlefield, while showing the respectful spirit of martyrdom with General Wolfe’s death!\n\nWest showed characters in uniforms which were contemporary then, which raised many eyebrows, leading it to become a controversial painting!\n\nBut this also unlocked a new path for contemporary historical paintings, thanks to West!\n\nSuggested Read: The Death Of Socrates\n\n3. Oath of the Horatii (1784)\n\nNeoclassical artist Jacques Louis David is one of the pioneers of the Neoclassicism movement.\n\nThis particular neoclassical painting, Oath of Horatii, depicts a Roman legend.\n\nThe legend demonstrates a story of two cities at war— Rome and Alba Longa.\n\nAccording to the legend, each city sends three warriors for a fight instead of the whole army going for war.\n\nThe figures we see in the painting are the Roman Horatii family!\n\nThey stand with their hands extended as a symbol of respect.\n\nNow the brilliance of the artist is shown in how the painting is balanced by keeping the converging point of the swords in the center!\n\nAlso, the neoclassical artist is trying to convey vital qualities of a true warrior— duty, loyalty, patriotism, and solidarity!\n\nIt is impossible to overlook the women and children in the background.\n\nThey are shown in grief because they are often the victims of war.\n\nWhile the soldiers display courage and patriotism, the figures in the background display despair and helplessness!\n\n4. Cornelia. Mother of the Gracchi, Pointing to her Children as Her Treasures (1785)\n\nThis neoclassical painting by Angelica Kauffman, has the magic of motherhood written all over it!\n\nKauffman depicts the principles of Neoclassicism in the way she clothed the subjects in her painting.\n\nBoth women are draped in ancient Roman clothing, with flowing fabric and vibrant, bright colors!\n\nEven Cornelia’s children are clothed in the same manner, even wearing leather sandals, indicating the classic Roman period.\n\nThis neoclassical art’s meaning is in fact explained by a story, where the woman in red shows off her exquisite jewels.\n\nMeanwhile, Cornelia points at her children and states that the greatest treasures of her life are her children!\n\nWhat I personally admire about Kauffman’s artwork is that a lot of times women are central in her paintings!\n\nBecause she made sure her artworks are around women, as it was an era where every painter would show men in most heroic acts.\n\n5. Virgil Writing His Epitaph at Brundisi (1785)\n\nWe have yet another neoclassical painting by Angelica Kauffman, titled Virgil Writing His Epitaph at Brundisi.\n\nKauffman was undoubtedly one of the most famous female artists of her times, and her neoclassical artworks were highly influential!\n\nIn addition, the neoclassical art characteristics stand out in this painting as the artist skillfully moves away from the Rococo style.\n\nInstead, the subject portrayed is painted in more somber colors, with a strain of melancholy looming over the painting!\n\n6. King Lear Weeping Over the Dead Body of Cordelia (1788)\n\nThis neoclassical painting is part of Alderman Boydell’s Shakespeare Gallery collection.\n\nThis art piece is in fact a sad painting showing King Lear holding the corpse of his daughter Cordelia, and mourning her death!\n\nThe agony and despair of losing his daughter is a heart wrenching sight that the artist Barry has depicted so well!\n\nFor the painting, Barry followed the neoclassical art styles, especially the Greek style, in which the colors and contours are precisely used.\n\n7. Self-Portrait With Her Daughter (1789)\n\nSelf-Portrait With Her Daughter is one of Le Brun’s best works from the neoclassical art period.\n\nAlthough this painting seems to exhibit some of the Rococo style, it still showcases many elements of neoclassical art characteristics!\n\nEspecially in the ways the artist played with shadows, and how both their bodies in embrace form a triangular pyramid silhouette.\n\nEven if you look at their faces, the expressions are natural and loveable showcasing an intimate moment shared between the daughter and mother!\n\nThe artist has kept the background of this painting empty to point out something particularly- the subjects!\n\nBecause the focus here is on the subjects in the painting, who are dressed in ancient Greek clothing.\n\nThe painting is rather a heartwarming piece, with the artist’s daughter lovingly clinging onto her mother’s neck!\n\n8. The Death of Marat (1793)\n\nThe Death of Marat is a neoclassical painting by Jacques Louis David, which was painted during the French Revolution.\n\nJean-Paul Marat was a French Revolutionary leader, who was murdered, and the painting shows a rather painful sight.\n\nTo emphasize, his bloodied body is seen lying lifeless over his bath.\n\nWe can also see his hands still clutching onto a letter and a quill!\n\nUniquely the painting shows neoclassical characteristics but also depicts accuracy with historical event and elements of realism!\n\nThe hues used in the painting balance off the melancholy of the scene, specifically showing the martyrs of the Revolution.\n\n9. The Turkish Bath (1862)\n\nThis famous neoclassical painting was created by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres.\n\nThe Turkish Bath is a nude painting depicting several women taking a bath in their harem, standing and sitting in different poses.\n\nSources say that Igres had used several motifs and inspirations while creating this masterpiece.\n\nThis included the women in the painting too, as they were inspired by his previous works and not by live models.\n\nThe positioning of each woman is done so thoughtfully, as they just seem to fall into place, forming a circle, which was Ingres’s intention!\n\n10. The Birth of Venus (1879)\n\nThe Birth of Venus is one of the most famous neoclassical paintings by William-Adolphe Bouguereau!\n\nThe painting shows a scene from Roman Mythology, depicting the story of Venus.\n\nAs a matter of fact, this painting screams neoclassical style from the way it’s drawn, to the colors used to paint to completion!\n\nAt the center of the artwork, you can see Venus, a naked, mature woman, standing in a shell that has in fact come from the ocean.\n\nThis, in fact, is not the first time someone has painted The Birth of Venus.\n\nIf you trace back to the Renaissance period, you will find another version of the same painting by Sandro Botticelli’s, which was used as inspiration!\n\nSuggested Read: Renaissance Facts\n\n11.
