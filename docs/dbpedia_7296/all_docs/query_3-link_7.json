        "text": "What is Neoclassicism?\n\nFirst, let’s define Neoclassicism\n\nNeoclassicism is an important style to understand for writers, filmmakers, artists, and architects. Why? Because it changes how we think about classical art. And not just classical art as in “Greek and Roman art” but all art that we consider classical. For more, check out our index of art styles covering more specific and noteworthy movements.\n\nFor more on the basic ideas behind Neoclassicism, check out this quick video from Phil Hansen.\n\nWhat is Neoclassicism? • Neoclassicism Art – Overview from Phil Hansen\n\nWe’re going to cover some Neoclassicism examples in a bit, but first let’s quickly define Neoclassicism.\n\nNEOCLASSICISM DEFINITION\n\nWhat is Neoclassicism?\n\nNeoclassicism was an art movement that sought to evoke the style of classical antiquity in writing, painting, sculpting, and architecture found in Greek and Roman culture. Neoclassicism was most popular between the late 18th century and early 19th century. But its influence still reverberates throughout the art world today.\n\nPopular Neoclassical Artists & Famous Works\n\nJacques-Louis David – Oath of the Horatii (1784), The Death of Socrates (1787), and The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons (1789).\n\nAntonio Canova – Theseus and the Minotaur (1781-1782), Venus Victrix (1808), The Three Graces (1814-1817).\n\nAngelica Kauffmann – Portrait of Winckelmann (1764), Self-portrait (1770-1775), Telemachus and the Nymphs of Calypso (1782).\n\nThe Neoclassicism Era Explained\n\nWhen did Neoclassicism start?\n\nNeoclassicism took off around 1760 due to a growing dissatisfaction with the gaudy baroque art style and the emergence of archaeological findings by German pioneer Johann Joachim Winckelmann.\n\nLet’s break down these two points in further detail.\n\nFirst: the death of the baroque art style. The baroque art style was founded to contrast classical antiquity. Classical art was simple and sleek; baroque art was intricate and ostentatious.\n\nHere’s a quick history of the baroque style from Phil Hansen.\n\nBefore the Neoclassicism Time Period • Baroque Overview by Phil Hansen\n\nThe baroque era served an important role in art history, but over time, people got tired of the style and figured, “why not go back to the classics?”\n\nSecond: archeological discoveries. German historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann did more to advance Neoclassicism than perhaps anybody else. Not through his own artwork, but through his discovery of ancient art and architecture. Here’s a video on Winckelmann from Accessible Art History.\n\nWhat is Neoclassicism? • Founders of Art History: Johann Joachim Winckelmann\n\nWinckelmann revealed the discovery of Pompeii to the masses — and the people loved it. In fact, they loved it so much that they wondered why settlements two millennia old looked better than the ones they currently lived in. So, they pushed for a return to classical antiquity, and thus the Neoclassical era was born.\n\nNeoclassicism Artists\n\nMost famous Neoclassical artists\n\nThere aren’t many Neoclassical artists with the name cache of Da Vinci or Caravaggio. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t a lot of great Neoclassical artists. Quite the contrary, in fact, many of the most famous Neoclassical artists are regarded as preeminent leaders of their era.\n\nLet’s take a look at a few of the most famous neoclassical artists.\n\nJacques-Louis David\n\nDavid was a French painter who's credited as a leading figure in the Neoclassical movement. David’s 1784 painting Oath of the Horatii is considered a masterpiece of the Neoclassicism style.\n\nNeoclassicism Paintings • Oath of the Horatii by Jacques-Louis David\n\nDavid commissioned dozens of Neoclassical works during his time as France’s resident maestro, but none were as revered as Oath of the Horatii.\n\nAntonio Canova\n\nCanova was an Italian sculptor and plenipotentiary of the Catholic Church. His sculpted works (most notably of which were Psyche Revived by Cupid’s Kiss and Venus Victrix) received international acclaim throughout Europe.\n\nNeoclassicism Art • Psyche Revived by Cupid’s Kiss by Antonio Canova\n\nCanova served as a European authority on Neoclassical sculpting until his death in 1822.\n\nAngelica Kauffmann\n\nKauffmann was a Swiss painter and founding member of the Royal Academy. Kauffmann painted a wide breadth of subjects, including historical landscapes and portraits. Perhaps one of her most famous works was a portrait of Johann Joachim Winckelmann (as seen below).\n\nNeoclassicism Characteristics Art • Johann Joachim Winckelmann Portrait by Angelica Kauffmann\n\nHer legacy lives on today in the eponymous world-famous Angelika Kauffmann Museum, which is located in Schwarzenberg, Vorarlberg (Austria).\n\nRevival of the Neoclassicism Definition\n\nWhy did Neoclassicism end?\n\nNeoclassicism didn’t end in quite as spectacular a fashion as its predecessor, but it did diminish in popularity over time. Architecture has been perhaps the most enduring form of Neoclassicism; one which still pervades the world today.\n\nThe Schermerhorn Symphony Center in Nashville, Tennessee, constructed in 2006, is a great example of the continued legacy of Neoclassical architecture.\n\nNeoclassicism Art • Schermerhorn Symphony Center in Nashville, Tennessee"
