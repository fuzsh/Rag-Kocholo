But also, I would tell you that since infancy I have loved to create. Drawing, writing, photographing, putting down creative thoughts. Forcing myself to be able to leave a mark on the world. And I know, I am no Artist, but I have always seen art as the exit wound to the problem. The caveat, the “I could settle for this”. A way of forever moving through time.\n\nCommunication and Love as Recipe for Immortality"
