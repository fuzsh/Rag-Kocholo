Romanticism was an artistic and intellectual movement that originated in Europe in the late 18th century. It emphasized emotion and individualism in reaction to Enlightenment rationalism. Romanticism valued nature, medievalism, spontaneity, and the imagination of the individual artist. It had a major influence on art, music, literature, and the growth of nationalism through the 19th century before declining with the spread of realism and nationalism.",
