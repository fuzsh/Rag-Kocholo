        "text": "The Neoclassical art period reached its height in the late 18th and early 19th century. Born in Rome, the movement spread throughout Europe and the United States. It was a return to ancient Greek and Roman art characteristics and ideals. Therefore, Neoclassical art portrayed the ideas of simplicity, reason, order, virtue and civilized society.\n\nThis article covers four important things that led to the Neoclassical art period. And in addition, the main characteristics of the art during this time.\n\nHow did the Neoclassical art period start?\n\nThere are four main things that led to the Neoclassical art movement:\n\nA pushback on the Baroque and Rococo art movements\n\nWritings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann\n\nExcavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum in Italy\n\nThe 18th century Age of Enlightenment\n\n1. Neoclassicism – A pushback on Baroque and Rococo\n\nThe two preceding art movements to Neoclassicism are Baroque and Rococo. The Baroque art movement lasted approximately 150 years from 1600 to 1750. It was full of drama, emotion, and tension.\n\nNext, the Rococo or Late Baroque art movement started in the early 1700s and lasted until the mid-to-late 1700s. Rococo built was similar to Baroque, but was more fun and frivolous. Therefore, it’s not surprising that Rococo turned its attention away from the church and Christian themes. The art became more hedonistic in a way.\n\nThe Neoclassical art movement follows Baroque and Rococo in the late 1700s. In many ways, it was a push back to the gaudy, frivolous, and over-the-top nature of these previous movements. In fact, some of the leading figures of Neoclassicism fought against the leaders of Rococo and the French aristocracy. So, Neoclassicism art shows a stark contrast to the preceding art. It was full of simplicity, reason, and a return to order and virtue.\n\n2. Writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann\n\nYou can’t talk about the Neoclassical art movement without mentioning the writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann. He was a German art historian and archaeologist. In fact, many people believe he was the father of art history. As an art historian myself, thanks for getting us started Wincklemann!\n\nHis writings from the mid-1700s were a deep dive into the ideals of Roman and Greek art. Winckelmann believed that art should aim for “noble simplicity and calm grandeur”. And that the only way for us to become great is to imitate the ancients. These writings had a huge impact on our return to Greek and Roman ideals, especially in art.\n\n3. Excavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum\n\nIn the mid 1730s and 40s, the real excavations of the ancient cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum began. These excavations included the discovery of Roman art and architecture, which revived the study of Greek and Roman art. In fact, Rome was a major stop for The Grand Tour – a traditional trip taken by European upper-class men once they reach the age of 21. This stop on The Grand Tour helped spread Neoclassicism from Rome to other parts of Europe\n\n4. The 18th century Age of Enlightenment\n\nFinally, the Neoclassical art period coincided with the 18th century Age of Enlightenment. This philosophical movement valued science and reason. It was a main driver of the Industrial Revolution. The ideals of individual liberty, religious tolerance, and constitutional governments were pushed. Therefore, Neoclassical artists were inspired by these ideas. They portrayed art that was civilized, reasonable, and contributed to a more orderly society.\n\nNeoclassical art period characteristics\n\nWith the background of these four things that led up to the Neoclassical movement, it’s a little bit easier to understand the art and architecture styles of this period. As well as everything else already mentioned, the characteristics of art during this time were serious, symmetrical, orderly, virtuous, and heroic. The art often depicted characteristics from classical history, as well as political, philosophical, and religious leaders who were important to the time. The architecture became more simple and less ornate than Baroque and Rococo architecture.\n\nAlthough some may find Neoclassical art boring, I think you can find a lot of beauty in the classic nature of the Roman and Greek art characteristics. Even though there is generally less drama and emotion, some Neoclassical artists were able to bring the intensity and drama into their painting. Although it was in a more simple fashion. I love Jacques Louis David’s paintings during the apex of Neoclassicism. (Dive into Oath of the Horatii with me, and you’ll see!) . David was considered the leader of the movement in France. His art was simple, yet dramatic and captivating. Much of his artwork eventually turned into propaganda, but his craft was incredible and impacted many students who would go on to produce great art.\n\nIf you want to see how Neoclassicism fits into the larger timeline of art history, make sure you watch my Western Art History Timeline video.

The painting was commissioned by the king of Spain and was a token to show the new and improved relationship between Spain and France. Jacques-Louis David and Napoleon Crossing the Alps were tied to the Neoclassical art movement, which I’ll cover in this article.\n\nThe Story of Napoleon Crossing the Alps\n\nNapoleon rose through the ranks of the military during the French revolution. By the year 1799, he became First Consul in France. Then, five short years after that he would become the first Emperor of France.\n\nIn this painting, we see Napoleon (as First Consul) leading The Reserve Army across this dangerous mountain pass called Saint Bernard. They were on a military campaign to regain Italy in the year 1800. It’s debated whether Napoleon actually led the army through this mountain pass, or came through later. Nevertheless, of course Jacques-Louis David depicted Napoleon as the triumphant leader.\n\nThe Idealization of Napoleon\n\nThe artist depicts Napoleon as a glorious victor with arm outstretched and hand in the shape of a blessing sign. He is seated upon a wild, yet majestic horse. This pose mirrors a typical Roman equestrian statue, which is really important to Napoleon because he likes to connect himself with the great leaders of The Holy Roman Empire. In addition, Napoleon looks like the calm within the storm. He’s surrounded by seemingly unnavigable territory – huge cliffs, wild terrain, and harsh weather. But he looks powerful with his windswept hair and his intense gaze.\n\nOverall, Napoleon Crossing the Alps is a very idealized painting. In other words, Napoleon is meant to look perfect. This is fitting because it’s been said that Napoleon had a big ego. This guy didn’t want anybody to seem more powerful than him. In fact, at his coronation he took the crown out of the pope’s hand and crowned himself. Napoleon wanted to make clear who had more power. At the bottom of this painting you can see some names etched into stone. These are the names of powerful men Napoleon is following – Hannibal, Charlemagne, and look who’s at the very top – Bonaparte Napoleon himself.\n\nNapoleon Crossing the Alps and Neoclassicism\n\nNapoleon Crossing the Alps is a great example of the Neoclassical art style. This art style pulls from the roots of Greek and Roman art. Napoleon really wanted to align himself with this style because he wanted to connect himself with the great leaders of the Roman empire and their values and ideas. This is why he often commissioned Jacques-Louis David to do his paintings.\n\nJacques-Louis David was a leader in the Neoclassical art movement. In fact, some people call him the father of the movement. During the French revolution he was working for the revolutionists and headed the propaganda department. As the lead artist, his job was to sway people politically through his images, and he was really good at his job. This is when Neoclassicism was born, which was a stark contrast to the Rococo art movement that came before.\n\nNeoclassical Art characteristics\n\nThis painting shows a lot of typical Neoclassical art characteristics. Remember, Neoclassicism is a shift back to Greek and Roman art. So, you’re going to see a lot of similarities.\n\nThe first characteristic of Neoclassical art to notice is the tight brush strokes. These are clean and crisp. Second, the colors used are earthy and natural. Third, the dynamic posing draws your eye right to the center of the piece, which is Napoleon and very Neoclassical and Romanesque. There are also strong diagonal lines, which gives motion, action, and tension to the piece. Napoleon is dressed in military regalia with soldiers surrounding him. These strong civic vibes, pride of country and of protecting people, and a calling to arms by a strong leader who can fight for your country is all Neoclassical.\n\nNapoleon and Propaganda\n\nIn the end, this painting and many of Jacques-Louis David’s paintings were straight up propaganda. Napoleon was depicted exactly as he wanted. He is portrayed as the perfect leader for a fallen country. A man perfect to be titled the next emperor of France, Europe, and the world.\n\nTo see how Napoleon Crossing the Alps and the Neoclassical art movement fit within art history, download this condensed Western Art history Timeline."
