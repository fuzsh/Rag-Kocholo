        "text": "What does it mean to be a Neoclassical Playwright?\n\nThe playwrights that supplied the format of the Neoclassical movement followed strict guidelines while constructing their plays. They followed much of Aristotle's rules in their pursuit of connecting with Greek and Roman theatre elements. The Neoclassical play formula was pretty black and white. In keeping with Aristotle's teachings, plays had to fit in a neatly packaged, five-act structure.(Price) They were never allowed to mix genres, they were either comedies about the lower class or tragedies about the tendencies of the upper class. Neoclassicism did away with melodramatic acting techniques and audiences began to expect actors to play their parts as realistically as possibly. This requirement also restricted the playwright in that they could no longer write in any character action that did not represent realistic activity like soliloquies or addressing the audience. Decorum was also extremely important in that the audience expected satisfaction in how characters were treated. Good characters were praised and bad characters were punished accordingly. This tied in with the expectation \"Dulce et Utilo,\" that the play was going to leave the audience with a moral life lesson that was tied up in a neat little package. These fundamentals of Neoclassicism were upheld by the Académie Francais, which was comprised of several scholars who strictly enforced the format and regulated what was released to the public. (Baron)\n\nThe Neoclassical Theatre movement started in France with the \"Big Three\" which was made up of Molière, Pierre Corneille, and Jean Racine. These men challenged the norm and recreated their form in the process, much to the dismay of the Académie.\n\nMolière (Jean-Baptiste Poquelin) 1622-1673\n\nMolière is the one playwright of the \"Big Three\" who wrote comedies. He was influenced by commedia dell'arte as well as Greek and Roman drama later in life, though he did not stick to those formats religiously. In fact, Molière was a rebel in that he broke the strictly enforced Neoclassical format repeatedly. This is especially seen in ​Tartuffe, a comedy about a heretic who is able to convince the main character of his false credibility while nearly tricking him out of house and wife.(Gainer, 1230) Though most of the play follows the strict guidelines of Neoclassicism in that the characters are eventually treated in respect to their moral position, Molière deviates at the ending. When all is lost at the climax of Tartuffe, the king swoops in a royal form of Deus ex Machina and straightens everything out for our main character. Though everyone gets what they deserve and and good triumphs over evil, the unrealistic intervention of the king at just the right time goes against the expectation of verisimilitude. (Moore) Molière's writing showcased his negative outlook on humanity and social expectations, which is probably why he always deviated in some small way or another from what was expected of his work. He typically satirized upperclass tendencies and activities but with little Dulce et Utilo. This is because he would openly comment on these occurrences but would have little faith in the peoples' ability to change.\n\nPierre Corneille 1606-1684\n\nPierre Corneille is considered the \"Father of French Tragedy,\" though he did dabble in comedy as well. His first major work would be Le Cid, based on the Spanish play Le Cidis. The play follows the absurd story of a Spanish couple who want to get married but must deal with betrayal and royal intervention before they can truly be happy together. This adaptation keeps true to its Spanish roots by exploring the topics of dispute between personal desire and honor in family.(Nelson) Though considered a great work, Le Cid received harsh criticism from the Académie due to it not following the expected form of the time. Though Cornielle claimed that his work fit the Neoclassical format, others were not so sure, seeing that so much happened in the plot. Whether or not it fit the three unities of time, place, and action were questionable, especially since the male love interest, Rodrigue goes to and returns from war in the span of this supposed day. There is also the question of whether or not this is a comedy or tragedy. Le Cid ends with a wedding, which is typical of comedies, but so much death, destruction, and betrayal take place that it could also be considered a tragedy. It's easy to see why the Académie was not happy with Cornielle's work and tried to keep it from being produced. Le Cid did end up being produced despite their efforts and went on to be a success in the public sphere so Cornielle might have been on to something after all. Despite Le Cid's success, the play's criticism seemed to destroy Corneille's writing ability for a bit. He eventually regained his confidence though and returned to the theatre world with Horace, Cinna, and Polyeucte. These three when combined with Le Cidis, make up Cornielle's tetralogy and his masterpiece body of work. (YourDictionary) These new tragedies are set in Rome and all explore internal conflict with honor and duty.\n\nJean Racine 1639-1699\n\nJean Racine is the second French tragedian of the \"Big Three.\" His plays also followed Greek and Roman tradegies and, unlike the previously mentioned playwrights, rarely diverted from the Neoclassical format. His plays also directed the audience to examine and explore the characters' internal struggle and their moral dilemmas in the search of heroism. This can be seen in La Thébaide, which explores the war between Oedipus's two sons, Polynices and Eteocles. La Thébaide was Racine's first success and the conflict and separation that destroyed a brotherhood become common themes in his plays to come. Phèdre is what many would consider to be Racine's masterpiece. It follows the titular character, Queen Phèdre of Greece, after she is misinformed about her husband's death. The play follows Neoclassical ideals almost all the way through by exploring tragic human flaws and urges and how morally-compromised royalty could act. The play deviates at the end however with an intervention from the Greek god of the ocean, who rises up and puts a dramatic end to the issues in the play. This should have caused some backlash from critics for not being true to form but Racine managed to get away with it because Phèdre's ​Deus ex Machina remains true to its Greek origins.
