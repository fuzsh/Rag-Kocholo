        "text": "In this article show you the 10 most beautiful villas overlooking the shores of Lake Como.\n\nUnfortunately, for practical reasons, we have chosen “only” 10 villas. This doesn’t mean that along the lake we can’t find numerous villas, private and not, which would charm anyone with their spectacularity.\n\nWe have also decided to leave out the usual cold ranking, because that these buildings are so splendid that it would be difficult to classify them consistently and according to objective criteria.\n\nWe have chosen these villas because normally or periodically visitable, so that you can admire them live.\n\nGiven these small initial premises, here are our choices.\n\nTHE VILLAS\n\nVILLA OLMO, Como\n\nThe costumers of Villa Olmo were the Odescalchi, who in 1782 entrusted Innocenze Regazzoni with the construction of the villa. It was finished in 1796 by Simone Cantoni, one of the most authoritative architects of Lombard neoclassicism. Although its current appearance is the result of the last restoration works at the end of the 1800s, the villa was already praised for its grandeur from its earliest years.\n\nThe travelers, impressed by its beauty, had nicknamed it “Mole odescalca”.\n\nIn 1925 the villa was purchased by the Municipality of Como as a representative building\n\nOn the back of the villa it is possible to admire a large garden which, at its top, has an elegant neoclassical temple.\n\nThe garden on the front is a sober and spectacular Italian garden.\n\nVILLA GRUMELLO, Como\n\nThe “grumello” properly indicates the panoramic area that connects Como to Cernobbio, along the lakefront.\n\nThis suggestive area attracted numerous prominent people from the Como area over the centuries.\n\nIndeed, the existence of a villa belonging to the wealthy banker Tommaso D’adda is documented as early as 1570-80.\n\nSubsequently the villa passed into possession first of the Odescalchi, who restored it and then of the Giovio. The Giovio hosted in Villa Grumello important personalities such as Ugo Foscolo and Alessandro Volta.\n\nThe current villa is the result of a restoration in 1870 by the Celesia family, the last owner family.\n\nFortunately, after several years of neglect, Villa Grumello since 2007 has been open to the public as an entrepreneurial and cultural center.\n\nVILLA ERBA, Cernobbio\n\nVilla Erba was born from a former female monastery. The transition from a monastery to a private residence took place thanks to Domenico Pino, who together with his wife transformed the monastery into a manor house.\n\nThe current building is the result of a restoration commissioned by the subsequent owners, the Brivio-Erba spouses. The couple wanted to build a representative building to host major events.\n\nThus the ancient villa was transformed into the current one, in full Mannerist style.\n\nThe director Lunchino Visconti stayed there a lot as a boy. The first floor is now used as a museum dedicated to him.\n\nVilla Erba has been open to the public since 1989 as an exhibition and conference center and is often used as a television set thanks to its spectacular nature.\n\nVILLA D’ESTE, Cernobbio\n\nBorn around the middle of the sixteenth century, it was called “D’Este” when the property passed to Carolina Brunswick, who boasted a distant kinship with the D’este family.\n\nIn 1873 the villa was totally used as a luxury hotel, after the success that kind of business.\n\nInitially successful only in a small part of the structure, thanks to the intuition of Baron Ippolito Ciani.\n\nOver the years, Villa D’este has hosted many important personalities such as Madonna, Clooney, De Niro, Mastroianni and many others from the sports, political and entertainment worlds.\n\nThe gardens of the villa were declared a National Monument in 1913 and combine typical Italian elements with romantic and picturesque alements.\n\nCASTELLO DI URIO, Carate Urio\n\nThe villa known as Castello di Urio belonged initially to the Della Porta family in the late 1600s.\n\nAfter having passed to several important families, the villa then came to the Melzi family. It was under this last property that it took the name of “castle”.\n\nThe property that probably brought the most important improvements was the Richard family one, a family of rich industrialists from the end of the 19th century.\n\nThe appearance of the present building is probably due to successive restorations and has a clear mannerist style, with a splendid eighteenth-century garden.\n\nSince 1995 the castle has been used as a center for spiritual activities by the Rui Foundation, an emanation of Opus Dei.\n\nVILLA LEONI, Ossuccio\n\nCommissioned in 1938 and built between 1941 and 1944, Villa Leoni appears as a compromise between the genius of the rationalist architect Pietro Lingeri and the strict rules of the time.\n\nThe architect carefully studied both the shapes and the colors to be integrated in the villa, to optimize the relationship between nature and architecture.\n\nThe villa still strikes today for its modernity, but above all for its ability to dialogue with the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe soft colors and the outdoor garden are others main elements that allow the villa to naturally fit into the landscape context.\n\nVILLA MONASTERO, Varenna\n\nThis villa became a patrician residence between 1600 and 1700, but was a former Cistercian monastery active until 1567.\n\nThe current appearance is attributed to the penultimate owner, by the industrialist Walter Erich Jacob Kees.\n\nBetween the end of 1800 and the beginning 1900, the garden was enlarged and the structure modernized and enriched with modern comforts.\n\nAt the end of the First World War, it was confiscated by the state. During the 50s it became the venue for important conferences and lectures, hosting Nobel Prize winners such as Enrico Fermi.\n\nFrom 1977 it was merged into the CNR, National Research Council.\n\nSince 2004 the villa can be visited both from outside and from inside."
