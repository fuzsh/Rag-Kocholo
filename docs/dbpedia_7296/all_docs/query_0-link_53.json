I have ample experience with the lobby in The Hague, but also with advocacy at regional and local levels. I like to switch between strategic choices, contemporary issues that arise and hands-on support. I am passionate and work side-by-side with my clients throughout the process. I am also passionate about intelligence questions, data driven public affairs and the development of IT tools for ambitious public affairs professionals. For example, together with colleague Mark van den Anker I developed our successful Stakeholder Intelligence Monitor (SIM) and I bear the responsibility for the further development and growth of the SIM. Representing Wepublic, I am also involved in our international Interel network.\n\nPreviously, I worked as a public affairs advisor at Schiphol Group and as a consultant at Berenschot and EPPA Politiek & Lobby Consultants. I have also been working for the VVD for years, at both local and national level.\n\nIn my spare time I enjoy sports (running, crossfit, strength training), surfing, reading and dinners and drinks with family and friends. I can cook quite nicely and I also really enjoy eating out. I have two daughters with whom I like to go out to museums and theaters or explore the outdoors.\n\nI love working on complex issues in the field of public affairs and stakeholder management by helping to make it concrete and to just do it. I gladly assist clients in supporting and developing public affairs strategies, which we then jointly implement. By making the representation of interests and lobby concrete and tangible, I show how they can contribute to the objectives of the organization. I am passionate and work closely with my clients throughout the process. My working method is characterized by a ‘hands-on’ and a thorough approach combined with humor and perspective.\n\nI am enthusiastic about asking questions regarding intelligence, data driven public affairs and developing IT tools that can be of added value in our field. Together with my colleague Maaike van Hooidonk I developed our successful Stakeholder Intelligence Monitor (SIM) and I bear the responsibility for the further development and growth of the SIM.\n\nThe future of our field will, in my view, be based more on the use of data and IT applications."
