        "text": "The Neoclassical art period reached its height in the late 18th and early 19th century. Born in Rome, the movement spread throughout Europe and the United States. It was a return to ancient Greek and Roman art characteristics and ideals. Therefore, Neoclassical art portrayed the ideas of simplicity, reason, order, virtue and civilized society.\n\nThis article covers four important things that led to the Neoclassical art period. And in addition, the main characteristics of the art during this time.\n\nHow did the Neoclassical art period start?\n\nThere are four main things that led to the Neoclassical art movement:\n\nA pushback on the Baroque and Rococo art movements\n\nWritings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann\n\nExcavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum in Italy\n\nThe 18th century Age of Enlightenment\n\n1. Neoclassicism – A pushback on Baroque and Rococo\n\nThe two preceding art movements to Neoclassicism are Baroque and Rococo. The Baroque art movement lasted approximately 150 years from 1600 to 1750. It was full of drama, emotion, and tension.\n\nNext, the Rococo or Late Baroque art movement started in the early 1700s and lasted until the mid-to-late 1700s. Rococo built was similar to Baroque, but was more fun and frivolous. Therefore, it’s not surprising that Rococo turned its attention away from the church and Christian themes. The art became more hedonistic in a way.\n\nThe Neoclassical art movement follows Baroque and Rococo in the late 1700s. In many ways, it was a push back to the gaudy, frivolous, and over-the-top nature of these previous movements. In fact, some of the leading figures of Neoclassicism fought against the leaders of Rococo and the French aristocracy. So, Neoclassicism art shows a stark contrast to the preceding art. It was full of simplicity, reason, and a return to order and virtue.\n\n2. Writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann\n\n3. Excavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum\n\nIn the mid 1730s and 40s, the real excavations of the ancient cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum began. These excavations included the discovery of Roman art and architecture, which revived the study of Greek and Roman art. In fact, Rome was a major stop for The Grand Tour – a traditional trip taken by European upper-class men once they reach the age of 21. This stop on The Grand Tour helped spread Neoclassicism from Rome to other parts of Europe\n\n4. The 18th century Age of Enlightenment\n\nFinally, the Neoclassical art period coincided with the 18th century Age of Enlightenment. This philosophical movement valued science and reason. It was a main driver of the Industrial Revolution. The ideals of individual liberty, religious tolerance, and constitutional governments were pushed. Therefore, Neoclassical artists were inspired by these ideas. They portrayed art that was civilized, reasonable, and contributed to a more orderly society.\n\nNeoclassical art period characteristics\n\nWith the background of these four things that led up to the Neoclassical movement, it’s a little bit easier to understand the art and architecture styles of this period. As well as everything else already mentioned, the characteristics of art during this time were serious, symmetrical, orderly, virtuous, and heroic. The art often depicted characteristics from classical history, as well as political, philosophical, and religious leaders who were important to the time. The architecture became more simple and less ornate than Baroque and Rococo architecture.\n\nAlthough some may find Neoclassical art boring, I think you can find a lot of beauty in the classic nature of the Roman and Greek art characteristics. Even though there is generally less drama and emotion, some Neoclassical artists were able to bring the intensity and drama into their painting. Although it was in a more simple fashion. I love Jacques Louis David’s paintings during the apex of Neoclassicism. (Dive into Oath of the Horatii with me, and you’ll see!) . David was considered the leader of the movement in France. His art was simple, yet dramatic and captivating. Much of his artwork eventually turned into propaganda, but his craft was incredible and impacted many students who would go on to produce great art."
