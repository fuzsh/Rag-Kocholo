Ugo Foscolo was an Italian writer and poet born in 1778 in Zakynthos, Greece. He was a key figure in the transition from neoclassicism to romanticism in Italian literature. Foscolo was enthusiastic about Napoleon's liberal ideas but became disillusioned when Napoleon ceded Venice to Austria. This disillusionment inspired his best-known work, The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis, an epistolary novel written between 1798-1802 about a young man's political disillusionment and suicide. Foscolo spent his later years in exile in England, enjoying social circles but experiencing financial difficulties, until his death in 1827 near London.
