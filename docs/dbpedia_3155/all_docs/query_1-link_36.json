        "text": "London: Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox Inc. agreed to sell its pay-TV businesses in Italy and Germany for £4.97 billion ($8.3 billion) in cash plus assets, gaining funds to raise an $80 billion takeover bid for Time Warner Inc.\n\nBritish Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSkyB), which is 39% owned by Fox, will acquire Fox’s wholly owned Sky Italia Srl unit for £2.07 billion in cash plus a stake in National Geographic Channel, Isleworth, England-based BSkyB said in a statement on Friday. BSkyB will buy Fox’s 57.4% stake in Sky Deutschland AG for £2.9 billion.\n\nThe sale will give Murdoch, 83, ammunition as he weighs how much he can increase his $85-a-share bid for Time Warner without jeopardizing New York-based Fox’s investment-grade credit rating. BSkyB gains leverage, becoming a European satellite and cable service with almost 20 million subscribers, as it negotiates for right to sports and entertainment.\n\nBloomberg News first reported BSkyB’s talks with Fox on 9 May and on 20 July said that Murdoch was considering using proceeds from the asset sales to increase his offer for Time Warner, owner of CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. studios.\n\nBSkyB gains a larger European Sky operation in a region where about 40% of homes have a pay-TV subscription, compared with about 90% in the US.\n\nPay-TV assets\n\nThe deal provides Murdoch’s Fox empire with a way to obtain cash and maintain a grip on European pay-TV assets within BSkyB, while pressing ahead with efforts to buy Time Warner.\n\nMurdoch and his son James, who was BSkyB’s chief executive officer from 2003 to 2007, had for years considered combining the European operations. A full takeover bid by Murdoch for BSkyB was derailed in 2011 over the phone-hacking scandal at News Corp., his publishing empire.\n\nLast year, Fox and News Corp. were split into separate publicly traded companies, with the Murdoch family maintaining large voting shares in both.\n\nTime Warner has decided it’s unwilling to negotiate at much less than $100 a share, people with knowledge of the matter have said.\n\nMurdoch’s $85-a-share cash-and-stock bid valued New York- based Time Warner at about $75 billion, excluding options that could raise the total equity value to $80 billion. Each dollar a share that Murdoch raises his bid costs almost $1 billion. The offer included 1.531 Fox nonvoting shares and $32.42 in cash for each share of Time Warner.\n\nUniting Skys\n\nTime Warner, which announced its rejection of Murdoch’s bid on 16 July, fell 0.3% to $84.01 on Thursday in New York. Fox gained 0.7% to $32.92. Sky Deutschland closed at €6.66 on the Frankfurt exchange. BSkyB closed at 925 pence in London.\n\nBSkyB, which offers satellite TV, broadband and phone services in the UK, is under increased pressure as BT Group Plc uses free sports channels to win Internet customers. John Malone’s Liberty Global Plc has also stepped up competition by acquiring Virgin Media Inc. last year.\n\nBSkyB, which spends about £2 billion a year on content, this week bought a 70% stake in the UK’s Love Productions, producer of Great British Bake-off and TV documentaries such as Benefits Street.\n\nLast week, BSkyB sold a minority stake in ITV Plc, the UK’s biggest commercial broadcaster with top-rated shows such as Downton Abbey, to Liberty Global Plc for £481 million.\n\nGerman minorities\n\nSky Italia, which serves about 4.8 million paying households, is adding terrestrial channels to complete its offerings via satellite and high-speed broadband networks. Sky Deutschland, with about 3.7 million customers, is the smallest and fastest-growing of the three companies as it broke into a market dominated by free-to-air broadcasters.\n\nTaube Hodson Stonex Partners Llp, one of Sky Deutschland AG’s top five shareholders, said this week Fox would need to pay more than the stock’s market price to reflect the company’s growth prospects.\n\nFor Fox, the deal will leave it with cable and broadcast networks plus movie and TV studios, making the company more attractive to investors who want to bet on video production, rather than distribution.\n\nAn eventual takeover of Time Warner would reshape the media industry by giving the TV-and-film companies bargaining power in negotiations with cable operators such as Comcast Corp. and Time Warner Cable Inc., which are in the process of their own merger.
