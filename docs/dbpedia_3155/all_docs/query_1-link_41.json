        "text": "BSkyB will pay up to £7.4bn to build a European pay-TV and broadband empire after it agreed to buy Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia from Rupert Murdoch.\n\nThe deal was revealed yesterday after a year of intermittent negotiations with 21st Century Fox, Mr Murdoch’s film and television group, which ended this week with a final agreement on price. The plan looks unlikely to hit any regulatory or other barriers and is expected to deliver a single pan-European operator with 20 million customers and annual sales of £11.2bn by the end of October.\n\nFox will sell its controlling 57pc stake in Sky Deutschland to BSkyB for £2.9bn. The British company will offer the same price for the remaining publicly traded shares, valuing them at £2.1bn.\n\nTogether the sales will deliver £4.9bn in cash to Fox with while maintaining the influential 39pc stake it has in BSkyB after the double takeover.\n\nJeremy Darroch, chief executive of BSkyB, said the creation of ‘New Sky’ would provide his company with much more room to expand. In the UK, its core satellite television business has reached a plateau at around 10 million households but Germany and Italy are much less mature pay-TV markets. Penetration rates are lower and households who do subscribe spend less than in the UK.\n\nThe merger is expected to deliver £200m per year in immediate savings, mostly from Sky Italia. BSkyB said the early synergies will from back office functions, production and distribution operations. No plans for cuts to the 30,000-strong combined work force were revealed.\n\nMr Darroch said: “I think this really positions us well for the future. We see a sector that is becoming more international I think to be at the forefront of that and shape the change as it manifests itself means we’re going to be better placed.”\n\nAndrew Griffith, BSkyB's chief financial officer, said the new borrowing would increase the company's debt to earnings ratio to a minimum of just under three and a maximum of four, depending on how many Sky Deutschland investors sell their shares.\n\nMr Darroch said the extra leverage will have no impact on BSkyB's strategy in the forthcoming Premier League rights auction, which is expected at the end of the year. It will be at worst neutral to earnings per share after two years and then deliver strong growth, he added.\n\nThe price demanded by Mr Murdoch for his Italian pay-TV operation was seen as the crux of the negotiations with Fox. BSkyB shareholders feared it would pay over the odds for a business that is struggling amid fierce competition and the country's extended recession.\n\nHow Sky Europe breaks down by company value. Total £21bn.\n\nIt is understood that Fox initially demand significantly more than BSkyB was willing to pay but the final price of £2.45bn is toward the lower end of analyst estimates of Sky Italia’s value.\n\nMr Darroch said: “I think we’ve got a good price for Sky Italia. I’m pleased where we landed.”\n\nFox will buy up enough of the newly placed shares in BSkyB to maintain its stake in ‘New Sky’ at 39pc. Mr Murdoch’s decision not to seek and increase in equity in exchange for its other European pay-TV assets ensures the deal will not fall foul of UK competition or media plurality regulations.\n\nJames Murdoch, Fox's co-chief operating officer and a non-executive director of BSkyB, said: \"Ultimately, a pan-European Sky is good for customers, who will benefit from the accelerated technological innovation and enhanced customer experience made possible by a fully integrated business.\"\n\nThe money raised by the sales will help Mr Murdoch in his pursuit of Fox’s rival Time Warner. He made an initial $80bn (£47bn) takeover offer to create the world's largest content owner but was rebuffed earlier this month. It is expected to continue to seek a deal, however. Fox indicated it would also use the proceeds from Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia to fund share buybacks.\n\nFox was advised by Deutsche Bank and Lazard. BSkyB used Barclays and Morgan Stanley. The total fees on the complicated transaction are expected to run to £150m"
