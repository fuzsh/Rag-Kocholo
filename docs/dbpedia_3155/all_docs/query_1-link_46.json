        "text": "Frédéric Michel, the former News Corporation lobbyist whose emails and texts with a cabinet minister and his special adviser revealed the close relationship between the government and the Murdoch-controlled business during its BSkyB takeover bid, is back working for the satellite television company’s Italian arm.\n\nMichel is to start working as a consultant to Sky Italia next month. He is understood to have kept in touch with James Murdoch, who has direct responsibility for 21st Century Fox’s global television business, since leaving News Corp two years ago.\n\nHis return is likely to raise eyebrows given his involvement in the abortive bid two years ago. In the 13 months from June 2010 when News Corporation announced its intention to take full control of BSkyB, it emerged Michel made 191 phone calls, wrote 158 emails and sent 799 texts to then culture secretary Jeremy Hunt’s office to help smooth the passage of the deal.\n\nMost were to Hunt’s special adviser Adam Smith, from whom he received as many as 257 text replies as late as 3.05am.\n\nMichel’s low point was the now infamous “Swan Lake” email to James Murdoch in early 2011 where he claimed: “I have managed to get JH [Jeremy Hunt] quickly before he went in to see Swan Lake. He shares our frustration. I told him he had to stand for something ultimately ... and he had to show some backbone.”\n\nThe communication, revealed at the Leveson inquiry, exposed the closeness of the relationship between the government and Murdoch’s News Corp. Smith, Hunt’s special adviser, resigned after details of the communication emerged, saying he acted without the authority of his boss and that he had allowed the impression to be created of too close a relationship between News Corp and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.\n\nMichel went on to take the newly created role of Europe director, public affairs and communication, at O2 parent company Telefónica in 2012 but has kept in touch with James Murdoch, who is now based in New York.\n\nAndrea Zappia, the chief executive of Sky Italia, has appointed Michel in the wake of the creation of Sky Europe.\n\nThe pair knew each other from Zappia’s time working for BSkyB in the UK, where he led sales and marketing, including the launch of Sky’s 3D TV offering.\n\nZappia was named chief executive of Sky Italia in 2011, replacing Tom Mockridge, who was drafted in to run News UK and is now chief executive of Virgin Media.\n\nEric Gerritsen, executive vice-president of communications and current affairs, said that Michel would split his time between Milan and Brussels.\n\nHe added that Michel’s remit, and the length of his contract, were to be finalised.\n\n“The matters he will work on will mainly be in the areas of public affairs,” he said. “I can see a number of topics, but we have not nailed them down.”\n\nOn Tuesday, BSkyB came a step closer to completing the £7bn buyout of Fox’s 57.4% stake in Sky Deutschland and the 100% stake in Sky Italia when 96% of independent shareholders agreed to the deal.\n\nThe process still requires steps including the closing of the Sky Deutschland deal, with overall completion expected in November.\n\nMurdoch’s Fox still owns 39.1% of the enlarged business, dubbed Sky Europe, and he has long held an interest in seeing the plan brought to fruition.\n\nFormer BSkyB chief executive and chairman James Murdoch, who gave up the latter post in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal when he ran the UK newspaper business, remains on the board of the UK pay-TV company.\n\nOperationally Sky Italia faces difficult challenges. BSkyB bought Sky Italia for £2.45bn, but the business has struggled with subscriber numbers, revenues and adjusted profits almost flat for the last five years.\n\n“It has put in a solid performance in a very challenging market,” said one City analyst. “But there is plenty of room for operational improvement under BSkyB’s stewardship and potential to benefit from cyclical recovery as the Italian economy recovers.”\n\nTo contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
