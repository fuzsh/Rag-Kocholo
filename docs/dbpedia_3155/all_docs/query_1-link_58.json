        "text": "21st Century Fox is the proposed media and entertainment company that will be formed following News Corporation's separation into two distinct companies.\n\n21st Century Fox is the proposed media and entertainment company that will be formed following News Corporation's separation into two distinct companies.\n\nIn June 2013, Team Sky announced a long-term commitment from News Corporation, which saw the 21st Century Fox brand appear prominently on riders' kit and team vehicles from the start of the Tour de France.\n\n21st Century Fox is the media and entertainment company that has been formed following News Corporation's separation into two distinct publicly-traded companies.\n\nNews Corporation and its subsidiary Sky Italia have been partners in Team Sky since the team first raced in 2010. The partnership will extend and increase this support for the team, which will continue to be known as Team Sky.\n\nSir Dave Brailsford, Team Principal of Team Sky, said: \"We're excited to have this long-term commitment and to welcome 21st Century Fox on board.\n\n\"It feels like great recognition of the strength and value of the partnerships we've developed. 21st Century Fox is a perfect fit and is an appealing global brand that will be great to work with.\n\nConfirming the move, James Murdoch, News Corporation's Deputy Chief Operating Officer, said: \"It's a great time to increase our commitment to Team Sky and to add the support of an exciting new entertainment brand. We're proud of the team's success so far, its professionalism and its approach to attracting new fans to the sport and increasing grassroots participation in cycling.\"\n\nIn four seasons, Team Sky has risen to number one in the world rankings, taken 129 victories and seen rider Sir Bradley Wiggins become the first British rider to win the Tour de France, in 2012.\n\nAccording to a study commissioned by Cycling News and performed by Repucom, last season Team Sky gave more media value to their partners and sponsors than any other cycling team, delivering over $550m in advertising value; the highest achieved by any professional team."
