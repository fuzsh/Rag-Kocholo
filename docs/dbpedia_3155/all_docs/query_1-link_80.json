        "text": "Roberto Amore\n\nRoberto Amore\n\nðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º Official at European Commission\n\nPublished May 23, 2019\n\nThe SKY Italia / Mediaset Premium (failed) merger decision in the pay-TV market is an interesting combination of #antitrust, pure #mergercontrol and more broadly of the #gunjumping prohibition, which in several jurisdictions might or might not be directly included in merger control rules. In a nutshell, SKY will be subject to remedies despite its withdrawal of the merger filing, due to the anticompetitive effects already occurred before the filing and most importantly prior to the clearance decision.\n\nUnder the conditions imposed by the Italian Competition Authority, SKY will be prohibited from stipulating exclusive rights for audiovisual content and linear channels for internet platforms in Italy for 3 years.\n\nHere is more or less the story that can be drawn from the decision:\n\nBetween March and November 2018 SKY and Mediaset entered into some preliminary and transitory agreements in view of the actual sale of R2, Mediasetâ€™s technological platform for the DTT pay-tv, to SKY. Such agreements included the transfer of some transmission capacity from Mediaset to SKY, the distribution and licensing (including exclusivities) of TV channels and media contents to/of both companies, most notably SKYâ€™s exclusivity over Mediasetâ€™s premium channels, as well as a put and a call option respectively for Mediaset and SKY to sell/buy R2. We can assume that sometime before November 2018 the conditions for exercising either the call or the put option occurred as the sale of R2 to Mediaset in fact went through.\n\nOn 28 November 2018 SKY and Mediaset submitted the merger filing to the Italian Competition Authority.\n\nTwo days later SKY and Mediaset closed the transaction, evidently in absence of the Authorityâ€™s clearance decision (as formally there is no stand-still obligation under Italian merger-control rules).\n\nOn 7 March 2019, the Authority opened the Phase II merger investigation.\n\nSometime in March 2019, SKY and Mediaset submitted their observations and defensive arguments.\n\nOn 28 March 2019, the Authority sent the Statement of Objections to SKY and Mediaset. We can assume that already in the S.O. the Authority explained its competition concerns and specified its intention to block the transaction or authorize it with remedies.\n\nOn 5 April 2019, SKY declared to the Authority its intention to de-merge R2 from the SKY group and consequently to withdraw the merger filing.\n\nOn 20 May 2019, the Authority decided nonetheless to approve the merger (in the meantime already somewhat in the reverse flow), subject to remedies.\n\nThe reasoning behind the Authorityâ€™s decision is that, despite SKYâ€™s attempt to reinstate R2 as a separate entity and put it back under Mediasetâ€™s control, the agreements entered into by SKY and Mediaset between March 2018 and April 2019 already produced their anticompetitive effects and reinforced SKYâ€™s alleged dominant position in the pay-tv market. The Authority looked at the various deals between SKY and Mediaset since March 2018 and the actual sale of R2 and considered them as a whole, i.e as part of one and the same transaction.\n\nAccording to the Authority such transaction â€“ under merger control rules â€“ has led to the creation or strengthening of a dominant position on the pay-TV market and in the market for wholesale access services to the pay-TV platform of digital terrestrial television. This would eliminate or reduce competition also in the vertically related markets such as the wholesale supply of prepackaged pay-TV channels and the market for licensing of audiovisual content broadcasting rights.\n\nI am not going to comment on the Authorityâ€™s merger analysis and in particular on whether (i) the market was properly defined, (ii) the agreements at stake were indeed capable of creating or strengthening a dominant position in such market and (iii) the effects were not offset by the demerger of R2. What is clear, however, is that this case presents a very interesting and somewhat innovative application of merger control rules and in particular of article 18.3 of Italian Competition Law â€“ and for that, kudos to the case team! Bravi! ;-)\n\nhttps://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2019/5/Antitrust-autorizzata-con-misure-l-operazione-di-concentrazione-Sky-R2-ramo-di-Mediaset-Premium"
