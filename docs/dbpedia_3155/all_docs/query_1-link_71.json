        "text": "Top-level cycling team Sky Pro Cycling has announced 21st Century Fox as a new partner.\n\n21st Century Fox, the media and entertainment spin-off company that will be formed following News Corporation's split into two distinct publicly-traded companies, had its logo unveiled on 9th May.\n\nThat logo will be displayed on the back of the Team Sky riders' shorts and on team cars.\n\nSky Pro Cycling debuted in 2010 and is owned by News Corporation and its subsidiary Sky Italia.\n\nAlthough the 21st Century Fox deal is being billed as a 'long-term commitment', it is essentially the team's parent company putting a new badge on the team uniforms.\n\nSky extends with Pinarello for another year\n\nSky to commit millions to cycling until 2016\n\nIt is unclear whether the team's operating budget will be affected in any way by the new agreement.\n\nJames Murdoch, News Corp's deputy chief operating officer and an enthusiastic cycling fan, said: “It’s a great time to increase our commitment to Team Sky and to add the support of an exciting new entertainment brand. We’re proud of the team’s success so far, its professionalism and its approach to attracting new fans to the sport and increasing grassroots participation in cycling.”\n\nTeam Sky go into the Tour de France this weekend with race favourite Chris Froome.\n\nSky Pro Cycling – 21st Century Fox"
