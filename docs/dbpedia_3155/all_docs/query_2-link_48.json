        "meta_description": "Sky Italia used AWS to rebuild its on-premises architecture in the cloud, enabling real-time sports data pushes and reducing compute costs by 30 percent. As part of one of Europe’s leading direct-to-consumer media and entertainment providers, Sky Italia set out to deliver a better fan experience by using AWS AppSync to optimize data transfers during peak traffic times and provide sports updates in milliseconds. Serverless, ready-to-use solutions on AWS equipped Sky Italia with the flexibility and high performance necessary to accelerate its data delivery, achieve cost-efficient scaling, and speed up time to market for innovations.",

        "text": "Media and entertainment company Sky Italia wanted to deliver a better fan experience by pushing real-time data updates during live broadcasts of sports events, but its Sky Sports website was already straining the performance capacity of Sky Italia’s on-premises data centers. The website receives 150 million page views per month and has recorded a peak of 2,041,954 visits for a single day. To enable real-time updates, Sky Italia required a faster and more elastic solution for propagating data, particularly during peak times.\n\nSky Italia migrated to Amazon Web Services (AWS) to rebuild its previous architecture from the ground up, increasing its horizontal scalability and elasticity during both peak and off-peak times and optimizing data transfers between its front-end system and backend applications. In addition to providing faster game updates, Sky Italia achieved greater operational efficiency, reduced legacy data center maintenance costs, and improved search engine optimization by attaining faster data transfer speeds.\n\n“Achieving real-time updates of sports events was only the starting point to rethinking our architecture,” explains Giambattista Cerri, head of the digital team for editorial digital properties at Sky Italia. “The ready-to-use AWS services enabled the complete digital transformation of our architecture.”\n\nSky Italia is part of the Comcast-owned British satellite television service Sky, one of Europe’s leading direct-to-consumer media and entertainment companies, with 24 million customers in six countries. Until 2019, Sky Italia ran on-premises data centers in Milan and Rome, but it couldn’t scale up during peak times using its legacy architecture, resulting in slow data delivery that made real-time updates impossible. Sky Italia also pulled updates from thousands of apps by querying on the backend instead of the more efficient approach of pushing data from the apps to its website. “Our main goal was to provide faster data; when you’re following your soccer team, your Grand Prix motorcycle racing, or your Formula 1 season, you want the latest updates,” says Cerri.\n\nBecause Sky Italia couldn’t upgrade individual components of its integrated architecture to enable real-time data pushes, it chose to totally redesign an architecture comprising stand-alone, simple-to-modify components from AWS. AWS solutions offered the autonomy Sky Italia needed to increase elasticity, enhance operational efficiency, reduce compute resource costs, and improve data delivery speed and quality.\n\n“We wanted to evolve our architecture to provide the highest level of performance for our customers, even at peak times during sports events, and increase observability to continuously improve the system,” explains Daniele Mangano, solution architect at Sky Italia. “That meant orienting ourselves toward a micro front-end approach where data changes could be pushed to the end user and each component of the architecture, when properly decoupled, could scale as needed and be independently managed.”\n\nThe first release of Sky Italia’s new serverless architecture focused on data delivery, but the next steps will involve managing multiple data providers within the same system. The company also wants to efficiently ingest and update data so it can produce web components in less time and manage multiple data providers and message types. For these solutions, it plans to use Amazon DynamoDB, a fast and flexible NoSQL database service; Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, a fully managed data-streaming service; and Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics. “The idea is to have powerful tools to automatically recognize the type of message to forward it to the appropriate ingestion flow with a unique entry point,” explains Mangano.\n\nSky Italia’s drive to improve the fan experience with real-time game updates unlocked even more possibilities to innovate on AWS. The company is in talks with Sky about potentially using AWS solutions to enable global real-time sports updates. Sky Italia’s news channels will also use the same architecture on AWS to push election data updates from Italy’s central government so that viewers can stay informed in real time.\n\n“We find that AWS AppSync is the best solution to solve our problems,” says Mangano. “We were impressed by the speed of data propagation and received positive feedback from many areas of Sky.”"
