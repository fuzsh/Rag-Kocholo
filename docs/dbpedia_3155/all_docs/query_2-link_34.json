        "text": "This page only shows primary logo variants.\n\nFor other related logos and images, see:\n\n2008 Idents\n\nOther\n\n1984–1989 1989–1993 1993–1995 1995–1997 1997–1998 1998–1999 1999–2001 2001–2009 2009–present\n\nSky Group Limited is a British pan-European media and telecommunications company owned by Comcast since 2018. It has operations in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, and formerly Spain.\n\nSky is Europe's largest media company and pay-TV broadcaster by revenue (as of 2018), with 23 million subscribers and more than 31,000 employees as of 2019. The company is primarily involved in satellite television.\n\n1984–1989[]\n\nThis was the first of Sky's many logos, used from the time Satellite Channel was named to Sky Channel in January 1984.\n\n1989–1993[]\n\nDesigner: Harry Marks\n\nPacific Data Images\n\nTypography: Unknown\n\nLaunched: 1989\n\nSky Television merged with British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) to form British Sky Broadcasting in late 1990. This did not bring any major changes to the Sky identity, other than the occasional addition of the full company name underneath using BSB's old font.\n\n1993–1995[]\n\nDesigner: Novocom/GRFX\n\nTypography: Unknown\n\nLaunched: 1993\n\nIn 1993, Sky launched a new corporate look with a common design across all its channels. The new-look was created by Novocom. The logo was altered to make the 'Sky' wordmark larger in proportion to the circle, and the 'Y' was straightened up.\n\n1995–1997[]\n\nDesigner: Novocom\n\nTypography: Franklin Gothic Heavy (brand)\n\nLaunched: 1995\n\nYet another new look, also designed by Novocom, was launched in 1995. The Sky logo was given a slant and was put in an oval, which itself was usually put in a rectangle.\n\nIndividual channel logos and graphics were nearly identical. Channel logos were made up of the Sky logo in a rectangle with the channel name always written in the same lowercase font (except for Sky News). The channels were separated by using different colours for their graphics. Sky One used purple, the movie channels used golden brown, Sky Sports used dark red, Sky News used dark blue, Sky Soap used pink, and Sky Travel used green.\n\n1997–1998[]\n\nDesigner: Unknown\n\nTypography: Franklin Gothic Heavy (brand)\n\nRotis Semi Sans (brand)\n\nLaunched: 1997\n\nAnother new corporate look come in September 1997, and it was once again implemented across every channel. This time the logo with the oval usually appeared on its own, with 3D effects that almost made the oval look like an egg.\n\nAlthough the channels had to adhere to yet another identical logo scheme, they were allowed more variety for their channel graphics.\n\n1998–1999[]\n\nDesigner: Pittard Sullivan\n\nTypography: Univers Black\n\nHelvetica (brand 1998-2005)\n\nLaunched: September 1998\n\nAhead of the launch of Sky Digital, Sky was rebranded in September 1998. This included a completely new logo that abandoned the font which had been used in various forms since the 1980s. Pittard Sullivan handled much of the rebranding.\n\nWith this rebrand, Sky started a practice of using one logo with the name in lowercase for the platform and corporate purposes and another with the name in capital letters for its channels.\n\n1999–present[]\n\n1999–2001[]\n\nDesigner: Miles Newlyn\n\nTypography: Custom type\n\nHelvetica (brand)\n\nLaunched: 1999\n\nThe 'satellite edge' swoosh was retained, however, accompanied by a new logotype and a new colour scheme. The blue, yellow, and white colour scheme has been the trademark scheme from 1999 until 2005.\n\n2001–2009[]\n\nDesigner: Miles Newlyn\n\nTypography: Custom type\n\nHelvetica (brand 1999-2005)\n\nFF Info Text (brand 2005-2009)\n\nLaunched: 2000\n\nIn 2000, the satellite swoosh (used from 1998-2000) was phased out, leaving it as a wordmark-only logo. This ID presented an intro that was introduced on 1 October 2001. When Artsworld was rebranded as Sky Arts in March 2007, it used the lowercase version of the Sky logo, and since then the company has slowly moved back to using one logo for both corporate purposes and channel brands.\n\nTo find out more about the 2008 idents of Sky, click here.\n\n2009–present[]\n\nDesigner: Miles Newlyn\n\nTypography: Modified from the previous logo\n\nSky Text (brand)\n\nLaunched: Autumn 2009\n\nIn Autumn 2009, Sky updated its logo and introduced a new brand identity in order to make the company appear more friendly. The new logo began to be launched on channels, with the first being Sky Movies and Sky Sports on January 1, 2010. Sky News and Sky Arts followed suit later that year.\n\nArt & Business of Motion\n\nBrand Republic\n\nSky logo by Miles Newlyn on Dribbble\n\n[]\n\nOfficial website\n\nOfficial website (UK)\n\nV • T • E\n\nSky Group\n\nPart of Comcast\n\nUK & Ireland\n\nFree-to-air channels\n\nChallenge | Sky Arts | Sky Mix | Sky News\n\nGeneral channels\n\nSky Atlantic | Sky Comedy | Sky Crime | Sky Documentaries | Sky Kids | Sky Max | Sky Nature | Sky Replay | Sky Showcase | Sky Witness | Sky Sci-Fi\n\nSky Cinema channels\n\nPremiere | Action | Animation | Comedy | Drama | Family | Greats | Hits | Sci-Fi Horror | Select | Thriller\n\nSky Sports channels\n\nMain Event | Action/NFL | Box Office | Cricket | F1 | Football | Golf | Mix | News | Premier League | Racing (50%) | Tennis | +\n\nJoint-venture channels\n\nA+E Networks UK (50%, with A&E Networks): Sky History | Sky History2 | Blaze | Crime & Investigation\n\nParamount International Networks: Comedy Central (Extra) (25%)\n\nGINX Esports TV (50%, with ITV plc)\n\nFormer channels\n\nGeneral: Sky One | Sky Real Lives | Sky Travel Shop | Sky Soap | Sky Scottish | Sky Living Loves | Bravo | Bravo 2 | [.tv] | The Comedy Channel | Galaxy | Now | The Power Station | Sky 3D | Sky 3D Box Office | Sky Arts 1 | Sky Arts 2 | Tiny Living | Jackpot247 | Channel One | Setanta Sports News | The Children's Channel | Trouble | European Business News | Merit\n\nJoint-venture: Lifetime (with A&E Networks)\n\nSky Movies/Cinema: Box Office | Classics | Disney | Indie | Max | Premier | Superheroes\n\nSky Sports: PremPlus | Xtra | Extra (BT TV) | Arena\n\nOther services\n\nSky+ | Sky+ HD | Sky Q | Sky Glass | Sky Stream | Sky Live | Sky Broadband | Sky Connect | Sky Mobile | Sky Talk | Sky Go | Sky IQ | Sky Multiscreen | Sky on Demand | Sky Yahoo!
