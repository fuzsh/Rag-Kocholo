Having played and watched football all my life I find it infuriating that the camera zooms into the players feet the last 20 yards when he receives the ball on the wing. You can't see players arriving in the box. Once the camera zooms back out you are out of sink with the play. Too Mitch time is taken showing or relive the replays and when it gets back to the game the goal kick has been taken and you miss live play. It's getting like American football coverage. We know who the managers are we don't need to see them every two minutes. WHY DOES THE CAMERA ALWAYS LOOK AWAY IF IT LOOKS LIKE A PLAYER MAY REACT BADLY TO A CHALLENGE OR DECISION BY THE REF. WE PAY TO SEE THE FOOTBALL AND WHAT HAPPENS ON THE PITCH. The second half starts and then you decide to put the teams across the screen. If there has been a substitution we will see it. Really is frustrating enough to cancel subscription and just watch match of the day.\n\nVickymeldrew ,\n\nBundesliga live streams need fixing\n\nSky need to sort out their Bundesliga live streams available via this app. Yet again, such a stream repeatedly abruptly throws me out, it can then take several attempts to access the stream again. This problem is now so bad it is hardly worth these streams being available. And not to mention the near-30 second length advert you have to put up with before you can (maybe) see the stream - which also happens upon each attempt to access the stream again after having been abruptly disconnected from it. This happens no matter which device I usr the app from - iPad Air 2 or iPhone 12, both running current (most recent) software versions. On another note - as other reviewers have said, can we please not have womenâs football shoved down our throats so much? It is being forced on us whether we like it or not (along with the likes of netball and womenâs cricket). I wholly agree with the person who is fed up with articles being headed (for example) Manchester United, without any indication it is in fact about the womenâs team; this is just not the same sport - and I am female. There should definitely be more notification options available so that womenâs sport notifications are not forcibly received."
