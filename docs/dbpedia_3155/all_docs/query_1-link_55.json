        "text": "Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox has agreed to sell its pay TV businesses in Italy and Germany for £4.9 billion ($8.8 billion) in cash plus assets, gaining funds to raise an $US80 billion ($85 billion) takeover bid for Time Warner.\n\nBritish Sky Broadcasting Group, which is 39 per cent owned by Fox, will acquire Fox's wholly owned Sky Italia unit for £2.07 billion in cash plus a stake in National Geographic Channel, BSkyB said. BSkyB will buy Fox's 57.4 per cent stake in Sky Deutschland for £2.9 billion.\n\nThe sale will give Murdoch, 83, ammunition as he weighs how much he can increase his $US85-a-share bid for Time Warner without jeopardising Fox's investment-grade credit rating.\n\nThe deal provides Murdoch's Fox empire with a way to obtain cash and maintain a grip on European pay TV assets within BSkyB, while pressing ahead with efforts to buy Time Warner.\n\nMurdoch and his son, James, who was BSkyB's chief executive from 2003 to 2007, have for years considered combining the European operations. A full takeover bid by Murdoch for BSkyB was derailed in 2011 over the phone-hacking scandal at News Corp, his publishing empire.\n\nLast year, Fox and News Corp were split into separate publicly traded companies, with the Murdoch family maintaining large voting shares in both.\n\nTime Warner is unwilling to negotiate at much less than $US100 a share, sources have said.\n\nMurdoch's $US85-a-share cash-and-stock bid values New York-based Time Warner at about $US75 billion, excluding options that could raise the total equity value to $US80 billion.\n\nEach dollar a share that Murdoch raises his bid costs almost $US1 billion. The offer included 1.531 Fox non-voting shares and $US32.42 in cash for each share of Time Warner."
