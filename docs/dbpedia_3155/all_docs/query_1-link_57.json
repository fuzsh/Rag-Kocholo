You can read a more detailed description of how we selected the VPNs in this list later in this article.

Prefer to read the in-depth reviews? Start with NordVPN – our #1 choice for Sky Go Italia.\n\nBest VPNs for Sky Go Italia\n\nThe following VPNs consistently impress us during our on-going real-world testing.\n\nHere’s our list of the best VPNs to use with Sky Go Italia.\n\n1. NordVPN\n\nAug 2024 Unblocks Sky Go ItaliaTested Aug 2024\n\nNordVPN is our top choice for unblocking Sky Go Italia from anywhere. It has 60+ servers in Italy and approximately 6,000 servers in 100+ other countries. This is a great VPN for video streaming and reliably accesses some of the toughest services to get into from abroad, such as Sky Go Italia and Netflix. It has dedicated servers for streaming, and you can even ask the knowledgeable support team for the best server for Sky Go Italia. Plus, you get a simultaneous connection allowance of 10 with NordVPN.\n\nNord uses shared IP addresses, which means no one who tries to trace the users of a particular site could get back to you because lots of other people are using the same address at the same time. The mechanism that the company uses to map each response to each customer is called “network address translation.” This system acts as an excellent firewall because it makes it impossible for hackers to get to the real internet address of each customer. NordVPN also uses OpenVPN with a 256-bit AES encryption for data.\n\nYou can install the NordVPN app on Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS devices. If you have a Linux computer, you will have to configure the VPN manually. The same goes for routers. However, in both cases, you will find very precise instructions on the NordVPN website. You can just protect your browser with the NordVPN browser extension, available for Chrome and Firefox.\n\nPros:\n\nBlazing fast speeds to stream HD content without interruptions\n\nOperates over 60+ servers in Italy\n\nEasily access Sky Go, Italia, RaiPlay, and Netflix Italy from abroad\n\nMilitary-grade 256-bit encryption for great privacy\n\nDNS leak protection comes built-in\n\nSupport staff are helpful and knowledgeable\n\nCons:\n\nServer switching can be slow\n\nBEST VPN FOR SKY GO ITALIA:NordVPN is our first choice.

Surfshark\n\nUnblocks Sky Go ItaliaTested Aug 2024\n\nSurfshark is a great low-cost provider that operates servers in 100+ countries. It pegs decent speeds and is adept at unblocking geo-restricted content from abroad. It works with notoriously tough sites, including multiple Netflix libraries, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video, so Sky Go should pose no issues, and you’ll be able to watch all your favorite home content while abroad. Surfshark also allows unlimited simultaneous connections, so it’s ideal for protecting the whole family.\n\nSurfshark doesn’t disappoint on security, either. It offers 256-bit AES encryption, perfect forward secrecy, a kill switch in all apps, and protection against leaks. Extras include split tunneling, multi-hop VPN, and automatic wifi protection. Surfshark never retains connection logs, it allows torrenting, and it even works well in China.\n\nEasy-to-use apps are available for Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, Amazon Fire TV, and Amazon Fire Stick. One of the best things about this VPN is there’s no connection limit, so you can use it on as many devices as you like.\n\nPros:\n\nWide server network covering 100+ countries\n\nProvides a secure, encrypted connection\n\nFast, reliable speeds\n\nKill switch on all platforms\n\nUnlimited simultaneous connections\n\nCons:\n\nOccasional slower server\n\nBUDGET-FRIENDLY:Surfshark offers great value for money.

IPVanish\n\nunblocks sky go italiaTested Aug 2024\n\nIPVanish stands out for allowing you to connect as many devices as you want at once. Not only this, it has a dozen servers in Milan, Italy, so you can continue watching Sky Go Italia while traveling abroad. With this VPN, you can expect good, steady speeds as well as the ability to access Netflix US while traveling abroad.\n\nShould you have any trouble with IPVanish, remember that a subscription includes 24/7 access to live chat and email support. With a zero-logs policy, this VPN offers strong privacy protection, which is further bolstered by 256-bit AES encryption. You’ll also find it has DNS leak protection and a kill switch feature.\n\nSecure all of your devices simultaneously via the IPVanish apps for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and Amazon Fire TV. If you prefer, you can even set up IPVanish with your router, although this does require manual setup.\n\nPros:\n\nUnlimited simultaneous devices per account\n\nWorks with both Sky Go Italia and Netflix US\n\nAccess to 24/7 support via live chat and email\n\nZero-logs policy so you can stay anonymous\n\nPopular with Kodi users and torrenters\n\nCons:\n\nNo browser extensions are available\n\nHeadquartered in the US, which is a Five Eyes member\n\nUNLIMITED DEVICES:IPVanish has a dozen servers in Italy and allows unlimited simultaneous connections.

ExpressVPN\n\nUnblocks Sky Go ItaliaTested Aug 2024\n\nExpressVPN is included in our list of Sky GO Italia VPNs because of its strong network that covers 100+ countries, including Italy. With the fast download speeds necessary for video streaming, ExpressVPN is an excellent choice for those who want to stream Sky Go Italia from overseas. We believe that ExpressVPN is one of the few services that have a proven track record of successful Sky Go access.\n\nExpressVPN’s 24/7 online support can guide you toward the best server selection if you face any hurdles. This service excels at bypassing VPN detection systems globally, including the formidable Great Firewall of China.\n\nSecurity is another of ExpressVPN’s strengths. It uses 256-bit AES encryption for data and 4096-bit RSA encryption for session establishment, providing a secure internet connection for a variety of applications, including downloading. The VPN also features a ‘network lock’ or kill switch, which prevents your device’s applications from connecting to the internet if the VPN connection drops.\n\nExpressVPN is available for a wide array of platforms, including Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Amazon Fire TV Stick, Amazon Fire TV, and Linux. You can also install the VPN on certain routers, covering all your home devices, such as gaming consoles and set-top boxes. ExpressVPN allows eight simultaneous connections and a router installation is counted as a single connection! We’re of the opinion that this feature-rich VPN is a top contender for accessing Sky Go Italia overseas.\n\nPros:\n\nOperates servers in Cosenza & Milan, great for streaming Italian shows abroad\n\nReliably accesses Sky Go Italia\n\nFast enough to play HD video without buffering\n\nTop-class security and privacy protection features\n\nDNS leak protection is included with all VPN server configurations\n\nCons:\n\nNot as cheap as some other services\n\nStreaming servers aren’t labeled\n\nRELIABLE CHOICE:ExpressVPN reliably unblocks Sky Go Italia as well as most other streaming services.

You can also expect absolutely no bandwidth throttling, as well as the ability to access Netflix US.\n\nOnce signed up with CyberGhost, you’ll be able to secure as many as seven devices simultaneously. This is one of the safest VPNs you can use thanks to its 256-bit AES encryption, protection from DNS leaks, and automatic kill switch. Note that CyberGhost also operates a strict no-logs policy and has 24/7 support should you have any questions.\n\nCyberGhost provides apps for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Linux, Amazon Fire TV, and Android TV.

PrivateVPN\n\nUnblocks Sky Go ItaliaTested Aug 2024\n\nPrivateVPN has servers in over 60 countries, including Italy. It’s one of the fastest VPNs we’ve tested and unblocks pretty much every video streaming site you can throw at it, including Sky Go. This Sweden-based service has excellent English-speaking support staff available via live chat on the website during European office hours and via email at other times. And the support team can tell you the best server to choose to get into Sky Go Italia.\n\nPrivateVPN offers each customer an allowance of ten simultaneous connections. You can install the PrivateVPN app on Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Amazon Fire operating systems. The VPN can also be configured manually on some routers and on Linux.\n\nSecurity features in the app include a kill switch and automatic wifi protection. 256-bit AES encryption, DNS leak protection, and a no-logs policy ensure no one can see your online activity. PrivateVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee to new subscribers.\n\nPros:\n\nOperates servers in Arezzo and Milan that are geared for streaming\n\nGaining a solid reputation for unblocking geo-restricted content, including Sky Go Italia\n\nStreaming speeds are good enough for HD\n\nCons:\n\nFewer servers to choose from than other providers higher on this list\n\nLive support is not quite 24/7\n\nGREAT SPEEDS:PrivateVPN is a good family choice.

Private Internet Access\n\nunblocks sky go italiaTested Aug 2024\n\nPrivate Internet Access offers servers worldwide across more than 80 locations. This includes servers in Italy for unblocking and streaming Sky Go Italia. We’ve tested PIA’s speeds and found them to be as consistent as they are fast. You can expect unlimited bandwidth and, as a result, seamless streaming free from lag or buffering. You’ll also be able to connect all your devices at the same time.\n\nWhen you connect to a PIA server, your internet traffic is 256-bit AES encrypted. There’s also protection from DNS leaks and a kill switch feature. Needless to say, this secures your streaming (and browsing) experience, particularly if you’re traveling abroad and using public wifi. Some VPNs log your data and sell it to third parties. This is certainly not the case with PIA, which operates a strict no-logs policy.\n\nYou can access PIA via apps for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Linux, and Amazon Fire TV. Chrome and Firefox browser extensions are also available to download. However, manual configuration is required if you want to use PIA with a router.\n\nPros:\n\nPlenty of server locations, including Italy, for accessing Sky Go Italia\n\nUnlimited bandwidth means you won’t suffer lag or buffering\n\nCan be used on 10 devices at once via a single account\n\nCons:\n\nLike many VPNs, it’s unable to bypass restrictions in China\n\nNot many extras, such as Double VPN servers\n\nNO BANDWIDTH THROTTLING:Private Internet Access offers servers in Italy and works with Sky Go Italia. Doesn’t throttle your bandwidth, so you can stream without interruption. Strict no-logs policy included. 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nRead our full Private Internet Access review.\n\nPrivate Internet Access Coupon\n\nSAVE 82% on the 2 yr plan\n\nGet Deal >\n\nDiscount applied automatically\n\nTesting methodology: How we found the best VPNs for streaming Sky Go Italia\n\nWe know how frustrating it can be to travel abroad and find you no longer have access to the services for which you pay. Sky Go Italia content becomes region-locked due to copyright and licensing restrictions. It’s for this reason that you need a VPN to stream Sky Go Italia online from anywhere. Below, we detail our methodology for finding the best VPNs for doing exactly this.\n\nServers in Italy: Let’s start with the obvious! A VPN must have servers in Italy in order to unblock Sky Go Italia. That’s because you need an Italian IP address in order to bypass restrictions. The more servers and IP addresses a VPN has in the country, the higher the chances you’ll be able to successfully unblock the platform.\n\nSpeed: Many VPNs had to be ruled out due to their slow server speeds. We found not only the fastest VPNs but those that include unlimited bandwidth so you can stream Sky Go Italia online as much as you like. This is important when traveling abroad when you may be using public wifi and suffering from slow connections.\n\nNetwork size: It may be that you also want to stream the likes of Netflix US or BBC iPlayer. The VPNs recommended in this post provide servers in dozens of countries worldwide. This includes the likes of the US, UK, Australia, and Japan (and, of course, Italy!). Some have thousands of servers in total for even lower server loads.\n\nSecurity: We know that traveling abroad comes with some security risks. This is certainly the case if you’re connecting to public wifi hotspots. To protect you from hackers and snoopers, the best VPNs for Sky Go Italia encrypt your data. Some even include Double VPN servers so you can have an extra layer of protection.\n\nPrivacy: A VPN should allow you to browse and stream anonymously. We’ve looked at some 140 VPN logging policies in order to find which VPNs best protect your privacy. Much of this comes down to whether they operate a strict no-logs policy. It also helps if a VPN provides an anonymous payment option such as Bitcoin.\n\nEase of use: While all of the above features are very important, that doesn’t mean a VPN should be complicated to use. We’ve looked for those that have user-friendly apps as well as 24/7 live chat and email support. In all cases, signup and setup shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, even if you’re a VPN novice!\n\nValue for money: Some VPNs offer some or even all of the above but are simply too expensive. The best VPNs for watching Sky Go Italia offer the best value for money while still ticking all of the boxes. Better still, you can take advantage of a free trial or our VPN discount coupons to save even more off the price of a subscription.\n\nIn order to find out whether a VPN offers the above (and more), we need to test it for ourselves. In doing this, we can better provide you with the information you need to make an informed decision. Be sure to take a look at our VPN testing methodology for more information on our full process.\n\nAccessing Sky Go Italia with a Free VPN\n\nNow you know that a VPN can get you into Sky Go Italia, you may be wondering whether you can use a free VPN to do so. Well, you might be able to, but it’s unlikely. Sky Go Italia is one of the most difficult video streaming sites to gain access to from abroad. Netflix has the industry’s attention as a difficult access system to beat, but actually, the Sky Go platform is even harder to trick.\n\nIt takes a lot of work to get around regional restrictions, and not many companies have enough money to invest in the task. Many will tell you that no VPN can get into Netflix, which is not true. Almost none of them even mention Sky Go Italy because they know that they don’t stand a chance of getting you in from abroad. Very few reputable paid VPN services can get you into Sky Go Italia, which means no free VPN will be able to help you.\n\nPlus, free VPNs don’t offer anywhere near the levels of security and protection that paid providers do. Plus, you might find yourself at risk of having your data stored and sold to a third party.\n\nHow to access Sky Go Italia\n\nYou are allowed to connect two devices simultaneously to the Sky Go Italia service. This is in addition to your set-top box at home. You do need to register with Sky Go Italia even though the service is free for Sky Italy subscribers.\n\nOn your first visit to the site, you need to set up a Sky ID. All you need to do in the ID creation field is enter your client code. This appears at the top of your Sky bill. If you don’t have Sky at home, the Sky Go website will lead you to a Sign-Up page to get a Sky dish installed.\n\nThe first time you log in to the service, the computer or mobile device that you are on automatically gets registered as an allowed device. When you log in to the service from another computer or smartphone, that will be registered as your second allowed device. So, be very careful about going around to a friend’s house or borrowing someone else’s tablet to access Sky Go Italia because their computer or mobile device will have the right to access Sky Go Italia through your account for the rest of the month.\n\nYou cannot deregister an allowed device. However, the registration lapses at the end of the month. So, remember to only access the service on two of your own devices at the beginning of each month. Otherwise, you will be locked out.\n\nOn macOS, iOS, and Android, you have to download an app to watch videos. On Windows computers, you have to watch through your browser. However, the video player of Sky Go Italy only works with Internet Explorer 11 and above.\n\nGetting into Sky Go Italia is really quite complicated just because of the peculiar requirements over registered devices and the necessity of associating the service with your home Sky package. Trying to get into your Sky Go Italia account from outside of Italy makes everything even more complicated.\n\nRemember, very few VPNs can get into Sky Go Italia. Try any of the VPNs in our list risk-free. All of them offer refund periods to allow you to give them a spin. Another Italian TV service that you can access over the Internet, thanks to a VPN is Rai. Enjoy your travels, but take comfort in being able to access TV from back in Italy, wherever you are, thanks to a VPN."
