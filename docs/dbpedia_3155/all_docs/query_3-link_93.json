        "text": "Olympics a delightful escape\n\nMy eyes and ears have enjoyed watching the Olympics as the greatest athletes in the world peel back layers of intensity while years of effort and training pour from their bodies to perform at levels beyond my scope.\n\nIt’s impossible to choose a single event or team or participant to be a favorite. The backdrop of Paris is sensational. Witnessing the sportsmanship amid all the athletes has been fabulous. The bravado of winning has been washed away as the hugs from parents and family led to tears of joy.\n\nOf course, it will come to an end soon, but for this armchair Monday morning quarterback, it has been delightful to escape from the world for these moments and to catch sight of these athletes who perform with unrestrained determination to be their best.\n\nBarry Rothschild, Dallas/Preston Hollow\n\nTexas losing doctors\n\nRe: “N.M. enlists Texas doctors — Ads, billboards used in bid to attract unhappy providers,” Tuesday Metro & Business story.\n\nAs has been pointed out in recent surveys, the current environment surrounding abortion in Texas is causing medical students as well as practicing professionals in this state to consider relocating to other states. This story talks about the efforts to ask those professionals to consider moving to New Mexico to practice. My first reaction was anger at another state poaching our people. Upon further reflection, I decided my anger was misdirected. Who can blame other states for trying to take advantage of our situation here?\n\nTo the leadership in Austin as well as our legislators: Wake up. Women in Texas are already at risk if a life-threatening medical emergency arises while they are pregnant, and the situation will only get worse if legislators continue to do nothing to reduce the negative consequences of Texas abortion policies. Doctors are leaving the state, residency applications have declined and women are at risk.\n\nTo my fellow Texans, think before you vote. Medical emergencies don’t discriminate between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nMarilee Hayden, Frisco\n\nEnergy providers got bonanza\n\nRe: “No free lunch or electricity” by Frank M. Wagnon, Monday Letters.\n\nWagnon is correct that building more power infrastructure was never going to be cheap, much less free, for Texans. But the aftereffects of the 2021 winter storm included billions of unnecessary dollars that will be extracted from the pockets of Texas consumers over the next 25 years.\n\nIt didn’t have to be that way.\n\nIrving-based Luminant and co-plaintiffs successfully challenged the Public Utility Commission’s order that allowed ERCOT to multiply the rate paid for electric power during that ice storm. But the PUC, using our tax dollars, appealed and got that ruling overturned by the political Texas Supreme Court.\n\nTexans need to understand: Everyone who could produce electricity during that winter storm was producing all they could. The higher rates did not bring a single additional kilowatt to the market during those four days. All they did was create a bonanza for a handful of energy providers, most of whom turned around and made generous political contributions to the very Texas officials who stood by and allowed it to happen.\n\nTexans froze to death in their homes, and well-heeled, politically connected companies got richer. Texas consumers got the bill, because they continue to elect politicians who can be bought and paid for.\n\nBob Buckel, Azle\n\nLeadership led to prisoner swap\n\nThe question is sometimes asked: What makes a good leader? The prisoner swap that happened last week displayed some of the qualities of a good leader, perhaps even a great one.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s administration brought home several people who had been held as hostages in Russia. Telling was the cooperation of other countries, particularly Germany. Germany might have been reluctant to release a Russian murderer held inits prison. This Russian was apparently key to the prisoner swap.\n\nIt has been reported that the German chancellor said he would do it for Biden. Whether he actually spoke these words or not, it is apparent that the respect and relationship forged by our president was a large component of the deal.\n\nIn this global world, our leaders must have the ability to form relationships with allies in friendly countries. This is important to the security of the United States.\n\nPhyllis Vaughn, Sherman\n\nTrump letter applauded /\n\nRe: “What does Trump mean?” by Keith Jones, Friday Letters.\n\nWhat an amazing letter Jones wrote. He is saying all the things I have wanted to say for so long but didn’t think would be published. I am so grateful to finally see comments about Donald Trump that do not try to normalize the things he does and says.\n\nHis ideas and rhetoric are extremely dangerous to our democracy and should be taken very seriously, just as the letter states. I just want to thank Jones for putting it all into words so well, and I want to thank you for printing it.\n\nCarolyn Clark, Garland\n\nHoney, gall and dog tricks\n\nThere’s a saying, attributed to Abraham Lincoln, that a drop of honey is worth more than a gallon of gall. Former President Donald Trump has three months to learn this lesson, or possibly lose a winnable election. Thus, another saying comes to mind: It’s hard to teach an old dog new tricks.\n\nJackie D. Heaton, Irving\n\nTruth-filled letters\n\nRe: “Illegal voting happens,” by Ken Ashby, “Proof of citizenship a must,” by Bob Smith and “Harris’ dereliction of duty,” by Don Pearce, Saturday Letters.\n\nThank you for helping to allow these fact and truth-filled letters to run on Saturday. The topics in these letters are normally never told to the readers. What a great surprise! Keep it up, and thanks again.\n\nDonald Jones, Wylie"
