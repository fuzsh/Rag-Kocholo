        "text": "Britain's BSkyB has agreed to pay US$9 bil­lion to buy Ru­pert Mur­doch's pay-TV com­pa­nies in Ger­many and Italy, tak­ing its hunt for growth in­to Eu­rope by cre­at­ing a me­dia pow­er­house with 20 mil­lion cus­tomers.BSkyB, in which Mur­doch's 21st Cen­tu­ry Fox is al­so the largest share­hold­er, will pay for the deal us­ing cash, debt, its stake in a TV chan­nel and a plac­ing of shares that rep­re­sents around ten per cent of its is­sued share cap­i­tal.\n\nThe deal, which makes BSkyB the lead­ing pay-TV provider in Eu­rope, adds to a flur­ry of con­sol­i­da­tion in the glob­al me­dia sec­tor as tra­di­tion­al en­ter­tain­ment com­pa­nies seek to bulk up to com­pete against more nim­ble In­ter­net ri­vals.Fox is ex­pect­ed to use the pro­ceeds to fu­el its pur­suit of Time Warn­er, which re­cent­ly re­ject­ed Fox's ini­tial US$80 bil­lion bid.\n\nBSkyB had flagged a pos­si­ble deal for Sky Deutsch­land and Sky Italia in May. The price an­nounced yes­ter­day was slight­ly low­er than ex­pect­ed by some an­a­lysts and the cost and rev­enue ben­e­fits high­er.But BSkyB's shares fell five per cent, pulled low­er by the plan to is­sue stock and sus­pend a share buy-back.\n\n\"It is a bit of a step in the un­known for Sky,\" said Conor O'Shea, an an­a­lyst at Ke­pler Cap­i­tal Mar­kets. \"For the first time, it will go from UK-fo­cused to Eu­ro­pean and be asked to prove that it can add val­ue from be­ing larg­er.\"O'Shea has a \"buy\" rat­ing on BSkyB shares.Fac­ing the tough­est mar­ket con­di­tions in its 25-year his­to­ry, BSkyB has de­cid­ed its fu­ture growth lies in cre­at­ing a Eu­ro­pean pay-TV leader that will op­er­ate in Britain, Ire­land, Ger­many, Aus­tria and Italy.\n\nBSkyB dom­i­nates British pay-TV, of­fer­ing its pre­mi­um sports, movies and US dra­ma pro­gram­ing to more than ten mil­lion homes. Of 97 mil­lion house­holds in the five coun­tries it wants to tar­get, 66 mil­lion are yet to take pay-TV.\n\nEu­ro­pean tie-up\n\nFox owns 100 per cent of Sky Italia, 57 per cent of Sky Deutsch­land and 39 per cent of BSkyB. BSkyB will pay �2.45 bil­lion (US$4.2 bil­lion) for Sky Italia and �2.9 bil­lion for Fox's 57 per cent stake in Sky Deutsch­land.Un­der Ger­man takeover law, BSkyB al­so has to make an of­fer for the mi­nor­i­ty in­vestors in Sky Deutsch­land, but with on­ly a small pre­mi­um on the ta­ble, an­a­lysts doubt that many will sell. The over­all price for the deal would rise to around �7 bil­lion if Ger­man in­vestors did sell out.\n\nFor Sky Italia, the price will be made up of cash and BSkyB's 21 per cent stake in the Na­tion­al Ge­o­graph­ic Chan­nel, val­ued at around �382 mil­lion.Fox said it would sub­scribe to the share is­sue to keep its stake in BSkyB sta­ble, mean­ing it will take net pro­ceeds from the deal of around US$7.2 bil­lion. The plac­ing raised �1.4 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to traders.In the eyes of many me­dia ex­ec­u­tives and in­vestors, pro­gram­ming and con­tent are now seen as more valu­able than the in­fra­struc­ture that car­ries it to peo­ple's homes.\n\nThat change has been dri­ven in part by firms such as Net­flix and Google's Youtube, which have tak­en away view­ers from tra­di­tion­al pay-TV ser­vices de­liv­ered by satel­lite op­er­a­tors or ca­ble com­pa­nies.The shift has led some like Mur­doch's Fox to con­cen­trate more on con­tent, but for those like BSkyB that re­main in both con­tent and dis­tri­b­u­tion, they need to in­vest heav­i­ly in tech­nol­o­gy and fresh pro­gram­ming to see off the chal­lenge.\n\nReuters"
