        "text": "To profitably reach its goals, Sky needed to put in place an operating model that would provide new levels of automation, speed, agility, efficiency, and stability for its business processes, especially the critical ones. One such example is the winner selection process for its Sky Extra voting contests. This process is fundamental to the company’s revenue and reputation.\n\nFor some of its most popular shows, such as X Factor, 4 Restaurants, and Uomo Partita (Man of the Match), Sky promotes online national contests that allow Sky Extra subscribers to vote for their preferred artists through a decoder or the Sky App, and enter a contest for a prize drawing. Sky’s customers love these contests, especially when exciting prizes are at stake.\n\nSky redesigned critical business services and implemented new workflows with automation provided by Control-M. This resulted in tangible process acceleration, improved governance, and higher quality output at a lower cost. Before Sky leveraged Control-M to automate the process, it took days to execute voting contests. Steps were performed manually, with significant additional checks to avoid human error, and it was difficult for Sky to comply with strict legal contest criteria or communicate with Italy’s Ministry officials and business partners about contest winner selection."
