        "text": "MILAN – With Rupert Murdoch’s pay TV platform Sky Italia set to collect a cluster of new free-to-air channels that will compete with the core business of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s Mediaset TV group, the cost of buying content is expected to rise in Italian television.\n\nItalian authorities have affirmed a ruling by EU regulators that Sky Italia be included in the government’s planned giveaway of digital TV spectrum to current TV operators as the country completes its shift to digital this year.\n\nIn 2012, News Corp.’s Sky Italia, which is almost solely subscription based, could boast five new free-to-air channels. They will be programmed (it’s not yet clear how, or at what cost) with the goal of shifting precious advertising dollars from giant Mediaset’s stable of networks.\n\nPrice wars are expected to escalate dramatically from here on in.\n\n“They will be aggressive,” one London-based media analyst says of News Corp. execs. “They will try to buy all the rights they can. They have that investment strategy in Europe — in the U.K. (with BSkyB) and Germany (with Sky Deutschland) to keep paying and paying, and invest and then try to kill their competition.”\n\nAndrea Scrosati, Sky Italia’s VP for programming and promotion, says that while it’s too early to discuss any channel strategies, “more competition is better for the market, and especially for consumers.”\n\nMediaset chairman Fedele Confalonieri, who earlier blasted “submissive” European bureaucrats for sucking up to Murdoch, said at a meeting with press and investors in Milan on March 23: “We were born from competition. We thrive on competition. Nothing Sky can do in free TV scares us. It’s a field where we have been the undisputed leader for years.”\n\nSky, however, will also benefit when restrictions the European Union slapped on the company in 2003 expire. That’s the year Sky was created from the merger between Stream and Telepiu and came to dominate the pay TV landscape.\n\nSky will be able to bid for exclusive rights across different platforms — pay TV, free TV, mobile and Internet. It won’t be limited to two-year packages for sports and three-year packages for film rights deals.\n\nCapitalizing on this change, Sky Italia nabbed four out of five media rights packages for soccer’s 2012-2015 UEFA Champions League in Italy for €130 million ($172 million) — a hefty sum.\n\nMediaset vice-chairman Pier Silvio Berlusconi, Silvio Berlusconi’s oldest son, says the company plans to spend about $42 million this year on its pay service, Mediaset Premium, to develop new channels and to work on “non-linear” offerings, like the Premium Net TV web service it announced in February. The investment could keep the company from breaking even this year.\n\n“Our goal is not to focus on short-term profits, but to construct a business that is sustainable in the medium- to long-term,” the younger Berlusconi says. “It’s like there are two big teams and we both want to win.”\n\nThe company is beefing up its free-to-air offerings with new niche channels to serve a fragmenting market. They include a news channel and a network geared toward young males that will debut in fall or early 2012.\n\nAccording to EU regulations, Sky Italia must use the new spectrum it’s awarded for free-to-air channels for five years, after which it could potentially shift them to pay.\n\nSome analysts wonder about the potential costs of programming a bevy of new free channels.\n\nSky has one free-to-air channel, Cielo, while Mediaset is the nation’s biggest commercial broadcaster, with channels including juggernaut Canale 5, Italia 1 and Rete 4. The company is a huge producer of TV content and owns film studio Medusa and giant advertising sales group Publitalia.\n\nIn some cases, the pay TV rights that Sky buys for content also come with free-to-air rights that, until now, the satcaster hasn’t been able to use. That could keep programming costs in check, says a source close to Sky.\n\nAnd the channels could provide the intangible benefit of being able to advertise the pay TV business on free-to-air TV without having to go through Mediaset. The rivals have spent lots of time fighting over each other’s commercial spots — what they say, when or if they air.\n\nAt one time, Murdoch and Berlusconi used to be friendly. They’re both decidedly right of center. They both installed offspring in top positions at their publicly traded companies. They both like boats. In 2000, Berlusconi bought Murdoch’s yacht, Morning Glory.\n\nBut the sparring has been ongoing ever since Mediaset entered the pay TV business — Sky Italia’s turf.\n\nWith Mediaset commanding 65% of the advertising market, Sky cried monopoly. And with Mediaset’s owner running the country, Sky claimed foul in 2008 when the government doubled the value-added tax its subscribers pay on their bills to 20%. Another law limited the commercial time available to pay TV companies, but raised it for free-to-air channels.\n\nSky CEO Tom Mockridge bashed Paolo Romani, the Minister for Economic Development, for aggressively lobbying against Sky’s inclusion in the contest for DTT channels. Romani lobbied the EU aggressively to keep Sky out.\n\nIn retaliation, Mediaset calls Sky Italia a pay TV monopoly that dominates the market.\n\nAt the March 23 meet, Pier Silvio Berlusconi painted Sky Italia not just as a threat to Mediaset, but as an almost existential menace to “the entire Italian TV industry.”\n\nHe was playing to a mood in the country these days as Italy seems to be selling itself off piece by piece, and pols are sounding the alarm.\n\nLouis Vuitton just bought Bulgari, the French are after Parmalat and making a run at one of the country’s biggest insurance companies. Finance Minister Giuliano Tremonti is up in arms, and the government last week passed a decree to slow the deals down and allow time for Italian bidders to come forward.\n\nMediaset, however, has substantial foreign holdings.\n\nAnalysts Stateside are generally upbeat about Sky Italia, although it reps only a small part of News Corp.’s sprawling business. (The parent company and Wall Street are currently preoccupied with News Corp.’s attempt to buy the 61% of BSkyB it doesn’t own.)\n\n“I think things are only going to get better for Sky Italia. It’s in an attractive, under-penetrated market, and News Corp. has a very long-time horizon,” says Chris Marangi of Gabelli & Co. in New York.\n\nOf course, the Italian TV industry rests largely in the hands of Silvio Berlusconi, whose political fortunes have been precarious since last summer.\n\nThe general consensus had once been that he was toast, but he has gained more political allies in recent months despite that fact that his popularity has taken a hit due to a sex scandal.\n\nHe’s also dealing with fraud allegations, some involving Mediaset’s Hollywood content. If he doesn’t fall to a vote of no confidence or early elections, he can’t be unseated until general elections in 2013 — if he runs.\n\nAnd Berlusconi’s political resurgence can only add fuel to Italy’s TV wars."
