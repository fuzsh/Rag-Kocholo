        "text": "By now, you've already heard about the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Since the data protection law was introduced on May 25, 2018, it has massively shaped how organizations collect, store, and process data.\n\nBig Tech companies such as Google, Twitter, and Meta (formerly Facebook) have all received whopping fines for noncompliance. And any business that conducts online operations can be hit by these fines, not just the Big Tech companies.\n\nThis post focuses on the biggest GDPR fines handed out so far for businesses only. We have a separate post for GDPR fines for individuals where we detail personal liabilities under the GDPR.\n\nWhat is the Maximum Fine for GDPR Violations?\n\nArticle 83(5) of the GDPR outlines the framework for the maximum GDPR fine. It says that the fine can be up to 20 million euros or 4% of the firm's annual global revenue, whichever is higher. In some situations, the fine can be set at 10 million euros or 2% of the revenue — a provision highlighted in Article 83(4) of the GDPR. What's more, each European Union state is also able to establish its own penalty for infringements that are not already covered by Article 83. These penalties are covered in the flexibility clause of the GDPR.\n\nThe maximum fine given so far to a company is Meta in 2023, which was fined $1.3 billion for violating GDPR laws pertaining to data transfers.\n\n1. Meta - €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion)\n\nYear Issued: 2023\n\nThe U.S. technology giant was fined an eye-watering $1.3 billion USD in May '23 after an Irish court ruled that it violated GDPR laws related to data transfers between the E.U. and the U.S.\n\nThis transfer was previously given legal cover under the E.U. - U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, which was struck down in 2020 after the presiding court determined that it lacked the necessary protections for EU citizens against government surveillance.\n\nMeta's fine is now officially the biggest GDPR fine to date, replacing Amazon's in 2021.\n\n2. Amazon - €746 million ($781 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2021\n\nThe second biggest GDPR fine to date was imposed on Amazon Europe by Luxembourg’s National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD). This was after establishing that the online retailer was not getting consent from its users before storing advertisement cookies.\n\n3. Instagram - €405 million ($427 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2022\n\nIn September 2022, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) fined Instagram for violating children's privacy online, including publishing kids' phone numbers and email addresses.\n\nThe EU regulator found that Instagram operated a user registration system which could lead to the accounts of child users being set to “public” by default, unless changed to “private.”\n\nThis went against the privacy by design guidelines of the GDPR as well as provisions aimed at enhancing the protection of children’s information\n\n4. TikTok - €345 million ($377 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2023\n\nThe Irish Data Protection Commission fined streaming app TikTok for failing to shield underage users’ content from public view. TikTok had violated GDPR conventions by placing underage users’ accounts as public setting by default; users aged between 13 and 17 were steered through the sign-up process in a way that resulted in their accounts being set to public – meaning anyone can see an account’s content or comment on it.\n\n5. Facebook - €265 million ($275 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2022\n\nThe Irish DPC fined Facebook €265 million after personal data was found on an online hacking forum.\n\nAccording to the reports, the data was found on a website for hackers and included names, Facebook IDs, phone numbers, locations, birthdates, and email addresses of people from more than 100 countries.\n\nInvestigators concluded that the data had been \"scraped\" from Facebook using tools designed to help people find their friends through phone numbers using search and contact import features.\n\n6. WhatsApp - €225 million ($247 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2021\n\nThe Irish DPC fined Meta-owned WhatsApp for not properly explaining its data processing practices in its privacy notice.\n\nThe investigation into WhatsApp started in 2018, and focused on whether the company had done enough to specify how it handles customer data. Regulators eventually decided that the company had not been transparent enough about the mechanisms it uses to store and share data, imposing one of the largest GDPR fines to date.\n\n7. Google LLC - €150 million ($169 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2021\n\nFrance’s data regulator, CNIL, issued a €150 million fine on Google for using noncompliant cookie consent mechanisms, making it difficult for users to refuse cookies on Google and YouTube.\n\nThe government body found that refusing cookies was a cumbersome process compared to accepting them, thereby violating GDPR laws.\n\n8. Facebook - €60 million ($66 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2021\n\nThe French data regulator CNIL also imposed a €60 million fine on Facebook for the same noncompliant cookie consent practices as Google. Facebook's parent company, Meta, was deemed to have made it difficult for customers to refuse cookie consent, thereby violating GDPR law.\n\n9. Google - €50 million ($57 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2019\n\nThe French data privacy regulator CNIL fined Google €50 million for not being transparent with its users about how data was being collected and used for targeted advertising.\n\nGoogle was determined to be ambiguous about how it used consented data — users had no way of knowing what the company was doing with their information and how the data would be used for ad personalization.\n\n10. Criteo - €40 million ($44 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2023\n\nFrench advertising technology company Criteo was hit with a revised fine of €40 million ($44 million) over failings to collect and store adequate consent records.\n\nThe case first started in 2018 when a formal complaint landed in the office of the Commission Nationale de l’informatique et des libertés (CNIL), France’s data privacy watchdog, citing a violation of GDPR regulations. None of Your Business (NOYB), an Austria-based nonprofit co-founded by lawyer and privacy activist Max Schrems, and Privacy International were the two parties that filed the compliant.\n\nIn August 2022, CNIL found Criteo guilty of using tracking and data-processing techniques to profile internet users for granular ad targeting, such as predicting which products an online shopper might want to buy — or “behavioural modelling.”\n\nCriteo was fined €60 million, which the company said was \"vastly disproportionate\" and vowed to contest the ruling. Roughly a year later, the fine was reduced by a third to €40 million with CNIL saying it found five GDPR infringements involving Criteo’s ad-tracking activities.\n\n11. H&M - €35 million ($41 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2020\n\nThe German Data Protection Authority fined H&M €35 million for illegal monitoring of its employees.\n\nThe company kept \"excessive\" records on the families, religions and illnesses of its workforce at its Nuremberg service centre, including extensive staff surveys, details of holidays, medical symptoms and diagnoses for illnesses.\n\nSome managers also sought further details about family issues or religious beliefs, which were then used to evaluate work performance and make employment decisions.\n\n12. TIM - €27.8 million ($31.5 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2020\n\nItalian telecommunications operator TIM was fined by the Italian data protection regulator, Garante, for various violations regarding customer data. Specifically, the operator was cited to have made excessive advertising phone calls without having obtained the required consent.\n\n13. Enel Energia - €26.5 million ($29.3 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2022\n\nThe Italian data protection authority fined electric and gas supplier Enel Energia for the unlawful use of user data for telemarketing purposes. Specifically, the authority found that the company had not respected data subject rights, and continued to use personal data for marketing purposes despite clear instructions not to.\n\n14. British Airways - €22 million ($26 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2020\n\nThe ICO fined British Airways for a failure to implement data privacy controls, leading to a cybersecurity breach that affected 400,000 customers.\n\nThe breach took place in 2018 and affected both personal and credit card data. Investigators concluded that the company did not have sufficient security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, thereby violating GDPR guidelines.\n\n15. Marriott International - €20.4 million ($23.8 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2020\n\nThe British ICO issued a €20.4 million fine to Marriott International for failing to secure customers' personal data.\n\nThe data breach in question compromised nearly 339 million guest records, including seven million records of U.K. residents.\n\nThe breach accessed personal data, including guests’ names, email addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers, arrival/departure information, VIP status, and loyalty programme membership number.\n\n16. Clearview AI - €20 million ($20.5 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2022\n\nItaly’s data protection agency fined this facial recognition firm €20 million for breaches of EU law. Specifically, it found that the personal data held by the company, including biometric and geolocation information, were processed unlawfully without an appropriate legal basis.\n\n17. Facebook Ireland Ltd - €17 million ($18.2 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2022\n\nThe Irish DPC fined Meta Platforms Ireland after the company could not readily demonstrate the security measures it had established to protect EU users’ data.\n\nThe DPC investigated a series of data breaches between 7 June 2018 and 4 December 2018 to see whether the company achieved compliance with the requirements of GDPR Articles 5(1)(f), 5(2), 24(1) and 32(1).\n\nMeta was eventually found to be in violation of Articles 5(2) and 24(1) GDPR, thereby triggering the fine.\n\n18. Wind Tre - €16.7 million ($18.4 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2020\n\nThe Italian data regulator Garante imposed a €16.7 million fine on telecoms company Wind Tre for several unlawful direct marketing activities.\n\nThe fine was imposed following complaints of unsolicited marketing communications. Users said they were inundated by texts, emails, faxes, and automated phone calls despite never giving consent for marketing puposes.\n\nIn some other cases, users’ personal data had been included in public phone listings despite objections made by those users.\n\n19. Deutsche Wohnen - €14.5 million ($15.3 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2019\n\nThe Data Protection Authority of Germany issued a €14.5 million fine on German real estate company Deutsche Wohnen for not complying with general data processing principles.\n\nAn inspection of the company’s data archiving systems revealed that it did not allow the company to delete obsolete personal data. The company was also retaining data relating to the tenants’ personal life and creditworthiness considerably longer than necessary to fulfil the purpose for which the data was initially collected.\n\n20. Vodafone Italia - €12.3 million ($14.5 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2020\n\nThe Italian data regulator fined Vodafone Italia for using customer data for marketing activities without consent.\n\nIt found that Vodafone unlawfully processed the personal data of millions of users for telemarketing purposes, after receiving a deluge of complaints from users expressing annoyance with unsolicited phone calls.\n\n21. Eni Gas e Luce - €11.5 million ($12.7 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2020\n\nThe Italian Supervisory Authority (ISA) issued two separate fines totalling €11.5 million on Eni Gas e Luce, an Italian electricity and gas supplier.\n\nThe first fine (€8.5 million) was issued because Eni was illegally processing personal data for telemarketing purposes, while the second fine (€3 million) was imposed for using unsolicited contracts as well as forged information on those contracts.\n\n22. Notebookbilliger.de - €10.4 million (11.5 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2021\n\nThe Lower Saxony data protection authority fined German electronics retailer Notebooksbilliger for monitoring its employees illegally.\n\nThe retailer violated the tenets of the GDPR by conducting video surveillance of its employees; cameras were installed in the employees’ common areas, workplaces, warehouses, and sales points.\n\nIt was done without a proper lawful basis and kept for significantly longer than necessary, for at least two years.\n\n23. Google LLC (again) - €10 million ($10.5 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2022\n\nThe Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) fined Google LLC for transferring personal data unlawfully and hindering the right to erasure.\n\nGoogle acted against GDPR tenets by sharing personally identifiable data with a third-party contractor, including names, email addresses, the type of removal request, and the reported URL. The AEPD found that Google also did not anonymize the user's personal data, either.\n\n24. Austrian Post - €9.5 million ($10.2 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2021\n\nThe Austrian Data Protection Authority (DPA) imposed a €9.5 million fine on the Austrian Post for not fulfilling data subject rights properly. The agency determined that customers were not given enough options to request a copy of their data or have enough contact options on the Austrian Post website.\n\n25. Vodafone Spain - €8.15 million ($9.72 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2021\n\nThe Spanish Agency for Data Protection (AEPD) fined Vodafone Spain, a mobile telephone network operator, for violating GDPR and Spanish laws on telecommunications and cookies.\n\nThe agency opened an investigation in 2018 after receiving 191 complaints about calls and messages on behalf of Vodafone without any prior authorization or consent. The outcome of that investigation slapped a large fine on Vodafone.\n\n26. REWE International - €8 million ($8.8 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2022\n\nREWE International, an Austrian food retailer, was fined by the Austrian DPA for mishandling the data of users in its loyalty program.\n\nThe loyalty program, known as jö Bonus Club, had been collecting users’ data without their consent and using it for marketing purposes.\n\n27. Grindr - €6.5 million ($7 million)\n\nYear Issued: 2021\n\nNorway’s Data Protection Authority fined Grindr, a US-based dating app, for sending personal data to third parties without consent.
