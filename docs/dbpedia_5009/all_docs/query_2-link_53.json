If id keyword is also supplied, subsequent calls will open in the last opened directory, which can be different from dir.\n\nfilter (str) â the list of filters that can be applied to this directory. the format is \"Filetype1 (*.ex1);;Filetype2 (*.ex2 *.ex3)\".\n\nselectedFilter (str) â the filter used by default. if not specified, the first filter in the filters string is used.\n\noptions (qfiledialog.option enum) â see the qfiledialog.option and qfiledialog.setoptions documentation\n\ndefault_suffix (str) â the suffix applied to a filename if the user does supply one. the suffix will have a leading â.â appended to it.\n\ndefault_filename (str) â A default base filename to use to save files in save dialogs. By default, the filename field of the dialog is blank.\n\naccept_label (str) â the text on the âacceptâ button\n\naccept_mode (qfiledialog.acceptmode) â whether the dialog is in open or save mode. see the pyqt documentation for qfiledialog.acceptmode (currently acceptopen and acceptsave are the two options)\n\nfile_mode (qfiledialog.filemode) â what the user can select. see the pyqt documentation for qfiledialog.filemode (currently anyfile, existingfile, directory and existingfiles are the options)\n\nconfirm (bool) â true if a confirmation dialog should be used if the user selects an existing file, false if not\n\ncustom_sidebar (bool) â True if the Schrodinger sidebar should be used, False if the default PyQt sidebar should be used.\n\nsidebar_links (dict) â Used to create extra links in the left-hand sidebar of the dialog. The keys of the dictionary are a unique identifier for each link (note that âhomeâ and âworkingâ are already used), and the values are tuples of the form (path, name) where path and name are str, path indicates the path the sidebar link points to, and name is the name displayed for the link.\n\nid (str, int or float) â The identifier used for this dialog. Dialogs with the same identifier will remember the last directory chosen by the user with any dialog of the same id and open in that directory. The dir keyword parameter can be used to override the initial directory the dialog opens in, but the chosen directory will still be stored for the next time a dialog with the same identifier opens. The default (no id given) is to not remember the chosen directory. Additionally, the id is used to keep track of recent places for the given file dialog."
