KDE has the goal of providing software which does this in a way that reduces software's environmental impact.\n\nLetâs make energy efficient software and digital sustainability part of our community. We can live up to our responsibility for this and future generations!\n\nJoin KDE Eco\n\nKDE Eco Handbook\n\nThe handbook âApplying The Blue Angel Criteria To Free Softwareâ gives an overview of the environmental harm driven by software and how the Blue Angel ecolabelâthe official environmental label of the German governmentâprovides a benchmark for sustainable software design. Learn how Free Softwareâs values of transparency and user autonomy foster sustainability, as well as how to set up a dedicated lab to measure your softwareâs energy consumption!"
