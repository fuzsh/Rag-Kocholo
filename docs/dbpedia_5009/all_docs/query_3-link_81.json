        "text": "Details\n\nHow Talstar P Works\n\nTalstar P is a liquid concentrate insecticide which contains bifenthrin, a synthetic pyrethroid. Pyrethroids work by disrupting an insect's nervous system causing a weakened state followed by death. Talstar P does not provide an instant knockdown of pests, rather, pests pick up the residual active ingredient by contact. Talstar P is a repellent insecticide since it acts quickly enough that social insects such as ants cannot create a pheromone trail. This means that Talstar P will be most effective as a barrier with a thorough application. Talstar P residual can last up to 3 months.\n\nTalstar P Sizes Available\n\nTalstar P comes in a variety of sizes to help you get exactly the amount you need. Talstar ¾ Gallon (96 ounces) is one of our most popular sizes. Talstar also comes in Gallon (128 oz), Quart (32 oz), and Pint (16 oz) sizes.\n\nTarget Insects\n\nTalstar P controls over 75 different insects -- everything from stink bugs, bed bugs, spiders, mosquitoes, cockroaches, ticks and fleas to pillbugs, chinch bugs, earwigs, millipedes, Dichondra Flea Beetles, spittlebugs and more. It is very effective on Japanese Beetles, clover mites, ants, termites, spiders, scorpions, roaches, army worms, mealybugs, mites, grasshoppers, pillbugs, cutworms, sod webworms, weevils, leaf miners, box elder bugs, bees, wasps, sowbugs, crickets, and turf and ornamental pests.

Talstar P provides a long-lasting barrier around the perimeters of structures for crawling insects such as ants, beetles, and roaches; protects ornamental plants from hazardous pests like mealybugs; helps control nuisance flying insects such as mosquitoes; protects lawns from turf pests such as chinch bugs; and even has an expanded label to include treatment of stink bugs. See below for complete list of approved usage sites.\n\nApplication Instructions\n\nInside, outside, and around the perimeter of structures, food handling areas, lawns, turf and ornamental trees and shrubs. NOT for use on food and vegetable gardens. Talstar is best applied with a sprayer. Always read the label completely before use.\n\nYield\n\n1 pint (16 oz.) concentrate yields 16-32 gallons of finished solution.\n\n1 quart (32 oz.) concentrate yields 32-96 gallons of finished solution.\n\n3/4 gallon (96 oz.) concentrate yields 96-192 gallons of finished solution.\n\n1 gallon (128 oz.) concentrate yields 128-256 gallons of finished solution or covers 128,000 to 256,000 square feet for broadcast application.\n\nStandard Application Dilution Rates / Mixing Rates:\n\n0.33 oz./gallon of water – 0.02% - prevention, low level infestions\n\n0.5 oz./gallon of water – 0.031% – general indoor or outdoor use\n\n1.0 oz./gallon of water - 0.06% - severe infestations, less frequent treatments, longer residual, quicker knockdown\n\n1 gallon of finished solution should cover 1,000 square feet when using a hand pump sprayer.\n\n* See the video above for general use mixing and application instruction using a sprayer like the Chapin premier 1 gallon sprayer.\n\nUse in the Following Areas:\n\nIndoors and outdoors on residential, institutional, public, commercial, and industrial buildings, greenhouses, animal confinement facilities/livestock premises, kennels, food handling establishments, and lawns, ornamentals, parks, recreational areas and athletic fields; trees, shrubs, foliage plants, non-bearing fruit and nut trees, and flowers in greenhouses, interiorscapes, including hotels, shopping malls, office buildings, etc., and outdoor plantscapes, such as around residential dwellings, parks, institutional buildings, recreational areas, athletic fields and home lawns (Non-bearing crops are perennial crops that will not produce a harvestable raw agricultural commodity during the season of application); feed and food handling establishments, animal confinement facilities, kennels, confined animal feeding operations, livestock premises, and in/around/under structures\n\nIndoors\n\nUse 0.33 to 1 fluid oz. per gallon of water for residual pest control in buildings and structures and on modes of transport. Apply either as a crack and crevice, pinstream, spot, coarse, low pressure spray (25 psi or less) or with a paint brush.\n\nApply as a coarse, low pressure, crack and crevice or spot spray to areas where pests hide, such as baseboards, corners, storage areas, closets, around water pipes, doors and windows, attics and eaves, behind and under refrigerators, cabinets, sinks, furnaces, stoves, the underside of shelves, drawers and similar areas.\n\nDo not use as a space spray.\n\nPay particular attention to cracks and crevices.\n\nLimit repeat application to no more than once per seven days.\n\nTalstar P may be converted to a foam for residual treatment of voids or as a spot spray when visual marking of application is desired.\n\nBedbug Control\n\nThorough application should be made to crack and crevices where evidence of bed bugs occurs. This includes bed frames, boxsprings, inside empty dressers and clothes closets and carpet edges, high and low wall moldings and wallpaper edges. Do not use this product on bed linens, pillows, mattresses or clothes. Remove all clothes and other articles from dressers or clothes closets before application. Allow all treated areas to thoroughly dry before use. Not recommended for use as sole protection against bedbugs. If evidence of bedbugs is found in/on mattresses, use products approved for this use.\n\nOutdoors\n\nGeneral application for crawling pests - Mix 0.5 or 1 oz. of Talstar P in one gallon of water and apply to the outside foundation of the home, approx. 3 feet up the side of the house and 2 feet out from the house. Also spray entry points into the home such as around windows, pipes, doorways, etc. For general preventative treatment, apply Talstar P once every 3 months.\n\nRepeat applications should be limited to no more than once per seven days when using 0.33 oz./gal. of water. For the high use rate of 1.0 oz. per gallon of water, do not apply more than once every four weeks.\n\nMosquitos\n\nIn addition to the treatment around the foundation of the home as mentioned above, spray Talstar P on the underside of leaves on the lower-hanging branches of trees around the backyard or area where mosquitoes are a problem. You can also spray the underside of leaves on shrubs and ornamentals. Do not apply when wind speed exceeds 10 MPH.\n\nHigher application volumes may be used to obtain the desired coverage of dense vegetation or landscaping materials.\n\nBagworms\n\nUse 0.125 to 0.25 oz. per 1,000 square feet (or 5.4 - 10.8 oz. per 100 gal.). Apply as a full coverage foliar spray. Use of a Chapin Slide Pump Sprayer will help reach higher into trees. Apply when larvae begin to hatch and spray larvae directly. Applications when larvae are young will be most effective.\n\nChinch Bugs\n\nUse 0.5 to 1.0 oz. per 1,000 square feet. Chinch Bugs infest the base of grass plants and are often found in the thatch layer. Irrigation of the grass area before treatment will optimize the penetration of the insecticide to the area where the chinch bugs are located. Use higher volume applications if the thatch layer is excessive or if a relatively long mowing height is being maintained. Chinch Bugs can be one of the most difficult pests to control in grasses and the higher application rates (Up to 1 fluid oz. per 1000 square feet) may be required to control populations that contain both nymphs and adults during the middle of the summer.\n\nLawn Applications\n\nA hose end sprayer like the Chapin hose end sprayer may be used to apply Talstar P for lawn pests. Use up to 1.0 oz. per 1,000 square feet. Higher volume applications may be more effective with some pests, so you may want to calibrate the sprayer to a lower rate (for example, 0.25 oz/gal.) and use more water to cover a 1,000 square foot area.\n\nStink Bugs\n\nTalstar P has an expanded label for treatment of Stink Bugs indoors, outdoors, on lawns, and on ornamental plants. Use 0.33 to 1.0 oz/gal. of water and treat around door frames, window frames, vents, eaves, around the bottom of your foundation, and any other crack or crevice where an insect could gain entry, once a month August-November.\n\nTermite Applications\n\nTalstar P may be used for pre-construction or post-construction prevention of subterranean termites. Use 1.0 oz/gal. of water (0.06% solution) for most termite applications. For preconstruction horizontal barriers (such as under a concrete slab), use 1 gallon of solution per 10 square feet. For perimeter barrier treatments, use 4 gallons of solution per 10 linear feet. See our article How to Do a Termite Treatment, for further instructions on perimeter termite treatments. See product label for full instructions on using Talstar P to control subterranean termites.\n\nFeatures\n\nPet safe when dry\n\nVirtually no odor or staining\n\nEasy to remember mixing rate\n\nConvenient squeeze-and-pour container makes measuring and mixing easy\n\nTalstar P Professional Insecticide may be tank-mixed with adjuvants and with other pesticides, including insect growth regulators.\n\nTalstar P is tough on pests and easy on everything else: Talstar P multi-insecticide is water-based and contains no alpha cyano group.

Plus it provides a barrier that termites can't penetrate, for superior structural protection.\n\nExtra Tips for Using\n\nAllow at least 30 minutes after application before allowing pets or children into the treatment area. Allow 24 hours after outdoor application before expected rainfall or watering for best results. Some outdoor applications may require irrigation before or after application.\n\nUse with an IGR such as NyGuard IGR for control of all life stages of insects such as fleas.\n\nStore out of direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.\n\nConcentrate should be viable for 3-5 years. If separation occurs, shake well before using.\n\nDo not apply more than 1 oz. Talstar P per 1,000 square feet.\n\nCompare to: Bifen I/T"
