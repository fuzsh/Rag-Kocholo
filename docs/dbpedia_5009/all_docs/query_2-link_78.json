        "text": "CDER established the Interdisciplinary Review Team (IRT) for QT studies in 2006 to provide expert and consistent review advice to sponsors and review divisions within the FDA on the design and interpretation of thorough QT studies. In addition, the IRT evaluates the potential for drugs to cause torsade de pointes using an integrated approach of nonclinical assays as described by the Comprehensive In Vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) initiative, and clinical ECG data.\n\nIn 2018 the FDA issued a draft guidance on the assessment of the pressor effects of drugs. The scope of the IRT was subsequently expanded to include providing consistent review advice on the design and interpretation of safety blood pressure studies, including ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) studies.\n\nThe IRT is a consulting review team within the Division of Cardiology and Nephrology (DCN) that consists of clinical reviewers and analysts, clinical pharmacologists, statisticians, safety pharmacologists, project manager, data specialists and representatives from the Division of Applied Regulatory Science (DARS).\n\nThe IRT can answer general and scientific questions related to proarrhythmia and blood pressure evaluation. However, all drug product-specific questions should be directed to the appropriate Clinical Review Division.\n\nCurrent Advice *\n\nProarrhythmic Risk Assessment\n\nQT Evaluation Report Submission Checklist updated 11/09/22 (DOC - 31 KB)\n\nClinical Pharmacology and Cardiac Safety Table updated 1/05/23 (DOC - 66 KB)\n\nIntegrated Nonclinical Risk Tables updated 1/05/23 (DOC - 50 KB)\n\nSubmitting Clinical Trial Datasets for Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential of Drugs – Technical Specifications Document and Proarrhythmic Potential of Drugs – Technical Specifications Document updated 6/21/19 (PDF - 581 KB)\n\nSubmitting ECG Waveform Data (Frequently Asked Questions) updated 10/08/21 (PDF- 168 KB)\n\nIn Vitro Ion Channel Protocols updated 8/11/21 (PDF - 152 KB)\n\nGuidance for Industry: E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs\n\nGuidance for Industry: S7B Nonclinical Evaluation of the Potential for Delayed Ventricular Repolarization (QT Interval Prolongation) by Human Pharmaceuticals\n\nGuidance for Industry: E14 and S7B Clinical and Nonclinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential--Questions and Answers\n\nDraft Guidance for Industry: QTc Information in Human Prescription Drug and Biological Product Labeling\n\nAmbulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring Studies\n\nDraft Guidance for Industry: Assessment of Pressor Effects of Drugs\n\n* Content is subject to change without notice\n\nSelected References\n\nWu WW, et al.
