        "text": "So for one of my projects I was dissatisfied with the fact that a QLabel whose horizontal size policy is Qt::Ignored will have its text clipped instead of having an ellipsis at the end (or somewhere in there). I whipped together a simple extension to QLabel that puts an ellipsis at the end based on the current size of the label. It's not complete in general (e.g., doesn't really support multiple lines), but for me it gets the job done. Feel free to use this code for whatever purpose you please (i.e., it's in the public domain).\n\nelidedlabel.hpp\n\nelidedlabel.cpp"
