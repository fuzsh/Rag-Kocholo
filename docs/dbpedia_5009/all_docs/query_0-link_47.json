        "text": "\"Do you really think that you can become an idol just like that!?\"\n\n―Momoi Airi (Original)\n\n\"Wouldn't it be amazing if we could deliver hope to everyone?\"\n\n――Momoi Airi (Brand New World)\n\nMomoi Airi (桃井愛莉), Momoi Airi is a third-year student at Miyamasuzaka Girls Academy. She is a member of the idol group MORE MORE JUMP!\n\nBackground\n\nThis section may contain spoilers from the story, please read at your own risk!\n\nAiri used to be a TV personality, appearing on many variety shows. She's very confident to the point of coming off as pushy sometimes. Despite being very passionate and invested in her budding idol career, something happened that resulted in her quitting her talent agency.\n\n—Profile\n\n❝\n\n❞\n\nAiri wanted to become an idol when she was young, as she admired the way they danced, sang and made people smile, and wanted to be able to do the same. At the same time, she wanted to be more girlish, as she was made fun of for being a tomboy and getting into fights with boys.[1] Airi was mainly inspired by an idol named Rainbow Garland, who was also the first idol she became a fan of.[2]\n\nAiri later debuted as a member of the idol group QT. She was a popular idol that appeared on many variety shows. One of her most well-known TV personas was The Masked Variety Idol, Happy Everyday.[3] Due to her talent working in television, her agency urged her to stop being an idol and to become a TV personality instead. Upon overhearing her manager outright saying that Airi is very average as an idol, she rejected this offer, resulting in her quitting the group.\n\nAiri seemingly gave up her dream of being an idol. She even insulted Minori when they first met and said that she has no chance at becoming an idol. However, seeing Minori's spirit, she was reinvigorated by her determination to reach her dream, thus agreeing to train Minori and create MORE MORE JUMP! with Haruka and Airi's former rival Shizuku.\n\nShe is the middle child of her family, having one older sister and one younger sister.[4] Her father is a good cook, as Airi mentions him making her and her sisters lunch and Christmas Cake.[5]\n\nAiri is part of the Miyamasuzaka credit course alongside Shizuku.[6] As a second year, Airi was classmates with Shizuku in class 2-D. As a third year, she is classmates with Shizuku in class 3-E.\n\nAppearance\n\nAiri has reddish-pink eyes and long, messy coral pink hair that falls below her shoulder blades, with two clumps of hair tied into small loose fluffy pigtails near the top. Her voice is energetic and lively.\n\nCasual Outfit\n\nFor Airi's casual outfit, she wears a chunky light yellow turtleneck sweater and loose light yellow shorts held up with a belt of the same color. The twin-tails at the top of her head are held up by short yellow ribbons. While she's practicing, Airi sports black sweatpants with a yellow hem, one leg rolled up to her knee. She has a honey yellow crop-top with a white sleeve that slightly intrudes into the yellow of the shirt. Under her shirt she has a white, also cropped undershirt, the left side having a black-and-white checker pattern. Her hair still has the same yellow ribbons.\n\nIn her third year, her casual outfit consists of a grayish blue, turtleneck sweater with long sleeves under a pastel yellow suspender skirt with a zipper down the front, and a gold bracelet on her right wrist. Her hair ties are also longer.\n\nUnit Outfit\n\nAiri shares a similar outfit to that of the rest of her group members: a white sleeveless blouse with a black ribbon underneath a vest, a black and white ruffled skirt with multiple layers, a loose black belt adorned with the group's three-leaf clover motif, and white heeled shoes. The design of Airi's vest is similar to Shizuku's. Airi's outfit differs the most from her members, in the way that her blouse is cropped above the waist. Additionally, she has the color pink accenting her outfit, a white ruffled arm band on her upper left arm, and white bracelet-like sleeves.\n\nHer group's new uniform consists of a white double-breasted coat with flouncy sleeves, a dark gray belt adorned with the group's three-leaf clover motif, a skirt over a longer white skirt, and white heeled shoes. The coat neckline, overskirt, and shoe cuffs have a blue plaid appearance. Accessories include dark gray ribbons pinned with gold three-leaf clovers, white wrist cuffs, and three-leaf clover ribbon hair ties. Her outfit's accent color is pink. Unlike her group members, her coat is cropped above her waist.\n\nPersonality\n\nAiri is strong-minded and comes across as pushy to some. According to Minori, she is strict but reliable. She is very protective of her friends and family, and hates bullies. She was more tomboyish as a child, though that was frequently shot down by her mother. Airi retains some of her headstrong attitude, though cares greatly for her friends as well as her siblings, taking a sisterly role with both.[7]\n\nBefore joining her unit, she would frequently think back on her past, bitter of how her agency ended up using her as a TV personality and disregarded her idol activities completely. When she would do this, she'd become snappy and irrational to those who would confront her about her attitude, insulting them, only to feel guilty afterwards.\n\nEtymology\n\nMomoi (桃井): Momo (桃) means \"peach\" and I (井) means \"a well\". In the language of flowers, the peach flower means \"I am your captive\", \"invincible\", or \"charming\".[8] Momoi is also a place in Tokyo's Suginami Ward.\n\nAiri (愛莉): Ai (愛) means \"love\" and Ri (莉) means \"white jasmine\". She is named after her mom's favorite actress.[9]\n\nGame Interactions\n\nA list of characters Airi interacts with in the game.\n\nRelationships\n\nSubpage: Relationships\n\nThis section may contain spoilers from the story, please read at your own risk!\n\nHanasato Minori: A fellow group member and good friend. Airi coaches her and respects her dedication and spirit. Although she initially doubted whether Minori would actually become an idol, she was reinvigorated by her determination to reach her dream. While Airi can be harsh with training, she genuinely cares for her, not letting her overwork herself. Despite their rough start, the two can understand each other's struggles in a way their other group members cannot due to having similar experiences in the past. In the Chasing The Sparkle Beyond the Blue Sky event, Airi gives Minori pointers and expresses how she used to be like her in that they both tried copying others.\n\nKiritani Haruka: A fellow group member and friend. Haruka thinks Airi is greatly undervalued in the idol world. Airi admires Haruka's natural charm and poise, and often reminds her to take breaks. Prior to the main story, the two had both known about eachother and their respective groups, though Airi was reluctant to speak to her due to thinking she was just some \"big shot idol\". Meanwhile, Airi had left an impression on Haruka for her work ethic and dedication after she saw a short section including her for a show.\n\nIn the Happy Lovely Everyday! event, Haruka was the first person to notice that something was wrong with Airi, and had convinced her to do a solo show for the elementary school children in order to cheer her up and show her that she’s liked for who she is.\n\nHinomori Shizuku: A fellow group member and her close friend. The two debuted as idols at the same time and worked at the same agency. Although Airi regarded Shizuku as a rival, they supported each other and helped each other get through their debuts. Unfortunately, as their careers took off, Airi began to feel jealous of Shizuku's beauty and success. In the main story, Airi becomes bitter after being reminded about her past and blows up at Shizuku when the other tries to comfort her. Despite her harsh words, it is shown that Airi cares deeply about Shizuku, as she apologizes for her misjudgment and stands up for Shizuku against the other Cheerful*Days members. After forming MORE MORE JUMP!, the two become closer and Airi often acts protective of her. In Shizuku's pre-upgraded cards, it is a running gag to see Airi trying to prevent, and usually failing, Shizuku from spilling something while Shizuku gets distracted by someone or something nearby. The two are also classmates.\n\nTenma Saki: Saki is a big fan of Airi and used to watch the variety programs Airi starred in while she was hospitalized. Airi is surprised after Saki meets at her school and asks for both an autograph and a handshake, before encouraging Saki to shake her hand as many times as she wants.[10] They later interact more in the Secret ♡ Operation Valentine's Day event, where they team up together with Emu to make Valentine's Day's sweets for their respective groups.\n\nShinonome Akito: Airi's acquaintance. They met in middle school, and she greeted him every once in a while when she visited the Shinonome household. It’s implied that she and Akito aren't particularly close, as Akito regards her the same way as he does other acquaintances, and she has mentioned on occasion that they don’t talk very often.\n\nIt was revealed in a side story that Airi once went to Akito about Ena's issues with her father, which Ena had been hiding from Airi at the time.[11] Out of gratitude for all that Ena had done for her and worrying that she can't do much for Ena herself, Airi asked Akito to look after Ena in her place. This request is reflected in their Trust Rank title \"Still, That Day's Promise\" and their team title \"Secret Request\".\n\nShiraishi An: Airi's acquaintance. The two first meet in the The Tomorrow We Hope For event, but become more thoroughly acquainted in the Wishing to the Blue Sky for Your Happiness! event when they pose in group wedding photos with Shizuku and Kohane.\n\nOtori Emu: Emu and Airi met for the first time in the Secret ♡ Operation Valentine's Day event. The two worked together with Saki to make Valentines treats for their respective groups.\n\nAsahina Mafuyu: A schoolmate whom Airi gets to know through Shizuku.\n\nShinonome Ena: Airi's best friend. They first started talking when Ena stood up for her in middle school, as people were making fun of her appearance in a variety show. Airi describes her as having an \"eye for fashion\", and Ena helped her to appear more fashionable before she became famous as an idol. They also own matching things, such as the yellow cat cushions.\n\nAiri feels the need to repay Ena because she feels as if she didn't do anything to help her back in middle school. It was because of this that she secretly enlisted the help of Akito in looking after Ena.[12] Airi also admires Ena for her perseverance, seeing it as her best quality.\n\nAkiyama Mizuki: Airi and Mizuki became friends during the What's On Your Mind? Exciting Picnic! event. While participating in one of the events in the highlands, Airi voices out her gratitude for Mizuki becoming friends with Ena, and encourages them to talk to Ena whenever something is bothering them.[13]\n\nHatsune Miku: VIRTUAL SINGER and fellow idol.\n\nKagamine Rin: VIRTUAL SINGER and fellow idol.\n\nMegurine Luka: VIRTUAL SINGER and fellow idol.\n\nMEIKO: VIRTUAL SINGER and fellow idol.\n\nKagamine Len: VIRTUAL SINGER and fellow idol.\n\nKAITO: VIRTUAL SINGER, fellow idol, and manager.\n\nKizuna Rank\n\nCharacter Rank 5 Rank 26 Rank 46 Pigtail Duo (ツインテールなふたり) Hearts Give Idols Life (アイドルはハートが命) Seal it With a Wink (ウィンクで決め！) Rays of Sunshine (元気印) Powerful Idols (パワフルアイドル) Looking Ahead (前を向いて) Messenger Of Feelings (想いのメッセンジャー) Is MCing Your Specialty?
