        "text": "Strings of loudspeakers\n\nA string of loudspeakers is generally defined as a group of emitters or speakers that follow a daisy chain topology. In Qt Pro systems this would typically be referring to runs of active or passive emitters that we tied to a controller via a home run for each output. In a Dynasound system, a string of loudspeakers would be referring to a distributed high-impedance group of speakers using 70/100V. The Qt X platform brings both these methods of daisy chaining loudspeakers into one platform. The below examples define the types of loudspeaker strings that would be used with each controller type.\n\nQt X 300/600 and 300/600D controllers support EAW passive and EPW active direct field emitter strings. These follow the per-string limits as shown below and are appropriate for open structures, ACT ceiling tile, hard lid, perforated metal/slat, or cloud ceiling types.\n\nEAW Passive: Supports masking only\n\nEPW Active: Supports Masking, Background Music, Paging\n\nBoth the Qt Standard and Qt Active Emitters may be used on the same sound masking project with signals supplied by a single Qt X Controller if they are assigned to different outputs.\n\nStrings of loudspeakers are set up in Qt X software by creating the required zones for the project and adding emitters to represent each speaker run. Outputs of each controller can then be associated with a zone by connection to the added emitters in the zone.\n\nIn the example below, a Qt X300 controller is set up with two zones. Zone 1 is a masking-only zone that includes outputs 1 and 2 on the controller connected to passive emitters using both A and B connections. Zone 2 supports masking along with paging and is connected to active emitters using both A and B run connections.\n\nThis allows for no background or paging to be routed to the zones that do not support that type of signal. Zone 2 can have logic assigned to enable push-to-talk paging to reach Zone 2. Masking music and paging level can then be controlled from the software, web UI, or front panel for each created zone.\n\nQt X805/805D controllers support strings of loudspeakers via line-level outputs feeding a de-rated 70/100V amplifier. These line-level outputs mirror the 8 amplified outputs on the controller and may be used at the same time as their corresponding amplified output. It is important to note that these cannot be broken away from the amplified outputs and follow the corresponding powered output. Speakers are recommended to be tapped at 1w each in this configuration.\n\nCompatible loudspeaker types for this topology include DS1339 Indirect, DS1390 Indirect, KUBO 3T Direct (Surface Mounted).\n\nIndividually controllable loudspeaker types\n\nIndividually controlled loudspeakers can be defined as a speaker per output type topology. This allows for multiple speaker types to be connected to a common Qt X controller and zoned as required while still allowing for a unique masking spectrum to be tuned per output. This allows for architectural flexibility when planning for masking coverage in an area.\n\nSupported ceiling types are open structure, ACT ceiling tile, hard lid, and perforated metal/slat.\n\nThis topology is supported via the Qt X800/800D and the Qt X805/805D controllers. This allows for the masking controller to be located in the space while supporting 8 loudspeakers per controller mixing direct and indirect field emitters or speaker types. This follows a similar topology as previously accomplished using the Dynasound DS8000 controller.\n\nEach zone has a common master level for masking, music and paging sources in addition to level and equalization on a per output basis. Each output can be changed to support 4Ω, 8Ω, or DS1320 masking speakers."
