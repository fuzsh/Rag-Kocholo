Special cameras collect remotely sensed images, which help researchers \"sense\" things about the Earth. Some examples are:Cameras on satellites and airplanes take images of large areas on the Earth's surface, allowing us to see much more than we can see when standing on the ground.Sonar systems on ships can be used to create images of the ocean floor without needing to travel to the bottom of the ocean.Cameras on satellites can be used to make images of temperature changes in the oceans.Some specific uses of remotely sensed images of the Earth include:Large forest fires can be mapped from space, allowing rangers to ...",
