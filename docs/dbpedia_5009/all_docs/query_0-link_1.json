        "text": "To open a project, open the project file for the project: CMakeLists.txt (CMake), .pro (qmake), .qbs (Qbs), meson.build (Meson), pyproject (Python), or Makefile.am (Autotools, experimental).\n\nYou can open a project in the following ways:\n\nSelect File > Open File or Project.\n\nIn the Welcome mode, Projects tab, select Open Project (1).\n\nIn the Projects tab, select a project in the list of recently opened projects (2).\n\nIn the Projects view, right-click to open a context menu and select Load Project to open the Load Project dialog, where you can select a project file.\n\nUse the following keyboard shortcuts, depending on the mode you are currently in:\n\nIn all modes, press Ctrl+O (Cmd+O on macOS) to open the Open File dialog, where you can select a project file.\n\nOn Windows and Linux, in all modes except the Help mode, press Ctrl+Shift+O to open the Load Project dialog.\n\nIn the Welcome mode, Projects tab, press Ctrl+Shift+number (Cmd+Shift+number on macOS), where the number is the number of a project in the list of recently opened projects (3).\n\nOpen directories as projects\n\nTo open a directory as a project, go to File > Open Workspace.\n\nQt Creator generates the .qtcreator/project.json project file in the directory for setting a project name and file exclusion filters. You can open either the JSON file or the workspace to open the project the next time.\n\nRe-configure projects\n\nQt Creator stores information that it needs to build projects in a .user file. If Qt Creator cannot find the file when you open an existing project, it prompts you to enter the information.\n\nIf you used another Qt Creator instance to create the project, Qt Creator asks whether you want to use the old settings. The settings are specific to the development environment, and you should not copy them from one environment to another. Therefore, we recommend that you select No and enter the information again in the Configure Project tab.\n\nTo re-configure projects:\n\nIn Configure Project, select kits for building and running your project.\n\nSelect Configure Project.\n\nConfigure Project shows a list of kits that you install on the computer and configure in Preferences > Kits.\n\nEven if you do not intend to build the project, the C++ and QML code models need a Qt version and compiler to offer code completion. To specify them, select the Preferences link, or select Preferences > Kits.\n\nQt for Python projects rely on the language server client for code completion, highlighting, and other useful features.\n\nIf Qt Creator cannot find an existing build for a particular kit, it starts out from a clean slate and creates new debug and release build configurations in the specified directory. Qt Creator suggests a name and location for the directory that you can change.\n\nImport builds\n\nIf you have built the project before, Qt Creator can use the existing build configuration to make the exact same build available to you. To import a build, specify a directory in the Import Build From section of the Configure Project tab and select Import.\n\nYou can edit the build configuration later. For more information, see Edit build configurations.\n\nShow progress information\n\nQt Creator parses all the source files in the project and performs a semantic analysis to build up the information that it needs for functions such as navigation and finding usages. A progress bar is displayed during parsing.\n\nTo show or hide detailed progress information, select Toggle Progress Details (1)."
