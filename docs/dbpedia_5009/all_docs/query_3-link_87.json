Dr. Shannon Miller did an excellent job listening to me and being fair in her evaluation. Highly recommend!\n\nSan Diego, CA,\n\n★★★★★ Examinee Rating\n\nJust had my C&P exams and was very pleasantly surprised. Everyone I spoke with was very professional and took the time to understand my medical conditions. Be sure to fill out the provided questionnaire completely and include some detail. The doctor really does read the information you provide and it will help your exam go much more efficiently. I was very impressed by everyone I interacted with at QTC.\n\nAlexandria, VA,\n\n★★★★★ Examinee Rating\n\nAbsolutely love this place! Fast, efficient, and I can tell they truly care about veterans in Orange County, CA. It has been a pleasure working with your staff and I look forward to our future interactions.\n\nSanta Ana, CA,\n\n★★★★★ Examinee Rating"
