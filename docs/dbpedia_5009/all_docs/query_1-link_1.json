Qt produces highly readable, easily maintainable and reusable code with high runtime performance and small footprint â€“ and it's cross-platform.\n\nTry Qt for Free Buy Qt\n\nMaking true cross-platform possible\n\nQt Essentials define the foundation of Qt on all platforms. They are available on all supported development platforms and on the tested target platforms.\n\nBrowse all Qt Essentials\n\nThe right add-ons\n\nfor the right task\n\nThese special-purpose modules may only be available on some development platform. Many add-on modules are either feature-complete and exist for backward compatibility or are only applicable to certain platforms.\n\nBrowse all Qt Add-Ons\n\nQt Framework Practices for Handling of Security Concerns\n\nThe Qt Group prioritizes addressing potential vulnerability threats and security concerns in its products. With its broad cross-platform applicability and extensive API, the Qt framework is susceptible to cyber risks on diverse fronts. Furthermore, Qt is developed as a open source project, requiring vulnerability report analysis by designated staff members and external contributors. Since its inception, the Qt Group actively participates in the relevant steering groups and takes prompt action upon vulnerability reports. Vulnerability reports are governed by specific procedures outlined in the Qt Project Security Policy.\n\nQt Project Security Policy"
