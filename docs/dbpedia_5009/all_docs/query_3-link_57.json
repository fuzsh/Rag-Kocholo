Whether you're building GUI prototypes or fully-fledged cross-platform GUI applications with a native look and feel, Mastering Qt 5 is your fastest, easiest, and most powerful solution. This book addresses various challenges and teaches you to successfully develop cross-platform applications using the Qt framework, with the help of well-organized projects.\nWorking through this book, you will gain a better understanding of the Qt framework, as well as the tools required to resolve serious issues, such as linking, debugging, and multithreading. You'll start off your journey by discovering the new Qt 5.11 features, soon followed by exploring different platforms and learning to tame them. In addition to this, you'll interact with a gamepad using Qt Gamepad. Each chapter is a logical step for you to complete in order to master Qt.\nBy the end of this book, you'll have created an application that has been tested and is ready to be shipped.",

If you switch between Edit mode and Design mode for the MainWindow.ui file, you will see the real XML content and the designer:\n\nThe designer displays several parts:\n\nForm Editor (1): A visual representation of the form (empty for now)\n\nWidget Box (2): Contains all the major widgets that can be used with your form\n\nObject Inspector (3): Displays your form as a hierarchical tree\n\nProperty Editor (4): Enumerates the properties of the selected widget\n\nAction Editor/Signal & Slots Editor (5): Handles toolbar actions and connections between your objects\n\nIt's time to embellish this empty window! Let's drag and drop a Label widget from the Display Widgets section on the form. You can change the name and the text properties directly from the Properties editor.\n\nAs we are making a todo application, we suggest these properties:\n\nobjectName: statusLabel\n\ntext: Status: 0 todo / 0 done\n\nThis label will later display the count of todo tasks and the count of tasks already done. Save, build, and start your application. You should now see your new label in the window.\n\nYou can now add a push button with those properties:\n\nobjectName: addTaskButton\n\ntext: Add task\n\nYou should get a result close to the following:\n\nYou can edit the text property of a widget directly on your form by double-clicking on it!"
