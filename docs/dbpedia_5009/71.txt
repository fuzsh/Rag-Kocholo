A match made in heaven, obviously.

Numbers producer SOPHIE and PC Music boss A.G. Cook have joined forces on a new project under the banner QT, and it already sounds like genius squared – check out the 21-second sample below. With vocals that sound distinctly Hannah Diamond-esque (or at least in that helium-enhanced vein), ‘Hey QT’ is a super-kawaii pop sparkler in the vein of SOPHIE’s ‘Bipp’ or A.G. Cook’s ‘Keri Baby’.

They’ve also launched the project with a mini-site showing a revolving can of QT energy drink designed in PC Music’s typically glossy, digital kitsch style.

There’s no information on a release date, but a recent tweet from Diplo suggests that he’s had a hand in the project – perhaps a remix? – with record label XL. QT is scheduled to appear at Boiler Room LA along with Hudson Mohawke, Oneohtrix Point Never, Lunice and SOPHIE this Friday.
