        "text": "Category Archives: Film\n\nThe Netflix mini-series, “The Haunting of Bly Manor,” is pretty darn spooky for a few reasons. It’s also a perfect show to watch during this Covid-19 Halloween season when much of our activities are going to be indoors more than ever. This isn’t a review of the show. There are plenty of actual reviews […]\n\nWith the Halloween season right around the corner, with the date of this post being Sept. 2, to quote Dan Aykroyd in 1982’s “Twilight Zone: The Movie,” do you want to see something really scary?

A disclaimer; this isn’t a movie review but as the title says, a “stream of consciousness.” Aside from any personal opinion of the movie, “A Ghost Story” isn’t scary, but it is spooky in its own way. And that’s why we are talking about […]\n\nOk, let’s get to it, as today is Halloween.

TIME-TRAVEL Time travel. It’s such a romanticized and spooky concept. Haven’t each and every one of us dreamed about what we could do with the opportunity to […]\n\nOne of our Spooky Things signature posts of the past is titled “Old World Origins of The Spooky Holiday Trifecta, Oct. 31 – Nov. 2.” If you haven’t read it, we promise you’ll enjoy the post. If you have, you’ll probably appreciate the reminder. However, if we were going to write a post called “New […]\n\nGood eeeeeeeevening, daaaaarrrrrrrrrlink creatures, dooooooo come innnnnn! Tonight’s spooky installment of Music For The Grim(m) Season comes to you courtesy of ol’ Satchmo himself, Louis Armstrong, who has been known to sing a creepy Christmas song or two in his time. Alas, but the great Louie is dead, having departed waaaaaay back in 1971. This […]\n\nSure, it’s autumn – the signs of the impending spooky season are all around. One of the very good haunted attractions around where Michael lives is the Halloween Harvest Festival held at Pierce College in Woodland Hills, CA. The organizers were already growing their corn back in the summer months and hiring staff and actors […]\n\nI recently saw the movie Lincoln. For those who have seen it, and those who haven’t, Daniel Day-Lewis was downright eerie as President Abraham Lincoln. So were some of the shots, especially the first time we see Lincoln – in the dark, in the rain. The way Steven Spielberg shot the film really transported you […]"
