        "text": "Nickelodeon’s reboot of ‘ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK’ Is back for another season premiering on Saturday, July 30!\n\nThe new season will be the third as part of the reboot series, which kicked off in 2019.\n\nProduced by ACE Entertainment, the limited series “Are You Afraid of the Dark? Ghost Island” will debut with a two-hour episode on Saturday, July 30, at 7 p.m. (ET/PT) on Nickelodeon, with the remaining episodes airing Saturday, Aug. 6, and Aug. 13, at 7 p.m. (ET/PT).\n\nThe season “follows an all-new Midnight Society as they go on what they thought would be a fun summer vacation on a resort island, until they learn about something sinister haunting the guests. In the just-released teaser, viewers are introduced to the new members of the Midnight Society and get a glimpse at the horrors that await them on their vacation.”\n\nIn the premiere episode, “The Tale of Room 13/The Tale of the Teen Spirit,” four best friends get more than they bargained for and encounter genuine terror locked away in one of the rooms after checking into a hotel on a resort island. Then, as the kids try to enjoy summer vacation, they are pulled back into the mystery of the island’s ghosts, ultimately leading them to a terrifying and shocking revelation.\n\nThe new members of the Midnight Society are: Kayla, played by Telci Huynh (Modern Love, Drama Club); Max, played by Conor Sherry (The Terminal List, The Devil You Know); Leo, played by Luca Padovan (You, School of Rock the Musical on Broadway); Summer, played by Dior Goodjohn (Head of the Class); and Ferris, played by Chance Hurstfield (A Million Little Things, Good Boys). Julian Curtis (Wish Man) also stars as Stanley Crane, the hotel manager at the island resort."
