Taking refuge in an old mansion, they witness statues moving, leaving behind luminous footprints and handprints! Following the clues, the kids eventually emerge from the \"haunted\" house and discover the truth. The \"ghosts\" are really the owner, coach, and trainer of an opposing basketball team, who are trying to keep the Globetrotters from sleeping so they will be too tired to win the big game the following day!"
