        "text": "The monsters are supposed to come with unmasked heads.\n\nI'm excited for it. The full gang is a pickup for me, and I'll pick and choose from the monsters. The creeper up there looks great.\n\nI'm hoping it goes long enough we can get characters like Scooby Dumb too. And if it opens the door to a full Hannah Barbara line I'd be ecstatic.\n\nI'll buy this whole line. Been waiting on quality Scooby Doo figures for a long time. Wonder if this will lead into any other Hanna-Barbara properties being made into toys?\n\nThe unmasked heads are confirmed? Sweet. I've been struggling to find information on these guys for whatever reason.\n\nThere's such a huge roster of monsters that it's going to be difficult to keep them all and that's not even getting into alternative looks for the gang, so if the line lifts off then I'm definitely going to have to face the music that I won't be able to get all the monsters.\n\nDefinitely hoping for supporting characters and monsters from later shows and movies. Scrappy, Velma's younger sister, the werecats, Ben Ravencroft, etc.\n\nIt would be crazy if Jada somehow had the rights to do figures from The New Scooby Doo Movies (1972-1973).\n\nSpecial guest stars\n\nDon Adams – Himself (in \"The Exterminator\")\n\nEddie \"Rochester\" Anderson - Bobby Joe Mason (in \"The Ghostly Creep from the Deep\", \"The Loch Ness Mess\", and \"The Mystery of Haunted Island\")\n\nJohn Astin – Gomez Addams (in \"Wednesday Is Missing\")\n\nJoe Besser – Babu (in \"Mystery in Persia\")\n\nDaws Butler – Larry and Curly Joe (in \"Ghastly Ghost Town\" and \"The Ghost of the Red Baron\")\n\nTed Cassidy – Lurch (in \"Wednesday Is Missing\")\n\nSonny & Cher – Themselves (in \"The Secret of Shark Island\")\n\nTim Conway – Himself (in \"The Spirit Spooked Sports Show\"), Mr. Griffith (in \"The Spirit Spooked Sports Show\"), Mr. Griffith's Twin Brother (in \"The Spirit Spooked Sports Show\")\n\nJackie Coogan – Uncle Fester (in \"Wednesday Is Missing\")\n\nScatman Crothers - Meadowlark Lemon (in \"The Ghostly Creep from the Deep\", \"The Loch Ness Mess\", and \"The Mystery of Haunted Island\")\n\nPhyllis Diller – Herself (in \"A Good Medium Is Rare\")\n\nRobert DoQui - Pablo Robertson (in \"The Ghostly Creep from the Deep\", \"The Loch Ness Mess\", and \"The Mystery of Haunted Island\")\n\nSandy Duncan – Herself (in \"Sandy Duncan's Jekyll and Hyde\")\n\nDick Van Dyke – Himself (in \"The Haunted Carnival\")\n\nCass Elliot – Herself (in \"The Haunted Candy Factory\")\n\nRichard Elkins - J.C. \"Gip\" Gipson (in \"The Ghostly Creep from the Deep\", \"The Loch Ness Mess\", and \"The Mystery of Haunted Island\")\n\nJodie Foster – Pugsley Addams (in \"Wednesday Is Missing\")\n\nStu Gilliam - Curly Neal (in \"The Ghostly Creep from the Deep\", \"The Loch Ness Mess\", and \"The Mystery of Haunted Island\")\n\nLarry Harmon – Stan Laurel (in \"The Ghost of Bigfoot\"), Ghost of Bigfoot (in \"The Ghost of Bigfoot\")\n\nPat Harrington – Moe (in \"Ghastly Ghost Town\" and \"The Ghost of the Red Baron\")\n\nCindy Henderson – Wednesday Addams (in \"Wednesday Is Missing\")\n\nDon Knotts – Himself (in \"Guess Who's Knott Coming to Dinner?\" and \"The Spooky Fog of Juneberry\")\n\nCarolyn Jones – Morticia Addams (in \"Wednesday Is Missing\")\n\nDavy Jones – Himself (in \"The Haunted Horseman of Hagglethorn Hall\")\n\nJim MacGeorge - Oliver Hardy (in \"The Ghost of Bigfoot\")\n\nJulie McWhirter - Jeannie\n\nJerry Reed – Himself (in \"The Phantom of the Country Music Hall\")\n\nOlan Soule – Batman (in \"The Dynamic Scooby-Doo Affair\" and \"The Caped Crusader Caper\")\n\nJanet Waldo – Granny Frump (in \"Wednesday Is Missing\"), Female Housekeeper (in \"Wednesday Is Missing\"), Josie (in \"The Haunted Showboat\")\n\nJohnny Williams - Geese Ausby (in \"The Ghostly Creep from the Deep\", \"The Loch Ness Mess\", and \"The Mystery of Haunted Island\")\n\nJonathan Winters – Himself (in \"The Frickert Fracas\"), Maude Frickert (in \"The Frickert Fracas\")\n\nMaybe Jada needs its own thread for non-Street Fighter figures? Tony the Tiger, etc. should probably go here Jada Toys Cereal And Snack Mascots Figures but they're quickly branching into all sorts of other goodness.\n\nI'm just waiting for a 1/12 Scooby that can join Mutt & Junkyard in the hunt for Cobra agents.\n\nFor those... Besides the Addams Family, I would do Sonny and Cher, Tim Conway, Phyllis Diller, Dick van Dyke, Don Knotts, and Jonathan Winters. Wonder how hard that would be since these are cartoon appearances, but many are based off real people?"
