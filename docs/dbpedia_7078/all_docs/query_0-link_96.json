        "text": "Setting sail in late 2025 from Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, the ‘Heroes and Villains’-inspired Disney Destiny ship will offer an assortment of spaces and experiences inspired by some of Disney’s most legendary schemers, scoundrels and specters—and a fearsome crew of Disney villains—at sea.\n\nA diverse range of Disney, Pixar and Marvel characters will be the inspiration behind themed venues and entertainment aboard the ship, including brand-new lounges celebrating Cruella de Vil and the Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\n“The Disney Destiny is all about celebrating the bold, charismatic and driven characters at the heart of our favorite stories,” said Sharon Siskie, Senior VP and general manager, Disney Cruise Line, said in a press release statement. “And who are our beloved heroes without the antagonists who challenge them to prevail? We want our guests to have fun with the unique theme of this ship, and we are having a blast creating spaces and entertainment experiences that pay tribute to the villains, anti-heroes and mischief makers who have captivated Disney film and theme park audiences for generations.”\n\nIncluded in the array of spaces is deVilish Delights, De Vil’s adult-exclusive piano lounge with a Hollywood Regency-inspired aesthetic where everything will be adorned in her signature color palette of red, black and white. On the menu are trendy martinis, chic cocktails and glamorous wines and bubblies. One side of De Vil’s will be open to the Grand Hall, allowing guests to sit back with a drink and a prime view of the ship’s main gathering space.\n\nThe Cask and Cannon pub, meanwhile, will put the focus on rum, of course, and offer an eclectic yet cozy vibe furnished with pirate “treasures.” Here, passengers can catch live televised sporting events, and indulge in an extensive menu of rare, specialty and vintage rums as well as a selection of “bootlegged” brews developed specially for the venue and served straight from the barrel in true pirate style.\n\nThe Disney Destiny will introduce a new storyline filled with Disney Animation villains to the cruise line’s signature attraction, AquaMouse, a 760-ft.-long water ride towering over the upper decks of the ship. It will feature an original soundtrack written exclusively for Disney Cruise Line by Emmy award-winning composer Christopher Willis and lyricist Elyse Willis. In “Sing a Silly Song,” Mickey and Minnie will lead guests on a seemingly ominous trek to the peak of Villain Mountain. When faced with some of the most fearsome villains of Disney Animation lore, the duo will employ a silly song—and a bit of pixie dust—to transform each chilling encounter into a wacky surprise. “Sing a Silly Song” will be one of four shows available on AquaMouse aboard the Disney Destiny, all complete with music, lighting, special effects and surprises.\n\nWhile on board the Disney Destiny, guests will encounter formidable foes—including Maleficent, Hades, Cruella de Vil, Captain Hook, Mr. Smee and Oogie Boogie—through a variety of shows, meet-and-greets and special appearances throughout the ship. The Disney Destiny will also introduce exclusive ways for guests to interact with their favorite villains, rogues and mischief makers during all-new events and activities. This will complement a host of popular programs from across the Disney Cruise Line fleet, including a frighteningly fun dance party in Oogie Boogie’s shipboard lair and an interactive Disney trivia event that often gets interrupted by a cast of Disney villains.\n\nAdditionally, Disney Destiny will also be home to the Haunted Mansion Parlor—which will first debut aboard the Disney Treasure in December 2024. The venue follows the nostalgic art style of the 1969 Disney Parks classic and will feature a selection of ghostly cocktails that capture the spirit of the story. Characters from Haunted Mansion attractions around the world will come out to socialize throughout the experience, along with a few new seafaring arrivals and an original storyline focused on a ship captain.\n\nOnboard Eats\n\nThe iconic songs and legendary moments of “The Lion King” will come to life at Pride Lands: Feast of The Lion King, a first-of-its-kind dining experience set in a savanna-inspired venue. Here, depictions of animals and nature will come to life through lighting and special effects, while the window-lined back wall will transform from stunning sunrises to enchanting sunsets throughout the meal.\n\nAs families dine, an ensemble of live musicians and storytellers will take the stage in the center of the restaurant—complete with tiered risers that evoke African drums—as they present a musical journey, including productions of “Circle of Life” and “Hakuna Matata,” plus a mash-up of “I Just Can’t Wait to Be King” and “Be Prepared,” a fun take that highlights the hero-villain dynamic of the story.\n\nEdna Mode’s lab, where the famed fashion designer from Pixar Animation Studios’ “The Incredibles” films whips up outfits for the world’s most famous Supers, will be transformed into a one-of-a-kind confectionary at the brand-new aboard the Disney Destiny. Here, passengers will find a selection of handmade gelato, ice cream, cookies, candies and specialty treats.\n\nJust off the Grand Hall, two casual walk-up cafes will serve a selection of coffee, tea, specialty beverages and snacks: Cafe Megara and Cafe Merida.\n\nDisney Destiny Debuts Hero-themed Suites\n\nEach stateroom will showcase custom artwork depicting the epic journeys of famous Disney legends, with most featuring Disney Cruise Line’s signature split-bath concept, and many offering the option of a connecting door that adjoins staterooms to accommodate larger groups. Concierge staterooms and suites will draw on of Disney Animation’s “Fantasia,” while seven special oceanview rooms located directly above the bridge will be adorned in the distinctive iconography of Pixar’s “The Incredibles.” The Hero Suites will pay homage to Disney Animation’s “Hercules,” featuring Greco-Roman architecture, colors and patterns, while the IncrediSuites will invoke the exploits of “The Incredibles” through a streamlined mid-century modern aesthetic inspired by the Pixar films."
