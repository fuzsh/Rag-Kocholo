        "text": "My second Switch is on its way and I think I'm going to hop on the 'Haunted Island' bandwagon.\n\nI really want my villagers to match the theme and have a general list of who would fit the theme pretty well.\n\nMy problem is it's hard for me to even look at villagers I think are 'ugly'.\n\nI'd appreciate if ya'll could give me your thoughts! Feel free to list other villagers not on this list if you think they might fit in!\n\nI want at LEAST one of each personality. Meaning I can get only two villagers with a duplicate personality.\n\nUPDATE: I've gotten a lot of good ideas, thank you! I've edited the front post because I'm having a hard time deciding now!\n\nIf you have a preference of the villagers listed, please lmk!\n\nMUST-HAVES (Villagers that will get a spot no matter what):\n\n4/10\n\nLazy: Lucky, Raddle\n\nNormal: Coco\n\nSisterly: Muffy\n\nJock:\n\nSnooty:\n\nCranky:\n\nSmug:\n\nPeppy:\n\nPOSSIBLE OTHERS?:\n\nLazy: Clay, Rodeo\n\nNormal:\n\nSisterly: Agnes\n\nJock: Genji, Peck\n\nSnooty: Ankha, Greta\n\nCranky: Rasher, Roscoe, Kabuki, Spike\n\nSmug: Ken\n\nPeppy: Ruby\n\n@SirBadger Yes, I agree! Lucky is def on my list. I don't think anyone would disagree with Lucky xD Thank you for the suggestion!\n\n@Dormire Most definitely! They were the first to spring to my mind as well xD I think they definitely have a spot on any haunted island. Thank you for the suggestion!\n\n@Nerakil Ya know, I was thinking Pietro. Especially because I HATE clowns, but he seems too 'happy'. Maybe once the island is made and the scenery is set, he might fit in more? I'm honestly still debating on him though because he might make a really good one. Thank you for the suggestion!\n\n@moomintroll Omg I never thought to put a goat in due to occult symbolism! Kidd actually looks pretty cool! I might use him. Thank you!\n\nI did actually look at some of the exterior houses, but even some of the 'creepier' villagers don't have creepy houses. D: It would be cool if in the future we could adjust them. Thank you for the suggestion!\n\n@Seira Ya know I was looking at Zell for a bit, but his eyes kill me xD They look more lazy than scary. But idk maybe once I get the island aesthetic down he might fit in more. It's a bit hard to imagine some villagers when I don't have the island yet. ; A; Thank you for the suggestion!\n\n@Teddy345 Omg she does! xD I can't believe I didn't see it before, but now I can't unsee it lol. Thank you for the suggestion!\n\n@Lokidoki Pietro seems to be one that a lot of people suggest. Tbh I might go with him just because so many people dislike clowns.\n\nStitches was def one I was looking at, but I just kicked him off my current town and I kind of want to go with someone different... I might end up going with him though because I think he might fit pretty well. I've never even SEEN Peaches! But out of the three, I might lean a bit more towards Cube. Thank you for the suggestion!\n\n@xxxxnatalie Roscoe is reaaaaaally one I was considering. I always thought he looked like some sort of demon horse lol. Along with Rodeo the bull. If I don't go with Rodeo, I think I would try to find a spot for Roscoe since they look very similar."
