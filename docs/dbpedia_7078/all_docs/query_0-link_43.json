        "text": "Our Locations:\n\nThe Book Barn has three locations in the seaside town of Niantic, CT.\n\n​\n\nThe Main Barn, at 41 West Main Street, is home to our largest selection of genres spread throughout several themed buildings, as well as gardens, goats, and of course our cats.\n\n​\n\nThe Downtown store, at 269 Main Street, is in the heart of Niantic Village on the same block as the movie theater.\n\n​\n\nChapter Three, at 55 West Main Street, is a mere three hundred feet from the Main Barn.\n\n​\n\nAll three shops are within a mile of each other and can easily be visited in a single day.\n\n​\n\nThe story behind the Barn...\n\nIn April 1988, The Book Barn opened for business in what is now called “The Main Barn.” At that time, the used bookstore consisted of a mere three bookcases, 800 books, and a yard sale couch.\n\nAn unfortunate fire in the antique store above the bookstore in 1990 destroyed nearly everything. With support from family and friends, we were able to reopen for business, new and improved, in April 1991.\n\nIn 1992, The Book Barn expanded into the upstairs of the Main Barn, and it seemed hard to believe we would ever fill all that space! That Christmas, we actually had a Christmas tree on the balcony.\n\nWhen you are paying for your books, you can go to the Main Barn, where our cash register is located and where we accept all four major credit cards as well as cash and personal checks. There is another register down at the buying area, where you may pay for books using cash or a check but not credit cards.\n\nELLIS ISLAND\n\nMr. Book Barn and his cohorts buy books here seven days a week, 363 days a year.\n\nNamed after the American landmark, Ellis Island is our book immigration station, where we buy and sort new arrivals. During the summer months, we take in an estimated ten to fourteen thousand books a week.\n\n​\n\nThis is where our new arrivals are stored before being sorted. Feel free to browse the books, you never know what you may find.\n\nHADES\n\nHades is the makeshift building beneath the white awning on the way to the back of the property.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nIn Hades, you will find assorted books of every size, shape, and category. Everything just $1.00. It's not organized in any fashion...book Hades indeed.\n\nIn the free-standing bookcase near Hades are books on American politics.\n\nTHE HAUNTED\n\nThis wonderful two-story building started out as Mrs. Book Barn’s Halloween Party Spot.\n\nOne bright spring day, Mr. Book Barn approached the beautiful Mrs. Book Barn and said; “ My beautiful wife, would it be okay if I were to store some boxes of books in your Halloween Barn, just until more shelves can be built?” The charming and yes, we dare say again, beautiful Mrs. Book Barn looked lovingly at her husband and said; “Of course my tired and overworked husband, you may store your boxes there!”\n\n---Flash forward to today ---\n\nThe Haunted Book Barn is located way back behind the gardens.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether The Haunted is really Haunted. There have been a number of people who believe they felt or saw something in The Haunted. Others, however, have left The Haunted with nary a paranormal twinge, we invite you to come see for yourself."
