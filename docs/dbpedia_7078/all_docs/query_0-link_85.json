Includes index.\n\nNussbaum’s measured criticism had me reflecting on the novel’s limitations. That’s what the best critics do: they bring a new perspective to a work you may already have a firm opinion on. Nussbaum isn’t just an excellent practitioner of this; she’s one of the best within the genre and beyond. That leads me to Track Changes: Selected Reviews, Nussbaum’s first (and I hope not last) collection of criticism.\n\n–Ian Mond, Locus, August 2024\n\nO’Bryan, Abigail: Iron Rose\n\n(Quill & Flame Publishing House 9781957899725, $18.99, 380pp, formats: trade paperback, hardcover, ebook, 08/06/2024)\n\nYoung-adult fairy tale fantasy novel inspired by “Beauty and the Beast”.
