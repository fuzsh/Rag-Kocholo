        "text": "Classy old-school horror, James Wan’s “The Conjuring’’ depends more on its excellent cast and atmospheric direction than cheap gimmicks to raise hairs on the back of your neck. Which it does, quite frequently.\n\nIt’s the first in what I’d guess will be a series of films about Lorraine and Ed Warren, real-life paranormal experts most famous for investigating “The Amityville Horror’’ house on Long Island — though they were depicted neither in the 1978 film nor its woeful 2005 remake.\n\nLorraine, portrayed with unusual dignity for the genre by Oscar nominee Vera Farmiga (“Up in the Air’’), is a psychic, while husband Ed (Patrick Wilson, sporting scary sideburns) is an expert at exposing spurious spirits and demons — who also assisted exorcists in battling “genuine” ones.\n\nIt’s 1971, when half the male population of the US, including Richard Nixon and yours truly, sported scary sideburns.\n\nPart of the film’s appeal, at least to me, is the ugly fashions and its scrupulous re-creation of the now-quaint analog technology, including 8mm film, which Ed uses to record the couple’s exploits and show them to rapt college audiences.\n\nFollowing one such appearance, the Warrens are approached by Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor), who is frantic about creepy happenings at the rambling old home in the Rhode Island countryside where she and her long-haul driver husband, Roger (Ron Livingston), have recently moved with their five daughters.\n\nClocks all stop at 3:10 a.m. The family dog won’t go inside, then suddenly dies. Mom develops mysterious bruises that are spreading. A boarded-up basement yields all sorts of unpleasant surprises. And the family’s habit of playing blindfolded hide-and-seek exposes them to all sorts of peril.\n\nThings get rapidly more scary when Lorraine and Ed show up, and the spirit of the house’s original owner — a witch from Salem — takes up residence in Carolyn.\n\nMeanwhile, the youngest daughter (Joey King) starts having conversations with a child murdered on the premises in the 1920s — whom Lorraine catches a glimpse of in an old mirrored music box with a pop-up clown.\n\nThe Warrens are having their own spiritual crisis as Ed worries his line of work is taking too much of an emotional toll on Lorraine. And their own daughter starts getting terrorized by a relic from a previous case who wants to horn in on the demonic action.\n\nAll of this could have easily gotten hokey if it weren’t played totally straight, and Wan (“Insidious’’) weren’t so expert at making situations from other movies going all the way back to “The Exorcist’’ seem freshly chilling.\n\n“The Conjuring’’ builds to a corking climax as Ed is forced to take action when the Vatican doesn’t move quickly enough to approve an urgently needed exorcism. All I can say is, Father Merrin and ­Father Karras had better watch their backs."
