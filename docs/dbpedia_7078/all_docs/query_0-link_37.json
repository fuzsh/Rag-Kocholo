        "text": "Oh, we are so back. It took a few years, but 2023 felt like the year that Hollywood finally found its footing post-pandemic â€“ which is ironic, considering Hollywood also shut down for large parts of the year. Before all the strikes hit, though, there were indications that the movie industry was coming back to life. There was the #Barbenheimer phenomenon, of course, which helped power the domestic box office to its strongest overall numbers since 2019. But in terms of pure moviemaking, the year was particularly strong. Martin Scorsese dropped another masterpiece, while Across the Spider-Verse made comic-book movies fresh again (at least until Madam Web, anyway). Past Lives made audiences swoon, while small-time charmers like Theater Camp, Scrapper and Rye Lane reasserted the vitality of indie filmmaking. And donâ€™t forget the one about the dancing killer doll!\n\nOverall, it was a great year for movies â€“ even the Oscars were enjoyable. But what movies were the greatest? Here are our picks.\n\nRECOMMENDED:\n\nðŸ«¶ The best movies of 2024 (so far)\n\nðŸ“º The best TV and streaming shows of 2023ðŸŽ¥ The 100 greatest movies ever made\n\nCall it 'A Portrait of the Artist In the Midst of Being Canceledâ€™. In Todd Field's psychological character study, Cate Blanchett is Lydia TÃ¡r, a genius-level composer, EGOT winner and insufferable narcissist whose icy demeanor hardly fractures as accusations of sexual impropriety threaten to shatter her career. Blanchett's Oscar-nominated performance has rightly earned the lion's share of plaudits, but the superb acting is buoyed by Field's subtly off-kilter visual style, lending the â€˜ripped from the headlinesâ€™ narrative a hint of Kubrickian uncanniness.\n\nBuilding on the mash-up of animation styles that made Into the Spider-Verse so ridiculously vibrant and throwing in a multitude of new ones â€“ stop-motion LEGO-mation, anyone? â€“ this dizzying, dazzling sequel is the persuasive case for superhero movies than the played-out genre desperately needed. The Miles Morales version of Spidey, voiced again with a sense of wonderment and real soul by Shameik Moore, zooms across multiverses and meets several hundred parallel Spider-people in a personal quest with universal stakes. The gags and pop-culture references â€“ delivered with trademark Lord and Miller irreverence â€“ come so thick and fast, youâ€™ll need several viewings to unpack them all. Which will not be a major burden with a movie this entertaining.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAny year in which both the box office and the Academy Awards are dominated by a three-hour doomscroll through the life of the inventor of the atomic bomb should be considered a very good year for movies. Itâ€™s not just the tough subject matter that makes Christopher Nolanâ€™s all-time-great biopic such a surprising blockbuster but the enormity of the themes contained within it: war, genocide, guilt, nuclear fission, the Red Scare, the Spanish Civil War, the apocalypse, love, marriage et al. Cillian Murphy, brilliant as J Robert Oppenheimer, wears it all in every line on his face, especially the â€˜guiltâ€™ part â€“ heâ€™s the walking embodiment of the phrase â€˜your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didnâ€™t stop to think if they shouldâ€™.\n\nThanks to Banshees of Inisherin, Triangle of Sadness and this disarmingly powerful four-legged odyssey from veteran Polish director Jerzy Skolimowski, the humble donkey has become a cinematic colossus of late â€“ a kind of doleful-eyed, carrot-chewing Brando. The genius of EO, which follows one little donkey across Europe, is in using its furry hero as a mirror to reflect back at us the state of the world in all its beauty, pain and ineffable sadness. It shouldnâ€™t be half as bewitching and emotional, but honestly, it ruined us.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAre we starting to take Martin Scorsese for granted? Shut out at the Oscars, and made the butt of more hacky â€˜movies are too darn long nowâ€™ jokes, his account of the murders that plagued the oil-rich Osage Indian Reservation in Oklahoma in the 1920s is nevertheless â€˜justâ€™ another late-period masterpiece from cinemaâ€™s greatest living director, a darkly atmospheric true-crime epic informed by one of Americaâ€™s original sins. Scorseseâ€™s usual gang of A-listers, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Jesse Plemons, are all typically excellent, but the soul of the film is the previously unheralded Lily Gladstone as Mollie Kyle, an Osage woman quietly haunted by the suspicion that sheâ€™s allowed the devil into her heart, home and community.\n\nA diaspora tale of real psychological acuity and emotional eloquence, this captivating drama perfectly articulates the hurt of a young adopted Frenchwoman as she returns to the country of her birth and struggles to reconcile with the past. French-Cambodian filmmaker Davy Chou follows his brilliantly-drawn protagonist, the spiky, chaotic Freddie (Park Ji-Min), as she shrugs off Korean customs, her drunk-texting birth father and a continued sense of rejection from the mum who wonâ€™t acknowledge her in the hope of wrestling back control of her inner life. Like Freddie, itâ€™s a film that will only grow in stature with the passing of time.\n\nAdvertising\n\nFinding flaw in Justine Trietâ€™s (In Bed with Victoria) brainy, provocative and elusive Palme dâ€™Or winner is no easy task. Itâ€™s hard even to define it. Murder-mystery? Courtroom drama about an innocent woman (Toni Erdmannâ€™s Sandra HÃ¼ller) suffering from institutionalised sexism? That question sits at its murky heart. A man falls from the balcony of his Alpine chalet and suspicion falls on his writer wife. Cue a forensic examination of a rocky marriage, as well as a knotty character study of a refreshingly complicated woman. Triet teases us with morsels of information that may (or may not) be important, like an arthouse version of Cluedo. Keep your wits about you and itâ€™s one of the most satisfying cinema outings of the year.\n\nGetting compared with Wong Kar-waiâ€™s classic romance In the Mood for Love loads seriously unreasonable expectations on a first-time filmmaker. But Korean-Canadian filmmaker Celine Songâ€™s tender-hearted romance holds up to them purely for its emotional intelligence and wisdom and its sheer empathy for its characters. The central relationship plays out over several decades between Korean New Yorker (Greta Lee) and the childhood sweetheart (Teo Yoo) who never left Seoul, and the husband who struggles to give her space to explore her feelings. A love letter to two people and two cities â€“ Seoul and New York â€“ in all their messy glory, itâ€™s one weâ€™ll be revisiting in years to come.\n\nAdvertising\n\nTodd Haynesâ€™ latest melodrama â€“ the ripped-from-the-headlines story of a suburban woman, Gracie Atherton-Yoo (Julianne Moore), living in the shadow of an underage sex scandal â€“ sounds maudlin. But Haynes, working off a brilliant screenplay from Samy Burch, injects the film with enough self-conscious camp to qualify as a comedy (at the Golden Globes, anyway), even as it explores heavy themes involving sexual power dynamics and self-delusion. Itâ€™s a complex, richly character-driven story, with Charles Melton quietly stealing scenes as Gracieâ€™s now-adult partner and Natalie Portman as an oily TV actress preparing to play Gracie in an indie drama. But itâ€™s hardly snooty â€“ and the hilariously sensationalistic score is one of the yearâ€™s best running gags.\n\nThe un-retirement of Hayao Miyazaki has been one of 2023's bonuses, but the great anime auteur wasn't here for a victory lap. His latest is as vital and vibrant as any of Studio Ghibli's best movies, a trippy adventure with shades of Lewis Carroll and 'Beauty and the Beast' that sends a grieving boy down a fantastical rabbit hole in wartime Japan to find healing and peace of mind. In the process, The Boy and the Heron manages to speak with typical empathy to our own troubled times. It's the best kind of weird and wonderful escapism â€“ you will never look at parakeets the same way again â€“ and the purest kind of big-screen balm.\n\nAdvertising\n\nTom Cruiseâ€™s willingness to do literally any bastard-mad thing to entertain us finds its purest expression in the seventh instalment of the consistently excellent Mission: Impossible movies. He sprints, freefalls, races and horse-rides through a series of gawp-worthy action set pieces, occasionally while handcuffed to Hayley Atwellâ€™s terrified franchise newbie, all expertly executed by writer-director Christopher McQuarrie. And the plot? Hard to say, this being the first part of a Dead Reckoning twofer and with multiple strands yet to be tied together, but itâ€™s smart-baffling in the best M:I tradition. Kudos, too, to charisma machine Esai Morales, who somehow makes dialogue about A.I. sexy as the superbad, Gabriel. Roll on Part Two.\n\nA sunkissed hangout movie that sours and spins out of control like the worst kind of night out, Molly Manning Walkerâ€™s debut is where bubblegum fun strays into a minefield of sexual assault, trauma and heartbreak. Terrific newcomer Mia McKenna-Bruce is Tara, a high-schooler celebrating finishing her exams with a matesâ€™ holiday to Crete. On the menu? Booze, partying and saying farewell to her virginity. Enter the seemingly charming Paddy (Samuel Bottomley) and exit all the good vibes. A coming-of-age drama they should teach in schools, How to Have Sex is not a bit less cinematic for its educational message.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThereâ€™s so much going on in Laura Poitrasâ€™s doc, it speaks volumes for the quality of the filmmaking that it all hangs together so dexterously. Iconic photographer Nan Goldin is its subject, protagonist and guide, as the film takes in a tour of New Yorkâ€™s â€™70s counterculture, ex-addict Goldinâ€™s quest for justice against the odious Sacklers, the family behind Americaâ€™s OxyContin epidemic, and the nuts and bolts of social activism. Itâ€™s moving, enthralling and artful â€“ in every sense of the word.\n\n14. Rye Lane\n\nWho said the romcom was dead? Putting an authentically South London spin to the Before Sunset formula of two strangers meeting, chatting and slowly falling for each other â€“ ie with loads more chicken shops and Supermalts â€“ Rye Lane is sparky, romantic and pisstakey in all the ways that London is. David Jonsson and Vivian Oparah provide charm, jokes and very relatable insecurities as two young Black Londoners, Dom and Yas â€“ who slowly size each other up and â€“ eventually â€“ like what they see. Their Salt-N-Pepa karaoke scene is a mic drop moment in every sense.\n\nAdvertising\n\nPossibly the angriest Godzilla weâ€™ve seen, this Toho reboot of the Japanese icon represents a triumphant homecoming for the kaiju after a series of murky and mediocre Hollywood blockbusters. Under the skilful oversight of VFX wizard Takashi Yamazaki, who writes and directs, the action beats are thunderous and the effects look great â€“ and are always in the service of a surprisingly touching human story nestled amid the colossal destruction. One seaborne chase borrows from Jaws and isnâ€™t embarrassed by the comparison.\n\n16. Fremont\n\nPlayed by real-life Afghan refugee Anaita Wali Zada, Donya is an interpreter forced to flee the Taliban and start afresh in America in this soulful, black-and-white study of loneliness and connection. With British-Iranian director Babak Jalaliâ€™s meticulous compositions and a faint, slackerish energy best embodied by Gregg Turkingtonâ€™s drowsy, Jack London-loving psychologist who helps Donya tackle her undiagnosed PTSD, Fremont is not flattered by the Jim Jarmusch comparisons. Itâ€™s the kind of lo-fi gem that would have built a steady rep in the old days of video stores. It deserves to be discovered on streaming.\n\nAdvertising\n\nIt got lost amid Julyâ€™s Barbenheimer noise but this raucously entertaining, needle-sharp Blaxsploitation riff is ripe for discovery on Netflix. An almost uncategorisable mix of crime thriller, satirical comedy and near-future sci-fi, itâ€™s the handiwork of a first-time filmmaker of real promise in Juel Taylor. He rescues the term â€˜wokeâ€™ from the right-wing commentariat with a They Live-adjacent storyline in which John Boyega, Teyonah Parris and Jamie Foxx team up to uncover a conspiracy to control Black consciousness viaâ€¦ well, that would be spoiling one of the yearâ€™s best in-jokes.\n\nItâ€™s been an era of filmmakers recreating their childhoods on screen (and letâ€™s face it, itâ€™s mostly boyhoods weâ€™re talking about), with Alfonso CuarÃ³n, Paolo Sorrentino and Lee Isaac Chung all parlaying their own younger lives into Oscar-worthy dramas in recent years. But of all of these cine-reminiscences, Steven Spielbergâ€™s feels the most alive to the possibility that it might even be misremembering or misinterpreting events â€“ and thus it feels like the most guileless and honest of the lot. With Spielbergâ€™s on-screen surrogate, Gabriel LaBelleâ€™s Sammy Fabelman, to the fore, its many moments of hurt and wonderment are dazzlingly realised.\n\nAdvertising\n\nEuphoriaâ€™s Sydney Sweeney is electrifying as 25-year-old NSA translator Reality Winner, who was questioned by the FBI in 2017 over leaked documents relating to Russiaâ€™s alleged interference in the 2016 election. Tina Satterâ€™s anxiety-inducing thriller expertly transfers her â€˜verbatim theatreâ€™ stage production â€˜Is This a Room?â€™ into a kind of verbatim cinema, drip-feeding dread in a real-time recreation of Winnerâ€™s first interrogation. Itâ€™s signals the arrival of a singular talent in Satter, and offers further evidence of Sweeneyâ€™s brilliance. Oh, and that double meaning title? Chefâ€™s kiss.\n\n20. Theater Camp\n\nBorrowing equally from the mockumentaries of Christopher Guest and modern single-camera sitcoms like Parks and Recreation, this spirited little comedy is pretty far from being something youâ€™ve never seen before. But writer-directors Molly Gordon and Nick Lieberman have clearly studied those influences closely, and they obviously know the small-stakes art world they spend the movie affectionately mocking on an intimate level. Following the attendees of a theater-focused summer camp in the Adirondacks as they plot a last-minute tribute to their ailing founder (Amy Sedaris, whoâ€™s sadly not around much), it mines the inherent humour of passionate people whose ambition far outstrips their resources. Needling drama kids (and drama adults) is like shooting fish that have been shoved into a high school locker, and the movie does indulge in some fairly broad cliches, but it never feels cruel, and the biggest laughs often come from just how big-hearted it is. In this vicious age, niceness can go a long way â€“ and Theater Camp is some very nice stuff.\n\nAdvertising\n\nBritish cinemaâ€™s own old oak, Ken Loach delivers a (possibly final) film as inflamed and vital as ever. Some would argue to its detriment, with the line crossed from social realism and into straight polemic in its depiction of a struggling northeast English community reacting to the arrival of a group of Syrian refugees. But Loach and his long-time screenwriter Paul Laverty arenâ€™t here to spin subtle, elliptical yarns. The Old Oak is another clarion call inspired by real-life crises that are impacting working class people and that directness is its greatest strength. And throughout, the cast of first-time actors bring unvarnished warmth to its moving moments of human connection. Who else is making films like this â€“ and who will make them when Loach finally hangs up his clapperboard?\n\nWhat unexpected joy and wisdom this stop-motion animation delivers. Expanding a 2010 short and perhaps taking a cue from Aardmanâ€™s classic Creature Comforts, it introduces us to a sparkly little mollusc called Marcel (voiced by co-creator Jenny Slate) and her gentle Nanna Connie (Isabella Rossellini), left behind when their community of shells disappears overnight. Enter documentary maker Dean (Slateâ€™s co-creator Dean Fleischer Camp) to join the quest for this missing shell utopia. Cute by never cutesy, and with a surprisingly sharp wit, itâ€™s cinematic soul food thatâ€™ll have you going back for a second helping.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe directness of French filmmaker Alice Diopâ€˜s courtroom drama â€“ a film of long, unblinking takes and zero showy camerawork â€“ shouldnâ€™t be confused with simplicity. Knotty and morally challenging, Saint Omer traverses some of the biggest cultural fault lines of modern Europe â€“ race, migration, religion â€“ in its story of a young woman (Guslagie Malanda) accused of leaving her child to drown on a Normandy beach. Itâ€™s based on a real-life court case that Diop herself attended and her recreation engages both the brain and the heart. Just try shaking it.\n\nIt was the biggest movie of 2023, and one of the yearâ€™s major pop culture events in general, but for all its world domination, Barbie ended up being one heck of a strange movie. Maybe we should have expected it â€“ after all, with Greta Gerwig writing and directing, along with her husband, Noah Baumbach, serving as co-writer, you knew it wasnâ€™t just going to be a film about, like, an inspirational fashion model. But who could have predicted the feminist fantasia we actually got? Set in a matriarchal land of living dolls, where everything is blissful and neon and perfect until the fears, insecurities and toxic masculinity of the real world encroach, itâ€™s a wickedly smart, unabashedly silly satire smuggled to the masses inside a fuschia-coloured disco ball. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as â€˜Stereotypical Barbieâ€™, practically sparkling with cheery glamour even while suddenly plagued by thoughts of death and the reality of existing as a woman. And Ryan Gosling is possibly even better as the Kenniest Ken to Ever Ken, just radiating vacant himbo energy in every scene. Itâ€™s maybe not the best movie of 2023, but itâ€™s the movie youâ€™ll most associate with the year â€“ and we donâ€™t mind it one bit.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhile not exactly an escapist night at the pictures, Sarah Polleyâ€™s tough, talky, â€˜The Crucibleâ€™-esque feminist allegory all but dares you to reach for your popcorn. Sit up and pay attention, it demands â€“ and anyone prepared to lean into its dialectics is rewarded with an elite group of actors (Jessie Buckley, Claire Foy, Rooney Mara, Frances McDormand and Ben Whishaw) debate a still-scarily-resonant case of sexual abuse in a religious commune. Faith, female rage and the meaning of forgiveness have been rarely chewed over with quite this simmering power.\n\nCharacters donâ€™t have to be likeable or good to be great. Love is Strange director Ira Sachs gets it, delivering a so bad heâ€™s grand antagonist for the ages in self-centred Tomas. Portrayed by mercurially intriguing German actor Franz Rogowâ€‹ski (Great Freedom), heâ€™s a Paris-based filmmaker and hot mess whoâ€™ll crack it at an actor for not walking down the stairs artfully enough. Thinking nothing of taking a lover â€“ Blue is the Warmest Colour star AdÃ¨le Exarchopoulos â€“ while leaving hubby at home (Ben Whishaw), he ping-pongs between them, causing maximum damage to all three. But you can still see why they would. Beautifully written, framed and performed, itâ€™s a thoroughly French, knotty affair.\n\nAdvertising\n\nPromising Young Woman director Emerald Fennell drips arsenic into the champers of the English upper classes in a seductive, subversive and playful thriller set in the aughties of iPod Nanos, Livestrong wristbands and Abercrombie jeans. Fennellâ€™s witty screenplay infiltrates Barry Keoghanâ€™s Liverpudlian undergraduate Oliver Quick into the lives of the privileged Catton family â€“ and their outlandishly vast country pile â€“ and awards no prizes for guessing that this class-bridging summer fling is going to end badly for all concerned. Donâ€™t expect a tightly-plotted procedural, but as a black comedy in the great tradition of Ealing with plenty of gasp-out-loud moments, itâ€™s quite the big-screen experience.\n\nâ€˜Itâ€™s a mining area so youâ€™ll have to be okay with a little male attention.â€™ As understatements go, the parting words of the recruiter who sets up American backpackers Hanna (Ozarkâ€™s Julia Garner) and Liv (Glass Onionâ€™s Jessica Henwick) with a job pulling pints in a remote Aussie pub is a doozy. Director Kitty Green made the excellent post-Weinstein thriller The Assistant, also with Garner facing down some despicable bastards, and here she puts a feminist lens on a beery, blue-collar kind of male toxicity. Like the Outback tinnie-sploitation classic Wake in Fright, The Royal Hotel is a brilliantly nightmarish night at the boozer.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThereâ€™s something haunting and ancient in the soil of Britain and itâ€™s captured mesmerically in a trippy tale of isolation and disturbing plant life that plays like a druidâ€™s cheese dream. It could only be the work of Cornish auteur Mark Jenkin, whose debut drama, Bait, was a handmade treasure back in 2019. Here, he uses the same vintage aesthetic and 16mm cameras to craft a worthy companion piece to any of the great â€™70s folk horrors, as Mary Woodvineâ€™s botanist goes full The Lighthouse on a remote island.\n\nThis gripping, intelligent doc interviews the subjects of some of the most famous docs of recent years about their lives through a lens. The stars of The Staircase, Hoop Dreams and Capturing the Friedmans reveal what itâ€™s like to be at the eye of a non-fiction narrative story, testimonies that are delivered with compassion and insight. Equally interesting on the issues of telling someone elseâ€™s story (duty of care, whether participants should be paid), Subject captures the documentary form at a crossroads, hopefully finding its way to a more caring, culturally sensitive future. Filmmakers could do a lot worse than watch Camilla Hall and Jennifer Tiexieraâ€™s engrossing film as a cautionary tale.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThis social drama set on the Native American reservations of South Dakota reflects the outside status of Americaâ€™s indigenous people in stark, emotionally searing terms. It follows two mostly-unconnected Lakota boys â€“ 12-year-old Matho (LaDainian Crazy Thunder) and 23-year-old Bill (Jojo Bapteise Whiting) â€“ as they eek out a life for themselves, living hand-to-mouth in grinding poverty but boyishly hustling like the heroes of an old Italian neorealist masterpiece. Co-directors Riley Keough and Gina Gammell, and their Native American screenwriters Bill Reddy and Franklin Sioux Bob, sweeten the tough stuff with hope and cautious optimism. Blunt yet lyrical, itâ€™s a deeply rewarding watch.\n\n32. AlcarrÃ s\n\nA juicy organic tomato of a movie that deservedly won Berlinâ€™s Golden Bear, Carla SimÃ³nâ€™s channels the Spanish filmmakerâ€™s own experiences growing up on a Catalan farm to give life to one hard-working farming family. A new landowner's attempt to install solar panels threatens the farmers' livelihood in a movie that succeeds as a family drama and a deconstruction of capitalism. With incredible performances from the non-professional actors playing stressed-out peach farmers, Simon crafts a worthy follow-up to her sparkling childhood memoir Summer 1993.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAgniia Galdanovaâ€™s gorgeously shot documentary captures both the desolation of Russiaâ€™s tundras and the bravery of Gena Marvin, a drag artist whoâ€™s as colourful as her hometown is grey. As Putin stirs up anti-LGBTQ+ hatred, she turns up to a paratroopers rally dressed only in duct tape the colours of the Russian flag. But behind her swagger thereâ€™s a softness, and Queendom captures so many quiet moments of faltering connection with her bewildered, smalltown family too. Itâ€™s painful and beautiful all at once.\n\nItâ€™s complicated enough when stay-at-home dad Haider (Ali Junejo) finds fulfilment as a backing dancer to trans performer Bibi (trans actress Alina Khan) in Lahore. When he also finds love with her, the fabric of his life â€“ and his familyâ€™s â€“ begins to unravel. Faced with Pakistanâ€™s draconian censorship laws, Joyland had to struggle to the screen, but youâ€™d never know it from its effortless humour, compassion and craft. A bold snapshot of Pakistani society, masculinity and gender in flux, it would feel progressive if itâ€™d been set in Paris or Palm Springs.\n\nAdvertising\n\nPietro and Bruno, two boyhood friends, reconnect as adults in a soulful Italian language film that sweeps you up in its glorious Alpine vistas, themes of hard-earned brotherhood and sense of rough-hewn spirituality. Like the hand-constructed mountain cabin at its heart, friendship is something that must be built brick-by-brick in Belgian co-directors Felix van Groeningen and Charlotte Vandermeersch's idyllic but unsentimental story. The upshot is an emotionally eloquent film about two buttoned-up men.\n\nDoes it sound like an unquestioning hymn to capitalism? Yep. Does it get close to deifying Michael Jordan? That too. But thereâ€™s something in Ben Affleckâ€™s pacy, loose-limbed retelling of Nikeâ€™s efforts to sign a young Jordan from under the noses of more powerful rivals Adidas and Converse that blasts past any reservations. That secret sauce is a simple but infectious joy in sharp dialogue and characterisation that feels like a throwback to Hollywoodâ€™s â€™70s golden age. It doesnâ€™t hurt to have Matt Damon schlebbing-up winningly as Sonny Vaccaro, the Nike NBA savant willing to risk everything for Jordanâ€™s signature, and Affleck himself in as a wonderfully droopy version of Nike founder Phil Knight. Championship rings for all involved.\n\nAdvertising\n\nNot so much â€˜magical realismâ€™ as magical and realistic, Charlotte Reganâ€™s debut paints in much brightest colours than youâ€™d perhaps expect from a film about a young girl swerving social services in an east London estate. Full of big laughs, itâ€™s a loose-limbed depiction of that girl, 12-year-old Georgie (the brilliant Lola Campbell), as she reluctantly reconnects with the dad sheâ€™s never met (Triangle of Sadnessâ€™s Harris Dickinson). The offbeat bond that develops between them is a reminder of Taika Waititiâ€™s Boy, with Reganâ€™s affection for her characters making for a movie with a generous heart and an irrepressible spirit.\n\nThe best Alexandre Dumas adaptations in decades â€“ sorry, Dogtanian and Paul WS Anderson fans â€“ this swaggering French adventure flick has everything you could want from a swashbuckling caper. The improbably sexy cast has Eva Green as the pipe-puffing Milady, executing Cardinal Richelieuâ€™s devilish scheme against a gauche monarch, the English, the Protestants and our heroes themselves, the Musketeers â€“ here featuring a moody Vincent Cassel and a flamboyant Romain Duris. We came for the all-star line-up and stayed for the blur of sword fights, horse chases and smart storytelling choices. Roll on part deux later this year.\n\nAdvertising\n\nA nerve-shredding modern Spanish parable that offers a gradually suffocating fog of xenophobia, resentment and envy, this yearâ€™s Goya Award winner is set among scrubby, hardscrabble farmsteads of Galicia. Inglourious Basterdsâ€™ Denis MÃ©nochet essays a brooding kind of restraint as teacher-turned-farmer Antoine in the face of increasing intimidation. Rodrigo Sorogoyenâ€™s carefully constructed slowburn thriller is full of great performances, too, especially from Marina FoÃ¯s as Antoineâ€™s dogged wife and Luis Zahera as the sinewy, menacing neighbour who hates everything the couple stand for.\n\nThe bar was set low for Irish filmmaker Lee Cronin to re-raise this beloved but faded horror series from the dead. The return of the demonic possession Deadites was originally intended to go straight to VHS (okay, streaming), and franchise OGs Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi were only distantly involved as exec-producers. But by hellfireâ€™s light, Cronin and co cleared that bar by miles with a ferociously funny gore splatterer tailor made for baying Friday night crowds. Australian stars Lily Sullivan and Alyssa Sutherland excel as estranged sisters holding back the dark in a condemned LA apartment tower, rather than a cabin in the woods. We never thought weâ€™d say this, but bring on the sequel.\n\nAdvertising\n\nFresh from Paul Verhoevenâ€™s sexy nun psychodrama Benedetta, Virginie Efira takes things down a notch or two as the survivor of a Bataclan-style massacre at a Parisian bistro. Full of sensitivity in its depiction of the lonely path walked by a PTSD sufferer, French director Alice Winocourâ€™s enthralling drama is alive with empathy. And itâ€™s the Caesar-winning Efira who centres it all as a woman emotionally imprisoned by her trauma, with BenoÃ®t Magimel providing soulful support as a fellow survivor who helps her through.\n\nInspired by Swedish author Andreas Malmâ€™s eco-manifesto, which suggested that non-violent protest was doomed to fall short in the face of the climate change catastrophe, co-writer/director Daniel Goldhaber and his diverse young cast (American Honey star Sasha Lane is a standout) craft an urgent thriller exploring the personal toll of committing to an existential cause. The source text was dynamite, while this is more of a slow burn. But when it catches fire, itâ€™s both a compelling thriller and a clarion call to action.\n\nAdvertising\n\n43. The Mission\n\nâ€˜Thereâ€™s a fine line between faith and madness.â€™ That line in this enthralling doc is physical as well as metaphorical, and itâ€™s crossed by zealous 26-year-old American missionary John Chau when he set foot on the Indian Oceanâ€™s remote North Sentinel Island clutching a Bible in 2018. As Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss, the co-directors of 2020â€™s equally thoughtful doc Boys State, chart, the evangelical urge to spread the Christian gospel resulted in Chauâ€™s death at the hands of indigenous islanders who saw his very presence as an existential threat. And, as The Mission suggests, wasnâ€™t it? As an elegy for a young man full of promise and a critique of the religious groups that sent him into danger, itâ€™s powerful stuff.\n\nOne of the low-key delights of the year has Gareth Edwards rediscovering his early promise after the bruising experience of Rogue One and the murky misfire that was 2014â€™s â€‹â€‹Godzilla. Sure, it adds a few noughts to the budget, but The Creator is more of a part with his excellent guerilla-style debut Monsters, combining clever visual effects with glorious real-world locations to build a believably dystopian futurescape and then embroider it with an intimate story of grief, surrogate parenthood and timely questions of identity. The plot, in which John David Washingtonâ€™s broken-down ex-soldier bonds with an all-too-human superpowered A.I. (Madeleine Yuna Voyles), is Philip K Dick-meets-Apocalypse Now, with eye-popping Asian locations that make it a killer travelogue as well as a satisfying cerebral action-sci-fi.\n\nAdvertising\n\nIt would have been so easy for Darren Aronofskyâ€™s adapted-from-the-stage chamber piece to get swamped by its prosthetic, fat-suited artifice and one-location staginess. That it doesnâ€™t is down to a career-best performance from international treasure Brendan Fraser. He makes you take grieving, apartment-bound college tutor Charlie, a man facing up to his own mortality, to your heart in just a few scenes, supercharging this fable of human frailty and reconciliation with endless empathy and emotion. Weâ€™re not crying, youâ€™re crying.\n\nA toy inventor (Get Outâ€™s Allison Williams) creates a sentient A.I. doll with creepy eyes and the grip of an industrial vice as a companion for her bereaved niece. What could go wrong? Just about everything, as this giddily mean-spirited Blumhouse horror charts. Despite having Sawâ€™s James Wanâ€™s boody fingerprints all over it as co-creator, it reins in the nastiness in favour of big laughs, including some instantly meme-worthy doll dances. Roll on M4GAN.\n\nAdvertising\n\nCinematically, the fantasy genre has tended take itself very seriously, but Dungeons & Dragons comes at its swords and sorcery with a refreshing and exuberant irreverence. Writer-directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein respect their role-playing tabletop game source material, but also mirror the sense of levity and improvised invention you get while playing it. With the help of an amiable ensemble, the jokes come as thick and fast as the FX-driven action. Game for a laugh, indeed.\n\nHirokazu Kore-eda has a knack for taking gritty slices of social realism and sprinkling them with a kind of escapist stardust. Who else could turn the story of actual baby traffickers into a bubbly feel-nice yarn in much the same way Shoplifters parlayed hard-scrabble lives into a quiet heartwarmer full of wit and heart? Here he heads to Busan, South Korea, and borrows Bong Joon-hoâ€™s old mucker Song Kang-ho to headline another touching, wryly funny tale of surrogate families. Charles Dickens would be proud to have written a character like Songâ€™s larger-than-life adoption broker Sang-hyun."
