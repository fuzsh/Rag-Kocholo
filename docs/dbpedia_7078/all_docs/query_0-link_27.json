        "text": "August 2024 will see such major releases as the Criterion Collection edition of Martha Coolidge’s raw autofiction Not a Pretty Picture, Kino Lorber’s 4K discs of French New Wave classics Alphaville and Last Year at Marienbad, a new 4K restoration of Alfred Hitchcock’s penultimate film Frenzy, and the return of Ivan Dixon’s revolutionary spy film The Spook Who Sat by the Door at the BAM Cinematheque. We’ll circle back to some of these—Dixon’s film in particular has been hard to find for a while now. But you’ll have to forgive us, because we’re on a different type of wavelength this month at Shelf Life.\n\nWe’re doing as the Europeans do and going on a little holiday in August. We’re still watching movies, of course. But nothing too strenuous, you know? We’re in an inner-tube type of mood, floating down the lazy river of cinema with metaphorical drink in hand. This month’s selections are all what one might refer to as “trash”, a term we use with nothing but love. Trash is fun. Trash is great. Long live trash! See you in September, when we’ll have the mental energy for subtext and theme once more.\n\nLive frogs thwapping against the windows of a Southern mansion like fat drops of rain soundtrack the supremely goofy and oddly hypnotic Frogs. Hailing from the good old US of A (and accidentally progressive in its vision of nature getting revenge on the capitalists destroying it—on the Fourth of July, no less!), Frogs comes from American International Pictures, the preeminent producer of cheap, quickly made drive-in fare in the ’60s and ’70s. As with today’s streaming space-fillers, any artistic merit in an AIP movie is a bonus.\n\nThe biggest/funniest problem with Frogs, as many Letterboxd members note, is that the frogs barely kill anyone. As Matt points out in a spoiler-filled review, the entire swamp unites to punish wealthy, wheelchair-bound bastard Jason Crockett (Ray Milland) and his equally intolerable family. This includes snakes, lizards, spiders, alligators and a snapping turtle who takes its sweet time mauling a woman as she stands in ankle-deep mud and screams. It even rips off The Birds in a scene where the Black characters collectively decide they’ve had enough of this shit and take off, leaving the white people behind to die. (See? Accidental progressivism.)\n\nBut the movie is called Frogs, damn it, and so director George McCowan inserts reaction shots of frogs every time a character is killed off by another creature. What dark magic is this? Are the frogs psychically controlling the other animals? Are they leading a herpetological revolution? “Every single shot ends with a cut to a random nearby reptile or amphibian, sometimes being thrown to land menacingly on a nearby object. This is pure cinema and I wouldn’t change a thing,” Stephen writes. Combined with the somnambulant pacing and cardboard performances, the effect is like that of a Jean Rollin or Jess Franco movie of the period, so bizarre and clunky it ascends into something surreal.\n\nIt’s “like AIP’s Birdemic, but with actual animals,” Anna says. There’s no on-screen animal cruelty, but someone is clearly gently tossing frogs into the frame from just off screen, a touch that stays hilarious throughout the film’s short 90-minute runtime—at one point, a frog lands on an old-fashioned gramophone and scratches the record to a halt. But the real natural wonder of this movie is a young, shirtless, pre-mustache Sam Elliott, who co-stars in an early role as a nosy environmentalist who’s there to say “I told you so” when the aquatic uprising begins. You’re welcome.\n\nHillbillys in a Haunted House came out five years before Frogs, but it feels like an artifact from another era. In fact, the only sign that this very white slice of B-movie cheese was made in 1967 and not 1957 is the fact that it rips off The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Many Letterboxd members compare it to Scooby-Doo, which gives you a good idea of the general vibe: Flynnick describes it as “an extended episode of Scooby-Doo with a shockingly high amount of violence,” while Joe places it in larger context when he says that it has “DNA from The Munsters, Get Smart, Scooby-Doo, The Grand Ole Opry, and (naturally) The Beverly Hillbillies.”\n\nIndeed, there’s a Scooby-Doo type of innocence to the characters in this one, whose bumbling makes them endearing even when the movie is, in John’s words, “baffling” and “utterly incoherent”. Hillbillys—no, I have no idea why they spelled it like that—was made in Nashville for the Southern drive-in circuit, which is a polite way of saying that its production was probably even cheaper and more rushed than Frogs. But the cast list is surprisingly stacked: John Carradine and Basil Rathbone co-star as bumbling mad scientists, with Lon Chaney Jr. as their manservant and Linda Ho as their boss, “dragon lady” stereotype Madame Wong.\n\nThe sequel to the even more obscure Las Vegas Hillbillys, the “hillbilly” in Hilbillys in a Haunted House refers to hillbilly music. It’s not a musical in the sense that the songs have anything to do with the plot, but the two genres of music (country and Western, eyyyy) were way more important to the makers of this film than horror or comedy. One particularly egregious example occurs when a character pauses for a solid ten minutes to watch a young Merle Haggard (in his screen debut!) performing on television. But the boldest refutation of filmmaking convention comes when the last twenty minutes abandon plot entirely in favor of a “jamboree” performance from the film’s stars.\n\nNow, I like cry-in-your-beer hillbilly songs, which took me a long way in terms of enjoying Hillbillys in a Haunted House. If I didn’t, I might agree with the Letterboxd members who consider it possibly the worst movie ever made. “The house wasn’t really haunted and the people in it weren’t really hillbillies,” Andy complains—which is technically true. But it also has two of my absolute favorite things in the entire world, which are sheet ghosts and a guy in a gorilla suit who absolutely does not need to be there. That puts me more in line with Rod’s confession that he has “a squishy-soft spot in my heart for this harmless, utterly stoopid movie.” If you don’t think you can handle it straight, Rifftrax’s legendary commentary track will help the moonshine medicine go down.\n\nBy the standards of its own franchise, Nispel’s F13 is actually quite successful. Sure, the movie has no sense of place, space, pacing or suspense. But it might be the horniest of all the Friday the 13th movies, which is impressive in itself: These slashers all feature topless teens courting death while fornicating in the woods, but the ’09 version also has a backwoods weirdo licking a porno centerfold, disembodied sex mannequins, and a compliment so ridiculous it’s quoted in two popular reviews of the film: “You’ve got perfect nipple placement, baby.”\n\nAnd in a slasher, where there’s sex, there’s violence. The kills in the ’09 Friday are bloody and brutal, with a Freudian emphasis on impaling people with gigantic blades and a Jason who’s been working on improving his run times when he’s not cultivating his secret weed patch and tunneling underneath the ruins of Camp Crystal Lake. Cameron is a fan of the more agile killer, writing that “while I love Kane Hodder’s inquisitive head tilts and methodical, emotionless murders, it’s so fucking cathartic to see Jason leap after someone and just fucking whip an axe at them.”\n\nAmid all this sublime ridiculousness, the downsides of Friday the 13th are the inferior score—outdoing Harry Manfredini is next to impossible, to be fair—and the dopey, pandering nods to the franchise’s origins. I’d call the frat-boy energy that permeates Nispel’s film like a can of Axe left in a hot car overnight a minus as well, were it not for the creatively violent comeuppance that we know is coming to these bros before the end of the picture.\n\nBasically, “​​when you adjust your expectations accordingly it’s gory brainless fun,” as Belian explains. “This big dumb piece of crap has really grown on me over the years. Love seeing some of the most obnoxious characters of the series being taken down,” Helen adds, and Ty summarizes not only this film but everything we’re covering this month when he writes, “it may be trash, but it’s fun trash!” Exactly, Ty. Exactly.\n\nFabrizio Bava—a go-to assistant director for American productions in Italy, including House of Gucci and Succession—is the fourth generation of Bavas working in the film industry. His great-grandfather Eugenio was a special-effects pioneer in the silent era. His grandfather Mario was a Gothic horror master and a leader of the giallo genre. And his father, Lamberto Bava, once made a movie where a guy on a motorcycle drives over the seats of an empty movie theater, killing demons with a katana as German heavy metallers Accept blares on the soundtrack. Many Letterboxd members note that Lamberto Bava seems to have inherited a love for heightened aesthetics and intense color from his father. But where giallo is all about edgy perversity, Demons is party-hearty fun.\n\nThat’s not a dig on Lamberto—particularly not this month. The Demons movies are splatter horror classics, and if nothing else they united the Bavas with the other first family of Italian horror, the Argentos. (Dario co-wrote both films, while Asia made her screen debut in Demons 2.) It’s a double bill of cartoonish ’80s excess described as “the perfect slice of midnight madness,” “a yellow-eyed, fang-bearing, pus-oozing good time,” and “the greatest heavy metal horror of all time.” Indeed, the pictures were deeply influenced by punk, new wave and heavy metal, stacking the soundtracks to both films with artists like Mötley Crüe, Billy Idol, Dead Can Dance and The Smiths, and interpreting subcultural archetypes through Italian horror’s absurdly heightened lens.\n\nBava’s lone biker didn’t stand a chance against a theater full of demons, but I bet Tarzan, Pirate, Caligula and the rest of the Intrepidos Punks could take them, no problem. Vinegar Syndrome’s new double feature is trash with a capital “T”, two notorious punk-themed Mexploitation films that made their way north on VHS sometime in the ’90s and have been sought-after bootlegs ever since: Both Intrepidos Punks and its sequel, Revenge of the Punks, have been logged on Letterboxd fewer than a thousand times as of this writing.\n\nWhat’s so infamous about these movies? First of all, once you hear the Intrepidos Punks (pictured above) theme song—which you definitely will, given that, as Ira notes, it “plays at least 30 times during the course of the film”—you will never, ever get it out of your head. Ira highlights the movie’s chief pleasures when he writes, “If you’d sent Roberta Findlay to Mexico… with a minimal budget, a few custom motorcycles and some leftover Mad Max costumes, I imagine you’d have gotten this exact movie, except with a bit less manic energy.”\n\nKasarin adds that “it’s like every other punk motorcycle film turned to eleven,” with all the pros and cons the biker-movie subgenre implies. On the upside, Intrepidos Punks and Revenge of the Punks are more interested in chaos than boring stuff like “plot”, which leads to some truly transcendent moments of decadence. The downside is that, far too often, sexual assault crashes the party. These are gritty, violent pictures that can be “repellent, offensive and deeply nihilistic,” as Ira says. The kinds of B-movies where a guy really gets buried in sand up to his neck, and then has a real bag of snakes dumped on his actual head as he screams. The cartoon sadism is compelling.\n\nAnd the looks! My god, the looks! Fans of chain mail, safety pins, tinfoil spikes and spandex will be in heaven. Opinions are mixed on which of the two films are better, but Revenge has more of an actual story. Sure, a lot of it is lifted from Death Wish. You got a problem with that?"
