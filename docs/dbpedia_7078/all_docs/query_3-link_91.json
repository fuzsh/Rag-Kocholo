        "text": "It’s that time of year for a ghost story, so come along with us as we visit the Haunted House of Harbour Island, Bahamas, also known as the Glen Stewart Mansion. The Haunted House is not much of a mystery as far as its location, as it appears on pretty much every map I’ve seen of the island. They even had, at one time, a gift shop. Follow the pink signs!\n\nThe mystery surrounds the strange circumstances under which the the original owners left. The story goes that the home was built in 1945 by a wealthy family. The owner left one day for medical tests and never returned. Presumably, those tests did not go well. The legend goes that the table was left set for a lavish dinner, and the family was never seen again.\n\nIn the 1960’s, a Greek shipping magnate bought the estate for his new bride, who upon visiting the property, refused to live there because it was haunted. In the 1980’s, looters ravaged the property and more damage was done by fire.\n\nThe property is now open for visitors, however, you won’t find the gift shop in operation any longer.\n\nIt is worth a visit to imagine the property as it once was.\n\nEnjoy more of our visit to Eleuthera and Harbour Island, Bahamas!"
