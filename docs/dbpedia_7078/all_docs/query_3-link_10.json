        "text": "Upon landing on the island, a ghostly text would appear over the present player's screens, \"You should not have came. Leave now, and your fate will be tame\" or something like that. Many haunting paintings and sculptures can be found. After 3 minutes, another text appears. \"Die.\" An unearthly scepter will spawn, red tint and fog will form, and the music will be changed. The scepter is extremely dangerous and unkillable. If you manage to find the treasure without being turned into lasagna, it will be a haunted chest. This chest will constantly spawn skeletons and ghosts to kill you.\n\nThat is awesome, I think stuff like this would be great, they should do a seasonal thing like Destiny too where stuff changes for the holidays. I always thought that added to the mix when logging on to play and it happened to be Halloween.\n\nThis looks great! I would love to see more things like this. Like the Chest of sorrows. Like one that marks you on the map for other players within a certain distance of you.\n\nIt’s a nice idea but tbh i think that would be better if the chest doesn’t spawn skeletons and stuff, it should be like a boss raid island. If you manage to find the treasure in the mist and don’t die like a sea rat, you should be able to sell the haunted treasure like a normal one, surviving the ghost-boss of the island it’s more than enough other threats are not needed\n\n@wilbymagicbear yup! The entire hunted island need to feel like a boss fight, heavy mist, immortal ghost captain killing anyone who’s trying to steal his precious treasure, voices and sounds of cursed souls (also from the chest) if something like this comes out it would be really cool!\n\nThe only question is: What would u do if another crew steals that treasure? I would suicide :,D\n\n@theobsidianpic I like this idea, someone had a thread earlier about collecting different items that were \"mythic\" and this goes along with that idea. Plus it would be an awesome addition for PvE players to achieve and you could claim a special title as Rare hinted in their progression stream. If someone tries to raid your ship for that chest you could have a failsafe that it disappears and you have to go back and capture it again from the island.\n\n\"As you set the chest down it the hold, a bright flash of ghostly green light pulses from its cracked wood. You blink, and when your eyes open your old familiar ship is gone, and in its place is a ship you know all too well. You are now piloting the Ship of the Damned\"\n\nplacing the chest gained from the haunted island raid in a ship reskins it as this haunted vessel, and makes its crew appear as skeleton versions of themselves, until the chest is stolen, or cashed in"
