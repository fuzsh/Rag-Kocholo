But she found her true calling when she opted to pursue a career behind a camera.\n\nVisual flair\n\nTwo reasons why the Emmy Award-winning TV series 'Mad Men' is so highly acclaimed are its visual style and historical authenticity.

This year, he reveled in more adulation as a finalist on the TV show American Idol.\n\nPeg Phillips, 1918-2002\n\nPeg Phillips, a retired accountant who took acting classes at the University of Washington at age 65 and went on to have a career that lasted nearly two decades, died Nov. 8. She was 84.\n\nStar stuntwoman\n\nJumping out of helicopters, driving speeding cars and fighting bad guys is all in a day’s work for Marla Casey, ’86.\n\nAthlete and actor\n\nHerman Brix’s storybook account of growing up in the lumber camps of Washington to become an Olympic athlete and major movie star is the subject of Mike Chapman’s 2001 book \"Please Don’t Call Me Tarzan.\"\n\nStarring role\n\nFor the past three springs, Pamela Reed has come to campus to work with undergraduates and students in the Professional Actor Training Program\n\nAgainst all odds\n\nAfter surviving the horrors of the Holocaust, Tom Lantos got a fresh start at the UW.
