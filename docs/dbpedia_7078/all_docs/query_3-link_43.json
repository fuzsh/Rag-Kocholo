        "text": "In a twist straight out of a spooky storybook, Brian Dansereau claims he was fired from the famously haunted Old Arnold Estate, better known as the house from \"The Conjuring,\" under bizarre and ghostly circumstances. Dansereau says his boss fired him after receiving accusations from the house’s long-deceased 19th-century owner.\n\nThe Spooky Scandal of Brian Dansereau's 'Conjuring' House Firing\n\nThe Burrillville, Rhode Island farmhouse has been a spooky sensation since its star turn in the 2013 horror film \"The Conjuring.\" Paranormal fans flock to this creepy house for a brush with the supernatural, but the latest ghostly gossip has everyone buzzing.\n\nGhostly Gossip\n\nDansereau, who worked at the haunted house until last month, said his boss, Jacqueline Nuñez, fired him because a ghost told her that he was stealing. According to Dansereau, Nuñez—a self-proclaimed medium—claimed that John Arnold, who owned the house in the 1800s with his wife Abigail, tattled from the afterlife, accusing Dansereau of swiping $3,000.\n\n“She said, ‘John Arnold told me you’ve been stealing money out of the cash box for the past two months,’” Dansereau recounted, showing text messages of the eerie exchange. “I literally stopped and had to ask, ‘John Arnold, one of the original owners?’”\n\nNuñez confirmed she fired Dansereau based on the spectral snitching, adding that she’d also been warned by former staff and guests about his shady shenanigans.\n\n“It does not matter whether you believe in the paranormal or not,” Nuñez said. “I and everyone else deserve to have experiences that bring understanding and meaning to our lives, even if it means getting ghostly warnings about wicked actions. As for Brian, my experience with him went downhill fast, leading to his at-will termination.”\n\nThe Ghost Snitching\n\nDansereau finds the ghostly accusation hard to swallow. “For a spirit to go after a staff member like that, I’ve never heard of such a thing at any haunted venue, let alone the ‘Conjuring’ house,” he said.\n\nDansereau has since filed a complaint with the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training, seeking $9,000 in unpaid wages. The agency confirmed they received his spooky submission. Nuñez, however, denied owing Dansereau any money, insisting her records show discrepancies that prove the ghostly gossip.\n\nNuñez said she’s planning her own ghostly grievance, alleging Dansereau has been slandering her in YouTube videos, damaging her spectral reputation.\n\n“This is all I will say on this matter,” she huffed.\n\nDansereau described the ghostly ordeal as “horrible,” admitting that it’s causing him sleepless nights and serious anxiety.\n\n“This was going to be my sunset job,” he sighed. “In all my career, I’ve never been accused of stealing.”\n\nAnd so, the haunted house saga continues, with ghosts, gossip, and a heaping dose of spooky drama."
