        "text": "Seventeen years ago (officially on June 19, 2007) we recorded the very first Bowery Boys podcast, appropriately about Canal Street, the street just outside the window of Tom’s apartment on the Lower East Side.\n\nThat’s right! If our podcast were a person, it would be preparing to graduate from high school next year.\n\n(For more information, check out our 15th anniversary show from two years ago.)\n\nWe cannot have possibly imagined on that hot June night, wielding only a bad microphone, a new laptop and some reasonably interesting information about a terribly polluted water soure, that would still be doing this, stronger than ever.\n\nThank you, listeners and readers, for helping us celebrate almost four hundred years of history in the past seventeen.\n\nHere’s a new way to experience our old podcasts.\n\nBelow is our entire list* of shows, placed in a particular chronological order, based on a critical date in that subject’s history.\n\nViewing our back catalog of podcasts in this fashion, we hope that you can really start seeing the entire history of New York City emerging. To this day, there are some blatant holes in our historical coverage that we hope to close up in future shows.\n\nSo enjoy! And thank you all again.\n\n*In the rare case where we revisited a subject (Flatiron Building, Canal Street) we only included the most recent show. For ‘rewind’ episodes with updates, they have been included over the original. And the first four episodes are not available (but those who support us on Patreon have access to episodes #2-4).\n\nYou can find our podcasts anyplace. Read here for more information on where you can find our shows.\n\nAnd finally — we can continue recording the Bowery Boys podcast thanks to the generous support of those on Patreon. Supporters receive bonus audio, free merchandise and first access to tickets for upcoming live shows.\n\nDUTCH AND ENGLISH PERIOD\n\nLand of the Lenape and #432 The Lenape Nation: Past, Present and Future (Pre 1609 inhabitants)\n\n#83 Henry Hudson and the European Discovery of Mannahatta (1609 – Hudson sails into the harbor)\n\n#272 Life in New Amsterdam (1624 First permanent European on Manhattan Island)\n\n#433 New Amsterdam Man: An Interview with Russell Shorto\n\n#434 Amsterdam/New Amsterdam: Empire of the Seas\n\n#212 Bronx Trilogy: The Bronx Is Born(1639 Jonas Bronck sets up a farm on what would be called the Bronx River)\n\n#267 Broadway: The Story of a Street (1642 First mention of the street in Dutch documents)\n\n#273 Peter Stuyvesant and the Fall of New Amsterdam (1647 Stuyvesant arrives)\n\n#390 The Story of Flatbush: Brooklyn Old And New (1651 The village of Flatbush chartered)\n\n#430 The Story of Flushing: Queens History, Old and New (1661 John Bowne House is constructed)\n\n#301 Haunted Houses of Old New York(1680 Conference House built)\n\n#228 The Pirate of Pearl Street: The New York Adventures of Captain Kidd (1690 Kidd moves to New York)\n\n#97 Trinity Church (1698 First Trinity Church opens)\n\n#406 How Wall Street Got Its Name (1711 Wall Street slave market opened)\n\n#149 John Peter Zenger and the Power of the Press (1735 Zenger trial)\n\n#379 How Chelsea Became a Neighborhood (1750 The original Chelsea Manor is completed)\n\n#90 Columbia University (1754 King’s College established)\n\n#115 African Burial Ground (Mid 18th century — Burials begin in the area south of Collect Pond)\n\nREVOLUTION\n\nThe Revolutionary Tavern of Samuel Fraunces (1762 Samuel Fraunces opens tavern)\n\n#266 New York City During the Revolutionary War (1776-1783)\n\n#333 Tearing Down King George: The Monumental Summer of 1776\n\n#201 GOWANUS!
