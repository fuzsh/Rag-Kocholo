        "text": "BURRILLVILLE – A nearly 300-year-old home was just another country farmhouse until 2013, when the movie “The Conjuring” told the story of the Perrons, a Rhode Island family who lived there in the 1970s, and their battle with malevolent spirits inhabiting the house.\n\nIt has since been called one of the most haunted places in America.\n\n\"The Conjuring,\" and the subsequent \"Conjuring Universe\" of films, has drawn thousands of tourists to a quiet corner of Rhode Island, tucked along the Massachusetts line, bringing the occasional small-town controversy along with visitors' dollars.\n\nA subsequent owner yielded to popular practice and officially changed the name of the place to The Conjuring House.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the house that helped inspire The Conjuring Universe.\n\nIs 'The Conjuring' based on a true story?\n\nThat depends on whether you believe in ghosts.\n\nBut the movie is based on the Perron family, who moved into the house in 1971, and said they began experiencing paranormal phenomena. Andrea Perron, the oldest daughter, who was a teenager during the events at the house, reported the family's story in a series of three books, \"House of Darkness: House of Light,\" published beginning in 2011.\n\nParts of the movie take substantial liberties with the Perrons' story.\n\nHow is The Conjuring different than the real story?\n\nThe demonic witch Bathsheba Sherman at the center of the movie is only loosely based on a real person\n\nBathsheba Sherman, the reputed 19th century witch whose malevolent spirit torments the movie family until a climactic battle during an exorcism, is more prominent in the movie, which portrays her as having sacrificed her infant son and then hanging herself from a tree, much to her husband's horror. It is the spirit of Bathsheba Sherman that causes all the mayhem in the movie.\n\nThe real-life Bathsheba Sherman did not die by suicide after sacrificing her son. She died in Burrillville in 1885 at age 73, with her son, Herbert Leander Sherman, living another 18 years, into his 50s.\n\nThe exorcism did not happen, but something similar did\n\nThe climactic basement exorcism scene did not happen, though Perron describes a similar scene in her books. A séance, not an exorcism, was held in a first-floor room next to Roger and Carolyn Perron's bedroom. According to the book, Perron was levitated during the séance, and thrown into an adjoining room.\n\nHow haunted is Rhode Island? 30+ places to visit ... if you dare\n\nEd and Lorraine Warren were minor characters in real life\n\nWhen \"The Conjuring\" premiered, Andrea saw Lorraine Warren, who, with her husband, Ed, are the main characters of the movie and its two sequels. Now deceased, they were among the best known paranormal investigators in the late 20th century, Ed a self-described demonologist and Lorraine a clairvoyant and medium.\n\nEd and Lorraine Warren, the real-life married couple from Monroe, Connecticut, who are the protagonists of \"The Conjuring\" and its sequels, were not the central figures shown in the movie.\n\nAmong the best known paranormal investigators of the late 20th century, Ed, a self-described demonologist, and Lorraine, a clairvoyant and medium, were thrown out by Roger Perron.\n\nThe house shown in the movie is not the real-life house\n\nThe Burrillville farmhouse house was built in the 1730s, with parts of it having a second floor. It has a rustic exterior.\n\nThe house shown in the movie is actually located in North Carolina and has three floors, lots of windows and a two-story columned porch.\n\nWhere is The Conjuring House?\n\nThe house is at 1677 Round Top Road, also known as state Route 96. It is a quarter-mile from the Massachusetts state line at Uxbridge. It is a 26.2-mile drive from downtown Providence and 60 miles from Boston.\n\nWho owns The Conjuring House?\n\nBoston real estate developer Jacqueline Nuñez has owned the house since May 2022. She bought it from Jenn and Cory Heinzen, who bought it three years earlier as their home, but also opened it to paranormal investigators, who paid to stay overnight in the house.\n\nFrom the time the Perrons sold the house in 1980 until the Heinzens bought it, it was a private home – a home daycare even operated there with no reported malevolent paranormal activity.\n\nAfter the movie came out in 2013 the place became haunted by trespassers who sought out the newly famous house.\n\nCan you go to The Conjuring House?\n\nIf you make reservations ahead of time, you are welcome to visit the The Conjuring House. There are brief tours, overnight stays, camping in the summer and special events.\n\nBut, those just showing up will find more than just the spirits to dissuade them. The house has a sophisticated security system, including 32 cameras in and around the house with facial-recognition and license-plate-recording software. And, the building is staffed around-the-clock seven days a week.\n\nBut booking a $25 tour opens the grounds and house to visitors, who can take plenty of pictures.\n\n\"It's not that expensive to get access,\" owner Jacqueline Nuñez said.\n\n\"Experiences,\" as Nuñez markets them, range from a 13-hour, overnight self-led investigation, which costs $1,280 for up to eight people on weekends, to one-hour house tours, which cost $25 for those 13 and older and $20 for those 7 to 12, with no one younger allowed.\n\nOther experiences include overnight camping outside the house, three-hour gatherings with a medium and \"GHO\" events, which are similar to investigations, but they are led by an experienced paranormal investigator who will provide necessary equipment.\n\nDetails and booking of experiences are done through the website of The Conjuring House, theconjuringhouse.com.\n\nWhere to watch 'The Conjuring'\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, The Conjuring House offered movie watch parties with Andrea Perron in the house around Halloween.\n\nFor those not lucky enough to attend one of these sold-out screenings, the movie is available, either as a separate rental or as part of a subscription, on several popular screening services, including Max, Hulu, VUDU, iTunes, Amazon and Google Play.\n\nDo 'The Conjuring' and 'The Gilded Age' have a connection?\n\nNo, \"The Gilded Age\" is not part of The Conjuring Universe.\n\nBut both famous Hollywood franchises have ties to Rhode Island – \"The Conjuring\" is based on the Burrillville house, \"The Gilded Age\" is partly set and filmed in Newport by Julian Fellowes and HBO. But, the connection between the two is deeper.\n\nActor Vera Farmiga, 50, stars in three \"Conjuring\" films as Lorraine Warren.\n\nFarmiga's sister, Taissa Farmiga, 29, plays socialite Gladys Russell, daughter of main characters George and Bertha Russell.\n\nTaissa Farmiga also stars in two \"The Nun\" movies, which are considered part of The Conjuring Universe, further binding the \"Conjuring\" and \"Gilded Age\" franchises.\n\nHave ghost hunters Sam and Colby visited The Conjuring House?\n\nYouTubers Sam and Colby, who explore haunted locations on their channel and who spent a brief time at The Conjuring House in 2021, returned this year to spend a week at the house.\n\nThey posted their first video from this year's experience on Sunday. It had more than 4 million views by Monday morning and sold out theater viewings in 168 locations of Cinemark, a chain with more than 300 movie theaters in the United States, though none in or near Rhode Island.\n\nA second video was promised for Wednesday.\n\nMost of the first video, roughly an hour long, focuses on celebrity ghost hunters Cody DesBiens and Satori Hawes, who bill themselves as “The Paranormal Couple,” members of The Atlantic Paranormal Society, headquartered in Warwick."
