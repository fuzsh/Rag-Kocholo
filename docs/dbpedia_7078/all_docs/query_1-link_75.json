About this list: A list of Old Dark House films. A sub-genre that leans toward comedy, farce, and whodunit mysteries. Not to be confused with Haunted House movies, which tend to involve ghosts or some other supernatural entity in a horror setting. Some common Old Dark House tropes include: - A group of strangers having to spend the night in a house, mansion or castle. - A dark and stormy night. - Secret passageways. - A killer, madman, or creature on the loose.",

        "text": "Clue adapted to the big screen featuring all the familiar names and places one remembers from the board game.\n\nOriginally released in theaters with three different endings (shown consecutively in home releases) Clue's faithfulness to it's source material, solid cast, and high energy makes it one of the genre's more beloved entries.\n\nSherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson arrive at a remote seaside manor to help solve the mystery of seven wealthy individuals whom are being murdered one-by-one.\n\nA solid entry to the long-running Sherlock Holmes series of films that ran between 1939 and 1946 featuring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce in the leading roles.\n\nA whodunit featuring literary and Hollywood's most famous detectives.\n\nThe movie plays as a parody poking fun at both the Old Dark House genre as well as the characters themselves who are portrayed as caricatures.\n\nMight be the closest thing you will find to Clue (1985).\n\nDon Knotts takes on the role of Sherlock Holmes in this murder mystery whodunit.\n\nFeatures an old mansion, a thunderstorm, secret passageways, a masked killer on the loose, guests dying one-by-one, and even the ole' picture-on-the-wall-with-the-moving-eyes gag.\n\nFor fans of Knott, this film and his Haunted House comedy The Ghost and Mr. Chicken (1966) make for a pretty good double feature.\n\nAn eccentric billionaire, looking to amuse his wife, invites five strangers to his mansion for a game of haunted house with a prize pool of $50,000 to any whom survive the night.\n\nFeatures a few cool special effects, plenty of intentionally corny ones, a soundtrack with some serious Twilight Zone vibes, and one poor guest in such a state of terror that she unleashes not one but almost a half-dozen blood-curdling screams.\n\nAdaptation of Agatha Christie's popular whodunit mystery novel about a group of individuals on a remote island whose fate soon begins to mirror that of the macabre nursery rhyme, \"Ten Little Indians.\"\n\nA product of late 19th century minstrel shows \"Ten Little Indians\" has featured different lyrics over the years the most notorious being (NSFW) \"Ten Little *******\" which, believe it or not, is actually the original title for Agatha Christie's book. The now preferred title \"And Then There Were None\" being the work of American publishers.\n\nA recently deceased woman -- killed at the hands of a mysterious masked figure in an old mansion -- seeks out Cosmo Topper to help solve her murder.\n\nIf you've seen the original Topper (1937) you'll already have a general idea what to expect from this one.\n\nI.e., a middle-aged man being placed in comical situations by a ghostly figure and a host of invisible man gags (floating objects, phantom footprints, clothes without a body, etc.)\n\nA masked killer with sharp claws and a fondness for bats is on a quest to find one million dollars hidden somewhere in an old house.\n\nChock full of red herrings this picture featuring horror icon Vincent Price can be a fun entry as long as you are willing to embrace it for what it is rather than being overly-critical for what it is not.\n\nThe Cat and the Canary (1927) features a classic setup involving a group of people meeting at an old spooky castle for the reading of the family will. One is promised the entire inheritance with one condition: survive the night with your sanity intact.\n\nSolid sets, lighting, some interesting silent era edits, and a slew of plot beats that many later films in the genre would imitate are the highlights here. If you have the stomach for silent films its worth checking out at some point.\n\nA bit of a slow starter Murder by the Clock really starts to pick up steam in the second half as dead bodies mount and a game of cat and mouse gets set in motion.\n\nIn the center of it all is lead actress Lilyan Tashman as the blonde temptress, Laura Endicott, who seduces and manipulates every man around her to murder; a performance that really carries the film.\n\nCharlie Chan sets out to solve the death of an heir in this murder mystery whodunit.\n\nMore procedural in nature it follows Chan as he moves about the premises discovering clues and ultimately piecing together the crime scene.\n\nContains a pretty cool reveal of the dead body and, if I'm not mistaken, Chan almost killing the family butler simply because he wanted to flex on some fellow detectives (??). Uh, okay Chan.\n\nThe plot doesn't make any sense, but when you've got an octopus terrorizing a lighthouse during a thunderstorm... who cares!\n\nAlso, make sure to keep an eye out for the special effect involving an old lady; one that even eighty-plus years later still manages to impress.\n\nMore of an effective mood piece than compelling story this 1969 Italian gothic horror mystery certainly offers up something quite different from all the Hollywood fare on this list.\n\nThe basic setup is there of course, an unrelenting thunderstorm forces a group into a nearby old house to be greeted by some disturbed caretakers, but absent are the secret passageways and killer-on-the-loose plot devices replaced instead with serious drama, flashback sequences, and no shortage of sexually suggestive content.\n\nHaving watched in late October this one was very fitting, but outside the Halloween season personal preference lies greatly with the more silly Hollywood formula.\n\nA detective arrives at a tavern and quickly finds himself embroiled in a murder mystery. Not only are the guests dying one-by-one but someone has bolted all the doors and windows to prevent escape.\n\nThe Rogues Tavern is admittedly rough around the edges even by 1936 standards. In quite a few respects it could be compared unfavorably to the earliest of talkies.\n\nBut, there is just something endearing about villains so sure of themselves that instead of simply killing their victims they will monologue for five minutes (with a maniacal laugh no less) only to fall flat on their face that's worth at least an extra half-star in the final rating.\n\nThe plot can be a bit lackluster at times, but the features of Italian giallo -- beautiful women, slightly more artsy approach, and an offbeat soundtrack -- keep this film interesting throughout.\n\nBe wary of the film's poster though. Even though it gives the impression of a dark and spooky atmosphere Five Dolls For an August Moon is very much shot in a modern setting in broad daylight.\n\nThe Door with Seven Locks -- while never fully capitalizing on its intriguing setup of valuable jewels sealed behind seven doors each requiring a separate key -- still makes for a perfectly passable film.\n\nThe setting for this one is probably the highlight. An estate consisting of a large manor, cottages, overgrowth, webbed tombs, an inquisition museum, and no shortage of late night mist all setup a nice mood.\n\nWhen it comes to the essence of Old Dark House The Phantom (1931) pulls no punches.\n\nNo tedious backstory. No elaborate setups. Simply a two minute prison escape segueing into a house full of people running around trying to both find and escape from a cloaked figure known as The Phantom.\n\nIt's certainly not a movie without serious faults, but if its Old Dark House you're after there are certainly much worse ways to spend an hour.\n\n\"This kind of senseless horror with old dark house mystery trappings is not very good, but is strangely enjoyable.\" -- British movie critic.\n\nHorror movie that would have made for a decent B-movie double feature back in the day.\n\nCastle of Evil features a tried-and-true setup of a will reading at a remote castle during a night-long thunderstorm. Guests soon begin dying one-by-one as they race to find who is behind it all.\n\nThe film can become too talkative at times and the villain reveal is fairly early so this one is not exactly steeped in mystery, but the fact that the killer had a 50's style mad scientist backstory made for a welcome change.\n\nA movie that shows great promise early with a fantastic Manhattan Mystery radio scene, guest arrivals at a mansion reminiscent of Murder By Death, and plenty of silly wordplay humor.\n\nWhat follows, unfortunately, is more-or-less a lull filled with setups that go nowhere, Gene Wilder having to improv to cover for a lackluster script, and an ending so jarring one may have the urge to rewind thinking they missed something.\n\nThough perhaps most baffling was the misusage of Gene Wilder and costar Gilda Radner. Great together on-screen they inexplicably spent the majority of the film apart.\n\nAnother remake of Secret of the Blue Room; this particular version serving as a studio vehicle to showcase the singing and dancing talents of four women.\n\nThe hostess, Anne Gwynne, performing a singular opening number while three other girls under the group name The Three Jazzy-Belles contribute an additional three; the highlight being the number \"Boogie Woogie Boogie Man\" performed in a dimly lit kitchen to a captive butler.\n\nEven though the plot is mostly an afterthought in this one (short sixty-minute runtime) the film still manages to entertain throughout.\n\nBased off a stage play of the same name one of the key figures in this film is, not surprisingly, an individual who chooses to dress up as a bat; complete with a utility belt for rappelling up & down buildings, throwing shuriken shaped like a bat, spotlight that projects a bat symbol, and even what appears to be a smoke bomb for quick escape.\n\nThough much cruder in design (the Bat looks more like Bruce Wayne had he invented a teleportation device and accidentally spliced his genes with a fly) the basic elements are unmistakable.\n\nThe director, Roland West, would go on to remake this film in 1930 as a talkie (The Bat Whispers) which has been cited by the comic book writer, Bob Kane, as an inspiration for the now famous superhero.\n\nFilm that contributed to the creation of DC Comics' Batman character; something this modern fan-made trailer seeks to spotlight.\n\nWhile certain elements do stick out its actually the original silent version by the same director that will likely elicit the most \"Wait a minute. That's Batman!\" moments.\n\nIn terms of entertainment this version ends up suffering the same problem as its predecessor; the most intriguing figure, The Bat, is missing in action for prolonged periods leaving behind a lot of mystery elements that could be described as overwrought.\n\nThe East Side Kids, in an attempt to find help for their injured friend, unwittingly stumble upon the residence of a monster (Bela Lugosi reprising his role as Dracula?)\n\nTo make matters worse before they can leave they must first find one of the boys who has gone missing somewhere inside the house.\n\nWhat ensues is an old dark haunted house comedy with light-horror elements, cheesy cliches, and an ending that may surprise.\n\nAnother typical Bowery Boys outing; forty-minutes of filler comedy antics topped off with a twenty-minute Old Dark House farce finale.\n\nThe latter of which was fairly underwhelming. Some spinning walls, underused bad guys (*snap* Snap Sizzolo), zero mystery, and costumes that looked like they were bought at the last minute from the local dollar store.\n\nOn a positive note, series vet Huntz Hall does a fine job here. With little to work with he still manages to make this one a painless sit-through.\n\nRelatives try and fail to have an elderly woman declared mentally unfit in order to gain access to her fortune. As payback, the old lady invites everyone to meet up at her old mansion at the stroke of midnight with the intent of toying with them.\n\nIf you aren't new to the genre you know what happens next. Guests start turning up dead, suspicion mounts as to who the killer is, and then more people show up to add to the madness (in this case a sheriff, a weird neighbor, and a reporter with his girlfriend.)\n\nNothing out-of-the-ordinary until the end when the old lady concocts a plan that is totally nonsensical even for a genre know for its absurdities. At least its different I guess...\n\n*awkward Elmer Fudd laugh*\n\nA remote station, a storm, and the threat of a haunted train are the driving forces behind this 1941 Old Dark House film. The latter in lieu of a more typical murder mystery plot one tends to expect from the genre.\n\nNow as cool as a phantom train may sound, truth be told, its mostly a group of people sitting around waiting out the weather while comedian Arthur Askey tries to entertain everyone with his antics. Time that could have been better spent having someone or something spooking the guests.\n\nA group of oddball characters have converged on Melody Manor for the night; a house reportedly haunted by a violin playing spectral who visits at the stroke of thirteen. How or why all of these people have gotten here I cannot recall, but for these films such details are of little importance anyways.\n\nThings will move about as if controlled by the supernatural, suspects will traverse through secret passageways and trapdoors, and someone will die.\n\nPlayers include a crazed hermit, a bumbling cop, a circle of criminals, rival amateur detectives, and a housemaid played by Zasu Pitts who appears to be taking her acting cues from Popeye's Olive Oyl.\n\nAs is the case with many the synopsis sounds way cooler than the final product. In the end its just another middling sixty-minute Old Dark House mystery.\n\nA family gathers for the reading of a will which stipulates, \"Should anyone break the terms herewith they shall die in the most painful of ways according to their own phobia.\"\n\nWell, this is certainly no laughing matter -- it is horrifying.\n\nDoes a horror film, even if it shares commonalities with the genre, belong anywhere near an Old Dark House list? :shrug:\n\nI guess if nothing else you'll get treated to some above average cinematography and a \"Oh hey, it's that guy from Jaws!\" moment.\n\nSetup involving a group of Americans visiting a ramshackle Ireland castle whose owners, seeking to stave off foreclosure, scheme to turn the place into a haunted tourist attraction.\n\nFeatures a ghost story centered around jilted lovers that draws some parallels to Disney's Haunted Mansion and an ensemble of recognizable cast members engaged in zany situations for 90 minutes, which never quite hit the mark, had this viewer thinking about 1991's Nothing but Trouble.\n\nLike the above, High Spirits is riddled with faults. Daryl Hannah and Steven Guttenberg drag in the lead roles while Liam Neeson plays a controlling sexual predator. Many jokes fall flat and the general horniness of characters fixated on skelping, bahookies, and tupping near the end turned what could have been at least a family friendly outing into some kind of weird ghost fan fiction.\n\nCertainly watchable, but quite scattershot.\n\nBoys of the City (1940) features The East Side Kids spending the night at a mansion where, soon after, a murder takes place. Without the assistance of police its up to them alone to apprehend the killer.\n\nOne of a popular series of films in the 1940's centered around tough-talking kids (e.g. Dead End Kids, Little Tough Guys, Bowery Boys) these films were known for their low budgets and tight shooting schedules. Despite this the final products were actually quite watchable, including this film.\n\nThere is one big problem regarding Boys of the City that has to be mentioned though and that is its racial stereotyping. Its very common for the lone black cast member in this genre to serve as the bug-eyed scaredy-cat of the group. What is not, however, is forcing this same character to praise the host for serving him a big ole' plate of watermelon -- which he gleefully tears into -- while all the white kids are presented with proper meals.\n\nA mystic butler, a psychic, a maniacal serial killer, and a scientist wishing to be buried alive are just a few of the happenings in this 1933 Old Dark House.\n\nNone of which, unfortunately, are integrated particularly well into the story. Mostly just a series of cheap tricks designed to confound the audience rather than build up any real sense of intrigue.\n\nBit of a shame as the film's reveal of how the murders were committed did have some cleverness to it; in more capable hands this one could have been a lot of fun.\n\nEscaped maniac murder mystery that slightly deviates from the formula by adding in a playwright and two clueless gentlemen (neither of which move the needle much.)\n\nIts a passable picture but not something one would consider exciting in any way; a cast filled with mostly upper-class stiffs beholden to proper etiquette and a very underwhelming ending see to that.\n\nPre-code that follows the tried-and-true \"heir visits old estate for the reading of a will with the promise of wealth\" setup.\n\nFeatures a lead actor who is, well, not particularly good at his craft shall we say and a script that seems to strive for screwball comedy but mostly with failed results (e.g. manly tickle fight scene.)\n\nIf seeking this type of story there are certainly better options out there ahead of this one.\n\nA pair of newlyweds decide to spend their honeymoon at a family farm and soon find themselves saddled with the local police, gangsters incognito, a prison hangman, and a dead body that has gone missing.\n\nSounds more exciting than it really is. The Old Dark House elements were instantly forgettable (the transfer being so dark didn't help) and the comedy contains a fair amount of the husband and wife bickering like an old married couple.\n\nAfter seeing the success of plays such as The Bat and The Cat and the Canary D.W. Griffith decided in 1922 to try his hand at the genre. What resulted was, sadly, a rather unfocused and bloated affair (clocking in at a robust 2h 30m).\n\nThe main problem with One Exciting Night is Griffith's insistence on including melodrama and lectures on topics such as greed/love in a genre that simply thrives on its light-comedy, silly spooks, and mystery.\n\nThe melodramatic beats are oft neglected for extended periods and the Old Dark House elements underwhelming if not messy to follow. Toss in copious amounts of white actors in black face and things just sink even lower.\n\nOddly the best thing about One Exciting Night has nothing to do with murders, secret passageways, or even half a million dollars. Its the Category 3 storm that wreaks havoc in the final twenty minutes. From a technical standpoint its kind of impressive.\n\nMore murder-mystery than Old Dark House, Secret of the Chateau centers around a valuable book and a series of guests suspected of stealing it.\n\nDue to its plodding nature and immaterial subplots (whether its the token romance or flirtatious blonde) this one has the feel of an endurance test. Even the murder-mystery elements and payoff, when they finally do occur, fail to leave an impression of any kind.\n\nSpecial shoutout to the creaky door scene though. I don't even...\n\nA group of dull middle-aged affluent folks host a black tie party where they proceed to converse about the state of television technology (or something of that nature.) Shortly thereafter one kicks the bucket and the film's focus may or may not have shifted to that of a missing television component (honestly its not even worth remembering.)\n\nQuite a few of the actors cannot act, the ones who can seem to be too disinterested to put forth the effort, the energy oft rivals that of a retirement nursing home, and outside a few spinning gizmos or brief mention of the medulla oblongata there is likely not much here to peak ones' interest.\n\nCheck and Double Check (1930) was Hollywood's attempt to cash in on a very popular radio serial of the 1930's titled Amos 'n' Andy, a program that featured two black men in a variety of comedic situations.\n\nAs you may have already observed from the poster, by \"two black men\" what we really mean is two white guys in black face performing to the typical demeaning black stereotypes of the era.\n\nPlotwise the movie does not have much to offer. The McGuffin involves Amos and Andy trying to find a piece of paper marked 'Check and Double Check' in an old abandoned house while an unrelated group searches for a family deed. This lasts for maybe ten minutes before a few \"Two days later...\" sequences bring an end to the film.\n\nAfter release the studio abandoned all plans for a sequel. Amos 'n' Andy lived on though, returning to radio (and briefly television) with continued success until the early 50's.\n\nTwo items of note for this movie:\n\n1. It offers a rare glimpse of actor Bela Lugosi in color.\n\n2. It's usage of a rather bizarre flash forward sequence involving a lifeless corpse on a concrete slab. One of the more jarring transitions put to film and its used quite frequently.\n\nCheap sets, weak script, poor editing, and stilted acting. As a testament to its quality one of the actors can't even play dead properly for 3 seconds.\n\nThere is also the problem that despite including a \"mansion\" with guests dying one-by-one to a mysterious killer this movie simply doesn't feel like an Old Dark House film as almost everything of consequence occurs over multiple days via old WW1 aerial footage."
