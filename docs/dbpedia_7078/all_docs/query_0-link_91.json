        "text": "The Haunted Mansion Parlor attraction poster and other details have been revealed at the D23: Ultimate Disney Fan Event. The Parlor is coming to at least two Disney Cruise Line ships: the Disney Treasure and the Disney Destiny.\n\nHaunted Mansion Parlor\n\nThe poster for the Haunted Mansion Parlor features Madame Leota along with several drinks, a small version of the 13-hour clock, and more. Black tentacles twist and turn creating the border for the poster, giving it a spooky, nautical feel.\n\nSome of the already-released concept art was on display.\n\nThe melting bust of Brother Roland is featured both physically and on the poster. This bust was crafted as inspiration for Disney Imagineer, Rolly Crump, who was one of the driving forces in designing the original Haunted Mansion.\n\nOther Haunted Mansion iconography, such as the serpent door handles, are included. Samples of textiles, flooring, and more were also displayed.\n\nAdditional art of Marc Davis’ “cat lady” concept was also on display, showing her in her human form before she switches to a siren.\n\nOther Marc Davis concept art was shared, and while the character never made it into the Mansion, The Mariner will be featured in the Parlor where his story will be “taken to new depths.”\n\nIn the samples of fabric, we can see the iconic purple damask wallpaper found throughout the Haunted Mansion attraction. A 3D bust of the sign for The Haunted Mansion Parlor is also on display in the back, its style similar to the sign found at the Haunted Mansion.\n\nAre you excited to see The Haunted Mansion Parlor begin to come to life? Let us know in the comments.\n\nIf you’re thinking of booking a cruise on one of Disney Cruise Line’s new ships, why not contact our official travel agent, Be Our Guest Vacations, and let them handle the entire booking process for you!\n\nFor the latest Disney Parks news and info, follow WDW News Today on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram."
