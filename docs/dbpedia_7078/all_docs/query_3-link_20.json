I still have lots to share, but for now: NECRONOMICON PROVIDENCE is almost here, and I can’t wait!\n\nHere’s my committed (meaning these are things I absolutely will not miss; the rest is fluid) schedule (below). I’ll also be attending panels, the HP Lovecraft Film Festival, the art show opening reception, and of course some street parties as well as performances (I’ll also be helping out at the sales tables for both WE ARE PROVIDENCE and the New England Horror Writers). A few of my friends are having a picnic at Lovecraft’s grave, too, so there’s that to look forward to…and, of course, Waterfire!!\n\nSound like a great time? It is.

I had sudden attacks of nausea with heart palpitations and passing out, brain fog, lack of energy, and abnormal depression and anxiety. Doctors insisted it was “menopause,” “stress,” or “food poisoning.” It was after the COVID shots everything got worse: my hair fell out, I was in constant abdominal pain, and eventually, I couldn’t eat anything except oatmeal. It was all I could do to get out of bed, and, to quote Steven Belanger’s story “Blackstone,” in the Monsters in the Mills collection, “do the damn day.” Food terrified me and social situations became impossible, so I didn’t go anywhere except work. Doctors just kept telling me “I don’t know. More tests a month from now” while I was literally starving to death.\n\nMeanwhile, the world chugged ahead. I felt abandoned, visiting my friends’ social media accounts to see them delight in life, eat things without a second thought, write stories, go places, make plans. In Britt Nicole’s song “The Sun is Rising,” she sings about a person’s hopes for the future burning, and I identified: I was being reduced to ashes and swept aside.\n\nI thought seriously about Swedish Death Cleaning and making my will. Call me a drama queen, but when everyone tells you there’s nothing wrong with you and you know there is, you’re sick as a dog, you can barely function and that starving will eventually kill you? You lose something very important: hope.\n\nAs far as my writing, I prioritized the Spring 2024 issue of 34 Orchard, which was released with great success and, if I do say so myself, it’s a stellar issue (get your free copy here: https://34orchard.com/issue-9/). Our Zoom release cocktail hour was an absolute blast, in which I was talking to people in several different countries around the world right in my dining room; my husband’s reception at his Masonic lodge, which I planned, was an amazing day; I was honored to serve on a virtual panel for StokerCon 2024. But everything I had in progress—a short novel for an upcoming call, a screenplay due at the end of June, the finishing up of Tidings, a short story for an anthology that needed an overhaul—all of that was shelved. I couldn’t write a decent sentence if you’d tied me to a chair and forced me; my inner voice was gone. In truth, though, none of it seemed to matter. Most nights, all I had the energy for after a long day of surviving was laying on the couch and watching Netflix. I didn’t talk to too many of my friends, even though I made sure their birthday gifts went out on time. I would look around my messy house and think, oh well, weren’t those parties so glorious? Wasn’t going out and having pizza and spending time with your friends fun? How about all of those awesome vacations—aren’t you lucky you got as many as you did? I’m so glad you took photos, because you’re never going to have that again. Your life is over, be grateful for what you had and what you accomplished. Next.\n\nThat said, there were some other interesting bright spots, Read the rest of this entry →\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI’m thrilled to announce that I’ve been a member of the Rhode Island-based writer’s community We Are Providence since November of 2023, and what a ride it’s been! I’ve had strong Rhode Island ties since the early nineties, when I did undergraduate work at the University of Rhode Island. Over the past thirty years, I’ve spent so much time in the state it feels like home, and the folks in We Are Providence have not only welcomed me with open arms, they have made me feel like I truly belong.\n\nHelmed by Christa Carmen (The Daughters of Block Island) and L.E. Daniels (Serpent’s Wake: a Tale for the Bitten), we’ve just put the finishing touches on the group’s second anthology, Monsters in the Mills, which releases in August (and includes a brand new story by me called “Cinched”).\n\nIf you love all things abandoned, this collection is for you. Edited by Christa and L.E., cover art by Mr. Michael Squid, and introduction by Faye Ringel, and published by Australian-based Interactive Publications, here’s the back cover copy (if you’re wondering if I wrote it because it sounds like me, yes, I did):\n\n♦\n\nDEEP IN THE WEEDS, THEY WAIT.\n\nBehind graffitied fences or obscured by woods, the abandoned mills of New England watch.
