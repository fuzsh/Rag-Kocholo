        "text": "There are not enough words to describe the horror masterpiece that is The Night of the Hunter.\n\nThe plot of the film—faithfully adapted by Pulitzer Prize-winner James Agee from the novel of the same name by Davis Grubbs—focuses on a morally corrupt serial killer masquerading as a wholesome reverend (Robert Mitchum in easily his best role) who tricks a woman into marrying him so that he can find $10,000 hidden by her deceased husband. Unfortunately for him, the only one who knows where the money is really located are actually his new wife’s two children, who seem to recognize the reverend for the monster he really is.\n\nIconic actor Charles Laughton's first and only directorial effort, this amazing thriller has gone on to achieve near-universal acclaim since its release, with the French film magazine, Cahiers du Cinéma, ranking it the second greatest film ever made, right behind Citizen Kane.\n\nCombining the lighting reminiscent of classic Hollywood noir films and the shadow-heavy German expressionist films of the '20s, somewhat surreal imagery, a hauntingly beautiful score, and Southern iconography, Laughton manages to create a film that feels more like a fairy tale set within a Southern Gothic story.\n\nMitchum himself couldn't have been cast better in the role of the now-iconic villain Reverend Harry Powell (who would be ranked 29 on AFI's 100 Years…100 Heroes & Villains list), with his signature calm-eyed, tired expression and booming voice translating well into his dual role as the charming, handsome preacher who wins over every adult, and the devious, misogynistic, hypocritical wolf in sheep's clothing that he truly is.\n\nIt's one of the most ingeniously made movies ever made, full of impressive, dreamlike images and music that have gone on to inspire everyone from Guillermo del Toro to Exorcist director William Friedkin to indie auteur Nicolas Winding Refn. It’s a movie so well-made, it’ll leave you legitimately upset that Laughton never directed another feature after this incredible debut."
