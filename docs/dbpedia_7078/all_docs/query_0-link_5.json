        "text": "This week we ran a little experiment. I wanted to see if BLINK, Stuart Semple’s “blackest, mattest ink” was truly blacker and matter than my old favorite, Dr PH Martin’s Black Star. For the subject of the experiment, I thought I’d use the appropriately-named Inque, top villain in Batman Beyond’s rogue’s gallery.\n\nKeep in mind that, should I prefer the BLINK, it’ll take a bigger chunk out of my wallet. BLINK is about twice the price of Dr PH Martin’s for the same amount. So far, though, when you look at the piece under top-down lighting, with no angle on the camera, it seems like the inks are of equal blackness with about the same matte finish.\n\nBut when the lighting or camera hits the piece at a slightly obtuse angle, suddenly the differences were more apparent. While Inque stayed very matte, Batman was showing a distracting sheen on his larger black surfaces. Dang it. Does that mean I have to spend more money?\n\nI threw some color over everything to see if that would change things, but the glare on the Dr Martin’s was still apparent even under that watercolor pigment. Looks like the victor in the illustration is also the winner of the ink battle. Not sure what solution I’ll seek, but I’m glad I ran the experiment. Knowing how your inks will look under all kinds of lighting conditions is pretty key to producing consistent art.\n\nYou can see the whole process in the video below.\n\nFiled under: Black and White, Comics, Experiment, Fan Art, Illustration, process | Tagged: Batman, Blink, comics, Illustration, ink, monsters, natural media, process, Vince Dorse | Leave a comment »\n\nThis week marks the 89th anniversary of the classic Universal Monster movie, The Bride of Frankenstein. Michelle and I realized this late into the evening on Saturday and quickly ripped through a new ink wash illustration and process video to celebrate the occasion.\n\nThe actual bride of Frankenstein (played by Elsa Lanchester in a dual role that also saw her portray Mary Shelley) only appeared in that one eponymous movie. But despite not having as many times up at bat as Frankenstein’s Monster, Dracula, or The Wolfman, the character has left just as indelible an impression on pop culture as her monstrous counterparts.\n\nAnd while I always look forward to rendering The Bride in watercolors and debunking the idea that she has green skin (preposterous!), I wanted to stick to the same black-and-sepia ink and wash technique I used on all those other Universal Monsters last October. Now she fits right in with the rest of them.\n\nThe sepia ink is a nice counterpoint to the black ink, but I wanted to use it for The Bride for a very specific reason. Elsa Lanchester had red hair. You can see it very clearly years later when she plays Katie Nanna in Mary Poppins opposite Julie Andrews. It follows, then, that The Bride of Frankenstein may also have had red hair. It’s not canon? Well…it’s my drawing, and I say she did. The warmer tones of the sepia ink do a passable job of conveying the idea that she has red hair, while not being as obvious as a watercolor wash.\n\nIf you want to see my process for this image, how it turned out, and listen to Michelle and I gab about movies and toys for seven minutes or so, the link to the video is below.\n\nFiled under: Black and White, Fan Art, Illustration, process | Tagged: Bride of Frankenstein, fan art, horror, Illustration, ink, monsters, process, Universal Monsters, Vince Dorse | Leave a comment »\n\nBack in January, we inked Godzilla as a way to celebrate our love of Godzilla Minus One. This month, Godzilla X Kong:The New Empire hits theatres. And while we’re not sure whether we’ll love it or not, Michelle and I thought it was only fair to ink up a King Kong in anticipation of the release.\n\nThe difference between the two should be obvious. I inked Godzilla with pens, using hatching to achieve my grey tones. With Kong, I decided to use ink wash. It’s a softer look, but I think it works well for the composition and subject (a giant gorilla stomping through a misty forest on an uncharted island).\n\nIn addition to my own ape inks, we have once again conned Michelle into playing a game of “Ink It or Stink It” where she’ll take a run at inking my drawing of Kong’s apparent nemesis, Skar King.\n\nWe both learned a little about technique and materials while working on these, which is our constant goal. But if you want to see how they turned out, you can check out the video at the link below:\n\nFiled under: Black and White, Fan Art, Illustration, process | Tagged: fan art, Godzilla, Godzilla X Kong, Illustration, ink, Ink It or Stink It, kaiju, King Kong, monsters, natural media, process, Vince Dorse | Leave a comment »\n\nI don’t know what you guys did over holiday break, but Michelle and I just kept going back to the theatre to see Godzilla Minus One. We weren’t even necessarily huge Godzilla fans before this movie. I mean, of course he’s a ton of fun. He’s a monster. But this movie? It stomped us flat and left us breathless. Best movie we’ve seen in a long time.\n\nWhen I was a kid, when I saw a monster movie that got under my skin, I’d spend days lying on the living room rug filling my sketch pad (and any other random piece of paper I could lay my hands on) with drawings of the monster. So it seemed natural for me to do the same thing with this new, powerful, terrifying Godzilla.\n\nBig difference is that now I have better tools at my disposal. So I lightboxed my sketch onto heavy cotton watercolor paper, and went at it with Black Star inks and Micron fineliners.\n\nMy plan was to set up three distinct values — lights, mids, darks — and set up the composition so that they frame each other nicely, and lead the viewer’s eye where I want it to go. I wrestled over whether to render this in inkwash or hatching — each have their benefits — but chose to go with a very measured, hatched linework for the midtones to contrast with the chaos of the subject matter.\n\nI had a lot of fun working on this and practicing my brushwork, hatching, and monster doodling. If you want to see me put the whole things together, Michelle and I recorded my process for this week’s video and talked about our Godzilla Minus One experience (no spoilers).\n\nFiled under: Black and White, Illustration, process | Tagged: Godzilla, godzilla-minus-one, horror, Illustration, ink, monsters, natural media, process, Vince Dorse | Leave a comment »\n\nMaybe haunted isn’t the right word. More like it’s crawling with monsters. And it’s not just one friend, it’s a few. And it’s all my fault. Because this year, Michelle and I decided to draw and ink a bunch of Universal Monsters and send them to some of our friends and Patreon supporters as Halloween cards.\n\nSending and receiving Halloween cards is a tradition that seemed a lot more prevalent when I was a kid. Hardly any of my friends do it anymore. But it’s something I always enjoyed, and something I’m not willing to let slip so easily into the past.\n\nAnd while picking a few cards up in the drug store to mail out is perfectly fine, whenever I can squeeze in the time to make the cards by hand, it’s always a lot more fun. So I grabbed some watercolor paper, inks, brushes, and pens and got to work.\n\nWe even figured out a way to make them a little more than just hand-done illustrations (although, that would’ve been fine). We crafted a delivery system that made the drawings more like actual cards, and even supplied a little mystery by way of a window cutout that obscures parts of the illustration until you open the card.\n\nIf you want to see all the monsters we sent out to terrorize our friends this Halloween, you can watch the process video below:\n\nFiled under: Black and White, Experiment, Illustration, process | Tagged: Halloween, horror, Illustration, ink, monsters, process, Vince Dorse | Leave a comment »\n\nHey! During October, a lot of artsy-types do a daily challenge: ink something every day, draw something every day, and they match it to a particular theme. I’ve done it before and I’m doing it again. This year, we’re calling it Muppetober!\n\nFor every day in October, I’ll be inking a Muppet. There’s a lot to choose from, so I’m just picking some of my favorites. But I’m not inking too heavily or elaborately, because it’s more than just inking, I’m also going to try to add some watercolor on top.\n\nWill I be able to pull it off? I don’t know. We’re 13 days in and…yeah, it’s a struggle. And it’s not necessarily the drawing and inking. That’s goes down pretty smoothly. The watercolors, they’re a bit more involved. But the real pressure? The real time suck? Michelle and I are recording my process for all of these, editing and uploading a short to YouTube every single day.\n\nAll of this is going on, of course, while we’re juggling some other projects and commissions. But we’re letting you know about this in case you need some Muppets in your life every day. Even for just one precious minute.\n\nHere’s the link to our shorts. Have fun!\n\nFiled under: Black and White, Disney, Experiment, Fan Art, Illustration | Tagged: Experiment, ink, Muppets, watercolor | Leave a comment »\n\nHey, we are back from hiatus on our YouTube channel and celebrating fall, the upcoming Halloween season, and monsters of every stripe. So here’s the latest process videos we dropped.\n\nFirst, Inking The Tarman Zombie from Return of the Living Dead. A favorite zombie movie of mine, and a great opportunity to practice my inking.\n\nBut we also work in 3D at the studio. We wanted to experiment with foam clay, so I made this witch’s mask. Didn’t turn out too bad, and now I wanna make more.\n\nHope you enjoy the videos. We have lots more fall/Halloween/monster related projects we’re trying to squeeze in before the end of the year. If you’re into that stuff, come on over and subscribe to our YouTube channel, Long Lost Friend Studio. It’s spooky fun. -v\n\nFiled under: Black and White, Experiment, Fan Art, Illustration, process, Sculpt and Build | Tagged: how to, Illustration, inking, masks, monster, process, sculpting, Vince Dorse, witch, zombie | Leave a comment »\n\nA few weeks ago, Run Red Run and I descended into the Gotham City sewer system to ink Batman villain, Killer Croc. And like some of the other things I’ve inked on our YouTube channel, Croc is currently (as of me typing this) available in my shop.\n\nI used a brush for some of it, but I really relied on my tech pens for texturing his arm wraps, scaly skin, even the hatching on the slimy stones in the dank tunnel.\n\nAnd for fun, Run Red Run played a round of Ink It or Stink It and inked another batman villain favorite, The Scarecrow.\n\nHow did we each do with our inking?
