        "text": "Promoted on the internet for months, sold as a true story, brilliantly raw and realistically executed, Bliar Witch is the mother of the found footage genre. The viewers imagination does all the work here as we watch three film students come unraveled in the woods. A love it or hate it experience that I happen to love.\n\nVery well acted and made ghost story about a little boy who sees dead people and must therefor live a life of lonely terror knowing he will not ever be believed. Enter child psychologist with lots to prove and lots to learn, (played very well by Bruce Willis), to save the day. Toni Collette is outright devastating as the desperate mother and the central performance by Hayley Joel Osmet is some of the best child acting you will ever see.\n\nRichard Mathesons tale of a working mans world falling apart after visiting a psychic who leaves him \"open\" to more experiences is very well made and acted. Kevin Bacon discovers his home may have a ghost in it- and his family watch terrified believing him mad. Great stuff.\n\nHilarious and original monster movie pits Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon against subterranean monstrosities and the result is way funnier and exciting than it is ridiculous and stupefying. I love love love this picture, and so should anyone who likes the genre and has half a heart or half a brain.\n\nThis is the first time a Clive Barker adaptation really hits it out of the park. A sinister and disturbing vibe permeates this film. Virginia Madson plays a journalist looking into urban legends in some very dangerous neighborhoods. She remains strong and brave in her pursuits until finally encountering the legend first hand. Tony Todd will keep you away from the bathroom mirror for a good while.\n\nA year after the murder of her mother, a teenage girl is terrorized by a masked killer who targets her and her friends by using scary movies as part of a deadly game.\n\nThis decade defining funhouse of a movie is oh so very nineties. The cast is pretty and the script is wry and referential to the knowing horror audience. Unlike other films that would imitate it- this film still totally works as a horror flick- it is brutal while being funny and funny while being brutal. Kudos to all involved.\n\nPerhaps the greatest modern example of a \"serial killer procedural\" Se7en is a dark as they come horror thriller that packs a real punch. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt give towering performances as two detectives chasing down a brilliant psychopath who is carrying out murders that express the seven deadly sins. Tense and hypnotizing it leads to a breathless finale.\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs remains the strongest entry in the hannibal lecter series of films. Anthony Hopkins is indeed brilliant as the famous cannibal- but he is deftly kept on the sidelines for the bulk of the movie so that the real horror of inexperienced FBI agent Starling (Jodie Foster) tracking down serial killer buffallo bill can be explored. Ted levine deserves more praise for his work here as Bill. The film will stay with you and it earned its oscars.\n\nAfter a famous author is rescued from a car crash by a fan of his novels, he comes to realize that the care he is receiving is only the beginning of a nightmare of captivity and abuse.\n\nKathy Bates is the fan from hell in this well made Stephen King adaptation that achieves something remarkable. William Goldmans adaptation of the novel softens a lot of the harsher edges of the book, and the result may in fact be an improvement. James Caan and Kathy Bates give career high performances in this the second masterful Stephen King adaptation from director Rob Reiner.\n\nThis all really happened. Anyone who questions why this historical drama makes a list of horror movies is clearly not familiar with the true case this film is based on. Stephen Rea plays a Russian investigator tasked with finding a child serial murderer even as the system he works for denies the existence of serial killers at all. Donald Sutherland Max Von Sydow and especially Jeffry Demunn give very strong performances.\n\nThis is about as strange as they come. A cemetery caretaker must rebury the tenants in his graveyard after they start rising from the dead. That`s crazy enough- but then there is the mysterious woman our protagonist keeps bedding and killing- and then there`s his assistants love affair with a severed head- and then there is a conversation with Death himself- oh- and a few killing sprees. All this and it is funny, sexy, scary, gory and weirdest of all: strangely profound. Wow.\n\nThis strange tripped out love letter to both Stephen King and HP Lovecraft could only have come from director John Carpenter. A private investigator tasked with finding a missing author finds himself lost in a world of his subjects creation. Original funny and scary this is a picture that gives you more than your moneys worth.\n\nMourning his dead child, a haunted Vietnam War veteran attempts to uncover his past while suffering from a severe case of dissociation. To do so, he must decipher reality and life from his own dreams, delusions, and perceptions of death.\n\nWar vet Tim Robbins is an unhappy fellow. Traumatized by the war and by the loss of his young son, Jacob now finds himself having visions of demonic figures as well as a life of dream logic surreality. It may seem obvious where all of this is leading- but the journey is unlike any of its kind.\n\nIn 1960, seven pre-teen outcasts fight an evil demon who poses as a child-killing clown. Thirty years later, they reunite to stop the demon once and for all when it returns to their hometown.\n\nThe first half of this Stephen King adaptation is as good as they come- but sadly the quality fades when the focus of the story shifts to the grown ups. Tim Curry produced millions of nightmares from his performance of Pennywise the shape shifting child killing clown from one of Kings most horrifying stories.\n\nA widower takes an offer to screen girls at a special audition, arranged for him by a friend to find him a new wife. The one he fancies is not who she appears to be after all.\n\nYikes. A lonely widower and his friend arrange to audition woman for a film that does not exist. Though dishonest, the intentions are simple enough- find a new love interest. The woman that catches our protagonists eye has some issues of her own. Must be seen to be believed. Be warned- this film is confusing, populated with dreams and more than a dollop of anguish and torture. I mean all of that in a good way.\n\nA film crew follows a ruthless thief and heartless killer as he goes about his daily routine. But complications set in when the film crew lose their objectivity and begin lending a hand.\n\nA camera crew inexplicably follows a spree killer as he goes about his business of violence terror and even rape. All this while giving a play by play to the camera. Way late in the game the film crew start to have scruples about what is happening. This black and white French film is brutal horror satire and much like AUDITION, does not a great date movie make.\n\nA creepy high school kid figures out that an old man in his neighborhood is actually a nazi war criminal in hiding. Rather than turn him in- the kid wants to learn from the man and so blackmails him into a relationship that will inevitably lead to ugliness. Ian Mckellen is great as usual- but the film pulls its punches in the last act. Well made and acted but falls short of the disturbing source material.\n\nThough way over the top at times this remake has some amazing acting in it. Robert Deniros wronged ex con shows up to bring some terror to his former lawyers door step. This may be the last time I remember Deniro earning his rep as the worlds finest living actor, he is simply terrifying. The suspense generated throughout the film will make any other flaws forgivable and seeing Scorsese doing his violent energetic thing in the directors chair makes me wish he would do a straight up horror flick some day.\n\nA young man's mother is bitten by a Sumatran rat-monkey. She gets sick and dies, at which time she comes back to life, killing and eating dogs, nurses, friends, and neighbors.\n\nPeter Jacksons low budget gore fest is hilarious and disgusting and can only be seen to be believed. After his mum suffers a rat monkey bite, a young man goes to increasingly bizarre lengths to first conceal and then destroy a zombie outbreak in his home. The lawn mower sequence is one for the ages.\n\nMid-evil dead was the better title- but waddaya gonna do. The evil dead trilogy closes out with this crazed special effects heavy fever dream that finds wise cracking Ash knocking boots and busting skulls after being lost in time. There is something of a plot involving the recovery of the necronomicon and a sieged castle- but the movie is really just a fun collection of physical and verbal gags crammed into a crisp delicious 80 minutes.\n\nUtterly mad. A great cast is assembled for this period gore fest involving cannibalism, redemption and supernatural horror. Uneven in tone the film keeps hitting you with scene after befuddling scene of odd humor horrendous violence and clumsy exposition. Even the score seems to belong to some other movie. All this and yet it works as a peice of \"well that just happened\" entertainment. Unpredictable and worth a look if just for its very strangeness.\n\nSo old school it should almost have been shot in black and white this ghost story is a highly watchable genre entry. Hired to disprove a haunting a professor (Aiden Quinn) finds his skepticism challenged mightily. Familiar but well done.\n\nVHS is scary. A cursed video is killing all those who watch it. After her niece dies a woman tries to solve the tapes mystery before falling victim to its curse. Creepy and trend setting.\n\nSeveral teen stereotypes accidentally hit someone on the road- and cover up their crime. One year later revenge seems to surface in the shape of a hook wielding psychopath. No new ground is covered here- but the movie is decently made and populated with lots of pretty people to cheer for and against. Solid genre entry if kind of a pg affair."
