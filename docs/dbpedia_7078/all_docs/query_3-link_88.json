        "text": "Signature Entertainment has acquired the U.K. and Irish rights to the Matt Dillon thriller Haunted Heart from Film Constellation.\n\nThe feature, produced by Oscar-winning director Fernando Trueba (Belle Epoque) and Fenia Cossovitsa (Blind Sun), is directed by Trueba from a script he co-wrote with Rylend Grant (State of Consciousness). In addition to Dillon, the film stars Juan Pablo Urrego (Primate) and Aida Folch (The Artist and the Model).\n\n“The thriller is set on an idyllic Greek island where a young Spanish woman arrives at a seaside restaurant and starts a dangerous love affair with the mysterious American owner,” according to a plot description.\n\nThe deal was negotiated between Signature Entertainment’s acquisitions and development executive Max Hart and Film Constellation’s director of acquisitions Edward Parodi.\n\n“Haunted Heart simmers with mystery in its idyllic setting, highlighting another stand-out performance from Matt Dillon,” said Hart. “We are pleased to be partnering with Film Constellation once again and are delighted to be bringing the film to audiences in the U.K. and Ireland.”\n\nFilm Constellation is continuing sales on the film, including at the Cannes film market."
