        "text": "REVIEWS\n\n“The best documentary award goes to a film that demonstrates extraordinary mastery of the full symphonic range of cinematic tools: cinematography, editing, score, sound design and, perhaps greatest of all, an exquisite use of metaphor. To a film that moved us deeply, impressed us immensely and made us feel we were witnessing nothing less than the emergence, fully formed, of a major new cinematic talent”\n\n– Tribeca Jury\n\n“[A] poetic profile of the forgotten asylum seekers detained on Christmas Island… Lush cinematography… Timely subject matter.”\n\n– Laurence Boyce, Screen International\n\n“Gorgeous… [A] beautifully rendered portrait of an alien landscape… Reality is suspended and in its place Brady’s surrealist dreamscape, shot breathtakingly by Michael Latham, becomes an all-encompassing tribunal on man’s inhumanity to man in a clandestine landscape filled with lost spirits.”\n\n– Pamela Cohn, Filmmaker Magazine.com\n\n“A fascinating metaphoric collision.”\n\n– Scott Macaulay, Filmmaker Magazine.com\n\n“[A] standout… This is a film that lingers with you long after it’s gone.”\n\n– Patricia Aufderheide, Documentary.org\n\n“ Island of the Hungry Ghosts is one of the year’s most impressively made documentaries, a film that’s as occasionally surreal as it is persistently moving. Island of the Hungry Ghosts is a true discovery.”\n\n– Joshua Brunsting, Criterion Cast.\n\n( ★★★★ out of 5) – Amber Wilkinson, Eye For Film\n\n“There is a true ruminative beauty here in Brady’s impressionistic portrait of this haunted island out of time.”\n\n– Chris Barsanti, The Playlist\n\n“A documentary overflowing with empathy, poetry, and elemental power.”\n\n– Hubert Vigilla, Flixist\n\n“The magic of documentary filmmaking comes alive in this film… A thunderstorm of sensation… A powerful statement.”\n\n– Briana Atkins, The Knockturnal\n\n“Hauntingly beautiful.”\n\n– Helen Kaplow, Indie NYC\n\n“Hauntingly beautiful Island of the Hungry Ghosts combines multiple narratives…into one glorious whole… Powerful cinema… A mesmerizing work of visual wonder, the breathtaking images forming an evocative setting for a vital discussion of human rights… A rapturous viewing experience… A stunning, visceral first feature, announcing the director as a major talent to watch”"
