As a Merchant Marine Able Seamen, Jose has seen a lot and heard a lot of stories. The ship that Jose was on went past the Seychelles Islands. The ship did not stop at any of the islands. Jose remembers admiring the beautiful rock formations on LaDigue Island. Unfortunately, the ship that Jose was on moved along towards Madagascar. Jose told me if I wanted some ghost stories, that I need to either visit Sechelles Islands or read up on the islands. Well, I never did visit Seychelles Islands, but I did my share of reading about the islands. This is what I learned.\n\nThe islands have seen its share of violence. From the days, that pirates hid their treasures on the islands. To the days that the French brought over African and Malagasy slaves to the islands. The French were very cruel to the slaves, beating and torturing the slaves if they failed to obey. There were revolutions on the islands against the French and yes, there was bloodshed. Some of the slaves would curse the French soldiers by dabbling in black magic known as Gris Gris. When Gris Gris was abolished on the islands, anyone caught practicing Gris Gris were tortured and killed. Other strange practices happened on the islands. Some of the islanders would practice rituals to keep the dead from turning into zombies. The ritual had its roots with the Creole culture. The locals claim that three Dandotia (zombies) once roamed the island and if you encountered a Dandotia and if it touched you, you would become ill and die. The three Dandotia were eventually caught and decapitated. Legend has it, the three zombies were neutralized by a local shaman called a Bonom di Bwa aka The Man of the Woods. This local shaman with the help of some local islanders destroyed the zombies. The shaman is rumored to live on Mahe' Island. Let's take a look at some of the islands that are part of the Seychelles Islands chain and what kind of paranormal activity is happening on these islands.\n\nThis island was once owned by the Dauban Family. They owned the island from the mid 19th century to 1960. They had a very successful coconut plantation. Their plantation produced vanilla and Copra. The ghosts of deceased family members of the Dauban Family are said to haunt certain areas of the island and are seen a lot at the island mausoleum. A Dauban 2-year-old ghostly daughter is seen at times jumping on the bed at the Grann Kaz Plantation House. The Grann Kaz Plantation House is now a restaurant. The mother of the 2-year-old girl is also seen haunting the island and the locals call her the White Lady. Leaf Man is another ghost that haunts the island. This ghost looks like a native to the island and has leaves all over his body. He is seen usually running through the bushes.\n\nFregate Island is a pretty spooky island. On this island a headless woman is seen, walking along the shoreline. She is usually seen at night and during the day, she hides in a cave. The locals say that if you encounter the Headless Woman, don't be afraid, she is protecting the shoreline, the islands and guards the pirate's buried treasure. There is one creature to fear, it's called a Sand Devil. The locals believe this is a demonic creature conjured up by the Gris Gris. The Sand Devil looks like a little devil with horns and covered completely in sand. People that encountered the Sand Devil say that it will try to pull you into the ocean, to drown you. French soldier specters are seen walking around the island during dusk and then will fade away into nothingness.\n\nBritish citizen Mary Best once owned this island back in 1910. Her ghost is seen all over the island. She is known to sneak up behind a person and touch them. A few women locals have complained about looking into a mirror and seeing Mary standing behind them. Then we have the Seychelles Phantom Pirates that haunt this island, protecting their buried treasure. Legend has it that the pirates would kill two of their own, so they can come back as ghosts and protect the treasure. A grave marker says: \"Unhappily Unknown\". An archaeologist believes that the two killed pirates are buried at this grave marker. An owner named Brendan Grimshaw who owned this island from 1962 to 2012, says he constantly heard disembodied voices in his home. One voice told him to go to Coral Cave at 4pm and that he will see a turtle laying her eggs. He did what the voice told him and sure enough there was a turtle there, laying her eggs. Brendan has heard banging noises in his home, windows and doors will open or slam shut, his bed would shake violently. Brendan says he has heard someone in the woods that sound like they are in agony, yelling and screaming. Brendan believes this is a former slave being tortured."
