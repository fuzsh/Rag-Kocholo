The island has never really been cleared properly or anything so everything has just been left.\n\n\"Later on, when it was turned into an asylum, and because people were shoved there out of the way of prying eyes, they started to do experiments on them, horrible, horrible stuff.\n\n\"Whilst we were there, we heard the bell toll and that was quite spooky, that did actually freak me out a little bit. It was like an omen or something.\n\n\"The whole place was just really weird and eerie although you could tell from the tiles and the archways it would have been a beautiful building originally.\n\n\"You could see that hardly anyone had set foot there for years because there is no graffiti or anything it's all just natural decay.\n\n\"Nature has really taken over and it was really typical of a horror movie with all the vines and creepers.\n\n\"Definitely an experience I won't forget in a hurry.\""
