        "text": "The Haunted Brick Building (Central Point US)\n\n2\n\nThis brick building, located in Central Point and built in 1908, was recently placed on the National Historical Society list as a building that cannot be torn down. But there is another side to this building that is just as interesting as it’s looks and age…\n\nThis brick building, located in Central Point and built in 1908, was recently placed on the National Historical Society list as a building that cannot be torn down. But there is another side to this building that is just as interesting as it’s looks and age…\n\nCurrently, this building is the District Office and is located on the school grounds of Central Point Elementary, but when I was younger, it was PART of the school and in fact I had my third grade class here. All of the kids at CPE knew this building was haunted; it was something everyone talked about at one point or another. One day I was waiting with some other kids while our parents were in this building attending a PTO meeting, and through one of the windows in the back at the bottom of the building we all saw a dark shadow saunter by. OK, you are thinking “so what, little kids see all kinds of things”…\n\nBut upon recent further investigation, here is what I found out: in 1988, my future fifth grade teacher, Mr. Burke, and his then teacher’s aid, Ms. Parsons, had a class on the third floor of that building. On a few different occasions, they felt the floor shake and wondered if it was an earthquake. They soon would discover that they were the only class in that building to feel the so-called “earthquake.”\n\nThen, one of the night janitors saw (more than once) one of his brooms move across the floor all by itself. He soon refused to ever go back into that building alone.\n\nTake a look at the photos and see for yourself the haunted vibes this cool, old building gives off. But come and explore it in person, and you just may experience what many of the CPE staff and students have seen over the years, including myself."
