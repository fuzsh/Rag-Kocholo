        "text": "When billionaire Malcolm Wyatt invites Paisley to an exclusive first look at his island resort, the true-crime influencer prepares for a weekend of luxury, thrills, and posting.\n\nTurns out, she should have been preparing for her survival.\n\nSix screen-obsessed teenagers with minimal adult supervision on an isolated, inescapable island sounds like a recipe for disaster. But Paisley, Harper, Ava, James, Will, and Liam—all prominent influencers—are ecstatic to be the first people to experience Jagged Island.\n\nThis resort-style amusement park is the creation of Malcolm Wyatt, a billionaire who apparently hopes to lure the world’s wealthiest vacationers to this isle of thrills and fun. To arouse interest in his new spectacle, Malcolm invites these six social-savvy teens to an exclusive, weekend-long sneak peek at his resort.\n\nFor Paisley, the weekend couldn’t have started out better. A true-crime influencer, she is enamored by the gothic architecture, macabre weapon displays, and creepy thrill rides. Plus, the weekend has come with a new friend, plenty of delicious food, and two potential crushes. For her, Jagged Island feels like a spooky, spectacular taste of paradise.\n\nAll that changes when people start disappearing.\n\nFirst, one of the guests vanishes. Then, a staff member goes missing, too. And then the only boat off the island cannot be found. With nowhere to go, tensions rise.\n\nWhen the island’s cell service and Wi-Fi go out, Paisley and the other influencers realize that there’s evil afoot on Jagged Island. And this amusement park isn’t amusing at all.\n\nAs the group frantically searches for their missing members, Paisley wonders, who can she trust?\n\nWe don’t see much of Paisley’s parents, but they do seem understandably reluctant to allow her to visit Jagged Island. Paisley’s older brother, with whom she seems to have a good relationship, convinces them to allow her to go. Although Paisley initially chaffs her parents’ interference with the weekend, her experiences at the park give her a much greater appreciation for her family.\n\nJames, one of the influencers, completely disregards authority and instruction. However, the narrative voice denounces him for this. Against Malcolm’s instructions, Paisley and Will (another influencer) plan to sneak out at night to explore the amusement park.\n\nPaisley is a true-crime influencer and finds murder fascinating. She mentions the importance of detaching her emotions from these murder cases.\n\nWhile the descriptions aren’t particularly graphic, several characters do get stabbed. In some cases, these people are stabbed repeatedly. Characters discover bodies covered in blood.\n\nMalcolm has a display of weapons and torture devices. The theme park also includes a “haunted house” featuring a room of wax-figure serial killers–including Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer.\n\nA character brings up Squid Games and talks about how it deserves a five-star rating. Another character mentions The Shining.\n\nIn the past, a character had been charged with assault for getting in a fight. Later, this character punches someone. Another character shares a traumatic childhood experience where a neighbor was murdered by her own father.\n\nHarper, a 15-year-old, jokes that she wants to sneak some beers.\n\nIn terms of profanity, The Island does not shrink away from using it liberally. We find 17 uses of “a–”/“a–hole”, 19 uses of “d–n”/“d–mit,” 29 uses of “h—,” six uses of “p-ss/p-ssed,” one use of “b–ch,” one use of “b—tard,” nine uses of the “s-word,” and 16 misuses of God’s name."
