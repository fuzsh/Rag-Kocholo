(Grapevine US 2012) [reissue of 1912 film]\n\nCredit Report\n\nGrace Cunard is thought to have written, directed, produced, and/or starred in over 500 films. While every attempt has been made to write a complete filmography, it is clear that the titles of many of her films have been lost. As is mentioned in the article, the Ford/Cunard partnership was usually divided, with Ford taking the directing credit and Cunard taking the writing credit. It is clear that she also codirected many of the films, though that is not reflected in her filmography. Cunard is also thought to have written, directed, and starred in the early 1920s shorts Man Hater, Gasoline Buckaroo, and Her Western Adventure although this too cannot be confirmed in AFI or Braff. The Favorite Son is incomplete. The Purple Mask, a serial she wrote, codirected, and acted in, is an interesting case. Episodes 2, 5, 11, 13, and 16 are extant, but incomplete; episodes 1, 3, 6, 9, 20, and 15 are lost. Lucille Love is another research challenge: chapter 2 is extant, but incomplete; chapters 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, and 14 are extant, and episodes 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 15 are lost.\n\nCitation\n\nBean, Jennifer M. \"Grace Cunard.\" In Jane Gaines, Radha Vatsal, and Monica Dall’Asta, eds.
