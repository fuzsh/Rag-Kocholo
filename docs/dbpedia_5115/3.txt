Infinity Broadcasting’s Outlaw Country 92.5 (WYUU, licensed to Safety Harbor, FL) found itself as the third country station in a two country station market when Clear Channel’s Thunder 103.5 (WTBT) flipped to Country as U.S. 103.5 (WFUS) on April 14, 2005.

Its call letters were soon changed to WZLL for a few days, and then again to WLZL, and the station was rebranded as “El Zol 99.1 FM”. Although a format change had been rumored to some extent for years–due to slipping ratings (22nd) in its primary market of Washington (although its ratings in Baltimore remained high)–the switch was not publicized beforehand and took many long-time fans, and even most of the station’s staff, by surprise.
