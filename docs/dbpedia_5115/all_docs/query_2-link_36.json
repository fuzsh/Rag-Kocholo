The Strand Magazine will be issued regularly in the early part of each month. It will contain stories and articles by the best British writers, and special translations from the first foreign authors. These will be illustrated by eminent artists. Special new features which have not hitherto found place in Magazine Literature will be introduced from time to time. It may be said that with the immense number of existing Monthlies there is no necessity for another. It is believed, how¬ ever, that The Strand Magazine will soon occupy a position which will justify its existence. The past efforts of the Editor in supplying cheap, healthful literature have met with such generous favour from the public, that he ventures to hope that this new enterprise will prove a popular one. He is conscious of many defects in the first issue, but will strive after improvement in the future. Will those who like this number be so good as to assist, by making its merits, if they are kind enough to think that it has any, known to their friends.

STRAND is a great deal more than Lon¬ don's most ancient and historic street : it is in many regards the most interesting street in the world. It has not, like Whitehall or the Place de la Concorde, seen the execution of a king ; it has never, like the Rue de Rivoli, been swept by grape-shot ; nor has it, like the Antwerp Place de Meir, run red with massacre. Of violent incident it has seen but little ; its interest is the interest of association and development. Thus it has been from early Plantagenet days, ever changing its aspect, growing from a river* side bridle-path to a street of palaces, and from the abiding-place of the great nobles, by whose grace the king wore his crown, to a row of shops about which there is nothing that is splendid atid little that is remark¬ able. It is not a fine street, and only here and there is it at all striking or picturesque. Rut now, as of yore, it is the high road be¬ tween the two cities—puissant London and imperial Westminster, From the days of the Edwards to this latest moment it has been the artery through which the tide of Empire has flowed. Whenever England has been victorious or has rejoiced, when¬ ever she has been in sadness or tribulation, the Strand has witnessed it all. h has been filled with the gladness of triumph, the brilliant mailed cavalcades that knew so well how to ride down Europe ; filled, too, with that historic procession which remains the high water-mark of British pageantry, in the midst of which the king came to his own again* The tide of Empire lias flowed westward along the Strand for generations which we may number but not realise, and it remains to-day the most im¬ portant, as it was once the sole, highway between the two cities. What the Strand looked like when it was edged with fields, and the road, even now not very wide, was a mere bridle-path, and a painful one at that, they who know the wilds of Connemara may best realise. From the western gate of the city of London—a small and feeble city as yet—to the West¬ minster Marshes, where already there was an abbey, and where sometimes the king held his court, was a long and toilsome journey, with the tiny village of Charing for halting-place midway. No palaces were there ; a few cabins perhaps, and footpads certainly. Such were the unpromising be¬ ginnings of the famous street which naturally gained for itself the name of Strand, because it ran along the river bank —a bank which, be it remembered, came up much closer than it does now, as we may see by the forlorn and derelict water-gate of York House, at the Embankment end of Buckingham-street Then by degrees, as the age of the Barons approached, when kings reigned by the grace of God, perhaps, but first of all by favour of the peers, the Strand began to be peopled by the salt of the earth. Then arose fair mansions, chiefly upon the southern side, giving upon the river, for the sake of the airy gardens, as well as of easy access to the stream which remained London’s great and easy highway until long after the Strand had been paved and rendered practic¬ able for wheels. It was upon the water, then, that the real pageant of London life—a fine and well-coloured pageant it must often have been—was fB dc k By water it was that UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN THE STORY OR THE STRAND * the people of the great houses went to their plots, their wooings, their gallant intrigues, to Court, or to Parliament, Also it was by water that not infrequently they went, by way of Traitor's Gate, to Tower Hill, or at least to dungeons which were only salved from being eternal by policy or expediency* This long Strand of palaces became the theatre of a vast volume of history which marked the rise and extension of some of the grandest houses that had been founded in feudal- ism r or have been built upon itsruins, Some of the fami¬ lies which lived there in power and pomp are mere memories now; hut the names of many of them are still familiar in Belgravia as once they were in the Strand. There was, to start with, the original Somerset House, more pic¬ turesque, let us hope, than the depressing mauso¬ leum which now daily reminds us that man is mortal. Then there was the famous York House, nearer to Charing Cross, of which nothing but the water-gate is left* On the op¬ posite side of the way was Burleigh House, the home of the great states¬ man who, under God and Queen Elizabeth, did such great things for England* Bur¬ leigh is one of the earliest recorded cases of a man being killed by over-work, u Ease and pleasure,” he sighed, while yet he was under fifty, “quake to hear of death ; but my life, full of cares and miseries, desireth to be dissolved.” The site of Burleigh House is kept in memory, as those of so many other of the vanished palaces of the Strand, by a street named after it ; and the office of this magazine stands no doubt upon a part of Lord Burleigh’s old garden, When Southampton House, Essex House, the Palace of the Savoy, and Northumber¬ land House, which disappeared so lately, arc added, we have still mentioned but a few of the more famous of the Strand houses* But the Strand is distinguished for a vast deal more than that. Once upon a time, it was London’s Belgravia. It was never perhaps the haunt of genius, as the Fleet- street tributaries were ; it was never an Alsatia, as Whitefriars was, nor had it the many interests of the City itself* But it had a little of all these things, and the result is that the interest of the Strand is unique. It would be easy to spend a long day in the Strand and its tributaries, search¬ ing for landmarks of other days, and visiting sites which have long been historic. But the side streets are, if anything, more in¬ teresting than the main thoroughfare, and they deserve a special and sepa¬ rate visit, when the mile or so of road - way be t ween what was Temple Bar and Charing Cross has been ex¬ hausted* Could Londoners of even only a hundred years ago see the Strand as we know it, they would be very nearly as much surprised as a Cockney under the Plantagenets, who should have re-visited his London in the time of the Georges. They who knew the picturesque but ill-kept London of the Angevin sovereigns found the Strand a place of torment. In 1353 the road was so muddy and so full of ruts that a commissioner was appointed to repair it at the expense of the frontagers* Even towards the end of Henry YHIA rcigr it was “full of pits and UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 6 THE STRAND MAGAZINE. sloughs, very perilous and noisome.” Yet it was by this miserable road that Cardinal Wolsey, with his great and stately retinue, passed daily from his house in Chancery-lane to Westminster Hall. In that respect there is nothing in the changed condition of things to regret; but we may, indeed, be sorry for this r that there is left, save in its churches, scarcely a brick of the old Strand. Still there are memories enough, and for these we may be thankful. Think only of the processions that h ave passed up from Westminster to St. Paul's, or the other way about 1 Remember that wonderful caval¬ cade amid which Charles II. rode back from his Flemish exile to the palace which had witnessed his father’s death. Nothing like it has been seen in England since. Evelyn has left us a description of the scene, which is the more dramatic for being brief: “May 29, 1660. This day His Majesty Charles II. came to London, after a sad and long exile and calamitous suffering, both of the King and Church, being seventeen years. This was also his birthday, and, with a tri¬ umph above 20,000 horse and foot, brandish¬ ing their swords and shouting with inexpressible joy; the way strew'd with flowers, the bells ringing, the streets hung with tapestry, foun¬ tains running with wine; the mayor, aldermen, and all the companies in their liveries, chains of gold, and banners ; lords and nobles dad in cloth of silver, gold, and velvet; the windows and balconies well set with ladies: trumpets, music, and myriads of people. . . . They were eight hours passing the city, even from two till ten at night.\" I stood in the Strand, and beheld it, and bless’d God.” A century earlier Elizabeth had gone in state to St. Paul’s, to return thanks for the destruction of the Armada. Next, Queen Anne went in triumph up to St. Paul’s, after Blenheim ; and, long after, the funeral processions of Nelson and Wellington were added to the list of great historic sights which the Strand has seen. The most recent of these great processions was the Prince of Wales’s progress of thanksgiving to St. Paul’s in 1872. Immediately we leave what was Temple Bar, the Strand’s memo¬ ries begin. We have made only a few steps from Temple Bar, when we come to a house—No. 217, now a branch of the London and Westminster Bank—which, after a long and respectable history, saw its owners at length overtaken by shame and ruin. It was the banking-house of Strahan, Paul & Bates, which had been founded by one Snow and his partner Walton in Cromwell's days. In the be¬ ginning the house was “ The Golden Anchor,” and Messrs. Strahan & Co. have among their archives ledgers (kept in decimals!) which go back to the time of Charles II. In 1855 it was discovered that some of the partners had been using their cus¬ tomers’ money for their own pleasures or necessities. The guilty persons all went to prison ; one of the few instances in which, as in the case of Fauntleroy, who was hanged for forgery, English bankers have been convicted of breach of trust. Adjoin¬ ing this house is that of Messrs. Twining, who opened, in 1710, the first tea-shop in London. They still deal in tea, though fine ladies jripi Iq^er go to the Eastern UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN THE STORY OF THE STRAND . 7 Strand in their carriages to drink it, out of curiosity, at a shilling a cup. One of the most interesting buildings in Essex-street, the “ Essex Head \" tavern, has only just been pulled down. There it was that Dr. Johnson founded “ Sam’s n Club, so named after the landlord, Samuel Graves, Dr, Johnson himself drew up the rules of the club, as we may see in BoswelPs 14 Life.’ 1 The chair in which he is reported to have sat was preserved in the house to the end. It is now cared for at the Cheshire Cheesein Fleet-street* A very redoubt¬ able gentleman who formerly lived in Essex-street was Dr. George Fordyce, who for twenty years drank daily with his dinner a jug of strong ale, a quarter of a pint of brandy, and a bottle of port* And he was able to lecture to his students after¬ wards ! Nearly opposite Essex-street stands one of the most famous of London landmarks— the church of St. Clement Danes. Built as recently as \\bSz f it is the successor of a far older building, Its most interesting association is with Dr* Johnson, whose pew in the north gallery is still reverently kept, and an inscription marks the spot* In this church too, it was that Miss Davies, the heiress, who brought the potentiality of un¬ told wealth into the family of the Gros- venors, was married to the progenitor of the present Duke of Westminster. St* Clement Danes is one of the few Eng¬ lish churches with a carillonj which is of course set to psalm tunes, Mil¬ ford-lane, opposite, was once really a lane with a bridge over a little stream which emptied into the Thames. Later on it marked the boundary of Arundel House, the home of the Dukes of Norfolk, who have built Arundel, Norfolk, Howard, and Sur¬ rey streets upon its site* In the time of Edward VL the Earl of Arundel bought the property for forty pounds, which would seem to have been a good bargain even for those days. In Arundel House died u old Parr,” who, ac¬ cording to the inscription upon his tomb in Westminster Abbey, lived to be 152 years old. Happily for himself he had lived all his life in Shropshire, and the brief space that he spent in London killed him* The streets that have been built upon the site of old Arundel House are full of in¬ teresting associations. The house at the south - western corner of Norfolk and Howard-streets—it is now the 41 Dysart Hotel ‘—has a very curious history. A former owner—it was some sixty years since —was about to be married. The wedding breakfast was laid out in a large room on the first floor, and all tvas ready, except the lady, who changed her mind at the last minute* The jilted bride¬ groom locked up the ban¬ quet-chamber, put the key in his pocket, and, so the THE STRAND MAGAZINE , story runs, never again allowed it to be entered. There, it was said, still stood such mouldering remains of the wedding breakfast as the rats and mice had spared. Certainly the window cur- tains could for many years be seen crumbling to pieces, bit by bit, and the windows looked exactly as one would expect the windows of the typical haunted chamber to look. It is only of late that the room has been re-opened. The name of the supposed hero of this story has often been mentioned, but, since the story may quite possibly be baseless, it would be impro¬ per to repeat it. But there is no doubt whatever that for nearl y half a century there was some- thing very queer about that upper chamber. This same filTe Howard-street was the scene, in 1692, short¬ ly after it was built, of a tragedy which remained for generations in the popular memory. It took place within two or three doors of the “ Dysart Hotel.” The central figure of the pitiful story was Mrs. Bracegirdle, the famous and beautiful actress. One of her many admirers, Cap¬ tain Richard Hill, had offered her marriage, and had been refused. But he was not to be put off in that way. If he could not obtain the lady by fair means he was determined to get her by force. He there¬ fore resolved, with the assistance of Lord Mohan—a notorious person, who was after¬ wards killed in Hyde-park in a duel with the Duke of Hamilton—to carry her off. They stationed a coach in Drury-lane, and attempted to kidnap her as she was passing down the street after the play. The lady’s screams drew such a crowd that the abductors were forced to bid their men let her go. They escorted her home (a sufficient¬ ly odd proceeding in the circum¬ stances), and then remained outside Mrs. Bracegirdle's house in Howard- street vowing re¬ venge,” the con- temporary ac¬ counts say, but against whom is not clear. Hill and Lord Mohun drank a bottle of wine in the middle of the street, per¬ haps to keep their courage up, and presently Mr. Will Mountfort, an ac¬ tor, who lived in Norfolk-street, came along. Mountfort had al¬ ready heard what had happened, and he at once went up to Lord Mohun (who, it is said, 41 embraced him very tenderly ,h ), and reproached him with li justify¬ ing the rudeness of Captain Hill,” and with (i keeping company with such a pitiful fellow.” u And then, 11 according to the Captain’s servant, the Captain came forward and said he would justify himself, and went towards the middle of the street and drew,” Some of the eye-witnesses said that they fought, but others declared that Hill ran Mountfort through the body before he could draw his sword! At all events, Hill instantly ran away, and when the watch arrived they found only Lord Mohun, who surrendered himself. He seems to have had no part in the murder, and his sword was still sheathed when he was made prjso^r. It is said that UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN THE STOR Y OF THE STRAND, 9 Hill already had a grudge against Mount- fort, whom he suspected of being Mrs. Bracegirdle's favoured lover. But the best contemporary evidence agrees that the lady’s virtue was 11 as impregnable as the rock of Gibraltar.” Nearly opposite the scene of this brutal tragedy, the church of St. Mary-le-Strand was built some five-and-twenty years later. It is a picturesque building, and makes a striking appearance when approached from the west. It has of late been more than once proposed that it should be demolished, at once by reason of the obstruction which it causes in the roadway, and because of its ill-repair. But since it has now been put into good condition, the people who would so gaily pull down a church to widen a road will perhaps not be again heard from. According toHume, PrinceCharles Edward, during his famous stolen visit to London, formally renounced in this church the Roman Catholic religion, to strengthen his claim to the throne ; but there has never been any manner of proof of that state¬ ment. The site of St. Mary-le-Strand was long famous as the spot upon which the Westminster maypole stood, and what is now Newcastle-street was called Maypole- lane down to the beginning of the present century. At the Restoration, a new may- pole, 134 feet high, was set up, the Crom- wellians having destroyed the old one, in the presence of the King and the Duke of York. The pole is said to have been spliced together with iron bands by a blacksmith named John Clarges, whose daughter Anne married General Monk, who, for his services in bringing about the Restoration, was created Duke of Albemarle. Three or four suits were brought to prove that her first husband was still living when she married the Duke, and that consequently the second (and last) Duke of Albemarle was illegi¬ timate, but the blacksmith’s daughter gained them all. Near the Olympic Theatre there still exists a Maypole-alley. It is hardly necessary to say that the present Somerset House, which is exactly opposite the church of St. Mary-le-Strand, is not the original building of that name. People—praise to their taste!—did not build in that fashion in the time of the TudoTs, The old house, built by not the cleanest means, by the Protector Somerset, was “ such a palace as had not been seen in England.” After Somerset’s attainder it became the recognised Dower House of the English Queens. It was built with the materials of churches and other people’s houses. John of Padua was the architect, and it was a sumptuous palace indeed ; but if Somerset ever lived in it, it was for a very brief space. One of the accusations upon which he was attainted was that he had spent money in building Somerset House, but had allowed the King’s soldiers to go unpaid. It was close to the Water Gate of Somerset House that the mysterious murder of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey took place in 1678. The story of the murder is so doubt¬ ful and complicated that it is impossible to enter upon it here. Sir Edmundbury was induced to go to the spot where he was strangled under the pretence that, as a justice of the peace, he could stop a quarrel that was going on. Titus Oates, the most finished scoundrel ever born on British soil, io THE STRAND MAGAZINE, suggested that the Jesuits and even Queen Henrietta Maria were concerned in instigat¬ ing the murder, and three men were hung at Tyburn for their supposed share in it. Around the Somerset House of that day there were extensive gardens of that square formal fashion which, although pleasing enough to the antiquary, are anathema to the artistic eye. Old Somerset House was demolished in the early days of George III., and the present building, of which Sir Wm. Chambers was the architect, was com¬ menced in 1776. Another interesting bit of the southern side of the Strand is the region still called The Savoy. The old Palace of the Savoy was built by Simon de Montfort, but it afterwards passed to Peter of Savoy, uncle of Queen Eleanor, who gave to the precinct the name which was to become historical. There it was that King John of France was housed after he was taken prisoner at Poictiers ; and there too he died. The Palace of the Savoy was set on fire and plundered by Wat Tyler and his men in 1381. It was rebuilt and turned into a hospital by Henry VII. In the new building the liturgy of the Church of England was revised after the restora¬ tion of Charles II. ; but the most interesting association of the place must always be that there Chaucer wrote a portion of the “ Canterbury Tales,” and that John of Ghent lived there. After many vicissitudes and long ruin and neglect, the last remains of the Palace and Hospital of the Savoy were demolished at the beginning of the present century, to permit of a better approach to Waterloo Bridge, A little farther west, in Beaufort-build- ings, Fielding once resided. A contempo¬ rary tells how he was once hard put to it to pay the parochial taxes for this house. The tax-collector at last lost patience, and Fielding was compelled to obtain an advance from Jacob Tonson, the'famous publisher, ivhose shop stood upon a portion of the site of Somerset House. He returned home with ten or twelve guineas in his pocket, but meeting at his own door an old college chum who had fallen upon evil times, he emptied his pockets, and was unable to satisfy the tax-gatherer until he had paid a second visit to the kindly and accommodat¬ ing Tonson. Another of the great Strand palaces stood on this site—Worcester House, which, after being the residence of the Bishops of Carlisle, became the town house of the Earls of Worcester. Almost adjoining stood Salisbury, or Cecil House, which was built by Robert Cecil, first Earl of Salisbury, a son of the sage Lord Burgh ley, whose town house stood on the opposite side of the Strand. It was pulled down more than two hundred years ago, after a very brief existence, and Cecil and Salisbury streets were built upon its site. Yet another Strand palace, Durham House, the ” inn \" of the Bishops Palatine of Durham, stood a little nearer to Charing Cross. It was of great antiquity, and was rebuilt as long ago as 1345. Henry VIII. obtained it by exchange, and Queen Elizabeth gave it to Sir Walter Raleigh. The most interesting event that ever took place in the house was the marriage of Ladv Jane Grey to Lord Guildford Dudley, Eight weeks later she was proclaimed Queen, to her sorrow. Still nearer to Charing Cross, and upon a portion of the site of Durham House, is the famous bank of the Messrs. Coutts, one of the oldest of the London banks. The original Coutts was a shrewd Scotchman, who, by his wit and enterprise, speedily became rich and famous. He married one of his brother's domestic servants, and of that marriage, which turned out very happily, Lady Rurdelt'Coutts is a grandchild. Mr. Coutts' second wife was Miss Harriet Mellon, a dis¬ tinguished actres., of her day, to whom he UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN COUTTS 1 BANKING HOUSE, 1853 I FROM A DRAWING BY T. HOSJufcR SHEPHERD, THE STOR Y OF THE STRAND. ii left the whole of his fortune of ^00,000. When the lady, who afterwards became Duchess of St. Albans, died in the year of the Oueen’s accession, that^\"400,000 formed the foundation of the great fortune of Miss Angela Burdett, better known to this generation as Lady Burdett-Coutts. Messrs. Courts’ banking-house is an interesting building, with many portraits of the early friends and customers of the house, which included Dr. Johnson and Sir Walter Scott. The cellars of the firm are re¬ puted to be full of boxes containing coronets and patents of nobility. Upon another part of the site of Durham House the brothers Adam built, in 1768, the region called the Adelphi. There, in the centre house of Adelphi- terrace, with its wondrous view up and down the river, died in 1779 David Garrick, Buckingham-street and Villiers-street, which lie between the Adelphi and Charing Cross Station, carry their history, like so many other of the Strand tributaries, written in their names. They recall the long-vanished glories of Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, who lived at York House, so called as having been the town palace of the Archbishops of York. Wolsey lived there for a time ; Bacon was living there when he was de¬ graded. The Crown granted it to George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, by whom it was splen¬ didly rebuilt. The second Duke sold it to pay his debts, making it a condi¬ tion that he should be commemorated in the names of the streets placed on the site—George, Villiers, Duke, and Bucking¬ ham streets. The onlv remaining relic of York House is the fine water-gate at the bottom of Bucking, ham-street. Close to this water-gate, in a house marked by a Society of Arts tablet, for a short time lived Peter the Great; op¬ posite lived Samuel Pepys ; and No. 14 was occupied by Etty. In Villiers- street both Evelyn and Steele lived ; but it is now the haunt of anything rather than genius. North¬ umberland House, the last and best known of the river¬ side palaces, which was demolished only fo at the end of 1874, m UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 12 THE STRAND MAGAZINE . was not, properly speaking, in the Strand at all. It may therefore be sufficient to recall that it was built in 1605, and became the home of the Percies in 1642. It was sold to the Metropolitan Board of Works, with great and natural reluctance, for half a million of money ; and the famous blue lion of the Percies, which for so long stood proudly over the building, was removed to Sion House. The northern side of the Strand is not quite so rich in memories as the side which faced the river, but its associations with Lord Burleigh, that calm, sagacious, and untiring statesman, must always make it memorable, Burleigh House, the site of which is marked by Burleigh and Exeter- streets, was the house from which he governed England with conspicuous courage^ devotion, and address. There, too, he was visited by Queen Elizabeth* According to tradition she wore, on that occasion, the notorious pyramidal head-dress which she made fashionable, and was besought by an esquire in attendance to stoop as she entered. \" For your master’s sake I will stoop, but not for the King of Spain,'* was the answer which might ha^ee been expected from a daughter of Henry Till. Lord Burleigh lived there in considerable state, spending thirty pounds a week, which in Elizabethan days was enormous. There, broken with work and anxiety, he died in 1 sq 8. When his son was made Earl of Exeter he called it Exeter House, This historical house was not long in falling upon evil days. By the be¬ ginning of the eighteenth century a pari of it had been demolished, while another part was altered and turned into shops, the new building being christened \" Exeter Change,\" Nearer to nur own time the \"Change\" be¬ came a kind of arcade, the upper floor being used as a wild-beast show. When it was \" Pidcock’s Exhibition of Wild Beasts’ 1 an imitation Beef-eater stood outside, in the Strand, inviting the cock¬ ney and his country cousin to \" walk upT The roaring of the animals is said to have often frightened horses in the Strand. “ Exeter Change \" was the home of u Chunee,” an elephant as famous in his generation—it was more than sixty years since—as \" Jumbo \"in our own. 11 Chunee,” which weighed five tons, and was eleven feet high, at last became unmanage¬ able, and was shot by a file of soldiers, who fired 1^2 bullets into his body before killing him. His skeleton is still in the Museum of the College of Surgeons, in Lincoln Vi oil¬ fields. It should be remembered that in Exeter-street Dr. Johnson lodged (at a cost of 4+d, per day) when he began his struggle in London. A little farther east once stood Wimbledon House, built some three cen¬ turies ago by Sir Edward Cecil, Viscount Wimbledon, a cadet of the great house founded by Lord Burleigh. Stow records that the house was burned down in 162S, the day MgtrWl ^qiflental explosion UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN THE STOR Y OF THE STRAND. 13 of gunpowder demolished the owner’s country seat at Wimbledon, Nearly all the land hereabouts still belongs to the Cecils. Upon a portion of the site of Wimbledon House arose the once famous “ D’Oyley’s Warehouse,\" where a French refugee sold a variety of silk and woollen fabrics, which were quite new to the Eng¬ lish market. He achieved great success, and a 11 D'Oyley ” is still as much a part of the language as an “antimacassar\"—that abomination of all desolation. The shop lasted, at 346, Strand, until some thirty years ago. The Lyceum Theatre, which also stands upon a piece of the site of Exeter House, occupies the spot where Madame Tussaud’s waxworks were first exhibited in 1802.

From the days of feudal fortresses to those of penny newspapers is a far cry ; and of all that lies between it has been the witness. If its stones be not historic, at least its sites and its memories arc ; and still it remains, what it ever has been, the most characteristic and distinctive of Eng¬ lish highways. Original from UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN A Deadly Dilemma. By Grant Allen. HEN Netta Mayne came to think it over afterward in her own room by herself, she couldn't imagine what had made her silly enough to quarrel that evening with Ughtred Carnegie. She could only say, in a penitent mood, it was always the way like that with lovers. Till once they've quar¬ relled a good round quarrel, and afterwards solemnly kissed and made it all up again, things never stand on a really firm and settled basis between them. It ! s a move in the game. You must thrust in tierce before you thrust in quarte. The Roman play¬ wright spoke the truth, after all: a lovers' quarrel be¬ gins a fresh chapter in the history of their love-making. It was a summer evening, calm, and clear, and balmy, and Netta and Ughtred had strol¬ led out together, not without a sus¬ picion at times of hand locked in hand, on the high chalk down that rises steep behind Holmbury. How or why they fell out she hardly knew. But they had been engaged already some months, without a single disagree¬ ment, which of course gave Netta a natural right to quarrel with Ughtred by this time, if she thought fit: and as they returned down the Digitized by Google hanging path through the combe where the wild orchids grow, she used that right at last, out of pure unadulterated feminine perversity* The ways of women are won* derful ; no mere man can fathom them* Something that Ughtred said gave her the chance to make a half petulant answer, Ughtred very naturally defended himself from the imputation of rudeness* and Netta retorted. At the end of ten minutes the trifle had grown apace into as pretty a lovers* quarrel as any lady novelist could wish to describe in five chapters. Netta had burst into perfectly orthodox tears, refused to be com¬ forted, in the most approved fashion, declined to accept Ughtred J s escort home, and bidden farewell to him excitedly for ever and ever* [t was all about nothing, to be sure, and if two older or wiser heads had only stood by un¬ seen, to view the little comedy, they would sagely have remarked to one another, with a shake, that before twenty-four hours were out the pair would be rushing into one another’s arms with mutual apologies and mutual forgive¬ ness, But Netta Mayne and Ugh¬ tred Carnegie were still at the age when one takes love seriously—one does before thirty—and so they turned away Original from UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN A DEADL Y DILEMMA. 15 along different paths at the bottom of the combe, in the firm belief that love's young dream was shattered, and that henceforth Lhey two were nothing more than the merest acquaintances to one another. “ Good-bye, Mr. Carnegie,\" Netta faltered out, as in obedience to her wishes, though much against his own will, Ughtred turned slowly and remorsefully down the footpath to the right, in the direction of the railway. “ Good-bye, Netta,” Ughtred answered, half choking. Even at that moment of parting (for ever—or a day), he couldn't find it in his heart to call her “ Miss Mayne \" who had so long been “ Netta ’’ to him. He waved his hand and turned along the foot-path, looking back many times to see Netta still sitting inconsolable where he had left her, on the stile that led from the combe into the Four-acre meadow. Both paths, to right and left, led back to Holmbury over the open field, but they diverged rapidly, and crossed the railway track by separate gates, and five hundred yards from each other. A turn in the path, at which Ughtred lingered long, hid Netta at last from his sight. He paused and hesitated. It was growing late, though an hour of summer twilight still remained. He couldn't bear to leave Netta thus alone in the field. She wouldn't allow him to see her home, to be sure, and that being so, he was too much a gentleman to force himself upon her. But he was too much a man, too, to let her find her way back so late entirely by herself. Unseen himself, he must still watch over her. Against her wall, he must still protect her, He would go on to the railway, and there sit by the side of the line, under cover of the hedge, till Netta crossed by the other path. Then he’d walk quietly along the six-foot way to the gate she had passed through, and follow her, unperceived, at a distance along the lane, till he saw her back to Holmbury. Whether she wished it or not he could never leave her. He looked about for a seat. One lay most handy. By the side of the line the Government engineers had been at work that day, repairing the telegraph system, They had taken down half a dozen mould¬ ering old posts, and set up new ones in their place—tall, clean, and shiny. One of the old posts still lay at full length on the ground by the gate, just as the men had left it at the end of their day's work. At the point where the footpath cut the line, was a level crossing, and there Ughtred sat down on the fallen post by the side, half- concealed from view by a tall clump of willow-herb, waiting patiently for Netta’s coming. How he listened for that light footfall. His heart was full, indeed, of gall and bitterness. He loved her so dearly, and she had treated him so ill. Who would ever have believed that Netta, his Netta, would have thrown him'over like that for “ NETTA WAS STILL SITTING INCONSOLABLE.” such a ridiculous trifle? Who, indeed? and least of all Netta herself, sitting alone on the stile with her pretty face bowed deep in her hands, and her poor heart wondering how Ughtred, her Ughtred, could so easily desert her. In such strange ways is the feminine variety of the human heart constructed. To be sure, she had of course dismissed him in the most per¬ emptory fash ion, declaring with all the vows propriety permits to the British maiden, that she neede^J no escort of any sort home, and UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, 16 that she would tun thousand times rather go alone than have him accompany her. But, of course, also, she didn't mean it. What woman does ? She counted upon a prompt and unconditional surrender. Ughtred would go to the corner, as in duty bound, and then come back to her, with profuse expressions of penitence for the wrong he had never done, to make it all up again in the orthodox fashion. She never intended the real tragedy that was so soon to follow. She was only playing with her victim—only trying, woman-like, her power over Ughtred. So she sat there still, and cried and cried on, minute after minute, in an ecstasy of misery, till the sunset began to glow deeper red in the western sky, and the bell to ring the curfew in Holmbury Tower. Then it dawned upon her slowly, with a shock of surprise, that after all—incredible ! impossible !—Ughtred had positively taken her at her word, and wasn’t coming back at all to-night to her. At that, the usual womanly terror seized upon her soul. Her heart turned faint. This was too terrible. Great heavens, what had she done ? Had she tried Ugh¬ tred too far, and had he really gone ? Was he never going to return to her at all ? Had he said gond-bye in earnest to her for ever and ever ? Terrified at the thought, and weak with crying, she rose and straggled down the narrow footpath toward the further crossing. It was getting late now, anti Netta by this time was really frightened. She wished with all her heart she hadn’t sent away Ughtred—if it were only for the tramps: a man is such a com¬ fort. And then there was that dreadful dog at Milton Court to pass. And Ughtred was gone, and all the world was desolate. Thinking these things in a tumult of fear to herself, she staggered along the path, feeling tired at heart, and positively ill with remorse and terror. The colour had faded now out of her pretty red cheeks. Her eyes were dim and swollen with cry¬ ing. She was almost half glad Ughtred couldn’t see her just then, she was such a fright with her long spell of brooding. Even her bright print dress and her straw hat with the poppies in it, couldn’t redeem, she felt sure. her pallor and her wretchedness. But Ugh¬ tred was gone, and the world was a wilderness. And he would never come back, and the dog at Milton Court was so vicioifi. As she walked, or rather groped her way (for she couldn't see for crying) down the path by the hedge, at every step she grew fainter and fainter, Ughtred was gone; and the world was a blank ; and there were tramps and dogs ; and it was getting dark ; and she loved him so much ; and Mamma would be so angry, Turning over which thoughts with a whirling brain, for she was but a girl after all, she reached the little swing-gate Uiai led to the railway, and pushed it aside with vague numbed hands, and stood gazing vacantly at the long curved line in fronL of her, \" SHE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN A DEADLY DILEMMA, 17 Suddenly, a noise rose sharp in the field behind her. It was only a colt, to be sure, disturbed by her approach, dashing wildly across his paddock, a> is the way with young horseflesh, But to Nett a it came as an indefinite terror, magnified ten thousand fold by her excited feelings. She made a frenzied dash for the other side of the railway. What it was she knew not, but it was, or might be, anything, every¬ thing— mad bulls, <f IT WAS A TEAKthLE IttSiTlQlG 1 ' drunken men, footpads, vagabonds, mur¬ derers. Oh, how could light red ever have taken her at her word, and left her like this, alone, and in the evening? It was cruel, it was wicked of him ; she hated to be disloyal, and yet she felt in her heart it was almost unmanly. As she rushed along wildly, at the top of her speed, her little foot caught on the first rail. Before she knew what had happened, she had fallen with her body right across the line. Faint and terrified already, with a thousand vague alarms, the sudden shock stunned and disabled her. Mad bull or drunken man, they might do as they liked now. She was bruised and shaken. She had no thought left to rise or recover her¬ self. Her eyes closed heavily. She lost consciousness at once. It was a terrible position. She had fainted on the line, with the force of the situation. Digitized by CiOGQIC - ' o As for Ughtred, from his seat on the telegraph post on the side of the line five hundred yards farther up, he saw her pause by the gate, then dash across the road, then stumble and trip, then fall heavily forward. His heart came up into his mouth at once at the sight. Oh, thank heaven he had waited. Thank heaven he was near. She had fallen across the line, and a train might come along before she could rise up again. She seemed hurt, too. In a frenzy of suspense he darted forward to save her. It took but a second for him to realise that she had fallen, and was seriously hurt, but in the course of that second, even as he realised it all, another and more pressing terror seized him. Hark ! what was that ? He listened and thrilled. Oh no, too terrible. Yes, yes, it must be—the railway, the railway ! He knew it. He felt it. Along the up line, on which Netta was lying, he heard behind him—oh, unmistakable, unthinkable, the fierce whirr of the express dashing madly down upon him. Great heavens, what could he do ? The train was coming, the train was almost this moment upon them. Before he could have time to rush wildly forward and snatch Netta from where she lay, full in its path, a helpless weight, it would have swept past him resistlessly, and borne down upon her like lightning. The express was coming—to crush Netta to pieces. In these awful moments men don’t think : they don’t reason ; they don't even realise what their action means ; they simply act, and act instinctively. Ughtred felt in a second, without even consciously feeling it, so to speak, that any attempt to reach Netta now before that devouring engine had burst upon her at full speed would be absolutely hopeless. His one chance lay in stopping the train somehow. How, or where, or with what, he cared not. His own body would do it if nothing else came. Only stop it, stop it. He didn't think of it at all that moment as a set of carriages containing a precious freight of human lives. He thought of it only as a horrible, cruel, devouring creature, rushing headway on at full speed to Netta’s destruction. It was a senseless wild beast, to be combated at all hazards. It was a hideous, ruthless, relentless thing, to be checked in its mad career in no matter Jrigmal from UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN THE STRAND MAGAZINE. 18 what fashion. All he knew, indeed, was that Netta, his Netta, lay helpless on the track, and that the engine, like some mad* man, puffing and snorting with wild glee and savage exultation, was hastening forward with fierce strides to crush and mangle her. At any risk he must stop it—with any¬ thing—\"anyhow. As he gazed around him, horror-struck, with blank inquiring stare, and with this one fixed idea possessing his whole soul, Ughtred's eye happened to fall upon the dismantled telegraph post, on which but one minute before he had been sitting. The sight inspired him. Ha, ha ! a glorious chance. He could lift it on the line. He could lay it across the rails. He could turn it round into place. He could upset the train ! He could place it in the way of that murderous engine. No sooner thought than done. With the wild energy of despair, the young man lifted the small end of the ponderous post bodily up in his arms, and twisting it on the big base as on an earth-fast pivot, managed, by main force and with a violent effort, to lay it at last full in front of the advancing locomotive. How he did it he never rightly knew himself, for the weight of the great balk was simply enormous. But horror and love, and the awful idea that Netta's life was at stake, seemed to supply him at once with unwonted energy. He lifted it in his arms as he would have lifted a ^ child, and straining in every limb stretched it at last full across both rails, a formidable obstacle before the approaching engine. Hurrah ! hurrah ! he had succeeded now. It would throw the train off the line—and Netta would be saved for him. To think and do all this under the spur of the circumstances took ' Ughtred something less than twenty seconds. In a great crisis men live rapidly. It was quick as thought. And at the end of it all, he saw the big log laid right across the line with infinite satisfaction. Such a splendid obstacle that—so round and heavy ! It must throw the train dean off the metals! It must produce a fine first-class catastrophe, As he thought it, half Diqilizcd by v r GO QIC 3 ' o aloud, a sharp curve brought the train round the corner close to where he stood, great drops of sweat now oozing clammily from every pore with his exertion. He looked at it languidly, with some vague, dim sense of a duty accomplished, and a great work well done for Netta and humanity. There would be a real live accident in a moment now—a splendid accident—a first-rate catastrophe ! Great heavens ! An accident ! And then, with a sudden burst of inspira¬ tion. the other side of the transaction flashed in one electric spark upon Ughtred T s brain. Why—this—was murder ! There were people in that train—innocent human beings, men and women like himself, who would next minute be wrecked and mangled corpses, or writhing forms, on the track before him ! He was guilty of a crime— an awful crime. He was trying to produce a terrible, ghastly, bloody railway accident! Till that second, the idea had never even so much as , occurred to ' wnut n throw wjjriqwfibfrow? UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN A DEADL Y DILEMMA, 19 him. In the first wil.! flush of horror at Netta’s situation, he had thought of nothing except how best to save her. He had regarded the engine only as a hateful, cruel, destruc¬ tive living being. He had f0r- gotten the pas- senders, the stoker, the officials. He had been conscious only of Netta and of that awful thing, breathing flame and steam, that was rushing on to destroy her. For ano¬ ther indivisible second of lime Ughtred Car¬ negie's soul was the theatre of a terrible and ap¬ palling struggle, What on earth was he to do? Which of the two was he to sacrifice? Should it be murder or treachery? Must he wreck the train or let it mangle Netta ? The sweat stood upon his brow in great clammy drops, at that dread dilemma. It was an awful question for any man to solve. He shrank aghast before that deadly decision. They were innocent, to be sure, the people in that train. They were unknown men, women, and children. They had the same right to their lives as Netta herself. It w r as crime, sheer crime, thus to seek to destroy them. But still—what would you have ? Netta lay there all helpless on the line —his own dear Netta. And she had parted from him in anger but half an hour since. Could he leave her to be destroyed by that hideous, snorting, puffing thing? Has not any man the right to try and save the lives he loves best, no matter at what risk or peril to others ? He asked himself this question, too, vaguely, instinctively, with the rapid haste of a life-and-death struggle, asked himself with horror, for he had no strength left now to do one thing or the other —to remove the obstacle from the place where he had laid it or to warn the driver. One second alone remained and then all would be over. On it came, roaring, flaring, glaring, with its great bulls' eyes now peering red round the corner—a terrible, fiery dragon, resistless, unconscious^ bearing THE JJRIVLK S HEART *TOOU STILL WITH TERROR. down in mad glee upon the pole—or Netta. Which of the two should it be—the pole or Netta ? And still he waited ; and still he tempor¬ ise d. What, what could he do? Oh heaven! be merciful. Even as the engine swept, snorting and puffing steam round the cor¬ ner, he doubted yet—he doubted and temporised. He reasoned with his own conscience in the quick short¬ hand of thought. So far as intent was concerned he was guiltless. It wouldn’t be a murder of malice prepense. When he laid that log there hi the way of the train, he never believed—nay, never even knew —it was a train with a living freight of men and women he was trying to imperil. He felt to it merely as a mad engine un* attached. He realised only Netta's pressing danger. Was he bound now to undo what he had innocently done—and leave Netta to perish ? Must he take away the post and be Netta’s murderer ? It was a cruel dilemma for any man to have to face. If he had half an hour to debate and decide, now, he might perhaps have seen his way a little clearer. But with that hideous thing actually rushing red and wrathful on his sight—why—he clapped his hands to his ears. It was too much for him*—too much for him. And yet he must face it, and act, or remain passive, one way or the other. With a desperate effort he made up his mind at last just as the train burst upon him, and all was over. He made up his mind and acted accord¬ ingly. As the engine turned the corner, the driver, looking ahead in the clear evening light, saw something in front that made him start with sudden horror and alarm. A telegraph pole lay stretched at full length,and a man, unknown, stood agonised by its side, as he thought to .^'?5FMkfer no limelrft 20 THE STRAND MAGAZINE. to stop her now ; no time to avei t the threatened catastrophe. All the driver could do in his haste was to put the brake on hard and endeavour to lessen the force of the inevitable concussion. But even as he looked anil wondered at the sight, putting on the brake, meanwhile, with all his might and main, he saw the man in front perform, to his surprise, a heroic action. Rushing full upon the line, straight before the very lights of the advancing train, the man unknown lifted up the pole by main force, and brandishing its end, as it were, wildly in the driver’s face, hurled the huge balk back with a terrible effort to the side of the railway. It fell with a crash, and the man fell with it. There was a second’s pause, while the driver’s heart stood still with terror. Then a jar—a thud—a deep scratch into the soil. A wheel was off the line ; they had met with an accident. For a moment or two the driver only knew that he was shaken and hurt, but not severely. The engine had left tfte track, and the carriages lay behind slightly shattered. He , could see how it happened. Part of the pole in falling had re¬ bounded on to the line. The base of the great timber had struck the near-side wheel, and sent it off the track in a vain effort to surmount it. But the brake had already slack¬ ened the pace and broken the force of the shock, so the visible damage was very inconsiderable. They must look along the carriages and find out who was hurt. And above all things, what had become of the man who had so nobly rescued them ? For the very last thing the engine-driver had seen of Ughtred as the train stopped short was that the man who flung the pole from the track before the advancing engine was knocked down by its approach, while the train to all appearance passed bodily over him. For good or evil, Ughtred had made his decision at last at the risk of his own life. As the train dashed on, with its living freight aboard, his native instinct of preserving life got the better of him in spite of himself. He couldn’t let those innocent souls die by his own act-though if he removed the pole, and Netta was killed, he didn’t know him¬ self how he could ever outlive it. He prayed with all his heart that the train might kill him. The guard and the driver ran hastily along the train. Nobody was hurt, though many were shaken or slightly bruised. Even the carriages had escaped with a few small cracks. The Holmbury smash was nothing very serious. But the man with the pole ? Their pre¬ server, their friend.. Where was he all this time ? What on earth had become of him ? They looked along the line. They searched the track in vain. He had disap¬ peared as if by magic. Not a trace could be found of him. After looking long and uselessly, again and again, the guard and the driver both gave it up. They had seen the man dis¬ tinctly—not a doubt about that—and so had several of the passen¬ gers as well. But no sign of blood was to be discovered along the t rack. The mysterious being who, as they all believed, risked his own life to save theirs, had THE HOLMBURY SMASH, vanished as he had come, one might almost say by a miracle. And itiue'ca, as a matter of fact, when UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN A DEADL F DILEMMA, 21 Ughtred Carnegie fell on the track before the advancing engine, he thought for a moment it was all up with him. He was glad of that, too ; for he had murdered Netta, He had saved the train ; but he had murdered Netta. It would dash on, now, unresisted, and crush his darling to death. It was better be should die, having murdered Netta. So he closed his eyes tight and waited for it to kill him. Hut the train passed on, jarring and scraping, partly with the action of the brake, though partly, too, with the wheel digging into the ground.at the side ; it passed on and went over him altogether, coming, as it did so, to a sudden standstill. As it stopped, a fierce joy rose uppermost in Ughtred’s soul. Thank heaven, all was well. He breathed once more easily. lie had fallen on his back across the sleepers in the middle of the track. It was hot really the train that had knocked him down at all, but the recoil of the telegraph post. The engine and carriages had gone over him safely. He wasn’t seriously hurt. He was only bruised, and sprained, and jarred, and shaken. Rising up behind the train as it slackened, he ran hastily along on the offside, towards where Netta lay still unconscious on the line in front of it. Nobody saw him run past ; and no wonder either, for every eye was turned toward the near side and the ob¬ struction. A person running fast by the opposite windows was very little likely to attract attention at such a moment. Every step pained him, to be sure, for he was bruised and stiff; but he ran on none the less till he came up at last to where Netta lay. There, he bent over her eagerly. Netta raised her head, opened her eyes, and looked. In a moment the vague sense of a terrible catastrophe averted came somehow over her. She flung her arms round his neck. “ Oh, Ughtred, you’ve come back !” she cried in a torrent of emotion. “ Yes, darling,” Ughtred answered, his voice half choked with tears. w I’ve come back to you now, for ever and ever.” He lifted her in his arms, and carried her some little way off up the left-hand path. His heart was very full. ’Twas a terrible moment. For as yet he hardly knew what harm he might have done by his fatal act. He only knew he had tried his best to undo the wrong he had half unconsciously wrought; and if the worst came, he would give himself up now like a man to offended justice. But the worst did not come. Blind fate had been merciful. Next day the papers were full of the accident to the Great Southern Express ; equally divided between denunciation of the miscreant who had placed the obstruction in the way of the train, and admiration for the heroic, but unrecognisable stranger who had rescued from death so many helpless passengers at so imminent a risk to his own life or safety. Only Ughtred knew that the two were one and the same person. And when Ughtred found out how little harm had been done by his infatuated act—an act he felt he could never possibly explain in its true light to any other person—he thought it wisest on the whole to lay no claim to eitheT the praise or the censure. The world could never be made to understand the terrible dilemma in which he was placed—the one¬ sided way in which the problem at first pre¬ sented itself to him—the deadly struggle through which he had passed be¬ fore he could make up his mind, at the risk of Netta's life, to remove the ob¬ stacle. Only Netta under¬ stood ; and even Netta herself knew no more than this, that Ughtred had risked his own life to save her.

Fire!\" This startling cry aroused me one night as I was putting the finishing touches to sonic literary work. Rushing, pen in hand, to the window, I could just perceive a dull red glare in the northern sky, which, even as T gazed, became more vivid, and threw some chimneys near at hand into strong relief. A fire undoubt¬ edly, and not far distant! The street, usually so quiet at night, had suddenly awakened. The alarm which had reached me had aroused my neighbours on each side of the way, and every house was captain rhaw. 11 well alight 11 in a short space of time, Doors were flung open, windows raised t white forms were visible at the casements, and curiosity was rife. Many men and some venturesome women quitted their houses, and proceeded in the direction of the glare, which was momentarily increasing, the glow on the clouds waxing and waning according as the flames shot up or temporarily died down, “ Where is it ? T1 people ask in a quick, panting way, as they hurry along. No one can say for certain* But just as we think it must be in Westminster, we come in sight Digitized by Google of a huge column of smoke, and turning a corner are within view of the emporium— a tall* six-storied block, stored with inflam¬ mable commodities* and blazing fiercely. Next door, or rather ihe next warehouse, is not yet affected. The scene is weird and striking ; the intense glare, the shooting flames which dart viciously out and upwards, the white and red faces of the crowd kept back by the busy police, the puff and clank of the en¬ gines, the rushing and hissing of the water, the roar of the fire, and the columns of smoke which in heavy sulky masses hung gloating over the blazing building. The bright helmets of the firemen are glinting everywhere, close to the already tottering wall, on the summit of the adjacent build¬ ings, which are already smoking. Lost on ladders, amid smoke, they pour a torrent of water on the burning and seething premises. Above all the monotonous “ puff, puff TT of the steameT is heai d, and a buzz of admira¬ tion ascends from the attentive, silent crowd. Suddenly arises a yell—a wild, unearthly cry T which almost makes one’s blood run cold even in that atmosphere. A tremor seizes us as a female form appears at an upper window, framed in flame, curtained with smoke and noxious fumes. “ Save her ! Save her ! \" The crowd sways and surges ; women scream ; strong men clench their hands and swear—Heaven only knows why* But be¬ fore the police have headed back the people the escape is on the spot, two men are on it, one outstrips his mate, and darting up the ladder, leaps into the open window. He is swallowed up in a moment—lost to our sight. Will he ever return out of that fiery furnace ? Yes, here he is, bearing a senseless female form, which he passes out to his mate, who is calmly watching his progress, though the ladder is in imminent danger. Quick ! The flames approach ! The man on the ladder does not wait as his mate again disappears and emerges with a child about fourteen. Carrying this burthen easily, he descends the ladder. The first man is already flying down the escape, head-first, holding the woman’s dress round her feet. The others, rescuer and rescued, follow. The ladder is withdrawn, burning.

More engines gallop up. “The Captain ” is on the spot, too. The Brigade is victorious. In the early morning hour, as I strolled home deep in thought, I determined to see these men who nightly risk their lives and stalwart limbs for the benefit and preserva¬ tion of helpless fire-scorched people. Who are these men who go literally through fire and water to assist and save their fellow creatures, strangers to them—unknown, save in that they require help and succour ? I determined there and then to see these brave fellows in their daily work, or leisure in their homes, amid all the surroundings of their noble calling. I went accompanied by an artistic friend, to whose efforts the illustrations which accompany this record are due. Emerging from Queen-street, we find ourselves upon Southwark Bridge, and we at once plunge into a flood of memories of old friends who come, invisibly, to accompany us on our pilgrimage to old Winchester House, now the head-quarters of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, in the Southwark Bridge-road. On the bridge— once a “ tolled ” struc¬ ture known as the Iron Bridge—we find “ Little Dorrit ” her¬ self, and her suitor, young John Chivery, in all his brave attire ; the young aspirant is downhearted at the decided refusal of Miss Amy to marry him, as they pace the then almost unfrequented bridge. Their ghosts cross it in our com¬ pany, with Clennan and Maggie behind us, till we reach the Union-road, once known as Horsemon- ger-lane, where young John’s ghost quits us to meditate in the back yard of Mr. Chivery’s premises, and become that “broken-down ruin,” catching cold beneath the family washing, which he feared, The whole neighbourhood is redolent of Dickens. From a spot close by the head office we can see the buildings which have been erected on the site of the King’s Bench Prison, where Air. Micawber waited for something to turn up, and where Copperfield lost his box and money. The site of the former “ haven of domestic tran¬ quillity and peace of mind,\" as Micawber styled it, is indicated to us by Mr. Harman —quite a suitable name in such a connec¬ tion with Dickens—by whom we are cour¬ teously and pleasantly received in the office of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade. Our credentials being in order there is no difficulty experienced in our reception. Nothing can exceed the civility and polite¬ ness of the officials, and of the rank and file of the Brigade. Fine, active, cheerful fellows, all sailors, these firemen are a credit to their organisation and to London. The Superintendent hands us over to a bright young fellow, who is waiting his promotion—we hope he has reached it, it not a death vacancy—and he takes us in charge kindly. Standing in the very entrance, we had already remarked two engines. The folding, automatic doors are closed in front of these machines. One, a steamer, is be¬ ing nursed by means of a gas tube to keep the fire-box warm. When the fire-call rings there is no time to begin to get up steam. The well-heated interior soon acts in response to the quickly lighted fire as the engine starts, and by the time our steamer reaches its des¬ tination steam is generated. A spare steamer is close at hand. sKGitfK sHrom UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 24 THE STRAND MAGAZINE. Very bright and clean is the machine, which in a way puts its useful ally, the “ manual,” in the shade ; though at present the latter kind are more numerous, in the proportion of seventy-eight to forty-eight. Turning from the engines, we notice a row of burnished helmets hanging over tunics, and below these, great knee-boots, which are so familiar to the citizen. When the alarm is rung, these are donned rapidly ; but we opine the gates will occupy some time in the opening. Our guide smiles, and points out two ropes hanging immediately over the driving seat of each engine. “ When the engine is ready the coach¬ man pulls the rope, and the gates open of their own accord, you may say. See here ! ” He turns to the office entrance, where two ropes are hanging side by side. A pull on each, and the doors leading to the back¬ yard open and unfold themselves. The catch drops deftly into an aperture made to receive it, and the portals are thus kept open. About a second and a half is occu¬ pied in this manoeuvre. We consider it unfortunate that we shall not see a “ turn out,” as alarms by day are not usual. The Superintendent looks quizzical, but says nothing then. He gives instructions to our guide to show us all we want to see, and in this spirit we examine the instrument room close at hand. Here are fixed a number of telephonic apparatus, labelled with the names of the stations :—Manchester-square, Clerkenwell, Whitechapel, and so on, five in number, known by the Brigade as Superintendents’ Stations, A, B, C, D, E Districts. By these means immediate communication can be obtained with any portion of the Metropolis, and the condition and requirements of the fires reported. There is also a frame in the outer office which bears a number of elec¬ tric bells, which can summon the head of any department, or demand the presence of any officer instantly. It is extraordinary to see the quiet way in which the work is performed, the ease and freedom of the men, and the strict observance of discipline withal. Very few men are visible as we pass on to the repair¬ ing shops. (Illustration, p. 2Q.) Here the engines are repaired and inspected. There are eleven steamers in the shed, some available for service, and so designated. If an outlying station require a steamer in substitution for its own, here is one ready. The boilers are examined every six months, and tested by water-pressure up to 180 lbs. on the square inch, in order to sustain safely the steam pressure up to 120 lbs., when it “ blows off.” . Passing down the shed we notice the men—all Brigade men—employed at their various tasks in the forge or carpenters’ shop. Thus it will be perceived that the head-quarters enclose many different artizans, and is self-contained. The men were lifting a boiler when we were present, and our artist “caught them in the act.” Close to the entrance is a high “ shoot ” in which hang pendant numerous ropes and many lengths of drying hose. The im¬ pression experienced when standing under¬ neath, and gazing upwards, is something like the feeling one would have while gazing up at the tops of the trees in a pine wood. There is a sense of vastness in this narrow lofty brick enclosure, which is some 70 ft. high. The hose is doubled in its length of 100 ft., and then it drains dry, for the moisture is apt to conceal itself in the rubber lining, and in the nozzles and head-screws of the hoses. No precaution is neglected, no point is missed. Vigilant eyes are everywhere ; bright responsive faces and ready hands are continually in evidence, but unobtrusively. Turning from the repairing shops we proceed to the stables, where we find things in the normal condition of preparedness. “ Be ready ” is evidently the watchword of the Brigade. Ready, aye ready! Neat¬ ness and cleanliness are here scrupulously regarded. Tidiness is the feature of the stables. A pair of horses on either side are standing, faces outward, in their stalls. Four handsome, well-groomed, lithe animals they look ; and as we enter they regard us with considerable curiosity, a view which we reciprocate. Round each horse’s neck is suspended his collar. A weight let into the woodwork ot the stall holds the harness by means of a lanyard and swivel. When the alarm rings the collar is dropped, and in “half a second ” the animals, traces and splinter- bar hanging on their sleek backs and sides, are trotted out and harnessed. Again we express our regret that no kind householder will set fire to his tenement, that no nice children will play with matches or candle this fine morning, and let us “ see every¬ thing,” like Charles Middlewick. Once more our guide smiles, and passes on through t^e fqrage and harness-rooms, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN THE METROPOLITAN FIRE BRIGADE. 25 3 N THE STAPLES- where we also find a coachman’s room for reading, and waiting on duty. It is now nearly mid-day, and we turn to see the fire-drill of the recruits, who, clad in slops, practise all the necessary and requisite work which alone can render them fit for the business. They are thus employed from nine o’clock to mid-day, and from two till four p.m. During these five hours the squads are exercised in the art of putting the ladders and escapes on the wagons which convey them to the scene of the fire. The Tecruit must learn how to raise the heavy machine by his own efforts, by means of a rope rove through a ring-bolt. We had an oppor¬ tunity to see the recruits raising the machine together to get it off the wagon. The men are practised in leaping up when the vehicle is starting off at a great pace after the wheets are manned to give an impetus to the vehicle which car¬ ries such a burthen. But the “rescue drill” is still more interesting, and this ex¬ hibited the strength and dexterity of the firemen in a surprising manner. It is striking to notice the different ways in which the rescue of the male and female sexes is accomplished. The sure¬ footed fireman rapidly ascends the ladder, and leaps upon the parapet. The escape is furnished with a ladder which projects beyond the net. At the bottom a canvas sheet or “ hammock ” is suspended, so that the rescued shall not suffer from contusions, which formerly were frequent in consequence of the rapid descent. One fireman passes into a garret window and emerges with a man. He makes no pause on the parapet, where already, heedless of glare and smoke and the risk of a fall, he has raised on his shoulders the heavy, apparently inanimate,form,and grasp¬ ing the man round one leg, his arm inside the thigh, he carries him steadily, like a sack of coals, down the ladder as far as the opening of the bag-net of the escape. Here he halts, and puts the man into the net, perhaps head downwards, he himself following in the same position. The man rescued is then let down easily, the fireman using his elbows and knees as “ breaks ” to arrest their progress. So the individual is assisted down, and not permitted to go un¬ attended. The rescue of a female is accomplished in a slightly different manner. She is also carried to the ladder, but the rescuer grasps both her tegs below the knees, and when he reaches the net he places her head down¬ wards and grasps her dress tightly round her ankles, holding her thus in a straight posi¬ tion. Thus her dress is undisturbed, and she is received in the folds of the friendly canvas underneath, in safety. There is also a “jumping drill ” from the windows into a sheet held by the other men. This course of instruction is not so / Ur Fim UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 26 THE STRAND MAGAZINE. RECRUITS D KILLING* popular, for it seems somewhat of a trial to leap in cold blood into a sheet some twenty feet below* The feat of lifting a grown man (weighing perhaps sixteen rnrii.i. stone) from the parapet to the right knee, then, by grasping the waist, getting the limp arm around his neck, and then, holding the leg, to rise up and walk on a narrow ledge amid all the terrible sur¬ roundings of a fire, requires much nerve and strength* Frequently we hear of deaths and injuries to men of the Brigade, but no landsman can attain proficiency in even double the time that sailors do—the latter are so accustomed to giddy heights, and to precarious footing* Moreover, the belt, to which a swivel hook is attached, is a safeguard of which Jack takes every advantage* This equip¬ ment enables him to hang on to a ladder and swing about like a monkey, having both hands free to save or assist a victim or the fire or one of his mates. There is a death-roll of about five men annually, on the average, and many arc injured, if not fatally yet very seriously, by falling walls and such accidents. Drenched and soaked, the men have a terrible time of it at a fire, and they richly deserve the leisure they obtain. This leisure is, however, not so pleasant as might be imagined, for the fire¬ man is always on duty ; and, no matter how he is occupied, he may be wanted on the engine F and QrifpNftflBBtm UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 1HE METROPOLITAN FIRE BRIGADE 27 Having inspected the American ladder in its shed, we glanced at the stores and pattern rooms, and at the firemen’s quarters* Here the men live with their wives and families, if they are married, and in single blessed¬ ness, if Love the Pilgrim has not come their way.

These past scenes vanish as our guide returns and beckons us toother sights. Of these, by far the most melancholy in¬ terest is awakened by the relics of those brave firemen who have died, or have been seriously injured, on duty. In a cupboard, in a long, rather low apartment, in the square or innei quadrangle of the building, are a number of helmets; bruised, battered, broken, burnt ; the fragments of crests twisted by fire, dulled by water and dust and smoke.

As I pause in doubt and surprise, the heavy rear doors swing open by themselves as boldly and almost as noiselessly as the iron gate which opened for St. Peter. A clattering of hoofs, a running to and fro for a couple of seconds ; four horses trot in, led by the coachman ; in the twinkling of an eye the animals are hitched to the ready engines ; the firemen dressed, helmeteJ, and booted are seated on the machines ; a momentary pause to learn at the traces ; the passers-by scatter helter- skelter as Lhc horses plunge into the street and then dash round the corner to their stables once again, “ A false alarm ? \" 41 Yes, sir.

It is almost impossible to describe the effect which this sudden transformation scene produces ; the change is so rapid, the effect is so dramatic, so novel to a stranger.

This unpretending room upstairs is plainly but comfortably furnished—though no carpet covers the floor, oilcloth being cooler. Business is writ large on every side. On one wall is a large map of the fire stations of the immense area presided over by Captain Shaw. Here are separately in¬ dicated the floating engines, the escapes, ladders, call points, police stations, and private communications.

There are many interesting items in connection with the Brigade which we find time to chronicle. For instance, we learn that the busiest time is, as one would expect, between September and December. The calls during the year t88q amounted to 3,131. Of these 594 were false alarms, 199 were only chimneys on fire, and of the remainder 153 only resulted in serious damage, 2,185 hi slight damage. These calls are exclusive of ordinary chimney 29 fires and small cases, but in all those above referred to engines and men were turned out. The grand total of fires amounted to 4 ' 7 °?t or 011 an average 13 fires, or supposed fires, a day. This is an increase of 3?o on those of 1888, and we find that the incre¬ ment has been growing for a decade. However, considering the increase in the number of houses, there is no cause for alarm. Lives were lost at thirty-eight fires in J889. The personnel of the Brigade consists of only seven hundred and seven of all ranks. The men keep watches of twelve hours, and do an immense amount of work besides. This force has the control of 158 engines, steam and manual of all sorts; 31^ miles of hose, and 80 THE REPAIRING SHOP* carts to carry it ; besides fire-floats, steam tugs, barges, and escapes ; long ladders, trolleys, vans, and J 31 horses. These are to attend to 365 call points, 72 telephones to stations, 55 alarm circuits, besides telephones to police stations and public and private buildirfg and houses, and the pay is 3s. 6d.per day, increasing ! From these, not altogether dry, bones of facts we may build up a monument to the great energy and intense esprit dc corps of Captain Shaw and his Brigade. In their hands we place ourselves every night. While the Metropolis sleeps the untiring Brigade watches over its safety. Whether at the head-quarters or at the outer stations, at the street stations, boxes, or escape sta¬ tions, the men arc continually vigilant; and are most cflkiently ispumded by the police. UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN THE STRAND MAGAZINE, 30 But for the latter force the efforts of the firemen would often be crippled, and their heroic attempts perhaps rendered fruitless, by the pressure of the excited spectators. We have now seen the manner in which the Metropolitan Fire Brigade is managed, and how it works ; the splendid services it accomplishes, for which few rewards are forthcoming. It is true that a man may attain to the post of superintendent, and to a house, with a salary of ^*245 a year, but he has to serve a long probation. For con¬ sider that he has to learn his drill and the general working of the Brigade. Every man must be competent to perform all the duties. During this course of instruction he is not permitted to attend a fire ; such experience being found unsuitable to be¬ ginners. In a couple of months, if he has been a sailor* the recruit is fit to go out, and he is sent to some station, where, as fireman of the fourth class, he performs the duties required. By degrees, from death or accident, or other causes* those above him are removed, or promoted, and he ascends the ladder to the first class, where, having passed an ex¬ amination, he gets a temporary appoint¬ ment as assistant officer on probation. If then satisfactory, he is confirmed in his position as officer, proceeds to head-quarters, and superintends a section of the establish¬ ment as inspector of the shops, and finally as drill instructor. After this service, he is probably put under the superintendent at a station as u engineer-in-charge, n as he is termed. He has, naturally, every detail of drill and ** business H at his fingers 1 ends. The wis¬ dom of such an arrangement is manifest* As the engineer-in-charge has been lately through the work of drill instructor, he knows exactly what is to be done, and every other officer in similar position also knows it. Thus uniformity of practice is insured. There are many other points on which information is most courteously given at head-quarters. But time presses. We ac¬ cordingly take leave of our pleasant guide, and the most polite of superintendents, and, crossing the Iron Bridge once more, plunge into the teeming thoroughfares of the City, satisfied. CAI'TAIJST SJlAW's SANCTUM. Original from UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN Scenes of the Siege of Paris . From the French of Alphonse Daudet, [Alphonse DauOET, the most brilliunt of French novelists alive, was born at Klines in 1840. Ills parents were not rich, and he started life bv drudging as an usher. Then he resolved to break his chains, and to earn his bread at Paris with his pen. He began by painting in the Figaro^ with great graphic power, the miseries of ushers in provincial schools. Then he turned to writing stories, with the success to which he owes his world-wide fame. Most of his novels are well known itvEngland ; but the characteristic little stories here translated will probably be new to English readers.] L—THE BOY SPY, M HE WOULD TA^E III* PI ACE IS THE LQHG LIN'S/ IS name was Sten no : they called him Little Stenne, He was a thorough child of Paris ; delicate-looking, pale, about ten years old—perhaps fifteen—one never can tell the ages of these scaramouches. His mother was dead ; his father, an old marine, used tn guard a square in the Temple quarter. Babies, nursemaids, the old women with folding-chairs, poor mothers—all the lei¬ surely-moving world of Parts which puts itself out of the way of carriages in those gardens—knew Father Stenne, and wor¬ shipped him. People knew that under that bristling terror of dogs and UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 32 THE STRAND MAGAZINE . tramps, there lurked a tender, pleasant, almost a maternal smile ; and that to see it one had only to say to the good man— “ How is your little boy ? ” Father Stenne was very fond of his son. He was never so happy as in the evening after school when the little fellow came to fetch him, and when they went together round the walks, halting at every bench to speak to the regular loungers, and to reply to their civil greetings. With the siege all this unfortunately changed. The square was closed ; petro¬ leum had been stored in it, and poor Stenne, obliged to keep watch incessantly, passed his life amid the deserted, and partly de¬ stroyed, clumps of trees without being able to smoke, and without the company of his son until he returned home late in the evening. You should have seen his mous¬ tache when he spoke of the Prussians ! Little Stenne, however, did not complain very much of this new life. A siege is such fun for the street boys! No more school; no lessons; holidays ail the time, and the streets just like a fair! The lad stayed out all day till quite evening, running about. He would accompany the battalions of the quarter on their turn of duty to the ramparts, choos¬ ing those specially which had good bands ; and on this question little Stenne was quite critical. He would have told you plainly that the band of the Ninety-sixth was not good for much ; but that the Fifty-fifth had an excellent one. At other times he watched the mobiles drilling, and then there were the queues to occupy him. With his basket on *■ his arm he would take his place in the long lines which, in the half-light of the winter mornings—those gas¬ less mornings—were formed outside the gates of the butchers and bakers. There the people, waiting for rations, their feet in the puddles, talked politics and made When the game was finished he led Stenne to a corner of the Place, and pro¬ posed that he should go with him and sell newspapers to Germans—at thirty UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN acquaintances ; and, ■ as the son of M. Stenne, every one asked the lad his opinion. But the greatest fun of all was the cork-throwing parties—the famous game of galoche — which the Breton mobiles had introduced during the siege. When little Stenne was not on the ram¬ parts, or at the distribution of rations, you would surely find him in the Place Chateau d'Eau. He did not play galoche himself, you must understand: too much money was needed for that. He contented himseif by watching the players “ with all his eyes.” One lad—a big fellow in a blue jacket— who never ventured aught but five-franc pieces, especially excited the admiration of little Stenne. When this fellow moved about you could hear the coins jingling in his pocket. One day, when picking up a piece that had rolled to the feet of our hero, the big boy said to him : “ Ah! that makes your mouth water, eh ? Well, if you wish, 1 will tell you where to find some like this.” B* I i- LET US PASS, GOOD flli.' 33 SCENES OF THE francs the trip ! At first Stenne indignantly refused, and he did not go again to watch the game for three whole days—three terrible days. He no longer ate nor slept. At night\" he had visions of heaps of galoches at the foot of his bed, and five- franc pieces rolling and shining brightly. The temptation was too strong. On the fourth day he returned to the Chatea"
