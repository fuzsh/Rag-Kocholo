But even before presenting herself in an exquisitely literary context, she proudly underlines her Indian roots, and this allembracing assertion unceasingly leaves a profoundly coherent mark on form and content. Thus these interviews accompany the reader on a human and professional itinerary, where the reading of her poems is often an illuminating exegetic commentary, directly or more often perceptibly, but at the same time it speaks of the place and time where her inspiration was born. From the very beginning, it communicates a cultural background that draws on family habits—painting and music—the former from her grandmother Naomi Harjo and her great-aunt Lois Harjo (“I found a great refuge in the act of drawing”), the latter from her mother (“my mother was a singer, so we had music and her voice often holding our home together”), up to the moment of her escape from Oklahoma to New Mexico to study at the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA), and subsequently at the University of Iowa. Her initial relationship with this university was problematic, due to the quality of its teaching (“too male and white oriented”) and the gap between her educational background and that of other students, in an environment where the artistic sensibility included nothing of her tribal tradition (“I felt a stranger there”). But the strength of her inner world, her great creative inspiration, although “married with great despair” as a result of a painful sense of discomfort and harsh everyday difficulties, nevertheless projected her toward increasing acquirement of her means of expres-\n\nsion. Her success as a poet, after a relatively short period of writing, is displayed in numerous volumes. Her work is attracting a growing readership, and has drawn the attention of critics in the United States and elsewhere, as well as in several university courses dedicated to her production, giving rise to high-quality degree dissertations. In this collection of interviews there unfolds a detailed discussion of the complex material from which she derives her inspiration, a testimony that points to a relentless drive toward the truth in the many worlds that she passes through, always animated by the desire to find an area of light, sometimes in a harsh clash with reality. But the first thing to emerge from her writer’s laboratory is the close anchoring of her poetry to orality, with the result that “written text is, for me, fixed orality”: it thus goes back to a performance she remembers and it transmits an oral act, in which the moment of speaking and listening unites the poet and her audience in a single inseparable unit. Hence the creation of a mixed genre, or cross-genre writing, is increasingly present in her more recent works. These are compositions from which several voices emerge—poems, prose poems, stories, commentaries preceding the poems, which are generally created “to mimic oral presentations,” or as a reflection of an oral experience of poetry. In the answers that Harjo gives, this concept is often repeated, and from this, in turn, there emerges music as a natural continuity, not so much as a bridge between two genres, but because “the roots of poetry lead to music.” Since poetry is a sound art, as she affirms, music, singing voice, and spoken poetic word converge together “as one voice.” Music, and in particular that of the saxophone, to which she has turned her hand in recent years, is often mentioned in these interviews. Besides speaking of a beloved Indian ancestor who played the same instrument, of her band, or of individual musicians like Larry Mitchell, with whom she often performs, she specifies that by so doing, she creates a performance in which she challenges the current way of interpreting the utilization of poetry: indeed “That was the original impetus of the poetry, and of the sax, to find a way to sing: I still want my poems to stand up on their own. This will make me even more a maverick in the poetry world, in this country at least. I don’t enjoy academic reverie.” Thus Harjo’s work now includes aspects different from those that x\n\nForeword\n\nit displayed initially: the written word also becomes a voice modulated with traditional tones—songs and chants, which radiate a music that springs from her saxophone. But the sonorities that come into being are not an accompaniment or a musical tempo, but rather intimate unions of words, voices, and sounds which convey the blend and interpenetration of meanings and rhythms, perfectly harmonized in a continual reciprocal reflection. A performance like this goes beyond its own communicative act, and becomes the expression of a culture, as she says, captured in its deepest roots, and modulated with a sense of belonging and continuity. The contribution of modern sonorities such as blues is suggestive not so much of influences, but of a revitalization of a kind of music born and cultivated in the tribal environment. This is the awareness that animates the poetics and musical activity of Joy Harjo, intent as she is on not leaving any empty spaces between words, voice, and music. The answers to the various interviewers depict a world in which the things of life emerge and are transmitted by an energy that unites people, plants, and animals, “an engagement and not a dominant concept” but something “that opens everything up.” Her poetic expression, thus interpreted, allows her “to speak directly in a language that was intended to destroy us” or, to quote another famous text of hers on Native American women writers, edited with Gloria Bird, “reinventing the enemy’s language.” It is a language at the basis of so-called “minority literature”—Indian, in this case—a label that Harjo identifies as a “power trick” because, she affirms, the geographic expanse of tribal cultures covers an immense extension from one end of the globe to the other, including major literary traditions: “It’s the fearful ones who try and keep us out who are still looking for a place.” And she goes on: “This ‘American culture’ is young and rootless. It is adolescent with an adolescent sense of time and place, that is ‘here and now,’ with no reference or power rooted in the earth, ancestors, or historical and mythical sense. Value your community and what that has to offer, and continue to reach out beyond what you know, and grow fresh ideas, meetings between borders, new roots.” This continual aspiration to an inner growth, the need for a dialogue with the multiple heritage of the past, with everything that moves around human beings, in the contrast that arises with contem\n\nForeword\n\nxi\n\nporary America, is summed up in another highly perceptive affirmation regarding the mainstream culture of the United States: I have always called the U.S. culture the “over-culture” and don’t consider it a true culture. Belief, social institutions, art, and traditions construct culture. The United States is made up of many cultures. There is no such thing as a melting pot. There are various cultural streams that are renewed, slowed, cut off, or otherwise changed. The over-culture is a culture of buying and selling.\n\nFurthermore, this bitter appraisal pervades her awareness of tragic events in contemporary America, besieged by violence and imperialistic forays which in the end provoke further violence at the heart of its own territory: its onset may appear to be sudden, “but there is a trail that goes back, like roots.” And these are the same roots that go back to the distant past, that is to say, almost as far back as the ethnocide of the tribal peoples. This is a reflection that brings with it the landscape of the American West, full of history and wounds, and at the same time remembered and celebrated as an “intimate connection,” lands which have nourished a never-ending journey, together with the landscape of Hawai‘i, where Harjo lived for many years, “to learn water”; “when water is the prevailing influence everything in the atmosphere carried its essence of being.” The representation of Harjo’s activity extends to the role and the responsibility of artists: they must bring a testimony of experience in the present, but also a renewal in the wake of tradition; they promote and regenerate art and culture, sometimes communicating with their public almost beyond the realm of words, if the communicative act takes place in perfect reciprocal integrity, if words are used to usher in transformation. In this context, then, to write poetry “is to move into the world and effect change,” and that includes artists and their public, both part of the poem. Starting from these premises, Joy Harjo describes why she wrote two children’s books (The Good Luck Cat and For a Girl Becoming), not just to mark the birth of her grandchildren, but above all to cement relationships and responsibilities, to inspire an intimately reciprocal sense, to make sure that “all children are able to see themxii\n\nForeword\n\nselves in each other,” “to re-imagine themselves as beautiful and powerfulâ•‹.â•‹.â•‹.â•‹moved to dream and share.” All this derives from considering that her generation was taught to read by the Dick and Jane series, in which, rather than being created for children, the stories described an orderly, aseptic social reality, closed to everything that was not a part of the mainstream way of life, the same primer so perspicaciously described and progressively altered by Toni Morrison in The Bluest Eye. Although different in its aims and functions, Joy Harjo’s teaching experience—she has several times held courses of creative writing at prestigious universities—is based on the same principles: “Study with all parts of your being, not just your intellect. Some of your knowledge may come from books, most of it from other sources.” Such teaching transcends the formal techniques, always leading to an interrelation of all things, from which knowledge and true understanding are born. Bearing in mind the frequently mentioned sense of reciprocity, this teaching experience “can feed the writing,” “unless you are involved in academic politics and fights.” On other battles, Joy Harjo as a woman does not fail to speak her mind, expressing appreciation for the achievements of feminism, which has undoubtedly inspired significant changes, though many of these aspirations do not accord with the organization of the tribal world. However, in our modern-day world, she adds, we are still surrounded by a system in which everything connected with female experience is underestimated. Starting from its conception of the world, Christianity cancels every female presence, whereas there can be no creative power without any female force. In her articles for the Muscogee Nation News, she almost always starts by watching what is happening in the natural world. This view, with its inner harmony, clashes with what she sees in our society: stereotyped images of Indians, identity issues, fabricated or false stories giving rise to festivities like Thanksgiving, Hollywood movies about Native tribes, or the dehumanized way of living in a society where massacres and racism are the inexorable outcomes. Harjo’s thoughts turn instead to global roots and ancient trades by which almost everything traveled all over the world, connecting peoples and cultures. The same can be said for our creation of our own stories, which means that\n\nForeword\n\nxiii\n\nwe pass on family, clan, and tribal knowledge from one generation to another, making time and space larger than we can imagine. In the six pieces with which the volume closes the poet merges with the witness, not only of her times, but also of the past, conserving a moral and historical legacy engraved in her memory. The common denominator is an act of resistance as a safeguard against the wounds inflicted on the earth, to defend what a person is—although considered in various ways inferior because he or she does not fit neatly into the mold of civilization. By the same token, then, the term ‘act of resistance’ can also be used for the work of Patricia Grace, who was celebrated by Harjo when she was awarded the Neustadt International Prize for Literature. Grace is considered to be an ambassador for Maori writing and culture; her stories mingle her tradition with Western forms of contemporary literature. This is a way for all tribal cultures to remain anchored to the past, while renewing their tradition. And lastly there is the critic who skillfully enters into the intimate communicative process of epistolary literature in her afterword for The Delicacy and Strength of Lace, with the same “delicacy” that can be found in this exchange of letters between James Wright and Leslie Marmon Silko. Harjo detects, in the words of both, all the painful implications, or the peaceful flow of ordinary daily life, marked by sounds and colors that softly illuminate moments that may appear to be common, but which enclose inside them the savor of deep knowledge and the tranquil beauty of everything that surrounds us. It is a union of poetry and storytelling, says Harjo, and of human and literary voices which meet and share this interlaced pattern. Harjo, an artist herself, enters into this kind of creative laboratory, recognizing “the struggle to be artists in the midst of the daily challenges of living.” But being a poet is also a challenge that expands, in order to reconstruct this land called America. With the strength of writing, of poetry, of myths, it is possible to lay the foundations for a change, and to penetrate with language a spiral of cognitive experience, the essence that genuinely gives meaning to the life of our intellect and our spirit. This is a concept of poetic art where there is no place for higher forms of poetry that descend from the European tradition, as has already been repeated in various interviews. Beyond every hierarchy of value, poetry interprets and consigns to us the world to which we belong, xiv\n\nForeword\n\nalways looking for vision, as when Harjo goes out in search of a glimpse of sky early in the morning, above the neon totem poles in Times Square, to present her four-day-old fourth granddaughter to the sun: the affirmation of a harmonious relationship, the celebration of a sacred commission that gives certainty to our life. Like the sun, above the rain in New York. Like poetry. “The Last Word.” What emerges as a distinctive characteristic from this wide-ranging, insightful series of interviews is a constant boundary-crossing: varieties of genres, which are however linked together in a precise cognitive itinerary; the blending of the oral and the written to inform each other; the poetic sound of words and the sound of the sax; the woman and the artist telling of a perfect osmosis between life and writing; the water of Hawai‘i and the New Mexico desert; a pervasive call-and-response that Harjo always seeks from her audience. In these detailed responses, Harjo weaves a tapestry where every strand evokes a further pattern. It’s a dynamic process which continually opens up new possibilities of knowledge and artistic experimentation. And it is the testimony of a generous, fully convinced commitment which brings the past and the culture of her people to life with all the incisive mastery of modern means of expression, yet constantly draws on the strength of a memory, experienced not as an inert instrument, but as a driving power in the definition of an identity and in its affirmation in contemporary America. Joy Harjo lives in many different worlds, and by means of these interviews, she not only allows us to enter into her creative laboratory but she also draws a moving geography of the soul, a sort of irregular autobiography that possesses an extraordinary narrative effectiveness.

Explore her writing and you’ll soon find it rich in the auditory imagery of dogs barking, the ground speaking, and the moon playing the horn. And yet, sounds do much more than play to the senses in Harjo’s poetry. I was first introduced to Harjo’s voice through her poem, “She Had Some Horses,” in Lucille Clifton’s poetry class. By a careful reading of the poem, Clifton managed to guide her undergraduates through the repetition of the poem, the horse-running composition found in the rhythms of the words, and the end line which reverberated within us. “There is music here,” Clifton suggested, and indeed there was. Joy Harjo knows noise. Harjo has won many accolades and awards for her writing, including the William Carlos Williams Award, the American Indian Distinguished Achievement in the Arts Award, the Josephine Miles Poetry Award, the Mountains and Plains Booksellers Award. She has won fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Arizona Commission on the Arts, and the Witter Bynner Foundation. She holds a B.A. from the University of New Mexico, an M.F.A. from the University of Iowa, and an honorary doctorate from Benedictine College. In 2003–2004, she won dual awards, Writer of the Year and Storyteller of the Year from Wordcraft Circle of Native Writers and Storytellers for her book, How We Became Human: New and Selected Poems 1975–2001, and her CD, Native Joy for Real. Most recently, Wordcraft Circle awarded her the title of 2005 Writer of the Year— Film Script, for A Thousand Roads, which she wrote for the National Museum of the Native American.\n\nShe is an artist in more ways than one, as she is poet, songwriter, screenwriter, children’s writer, musician, and storyteller. And yet for all of her degrees, awards and accolades, she still runs across those who do not feel her writing is considered poetry. Joy Harjo knows noise. We recently had the privilege of catching up with Joy when we discussed the fusion of oral and written poetry, the responsibility of the poet, and the way music penetrates us allâ•‹.â•‹.â•‹.â•‹. You started out painting, yes? Yes, I started out painting when I was young and often think about returning to it. I never quite developed it. I eventually leaped over to poetry. And now you’ve been working with music for quite some time, as well as screenplays. Music was probably my first love, but I didn’t start working on it until the last fifteen years or so. I’ve written prose, and in fact, have a book way overdue at Norton. The contract is for a memoir, but memoir sounds so pretentious to me. It’s actually a book of stories, some of it as memoir. At the moment I’m working on a show, something that will combine all of the above. And yes, screenplays, too. A screenplay I cowrote for the National Museum of the American Indian, A Thousand Roads, just premiered at Sundance. There’s a 1993 interview with Marilyn Kallet, in which Kallet asks if you regretted the decision to give up painting, and asked what poetry could do that painting couldn’t, and you answered that it allows you to “Speak directly in a language that was meant to destroy us.” Do you find yourself attracted to that particular challenge? As an artist, I don’t really think about all that—being interviewed also engages the creative. You know, you have to come up with answers for interviewers. [laugh] But yeah, you do it because it absolutely moves you. What attracted me to poetry was language, was basically sound. Poetry is a sound art. Oral poetry is experienced directly as sound art. Poetry in books is sound art but for the most part has lost the original link to performance. Now performance poetry has become a 4\n\nint e rvie w s\n\npejorative term. Poetry was here long before Mr. Gutenberg, scrolls, or any other book-like means of transporting the word. What enticed me about poetry was being able to hold in my hands and in my heart these small pieces of meticulous and beautiful meaning. It was like reclaiming the soul, or giving the soul a voice. When you talk about your first encounter with music, you describe it as being drawn into the music on an almost physical level. There are a lot of other instances in which memory seems to be accompanied by the same mixing of senses. Is this part of the process for you? I guess so. I don’t like to think about it too much. You know? [laugh] Because when I start thinking too much, it gets in the way and sometimes even just writing what I have to do is like going through a ritual to get rid of all the literal and linear and hierarchical stuff of the Western world, and I have to just let that go. My first experience of music in this world was through my mother’s singing voice. I have a very, very faint memory of that experience while in the womb, and then it became the center of my world, especially in the formative years, when my mother was writing songs and singing for country swing bands, jukeboxes in truck stops where she worked, the radio, guitar players at the house. Music was and is my body. I don’t think I ever felt a separation between music and my body. Words make bridges but music penetrates. In reading your poetry, I find myself immediately thinking in terms of dynamicism. Yes, that appears to be the consensus. I’ve collaborated with an astronomer, Stephen Strom: his photographs, my poetic prose pieces. His astronomical study is on the birth of stars. Poetry also concerns rigorous studies, of the human soul, which is directly connected to Strom’s studies. We all appear to struggle in this universe. Poetry is basically another discipline and provides a structure for understanding the world. Science is a religion. Its world is mechanistic. Some philosophical strands of American and European poetry are similar, based on a mechanistic world, and more theoretical. To dip down into the soul is to get dirty. The more theoretical, the more removed it can become, and then you lose a relationship between the soul and the\n\nBecoming the Thing Itself\n\n5\n\nworld. You talk at it rather than move with it. I’ll never forget my first day of teaching at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Reg Saner was a professor there. He introduced himself and came into my office. Said that he believed there were two kinds of poets; he called them Jacob and Esau poets, Jacob implying the refined and Esau the hairy wild man. He considered me of the second sort, primitive. Seems to me this becomes a pejorative kind of naming though he may not have meant it directly that way. The way I took it at that time was as a question: what is such a primitive poet doing in such a refined place? And that connection between the soul and the world is important to you in your poetry? To me, that’s what poetry is. The communication with the soul is imÂ�Â� portant to me, and maybe this, too, is considered primitive! There’s communication going on here. Right. In a couple of previous interviews, you’ve mentioned the idea of the fusion of oral and written as a new literature. How do you see this manifesting itself in your work? Well, I think it is on Native Joy for Real. I consider singing, the saxophone, and poetry the blending of the oral and written. My early poems were short, lyrical statements usually fastened around one image. Then, they grew as my concept of poetry and vision grew. Being a mother of young children influenced the form. Then as the children grew, so did spaces of time in which to write. The lines grew longer, the vision deeper. The first experimentation I did with the interweaving of the oral with written was in The Woman Who Fell From the Sky. By the time I got those poems, I was trying to figure out how to make a book reflect an oral experience of poetry, in written form. Hence, the prose pieces in between the poems. They were another kind of experience that replicated, I felt, the experience of the performance of the poems. It’s not the first time it was done. Evers’ and Molina’s Yaqui Deer Songs used this technique, and they referred to Leslie Silko’s Storyteller. I wanted the experience of the book to mimic my oral presentations, which often have commentary preceding the 6\n\nint e rvie w s\n\npoems. A Map to the Next World expanded that concept. Maybe it doesn’t work. Adding a saxophone takes you so far outside the written pages of a book, it’s blasphemy! How has a loss of credibility, for mixing genres, expressed itself, and how do you see such a reaction reflecting upon the world of poetry? When you perform or sing or add a saxophone to your poetry, it’s taken from the realm of literary art to performance art, and performance art is a pejorative term. Recently I came upon a blog written by someone who had come to a performance in Ojai that included Galway Kinnell, Suzanne Lummis, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and me. She was a very good writer, kind of edgy, edgy academic. She trashed me and was very pleased with her erudite opinion. What I was doing wasn’t real poetry. What did singing and saxophone have to do with it? She and others like her feel that the music is getting in the way of poetry. And if you read poetry a particular way, then I suppose it is. It’s not supposed to be sung, and it’s not supposed to have other kinds of accompaniment, or you’re destroying the integrity of the written word. The words and text exist without you. That is one reality of poetry, a fixed, flat-planed reality. In another interview, you mentioned that the division between music and poetry is not something that really has substance in some Native American traditions. In listening and reading your work, especially “Woman Hanging from the 13th Floor,” and comparing them and seeing the revisions that had been done from one to the other, what was your process? When I turned the poem into a song I trimmed about half of the poem, then added a hook line, chorus, and other musical kinds of elements. What sort of things do you find demanding this sort of revision? There’s a difference between a spoken phrase and a sung phrase. And at the root is rhythm. It’s been a primary creative spark for me, even before the music was added, or dropped in where it was always meant to be. Repeating elements are pleasing to the ear, or can be. In “Woman Hanging from the 13th Floor,” “Set me free” in one verse is “Set us free,” in the next, and in another “Set them free.” It works, I\n\nBecoming the Thing Itself\n\n7\n\nthink. I didn’t need these repeating elements in a poem, but the song needed them. The music fits right around other poems, as if I’d written them to include the music at some future point. This integration has been a long time coming. My first effort was Furious Light, a tape produced and distributed by a Washington, D.C., organization, Watershed Foundation. It’s no longer available. I don’t even have a copy anymore. Several prominent Denver jazz musicians performed on it, including Laura Newman and Eric Gunnison. The next was my formation of the band, Poetic Justice, which was first just Susan Williams and me, then her brother, John, then Will Johnson, and later Richard Carbajal. I spoke the poems on that project, which resulted in a CD of music, Letter from the End of the Twentieth Century. I learned to play saxophone on that album, played soprano and alto. My singing voice began to evolve and on the next project I learned to sing. The writing too has been affected. Three of the songs on Native Joy for Real are written as songs. The rest were poems first, and I suppose continue to be poems. It’s a process and continues to be a process. One of your most recent books, A Map to the Next World, makes use of the same alternation between prose and poetry you mentioned in The Woman Who Fell From the Sky. Right. The book consciously leaps between the two. One is to be reminiscent of an oral act, the other more written. And often the two inform each other. Some of the connections are more explicit, and some are less, but in one poem, “Returning from the Enemy,” it seems to hit a real focus. The entire poem takes its form in exactly this way, and toward the end of the book, there’s a final poem, “In the Beautiful Perfume and Stink of the World,” in which you have two poems that are braided together. That weaving informs the whole shape of the book and occurs at many levels, a kind of oral and written call-and-response, or the linear stacked next to the mythic. There’s the overall book, then “Returning from the Enemy” mimics this shape within a longer poem, and then the shape occurs within the final poem, “In the Beautiful Perfume and Stink of the World.” This was my original choice for the name of\n\n8\n\nint e rvie w s\n\nthe book, by the way, but my editor vetoed it—didn’t like the word “stink” in the title. Found it repugnant. But to my thinking, it’s part of this world, and now seems to be very much a part of this world. Anyway, within that poem, there is that back and forth, so that form is at work on three levels. “Returning from the Enemy.” That title is a reference to a Native American ceremony, is that correct? Yes. A lot of native cultures have such ceremonies. The poem is intended to work as an actual ceremony for cleansing someone who has gone off to war—and certainly going out into the world can be going to war—and seen and participated in atrocities. Of course, seeing is a kind of participating. You are present at the moment. And what you’ve seen and taken in is dangerous—to the mind, body, soul, and spirit—and can infect everyone, not just in the present moment but through all time. Much of the monster we are witnessing now in America was given life with the first massacres. So basically the poem is a cleansing ceremony. And to be clean of something you have to go back to the root. In this poem, this isn’t a literal war, it’s basically a war in terms of culture, correct? Yes, it is a cultural war I’m addressing here. Violence informs all aspects of it. The source of much of this violence is a fundamentalist stance, a relentless stance in which one opinion or experience of religion, education, or culture is deemed the only one, and anything different is an enemy. Forcing language use is violent and disturbs the root of a people, both the afflicted and the perpetrator. Your own poetry is often described as a ‘poetry of witness,’ thus suggesting that conceptions of history are quite central to your work. Do you see the primary aim of history, and by extension, a poetry of witness, to be similar to that of a cleansing ceremony? I don’t know about making a direct analogy between a cleansing ceremony and poetry of witness. Certainly poetry of witness can act as an element in a cleansing ceremony, or a series of poems could be ceremo-\n\nBecoming the Thing Itself\n\n9\n\nnial in intent. I’m not sure what you’re asking. Cleansing can be one part of a larger process of acknowledgment, preparation, recounting, and so on. Well, for example, one of the threads of thought, in “Returning from the Enemy,” is a comparison between the mythological and the everyday ways in which we see ourselves and others. For example, you write, “When my father remembered he was descended from leaders, he was ashamed he’d hit his wife, his baby. When I was the baby I did not know my father as a warrior, I knew him as an intimate in whose face I recognized myself.” This comparison between mythological figures and real life, how do you think that informs the process you’re describing in “Returning from the Enemy”? I tenderly and reluctantly stepped into the place of that poem, didn’t want to, but while in New Smyrna Beach could not deny what I was seeing forming directly in front of me, in a place known by my people before we were moved further and further west into what is now called Oklahoma. History became present and known. The micro and macro views are mirrors and they were fiercely reflecting there. I mean, we go out into the world and we encounter, but the world is also inside us. And we’re inside the world, and within that configuration, all of this takes place in one space. There might be a distance, and there might be an intimate closeness, but it all takes place in the same space. Lately, I’ve been exploring how everything occurs within the same space at the same time, a thought akin to principles of quantum physics: each moment is layered and present. Being able to discern this is another matter. Poetry is a means. You spoke, once, about your grandmother, I think it was, knowing the color of a general’s dog, and how this informs your own sense of what is historical. Yes, the dog belonged to my great-great-etc-great grandfather, Monahwee, who was one of the major leaders of my tribe. He often turns up in the pages of history books, but these are the kind of details that are deleted—these heighten the meaning and lend context.\n\n10\n\nint e rvie w s\n\nMemory, and the way it shapes our approach to history, is a very important concept for you, yes? Right, because I think that memory is active. It’s an active thing and it kind of twists through present, past, and future. I thought I knew what memory was/is, but I’ve been wrestling with that concept. Maybe there’s human memory, which is flawed by emotional recall, point of view, etc, and then there’s the memory of stones, which is closer to eternal but still flawed by lack of ability to move freely, and then overmemory, the ocean of all memories. For me, memory isn’t situated in the past, but moves about freely. We can catch hold of it. And some of it is born within us, probably located somewhere in that DNA spiral. For instance, what if we take Monahwee and the example of the little black dog. We have the stories of him, or the memories of him, that are intimately connected because of family connections, and those family connections are kept solid because of the stories we continue to tell of him, and of that little black dog, and the stories of him basically able to bend time, when he traveled, and other stories. That’s how we know him, through those intimate particulars. This memory was carried from Monahwee to his son, then daughter, then daughter, then my great-aunt Lois Harjo, who told me, and I wonder how it’s changed through this chain of human rememberers. Most of us are pretty eccentric in our remembering. But, the image is there, nonetheless, and links to other stories about his ability to communicate with animals, including his horses. And because we speak them—and because there’s power in speaking, there’s power in thinking, and in dreaming and remembering, because it makes energy—it makes real energy. And every time you think, dream, speak, or write of someone or something, it gives power and makes connections. And even when you think about your enemies, same thing. This is about a process of linking. The connection is dynamic. Our family has the memory of Monahwee, as does the tribe. And then there’s the memory of Menawa (pronounced differently in Alabama) whose McKenney-Hall image is presented next to Andrew Jackson at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend Monument in Alabama. There, he’s an image of defeat, of takeover, and he represents the end of Native presence in the area. I’ll never forget performing at Auburn University. When I announced that I was the granddaughter of Monahwee, they gasped. It was an immense gasp. I was suddenly a\n\nBecoming the Thing Itself\n\n11\n\nghost appearing in front of them. All these years my relatives and I had been presumed dead. So that Monahwee, or Menawa, as they called him there, was a flat figure in history. He was a part of a process of colonization. He wasn’t real. And that’s the difference, because where I come from, that particular spirit lives. Your spirit can travel back— or forwards, depending—and connect, because it’s there and part of you. I believe that history contracts and expands, depending. I can see Monahwee’s spirit evident in the children, grandchildren—it grows itself. Frightening to think about what is growing, what we are given birth to as our actions and thoughts leap from us. [laugh] You know? [laugh] We’re all grown from each other. We’re part of a process, of a root system. I think ideas are given form in that same manner. Even theories are a creative act. You almost get the sense, in this conception of it, that memory is a sentient being, and that the division between past, present, and future is useful, in a practical sense, but not essentially real. You’ve mentioned, a number of times, that when we speak, when we dream and think, this has power, it puts energy out there and changes the world. This poem, “Returning from the Enemy,” ends with somebody who is being severely tortured, and who continues to sing throughout it. How does that fit in for you, do you think? This image, this story was taken from a story that appeared in the New Yorker on a massacre in El Salvador. Men were taken out and shot and women and children herded into a church and burned. Other women and girls were hunted down in the fields, then raped and killed. The one survivor told the story of how she watched all of this, hidden in the field. The most beautiful girl of all of them was singled out for heavy and violent rape. In the middle of her degradation she sang. She went down singing. To take what was meant to destroy her and turn it into a song is one of the most powerful acts I have been witness to, and I was witness to it in a story that was printed in the New Yorker. Funny to think of the New Yorker magazine as being a carrier of memory. But it is. And it was, for me. And in the context of my poem/story sequence, which references a historical span of much degradation, killing, and theft, it made sense. It does make quite a leap, in the context, and that could, in the end, be an inherent weakness in the sequence. 12\n\nint e rvie w s\n\nMaybe the singing will help shift the pattern, the reaction to the pattern, and maybe that’s behind my singing of the poems. The poem/ story sequence is really about facing the ruins of colonization in my family, myself. The overriding voice is female, includes many different ages of female. Historically, there are no female voices, and especially no female Native voices. The only two who appear are Pocahontas, and she has no direct voice but remains as an image, as a colonized figure in her English clothes. And there’s Sacajawea, who has a voice because of her link to two white explorers, Lewis and Clark. We don’t hear her voice. Most Native stories weren’t and aren’t recorded on paper. There are many reasons for that, but overall there’s a basic mistrust of the written word, as our experience with it has been writing as a colonizing tool. And women weren’t respected by the colonizers. Males wrote and made history and still do. Stories, songs, and poems exist more so in the space of memory. And to know them you have to have an intimate relationship with the tribe and be literally part of the context of the tribe. The power of the written word is access, and a different kind of movement, which also promotes a different kind of remembering. So, in “Returning from the Enemy,” the speaker is female. She holds the father in that voice, carries memory. To find memory, or desire, or some other emotional force, coming across in your poems as living creatures seems so important to what is being said. Do you think the process, in more mechanistic approaches, of trying to make things still, and believing that in doing that that you will gain more knowledge about it, is part of the problem? Well, it’s always been strange to me that in order to understand something you dissect it and you take the pieces apart. And certainly that can be a useful process, I suppose, but then you study the pieces, but you don’t look at the force that’s animating the whole being, and you don’t see how the pieces are connected first, though the logic of how everything hangs together is telling of the immensity of the creative, dynamic source. Science to me is really about studying the pieces but disregarding the life force itself. There’s a deep connection, in your poetry, between memory and reÂ�Â� sponsibility. Could you tell me a little more about that?\n\nBecoming the Thing Itself\n\n13\n\nThe word “responsibility” in terms of poetry tends to freak out the American poet. The idea that we have a responsibility for what we say often feels like a steel jacket to the American Dream poet, where everything is available to you, and the land is yours for the taking. There’s still sort of that attitude, I think, with poetry, or even with anything Indian, where it’s there for the taking, and it just doesn’t really work that way. I keep remembering a quote from Luci Tapahonso, and she said it in Navajo, but I can’t remember the Navajo: “The sacred is on the tip of the tongue.” The Disney American mind believes it can get something for nothing, that riches and fame are the end goal and describe success. But things don’t come free. There’s a payment for everything that you do. If you write something, something has to be offered in return. And that’s part of the dynamic process. You can’t just take. But there’s a whole process to that, there’s also giving back, and I think that’s part of the responsibility, too. Ideas and images, in the way they come through, they’re given to you, you’re part of the process. Certainly writing is a way of giving it back. But there is a larger responsibility. Certainly I write because it delights me, and that’s at the root of any artist, that the form, and moving within that form, delights you. But I’m also aware that there are certain things I can’t write about, mostly ceremonial. But not to have permission to write about them doesn’t make me feel stymied or censored. It’s just that there are some things that are sacred, and beyond writing. And that just don’t go into words. And some places are sacred, not meant for non-ceremonial or nontribal members. Many Americans just don’t accept this, though they certainly wouldn’t want us putting highways across their altars and pulpits. “I’m an American, I can do anything I want. I can write about anything I want. I can give myself an Indian name if I want.” And so on. Acknowledging that there’s a responsibility to be silent, in some spaces, would you also say there is a time when a poet is charged with a reÂ�Â� sponsibility to speak? There’s that great poem from the bible in Ecclesiastes that encapsulates this: “A time to be born, a time to die, a time for everything under 14\n\nint e rvie w s\n\nthe seasons,” that the Byrds made into a song so long ago. For poetry, silence is a tool that is just as important as words. I believe the role of the poet is truthteller. And you follow the poem to the truth. You cannot commandeer the poem. It doesn’t work that way. Writing is about a tenth of what poetry is—maybe another part of this question is censorship, that is, most Americans believe that they should have access to anything in the world they want; it’s their birthright as Americans, and they are insulted when they are turned away from a ceremony, or told that certain texts or songs are dangerous and belong to certain families or people. They can write about anything they want and it has nothing to do with integrity. Sometimes integrity means being silent, about particular songs or texts because they are to be opened only in certain places or under certain conditions because otherwise they won’t have life, or might diminish or endanger life. I’m interested in how dynamicism affects your approach to poetry, because there are people out there for whom dynamicism, in poetry, means never revising, and that’s clearly not the case with your work. No, I think you have a responsibility to craft to the best of your ability. I think you have a responsibility to build something that’s well-crafted. Something that will stand the test of time or the test of weather, doubt [laugh]—all of that. Many of my younger students or less experienced students still have a resistance to craft. They hang on to the first draft as their only draft because they are still amazed that they gave birth to anything. And what they’ve given birth to isn’t always poetry. We all have a responsibility to craft. Allen Ginsberg had this famous quote, “First thought, best thought.” The first thought might carry the seed of the thing, but the first swipe of sandpaper doesn’t necessarily make the most elegant sculpture, and maybe I’m after a certain kind of elegance in the middle of the wreck. And then I complicate the wreck with a saxophone and singing. Maybe some people just have a different approach, and sometimes it works for them. I don’t go to contests or anything, though I have been invited to perform at some performance slam poetry events, and there I am at the HBO Def Poetry Jam, and it’s like I’ve stepped out of another time and place. When I’m in those spaces I know I’m not a performance poet. My stuff is resonating at another level. It’s not hard, fast, or punchy and showy. I’m not going\n\nBecoming the Thing Itself\n\n15\n\na hundred and fifty miles into a wall of excitement. I’m not riding the ride for sheer entertainment. So in terms of crafting, I’m wondering how this dynamicism informs the revision process. I’m still not sure how to answer this. I can scramble around and pull up “Fear Song,” or “I Give You Back,” as it was first called—the poem was larger than me when I wrote it in my mid- to late twenties. The poem has its own life. Even though you’re bringing in the thinking part of the mind, to help craft, you still have the other part involved. It’s almost like the poem is there and you kind of scrape away the things that don’t work to unearth it. Do you see the process of revision taking the poet further away from the truth, or bringing them closer? I see revision as the road to the deepest heart of the poem. It’s what writing poetry is about. I chip away and don’t always know what I’m going to find. I’ve had some poems appear almost, but not quite, done, and others I wrangle with for years. But I’ve never had a poem just stand up in one draft and say “Here I am.” Well, revision isn’t necessarily a written process, either. No, it’s not always written, and sometimes the revision goes on before the pen hits the paper or we tap it out on the screen. Li Young Lee once said that he revises long before the pen hits the paperâ•‹.â•‹.â•‹.â•‹he works on it before it becomes physical. I wanted to ask a couple of questions about “the crow and the snake.” I very much enjoyed this piece. I felt it, on one level, as a political allegory, but by using the snake in the way you do, are you playing with the Judeo-Christian creation myth? I hadn’t really considered the Christian creation story analogy, but it works. There are levels to the piece, and then the impetus. I wanted to see what would happen to the overrun of birds who had designated the backyard as their gathering place. There were often literally hundreds who appeared there. So it started with a big old rubber snake. But of course, that’s the literal. Christianity, of the sort practiced in the 16\n\nint e rvie w s\n\nUnited States, ascribes the fall of humans to a snake, and a woman! In a Mvskoke reading, a snake in a tree would immediately tell you something powerful and strange was afoot, so to speak, and you would get away. Eating of the tree of knowledge could give you power but it would require tests and fasting. Adding an underworld animal to a middle world being, a tree complicates it. The myth doesn’t embrace, however. It excludes the power of the snake, the power of women, and the power of the earth mother. And it’s a crow who comes back and puzzles over the story and finds a different conclusion. And notice I link “who” with crow, not “that” or “it.” A relationship is made here, not the one of Adam dominating the world and having the power to dominate. That crow had such depth—could have been a poet crow! That question of domination, as opposed to engagement, is something that shows up in a lot of your work, and it seems to be at the root of poetry, for you. What practical steps do you take to engage the world? Or are those steps practical? I think that a lot of it is very, very basic. I suppose it’s—if you were to have a Mvskoke Creek University, you know, that’s 101. I noticed a shift in my practice of being a human when I was seven years old and went to public school. Actually, this is when I started going to church, too, lured by cookies and Kool-Aid. There was no place for who I had been, or who I was, except the artist or the singer in art or music classes. I went from a world of music, a world in which I could see things, in which I could see the movements of energy between people and plants, or animals. A very engaged and alive relationship with this world we’re in. In school the world I was taught was relatively flat, but brilliant in conception and variety. And in that world there were no females, there were no Indians, and even though half the class was Indian we read that there were no more Indians. In this world only the mental and rote learning had a place. Except in art and music classes, which I loved. In the first poem of A Map to the Next World, “Songline of Dawn,” you seem to be exploring a particular take on our relationship with the gods. There was one line that struck me in particular, “Protect them, oh gods of the scarlet light / who love us fiercely despite our acts\n\nBecoming the Thing Itself\n\n17\n\nof stupidity / our utter failings.” My first reaction to this line was to ask myself how the Judeo-Christian tradition might shift if one were to reconceive of its god as being fallible. In the spiritual world you’re describing in your work, how do you think the gods might be seen regarding their own fallibility? Are they less than perfect? I think so. In the poem “A Map to the Next World,” a star was once a human, or had a very human experience, and possibly failed. If the Sun was perfect it wouldn’t be here either. [laugh] I’ve been called a Buddha-ist, but it’s very Mvskoke, or Creek. And then I have my own track—we all do in our approach. Traditional people in my tribe have always allowed for that—it defines us as humans. I guess I do have a little bit of a problem with organized religions, generally, but everything has its place. It’s not just the commercial aspects, but the forcedenrollment-or-you-go-to-hell aspects. Doesn’t make common sense, or even uncommon beautiful sense. How do you understand the relationship to god changing, if that god is conceived of as being fallible? I think we can only experience god, for the most part, by the size of our minds or by the size of our hearts. Every once in a while there can be a point or moment of grace. Like an incredible poem you read or hear [laugh], you know? That suddenly opens everything up. Or a piece of art, or a small but incredible act of kindness in somebody that opens everything up. Or experiencing someone’s death with them, or experiencing somebody’s birth with them. We are then opened to our utter humanness, which paradoxically links us to our experience of god. But then god is certainly that, is through everything, I mean, it’s the life force. It’s that life force that animates absolutely everything. What creation myth did you grow up with, as a member of the Mvskoke Â� tribe? The most predominant creation story is Christian. Probably more than half the tribe is Christian, so the major story involves Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden. We have more than one version of a Mvskoke creation story because the tribe is made up of several smaller groups. I’ve heard several versions, from several different entities within the tribe. I’ve been pulling everything together, trying to make sense of it 18\n\nint e rvie w s\n\nall, and in my family it appears that our tribal creation story might have us coming thousands of years ago from Polynesia, up from South America into Mexico, and then over. I believe current anthropology might even back this up. Volcanoes figure into the story, as does the Pacific Ocean. In the Mvskoke tradition, Rabbit is the trickster, is that right? Yes, and Rabbit, the trickster, was there at the beginning of creation. And Rabbit is neither male nor female. Neither is the overall deity or overseer of all creation. Christianity invests heavily in making all the rulers male. One of the first things the churches did was to change or destroy our narratives. Female deities were turned into male, if they survived the destruction. A trinity of a father, son, and holy ghost leaves out any female presence or power at the beginning of creation. Strange. In this world there can be no creative power without the female force. Mary was always there as an afterthought, and was only there as a virgin, not as a fully grown woman [laugh], so to speak, and not as a female deity or power. So that premise, for me, is quite faulty. And it doesn’t work for me that, again, a male was given dominion over the land. Everything comes down to common sense. It doesn’t make sense. Earth is larger than humans in size and consciousness. We’re guests on this earth. Humans are just part of a larger creation. If it so happens we were given dominion, or males were—and I don’t believe this at all and it’s one reason I walked away from the church at thirteen—then we certainly won’t have it next time around. We’ve done nothing but rape the earth of its resources and don’t even turn around. We forget to say thank you. On that same line, to go back to the poetry here, the process of creation suggests for some, a creator/creation relationship similar to that relationship conceived of between god and universe. Do you see these two relationships as being similar? Yes, I do. I believe that we are creators in every moment, with every thought, word and deed. I don’t imagine myself as god creating a universe. [laugh] I guess I should say that. I don’t think of that literally. There’s a certain immensity, or eternalness about god and creation, and then here’s the little human poet creating the human poem. So\n\nBecoming the Thing Itself\n\n19\n\nthere’s another step, or a few steps, left out. But the impulse is very similar. In light of the similarities between these relationships, what are your views regarding the possibility of perfection within the discipline of poetry? Well, I don’t know that perfection follows humans around. This isn’t the perfect world, though some moments are near perfect, and I’ve read some near-perfect poems. They haven’t been mine. There are moÂ�Â� ments, but I don’t know that humans are capable of perfection. In previous interviews, you’ve made note of what appears to be a key difference between classical European conceptions of art and Native American conceptions of same, characterizing it as follows: “In a NaÂ�Â� tive context art was not just something beautiful to put up on the wall and look at; it was created in the context of its usefulness for people.” How do you see poetry being useful in the context of present day America? Poetry doesn’t appear to be useful or in use to mainstream America. It is the least-read genre, along with plays. And fewer and fewer people are buying books or going to the library. Yet, some people do read, continue to read, to take time to delve into questions of the soul, and how those questions are constructed. Poetry is very alive in oral venues: slam poetry, ceremonial poetry, song poetry. Performance poetry is usually wrapped around narrative, word play with a big hit of sensationalistic techniques. Some of it can be quite stunning and amazing. Patricia Smith is someone who straddles written and oral. Often it’s poetry as testimony of the soul of these times. Much of it isn’t pretty or rarified, but most life here isn’t—I guess what I’m trying to say is that much of it appears to be urban, though the slam movement has made its way to the reservations, to Hopiland and Navajoland. Especially rap. As far as usefulness literally, I’ve written poems whose purpose is to move into the world and effect change. I’ve written a poem to get rid of fear. Another, “Rainy Dawn,” becomes a poem to usher girlhood to womanhood transformation and to bring rain. I have a difficult time assembling some larger statement on the state of American\n\n20\n\nint e rvie w s\n\npoetry. It’s alive. We’re alive and we’re singing. The standards appear to be slipping, however—but, overall, written or oral, poetry describes the shape and size of the soul in America in these times. On the question of written and oral forms of poetry, you’ve said, in the past, “I believe that written language was, in many ways, a devolution of the communication process. You lose human contact. With written communication, you gain the ability to lie more easily.” Do you see the written word as a method of controlling others? I think words, yes, have the ability to control. It depends on who’s speaking them, it depends on the intent. I think of pure communication as communication beyond words. When there is nothing between speaker and audience, no misunderstandings, no lies, no hidden Â�agendas—there’s no need for translation. When we speak and are in the presence of each other, that is, poet and audience, for instance, there’s also communication that happens beyond words—the speaker and audience both are part of the poem, energetically, literally. Books are wonderful inventions, as is the ability to translate poems to the page, and read them laterâ•‹.â•‹.â•‹.â•‹as if they were freeze-dried. I love being able to carry books around and have them available for reading whenever I want—but something is lost here, the context, the voice, the performance. We get farther and farther away from each other with each step of so-called progress, yet, paradoxically we are brought together from far distances. But of course, the intent can get lost in context. Words are an expression of spirit—and poetry is written/spoken expression at its most distilled. Maybe in this country for most people the link has been broken between poetry and an individual’s intimate experience of poetry. And in my tribe and with many indigenous people, words on paper are suspect because they’ve been used to sign away land and take away children. They’re still being used in courts of law to steal. And people who write are usually seen as making money off their writing or off the tribe by their writing, so they’re suspect, their motives are suspect. There’s an early Noni Daylight poem, “Someone Talking,” in which Noni is describing a feeling and she can’t think of the word, and then\n\nBecoming the Thing Itself\n\n21\n\nshe thinks of the word and it’s “Milky Way.” And that’s the word for what she’s feeling. This particular theme comes through a number of times, where you seem to be comparing experience with words. It seems that you’re saying that your idea of poetry is much broader than what many people would allow it to be. Oh, I think so. I’m grappling to express what might be a different experience of poetry, or maybe it’s the same, but different words, a slightly different context. To the point that it seems like the stars themselves could be described as a poem. Yes, at some point, and maybe the ultimate purpose of the poem, is to become the thing itself, rather than naming it. Do you think they’re a better poem? Sometimes, yes. [laugh] There’s one image—the Sandia Mountains, as seen from the Albuquerque airport—that shows up in your poetry over and over again. The Sandia Mountains for years were my guardians. They were the magnetic center as I lived in New Mexico, mostly Albuquerque, for most of my life. I’m excited that I will return there this fall and every fall to teach a semester at the University of New Mexico. These show up way back in What Moon Drove Me to This, in the poem “I am a Dangerous Woman,” which describes going into an airport security check. And that was way back when those checkpoints were really benign. But I didn’t consider them benign then. They were obstructions to free movement, and again, it made no sense as 99.99 percent of us aren’t terrorists. If I had to write that poem now it would be twice as long and very angry. In one of the prose pieces in A Map to the Next World, “sudden awareness,” the same place shows up. You’re talking about what might be going on in your mind while dying, and how some of the thoughts coming to you, stupid things like the Pepsodent jingle. 22\n\nint e rvie w s\n\n[laugh] I know all of those, that’s horrifying to me. You know how you can get stuck on a jingle, or some kind of meaningless repetition. And it just carries you on out. [laugh] But in this piece, you have the place between the security checkpoint and the plane as the last image. I’ve always had a problem with transition points, for example, before the checkpoint and after, borders of countries, the place between waking and sleeping, dreaming and waking, starting to write and writing, and so on. I have a relatively new poem, now a song, inspired by watching the sun rise in the Albuquerque airport. It’s a poem, “Morning Song,” on Native Joy for Real: “The red dawn is rearranging the earth, thought by thought, beauty by beauty.” It’s a song now. Does that mention the Albuquerque airport? No it doesn’t, though that’s where it started. This is an example of where the personal story doesn’t really matter: the poem, or song, is as it is at that moment, but it wouldn’t have happened without Albuquerque, the airport, the impending birth of a granddaughter, the impending death of a beloved Sioux man. The things that have happened in America to change those security checks, how have they affected your writing? Maybe what I’ve seen is what’s been underground, what’s been bubbling beneath the surface, or boiling beneath the surface of American consciousness all along, it’s just been opened. You think about what this society is coming to when the children kill each other. These killings are a terrible poem, a comment on the state of the American soul. This is capped off by the very raw and recent Red Lake killings by a child. What have we come to when children are killing each other? The killings are a cry of desperation on behalf of the family, the nation, the child. They are cries of defeat. This is connected to the ability to understand and create metaphor really being lost. Most language use is for buying or selling, or for commenting on manufactured stories, stories that don’t make connections between the children and their families, their families and communities, between smaller and larger communities of all life forms.\n\nBecoming the Thing Itself\n\n23\n\nDo you see these “cries of defeat” as being individual, or do you think it’s wider than that? The individual is linked to family, is linked to clan (which in my tribe makes certain relationships with plants, animals, people), and is linked to larger groups like town, city, state, country, then earth, then planetary system. All are occurring at the same time and are part of the intimate structure of a human being. Last night I was speaking with a Pueblo healer friend of mine about the earth medicines. The trees want to share as do the plants. And when we share with anyone, whether they are plant, animal, mineral, we make a familial relationship, or maybe the word is we acknowledge it, because it’s innately there. There are connections every which way, but it does distill itself in the intimate human experience. You linked violence between children with the loss of the ability to understand and create metaphor. Do you see our ability to engage metaÂ�phor as being an antidote for violence? To engage metaphor is to be inside these innate connections between human, sky, earth. Then, we are earth or as earth. We are not standing at a distance looking at earth and then selling earth. Violence occurs with distancing. Many of those coming up in the age of television and movies as the prime storytellers feel no connection between themselves and the ability to make stories. Violence isn’t real. But it’s ever present. I was recently talked into going to the American Hollywood movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith. I knew better. It was a vehicle to show off two American movie stars, to make money. There was no story to speak of—the movie consisted of many head and body shots and a barrage of special effects: violence. The stars come out of tremendous violence untouched, or rather, retouched makeup, clothes. They win in the end, they always do. There’s no connection between this and their lives in these times. And no one can ever live up to the beauty of these humans whose images have been manipulated by light and makeup. Violence is part of the human landscape. The old stories, fairy tales, animal tales and such all include violence—but there are intimate connections between what occurs and meaning in our lives. Then you add being an Indian teenager to the equation and most likely you don’t look like these people, you don’t belong to the overriding story except as an 24\n\nint e rvie w s\n\nIndian. And every day you’re reminded of this. The suicide rate is outrageous in Indian country. Many deaths that aren’t counted as suicide are probably covert suicide, like car wrecks. Do you think there’s been a real change in atmosphere, or would you argue that it’s just a more vocal expression of what was already there? Recently a friend who’s been doing everything in her life she can think of to escape the truth of her history, her family, to duck under the pain, with smoke, drink, lovers, the usual—made a small movement to get up from a sitting position, from a slope near a river about two in the morning, and her knee literally exploded. Suddenly. She didn’t fall, there was no apparent impact, just the usual movement associated with standing up. I told her, it didn’t just happen. This has been in the works for the last few years as she’s carried immense grief, from the death of an important relative-ally, the death of her childhood, the pressures she’s carried from her family’s expectations and guilting. It’s like termites eating out a piece of wood, then the house falls; 9/11 is like that. The United States has been involved for years, since the takeover of this country, in imperialistic forays into the world for territory, for resources, goods, workers. The bruise grows, then suddenly there’s an attack. It appears to have “just happened.” It didn’t. That’s not to say that I agree with it. Many, many innocent lives were destroyed. We were all changed. It was the built-up charge of suppression, and maybe deals gone bad between U.S. leadership and particular families in the Middle East. And so it appeared to happen suddenly, but there’s a trail that goes way back, like roots. They lead directly from the event to the White House, to Saudi Arabia, the heads of multinational corporations. I feel like I’m in a dysfunctional family in this country. We all see what’s happening, but many are pretending to not see, because the truth appears so devastating. So they pretend nothing happened, or no, not our country, our daddy. We’ve found ourselves as participants in the children’s story, The Emperor’s New Clothes. At the heart of the myth of the American Dream story is cowboysand-Indians. It’s dark against light, good against evil with the white guys or European/Christian ideas being the good and evil being the socalled primitive or earth ways and those who practice those ways, or have darker skin. And anyone who isn’t Euro-Christian is an Indian.\n\nBecoming the Thing Itself\n\n25\n\nThe military not-so-code word for the battlefield in Iraq or during the Gulf War is/was Indian Country. The Iraqis are the Indians, the U.S. military the cowboys. This is the root assumption that underlies American education, most religious organizations. It shapes the process of thinking and being in this time and place. Classical traditions imply European, yet we have many classical traditions in this country: Navajo, Mvskoke, for instance. Cotton Mather called the Indians “devils.” We’re still being treated as devils. I never heard or saw the devil until I went to church. We are in the middle of religious wars, and the U.S. religious right is one of the main instigators. I grew up in Oklahoma. I know the story intimately! And because of the regime that’s in place, those people have power. It’s a false power, but a very earthly power. But power is a tricky thing. Try picking up a live wire. If you can handle it and plug it in you can light a city. “There is music here,” Clifton suggested. Indeed, there is. And within that music sings many messages. Be still for a moment. Listen.\n\n26\n\nint e rvie w s\n\n!@ Music, Poetry, and Stories Returning to the Root Source\n\n[Interview with Rebecca Seiferle, 2008]\n\nThere are, as it were, two different landscapes present in these poems you’ve given us: the landscape of Hawai‘i, which seems a landscape of healing and blessing, and the landscape of the American West, which is preoccupied with the historical wounding of the Native American peoples and also has aspects of a more difficult healing through the blessing of song. Would you like to talk about the importance that place, those particular intersections of human reality with the earth, has in your work? Lately I’ve been immersed in a revisioning, rethinking of my relationship to landscape. This is most definitely related to the dramatic shift in landscape and place that occurred when I left New Mexico, Oklahoma, (and even Los Angeles) for Hawai‘i six years ago. I crossed the Pacific to an island nation. The shift was abrupt. Though I was familiar with the people and place of Hawai‘i, to move there was another thing. I moved to be with someone with whom I have a close kinship and with whom I enjoy a sense of peacefulness. I also moved to the water, and took up outrigger canoe paddling. And since I was a child I have always wanted to be in the Pacific. I didn’t really know too much about it but would always dream about Tahiti, Hawai‘i, even New Guinea. What can happen, though, with such shifts, you come to know what you’ve left behind even more intimately because you have to imagine and remember intensely to bring it close. Sometimes you do that by writing, as Leslie Silko did when she wrote Ceremony while living in Ketchikan, Alaska, far from Laguna Pueblo. Ketchikan\n\nhas one of the highest rainfall averages in the country. While it rained and rained, she wrote her desert home back around her. Hawai‘i is a great refuge for my spirit. I paddle. I help out with horses. Practice singing and horn. And write music, poetry, and stories that always return me to the root source from those birthing places. I continue to feel that pull and connection to those lands which have nourished and challenged me on this journey. As I grow older those places grow larger and larger. It seems to me that there is an opening in your Hawai‘i poems to a greater sense of peacefulness and a feeling blessed by what is. Not that it wasn’t present in your earlier work, but it seems to flower forth here in these poems. How has living in Hawai‘i affected you? Probably the largest shift in landscape is water. The island of O’ahu is relatively small. The Pacific is immense. I am learning water. And the water might be beautiful but it is also powerful and dangerous. When you go out in the water, you have to be aware and know that anything can happen. There are shifts in currents and weather. You might start out your paddle in flat water, then struggle on the way back with wind and breaking waves. The most peaceful moments have been out on the water just after dawn, with sea turtles alongside, and once in a while pods of dolphins. The most frightening was having a sudden rogue wave break over, a wave that could have broken the small canoe. It didn’t, but threw me out of the boat. I made it back on and we got out of there. It’s about learning to flow and not fight. I also like having my favorite fruits and flowers in the yard: mangos, papayas, bananas, hibiscus, coconut, and frangipani. I have a great love and respect for Hawaiian poetry, which isn’t separated from dance and music. It’s all together. Poetry, music and dance came into the world together. Will go out that way, together, too. The Southwest is, of course, the most arid of environments, the depths of a long-ago vanished ocean. Do you feel moving to a world of water has allowed you more fluidity and fluency of poetic being? I’ve always noted waterlines of the old oceans on the mesas and mountains in the Southwest. Often they are very visible. Too, I’ve often\n\n28\n\nint e rvie w s\n\nimagined the skies there as oceans. But yes, when water is the prevailing influence everything in the atmosphere carries its essence of being. There is an ease with the mythologies, the stories, of the Hawaiian people in these poems. Do you feel a natural affinity for these myths? Despite the military takeover (the military controls and “owns” over 25 percent of the lands of Hawai‘i) and the population growth of outsider groups, the overall cultural sense in Hawai‘i is clearly Hawaiian. The myths, stories are still fluid and are present in the mountains, fields, rivers and oceans. They are in the names, the dances, in everything. They remind me of my own tribal stories. I am particularly struck by the speaker’s honest confrontation with her own anger, and turning away from it. Given the state of the world today, would you like to talk about how poetry has been a part of your turning away from “the war club” into song, which while it does not disavow the justified anger or deny the ways in which people have been afflicted, is another way of being? Without poetry, without song, without dance I would not be alive. Nor would any of us. We come from root cultures in which song, poetry, stories, art was something that belonged to all of us. They were not “spectator sports,” as they are mostly in this over-culture. Everyone sang, everyone, danced, made art. It was/is integral to being human. Now it seems reserved for the elite, for those who can afford the time. We need expression to feel connected, not just to our communities but to who we are down deep, past the eyes and the gullet, to the heart and the incredible depth past it. You play the saxophone and perform your works with a band. How has performing music altered your sense of writing poetry? Do you feel there’s a natural affinity between these arts, a complementary quality? I’ve been working hard in the studio on my next CD, Native Joy for Real. I am singing on this album, playing horn, and doing some speaking of poetry. After this album I believe most of my energy will be more in the direction of music. Poetry has always felt a little lonely, needed some kind of accompaniment. And I’ve gone back, in a way, to\n\nMusic, Poetry, and Stories\n\n29\n\nmy roots, to the singing. That was the original impetus of the poetry, and of the sax, to find a way to sing. I still want my poems to stand up on their own. Rebecca Seiferle was awarded a Lannan Literary Fellowship in 2004. Her fourth poetry collection, Wild Tongue (Copper Canyon, 2007) won the 2008 Grub Street National Book Prize in Poetry.

Seiferle is the founding editor and publisher of the online international poetry journal, The Drunken Boat, www.thedrunkenboat.com.\n\n30\n\nint e rvie w s\n\n!@ Exploring the Depths of Creation and Meaning [Interview with Simmons Buntin, September 2006]\n\nBarry Lopez recently said that critics, academics, and the media ask “questions about what I intended to do, to say, to achieve in my writing, as though the writing is intentional or purposive. They think that you sit down to write down what it is that you think about something. Writing does not work like this at all. I sit and write, and in the writing I am simply present—with the thought, the place, the idea. It arrives.” Does your writing work in the same way, or do you approach writing as a particular project, with something particularly to say? As an American Indian, a woman, a global citizen, is there a continuous message you must relay? I am in agreement with Barry. I am part of a larger process. I don’t have control over it. I do have control (mostly) about being prepared, ready, and am willing to put in the time and commitment to crafting what is given. If I am going to give a message then I don’t do it as a writer, poet, or songwriter. Doesn’t mean that some message or sense isn’t made of it all. I am driven to explore the depths of creation and the depths of meaning. Being Native, female, a global citizen in these times is the root, even the palette. I mean, look at the context: human spirit versus the spirits of the earth, sky, and universe. We are part of a much larger force of sense and knowledge. Western society is humancentric. We’re paying the price of foolish arrogance, of forgetfulness. While acknowledging that you have learned to respect various artistic genres and “those who have mastered them and brought them\n\nto another level of accomplishment,” you have also said that “the creative stream isn’t strictly bound by genres or expression.” Books like A Map to the Next World: Poems and Tales, provide an excellent example—alternating poems and tales to create a four-part story. When you were writing the poems and tales of this book, were they created in largely the same order as they appear in the book, or were the poems written separately—grouped—from the tales? Or perhaps differently altogether? Is there a difference in the construction of a mixed-genre collection versus a single genre? Should writing programs encourage more mixed or cross-genre writing, promoting or at least accounting for the ebb and flow of the creative stream? The poems were created separately and not in the order as they appear. The tales—some were created separately and most after I pulled together the shape of the book. What moved me to venture in that direction was to try for some kind of sense of orality in a written text. Written text is, to me, fixed orality. I tried this first in The Woman Who Fell from the Sky. Of course the poems can exist by themselves. They do not need explanations. The prose accompaniments are part of the overall performance. I expanded it in Map.â•‹.â•‹.â•‹.â•‹I am always aware of several voices and each has its own root of impulse and quality. The poetry voice exists in timelessness. When I try to force it to a contemporary arch tone—it fails me, though I did recently write a hip-hop type poem. Still, the voice had the same overarching tone and voice, a voice that is wiser than me. Then there’s the more narrative voice—and it’s more contemporary. Often my poetry voice is like a voice coming from stonesâ•‹.â•‹.â•‹.â•‹and so on. Each book is a different experiment or expression. Secrets from the Center of the World was my first mixed-genre book. Photographs by Stephen Strom and my poetic prose pieces were together in response to the landscape near the Four Corners area. As far as writing programs teaching cross-genre—some encourage experimentation and some discourage any leaning past the middle line of form. It’s up to each writer to find and follow his or her own direction. You will either have support, or you won’t have support. And your vision might coincide with taste and it might not. Taste and movements come and go.\n\n32\n\nint e rvie w s\n\nIn the “classics” of modern American poetry, and often in the teaching of poetry, poetry as literature is separate from music, both lyrics and composition. While there is a certain music to poetry, and poetry derives from the spoken word, the general conclusion has been: poetry is not music and music is not poetry. Your work with your band Poetic Justice, where you bring your poetry to music or alternatively music to your poetry, suggests otherwise (for example, “She Had Some Horses” in the book of the same name is also a song on the album Letter from the End of the Twentieth Century). What is the relationship between music and poetry, generally and in your work? Does the heritage of music in American Indian culture provide for a bridge between the two genres in your work, as opposed to the historical separation of music and poetry in modern Western verse? The roots of poetry lead to music. Music will often be found yearning for singers. Poetry is a sound art. I happened on the direct relationship between poetry and music when I realized that most of the poetry in my tribe, and with most peoples of the world, isn’t found in books, it’s oral. Then I began to consider how to make that bridge—I didn’t do so with a direct plan—it was a natural outgrowth of being a contemporary Mvskoke poet who had picked up a saxophone. Poetic Justice was just a start. I collaborated first with Susan M. Williams on the music for “For Anna Mae Pictou Aquash.” Then we added her brother John to the band, a bass player, to round it out. Then it developed from there. For that configuration I read my poems, performed sax, and helped create the songs. We had to find a crossing between song structures and my poems. My poems don’t usually behave and conform to known structures—many are conscious hybrids. The same goes with music. Then after Poetic Justice (I disbanded Poetic Justice to go out on my own with a band), I began singing and this demanded a different shape to the poem. Some of my poems lend themselves to singing, like “Grace” (featured on my last music album, Native Joy for Real), and others to a mix of singing, speaking, and even a form of chant-singing. I have written some songs as lyrics. There is a difference. I’ve transformed some poems to lyrics. The singing voice demands a difference in rhythm, pacing, beginning and end sounds. Right now I am work-\n\nExploring the Depths of Creation and Meaning\n\n33\n\ning on translating some of my poems into the Mvskoke language, then into songs for singing. This is an ongoing process of discovery. You have said, and many artists have echoed, that we are “within a dominant culture that doesn’t value the artist.” Indeed, public funding for art of all types continues to come under fire on a regular basis. Is it the artist’s responsibility to work to change our culture so it does value the artist? Is the artist responsible for more even than that: for bearing witness, making public, and demanding action to resolve the inequalities of our world: social, economic, environmental, and otherwise? How do artists engender compassion, or even overarching compassion, as in the Mvskoke word, vnokeckv? In this current political climate, the individual, or the artist, is looked upon with suspicion. If you don’t fit squarely into “Christian,” “family,” or any other certified “safe” category (that is, not white, not identifiably male, female, married, straight, and so on) then you are in danger and you can be subject to great scrutiny and judgment. As I reread what I have written I ask myself if I have exaggerated, but I don’t believe I have—suspicion and fear have grown in direct correspondence with the atrocities and human-rights violations inflicted by those in apparent power in the government, a government handin-hand with Christian fundamentalists. I am often in Oklahoma, my birthplace, for family and tribal events. I have noticed a definite spike in the climate of fear, marked by fundamentalist Christians who believe their way is the only way, by God. They’ve always believed this way but are increasingly self-righteous and secure in their power. So how do we engender compassion in the middle of all this? Compassion doesn’t depend on the reaction or response of others. It is, in its own right. I believe compassion gives the most overarching vision. Then, everything can fit, somehow. I’m trying to figure it out like everyone else. Art is a way to contribute to the figuring out. The artist bears witness, and can bring fresh vision into the world through art, to regenerate culture, to demand an accounting. I think of the recent exhibition at the Honolulu Academy of Arts by Hawaiian artist Kaili Chun. Her installation Nau Ka Wae, or The Choice Belongs to You, was a groundbreaking and award-winning meditation on compassion—native stones, which are living and considered to have their 34\n\nint e rvie w s\n\nown voices in Hawai‘i (and other native traditions) and appeared in the installation as a sort of consciousness. You migrate back and forth between New Mexico and Hawai‘i. As residences and as havens, what does each mean to you? Is there sustenance or power in the migration itself? There has to be power or sustenance in migration or the world would be without humans, most plants, and animals. I have to find meaning in whatever I do—or even make meaning of meaninglessness. Not everything fits. Most things or ideas in this place don’t fit seamlessly. Both New Mexico and Hawai‘i were and are havens for me. I fled Oklahoma as a teenager. New Mexico gave me back my voice and continues to provide ongoing vision. My great-aunt Lois Harjo, whom I was especially close to, also spent much time there as a painter, inspired by the New Mexico Indian art scene. I followed behind her in this, and in my love for the arts. Hawai‘i has given me the gift of water and I am continually inspired and challenged by the spirit of the Hawaiian people and land. We are painfully witnessing the destruction of this paradise. Actually, the Hawaiians and Mvskoke people are related. We each have stories that link us with each other. You have stated that as an American Indian it is your responsibility— and indeed any American Indian’s responsibility—to “pass on culture and to pass on hope.” You have also noted that your primary audience is Indian country. Yet you also have a large non-Native following. Have you found resistance to you or your work from other American Indians because of its wide readership beyond those in Indian country? Alternatively, does resistance come from non-Natives because of your origins or your primary audience? If so, how do you respond—or is a response appropriate? My audience crosses over. There is always resistance to anyone who is out there doing anything that crosses boundaries: of genre, culture, country, language, etc. That’s just how it is. And there are always those who embrace you. I trust the work will find its way, just as I have to trust the process. Most of the resistance has come from those who find me not Indian enoughâ•‹.â•‹.â•‹.â•‹or too Indian. Or those who dislike women who speak out. Or those who find anyone carrying a\n\nExploring the Depths of Creation and Meaning\n\n35\n\nsaxophone and dirtying the precious water of verse dangerous. Is any response necessary? Have you had the opportunity to perform or work with native peoples in other regions—Central or South America, for example? Is there an increasing global context to the preservation of indigenous peoples and places—manifested either in literature and music and other arts, or in other contexts altogether? Last year I performed in Argentina. That experience was mixed, except for the meeting with native people in the village of Amaicha. There were so many points of connection. The village was a mirror of an Isleta or Laguna village. The people looked the same, as did their houses and art. I felt I was in the houses of relatives of my Pueblo friends of the north. I also went to Cusco, and what emerged there was knowledge that this area was a navel for many tribal nations who migrated north. I saw the connection between Pueblos and the Mvskoke people. It is ancient. At the Association of Writers and Writing Programs Austin conference’s Joy Harjo tribute in March 2006, you read poetry, played saxoÂ� phone, chanted, and sang. Do you have a favorite “genre” of performance? Reading/singing against live music, as with Poetic Justice, for example? Or, like much of your work, is the total of these performance types together greater than the sum of their individual parts? Do you envision incorporating filmed scenes into your live performances, given your filmmaking experience, as well? I prefer a live band behind me. (And again, for the record, I no longer perform with Poetic Justice, though I might revive the name again for my new configuration.) There’s also something fulfilling in the solo, naked voice performance. Yes, actually, I’m working on intersecting film and image with music and performanceâ•‹.â•‹.â•‹.â•‹right now. You have maintained a blog for three years now—a fairly long time for the medium. What made you decide to start blogging, and is the impetus the same three years later? Has your other writing, or who you read, changed because of your blog? Do you sense any change in\n\n36\n\nint e rvie w s\n\nliterature overall because of blogging, or perhaps rather because of the expansion of the Internet in general? I have kept an ongoing journal over the years. The blog is an expansion of it—with some editing. I don’t know that my writing has changed because of it—it’s what I’ve always done. The difference is that I am more aware of an audience, of readers—overall there’s an expanded awareness of the global. Before I went to school my world was vast because I lived for the most part in my imagination. It was a live thing, with as much texture and viability as what is called “real.” My spirit traveled all over the world. Songs and stories happened in the home, via humans, and sometimes books. Then my world became the school classroom and the discipline and rules, the path from the school to my home, then after that a job, or a family. Anything that happened anywhere else happened in books, and sometimes in the news. My imagination then was bound in books, in reading. Then movies ushered in the next level of reality, of expressive art. Videos followed. Then computers and the Internet, which came with an expanded awareness of the global. And with all this: less reading, fewer readers. Is this attributable to the Internet? Or, to the lack of ability to hear or believe the spoken voice? Or to engage the human voice and person intimately? What’s next, Joy Harjo? More poetry, more music, a book of stories, performance—and some wisdom, knowledge, and peace for all of us. Simmons B.

At what age did you know that you wanted to be an writer/artist/musician? I grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I knew from the beginning that I wanted to be an artist. My first urges were to draw and sing. My grandmother Naomi Harjo was a painter and we had her paintings in our house. I found great refuge in the act of drawing—to move into that creative space engaged my spirit in a way nothing else did at that very young age. I got in trouble for decorating the walls of the garage with chalk drawings. I also covered the closet of the kid’s bedroom with my art. My mother was the singer, so we had music and her voice often holding our home together. I loved listening, and loved singing—privately. When other girl children my age were making plans to be teachers, nurses and brides (yes, brides)—I was always the only one who wanted to be an artist. You have family connections in Alabama. Yes, I have family connections in Alabama. My great-great (and between two and three more greats) grandfather was Menawa, or Monahwee as we spell it in Oklahoma. He and the Redsticks fought Andrew Jackson at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. He was later removed to Oklahoma, despite his attempts to keep his people in their homelands in what is now known as Alabama and Georgia. My cousin George Coser, Jr. says he’s buried near Eufaula, Oklahoma, but recently I received an e-mail from someone from Alabama, I believe, claiming descendancy, who says Monahwee was buried in Kansas. Monahwee’s story is a story I wish to pursue for a full-length feature\n\nfilmâ•‹.â•‹.â•‹.â•‹. This whole western hemisphere is Indian country. There are amazing stories that form our history, but so much has been told by those who flatten and stereotype anything Indian. Often those who stereotype are our own people. Let’s talk about your time at the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA), the University of New Mexico (UNM), and the Iowa Writer’s Workshop. How did you feel about the workshop? Have your feelings changed with distance? This question could be a book. In fact, some of it will be. I’m currently working on a book of stories and many take place in those Indian school years, which was a time of great creative inspiration married with great despair. IAIA was an Indian boarding school run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1967 IAIA was a high school with a couple of years of postgraduate study. Students came from all over the United States—from Alaska, New York, Florida, everywhere. Many of us were from Oklahoma. We were all art majors from many different disciplines. I was there because of my artwork and at that time (my mother reminded me recently) I was drawing fashions. I had forgotten. She remembers that many of my designs later appeared in the fashion world. I had tapped into something. Later I became a drama and dance major and toured with one of the first all Native drama and dance troupes. I was one of the leads. This was a time of a tremendous awareness of change for Native peoples. We questioned"
