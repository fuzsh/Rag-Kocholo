        "text": "Dear Radio Babe: Wanted to send an update of our sports programming at WIBQ (1220 AM).\n\nWe are now an affiliate for Florida State football broadcasts. We're also carrying an NCAA college football game of the week on Saturday (at 3 p.m.) and an NFL doubleheader every Sunday at 1 and 4:15 p.m. We will carry the games to completion.\n\nWe are also broadcasting Lakewood Ranch football on Friday nights ... at 7:05 p.m. with the pre-game show; kickoff of the play-by-play starts at 7:30 p.m.\n\nWe also have the \"Sports Forum,\" which airs Monday-Friday ... noon to 2 p.m.\n\nThanks for keeping the radio column alive. Great job! -- Doug (Miles, 1220 AM producer and co-host/DJ)\n\nDear Doug: Radio Babe thanks you for the sports-data update. Fans always need to know where and when to tune in.\n\nR.B. also found out that former sports-talker Jake Jacobson of the defunct WAMR (1320 AM) and its \"Scott and Jake Show\" is re-teaming with his partner Scott Hayes.\n\nJacobson currently sits odd-man-out on WSRZ's (107.9 FM) \"The Morning Crew with David Jones & Christina Crane\" (he's not even mentioned on the program's Web site).\n\nHis final day of (non-) participation is next Monday.\n\nHayes is one of the four hosts of \"Sunny 1220's\" \"Sports Talk\" show. No word yet on the logistics of the Hayes/Jacobson collaboration.\n\nMJ declaration\n\nFolks who listen to WFLZ (93.3 FM) morning host MJ Kelli know that he recently baited listeners for days with an anticipated huge \"announcement.\"\n\nWhat it amounted to was the return of previous show personality Froggy 2, aka Kooz, who most recently annoyed evening listeners on WXTB's (97.9 FM) rock station.\n\nFroggy/Kooz apparently was an MJ staffer for several years until 2004 before delving into rock formats following the Top 40/pop/dance station run he did with MJ.\n\nFroggy's come full circle but unfortunately, promises to be \"dumber than ever.\" That's an aspiration.\n\nOver at WXTB (\"98 Rock\"), the weekday lineup is Big Rig from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., followed by Killabrew until 7 p.m. then Lauren 'til 10 p.m., when \"Loveline\" begins. Midnight to 6 a.m. is Sloar, then Buckethead starts out the days.\n\nCounting en Español\n\n\"The Top 40 Countdown,\" is a well-liked program on which the most popular songs in the country are counted down from 40 to numero uno -- popularized by Casey Kasem over the years.\n\nIncreasingly, however, popular radio markets aren't tuning into the Top 40 genre, or if they are, it's not via English-language stations.\n\nThe Latino Broadcasting Co., in concert with Westwood One, met this rising need by developing \"The Top 20 Latin-Urban Countdown.\"\n\nOn it, the energetic Latino host and reggaeton DJ Frankie Needles showcases the best hip-hop, R&B, reggae and Latin American music styles. The national, weekly two-hour program began in just four markets, one being \"La Nueva\" WYUU (92.5 FM), \"El Sonido Latino de Tampa Bay,\" Tampa's first Spanish-language FM station.\n\nHD-radio update\n\nAs high-definition radio continues its rollout, stations not only improve programming sound quality, but they also can easily produce two channels (minimum) of additional content co-existing within the same frequency.\n\nLong story short, this is possible because HD data occupies less space.\n\nOne nearby station adding to its current roster is Fort Myers' WXKB (103.9 FM) currently spinning Top 40, but 103.92 (Editor's note: When referring to HD channels, the bold or superscript \"2\" in a frequency is used) is programming its HD2 as a beachy-reggae multicast.\n\nOf course, one still needs an HD-capable radio to hear the differences and multicasts, but it's the thought that counts, isn't it?\n\nDirect queries and comments to Radio Babe c/o the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, P.O.
