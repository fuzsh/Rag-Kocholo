        "text": "For those of you who say/think you're being humanitarian and peace activists - THIS is what you're supporting. This is only one of hundreds of similar stories for over 1000 people who were executed, 240+ who were taken hostage to be r@ped, mvrd3d, t0rtur3d - some still. Hostage taking is a war crime and a crime against humanity. So is s3xu@l violence, so is targeting and k!ll!ng civilians. And this is g3n0c!dal intent. Defending yourself is NOT. Yes, every lost life is a tragedy - even a combatant - but intent is what separates a crime from causing a death accidentally. H@m-a$$ uses THEIR OWN PEOPLE as shields. For them, it's a strategy to get good pre$$ - so keep those likes and posts and money coming, which makes you complicit. War is terrible - don't start one, and don't be surprised when the attacked defends themselves and goes after the perpetrators and leaders. This is NOT about land, it's NOT \"freedom from oppression\" - they don't want a 2 state solution (they've had one since 2005 and look what they've done with that) - they just want ALL of Israel, and they want ALL Jews wiped off the planet (BTW, that's g3n0c!d3). But, make no mistake - YOU'RE ALL NEXT. #releasethehostages #standwithisrael #westisnext #westisnow #wakeupworld\n\nSutherland, M. E. (2023). Africanisms in the Caribbean Region: African Descendants’ Resistance to Enslavement and Subjugation in Post-Emancipation. Journal of Black Studies, 54(5), 355-373. https://lnkd.in/eKNNTZ6Z Abstract: This article explores the central role of Africanism in Africans’ revolts against enslavement in Haiti and Jamaica. There is an investigation into the memories of Africa that motivated the military leaders and the African masses in their insurrections or wars against their European enslavers in these countries. Hence, there is an investigation of Africanisms such as knowledge of governance and political organization, military training, code of military conduct, African cosmologies, and knowledge on the decentralization of power, among other African-derived values and beliefs that were learned in Africa. These Africanisms informed the military and other modes of resistance against European colonizers. There is also attention to traditional African spirituality. Evidence is presented on the influences of spiritual beliefs and practices on military incursions during the enslavement era and in post-emancipation culture. There is a discussion on Vodun, Legba, Kafou, Eshu, Obeah, and Anansi. There is an analysis of the factors that accounted for military success or failure in the enslaved Africans’ military wars or revolts against European enslavers in the countries being discussed. The current modes of resistance in post-emancipation are also addressed.\n\nTedx was one of the coolest experiences of my career thus far. As an artist and creative being able to speak about how the merging of different Afro-Carribean cultures has produced the fastest growing music genre today --Reggaeton-- was an honor. Why? I've been blessed to work on projects with some of the pionners reggae music. Never would I have thought I'd be sitting in a room listening to Ian and Roger Lewis talking about their late friend and colleague Bob Marley. Mind blowing! Never would I thought I'd be standing next to Mykal Rose (Reggaes first Grammy winning artist) having jolly conversation with him. As someone who is a part of the Jamacian diaspora and grew up in Latin America, it's amazing to see how a local music scene in Jamacia grew from the grassroots and was able to inspire muscians to create their own interpretation of reggae-dancehall with their own elements. Thus, I want to say this. Whatever discrepancies (because there are) about who did what or who influenced who are discussions that should be our focus. Whether it's Jamacia, Puerto Rico or Panama, our different music cultures coming together has shook the world. Small countries that has influenced global music and pop culture in a big is not an understatement. Let's celebrate this story with ourselves and to the world. #musicbusiness #musicians #musicmarketing #musicindustry\n\nMy Experience in Why #UpMarketClients prefer #Pianists Who Specialise in #Blues? Personally, I have specialised in #Blues Jazz #PianoMusic for Its emotional depth and authenticity. I have specifically played blues for close to two Decades. Firstly, Blues music is not called \"blue\" because of the color, but rather because of its emotional and lyrical content. Historically. ...Blues music often addressed themes of heartache, struggle, loss, and adversity, reflecting the challenges and experiences of African Americans during that era, including slavery, segregation, and discrimination. The term \"blues\" captures the emotional depth and expressive qualities of the music, which is known for its soulful and heartfelt lyrics. For me, Blues are a powerful and cathartic form of musical expression that resonates with people from diverse backgrounds and continues to be celebrated for its emotional depth and authenticity. These Clients prefer music with emotional depth. In this video I play a Blues classic. #Repost. #FollowMe #Connect #ContactMe. #AlbumComing #AlbumCooking #RBPhiriBlues Contact me for more on Blues Jazz at Robertbrian1045@gmail.com"
