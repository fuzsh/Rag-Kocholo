        "text": "about\n\nA weekly show with sketch comedians Rachel La Loca, Juan Bago, JFernz and Frank Nibbs that features improv bits, pranks, character segments, guest interviews and more. They are the the voice of Latinos today, and they are just starting to get loud! Get ready to hear a slew of voices, jokes on pop culture, personal and uplifting stories, and more from this group who’s natural chemistry is based on over 15 years of friendship. Packed with positivism and laughter, as well as interviewees who inspire, LOL is here to move Latinos forward, while making them laugh.\n\nWhen La Chancla Crosses the Line with Maritza Plasencia, LMFT\n\nLa chancla, which refers to a flip flop in Spanish, is a cultural discipline style that has evolved to be very symbolic. La chancla can also refer cords, cables, the belt, hangers, any item that can be used to inflict pain as a punishment. Often, it is also a trigger word and is a form of child abuse. In this special 1-hour sesión, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, Maritza Plascencia shares her personal experience with la chancla, and dives deeper with her professional knowledge about the generational differences of la chancla, the use of it in schools, when discipline crosses the line, when professionals and people need to report, why it is used and what people can do instead.\n\nListen Here\n\n3. Coming Out of the Closet in a Machismo Dominated Culture with Renato Pérez, LCSW\n\nThis topic has been requested since the podcast started, so I am glad Renato Perez joined me in on this conversation. There will be many more topics related to LGBTQIA+ in the episodes and seasons to come.\n\nMachismo and identifying as LGBTQ is an important topic because in our culture, machismo is part of the root of homophobia.\n\nMachismo is a traditional and toxic type of masculinity that in usually influenced by 4 factors: 1- men should not be feminine; 2- men must be respected and admired; 3-men should never show fear; and 4-men should seek out risk and adventure.\n\nOur guest is Renato Pérez, Licensed Clinical Social Worked in Los Angeles, CA, who goes a bit more in depth about machismo and history with coming out to his father. As an LGBTQ+ Affirmative therapist he supports clients of any gender identity or expression. He currently works for the Department of Mental Health and has a private practice in Sherman Oaks, CA.\n\nListen Here\n\n4. My Teen Pregnancy Story Part 1- Adriana Alejandre, LMFT\n\nTeen pregnancy is defined by someone who has a child between the ages of 13-19. About 750,000 teens get pregnant each year, mostly between the ages 17 to 19 (Kost, et al., 2010).\n\nWhile Latinxs currently have the highest teen birth rates, they have also had a dramatic recent decline in rates. Since 2007, the teen birth rate has declined by 58% for Latinx, compared with declines of 53% for African Americans and 47% for Caucasians.\n\nIn this solo episode, I share my personal experience with getting pregnant at age 19 and becoming a single mother during my undergraduate schooling in Santa Barbara, CA. I discuss general and personal mental health effects, cultural beliefs and common mentalities that Latinx teens and their parents experience.\n\nI also explore the barriers to sex education, such as family beliefs, shame, and Catholicism. I provide advice to young girls, parents and therapists.\n\nNext time I will continue with my story and talk about the collectivistic views with family postpartum adjustment and the high status that is achieved with childbearing in the Latinx culture.\n\nListen Here"
