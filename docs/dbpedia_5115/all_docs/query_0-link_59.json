        "text": "T\n\nhis honeycreeper is split perfectly in two, laterally from its beak to tail. One half is femaleâemerald green, and the other half, that lovely blue. Such bilateral gynandromorphism does indeed exist, but only because the Green Honeycreeper features such diverse colors between the male and female were these photos so vividly remind us that actually, traditionally, sexuality among animals, and humans, is not that simple.\n\nSpeaking of not so simple, the social and sexual world of Cotton-top Tamarins would really get some people flinging their poo.\n\nWhen we saw a tribe of Cotton-tops in Tayrona National Park yesterday, at first we thought we were looking at two or three monkeys. But after several minutes, it became clear that there were many more. Stealthy, like jungle guerrillas in a silent retreat. About 12 Cotton-tops were moving through the canopy. When we looked closer, we could see that there was one baby clinging to its mother’s back. The entire tribe seemed to have this single infant on their mind.\n\nIn the cotton-top social group, only one monogamous couple, the dominant male and female, breed. All the other monkeys in the group cooperate to help raise the young and to benefit the interests of the group.\n\nThis apparently altruistic behavior is rarely seen in nature, but reminds me of one of Edward O. Wilson’s last obsessionsâthe role of altruism among social animals.\n\nIn The Social Conquest of Earth, Wilson argued that altruism is an evolutionary force that occurs among eusocial species, whether primate or insectâeusociality being the highest form of social behavior. He wrote:\n\n“An iron rule exists in genetic social evolution. It is that selfish individuals beat altruistic individuals, while groups of altruists beat groups of selfish individuals. The victory can never be complete; the balance of selection pressures cannot move to either extreme. If individual selection were to dominate, societies would dissolve. If group selection were to dominate, human groups would come to resemble ant colonies.”\n\nCotton-tops in the group help feed, carry, educate and rear the young, at great cost to themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, the dominant female uses pheronomes, produced in her bum and monkeyflower, which both work to delay fertility and repress sexuality in other females. Fascinating social structure, but what a bichichi!\n\nI\n\nask him about the main differences between life inside and outside of the community.\n\n“Living within the community, among nature, is living away from noise and consumerism. It is living in cultural tradition, a quieter life, and definitely less crowded. Living outside the community is more complex. It is a less peaceful way of life. There is consumerism, insecurity, and definitely less tolerance.”\n\n“If you can balance the knowledge of mutual respect between the traditional cultures of the indigenous people and the Western cultures, it can create real opportunities. When young Wayuu are able to make it to university, that really helps the community by providing us with Western knowledge, preparing us for an evolving world.”\n\nWe walk deeper into the scrub forest, and I see a young woman carrying a woven bag filled with grains.\n\nI ask JosÃ© Luis what a typical Wayuu meal is like, and what kind of food he prefers.\n\n“Our ancient food was based on wild flora and fauna,” he explains. “Our meal preps were also based on dishes that we ate naturally and directly. The bread crops behind a lot of these dishes were cassava, pumpkin, melon, legumes, beans. Everything was prepared accompanied by rabbit meat, venison or peccary. Everything was all natural and without seasonings, colorings or salts. Animal fats were used to cook seafood such as turtle or shark. With this diet, our ancestors lived a lot longer and got sick a lot less. It was not necessary to go buy rice, vegetable oil, sugar and flour, these were not part of our diet.\n\nFish was dried from the sea and the salt from it helped to keep it for a long time, the meat of the goats was also dried; but goat meat is only as recent as the arrival of the colonizers. Before that, everything was from nature.\n\nNow the Wayuu dishes are based more on the seafood from the coastâfish, shrimp, lobsters, a little goat meat, more chicken, less local crops, more rice, many fried foods. The current diet is more about taste, before it was about subsistence. We’ve really adapted the Western diet. Personally, I am a fan of shrimp and fish, and all sorts of chicken recipes.”\n\nW\n\ne walk to the outskirts of the community, looking for a Vermilion Cardinal, a beautiful bright red bird that exists only here. Closely related to the Northern Cardinal, this Guajiro Cardinal features a fiery crest.\n\nI ask JosÃ© Luis about his love for naturalism and birds, and if it was seen as strange to others in the Wayuu community. He’ll later explain by email how Wayuu origin stories helped guide his passion:\n\n“My strengths are due to the fortune of being adopted by my maternal grandmother at the age of five,” JosÃ© Luis writes. “I was able to educate myself and prepared myself with cultural roots, and was always aware of my Wayuu origins. All Wayuu people come from the descendants of the beings that currently surround usânature. We have always had a connection among the different generations.”\n\n“This may be difficult to understand, but to understand the Wayuu world a little, I have a story about our origins.”\n\nMaleiwas, the creators, and beings ka'i, the sun, juya, the rain, maa, the Earth, joutai, the breeze, piyuushi, darkness, jemiai, the cold, jolotsuu, stars, mainnuya, the mist.\n\nFrom the Wayuu worldview, the understanding is that before our generation, there were five Wayuu generations, the first was made up of the maleiwa, who were the first inhabitants of the universe. In this generation two Gods, Juya and Maa fell in love and from this relationship the Wayuu of the second were born generation called unuuyuu, plants, were beings like us today with heads, arms, legs, with different qualities and jobs, these Wayuu of this generation felt alone and spoke with the god of the breeze, Joutai, that they wanted little brothers who would help them.\n\nIt was here that Joutai opened his arms and the Wayuu of the third generation came out and called them uchiyuu, the birds, just like the second generation were human beings with their different jobs and qualities, in this generation the most important character was revealed.\n\nThe uchiyuu also felt alone and asked to have other brothers with them to be their eyes in the night and the god of darkness. Their God, piyuushi raised his mantle and the Wayuu of the fourth generation, called lemuttushii, the four-legged animals, appeared. And in the fifth generation, Juuya, the god of rain fell in love with another Wayuu goddess, who we call pulowi. Pulowi was considered the mother and protector of the beings of the ocean, this goddess is personified in a beautiful long-haired woman, so gorgeous that any man who gazes at her goes crazy.\n\nFrom the relationship between Juya and Pulowi, a girl called Wolunka was born. Wolunka is the sister of the ocean beings. This girl quickly became a very beautiful woman who liked to bathe in water wells naked. When Pulowi realized that her companion Juya had another woman, she became very angry and formed from her body the Wayuu man of the fifth generation, the Maayuui, and gave him a mission, which was to find this girl, marry her and have many children. This boy went out to fulfill his mother's command, searching for Wolunka in the wells. Maayuui eventually found her, and immediately approached her, but suddenly something stopped him when he saw that this girl had something very strange, a sound was heard inside her legs. Cruuu , cruu , cruu , cruu , cruu. It was a gnashing of teeth because this woman had inherited her teeth in her vagina from her brothers, the fish and the sharks, she was the first woman of the fifth generation to have been born.\n\nBecause of her toothed vagina, Maayuui had to ask, now what am I going to do? If the mission I have is to have many children with this woman? How can I have a relationship with her?\n\nHe began to think of a way to remove her teeth, and he made his first implement, which was a bow and an arrow. He went out to the well to knock out the teeth of Wolunka's vagina. Wolunka was playing in the water, jumping, jumping, raising her legs up and just at this moment Maayuui pointed, he shot. The teeth fell into the water and she began to bleed. Suddenly the water was stained with blood. Many of the third generation Wayuu, the birds, went into the water to bathe. These birds dipped in the water to bathe, and their feathers became stained deep red.\n\nThat is how they became the Vermilion Cardinal. Other birds, like the flamingo, arrived later when the blood was already diffused. From the moment this girl loses her teeth and bleeds; All their generations inherited the sacred blood and women inherited vaginal blood, menstration.\n\nMaayuui fulfilled her mission and thanks to this feat, we were born today's Wayuu of the sixth generation and women’s vaginas are thankfully toothless. With this story I wanted to share with you how important our older brothers are to us and the respect we have for them.\n\nSo that you realize we have always had a direct connection with nature, despite that, what I started doing, which was watching birds, was very strange for everyone, to the point that many of my relatives told me that I was going crazy and that I was a corruncho âa believer in things that don’t exist. But that did not stop me. I continued because it was something that I liked and wanted, and now my friends and family tell me that they also want to be crazy like me. Hahaha!”\n\nI ask him about his favorite memories growing up wandering the desert scrub.\n\n\"I remember something that happened when I was out with a group of friends in a field, near a water wellâJaquey in Wayuu. Suddenly, we were surprised by some barking dogs running through the forest, chasing something; and then a Crab-eating Raccoon, running a thousand-miles-per-hour, scared as could be, looked for an escape and the first thing he saw was me!\n\nHe grabbed my leg like a begging child and started climbing on me, up to my head. I was in complete shock. I didn’t know what to do - should I run, scream or try to throw this thing off my head? Now, the dogs were circling me, and wanting nothing but to capture this raccoon. We got up the courage and idea to protect the raccoon, so we started throwing stone and sticks at the dogs. The raccoon would not leave my head until they were completely gone, and then it just jumped off my head and scurried into the bushes.\"\n\nWe came to an area near the community that included the foundations of a pair of two small tourist homes. This is the same area where the endemic birds are most likely to be seen.\n\n\"It is a group called Ishoo Experiences. We are trying to build lodges with elements of the Wayuu culture, mixed with the comforts of Western culture. These types of tourists love nature, but they are also interested in contributing to conservation, contributing to the local economy and relating to the ancestral worldview of indigenous peoples.\"\n\nHaving read about the issues facing the Wayuu people, including access to fresh water, marginalization, and territorial disputes, I ask JosÃ© Luis what he thought were the biggest challenges for the Wayuu.\n\nHe explains, \"The main challenge is the loss of land, many settlers have stolen the land of the Wayuu and sold them off, which affects the entire Wayuu identity because we are not rich in money, nor in recognition. The true wealth for the Wayuu, or for all the indigenous communities in Colombia and the world is the territory; that it is necessary to leave it to our future generations.\n\nToday we do not have the same territory as we did before, even though the state protects us, but that protection is not complete, because there is a lot of corruption and the corrupt buy off the leaders, who then invalidate the protections of the indigenous people, marginalizing us so we disappear.\n\nThe key is to fight for the territory, prepare ourselves professionally, generate investment and productive projects in the community and lead the union as we did before. The key is not to wait for the government or the state to put food in our mouths, but to generate our own food. As an ethnic group we have always resisted for our territory, because without territory there is no identity.\n\n\"What about the La Guajira landscape and environment,\" I ask. \"how do the changes affect the Wayuu’s way of life?\"\n\n\"The territory has changed a lot, before we could grow crops, we could collect wild fruits, hunt wild animals, fishing was productive, we had territories, today you cannot do these things because they have populated the territory, it hardly rains now, the development they call has taken away many stories and indigenous peoples. Now everything is scarcer, more pollution.\"\n\nWhile wandering outside the Tocoromana ranch, we run into four small children, out on a forest adventure. They carry a pail and a cup, and they remind me that the best things I learned were always barefoot in the wood, a pail of pond water in hand. I ask JosÃ© Luis about the kids, and efforts to preserve Wayuu culture and traditions amidst modernization. I ask, \"Are the younger generations working to preserve Wayuu traditions?\"\n\n\"The important thing for us, and them, is to maintain the territory. This generation must be trained and prepared for the evolving modern world. They need to learn from Western culture and thus not allow the culture to be trampled. Build more schools and train future leaders who can fight against the corruption that would lead them to misery. The current great evil of humanity is corruption. It's not our water problems, nor the weakening of natural resources, nor the lack of territory. Corruption has killed more indigenous people than everything else. The path of resistance to corruption is education in every sense of the word.\""
