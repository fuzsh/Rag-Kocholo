        "text": "Nevada Connections Academy provides comprehensive lesson plans online and in print, along with a number of exciting elective courses. The proven curriculum incorporates materials developed by leading educational institutions, as well as lessons and other resources developed by curriculum specialists. The curriculum for our public school is aligned with Nevada standards.\n\nNevada Connections Academy teachers and learning coaches work closely together to create a unique learning environment and to set goals for their studentsâ learning. Teachers use an individualized approach to learning throughout the year called Personalized Performance LearningÂ® (PPL), which allows them to evaluate the needs of a student and customize accordingly.\n\nNevada Connections Academy students often lead busy lives, and this online flexibility allows for learning when it works best. Students will need to be available for teacher-led LiveLessonÂ® sessions, but are able to choose how to arrange their free time in between. For some students, scheduling breaks in between lessons may be the answer to optimized learning. For others, leaving time for extracurricular activities is key. Check out the Connections Academy Resource Hub to see some examples of sample schedules."
