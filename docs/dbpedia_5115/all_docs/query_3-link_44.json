In 1930 he was appointed program manager, and in 1945 Walter was promoted to station manager. At one point Haase owned 20% of the station and served as Secretary of the Corporation.

When he was hired at WDRC FM in 1985, it was just in time for WDRC's 25th Anniversary special. During his five hour Saturday and Sunday night shifts on WDRC AM, he included dozens of airchecks and old jingles from the early years of the station's tenure as a pop music station. Frank later moved to afternoon drive and originated Jukebox Saturday Night; that program was originally simulcast and later moved to FM.
