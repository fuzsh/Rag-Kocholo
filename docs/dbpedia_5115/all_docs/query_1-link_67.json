        "text": "#FACTORfunded:\n\n4Korners\n\nI’ve been widely known as an international DJ as well as the Official DJ of the Toronto Raptors for well over a decade, but 2022 was a MASSIVE year for me as I made the transition from DJ to Recording Artist / Producer complete. With the support of FACTOR’s Juried Sound Recording program, I was able to successfully write, produce, record, release and roll out my debut full length album, “4KORNERS Of The World” solidifying my place in this new career path.\n\nThe album is a musical journey around the world. It’s both a portrait of Toronto as the most multicultural city on the planet, and a collection of sounds and feelings that live within me as a result of touring globally as a DJ for the past decade. It’s Hip Hop, Electronic, Afrobeats, Dancehall, Soca, J-Pop, Baile Funk and so much more, all wrapped into one seamless audio escape. This is what music means to me, and thanks to FACTOR I was able to craft this project in a way that is true to my vision without sacrificing quality, and release it 100% independently though my own company JN SHPPRD.\n\nI worked with emerging Canadian artists of diverse ethnic backgrounds residing all over the country, recorded the music in studios across 3 provinces and shot music videos in both Toronto and Vancouver. It is of great importance to me that I not only explore sound but provide a platform for up and coming Canadian talent, which was done to the max on this album with features from future superstars like EverythingOShauN, Odreii, Ashton Adams and Temia to name a few. And aesthetically, I was able to bring my ideas to life from photo and content shoots to marketing and promotional initiatives. Support from FACTOR helped make all of that possible.\n\nThis project received critical acclaim and media coverage from tons of major outlets including SOCAN Magazine, CP24, CTV, TSN and Blog TO plus radio spins and interviews across Canada and around the world on Virgin / iHeart Radio, CBC Radio, 3 Sirius XM channels, Flex 101.4 (UK), Naija 102 (Nigeria), MOUV (France) and more. It got major support from Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music amounting to two Yonge-Dundas Billboards and over 30 Editorial playlists, and has been extremely well received on my recent tours across Canada and Europe. Thank you FACTOR for supporting my artistry and helping me put myself in position to level up my career, export my music internationally, and take more and more young talented Canadians with me!\n\n#FACTORfunded:\n\nBegonia\n\n“Begonia has one of Canada’s most extraordinary voices, and thankfully she uses it to obliterate the misery from this world one live performance at a time.” – Noisey\n\nBegonia launched onto the Canadian music scene on the strength of critically acclaimed 2017 EP Lady In Mind. Yet to her fans, the Pop/R&B singer felt like music’s best kept secret. After receiving critical FACTOR funding, Begonia went on to release her audacious debut full-length album Fear in September 2019. Fear was chosen as one of Exclaim!’s Most Underrated Albums of the Year, and made numerous end of the year recommendation lists. Her singles “Beats” and “Hanging On A Line” were named as CBC Music National Radio Fan Favourites of 2019, and the album spent 10 straight weeks as the #1 album in the country on Earshot’s Top 50 chart. Thanks to FACTOR Tour Support, Begonia has been touring major festivals and playing to sold-out audiences at small clubs across North America. On stage, Begonia dresses in bold, sometimes bright-coloured wardrobe: it’s how she feels most powerful, “almost like a superhero version of myself,” she says. Thanks to FACTOR support, Begonia is able to share her aesthetic with fans in the stunning music videos and photography that she uses to support the music.\n\n#FACTORfunded:\n\nCadence Weapon\n\nI’d like to extend my gratitude to FACTOR for the assistance they’ve provided to me throughout my career. I’ve dedicated myself to the pursuit of creating innovative rap music that pushes the boundaries of what is expected from the genre. FACTOR’s support of my music and the work of other unconventional artists in our country has helped to make the Canadian music landscape a more diverse place. My recently released self-titled album was funded by FACTOR’s Juried Sound Recording program, contributing to the production, recording and mixing of the album. Cadence Weapon received positive reviews and press coverage from Pitchfork, The Fader, Complex, Dazed Digital, Highsnobiety, NOISEY and the Toronto Star. The album held the number 1 spot on !earshot’s National Hip Hop college radio chart for eight weeks straight and the first single “My Crew (Woooo)” premiered on Zane Lowe’s Beats 1 show on Apple Music. The resources provided by FACTOR have helped me to expand the breadth of my artistic vision and create what Exclaim! calls my “most provocative and well-executed album” and “a high water mark for hip-hop on this continent.”\n\nCadence Weapon\n\n#FACTORfunded:\n\nCatherine MacLellan\n\nCanadian folk music gem Catherine MacLellan released her FACTOR-funded album COYOTE at the end of 2019 and the success of COYOTE has allowed Catherine to continue to reach new fans at home in Canada and internationally.\n\nLive appearances at the start of 2020 started with her official showcase in Australia, directly followed by three weeks of dates in with co-headline shows anchored by two major folk festivals, Woodford and Cygnet. Official showcasing at Folk Alliance International in New Orleans and Americana UK in Hackney helped finalize summer 2020 touring dates to support COYOTE’s release in the US, Canada, UK, and Europe. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Catherine’s official SXSW showcase in Austin as well as all spring and summer shows had to be cancelled or rescheduled. With FACTOR’s support we are now in the process of filming a live special performance for COYOTE to be available fall 2021.\n\nAward recognition for COYOTE started with a 2020 JUNO nomination for Contemporary Folk Album of the Year, followed with nominations for three Canadian Folk Awards, four East Coast Music Awards (winning Songwriter of the Year), and eight Music PEI awards (with three wins including Solo recording of the Year and Contemporary Roots Recording). Press accolades for COYOTE included the cover and feature article in Penguin Eggs and a review in MOJO Magazine in the UK. COYOTE reached #6 on the NACC Folk charts in the U.S. and #15 on the North Americana Sirius XM Top 30 year-end chart (2019).\n\nCatherine wishes to thank FACTOR for the support with the creation and promotion of COYOTE.\n\n#FACTORfunded:\n\nCharlotte Cardin\n\n2022-2023 has been a huge year for Charlotte Cardin. The artist’s promotion, supported by Factor’s funding envelope for the Cult Nation Inc. Label, has taken her to the next level. Her 2021 album Phoenix went platinum in 2022 and earned her six Juno nominations, making her the most nominated artist of the year at the awards. She was also the most awarded artist winning 4 Junos for Album of the Year, Pop Album of the Year with Phoenix, Artist of the Year and Single of the Year with Meaningless. As a result of this recognition, Charlotte has received a tremendous amount of press and promotional opportunities not only in Canada, but also in the United States and Europe. With the generous support of Factor, the rising star also toured over 50 sold out dates in Canada, the U.S. and Europe as well as opening for established artists such as Chet Faker, BORNS and Milky Chance. Finally, in 2022, Charlotte has been focusing on the production of her upcoming album (99 Nights) due out in the summer of 2023 as well as the production of her next tour that will follow this highly anticipated release.\n\n#FACTORfunded:\n\nDaniela Andrade\n\nIn 2019, as a producer, writer, performer and creative director, Daniela Andrade’s voice is coming full circle, back to the DIY spirit that sparked her initial creations as an early pioneer on YouTube. Securing support at the likes of NPR, Billboard, Complex, The FADER and COLORS, Daniela released the new bilingual and genre-bending project Tamale that blends glimmers of jazz-indebted soul and R&B as it pays homage to her Honduran roots.\n\n“I’d like to thank FACTOR for helping my recently released project Tamale come to life. The funding allowed me to dedicate time to learn to produce, collaborate with talented artists in Toronto and give it the support it deserved. I’m grateful to have been able to share a part of my story as a child to immigrants, one that I feel is necessary to shed light on as a Canadian, where there are many who grew up similarly.”\n\n#FACTORfunded:\n\nDominique Fils-Aimé\n\nMontreal-based, JUNO Award winning singer-songwriter, Dominique Fils-Aimé [FEES-em-AY] recently completed an ambitious album trilogy conceptualizing the history of African American music, reflecting on the social realities that influenced the genres of blues, jazz and soul.\n\nDominique’s career blossomed when her FACTOR-funded sophomore album, “Stay Tuned!”, received a write-up on Radio Canada’s Jazz Revelation. “Stay Tuned!” was then shortlisted for the Polaris Music Prize, won the JUNO for Vocal Jazz Album of the Year, and was featured among the nineteen best Canadian albums of 2019 by CBC. Her debut, “Nameless” is used as a reference recording for audiophiles across the world and was showcased at High End Munich and AXPONA. And most recently, “Three Little Words”, her second FACTOR-funded recording, also made the Polaris Shortlist, claimed the #1 spot for best selling album in Quebec and hit #2 in Canada, with over three hundred media mentions worldwide.\n\nWith FACTOR’s generous support, Dominique Fils-Aimé has toured in both Canada and the U.S. and has upcoming European tours this fall (2021) and winter (2022).\n\n#FACTORfunded:\n\nHaviah Mighty\n\nIn the past year, Haviah has balanced both a burgeoning group project with all-female hip hop crew, The Sorority, seeing their debut release Pledge in April 2018, alongside continuing her solo career with newfound momentum. This momentum began with Mighty’s first Artist Development grant from FACTOR, that was in support of her most recent EP, Flower City (March 2017). It was with that project that she started to gain industry attention, and began building a working relationship with booking agency APA, as well as artist management team Valeo Arts Management (A Tribe Called Red, Jeremy Dutcher, Jean-Michel Blais, Boogat). Together with her team, Haviah’s career is being propelled to places it hasn’t been before, recently landing opening spots for Nelly, Desiigner, Kranium, and more. Now, with support from FACTOR’s Juried Sound Recording program, Mighty’s forthcoming full-length project will be a career defining release that will leverage her to new audiences in more markets than ever before, via marketing, touring, and showcasing opportunities within the program. FACTOR has made sure that artists in Canada are able to reach their full creative and market potential through the Juried Sound Recording portfolio, and Mighty is fortunate to take full advantage of these resources at an essential moment in her come up.\n\nHaviah Mighty\n\n#FACTORfunded:\n\nKorea Town Acid\n\nKorea Town Acid is a Seoul-born, Toronto based producer/DJ. Over the past decade KTA’s signature futuristic delivery, compatible as a DJ set or with live hardware synths, has garnered her global attention. She has showcased in Seoul, New York, Athens, Berlin, London, and Helsinki, as well as throughout Canada.\n\nHer entirely self-produced debut LP Metamorphosis was recorded in Toronto at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mixed and mastered by Dave Cooley (J Dilla, MF Doom), the ten-track record features a range of collaborations from Toronto based artist DESIIRE, U.K based Korean pianist and rapper Pianwooo, Seoul rapper PNSB, and more.\n\nMetamorphosis was released via URBNET and was funded by FACTOR.\n\n“When URBNET reached me out, I knew they were a more hip hop based, beats oriented label. I wanted to engage with the rap/hip hop side of me, I was just discovering lots of underground rappers and beats from Seoul.”\n\nSince its release in May 2021, the album has received positive feedback from Resident Advisor, Bandcamp, Visla Korea, Exclaim!, NOW Magazine, and Complex Canada.\n\n“FACTOR helped me push my boundaries and focus in this pandemic year. I felt that FACTOR and URBNET gave me 100% creative control and direction, which allowed me to explore my next sound in freedom. I really appreciate that”.\n\n#FACTORfunded:\n\nLuna Li\n\nOver the last year, Korean-Canadian indie pop multi-instrumentalist Luna Li has seen tremendously exciting growth, catapulting herself into the Canadian and international music scenes thanks in large part to significant contributions through FACTOR’s Juried Sound Recording program. The release of FACTOR funded singles ‘Trying’ and ‘Afterglow’ in the first half of 2020 brought the attention of exciting new partners AWAL, 88rising and former XL Recordings head A&R Imran Ahmed’s new label, In Real Life.\n\nIn 2021, Luna Li has continued to build momentum with the releases ‘Cherry Pit’ and ‘Alone But Not Lonely’ – which have seen press support from some of music and fashions largest publications including i-D, NME, PAPER, Exclaim!, The Needle Drop and much more.\n\nFACTOR’s support has also helped Luna Li to create captivating videos, including Cherry Pit, which has built Luna’s profile in the fashion world, leading to interviews with the likes of FASHION Canada and more.\n\nLuna Li was nominated for Alternative Album of the Year for the project Duality, at the 2023 JUNO Awards.\n\n#FACTORfunded:\n\nMONOWHALES\n\nSince the very beginning of our careers in the Canadian music industry, FACTOR’s support has played a huge role in our success as an independent band. The recording of our breakout single “Home” was made possible through FACTOR’s Demo Grant. This allowed us to put more funds towards the video that would accompany that single, which ended up being a huge step forward for us after the video went viral. A year later we received FACTOR’s Juried Sound Recording Grant and were able to use it to recruit producer AL-P to produce and mix our EP Control Freak. The marketing funds made available through the program allowed us to hire a publicist and a radio promoter, make quality videos, and promote multiple singles that received radio airplay across Canada. Our first single “Take It Back” peaked at #25 on the Canadian Alternative Rock Charts and was described by 102.1 The Edge as “the track that put MONOWHALES on the indie rock-map in Canada”. As the second single “Real Love” climbed to #31 we were able to begin a relentless touring schedule that included supporting acts like K. Flay, Dear Rouge, and The Beaches, as well as performing at major festivals such as Festival D’Ete du Quebec, PRIDE in Yellowknife, NWT, and the Reeperbahn Festival in Hamburg, Germany. This all culminated in MONOWHALES receiving the Jim Beam INDIE Award for Best Alternative Artist/Group of the Year during Canadian Music Week 2019, and the Forest City London Music Award for Ontario Independent Recording Artist of the Year. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to FACTOR and are thankful that we live in a country that is so willing to support its artists.\n\nMONOWHALES\n\n#FACTORfunded:\n\nNeon Dreams\n\nWhen we set out to create our album Sweet Dreams To Sunbeams we had an artistic vision that was separate from anything we had done before. We wanted to create entirely new concepts in the way we branded ourselves as a band. In the end we discovered what would become our bands sound.\n\nFACTOR allowed us to bring these visions to life through the Juried Sound Recording program which helped fund everything from recording the album to creating the music video and marketing it in ways we’ve never been able to in the past. From Sweet Dreams to Sunbeams we received a JUNO nomination for “Breakthrough Group of The Year”, two Top 40 singles at CHR and Hot AC radio, success across all streaming platforms for several songs off the project, multiple tours as support and headlining slots in both Canada and the US, all of which wouldn’t have been possible without funding from FACTOR.\n\n#FACTORfunded:\n\nTanika Charles\n\nFor soul artist Tanika Charles, 2022 was a year of reassertion. After a couple years of relative inactivity, it was time to reemerge with new music the exemplifies her as one of the best soul singers this country has to offer. Following the success of 2019’s The Gumption and 2016’s Soul Run, Tanika released her third album, Papillion de Nuit: The Night Butterfly, in April of 2022. Papillon was Tanika’s first time receiving FACTOR Juried Sound Recording funding for an album project. Not only was the financial support critical to completing the album, the structure that came with these funding obligations helped usher the project through it’s stages during a period of ongoing uncertainty about what came next.\n\nThe album was released in Canada through Tanika’s own Unique Applause label, but was licensed through the Italian label Record Kicks for international distribution. The two entities led complimentary marketing and promotional campaigns for album leading to significant coverage on both sides of the Atlantic. Papillon de Nuit received glowing reviews and praise in numerous publications including Canada’s Exclaim!, UK’s Uncut magazine, and was named Bandcamp’s album of the day upon it’s release.\n\nA FACTOR-assisted promotional campaign in Canada converted into many performance requests. As such, what was expected to be a slow easing back into live performances instead became a jam packed summer of over a dozen festival appearances across the country. Since two years had gone by with very little summer festivals, the mentality within Tanika’s team was to say “yes” to as many opportunities as possible and then find a way to make them feasible. The availability of FACTOR tour support funding reduced the financial gamble involved, leaving only logistical gambles to contend with (side note: FACTOR please consider expanding your mandate to also bend space and time, thanks).\n\nThanks in part to FACTOR’s ongoing support, Tanika has been able to tour and showcase her new material across Canada. Plans are already in place to continue expanding her international reach into 2023 and beyond. Getting back into the saddle so soon wasn’t easy, and certainly wasn’t guaranteed. But with support programs like FACTOR’s Juried Sound Recording, Tanika Charles was able to jump back into the mix and remind the world that some of the best soul music comes from Canada."
