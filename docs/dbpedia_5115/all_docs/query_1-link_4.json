        "text": "You can see Lido Pimienta perform on June 17 at the Knockdown Center in Queens, New York as part of Pitchfork + Them's Pride concert, Night Out. Buy tickets HERE.\n\nBetween painting vinyl jackets and crafting crowns to raise funds for the indigenous Wayuu communities of northern Colombia, writing film and TV scripts, working on music, and raising two kids, Lido Pimienta has had no problem keeping herself busy over quarantine at home in Toronto. “I take being prolific extremely seriously,” she tells them. over the phone. “I don’t get those people who say they’re bored at home. Like, how?”\n\nThe boundary-pushing Colombian Canadian musician beat out the likes of Leonard Cohen and Feist for the 2017 Polaris Prize with La Papessa (“The High Priestess”), her 2016 avant-garde pop sophomore album. Her latest record Miss Colombia, released earlier this year, has earned her another spot on the shortlist for Canada’s most important music prize, and for good reason. The album, a showcase of traditional Afro-Colombian beats refracted through a celestial lens, shows Pimienta exploring Indigenous spirituality and her Colombian roots in a more explicit way than ever before.\n\nNamed after Steve Harvey’s infamous 2015 Miss Universe fluke, Miss Colombia honors Colombian music, ranging from the tremulous pop sensibilities of Bomba Estereo’s Li Saumet on flute-heavy “Nada” (“Nothing”), to the traditional percussion and call-and-response form of “Quiero Que Me Salves” (\"I Want You To Save Me\"). The latter track features the legendary traditional group Sexteto Tabalá of San Basilio de Palenque, the first free African town in the Americas. For the song’s prelude, Pimienta samples their bandleader, Rafael Cassiani Cassiani, as he delivers a monologue about the history of how the group was formed. In these collaborations, we find the core of her artistic ethos: a fierce commitment to uplift the oft-overlooked Black and Indigenous roots of the music she’s making.\n\nThis effort to recognize those roots is made all the more notable by Pimienta’s simultaneous queering of these old ways. With her use of anthemic arrangements, off-kilter vocalizations, and ambiguous metaphors for love, Miss Colombia sees Pimienta operating outside of a strict tradition, as she tries to salvage love for her country and herself. The video for alt-cumbia standout “Eso Que Tu Haces” (“That Thing That You Do”), shot in Palenque and featuring dancers clad in traditional garb, sees Pimienta reclaiming her independence after losing herself in a lover, singing in heart-wrenching pitch about “a love that isn’t love.” This love is palpable in a very radical way: to question and critique is to love, even in isolation.\n\nthem. spoke to Pimienta about complicating the conversation surrounding Latinx identity, the spiritual structure of Miss Colombia, and crafting work through a lens of radical love.\n\nHave you been making new music in quarantine?\n\nI just finished producing Bomba Estereo’s new record and am working on my own stuff. I’m also collaborating with Ricky Reed and making a song with a Spanish artist named Muerdo. I’m always creating, whether people see it or not; Miss Colombia was finished in 2015. With things the way they are, who knows how long it'll take to release the next project, but I have my whole plan ready to go.\n\nThe first thing that caught my attention about Miss Colombia is that it opens with “Para Transcribir (SOL)” (“To Transcribe [SUN]”) and ends with “Para Transcribir (LUNA)” (“To Transcribe [MOON]”).\n\nIt's the beginning and the end, waking and sleeping, positive and negative, Yin and Yang, moon and sun, immense beauty and immense violence. It's how I feel about my country: If you go to Colombia and take a long drive, the landscape will take your breath away. Then, you get stopped by the military and they’ll take your money if they feel like it. The government and the system in Colombia reminds you that we can't have it all. I wake up with this hope that it will change, but the reality of what’s happening always brings me back to Earth.\n\nThe intro and outro embody the most anxiety-driven parts of me. I have to keep reminding myself it’s not all bad. “Para Transcribir” is figuring out a big question: How do I love where I’m from without shame? The first part of the album deals in complications and the second with redemption. [Rafael Cassiani] Cassiani is in the middle with Sexteto Tabalá — unadulterated traditional Colombian music. The world is suffering right now in a very radical way, and I want to be able to rescue my hope by channeling the immense beauty of nature regenerating, taking a break. That inspires me like nothing else.\n\n“Quiero Que Me Salves,” and its prelude featuring Cassiani Cassiani talking about the origins of Sexteto Tabalá, feels like you are communing with a musical ancestor.\n\nMy job during that session in San Basilio de Palenque was to give space to that group of musicians. In this industry where everyone is chasing after fame and money, these traditional groups are denied the attention they deserve, when the fact is everything we listen to today stems from this music. What would have happened if Africans had not been taken from their land, arrived in the Americas, and survived centuries of abuse? If it weren’t for Afro-Colombian music, where would I be? We’re not thinking about that, and the disconnect is palpable, especially when we’re talking about Black music through labels like “urbano” or “Latin” without specifying where these rhythms and beats come from.\n\nAs a Latinx artist making experimental music very much grounded in your roots, do you think (for Anglo audiences) Latinx artists — whether or not they’re making “Latin Music” — are expected to make a specific kind of sound?\n\nI do, and there’s a reason. You see all these reggaeton dudes flaunting their wealth because they come from nothing. When you come from nothing, it’s a big deal to wear a Louis Vuitton shirt and three Rolexes. Meanwhile, the indie people are saying that reggaeton isn’t real music. We're all full of shit, and instead of talking shit about each other and saying what’s music or isn’t, we must draw a distinction between artists and entertainers. Why is Bad Bunny on the cover of Rolling Stone, for example? Because he’s pushing boundaries sonically and questioning norms.\n\nI may be independent and not have a machine behind me, but I’m not trying to shit on reggaeton because it comes from the streets. Reggaeton has to exist, and I love it. What we need right now is balance. We need to hold space for everyone, not just those privileged musicians with a bit more money or education — something that reflects in their music. If we still had the GRAMMYs and I got invited, I’d probably show up wearing a beautiful gown embroidered with, “Make Reggaeton Black Again.\" I’ve already practiced my speech. I’m gonna grab the trophy, look at it, and ask, “Where’s my check?” Do the GRAMMYs come with a check? Because the Polaris Prize in Canada comes with $50,000. Am I wrong to ask?\n\nDo you feel the definition of Latin music is going to change as we find more terms to categorize the music coming out of the diaspora? As a queer Afro-Indigenous woman, I’ve seen you marketed with your identity prominently on display.\n\nIt's too much. It’s tricky. We have to be very visible, because for so long we weren’t. It doesn’t bother me to have my identity on display, but what bothers me are the comparisons — “Lido Pimienta is what happens when you combine Ibeyi with Rosalía.” Like, really? It will always be like that because I was born in Colombia. I don’t think that happens to white-passing Latinx musicians making indie music in English. For people like me, because I make experimental music in Spanish, it’s like, “How are we going to get people to know this artist without them being confused? Let's tell them that this is some Brown girl that does experimental music but she’s also queer, Indigenous, Black, etc.” My identity and my language is not a decoration or a political statement. If I wanted to make a political statement, I would do an album in Wayuunaiki [the language of the Wayuu people]. My music is in Spanish, and I don’t have to force it, but my family is Indigenous. One day, when the moment and context and budget is right, I’ll do it right.\n\nLove is a prevalent theme on this record. For you, it seems to transcend gender, culture, and spirit. You sing about the love of children, country, and self. Can you speak a little bit more about the love that vibrates through this record?\n\nA song can’t be written without pain or love. To hate someone, you have to love that person too. Hate forms slowly and is the result of deception, lying, and betrayal. I don’t buy that story of Indigenous people falling in love with their oppressor. Why do we romanticize those stories? I feel betrayed by my country because I love it so much, and it’s necessary to remember that it loves me too. In Colombia, I always felt like an outsider because I came over to Canada and left things unfinished there. In my country, I complicate the conversation and critique these established viewpoints. It’s viewed negatively because I should be a demure, quiet and submissive woman and I’m not. I think about why I left my country, and why I have that fear to connect with Colombian musicians I respect. I’ve found so many people there who admired my work and are proud of what I’m doing. I want to amplify this new generation of Colombian artists with a new attitude and let them know it’s not important if you have millions of followers. Maybe that's why I'm on this new path: I’m trying to craft songs that come not from a place of pain but from a place of love.\n\nInterview has been translated from Spanglish, condensed, and edited for clarity.\n\nGet the best of what's queer.
