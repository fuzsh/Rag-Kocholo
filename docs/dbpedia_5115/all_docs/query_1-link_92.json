His forays into Latin Music, was a clue to something very few British fans knew; that Phil was half-Colombian, and spent most of his childhood in Latin America, including Venezuela, Colombia and Cuba, whose music massively influenced him. In Havana, aged 8, Phil witnessed the Cuban revolution and encountered his first guitar, owned by his mother, who taught him the South American folk songs she loved.
