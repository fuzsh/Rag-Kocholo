Polyschematist dimeter (U--U ~vv_) or “logaoedic tetrapody”’ with ‘dactyl’ in the third place (ὖ ι-- -ὄ οὐὖὐ- } In a word, the metrical explanations of forms that abound in Greek poetry which are given by eminent Greek metricians, or a theory of the ‘rhythmical’ structure of these forms that has little, if any, support in ancient tradition? These questions are of importance sufficient to warrant a thorough reconsideration of the material to which they relate. Definitions of logaoedic metre are given by Hephaestion and Aristi- des Quintilianus. These, unhappily, are not complete. The reason of this, however, is apparent: the metre was relatively unimportant. Both authors add their statements about it to their general treatment of the larger subjects of dactylic and anapaestic metres. But the essential fact is made clear. Hephaestion briefly defines logaoedic metre to be the combination, within the same colon, of two or more dactyls with a trochaic syzygy, or, in ascending rhythm, of two or more anapaests with a catalectic iambic syzygy (bacchius). The most noted form, he adds, in the second category has four anapaests, the first of which may be a spondee or iambus.' Logaoedic cola, thus defined, are comparatively rare in Greek comedy.? 1 Heph. 25, 12 ff. and 29, 12 ff. (Westphal), and Schol. Heph. 163, 13 ff. Cf. Arist. Quintilianus 33, 30 ff. and 34, 5 ff. (Jahn) = 52 and 53 (M.). 3 For examples of this metre, see Thesm. 1136-1159, p. 20 below. This lyric is altogether singular in the great number of logaoedic cola it contains. 2 Fohn Williams White Modern writers on Greek metre, G. Hermann (sparingly), Bockh, Rossbach and Westphal, and many others, have extended the applica- tion of the term ‘logaoedic’ to include cola that contain a single ‘dactyl’ (or single, but isolated, ‘dactyls’). This view of logaoedic metre, chiefly through the powerful exposition of Rossbach and West- phal, is now current. It has recently been strongly re-enforced by the acute reasoning of Goodell.! But it is not the view of the Greek metricians, who, while they are not always in accord in the application of their theory, agree that the cola which are now under considera- tion are to be measured differently. According to Heliodorus and Hephaestion, the unit of measurement is here a ‘foot’ that in its normal form contains four syllables and six times (χρόνοι). The current ‘logaoedic’ measurement of the metres in question has twice received fairly complete exposition in its application to Greek comedy, in Rossbach and Westphal’s Specielle Griechische Metrik? and in J. H. H. Schmidt’s Antike Compositionslehre.® But, so far as I am aware, the lyrics and stichic periods of comedy that have been classified as ‘logaoedic’ have never been fully presented in any modern treatise in the forms demanded by ancient metrical theory. I purpose, there- fore, in what follows to analyze them in accordance with the doctrine of Hephaestion, with such aid as may be got from the Heliodorean metrical scholia on Aristophanes. Fair opportunity will thus be afforded for comparison. I exclude from present consideration the lyrics in Aristophanes written, in whole or in part, in the metre made famous by Telesilla. There are six of these lyrics, besides isolated occurrences of the line, in Aristophanes, and the form occurs also in Cratinus and Hermippus ; but the Telesilleum, according to Hephaestion,‘ is a mixed Ionic colon, and the discussion of it belongs elsewhere. | Chapters on Greek Metric, pp. 212 ff. * Third edit., pp. 653-669. 3 See pp. CLXXXVI-CCCLXXV. 4 See Heph. 35, 19 ff. (W.). ‘Logaocedic’ Metre in Greek Comedy 3 I Chonriambic Cola The Choriambus, as such, disappears under the current modern analysis. It is no longer a fundamental foot (vv) used as consti- tuent element of a μέτρον πρωτότυπον, but a catalectic dactylic dipody (-vv|-,). Hephaestion, however, for whom this πούς was as real an element in metre as the dactyl or iambus, devotes a chapter of his Manual to it. The chapter begins (30, 6 ff.) : τὸ χοριαμβικὸν συντί- θεται μὲν καὶ καθαρόν, συντίθεται δὲ καὶ ἐπίμικτον πρὸς τὰς ἰαμβικάς\" ὡς ἐπίπαν δέ, ὅτε καταληκτικόν ἐστιν, εἰς τὴν ἰαμβικὴν κατακλεῖδα περαιοῦται, τοῦτ᾽ ἔστιν, εἰς ἀμφίβραχυν, ἢ βακχεῖον διὰ τὴν ἀδιάφορον. This simple statement adequately explains the metrical constitution of many lyrics in Aristophanes.

Uo In order to secure greater ease in analysis, the cola are here printed separately, each in its own line, after the manner of the Alexandrines. Catalexis marks the close of a period or hypermetron. The combina- tion of choriambic cola in Aristophanes is generally hypermetrical. Hiatus and syllaba anceps in aca/alectc cola are extremely rare; they will be noted whenever they thus occur. The commation that has just been quoted (Nubes 510-517) begins with an anapaestic movement. Compare the beginning of the comma- tion that introduces the parabasis in the Vespae (1009 ff.), where the lyric movement that follows is trochaic. The remaining cola are all dimeters, rhythmic πόδες of the normal measurement of eight syllables and twelve times, with catalexis in 2, 6, and the commonly allowed irrational element in the odd places of the 4 Fohn Williams White iambic dimeter (5). The cola are pure choriambic (3), or mixed choriambic (1, 2, 4, 6), or iambic (5). The designation of 1 and 2 respectively as “first Glyconic”’ and “first Pherecratean’’ and of the _ union of the two as “first Priapean” is modern and highly. objectionable.

The Scholiast divides the text of 3, 4: μόνας θεῶν; ὡς [ἕτοιμος ὅδ᾽ (?) ἐστὶν ἅπαν τα δρᾶν os ἂν xerevys. He overlooks 8. The proper disposition of 3, 4 is notoriously difficult. Order, how- ever, may be restored by certain simple transpositions and a single slight change of text: ἔστιν ὅδ᾽ ἔτοιμος in 807 for the reading of the Mss., ἕτοιμος ὅδ᾽ ἐστὶν, and εἰς δ᾽ ἄπορον ὅταν πέσῃς, τάχιστ᾽ in 703 f. for ταχὺς δ᾽ ὅταν εἰς ἄπορον πέσῃς. When the order became confused τάχιστ᾽ gave rise to ταχὺς δ, With -τυυυ (3) as the second syzygy of a lyric iambic trimeter, cf. Ran. 398 (Ἴακχε πολυτίμητε, μέλος ἑορτῆς), 399, 403 (υ-υυν) and in a lyric tetrameter, Plut. 292. See also Eccl. 971 = 975. ‘The occurrence of Yvuvv as the first syzygy of a lyric iambic trimeter or dimeter (5) is not rare. Cf. Ach. 1158 = 1 See Luthmer, De Choriambico et Ionico a minore adiiambi loco positis (1884), Ῥ. 45 f. Von Wilamowitz in his Jsyélos von Epidauros (1886), p. 136, classified this lyric as Ionic. ‘ Logaoedic’ Metre in Greek Comedy 5 1170, Eccl. 972, Thesm. 353, 999, Vesp. 1466. On the occurrence of --vvuv in a choriambic colon, where the text is not to be impugned, see the next lyric. The correspondence of choriamb and iambic syzygy (3) is not uncommon. See the second lyric below (Vesp. 526 ff.). On the apparent initial anapaest in 8, see p. 8. Cola 7-9 are lacking in the ode.

Vou Bergk proposed λέγων ἀμείνων πότερος (5) to replace the reading of the Mss. ὁπότερος αὐτοῖν λέγων ἀμείνων, in which the dual αὐτοῖν is a gloss on an original πότερος.

In 6 ζῶντες τότ᾽ ἐπὶ is the sole example of an iambic syzygy of this form (--vuv) in a choriambic dimeter in Aristophanes, but it has just been seen that both this form and v—vvv occur as the first syzygy in iambic cola that are constituent parts of these choriambic lyrics.

In the last case Porson doubted the equivalence of choriambic dimeter and Glyconic. I know no exact parallel to this in comedy (Hermann proposed one in Thesm. 990 = 995 — see p. 20 below), but this correspondence is not so difficult as that in Eq. 332 = 406, where the parody fixes the form and forbids emendation. In 534 Bentley added νῦν, transferring it from 536. Porson corrected (542 f.) δ᾽ ἂν ἐν ταῖσιν ὁδοῖσιν (ὁδοῖς R) ἁπάσαις. . . καλοίμεθ᾽ R V to the reading given above. The last syzygy of colon 13 of the antode is lacking in the Mss. Besides the four cases of correspondence of choriambus with iambic syzygy that are found in the lyric under consideration, the following also occur in cola that have not been emended: ~tu. Lys. 324 = 338, You. Lys. 326 = 340, ~Yu— Ach. 1151 = 1163. Thus —vvu— occurs . four times, YOu twice, and Juv once. I add, in order to afford means of comparison, the correspondences in lyric iambic syzygies, the text of which has not been emended, that occur among the lyrics discussed in this paper: Gv.

Three forms are found in the first half of a choriambic dimeter in this lyric that have not previously occurred: (1) νυυυ.- (4, 5, 10). Cf. Vesp. 1453 = 1465, 1455, 1456 = 1468, and the discussion of Aves 1372 ff. (p. 11 f.), a comic parody. The same form occurs as the first syzygy of an iambic dimeter in Ach. 1156, 1157. (2) -vuue (5, 10). Cf. Vesp. 1467. Also in an iambic dimeter in Ach. 1169. (3) vu—v— (13). This anapaest is generally excluded by the commenta- tors, beginning with Bentley, who proposed σὰς πολιοῦχ᾽, not in itself a felicitous change of text. Another apparent instance of the anapaest in choriambic verse occurs in Eccles. 940 = 944, but this cannot be cited as evidence of the usage of Aristophanes, since in Eccles. 938 ff. 8 Fohn Williams White the poet is imitating the common form of the scolium, in which the metrical constitution of the last two verses is uncertain. To pass to lambics, taxéws in Nub. 812 is no doubt a dissyllable, and in Thesm. 355 the metre may be Ionic: vu_v_v—. (anaclasis). The anapaest does not occur, so far as I have observed, in any of the pure iambic lyrics of Aristophanes. On the other hand, it is found in two poly- schematist dimeters in both R and V, Vesp. 1461 = 1473. See p. 23. In Vesp. 1458, Kiister’s change of φύσεως (R, V) to φύσεος is probably right. Here the antode (1470) shows υυυ. The natural inference from these facts is that the anapaest is faulty in all these places, espe- cially when one recalls to mind the assault that Aristophanes, in Ran. 1322 ff., makes upon its use by Euripides in Glyconics. See p. 29 ff. A form of iambic dimeter occurs in the antode of this lyric (4) that must be accounted defective (-vuv-vu ~-v.), but who shall say that Aristophanes did not compose it? Here also the commentators have essayed changes: ws τριταλανταῖα βάρος Bentley, δεῦρο τριτάλαν- τόν τι βάρος Reisig, etc., but the same fault is found in two iambic dimeters in the same play (Lys. 277 278). Reisig’s conclusion that the two cola just cited are Glyconics is invalidated (to say no more) by the strictness of Glyconic form everywhere maintained by Aristophanes. To avoid the correspondence You. in 7, Meineke proposed ras κύνας for γυναῖκας (Mss.). On the form of the catalexis of the trimeter in 3 compare the tetra- meter in Av. 1724 f.

Two choriambic tetrameters and an iambic dimeter and dochmius. The dochmius is here admirably adapted to express the emotion of the singer, and occurs in just this form, in connection with iambics, else- where in Aristophanes in passages of intense feeling, in comic imitation ‘Logaoedic’ Metre in Greek Comedy 9 or parody of tragedy. Cf. Ach. 1219, 1221; Nub. 1163, 1164; Vespae 730 = 744 (Yvu.v_|Guv_v_) and 873 = 890. On the form of the fifth colon, see p. 4 f. In 970, ὦ ἱκετεύω is a case of synizesis, since the resolution of either long of the choriamb (here it would be -πὧὐνυν |: v..) is unheard of in Aristophanes, except in parody (pp. 11 ff.).

The close of the first iambic hypermetron is marked by hiatus in the ode and by syllaba anceps in the antode. The contrast in form between the iambic hypermetra is admirably adapted to heighten the comic effect of the sentiment. The triseme syllable at the beginning of an iambic dipody (10, 12) is now clearly established by the authority of Aristoxenus.' Cf. Schol. E (cod.

Elmsley, objecting to the correspondence in 2, proposed τὸν μέλεον τῶν μελέων for τὸν ξυγγραφῇ τὸν (τῶν R) μελέων of the Mss. The form of colon 2 in the ode recurs in Ran. 213. 1 See Grenfell and Hunt, 7he Oxyrhynchus Papyri, Part I, IX (p. 15, Col. II). IO Fohn Williams White Isolated choriambic periods and single cola are found elsewhere in the comedies, as the tetrameter Aves 1724 f. at the close of an iambo- trochaic series ; the catalectic trimeter Ran. 213 ; the catalectic dimeter, at the close of a trochaic period in each case, Eccl. 902 = 908, 905 = gio; and the succession of catalectic dimeters, Pax 785—787 = 807- 809, in transition to dactyls. Choriambic cola and periods occurred in other plays of Aristophanes, no longer extant, and in those of other poets of the Old Comedy. Hephaestion (30, 21 ff.) quotes the Αἰολοσίκων (10 Kock) : οὐκ ἐτός, ὦ γυναῖκες, -UU— ν--- πᾶσι κακοῖσιν ἡμᾶς “υὐ.. ν-- φλῶσιν ἑκάστοθ᾽ ἄνδρες\" HUUe Uo δεινὰ yap ἔργα δρῶσαι -ὐῦοι τς λαμβανόμεσθ᾽ ὑπ᾽ αὐτῶν. | «υὐ-. vin Cf.

The last colon,’ in appearance, is the catalectic form of the preceding cola. The sentiment precludes the dochmius. See above, p. 8 f. Pure acatalectic dimeters occur among the fragments of Aristophanes in 11 and 533 (K.). A tetrameter, quoted by Hephaestion (31, 16), occurred in the ᾿Αμφιάρεως (30): οἶδα μὲν ἀρχαῖόν τι δρῶν BUGS. 205 κοὐχὶ λέληθ᾽ ἐμαυτόν. “υυ.-- υ.-.. This has been called “first Priapean’” (p. 4). It occurs ποῖ infre- quently in Aristophanes in extant plays. Cf. Ach. 1152 f. = 1164 f., Nub. 512 f., 567 f. = 599 f., 957 f. ΞΞ 1032 f. In the Κόλακες of Eupolis (159) it is used by line in a fragment of sixteen verses. Cf. also Eupolis 38 and 361. 1 This combination has been much discussed, and it is thought by some scholars to be the basis of the forms of scoliastic verse that are found in Eccl. 941 = 945 and Vesp. 1245-1247. See p. 17 below. ‘Logaoedic’ Metre in Greek Comedy 11 Cratinus used the pentameter in the IIvAaiéa (172). Cf. Lys. 328 f. = 342 f., and in varying form Ach. 1150 f. = 1162 f., 1154 £. = 1166 f. In the Lysistrata (319, 320) Aristophanes employs two catalectic choriambic tetrameters to introduce the parodos of the women : Atyviv δοκῶ μοι καθορᾶν ma. οὐὐὖ.-- καὶ καπνὸν ὦ γυναῖκες “υυ.. Vou ὥσπερ πυρὸς καομένου\" Ξῦςς, πούς σπευστέον ἐστὶ θᾶττον. “υυ.. vie He has the same verse elsewhere: Nub. 700 f. = 804 f., 949 f. = 1024 f., 951 f. = 1026 f., Lys. 327 = 341, Eccl. 970 = 974. The iambic syzygy which begins the period has the fixed constitution ~-v— except twice, where it is v-v.. Anacreon had used the verse in a freer form (frag. 24) : ἀναπέτομαι δὴ πρὸς “Odvp- υνυυ.-ὖὐ-. πον πτερύγεσσι κούφαις -ὖν.- υ-... διὰ τὸν \"Epwr * ov yap ἐμοὶ υνυν..«υν.. παῖς ἐθέλει συνηβᾶν. -υυ-- ν-- The metricians were here in doubt as to the constitution of the first foot. Did it result from the resolution of a choriambus or of a pure iambic dipody? Cf. Heph. 31, 6 ff.: ᾿Ανακρέων δὲ ἐπετήδευσε τὴν πρώτην ἀϑέυγαν δ᾽ ὅλου ἄσματος ἐκ᾿ τριβράχεος καὶ ἰάμβου ποιῆσαι, ὡς εἶναι κοινὴν λύσιν τῆς τε χοριἀμβικῆς καὶ τῆς ἰαμβικῆης. Cf. Schol. Heph. 181, 14 ff. Aristophanes can have felt no objection to this form ” itse//, since he employs it in the iambic part of mixed choriambic cola, not only in dimeters (Vesp. 1453 = 1465, 1455, 1456 = 1468, Lys. 324, 325), but also in a trimeter (Thesm. 992 f.), and in a pentameter (Lys. 328 f.) ; but in a well-known passage, with rare humor, he has used Anacreon’s peculiar tetrameter ‘with variations’ to travesty the extravagances of the dithyrambic poet Cinesias. In Aves 1372 f. he introduces Cinesias singing the very words of the lyric poet: 1372 £. ἀναπέτομαι δὴ πρὸς “OXvprov πτερύγεσσι κούφαις \" υνυυν.. τά... ὦ... Vie Hereupon the comic poet immediately begins to ring all possible changes (they are all impossible according to his own practice) on the 12 Fohn Williams White form of the choriambus, by means of resolution and contraction. He has Cinesias first display his complicated art by a variation in the first foot of a verse that certainly was not Anacreontic : 1373 f. πέτομαι δ᾽ δδὸν ἄλλοτ᾽ ἐπ᾽ ἄλλαν μελέων ---- ῳψιψῳω .VVe VU. Cinesias is rudely interrupted by Peithetaerus, but continues, varying the first and second feet: 1376 f. ἀφόβῳ φρενὶ σώματί re νέαν ἐφέπων --- ωυψ «ὦ συν «νυ... He is again interrupted, but now with a warm welcome, and goes on heartily, with iambic and antispastic variations : 1380. ὄρνις γενέσθαι βούλομαι λιγύφθογγος ἀηδών. He continues with renewed spirit, in spite of remonstrance, introducing the following interrupted ‘ heptameter’ by a catalectic Telesilleum and ending it with broken Ionics (anaclasis) : 1393 f. εἴδωλα πετεινῶν αἰθεροδρόμων οἰωνῶν ταναοδείρων ---- -«-“ωὦ aoe (wor says Peithetaerus, but the poet forges ahead :) 1395 f. | τὸν ἁλάδρο- μον ἁλάμενος ἅμ᾽ ἀνέμων πνοαῖσι Bainv — ῳυννυυ ωυνυνυν VV. ..Ὁ.... And finally makes a triumphant finish in two finely variegated tetra- meters whose choriambic tone is nevertheless skillfully preserved : 1398 f. τοτὲ μὲν νοτίαν στείχων πρὸς dddv, τοτὲ δ᾽ αὖ βορέᾳ σῶμα πελάζων ἀλίμενον αἰθέρος αὔλακα τέμνων.

II Antspastc Cola Since G. Hermann’s assault upon the antispast and his celebrated invention of a “basis,” scholars have fought shy of this much abused foot and it has disappeared from the modern books. Hermann, to be sure, could not completely abandon the choriamb, and in his hands Sappho’s κατθναίσκει, Κυθέρη, dBpos “Adwws: τί xe θεῖμεν; (Heph. 34, 13) became a “choriambicum cum basi.” The logaoedists go a long way farther and make it ~> | -vu{L|-vu |i | -vu [-ὐ.2 Hephaestion, however, who had no premonition of the advanced investigations of the nineteenth century, and apparently found nothing in antecedent practice to give him pause, recognizes antispastic metre and devotes a chapter toit. This begins (32, 15 ff.) : τὸ ἀντισπαστι- κὸν τὴν μὲν πρώτην συζυγίαν ἔχει τρεπομένην κατὰ τὸν πρότερον πόδα εἰς τὰ τέσσαρα τοῦ δισσυλλάβου σχήματα\" τὰς δὲ ἐν μέσῳ, καθαρὰς ἀντισπαστικάς\" τὴν δὲ τελευταίαν ὁπότε ἐστὶν ἀκατάληκτον, ἰαμβικήν\" ἐὰν δὲ ἀναμίσγηται ταῖς ἰαμβικαῖς, οὐ μόνον τὴν πρώτην συζυγίαν ἔχει τρεπομένην κατὰ τὸν πρότερον πόδα, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὴν ταῖς ἰαμβικαῖς ἕπο- μένην. ἔστι δὲ ὅτε καὶ λύεται ὁ πρότερος ποὺς εἰς τρίβραχυν. It is important to note what the variable four-syllabled element is that under this definition begins the ἀντισπαστικὸν μέτρον. It may be v——v or wv-v OF «πὸ OF vu-v Or vuuv. These are all antispastic ‘syzygies ;’ 1 It has been treated with downright contumely. T. Reinach speaks of it as ‘¢)’horrible antispaste,’’ and in general it is viewed askance by the new school, but possibly it. may be rehabilitated. It is at least true that Westphal’s statement that the antispast was invented by Heliodorus can no longer be maintained. See Grenfell and Hunt, Zhe Oxyrhynchus Papyri, Part II, CCXX (p. 45, Col. VIII, and p. 47, Col. XIV). 3 Rossbach and Westphal’s analysis (Spectelle Griechische Metrik, p. 568 f.) is bewildering. The fundamental part is a choriambic monometer and ‘first Phere- cratean’ (2υυ.-Ζυυ.-.υ..\").Ψ To this is then prefixed a catalectic Pherecratean YG_uvu.), and it is itself then modified by shortening the ‘first Pherecratean’ to the so-called Adonius (2vv-Y). The result (!) is YO-vu—’vus-vuey, yet this is the verse that Alcaeus, Sappho, and Anacreon so greatly affected. 14 Fohn Williams White in distinction from the rest, the first is designated as καθαρά. We shall discover that Aristophanes denied himself the use of one of those forms (vu-v), but that Euripides added even a sixth (υν.....). By Hephaestion’s definition, the second syzygy of an acatalectic antispastic dimeter is iambic. Equites 973-976 = 977-980 = 981-984 = 985-988 = 989-992 = 993-996 973 ἥδιστον φάος ἡμέρας wYuu ν..ὕ..- ἔσται τοῖσι παροῦσι καὶ -Μὸυ viva τοῖσι δεῦρ᾽ ἀφικνουμένοις, -συ vive nv Κλέων ἀπόληται. -ὕυ vi Cf. the analysis of this lyric in the scholium in V: κορωνίς, ἐξίασι yap οἱ ὑποκριταί, καὶ ἐν εἰσθέσει τοῦ χοροῦ ἑξὰς μονοστροφικὴ τετρά- κωλος οὖσα (τετρακώλους ἔχουσα Thiemann) τὰς περιόδους ἐκ τριῶν Τλυκωνείων καὶ τοῦ Φερεκρατείου, συνῆπται δὲ τῇ λέξει καὶ μόνον διακέκριται τὸ Φερεκράτειον, παράγραφοι δὲ ἅπλαϊῖ (Diibnef, ἁπλοῖ V) μὲν έ, ἡ δὲ ς΄ καὶ μετὰ κορωνίδος. Hephaestion also designates this acatalectic dimeter as Γλυκώνειον (33, 9) and the catalectic form as Φερεκράτειον (33,5). Cf. the definition of the pure Glyconic given by the scholiast on Hephaestion (213, 17 ff.). The antispastic dimeter (Glyconic), precisely as the choriambic dimeter and the iambic dimeter, normally consists of eight syllables and twelve times. Bentley proposed the reading of 975 for the unmetrical τοῖσιν ἀφικνουμένοισιν of the Mss., and in 981 Scaliger ᾽γένεθ᾽ for γένοιθ᾽. Musaeus supplied the ay that was lacking in 989.

Aristophanes rarely uses the form of the first syzygy that appears in 1, 3. Cf. Thesm.g91. The song begins with two hypermetra of equal length, and ends with Pherecra- teans. The tetrameter in 7, 8 is a Priapean. See below. Bentley wished to read rovrovt in 1258. In 1256 μέχρι νυνί is due to Meineke for ἔτι νῦν (or νῦν ἔτ᾽) ὄντων of the Mss. The acatalectic antispastic dimeter (Glyconic) occurred also in the Γῆρας (140 K.), and the hephthemimeral form (Pherecratean) in continuous series in the Κοριαννώ of Pherecrates (79), quoted by Hephaestion (33, 5): a” ’ Ἁ a) - ἄνδρες, πρόσχετε τὸν νοῦν Ξρ as ἐξευρήματι καινῷ, ὡς συμπτύκτοις ἀναπαίστοις. ete Wee: Cf.

By this classification, cola 9, 10, are catalectic antispastic trimeters, as in Eccl. 917 = 923 (p. 19). Hephaestion designates the middle syzygy of such metres as καθαρὰ ἀντισπαστική (32, 17 f.). The acatalectic form is the well-known Asclepiadean (Heph. 34, 1 ff.). Weil classified cola 9, 10 as Ionics. See Bulletin de correspondance Hellénigue, XIX (1895), p. 411.1 See also von Wilamowitz, Sttzungsberichte der Kin. Preuss. Akad. der Wissenschaften, 1902, p. 894. But if we take the variable forms of the first foot in antispastic metre into account, what shall be said in expla- nation of Ionic metres in which the first foot becomes v.. or —v-, not to mention the possible νυν.- or even vv? The same analysis applied to colon 14 (the well-known Pherecratean) would give an acatalectic Ionic dimeter (~~~ vvu-¥) closing a period. 1 Compare his Etudes de littérature et de rhythmique grecques (1902), p. 205 f. ‘Logaoedic’ Metre in Greek Comedy 17 A catalectic antispastic trimeter, with the second syzygy iambic, was called by the metricians Φαλαίκειον.

For the apparent anapaest at the beginning of 3, see p. 7 f. above, but the metrical constitution of cola 3, 4, is uncertain. No part of this lyric may be taken as exemplifying the usage of Aristo- phanes, since he here adopts a traditional form of the scolium, which was an inheritance from an early time. Cf. the laughable use our poet makes of the Phalaecean in Vesp. 1226, 1227, 1248, and with colon 4 above, cf. Vesp. 1245-1247. These are the only instances of the combination of choriamb and antispast (in this order) in Aristophanes. — For a discussion of this form of the scolium, see von Wilamowitz, Aristoteles und Athen, 11, 316 ff. Aristophanes has used the Phalaecean, in conjunction with a preceding antispastic tetrameter, the greater Asclepiadean or Σαπφικὸν éxxadexa- σύλλαβον (Heph. 35, 5 ff.), in parodying Alcaeus (frag. 84), in Aves 1410 ἢ: ὄρνιθες τίνες οἵδ᾽ οὐδὲν ἔχοντες πτεροποίκιλοι, τανυσίπτερε ποικίλα χελιδοῖ ; : aan Vem Vow ωνκὦ VV.

Vesp. 1238 (scoliastic).—In Mélanges \\ 18 Fohn Williams White Henri Weil (1898, p. 449 ff.) von Wilamowitz argues for Ionic scan- sion also of the Phalaeceum. See also Schroder’s analysis of the two Asclepiadeans in Philologus LXIV (1905), pp. 493 ff. The free combination of choriambic and antispastic cola, without fixed discrimination of order, is illustrated by fragments of two of the lost plays of Aristophanes.

In 916 I have omitted tov which is read in R before ᾿Ορθαγόραν, and in the next verse have read σεαυτῆς for σαυτῆς (R). On the form of colon that ends the lyric (7), cf. Eq. 559, 560 = 589, 590, and see p. 15 above. For v._u (6, 7) as the first syzygy in an antispastic colon, cf. Thesm. 996, the refrain Ὑμὴν ὦ Ὑμεναίῳ (Av. 1736 = 1742, 1743, 1754), and Pherecrates 109, 4 (p. 25); 131, 7 (p. 18). Choriambic, antispastic, and iambic cola are combined in the following : Thesmophoriazusae 990-994 = 995-1000 995 ἀμφὶ δὲ σοὶ κτυπεῖται 1-οὐὐς:: vee Κιθαιρώνιος ἠχώ, υύσον υ-... μελάμφυλλά τ᾽ ὄρη Ven Um dao ode 1 7 : τ κια πετρώδεις τε νάπαι βρέμονται συυν.. -ὖὐὖ-.

Neither here nor at the end of the ode can εὔιον be right, and Διόνυσε (vu_v) fails to correspond with κτυπεῖται. It is to be noted that all the cola in the lyric are catalectic. Enger reads Eve, ὦ Διὸς ov, but the hiatus is objectionable. Hermann’s εὐοῖ, ὦ Διόνυσε (~v-v vv) involves the least change. For the correspondence in this case, cf. Vesp. 537 = 636 (p. 6). The third colon is a catalectic Phere- cratean. This is singular, but it is paralleled by the catalectic prosodiac (Telesilleum), which is common, and is more likely than an assumed acephalous choriambic dimeter (v-|-vu.). The ode determines the form of 4. In the antode the Mss, read in 998 f. καὶ νάπαι πετρώδεις. The correction is due to Enger. In 994 Hermann proposed ὦ ew’, εὐοῖ εὐοῖ, [ὦ evr, ἀναχορεύων for the faulty εὔιον εὔιον edot|. . . ἀναχορεύων of the Mss. With the preceding lyric, cf. the following.

On logaoedics in the ancient sense, see p. 1. Here these are mainly catalectic tetra- podies (1-4, 13, 16-18) of the same value in time as the interspersed Pherecrateans and iambics. On the trochaic opening of cola 14, 17, see Arist. Quint., p. 32, 37 f. and 33, 30 ff. (Jahn). The logaoedic movement at the close of the lyric (19, 20) is ascending (anapaestic). In 1150 Bothe corrected θεμιτὸν (R) ; in 1158 Reisig ἀφίκεσθον (R). G. Hermann (Epitome, p. 171, cf. Elementa Doct. Met., p. 541) by numerous changes of the text attempted to establish correspondence of ode and antode between parts of this lyric. See also Reisig, Contec- tanecorum libri duo, pp. xxi ff. and 302 ff. Tambic, choriambic, antispastic, and logaoedic cola may be combined in the same lyric, as in the following : Thesmophoriazusae 352-371 ’ , XN ξυνευχόμεσθα τέλεα μὲν 1 νοῦς υνυν.-. l4 , ’ ὃ πόλει τέλεα δὲ δήμῳ υ-υυν υ.-... sad a» s 9 , τάδ᾽ evypat ἐκγενέσθαι, Vav. vin τὰ δ᾽ ἄρισθ᾽ ὅσαις προσήκει νυ.-υ-. vo 856 νικᾶν λεγούσαις \" ὁπόσαι δ᾽ δ -οὖὐς- οὐὐ.. ἐξαπατῶσιν παραβαίνουσί τε τοὺς “υυς. κυυ.. ae 22 Fohn Williams White ὅρκους τοὺς νενομισμένους “παν νου. 860 κερδῶν οὕνεκ᾽ ἐπὶ βλάβῃ. ““““υνον--. ἢ ψηφίσματα καὶ νόμον “που Vea ζητοῦσ᾽ ἀντιμεθιστάναι, 10 nee νοὺυ-. τἀπόρρητά τε τοῖσιν ἔχ- Bee ὡὺς θροῖς τοῖς ἡμετέροις λέγουσ᾽, Seed ου.. ἢ Μήδους ἐπάγουσι γῇ “κυ Veve 366 κερδῶν οὕνεκ᾽ ἐπὶ βλάβῃ, 14 ane νον. ἀσεβοῦσ᾽ ἀδικοῦσί τε τὴν πόλιν. ἀλλ᾽ υνυυ.. υνονυ.- “ας [ὦ παγκρατὲς seo Ζεῦ ταῦτα κυρώσειας, oof\" σούς me ἡμῖν θεοὺς παραστατεῖν Καυς- νου... καίπερ γυναιξὶν οὔσαις. το a ee The ode begins with four and closes with three iambic cola. (On colon 4 see p. 8.) The transition is through choriambic cola (5, 6) to Glyconic, which are followed by a logaoedic hexapody. Bothe corrected ξυνευχόμεθα (R) in 1, Dindorf εὔγματα γενέσθαι (R) in 3, Hermann ἐξαπατῶσι (R) in 6 and ἀσεβοῦσιν ἀδικοῦσιν (R) in 15, and Bentley ἕνεκ᾽ (R) in 8 (cf. 14). In 12 λέγουσ᾽ is due to Suidas (λέγουσιν R), and in 14 κερδῶν to Reiske (χώρας R). Hiatus in 8,14. This is extremely rare at the close of the acatalectic dimeter. Isolated antispastic dimeters occur in the extant comedies of Aristo- phanes, as Vesp. 319-322 (τηροῦμαι xré.) in transition from prosodiacs to anapaests, and the refrain Ὑμὴν ὦ Ὑμέναι᾽ ὦ, Aves 1736 = 1742, 1743, following prosodiacs, and Aves 1754, at the close of a dactylic series. III Folyschematst Cola In all the cola thus far considered in this investigation the only other form that has occurred in combination with choriamb or antispast to constitute a colon has been the iambic syzygy. The choriambic colon, if not pure, is ἐπίμικτον πρὸς τὰς ἰαμβικάς (Heph. 30, 7); the anti- spastic colon always combines at least one iambic syzygy, acatalectic or catalectic, with the antispast or antispasts (Heph. 32, 15 ff.). But there occurs also the combination of antispast with choriambus, in the order named (UYU —vv-), the antispast now admitting an addi- ‘Logaoedic’ Metre in Greek Comedy 23 tional variation of form. Hephaestion fully recognizes and adequately describes this form of the dimeter in his account of the polyschematist Priapean (57, 14 ff.): τὸ Πριάπειον, οὐ μόνον ἰαμβικῇ τῇ δευτέρᾳ χρώμενον, ἀλλὰ καὶ χοριαμβικῇ\" καὶ τὸν ἀντίσπαστον ἔσθ᾽ ὅτε, τὸν πρῶτον τοῦ παντὸς μέτρου, εἰς σπονδεῖον περαιοῦσιν, ἐάν τε ἀπὸ ἰάμβον ἄρχηται, ἐάν τε ἀπὸ τροχαίου, κατὰ τὸ δεδομένον, ἐάν τε ἀπὸ σπονδείον. Hephaestion here unequivocally designates the first syzygy as antispastic, notwithstanding its additional variation of form. It is, in truth, multi- form. The opening movement may be not only vu. and ~v and ~-., but also uuu; the following movement is ~v or ~~. Hephaestion classifies these antispastic-choriambic dimeters, examples of which he found in Corinna, as ‘polyschematist Glyconics’ (58, 3 ff.). The forms that particularly struck his attention were vuu-uv —vu. and ~~. -vu.. Both frequently occur in comedy, especially the latter. This form of the δίμετρον μικτόν occurs in 1457-1461 = 1469- 1473 of the following lyric: Vespae 1450-1461 = 1462-1473 1450 ζηλῶ ye τῆς εὐτυχίας 1 τς. οὖὐς τὸν πρέσβυν οἷ μετέστη eSues. ὥς ξηρῶν τρόπων καὶ βιοτῆς - συ. «υυ.-.. ἕτερα δὲ νῦν ἀντιμαθὼν υνυν.. «ιν... ἢ μέγα τι μεταπεσεῖται δ ὕυνυνυν...-. ἐπὶ τὸ τρυφῶν καὶ μαλακόν\" νυν... -ὖὐν-- τάχα δ᾽ ἂν ἴσως οὐκ ἐθέλοι. υυυν.-. -υὐ.- 1457 τὸ γὰρ ἀποστῆναι χαλεπὸν υυν...- UVR φύσεος, ἣν ἔχοι τις ἀεί. υυυ-ὦ -ὖν..- καίτοι πολλοὶ ταῦτ᾽ ἔπαθον\" 10... ουυ.. ξυνόντες γνώμαις ἑτέρων U--Y vu. μετεβάλλοντο τοὺς τρόπους. υυν.-Ὁ Ὁ The first seven cola are mixed choriambic (1, 3, 4, 6, 7) or iambic dimeters (2, 5). The last five are ‘polyschematist’ dimeters. The normal form of catalexis in the latter, the last member of the dimeter being a choriamb, is seen in12. Hephaestion is perfectly clear on this point. In speaking of catalexis in choriambic metre he recognizes not only an ἰαμβικὴ κατακλείς but also a choriambic ; the choriambic colon, 24 Fohn Williams White he says, has a close of its own (xara τὴν ἰδίαν). Cf. 30, 8 ff.: ὡς ἐπίπαν δέ, ὅτε καταληκτικόν ἐστιν, εἰς τὴν ἰαμβικὴν κατακλεῖδα περαι- οὗται, τοῦτ᾽ ἔστιν, εἰς ἀμφίβραχον, ἣ βακχεῖον διὰ τὴν ἀδιάφορον. περαιοῦται μὲν γὰρ καὶ εἰς τὴν ἰδίαν, τὸν δάκτυλον ἢ κρητικόν. The reading μεταπεσεῖται in 5 is due to Bentley. Here V has pera- πείσεται, and R μέγα πείσεται. In 9 φύσεως is read in both R and V; Ktister corrected this to ¢vceos. In 12 both R and V have μετεβάλλοντο in the ode and: κατακοσμῆσαι in the antode. On this anapaest, see above p. 8. Pherecrates used this metre in the Κραπαταλοί (96) : τοῖς δὲ κριταῖς 1 “υυ.- . 3 a > 907 μὴ πιορκεῖν μηδ᾽ ἀδίκως _Vae -UUK ’ A \\ δ ΄, Kpive, ἢ νὴ τὸν φίλιον Sie τρῶς ”“ 9 4 “Ἂ φ μῦθον εἰς ὑμᾶς ἕτερον δου... vue Φερεκράτης λέξει πολὺ τού- υυυ...-αὐὐ.-. του κακηγορίστερον. “υς-υ UU As Bergk surmised, this was probably the close of the πνῖγος of ἃ parabasis, to which it would be admirably adapted.

Par. 2821.? The combination of the acatalectic and catalectic forms of this dimeter gives the celebrated Eupolidean period (Heph. 59, 1 ff.), which Aristophanes has employed xara στίχον in the parabasis of the Nubes, 518-562. The second foot is invariably a choriamb, the close is invariably choriambic (~v¥)* The forms of the first syzygy in these forty-five verses, arranged in the order of frequency of occurrence, are : ---~ (sixteen times), -..v (nine times), ~v.

In colon 15 of Cratinus 98 the manuscripts of Athenaeus read καὶ xvticos. Hermann proposed καὶ yap, Porson κἀμοὶ, Meineke καὶ δὴ. The resulting form (--vuv) is not found elsewhere. Likewise xdra μυροπωλεῖν in the first colon of Pherecrates 64 is Casaubon’s correction of καταμυροπω- λεῖν. This gives -νυν.- (for ~v-.), which cannot be paralleled in Eupolidean verse. The theory here advanced that the Eupolidean verse is a combination of the acatalectic and catalectic forms of the polyschematist dimeter ' seems to be established by the facts, and the verse, thus regarded, has its exact parallel in the pure Priapean, which combines Glyconic and catalectic Glyconic (Pherecratean). See p.15. The ordinary expla- nation of this period found in modern books, that it consists of a poly- 28 Fokhn Williams White schematist dimeter and catalectic trochaic dimeter, is not borne out by the facts and probably arises from an incautious interpretation of the account of it given by Hephaestion, as follows (59, 1 ff.): καὶ τὸ Εὐπολίδειον τὸ καλούμενον ἐπιχοριαμβικὸν πολυσχημάτιστόν ἐστιν, ἐν ᾧ τὰς τροχαϊκὰς παρὰ τάξιν ποιοῦσι δέχεσθαι τὸν σπονδεῖον\" ἐνίοτε δὲ καὶ ἀντισπαστικὸν καθαρὸν ποιοῦσιν, οἷον εὐφράνας ἡμᾶς ἀπόπεμπ᾽ οἴκαδ᾽ ἄλλον ἄλλοσε. ὁ σώφρων τε χὠ καταπύγων ἄριστ᾽ ἠκουσάτην. It is important to note, first, that Hephaestion’s phrasing, “ pure antispast,’’ shows that he regards the ‘trochaic’ element also as anti- Spastic (see p. 13 f.), and secondly, that the examples which he quotes make it clear that when he speaks of variations in the form of these ‘trochaic’ syzygies of the verse, he is thinking of the first half of it quite as much as the second. This understood, no exception need be taken to his account of it, especially in view of the brevity of statement that he imposed upon himself throughout his Manual. He is explaining the form of a polyschematist tetrameter in which he has observed two prevailing forms in the two cola that compose it, namely -v-G —vv. and .... vv. in the first half and .v-G ~v. and ~~. —v— in the second half, with important substitutes that take the forms Y._Y uv and YY ~v.. He might proceed from any one of these three sets of forms to explain the combinations of ‘trochaic,’ ‘spondaic,’ and antispastic elements that appear in the first and third syzygies, but the ‘trochaic’ is obviously the simplest. The assumption that the funda- mental rhythm is trochaic would be erroneous, but is no doubt furthered by the form of xardAnfgis, since «--αὐ is the normal κατακλείς of both choriambic and trochaic metres. Probably it is from this point of view that the verse named Kpariveov should be approached, as a combination of choriambic dimeter and polyschematist dimeter, but here in the pure form of the verse the ‘trochaic’ syzygy prevails in the third foot to the exclusion of all other forms. Hephaestion describes it as follows (55, 7 ff.): ἔστι yap ἐκ χοριαμβικοῦ ἐπιμίκτον, τοῦ τὴν δευτέραν ἰαμβικὴν ἔχοντος, καὶ τροχαΐ- κοῦ ἐφθημιμεροῦὺς: He then quotes from Cratinus (324) : Ε a 9 Εὔιε κισσοχαῖτ᾽ ἄναξ, 1 κυυ.-. viv. χαῖρ᾽ ἔφασκ᾽ \"Exdavridys, Ui 0k ‘ Logaocedic’ Metre in Greek Comedy 29 πάντα φορητά, πάντα τολ- UU Uae dS a a a μητὰ τῷδε TO χορῷ; πος UK XN i , N πλὴν Ἐϊενίον νόμοισι, καὶ διυυ.- vive ’ Φ 4 Σχοινίωνος, ὦ Xdpov. Huu -υὐ Cf. Cratinus 41, 327. Also Cratinus 9, 146, 210, where the text is uncertain. A polyschematist form of the Cratineum was also in use by the comic poets, which Hephaestion (55, 15 ff.) describes as follows: πολυσχημά- τιστον δὲ αὐτὸ πεποιήκασιν of κωμικοί. τοὺς yap σπονδείους τοὺς ἐμπίπτοντας ἐν τοῖς ἰαμβικοῖς καὶ τοῖς τροχαϊκοῖς παρὰ τάξιν παρα- λαμβάνουσιν ἐν ταῖς μέσαις συζυγίαις, τῇ τροχαικῇ καὶ τῇ ἰαμβικῇ. This would give the form --ὐυ.. Gio. -Ο.ὐ οὐ. He then quotes from the ᾿Αστράτευτοι of Eupolis an example, which he says exhibits his ‘extreme licence’ (37): ἄνδρες ἑταῖροι δεῦρ᾽ ἤδη BOOS es τὴν γνώμην mpocicxere, που ουὐ εἰ δυνατόν, καὶ μή τι μεῖ- “υυ. -οαυ. ζον πράττουσα τυγχάνει. συ cys This is the only example now extant. Finally there 1s a famous lyric in Aristophanes, with which we may fitly lighten the close of this investigation, that is designed to exhibit the ‘extreme licence’ of another great poet, the sources of whose shameless extravagances are first stated in preceding trimeters: οὗτος δ᾽ ἀπὸ πάντων μελοφορεῖ πορνῳδικῶν,Ἶἷ σκολίων Μελήτου, Kapxwov αὐλημάτων, θρήνων, χορείων. τάχα δὲ δηλωθήσεται.

The comic poet has managed to bring together in brief space a great variety of cola.! The first appears to be an extravagant variation of the Sapphic hendecasyllable (Heph. 43, 19 f.), the prefixed syllable striking the note that is heard more clearly in the trimeter that follows in the sixth colon. Cola 2, 7, 11, 17, are polyschematist dimeters, the first two with catalexis, as in the last half of the Eupolidean. These two are not pure catalectic trochaic dimeters, controlled by the colonic stress appropriate to trochaics. Pure trochaic cola have no business in this ‘mixed’ company! In 7, ~vuv— seems a wild extravagance, but it is identical in form with Casaubon’s restora- 1 The metrical constitution of some of these cola is necessarily doubtful, and the attempt to determine it can be no more than tentative in some cases. As to the first colon, Aristophanes has ἀείνων (V-—) in Ran. 147, but ἀενάοις (—vU—) in Nub. 275. In Attic lyric poetry, including the lyrics of Euripides, dévaos is invariably “νυν, The colon, therefore, cannot be iambic (-vyy— vuuu— v—--). Nor can the second and seventh cola be classified as syncopated iambic dimeters, because of the short ultimates. No syllaba anceps occurs in the ode, in acatalectic cola, and hiatus occurs only in 4, where there is shift to a new theme. ‘Logaoedic’ Metre in Greek Comedy 31 tion of the first syzygy of Pherecrates 64,1. (See p. 27.) Cola 4, 8, 13 are mixed choriambic dimeters. Colon 5 is logaoedic, and 6 a Phalaecean, with the first syllable prefixed and trilled. The remaining cola are Glyconics. When these cola are tested by the standard of the comic poet’s own practice, his rival’s reckless and shameful disregard of metrical form becomes apparent. A sufficient number of these cola are deformations, when judged by the severe and simple taste of Aristophanes, to damn the lyric as a whole. He himself never forces a syllable to do double duty, in order to secure a peculiar musical effect (6). He nowhere employs a mixed choriambic dimeter of the form wou -ve (4, 13), nor polyschematist dimeters such as -συν.. —vv (7) and — vu -vvu. (11, acephalous), nor Glyconics such as υν.-.-- vv. and vou vu. (14,161). It is the last two that Aeschylus, as the representative of Aristophanes, especially reprobates. As he holds them up to ridicule, with much humor he incidentally forces Dionysus to perpetrate a third monstrosity (15) of which Euripides presumably was never guilty. Those parts of Greek Comedy, except prosodiacs (p. 2), which have been treated by eminent modern metricians as ‘logaoedic’ have now been fully analyzed according to the doctrine of Hephaestion. The question naturally recurs with which this paper began. Do the lyrics and the stichic periods that have come under consideration consist, as Heliodorus and Hephaestion believed, of choriambic, iambic, antispastic, and polyschematist dimeters and trimeters, of the value, common to all, of 12 or 18 times, or are they ‘logaoedics’ under the modern definition of that term, and is the movement throughout ‘dac- tylic’? I do not propose to discuss this question, but simply to add a few words of explanation and comment. That the current definition of logaoedics does not rest on the authority of ancient metricians is generally conceded. Rossbach and. Westphal state this fact, apparently with no thought that any other view can be entertained,? but Christ® cites Diomedes and Bassus and Goodell ' rf δέ; in R, V. 2 Allgemeine Theorie der griechischen Metrik®, pp. 352 and 355. 2 Metrik®, p. 459: ‘In der That ist der Choriambus nichts anders als eine kata- lektische daktylische Dipodie, und diese einfach natiirliche Auffassung bricht selbst 32 Fohn Willams White appeals to Marius Victorinus! as grammarians who possessed the true doctrine on this important matter, and with varying clearness of appre- hension regarded the rhythm of these metres as dactylic. These three Latin metricians all maintain the doctrine of the metra derivata. Marius Victorinus, to be sure, in one part of the composite work ascribed to him, accepts the nine prototypes which appear in Hephaes- tion and argues, it should be noted, the claims of antispastic metre with special vigor, but elsewhere he follows the rival system. Now it happens that the Pherecratean, if one disregards the variation of the first part of its first foot and allows here only the spondaic form, has noch bei einigen Grammatikern durch, wie bei Diomedes, p. 508, und Bassus, p. 263.” Diomedes in the place cited is writing de versuum genertbus and says (Keil I, 508): ‘© De choriambico: Choriambicus est qui constat choriambo pede, qui est ex longa et duabus brevibus et longa. huius exemplum est ergo ades huc ambrosia de Veneris palude. est in Horatio tale, hoc deos vere Sybarin quid properas amando. recipit hic in imo vel palimbacchium pedem, qui est ex brevi et duabus longis, vel amphibrachyn; qui est ex brevi et longa et brevi.”’ Bassus is writing de Philicio metro and says (Keil VI, 263 f.): ““ Philicius versus ex duplici pede constat, quem bacchicon musici, choriambicon grammatici vocant. habet longam et duas breves et longam, id est trochaeum et iambum. . . . exemplum eius tale est, frugiferae sacra deae quae colitis mystica iunctaeque Iovi nefasto. hunc hexametrum ex numero bacchico composuit Philicus, quo usus et etiam Arche- bulus, de quo auctore supra rettuli; clusit autem antibaccheo. numerus hic frequens est apud lyricos et praecipue apud Alcaeum, Sappho, Anacreonta. nascitur tamen et hic ab heroo, cuius dactylo primo, qui constat ex longa et duabus brevibus, si iunxeris sequentis dactyli uel spondei syllabam primam, facies choriambum hoc modo, ‘ arma virum,’ et in sequenti versu ‘Italiam.’ ad summam pentametrum heroum, qui habet dactylos primos duos, velut hunc, unde meus veniat mollis in ora liber, adiectis duabus syllabis longis facies choriambicum ex heroo pentametro sic, unde meus mznc veniat mollis in 4aec ora liber, et dum meus assiduo luceat igne focus sic, dum meus 4c assiduo luceat 4oc igne focus.’’ What light do Diomedes and Bassus here throw on the rhythm of choriambic metre? 1 Chapters on Greek Metric, pp. 225 ff. ‘Logacedic’ Metre in Greek Comedy 33 precisely the metrical constitution of one of the forms with which the heroic hexameter closes (_.-vu-¥). This is, of course, a large ‘if’; even conservative Aristophanes begins the Pherecratean with four inter- changeable forms. Furthermore the Glyconic, if one fixes the form of its beginning in the same fashion as in the Pherecratean, and accounts its last syllable anceps and assumes it to be always short (it is always long in Aristophanes), has the metrical constitution of one of the forms with which the hexameter may open (~--vu_vv). The Glyconic and Pherecratean, therefore, were a great resource for any metrician who was endeavoring to prove that Greek metres were derived from the heroic hexameter. Accordingly we find, in the prolix pages ascribed to Victorinus, all possible changes rung on his tiresome “sic te diva potens Cypri’ and “grato Pyrrha sub antro.” Not that he regarded the metrical constitution of the Glyconic as dactylic; three times in describing metres of Horace (and also elsewhere) he composes it of spondeus, choriambus, and pariambus (trochaeus, spondeus). But it was extremely useful to him in arguing for his fantastic and unhistorical theory of the derivation of metres. That is the purpose with which he rings the changes on the Glyconic, and one should be cautious in assum- ing that he has any other, namely that he believes and is endeavoring to show that the rhythm of this colon, as apart from its metre, is dactylic, a conception that in itself is not easy to grasp. There isa striking passage in the first chapter of his fourth book! which seems 1 «© Ad summam omnia metra, et quae inter se congruunt, et quae temporum ratione contraria sunt, si plenius consideres, ab heroo traducta sunt. et mehercules siquis excutere penitus velit, inveniet, ut supra diximus, omnia genera ab hexametro heroo et trimetro iambico derivata, quamvis et iambicum heroi sit traductivum, nec quicquam sine his per se posse subsistere. unde, ut diximus, haec duo metra ut elementa ceterorum ac semina habenda merito ac dicenda sunt. haec ita videri atque esse, ut diximus, si studiosa contemplatione exempla quae proponuntur adverteris, adprobabis. nam metrorum species, quamvis generis sui privilegio distinctae sint, tamen misceri inter se atque diversis communia effici ea videlicet ratione, qua cuncta, ut dictum est, ex eadem origine atque uno fonte derivantur, sic comprehenditur. legimus apud Horatium sic te diva potens Cypri: hoc glyconium metrum dicitur, quod constat ex spondeo choriambo et ultimo trochaeo vel eodem spondeo. commune hoc esse cum heroo trimetro, quod constat ex spondeo et duobus dactylis, cunctis in promptu est,’’ etc. (Keil VI, 146, 147.) 34 Fohn Williams White to show clearly what his sole purpose is in the prolonged argumentation of this chapter and of most of the third book. There is no hint here, or elsewhere, that he is rhythmizing. Whoever believes that he is must accept the consequence, and be prepared to find dactylic rhythm not only in antispastic and choriambic metre, but also in both the Ionic forms.? Those who reject the doctrine of Heliodorus and Hephaestion some- times speak in a light-hearted and semi-contemptuous way of the cola and periods recorded in the Manual as “ paper-schemes,” and assert that Hephaestion’s mode of procedure, in determining the constitution of a metrical series, was to ‘chop off’ syllables four at a time, and, if at the end there was a remainder, to take refuge in brachycatalexis or hypercatalexis. This, of course, is pleasantry, as a glance at the metrical analyses of the lyrics discussed in this paper will show. Hephaestion was not ignorant of the allowed substitutions for normal forms in all these dimeters and trimeters, nor of the fact that, as the result of lawful substitutions, feet might contain five or even six syllables, and he had a ‘singularly clear comprehension of the forms of catalexis. But this ‘pleasantry recoils upon its projector, for it seems to be true that the lyrics of Aristophanes, at least, both here and elsewhere duly admit the measurement prescribed by the “schemes” of Hephaestion. Finally objection is taken to the great variety and apparent irregularity = of form in these cola, and it is asserted with confidence that they are not rhythmical. The application of the ‘logaoedic’ theory obliterates in many of these cola, for example in the choriambo-iambic and the antispastic, the metri- cal identity of iambic syzygies that are recognized as iambic by Helio- dorus and Hephaestion. But these iambic syzygies may, for the present, be dismissed. A sufficient number of unmixed iambic cola remain in the lyrics that have come under consideration above to point an important fact. These cola are free from admixture with choriambs or antispasts and are common ground both for those who adopt and for those who reject the ‘logaoedic’ theory and must be dealt with by both in the same manner; whether Hermann’s ‘anacrusis’ is recognized or not does not affect the rhythm of iambic cola. Now it is precisely these iambic cola which show the greatest variety, and for that matter 1 Marius Vict. VI, 127 and 128 (Keil). ‘Logaoedic’ Metre in Greek Comedy | 35 apparent irregularity of form. Nor must these particular iambics be regarded as singular in constitution because of their association with mixed metres. There are twenty odd lyrics in Aristophanes composed in pure iambic metre, and in these are found not only nearly all the forms of the dimeter that have been given above, but also many others, such (omitting catalectic cola) aS υνυν.. vuvuw, vavuy vue, πιοῦν --ν.., YUUUUY υ-υ-, meV ὑνυν., eee ee VU, oe Ve νυν.) UR “΄«συυνυν, νυνυνυν νυνυνυ, efC. In comparison with these iambic cola, the mixed choriambic seem singulary staid and regular, admitting variety of form only through their admixture with iambic syzygies. The anti- spastic dimeters likewise show relatively a small number of different forms, but in these and the Polyecnemanst dimeters the forms seem to be more irregular. But in what does this irregularity consist? The colonic stress in all these cola seems to be iambic. Iambic form, at least, prevails almost everywhere. It is exclusive in the considerable number of pure iambic dimeters that are freely combined, in the lyrics which have been analyzed above, with choriambic and antispastic dimeters ; mixed chor- iambic dimeters and antispastic dimeters are themselves always ἐπίμικτα πρὸς τὰς ἰαμβικάς. This fact may indicate the way to the solution of the vexed question of the apparent irregularity of form and alleged lack ᾿ of rhythm in these dimeters, and this solution may be approached most easily by consideration of the Glyconic. This, in its normal constitution, according to Hephaestion, is υ.---ὦὁ vu—v., antispast and iambic syzygy. The disturbance of the normal rhythm in this dimeter, assuming the thythm to be iambic, may be accounted for by the principle with which we are familiar in modern music of inversion of rhythmic stress, or syncopation. In modern music the rhythmic beat falls on the note at the beginning of the measure ; in ascending rhythm in Greek it falls on the note at the end. Adapting the form of statement to the Greek practice, syncopation in iambic rhythm was the process of inverting the normal rhythmic stress by beginning a tone on an accented beat and sustaining it into an unaccented one so that the proper emphasis was, in greater or less degree, carried forward to the latter.1 Thus, whereas 1 Or, if stress in the modern sense did not exist in ancient Greek, syncopation in iambic rhythm, in which the down-beat follows the up-beat, was the process of invert- ing the normal order of arsis and thesis. I purposely avoid raising a question that has 36 Fohn Williams White the iambic dimeter in it$ normal form would be: GPL δε] Od the Glyconic in its normal form becomes: Ep do. dd This inversion of rhythmic stress may extend to both parts of the antispast. The first part of this foot allowed substitutions. In Aristo- phanes these are ~~ or ~v or vuv. Of the four possible forms, three (v2, ~-, vvG) are legitimate forms of the iambus in this place in the lambic syzygy. The fourth (4u) shows shift of rhythmic stress (J dé Ὶ δ] J Δ᾽ )). This simple explanation of the Gly- conic was offered many years ago by M. Henri Weil in an article in the Revue Critique, the importance of which has not, I think, been properly appreciated.} been vigorously discussed, especially in America, in its application to both Greek and Latin poetry. See Bennett and Hendrickson in the American Fournal of Philology, XIX (1898), pp. 361 ff., and XIX (1899), pp. 198 ff., 412 ff., and Goodell, Chapters on Greek Metric, pp. 155 ff. 1 Revue Critique, VI (1872), p. 49 ff. I quote from p. 52: ‘Je suis plus affirmatif aujourd’hui: je crois qu’il faut tout simplement adopter un témoignage con- firmé par tous les métriciens anciens de quelque autorité, et que la seule chose qui nous reste 4 faire, c’est de traduire les expressions antiques dans le langage des musiciens modernes.

The former is a foot that usually occurs in combination with an iambic syzygy and is marked by shift of rhythmic stress always in the second half and sometimes also in the first. The choriamb, which is rarely used ‘ pure,’ is always marked by shift of stress in the first half, never in the second. Syncopation in moder music, my colleague, Professor Spalding, informs me, always gives an enlivening effect; whatever the sentiment may be that is conveyed by the verses to which the music is set, and it may greatly vary, inversion of stress animates the melody. It is precisely the device, therefore, that we should expect to find applied in ‘logaoedic’ verse, which, to characterize it briefly, is a vigorous metre of all work. That the Heliodorean and Hephaestionic doctrine of metres assumes a ποὺς δωδεκάσημος Or ὀκτωκαιδεκάσημος as the unit of measurement in rhythms in § time is obvious. The dimeter, in particular, prevails everywhere, not only in the metres considered in this paper, but also in lyric iambic and trochaic metres and in the iambic and trochaic tetra- meters of recitative verse. Among these the mixed cola of ‘logaoedic’ metre, it may be conceded, are complex. As M. Weil has remarked in his luminous explanation of the Glyconic, Greek rhythmic was a highly developed art. The embarrassment and difficulty, however, which we pas s’étonner que les syncopes aient été multipliées dans leurs compositions musicales.’? M. Weil has here inserted bars in such manner as to mark off one complete colon of twelve times, beginning as in modern music with the strong accent.

THE MEDEA OF SENECA By Haro_p Loomis CLEASBY I T is a well-known fact that the ancient Greek and Latin writers were prone to incorporate in their own productions, openly and without shame, whatever most pleased them in the works of their predecessors. Every writer of every age necessarily owes much to those who have gone before him, but to-day we should condemn as flagrant plagiarism a great deal of what was then in accordance with universal custom and sanctioned by the greatest names. Indeed, imita- tion was considered as obedience to the laws of literature rather than as a violation of them. Especially in verse did the recurrence of beau- tiful imagery or thought bestow a kind of liturgical stateliness upon a new poem that went far toward ensuring its power and permanence.! This principle was formulated to a certain extent by Ovid? when he replied to a petty detractor that the reason why he had appropriated certain lines of Virgil was non subripiend: causa sed palam mutuandi, hoc antmo, ut vellet agnosct. But we cannot doubt that even in anti- quity there were limits to legitimate imitation, and that these limits have been transgressed in the rhetorical dramas of L. Annaeus Seneca, those veritable treasuries of other men’s literary wealth. Seneca’s general method of composition may be briefly stated as follows. For the foundation some famous Greek tragedy is selected ; sometimes a second play on the same subject, either in Greek or Latin, is called upon for some of its characteristic features (contaminato) ; the situations and personages. are more or less altered in order to secure greater opportunity for rhetorical display; the new tragedy is then built up in a robust, declamatory style and adorned with copious extracts from many sources, especially from the Latin poets. Among 1 See Harvard Studies, XVII (1906), pp. 22 and 58, 66 ff. 3 Seneca Rhet., Suas. 3, 7. 40 Harold Loomis Cleasby these Seneca makes comparatively little use of Virgil, but draws exten- sively upon Horace,? especially in constructing the lyrical portions of his plays. Ovid® seems to have exerted a greater influence upon Seneca than did any other author either Latin or Greek. The two chief reasons why Seneca gave this preference to Ovid are, in the first place, that the latter’s works are exceedingly rich in mythological lore, which was just the sort of material the playwright had most need of ; and secondly, that, however much they may have differed from each other as men, as writers the two are in certain fundamental characteristics closely akin.* . Medea as a theme for tragedy became famous in the master-piece of Euripides, but the essential elements of the plot had already been used by Neophron.® The number of Greek A/eaeas written after Euripides proves the popularity of the subject; of most of these we know little more than the name of the author. In Latin, besides Seneca’s tragedy, plays entitled A/edea were written by Ennius,’ Accius, Ovid, Curiatius Maternus, and Lucan, to say nothing of later unknown dabblers® 1 See Ter Haar Romeny, De Auctore Tragoediarum quae sub Senecae nomine feruntur, Vergilit Imitatore, Leyden, 1877. 2 See Spika, De [mttatione Horatit in Senecae canticts chori, Vienna, 1890, pp. 14-20. 3 The present article is an expansion of part of a thesis, entitled De Seneca Tragico Ovidi Imitatore, which was presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of doctor of philosophy at Harvard University. 4 Compare Norden, Die Antike Kunst-Prosa, 11, p. 892 f. 5. That Neophron’s jZedea was the earlier is not absolutely certain; see N. Weck- lein’s ed. of Eur. A/ed., Leipzig, 1891, pp. 27-30. 6 Tragedies with this title are ascribed to the younger Euripides, Dicaeogenes, Carcinus, Diogencs, Biotus, and Melanthius (or Morsimus), and parodies to Strattis, Cantharus, Antiphanes, and Eubulus. Among the Romans, also, Pompeius Macer composed a A/edea in Greek. On these writers see Wecklein, of. ci¢., p. 24, nate 2; Roscher, Ausfhriiches Lexikon der griechischen und rémischen Mythologie, 2405 f.3 and Th. Ὁ. H. Heine, Corneille’s ‘‘ Médée’’? in threm Verhiltnisse 2u den Medea- Tragidien des Euripides und des Seneca betrachtet, etc., Franzdsische Studien, herausgegeben von G. Kortling and E. Koschwitz, I (1881), pp. 436-438. 7 From the fragments this appears.to have been an almost literal translation; see O. Ribbeck, Die rémische Tragédie, Leipzig, 1875, pp. 149-157. 8 See Martial 5, 53. We have also a Virgilian cento in the form of a Medea, Anthologia Latina of Biicheler-Riese, Leipzig, 1894, pp. 61-79; this is perhaps that of Hosidius Geta (c. 200) mentioned by Tertullian, Praes. Her. 39. The Medea of Seneca 41 in literature, but none of these tragedies is now extant. Of these lost works that of Ovid is by far the most important; Leo! does not exaggerate its value in the least when he declares that for this single tragedy we would gladly give up all of Seneca’s nine. Although one of Ovid’s earliest literary ventures it was received with great favor, if we may-judge from the commendation of two eminent critics. Tacitus in Dia/. 12.says: nec ullus Asinit aut Messallae liber tam in- lustris est gqaam Medea Ovidit aut Varit Thyestes. Again, Quintilian, Inst. 10, 1, 98, speaks as follows: Oviatt Medea videtur mthi ostendere quantum ille vir praestare potuertt, si ingenio suo imperare quam in- dulgere malutsset. Seneca’s Medea is generally considered one of the best of all his tragedies.2> He seems to have employed more care and industry here than in his other plays; the plot is more consistently developed, the characters have more individuality, the language is freer from bombast, and the choruses show a more symmetrical construction. Further, the excellence of the J/edea is shown by the numerous adaptations made of it by the playwrights of modern times.* In studying this tragedy, therefore, we are dealing with Seneca at his best; at the present day it is hardly necessary to state that even Seneca’s best is far removed, both in kind and degree, from the unsurpassable excellence of the Greek drama. At the first glance it is seen that Seneca has borrowed the main out- lines of his plot from Euripides. The bearing of Ovid’s Medea upon 1 F, Leo, 2. Annaei Senecae Tragoediae, Berlin, 1878-1879, I, p. 149. 3 Ovid himself mentions his excursions into tragedy in 4m. 2, 1, 33 2, 18,133 3, I, 11 and 67; Zrzst. 2, 553. 3 See Leo, Sex. Trag. I, p. 165, and Rajna, La Medea di Lucio Anneo Seneca esaminata, Piacenza, 1872, p. 9. 4 For a well-nigh complete list of these, see Th. C. H. Heine, of. ctt., p. 436 f.3 his article discusses some aspects of a few of them. L. Schiller has a monograph entitled Afedea im Drama der alten und neuen Zeit, Ansbach, 1865, which is of much the same nature as Heine’s paper. Biihler’s Aehnlichketten und Verschieden- heiten tn der Medea des Euripides, Seneca, und Corneille 1 have not seen. The modern Medeas are, in general, of little importance; the most significant are the Médée of Corneille, 1635, the A/edea of Richard Glover, 1761, and the “2 7εάφα of Franz Grillparzer, 1824. The last is the concluding play in his trilogy, Das goldene Vitess. 42 Harold Loomis Cleasby the play is naturally much more obscure. Wilhelm Braun, in an article entitled Die Medea des Seneca, gives, besides the parallels from Euripides, numerous citations of resemblances between Seneca’s Medea and Ovid’s extant works, but hazards no conjectures with reference to the lost tragedy. Leo? believes that the striking similarity of thought and phrase observable in Seneca’s play and the epistle of Medea in the Heroides (12) testifies not to any immediate connection between them, but to a common origin in the lost A/edea of Ovid. Leo has limited his comparisons to the epistle and the fragments of Ovid’s play; we shall see in the following pages that many coincidences of word or idea between Seneca and Ovid’s other poems render this hypothesis even more convincing. While incapable of absolute proof, it rests on two very strong probabilities: first, that inasmuch as Ovid was given to the Homeric habit of repeating himself,? he reproduced portions of his tragedy in his later works; secondly, that Seneca, in composing his Medea, \\ooked for suggestions to Ovid’s famous play on the same theme rather than to various scattered passages in the other poems, which, moreover, do not deal directly with the subject.* Two very brief fragments of Ovid’s lost Medea have survived. One is quoted by Quintilian, 755. 8, 5, 6: nam, cum stt rectum ‘nocere Jacile est, prodesse difficile, vehementius apud Ovidium Medea aicit: servare potui: perdere an possim, rogas ἢ Leo® assigns this to a scene between Medea and Jason, and believes that Seneca is attempting to surpass it in 120-123°: 1 In Rheintsches Museum, XXXII, pp. 68-85. 2 Sen. Trag. 1, pp. 166-169. 3 Leo, Sen. Trag. 1, p. 169, gives examples of such repetition; see also A. Liine- burg, De Ovidio Sui Imitatore, Jena, 1888. 4 Leo’s theory has been very generally approved; Ehwald in Bursian’s Yahres- bericht, LXXX, p. 27; Tolkiehn, Quaest. ad Her. Ovid. Spect., p. 107; A. Palmer, P. Ovidt Nasonis Heroides, Oxford, 1898, p. 386; <A. Pais, 72 Teatro di L. Anneo Seneca, Turin, 1890, p. 29; M. Schanz, Gesch. der rém. Litt. (1899), II, p. 230. Tolkiehn now believes, but has hardly proved, that Yer. 12 preceded the Medea (Woch. f. ki. Phil., 1906, 1208 ff.). 8 Sen. Trag. I, p. 169. 6 The quotations of Seneca are made from the edition of Peiper and Richter, 1902; those of Ovid from the Merkel-Ehwald edition, 1888-1889; those of Euripides from the edition of Prinz-Wecklein of 1899. When no title follows the name of Seneca or Euripides, the reference is to the A/edea of the writer in question. The Medea of Seneca 43 merita contempsit mea qui scelere flammas viderat vinci et mare? adeone credit omne consumptum nefas? and 560 f.: vadis oblitus mei et tot meorum facinorum ?! The other fragment is found in the elder Seneca, Suas. 3, 7: esse autem in tragoedia eius (Ovidi) : Jeror huc illuc, vae, plena deo. From these words Leo judges that Ovid’s Medea was a much more furious, maenad-like creature than the heroine of Euripides, and to show that Seneca adopted the same conception of her, he adduces the following passages: 123 f., 382-385, 675 f., 738, 806 f., 849-851, 862-865.7 Even this list does not exhaust Seneca’s store of verses of the same tenor, but it suffices to show to what an extent the bacchic frenzy figures in his portrayal of Medea. As to the place of this second fragment in Ovid’s play, it must be assigned to that portion which immediately precedes the catastrophe, unless he, like Seneca, allowed no gradations to Medea’s fury. In the extant works, aside from many brief allusions, Ovid deals with the career of the Colchian princess in the twelfth letter of the Heroides and in the seventh book of the Metamorphoses. In neither of these places does he relate in detail the slaying of the children, probably because he did not choose to retell the story which he had already dealt with in his drama.® In the account in the /e/amorphoses Medea’s sojourn in Corinth is summed up in six or seven lines, vzz., Me¢. 7, 1: me tandem vipereis Ephyren Pirenida pennis contigit. 1 Her. 12, 75 {. tnay be descended from this fragment. 2 Sen.

Moreover, for obvious reasons this episode could not well have been intro- duced into the Zpis¢/e, and, since it involved no change of form, would have contri- buted nothing to the chief end of the A/etamorphoses. 44 Harold Loomis Cleasby and 394-399: sed postquam Colchis arsit nova nupta venenis flagrantemque domum regis mare vidit utrumque, sanguine natorum perfunditur impius ensis, ultaque se male mater Iasonis effugit arma. hinc Titaniacis ablata draconibus intrat Palladias arces. Although a somewhat petty detail, it should be noted that Aivenzs is found only in Ovid and Seneca.! Again, in Euripides the poisonous flames which destroy the king and his daughter do not injure the royal palace, so far as we are informed, although earlier in the drama Medea considers the destruction of the palace by fire as a possible means of gratifying her revenge.?_ This passage may have suggested to Ovid the use of the conflagration as a means of making the original catastrophe even more terrible. Seneca’s account, 885-887 : avidus per omnem regiae partem furit ut iussus ignis: iam domus tota occidit, urbi timetur seems to be derived from Ovid.® Finally, in line 397 of the above citation from the Metamorphoses, it is said that Medea flees Jasonts arma. In the Greek play, Jason, when he comes upon the stage for the last time, is alone or at least accompanied only by the usual atten- dants of an important personage on the Greek stage. His purpose is to protect his children from the relatives of Creon, who, in their anger against Medea, may put an end to her offspring as well. In Seneca, Jason’s chief purpose in coming is to punish Medea, and stress is put upon the fact that an armed force accompanies him. Just before his entrance Medea cries out, 971 f.: quid repens affert sonus? parantur arma meque in exitium petunt, 1 Examples of this tendency on Seneca’s part to copy rare proper names from Ovid are given on page 61, note 3. 2 Eur. 377 f. 3 Hyginus, Fad. 25 and Diodorus Siculus 4, 54 also mention the burning of the palace. The Medea of Seneca 45 and a little later Jason gives the following command to his soldiers, 980 f.: huc, huc fortis armiferi cohors conferte tela, vertite ex imo domum. We see, therefore, that the testimony of the fragments and of this brief summary from the Metamorphoses confirms the belief that Seneca made use of Ovid’s Medea. II The purpose of this article is to analyze Seneca’s Medea with partic- ular attention to the two chief sources, — Euripides and Ovid.! It will be assumed, according to Leo’s theory, that in general? the resemblance of a passage in Seneca’s play to extant verses of Ovid indicates an origin for this passage in Ovid’s lost tragedy. The opening act has little in common with the celebrated prologue of the Greek Medea, in which the old nurse, the pedagogue, and the children are so artistically set before us. In Seneca we have a furious monologue by Medea in which she entreats the blessings of various deities upon her evil projects and exhorts herself to surpass all her former crimes. Her plans of vengeance, 17-21, 25 ἔν, are already matured, — death for the new bride and her father, a desolate old age 1 Besides Leo, Sex. Trag. I, pp. 163-170, and Braun, 7%. Mus. XXXII, pp. 68-- 85, already referred to, the principal articles dealing with the J/edea are the following: A. Widal, Etudes sur trois tragédies de Sénéque, Paris, Aix, 1854, pp. 133-181; P. Rajna, Za Medea di Lucio Anneo Seneca esaminata, Piacenza, 1872; C. E. Sandstrém, De L. Annaet Senecae Tragoedtis, Upsala, 1872, pp. 45-583 A. Pais, Ll Teatro di L.

For example, the follow- ing is an extremely modest collection of passages from the Phaedra that betray the influence of Ovid: Phaedr. 124-128, οἱ. Her. 4, 53 f., 61 f.; Phaedr. 665 f., cf.

Met. 2, 722-725, Her. 17, 71-74. 46 Harold Loomis Cleasby for Jason, destruction for the innocent children at the hand of their own mother.’ In the Greek drama, with greater fidelity to life, Medea’s plans do not crystallize until much later in the action. Ovid too has contributed but little to this first act. The enumeration of gods at the beginning, 1-12, may be compared with the oaths of Jason, Her. 12, 77-80. Juno, who presides over wedlock, the Sun-god, ancestor of Medea, and Hecate (or Diana), her special patroness, appear in both lists. Jason, in Ovid, mentions no others by name, but adds somewhat contemptuously, with reference to the gods of Colchis, 80: et si forte aliquos gens habet ista deos. In a similarly comprehensive fashion Medea concludes her invocation, 7-9: quosque iuravit mihi deos Jason, quosque Medeae magis fas est precari. The conception of the Furies presiding at a wedding in place of the customary deities, Juno and Hymen, although found in a few other authors, seems a favorite one with Ovid?; Seneca here employs it not only in verses 13-17, but seems to have it in mind when he repre- sents Medea picturing herself as the bearer of Creusa’s nuptial torch, 37-39: | Seneca’s first chorus, 56-115, is in the form of a wedding-hymn celebrating the marriage of Creusa and Jason. The stage picture offered to the imagination is striking: Medea, trembling with the surging passion of the words she has just uttered, shrinks back into the shelter of some protecting corner while the happy throng of youths and maid- ens, perhaps with Jason and Creusa in their midst, suddenly pours over the stage joyously chanting the nuptial strains. We must not forget, however, that we are dealing with rhetorical drama, which was written, primarily at least, not for the theatre but for the declamation-hall. There is no mention of wedding-song in Euripides, for the marriage 1 But 137-149 and 920-925 are slightly inconsistent with this. 2 See Met. 6, 428-432; Her. 2, 117-120; 6, 45 f.; 7,96. (Note the contrast in Virgil, Aeneid 4, 166-168.) For the other occurrences of this figure, see Burmann’s note on Ovid, Her. 2, 117, and Leo, Sen. 7745. 1, p. 165. ᾿ The Medea of Seneca 47 has already been celebrated before the play opens.! Ovid, presumably, deserves the credit for this important innovation, for he treats the incident at some length in the twelfth Zpist/e. If he introduced it into his Afedea, as we have reason to believe, he thereby gives good proof of the soundness of his dramatic instinct, for this episode quick- ens the action of the play and wonderfully enriches the emotional effect. The scene is described in Her. 12, 133-158 as follows: in obedience to Jason’s command Medea is about to leave her home; suddenly sounds of revelry ring out upon the air, more mournful to her than the dirge of funeral horns, for while she does not yet know the full extent of her husband’s perfidy, her heart is filled with premonitions of ill, The faithful slaves stand apart, weeping in secret; none of them will carry the gloomy tidings to the beloved mistress. It is one of the little sons who breaks the terrible news to his mother. ‘Come hither, come hither, mother !’’ he calls out innocently from the doorway, “Father Jason, all dressed in gold, is driving a span of horses and leading the whole procession !” It is the use of the incident itself rather than the ianguage in which it is expressed that is significant of the connection between Ovid and Seneca, but there are some verbal similarities not to be disregarded.” - Compare Ovid, Her. 12, 137f.: | ut subito nostras Hymen cantatus ad aures venit, et accenso lampades igne micant, and 141-144: pertimui nec adhuc tantum scelus esse putabam : sed tamen in toto pectore frigus erat. turba ruunt et ‘Hymen’ clamant ‘ Hymenaee’ frequenter quo propior vox haec, hoc mihi peius erat with Seneca, Med. 111-114: multifidam iam tempus erat succendere pinum : excute sollemnem digitis marcentibus ignem. festa dicax fundat convicia fescenninus, solvat turbg iocos— 1 See Th. C. H. Heine, Corneille’s Médée in ihrem Verhdltnisse, etc., Ὁ. 456, note I. 2 Leo, Sen. Trag. I, p. 168, and Braun, (A. Aus. XXXII, p. 73. 48 Harold Loomis Cleasby and 116f.: occidimus, aures pepulit hymenaeus meas. vix ipsa tantum, vix adhuc credo malum. The second act consists of two parts, —a dialogue between Medea and the nurse, and the scene between Medea and Creon, king of Corinth. In the beginning of the first of these scenes is depicted Medea’s furious despair when she understands the full import of the wedding strains. The same theme, stated in much the same way, is found in fer. 12, 153-158. There follows in each author a passage in which Medea refers to the crimes which she has committed for Jason’s sake ; Braun‘ continues the comparison through these verses, but aside from the general subject, one which it is very natural that Medea should touch upon, the resemblance is not remarkable. An interesting part of this scene, 137-142, which adds a non-Euripidean element to the character of Medea, will be discussed later. In 147-149: alto cinere cumulabo domum ; videbit atrum verticem flammis agi Malea longas navibus flectens moras, we have an expansion of Euripides 378: πότερον ὑφάψω δῶμα νυμφικὸν πυρί. The Medea of the Greek play rejects this method of avenging herself ; Seneca’s more vindictive heroine incorporates it into her other plans. The nurse tries to calm her agitated mistress by various sententious utterances, for which Medea is always ready with a brilliant rejoinder. Comeille is especially successful in his reproduction of this passage of repartee.’ The interview of Creon with Medea is a curious mixture of Euripides and Ovid, and demands a more detailed treatment. Seneca’s Creon, ‘swelling with the pride of Pelasgian power,’ enters accompanied by a numerous retinue. He catches sight of Medea when still at some distance from her, and immediately bursts into angry speech, addressed either to his attendants or to himself. Although these words teem with 1 RA. Mus. XXXII, p. 74. - * Médée, Act I, scene 5. The Medea of Seneca 49 a much greater arrogance than the Creon of Euripides manifests, yet they seem to have been directly suggested by certain lines in the Greek. For example, 181 f.: molitur aliquid : nota fraus, nota est manus. cui parcet illa quemve securum sinet? reminds one of Euripides 282-285 : δέδοικά σ᾽, οὐδὲν δεῖ παραμπέχειν λόγους, μή μοί τι δράσῃς παῖδ᾽ ἀνήκεστον κακόν. συμβάλλεται δὲ πολλὰ τοῦδε δείματος \" σοφὴ πέφυκας καὶ κακῶν πολλῶν ἴδρις. In the next lines, 183-186, Creon says that at first he had purposed to put Medea to death, but that moved by his son-in-law’s entreaties he had changed the sentence to one of exile. Euripides does not men- tion this until later, 455 f., in the scene between Jason and Medea. Seneca also repeats it, 490 f., in his scene corresponding to this. In 186 f. Medea’s gloomy countenance is described; Euripides 271 f. is probably the origin of this. The fierce orders to the slaves, 188-191, seem to have grown from the brief threat in verse 335 of the Greek play : τάχ᾽ ἐξ ὀπαδῶν χειρὸς ὠσθήσῃ Big. Medea, who has overheard Creon’s brutal commands, turns and without the preliminary wailing of the Greek heroine addresses the king with considerable assurance, 192: | quod crimen aut quae culpa multatur fuga? The corresponding Greek is verse 281 : τίνος μ᾽ ἕκατι γῆς ἀποστέλλεις, Κρέον; To reach the next verses betraying a Greek origin, it is necessary to pass on to 249-251, where Medea begs the king to cancel his decree. Seneca takes three verses to say what Euripides expresses in one, 313 f. The beginning of Creon’s reply to this, 252 f.: non esse me qui sceptra violentus geram nec qui superbo miserias calcem pede, reminds one of the Greek, 348 "
