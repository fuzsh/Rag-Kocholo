And the queen of Latin pop is doing everything in her power, to build up the hype.\n\nRecently named one of People En Espanol's 50 Most Beautiful of 2008, Thalia has become the individual most frequently cited on this famous list--surpassing the likes of Jennifer Lopez, Alejandro Fernandez, Ricky Martin, and Shakira--by appearing an impressive 7 times!\n\nIn addition, Thalia is asking fans to decide what will be the new single of her upcoming, 2008 dance album which will be the first since 2005's El Sexto Sentido. Starting Monday, April 28th, you can go to Univision.com and listen to samples of various songs from her new disc. Then you can vote for the one that you most like. Fans' votes will decide what track will become the first promotional single. Summer 2008 is shaping up to be the summer of Thalia!\n\nwww.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?cid=161414#x\n\nStay tuned for more info...\n\nPost by markreede on\n\nSANGRE CALIENTE and TEN PACENCIA are two of the songs that are included in the highly-anticipated comeback of Thalia in the music scene and her 12th album in her discography is hailed by the press as the summer album of the year, mainly of its danceable and summery themes. Check out the sample fragments of her two songs:\n\nSANGRE CALIENTE:\n\nwww.imeem.com/people/gS4Tv_z/music/zdrM-Ivz/thalia_sangre_caliente/\n\nTEN PACENCIA:\n\nwww.imeem.com/people/gS4Tv_z/music/dkVDykGG/thalia_ten_paciencia/\n\nUPDATE: Currently, the fight for these two songs to be her first single is very close. Ten Pacencia is leading the pack with 60% of its total votes, while Sangre Caliente inched with 40%..\n\nPost by markreede on\n\nYou're very much welcome Louie. In fact, I knew this site for a long time and I've seen you campaigning for Thalia here in this forum. Now I registered here to help you do that. Another update, Thalia will tape her MTV for her first single this coming May 16 with Emilio Estefan, Jr. at the helm.. And the 2 days wait for the first single is too long for me... I also voted for Sangre Caliente even though the crowd's favorite is Ten Pacencia..\n\nPost by kinglouiexviii on\n\n@markreede said:\n\nNow I registered here to help you do that.

It's way too boring for my taste.\n\nAnd thanks for the update. I did not know Estefan would be directing her first video, though it's no surprise. He produced the album and has directed some of her videos in the past.\n\nYes, \"ten paciencia\" does seem to be the fan favorite, but I think it's just ok. I guess I have to listen to it in its entirety. Also, are you aware that A LOT of fans are upset that Thalia has gone back to the Latin/Tropical sound of albums like Amor A La Mexicana and Arrasando? How do you feel about that?\n\nPost by markreede on\n\nThanks for welcoming me here. I'm not sure about the date but I'm very confident that Emilio Estefan will direct it, according to Thalia's official forums site. That will be taped on Bongos Music Cafe in Miami, Florida on May 16(??) Yes, I heard that different viewpoints.. Some of the \"fans\" clamoring before that Thalia must come back on her roots, the Latin/Tropical side, but now they are complaining about her latest comeback, they are complaining that Ten Pacencia and Sangre Caliente are in bad taste. Well, they just only heard a FRAGMENT of the songs and now their complaints are heard above the skies.. But for me, it's a good move for her career. Honestly, I don't like her 2 previous albums (Thalia 2003 and ESS) but I think with this release, she would really do all to resurrect her name in the Latin music world..\n\nPost by markreede on\n\nIt's now May 8 and up to now Univision and Thalia.com didn't post anything about the new single.. >:( But what's exciting about the comeback is Thalia is gonna be visible again on MTV Networks.. MTV Tres will show Thalia on Chicas Arriva, this Saturday (8:30PM EST, 5:30PM PST) and her recent album is added on her discography on MTV and VH1 .. (finally) and the title of the CD is LUNADA(*at last, not Thalia.. hehe *) What can you say about that kinglouie??\n\n(Flash: Thalia's newest single is TEN PACENCIA, according to the newspapers in Mexico today.. Her look will be very long dark curly hair like what she had when performing \"Piel Morena\" in Heraldos.. The reason why Thalia didn't release the single in Univision is that she gave way for Luis Miguel who also released his newest work on Univision.com, and promised to release the single TOMORROW..*)\n\nPost by markreede on\n\nI don't know but right now she is unstoppable.. After releasing 2 fragments of her songs (SANGRE CALIENTE and TEN PACIENCIA) in her latest album, Thalia released AGAIN another song from her latest album LUNADA and it is entitled BENDITA.. This song is dedicated by Thalia to all the mothers around the world this Mother's Day, and obviously, Sabrina Sakae is Thalia's inspiration of this song.. It is exclusively available on Univision.com. And in youtube.com, there posted different videos of Thalia in MTV Tr3s, where she is the artist featured for the Mother's (Day) Weekend..\n\nPost by kinglouiexviii on\n\n@markreede said:\n\nI don't know but right now she is unstoppable..

I have been keeping up with everything Thalia has been doing.\n\nLoved her MTV 3 specials. I'm glad that she seems to be willing to really work hard to promote this album, and she's starting early. Her lack of promotion is what ultimately killed El Sexto Sentido.\n\nI really like \"bendita\". Not enough so that she releases it as as single, but it's cute and very personal. I like that!\n\nFinally, \"ten paciencia\". Wow! I think its really, really cool. A return to the old Thalia of AALM and Arrasando, but in a new, funky way. I think it can become a great, summer song. The early behind the video scenes look really fun and sexy. I hope it turns out awesome. I cannot wait for LUNADA!\n\nI promise to be around more often!\n\nPost by markreede on\n\nFor those of you who like the song \"Ten Paciencia\" by Thalia, here's the following websites that you can vote for Thalia's newest single..\n\nROMANIA:\n\nwww.muzica.ro/top/1/Top30-Muzica.ro.html\n\n(Ten Paciencia is on #6, Bendita is on #9, kindly choose de excelent on the drop-down list box to vote)\n\nUSA:\n\nFollow the format written for the first link:\n\nKRIO FM\n\nwww.mediabase.com/mmrweb/7/stationplaylistrequest.asp?c_let=KRIO-FM\n\n(Kindly put your name, e-mail address, age, state (Pearsall, Texas), zip code (78601) and put a message if you want)\n\nKBMG FM\n\nwww.mediabase.com/mmrweb/7/stationplaylistrequest.asp?c_let=KBMG-FM\n\nFor these radio stations, type Ten Paciencia in the song text box located on the bottom of the page (follow the instructions written in KRIO FM):\n\nWAMR FM:\n\nwww.mediabase.com/mmrweb/7/stationplaylistrequest.asp?c_let=WAMR-FM\n\nWMGE FM:\n\nwww.mediabase.com/mmrweb/7/stationplaylistrequest.asp?c_let=WMGE-FM\n\nWKAQ FM:\n\nwww.mediabase.com/mmrweb/7/stationplaylistrequest.asp?c_let=WKAQ-FM\n\nWPRM FM:\n\nwww.mediabase.com/mmrweb/7/stationplaylistrequest.asp?c_let=WPRM-FM\n\nWLZL FM:\n\nwww.mediabase.com/mmrweb/7/stationplaylistrequest.asp?c_let=WLZL-FM\n\nWPAT FM:\n\nwww.mediabase.com/mmrweb/7/stationplaylistrequest.asp?c_let=WPAT-FM\n\nKLVE FM:\n\nwww.mediabase.com/mmrweb/7/stationplaylistrequest.asp?c_let=KLVE-FM\n\nWWVA FM:\n\nwww.mediabase.com/mmrweb/7/stationplaylistrequest.asp?c_let=WWVA-FM\n\nKLTN FM:\n\nwww.mediabase.com/mmrweb/7/stationplaylistrequest.asp?c_let=XLTN-FM\n\nWYUU FM:\n\nwww.mediabase.com/mmrweb/7/stationplaylistrequest.asp?c_let=WYUU-FM\n\nSome radio stations ranked Thalia's Ten Paciencia ranked even not yet officially released,I think because of its early leakage in the Internet (May 12 on USA, May 20 on Latin America):\n\n#30- Cadena 3 Argentina\n\n#27- Radio Latina Paraguay\n\n#2- Radio Corazon 104.5 Ecuador\n\n#1- FB Radio Bahia 96.5 Ecuador\n\nAnd las ultima noticias, Latin entertainment portals in the Internet had posted the news that Thalia will pose nude for PETA. www.peopleenespanol.com/pespanol/articles/0,22490,1808991,00.html\n\n(PETA is an environment advocacy NGO and I believe that Thalia (if true) will do this with DECENCY, unlike with that you-know-who-wants-to-stab-Thalia-to-death is doing this kind of stuff for excessive drumbeating/promotion just to be the talk of the town, at least Thalia's not using a flag.. hehe.. )..\n\nThalia will also rumored to be playing a certain role in a Broadway musicale called \"In The Heights\".. (vidadecelebridad.com) ???\n\nSo many breaking news for Thalia now, hitting the charts well for Ten Paciencia, good promotion and good propaganda for Lunada...\n\nPost by markreede on\n\nkinglouie!!! have a gift for you...\n\nThe official photo for the cover of 'LUNADA\"... Hmm, looks ironic.. I'm thinking of a moon and a party beneath it as a background (* as the meaning of Lunada suggests*) but I don't argue with the artist...\n\nVote for her here as the ARTIST OF THE WEEK in Romance FM Miami!!!\n\nwww.romance106fm.com/zonacero.html\n\nContinue to vote for her in the different radio stations in the USA (*Currently, there are 6 radio stations playing Ten Paciencia in the USA, in its debut week*).. Cick here to see links to vote for Thalia:\n\nthalia.emilaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=189373&st=20\n\nthalia.emilaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=189373\n\nthalia.emilaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=189373&st=40\n\nthalia.emilaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=189373&st=60\n\nthalia.emilaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=189373&st=80\n\nPost by kinglouiexviii on\n\nAmazon has that same cover so far....\n\nI'm really excited to see that Thalia is going back to the latin flavor for this album!\n\nYeah, apparently it's the official, and there's already major controversy surrounding it. It seems it's very similar to the cover used by an Australian rock band for one of their albums a while back. Thalia has promptly responded the speculations through her website:\n\n\"About the LUNADA cover art...\n\nI was absolutely inspired by the other cover when the different concepts were shown to me by the creative team.\n\nEverybody is inspired by everybody and everything is inspired by everything.\n\nI added my tropical flavors and the colors and the style that I wanted to reflect my idea of LUNADA, which is my album art. I am sure this will inspire someone else as a reference in the future.\"\n\n--Thalia\n\n[ftp]http://www.thalia.com/2.0/[/ftp]\n\nPost by Carlitoz on\n\nWow! I just saw the cover of the Australian group CUT COPY and it is very VERY similar, basically the same. What's reflected in the sun glasses and the shadows are the main difference only. Thalia said though that we was indeed inspired by it.\n\nI don't know how to post picture, if not I would put both covers side by side here.\n\nDoes anybody know? The Cut Copy cover is on wikipedia under that group's discography page.\n\nThanks\n\nPost by markreede on\n\nIs this what you are looking for??\n\nGood for Thalia, she's too honest in admitting that this became her inspiration for the cover of her new album.. And as the day goes by, I'm getting excited on buying and listening to the whole album!!! Rumor says that it contains 11 or 13 tracks that are all Latin-flavored (*except for Bendita and for the other one*)\n\nBy the way, fans and anti-fans will really have patience.. In fact, EMI's official statement that the single will be heard in the whole America for the month of May was refuted. In fact, the single will be heard in the whole Latin America, especially in Mexico and Argentina, only this Monday, simultaneously with the iTunes release. (*btw, kinglouie, do you log-in @ Thalia's official forums??*)\n\nMy fearless forecast: Lunada will recuperate all the losses El Sexto Sentido had been gained and it will be greater or as great as AALM/Arrasando...\n\nPost by djtrini on\n\nI don't know why fans are saying that this is the summer song, the song has been played in many clubs from California to san francisco to houston and here in chicago and they have had the same bad experience with the song like I have, dance floors almost cleared only her fans stay to dance... and the album omg it has about 3 covers from ricchi e poveri \"sera porque te amo\" to juan gabriel's \"insensible\", the only good song on the album in my opinion is desolvidandote... I am really shocked that emilio estefan did such a crappy album and I am mad that thalia let herself be talked into making something this bad.. hopefully if they make remixes it will save the album if not same fate as her last album... after hearing the album I am so upset right now it's ridiculous...\n\nPost by markreede on\n\nWell, here in Asia and I think in other parts of Latin America it would be a sure-fire hit.. I don't think that this is a crappy album.. Well, we only hear fragments of the songs and the scrutiny will take place if the album is now in our hands... But I respect your opinion... Btw, after debuting on the #22 on Amazon yesterday, the album went to #17 today... Ten Paciencia also managed to be #1 in 2 stations in Ecuador, #1 in 1 station in Argentina and #14 in 1 station in Bolivia.. The single will be OFFICIALLY RELEASED TODAY in ALL LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES.. I don't know that if it is a delaying tactic/strategy or EMI isn't just that good in promoting singles..\n\nPost by djtrini on\n\nwhat I am most upset about the album is that thalia is a star and for her to let them talk her into doing more than one cover on one album means either her or her production team ran out of ideas.. and if that is tha case then it's time to retire.. I mean come on stealing someone else's cd cover to do her own cd cover, and know more then one song covered that was already a hit with someone else... her album may be a hit because of the fans because her fans can back her up 100% but the album is really bad... like I said before hope they can make great remixes because only maybe like that it can save the album...\n\nPost by kinglouiexviii on\n\n@markreede said:\n\nWell, we only hear fragments of the songs and the scrutiny will take place if the album is now in our hands...\n\nI completely agree with you Mark on just about everything you said. I believe this will be the album that reconnects Thalia with Mexico and Latin America because when it comes down to it: this is an album for fans of Latin music--not necessarily pop.\n\nFrom the early samples, I have to say I love \"yo no se vivir\". The hybrid of reggae, bossa nova, and samba is really interesting--almost as if Thalia was laying on a beach in Brazil when she recorded it.\n\n\"Desolvidandote\" sounds like the ballad corta-venas of the album and it appears like it could become her best since 2002's \"no me ensenaste\". The ballads on ESS were good and showed her great vocal growth, but they just weren't on par with her previous slow songs.\n\n\"Con este amor\" seems to be the most pop of the bunch and I like it. Love the guitar! We'll have to see how it compares with \"tu y yo\" and \"seduccion\".\n\nI for one cannot wait until June 24th!"
