There will be something for everyone at this year’s festival. The 4-day festival will take place on May 9-12 at the Daytona International Speedway. In addition to 150 music artists and five stages during the four-day event, Welcome To Rockville also offers amusement rides, a giant water slide, artwork installations, partner experiences, award-winning spirits, and delectable eats.\n\nTickets and hotel packages are already on sale. You can get a general admission pass for $290, before fees and taxes. You can also buy tickets with a payment plan with just $24 down.

Other acts include Jelly Roll, Queens of the Stone Age, Judas Priest, Greta Van Fleet, Evanescence, Falling In Reverse, A Day To Remember, Breaking Benjamin, Bad Omens, The Offspring, Mudvayne, Koe Wetzel, Stone Temple Pilots, Primus, Cypress Hill, Sum 41.\n\nMötley Crüe will be headlining on Thursday along with Judas Priest, Disturbed and Mudvayne. Limp Bizkit will be headlining on Friday with Jelly Roll and The Offspring. Foo Fighters will be taking the main stage on Saturday with Geta Van Fleet, Queens of the Stone Age, and more. Finally, Slipknot will be closing out the festival on Sunday with Evanescence, Sum 41, and more!\n\nAccording to a press release from Welcome To Rockville, Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe said, “We couldn’t be more excited to come back to Florida. Welcome To Rockville is one of the biggest festivals in the world, and it’s going to be a highlight for us in 2024.”\n\nFor more information on tickets, click here.\n\n6 Rock Bands and the Stories of Their First Gigs\n\nJen was born and raised in the Tampa Bay area.
