        "text": "Rising urban act See All Our 2014 Year-End Charts Here\n\n“Vamos” also claims Greatest Gainer honors on Latin Rhythm Airplay, where it crowns the list for a ninth week. Balvin approaches the longest run at No. 1 in 2014 on the chart, when his own “6 AM” featuring Farruko spent 10 weeks at the top in 2014 (tied for most weeks with Wisin‘s “Adrenalina” featuring Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin). Balvin finishes the year as the No. 9 act on Billboard’s year-end Top Latin Artists recap.\n\nJenni Rivera’s Sixth No. 1 Album: Two years after a plane crash claimed the life of regional Mexican star Jenni Rivera, she returns to No. 1 on Top Latin Albums with 1 Vida – 3 Historias: Metamorfosis – Despedida de Culican – Jenni Vive 2013. The set sold 4,000 copies in its first week according to Nielsen, giving the singer her sixth (and fourth consecutive) No. 1 on the chart. Among women, only Selena has more No. 1 albums, with seven leaders.\n\nRivera is also the highest-ranked woman on Billboard’s year-end Top Latin Artists chart, ranking at No. 5. The next-highest female artist is Shakira, at No. 32.\n\nSantos Hits the Top 10: Over on Hot Latin Songs, Romeo Santos climbs 12-10 with “Yo Tambien” featuring Marc Anthony, giving Santos his 11th top 10.\n\nSantos simultaneously holds four of the top 10 spots (the first time any act has owned a quartet of tracks in the region since Santos himself did it on the March 1-dated chart). On the latest chart, Santos is also at Nos. 3, 4 and 9 with “Propuesta Indecente,” “Eres Mia” and “Odio” featuring Drake, respectively.\n\n“Yo Tambien’s” growth into the top 10 has been an organic one, as the song was not an official single nor promoted to radio stations until recently. The song also rises 9-7 on the Latin Airplay chart in its ninth week on the tally. Its airplay grows to 8.4 million audience impressions in the week ending Dec. 7 (a three percent rise), with WYUU Tampa, St. Petersburg topping its weekly spins (98)."
