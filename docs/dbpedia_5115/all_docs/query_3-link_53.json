        "text": "Who Did It First?\n\nGreat Rhythm and Blues Cover Songs and Their Original Artists\n\nBy Bob Leszczak\n\nTHE SCARECROW PRESS, INC.\n\nCopyright © 2013 Bob Leszczak\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nISBN: 978-1-4422-3067-5\n\nContents\n\nList of Illustrations, ix,\n\nList of Songs, xi,\n\nAcknowledgments, xxiii,\n\nIntroduction, xxv,\n\nSongs, 1,\n\nAppendix: R&B Songs Covered, 255,\n\nFurther Reading, 259,\n\nIndex, 261,\n\nAbout the Author, 293,\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nSongs\n\nA\n\n\"Adorable\"\n\nComposer: Buck Ram\n\nOriginal Artist: the Colts\n\nLabel: Vita Records; Recording: Vita #112 (45 and 78)\n\nRelease Year: 1955; Chart: #11 Billboard R&B\n\nCover Artist: the Drifters\n\nLabel: Atlantic Records; Recording: Atlantic #1078 (45 and 78)\n\nRelease Year: 1955; Chart: #1 Billboard R&B\n\nA black vocal group from Bakersfield, California, got their lucky break when the manager for the Penguins and the Platters, Buck Ram, visited the area. Ram inquired about local talent and was put in contact with the group that would become the Colts. Ram supplied them with a song he wrote titled \"Adorable,\" and it was released on a small Pasadena record label called Vita. The handsome young guys even got a group photograph on the label, donning sweaters and freshman hats. The record began to take off, especially in the Los Angeles area, and the group made numerous local TV appearances. On June 2, 1956, they were announced as scheduled to appear on The Stage Show the following week on CBS. The Stage Show was a summer replacement for The Jackie Gleason Show, and was hosted by Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. It is unclear why the Colts did not appear on the June 9, 1956, episode of the program, as had been announced, but they were not rescheduled.\n\nThe story of \"Adorable\" does not end with the Colts. A cover version by the Drifters on the Atlantic Records label exhibited a lot more polish and savvy, and it became the definitive hit version. Even more importantly, it put the Drifters back on the map after the departure of their legendary lead singer, Clyde McPhatter, who was seeking solo success. It's interesting to note that the lead singer on the Drifters' version of \"Adorable\" is Johnny Moore, who, after a long absence, returned to front the group in the 1960s and is the lead vocalist on the group's final Top 10 hit, \"Under the Boardwalk.\" Moore continued to perform until his passing on December 30, 1998.\n\n\"Adorable\" was listed as a Billboard magazine \"Best Buy\" on October 29, 1955, in the following paragraph—\"Since the appearance of the original Vita disk, excitement on this tune has mounted. The Colts started off with a bang in Los Angeles and later began making noise in New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Buffalo. The Drifters record started later, but in areas where the Vita disk had not been distributed—and in many areas where it had—it showed very good sales, too. While the Colts are already on the national retail chart, the Drifters are not far behind.\"\n\n\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\"\n\nComposers: Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson\n\nOriginal Artist: Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell\n\nLabel: Tamla Records; Recording: Tamla #54149 (45)\n\nRelease Year: 1967; Chart: #19 Billboard Hot 100 and #3 R&B\n\nCover Artist: Diana Ross\n\nLabel: Motown Records; Recording: Motown #1169 (45)\n\nRelease Year: 1970; Chart: #1 Billboard Hot 100 and #1 R&B\n\nMotown was known for attempting to make hits out of their song catalog more than once around. It worked well with \"I Heard It through the Grapevine,\" and it worked well with \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough.\" The latter was written by Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson and recorded originally by the label's most successful duet pairing, Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell in 1967.\n\nIt was even lovelier the second time around, however, when recorded by Diana Ross. Even though \"Reach Out and Touch\" (Motown #1165) was the first Ross solo hit, this was the one that really established her. This finely produced rendition with that very effective spoken part hit number 1 on both the Pop and R&B charts, and set Ross up for a long and successful solo journey.\n\n\"Ain't That A Shame\"\n\nComposers: Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew\n\nOriginal Artist: Fats Domino\n\nLabel: Imperial Records; Recording: Imperial #5348 (45 and 78)\n\nRelease Year: 1955; Chart: #10 Billboard Hot 100 and #1 R&B\n\nCover Artist: Pat Boone\n\nLabel: Dot Records; Recording: Dot #15377 (45 and 78)\n\nRelease Year: 1955; Chart: #1 Billboard Hot 100\n\nBy 1955, Antoine \"Fats\" Domino, a native of New Orleans, had long been a staple on R&B radio stations, as well as a regular over-achiever on Billboard Magazine's R&B charts. However, crossing over to the Pop charts had proven elusive until this memorable release. It is unknown why the title on the original Imperial 45 and 78 was \"Ain't It a Shame,\" even though \"Ain't That a Shame\" is sung throughout.\n\nEven though this Domino tune managed to cross him over to new territory—the Pop charts—there were still some areas of the country reluctant to play songs (even popular ones) by black recording artists. The watered-down version by Pat Boone on the Dot Record label was the answer. It should be noted that the Pat Boone version correctly listed the song's title as \"Ain't That a Shame.\" One would surmise that the original recording artists would be bitter about the cover version and the royalties lost as a result. Truth be told, most are actually glad (in retrospect) that their song was covered (especially those credited with writing their own songs) because of the enhanced popularity. Both versions sold a million copies and garnered gold records.\n\nLater cover versions of \"Ain't That a Shame\" include a Top Thirty version by the Four Seasons (Vee Jay #512) and one by John Lennon (according to legend, this is the first song Lennon learned to play) on the Apple Records' (#SK-3419) Rock 'n' Roll album. \"Ain't That a Shame\" is part of the great oldies soundtrack in such motion pictures as American Graffiti, L.A. Story, and October Sky. It should also be noted that Fats Domino was among the very first inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1986). As of this writing, Pat Boone hasn't been nominated.\n\n\"Ain't That Lovin' You, Baby?\"\n\nComposers: Clyde Otis and Ivory Joe Hunter\n\nOriginal Artist: Eddie Riff\n\nLabel: Dover Records; Recording: Dover #102 (45 and 78)\n\nRelease Year: 1957; Chart: did not chart\n\nCover Artist: Elvis Presley\n\nLabel: RCA Victor Records; Recording: RCA Victor #8440 (45)\n\nRelease Year: 1964; Chart: #16 Billboard Hot 100\n\nNot to be confused with the Jimmy Reed song (Vee Jay #168) of the same name, this \"Ain't That Lovin' You, Baby?\" was written by Clyde Otis (often paired with Brook Benton) and Ivory Joe Hunter. The first version of the song was by an African American rocker named Eddie Riff on the tiny Dover Records label, recorded in 1956 and released in 1957. The opening line about riding around the world in an old oxcart is very memorable. This version did not chart.\n\nElvis Presley recorded a version of the song in 1958, but it was held in the can for six years. When finally released in 1964, it was paired with \"Ask Me\" on 45 and both sides made the Top 20 on the Pop charts. Both sides were later included on Elvis' Gold Records, Volume 4 (RCA Victor #3921).\n\n\"Ain't Too Proud To Beg\"\n\nComposers: Eddie Holland and Norman Whitfield\n\nOriginal Artist: the Temptations\n\nLabel: Gordy Records; Recording: Gordy #7054 (45)\n\nRelease Year: 1966; Chart: #13 Billboard Hot 100 and #1 R&B\n\nCover Artist: the Rolling Stones\n\nLabel: Rolling Stones Records; Recording: Rolling Stones #19302 (45)\n\nRelease Year: 1974; Chart: #17 Billboard Hot 100\n\nSmokey Robinson was replaced by Norman Whitfield as official songwriter for the Temptations as of this hit, \"Ain't Too Proud to Beg.\" Just like the group's prior release, \"Get Ready,\" the song hit number 1 on the R&B charts, but failed to make Top 10 on the Pop charts.\n\n\"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\" did manage to sell a million copies for the Temptations. The song was covered about eight years later by the Rolling Stones, and once again it became a Top 20 hit on the Pop charts.\n\nThe Temptations' rendition of the song was later repopularized by its inclusion in the soundtrack for the motion picture The Big Chill.\n\n\"All By Myself\"\n\nComposers: Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew\n\nOriginal Artist: Fats Domino\n\nLabel: Imperial Records; Recording: Imperial #5357 (45 and 78)\n\nRelease Year: 1955; Chart: #1 Billboard R&B\n\nCover Artist: Roy Hall\n\nLabel: Decca Records; Recording: Decca #29697 (45 and 78)\n\nRelease Year: 1955; Chart: did not chart\n\nIt didn't make the Pop charts, but \"All by Myself\" by Antoine \"Fats\" Domino hit number 1 on the R&B charts. This was the follow-up to the smash hit \"Ain't That a Shame,\" so it's odd that it didn't make the Pop charts.\n\nTrying to cash in on that fact was an artist named Roy Hall, whose cover records resembled those of Bill Haley and the Comets. Hall was even on the same record label as Haley—Decca. This was one time, however, when the cover version of the song didn't catch on—even though it featured some fine guitar work, and it was released by a major label.\n\n\"All I Ever Need Is You\"\n\nComposers: Jimmy Holiday and Eddie Reeves\n\nOriginal Artist: Ray Charles\n\nLabel: ABC/TRC Records; Recording: ABC/TRC #726 (LP)\n\nRelease Year: 1971; Chart: did not chart\n\nCover Artist: Sonny and Cher\n\nLabel: Kapp Records; Recording: Kapp #2151 (45)\n\nRelease Year: 1971; Chart: #7 Billboard Hot 100\n\nRay Charles's Volcanic Action of My Soul LP from 1971 didn't even make the Top 50 on the album charts. However, it did yield a famous song—famous for someone else.\n\nCharles recorded the original version of \"All I Ever Need Is You.\" It was covered late in 1971 by Sonny and Cher, and was assisted by frequent performances on The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour on CBS. The tune worked very well as a duet and had a message similar to one of their earlier hits, \"I Got You, Babe.\" The duo suddenly had themselves yet another Top 10 hit.\n\n\"Always Something There To Remind Me\"\n\nComposers: Burt Bacharach and Hal David\n\nOriginal Artist: Lou Johnson\n\nLabel: Big Hill Records; Recording: Big Hill #552 (45)\n\nRelease Year: 1964; Chart: #49 Billboard's Hot 100 and #12 R&B\n\nCover Artist: Naked Eyes\n\nLabel: EMI America Records; Recording: EMI America #1855 (45)\n\nRelease Year: 1983; Chart: #8 Billboard Hot 100\n\nMuch in the same manner as Arthur Alexander, the very talented Brooklynborn singer Lou Johnson recorded several songs later made much more famous by others. Among them is \"Always Something There to Remind Me\"—a Burt Bacharach and Hal David composition. Johnson's version (along with a litany of other marginally successful versions by Dionne Warwick, Sandie Shaw, and R. B. Greaves) featured a very similar light and breezy Latin beat.\n\nIt would, however, take a whole new approach and direction for the song to finally become a Top 10 smash. This brand-new, innovative version came about almost two decades after the original when recorded by Peter Byrne and the late Rob Fisher—collectively known as Naked Eyes. This version featured a very loud orchestral opening and some very prominent percussion throughout. Gone was the Latin beat, exchanged for a more techno-pop feel. The group hit pay dirt one more time when their follow-up, \"Promises, Promises,\" made it to number 11 on the Pop charts.\n\n\"Anna (Go To Him)\"\n\nComposer: Arthur Alexander\n\nOriginal Artist: Arthur Alexander\n\nLabel: Dot Records; Recording: Dot #16387 (45)\n\nRelease Year: 1962; Chart: #68, Billboard Hot 100 and #10 R&B\n\nCover Artist: the Beatles\n\nLabel: Vee Jay Records; Recording: Vee Jay #1062 (LP)\n\nRelease Year: 1963; Chart: did not chart\n\nArthur Alexander was truly a great, unheralded recording artist in his day, and yet he had a huge influence upon some of the biggest names in music (the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan, to name a few). Alexander, a native of Alabama, never had a Top 20 hit of his own, but the amount and caliber of the cover versions of his songs sealed his legacy. He released his first recording under the name of June Alexander on the Judd Records label (Judd #1020) before signing with the much larger Dot Records label, where he would have a modicum of chart successes.\n\nBecause of their immense worldwide popularity, the Beatles' version of \"Anna (Go to Him)\" is the definitive one—the one most people will remember. However, surprisingly, that version never charted. In fact, besides its inclusion on Vee Jay's Introducing the Beatles album (Vee Jay #1062), it only appeared on a couple of specially made rare 45s—a special EP titled A Souvenir of Their Visit to America (Vee Jay EP #1-903) and an even rarer special promotional 45 (Vee Jay Special DJ #8) on which \"Anna\" is backed with \"Ask Me Why.\"\n\n\"Anna (Go to Him)\" is the focus of a very memorable episode of Married with Children titled \"Oldies but Young 'Uns\" (season 5, episode 17), which first aired March 17, 1991. In the episode, Al Bundy is driven to distraction trying to figure out the title and artist of this song, which he heard on his car radio. He hums it for his family, but, as usual, they are of no help. It's interesting to note that playing in this episode is the original Arthur Alexander rendition. Featured in the episode is a young and yet unknown Matt LeBlanc as Vinnie, Kelly's dimwitted new boyfriend.\n\n\"Another Saturday Night\"\n\nComposer: Sam Cooke\n\nOriginal Artist: Sam Cooke\n\nLabel: RCA Victor Records; Recording: RCA Victor #8164 (45)\n\nRelease Year: 1963; Chart: #10 Billboard Hot 100 and #1 R&B\n\nCover Artist: Cat Stevens\n\nLabel: A & M Records; Recording: A & M #1602 (45)\n\nRelease Year: 1974; Chart: #6 Billboard Hot 100\n\nProduced by legends Hugo Peretti and Luigi Creatore, a song written by Sam Cooke titled \"Another Saturday Night\" peaked at number 10 on the Hot 100 in 1963. The lyrics bemoan being new in town and not having a date on consecutive Saturday nights. We are also privy to the results of his disastrous blind date.\n\nOver a decade later, a remake of the song by Cat Stevens reached an even higher position on the charts than the original. More importantly, however, the Stevens version encouraged new interest in the music of Sam Cooke, with more cover versions of his songs appearing (including \"Only Sixteen\" by Dr. Hook and \"Wonderful World\" by James Taylor—see the entry for each).\n\nHowever, gone from the Cat Stevens cover of \"Another Saturday Night\" was Cooke's very cool and swagger-laden line, \"How I wish I had some chick to talk to.\" Stevens only ever sings, \"How I wish I had someone to talk to.\"\n\n\"Any Day Now\"\n\nComposers: Burt Bacharach and Bob Hilliard\n\nOriginal Artist: Chuck Jackson\n\nLabel: Wand Records; Recording: Wand #122 (45)\n\nRelease Year: 1962; Chart: #23 Billboard Hot 100 and #2 R&B\n\nCover Artist: Ronnie Milsap\n\nLabel: RCA Victor Records; Recording: RCA Victor 13216 (45)\n\nRelease Year: 1982; Chart: #14 Billboard Hot 100\n\nBurt Bacharach is best known for co-writing a laundry list of great songs with Hal David. There are a few exceptions, however, and the song \"Any Day Now (My Wild Beautiful Bird)\" is among them. This one was co-written with former Tin Pan Alley lyricist Bob Hilliard. The tune was presented to Chuck Jackson (formerly of the Dell-Vikings doo-wop group)—a rising star recording for the Scepter Records' subsidiary, Wand Records, and it became his biggest hit. After a brief stay at Wand, Jackson tried his luck at Motown but met with only modest success.\n\nElvis Presley recorded a version of the song, and it was placed on the flip side of \"In the Ghetto\" on RCA Victor in 1969 (RCA Victor #47-9741). However, it was another version on RCA Victor by blind country singer Ronnie Milsap that truly gave the song a second life. Milsap was able to cross over to the Pop charts with many songs—among them, tunes from a bygone era (\"Lost in the Fifties Tonight\" and \"Any Day Now\").\n\nBob Hilliard was inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame in 1983, posthumously.\n\n\"At MY Front Door\"\n\nComposers: John Moore and Ewart Abner\n\nOriginal Artist: the El Dorados\n\nLabel: Vee Jay Records; Recording: Vee Jay #147 (45 and 78)\n\nRelease Year: 1955; Chart: #17 Billboard Hot 100 and #1 R&B\n\nCover Artist: Pat Boone\n\nLabel: Dot Records; Recording: Dot #15422 (45 and 78)\n\nRelease Year: 1955; Chart: #7 Billboard Hot 100\n\n(Continues...)Excerpted from Who Did It First? by Bob Leszczak"
