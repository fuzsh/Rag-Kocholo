We use genomic data to infer which populations from Europe and the Americas contributed to these admixture events. We provide evidence for multiple origins of the Native American ancestry of admixed South American Latinos. The Native American ancestral component correlates strongly with geography, indicating that admixture occurred between European colonists and local Native American populations throughout South America. We also show that the European ancestry of South American Latinos comes mainly from the Iberian peninsula, however, a significant number of Argentinians have European ancestry from other Southern European regions. The genetic signal of European admixture in South American populations is younger than the signal observed in Mexico and the Caribbean. We find evidence for a second pulse of European migration to many regions of South America subsequent to the original colonization. These results demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of the Latino population in South America and help elucidate the complex genetic and admixture events that shaped the population structure of the region.",

        "text": "Global ancestry composition\n\nTo characterize the ancestral components of South American Latino individuals from Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and Argentina, we applied unsupervised clustering models and principal components analysis to genotype data from ancestral and admixed populations (Fig 1) (see Methods). This data set contains 436 admixed South American individuals together with 204 European individuals from the POPRES study [1], 50 Yoruban and 50 Han Chinese from the 1000 Genomes Project [3], and 493 unmasked Native American individuals from Reich et al. 2012 [9]. The South American individuals showed varying proportions of European, Native American and, to a lesser extent, West African ancestry in PCA space, supporting the notion of a broad range of global ancestry patterns throughout South America. We observed some dispersion of Native American individuals away from the main ancestral cluster due to the presence of European admixture.\n\n(a) Principal Components Analysis of admixed individuals and continental reference panels. Each individual is represented as a point colored by country, region, or continent of origin. (b) Map of sampled populations. Countries of origin for admixed South Americans are highlighted and colored as in (a). (c) ADMIXTURE plot of admixed individuals and continental reference panels. Each individual is represented as a thin vertical bar. The colors represent the proportion of ancestry assigned to each cluster for each individual. K = 4 and K = 13 models are shown above, K = 2 through K = 15 models are available in S4 and S5 Figs.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005602.g001\n\nWe then ran clustering models for K = 2 through K = 15 ancestral populations with ADMIXTURE [25] on a total of 1,233 individuals. Cross validation errors for the ADMIXTURE analysis are shown in S2 Fig. The minimum CV error was observed at K = 13. When clustering is performed assuming K = 4 ancestral populations (Fig 1C), the algorithm separates the individuals into four major continental clusters. Average continental ancestry proportions for each of the admixed populations are shown in Table 1. As expected from historical records [21,22] and previous results from other Latino populations in the Caribbean [6] and Mexico [5], South American Latino individuals show a mixture of European, Native American, and African ancestry. However, some populations, especially those in Peru, Chile, and Argentina, tend to have a smaller proportion of African ancestry than seen in Latino populations in the Caribbean (p < 2.2 x 10−16, Wilcoxon test, S6 Fig), also observed in previous analyses [13,16–18]. We find significant differences in global ancestry proportions between countries within South America. The Peruvian individuals tend to have a higher proportion of Native American ancestry than individuals from any of the other South American populations (Tukey HSD Test, p < 0.001 vs. Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador; S3 Fig). We observed multiple Peruvian individuals with a >25% proportion of East Asian ancestry, which is not surprising given that there were large Asian migrations to Peru especially during the 19th and early 20th century where laborers from Guandong (formerly Canton) province in China were brought to the country [26]. Peru opened its borders to Asian immigration in 1849, and it is estimated that over 87,000 Chinese individuals entered Peru between 1859 and 1874 [22]. This East Asian ancestry component is also seen in the Northern Amerindian individuals. These individuals are from Eskimo, Aleut, and Na-Dene populations and the observed clustering is consistent with the hypothesis of multiple waves of gene flow from Asia to America suggested by a previous study [9]. At higher values of K in ADMIXTURE, these individuals are assigned to their own ADMIXTURE component, indicating a unique ancestry component that is separate from the East Asian cluster (Fig 1 and S5 Fig).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005602.t001\n\nThe Argentinian population has a significantly higher proportion of European ancestry than the Peruvian, Chilean, and Ecuadorian populations (Tukey HSD Test, p = 0.018 vs. Chile, p = 0.129 vs. Colombia, p<0.001 vs. Peru and Ecuador) with some individuals having close to 100% European ancestry (S3 Fig). Even so, there is a large range of ancestry proportions within individuals from Argentina, consistent with previous results based on a small number of ancestry informative markers and blood group antigens [17,27,28]. This variance is most likely a result of the contrasting histories of different Argentinean regions. For example, the original Spanish settlers of Argentina came through the Pacific/Andean region [21]. However, as Argentina developed, individuals from Spain and Southern Europe settled throughout the coastal regions on the Atlantic [23]. We also observed a small number of Argentinian individuals with relatively high amounts of African ancestry, whereas the rest of the individuals have a very low African ancestry component. This diversity is reflected in the large range in ancestry proportions seen within Argentina and is consistent with previous studies [17,28,29].\n\nAt higher order Ks (K = 13 in Fig 1), we observed significant substructure in both the Native American and European populations. The North-South gradient among European populations is strongly correlated with the latitude of each country’s capital (p < 2.2 X 10−16, linear regression), with a southern European component (light blue) most prominent in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. Most of the admixed Latino individuals in the sample have a high proportion of this southern European component, suggesting that the Europeans involved in admixture events in South America are from the Iberian Peninsula and Mediterranean Europe. This observation is consistent with historical migration patterns and maintained cultural influence [19]. On the other hand, the primary cluster of Native ancestry is reflective of the local indigenous diversity. We find that a component of the Native American ancestry in the Peruvian samples is shared with local Andean native groups, such as Quechua and Aymara, and that of Colombians is more closely shared with the Southern and Central Amerindian groups (Fig 1, K = 13). In contrast, we see that the Native American component in Argentina and Chile is shared between components from Central/Southern Native American and Andean Native American groups, showing a wider range of ancestral origins that we explore below in further analyses (Fig 1C, K = 13).\n\nSex biased ancestry is an important feature of many Latin American populations, and has been observed and described thoroughly in many previous research articles [6,18]. European migrants to the Americas were mainly male, especially during the earlier years of colonization. This has resulted in increased Amerindian ancestry on the X-chromosome when compared to the autosomes. After excluding admixed males from the analysis, we had admixed individuals from only four populations: Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Peru. We compared ADMIXTURE estimates at K = 3 of autosomal and X-chromosomal ancestry (S7 Fig). We find an increase in Native American ancestry on the X-chromosome compared to the autosomes (S8 Fig, Wilcoxon p < 0.001). This is suggestive of the fact that there was an overabundance of European males and Amerindian females that participated in the admixture process.\n\nSubcontinental ancestry components in South America\n\nTo identify the admixed individuals’ subcontinental lineages rooted within Europe and South America, we performed ancestry-specific PCA analysis. ASPCA is a technique developed to perform principal components analysis on the fraction of an individual’s ancestry from a specific continental origin. In contrast to PCA, which is performed on individual (unphased) diploid genotype calls, ASPCA is performed on phased haploid genomes conditional on ancestry calls (see Methods for details).\n\nTo explore their European origins, we combined our admixed individuals with the POPRES European data set [1] and performed ASPCA on the merged data set (Fig 2). Due to the limited overlap between the POPRES data set and our samples, we performed ASPCA on the Argentinian, Chilean, and Peruvian haplotypes separately from the Colombian and Ecuadorian haplotypes. The European reference samples cluster according to geography [30]. We find that the majority of the European haplotypes of the admixed samples cluster with Iberian and Southern Europeans, consistent with historical records and previous reports [6,31]. However, we observed interesting differences between countries in South America. For example, Argentina showed the highest number of European haplotypes that cluster in the Italian peninsula. This is consistent with recent migration events from Italy to Argentina in the late 19th and early 20th centuries [22]. Between 1880 and 1930, 2.3 million of the 4.7 million migrants to Argentina had Italian nationality [24]. We also find that Argentina has the largest range in the European ancestry components and even includes two haploid genomes that cluster near individuals from Germany, Poland, and Hungary in the top right of the ASPCA plot (Fig 2). No other South American population showed samples with such distant ancestry from the Iberian cluster, nor other Latino samples from previous studies in the Caribbean and Mexico [5,6].\n\n(a) European Ancestry Specific PCA of haploid genomes from Colombia and Ecuador with greater than 25% estimated European ancestry combined with 2,882 haploid genomes from the POPRES data set. Admixed Latino individuals are shown in shades of grey, while European individuals are colored according to region and represented as a two-character country code. (b) European Ancestry Specific PCA of haploid genomes from Peru, Chile, and Argentina with greater than 25% estimated European ancestry combined with the same reference European data set as in (a). The inset map shows the color-coded regions within Europe of the POPRES reference panel. To maximize SNP overlap between data sets, ASPCA analyses were performed separately for each subset of South American Latino populations (see Methods).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005602.g002\n\nTo further our investigation of the European component beyond the Spanish ancestry found in the Iberian Peninsula, we combined masked samples from the Canary Islands with South American individuals from Colombia and Ecuador. The Canary Islands were colonized by the Spanish in the early 15th century and became a stopping point for Spanish on their way to the Americas. Here, we find undifferentiated patterns of ancestry between the European component of these three populations (S9 Fig), suggesting that the European ancestry of these groups either originated from a similar source on the Iberian peninsula or that methods of increased resolution are needed to untangle more subtle differences.\n\nTo investigate the Native American component of the South American individuals’ ancestry, we combined our samples with those from 49 Native American populations previously genotyped [9]. We removed Native American samples that appeared as outliers in ASPCA space and that were geographically distant from South America (see Methods and S10 Fig). We also excluded Native American individuals with greater than 10% estimated European ancestry, as we found these individuals were biasing the principal components analysis towards a European/Native American axis (S11, S12 and S13 Figs). For visualization purposes, Native American populations were grouped corresponding to the labels used in Reich et al. [9] and are referenced geographically (see S1 Table for mapping).\n\nWe find that the Native American component of the South American haplotypes clusters along a gradient between the Andean Amerindian populations and the Southern Amerindian populations along ASPC1 and ASPC2 (Fig 3). Notably, the Native American ancestry in the admixed South American individuals is drastically different from the genetic components observed among Central and Northern Native American groups, such as Kaqchikel in Guatemala and Zapotec or Tepehuano in Mexico. None of these groups showed close affinities with Latino-derived South American haplotypes, supporting the notion of a highly substructured architecture of the Native American component among Latinos from different regions across Latin America.\n\nNative American Ancestry Specific PCA of all Latino haploid genomes with greater than 25% estimated Native American ancestry. Each masked haploid genome from admixed individuals is represented by a single point colored by population of origin. Native American haploid genomes are plotted as the first three letters of the population name and colored according to the regional groupings. The approximate sampling location for each of the Native American parental populations is shown on the map of Latin America.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005602.g003\n\nOur ASPCA analysis revealed that South American native haplotypes cluster primarily into two groups: one represented by central Andean individuals, such as Quechua and Aymara, and another group that includes most of the remaining native populations from South America. The differentiation between the Andean Amerindians and other South Amerindians is consistent with previous results using Y chromosome and mtDNA analyses [11,12], and suggests that the mountain range of the Andes acted as a major geographic barrier to gene flow during Native American evolution. This created further population structure among South Native American groups separating populations in the Amazon and east coastal regions from highland populations in the Andes. Interestingly, a number of the populations classified as Andean such as the Hulliche, Inga, and Yahgan clustered close to the Southern/Amazonian Native Americans and far from the other Andean Native Americans such as the Quechua and Aymara. Reich et al. in 2012 [9] suggested that, based on linguistic affinities, these populations would be expected to cluster with the Aymara and Quechua populations. Indeed, among the samples from the main Amazonian cluster in Fig 3, these are the only ones spreading towards the Quechua/Aymara cluster, supporting the idea of pre-Columbian admixture events giving rise to populations like the Inga, Huilliche, and Yahgan along the Andes. The separation between the Andean and other South American populations is consistent with the hypotheses of either multiple migration routes into South America, with an early split soon after crossing the Isthmus of Panama, or restricted levels of gene flow shortly after establishment of Native American settlements in the continent [8,11,12,32]. Likewise, the clustering of northern Argentinian Wichi and Paraguayan Guarani and Toba with lowland groups from Brazil and Colombia, suggests an Amazonian origin of Native American migration into the Gran Chaco and Pampas areas rather than strong evidence of a trans-Andean route. The branching pattern of these ancestral migrations have directly impacted the genetic profile of present day South American Latino populations, even between neighboring countries such as Argentina and Chile. We detail these patterns in what follows.\n\nThe clustering of the masked haploid genomes from the admixed individuals tended to be population specific (Fig 3). We find that the Peruvian individuals cluster more closely with the Andean Native American individuals than with any other Native American group, suggesting that the Native American component of the Peruvian population is mainly from the Andean region. While the Andean Native Americans and Peruvian individuals cluster closely, many of them do not overlap. Both the Quechua and Aymara individuals are from the Central Andes, while the admixed individuals are from Lima. Mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal studies of Andean ancestry have indicated that there is relatively low geographically-correlated genetic diversity in the Andean region, likely due to the historically higher gene flow and population size in the Andean region [11,12]. While there seems to be less geographic correlation in ancestry in the Andean Native Americans than in other Native American populations, some geographic stratification may be detected through high-density genotyping that was not detected using mitochondrial or Y-chromosomal analysis. In other populations with lower levels of genetic differentiation, such as Europeans, high density genotyping data revealed correlations between geography and ancestry [30]. Also, our reference panel has little representation from coastal Peruvian Native Americans, and these groups may also have contributed to the admixture process in cosmopolitan areas.\n\nArgentinian individuals show a broader range of indigenous ancestry: some cluster closer to the Southern/Amazonian Native Americans, while others cluster with the Latino Peruvians and the Andean group, reflecting a rich diversity of pre-Columbian roots in Argentina, whose geography spans the breadth of the continent from the Andes to the Atlantic, thus absorbing haplotypes from both major streams of Native American migration. We find only a marginal relationship between clustering and sampling location within Argentina. We find that sampling latitude is marginally associated with ASPC1 in a linear regression (p = 0.025, S14 Fig), and not significantly associated with ASPC2 (p = 0.3387, S15 Fig). We find no significant linear relationship between longitude and ASPCs (p = 0.322 vs. ASPC1 and p = 0.844 vs. ASPC2; S16 and S17 Figs). However, we do not expect the sampling locations in our current sample to be indicative of an individual’s history to this degree of resolution. Most individuals were sampled at hospitals in major cities throughout Argentina, with the largest number of individuals sampled in Buenos Aires. Because of recent major migrations of individuals, especially from rural to urban areas, current location may not be indicative of the location of an individual’s ancestors. There has also been recent intraregional migration throughout South America, especially in urban regions such as Buenos Aires [33,34]. This could be contributing to the genetic diversity we observe within the Argentinian individuals’ Native American ancestry. A sampling scheme based upon the “four grandparent” ancestry principle, such as the one used in the European POPRES [1] study, along with more representation for different regions throughout Argentina may better elucidate finer scale structure in the country, although this is also known to be imperfect [17].\n\nIn contrast, the Colombian and Ecuadorian Latino haplotypes tend to cluster with geographically nearby Southern Native Americans, such as the Wayuu, Piapoco, and Ticuna from Colombia. The Ecuadorian individuals cluster farther away from this ancestral group than the Colombians, which could be due to the lack of Ecuadorian Native American groups in the reference panel or be the result of admixture with Andean Native American lineages.\n\nThe Chilean individuals cluster towards the middle of the admixed group, between the Andean cluster and the Chilean Huilliche and Yaghan samples. The Native American reference panel used here does not include many Native Americans from Southern Chile. Only two haploid genomes from one Hulliche individual are in the subset of the reference panel used for analysis due to the high proportion of European ancestry in the remaining Hulliche individuals. The lack of representation of Hulliche and other Chilean Native Americans could explain why we do not see a strong differentiation of the admixed Chilean haploid genomes. A deeper sampling effort is needed to assess fine-scale genetic patterns within Chile. We find that the Native American ancestry of admixed Latinos is associated with population of origin (ANOVA p < 2 x 10−16 for both ASPC1 and ASPC2). This is consistent with many previous results in population history analysis, which have also shown strong correlation between geographic features and ancestry.\n\nTo further investigate the differences between the European and Native American ancestry components of South American individuals, we used GERMLINE [35] to identify genomic regions of identity by descent (IBD) in the admixed individuals and compared the patterns of IBD matching within and among populations to the local ancestry calls inferred throughout each IBD match. We find 12,348 segments of IBD shared within populations compared with only 4,941 segments of IBD shared between populations. On average, the individuals from Colombia share the most IBD within the population (15.2 cM), followed by Chile (3.42 cM), Ecuador (2.58 cM), Peru (2.06 cM), and Argentina (0.84 cM). We find that segments shared between populations are shorter than those shared within populations (Wilcox p < 2.2e-16). For IBD segments that could be identified using a haploid comparison, we calculated for each segment the proportion of European, Native American, and African local ancestry. We find that in both within and between populations, longer IBD segments have a higher proportion of European ancestry (linear regression, p = 4.04 x 10−16). The effect size based upon linear regression is greater in IBD segments shared between populations (β = 0.050 ± 0.0084 s.e., p = 3.7 x 10−9) than in IBD segments shared within populations (β = 0.0076 ± 0.0011 s.e., p = 4.4 x 10−11) (S18, S19 and S20 Figs). To test if a single admixed population primarily drove the observed effect, we also analyzed the shared IBD segments within each admixed South American population on its own. We observed a significant association in a linear regression model between IBD segment length and ancestry in the Peruvian and Argentinian populations (Peru p = 6.01 x 10−8, Argentina p = 0.0088, S21 Fig), a suggestive association in the Colombian populations (p = 0.0955, S21 Fig), and found no evidence for the association in Chilean or Ecuadorian populations (Chile p = 0.132, Ecuador p = 0.903, S21 Fig). However, the difference in significance may be a function of the differential power to detect this effect within populations due to sample sizes differences, since we have the lowest number of admixed individuals from Chile and Ecuador.\n\nWe also find that the majority of the long IBD segments (greater than 10 cM) shared between populations are of European ancestry (20 European vs. 2 Native American). IBD tracts shared between populations tend to consist of only a single continental ancestry, while those shared within populations often contain multiple ancestry switch points. These patterns are consistent with previous studies of IBD sharing in Latino populations [36] and suggest that the most recent common ancestors shared between Latino populations in South America are much more likely to be European than Native American, and that these trace back to a reduced source of founders. These results are also supported by the ASPCA analyses, where we find remarkable substructure among the different Native American components of each Latino population, but similar patterns of Southern European ancestry across Latino populations in ASPCA space.\n\nTo further confirm the results of the ASPCA analysis, we looked for diploid IBD matches between admixed and reference populations (S22 Fig and S23 Fig). We find that consistent with the ASPCA, the most IBD sharing with European populations occurs between admixed populations and Iberian populations. The Peruvian individuals also share a much higher amount of IBD with the Andean Native Americans such as the Quechua and Aymara, as suggested by the ASPCA plots.\n\nTaken together, the ASPCA and IBD results suggest that admixture between Europeans and Native Americans occurred in multiple locations throughout the colonization of the Americas and involved many different Native American populations. Individuals in our study were collected from major metropolitan regions in South American countries (Argentina, Peru, Chile, Colombia) or are recent US immigrants (Ecuador, Colombia). Our sample is thus an important reflection of the admixture patterns in cosmopolitan areas of these South American countries. While not fully representing the breadth of diversity across South America, the unique signatures of each of these populations gives deeper insight into regions that have historically been understudied. Important insights into population structure have been discovered using similar sampling schemes in previous work [6,18]. A more comprehensive sampling scheme throughout South American countries will help to reveal finer population structure patterns [17].\n\nMigration modeling from ancestry tracts\n\nAnalyzing the length of contiguous tracts of the same ancestry in an admixed population can help to determine the timing of admixture events and subsequent migrations. We used the program Tracts [37] to fit multiple models of admixture to the observed data. Tracts uses an optimization function to fit the ancestry tract length distribution under a given population history model to the observed tract length distribution. It also estimates the timing of major admixture and migration events within the model. Multiple models can be compared based upon their observed likelihoods given the data.\n\nTo infer the genetic migration history of South American Latinos, we compared three potential hypotheses (S24 Fig). First, we fit a model with a single admixture event between Europeans and Native Americans followed by a migration of Africans. We considered this model our base model, reflecting the initial colonial-era contact followed by slave importation. Next, we fit a second model with an additional European migration event. A third model consisted of the base model with an additional African migration event. We compared the fits of the models using the observed likelihoods. The tracts model makes an assumption about independence of the tract length distributions that may not necessarily be true and can cause likelihood based methods to falsely reject a model in favor of a model with more ancestry pulses [38]. In order to ensure we were correctly rejecting the single pulse model, we compared our observed changes in likelihood to the changes in likelihood seen in 1000 simulations of the single pulse model (see Methods). We find that for all of the admixed populations studied, the model with the extra pulse of European migration was preferred (P < 0.001 for Argentina and Colombia, P = 0.002 for Peru, P = 0.003 for Ecuador, and P = 0.027 for Chile, S28 Fig). The best fitting models for each population are shown in Fig 4. This result suggests a demographic history of continued European migration to Latin South America. This is in contrast to many countries within the Caribbean, where Tracts models estimated multiple pulses of African migration [6]. This contrast reflects historical differences in the slave trade among regions of the Americas and its differential impact in present day Latino populations. While African slavery was extensive throughout colonial Spanish America, it is estimated that only 12.9% of the total number of slaves disembarked in colonial Spanish America [39]. Of the estimated 1.5 million slaves imported into Spanish colonies, over 80% of them disembarked in Central America, Cuba, and Puerto Rico [39]. While Rio de la Plata was a major slave destination, only about 83,000 of the estimated 1.5 million slaves sent to Spanish Colonial America disembarked at this port [39]. While disembarkation location is not necessarily indicative of a slave’s final destination, it gives a broad picture of the regional differences in the slave trade. Some of the difference in ancestry proportions and demographic models between the Caribbean and South America could be related to these regional differences.\n\n(a) Bar graph comparing estimated migration times for the best-fitting model in each of the South American countries (blue) with previously published migration times for the Caribbean islands [6] and Mexico [40] (grey). The estimated second European migration time (in generations ago) is shown in dark blue for the models. (b-f) Best-fitting Tracts model for Colombia (b) Ecuador (c), Peru (d), Chile (e), and Argentina (f). These models have an initial admixture event between Native American and European populations followed by a pulse of African migration, subsequently followed by an additional European migration event. The ancestry tract decay (top) compares the expected and observed tract length distributions based upon the best-fit model, with the shaded area indicating the 68.7% confidence interval. The points indicate the observed values. The migration model (bottom of each graph) shows the change in admixture proportion over time. From left to right along the time scale in generations ago (GA), the circles on top indicate the occurrence of admixture events, with the size of the circle corresponding to the magnitude of incoming migrants from each of the ancestral populations.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005602.g004\n\nA unique feature of South American migration history is the timing of European contact in colonial times. According to the best-fitting Tracts models, we can infer a rough estimate of the number of generations that have passed since the initial admixture and the subsequent migrations in each South American population. The estimates of these parameters are shown in S3 Table and in Fig 4 we have plotted the tract length distributions of the most likely models (as determined by the simulated likelihood comparison) for each South American population. The maximum-likelihood time of initial admixture between Native Americans and Europeans ranges from 9 to 14 generations ago among the studied populations, representing the youngest estimate in mainland Latin America. Previous studies of mestizo populations throughout South America have shown estimates of mean time to admixture between 6 and 14 generations [13,16], a range that our models agree with. The models return the maximum likelihood estimate for the time of onset of admixture in the entire population (once additional pulses have been taken into account). This, however, does not necessarily equate to an estimate for the earliest possible time that admixture may have taken place. The discrepancy between the recorded initial time of colonization and the onset of admixture described in our and previous work is likely due to many factors, including the fact that the admixture process occurred over time in the colonies and that further immigration occurred throughout the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries [22].\n\nOur models argue for a more recent European migration into South America compared to that in the Caribbean and Mexico [6,40], consistent with the colonial history in the region. Strong pulses of European migration occurred between 3 and 9 generations ago in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and Argentina (Fig 4A). This more recent European migration into southern South American countries is consistent with historical records of European migration from Iberia and Southern Europe throughout the 19th and 20th centuries [22]. For example, it is estimated that over 4.7 million individuals immigrated into Argentina between 1880 and 1930 [24], and that the majority of these immigrants were of European origin. Our models suggest a strong pulse of European immigration between 3 and 4 generations ago in Argentina, which is consistent with the recorded history.\n\nThe Tracts model for Argentina (Fig 4), however, is not able to properly fit the tail of the distribution, where longer Native American tracts were observed. This is likely due to the high variance in ancestry proportions in Argentina. Because of this, the admixture time estimates for individuals in Argentina may be strongly dependent upon subpopulation. This result argues for the need to study these populations at an even finer scale to help discriminate the complex local patterns of ancestry.\n\nAncestry-specific PCA analysis\n\nWe used the program PCAmask to perform ancestry specific PCA analysis (ASPCA) [6]. The input to the program consists of admixed individuals with local ancestry calls and a subcontinental reference panel of the ancestry under investigation. PCAmask masks the loci in the haplotypes of the admixed individuals that have local ancestry that does not correspond to the given continental population. Because of the high amount of missing data this masking generates, PCAmask uses a modified version of subspace PCA [49] to implement an ancestry specific PCA. The analysis combines both the admixed individuals and the subcontinental ancestral population into the same PCA space for analysis.\n\nTo run ASPCA on the European component of the admixed individuals ancestry, we combined our admixed individuals with the POPRES European data set [1]. Because both of our Latino data sets were genotyped using different Illumina SNP arrays, and the POPRES European reference panel [1] was genotyped in a different platform (Affymetrix 500K), the intersection of all three data sets would lead to a substantially reduced marker overlap. Therefore, we performed the ASPCA analysis of the European component separately for the individuals from Ecuador and Colombia (genotyped on Illumina 650K arrays) and the individuals from Peru, Chile, and Argentina (genotyped on Illumina OMNI1 arrays). The intersection of the POPRES samples and the Colombians and Ecuadorians contained 21,570 SNP markers while the intersection of POPRES and the Argentinian, Peruvian, and Chilean samples contained 35,070 SNPs. The intersection of the three data sets contained too few SNPs for analysis. To further assess the European ancestry of the Colombians and Ecuadorians, we combined these individuals with previously published genotype data from Canary Islanders [50]. We used SHAPEIT and RFMix as above to mask the Canary Islanders using a European and a North African reference panel [51]. We performed ASPCA analysis with the POPRES individuals, Canary Islanders, Colombians, and Ecuadorians. We masked all non-European regions of the genomes of the Canary Islanders, Colombians and Ecuadorians.\n\nFor the ASPCA analysis of the Native American component, we used a combined data set including the admixed Latino individuals from all 5 South American countries investigated and the unmasked Native American reference panel from Reich et al. [9]. We excluded admixed individuals with less than 25% Native American ancestry inferred through local ancestry inference. In addition to masking regions of the admixed genomes that corresponded to non-Native American ancestry, we also masked loci where RFMix reported a less than 95% posterior probability of the inferred ancestry. After these filters, we considered 182 Argentinian, 236 Peruvian, 51 Chilean, 114 Colombian, and 38 Ecuadorian haploid genomes for analysis. The final intersection of these data sets contained 142,161 polymorphic sites. The first comparison with the Native American reference panel identified many of the extremely homogenous Native American groups as outliers (S7 Fig). This included the Brazilian Surui and the Costa Rican Cabecar individuals, among other populations. We also removed North American, Na-Dene and Aleut groups from downstream analyses, as they are geographically distant from South America and further analyses indicate these individuals were unlikely to be involved in South American Latino admixture. After excluding these individuals, we re-ran ASPCA and found that there was a strong gradient of dispersion within the Native American reference panel (S8 Fig). This gradient correlated strongly with ADMIXTURE estimated European ancestry components in linear regression (p < 2 x 10−16 for ASPC1 and ASPC2, S9 Fig and S10 Fig). We hypothesize, therefore, that this gradient is an artifact of recent European admixture in Native American populations. We therefore excluded any individuals from the Native American reference panel with greater than 10% European ancestry. After this filter, we re-ran ASPCA. This data set included 108 Andean, 132 Central Native American, 118 Northern Native American, 122 Southern Native American haplotypes. A table of the specific numbers of haplotypes from each Native American population is provided in the Supplement (S2 Table). ASPCA was performed with this reduced Native American reference panel of 480 haploid genomes in combination with the 182 Argentinian, 236 Peruvian, 51 Chilean, 114 Colombian, and 38 Ecuadorian masked haploid genomes.\n\nTo further investigate the relationships between admixed individuals throughout South America, we performed an identity by descent analysis using the program GERMLINE [35]. For the IBD analyses, we used the default settings of GERMLINE, with settings of bits = 128 and allowing a maximum of two homozygous marker mismatches per IBD slice (-err_hom) and a maximum of 0 heterozygous marker mismatches per IBD slice (-err_het). For IBD analyses involving combining the IBD tract information with local ancestry assignments, we used the haploid mode of GERMLINE to look for IBD matches between individual haplotypes inferred through Shapeit and RFMix. The haploid mode of GERMLINE is more conservative than the diploid mode, as a phasing switch error will interrupt an IBD match. The minimum length for IBD segment detection was 3 cM. For IBD within admixed individuals, we used the rephased alleles output from RFMix. We then compared the locations of IBD matches to the inferred local ancestry calls throughout each IBD tract. To better understand the IBD relationships between admixed populations and subcontinental reference populations, we compared estimated IBD tract lengths between our admixed individuals, the Native American ASPCA subset of the Reich et. al. data set, and the European 1000 Genomes populations. The European 1000 Genomes individuals were used in place of the POPRES data set for IBD detection due to the low marker overlap with the POPRES individuals. We calculated the sum of the total length of IBD sharing between the admixed populations and reference populations. This value was normalized by the product of the numbers of individuals in each respective admixed and reference population. Standard error was calculated using chromosome weighted jackknife sampling [52]."
