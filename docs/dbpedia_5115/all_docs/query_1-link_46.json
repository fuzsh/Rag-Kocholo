        "text": "Colombia has a large variety of scenic destinations, landscapes, cultures, and delicious gastronomy. It’s among top travel destinations in Latin America and has several wonders to discover.\n\nA trip to this beautiful country is an excellent way to practice your language skills in the field and test your Spanish fluency with native speakers.\n\nGrab a map, pack your bags, and join me in exploring Colombia’s history, cultural insights, and best places to visit!\n\nA Brief History of Colombia\n\nPrehispanic Colombia began in the 5th century B.C. as the first settlers populated the region. Relatively small tribes showed marvelous advances in agriculture, livestock, hunting, and fishing.\n\nThe Spanish conquest of Colombia and colonization took its toll on the country’s indigenous population and gave room to conflict and a battle for the country’s resources.\n\nColombia gained its independence from Spain on July 20th 1810 in the city known as Santa Fé Bogotá.\n\nSince then, Colombia has faced social and political conflicts that continue to shape the country. Up until the 19th century the country was under political federalism and centralism. Civil wars fueled armed confrontations and triggered a slow economic growth.\n\nThe 20th century was more prosperous for Colombia and brought economic and social reforms. The need to modernize public policies and superior education sparked an unprecedented event known as “El Bogotazo”.\n\nEl Bogotazo was a revolt that set the city on fire for three days due to the assasination of one of the country’s most important leaders; President Jorge Eliécer Gaitán. It took place on April 9th, 1948 and marked a turn of events for Colombia.\n\nColombia’s following history was heavily marked by corruption, drug trafficking, guerrillas, paramilitary groups, and violence. Luckily, the turn of the century, brought Colombians a highly different context to what they were used to.\n\nIn September 2016 a peace and ceasefire agreement was signed with the FARC guerrillas, although the war didn’t end immediately, this remarkable event was a pivotal moment for Colombia’s future.\n\nColombia’s economy is finally taking off and is recognized for being a country with art, culture, remarkable gastronomy, music, excellent coffee, and new technologies. The resilience Colombians have is worth applauding and the appeal it has continues to attract travelers and expats from all over the world.\n\nCultural Features of Colombia\n\nColombia is a rich and diverse country that’s home to 50.3 million people. Its ethnic variety stands out for being a melting pot of more than 80 indigenous cultures, afro-latino population, and other groups that identify as mestizos (mixed).\n\nThe country’s official language is Spanish and there’s approximately 65 different indigenous dialects.\n\nLearn more: Colombian Slang: Talk Like a Native\n\nColombia’s Festivities\n\nThe major religion in Colombia is Catholicism, meaning that most of the national holidays and festivals have religious purposes. There’s also non-religious festivities that stand out and make Colombia a country full of celebrations where music, passion, dance, and joy collide.\n\nSome of the country’s major festivities are:\n\nSemana santa (Holy week)\n\nColombia’s independence day\n\nCarnaval de negros y blancos (Black and White Carnival)\n\nCarnival of Barranquilla\n\nFeria de Manizales (Manizales fair)\n\nFeria de Cali (Cali fair)\n\nFiesta de la Candelaria (Candelaria festival)\n\nCarnival of fire\n\nInternational film festival of Cartagena\n\nNational film festival of Colombian music\n\nMusic and Arts\n\nThe arts are a trademark of Colombia and local musical genres like cumbia and vallenato are appreciated all over the world. The country is home to recognized musicians, writers, and artists who broke barriers and acquired international fame.\n\nA few emblematic figures of Colombia’s modern culture are:\n\nAward winning author and Nobel Laureate Gabriel García Marquez\n\nContemporary artist Fernando Botero\n\nPop singer Shakira\n\nGrammy winning rock band Aterciopelados\n\nAlternative band Bomba Estereo\n\nSinger J Balvin\n\nColombian Gastronomy\n\nColombian cuisine is a fusion of different cultures, traditions, and flavors. The use of regional and local ingredients vary depending on the area of the country you visit. Some of the best Colombian food comes from street food vendors and mom and pop kitchens.\n\nAlthough there are dozens of delicious dishes, I chose only a few representative flavorful representatives. Let’s take a look:\n\nBandeja paisa\n\nRecognized as the national dish of Colombia, la bandeja paisa is made of red beans, white rice, chicharrón, chorizo, fried egg, plantain, avocado, and arepa.\n\nArepas\n\nOne of the most popular meals. Arepas are a pastry made from cornmeal topped with your choice of meats, cheese, or fruits.\n\nSancocho\n\nA chicken soup with corn on the cob, yucca, and plantains.\n\nAjiaco\n\nA heartening soup with corn, chicken, different types of potatoes, and local herbs.\n\nAborrajados\n\nA dish made of slices of plantain stuffed with your choice of cheese.\n\nTorta negra\n\nA delicious black cake made of rich chocolate,dried papaya, chocolate chunks, and different types of frosting.\n\nMake time to try each and every one of these Colombian delicacies in your trip to this magnificent country.\n\nTraveling to Colombia\n\nA trip to Colombia is worth your time and investment due to the variety of beaches, landscapes, climate, and culture. There’s much to see and taking the time to fully immerse yourself in the country guarantees different activities and beautiful destinations.\n\nThe country is large but it’s easily connected with frequent international flights to Cartagena, Bogotá, Medellín, and Cali. Entering the country by land is also a possibility if you wish to connect with a trip to Panama, Ecuador, or Venezuela.\n\nNot many countries require a visa for visiting Colombia, nevertheless, you can always check the visa requirements for your nationality as you prepare for your trip.\n\nWhat to Do in Colombia\n\nVisit the major touristic places in Colombia and enjoy the diversity of landscapes, culture, and sightseeing every region has to offer during your trip.\n\nColombia has 32 departments and five main regions:\n\nRegión Caribe (the Caribbean coast)\n\nRegión del Pacifico (the Pacific coast)\n\nRegión de la Orinoquía (Orinoco river basin)\n\nRegión de la Amazonía (Amazon rainforest)\n\nZona Andina (the Andes)\n\nRegión Insular (islands)\n\nTravel Destinations in Colombia\n\n1. Bogotá\n\nColombia’s capital is a city that never sleeps and has dozens of things to offer travelers. The city center, museums, and squares are home to an infinity of restaurants, hotels, and urban art spots.\n\n2. Cartagena de Indias\n\nEl puerto de Cartagena (port of Cartagena) is one of the most important in Latin America. This colonial site is surrounded by a wall built to protect the city from pirates and buccaneers. The colorful streets are picturesque and ideal for snapping photos. The delicious warm weather, go-slow vibe, and lovely beaches make Cartagena worth the visit.\n\n3. Tayrona National Park\n\nEl parque nacional natural Tayrona is one of the most sought-out travel destinations in the country. It’s home to a large and diverse ecosystem with abundant biodiversity. It’s a perfect spot for ecotourism enthusiasts and for those who love nature surroundings.\n\n4. Medellín\n\nThe city of Medellin is home to modern museums, plazas (squares), parks, and industries. The city is known as “la ciudad de la eterna primavera” (the city of eternal spring) due to the pleasant weather all year long.\n\n5. La Guajira\n\nLa Guajira is one of Colombia’s furthest regions in the Caribbean. It’s home to the fascinating indigenous Wayuu, uncharted beaches, national parks, and magical sceneries. La Guajira is ideal for cultural immersion and for experiencing Colombia’s traditions.\n\nIs Colombia Safe?\n\nColombia definitely has a bad reputation due to its violent history and past. Nevertheless, the country works hard in ensuring safe travels for tourists. The unfair image Colombia has is far from reality.\n\nVisiting Colombia requires you to use your common sense and follow your instincts. Like in any other Latin American country, there are areas that are not advised for travelers to visit. The best thing you can do is plan ahead, do your research, and prepare accordingly.\n\nColombia’s current covid restrictions allow travelers to enter the country as long as they present a valid negative PCR test upon arrival. They’re also welcoming vaccinated tourists since June 2021. There are a few mobility restrictions that continue to change as the pandemic unfolds.\n\nI recommend you review the safety measures, follow tourism protocols, and prioritize outdoor activities if you’re planning a trip soon.\n\n¡Vamos a Colombia!\n\nLet’s go to Colombia!\n\nA visit to Colombia is a fantastic opportunity for you to improve your Spanish abilities. The warm welcoming nature of Colombians offers multiple engagement opportunities in majestic tourist spots.\n\nGuarantee your trip will be smooth sailing by elevating your Spanish skills in a free class with native speakers.\n\nBeing able to communicate in Spanish enables you to move around easily in a foreign country. What’s more, you learn how to use transportation, order at restaurants, shop for souvenirs, and connect with the locals through meaningful conversations.\n\nAllow yourself to experience Colombia and fully grasp the richness of the country during a Spanish immersion trip.\n\nWant to learn more about Latin American culture?
