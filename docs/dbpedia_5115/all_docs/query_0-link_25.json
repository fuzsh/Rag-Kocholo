        "text": "Enrique Iglesias lands his seventh No. 1 on Tropical Songs, as his summertime hit “Bailando” featuring Descemer Bueno and Gente de Zona steps 2-1 on the Nielsen BDS-based airplay chart. The song is up by 2 percent in plays at the format in the week ending June 22.\n\nEnrique Iglesias’ ‘Bailando’ Picked as New Telemundo Soap Theme\n\nIglesias has inhabited the No. 1 spot on Hot Latin Songs with the track for eight consecutive weeks; on the Billboard Hot 100, it hops to a new peak (40-35). The title was recently released in an English version as well. In all, it sold 31,000 downloads in the week ending June 22 (up 20 percent), with the Spanish version contributing 40 percent of its sales, according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nMeanwhile, Carlos Vives soars 17-4 on Tropical Songs with “Cuando Nos Volvamos a Encontrar” featuring Marc Anthony — Vives’ 13th top 10. He first reached the tier in 1995 with his charting debut, “La Tierra Del Olvido,” which rose to No. 8. The new song’s climb extends Anthony’s tally of top 10s to 40, boosting his claim for second-most top 10s in the chart’s history after Victor Manuelle’s 45.\n\nLatin Pop Isn’t Popping: Why Stars Like Carlos Vives and Luis Fonsi Are Facing a ‘New Cultural Reality’\n\nAlso attaining his 13th top 10 on Tropical Songs, Prince Royce’s “Soy El Mismo” shoots 13-5. The third single and title track off the bachata singer’s 2013 set Soy El Mismo climbs by 23 percent in plays, with WYUU Tampa, Fla., leading in spins (86) between June 16-22. As “Mismo” rises 32-31 on Hot Latin Songs, he also holds the No. 8 with “Darte Un Beso” and No. 23 with “Te Robare.”\n\nSpanish pop singer Natalia Jimenez claims Hot Shot Debut honors as “Creo En Mi” comes in at No. 37 on Hot Latin Songs. The song rises 63 percent at radio, to 3.4 million audience impressions, and lands as she jumps 40-22 on Latin Pop Airplay. Jimenez, who recently concluded her stint as a coach on Telemundo’s second season of “La Voz Kids,” holds one No. 1 on Hot Latin Songs as a featured act on Ricky Martin’s “Lo Mejor De Mi Vida Eres Tu” (two weeks, 2011). As the lead singer of pop group La Quinta Estacion, she reached the top 10 four times, between 2005-2009."
