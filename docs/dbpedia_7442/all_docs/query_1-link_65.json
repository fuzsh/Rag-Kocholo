        "text": "This study focuses on how regional military competition is affected by the political upheavals in the Middle East, economic and demographic pressures, sectarian struggles and extremism, ethnic and tribal conflicts, and how these tensions all combine to produce new complex patterns of competition. The civil war in Syria in particular has complicated relative stable long-term trends in both regional conventional and asymmetric forces. The conflict also challenges both the US and Iran to find new ways to compete in spite of regional unrest, albeit with the risk of further deepening both regional instability and the overall level of strategic competition.\n\nThe Conventional Military Balance Long term patterns of regional expenditures, weapons deliveries and recapitalization initiatives play a key role in forming the conventional balance. The conventional balance is time and resource intensive, and this means that nations can only make critical changes in the strengths and weaknesses of their forces over time and through careful planning, adequate resources, and well-managed force development. As the following analysis shows, this has given Israel a major advantage. It is has had the combination of national expenditures, massive external funding, national industrial capacity and effective strategy and force planning that has enabled it to attain and sustain a clear ―edge‖ in the regional conventional balance in spite of its size and limited manpower. There are significant uncertainties in the force counts of Arab and Israeli forces availablefrom unclassified sources. Any assessment of the Israel-Syrian military balance in particular must also address the fact that strength measured in force numbers can be very different from strength measured in terms of force quality. Force size has only limited meaning as a measure of military capability or merit, unless it can be related to force quality. Leadership, the ability to conduct joint and combined operations, morale, and the ability to sustain complex cycles of rapid maneuver warfare are just a few of the aspects of force quality that can overcome superiority in force quantity. It is possible to quantify some key measures of this balance, but such analysis has to be carefully structured to be more revealing than misleading, and constantly kept in context. This is illustrated by some of the key numbers in the balance between Israeli and Syrian forces – the forces most likely to shape the key conventional war fighting options in the region.\n\nIranian Weapons of Mass Destruction: Capabilities, Developments and Strategic Uncertainties by Anthony H. Cordesman and Adam C. Seitz October 14, 2008 The Burke Chair has prepared a new set of briefs, prepared by Anthony H. Cordesman and Adam C. Seitz, which summarize Iran’s actions, current and potential capabilities, and the possible outcome of a nuclear exchange. This briefing draws on official statements, US intelligence judgments, work by the IAEA, and material provided by a number of other research centers, including the Nuclear Threat Initiative, ISIS, the Federation of American Scientists, Global Security, and the Brooking Institution among others. The Burke Chair is releasing these documents in a series of working drafts in an effort to obtain outside views, comments, criticisms, and additions. We hope to use such comments to provide a more comprehensive and more accurate picture of Iran’s controversial and destabilizing WMD programs despite the uncertainty surrounding these foreign policy nightmares. This first working draft in the series is available on the CSIS web site at: http://www.csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/081015_iran.wmd.pdf It covers the capabilities and uncertainties of Iran’s missile program, as well as other possible means of deliver that Iran could utilize in conjunction with its CBRN programs."
