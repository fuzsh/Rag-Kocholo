        "text": "Global search is on for a solid fuel for the area weapon Multi Barrel Rocket Launcher (MBRL). Solid fuel is the first choice due to ease of design, manufacturing, handling, packaging, transportability and deployability. It also has the capability of prolonged storage without noticeable degradation of its quality. It is also quite safe and does not pose safety hazards. Also with solid propellant end use by the troops is comparatively simple as only trigger operation is needed. Tactically it suits the requirement of very fast response time and generates high thrust for small duration. Solid fuel, better known as solid propellant is classified as single base and double base propellant. Single base propellant contains nitrocellulose (NC) where as double base contains homogeneous mixture of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine (NG) with small amount of additives. There is a third category of solid propellant known as composite propellant. Double base propellant used to be preferred in tactical missiles and rockets. However, with the advent of the third category, it is now most preferred. In this category additives are added to meet the requirement of manufacturing, operational requirements and to improve physical properties. It contains heterogeneous mixture of solid fuel and oxidizer held together in a matrix like binder. Polybutadiene is the most effective binder which improves the physical properties. In this mixture when solid ammonium perchlorate (AP) and aluminum (Al) are added the density of the mixture is increased resulting in improvement of specific impulse. Presently composite propellant is cast from a mixture of AP crystals, Al powder and liquid HTBP (Hydroxyl terminated Polybutadiene). It is called CMDB (Composite Modified Double Base) propellant. Pressure time curve for burning of CMDB propellant obtained during static trial in Ballistic Evaluation Motor establishes that propellant grain with star shape internal and cylindrical outer cross section maintains constant pressure over the entire burning time. This is because such cross section provides constant (neutral) burning and leaves negligible sliver at the end. This paper brings out recent advances in solid fuel and analyses suitability of CMDB propellant to fulfill the requirement for use in MBRL. From the analysis of Pressure-Time plot of the subject propellant it is found to be most suitable as solid rocket propellant for MBRL.\n\nThis paper present the effect of propellant formulations on propellant properties is very crucial to the quality of propellant used in rocket motor. As poor propellant formulation usually leads to unstable combustion and this can lead to a total destruction of the entire structure of the solid rocket motor. For this research work, the centre compositions selected were based on calculation for percentage mass composition from the stoichiometric equation for the combustion process. Hollow bates grains used for the design consist of a mass of propellant of 6 kg, core diameter of 0.050m, throat diameter of 0.036m, grains length of 0.507m, 3 bates and grains diameter of 0.105m. Five samples of different formulations were experimented and as sorbitol increased, propellant properties such as specific impulse, temperature, density and thrust decreased but as potassium nitrate increased these properties increased as well. The increase in propellant properties as potassium nitrate increases indicated the oxidizing properties of potassium nitrate and decrease in propellant properties as sorbitol increases indicated their fuel properties. The specific impulse of 92.68 s and thrust of 1025.27 N of a formulation was the highest of all the propellant formulations considered for the test. This observation revealed that this formulation that produced highest specific impulse and thrust is the best out of all the formulations generated in the design. Propellants are stored matter which when ejected produces a thrust force. Their major applications are in launching projectiles from guns, rockets, and missile systems (Jacqueline, 1998). All propellants are made up of two parts: Oxidizer and Fuel (or reducer). An oxidizer is a component that produces oxygen for reaction with the fuel. Fuel reacts with the oxygen to produces gas for propulsion. The fuel used in space vehicles is very much different from the normal fuel in respect to the following properties, (MFC Propulsion, 2013). Depending on the physical state of fuel and oxidiser, propellants are classified as: Solid propellants, Liquid propellants, Hybrid propellants. (Space Travel Guide, 2014).Different propellants have significant effect on burning rate on various operating conditions as well as formulation (Nnali-Uroh et al, 2016) In a solid propellant rocket motor, the fuel and oxidizer are stored or placed in the same container. Both are shock sensitive and once fired, there is, in principle, no means of controlling the thrust rate. These problems are overcome using liquid bipropellant motors instead. This requires separate storing for the fuel and oxidizer which results in a complex and more expensive system. The solid rocket motor is the simplest system when compared with other rocket systems (Conny, 2005).In this study, sorbitol based solid propellant is considered, which is a double based solid propellant where fuel and oxidizer are sorbitol and potassium nitrate respectively. Solid propellants are the most commonly used propellant in rocket motors, it is relatively simple to design, highly reliable and easy to manufacture at low cost (Yildirm, 2007).Over the year, there were concerted efforts from different researcher to optimize solid propellant formulation but various combinations of chemical ingredients at different formulations result in diverse physical and chemical properties, as well as combustion characteristics and performance (Yildirim, 2007). The ballistic parameters considered are temperature, propellant density, specific impulse and thrust. The design was based on the fact that specific impulse, temperature, density and thrust of the product are functionally related to specific propellant formulation and attempts were made to fit multiple regression equations describing responses to optimal formulation."
