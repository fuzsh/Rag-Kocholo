Since its founding, the city has been a hotly disputed area, with competing political and ethnic groupings striving for power.\n\nWith several armed organizations and militias present, Jalalabad has seen substantial political turmoil in recent years. These organizations have contributed to the cityâ€™s atmosphere of instability and insecurity by engaging in a variety of activities, such as extortion, violence, and drug trafficking.\n\nJalalabad has also seen significant political advancements recently, such as the creation of a number of neighborhood councils and committees that support community involvement and growth. These groups have played a crucial role in helping the local community by offering services and assistance as well as supporting democratic institutions and local government.\n\nOverall, a number of local, regional, and national issues influence the political climate in Jalalabad, which continues to be complicated and unstable. Despite these obstacles, there are several people and groups working in the city to advance democracy, peace, and stability in order to provide the residents of Jalalabad a better future."
