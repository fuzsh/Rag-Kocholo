        "text": "Darunta Dam was constructed by Soviet Union (USSR) companies in the early 1960’s and contains three vertical Kaplan (6 blade propeller) units with rated output of 3.85 MW each. Originally, the dam supplied 40 to 45 megawatts of electrical power but silting and damage to the system during the Afghan civil war was has reduced its actual output to 11.5 megawatts. The plant is currently in very poor condition and requires major rehabilitation including possible replacement of all three turbines."
