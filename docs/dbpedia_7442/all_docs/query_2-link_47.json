In Islam, a tourist or a traveler is called a musafir. Such person is generally treated as a diplomat and well protected under Afghan culture. Every mosque is a place of ultimate protection against those wanting to cause harm. Although Afghans are generally very friendly to tourists or travelers, kidnapping for ransom still exists in the county.[33][34] Several foreign tourists have been kidnapped and killed in Afghanistan in the past.[35] Finding an honest and reliable tour guide is the key to safety in Afghanistan.\n\nIn June 2022, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said that \"anyone\" can visit Afghanistan for tourism,[36] and the Ministry of Information and Culture started promoting it while claiming that Afghanistan is now safe.[37] This, however, does not mean that unexploded ordnances or land mines no longer exist because they likely still do.[38][39][40]\n\nStamps\n\n[edit]\n\nBelow is a series of old post stamps of Afghanistan from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s that promote tourism in the country.\n\nBagh-e Bala Palace and the Mausoleum of Abdur Rahman Khan, both in Kabul\n\nBadakhshan region and the Pamir Mountains\n\nTriumphal arch of Paghman\n\nBamiyan themed postage stamp (1951) issued by Postes Afghanes (Afghan Post)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nEconomy of Afghanistan\n\nGeography of Afghanistan\n\nVisa policy of Afghanistan\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
