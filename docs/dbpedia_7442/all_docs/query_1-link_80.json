The field of terrorism is no different. It is a specialized subject that requires serious study, and requires that those in the front line of defense be as knowledgeable as possible. Today’s police officers, security managers, and customs officers have received most of their terrorism education in short briefings, or simply via magazines or television. In the coming years, security professionals may receive more specialized training and education on terrorism—or they may not. This book is intended as a resource for those who realize that they need to begin their own terrorism education today. The most difficult and critical component of terrorism education is learning how to recognize and predict an attack. Those responsible for homeland security need to be well versed in terrorist attack preincident indicators (TAPIs). TAPIs are behaviors; they are actions terrorists must take before they can carry out an attack. In the law enforcement and intelligence communities, some TAPIs may be referred to as behavioral science or “profiling.” For example, Secret Service teams are trained to watch individuals’ behaviors—as well as their race, age, sex, or appearance, which are secondary indicators. The Israeli airline El Al has used this behavior-recognition approach for decades and is generally successful at stopping potential terrorists from skyjacking its airliners. Until recently the United States has had a much less diligent attitude toward security—and terrorism in particular—than many other countries in the world, but we have since learned. Why even more diligence? First, America is a huge nation with a higher level of domestic freedom than domestic security; and second, the United States is a declared target of future terrorist attacks. The devastation caused on 9/11 may, tragically, only inspire others to continue the trend. All members of the anti- and counter-terrorism community need to seek answers to these questions:\n\n1\n\n4\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\n• Who represents a threat? • What options do those people have for carrying out harm? • How might they carry out an attack? • Most importantly, what behaviors can be observed when they are preparing or ready to act? These questions will eventually lead to observable behaviors and actions of terrorists and their supporters. For example, if terrorists want to disperse a chemical weapon, they must first acquire and move the chemicals, locate and stock a safe location, select a target and observe it, deploy a delivery team and support them, create a dispersal system and move it to the target. All of these actions are detectable to the trained observer. Before we can detect terrorist activity, however, we must first change our perceptions about who terrorists might be. Adopt an Intelligence-Based Approach to Antiterrorism Understanding and countering terrorism requires adjustment in perspective. Security professionals need to respect and understand terrorists, recognize the pre-incident indicators of terrorist activities, and competently analyze intelligence information. 1. One must learn to respect the terrorist’s capabilities: You don’t have to agree with terrorists in order to recognize their abilities and understand them. Terrorism as a political tool may be abhorrent; however, you need to identify and recognize the grievances of a particular terrorist group and—for lack of a better word—respect the intelligence and tenacity they use to perform terrible deeds. Why were they motivated to take up their cause? How effective are their tactics? If you disregard a demonstrated capability, or dismiss their ability to analyze weak spots and work around them, because you think terrorists are inferior, you may create a blind spot in your security. To get an edge on terrorists, you must learn to see the world from behind their mask. 2. Observe street-level behaviors: Learn the terrorist attack pre-incident indicators of a\n\nYOUR MISSION: CRITICAL AWARENESS 5\n\nterrorist operation in the works. No matter how clever terrorists may be, they’re not ghosts. Terrorists and their support personnel must perform certain behaviors in order to carry out their plans. They have specific roles and duties, many of which are observable to the trained eye. 3. Analyze source information: Basic analysis must be applied to any data or evidence collected by integrating intelligence assets, using computerized analytical programs, or just asking the right questions. Clearly, as we learned in the September 11 attacks, without cross checking the data and applying common sense the analytical process breaks down. Field officers must make every effort to match the observed or suspected criminal behaviors with terrorist intelligence. Analysis does not have to be a long, drawnout process. Even the simplest key-word associations comparing known intelligence to known capability can find potential TAPIs. Prior to September 11, the words Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda and pilot training in the same sentence should have spelled out suicide skyjacking to most people who worked the al-Qaeda mission. All of these words were found in one FBI agent’s report prior to the attack. Al-Qaeda’s global capabilities, matched with Bin Laden’s personal animosity toward America and a previous skyjacking for this purpose by a group associated with al-Qaeda (the skyjacking of an Air France airliner by the Algerian GIA in 1994), should have made even the coolest intelligence analyst spill his coffee and issue a dire warning. Several did just that. These key steps—respect, observe, and analyze— represent an intelligencebased approach to predictStereotype-based views ing terrorist actions. With a ism don’t help us fight few exceptions, the intellibut blind us to it. gence-based approach is surprisingly new to many law enforcement agencies; stereotypes and heavy reliance on technology still dominate our security perspective to a great degree.\n\nof terrorthe threat\n\n6\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\nAvoid a Stereotype-Based Approach to Antiterrorism Why do we stereotype terrorists? Let’s look at a basic fact: America is new to terrorism. We have a hard time understanding who would carry out such acts, and so to answer our own questions, we create stereotypes of “the terrorist” in the absence of facts. Some people see terrorists as incompetent cowards who can’t stand up to us; others consider them brilliant but suicidal bogeymen who can’t be stopped. Until September 11, the predominant image of a terrorist in many people’s minds was a cartoon character carryTerrorism against America can only ing a big bomb with a lit be defeated through careful intelli- fuse.\n\ngence collection, surveillance, and cooperative efforts among law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\n\nIn educating members of the armed forces and law enforcement, I often hear terrorists referred to as “crazy ragheads” or “camel jockeys.” One senior member of the U.S. House of Representatives, in an oblique reference to al-Qaeda, recommended arresting anyone with “diapers on their heads.” These attitudes may have contributed to our intelligence community’s focus on finding the stereotypical terrorist while the atypical ones operated with complete impunity within our borders. But there is another damaging stereotype at work: that of the current counterterrorism effort. Some inflamed political rhetoric has created an inaccurate stereotype of how fast and effective the “war on terrorism” has been. Americans now believe that we can stop terrorism by sending out our military forces to get them, “dead or alive.” That may be true to some extent, but not entirely. Terrorism cannot be defeated in a grand war. Trying to preemptively hunt down every person in the world who might carry out or participate in an act of terrorism is akin to trying to hunt and catch a few specific ants in Texas: a nearly impossible task. Terrorism against America can only be defeated through careful intelligence collection, surveillance, cooperative efforts among law enforcement and intelligence agencies, and resolving the root complaints of the terrorist-supporting population. One thing is certain: We\n\nYOUR MISSION: CRITICAL AWARENESS 7\n\nmay not get every operative, but we can stop key people at critical junctures before an attack occurs. This book will assist you in this effort. Defensive Action: The Detect, Deter, Defend (3D) Doctrine Your role in stopping terrorism is to learn how to use the information presented in this manual to see terrorists, make terrorists stop their planning, and/or stop terrorists as they attack. The U.S. government’s force-protection doctrine is based on the “3D” concept of “detect, deter, and defend.” It is a highly effective concept that can be applied to the homeland security community as well. You, as a professional, will detect the terrorist act in its planning stages through intelligence collection, use the intelligence-based approach of analysis and by taking aggressive action to deter an attack before the terrorists leave their safe house. These are the fundamentals necessary to defend our nation from attack. But before we can truly use this process, it helps to know a few things about the terrorists themselves.\n\nWHO THEY ARE: IDENTIFYING TERRORIST OPERATIVES If You Know the Terrorists, You Know Their Plans\n\nW\n\nho are terrorists? What is the single most important thing you should know? There are many terrorists, and they come from diverse social and economic backgrounds. However, the most important thing you should consider is this: The intention of the terrorist operative is to use simple but bold, innovative actions to defeat your security and to render high technology useless. This mode of operations, called “asymmetric warfare” or “technology judo,” is the terrorist’s profession. Terrorist operatives always consider the use of the most appropriate and lowest-end technology, best innovation, and exploiting any limits their target may have. However, these actions can be predicted and observed. Terrorists operate between the cracks of technology and laws, yet they must operate somewhere. They cannot hide in a safe house with the curtains drawn all day. Even that is an observable action that should draw suspicion. Terrorists do not apply any rules or values to their operations other than what will enable them to gain publicity for their cause and hurt the enemy. If you attempt to get a fix on them with stereotypes of cultural traits, they will adopt the ones you don’t suspect in order to carry out a mission. For example, more than one of the 9/11 skyjackers were seen in U.S. nightclubs. No American would think they were devout religious extremists given this behavior. In fact, they were using a simple technique to throw off government surveillance. The oldest rule of terrorism is in effect: “Do whatever it takes.” Rule 1: Anyone Can Be a Terrorist • To fight them, get inside terrorists’ heads and\n\n2\n\n10\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\nlearn their tactics. • Terrorists do not have the capability to counter conventional military force except on their own terms. • You must recognize the unusual activities that indicate an attack is planned or is under way.\n\nPOLICE NATIONALE, MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR, REPUBLIQUE DE FRANCE\n\n• Looking for one specific group may blind you to seeing the hundreds of other groups that may gain the expertise and skills equal to a group such as al-Qaeda.\n\nBasque ETA terrorists (left to right): Pikabea Uglade, TurrillasAranceta, SantestebanGoikoetxea, Zabula-Muguirra.\n\nWho Are Terrorists? It is a generally scandalous notion that terrorists must be treated with anything but contempt. In fact, that is one of the views that blinds us. Terrorists must be respected for what they are: determined, ruthless human beings who use death and destruction to meet their goals. If you underestimate them, they will inevitably surprise you. You do not have to like terrorists, but you must respect their capability and their ability to realize their deadly objectives. Here are some key things to know. Terrorists Are: •\n\nHuman beings: Terrorists are not automatons as depicted by Hollywood. They are human beings with emotions, feelings, and concerns. These emotions are channeled into lethal action and often bring innocent people within their definition of “enemy.” If you ignore them as people, you may witness the horrifying determination of human intelligence.\n\n•\n\nRevered within their culture/ideology: What may be an evil, horrific deed to you or me may\n\nWHO THEY ARE: IDENTIFYING TERRORIST OPERATIVES 11\n\nbe a respectful and honorable act to someone else. Don’t judge terrorist actions by Western values, no matter how horrible the acts; ignoring their perspective will blind you to the terrorists’ potential for future action. Have professional respect for a foreign culture, a strange philosophy, or a disagreeable ideology and use it to identify ways to predict and stop their acts. •\n\nRational in their actions: Terrorists are rarely insane. They are generally intelligent, clear thinking, and rational. In the heat of an attack, they harness the human ability to overcome obstacles and attack with clarity and with ruthlessness. Westerners who observe this ruthlessness may view it as “insane.”\n\n•\n\nWell motivated: Terrorists use personal motivation to carry out the deadly acts necessary to demonstrate their determination.\n\n•\n\nMentally justified in their actions: Terrorists view the necessity of the mission as justifying any act necessary to meet their goals. Murdering women and children, attacking nurseries, blowing up hundreds or thousands of people can always be justified in the mind of the terrorist. For the terrorist, the end justifies the means.\n\nClassifying Terrorist Operatives by Skills Level\n\nSome Facts About Terrorists • Rarely are terrorists insane, though their acts may appear insane. • Terrorists are human beings who care about their families, ideology, and cultural values. • Terrorists are usually very well organized when ready to attack. • They rely on seemingly random acts of violence to inculcate fear. • They may fail in the attempt but have won when they gain your attention. • If you know terrorists’ options, you can beat them. • Terrorists fear one thing only . . . not making it out of the safe house to carry out the attack.\n\n12\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\nThe traditional method of categorizing terrorist groups and operatives has been to classify them by their philosophy or region of operations. This is an excellent method for academics, but for anyone involved in detecting, responding to, or analyzing terrorism, there is a more exact method: classifying terrorist groups by their relative level of experience and skillfulness in terrorist activities. The reason that terrorist skills levels matter, now more than ever, is their ability to project these skills past the combined resources of the world’s intelligence and homeland defense agenThe Terrorist Recognition Guide cies. The officer on the street, defines terrorists in the following the soldier on patrol, and the intelligence analyst need to manner: Any person or group of know not just who they are people who fail in, reject, or are dealing with, but how skilldisenfranchised from political, ful these people are. Some economic, or personal objectives groups are going to be natuand deliberately choose to use acts rally more adept than others in certain fields, but there is of terrorism as a tool of political a very clear hierarchy of violence, a method of protest, or skills.\n\neffecting change.\n\nGovernment-trained terrorist organizations are better funded, staffed, and trained than guerrilla or radical revolutionary groups that spontaneously start terrorist attacks. In the same vein, the amateur who is unsupported by anyone may be able to perform a major attack, but still lacks professional skills when compared to guerrillas or revolutionaries. We have classified terrorist groups from Class I—the best supported and most skillful—to Class V, the least skillful. The need to know terrorists’ skills is paramount in stopping them. On the street level, the value of this knowledge exceeds almost every other kind of intelligence except their location and strength. Critical questions must be considered before implementing any antiterrorism measures or counter-terrorist operations. Critical information may be found in the answers to these questions: Is the terrorist a combat-experienced guerrilla who learned to fire the AK-47 rifle and RPG-7 rocket launcher from nine years of age? Is he a former American infantry soldier turned antigovernment militiaman who studied The Anarchist Cookbook and builds homemade\n\nWHO THEY ARE: IDENTIFYING TERRORIST OPERATIVES 13\n\nbombs? Is she a member of a foreign intelligence agency with years of special operations skills and weapons training? Is she a logistician with a religious extremist group or a walking bomb? Each answer is going to affect how you deal with these terrorists. You will adjust your tactics according to their skill not yours. When the Special Operations Forces face a terrorist threat, the first thing they want to know is the relative combat experience and weapons that a group has in its possession. For the intelligence analyst, the general skills level is the key to the structure, including funding lines, potential weapons procurement, and intelligence collection. Law enforcement officers want to know what terrorists will do when stopped for a speeding ticket. SWAT teams want to know if they have the skills level and fire support to conduct an extremely high-risk warrant arrest. The higher the skills class, the less likely an occurrence of a dangerous individual encounter before an attack. Higher-skills terrorists want to complete their mission and use intelligence tradecraft to blend and slip in and out of foreign societies. Amateurs are usually hotheads who may “hit the steel” at the first sign of law enforcement. You can see why we need to change the ways we classify terrorist operatives. The following charts are general in scope but will allow you to quickly group threats by relative risk to you and your operations.\n\n14\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\nC E N T R A L INTELLIGENCE A G E N C Y, REPUBLIC OF KOREA\n\nClass I Terrorist: The Government-Trained Professional (Including Foreign Intelligence Threats)\n\nFEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\n\nNorth Korean Intelligence Officer Kim Chun-Hyee killed 115 people when she placed a bomb on a Korean Air airliner.\n\nIntelligence profile: Government-trained professional terrorists are generally very well trained because of the enormous resources many nations can put into professionalizing a few agents to carry out terrorist acts. Selected from key party personnel, loyal military members, secret police, and intelligence communities, they are trained to carry out missions with maximum secrecy. Class I terrorists may operate with official cover—as diplomats, support staff, or official representatives in embassies or consulate offices. They may also use nonofficial roles (nonofficial cover), including posing as businesspeople, students, merchants, immigrants, or opposition group volunteers. Terrorists trained by the foreign intelligence agencies of Chile, Cuba, Libya, Iraq, Iran, and North Korea have conducted assassinations, mass murders, and abductions, and have supplied other less skillful terrorist groups with weapons, training, and equipment.

Sex: Male or female (females may act occasionally as suicide bombers but mainly work in logistics cells). Education: Diverse, but generally university educated. Upbringing: All classes; generally a devout religious follower. Criminal history: Often, no criminal background. Military history: Some have military training and are often trained at local or overseas professional terrorism schools. Most common operations and experience: Sophisticated and advanced improvised explosive bombings; suicide/martyrdom attacks; explosives and firearms assassination; advanced armed raids/light infantry weapons attacks; kidnappings; skyjackings; maritime attacks; infrastructure attacks; rudimentary weapons of mass destruction; cyberattacks. Special Characteristics of the Class II Terrorist Professionally trained: Many are graduates from professional terrorism schools and are often allowed to design and implement low-level operations. Groups associated with al-Qaeda were trained in Afghanistan, Sudan, Lebanon, Iran, Algeria, Yemen, and even the United States. Secret locations may still exist for advanced courses. Experienced: Senior operatives have gained operational experience through years of avoiding numerous international police and covert intelligence agencies. For example, groups within Israel have managed to avoid an outstanding counter-terrorist force that has arrested or killed dozens of terrorist operatives and detained or deported hundreds of supporters. They still manage to carry out waves of suicide bombings in the heart of Israel. Before being allowed to move up the chain, most operatives must participate in supporting other terrorist operations as junior cell members. Professional-level operators are often tested on battlefields around the world.

However, it must be understood that al-Qaeda (AQ) is not one group but a collective of organizations that cooperate and receive funds and orders from Osama bin Laden. Al-Qaeda is the hub of a network of many groups and individuals who are of a like mind. It is an inspirational global organization that motivates individuals to join the proclaimed jihad and become comrades in arms.\n\nAnas al Liby\n\nOperatives come from almost every country in the world with a Muslim population.

It should always be presumed that there are at least a few dozen AQ operatives and supporters in the United States at any given time. The numbers of active supporters worldwide are conservatively estimated in the thousands. Their attacks include the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City; the 1998 bombings of American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Aden, Yemen; and the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. After the attack by U.S. forces on its base in Afghanistan, AQ immediately began to reconstitute into a broader, less centralized follow-on organization. Its operatives and inspired activists will continue their jihad, possibly in greater numbers than before. They are a formidable enemy but not unbeatable; compared with other terrorist groups such as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Hezbollah, AQ thinks big. Spectacular simultaneous attacks are its modus operandi. However, al-Qaeda has always relied on simple tactics in executing its attacks. For the investigative team, it may be a little reassuring to know that al-Qaeda has always left a massive trail of tips and hints despite its emphasis on operations security. Many of the TAPIs prior to the 9/11 attack were clear and unambiguous to a trained intelligence analyst. It is\n\nJapanese Red Army terrorist wanted poster.\n\nup to intelligence and law enforcement to find, analyze, and act aggressively on intelligence discovered through investigation.

They may live a secular life but secretly fight for a religious-based political cause. Irish Republican Army members, for example, are Catholics seeking political reunion with the Catholic south of Ireland against the Protestant loyalists. Typical Class III Terrorist Profile Age: 20 - 50. Sex: Male or female. Education: From no education to university educated. Upbringing: Average to upper-middle-class family background.

This class of terrorists is generally harder to find. These operatives are usually trained inside the group, with some advanced professional training in foreign countries—although such training is becoming increasingly harder to obtain. Such operatives have gained operational experience through years of avoiding police and planning operations. They generally learn survival lessons when compatriots are arrested, and operational and personal security is a critical concern.

Class IV Terrorist: Guerrilla/ Mercenary Soldier\n\nPOLICE NATIONALE, MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR, REPUBLIQUE DE FRANCE\n\nIntelligence profile: Class IV terrorists are generally the most predictable of terrorists because they fall back on basic military training and equipment used in military or paramilitary experience. Basic infantry weapons such as the AK-47 and M-16 are preferred weapons in their armed forces and provide the most reliable firepower for their terrorist operations. Guerrilla terrorists are proficient at general military operations for their country of origin. They occasionally have some urban terrorism experience, but this is limited to bombings, simple assassinations, ambushes, and light infantry weapons assaults. Some countries use very young children as soldiers to conduct surveillance or act as gunmen. Mercenaries:\n\nMercenary Bob Denard\n\nSince the 1960s and even more recently in Yugoslavia and Africa, Western mercenaries have conducted terrorist acts. French mercenary Colonel Robert Denard conducted several coups d’etat in the Reunion Islands after 1975, for instance, as well as numerous acts of terrorism including summary execution of the former leaders, until the French military intervened and arrested him. South African, British, and American mercenaries have been arrested worldwide while attempting to carry out military operations. In 1981, the well-known mercenary “Mad Mike” Hoare tried to topple the government of the Seychelles. Foreign mercenary groups, like guerrilla soldiers, usually have excellent combat proficiency in general military operations. Typical Class IV Terrorist Profile Age: 10 to 50. Sex: Male or female.

Many paramilitaries may subcontract themselves to terrorist groups with higher capability and carry out easy tasks such as abductions and assassinations for money. Often these financial arrangements may use ethnic or territorial rhetoric as a “political” mask for moneymaking goals. American militia groups are a low-level variant on paramilitaries. Rarely do they carry out large-scale attacks, such as the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City; for the most part, their acts have been small in scale and limited by law enforcement. This does not mean they could not become a significant threat. Often they will carry out sympathetic, follow-up harassment attacks after major external attacks on America.

This incident remains under investigation.\n\n3 INTELLIGENCE PROFILING SUSPECTED TERRORISTS Rule #1 Consider Everyone a Potential Terrorist •\n\nTerrorist recognition and identification can be effectively performed only through intelligence profiling of suspected terrorists.\n\n•\n\nRacial profiling alone blinds the observer to other terrorist groups on the attack.\n\n•\n\nAdopt intelligence profiling: Learn to recognize the behaviors necessary to plan, prepare, and carry out a terrorist act.\n\nTerrorist groups should be tracked by collecting the best intelligence possible. This basic information collection must then be matched against the profile of the members known to be in that group. The difficulty of profiling terrorists is that many characteristics and beliefs about terrorist operators are based on investigators’ personal stereotypes, not intelligence. Virtually all of those stereotypes are based on unevaluated information, movies and television, or the personal bias of the observer. Basic Questions to Be Considered When Intelligence Profiling Let us assume you have a terrorist suspect under surveillance or in custody. Ask yourself or intelligence staff the following questions. 1. Does the suspected operative come from a known terrorist group? It’s good to determine whether the suspect acted alone or as part of a group. If not alone, which group is suspected or believed to be responsible for the incident? Was the group working in cooperation with other terrorist groups? If so, the profile may branch out to include those supporting groups’ operatives. 2. What is the suspect’s nationality? Where is the suspect from? Is he local, a foreign resident, or immigrant? If a group, from which nation does\n\n28\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\nthe suspected group recruit its members? If the answer is more than one country, the intelligence profile may change from operative to operative. One stereotype is that U.S. domestic terrorists are not really terrorists but a criminal nuisance. As the 1993 Oklahoma City bombing and the July 4, 2002, Los Angeles Airport shooting at the El Al ticket counter showed, however, being a U.S. citizen or long-term U.S. resident does not rule a person out as a potential terrorist. 3. What are the suspect’s race and culture? Race alone is a poor individual identifier of a terrorist operative. Groups may adapt to security that targets suspect races by using operatives who are, or seem to be, of a different race. If security forces specifically seek and screen non-Caucasian men, for example, then a good group could shift to using Caucasian females to support the operation. Here are some questions you should ask yourself when evaluating a terrorist operative’s race: •\n\nHave operatives from a specific race been positively identified as belonging to a suspected group? If so, from which race?\n\n•\n\nCan people from this specific race be confused with another race?\n\n•\n\nAre the group’s known operatives of a distinct ethnic minority or majority of a particular nation?\n\n•\n\nHave people of different races been used by this group for attack, penetration, logistical support, or finances?\n\n•\n\nWill focusing on one race blind me to other operatives from other cooperating groups?\n\n4. What is the suspect’s age? Like race, age alone is a poor identifier of a person on a terrorist mission. Terrorists can be of almost any age. Young children are usually not operatives but can be tasked as couriers, lookouts, and future recruits. Many groups have youth organizations that use children as operatives. 5. What is the suspect’s sex? Terrorism is an equal-opportunity employer. It is clear that both men and women are capable of perform-\n\nINTELLIGENCE PROFILING SUSPECTED TERRORISTS 29\n\ning virtually all of the operations on a terrorist menu. Unless there is specific intelligence on the sex of the operative, intelligence profiling should be gender neutral. If a group almost always uses male operatives, the observer should expect the eventual use of females to foil security and to facilitate penetration. 6. What clothing is worn by the suspect? Clothing can identify certain types of operations due to a need to conceal weapons, explosives, and equipment. Bulky jackets worn in summer or long knee-length coats on a clear day can conceal bombs and machine guns. The clothes that a terrorist operative wears are not a good indicator of intent, however. Stereotypical images of terrorists wearing black masks, Arab-style kaffiyehs, or black uniforms like SWAT teams are rarely borne out in reality. Competent terrorist operatives will dress to suit the environment in which they wish to operate. Did the suspect try to conceal a weapon? The following weapons can be concealed by certain clothing using the following matrix:\n\nCoat Length\n\nAssault Rifle\n\nSubmachine Gun\n\nShotgun\n\nPistol\n\nBomb\n\nGrenade\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nKnee Yes (folding stock)\n\nYes\n\nYes (FS)\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nMidthigh\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes (sawed)\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nHip\n\nNo\n\nYes (mini)\n\nYes (sawed)\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nBaggy shirt\n\nNo\n\nYes (mini)\n\nYes (sawed)\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nTight shirt\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nAnkle\n\n7. What is the suspect’s physical condition? The physical condition of the operative may reflect the mission. The September 11 hijackers needed physical force to overpower passengers and crews. Al-Qaeda\n\n30\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\nemphasized weight and martial-arts training for the 9/11 skyjackers. The more professional terrorist will stay in good physical condition. Criminal enterprises operating in a terrorist capacity also tend to use former military types, among whom muscle and endurance are valued. Amateurs, paramilitaries, and militias reflect the culture they come from physically as well as operationally. A lean Colombian right-wing paramilitary member may differ greatly in physique from an overweight American militiaman. 8. What is the suspect’s native language? The language that operatives speak can be an initial indicator of their nation of origin when other identification is not possible. Some operatives are multilingual, but one language may dominate their conversation. On the other hand, an accent is a general indicator of foreign nationality—but care must be taken to precisely identify the language. For example, a person who speaks English well but with a noticeable French accent may be from Louisiana, Michigan, Indiana, Canada, France, the Caribbean, North Africa, the Pacific islands, or Central Africa. Note that first-generation legal immigrants may speak with a foreign accent as well as a foreign language, whereas second-generation immigrants may have absolutely no identifiable foreign accent. 9. Does the suspect possess incriminating documents? •\n\nPassport identification: False or multiple passports are a good reason to begin suspecting a person as a terrorist operative. Still, some nations have flexible passport laws or allowances for legal, multiple passports. Remember, an operative may be traveling on entirely legal documents from friendly nations.\n\n•\n\nPocket litter: Small items such as scrap paper, Post-it notes, bank statements, and other materials are good evidence sources.\n\n•\n\nConcealment: Where the documents are concealed is also a good indicator of a terrorist operative (or for that matter a drug smuggler, diamond trader, or other nonterrorist). Are the documents sewn into clothing? Hidden in shoes, baggage, or other concealed conveyance?\n\nINTELLIGENCE PROFILING SUSPECTED TERRORISTS 31\n\n•\n\nClearly suspicious books/documents/sensitive intelligence: The person suspected may be carrying materials that directly support terrorist violence. Books such as group tactical manuals, philosophy, and bomb-building cookbooks are just one indicator. However, direct intelligence—such as clearly written ransom notes or bombing claim letters and plans—should arouse a much greater level of suspicion. A terrorist involved in the 1993 World Trade Center plot was arrested at the airport carrying bombmaking manuals.\n\n•\n\nClean operative: On the other hand, is the operative completely clean? An absolute lack of anything except cash and one piece of suspect identification may be indicative of an operative en route to a mission or joining a cell.\n\n10. Does the suspect possess weapons? Is the suspect carrying a legal or illegal firearm? If the suspect is carrying a When is racial profiling alone firearm, is it a common appropriate? When you have speweapon in the United States, or is it exotic here but cific intelligence on a specific perfairly common globally, son! Always “intelligence profile” such as the Russian Tokarov a suspected terrorist. or Makarov pistol? Such weapons could indicate overseas training; people like to use weapons they are familiar with. Other indicators may include: •\n\nFlashy weapons: Is the suspect carrying a stainless-steel or gold-plated weapon as opposed to a normal blued (dark) weapon? Such conspicuous weapons are preferred by those with greater concern for looks than for mission-specific functionality, such as criminals or Class IV or Class V terrorists. A flashy weapon may indicate a terrorist with a commercial supply source. Invariably, people who want flashy weapons also want full-sized, large-caliber weapons (the larger the caliber, the better).\n\n• Technology-heavy weapons: Does the operative use very sophisticated technology in weaponry, to\n\n32\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\ngain precision fire? These enhancements indicate a trained professional—or an amateur who likes the look of the enhancements. Only the precision of the fire will tell you for certain. Westerners are more likely to use such enhancements than are foreign terrorists. Technological enhancements might include high-intensity tactical weapons lights, laser aiming modules (with or without night observation devices), reflex shooting sights with luminous aiming reticles (such as Trijicon ACOG, Reflex, or Leopold tactical sights), or high-powered sniper optics on assault rifles. 11. Did the suspect use concealment tradecraft? Tradecraft is any method or technique developed for intelligence officers or terrorist operatives to carry out their mission. Concealment tradecraft refers to techniques of concealing and infiltrating any weapons, explosives, or other components that might tip off authorities to the mission. An example of group tradecraft might be concealing detonation cord in a guitar string package, or attempting to smuggle plastic explosives in one member’s shoes. 12. Does the suspect carry large quantities of money? Many drug mules, smugglers, unscrupulous businessmen, and other people attempt to move money illegally across borders. Terrorists are no exception. Large quantities of cash, possibly found in multiple concealed locations, may indicate a terrorist operative when combined with other evidence. In July 2002, for example, a man suspected of being an al-Qaeda terrorist was arrested entering the United States with twelve million dollars in false cashier’s checks. 13. Does the suspect use political or religious rhetorical statements? Does the suspect immediately spout off rhetoric or verbal threats? When combined with other TAPI or evidence, this could be a red flag. 14. “X Factor”? This is a personal bias check. Ask yourself, “Could I be absolutely wrong about this person?” Weigh your answer against the accumulated evidence.\n\nTERRORIST TRAINING\n\n4\n\nerrorists can be identified by the type of training they have received. Terrorists may be trained as individuals or as a group. Below are some methods of training that terrorists seek out and acquire:\n\nT •\n\nSelf-education: Lone members learn skills from individual reading, videos, or other materials.\n\n•\n\nCommercial school training: Members may attend commercial shooting, knife-fighting, surveillance, or other courses providing skills that could contribute to an overall mission.\n\n•\n\nSafe-house training: Members train together typically in cells of three or five members, at a covert location within the area of operations.\n\n•\n\nProfessional terrorist school training: Members train at a dedicated terrorist training center or course in a remote part of their country or overseas in a sympathetic foreign country.\n\nTerrorist Training Schools and Camps In the 1960s and 1970s, many schools for terrorists were run directly by certain state governments. The Soviet Union, for instance, conducted courses through the KGB’s Executive Action Department (Directorate S, Department V). They were responsible for training designated terrorist groups in murder and lethal attacks (mokrie dela or “wet affairs”) that involved terrorist assault, personnel assassination, abduction, and other terrorist skills. This training was expanded to include sabotage against critical infrastructure such as nuclear power plants, rails, and energy production. Though many of these formally trained terrorists have retired from active operations, many others are now members of the senior leadership of active terrorist groups. Their experiences, lessons learned, tradecraft, and battle concepts are still valid. It should be assumed that such wisdom has been passed down to new operatives through courses and manuals. Other nations and even terrorist groups have\n\nCountries with Known Terrorism Schools • Cuba • North Korea • Iran • Pakistan • Syria • Lebanon • Palestine • Sudan\n\n34\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\nformed professional terrorism schools. Libya, Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Lebanon, and India have hosted official and unofficial terrorist training centers. Legal training in firearms or attack skills that can be applied to terrorist acts are offered in many countries, including the United States. Terrorist Combat Training Terrorists must learn how to use weapons and explosives as a basic part of their paramilitary duties. Training comes in three levels: basic, intermediate and advanced. Basic Training •\n\nWeapons parts familiarization.\n\n•\n\nBasic rifle firing.\n\n•\n\nThrowing hand grenades.\n\n•\n\nLaying and fusing landmines.\n\n•\n\nFiring rocket-propelled grenades.\n\n•\n\nSuppressing fire and firing on the move.\n\n•\n\nCover and concealment.\n\n•\n\nBasic camouflage.\n\nIntermediate Training •\n\nMortars and rockets.\n\n•\n\nAdvanced rifle and grenade use.\n\n•\n\nRifle-mounted grenade launchers.\n\n•\n\nBattle tactics.\n\n•\n\nLeadership.\n\n•\n\nTerrorist tradecraft in foreign countries.\n\n•\n\nBasic improvised explosive devices and booby traps.\n\nAdvanced Training •\n\nUrban battle tactics.\n\n•\n\nAdvanced battle tactics.\n\n• Close-quarters combat (CQC). • Sniper and long-rifle skills. • VIP close protection. •\n\nAdvanced improvised explosive devices.\n\nTERRORIST TRAINING 35\n\n•\n\nAdvanced bomb building.\n\n•\n\nCommercial books or “how-to” military manuals.\n\n• Bomb-making manuals: Poor Man’s James Bond, Anarchist Cookbook. • Weapons components and repair manuals. • Improvised weapons and silencer construction. • Chemical explosives formulas. TERRORIST TRAINING CASE STUDY Wisconsin Terrorist Training Camp In 1989 members of the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas are alleged to have run a weekend terrorist training facility in Wisconsin. Federal officers learned of the camp by a confession given to Israeli authorities from a Palestinian man, Sharif Alwan, who was arrested in Israel in 1995. Israel claims Sharif was recruited by Hamas before arriving in the U.S. and received cell-level training near Milwaukee. Alwan was under investigation for money laundering and fundraising for a terrorist organization when U.S. authorities learned of his training, and allegedly detailed how he was trained in using M-16 and AK-47 assault rifles, explosive devices, and techniques on how to booby-trap cars. He was also alleged to have gone to Syria and Lebanon for additional terrorist skills training, including the use of hand grenades, rocket propelled grenade launchers, and covert communications. Mr. Alwan asserts that he was tortured into his confession about terrorist training by the Israeli police.\n\nPre-Incident Indicators of Terrorist Training or Practice •\n\nPartially built live weapons and devices.\n\n•\n\nDummy weapons made of rubber or wood.\n\n•\n\nTerrorist textbooks and manuals.\n\n• Mini-Manual for the Urban Guerrilla (general).\n\n36\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\n• IRA Volunteers Manual (IRA). • Encyclopedia of the Jihad (al-Qaeda). • FATAH Manual of Operations (PFLP). • Open-source professional tactical manuals: • U.S. Army Ranger handbook. • U.S. Army common tasks handbook. • U.S. Navy SEAL Tactical Training manual. • U.S. Special Forces weapons CD-ROM. • U.S. Army FM-21-76 Survival Manual. • Videos on military subjects—combined with other intelligence could indicate terrorist usage: • Sniping and marksmanship. • Radioactivity effects. • Famous terrorist attacks. • Bomb effects. •\n\nAudiocassettes/CD-ROMs/Web sites on:\n\n• Extremist philosophy. • Antigovernment propaganda. Survival and Tradecraft Training Foreign-born terrorists who are not U.S. residents need more training to prevent attracting undue attention to themselves while preparing for missions. The best way to stay under the radar is to use U.S. citizens as operatives. Otherwise, foreign operatives need to attain legal documents, assume new identities, or further the identities they were assigned. These operatives need to learn tradecraft. Examples of Operative Survival and Tradecraft Foreign culture survival: This training may involve operatives learning the local language, getting jobs that legitimize their cover story, learning to use local telephone systems, studying local and national laws in an effort to exploit them, acquiring the same documents that other legal or illegal immigrants have, and using of immigrant support agencies and welfare systems to\n\nTERRORIST TRAINING 37\n\nappear normal. Identity assumption/cover: Operatives are usually given a cover story and necessary supporting documents to keep the story alive until legal documents are acquired by living in a foreign country. This “cover story” is usually studied until the operative knows it by heart. However, terrorists may inadvertently use real names in correspondence and telephone calls, which they usually cover up by using a “code name” in place of their cover name. Abu Jihad and Abu Nidal are famous cover names; others such as The Engineer, the Amir, and Commandante Marcos are also good examples. A nickname like Carlos the Jackal is not a good example because it uses the actual name of the terrorist (Carlos Illyich Ramirez Sanchez). Contact procedures are a verbal or nonverbal signal tradecraft developed by the group or used by a foreign intelligence agency, designed to inform other terrorist group members or leadership of danger or a special situation. •\n\nA contact signal may be any kind of nonverbal signal that requests communication or informs the operative that a message is pending. This could be as simple as a half-open window or chalk marks on walls. The only way to detect such a code is through careful intelligence analysis when seemingly routine actions of a suspect (drawing down a certain window shade) repeatedly corresponds to observed events (the suspect meets at a café with a second operative).\n\n•\n\nAn emergency contact signal may be a hasty, onetime signal sending the message that an emergency exists and the operative must take action, such as aborting a rendezvous, canceling an attack, or departing the country.\n\nInterrogation resistance: Operatives are trained to resist physical and environmental punishment, in case of capture. Many terrorist groups train their members by “capturing” them and conducting harsh, simulated interrogation to discover how much they can endure before they will break. Government agencies and the armed forces also emphasize training for the event of\n\n38\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\nbeing captured by terrorists. Resistance training may include: •\n\nPhysical punishment: The operative is conditioned to take a beating or given tips on how to endure crude tortures, such as electric shock or mutilations.\n\n•\n\nPsychological preparation: The operative is trained to focus on noncritical information and to use this as a tool to defeat an interrogator. Sayings from the Bible or Koran, party propaganda, or simple words and phrases may give the operative the fortitude to resist psychological pressures.\n\n•\n\nEscape and evasion (E&E): Depending on their area of origin, terrorists may have extensive field training and may be skilled in picking locks, breaking bonds, and escaping captivity. Specialized courses or classes and materials in lock picking or escaping handcuffs indicate E&E skills training.\n\nUse of False Documents Purchase: Hezbollah once purchased 100 legitimate French national identity cards and 50 valid passports for cash from a corrupt French embassy official in Africa. Identity theft: Operatives may use the passports or histories of innocent people through identity theft. Fabrication of documents: Virtually every terrorist organization uses criminally acquired or altered false documents to mask the identity of its members. Many of these documents are produced by professional forgers. Examples of Terrorist Use of Forged or False Documentation •\n\nHezbollah in Latin America: In 1998, a Lebanese citizen was arrested in Cuidad del Este, Paraguay, forging passports and U.S. residence and work visas (green cards) for Hezbollah operatives entering the United States.\n\n•\n\nAl-Qaeda in Italy: False Italian national identity cards were found on logistics cell members believed to have been preparing for a cyanide attack on the U.S. embassy in Rome in 2002.\n\nTERRORIST TRAINING 39 •\n\nCuban intelligence in the U.S.: Cuban intelligence supplied an Argentine passport for a Puerto Rican Macheteros terrorist who carried out a $7.1 million armored car heist in Connecticut.\n\n•\n\nIrish terrorists in Colombia: IRA members captured in Colombia in 2001 used false British passports and identity cards to travel in Latin America to train FARC terrorists.\n\nTERRORISM 101: WHY THE TERRORIST CHOOSES THIS PATH What Is Terrorism? xactly what is terrorism? For Americans, since September 11, the term has become especially loaded, and is sometimes used to describe acts that are, by widely accepted definition, not terrorism. Even worldwide, the term has come to have such heavy rhetorical value that politicians and other leaders have been known to label the actions of their opponents as “terrorist acts.” Some actions do qualify as terrorism, and some don’t. Often terrorism is seen as dissident bands of unknown individuals striking innocent targets. Other times it is defined as the psychological intimidation inherent in a threat or an act of violence. Clearly, the word is difficult to pin down—but a basic definition can encompass the components that all societies find agreement on.\n\nE\n\nDefinitions of Terrorism There are several variations on the definition of terrorism; the following quotes are provided to show those differences. U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation “The unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.” U.S. Department of State “Premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by sub-national groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience.” U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) “The calculated use of violence or threat of violence to inculcate fear, intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are general-\n\n5\n\n42\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\nly political, religious or ideological.” U.S. DoD Directive 2000.12H “The calculated use of violence or threat of violence to attain goals—political, religious or ideological in nature—by instilling fear or using intimidation or coercion. Terrorism involves a criminal act, often symbolic in nature, intended to influence an audience beyond the immediate victims.” U.S. Code “Premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by sub-national groups or clandestine agents.” United Nations “Terrorism is a unique form of crime. Terrorist acts often contain elements of warfare, politics and propaganda. For security reasons and due to lack of popular support, terrorist organizations are usually small, making detection and infiltration difficult. Although the goals of terrorists are sometimes shared by wider constituencies, their methods are generally abhorred.” British Government “Terrorism is the use of serious violence against persons or property, or the threat to use such violence, to intimidate or coerce a government, the public, or any section of the public for political, religious or ideological ends. The term serious violence would need to be defined so that it included serious disruption, for instance resulting from attacks on computer installations or public utilities.” Russian Federation Law 130 FZ to Fight Terrorism “Terrorism is violence or the threat of violence against individuals or organizations, and also the destruction (damaging) of or threat to destroy (damage) property and other material objects, such as threaten to cause loss of life, significant damage to property, or other socially dangerous consequences and are implemented with a view to violating public security, intimidating the population, or influencing the adoption of decisions advantageous to terrorists by organs of power, or satisfying their unlawful material and (or) other interests; attempts on the lives of statesmen or public figures perpetrated with a view to ending their state or other political activity or out\n\nTERRORISM 101: WHY THE TERRORIST CHOOSES THIS PATH 43\n\nof revenge for such activity; attacks on representatives of foreign states or staffers of international organizations enjoying international protection, and also on the official premises or vehicles of persons enjoying international protection if these actions are committed with a view to provoking war or complicating international relations.” The Terrorism Recognition Handbook’s Definition Terrorism is the calculated use of criminal violence or threat of violence by a covert or overt individual, group, entity, special-interest organization, or government agency specifically designed to target people, commerce, and/or infrastructures soley for political advantage. The definition used in this book offers a more precise description of what constitutes terrorism. The facts of this book’s definition include the beliefs that: Terrorism is not political activism or “freedom fighting.” It is a conscious choice to deliberately select deadly tactics as a criminally symbolic act to spread fear, intimidation, and horror, to popularize or gain support for a cause. It includes intention to extort funds and/or influence an audience beyond the immediate victims. Terrorism is an illegitimate expression of dissent, demand for conflict resolution, or form of psychological warfare that is unjustified at any time. Terrorism is the calculated use of covert criminal violence or threat of violence: The act must break laws or conspire to break laws that are common to most societies. Though terrorism usually involves violent acts, such as murder, battery, and destruction of property, it could also mean nonviolent disruptive acts that are broad threats to safety and result in the mass spread of fear. Terrorist acts are calculated acts; they are not carried out randomly. Many terrorist attacks may seem arbitrary in their execution, but each event has been deliberately planned to create a specific effect. Terrorism is deliberately selected as a tactic to effect change: The group must make a conscious decision to reject or abandon peaceful political change and further its agenda through the use of terrorist acts and tactics. Terrorism is the targeting of innocent people, including military personnel: At the heart of an act of terrorism are terrorists who specifically focus their acts of violence on killing, injuring, and/or generating fear in\n\n44\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\ninnocent victims. The victim may be the immediate target, especially in assassination and physical intimidation attacks, but terrorists care far more about the psychological impact of the attack on society at large. The purpose of carrying out the act is not only to meet tactical objectives but also to terrorize a population. As explained in the next section, military personnel may never be targeted legitimately by terrorists. Many terrorist groups have tried to arbitrarily designate military personnel and bases as legitimate targets. Even in wartime, however, terrorism remains a criminal attack punishable in criminal courts after the conflict. Terrorists who attack in wartime are considered unlawful combatants under the Geneva Conventions of 1949. Terrorism is the use of symbolic acts to attract media and reach a large audience: The publicity surrounding an event is critical for terrorists to gain influence and spread fear. The fear effect must extend beyond immediate victims and must symbolize the power of the group; therefore terrorist attacks tend to be spectacular—depending on the tactics and goals of the organization—and spread fear. No matter how large or small the act, its symbolism is of far greater importance to the perpetrators than its immediate impact on the group’s victims. Terrorism is illegitimate combat, even in war: Terrorism is not a legitimate form of warfare. The rules of warfare were formalized in Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and Its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land (The Hague, October 18, 1907). These rules, which called for armed forces to specifically avoid targeting civilians, were expanded on after World War II. Governments and other groups that target civilians clearly violate these rules. Terrorism is never justified: The use of terrorism is immoral and unjustified. Terrorists who claim religious conviction for their actions may attempt to use spiritual direction from a higher authority, whether God or a human spiritual leader, as a valid reason for acts of violence. In almost every country, terrorism is a crime. No matter how desperate the situation, choosing to commit an act of terrorism over nonviolent resistance or political activism is not justified.\n\nTERRORISM 101: WHY THE TERRORIST CHOOSES THIS PATH 45\n\nAre You Capable of Being a Terrorist? Place yourself in this scenario and consider how you would respond. Consider for a moment that you are a thirty-five-year-old man living in a country that is under military occupation and being settled by people from another culture and religion. The occupation came during a war. From that moment on, you and your family are being treated as less than human. Curfews from dusk to dawn are commonplace; random killings, sanctioned by the occupying government, of your neighbors by the soldiers are designed to keep you in your home and “peaceful.” The army and government hail the settlers for killing civilians and send more armed soldiers after each incident of resistance by your people. The resistance starts by throwing rocks; in response, children are shot with impunity. Your very existence earns you the title of “terrorist.” There is no justice system, and the numbers of your friends and family killed or injured reach into the dozens. One day you come home and find that your wife has been beaten by soldiers while walking your son to school. Her offense? Walking too close to a military convoy. She lies seriously injured in the hospital. A week later while you are driving her home from the hospital with your son, an “instant curfew” is imposed. You have two minutes to get off the road—but your home is thirty minutes away. Soldiers in a tank see you driving down the road during curfew and fire an anti-tank round at your car. This shell designed to kill sixty-ton tanks hits your small car and vaporizes your wife and son. You survive the attack but are despondent. The incident is described to the international media as the army conducting a selective killing against a “terrorist cell.” Being a “terrorist,” your home is seized while you are in the hospital, and you lose every trace of your family history. The bodies of your wife and son are never returned to you, and you are later arrested. You are torn with grief and agony and a raging thirst for vengeance. In prison you meet the radical religious branch of your people. They offer you solace and sympathy. They all have similar stories and become your friends. After your release a few months later, you are contacted by a friend of your former cellmates, who suggests a way to resist the enemy. A man meets you\n\n46\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\nand offers you a chance to avenge your family’s murder. You will be honored. You will join your family in the afterlife . . . a belief that is already a core part of your religious values. All you have to do is drive a car next to an enemy’s convoy, push a button, and blow up along with the enemy soldiers. Regardless of the rightness or wrongness of the occupation army and the country that sent them, how would you or others in your society react in this situation? Would you be motivated to resist using rocks, firebombs, and grenades if your home was occupied? Would you pick up a gun to fight if your family were killed in the above manner? Would you be capable of detonating a car bomb? Stepping onto a bus full of people and blowing yourself up? When push comes to shove, are you really a person of peace or of action? This example is not only the scenario being used to attempt to justify suicide terrorism globally, it is becoming a common manifestation of the political, economic, and personal frustration in various cultures. People have become just such terrorists in China, Iraq, Chechnya, Indian Kashmir, Palestine, Afghanistan, and Sri Lanka. Most of us have a point at which we may become capable of acts of political violence. Knowing yours will help you understand the feelings of terrorists. Understand terrorists’ feelings, recognize how they use their pain and suffering to justify their deadly acts. What Is Not Terrorism? As stated above, many events that create fear or anxiety are quick to be called terrorism, when in fact they are not. For example, criminals—as individuals or in groups—may conduct acts of vandalism including arson, theft, other destruction of property, and even assault or murder. These acts can create an environment of fear and intimidation. However, they do not meet the true definition of terrorism if they are not being carried out specifically in order to terrorize a population and affect government policies. Common criminal behavior is not necessarily terrorism unless it supports terrorist groups and terrorist acts. Extremist political parties often maliciously label opposition groups “terrorists” in an effort to tar their\n\nTERRORISM 101: WHY THE TERRORIST CHOOSES THIS PATH 47\n\nimages or justify their elimination. Acts that do not constitute terrorism include: •\n\nCommon crimes conducted at a local level without intent of exploitation.\n\n•\n\nFreedom of speech (even if the source is a hate group).\n\n•\n\nNonviolent civil disobedience.\n\n•\n\nCivil disturbances and spontaneous rioting.\n\n•\n\nParticipation in elective or government processes.\n\n•\n\nProtests and assembly to present opposing views and express dissent.\n\n•\n\nConducting acts legal under a nation’s laws and international laws.\n\nSecurity professionals must be careful to preserve society’s civil liberties (including those of a terrorism suspect’s) unless you have overwhelming reasons, supported by written law and proper authority, to believe that the person represents a clear and immediate danger to society. No matter how distasteful or disagreeable the opinions of others are, no matter how they conflict with your personal political position, the safeguarding of civil liberties is as important as deterring terrorism. The only possible exception would be the imminent use of a weapon of mass destruction based on solid intelligence, which would probably force a nation into a state of emergency or martial law, but only temporarily. If civil rights are permanently stripped away, the terrorists have won. A person with a bomb or a gun en route to a mission is a clear target of the war on terrorism and within your authority to stop; of course, all efforts to disrupt terrorism must be legally sanctioned. Removing, denying, or suspending civil liberties, stifling freedom of speech, or attempting to use the hunt for terrorists as a platform to further personal or political goals against legal opposition hands the terrorists a victory. Additional Terms The following terms are used regularly by the U.S. intelligence, law enforcement, and defense communities responsible for dealing with terrorist threats.\n\n48\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\nAntiterrorism (AT): Defensive and preventive measures taken to reduce vulnerability to terrorist attack. Such measures may include installing physical security systems, providing and analyzing foreign and domestic intelligence, distributing information about threats, and training for response to potential future incidents. Limited response to a potential attack, such as an augmentation of security forces, is also an antiterrorism measure. Making the community and the public aware of potential terrorist threats is one principle of AT; the Terrorist Recognition Handbook is intended to be a key antiterrorism tool. Counterterrorism (CT): Offensive measures taken in response to a terrorist attack after it occurs. Within the context of a U.S. military response, CT includes the overt or clandestine use of forces to locate and neutralize terrorists and their facilities, rescue hostages, and recover intelligence on terrorists. •\n\nCT may include a wide variety of measures, from armed military action (such as the 1998 Tomahawk cruise missile attack on the Zawar Kili terrorist training center in Afghanistan) to clandestine operations (for instance, the DEA/FBI/CIA sting that led to the arrest of Lebanese hijacker Fuwaz Yunez in 1987).\n\n•\n\nCT may also include alerting homeland security forces and the National Guard, or deploying first responders such as emergency services, disaster management, fire departments, urban search and rescue, or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In case of an attack that is believed to be imminent, search and seizure teams such as FBI SWAT and hostage rescue teams, the Department of Energy Nuclear Emergency Search Teams (NEST), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT) may deploy to the incident site.\n\nForce Protection (FP): The U.S. Department of Defense program for the defense of military and government assets from terrorist and unconventional warfare attack. The philosophy of “detect, deter, and defend” is the foundation of military force protection.\n\nWHAT TERRORISTS BELIEVE The Historical Context of Terrorism errorism is not a new phenomenon; it may be one of the oldest forms of illegitimate political dissent. The use of violence or the threat of violence to “send a message” to political leaders, or society at large, has occurred throughout recorded history. Groups such as the Zealots and Sicari in biblical Palestine, and the Assassins of 11th-century Persia, are often cited as historical terrorists.\n\nT\n\nThe 18th and 19th centuries generated forms of terrorism that are still used today. It was the French Revolution leader, Maximilien Robespierre who coined the term “terrorism.” He publicly advocated its use as a political tool and employed public executions by guillotine to seize popular attention and terrify French society. Modern terrorism has its broadest roots in the mid20th century. The fathers of modern terrorism originated largely in Russia, where numerous groups, anarchists, and terror-advocating philosophers emerged, such as Sergi Nachayev and Mikhail Bakunin. Terrorism spread throughout Europe, where numerous heads of state were assassinated. It eventually came to the United States with the assassination of President McKinley in September 1901 and the Wall Street bombings of 1920. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Russian terrorism further expanded and was encouraged by the communist leadership. Lenin, also known as the “Red Prince,” encouraged collective terrorism. After World War I (triggered by the murder of Archduke Ferdinand by a Serbian terrorist), the Irish Republican Army under the leadership of Michael Collins used terrorism to win independence for the southern counties of Ireland. Modern terrorism saw its greatest social and ideological advances after World War II, although its foundation was laid in the mid-1880s. In the past few decades, terrorism has become\n\n6\n\n50\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\nincreasingly prevalent in our minds as a force of political change. As world politics have shifted, new political and ideological movements have emerged around the globe, some using terrorist violence to further their aims. In addition, international media coverage has given terrorists and their acts more visibility than ever. As our definition of terrorism suggests, the more public attention is focused on an attack, the more effective the attack is considered by terrorists. As the September 11 attacks revealed, the world stage provided by the Internet, by 24/7 news networks, and by other international media, can deliver just the kind of attention terrorist groups rely on. Billions of people can now witness the aftermath of a terrorist act nearly instantaneously. Historical Events That Influenced Today’s Terrorism Which developments have had the greatest effect on fostering terrorism since the end of World War II? Below is a list of the most influential movements and events. Revolutionary and Anticolonial Political Opposition Much of the political upheaval over the last fifty years can be traced to the end of colonialism in Africa and Asia, and the fall of communism throughout much of the world. Revolutionary and other political opposition movements emerged in great numbers during these decades, and many groups have used terrorist tactics in attempts to overturn governments, pursue their own nationalist agendas, or promote other political interests. Some examples include: •\n\nThe Stern Gang/Irgun/Lehi (Israel).\n\n•\n\nThe Mau-Mau (Kenya).\n\n•\n\nNational Liberation Front, or FLN (Algeria).\n\n•\n\nAfrican National Congress (South Africa).\n\n•\n\nManuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front— Autonomous, or FPMR/A (Chile).\n\n•\n\nProvisional Irish Republican Army (Northern Ireland).\n\n•\n\nWeather Underground (United States).\n\n•\n\nBaader-Meinhof Gang—Red Army Faction, or RAF (Germany).\n\nWHAT TERRORISTS BELIEVE 51\n\n•\n\nAction Direct (France).\n\n•\n\nDev Sol (Turkey).\n\nUnchecked Governmental (aka Establishmental) Terrorism Some state governments have used their own law enforcement or intelligence organizations to act as terrorist groups against their own people or against foreign dissidents. This is called governmental, or establishmental, terrorism. Some historical examples include: •\n\nLibyan intelligence.\n\n•\n\nNorth Korean intelligence.\n\n•\n\nIran’s Revolutionary Guards.\n\n•\n\nThe former Soviet Union’s KGB.\n\n•\n\nMao’s Red Guards in China.\n\n•\n\nIraq’s Fedayeen Saddam.\n\nKey Points • A person who conducts an act of terrorism at any time is a terrorist. • Captured terrorists are not political prisoners; they are criminals. Justice for their acts falls under criminal laws. • Terrorists are not lawful combatants in war. They are unlawful combatants. • Removing or suspending civil liberties, stifling freedom of speech, or using counterterrorism as a political tool gives terrorists an absolute victory.\n\nIt is the conscious decision to use terrorist acts, target innocent victims, operate with criminal intent, and act as a secretive organization that transforms law-abiding citizens into terrorists.\n\nThe Rise of Modern Islamic Extremism Contrary to many popular images, Islamic fundamentalism is not a category of terrorism; it is simply a religious classification. Terrorists who may be fundamentalist in their beliefs are best referred to as Islamic\n\n52\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\nextremists. However—and unfortunately for the image of Islam—Islamic extremist groups have frequently adopted terrorist tactics in order to gain attention and support for their political and religious platforms. After monarchies, socialist governments, and military administrations assumed political control of many majority Muslim nations (mainly since the end of World War II), some extremist religious groups began resorting to assassinations, bombings, and kidnappings to fight what they perceive as unholy and exploitive regimes. Events that have encouraged Islamic extremism to spread include the following: Siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca: In 1979, a multinational group of armed Sunni Muslim militants seized control of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, to protest the royal family’s perceived lack of adherence to Islamic principles and to install a man they believed was the “Mahdi,” a prophesized savior. The group allegedly included the brother of Osama bin Laden and infiltrated in bin Laden construction trucks. Iranian hostage crisis: After the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran and with the encouragement of the Ayatollah Khomeini, religious students seized the American embassy in Tehran. The Iranian government eventually took responsibility for the hostage taking and held 55 Americans for 444 days in protest of the United States’ ongoing support for the exiled Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, who was perceived by many as a corrupt dictator. Iran quickly became a major sponsor of Islamic extremist terrorism worldwide after this event. Anti-U.S. terrorism in Lebanon: Members of Hezbollah (“Party of God”) in Lebanon and its action arm, Islamic Jihad Organization (IJO), carried out suicide bombings against the U.S. Marine barracks and two American embassies in Beirut, killing more than 250 Americans. They also conducted numerous skyjackings and a massive kidnapping campaign designed to force the United States out of Lebanon, seizing more than 75 Westerners residing in that country. The United States’ secret payments of weapons to Iran as ransom for the release of these hostages later emerged as the Iran-Contra Affair. Russian invasion of Afghanistan: Russia’s invasion of\n\nWHAT TERRORISTS BELIEVE 53\n\nAfghanistan during the 1980s and its eventual defeat helped catalyze the rise of Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda organization. These former anti-Russian “holy warriors” were drawn from the thousands of Muslim volunteers who had been recruited to fight the Russians with Pakistani, Saudi Arabian, and American support. Known as Afghan-Arabs, postwar terrorists now claim they are fighting to protest U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and America’s military presence in Saudi Arabia, and to promote the liberation of Palestine and the establishment of Islamic states throughout the Muslim world. Al-Qaeda carried out numerous deadly bombings against American targets in the 1990s and killed more than three thousand people. Dozens of sister organizations, started by former Afghan-Arab veterans and inspired or financed by al-Qaeda, have sprung up throughout the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Central Asia. The Palestinian Intifada (1987 to 1993, 1999 to present): A spontaneous popular uprising of Palestinians living in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip against the Israeli army occurred between 1987 and 1993 and again in 1999. This uprising or Intifada (in Arabic) occurred when Palestinians rebelled against the conditions of their occupation and started open combat against the Israeli army. The rebellion inspired many supporters throughout the Middle East to contribute money and political clout in achieving a negotiated settlement for the Palestinian people. This effort culminated with the return of Yasser Arafat to the West Bank and appeared to be on the fast track toward a comprehensive solution. In 2000, however, Palestinian negotiators broke off talks, and a visit by Israeli politician Ariel Sharon to the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem set off the second Intifada. This Intifada quickly turned into a war of personalities between Arafat and Sharon. Its most significant feature has been the Israeli focus on destroying Arafat and the PLO, which allowed the more violent Palestinian extremist movements to fill the void. The extremists took the opportunity to perfect suicide bombing against the Israelis within Israel. In 2000, only one suicide attack occurred in Israel. But in 2001, the extremist Iranian-backed Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad Organizations, as well as the new FATAH splinter group the al-Aqsa Martyr’s Brigade, started a\n\n54\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\nsuicide bombing campaign that saw eighty-eight attacks. In 2002, as Israeli military action in Palestine increased, so did the suicide attacks with almost one hundred fifty occurring mainly inside of Israel. The Palestinian cause has become the food of rhetoric for many Islamic terrorist groups and Arab governments. The U.S. Invasion of Iraq (2003 to present): The American-led invasion to quickly topple the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was a stunning success initially but quickly ignited an entire new generation of global Islamic extremist terrorism. In a serious intelligence-failure, the originally stated objective of U.S. forces finding weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) that were feared would be given to al-Qaeda were never found. Apparently Hussein was truthful to the United Nations weapons inspectors when he admitted he ordered them destroyed in the 1990s. Additionally, the fears that Hussein was in league with al-Qaeda were not based on any verifiable intelligence. The fighting in the initial invasion was short and brutal, leaving over 6,000 Iraqi soldiers and almost 200 coalition troops dead. Protests from the global community as well as many nations in the Muslim world, coupled with the Iraqi Ba'athists and religious extremists to fight a post-invasion occupation with a wide-spread insurgency. The invasion of Iraq had the effect of galvanizing Islamic extremists, Iraqi nationalists and American occupation-rejectionists to come from all parts of the world and fight as terrorists in Iraq. The invasion and occupation has drawn the United States into a terrorism-based regional conflict that has lasted over five years, cost almost one trillion dollars and appears to have no end in sight.

For example, criminal organizations and drug traffickers in Colombia and Chechnya have pioneered the mass subcontracting of amateur terrorists to conduct abductions and other acts of terrorism that can earn a given group millions of dollars in ransoms and protection rackets, and fund other terrorist acts. Availability of Weapons of Mass Destruction Weapons of mass destruction (WMD), largely the domain of governments until recent years, have become attractive to terrorists for their ability to create largescale fear and panic. Biological weapons: The 2001 anthrax attack on the U.S. Senate proved more frightening than destructive. The media coverage surrounding the contamination of the Senate office buildings and the unfortunate deaths of several victims created a perfect storm of rumor and panic. However, a truly fearful prospect would be the release of highly fatal viruses such as smallpox. The smallpox virus can be released and spread among millions of people before it is detected, since its incubation period is approximately two weeks. A U.S. government exercise that simulated a terrorist release of smallpox showed that more than three million people could die within thirty to sixty days of the appearance of the first incidence. The usage of a human-deployed biological weapons system (HUMANBIOWEP; see Chapter 12)— a suicide operative deliberately infected with diseases such as smallpox—is the most viable terrorist weapon and far more attainable than a nuclear weapon. Chemical weapons: The first large-scale, modern-day terrorist use of chemical WMD was carried out in 1993 by Aum Shinrikyo, a religious-cult-turned-terrorist group in Japan. The group manufactured Sarin nerve gas and distributed it on several occasions. These weapons give terrorist groups the capability to create large numbers of casualties with generally unsophisticated technology. Nuclear and radioactive weapons: Much attention has been focused on the possibility of a nuclear bomb being sought after by terrorists. Neither nuclear nor explo-\n\n56\n\nPART ONE: KNOW THE TERRORIST\n\nsively dispersed radiological devices (called dirty bombs) have been used in a major terrorist attack to date, but dozens of attempts to acquire radioactive material have been documented worldwide since the 1970s. Ideologies Terrorists Espouse When it comes to justifying terrorist violence with a certain ideology, the human imagination knows no boundaries. An ideology is a set of values or principles— a belief system—that may motivate people to act. Most political and religious ideologies are, at their core, based on noble ideas, but, as we see far too often, they can become twisted to serve the ambitions of a few and take on violent tendencies. Other ideologies, such as white supremacy, are based on hate and fear, and actually espouse, at their core, the use of violence as the desired means to an end. People who carry out acts of terrorism invariably claim they are acting in the name of a religious, political, philosophical, or other type of cause. It is important to understand the particular ideology claimed by a terrorist group, in order to better predict its targets and methodologies. Following is a partial list of political, religious, and other ideologies that have been used by terrorist organizations to justify their violent actions. Political and Policy-Based Ideologies\n\nPeruvian Communist Party poster.\n\nMarxist-Leninist communism: The main objective of this political model is worker ownership of the means of production, resulting from the overthrow (violent, if necessary) of the bourgeois class. Theoretically, such a revolution would produce a classless society. Historical enemies of communists are the property-owning class and the state systems that keep the “owners” in power, including politicians, military, and police. Some current terrorist groups with communist roots include the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA, or Shining Path) of\n\nWHAT TERRORISTS BELIEVE 57\n\nPeru, which has attempted to replace Peru’s government with a revolutionary Marxist regime, and the Red Brigade of Italy, which attacked the Italian government and businesses in an attempt to remove Italy from the Western Alliance and punish Italian participation in NATO. Thought to be defunct after 1991, the Red Brigade (with new, younger adherents) is believed to have resumed operations in Italy in 2002. Stalinist communism: The key feature of Stalin’s attempts at furthering a socialist revolution was the creation of a one-party state (and the consequently brutal suppression of opposition). The underlying result of Stalinism was the lack of workers’ rights; dictatorial rule through a cult of personality; and the distortion of history. Whereas Marx stressed the idea of a proletariat revolution from below, Stalinism emphasized strict implementation of socialism from the top down. In the Soviet Union, this ideology resulted in a classic example of state-run terror campaigns. Some mafia and old-guard Russian groups, who have used terrorism as a localized tool, still believe Stalinism is the best system for Russia today. Maoist communism: Maoism is a Chinese variant on Marxism. It stresses cultural characteristics (such as strong family ties), unceasing class struggle, and constant party oversight. Mao Tse-tung also advocated the use of terrorist campaigns against counterrevolutionaries. Ideologically, Mao adapted Marxism to apply to the peasant masses, rather than the working classes of Europe; and today, many peasant revolutionary terrorist groups throughout Asia and Latin America stem from Maoist-type philosophies rather than those of Marxism, because their origins are more rural than urban. Castro and Guevarist communism: The communism of Fidel Castro (and his deputy Che Guevara) has been based since the 1950s on the Marxist-Leninist model. Its major chara"
