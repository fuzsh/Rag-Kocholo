        "text": "An engineering geological evaluation for renewable low-head hydroelectric, solar and wind energy across the Jamuna (Brahmaputra) River at Sariakandi-Pakuria Section, Bangladesh Mir Fazlul Karima, Nazre Sobhanb, Md. Zillur Rahmanc a GeoEastern Inc., 700, Massachusetts Ave., Boxborough, MA 01719, USA b Independent Consultant, 7 Phyllis Frost St, Forde, ACT 2914, Australia c Department of Disaster Science and Management, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh Corresponding author, Mir Fazlul Karima Email: mfkarimazad@gmail.com ICEEST use only: Received Date here, revised date here, Accepted Date here Keyword: renewable energy, electricity, geo-engineering, low-head hydroelectric dam, Abstract The demand for electricity in Bangladesh has been projected to reach 34 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. This study identifies that Bangladesh is rich in water resources and an intelligent and operative river water management can increase power generation to meet the expected demand. Construction of multipurpose geo-structures for low-head hydroelectric power generation is identified as an alternative renewable energy sources to meet the future energy demand of the country and green infrastructure development plans. Present engineering geological and geomorphological research recognizes several locations along the Jamuna (Brahmaputra) River where enormous amount of clean energy can be harnessed by constructing multipurpose mega geo-structures. The Sariakandi-Pakuria Section of the river is considered to be one of the best and advantageous locations for such structure and a detailed study is accomplished thereby. The study includes digital remote sensing analysis of water intensity, discharge volume and temporal stability pattern of the banks for last 34 years. The slope and gradient pattern analysis along and across the river for possible design of dam, sluice gates and navigation options are done. The maximum ground elevation in the proposed area is measured to be 23 m and the lower elevation is less than 10 m while the bank-slopes vary between 3.5% and 8% with elevation difference between 15 m and 23 m. The unique geomorphology of the river will aid in constructing a multipurpose 1200 sq. km lake. A conceptual geo-structural design of the low-head hydroelectric dam is proposed and presented in this paper. Given the ground conditions, dynamicity and openness of the river course, it is also contemplated for installation of anchored multi-megawatt solar energy panels and mounting of numerous wind turbines to capture wind energy covering a large area over the common infrastructures. A thumb-rule estimation indicates that a combined low-head hydroelectric, solar and wind power generation system across the selected river section will add more than 1000 MW of electricity to the national grid of Bangladesh. A geo-engineering methodology is proposed in this paper for further studies.\n\nThe report’s main focus is on the study of Lower Mardi River Hydropower project for its feasibility analysis; the works included in this report are hydrological study, survey, development of contour maps of the site. The Mardi River is located in the Kaski district with catchment of 97.2 km2 at the point where preliminary location of head works is fixed. Lower Mardi River hydropower project has installed capacity of 2.61MW. Additionally, the flood analysis of river has been carried out with different methods so as to make the proposed weir capable of passing the flood discharge without any structural damage to the components of the hydropower. The flood discharge of approximately for a return period of 100 years has been calculated from Modified Dicken’s method. This report also includes the result of the survey works carried out in the project site. The survey data has been represented as the topographic map of the area of dam, power house and the probable alignment route of canal and penstock. On the second part of the project, design of components like: weir, headrace canal, sand trap, connecting channel, forebay, penstock, spillway, anchor blocks, turbine, powerhouse and tailrace. Weir was designed as Tyrolean weir with height of weir 5.5 m. The connecting canal of 100mlong supplies water to sand trap. Sand trap was of dimension179*5.7*6.9m .The sand trap and forebay were connected with canal of width 4m and 800m long. Spillway was designed in forebay and sand trap to discharge the excess of water. The forebay was 62.5 in length and 8.5m in depth. Then finally penstock was 200m long with diameter of 2.10m. The total cost of project was found to be NRs574.78 million, IRR 13.4 , B/C ratio 1.13 and payback period 8.24 years.\n\nIn this work we summarized the all the concepts of hydropower plants dams as well as all hydropower plants. Introduction There are many ways to generate electricity in modern day. One of them is to use the gravitational force of falling water, which is also known as hydroelectricity. Hydroelectricity occurs in a dam, where the falling water is used to generate enough force to turn a turbine that is connected to an electricity generator. With this action, potential energy of water is transformed into mechanical energy and then into electrical energy. This is both an efficient and green way of generating electricity: it is not as hard as the geothermal electricity because people do not have to find a perfect area to generate it; and it is also not as polluting as the nuclear power plants are. Therefore, hydroelectricity is much greener than the nuclear power plants which generate electricity, and much easier to generate than the geothermal electricity, where it is economically attractive, provides security of supply and has low levels of COR 2 Remissions Hydropower has been using in thirty country worldwide and its production is estimated at 1/5 total global production with 90% efficiency. The greatest benefit from the hydropower program is the abundant low-cost energy the projects contribute to electric power grids. Because hydroelectric power plants burn no fuel, operating costs are low and are immune to rising fossil fuel prices, when construction costs were low. As a result, these plants are playing a significant role in keeping electricity costs affordable for consumers, creating a positive impact on the economy. Not only, but a dams which use to produce energy also used to irrigation and keep water to expected drought periods. So hydropower is considered a major renewable energy where it just produce through magnetic induction, the generator converts the mechanical energy of the turbines to electricity. In Sudan there's 92% primary energy consumption comes from fossil fuels and 8% from hydropower. However, the current installed capacity is about 60% of hydropower. The country is making efforts to integrate more renewable energy resources and seeks 11% of renewable electricity generation except hydropower by 2031. Sudan has also adopted a national energy efficiency plan in 2012 and has set cumulative energy efficiency targets of 11.8% and seeks 32% by 2020[1, 2, and 3] Classification of Hydropower Plants According to Capacity Hydropower plants classified according its capacity to six types large, medium, small, mini, micro, pico and will be discuss below in details [4]. 1. Large hydropower plants: >100 MW 2. Medium hydropower plants: 25-100 MW 3. Small: 1-25 MW\n\nAlthough Ethiopia possesses a huge hydropower potential, the energy problem in the country is enormous. A great majority of the population in Ethiopia are dependent on traditional resources to fulfill their energy needs. Due to the poor energy supply, the people not only have to put up with an unattractive living environment but also suffer the consequences of climatic change caused by the associated environmental impacts. Numerous villages do not get electricity supply due to the scattered nature of the settlements. Therefore, the energy policy should give enough attention to decentralized systems in which small hydropower potential plays a significant role. This study considers some of the small hydropower sites in the Abbay basin and that the selection of optimum sites or the optimum level of development at the sites can be undertaken with the application of non-linear optimization techniques. The optimization has been conducted on the basis of four theoretical small hydropower s..."
