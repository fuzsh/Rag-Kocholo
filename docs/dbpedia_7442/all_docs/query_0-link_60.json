        "text": "Water as an inevitable human need has encountered many problems during the last decades. One of these problems is water pollution. In recent years, water quality has been reduced in Karaj watershed as the most important source of drinking water in Tehran and surrounding areas. In the present study, three sub-watersheds were selected at the upper, middle and lower section of the main river of Karaj watershed called Varangeh Rud, Doab and Varian. In order to estimate and compare their pollution potential, two different methods including risk assessment (as a scientific method) and organizing (as an experimental-practical method) methods were applied. Out of the several risk assessment methods, only the WRASTIC Index method was used to estimate the risk of surface water sources pollution, particularly dams, and to weight the 7 main parameters of water pollution. Organizing method, in turn, involves several methods including ecological capacity assessment using GIS to determine the prop...\n\nIn this paper a detailed account of the Kabul River has been given to highlight its socio-economic importance and point out associated environmental problems. To identify income generating activities in Pakistan field visits were conducted and people in the business were interviewed which was supplemented by secondary data. The present riparian uses include drinking, washing, bathing and also feeding it to livestock. Water quality is deteriorated by two means i.e. decrease water quantity and discharge of municipal and industrial effluents. Due to a small industrial base Afghanistan does not deteriorate water quality of the river but had constructed seven dams on Kabul River and its tributaries. Two dams are used for irrigating the Kabul and Nangarhar provinces. Pakistan had constructed one dam on main Kabul River (Warsak Dam), irrigating Peshawar, Nowshera and Charsada districts and five dams on its tributaries. If all the dams in Afghanistan become functional it may affect water qu...\n\nWater pollution is the most important tasks facing all countries in the world to obtain suitable water for municipal, industrial, and agricultural uses. This study concerns with the effect of Bagdad city waste water on pollution and quality of Tigris River water using index of Aquifer water quality (IAWQ). The accuracy of chemical analyses of the selected water samples are conduced according to world standards of health classifications. Results of these analysis show that only two types of the 13 th tested sample are (certain) ,while the other patterns (models)are of the (probable certain). Cluster analysis is applied to evaluate the studied water characteristic. The results of the cluster analysis show the presence of three varying groups in their impact on their chemical properties on water .According to the cluster analysis and permissible limits of the variables, three chemical variables cadmium, lead, and calcium are selected to indicate its impact on the studied area. It is fo...\n\nThe present study was carried out to measure the physico-chemical variables of surface water of the Meghna River from September 2015 to March 2016. Air temperature, water temperature, soil pH, water pH, DO, BOD 5 , COD, TSS, TDS, PO 4-P, NO 3-N and EC concentrations in water samples were found to range from 14-29°C, 11-28°C, 5.9-6.9, 7.2-7.5, 4.2-6.71 mg/L, 0.67-3.71 mg/L, 2.5-5.9 mg/L, 8-20 mg/L, 72-130 mg/L, 0.11-0.90 µg/l, 0.115-0.90 µg/l and 115.8-220 µScm-1 respectively. River Pollution Index (RPI) indicated that the water of river at impacted site was less to moderately polluted. Unimpacted site was also less polluted as per RPI and mostly used for agriculture. Correlation Matrix (CM) and Multivariate statistical analyses namely Cluster Analysis (CA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factors Analysis (FA) indicated that river water was polluted. The principal causes of the pollution of the river were haphazard industrialization, domestic sewage and agricultural inputs. Using of river water can pose serious problems to human health by biological food chain. This research suggests to proper management of the river with eco-friendly industrialization and urbanization for sustainable development of the country."
