        "text": "Diary of an Aid Worker\n\nAdventure to Kabul January 2004\n\nToday the world is white! Snow is falling and this part of the world is beautiful.\n\nLanding in Kabul through thinning cloud produced a landscape of brown and white. Snow drifts piled against buildings uniform in their drabness of the city much larger than I expected. It has some 2 million residents, 30 000 taxi’s, 200 000 cars and zillions of bicycles! Twisted aircraft wreckage lines the runway and it was with some apprehension that I stood in line to confront the fierce olive fatigued immigration officials. Certainly I did not expect the smile that greeted my announcement that I had no Visa, nor the friendliness of the driver that brought me here to my home for the next while.\n\nThe Great Masud road leaves the airport, a double lane highway along which you rocket at speeds constrained only by the fearlessness of the driver. Lanes don’t exist and where necessary the other side of the road becomes additional lanes. On one side, a single row of shops in various state of ruin run alongside the road with cultivated fields behind them. The other side has more elaborate structures long abandoned by groups such as Hoechst. There are obvious signs of repair with beautiful stone walls, interspersed with high security compounds. Unexpected colour from massive brightly painted trucks. Works of art in this mono chromatic landscape, laden with goods from Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Iran.\n\nThe UNOPS offices are in a run down apartment block. Inside, they have been renovated providing comfort enough when the electricity is working, but outside they look appalling. There is a new compound being built, the first phase of which will be ready for occupation in a few weeks. This will not include me as I take up responsibility for the rehabilitation of the University woman’s residence building. Well, that’s today’s story! From this table I can see children skating on the ice, and a few hardy people are flying kites. A landmark I was told I would find here.\n\nThe UNDP guest house (where I will stay this week) is a massive house, built on four levels with marble floors, chandeliers, a sweeping staircase and décor that jars my every sense. My room is comfortable, too hot with the heater and freezing without it, but there is a common lounge and dining room looking out to the garden.\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul 02\n\nFierce warriors on horse back, tassels at their waist, Cossack style trousers and boots, turbans giving them extra height. An incredible sight as they rode in front of the vehicle taking me home. With the donkey carts, hand pushed carts and men, all with the most amazing features, walking down the roads piles of nan (bread) across their arms I am not going to be short of things to paint!\n\nI have declared a ‘Jihad’ on mud. Keeping clean is a serious mission, and that doesn’t take my ability to get dirty as I dress into account! It seems to be everywhere and manages to work its way onto all my clothes. The colour of the toilet paper is hilarious. Bright strawberry milkshake is the closest I can get. I’m sure I can make a fortune out of selling it to parts of Pretoria!\n\nWoke up to the sound of the Mullah. Took me awhile to work out what the noise was and after that I could lie back and enjoy the strange specialness of it all. This was my first morning with no power at the house. Cold wash with a facecloth at the basin and a scrape type shave. Not the best, but they got it back on in time to have a hot cup of tea before I left. There was ice in the car park and I went whizzing across it, even in my boots, such fun! Didn’t even land on my bum!\n\nAt the PX (Military supply store) they quiet a good selection of wine. I have been drinking everyone else’s, so it was great to be able to put something on the table.\n\nI went across to the University hostel and became more despondent the more I walked around and thought about it. However, it’s actually not so bad. No floors collapsed and most of it is very good structurally. All I could think about was the state of this single, small, relatively insignificant building, in relation to the state of the country and the awesome magnitude of fixing that! But it was the condition of the other building, which is still in use that really got to me. The conditions are terrible. Much worse than anything I experienced in the townships back home. It reminds me of a prison in a really bad part of the world (which I guess this is!) and I have yet to experience the slums and don’t want to know what the prison conditions are like! The students are cooking in their rooms and outside over open fires, which doesn’t do much to increase the appeal of the place.\n\nI am trying to ensure that energy efficient planting takes place as part of the refurbishment program and gardens that include herbs and veggies that they can use in the kitchen are incorporated. Water runoff from the roof is collected for use and silly things like that. Time line: Three months, quiet a challenge!\n\nIn the ‘Bookseller of Kabul’ (I am hoping to go into town with Karen on Friday) she talks about the body smell, of smoke, fat and accumulated dirt of the people in Kabul. She is so right! Volleyball is big out here and there is a court next to the office building. They also play cricket and soccer outside on the tennis courts.\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul 03\n\n13 January 2004\n\nA taxi passed us in one of the winding roads leading into town. Suspension , or lack there of, groaning over the rutted road. The multicoloured neon light around the number plate, carefully cleaned of the mud that covered the lower half of the car. As we drew alongside I was able to look down from the Landcruiser’s high vantage point into the car, where the back, from seat to roof, was filled with the dripping carcasses of sheep. Amazing!\n\nReinforced concrete emplacements stand beside ancient stone and mud fortifications, the principles of holding the heights constant throughout the centuries of conflict that have ravaged this part of the world. I walked across the hill behind the guesthouse with Karen , Jenny and Loya, spiraling up through the last patches of snow. Houses, built above the ruins that covers most of the lower slopes, cling to the hillside a vertical continuation of the mud that lies thickly underfoot. Signs of reconstruction are everywhere. Men break the mountains rocks by hand for foundations, poles lean against walls ready to take new roofs. Graveyards are freshly tendered and the hillside freshly terraced and planted with saplings. All along the walk kids wave a shout in greeting, ‘howareyou?’ the most commonly known English words. Loya, being a large well cared for dog, is the object of much apprehension and the two blond woman, fascination. The walk was an unexpected treat as I had thought that we would be confined to the guest house premises for security reasons.\n\nAn afternoon of indulgence admiring the beautiful carpets of Afghanistan in a small dealer off Chicken Street. Kids scamper up the stacks of carpets; “you like?” from the consummate salesman as another treasure is added to the covering on the floor, a glowing rich red sea. Crossing the road to the local supermarket requires a fair amount of courage having spent five days observing the maniacal drivers of Kabul. The variety of goods is surprising with unexpected luxuries such as Toblerone.\n\nThe sun came out for a brief moment to provide a spectacular sunrise. My painting I am less sure of. It is small (A5) size, and I am using acrylics for the first time in years which has certain challenges of it’s own. And that’s without the cold, or rapid drying from the heating! I tried to impart the strength of the Buskazshi mounted warriors as a contrast to the power in the blue Burqua covered woman. Again I used my hands and no brushes to keep the painting simple. Sure do miss the light levels at home and the brilliantly light apartment in New York.\n\nIt looks as though I am becoming the dumping ground for all the problem projects, which is fantastic!\n\nFeel a bit like the song in Evita; “Another suitcase in another hall …..”. I have moved to an outside room at Gary’s (my boss) house. It has a huge double bed, massive wooden headboard, with four walls around it. Also, I have moved my office across the hall to where I have a bit more space. The dirt, and mess, in this new office has been appalling, but I have most of it sorted. At least I have a window out onto a few trees and then the next apartment/office block. With the sun shining, the balconies are filled with people.\n\nThe sun brought out a whole new side of Kabul. The high Paghman mountains glistening white against the blue sky. An old fortification on the hill dominating the skyline. Now I need to get the driver to stop long enough to take pictures!\n\nI know I should expect it, but its still a shock to be walking along and have water, plus whatever was in it, come splashing down on you from an apartment above you. The logic escapes me totally.\n\nA culture shock moving into the new place. From an organized guest house, to what is essentially a bachelor house. The house reminds me of the farm houses in Tasmania and Mossel Bay. Charming in its quirkiness, a dumping ground for people that are crazy busy. A place that is meant to be used at night where carpets shimmer in soft candle light.\n\nI have found a heater, put a couple more blankets on the bed and will use the floor as my workspace, as there is no room for a table. I will need to find a lamp as it’s all quiet dark.\n\nThe bathroom is crazy with toilet, shower and basin all in a tiny area and the water sloshes across the floor to a drain hole in the corner. By turning the gas heater into the door way five minutes before you use it, you don’t freeze totally.\n\nA domestic evening, washing and then struggling to get stuff dry. The place looked like a Chinese laundry! Started on my next painting amongst this. The floor works pretty well although I am going to need one of those Afghan dress things the men wear to keep my cloths free of paint.\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul 04\n\nIn the thick of morning rush-hour, amongst the ‘Kabul sea mist’, as the smog is referred to, an old man grasps the handle of an improvised broom made from twigs and hunched over, sweeps the sand from the middle of the intersection.\n\nMy latest job is auditing the design and specs. of the water and sewerage on a World Bank job. Seriously exciting it is not. Oh well, the joys of being a ‘Brain Prostitute’.\n\nOne of the things I am learning slowly, painfully, is that doorways tend to be on the low side in Kabul. This ranges from those that are only just tall enough to others that are plain ridiculous. One would expect that after the first few times I would remember, however, like many things I seems to take me awhile.\n\nThursday night is week unwind night and Karen came across to Gary’s house for a drink after work. I managed to organize a smidgen of smoked salmon and hunted high and low for avocado’s (before finding a whole box of them going rotten in Gary’s pantry on Saturday!), but with cheese and a fantastic Aussie red wine we managed a very tasteful dinner.\n\nBeyond the plastic sunflowers and garlands of orchids that line Flower Street, a basic room furnished with a table, a charcoal brazier and a chair for patrons, a florist spins fifteen (he insists it is the only possible number that can be used) orange roses into a bouquet of beauty. Not the long stemmed roses of a hothouse, but the crooked, slightly deformed ones that come from a garden rose bush. Certainly another wonderful surprise of Kabul, and my apprehensive navigation back to Gary’s house by foot, in the rain and mud, was brightened considerably by the flowers in my hand. They also meant that I was stopped a million times by people wanting to know what I was doing walking around in seemingly endless circles with a bunch of roses!\n\nIt was great to get out and walk a bit after a day of painting. I completed two paintings, ‘Mountains of Kabul’ and the ‘Nan Seller’ and I am starting to worry about running out of canvases. Ahmed gave me a lift to Flower Street and the driver assured me it was a simple walk home. He was correct, and I will walk into town in future, and hopefully get to appreciate a bit of life in Kabul.\n\nKaren’s birthday dinner on Friday night was spectacular. A table spread with a feast which has put back at least two of the five kilo’s I lost this week! Beef Wellington, succulent lamb, roast chicken, piles of rich green broccoli and a platter of salad. Wedges of yellow corn vivid next to the red tomatoes and green cucumber. The amount of wine meant that I was fighting wine monsters and did not try to exercise this morning! The large contingent of Norwegians entertained us in song, but it was left to Bruce (Aussie from Brisbane) to bring our part of the evening to a climax with a poem, delivered with power and passion. The Nine thirty curfew arrived very quickly.\n\nThe clouds have lifted, leaving a clear view across to the mountains brilliant in their fresh covering of snow. As most people are off work today, there is very little pollution and the air is crisp and fresh.\n\nI have been awake since four. Couldn’t do much because there was no electricity, all very dark. Seriously frustrating! Went for a walk in Gary’s garden and looked at the sky filled with stars, beautiful but cold!\n\nOn the way home, stopped at the corner of the street to buy Nan bread and then in the market for Bar B’Q chicken. I wanted to make sure there was some dinner as I had run out of naartjies. Gary is back from Dubai and we sat around the table to eat, first time.\n\nManaged to get out this morning which was fantastic. It was daylight! Didn’t realise that every morning and evening I was driving through a huge open market. The drive to the old house is about forty minutes, most of which is a huge bazaar. A drover with his goats crosses the street, vendors of every description, a man on a bicycle a multi coloured cloud of balloons billowing above him. Newspaper sellers at an intersection, wide friendly smiles daring you not to buy. Up through an area, the potters ‘Montmartre’ with twisting streets up the hill the lower section of the houses being used to hand pack massive pots, a small square children playing in the water from its central spout. Totally amazing.\n\nWalked out to sleet on my jacket! Haven’t hit my head for a few days, but that didn’t stop it from being rapped on the roof of the twin cab!\n\nA delegation of Iranians arrived at Gary’s for dinner last night. Food had been ordered in and there were a bunch from the office sorting it out. I didn’t have anything to do with the delegation as they are on the Disabled Program, which is not one of mine. But as at the dam, I made sure it all worked and sorted the mess making sure that all the elements flowed together. They seemed to enjoy it and Gary appreciate the effort. What was amazing were the bunches of Narcissus. The flowers were pale, but pretty, however, it was the scent they gave out that was incredible!\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul 05\n\n28th January 2004\n\nWoke to the sounds of a wounded Buffalo outside my window. Gary has decided to go on a fitness kick and he had the treadmill outside jogging at four am.\n\nI am officially tagged. Everyone here walks around with ID cards and flash card USB drives swinging from their necks. It’s partly to make sure you don’t loose them and have them at hand when you need them, but its also one of those ‘in’ things to have. Remember the calculator swinging from your belt, or the Leatherman at your waist and then the keys on a lanyard? Well now it’s the USB drive. Mine is red!\n\nFor some obscure reason, the birds are going crazy in the tree outside my window. In keeping with so much here, they are nondescript grey/mud brown things (Kabul Mud Warblers?), but the sound is incredibly good to hear.\n\nToo much red wine on Thursday evening and then having to finish the remnants of the wine left over from a dinner at the house the next day. Cleaned up the mess, put away what could be rescued and gave the rest to the dogs. Spent an indulgent day painting before going out to enjoy sporadic sunshine and take photographs. I’m still very nervous about where it’s inappropriate to take photos but I’m relaxing more and more. They love to see themselves on the video, which makes it quiet a bit easier. I was warned to watch out for pickpockets.\n\nOne of the reasons they don’t want us to walk around alone is the threat of abduction. In my case, there is a legitimate concern that I wont be able to navigate back to the house again! I wondered about taking photos and ended up in Chicken Street where I was abducted. One moment I was standing discretely taking pictures, and the next I was hauled into a room, forced to sit in a stool, drink copious quantities of green tea and suffer the agony of bargaining for beautiful carpets. Handing over the agreed to ransom I was allowed to leave with only two carpets which now cover the floor of my room. Perhaps I can use them for the new studio? Oh, well. I did get what I set out for, which was something I can use as a table cloth for cheese and biscuits. The carpet chap gave me a scarf, which will work fantastically.\n\nDinner at the home of Tony and Vesna. Vesna (a Bosnian) is a colleague I am working with and Tony (an Aussie) works on the DDR program with UNDP. There were a couple of us from the office and I enjoyed an interesting evening with seven different nationalities at dinner. I am very worried about my eating habits as I climbed into the eggplant and tomato bake and I don’t like those things!\n\nHave picked up responsibility for another couple of buildings. The Olympic stadium and one of the court house refurbishments that is in difficulty. More meetings, not my best, and freezing site visits, still fun despite the mud. Driving out to the MRRD site, it was incredible to see the contrast between the brown drab buildings and the white of the snow clad mountains.\n\nWalking through the newly refurbished offices at the Olympic Stadium building I had my first experience of the culture clash that I had been warned about. We haven’t finished the work, but the building has been in use continually with people moving into offices before the final details, (beading on windows, light switch covers, etc) are completed. In every office there is some kind of cooking going on. Vegetables are peeled, meat skewered and tea boiled, mostly over wood or diesel burning stoves. The residue coats the ceiling, dirty dishes are piled in the corner and slops are thrown out into the corridor. At least in the director’s office, on an exquisite carpet, a cupboard is used to divide this activity from the receptions and meetings! Wonder how long the renovations will last?\n\nIt’s a beautiful day, and I’ve been fortunate to spend most of it out and about. Had my first run in with a Mullah at the Supreme Court project, very unpleasant. Lunch at a small restaurant (also a first), behind a curtain in a back room as we had a woman (Sonja — the Head of the Building section) with us for fatty, dead mutton kebabs. Then a charge out to the University site for a meeting with the key UNOPS people and fortuitously the lady in charge of the project from USAID and the American Ambassador. I have been wondering around the site at random and it was pointed out that we have no confirmation that the site has been de-mined. Scary! Found a porcupine quill in the middle of one of the floors amongst all the mess, quite bazaar.\n\nThe security situation after the ISAF attacks is stable and we are on a dusk to dawn kind of curfew, which means no walking about and no driving about town. Quiet sad, as it is all beautiful and white after two days of snow. No popping out for croissants and hot chocolate either (I wish!), and there is the added concern about my red wine stock!\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul\n\nBack from an intense day with the World Bank assessment people. The process was very\n\nlong, compounded by no power and a bunch of staff that really aren’t concerned about the long-term issues. Still, for me, it was great and I enjoyed the challenge. Splitting headache from all the analysis!\n\nA gentle day with chores, painting and video’s. Brilliant sunshine and I managed a few hours sitting outside, wrapped up, and daydreaming. Not the same as being at the water, or in Central Park (my last two day dream locations) but I had a view up to the mountains and the fortress on the hill. Could be a whole lot worse!\n\nThe painting of the Balloon Man has come out well (I like it), gentle and ‘floaty’ as I had hoped for.\n\nA star filled sky and the moon smiling brightly. Crisp and clear, actually it’s very cold! A new preoccupation for me on this last day of January, the idea of spending a year (they may only offer an initial six months) here in Afghanistan and not merely the two months I came here for. I am not sure in what role they want me, and it will be interesting to see what eventually transpires. I will need to go off for a medical as the initial step of making the transition from a brain prostitute to contracted staff.\n\nSitting on the floor as we are confined to base for the next few days, my hands trace the magnificent patterns on the carpet that I was forced into getting. Wonder if I will ever learn to fly one!\n\nValentine Donkey has come out nicely. I was a bit concerned about the complexity of the painting after the simplicity of the Balloon Man, but it works.\n\nSpent the morning cleaning my room. Think it was some kind of acknowledgment that I might be here for more than five minutes and the dirty windows and general dirt kind of got to me. Susan made a Mexican mince dish last night, which was great. Beans and a packet mix with the mince. It was a great change and certainly warmed up my cold bones for a bit!\n\nGary’s 50th birthday. Security restrictions meant that the party was small, the seven house people and a couple from along the road plus our head of security. That didn’t stop Susan from cooking a turkey and a birthday cake. Eleven of us sat around enjoyed a great meal all of which was finished by half past six!\n\nFinished a painting of the Pagman Mountains. The few days of Eid al-Adha holiday, to celebrate the sacrifice of Isaac (haven’t quiet worked out why the Muslims should dedicate a holy day to Abraham?) left me lots of time to paint. I am now trying to organize more canvases from Dubai or New York as I have only one left.\n\nThings going bump in the night and a restless sleep after the radio all clear that no one is hurt. Rockets fired into the city at around nine but despite the loud bang they were quiet a way from us.\n\nOn the corner we pass a beggar sitting out in the cold with his begging bowl, feet tucked under him and the open sewer drain keeping him safe from passing traffic. The only difference between him and the biblical beggars is the smog that roles over him combined with the dust that eternally hangs over Kabul. Every morning I wonder what his story is and think back to the guy that dances at the Lion Park stop street.\n\nOff for my medical, injections and stuff!\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul 07\n\nIntense concentration etches premature lines into young faces. Clenched fists an indication of the tension. Rays of light burst from the middle of the circle of children, running across the grey dust that lies across the ground. Marbles. Who would have thought to find something so normal here in the ruins of post conflict Kabul.\n\nManaged to make an omelet for breakfast and after spending the day painting and sitting in the sun updating my five-year plan. To clear my head, I did a fast 5km on Gary’s treadmill before the electricity went down. Fantastic it was.\n\nTook advantage of being out at the dormitory site to visit the Fabled Babur Gardens. Perched on a hillside in western Kabul, the Babur Gardens were designed and built by Emperor Babur Shah, the founder of the Moghul Empire that ruled India some five hundred years ago. The gardens are slowly being restored, and as evident from the groups of people enjoying the sunshine, are being appreciated by the residents (males and children only!) of Kabul. The restored summer pavilion of Amir Abdur Rahman, (a restaurant?), stands empty; a casualty of the poor economy. Alongside the small marble mosque where Babur is buried, which is being restored, stands an ancient tree. It’s single limb carefully supported by an elaborate scaffold, a symbol of the reconstruction of Afghanistan?\n\nFollowing the ridge of the hill, the remains of the dragon-sprawling ancient city walls of Kabul, built 4 000 years ago, on Kohe Sher Darwaza (Lion’s Gate) can be seen. Below it stands the Column of Knowledge and Ignorance by the Kabul River. I will try and get pictures another day, as my camera battery ran out.\n\nThere are worse ways to start a day than driving around the city proudly showing of its white winter coat. Traffic is chaotic and much of the days schedule will need to be changed to accommodate the weather. Standing under sunny skies yesterday it was hard to imagine the contractors concern about time lines that did not allow for weather. This morning, the world is white, had to smile. Something magical about walking into a warm room, smelling freshly brewed coffee and seeing a white world outside.\n\nHeaviest snow falls in ten years and my Afghan engineers are not happy with me as I took every opportunity to play in the snow. No snowballs or snowmen, (the kids are doing that), but this kid, unashamedly spent the day cavorting around on the pretext of inspecting work. As such inspections reveal all sorts of issues to be solved, from insulation to drainage, I haven’t wasted the day, but it has been fun! I was reduced to painting by the light of my small torch when the power went out at seven.\n\nLunch of ‘Bulani’, a pancake type thing, with a filling of spinach and potato, cooked alongside the road on a handcart. Tasty, if a trifle too greasy for me. They didn’t have a clue about cinnamon sugar!\n\nA clear cold night has turned the slush into ice patches that wait at every turn for unwary feet. Especially those that come home late after a pile of beers! Mark (the Kiwi) left to get married, which meant that we had a serious meeting. Met a couple of interesting people from other agencies who had spent time in New York and South Africa at various times. A Japanese type lady and a ‘girl’ (twenty four) from Bosnia. Driving home in the snow and ice was heart stopping, but our driver did a sterling task and we only got stuck once in the 250 meters to the house. I did manage to kick the top off my toe in the bathroom.\n\nNot going to go back to the German hospital again. They took more blood as they had forgotten to do my blood type last week. Brave I was, and still no sucker from the sister! They have things to learn in this part of the world.\n\nSitting in the Minister for Higher education’s office, I found it difficult to concentrate on the conversation and protocol required, being distracted by the magnificent carpet under my feet. Much larger, and older, than anything I have seen before, it’s richness begged for hands to touch it and the eye follow the patterns as they whirled into infinity. Stunning!\n\nLatest painting, Afghan Girl.\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul 08\n\nBack from a trip up TV hill, one of the larger mountains in the center of the city. Mud huts cling to the side, which in another country (economy) would be impossibly expensive ski chalets. The snow and ice made for a tricky accent up the switchbacks, without any such luxuries as guardrails. From the top you could see 360-degree views of Kabul, cradled in the palm of white clad mountains. Almost like my painting!\n\nSitting on the floor in my room (Smarties from the PX, made in Malaysia, a real treat) enjoying the sunshine slanting in through the window bringing the rich colours of the carpet to life. Through the window the avenue of pine trees leads the eye out to the slopes of TV hill, covered in snow. The sky, a pale blue backdrop.\n\nKaren came around to the house with Peter (the Pirate) after their meeting and the six of us had a riotous evening sitting at the table. It was very good to see her, haven’t done that for ages. Certainly we did our best to emulate Frank Sinatra’s words “Laugh the dark clouds away.” Susan made a chilly cancarne, which they kept mild for whimps like me, washed down with a fabulous Spanish Roja. Can’t believe how quickly curfew time arrived.\n\nStill locked down, confined to the house, so no walking or visiting. Such a pity in such glorious weather. Did my washing and sat out on the patio with my book, and a beer in the sun. Not quiet Verbier! Did a small picture of a Zebra for the short story I am bashing together.\n\nI had a fascinating meeting with the Chancellor of the University. We were served green tea and plates of nuts, raisins and almond nuts covered with white hundreds and thousand type things. He had a clock in the office, something I missed having in New York and again here. Of course, massive red carpets from wall to wall. He had the most amazing storytellers voice, which he made full use of in telling us about the history of the University and his plans.\n\nA fleet of cars from the main mosque passed us on our way out, covered in plastic flowers, streamers and banners. Apparently they are returning Hajj pilgrims from Mecca. Don’t know whether it’s their families celebrating or the pilgrims.\n\nVisiting the post office in the city centre was amazing. Thousands of people swarm across the streets as the pavements are covered with slick ice making them impassible, a traffic nightmare. Passing between ancient wooden post boxes, through a heavy material drape you find the parcel section. Thanks goodness I had Bruce’s translator with me and a UN ID card, a passport for anything here.\n\nDelving through the archives of the University Library I feel like an explorer uncovering layers of a past that has been hidden from the world for 20 years. No great shakes in the history of mans ability to make a total stuff up of things, but still mind-boggling. You just have to remember to keep washing your hands, as everything is dirty. The library has been ransacked and they are slowly putting it back together using an old card system in wooden draws. The Chancellor regaled us with another of his Proverbs about a famous Mullah, Azradin, who when he died instructed that a wall be built around his tomb. They only had money for a beautiful front door and wall, leaving the back exposed. When people put up a front, or present a different face, it is known as an Azradin Wall. We did find a treasure trove of blue prints for the dormitory building that will make my life a whole bunch simpler. Some are in very poor condition and we will send them to Dubai to be copied.\n\nVisited an Afghan gallery. Much more up market (expensive) than the shops in Chicken Street, with silk carpet covered floors and walls filled with a variety of paintings done by Afghan artists. It is an ‘official’ UN shop so doesn’t fall into the general ban on shops and as such is doing a roaring trade. No bargaining here! There was some very good stuff and I spent an indulgent hour walking amongst the paintings, running my hands over the carpets. Most of them are new, made specifically for the shop in a factory, I imagine similar to the one we visited in Cairo. The designs, although traditional, don’t have the richness in colour I have become used to. I was assured it’s because they use traditional natural dyes that will not fade, as opposed to synthetic dyes used by most carpet makers. Fortunately, nothing took my fancy.\n\nToo many projects going on at the moment. Guessing what is required for bathrooms that can accommodate disabled people, coordinating the engineering department, sorting out sections for architects that seem to be brain dead. Thank goodness I have a competent Project Manager on the dormitory project!\n\nDid a bit of laundry and chatted with Susan and Peter, so nothing remarkable. Finished the few small paintings for my short story. Difficult in the dim light I had, but lots of fun.\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul 09\n\nLooking for a particular type of shop, you have to get to the correct district of the city. Each trade occupies a different sector of the city, a bit like they did in medieval times. They cluster together, twenty or thirty shops, all offering the same goods and service. Ancient printers stand next to Apple Mac’s (covered in a layer of grey dust) and the people are incredibly friendly. Certainly helps to have an interpreter with you!\n\nSogol made an Iranian Stew, Imam Baiildi, for dinner last night. Beef with eggplant and a ton of spices, very good indeed. The recipe is at the end. Ideally, the eggplant is cooked over coals, which makes it ideal to do on the Weber, and the rest as a stew/stir-fry.\n\nA French bakery out near the dormitory site, the find of the mornings adventure. Mostly American things (donuts, brownies, carrot cake) but they are learning and the bread is heavenly. Beautiful sunny picnic weather, if there was a spot where one could have one?\n\nOver the past few days I have noticed some beautiful prayer beads, called tsabe, in Afghanistan. The Minister of Commerce had a particularly lovely string, which seemed much longer than those I have seen used normally. It could have been lapis lazuli, mined in the Badakhshan province and highly valued. Probably made from 99 beads to signify the 99 Names of God, rather than the more normal 33 beads. Typically the beads are counted out in formulas recited 33 times after the end of the five daily prayers to focus your mind on God. Interestingly, the Catholic Church adapted them to form the rosary during the 13th Century.\n\nDropped my wallet at the Olympic Stadium during the inspection with the Italians. Not the cleverest thing to do with my passport and everything in it. Fortunately my driver picked it up, so my apprehension only lasted a few hours. Red wine monsters attacked with a vengeance this morning. Sonja (the Dutch lady) came around to the house and with the film crew that are staying with us; the lounge became a wine bar, too much of it without very much food.\n\nNo painting on my day off, this work business really interfering. But did manage a good walk around town with Bruce. First time in a month that we have been allowed out. The weather was glorious; the streets filthy, people as friendly as ever. There is a wide variety of headgear worn by Afghan men. The pakul (pakol, pakoul ) wool hat, Muslim cap worn by tribal men of Afghanistan originally from the Chitral region of Pakistan is probably the most popular. The design of the hat is based on Islam. When a Sunni Muslim man prays, his forehead must touch the ground. The round part provides a cushion. By contrast, when a Shiite Muslim prays, his head must rest on a rock. This type of hat would not be suitable for a Shiite. Shiites often carry a rock in their pockets to pray on. In the Shiite mosque there is a pile of rocks for the men to pick up and use in prayer. Then there are the Fez turban or skull cap, large turbans with a long end hanging down the back, neat around astrakhan hats, woolen knitted hats and large fur sheepskin hats. Specific types of turban caps (kolah) and Ways of tying the turban cloth (Iungi or dastar) identify various groups among the Pushtun, Tajik, Hazara, Aimaq, Baluch, and Uzbak. White is still the favorite turban cloth, although many, are stripped, rather than the red check pattern seen in Jordan and Egypt.\n\nIn most of the refurbishments we are doing, we are installing ‘western’ style toilets rather than the ‘eastern’ squat toilets. I’m not sure where this decision came from, but a consequence of this is that the attrition rate of plastic toilet seats is huge. Toilet users break these off because your feet slip on them when you stand on the rim to squat! Tragic but hilarious.\n\nAt the new UNAMA office compound they have opened an Italian Pizza and coffee shop, all very festive with a decent cappuccino and cake for $3.00. Unfortunately the coffee comes in Styrofoam cups, my pet hate! The Pizza’s are a bit bland. Think I will apply for a job there and make decent ones for them.\n\nCollected my carpet from the Chicken Street shop. Looks much bigger than I remembered! It’s a Bagdori pattern and is made in the Kunduz region of Afghanistan. Kunduz is the Eastern-most limit of Afghan Turkistan carpet producing region, which lies along the border with Uzbekistan- and is about 300 kilometers North of Kabul. The carpets are characterized as firm and supple; back ridged; tight knots double weft; mostly synthetic dyes; selvedge blue, red or undyed sheep wool; Persian knotted carpets. It’s very pretty indeed.\n\nImam Baiildi Iranian Stew\n\nRecipe for 4:\n\nIngredients:\n\nMedium onion (white or red) 2 to 3\n\nEggplants (large) 4 to 5\n\nTomato, medium size 4 to 5\n\nBeef cubes 400 to 500grms. (100 grams per person)\n\nGreen Bell Pepper, Medium size 2 to 3\n\nGarlic 5, 6 cloves\n\nHot peppers, small ones 2 to 3\n\nTomato paste 3 to 4 spoon full\n\nCinnamon one pinch\n\nTurmeric one pinch\n\nSalt and pepper as needed\n\nSlice the onions to 1/8 –inch thick, cut the garlic cloves in 4 pieces. Then heat oil in skillet over medium heat and onions and garlic toss gently to coat. Add a pinch of pepper and turmeric and let the onion to turn gold stirring occasionally. Add the beef cubes and the tomato past and cinnamon, stir until they are half way cooked.\n\nDice the eggplants into to ¼ inch slices and grill them on the BBQ or in the stove (you can fry them as well).\n\nDice the Bell peppers and the tomatoes. Cut the hot peppers in half.\n\nAdd a little bit of oil to a deep pot and spread a layer of BBQ eggplants at the bottom of the pot, stack a layer of sliced tomato and bell peppers on top of the egg plants and a layer of beef cubes. Add a little bit of hot peppers here and there for taste and aroma.\n\nRepeat the layers until you are out of ingredients. Add water to cover ¼ of the ingredients in the pot. Cover the pot and bring to boil, lower the heat and let it simmer for 30 to 45 mins. (Check on it and make sure it is not out of water).\n\nThe stew is ready to eat, can eat with rice or bread.\n\nI hope you enjoy the Iranian stew.\n\nSogol\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul\n\n11 March\n\nBack in the office, a bit weary but glad the formalities are over for this round. I have moved office again, for the moment, and the pile of stuff waiting for my attention makes me want to run away and see how the dormitory project is getting on!\n\nSpent the day in Dubai tearing up the pavements. Eight hours of charging around looking for electrical contractors and other information and my bum can certainly feel it, but no blisters! Propositioned by three ladies during the day. First time I have been offered a nights entertainment in exchange for the sharing of my hotel room. At least there were no men involved this time! Took a water taxi around the creek, easing my soul and soaking up the feel of water storing it in my system for the dust and dryness ahead. A dinner of grilled salmon, fresh baby vegetables and a bottle of crisp New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc on white linen overlooking the Dubai creek watching the sun set, felt like an interim step on the path down from the luxury of the past week to here. However, flying in felt fine and it was good to see familiar street scenes, be part of the traffic ballet and smile at the first hooting by my driver. Crazy I know! The afternoon call to prayer a reminder of how short a week is in the cycle of Afghanistan.\n\nCleaning a week’s mess from my room. Dinner of naartjies and cheese and a cold shower this morning, all a reminder that I am back in Kabul. Wonder if they changed the sheets?\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul\n\nWarm enough for short sleeves and a single layer for most of the day, and spring doesn’t start for another two weeks. Summer could be seriously interesting! There are green shoots on the tree outside my window. Green, not grey! Driving out to the dormitory I noticed a whole lot of birds in cages. Some precariously balanced atop rubble heaps and others on balcony tables. Perhaps with the warmer weather they are able to bring them out? I have heard that there is a huge bird market here, but it is probably better that it falls within the area still consider a security risk, given that so many birds of prey are caged in hideous conditions.\n\nSpent my Friday ‘off’ cleaning, trying my hand at making an omelet, frustratingly erasing the content of my flash disc, painting and generally lazing about. I’m happy with the result of my painting, which I have called ‘Wisdom’ (something I seem to need lots of), and did the layout for the miniature of Jessica. Wonder if I still know how to use a brush!\n\nSpring has brought out blossoms and a seriously congested nose. It’s warm enough for me to be outside and try my hand at skipping. Managed ten minutes of falling over the rope (think I did get to four continuous jumps) before my lungs imploded. Think the neighbours fell out of the window laughing and will be selling tickets soon!\n\nStanding atop the dormitory building looking down at the sheep grazing outside the new security fence. They are great big black coloured wooly things, in total contrast to the small stature Afghan students that wonder between them, dressed in their predominantly white robes, books or papers in hand, faces drawn into fierce scowls of concentration. A more tranquil scene I have yet to find and one that takes my imagination back decades to Sunday School.\n\nWalking through the grounds of the Italian Embassy for my ‘uitkak’ by the Ambassador, I was confronted by an amazing wall of bright yellow blossoms. I have seen them before (England or Russia?) but don’t know what the bush is. Also amazing was driving alongside the Kabul river. I passed a stretch where the trees are full of delicate white/pink blossoms. Translucent against a background of tilled green fields, a fleeting touch of softness in this harsh country? Much like a Van Goch painting, except for the bright blue burqua’s, that is! Couldn’t get a photo, worst luck\n\nA bit taken aback during our first coordination meeting for the refurbishment of the woman’s dormitory, when the lady from UNESCO asked us to include cooking facilities for woman in each room. The horror on our faces must have been evident as she quickly explained the cost problems involved in maintaining a central kitchen facility. We had the previous day been out to witness the results of a fire in a men’s dormitory at the polytechnic, which had been totally refurbished in January and now looked like a disaster zone. We have trashed the idea.\n\nCovered in sand after inspecting the roof of the Olympic Stadium. Not my best on these things, and with a dust storm raging my tolerance for another poorly executed job was not in evidence.\n\nWith so much destruction all around, seeing the erection of maypoles of coloured lights at traffic circles and across streets seems totally out of place. Preparations for New Year’s eve on Saturday to usher in the year 1383. Already there is a growing sense of excitement and enthusiasm. Bit like the Circus is coming to town!\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul\n\n25th March 2004\n\nI have passed an old man, beard grey and ragged, ridges etched into his face, a few times in different parts of the city. Hunched forward, he has the huge bow of his musical instrument slung over his shoulder. Not sure where he goes with it, another amazing story?\n\nA sky full of the most amazing stars. One good thing about a city which has little electricity is that when the clouds are absent and the dust settled, there is this incredibly gorgeous sky covered with stars. Don’t know what any of them are, but its as if I can reach up and grab a handful, or jump and be amongst them. Are they closer to heaven here?\n\nMy room smells of oil paint. A welcome and familiar one for me, but one that I have not smelt since I left my studio in December. Painting Jessica, a miniature for Jessica’s Restaurant in Montagu, was a bit nerve-racking as I have not painted a miniature since I left New York in November, and haven’t used brushes since then either. Fortunately, she worked well and now the challenge is to get it to dry without the dust affecting it.\n\nPersian New Year, the celebration of Nawroz, the first day of spring. Streets blocked with celebrating people, still so strange to see only men. The coloured streetlights were working and added to the merriment. I went to an Iran New Year party at the World Bank guesthouse with too much wine, funny French stuff and some equally funny South African stuff. Trashed my sinuses! It was interesting to talk to them about the traditions and how they blend them to cater for us westerners. Dinner on New Years Eve is traditionally a rice dish, but they had pizza and chicken for us. Breakfast on New Years day is a meal with seven (for luck) dishes which all start with S. Not sure if those are Persian names or if it makes any difference? The timing of New Year coincides with the solar calendar, hence it occurs at 11h20 on the 20th. The climax of the day is the raising of the janda (looks like a flag), or standard of Ali. It is wrapped in cloth, and whoever gets a scrap of it might find good fortune in the coming year. Gifts are given to woman and New Year messages sent. In the evening a meal of white fish, rice and herbs is served. I will probably have naartjies! This starts a forty-day festival including music, story telling and games.\n\nThe messages across our security radio remind me so much of those on MASH. They are nearly as hilarious and manage to make me smile whenever I listen to them. The fields and trees are green and it’s almost pretty looking out to the mountains. Just as well, because it’s ‘Kabul Green Week’ and they are planting a million trees in the city. I managed to secure a thousand almond and cherry trees for the Dormitory gardens, as these are traditional trees of Kabul.\n\nI have been brought a steaming mug of black tea. I have learned not to ask too many questions about the state of the mugs cleanliness before the brew is added, but I have seen them rinsing them, which gives me some confidence. Tea, for Afghans, is a very important part of society. There is a proverb that says, “If we drink tea, we don’t fight.” Wherever we go they offer you tea, and during meetings you are expected to drink tea throughout. This provides a logistic challenge as to toilets and where one can find them during a day out visiting building sites.\n\nNot my best this firing people, too many tears in this land, mine too, more family’s lives trashed and dreams shattered.\n\nEvery lunch time at the dormitory, our Afghan staff take it in turns to prepare food. This means you get to experience a wide range of local dishes, most of which consist of rice and, perhaps, lamb or chicken. It depends on the seniority of the person and his disposable income. Today it was one of our drivers turn, and we had a fried rice and veg type thing. Hygiene is almost unknown, so I’m never sure when I’m going to hit a bad one. I manage to keep my exposure to the one day a week, but today was it, and whatever, my system has gone crazy. That together with the Iranian dinner has proved to be too much. Compensation was a fabulous red wine, 2000 Rupert and Rothschild St. Emilion, and an Iranian nougat for after’s which was truly excellent.\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul\n\n1 April 2004\n\nVisited my trees out at the dormitory, and arranged to have them replanted as they were battling. Already they are shooting a sign that they are happy in their new temporary accommodation. Threatened the contractors with instant death if they trash them. Driving out, helicopter gun ships descend out of the sunset, towering mountains their backdrop. Primitive, predatory and strangely exciting.\n\nStomach a bit better, still gurgling away merrily, but no chills. Understand that the probable cause is not food, but the content of the dust I have been breathing over the past week. Susan prepared a fabulous dinner for the USAID people. The six men who have been fending for themselves the past two weeks attacked the food as though they were starving dogs. I managed to eat a weeks worth of veg. but left enough room for her superb baklava cheesecake desert. I couldn’t bare to eat such a wonderful meal with tissues as serviettes, which is the standard practice here. Hauled out my precious ones from home, and the bright yellows and blues exploded on the table. Fabulous!\n\nCleared the decks for my first finger oil painting here. Quite a few distractions during the morning but it’s looking promising. ‘Kabul balloons’ has been a challenge, having to get used to oil paints again after a few months working with acrylics. Didn’t think there would be much difference, but I was wrong! Think there is too much in the painting and the blue balloon focal point hasn’t really worked. Tried orange, but that wasn’t any better.\n\nSitting outside on the patio watching the sunset. I have my pot of tea (Vanilla, Ginseng and Blackcurrant), which has become enough of a ritual to be commented on. Such a ‘pain-in-the-arse’ creature of habit am I! It’s certainly not a substitute for wine, merely a preliminary. The closest I’m going to get to daydream here?\n\nThe musical bowed instrument I mentioned in a previous diary is not an instrument at all but a Toshak, used for, and named after, fluffing up feathers in the big coloured cushions that people sit and sleep on.\n\nHad dinner with Namira, late because the day went on a bit more than I expected and then at Gary’s house the electricity went ballistic. I got a nasty shock that left blisters on my fingers, but no damage done. She did a very good eggplant pasta dish, and a few too many bottles of wine resulted in a wine monsters visit at three thirty. Her house is big, spacious and much better than most I have seen. Lots of talk and laughs.\n\nThis is being written in the back of the car waiting for Justin before going out to the dormitory. Amazing how much you can do when you have one of these things with you all the time. No wonder they are making them lighter and simpler to use. Also says something about having a driver. Also security guards that carry your bag to and from the car, an assistant to do any shopping you need, etc. Life is tough here!\n\nInteresting to see the Dorm come alive. The contractors have set up a Volley Ball court in what is called the Lounge and Lobby area, on the original plans, and after work the sound of their laughter fills what was, a few weeks ago, a dead place. One of the new Engineers I have appointed in the past week is showing his improved status. He still comes to work on his bicycle, but now he has a tie, a new jacket and good shoes. Such a little thing, but his life has obviously turned.\n\nWent to see the house with the security people. It needs some modification, but they have accepted it and I will get started on sorting it out this week and signed the lease. I will be moving to Street 5, House No. 77, Apartment 2, Ansari Watte, in Shar-e-Now District of Kabul. Not an address that can be used for postal delivery! I will move in on Friday.\n\nIt has a beautiful lounge, full of light and ideal as a studio, two bedrooms with their own entrances, a tiny kitchen and one shower room. I may look at putting in a bathroom if it gets too expensive and I need to share the house. A wonderful patio looks out onto the garden and the other house on the stand, where an Italian couple stay. Will be good to have a place of my own again. There is a lovely Siberian husky type dog called Michael, all in all a great find.\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Jalalabad\n\n2 April 2004\n\nAutomatic rifle shots echo across the valley, fiery ricochets spin into the air, the burnt out shell of a Russian tank an indicator that these sounds are no stranger to the rugged mountains that soar above us. Light reflects from the curved arc of the male mountain goat’s horns as, in an avalanche of dust and pebbles, it tumbles down the mountainside towards the cheering men. Men who have ended the life of what was, a few minutes before, a proud sentinel on the slopes of the pass through the Hindu Kush mountains. We had barely noticed the animal when the security guards attached to our convoy, jumped out of their vehicle and began to pepper the hillside with automatic fire.\n\nThe road between Peshawar in Pakistan and Kabul carries four thousand vehicles a day, over two major mountain passes, along the most horrendous of roads. Driving down the pass is a frenetic roller coaster ride. The river tumbling next to you for much of the way, chuckling, coaxing and encouraging you to go faster, be more daring, twist, turn between trucks and roar across the crater sized potholes.\n\nTwenty minutes outside Kabul we came across the first of the Cucchie encampments. The nomads having moved up from the low-lying winter pastures around Jalalabad to their higher and cooler summer pastures. There doesn’t seem to be any restriction on their movement (other than minefields) and heir presence is accepted as a natural part of the cycle of life here. Their massive tents dot the hillside and dress bright spots of colour in a barren landscape. Huge camels lie, or stand around, their bright tassels, silly grins and languid movements making them the Rastafarian’s of the desert.\n\nBetween pale brown cliffs, a flood plane covered in the golden colour of maturing wheat, farmers anxiously watching the daily rising of the lakes level wondering if they will be able to harvest the crop before the water reclaims it.\n\nPassing quickly through the frontier like settlement of Sarobi, our armed escort turned back for Kabul and we continued the mad dash for Jalalabad. Reaching the relative smoothness of a potholed-tarred surface, our driver relaxed as Jalalabad was an easy twenty minutes drive. The radio chattered into life and the four drivers reached consensus that lunch had been delayed long enough.\n\nThe small hamlet of Darunta made this inevitable. At Darunta, the main road chokes through a series of tunnels, and the approach is lined with provision and eating establishments. The ‘eateries’ lie next to, but high above, the lakes edge. Decks, covered in cushions overhang the water where they serve a local fresh water fish, fried to a crisp and eaten with bread and bowls of natural yogurt, spiced with herbs.\n\nJalalabad, an administrative centre for the province, is the confluence of three rivers, which flow from here into Pakistan. It is far lusher than anything I have seen in Afghanistan to date. Tall date palms rise above the green canopy of mulberry, syringe, fig and gum trees. The green punctuated by lilac and purple Jacaranda. A never-ending stream of gaily-painted tuck-tucks that bob and weave patrols the streets between trucks, taxi’s and busses.\n\nA brief visit to the office and we were back in the vehicles for the hour’s drive into the district to see the villages where schools and clinics have been built and refurbished. Water canals frequently cut across the narrow twisting lanes, fields of wheat, eggplant, and tomatoes are interspersed with the harvested opium poppy fields. Carts piled high with poppy pass our vehicle on their route to the markets where a kilo can fetch $300.00. Smiling faces greet us wherever we stop, community leaders proud to show off their new buildings. No wonder people are adamant that this is where the real differences are being made in Afghanistan. My days are spent arguing with official’s over the colour of the marble they want on their floors, or the quality of painting between doorframe and wall, yet here I’m being asked if I can’t extend a school to cater for the growing demand for education, or build a wall to give the privacy parents require if they are to increase the number of girl students.\n\nI’m staying at the HealthNet International guesthouse, where a million birds are shrieking away in the trees. Looking out onto an overgrown garden still wearing the last of its spring finery, framed in the bright blooms from the bougainvilleas, enhanced by the heady scent of jasmine and syringe. All this overlaid by the ‘put-put-put’ sounds of tuck-tuck’s in the background. The garden is actually a big orange orchid, the trees towering above me. Too late for the spring flowers, but it remind me a lot of Monet’s garden. Water rills line the pathways, and large beds of annuals rampage between the trees.\n\nI have a glass of wonderful red wine and there is soft jazz seeping out from the house to where I am sitting in the fading afternoon. A fitting end to a long day of interviews for a new team I am forming here to work under Babs.\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul\n\n8th April 2004\n\nI have a new carpet in my office, which I sent my receptionist lady out to get. Not quite what I would have chosen, but incredibly good quality all in reds and blues, and a fraction of what they would have charged me for it.\n\nChaotic traffic. Gaudily painted lorries, their metal chain skirts clinking, tower above our car and completely block the intersection as they try to force their way in the opposite direction down the one way. Everyone honking their horns, laughing and making rude gestures to the Pakistani drivers. It’s a big circus.\n\nMy painting of The Great Dragon Mountain in the moon light evolves under my brush by torch light, while I listen to La Traviata , and my mind writes the presentation I will give on Saturday. A dinner of biltong, Chardonnay and smarties a fitting last meal here before I move to my new house.\n\n· There was something special about being able to leave Gary’s house and walk to my house as darkness closed in on Kabul. Spent the afternoon braaiing for about a 100 UNOPS people and now I am here sitting, very dirty, listening to the thunder reverberating through the walls trying to get up enough courage to wonder through the rest of what feels like a mansion. Wonder if it leaks?\n\n·\n\nMany of the buildings have elaborate ceilings. The one in my bedroom is a good example, quite neglected but attractive. This despite the most terrible light fitting, a great big blown glass thing. I have wide window ledges, bathed in morning sun and make a great place to sit and eat my cereal. I imagine I will be doing that outside as soon as I can get myself organized.\n\n·\n\nA walk down the road to the nan shop, my local baker, to buy two round pieces of nan (even though I only need one) standing in line with the kids doing their chore. “How are you?” the inevitable greeting, and then walking home, nan wrapped in my Kikoi (street smells are not something you want to carry unwrapped food past) to sit on the patio drinking tea and watch the moon rise, a glowing orb in the sky.\n\n·\n\nThe contrasts here are still amazing. My favourite horsemen riding down the middle of the road, incongruously followed by a brightly coloured tricycle tuc-tuc, speakers blaring out the unmistakable music of an ice cream van. Fabulous.\n\nAmongst a day of mounting problems needing to be resolved, a dust storm that turned my insides into jelly, a traffic jam forced us to walk through the money exchange portion of the market. Hundreds of people stand and offer different rates of exchange from dollars into Afs and Afs into dollars. The moneychangers of biblical times are the only comparison I can draw. No animosity or tension in the air at all. The trip also took me alongside the Kabul River to a section of apartment buildings with amazing architecture. Will have to try and get back to take photos. Next painting? On the way back to the office Boskashi horseman were showing off there riding skills, galloping wildly across the field. The same field where a game of cricket was being played, without any concern for these uncricket like activities. Does make me smile!\n\nHome to dust a foot high inside the house. I left the windows open to get air through the house providing a fabulous path for the dust whipped up by the dust storm.\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul\n\n14th April 2004\n\nNo Easter eggs in the shops, so I decided to make a small Easter basket. Blew the innards out of a few eggs (seriously difficult) cleaned them and spent the morning painting silly pictures onto the shells. Can’t remember when I last did something like this, but it was great fun and the kind of quiet gentle day I needed after the last few, stomach induced, rough days and nights. A sprinkling of Godiva chocs. and Easter has arrived in Kabul!\n\nA walk down into town to choose four rattan chairs for the patio, turned into a minor shopping spree with Sogol and Namira. They have to be accompanied by a male on their shopping trips, hence my usefulness. Did find the ‘Short Walk in the Hindu Kesh’. The chairs sit on the patio waiting for cushions. Next is a table and I will be ready to sit and enjoy the patio.\n\nWent with Namira to a restaurant up the road from the house called ‘Anaar’, which is the name of a fruit similar to an apple. Behind the predictable high walls is a restaurant with a fabulous atmosphere. You can sit at conventional western tables, or on the floor on sumptuous cushions. Chose the floor and had fun trying Thai and Indian dishes that sound familiar but look and taste completely different.\n\nThe mountains are purple and blue, their feet green, and they are stubbornly holding onto their tiny crests of white. Reminds me a lot of the Breeder River Valley.\n\nArrived here to find that the chokidor had filled my nice empty house with furniture from Georgio’s. Great big heavy stuff and my nice empty clean studio was packed from side to side, including a bowl of hideous plastic flowers. They are working on the floors in the other house and they wanted the stuff out of the way, which is understandable. But not here it’s not! Moved it all into the spare bedroom for the moment.\n\nAs expected the food at the Italian Easter Party evening was superb, with awesome basil lasagna. A whole lot of people here are vegans. Not sure if it’s for idealistic or practical reasons, but you get all sorts of stuff that does not require much, if any, meat. Silly people! The evening was still chilly, but I spent most of it outside chatting with a couple of people from the Red Cross about the country I have not even managed to get to see yet.\n\nHad lunch with the President of the Appeal Court. Seated in his office, on another stunning carpet, they brought around a brass bowl and jug to wash our hands in (very biblical?) and then mounds of brazed lamb and chicken.\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul\n\nSitting on the patio, a garish kettle of tea, (dropped the other one, which wasn’t much better) in my shorts (a real treat as you can’t wear them in public) listening to the birds and enjoying the warmest evening I have had here. No table as yet, but on the floor of the studio is the most beautiful carpet. My office is covered in sumptuous cushions. Quite glorious. Farida made cushions for the saddlebags I had her buy, one a particularly lovely antique. If they sit as comfortably as they look, it will be amazing.\n\nA brutal morning seems an apt description. Nothing like having months of work trashed and no comprehension of the effort involved in getting it to that point. Guess that’s what happens when expectations are high. Certainly not boring, but gentler would be kind of good as well!\n\nIts pouring with rain over my washing, the Weber is assembled and my painting of ‘Shattered Dreams’ is done. The first real painting I have done here in the studio. Feels quite odd.\n\nMichael (the dog) and I had the same dinner. Tuna and nán bread. My father would say that is an improvement, as he only gets what the dog will not eat. In fairness, he did have a huge tin of no-name brand (in Afghanistan that is going some) tuna while I had dolphin friendly, humanly captured, no added preservatives, zero calories, no fat, guaranteed to be tasteless John West Tuna. Oh, my nán was so hot it could hardly be carried, while Michael had to make do with yesterday’s nán.\n\nChatted to Terry, sitting out on the patio, the warm wind a reminder of the desert summer heat waiting around the corner. We had city power last night and I was able to paint until quite late, enjoying the sounds of the night and the freedom of the studio. Dirt still an issue, but I am coping slightly better with it.\n\nWalking into the office there were a group of men sitting under the mulberry trees chatting. So very much like the storyteller’s I had imagined and the painting I am trying to get started. There seem to be so many waiting for my hands to mess paint over the canvas. The one I am busy with at the moment is a spring flower basket. Felt as though I couldn’t let the season change without some reminder, and brightness, of spring.\n\nI have managed to get a garden included in the refurbishment of the Appeal Court building. One of my more disastrous projects, but at least with the garden I feel as though I am doing something that feels right.\n\nI find the Persian writing intriguing. Like magic picture writing, a blank page is covered from right to left in whirls, dashes and dots. I have found an alphabet translation, but as so much of it is phonetic, a direct transcription from words in our alphabet has people here rolling in the isles. They won’t tell me what I have written, but what the heck; it is fabulous to see it appear under my pen.\n\nNamira braved dinner. Can’t remember when I last pealed onions that made me weep so much. The fresh smoked salmon pasta worked a treat, even tasty. Didn’t manage to sort out a salad, or roast veggies, which it needed. However, the house worked well, and as it decided to pour with rain, we ate in the studio, which in itself was special. No vase, but I used a clear glass pudding bowl, and floated a couple of roses in it.\n\nFinished my ‘Spring Basket’ painting. Have to find a way to hang them up while I wait for them to dry. I may ask Eng. Jimu Gul to put up a picture rail to which I can fasten clips for the paintings.\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul\n\nWalked into town and found the DVD of Frida, which we can add to our collection, if it’s a reasonable copy. I also managed to buy a whole bunch of veggies and will do a stir fry tonight with a bit of turkey breast from the PX. Beautiful and clear after the rain of the past few days, and you can smell the fresh snow on the high mountains. Can’t describe it, but it’s as recognizable as the smell of the veld after a thunderstorm.\n\nShelling peas, chopping carrots and beans reminded me of watching Granny Mary go through a zillion beans in a second. Me, it took ages, I cut the hell out of my finger, they went all over the place and now I have a massive bowl of chopped veggies to stir fry. Except these are not those nice succulent young veggies from Wollies, but great big dead things.\n\nOn the way back I passed an alley where a guy was busy with his ‘toshak’ separating the cotton used in bedding and upholstery. Obviously it gets all compacted and with this machine they pull it apart again. Quite fascinating and glad I had the video with me. It does have a tune of its own, but hardly musical!\n\nDid the ironing and then spent the day painting a picture of an old man. Mostly done, a few things to sort out, but another painting I am happy with. Probably the last one I will be able to do before I leave for Dubai. Amazing\n\nPast a working traffic light this morning, the first I have seen. Not that anyone bothered to pay it any attention, and the traffic policeman standing on his podium in the centre of the intersection continued to wave his lollypop type baton and blow on his whistle in an effort to bring some order to the growing chaos. Coming in early, I get to miss most of the morning traffic circus, but they block off streets for passing dignitaries and other fun things to cause chaos when none is about.\n\nBack from chaos. More rain in the stadium roof, and the President expected any minute, and a contractor fell through the ceiling into Gary’s office five seconds before a downpour. Please tell me there isn’t someone up there with a sense of humour!\n\nTwenty-four delay in the trip to Jalalabad as the security escort for our road trip did not materialize. Seriously frustrating. As Bab’s had moved out of her accommodation, she needed a room for the night and I had my first houseguest to stay. First of many? Michael loved the company.\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul\n\nA wonderful week on the beach in Dubai. Lots of sun, swims in gem blue waters, more wine and food than is reasonable and tons of mischief. Such fun! We shopped for the house here, and I have exchanged my blanket for sheets and a duvet (In vibrant red’s). Even pillows in crisp clean linen from the UK. I have abandoned my horrible plate and cup for white china, extra special because it came from Woolies!\n\nDust, grime, potholes were all in abundance, a welcome back to Kabul, and as it has managed to do over the past five months, it rolled out its special ness just when your mind seriously started questioning what you are doing back here? The longest ‘Cushi’ caravan I have seen, camel’s way above the roof of the shuttle bus, coloured tassels swaying in time with the rolling gait, moving down the Jalalabad road. Devastated to find that my nan shop is undergoing renovations, and the one further up the road was sold out, so biltong, balanced by tomatoes and naartjies for dinner. Gourmet chef I am!\n\nThe sun streamed through my bedroom window at five and finally forced my lazy bum out of bed around six to be part of a beautiful morning. The washing out on the line, the patio washed and sparkling, and I am here with my pot of tea, small table and chairs. All very boring and settled. I have put feelers out for a cleaner and hope to get someone in this week. Georgio and Maurie (?) will be back on Sunday, but I will be in Jalalabad, back on Monday. Then at the end of the month I go out to Paktika, one of the more troubled spots.\n\nEnjoyed watching ‘Girl with a Pearl Earring’. Didn’t enjoy the book, but the movie is fabulous. In my newest painting, the rider is emerging from the background, in vibrant blue’s, soon to be relegated into the background as the remainder of the painting develops.\n\nBab’s has been staying over and we went to B’s for dinner. It was quite pleasant and we could sit out on the patio, under spreading trees and enjoy the summer evening. I had a salad with walnuts, apple and blue cheese and some kind of chicken and cheese dish. I decided not to risk the meat so soon after coming back.\n\nI am going to have to discipline myself to get up half an hour early and make the most of this gorgeous time of the day. At the moment I am benefiting from being in the office at six and getting tons out of the way.\n\nThree huge boxes of canvases that I ordered from New York arrived yesterday. Enough canvases to last me till Christmas and I now have a very serious looking studio. Lots of fun ahead of me that’s for sure.\n\nI had to kick open one of the office doors to get Bab’s things that were locked inside. For security reasons they have removed all the spare keys! In the morning when we asked the staff why they had locked her stuff inside, they told me that they had left her a key on her desk. Then locked the door. They did feel very silly when they realized what they had done and laughed about it all day.\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul/Jalalabad\n\n27 May 2004\n\nThank goodness I have not been using this computer at the office. The prognoses on mine, following its virus attack, is that it will need a new hard drive and the data is cyber junk. Very sad.\n\nI met an interesting lady, ‘Carla’. She is an Italian working for UNDOC (Drugs and Organized Crime) who is charge of their prison division, if you can believe a woman leading such a group in a country like this one. I am going to be working with her on refurbishing the prison here in Kabul. She is on her way to Vienna to see if she can raise money for the project. You can only be amazed at these brave people and put that extra bit of effort into supporting her work. Another Karen?\n\nFinished my painting of the Buzkashi horsemen. Lots of movement and colour, but not sure they jump out of the painting with the energy I wanted to convey.\n\nA new product has emerged on the barrows that line the street selling all sorts of things, from fruit to plastic buckets. Clear cellophane packets with a single fish swimming inside it hang around the perimeter of the barrows roof. The fish is about the size of an Angle Fish, much too small to eat (I would have thought), yet on the barrow is a burner and dish. Intriguing.\n\nI have a beautiful small table, made from ‘Shisham wood’, inlaid with brass scrolls and an exquisitely carved dining room table coming on Wednesday. Michael and I both have fresh food to eat and the evening is cool and peaceful. A garden concert with Paverotti and red Valpolicella wine from Verona.\n\nIt’s early in Jalalabad, but not impossibly so, and hot already. Left the office after six last night, the temperature in the mid 40’s and immersed myself in the UNICA swimming pool. My body doing its best to empty the pool as it hungrily absorbed moisture. Wrapped up the days work discussing logistic issues of getting work done in Noristan, sitting on the edge, feet dangling in the water. All with the help of a few beers. Very civilized indeed.\n\nThe team I have put together here is 13 engineers, one logistics person and two community negotiators. Only one of whom is a woman and for her we had to employ her brother to act as a ‘Muharrem’ chaperone wherever she goes. I realized, again, how little I know about what their lives are like, when the vibrant chatty woman at dinner, turned into this shrouded no-one the moment we stepped into the street. She is one of the very lucky, who has a first class education, has refused to be ‘sold’ into marriage and has (as far as I know) avoided being raped by brothers, father, uncles or any male that comes into the house. In addition she has Bab’s who fought the system to have her employed.\n\nDinner was to welcome me onto the team and, as happens so much here, to introduce a venue (owned by someone’s family contact) that can be used for conferences. Plates heaped with fried rice and mutton, the deep yellow brown studded with ruby red jewels of pomegranate seeds, platters of deep fried chicken on a bed of green stuff that tasted nearly as strongly as rocket. Bowls of pasta with a goat and sour yogurt sauce flavoured with garlic and goodness knows what else. Probably the best Afghan meal I have had. It was spoilt by being accompanied by warm coke and not the glass of good red wine I enjoyed when we got back to the house. I’m very pleased to say that my stomach is behaving wonderfully!\n\nI have moved to the patio at the office, where I am getting the morning breeze and I can look out over the green trees to the mountains that lie a just over the top of the bougainvillea.\n\nSpent an indulgent (can I actually be indulged any more?) half an hour reading through our Journals from Wall Tree Farm. They were comforting and wonderful, like listening to an old friend talking.\n\nPhew, I will be glad to get back to the relative cool weather in Kabul. The wind decided it had played enough, the dust settled back to earth and the heat crept in. Silently it oozed into every corner before tightening it’s suffocating grip. No electricity, so no fan’s or air conditioning and by three in the morning the temperature inside my room was above 40 degrees. Not a whole heap of sleep.\n\nThey say that projection is a huge part of making things happen. I passed a double cab, blue lights flashing with ‘Highway Patrol’ emblazoned across the sides. Not sure what movie they have been watching, but they are a long, long way from anything that remotely resembles a highway. You certainly can’t fault their optimism!\n\nSomebody dusted the mountains in a light sprinkling of white icing sugar snow. You don’t want to breathe in too quickly as the chance are it will get up your nose and make you sneeze! It’s already hot enough that those who did not get up early will not even know of the beauty they missed, seeing only a day filled with dust and grime.\n\nBeing a member of the early morning Kabul world, I am greeted by the furniture maker, his doors flung wide to capture the early morning light onto his bench, where he carves and shapes the leg of a chair, or is it a table? The child sitting in the window of the nan shop, greeting early morning patrons, marking their ‘credit sticks’, pieces of wood into which he makes a notch for each piece they take. Guards outside their huts, lost in the ritual of early morning prayers.\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Gardez\n\n1 June 2004\n\nThe drive down to Gardez was amazing. Leaving the city limits of Kabul through a valley that became greener and increasingly lush the further we drove. Trees grew in groves, fields of wheat stretched to the mountains and villages dotted the countryside.\n\nDeep in the valley, fruit trees grew in profusion, the air permeated with the smell of ripening fruit. Mountains stretched away into the distance, luring, taunting, tantalising.\n\nThe drive was made very personal by our driver who comes from the region and pointed out where his father had been killed by a Russian tank shell, and the mountainside of graves of his uncles. A solitary flag marked the resting place of his young son, lost to illness. He showed us where his village was and what they were doing to move it to ground where there is more water. A big undertaking, as it was the village of his grandfather and moving isn’t taken lightly.\n\nOnce past Logar, the country changed radically and we were soon in open desert. Not the red desert of Dubai, or the brown/grey desert of Jalalabad, but a yellow/grey green desert studded with Kuchi tents, their brightly coloured clothing flaring like jewels. Tons of camels lined the road using the road markers as rubbing posts, or roamed across the desert floor. My spirit lifted as their heads turned to watch us through impossibly long eye lashes.\n\nLeaving the desert we climbed up into the mountains, rugged and unfriendly to Gardez. The guest house is located within the UN compound and there is a definite claustrophobic feeling to it. Patches of lawn between the individual units that make up the guesthouse complex are lined with tall hollyhocks.\n\nGardez (Gar- dust and dez — gone; thus Gardez means ‘blowing-dust’) is a sleepy town, totally shattered by war. Fortresses dot the surrounding hills, and in the town itself are the remains of numerous walled fortifications. Sanitation doesn’t exist and roads nonexistent, rather you have a four wheel driver testing track in the middle of the city.\n\nAs with Jalalabad, the staff is exceptionally proud of what they are doing and starved of knowledge and praise. The police headquarters is located on the top of a hill that dominates the city in one of the old fortifications. It would make a terrific hotel for someone with lots of money and incredible optimism of the future. The prison, is predictably, even worse. Ancient, dilapidated, mud brick walls stretch for miles on either side of the imposing entrance. Towers rise above these crumbling walls at each corner, creating a closed space that contains an even more dilapidated prison building. Only one room is habitable, and barely that. Depending on the prison population, inmates have to stand upright during the evening lockdown. During the day they are able to lie down in the shade of the single tree, fettered at the ankles. However, they looked clean and healthy, a far cry from many of those outside the prison walls.\n\nThe meeting with the Director of the Gardez Municipality was one of the stranger ones I have been to. A huge room, with couches lining the walls, and clusters of fiercely turbaned and bearded men, papers clutched in hands, gesticulating wildly. I was led to one of the couches besides a man fast asleep. A hand on his shoulder alerted him to our presence and we proceeded to discuss our concerns with this half awake person. It was all in Dari, so I didn’t understand a thing, but eventually after tea, in none to clean cups, there was general agreement and we left. Amazing.\n\nBee hives in rows across the hillside, laughter and walking (ever mindful of landmines) through a small forest down near the river have made today far more than just another one in Afghanistan. I saw what looked remarkably like a Wood Hoopoe, but given my bird identification expertise, I wouldn’t go looking for it any of the books! Does it migrate? Wild flowers grew in drifts between the neat kitchen gardens, which themselves were squeezed between the adobe walls of houses on any flat piece of ground.\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul\n\n4th June\n\nSchool is out and the street transformed into a colourful sea of noisy kids. The street barrows are dispensing fresh fruit drinks as quickly as the old arms of the barrow operators can wind the mincing machines. Volleyball nets are strung, courts paced off, and balls surge into the sky in a series of looping arcs. Amazing feats of balance on bicycles, with three kids arranged on handlebars, cross bar and saddle, weave through the throng. Drinks with Karen after work. So wonderful to see her after so long, and looking so very well.\n\nA perfect summer afternoon, not a breath of wind, sun shining. The noises of a weekend flowing in rivers from the doorways, rooftops and gardens that surround the patio where I am sitting with my tea. The garden has been tidied, sort of; rugged country style and we have been walking up and down Chicken Street engaging in the master salesman behind the counters. One kid was truly fabulous. All of ten years old, selling the wears in his fathers shop, a true professional in every sense, he bartered and extolled the value of what he was on display. I bought a couple of small lapis and silver pendants that will make great key rings.\n\nDinner with Georgio and Mayra was everything my Sunday school perception of Italy is. Bowls of bright roses, rich red tomatoes sprinkled with green parsley. Goats milk cheese on proscito sprinkled with chives. 30 month old parmesan and pecorino, pungent and spicy, contrasting with soft fresh bread, served with marvellous Parma ham. (But not just any old Parma ham. This is from the bum, not the leg, and from a very special region within Parma. The best of the best!) Pasta, pesto and garlic. Red wine by the cask. Delightful and special.\n\nLunch in an Afghan home, but this could hardly be called typical as they have lived in Russia and Europe. But some things are the same. Someone to wash your hands when you arrive, a rectangular table at which you eat. The table being coffee table height, a bit below the height of the settee on which you sit. Of course, no woman to be seen. There was a mountain of food, spread across the table. I did manage to bash my knee with my elbow and so send a fork full of food in a wide arc across the table. Not my finest moment. Unusually, they served alcohol. Whisky or beer, with the Afghans eager drinkers of both, made for lively conversation about the future of Afghanistan. Interesting, especially as we get so little real information about what is going on in the villages that constitute the country.\n\nThere is some art to taking cell phone calls and fielding questions about why you are stripping staff from a program that is already battling, while braaing for a 100 UNOPS people. Trying not to cry at turning thick chunks of fillet (toughest fillet you have ever seen in your life) into hunks of tasteless, texture less stuff It must be well done, as that kills germs!?\n\nThings are getting better around the city. Small things, but I think indicative of where it’s all going. The fountains in the center of the city have been turned on. Water gushers into the air, falling cascades driven by the wind across the road where children cavort in the rainbow mist. Traffic, slow at the best of time, crawls as people point, laugh and generally enjoy the spectacle. At the traffic circle near the office, the garden is being cleared of head high weeds and roses bloom within the structured beds revealed. Tables and chairs grace the lawn outside the National Gallery.\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul\n\n10 June ‘04\n\nItalian national day at the Embassy, an elegant evening, under a full moon playing hide and seek with the clouds. The huge red and green Italian flag twisting in the slight breeze adding colour to the fragrance of honeysuckle that gentle perfumed the air. The food was delicious, the wine evocative of picnics under the Tuscan sun.\n\nMy painting is finished, the green eyes of the ‘Wild Child’ glaring out of the canvass at me. As always, I’m not sure it has worked quite how I expected it to, other than the eyes, which I wanted to make the focal point of the painting. More importantly, Babs is happy with it. She wanted it painted to take to her partner in Canada. First time I have worn through the fingers of one of the gloves painting. Must have got a bit carried away!\n\nVesna prepared a great spread with chicken, her eggplant and tomato dish, salad and some kind of kebab. Best of all was a tremendously good cake to accompany the last of the red wine. I strolled around their garden in the last of the day’s light, absent mindedly deadheading roses, which gave everyone a good chuckle, that I was whipping them into order.\n\nLots of wine with Babs, wine monsters in the early hours, and a swim through the middle of a compost heap this morning. The windstorm yesterday left the pool covered in debris. I made very sure that I didn’t swallow a thing.\n\nI paid the next four months of my rent. That will take me to the end of September, a month longer than my contract, but as there is every chance they will extend it I didn’t think the risk was too high. At least I don’t have to worry about moving till then, however with the first of our team going to Sudan, who knows what lies in the future!\n\nThe dormitory is moving along with its own quirks. Contractors are using their artistic license with the floors. Stars and diamond patterns, filled with green, red and yellow inserts. I would not have chosen it, but it does make me smile and isn’t in the least offensive. The specialist stone work has been an amazing success and it’s a real pity that there is no commercial outlet for it after this project finishes. We may try and use it on the new Italian Legal centre to be built on the campus, but further than that I can’t find an application. It’s too expensive and the stonemasons will return to their villages, the craft lost.\n\nA gentle start to the day, in air scrubbed clean by last nights thunder storm. I turned in early and listened to the storm building. Nothing as intense as the ones we get over the dam, that seem to want to destroy everything, but still wonderful. I didn’t get up to go swimming, lazing in the sunlight defused by the fig tree outside my window. The birds kept me company until I needed to get sorted for the day.\n\nFor any mail, please use the address below and allow months for delivery!\n\nJan Raats UNOPS\n\nC/O Thushanti Selvarajah,\n\nP.O.box: 116486\n\nDubai\n\nUAE\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul\n\n17th June\n\nWalking back from the nan shop into the most amazing sunset. Streaks of light blast out from behind the mountain turning the clouds into fiery red balls, a lightshow choreographed with the call to prayer. The air is stirring gentle, enough to cool wearied limbs, without agitating the dust. Tea has been replaced by wine and pate.\n\nIt is incredible that I am looking down onto a perfectly manicured clay tennis court, lines white against the yellow grey earth. The umpires’ chair, flanked by two bright blue umbrellas, looks across to rows of appreciative spectators on their plastic yellow chairs animated in their applause and encouragement. Children’s faces press against the fence eyes following the trajectory of the luminous yellow ball. Engineer Qader Dashti, one of my engineers, won the Afghanistan Open Tennis championships, a title he has held for the past ten years\n\nFaintly I can hear an Italian aria from the house across the garden. Sunshine pours into the studio, brilliantly lighting my paintings which are beginning to accumulate against the walls. ‘Jalalabad Donkey’ is finished. I find that if I start at five, have a break for a swim during the day, and paint the rest of the day I can almost get the painting finished. It’s quite important as there is so much rubbish in the air that I can’t leave the paint out overnight. I can use it for touch up bits, but that’s about it. I am sitting enjoying one of my Mum’s last pieces of shortbread with my tea.\n\nBeing the single non Italian, I sat at dinner with this cacophony of conversation washing around me. Hands flying from larger than life characters, cigarettes used as pointers for emphasis. Lighters, clothing jewelry, glasses may be functional, but it’s their fashion statement that is important. Daniel, was one of the characters in this opera. Hair slicked back, highlights artfully applied to blend into the curl in the nape of his neck. That so much work went into his hair seemed incredible as he was almost completely balled on top! Suntan, combat boots, military styled jacket. A Versace special forces veteran? It was fascinating, but hard work and I was glad to escape.\n\nHad a ‘bargar’ for lunch. One of those, ‘don’t you dare refuse’ things from my staff. It’s a great big spring role type thing, filled with chicken bits, curry and yes even chillies. Although tasty it is incredibly oily, and I’m pleased to say I didn’t mess at all! Apart from spilling my tea that is. It was followed by ‘shepira’, a sweet made from milk, walnuts, other bits and things I have never come across in my life before.\n\nI was looking at the busses and taxis while we sat in the traffic. Not that they in themselves are remarkable, but they are another indicator of how quickly things are changing, in Kabul anyway. In January when I arrived, woman were confined to the back portion of the busses, in a screened off section. Where no such section existed, such as in the cities new buses (donations from the Japanese government), they stood at the back. In taxis, they sat in the rear portion of the station wagon facing outwards, and were seldom seen in saloon cars. Now, the busses are full of woman scattered throughout, sitting or standing. They travel in taxis, mostly in the rear seats, but certainly not expelled to the trunk of a station wagon.\n\nI have a picture rail up in the studio to hang paintings up where the paint can harden in safety. Ali has been very good about making sure they remain safe during his cleaning, but this will hopefully minimise any damage.\n\nThe morning, after an awful day trying to find a solution for the emergency rehabilitation of the Pol-e Charki prison, where man’s inhumanity is beyond comprehension, is slowly opening its eyes to make sure everything is where it should be. Sun rising in the right place, trees still rooted in the ground, sky above them, all ok, so must have survived. The swimming pool water parted easily under my strokes, the car arrived on time, there was enough milk for cereal, the paint hadn’t hardened on the palette making cleaning easier and the internet is working.\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul\n\n24th June\n\nThursday evening, the studio is open, jazz is playing, I have hung my paintings up on the new picture rail and the weekend has started. Babs asked me to go to the Dutch embassy for some do there, but I wanted a quiet evening after what seems to have been a lot of week.\n\nI finished my miniature of Michael, cleaned up my painting stuff, hung up the rest of the paintings and then started to watch a movie, but even that seemed beyond me. Probably needed a good walk but that’s not an option with the security restrictions.\n\nJustin, Erin and Chris made hamburgers at Gary’s house and we sat out on the patio looking across to the mountains etched against the star filled sky. Not the crisp clear winter sky we will have at the dam with its millions of stars, or the star filled sky I had here in March when you could literally step out and walk amongst them.\n\nThe fountain on the way to the office was shooting out its first spouts of water and there are new street lamp poles along the main road out to the dormitory. Tiny bits of progress in the repair of this city of dust and debris.\n\nDinner for twenty people or so, from the America Department of Agriculture, as well as one of our key Ministry partners. I went along because Peter the Pirate was up from Islamabad for a couple of days and it would be the only chance I got to see him. However, as inevitable happens, I spent most of the evening sorting things out and cooked the salmon that Erin had prepared out on the gas weber. It was very good indeed and I’m glad to say I haven’t forgotten how to do it. Erin also did a bean and crushed almond nut dish that went very well with the salmon. The flavours were subtle, probably much too bland for the palettes here that exist on hot spicy food, but I thought it was splendid. A good French chardonnay, lively discussion with a lady from Brisbane and it’s no wonder I slept through to the alarm.\n\nThe studio is lightly perfumed with the candle from Crabtree and Evelyn and of course the smell of linseed oil and paint.\n\nMaking things up I am, trying to write explanations for transformer costs, sewerage rehabilitations and other such junk that will satisfy people sitting in New York who have no concept of the realities of getting things done in Afghanistan against tight deadlines in an environment where the security situation deteriorates by the day. But what the hell, the sun is shining, the dust is within bounds and I am looking out to the mountains that call to my feet to come and explore. Pity about the landmines.\n\nEvening is settling in to Kabul, the week chasing its way towards its end tomorrow. I was here by five thirty, finished laying out my next picture and enjoyed sitting out on the patio. It’s probably part of my boring, predictable self. I can hear the evening call to prayer, so different from the sound of the lions roaring across the water, or the Harley echoing from the mountains, but as comforting\n\nDairy of an Adventure to Kabul\n\n1st July 2004\n\nSaturday morning and the radio is full of chatter as people try and organise cars to get them to the office. Our Afghan staff don’t work on Saturdays and we have a reduced number of drivers making getting in and around the place a bit of an issue. The early schedule, of which there are more and more, start pouncing on the available cars at 05H30 and this goes on until about nine for those who don’t get themselves sorted.\n\nThe Weber had its first use. Amongst the meat and potatoes I cooked were pork chops, if you can believe such a thing in a Muslim country. Myra did a range of Italian dishes, of which I have forgotten all the names. The bowls and platters of food were passed around the table, accompanied by tons of chatter and gestures, with hardly a break in both to eat and take more from whatever it is that happens to be in front of you.\n\nIt was also the first time I have had people walking through the studio. From where we sat at a big, very rickety, rectangular table in the middle of the lawn, surrounded by roses you looked up into the light studio and its brightly coloured paintings. G&M have told people about this nut case that lives at the other side of the garden and it’s obviously a curiosity, as one by one the dinner guests asked if they could go and look at my work. This they did at various times, returning with comments, parallels with paintings they had seen and questions. Myra loved her miniature of Michael, which she must have seen drying on its stand when she put roses into the house, but I don’t think she expected to be given it for her birthday.\n\nAlthough we are still under security restrictions, I went for a walk around a couple of blocks, and stopped at the pool for a swim. You have to change clothes about a million times a day here. I have my painting shirt and shorts which I start the day out it. Then when I go up to swim, I have to put my tracksuit on and change into my bathers at the pool. After the swim, it’s another change back into my tracksuit for the walk home, and then its either shorts or painting gear. If I want to get nan form the shop, back on with my tracksuit for the walk along the road, and back into shorts when I get home. For my afternoon walk into town, I need jeans and my boots as you can’t be sure how dreadful the stuff is underfoot. Back at the house, the boots come off, and shorts reappear. If I go out to dinner, then it’s back on with jeans and boots. A circus it most certainly is!\n\nA day of painting the ‘Burqua Woman’ and then dinner at Gary’s, which was light hearted and easy. Gary and Susan are away and their son, Chris did the cooking. The girls from the ACC (Afghanistan Conservation Core — tree planting bunch) prepared salads and bits and I think I was the oldest person there by at least 2 decades! But being ‘The Painter Man’ I seem to be an oddity that they don’t mind having around. I stood outside, wine in hand, looking at the moon in a clear still sky.\n\nAnother full day, but a successful one as it flowed smoothly, unlike so many recently that feel as though they have been a battle from one end to the other. I did loose the small screw holding the lens in my glasses, which fortunately didn’t break when it landed on the marble floor in Ahmed Hussain’s office. He found a broom and swept the area where I had been standing and with lots of luck I found it amongst the dust. Much easier than searching on the roadside for a contact lens at any rate! Now I know why they recommend you carry a spare pair with you, as finding a screw here could prove interesting.\n\nFighting with the water pump. The storage tank is empty, the pump is working, but nothing is coming out of the taps. Well nothing you would want to shower in, never mind drink.\n\nA farrier operating next to the road, the horses not one bit interested in the massive trucks that rumble past, their vibrant colours muted under dust from the voyage over the Khyber Pass. Camels walk down the centre of the main road, a gentle reminder that the pace of life can be slower, more measured and more enjoyable. No amount of hooting from taxi’s or swearing from traffic officials makes them increase their gait, merely a wink from their long eyelashes as they move off unaffected. Fabulous.\n\nDiary of an Adventure to Kabul\n\n7th July\n\nUnder the moon on the patio at Gary’s house with some 40 people for salmon and ostrich Bruce had brought back from Kenya, quite exceptional.
