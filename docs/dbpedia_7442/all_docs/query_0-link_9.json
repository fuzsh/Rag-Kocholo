Originally, the dam supplied 40 to 45 megawatts of electrical power but silting and damage to the system during the Afghan civil war was has reduced its actual output to 11.5 megawatts. The plant is currently in very poor condition and requires major rehabilitation including possible replacement of all three turbines.\n\nNearby cities:"
