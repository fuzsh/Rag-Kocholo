The Kabul River empties into the Indus River near Attock, Pakistan. It is the main river in eastern Afghanistan.\n\nThe major tributaries of the Kabul River are the Logar, Panjshir, Alingar, Surkhab, Kunar, Bara, and Swat rivers. The Kabul River later gave its name to the region and to the settlement of Kabul.\n\nHydrology\n\nThe Kabul River is little more than a trickle for most of the year, but swells in summer due to melting snows in the Hindu Kush Range. Its largest tributary is the Kunar River, which starts out as the Mastuj River, flowing from the Chiantar glacie in Brughil valley in Chitral, Pakistan and after flowing south into Afghanistan it is met by the Bashgal river flowing from Nurestan.\n\nThe Kunar meets the Kabul near Jalalabad. In spite of the Kunar carrying more water than the Kabul, the river continues as the Kabul River after this confluence, mainly for the political and historical significance of the name.\n\nThe Kabul River is impounded by several dams. The Naghlu, Surobi, and Darunta dams are located in the Kabul and Nangarhar provinces of Afghanistan. The Warsak Dam is in the Valley of Peshawar in Pakistan, approximately 20 km northwest of the city of Peshawar.\n\nOther pages\n\nList of rivers of Pakistan\n\nImages for kids\n\nOne of five bridges that crossed Kabul River during the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1879-1880) era.
