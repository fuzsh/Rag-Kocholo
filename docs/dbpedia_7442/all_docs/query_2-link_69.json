Dasht-e-Ghamberi Canal OR Aab-e-Marwareed Canal Kunar River The canal starts from Zari Baba and goes to Salampur in Khewa District of Nangarhar Province to irrigate Gambiri Dag in Laghman/Nangarhar Province. The canal will use 3,000 liters per second from Kunar River. Approx 10% of Kunar River will be diverted through canal. Because the inflow of Kabul River is receding every year due to drought in Afghanistan, during the last few years. The surplus water of canal will be stored in Darunta Dam. Remaining part of the project has been reported to be financed by India. Financial and technical aspects have been studied with estimated cost of US$ 1.2 million. The project was started by PMS.
