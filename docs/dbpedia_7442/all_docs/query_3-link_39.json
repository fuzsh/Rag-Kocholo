Outline • Introduction • Forms And Sources Of Energy • Energy in Afghanistan • Sources Of Energy In Afghanistan • Energy rate & consumption • How to conserve energy in Afghanistan\n\n3. Definition • Generally Energy is defined as the ability or the capacity to do or accomplish work. Energy Conservation Energy Conservation Is Efficiently Reducing The Amount Of Power Required To Carry Out Operations.\n\n5. Nothing Is Created Nothing Is Destroyed Everything Is Transformed Then……… There is A Definite Cycle\n\n6. Sustainable Energy Is A Three-Legged Stool Improve Efficiency , Technology Do More With Less ! Conservation, Use Less As Much As Possible Renewable Energy, Invest For The Present And Future\n\n7. Forms OF Energy 1. There Are 8 Kinds Of Energy Exists In Our Daily Live 2. Mechanical (Kinetic And Potential) 3. Chemical 4. Nuclear 5. Heat 6. Light 7. Electrical 8. Sound\n\n8. Forms OF Energy Mechanical energy is The energy of motion (kinetic) and the energy of position (potential) Chemical energy is The energy that bonds molecules together. Nuclear energy Energy locked in the nuclei of atoms. Thermal (heat) energy Energy of moving and vibrating molecules A specific kind of kinetic energy. Light energy Hot objects like a filament lamp or a gas mantle give off light Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Electrical energy Energy of moving electrons Electrical appliances use it to operate Sound energy Vibrating objects produce sound A form of energy detected by the ear. Music and noise are sound.\n\n10. A person uses about: 55 Calories while sleeping for 1 hour 210 Calories while walking for 1 hour 850 Calories while running for 1 hour A Calorie (C) is a unit to measure energy in foods. 1 Calorie is equal to about 4,184 Joules.\n\n12. • Non-Renewable energy is energy which is taken from the sources that are available on the earth in limited quantity and will vanish fifty-sixty years from now. • Non-renewable sources are not environmental friendly and can have serious affect on our health • Non-renewable sources exist in the form of fossil fuels, natural gas, oil and coal. Renewable & Nonrenewable Energy • Renewable energy is energy which is generated from natural sources • They are available in plenty and by far most the cleanest sources of energy available on this planet. • E.g. : energy from wind, geothermal, biomass from plants . Coal , petroleum and natural gas and propane are also known as fossil fuels Require millions of years of natural processes to be produced and cannot be replenished ( non-renewable)\n\n13. Solar Energy\n\n15. Every Day The Earth Receives An Amount Of Solar Energy Equal To 30 Years Of World Fossil Fuel Energy Use. If Concentrated, The Sun Light That Fall On The Hood Of A Car Would Be Enough Power To Boil A Pot Of Water In A Minute\n\n16. • The Energy Utilized From Sun Light Is Called Solar Energy • There Are Two Methods For Harvesting Solar Energy Concentrating Solar Thermal Plant(CSP) Photovoltaic Plants(PV) Solar Energy • Sunlight is the most abundant energy source on the earth • On average, the earth's surface receives about 1.2 x 1017 W of solar power • Most of the other renewable energy also depend on the sun as the primary source\n\n17. Wind Energy\n\n18. Wind Energy • Is The Conversion Of Wind Energy Into A Useful Form Of Energy, Such As Using Wind Turbines To Make Electricity, Wind Mills For Mechanical Power, Wind Pumps For Pumping Water.\n\n19. Geothermal Energy • Natural heat extracted from the earth's crust • In form of heat, which originates deep in the earth's molten interior • Responsible for volcanoes and earthquakes\n\n20. Biogas Energy • Utilization Of Organic Waste To Produce Energy • Chemical Energy Stored In Plants And Animals Or In The Animal Waste Is Called Bio- energy • Burning Of The Biomass Will Release The Energy In The Form Of Heat\n\n21. • Capture the kinetic energy of falling water to generate electricity • Flowing or falling water rotates turbines and generators where kinetic energy is converted to mechanical → electrical energy Hydropower The Sarobi hydroelectric power plant, built in the 1950s.\n\n23. Energy In Afghanistan Total Population Population Access to 24 hr electricity kabul Population Population accessing electricity  Energy in Afghanistan is primarily provided by hydropower  As of 2012, approximately 36% of the total Afghan population has access to 24-hour electricity but in the capital Kabul the number is 70%.  Afghanistan generates around 600 megawatts (MW) of electricity mainly from hydropower followed by a fossil fuel and solar.\n\n25. Electricity Import • The Construction Of A 442-kilometre (275 Mi.) High Voltage Transmission Line From Uzbekistan To Afghanistan Was Completed By October 2008 • It Is Expected The Project Will Cost $198 Million [USD], And Will Have A Capacity Of 220 Kw; The Transmission Lines Were Jointly Funded By India And The Asian Development Bank • By 2011, Afghanistan Imported Nearly 300 Megawatts Of Electricity From Uzbekistan\n\n26.

Afghanistan dams and reservoirs • Dams and reservoirs in Afghanistan are used for irrigation, water supply, hydro-electric power generation or combination of these. The list of dams and reservoirs in Afghanistan are listed below. Darunta Dam Kajaki Dam Dahla Dam Naghlu Dam\n\n29. Darunta Dam • Its Power Station Contains Three Vertical Kaplan Turbines (6 Blade Propeller) With A Rated Output Of 3.85 MW Each. Originally, The Dam Supplied 40 To 45 Megawatts Of Electrical Power But Silting And Damage To The System During The Afghan Civil War Was Has Reduced Its Actual Output To 11.5 Megawatts. Kajakai Dam • Water discharging from the dam traverses some 300 miles (500 km) of downstream irrigation canals feeding farmland. It currently produces 33 megawatts of electricity. Dahla Dam • The Dahla Dam is the largest dam in Kandahar Province, and the second largest in Afghanistan. The dam is 34 kilometers north of Kandahar City and is operated by the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority.\n\n30. Naghlu Dam • It Is Currently Being Rehabilitated And Only Three Of The Four Generators Are Operational.The Dam Is 110 M (361 Ft) Tall, 280 M (919 Ft) Long And Its Reservoir Has A Storage Capacity Of 550,000,000 M3 (445,892 Acre·ft).\n\n31. Coal • Afghanistan is reported to have coal reserves totaling 100-400 million tons. these mines line located from badakhan up to heart province. • Afghanistan have more than 11 coal reserves such as Bamyan province Ashposhta and Sarasia coal reservers 150 milion ton Sarjungel and Sar Asia coal reservers Baghlan province Karkar coal reserves Dodkash coal reserves Samangan province Dara e sof-Shabashak the first quality coal reserves 74 milion ton Darae e sof- Golabadri -keshinemabayenvallag and balkhab distract coal reserves Badakhshan province Kotal khaki - Barf distract coal reserves Parwan province FarakortGorbandprovine and GawoparanSurkhparsa distract coal reserves Herat province Karukh coal reserves 15 milon ton. the 10 milion ton for industries Daikundi province Lagharjoe - kacharan Distract coal reserves Uruzgan province KandalanvalagMudakhil Distract coal reserves\n\n32. Natural gas and oil  Natural gas was Afghanistan's only economically significant export in 1995, going mainly to Uzbekistan via pipeline de marde.  Natural gas reserves were once estimated at 140 billion cubic meters  Anew gas field was discovered in Chekhcha, Jowzjan Province. Natural gas was also produced at Sheberghan and Sar-e Pol.  As of 2002, other operational gas fields were located at Djarquduk, KhowajaGogerdak, and Yatimtaq,\n\n33. 54 56 58 60 62 64 66 68 70 72 Gas Petrol Diesel Summer Fall Winter Gasol i ne And Gas E ach Li ter By Afghani s\n\n35. Geothermal Energy In Afghanistan  An area of vast untapped potential lies in the heat energy locked inside the earth in the form of magma or dry, hot rocks.  The technology currently exists to provide low-cost electricity from Afghanistan’s geothermal resources, which are located in the main axis areas of the Hindu Kush.\n\n36. Wind Energy  At least one wind farm was successfully completed in Panjshir Province in 2008, which has the potential to produce 100 kw of energy.  They have identified approximately 158,000 megawatts of untapped potential wind energy  Installing wind turbine farms in Herat could provide electricity to much of western Afghanistan.\n\n37. Hydroelectricity  Hydroelectric plants were built between the 1950s and the mid 1970s, which included the Sarbobi hydroelectric power plant in Kabul Province  The Naghlu in the eastern Nangarhar Province, the Kajaki in Helmand Province and a number of others.  Also in operation was the Breshna-Kot Dam in Nangarhar, which had a generating capacity of 11.5 MW.\n\n38. Solar Energy In Afghanistan  In 1991, a new 72-collector solar installation was completed in Kabul at a cost of $364 million. The installation heated 40,000 liters of water to an average temperature of 60°C around the clock.  The use of solar power is becoming wide spread in Afghanistan. Solar owered street lights are seen in several Afghan cities and towns, including the capital Kabul\n\n39. Installed electrical capacity in Afghanistan\n\n40. To Energy\n\n41. Minimize energy use Use energy efficiently Minimize energy loss How To Conserve Energy By Observing And Implementing The Following Four Tips You Can Minimized The Energy Use In You Homes And Daily Lives Get Everyone Involved effective awareness's about how to conserve energy should be broadcasted and provided to public via TV ads, publishes, internet and educational institutions in order to increase their awareness about the issue. The Government must design and implement an electricity consumption system that can be applicable for electrical devices within homes of offices, energy star in US.\n\n42. • Reduce, Reuse, Recycle Part of an effective conservation program • Identify those areas that use the most energy • Make a plan, set some goals • Involve the whole family • Choose energy-efficient home appliances, which have been designed with energy conservation in mind. • Choose natural gas furnaces, water heaters, stoves, and clothes dryers. Natural gas is significantly more efficient than electricity derived from fossil fuel sources, for heating purposes. • An efficient way to use electricity for heating is with a heat pump. • Try to use natural ventilation and only use your heater when temperatures drop below 20°C(68°F), and try to only use cooling devices when temperatures get above 26°C(78°F). How To Conserve Energy\n\n43. Get Everyone Involved • Increase everyone's understanding of the benefits of energy efficiency • Make the link between actions and behavior by individuals and potential savings • Motivate users to modify behavior • Share the goal of reducing energy consumption and saving money\n\n44. What Should Be Done 1_ Engineering Latest Standards For Newly Designed and constructed structures should be taken In account in Afghanistan in case of energy conservation like R-200 R-200 • A b u i l d i n g s t a n d a r d b a s e d m a i n l y o n e n e r g y t a r g e t s • S u p e r i o r c o n s t r u c t i o n m e t h o d s i n c l u d i n g l o t s o f i n s u l a t i o n , h i g h q u a l i t y w i n d o w s a n d d o o r s , e l i m i n a t i o n o f l e a k s a n d d r a f t s • T a k e a d v a n t a g e o f p a s s i v e s o l a r a n d h i g h e f f i c i e n c y h e a t , c o o l i n g a n d a i r e x c h a n g e\n\n45. • 2_Gas pipelines and usage system should be designed and implemented in houses • That eases the cocking and heating purposes. • Bangladesh, powered by its economic growth, has decided to join the $7.5 billion Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline project, which enjoys the backing of the United States and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). • Which passes through Herat Kandahar Quetta Multan and runs alongside Herat-Kandahar Highway with the Length of 1,735 km (1,078 mi) and maximum discharge of 27 billion cubic meters per year 2_Gas pipelines\n\n46. Strengthening Local Electricity Voltages • Strengthening the local electricity voltages can provide the ground for families and homes • To use electricity for heating and cocking instead of wood and coal that can generate environmental pollution which has serious aftermaths for humans health in a region. • Electricity in Afghanistan is 220 Volts • The latest electricity voltages can reach up to 600 Volts\n\n47. Exceeding Number OF Machinery In Capital • With 3,289,000 population kabul city is estimated to be the home for 1224000 vehicles as of 2010 which 49% is passengers cars, 10% trucks 15.5 motorcycles 10% buses. • 4025 km roads have been built in kabul city as the roads of kabul city was considered to be originally designed to 25000 to 3500 cars per day. • IRIN (United Nation Integrated Regional Information Network) reports that every month app 8000 cars are registered with kabul traffic department."
