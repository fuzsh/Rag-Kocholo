        "text": "Water is a precious natural resource because it plays a significant role in maintaining human health; fulfilling the human food requirements and boosting industrial development and above all, keeping the natural heritages and beauties. An ever-increasing world population imposes quantitative pressure on water resources from one side (for provision of safe drinking water, agricultural and industrial needs). While from the other side, the quality of this natural resource is becoming deteriorated by the uncontrolled amounts of residential wastes generated by humans, discharges from agricultural fields and e%uents of industrial plants. Ignorance of these realities not only confines the present human environment but also puts the future creatures to undesirable consequences. Therefore, it is crucial to deal with the issues challenging sustainable water resource management and globally embark on sound and constructive strategies to overcome these catastrophes. Among these strategies, rais...\n\nIn this paper a detailed account of the Kabul River has been given to highlight its socio-economic importance and point out associated environmental problems. To identify income generating activities in Pakistan field visits were conducted and people in the business were interviewed which was supplemented by secondary data. The present riparian uses include drinking, washing, bathing and also feeding it to livestock. Water quality is deteriorated by two means i.e. decrease water quantity and discharge of municipal and industrial effluents. Due to a small industrial base Afghanistan does not deteriorate water quality of the river but had constructed seven dams on Kabul River and its tributaries. Two dams are used for irrigating the Kabul and Nangarhar provinces. Pakistan had constructed one dam on main Kabul River (Warsak Dam), irrigating Peshawar, Nowshera and Charsada districts and five dams on its tributaries. If all the dams in Afghanistan become functional it may affect water qu...\n\nThe water supply to Kabul city is at serious risk due to groundwater over abstraction and severe contamination by sewage. The water overuse is partly due to poor management and a long period of war, and instability in Afghanistan. In recent years shallow wells have been installed and financed by aid programmes, but this, along with high population increase has also lead to over-use of groundwater resources. The current water supply of about 85% inhabitants depends exclusively on local, individual groundwater sources, obtained predominantly from shallow aquifers, mainly, by hand-pumps. The paper analyses the status and trends of the Kabul groundwater system and assesses new solutions to meet the future water supply demand. The status of groundwater shows that groundwater levels are declining quickly (1 m/year) and several wells are already dry. Moreover, water quality analyses of the Kabul aquifers show a negative trend in groundwater quality in respect to concentration of nitrates, ..."
