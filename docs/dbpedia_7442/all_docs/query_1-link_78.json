So, state the facts with assertion and intelligence. • Revision is the key term when it comes to preparing for UPSC examinations. Read, write and practice as much as possible. • UPSC has started picking terms such as Purohita, Jana or Kula and asking simple questions based on the term. So be prepared for these questions. • Special importance should be given to Mauryan and Gupta’s time. Therefore, concentrate on these two, at length.\n\n1\n\nChapter\n\nUnderstanding Ancient Indian Sources\n\n1.2\n\nChapter 1\n\nHistorical understanding of the past depends upon how we interpret historical data, and such databased interpretations are the result of various evidence derived from the two major sources of history, i.e., literary and archaeological. Though literary sources include all kinds of texts—written and oral, and archaeological sources include all tangible, material remains, yet all remains of the past, be it literary manuscripts or writings inscribed on images, inscriptions or coins may constitute sources of history no matter whether they are conventionally divided into literary (religious and non-religious/secular texts, foreign accounts, etc.) sources and archaeological (artefacts, coins, inscriptions, all kinds of material remains) sources.\n\nA careful analysis of the sources is key to understanding history of the past. Since both literary and\n\narchaeological sources have their own respective potential vis-à-vis limitations, neither of the categories can be taken for granted. The corroboration of evidence from texts and archaeology is generally considered important for an inclusive and comprehensive reconstruction of the past, though given the inherent differences in the nature of literary and archaeological data, it is often difficult to integrate them in totality to present a coherent picture of the past.\n\nObjectives After reading this chapter, you will be able to: • Learn about twin epics in Sanskrit—Ramayana and Mahabharata • Develop an understanding of religious and non-religious Indian texts • Understand the origin and importance of Vedas, Puranas and Upanishads • Learn about the Greek, Chinese and Tibetan travellers who visited India • Explain how archaeological remains such as monuments, coins, pottery and pillars help in interpreting the stories about the people who used them • Conrelate evidence from texts and archaeology for an inclusive understanding of Ancient India.\n\nLiterary Sources Ancient Indian texts are generally divided into religious and non-religious texts. This division might appear misleading to others with regard to description of the term ‘religion’, especially while making a distinction between the literary sources. The English term ‘religion’ emphasizes upon belief, practices, rigidity and distinct religious identities which have a definite, exclusive boundaries. On the other hand, the Sanskrit term ‘dharma’ does not attach such meaning. It precisely denotes a set of things such as codes of conduct, social practice, forms and objects of worship including rituals, philosophical ideas, etc., that people are supposed to follow. In other words it suggests a particular way of life. It appears that ancient Indians did not distinguish between the religious and secular domains, and perhaps that is the reason why we witness a fine interplay of both religious and non-religious contents and themes in the majority of ancient Indian texts.\n\nShruti\n\nDharmashastras\n\nUpanishads\n\nTwelve Angas\n\nNitishastra\n\nEpics\n\nAranyakas\n\nMainly in Sanskrit\n\nTripitaka Literature\n\nTwelve Upangas\n\nVasuvandhu\n\nTen Pakirnan\n\nAshvaghosha\n\nDharmakirti\n\nNandisutra\n\nAnuyogadara\n\nTwo miscellaneous works\n\nDinnag\n\nCelonese Chronicles\n\nMahavamsa\n\nDipavamsa\n\nMahavastu\n\nMilindapanho\n\nPali Non-Canonical\n\nNon-Canonical\n\nSix Chhedasutras Four Mulasutras\n\nSvetambara Literature\n\nJain Literature\n\nAsanga\n\nYogachara Aulthors\n\nAbhidhamma Pitaka\n\nArchaeological Sources Non-Religious Secular Literature\n\nVinay Pitaka Literature produced by two major schools Sutta Pitaka Madhyamika\n\nMahayana Canon\n\nCanonical\n\nBuddhist Literature\n\nHinayana Canon\n\nNagarjuna\n\nMahabharata\n\nPuranas\n\nBrahmanas Ramayana\n\nVedangas\n\nSmriti\n\nFour vedas samhita\n\nBrahmanical or Vedic Literature\n\nReligious\n\nLiterary Sources\n\nSources of Ancient Indian History\n\nHarisena’s Prayaga prashashti\n\nAihole Prashashti of Ravikirti • • • • • • • • • • • •\n\nSudraka’s Mrichhakatikam\n\nKalidasa’s texts such as Abhigyanashakuntalam\n\nBharata’s Natyashastra\n\n• Pliny • Pompeius\n\nLatin Account\n\nForeign Accounts\n\nDrama\n\nHerodotus Ctesias Megasthenes Arrian Strabo Diodorus Justin Plutarch Deimachus Dionysius Ptolemy Periplus of the Erythraean Sea\n\nGreek Account\n\nBharavi’s Kiratarjuniya\n\nAshvaghosha’s Buddhacharita and Saundarananda\n\nBhartrihari’s three Shatakas\n\nKalidasa’s Meghaduta and Kumarasambhava\n\nKavya Literature\n\nNon-Religious Secular Literature\n\nPrashasti\n\nKautilya’s Arthashastra\n\nReligious\n\nLiterary Sources\n\nSources of Ancient Indian History (Continued)\n\n• Fa-Hien • Hiuen-Tsang • I-tsing\n\nChinese Account\n\n• Taranath’s Account\n\nTibetan Account\n\nBilhana’s Vikramankadevacharita\n\nBanabhatta’s Harshacharita\n\nVishakhadatta’s Mudrarakshasa\n\nDandin’s Dashakumaracharita\n\nProse Literature\n\nArchaeological Sources\n\n1.4 Chapter 1\n\nStone tools and artefacts • • • • • • • •\n\nReligious Didactic Administrative Commercial Eulogistic Votive Denotive Literary\n\nInscriptions • Graeco-Roman coins • Punch • Marked coins • Figure-impressioned coins\n\nCoins\n\nArchaeological Sources\n\n• • • •\n\nBuildings Pillars Cave Temples\n\nMonuments\n\n• Red ware • Black-on-red ware • OCP • PGW • NBPW\n\nPottery\n\nSources of Ancient Indian History (Continued)\n\nSeals\n\nOther material remains such as sculptures, cave paintings, statues, etc.\n\nUnderstanding Ancient Indian Sources 1.5\n\n1.6\n\nChapter 1\n\nLiterary texts do have historical contexts as they are produced and circulated in definite time periods.

They, in fact, were passed on orally for generations before they were available as written manuscripts in a much later period.\n\nReligious Literature Vedic Literature\n\nMahabharata—The Epic Religious Literature\n\nThe entire corpus of Vedic literature is broadly divided into Shruti (that which has been, heard’) literature and smriti (that which has been ‘remembered’) literature. Shruti literature consists of the four Vedas, Samhitas, Brahmana texts, Aranyakas and Upanishads whereas the smriti literature includes the Vedangas, Puranas, epics (Ramayana and Mahabharata), Dharmashastras and Nitishastras.\n\nShruti Literature\n\nVedic Literature\n\nThe Vedas present a multitude of gods, most of them related to natural forces such as storm, fire and wind.\n\nThe word ‘veda’ is derived from the root ‘vid’ which means to know. It is applied to a branch of literature which is declared to be sacred knowledge or divine revelation, that is, Shruti. Samhitas are collections of hymns sung in the praise of various gods. They are the most essential part of the Vedic literature. They are four in number—Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda and Atharva Veda Samhitas. The Rig Veda is also known as knowledge of the hymns of Praise. It consists of a collection of 1,028 poems grouped into 10 ‘circles’ (mandalas). 1017 hymns (suktas) and supplemented by 11 other called valakhilyas. It is divided into ten books or mandalas. The Rig Veda is the oldest and as well as the most important of all the Samhitas. Earliest mandalas, i.e., from book II to VII are called ‘family books’ as they are ascribed to particular families of sages or rishis. In mandal III, which was composed by Vishvamitra, we find the famous Gayatri mantra, addressed to the solar deity Savitri. The term ‘Harirupiya’ (resembling Harappa) finds mention in mandala VI, and the famous ‘Battle of Ten Kings’ is described in mandala VII. Book IX is dedicated to soma. Books I and X are later additions and the latter contains the famous Purusha sukta hymn, explaining the division of society into four varnas. The Rigvedic priest is known as Hotri (the invoker). Recently, the Rigveda has been included by the UNESCO in the list of World Human Literature. The Sama Veda is the Knowledge of the Melodies (the name derived from saman, meaning a song or melody) consists of 1810 stanzas (except 75) taken from the Rig Veda. They were set to tune for the purpose of chanting by the udgatri priests at the soma sacrifice. It is called the book of chants, and the origins of Indian music are traced to it.\n\nUnderstanding Ancient Indian Sources\n\n1.7\n\nBrahmanas and Upanishads of the Vedas\n\nRigveda\n\nBrahmanas:\n\n• Aitereya Brahmana\n\nUpanishads: • Aitereya Upanishad\n\nThe 4 Vedas\n\nand the\n\nYajurveda\n\nKaushitaki Brahmana\n\nKaushitaki Upanishad\n\nKrishna Yajurveda\n\nShukla Yajurveda\n\nTaittiriya Brahmana\n\nSatapatha Brahmana\n\n• Brihadaranyaka • Taittiriya Upanishad Upanishad • Isha Upanishad • Maitrayani Upanishad • Katha Upanishad • Svetasvatara Upanishad\n\nSamaveda\n\nAtharvaveda\n\n• Tandyamaha Brahmana • Panchvisa Brahmana • Shadvisha Brahmana • Chandogya Brahmana • Jaiminiya Brahmana\n\n• Gopatha Brahmana\n\n• Chandogya Upanishad • Jaiminiya Upanishad\n\n• Prasna Upanishad • Mundaka Upanishad • Mandukya Upanishad\n\n10 Main Upanishads\n\nThe Yajur Veda is the Knowledge of the Sacrificial formulae consists of various mantras (hymns) for the purpose of recitation and rules to be ­observed at the time of sacrifice. It is primarily a guide for the use of the adhvaryu priest who performed the ritual. The two royal ceremonies of rajasuya and vajapeya are mentioned for the first time in this Veda. In contrast to the first two which are in verse entirely, this one is in both verse and prose. It is divided into two parts—Krishna and Shukla. The Atharva Veda is the knowledge of magic formule (Veda of the atharvans or the knowledge of magic formulas) contains charms and spells in verse to ward off evils and diseases. Believed to be the work of non-Aryans, its contents throw light on the beliefs and practices of the non-Aryans. It is divided into two parts— Paippalada and Saunaka. Brahmanas are treatises relating to prayer and sacrificial ceremony. Each Veda has its own Brahmana text/texts attached to it. Their subject matter is ritual and the language is prose. In short, they deal with the science of sacrifice. The important Brahmanas are—Aitareya, Kausitaki, Tandyamaha Brahmana, Jaiminiya, Taittiriya, Satapatha and Gopatha Brahmanas. Tandyamaha Brahmana, is one of the oldest, and contains many legends, and includes the Vratyastoma, a ceremony through which people of non-Aryan stock could be admitted into the Aryan fold. But the most important as well as the most voluminous of all the Brahmanas is the Satapatha Brahmana. It provides us information about not only sacrifices and ceremonies but also theology, philosophy, manners and customs of the later Vedic period.\n\n1.8\n\nChapter 1\n\nAranyakas are called the forest books as they were composed mainly by hermits living in the forests for their pupils. These texts deal with mysticism and symbolism of sacrifice and priestly philosophy. The Aranyakas contain transitional material between the mythology and ritual of the Samhitas and Brahmanas on the one hand, and the philosophical speculations of the Upanishads on the other.\n\nUpanishads Upanishad, though literally means ‘to sit around gurus/teachers’, is colloquially understood as establishing connections and equivalences between things. The upanishadic thoughts emphasize upon the attainment of the ultimate knowledge. Upanishad that imparted knowledge was not the ordinary one; it was all-encompassing which was the key to liberation from the cycle of birth, death and rebirth. Such a knowledge could only be imparted to deserving disciples as it was difficult to explain and comprehend. It could only be revealed through debate and discussions, using devices like stories and images among its seekers. Of 108 Upanishads, only 12 are very important. They are: Aitareya, Kausitaki, Chandogya, Kena, Taittiriya, Katha, Svetasvatara, Brihadaranyaka (oldest), Isa, Mundaka, Prasna and Mandukya. Upanishadic thoughts mainly revolve around the two fundamental concepts of Brahma and Atman. The Sanskrit term ‘Brahma’ comes from the root ‘brih’ which means to be strong and firm, and something that grants prosperity. It is in fact, the ultimate, imperishable reality pervading the universe. The term ‘Atman’ is the ultimate reality of the individual, i.e., the imperishable self. The reference of the term ‘maya’ or illusion (Shvetashvatara Upanishad) is defined in negative terms. It occurs in the human mind because of ‘avidya’ or ignorance, i.e., inability to realize oneness with Brahma which is the creative power of ‘Ishwar’ or God. Some of the Upanishads explain the doctrine of transmigration (freedom from a cycle of death and rebirth) by asserting that death and rebirth, which are connected with ‘avidya’ could be averted through attainment of ultimate knowledge. Hence, the objective of upanishadic thought is the realization of Brahma and liberation the cycle of death and rebirth (samsara) could only be achieved through knowledge or jnana.\n\nExcerpts from Upanishads Tattiriya Upanishad: Satyam vada, Dharam chara, Matri devo bhava, Pitri devo bhava, Atithi devo bhava (Speak the truth, Practice dharma, Treat your mother, father and guest as Lord). Chandogya Upanishad: The significance of OM syllable is discussed—the chant of OM is the essence of all. Ashrama (stages of life) system is mentioned. The story of satyakaram, the son of Jabala is mentioned. Katha Upanishad: ‘Rise, awake! Having obtained these boons’, understand them!’ This slogan was adopted by Swami Vivekanand for his Ramakrishna Mission. Conversation between father Vajasravasa and son Nachiketa. Brihadaranyaka Upanishad: Longest of all upanishads. Popular Verses: Aham brahmasmi, asato ma sadgamaya..., om shantih, shantih shantih’. Stories of King Janaka of Mithila and dialogues between sage Yajnavalkya and two learned ladies, Gargi and Maitreyi. Mundaka Upanishad: Satyameva Jayate mentioned.\n\nUnderstanding Ancient Indian Sources\n\nThe Upanishadic principles embody the epitome of the Vedic thoughts. The ­ nal culmination of Upanishadic thought, interpreted in various Upanishads fi in the later period is the philosophy of Vedanta (end or culmination of Vedic thoughts) or Uttara-Mimamsa. They reflect different ideas about atman, brahma and the world, and statements such as tat tvam asi (you are that), aham brahma asmi (I am brahma) and brahma atma aikyam (non-dualism of brahma and atman) can be interpreted in different ways. Bhagavad Gita incorporated some aspects of upanishadic philosophy with a doctrine of advocating righteous action (karma). One of the prominent scholars of Vedanta philosophy was Shankaracharya of ninth century who propounded the theory of monistic advait vedanta. According to this theory, there is only a single unified reality—brahma and everything else appears to be a myth including the world. On the other hand, there exists a pantheistic stand too, in upanishadic thought which identifies the universe with brahma. The Upanishads are also seen as anti-sacrifice or anti-Brahmin. Brihadaranyaka Upanishad mentions that the performance of sacrifice leads to ‘world of fathers’ but knowledge leads to ‘world of Gods’. There are references to Brahmins being instructed by Kshatriya kings (such as Ajatashatru, Ashvapati, Prabahana, etc.) in imparting the knowledge of brahma. Despite these references, there are Upanishads, included in Vedic corpus as part of Shruti, suggest that Upanishads do not reject sacrifice, rather they employ the vocabulary of sacrifice to new ends. There are symbolic representations of rituals in Upanishads. In a nutshell, Upanishads are philosophical texts dealing with topics like the universal soul, the absolute, the individual self, the origin of the world, the mysteries of nature, and so on. They mark the culmination of Indian thought in the Vedic period. They indirectly criticize the rituals and lay stress on the value of right belief and knowledge. Though Shruti literature comprises a religious literature, references to historicity and historical events in them can be discerned. Book VII of Rig Veda refers to a battle of ten kings over the question of the distribution of water of river Ravi (parushni). In this battle, Sudas defeated his enemies who had confederated against him. Moreover, Shruti literature forms an important part of the Brahmanical traditions. It reflects their religious beliefs and practices, apart from various facets of their social life. As a source of history, these texts are used for collecting information about the life and condition of the people in parts of north-western and northern India during the second and first millennia bce.\n\nSmriti Literature Vedangas and Sutra Literature: There are six Vedangas: Siksha (Phonetics), Kalpa (Rituals), Vyakarana (Grammar), Nirukta (Etymology), Chandas (Metrics) and Jyotisha (Astronomy). Smirti\n\nManu Smirti\n\nNarada\n\nKatyayana Smirti\n\nYajnavalykya Smriti\n\nParasara\n\nIn contrast to the Vedic literature which is considered as Shruti or divine revelation, the Vedangas are called smriti or literature handed down by tradi-\n\nBrihaspati\n\n1.9\n\n1.10\n\nChapter 1\n\ntion because they are of human origin. The Vedangas are written in the form of sutras (literally thread), i.e., condensed prose style intended for memorization. The sutra literature helps us in the study of the Vedic literature. Of all the sutra texts, only Kalpa Sutras have come down to us, and these are again divided into three classes: Srauta Sutras, Grihya Sutras and Dharma Sutras. The Srauta Sutra deals with the rituals of the great sacrifices of Agni, Soma and animal; the Grihya Sutra deals with the domestic ceremonies and sacrifices to be performed by the householder; and the Dharma Sutra is concerned with the laws, manners and customs of people in general. It is the Dharma Sutra with which the historians are mainly concerned, for it constitutes the foundation of the Dharmashastras such as the Laws of Manu. Attached to the Srauta Sutras are the Sulva Sutras, the oldest books on Indian geometry containing instructions for the measurement and construction of the complex Vedic fire altars and the laying out of the sacrificial area.\n\nThe Epics—Ramayana and Mahabharata These twin-epics in Sanskrit are considered ‘itihaas’ (traditional history) as well as smriti. Cultural milieu of both appears to be almost the same, ­partly because of similarities in language and styles found in these texts, and partly because of stray references of each other’s stories and places used in these texts. Reference of Valmiki and Ramayana is found in Ramopakhyana section of Mahabharata and mention of sites of Mahabharata such as Kurus, H ­ astinapur, is found in Ramayana. The composition of the Ramayana can be placed between 500 bce and 300 ce and Mahabharata between 400 bce and 400 ce. Ramayana’s original authorship is attributed to Valmiki. It received its present form two or three centuries later, but there are a number of different versions which exist today. Out of its seven books (kandas), the first and last are the latest. The former states that Rama is an incarnation of Vishnu, an indication of its later composition, but many of the stories are very old and include some which probably originated in the kingdoms of Magadha and Kosala. Orginally known as Jaya Samhita, the Mahabharata includes the Harivamsa (the genealogy of Hari or Vishnu) and the Bhagavad Gita (Song of the Lord). Traditionally it is attributed to Krishna Dwaipayana, also known as Maharashi Veda Vyasa. The Gita represents the views of Krishna Devakiputra who declared that righteous conduct is more efficacious than gifts made to a priestly sacrificer. Whether the great battle between the Pandavas and Kauravas described in the Mahabharata ever happened cannot be proved or disproved. There may be a possibility that there was a relatively small-scale battle, transformed into a gigantic epic war by bards and poets. The text consists of 18 books or sections (parvans). The Harivamsa forms an appendix to the Mahabharata and consists of three parts which give an account of creation, a genealogical list of the Yadavas, myths, the adventures and love affairs of Krishna and the cowherd girls. These epics may be used as historical sources, though with cautions. Traditionally, Rama lived in the treta yuga and the Mahabharata war happened later, in the dvapara yuga. But, some scholars argue that the activities and episodes associated with the Mahabharata reflect a slightly earlier period than those of the Ramayana because of different geographical settings of the epics. The events of Mahabharata takes place in Indo-Gangetic divide and the upper Ganga valley, while the centre of activities in Ramayana appears to be shifted eastward, to the middle Ganga val-\n\nUnderstanding Ancient Indian Sources\n\nley. Moreover, the dominant women characters of the Mahabharata suggest an earlier stage of social development. Archaeological findings at the site of Ayodhya have indicated the presence of a settlement here from the Northern Black Polished Ware phase, which may go back earliest to around 700 bce. However, excavation reports with regard to the existence of a settlement in the geographical settings of the Mahabharata doesn't speak much about it. The stories of the epics are so well-knit and powerful that millions of people, irrespective of their caste, community and race in India and outside (Tibet, Myanmar, Laos, Indonesia, etc.) are familiar with them. Such popularity and dynamism of the epic stories are attested by the presence of their different versions in succeeding periods. Apart from the oldest version of Valmiki’s Ramaya- Northern Black Polished Ware na, numerous other tellings of Rama story include Paumachariu of Vimalsuri—a Jaina version in Prakrit, the Dasaratha Jataka in Pali—a Buddhist version, Kamban’s Iramavataram—a 12th century Tamil version, and the Ramacharitamanas of Tulsidas—a 16th century Awadhi version, to name a few.\n\nPuranas The word purana means ‘old’. Although the tradition names Vyas as its author, the current forms of Puranas cannot be said to be the work of one person or age. None of the 18 main Puranas date earlier than the Gupta period, although much of the legendary material is older. The names of the 18 Puranas are Vishnu, Agni, Bhavishya, Bhagavata, Naradiya, Garuda, Padma, Varaha, Matsya, Kurma, Linga, Siva, Skanda, Brahma, Brahmananda, Brahmavaivarta, Markandeya and Vamana. In some lists, the Vayu is substituted for the Agni Purana, and in others for the Siva Purana. The Vayu Purana is perhaps the oldest; some others may be as late as the 15th or 16th century, but all appear to have undergone much revision. The Puranas are mainly composed between fourth c. bce and fifth c. ce. Puranas greatly aided the dissemination of Upanishadic teaching to the illiterate, and to the majority of women to whom education was deliberately denied. The Puranas have immense contributions in disseminating secular knowledge among the masses in ancient India.The conception of ‘time’ mentioned in the Puranas is relevant to the present times. There are four ages (Yuga), i.e., satya, treta, dvapara and kali, all consisting of thousands and thousands of years. These four make a mahayuga and a hundred mahayuga constitute a kalpa. Every kalpa is divided into 14 manvantaras, each presided over by a manu. One Yuga follows the other and periodic destruction of world is followed by recreation. Apart from the mythical description of genealogies of the kali age, the Puranas describe the process of the formation of the universe including that of earth and explains how bharatavarsha came into existence. The texts describe a universe shaped like an egg, vertically divided into celestial worlds, earth, and netherworlds. The earth is described as a flat disc, consisting of seven land masses (varshas) arranged in concentric circles, alternating with seas of salt water, molasses, wine, butter,\n\n1.11\n\n1.12\n\nChapter 1\n\nHistorical Importance of Puranas • Vayu, Brahmanda, Harivamsa, Matsya, Vishnu and Brahma puranas provide historical information about dynasties of ancient India. • The descriptions of Haryanka, Shisunaga, Nanda, Maurya, Shunga, Kanva and Andhra dynasties are found in these puranas. • Most of the puranas are compiled between 4th to 6th centuries ­(Gupta Period). • The genealogies of kings are mentioned. • Some of puranic myths such as encounters and interactions between asuras, devas and sages may be interpreted as interactions among people of different cultures. • Information in puranas reflect comingling of Brahmanical and non-Brahmanical culture traditions. • Account of mountains, rivers and places are useful for studying historical geography of ancient India. • Helps in understanding the development of cults and cultic practices based on the worship of Vishnu, Shiva and Shakti.\n\ncurd, milk and fresh water. Bharatavarsha (India) forms the southernmost part of which is situated in the centre of the earth. The Puranas, especially ‘Vayu’, ‘Brahma’, ‘Harivamsa’, ‘Matsya’ and ‘Vishnu’ do provide useful information on ancient political history. They shed significant light on dynasties like Haryanka, Shishunaga, Nanda, Maurya, Shunga, Kanva and Andhras (Satavahanas). They also mention kings with names ending with ‘Naga’ who ruled in northern and southern India. Puranas provide accounts of mountains, rivers, and places which are ­useful for historical geography. They also talk about emergence of cults ­arising out of devotion to gods such as Vishnu, Shiva and goddess S ­ hakti. Manifestations of such devotion is expressed through the worship of their images in temples, pilgrimage or tirtha, and vows or vrata. Though ­traditionally, Puranas are considered to be the vehicle of Brahmanical, social and religious values, they also reflect the interaction of Brahmanical social and non-Brahmanical socio-cultural traditions.\n\nDharmashastras or Smritis The word dharma may be conceptualized as an idea that the universe is regulated by a certain natural law and the moral principles that guide people’s lives should be in consonance with natural law. Dharma refers to proper ideal conduct of a person in the society. It involves a course of action which leads to the fulfillment of human life. In other words, the goals or purusartha of life has to be achieved for\n\nThe Puranas Traditionally, the Puranas expound five subjects (panchalakshana): • • • • •\n\nThe creation of the world – Sarga Its destruction and recreation – Pratisarga Genealogies of gods and patriarchs – Vamsa Reigns of the Manus of various world periods – Manvantaras The history of the Solar and Lunar royal dynasties - Vamsa charita\n\nUnderstanding Ancient Indian Sources\n\nthis fulfillment. They are dharma (righteous conduct), arth (material well-being), kama (sensual pleasure) and moksha (salvation). The contents of Dharmashastras include the sources of dharma; the duties of the four varnas and asramas\\various samskaras of man; the avocations of the four varnas in life; the duties and responsibilities of the king; rules for taxation, etc.; impurities of birth, death, and other causes; different kinds of sraddhas; rules about food, duties of women and their property; niyoga (levirate) and its conditions; and sins and their expiations, and penances and their conditions. The Smritis deal with these topics in an analytical and systematized form under three main heads—achara (rites), vyavahara (dealings), and prayaschitta (expiation). Among all Smritis, the Manu Smriti is the most a­ ncient and a­ uthoritative. It has 12 chapters dealing with achara, vyavahara and p­ rayaschitta. It is looked upon as having served as a model to all the later Smritis. It has many masterly commentaries like those of Medhatithi, ­Govindaraja and Kulluka Bhatta. The next in importance is the Yajñavalkya Smriti, which has three kand (sections) namely achara-kanda (customs), vyavahara-kanda (judicial process) and prayascitta-kanda (crime and punishment, penance). It agrees with the Manu Smriti on many points, but disagrees on issues like niyoga, inheritance and gambling. It has got a few valuable commentaries like Balakrida, Apararka, and Mitaksara, of which Mitaksara is the most critical and authoritative. The Parasara Smriti is noted for its advanced views and it is considered the most suited for the Kali yuga. It deals with achara and prayaschitta only. It mentions the apaddharma of the four castes: agriculture, trade and commerce for the Brahmins, etc. Its commentary by Madhvacharya is very popular and authoritative and explains vyavahara under raja-dharma. The Narada Smriti occurs in two recensions and deals with vyavahara only. It closely follows Manu, but introduces a few innovations in the 18 titles of law and permits niyoga, remarriage of women and gambling under certain conditions. The Brihaspati Smriti has seven sections dealing with vyavahara, achara and prayaschitta. It closely follows the Manu Smriti and is known as a ‘parisista’ (supplement) to the latter. The Katyayana Smriti follows closely the works of Manu, Brihaspati and Narada. It specially deals with ‘stridhana’ (a woman’s personal property). Among others, mention may be made of the Smritis of Angirasa, Daksa, Pitamaha, Prajapati, Marici, Yama, Vishwamitra, Vyasa, Sangrahakara, and Samvarta.\n\nBuddhist Literature Buddhist literature is classified into canonical and non-canonical texts. The canonical texts lay down certain basic tenets of Buddhism. The Pali canon of Buddhist sacred literature may be divided into two great classes—the Hinayana canon written chiefly in Pali, and hence spoken of as the Pali canon; and the Mahayana canon written chiefly in Sanskrit and widely translated into Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan and other Mongolian languages. The Pali canonical books consist of three parts collectively known as the Tripitakas (the three baskets) which were reduced to writing between 350 bce and 90 bce. The first one, Vinaya Pitaka The Vinaya Pit.aka is one of the three parts that make up the Tripit.akas. Its primary subject matter is the monastic. The Vinaya has three divisions: • Sutta-vibha´ngha (Divisions of Rules) • Khandhaka (Sections) • Parivãra (Accessary), a short summary of the rules and how to apply them\n\n1.13\n\n1.14\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe second one Sutta Pitaka (300 bce) consists of five nikaya or collections of aphorisms, precepts and discourses for the laity. They are mentioned as follows. • Digha nikaya, a collection of long sermons and an account of Buddha’s last speeches and his death and the funeral ceremonies; • Majjhima nikaya, a collection dealing with the relation of Buddha to the Jainas and others, various forms of asceticism, and a long enumeration of offences and the punishments; • Samyutta nikaya discusses Buddhist doctrine and many sayings of Buddha; • Anguttara nikaya, a collection of sermons arranged in ascending numerical order, enumerating doctrines and principles; • Khuddaka nikaya comprises 15 books of miscellanea which are essential for an understanding of Buddhism. The important ones are: m The Jatakas comprises stories of Buddha’s former lives, which are among the most ancient fables in the world of literature. m The Theragatha and the Therigatha, the Songs of the Male and Lady Elders, containing religious lyrical poetry of a high order. m The other important books under Khuddaka nikaya are: Khuddaka Path, Dharamapada, Udana, Ittivuttan, Suttanipata, Vimanavathu, etc. The third one Abhidhamma Pitaka deals with the same subjects as the Sutta Pitaka, but in a more scholastic manner. It consists of supplementary philosophical dissertations and expositions of the finer points of mind training, psychology and dogma. Of its seven books, the Dhammasangani provides a good exposition of Buddhist philosophy, psychology and ethics. The Kathavatthu (or Vinnanapada), ascribed to Moggaliputta Tissa, is valuable for the light it throws on the evolution of Buddhist dogma.

The scriptures are presented in a series of dialogues, discourses and sermons, delivered by Buddha in what is called the sutra (Pali, Sutta) form, and generally known as the Vaipulya Sutras or ‘expanded discourses’. They were translated into Chinese, and from Chinese into Japanese and Tibetan, and several sutra works exist only in these versions, the originals being lost. The task of codifying the Mahayana doctrines is associated with such scholars as Nagarjuna (100 ce), founder of the Madhyamika school and compiler of several Mahayana works such as, Madhyamika Karika; Asvaghosha (100 ce), author of the Buddhacharita, a poetic biography of Buddha, besides other notable works; and the brothers Asanga and Vasubandhu (fourth century ce), founders of the Yogachara school, and authors of numerous Mahayana texts.\n\nJaina Literature Use of Prakrit The Jainas utilized the prevailing spoken languages of different times at d ­ ifferent places in the country for their religious propaganda and the ­preservation of sacred knowledge. They even gave a literary shape to some vernaculars for the first time. Mahavira himself preached in the mixed ­dialect called Ardha-Magadhi so that people speaking Magadhi or Suraseni might understand him thoroughly. His teachings that were classified into 12 books called Srutangas are written in the Ardha-Magadhi language.\n\nSvetambara Literature The sacred literature of the Svetambaras is written in the Arsha or ­Ardha-Magadhi form of Prakrit, and may be classified into 12 Angas, 12 Upangas, 10 Prakirnas, 6 Chheda sutras, 4 Mulasutras and 2 miscellaneous texts. The Jainas themselves do not\n\n1.15\n\n1.16\n\nChapter 1\n\nPrincipal Sutra Works Some of the principal sutra works are: • Saddharma-pundarika (250 ce), also called the Lotus Sutra, has been described as the Bible of half-Asia. It is the most important of all the sutras. It is a sermon delivered by Buddha on a mountain to an august assembly. • Prajna-paramita deals especially with the notion of sunya or nothingness. According to it, beyond this illusory and impermanent world is a new world of freedom, which one can attain with the aid of prajna or intuitive and transcendental wisdom. • The main doctrine taught in the Avatamsaka Sutra is that of ‘interpenetration’; everything in the world being interpenetrated by everything else, and mutually conditioning and being conditioned. • Gandavyuha describes how Buddha while living in a grove at Sravasti entered into a state of profound meditation and the bodhisattvas with him became filled with compassion for all beings. • Other important sutras are: the Sukhavati-vyuha, the Vajrachhedika, the Maha-pari- nirvana and the Lankavatara (400 ce).\n\nclaim that these texts are the authentic productions of the founder of Jainism, but maintain that the 12 Limbs were codified some 200 years after Mahavira’s death, while the whole canon did not receive its definitive form until the fifth century ce, when it was finally established at a council held at Valabhi in Saurashtra.\n\nAngas • The Acharangasutra deals with the rules of conduct which a Jaina monk was to follow. • The Sutrakritanga is mainly devoted to a refutation of the heretic doctrines. • The Sthananga and Samavayamga present the Jaina doctrines in an ascending numerical series. • The Bhagavati sutra is one of the most important Jaina canonical texts. It contains a comprehensive exposition of the Jaina doctrine, and gives a vivid description of the joys of heaven and the tortures of hell. • The Jnatadharmak-athah teaches the main principles of the Jaina doctrine by means of parables, legends and stories. • The Upasakadasah narrates the story of ten rich merchants who were converted to Jaina faith. • The Antakriddash and Anuttaraupapatika-dasah contain stories of Jaina ascetics who saved their souls by following a course of rigorous self-torture, leading to death. • The Prasnavyakaranani is a dogmatic treatise dealing with the ten precepts, ten prohibitions, etc. • The Vipakasrutam contains legends illustrating the consequences, after death, of good and bad deeds of a man done in this life. • The Drishti Vada contains miscellaneous doctrines of a varied character.\n\nUnderstanding Ancient Indian Sources\n\nUpangas They possess very little literary interest, as their contents are mostly dogmatic and mythological in character. • The second Upanga, Rayapasenaijja is, however, of some literary merit, and contains a dialogue between the Jaina monk Kesi and a king, Paesi (probably Prasenajit of Kosala). • The fifth, sixth, and seventh Upangas deal with astronomy, geography, cosmology, etc. • The eighth Upanga, Nirayavalisuttam contains an interesting account of Ajatasatru, but its historical authenticity is doubtful.\n\nOther Canonical Works • The Prakirnas, deal with various doctrinal matters and are written in verse. • The Chheda Sutras deal with disciplinary rules for monks and nuns, and illustrate them by various legends. The best known work is Kalpasutra, attributed to Bhadrabahu. The Kalpasutra forms a part of the fourth Chheda Sutra and consists of three sections. Another Kalpasutra which forms the fifth Chheda Sutra is looked upon as the principal treatise on the rules of conduct of the Jaina monks and nuns. • The Mulasutras are very valuable Jaina texts. The first, the ­Uttaradhyayana Sutra, forms one of the most important portions of the canon, and contains parables, maxims, ballads and dialogues. • Among the miscellaneous canonical texts which do not belong to any group, mention may be made of Nandi Sutra and Anuyogadvara which are encyclopaedic texts, containing accounts of the different branches of knowledge pursued by the Jaina monks.\n\nNon-religious/Secular Literature The foremost in this category is Arthashastra of Kautilya of the Mauryan period. An edition of this text, written in Sanskrit on palm leaves, was rediscovered by R. Shamasastry, in 1905. This edition is dated to around 250 ce, but the contents of the book are largely of the Mauryan period. As the book is centred on the theme of statecraft, it summarizes the political thoughts of Mauryan times. The author, Kautilya, (also known as Chanakya or Vishnugupta), is often compared to Machiavelli (the Italian Renaissance thinker who wrote The Prince). The text consists of 15 books known as adhikaranas, out of which the first 5 deal with internal administration (tantra), and next 8 with inter-state relations (avapa). The last two books deal with other miscellaneous topics. The book contains detailed information about specific issues that are important for rulers for effective running of administration. Apart from emphasizing upon diplomacy and military tactics, the text also highlights the other aspects such as laws, spies, prison, taxation, irrigation, agriculture, fortifications, mining, manufacturing, trade, etc., in detail.\n\nKavya Literature Though the two great Ithihasas (Ramayana and Mahabharata) are undoubtedly the precursors of Sanskrit Kavya literature, its origin can be traced to the Vedic\n\n1.17\n\n1.18\n\nChapter 1\n\nhymns. Patanjali mentions three akhyayikiis: Vasavadatta, ­Sumanottara and Bhaimarathi. Unfortunately, we have no definite knowledge of the growth and development of Kavya in the period between the second century bce and the third century ce. The name of Kalidasa, the most celebrated Indian poet, stands high in the realm of Sanskrit lyrics. His Meghaduta is the finest work in this genre. Bhartrihari, assigned to the seventh century ce has to his credit the three Satakas, viz., the Sringara Sataka, the Niti Sataka and the Vairagya Sataka. The advocates of the theory of renaissance of Sanskrit literature sought to prove that Brahmanic culture passed through its dark age at the time when India was continuously facing foreign invasions; and that the earliest revival of this culture is to be found in the so-called golden age of the ­Guptas. ­Recent research has, however, rejected both the theory of renaissance and the concept of golden age.\n\nCourt Epics Asvaghosha, the most outstanding Buddhist writer in Sanskrit, adorned the court of Kanishka. He wrote, apart from the Buddhacharita, another epic named Saundarananda. After Asvaghosha the most celebrated Indian poet is Kalidasa. His Kumarasambhava is an epic in 17 cantos of which only the first 8 are believed to be genuine. Its theme is the marriage of Lord Siva and Uma and the birth of Karttikeya. The Raghuvamsha, another epic of Kalidasa, has 19 cantos based on the history of kings of the Ikshvakus. Bharavi, who is generally associated with the Pallavas of Kanchi and whose name is mentioned along with Kalidasa in the famous Aihole inscription (634 ce) of Pulakesin II, wrote the epic Kiratarjuniya in 18 cantos. Based on the Mahabharata, the poem describes how Ariuna obtained the Pasupata weapon from Siva. Bhatti, who belonged to the late sixth and early seventh century ce and was patronized by Sridharasena of Valabhi, composed the Bhattikavya or Ravanavadha, comprising 22 cantos, with the sole object of illustrating the rules and principles of grammar and rhetoric. Other prominent Sanskrit epics include Kumaradasa’s Janakiharana (sixth century ce) and Magha’s Sisupalavadha (eighth century ce).\n\nDrama The roots of the Sanskrit drama can undeniably be traced to Bharata’s Natya Sahatra, the earliest known book on Sanskrit dramaturgy. But the most outstanding early Sanskrit dramatist is Bhasa, whose 13 dramas have now been discovered. Though scholars widely differ on the authenticity and authorship of the plays ascribed to him, Bhasa is mentioned by Kalidasa, Bana, Rajasekhara and other later writers with great respect. His plays are taken from the two great epics and various popular tales. The plays based on the Ramayana are Pratima and Abhisheka, while Madhyamavyayoga, Dutaghatotkacha and Karnabhara are based on the Mahabharata. But it is Svapnavasavadatta which is undoubtedly the best of Bhasa’s dramas. Though the date of the famous ten-act play Mrichchhakatika, ascribed to Sudraka, is still disputed, it was definitely written after Bhasa’s Charudatta (third century ce). The name of king Sudraka is, however, found in Kalhana’s Rajatarangini,​ Somadeva’s Kathasaritsiigara and Skanda’s Purava. Kalidasa’s Malavikagnimitra, Vikramorvasiya and Abhijnanasakuntala have earned him recognition as the greatest of Indian dramatists. Particularly, his Abhijnanasakuntala, the most mature product\n\nUnderstanding Ancient Indian Sources\n\nof his genius, has gained worldwide recognition. Three dramas are attributed to Harsha, whose Ratnavali is a masterpiece. Priyadarsika and Nagananda are his other creations. Bhavabhuti, considered next only to Kalidasa, is mentioned by Kalhana as a poet in the court of king Yasovarman of Kanyakubja (736 ce). The dramas Mahaviracharita, Malatimadhava and Uttararamacharita are ascribed to Bhavabhuti.\n\nProse Literature The earliest specimens of Indian prose-writing are found in the Krishna Yajur Veda. The prose portions of the Mahabharata, the Vayu and Bhagavata P ­ uranas, and the medical compilations of Charaka are worth mentioning. The writings of Sabarasvamin and Vatsyayana are good specimens of Sanskrit prose. The extant prose literature may be divided into two classes—romance and fable. The prose-romances are of two main types, viz. Akhyayika and Katha. Dasakumoracarita of Dandin (seventh century ce) was a work of the Akhyayika type. Subandhu (early seventh century ce) wrote V ­ asavadatta. Several other secular works supplement our knowledge of Ancient India. Mudrarakshasa of Vishakhadatta gives the story of C ​ handragupta Maurya and Chanakya. It explains how the Nandas were overthrown and Chandragupta became the emperor of the Magadh. Patanjali’s Mahabhasya and Panini’s Ashtadhyayi are treatises on Sanskrit grammar but there are some occasional references to kings, republics and other political events. Harisena was the poet laureate of Samudragupta and his poetical works especially the Prashasti on the Allahabad pillar inscription throw significant light on the achievements of Samudragupta. Certain writers took the lives of royal patrons as the themes of their literary works, Bana wrote Harshacharita or ‘life of Harsha’ in prose and this book is useful not only from the point of view of political history but also for depicting the economic, social and religious life of the people of seventh century ce. Vakapati and Bilhana described the achievements of Yashovarman and Vikramaditya in the Gaudavaho and Vikramankdevacharita. Another poetical work named Ramcharita of Sandhyakar Nandi tells the story of king Rampal of Bengal. The other biographical works are the Kumarapalacharita of Hemachandra, eulogizing the king Jayasimha.\n\nEarly Indian Historical Tradition The earliest written sources that claims that history and history writing was absent in ancient India is the work of the great Muslim traveller Al-Biruni who wrote Kitab Fi Tahqiq-i-Ma Li'l-Hind in about 1020 ce. Further a fresh investigation into India’s ancient past began during the colonial rule when James Mill in his book The History of British India (1818 ce) propounded that ancient India in contrast to colonial India lacked a sense of history. However, such opinion seems irrelevant in the light of the recent researches as in ancient India, records were maintained and references were made to the past events that were believed to have happened. Early India was conscious of its past and also recorded it in various ways and forms. The emergence of a historical tradition depends on a number of factors. Initially it may take an oral form, when it comes to be written with increased literacy, its forms may change. Also, each generation shapes its historical tradition in tune with what it believes to be most worthy of preservation, thus making it difficult to locate its starting point. Hence, historical tradition may refer to those aspects of past, recorded orally or in texts, which are consciously transmitted from generation to generation carrying the sanction of antiquity and a believed historicity.\n\n1.19\n\n1.20\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe early Indian historical traditions have mainly three distinct trends. The first emerges from Puranic framework, the second from the Sramanic ideologies, especially the Buddhist and Jaina, and the third, maintained by bards, goes back to the early epics’ composition (Mahabharata and Ramayana). All these traditions contain narratives which go into the making of historical consciousness and become the basis for a collective identity. The two major terms associated with traditions relating to the past are ‘Itihasa and Purana.’ Itihasa literally means, ‘thus indeed it was’ and Purana means something which is old and includes events and stories believed to go back to ancient times. Later, around first millennium ce, the term purana was applied to a specific body of texts which focussed on religion, myths and historicity as well. Atharvaveda and Satapatha Brahmana refers to the terms itihasa and purana. The conjoint term itihasa-purana, referring to the past events that took place, is mentioned in the Brahmanas and Upanishads. Itihasa-purana is described in these texts as the fifth Veda which simply means that it has been given the status of a separate branch of knowledge. The itihasa-purana was central to the kshatriya tradition of the ruling class. The recitation of Itihasaveda and Puranaveda is recommended during the ashvamedha sacrifice. The text Arthashastra uses the term itihasa in secular terms such as purana itivritta (past events), akhyayika (narrative), udaharana (example), as well as, dharmashastra and arthashastra (ideas on both sacred and socio-economic duties). The Buddhist tradition recognizes the term itihasa and calls it a written authority. Jinasena, a ninth century author of a Jaina text, Adipurana defined itihasa as something that actually happened. The historicity of the Buddha and Mahavira was emphasized and monasteries or sangha’s activities were linked to political events and personalities. The itihasa-purana tradition also acted as a means of legitimizing status and genealogical records (vamsavalis) give lists of successions (vamsa), kinship patterns, marriage forms, geographical settlements, politico-administrative structures, etc. All these evidences suggest that early India was pretty conscious of its past, aware of the changes and bothered to record them into historical traditions. On the basis of such records, it can be said that early Indian society did have a sense of identity recorded in texts and traditions. This history, however, may not pertain to western understanding of history, yet ancient India was certainly conscious of its historical past and had a range of historical traditions based on itihasa-purana genre. At the same time, it may be inferred that it some way or the other, lacked the scientific methodology of recording the past and also some of the narratives were often mixed with mythological details which tended to weaken its potentiality as a good source of history.\n\nForeign Account There are many references to India in foreign texts as the Indian subcontinent had never been an isolated geographical region right from the early times. Since such accounts represent the perceptions of foreign scholars about India and its people, there is a need to carefully distinguish between the statements based on hearsay and those grounded in perceptive observations. There may be a possibility that the scholar, a certain opinion about the Indian way of life which had nothing to do with the actual conditions and that the scholar had concluded such things on the basis of his personal understanding based on his own country’s traditions. In fact, we come across some of such unreliable accounts about India. One such account is\n\nUnderstanding Ancient Indian Sources\n\nthe Indica of Ctesias of fourth century bce, which is full of strange and unfamiliar stories about India and its people. He wrote such account on the basis of hearsay while living in Persia as a royal physician. The Greek scholar Onesicritus who took part in the expedition of Nearchos wrote a book about India, the information of which is challenged by Starbo. Megasthenes, though a s­ cholar of repute, also tried to idealize Indian society with that of Egyptian and Greek standards which were not true. But, barring few examples that we would see in the discussion, these foreign accounts are of utmost importance for the reconstruction of India’s ancient past.\n\nGreek Account Herodotus, known as ‘Father of History’, in his Histories gives much information about the Persian and Greek Wars and Indo-Persian relations. He also tells us about the political condition of north-west India in his time which was a part of the Empire of Darius and constituted the 20th satrapy or province. The account of Ctesias is full of fables. Arrian wrote a detailed account of the invasion of India by Alexander and he based his account on the evidence of Nearchos who was the Admiral of the Fleet of Alexander. Skylax wrote a book which contains a detailed account of his voyage between the Indus and the Persian Gulf. It also gives a good deal of incidental information about India. Onesicritus took part in the expedition of Nearchos and wrote a book about India. However, Starbo considered him untruthful. Alexander’s invasion has been described by both Greek and Latin writers, such as Arrian (96–180 ce) in his The Anabasis of Alexander, Curtius (41–54 ce), Diodorus Siculus (second half of first century bce), Justin (second century) in his Epitoma and Plutarch (46–120 ce). The names of the three ambassadors sent by the Greek sovereigns to Pataliputra were Megasthenes, Deimachus and Dionysius. Megasthenes was sent by Seleucus to the court of Chandragupta Maurya. He wrote his magnum opus on India called the Indica. The original work has been lost but the later writers quoted passages from the original book and those passages have been collected to give us an idea as to what Megasthenes wrote about India. Those have been translated into English by McCrindle. The information given by Megasthenes is quite detailed on certain points. Indica describes the subcontinent as a quadrilateral-shaped country b ound by the ocean on the southern and eastern side and provides details of soil, climate, rivers, plants, animals, produce, administration, society, legends and folklore. The text refers to Indian worship of Lord Krishna as Herakles and Dionysus. It also says that Indians were so honest that ‘theft was rare in India’. Megasthenes also underlines the general prosperity of India and ‘famine never visited India’. However, one can notice Megasthenes’s tendency to idealize Indian culture by Greek standards. It seems that he, having influenced by Herodotus’s traditional classification of Egyptian society into seven classes, divided Indian society into seven categories—philosophers (Brahmanas and Shramanas), farmers, herdsmen, artisans, soldiers, overseers and councillors. Deimachus was sent from the Syrian court to Bindusara. Dionysius was sent from the Egyptian court of Ptolemy Philadelphus. The writings of Deimachus and Dionysius have been lost completely. Very few quotations from their writings have come down to us and those also refer to unimportant matters. Patrocles who was the governor of the provinces between the Indus and the Caspian\n\n1.21\n\n1.22\n\nChapter 1\n\nSea under Seleucus and Antiochus I, wrote an account of those countries including India. Strabo testifies to the veracity of his account. The unknown author of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a Greek text, made a voyage to the Indian coast around 80 ce and he has left to us a record of its ports, harbours and merchandise. This book gives us an idea of the maritime activities of the ancient Indians. Ptolemy wrote about the geography of India during the second century ce. Although his knowledge of the geography of India was defective, he gives us a lot of valuable information.\n\nLatin Account Latin documents give us some useful information about the history of Ancient India. Pliny gave an account of the Indian animals, plants and minerals in the first century ce in his book Naturalis History. Trogus Pompeius wrote a historical account known as Historiae Philippicae. Although the work is lost, some prologues to the chapters are preserved in Epitome of Justin. This book throws a flood of light on the relations of Seleucus with India and the Bactrian invasion of India. From the geographical point of view, Pomponius Mela is very important as he gives us valuable information about the geography of India.\n\nChinese Travellers’ Accounts The first recorded Chinese visit to India took place at the end of the fourth century ce. The last record left by a Chinese traveler is dated 1033 ce in a Bodh Gaya inscription. According to the Chinese Buddhist encyclopaedia, Fo-tsu-tong-ki, hundreds of Chinese travelers visited India to learn at the fountain-head of their faith, and pay homage to the Great Deliverer, Lord Buddha during his one thousand years of cultural collaboration. For that we have to turn to the accounts of three Chinese monks who came to India, they are Fa-hien, Hiuen Tsang and l-tsing. Fa-hien accompanied by the three Chinese monks, left for India in 399 ce and returned to China in 414 ce. They came by the overland route and returned by sea. During their stay, they visited many important places in north India and collected Buddhist texts which indeed was the object of their visit. Hiuen Tsang was the greatest Chinese to visit India. He started for India in 629 ce in defiance of a ban on the Chinese to leave their country and alone crossed the perilous land route to India, for which he had no guide and for long stretches had to depend on his wit, luck and determination to carry him through, till he reached Turfan. He stayed in India for 16 years and returned to China in 645 ce. He was received with great honours by Harshavardhana of whom the monk has left a good account. He lived for a considerable period at the Nalanda monastery and developed cordial relations with Indian scholars. After he left India, Hiuen Tsang and his Indian friends maintained contact through correspondence and some of these letters have been discovered. I-tsing started for India in 671 ce at the age of 37 and returned to China in 695 ce. He came by the sea route and on his way, stopped for some time at Srivijaya (Palembang in Sumatra). In India, I-tsing visited many places and spent ten years in Nalanda, mostly copying Buddhist texts, and returned to China with 400 of them.\n\nUnderstanding Ancient Indian Sources\n\nThe major drawback of these pilgrims’ accounts is that they were mainly intended for the edification of Chinese Buddhists so that the pious monks record only objects of Buddhist interest. Political history, therefore, formed no part of their accounts. This is not true of Hiuen Tsang who has given an account of the country as well as of some kings. But it should be remembered that two books go under his name; one is his Records of the Western World and the other being the Life. Of these the first was written by Hiuen Tsang but the second has a slightly different history. While resting in the evening, Hiuen Tsang used to tell his friends and disciples some of the incidents he saw in India or some other details too insignificant to find a place in his magnum opus. His student Hwui-lih diligently recorded whatever Hiuen Tsang said and later compiled them into a book form. Neither Fa-hien nor l-tsing gives us any political information and they do not even mention the names of the kings in whose realm they lived while in India. But their accounts are significant in many ways. For example Fa-hien has left the only description of a voyage in an Indian vessel, while l-tsing gives a good account of the condition of Sanskrit learning in Srivijaya. These informations are of inestimable value. Their accounts of Buddhism in India are also equally valuable for Pliny Latin Author of Naturalis History the history of Buddhism in India. These Chinese travelers left valuable accounts about what they saw. Hiuen Tsang is called the Prince of Pilgrims. He stayed in India for many years and studied at the University of Nalanda. He was patronized by Harsha and his account is rightly considered as Gazetteer of India. Fa-hien also gives us useful information about India in the reign of Chandragupta II. I-tsing visited India during the seventh century and he has left to use useful information about the social and religious condition of the people. These eminent Chinese visitors were all devout Buddhist monks, whose journey to India was merely a pilgrimage to holy lands and whose outlook was purely religious. Neither Fa-hien nor l-tsing refers to secular matters, except very incidentally nor do they even mention the name of the king or kings whose dominions were visited by them. Hiuen Tsang is not so circumscribed but gives some interesting information about his royal patron Harshavardhana and other contemporary kings of India. He also briefly refers to the political condition of the kingdom through which he passed and devotes the entire chapter to a general account of India. These are no doubt, very valuable but they form only a very small part of his extensive records which like those of Fa-hien and l-tsing are otherwise devoted to a minute and detailed description of Buddhism in India—its rituals and practices, sanctuaries and memorials, sects and doctrines, scriptures and traditions. Fa-Hien\n\nat the ruins of\n\nAshoka Palace\n\n1.23\n\n1.24\n\nChapter 1\n\nBesides these accounts, some Chinese historical works give important information about the Scythians and Yue-chis who invaded India. These are Che-ki (Historical memoirs) or Sseu-ma-tsien (first century ce). Tsien Han-Chou (History of the Early Han dynasty) by Pan-Kou and Pan Chao (end of first century ce) and the Hou-Han-Chou (History of the Later Han Dynasty) by Fan Ye (398–445 ce). The Chinese historical works contain numerous references to the movement and migration of nomadic tribes living on the borders of China and some of which eventually invaded India. These and other chronological references have been found useful in building up the framework of Indian chronology. Many original books on Buddhism were taken from India to China and translated into Chinese. Although the originals have been lost, the translations remain and those give us a lot of useful information.\n\nTibetan Account The Tibetan historian, Taranath, in his History of Buddhism, gives us a lot of valuable information about Buddhism. Tibetan works like the Mani Bka, Bum a sacred history of Tibet and Bu Stons Chos Byun, the birth of the Law in three parts, also gives us very useful information about the history of India.\n\nArchaeological Sources Archaeology is the study of human past through material remains that include structures, artifacts (portable objects made or altered by human hands such as pottery, tools, etc.), seals, coins, inscriptions, sculptures, etc. These material evidence, which is a key to understanding human behaviour and experience help us telling their stories about the people who used them. Artefacts as the product of craft traditions and a medium of knowing the lifestyles of people are rooted in a certain cultural context. Therefore, archaeologists use the term ‘culture’ in a specific and technical way that describes behaviour and activities of a group of people categorized on the basis of tools, pottery/ware, burial or assemblage such as Palaeolithic culture, painted Grey Ware culture and so on. Archaeology generally gives us anonymous history which focuses more on cultural processes than events. It is the only source of understanding prehistory and proto-history. It also furnishes details on the history of human settlements, modes of subsistence including the food people procured, the crops they grew, the tools they used and animals they hunted and domesticated. Archaeology also informs about various aspects of the history of technology such as raw materials, their sources and how artifacts were made and used. It also let us know about routes and network of exchange, trade and interaction between people living in distant areas. Coming to understanding history through archaeological sources, there are good reasons why a historical study of ancient India cannot realize its full potential on the basis of textual sources alone. First, the sources which have been used, beginning with the Rig Veda were not strictly meant to be historical sources and whatever historical information has been gleaned from them is not free from questions regarding their chronology, geographical applicability and even content. Except for the history of the kings of Kashmir written by Kalhana in the 12 century, there is no proper historical chronicle dating from the ancient period of Indian history. Not only is there a paucity of professed historical work but of very few really ancient compositions do we know with certainty the time and place of\n\nUnderstanding Ancient Indian Sources\n\norigin. Lastly, in the few works of which we have definite knowledge in regard to authorship and provenance, a great amount of space is taken up by conventional ­descriptions and it is seldom that we come across the plain downright statement of a fact. Archaeology can greatly expand the nature of the sources in the context of ancient India. Even in the areas with a much larger mass of detailed and rigorous textual documentation, archaeological research often leads to the historical landscape. In the case of ancient India, where the basic quantum and the rigour of textual documentation are comparatively limited, archaeological research becomes more than being of ordinary significance. Archaeology can also greatly change the nature of historical questions and it is here that the second reason for the significance of archaeology in ancient Indian historical research is rooted. Although modern archaeology is not afraid of handling a multitude of issue ranging from environment and subsistence to symbolism and cognition, it is primarily in the reconstruction of the story of man–land relationship through the ages that the subject excels. What to be emphasized in the context of the ancient history of such a vast land mass as the subcontinent of India is that it is only through the reconstruction of the historical development of mainland interaction in different parts of the subcontinent that the framework of a past acceptable to all segments of its population can emerge. In order to create a non-sectarian and multilingual image of ancient India, archaeology, especially aided by the scientific techniques which are now available to the cause of archaeological research, provides the most significant area of historical enquiry.\n\nEpigraphy (Inscriptions) Epigraphy is the study of inscriptions on rocks, pillars, temple walls, copper plates and other writing material. It deals with the art of writing and provides us with an instrument for conservation and transmission of historical traditions from generation to generation as they have the advantage of durability. Inscriptions are the major source for reconstructing the history and culture of ancient civilizations. It serves as primary documentary evidence to establish legal, socio-cultural, literary, archaeological, and historical antiquity on the basis of engravings. Inscriptions are of very great value as they are engraved on stone and metals which cannot be tampered without detection. Consequently, we can be sure while using the material from inscriptions that they contain what was originally written. The inscriptions also give us a correct idea of the method of writing followed at a time when they were actually inscribed. The character of their script also enables us to fix their approximate age. Location can also throw some valuable light. The difficulty of deciphering inscriptions has been overcome in most of the cases although the script of the Indus valley still, remains undeciphered. Inscriptions can be grouped under the following heads: commercial, religious and didactic, administrative, eulogistic, votive or dedicative, donative, commemorative and literary. As regards commercial inscriptions, their specimens are to be found on the Indus seals. Some of these seals must have been used for the ­stamping for commercial purposes. These seals may have been used by seafaring traders engaged in foreign trade. It seems that nigamas and shrenis which were commercial organizations had the authority of minting their coins and they must used them f​or commercial purposes. Religious and didactic inscriptions include seals and tablets of the Indus civilization which possibly were ​used as objects of worship. The inscriptions of Asoka are the best specimen of the religious and didactic inscriptions.\n\n1.25\n\n1.26\n\nChapter 1\n\nComparative Importance of Inscriptions as a Historical Source • Usually contemporaneous to the events. • More durable than manuscripts. • Information can be connected to a time and place. • Help in determining the extent of kingdoms/empires on the basis of geographical spread of a particular type of inscriptions. • The Prashastis give detailed description of dynasties and reigns of kings. • Shed light on political structure, administrative and revenue systems. • Later inscriptions also provide records of land grants. • Gupta, Chola and Pallava inscriptions found in different forms help in reconstruction of political, social and religious history of their times. With regard administrative inscriptions, mention may be made of the Sohgaura copper plate inscription of Chandragupta Maurya which suggests the State’s measures to deal with the famine conditions. Asokan edicts may be referred to as the specimen of administrative inscription. An extract from one of his inscriptions reads thus: ‘Everywhere in my dominions, the Yuktas, the Rajjukas and the Pradeshikas shall proceed on circuit tour every five years as well for this purpose (for the instruction of Dhamma) as for other businesses’. The Junagarh Rock inscription of Rudradaman I talks about Sudarshana lake to facilitate irrigation for peasants. A large number of copper plate inscriptions have been found both in the north and south, and they contain many useful administrative details. Reference may be made in this connection to the Banskhera copper plate inscription of Harsha. As regards the eulogistic inscriptions (Prashasti), they are very important from the political point of view. They contain names and genealogies of the rulers, their military, political and administrative achievements, the existence of contemporary states coming into conflict with them and the inter-state relations, the administrative system, the political ideals, etc. The one great difficulty in these inscriptions is that there is a tendency on the part of the authors to exaggerate the achievements of their patrons. The Hathigumpha inscription of king Kharavela of Kalinga belongs to the category of pure eulogy. It describes in detail the achievements of Kharavela in a chronological order. To the same category belongs the Allahabad pillar inscription of Samudragupta. Important specimens of the eulogistic types, though with some valuable information are to be found in the Nasik Cave inscription of Ushavadata, the Junagarh Rock inscription of Rudradaman I, the Mandasor Stone pillar inscription of Yashodharman, the stone inscription of Ishanvarman, the Aihole stone inscription of Pulakesin II, the Talagunda stone pillar inscriptions of Dantivarman, and Mandasor stone inscription of Kumaragupta II. A large number of votive or dedicative inscriptions have also been discovered. It is possible that some of the tablets found in the Indus valley contain votive inscriptions. The Piprahwa inscription records the dedication of the relic casket of Lord Buddha. The Besnagar Garuda Pillar inscription of Heliodoros also belongs to this category. Many of the dedicative inscriptions deal with the installation of images and the construction of temples. Reference may be made in this connection to the Mandasor inscription of the time of Kumaragupta II and the Bhittari inscription of Skandagupta and the Aihole inscription of Pulakesin II. During the period following the Gupta and Post-Gupta ages and particularly in the early medieval phase of Indian history, several kings in their inscriptions are shown protecting and promoting the traditional social order based on varnash-\n\nUnderstanding Ancient Indian Sources\n\n1.27\n\nrama dharma as their duties. Mention may be made of the royal prashastis of Samudragupta, Kumaragupta, Harshavardhana, Senas of Bengal, kings of early medieval kingdoms and the Pallava, Chalukya, Chola and Vijayanagara inscriptions, where the kings are eulogized as protector of their people, custodian of dharma and maintainers of their varna and ashramas. The king in these inscriptions is often eulogized as performer of Vedic sacrifices and remover of the kaliyuga. Since the Smritis prescribed such activities, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the references to the preservation of varnashrama system by the kings eulogized in inscriptions are, to the greater extent, the reflection of the smriti traditions. Thus, inscriptions have proved a source of the highest value for the reconstruction of the political history of ancient India. The series of Indian inscriptions open with the memorable edicts of the great Mauryan emperor Asoka, engraved on rocks and pillars throughout his vast empire. The records of Asoka form a class by themselves and contribute largely to our knowledge of the history of the period and the spirit that animated one of the greatest men that ever sat on a royal throne. The inscriptions of the post-Asokan period may be broadly divided into two classes, official and private. The official records are in most cases either Prashasti, i.e., eulogies of kinds written by their court-poets, or land-grants. The most famous example of the former is furnished by the long record of Samudragupta engraved on an Asokan pillar, now in the Allahabad fort. It describes in great detail the personal qualities and the military achievements of the great Gupta emperor and forms the chief document of his memorable region. Among other prashastis, supplying valuable historical information, mention can be made of king Vijayasena of the Sena dynasty of Bengal engraved on a slab of stone found at Deopara. Its nominal object is to record the building of a temple by Vijayasena, but it is almost wholly devoted to a panegyric of the great king, recording his victories and achievements in the most high-flown language. The Aihole inscription of Pulakesin II, the Chalukya king, belongs to exactly the same type.\n\nAncient Inscriptions temple\n\non\n\n1.28\n\nChapter 1\n\nBy far the largest number of official documents are charters conveying the sale or gift of lands. These are mostly engraved on copper plates (tamrapatra), though in very rare instances they are also found on stone pillars and in temples. These charters define the boundaries of the lands and specify the object and conditions of the grant, often enumerating other interesting details such as the price of land, the mode of its measurement, exhortations to future kings not to confiscate the grants and quotations from the scriptures threatening severe punishment after death for those who violate the grants in any way. In case where the inscriptions are engraved on rocks or objects not easily ­portable, their find-spots become of great importance as indicating the territorial jurisdiction of the king. Sometimes the records of vassal chiefs and finds of coins corroborate the claims of territorial conquests. By these and other means, it is almost always possible to make legitimate inferences from these documents about the achievements of the kings. Despite providing dateable information about political history, the epigraphic sources reflect the growth and development of art and culture to a far greater extent. They provide glimpses into sects and cults such as ajivika sect and yaksha, and naga cults that were once important and did not leave any literary text of their own. Inscriptions shed sufficient light on the history of iconography, art and architecture by helping us identifying and dating sculptures and monuments. They refer to the performing arts as reflected in the seventh century Kudumiyamalai inscription, giving detail about the musical notes used in seven classical ragas. Inscriptions from south India, especially from Tamil Nadu talk about the performance of various kinds of dances; the Nataraja temple at Chidambaram has label inscriptions portraying the dance poses of 108 sculpted figures carved on its pillars. The entire study of art, architecture and sculptures of Mauryan period (monolithic pillars and their capitals, barabar and other caves, sculptures of yakshas and yakshanis), Gandhara, Mathura and Amaravati schools of art in post-Mauryan period and temple architecture of Gupta and post-Gupta period, Pallava-Chalukya art and architecture and the three major styles of temple architecture (nagara, besara and dravida) could not have been possible without epigraphic sources. We come to know about the undeciphered script of Harappans and the deciphered scripts such as brahmi, kharoshthi in Prakrit and Pali languages, Greek and Aramaic scripts through inscriptions only. Hence, they reflect the history of language and literature.\n\nNumismatics​ Numismatics is the study of coins. To a great extent, the political, and economic history of a country is constructed by numismatics and historical facts are very often corroborated or rejected on the basis of numismatic findings. Many facts connected with administration, historical geography and religious history of ancient India are revealed to us by numismatics. A study of Indian coins enlightens us to a great deal regarding the history of ancient India. Coins are of various metals such as gold, silver and copper. The coins help us to build up the history in many ways. The coins contain the names of the kings who ruled at various times in different parts of the country. In many cases, the coins are the only source of information about the existence of certain kings. Without those coins, the very existence of those kings would have remained unknown. Many a time the information from the coins can be used to corroborate the information provided by other sources. The existence of a large number of coins issued during\n\nUnderstanding Ancient Indian Sources\n\nthe different years of the reign of a king helps us to a​ scertain exact dates of accession, extent of the kingdom and death of the kings such as Samudragupta. The earliest coins of India have only figures or symbols and no legends. Sometimes, the coins were cast in dies but very often symbols were punched on metal pieces. The symbols varied from time to time and were punched with a view to guarantee their genuineness and value. On account of the absence of legends on them, much information could not be discerned. After the Greek invasion of India, the practice of writing the names of the kings on the coins was started. A large number of coins were issued by the Indo-Bactrian rulers who had under their control over Punjab and the North-Western frontier. These coins possess a high degree of coinage. The thing borrowed in the Indian coinage was the name and the portrait of the ruler. The Greek coins refer to about 30 Greek kings and queens who ruled in India. The classical writers refer to only four rulers would have remained absolutely unknown. The coins of the Scythians and partisans are of inferior quality but they also give us a lot of historical information. Their coins have enabled us to have an outline of the history of their rulers and without them even the outlines would have been missing. A branch of the Scythi-\n\nCoinage in Ancient India • Though Rigveda and later Vedic texts talked about niskha (gold) and hiranya-pinda (gold object) which may have been metal pieces, the earliest authoritative literary and archaeological evidence of coinage dates back to 6th to 5th centuries bce when urbanization and state formations took place. • The basic unit of Indian coin weight system was gunja berry known as rattika or ratti. • The oldest coins are punched-marked coins, made mostly of silver and some of copper. They weighed 32 rattis or 56 grains (1 grain = 64.79 mg). • Punch-marked coins were generally issued by states. These coins do not have anything written on them. Only symbols of geometric designs, plants, animals, the sun, wheels, mountain, tree branches and human figures were found. • Next in the line was uninscribed cast coins made of copper or alloys of copper found at Ayodhya and Kaushambi (3rd to 2nd bce). • Next stage in the coinage is marked by the die-struck Indo-Greek coins of 2nd to 1st bce. These are round silver coins though some of them are in copper, nickel and lead. They bear the name and portrait of the rulers who issued them. Examples are coins of Menander and Strato I. The reverse of the coins had religious symbols. • The Indo-Greeks issued bilingual (Greek and Prakrit) and bi-script (Kharoshthi-Aramaic) coins. • The Kushans were the first to mint gold coins (1st to 4th centuries). They also issued copper coins of low denominations. On the front these coins bore the name and titles of the rulers and in the reverse, the deities of Brahmanical, Buddhists, Greek and Roman pantheon figured. • In the Deccan, the pre-satavahana coinage was followed by the copper and silver coins of Satavahana kings. They issued lead and potin coins as well. Most of them were die-struck, though some of them were cast coins. The legends were in Prakrit language and Brahmi script. • The Gupta kings issued well-executed and die-struck gold coins with legends in Sanskrit known as dinars (mostly found in north India). The coins of Samudragupta and Kumaragupta I depicted lute or veena on them. The reverse of Gupta coins have religious symbols (Bhagamtas). There was a decline in the metallic value of gold coins in later phase of Gupta rule. The Gupta also issued silver coins, but copper coins were rare.\n\n1.29\n\n1.30\n\nChapter 1\n\nans settled in Gujarat and Kathiawar and they issued coins in which the names of the ruling king and their fathers were mentioned in the Saka era. These coins have helped us to reconstruct the history of the western Satraps for more than three centuries. The Kushanas also issued a large number of coins. The coins have also been the principal source of our information regarding the various Indian states— both monarchical and republican—that flourished during the same period. Most of them, like the Malavas, Yaudheyas and the Mitra rulers of Panchala are known only from the coins. The coins of the Satavahana supplement, correct and corroborate the accounts of the Puranas. The Guptas, who founded the greatest empire in India after the Mauryas issued a large variety of fine coins. Although we know a great deal of their history from epigraphic records, the coins form an important additional source of information. The coins of Samudragupta are particularly remarkable. The Indian coins after the Gupta period do not give us much historical information.\n\nMonuments The ancient monuments like buildings, statues of stones or metals, ornamental and decorative fragments, pottery, etc., give us a lot of useful and reliable information. The excavation of the sites of the old towns like Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro and Taxila has given us a lot of information hitherto unknown and changed our conception of the history of ancient India. It is after the discovery of the Indus valley civilization that we began to talk of a civilization in India prior to that of the Aryans. The excavations at Taxila throw welcome light on the Kushanas. A study of the sculptures found from there highlights the importance of Gabdhara School of Art. The digging of the old sites of Pataliputra gives us some information regarding the old capital of the Mauryas. The Angkor Vat temple complex in Cambodia and Borobudur in Java bear testimony to the commercial and cultural activities of the Guptas. The excavations at Sarnath have added to our knowledge about Buddhism and Asoka. The excavations in Chinese Turkistan and Baluchistan by Aurel Stein prove the intimate contacts of India with those territories. The progress of archaeological work in India in the future is bound to enrich our knowledge of ancient Indian history.\n\nMohenjo-Daro\n\nPrevious Years’ Questions: How to Approach Previous Years’ Questions: How to Approach\n\n1.31\n"
