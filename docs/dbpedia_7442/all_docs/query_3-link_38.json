        "text": "JALALABAD (Pajhwok): Power and energy officials in eastern Nangarhar province say the Daronta hydropower dam will be rehabilitated in 2021 at a cost of $10.5 funded by the World Bank.\n\nGhulam Haidar Faqeerzai, the provincial power and energy director, said the Daronta dam’s reconstruction would increase its power generation to its initial capacity.\n\nHe said the contract for reconstruction of the dam had been awarded to an Iranian firm which would complete the project in two years\n\nHe said completion of the project would help overcome electricity shortage problem in Nangarhar.\n\n“The Daronta power plant is actually being restored. Turbines or machines that are analog will be replaced with digital machines. This will increase the capacity of the power plant and lead to a huge difference.”\n\nAmal Shinwari, in charge of Daronta dam, said the dam’s reconstruction would begin in 2021 and would last two or two and a half years.\n\n“The Iranian company will complete the $10.5 million project. The firm will initially design machines, then produce the machines, then transport them to the site and install them,” he explained.\n\nSamiullah, a resident of Jalalabad, the provincial capital, said there was no electricity in areas connected to Daronta dam.\n\nAbaseen, a resident of Daronta area, said water storage capacity of the dam was less, its machines did not work properly so it produced less power but its reconstruction would address all these issues.\n\nsa/ma"
