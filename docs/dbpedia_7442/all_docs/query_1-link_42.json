        "text": "The Kabul river is a classical cophen. The length of the Kabul river is 700 km (430 mi) and appears in the Sanglakh range of the Hindu Kush mountains in the northeastern region of Maidan Warsak province, Afghanistan. It is segregated from the watershed of the Helmand River by the Unai Pass. The Kabul river evacuates its water into the Indus River near Attock, Pakistan. Kabul is the principal river of eastern Afghanistan and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan. It is one of the most important rivers in Pakistan.\n\nKabul River Route\n\nThe River appears in the Sanghlakh Range 45 miles ( 72 km ) west of Kabul city; it flows east past Kabul and Jalalabad, north of Khyber Pass into Pakistan, and Past Peshawar. It merged with the Indus River northwest of Islamabad.\n\nLocation\n\nThe river originates from the District Chitral and moves to Afghanistan. The Kabul river is also known as Sarchashma in its upper reaches. The main streamlet of the Kabul rivers is the Logar, Panjshir, Alingar, Surkhab, Bara, Kunar, and Swat rivers.\n\nWhat is the Kabul river famous for?\n\nThe river is famous for its water utilization. About 20 million people in Afghanistan and Pakistan depend on the River for drinking water, Hydropower Generation, irrigation, livelihood, and other amusement activities.\n\nTributaries of the Kabul River\n\nThe melting glaciers of the Hindu kush range in Afghanistan, Chiantar, and Chitral form a small tributary that passes from the valley of Kunhar and Chitral. Kunar river contributes significantly to the river after merging with it at Jalalabad. Chitral glaciers nourish the Kunar river, which forms the Mastuj river, joins the Bashgal river, and ultimately merges with the Kabul river. The Major tributaries of the Kabul river are Logar, Panjshir, Alingar, Surkhab, Kunar, Bara, and Swat river.\n\nDams built on the Kabul River in Pakistan\n\nDetail of the Dams built on the Kabul river is given below.\n\nNaghlu Dam\n\nThe Naghlu Dam is a gravity Dam located on the Kabul river in the District of Surobi in Kabul Province, Afghanistan. The distance of this Naghlu dam from the capital Kabul is 40 km ( 25 mi ). The Major objective of this Dam is to produce Hydroelectricity. This dam aids a power station with a design capacity of 100 MW of electricity. The National grid of Afghanistan is linked with Naghlu Dam, a giant power plant in the country. It supplies electricity to approx—100000 households in the region of Kabul. The height of Naghlu Dam is 110 m ( 361 ft ), and the length is 280 m ( 919 ft )and has a storage capacity of 550,000,000 m3. The Afghan Ministry of Energy and Water managed and controlled the Naghlu dam and its reservoir. The Soviet Union financed the construction of the Naghlu Dam between January 1960 and 1968.\n\nDarunta Dam\n\nThe Darunta Dam is situated on the Kabul River near Darunta, approximately 7 km ( 4.3 mi ) west of Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan. The Soviet Union (USSR) companies financed the construction of the Darunta Dam in 1964. The Darunta Dam power station consists of three vertical Kaplan turbines(six-blade propellers ) that produce an output of 3.85 megawatts ( 5,160 hp ) each.\n\nWarsak Dam\n\nWarsak Dam is a solid concrete gravity dam on the Kabul River in the Peshawar valley, about 20 km northwest of Peshawar City in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Warsak Dam was accomplished under Colombo Plan, which has two phases, and the Government of Canada financed it. The first stage consisted of constructing the Warsak dam, which was completed in 1960. Tunnels for irrigation and fitting four power generation units, each unit having a capacity of 40 MW with a 132 kV transmission system, were also completed in 1960. Another two generating units of 41.48 MW capacity were installed in 1980-81 in the second Phase. The accumulated installed capacity of the Warsak Dam Hydropower project is 243 MW.\n\nPak-Afghan Treaty and Kabul River\n\nThis treaty to manage the river basin would benefit both the countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan, but deep mistrust and circumspection needs to be improved or more robust. Pakistani officials and experts have repeatedly given calls for negotiation and suggestions, but Afghanistan did not respond in kind. Both countries plan to utilize their water assets to meet their water, food, and electricity requirement against the rapidly increasing population.\n\nWhere is the Kabul River?\n\nThe River appears in the Hindu Kush, gaining significant flow from the Kunar. Many small rivers arising in Pakistan’s Chitral region flow east past Kabul and Jalalabad before entering Pakistan. In Pakistan, the Kabul river is expanded by the Swat River and its tributaries before it evacuates into the Indus at Attock.\n\nKabul River in Afghanistan\n\nThe River contributes a fourth of Afghanistan’s freshwater. Most significantly, five million residents of Kabul and Jalalabad depend on Kabul water for all their needs. Only 28% of Afghan families are connected to power supply systems, suffering greatly from severe electricity shortages. Dams produce less than 300 megawatts of electricity.\n\nKabul River in Pakistan\n\nIn Pakistan, the Kabul river and its streamlet are vital for meeting the drinking water and hygiene needs of the more than two million residents of Peshawar, irrigation in the small but fertile Peshawar valley, and the Sub-region of Tank, D.I.Khan, Banuri, and North Waziristan. This river helped produce 250 MW of electricity in the Warsak dam in 1960 and later extended to produce more. Significant factors, like growing population, poor infrastructure, budget deficit, and, lately, harmful effects of climate change, led to a drastic decline in water availability in Pakistan.\n\nKabul Basin Treaty\n\nBoth countries only discussed the water issue when Afghan Finance Minister Hazrat Omer Zakhilwal visited in August 2013. As per the media report, the two counties had jointly agreed to construct and manage a vast 1200- 1500 MW hydropower project on the Kunhar River, but no one pursued or taken any follow-up. Pakistani government established a technical committee in 2003 and 2005 to draft a water treaty with Afghanistan. Still, it did not proceed due to a shortage of data on the river flow in the Kabul Basin. The World Bank responded positively to a joint request by Islamabad and Kabul. Recently it congregated informal conferences between water experts of the two countries in Abu Dhabi, but the result still needs to be clarified. The World Bank is qualified to support Afghanistan and Pakistan in negotiating and sorting out a Kabul Basin Treaty. Cooperation in using the Kabul Basin water would benefit both countries.\n\nWhat to pack for visiting Kabul River Tourist Spots\n\nThe tourists must-have essentials that help fulfill their needs and are rarely available.
