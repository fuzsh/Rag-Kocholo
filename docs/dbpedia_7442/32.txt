Darunta Dam is an important hydroelectric dam located approximately 7 kilometers northwest of Jalalabad, in the Nangarhar Province of Afghanistan. This concrete gravity dam on the Kabul River has both historical significance and serves as a critical infrastructure for the region's power supply. Built between 1952 and 1953 by the Soviet Union, the Darunta Dam stands as a testament to the developmental efforts in Afghanistan during the mid-20th century. The facility's design primarily serves the purpose of hydroelectric power generation, aiding in the economic development of the region by providing a steady supply of electricity. The Kabul River, which it harnesses, is a major river in eastern Afghanistan that flows into the Indus River in Pakistan. Over the years, maintenance issues and damage from conflict have affected the dam's operation, highlighting the need for rehabilitation to improve capacity and reliability. The surrounding environment is rugged, with dry, arid landscapes that showcase the typical features of Afghanistan's geographical terrain.
