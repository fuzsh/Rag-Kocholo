"Cry No More" is Mika Nakashima's 17th single, which replaced Chitose Hajime's Kataritsugu Koto as the closing theme for the anime Blood+. It is a blues-inflected single, and was recorded in the USA. "Black & Blue" was used in CMs that aired in early 2006 by KATE. This single reached #8 on Oricon charts.

The music of the song was written by Lensei, an Australian musician, who also wrote the music for Nakashima's song "Rocking Horse", which was released as an album track on her album 'Music'.
