I miss her since her retirement but I still play her entire discography often since her music is comfort for me. I think everyone knows of her but it's a shame that newer fans will not get a chance to see her LIVE in concert, because that's where she truly shined. Her discography starting from PLAY (2007) until Genic (2015) was so amazingly fun and diverse.\n\nOne of my other all time favorite Japanese artist/musician that is both Jpop and J-rock is Cocco. She's been around since the 90's too (and also from Okinawa) + still going strong, with a new album released this year, called PROM. Such an outstanding discography - I hope you can check her out if you haven't. I'll just link 3 of my favorites among her vast discography:\n\nひとひら:\n\nExternal Content www.youtube.com\n\nContent embedded from external sources will not be displayed without your consent.\n\nThrough the activation of external content, you agree that personal data may be transferred to third party platforms.
