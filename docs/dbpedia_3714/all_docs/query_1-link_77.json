        "text": "In this article, I look at Japanese rock and pop rock artists/bands that have risen to fame in the past decade in the era after the Japanese “band boom.” Artists who, to this day, still possess a growing fanbase and are garnering a global following for recent hits.\n\n1. BBHF\n\nBBHF is a band made up of core members originally from the band Galileo Galilei, formed in Hokkaido in 2018 by the Galileo Galilei brothers, frontman Ozaki Yuuki, drummer Ozaki Kazuk and accompanied by guitarist DAIKI. They are seriously underrated in the Japanese rock scene; however, I believe with such a talented roster of experienced musicians, the band will only continue to grow and make more hit songs like “メガフォン”.\n\nSound-wise, this band fulfills the traditional elements of rock with a guitar-led sound but deviates from the traditional message of rock music and the visual kei era of Japanese rock music.\n\nSongs to check out:\n\nSimple\n\n愛を感じればいい\n\nメガフォン\n\n2. Official Hige Dandism / Official髭男dism\n\nOfficial Hige Dandism is a pop-rock band from Matsue, Shimane formed in 2012. The band comprises lead vocalist and pianist Fujihara Satoshi, drummer Matsuura Masaki, bassist and saxophonist Narazaki Makoto, and guitarist Ozasa Daisuke.\n\nThe band made their official debut with the label Lastrum in 2015 with the hit mini-album “Love to Peace wa Kimi no Naka” (ラブとピースは君の中). They would go on to release the single “No Doubt” and the album “エスカパレード” (Escaparade) in 2018, followed by the critically acclaimed single “Pretender” in 2019, which would lead them to become nationally renowned.\n\nPretender would rank number one for seven weeks on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 and would spend thirty-four weeks at number one on the streaming chart.\n\nThey would gain further global recognition with the song “Cry Baby” featured in the album “Editorial” in 2021. The song would become the opening soundtrack to the popular anime Tokyo Revengers.\n\nTheir hype is well deserved as their sound is carefully crafted to capture pop rock’s essence.\n\nSongs to check out:\n\nWhite Noise\n\nSubtitle\n\nCry Baby\n\n3. The Peggies\n\nThe Peggies is an all-female Japanese rock band formed in 2011 in Kawasaki, Kanagawa. Initially signed to Poppo Express, the band now releases under Epic Records Japan. They would release their first album in 2014, “Goodmorning in Tokyo,” establishing themselves in the rock scene.\n\nThe Peggies are most recognized for their contributions to anime soundtracks; many of their songs have become worldwide hits in popular animes like Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai, Rent-A-Girlfriend, and My Hero Academia.\n\nSongs to check out:\n\nLOVE TRIP\n\nCentimeter\n\nKiminosei\n\n4. My First Story\n\nMy First Story is a Japanese rock band formed in 2011 in Shibuya, Tokyo, by vocalist Hiro, bass guitarist Nob and guitarist Teru who would later be joined by drummer Kid’z. The band debuted in 2012 with the album “My First Story” under Label INTACT RECORDS. They have since released 12 albums, one EP and 19 singles and have risen to fame, making several performances across Japan and even playing as a supporting act for Fall Out Boy’s “Mania Tour.”\n\nSongs to check out:\n\nLove Letter\n\nKimi no Inai Yoru wo Koete (君のいない夜を越えて)\n\nKing & Ashley\n\n5. The Oral Cigarettes\n\nThe Oral Cigarettes are a Japanese alternative rock band formed in Nara Prefecture in 2010, making it one of the older bands in this list. The band would debut in 2013 with the mini-album “オレンジの抜け殻、私が生きたアイの証” and would sign with the label A-Sketch, releasing three EPs, 11 albums, one compilation and 20 singles.\n\nOne song, “Kyouran Hey Kids!!,” would be used as the opening soundtrack for the viral anime Noragami, garnering over 150 million listens on Spotify alone.\n\nSongs to check out:\n\nKyouran Hey Kids!!\n\nKizukeyo Baby\n\nMiss Tail\n\n6. Cö Shu Nie\n\nCö Shu Nie is a Japanese rock duo formed in Osaka in 2011. The duo includes vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist Miku Nakamura, bassist Shunsuke Matsumoto, and previously included members Kōjirō Yamazaki and Ryōsuke Fujita.\n\nCö Shu Nie would sing with Sony Music Japan in 2018, making their debut with the label with the hit single “Asphyxia”.

Next Music From Tokyo describes how the vocalist, Satou, deviates from traditional shoegaze “Some songs harbour the soft ethereal drone of classic shoegazer, but their hallmark is the dynamic range of Sato’s hauntingly beautiful vocals that soar skyward with passion and intensity.”\n\nSongs to check out:\n\nWhy\n\n&\n\nクロノスタシス\n\n10. Sumika\n\nLastly, Sumika, a Japanese rock band formed in Kawasaki, Kanagawa, in 2013.
