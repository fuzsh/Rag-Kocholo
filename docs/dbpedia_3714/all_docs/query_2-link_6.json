        "text": "\"YES\" is Nakashima Mika's fourth album, and her first released in both CD+DVD and CD only versions. The CD+DVD version is limited edition, and features a DVD with all of the music videos for the album (except for Sunao na Mama's PV, which wasn't released at the time), housed in a three-sided box and a note about how to preorder tickets for Nakashima Mika's country-wide tour, 'Concert Tour 2007 YES MY JOY', before others due to your purchase. Compared to her previous works, YES features a much slower, more gospel sound to it. The song Sunao na Mama was released as a single on the same day as the album. DANCE WITH THE DEVIL was used as the KATE CM song (featuring Nakashima herself in the commercials) from February 2007 onwards. YES sold a total of 296,175 copies, making it #34 album of 2007 on the Oricon yearly chart."
