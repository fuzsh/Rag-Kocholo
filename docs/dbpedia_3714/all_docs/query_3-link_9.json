        "text": "Who was songwriter Vincent Ford?\n\nAlthough Bob Marley is assumed to have written the song on his own, as its lyrics are highly personal, it was actually credited to Vincent Ford.\n\nFord was a friend of Marley's who ran a soup kitchen in Trenchtown, the ghetto area of Kingston, Jamaica, where Marley grew up.\n\nThis meant that all royalty payments received by Ford allowed his work to continue.\n\nThe album's liner notes list multiple songwriters, including other family friends and band members, but all songs were written by Marley. At the time, Marley was involved in a contractual dispute with his former publishing company, Cayman Music.\n\nMarley didn't want his new songs to be associated with Cayman, and it had been speculated that he had put them in other people's names to avoid the contractual restrictions, and as a way to \"provide lasting help to family and close friends\".\n\nMarley's former manager Danny Sims later sued to gain royalty and ownership rights to the songs, saying that Marley had written the songs but had assigned the credit to Ford, to avoid commitments made in previous contracts.\n\nA 1987 court sided with the Marley estate, assuming full control of the songs.\n\nFord died aged 68 in 2008, in Kingston.\n\nWhat is the song about?\n\nBob Marley & The Wailers - No Woman, No Cry (Live At The Rainbow 4th June 1977)\n\nThe title 'No Woman, No Cry', means 'Woman, don't cry'. The title alludes to telling a woman not to cry.\n\nThe lyric has been misunderstood by those outside of Jamaica to mean something like \"if there is no woman, there is no reason to cry\", or having secret feelings towards women.\n\nIn the song, Marley mentions the Government Yards of Trench Town, a public housing project in Kingston where he grew up. The lyrics also include references to cornmeal porridge, a popular breakfast in Jamaica.\n\nWailers bassist Aston 'Family Man' Barrett told NME in 2012: \"The song is about the strength in the mama of course, strength in the ladies. And we love a woman with a backbone. Something like a wishbone!\n\n\"They have to be like a she lion! Woman strong, you know, not depending on the man. Of course the man is there to help you, then for every successful man, there is a good woman.\""
