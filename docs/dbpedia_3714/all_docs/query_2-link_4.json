        "text": "Having followed Mika’s music career since her debut album “True” – and I just realize that I have all 6 of her albums! – “Voice” has got to be the most appealing, most infectious of all. To be honest, I was surprised because although from time to time there are great music albums in the market that delight, rarely are there albums that I would put on repeat for a relatively long period of time (yes, if there is no time factor, I often hold back my opinion until the initial excitement subsides).\n\nI wonder what Mika Nakashima fans like about her. Maybe her look or her voice (both I am OK with, not too excited about). Her music style is mostly pop, recently into rock with “The End”. What I in particularly like about Mika is her ability to sing some uniquely out of the world kind of music scale, kind of timing, that is so unheard of. The beginning of the 8th track “It’s Too Late” is a good example. Is this style called club jazz? Maybe. It doesn’t appear often. But when it does, it tickles in a good way.\n\nTo tell the truth, I can hardly remember what her first 3 albums sound like. Except, they are pleasant to listen to, with unique style. Her venture into rock genre collaborated with other Japanese musicians in her 4th album “The End”, to me, is refreshingly new. Although I like it a lot, the chart didn’t agree with me. Came the 5th one “Yes” that is back to her old style. I am OK with that, and the chart wasn’t that happy with it neither. Her only two albums that did not manage to reach #1.\n\n“Voice” is back to #1 and I can understand why. It has a health dose of pop and synthetic rock. There is one track mostly with just her and the piano (final track) and another one with the acoustic guitar (middle track). It also has a health dose of rock music that unlike “The End”, the music does not overpower her voice. In nearly all the tracks, there are tunes that are mind sticking, making the album sounds interesting. True to her nature as shown in her previous albums, “Voice” is fun to listen to. My favorite track? The all English number “I Don’t Know” (hence the title of this review).\n\nMy CD comes with a DVD too and it has 6 music videos. More like 5 and a half as the last song is like a short promotional track. It has a mellow version of “SAKURA ～花霞～” instead of the Daishi Dance version in the album. If you are a Mika fan, you really ought to get this one.\n\nSome Japanese artists are so productive. Not long ago back in January I wrote a review for Nana Starring Mika Nakashima. Turns out that the new rock sound from her one-off-band assembled during the filming of Nana and Nana 2 is also … one off. How disappointing for me as I do enjoy her new sound. In her new album, she is back to her original light and mellow style. Fans who like her rather fragile (or weak depending how you view it) and soothing vocal will continue to support her career – even for mildly disappointed fans like me.\n\nThe album opens with the song “I Love You” (feel free to follow the YouTube link to sample) – a typical Mika Nakashima song that just can’t go wrong. Her latest single “Sunao na Mama (素直なまま)” – an upbeat song – turns out to be one of my favorite songs from the album. Unfortunately, this wonderful video is not featured in the DVD that comes with the CD. In this new album “Yes”, Mika Nakashima has also put in some heavy gospel influenced songs such as “Cry No More” and “All Hands Together”. As recorded in her DVD, she performed “What A Wonderful World” live inside a Chapel. I found the video pretty powerful. While I cannot find the same clip from YouTube, there is a live performance that is very closed to the DVD version – vocal-wise that is.\n\nIf you are already a fan of hers, why not “Yes”. If you happen to like her voice, perhaps it is time for you to check out her new album?\n\nLately, there aren’t many good English albums around and though you may see Japanese albums keep popping up in my website, Japanese CDs only contribute to less then 5% of my CD collection, believe it or not.\n\nFans of Mika including me are shocked that she has ventured into the genre of rock music when time after time, she delivers pop to pop-jazz albums. The band “Nana Starring Mika Nakashima” was formed from a live-action show “Nana” (which subsequently has a sequel called “Nana 2”) that Mika has acted in based on the manga of the same name. This album “The End” is Nana Starring Mika Nakashima’s debut and their last album (hence … the end).\n\n“The End” is written by a number of famous Japanese artists such as L’Arc~en~Ciel’s front-man Hyde, Glay’s leader Takuro, as well as the manga’s author, Ai Yazawa. The melody of the entire album is catchy and I find myself repeating listening it again and again.\n\nThe song 一色 (One Colour) as played below is the theme song for the movie “Nana 2”. In the album, there is a faster version that I like better. Nevertheless, this version is well-liked by many. I often find it odd when such a soothing voice meets with the rock music tracks. Perhaps it is what makes this album stands out as different.\n\nMy favourite track is the last track called “My Way” that is a complete rewrite of the English oldie. I guess they picked the song because it fits the theme of the album well with the beginning of “And now the end is near …”. It is a live recording when the band just jammed out the song for fun – which is very fun even to listen to. There are mistiming, doubtful reaching of high notes, and hilarious lyrics. I don’t remember the original version has the F words as well as killing a cat that they have tastefully censored with a beep.\n\nIf you like catchy tunes in a rock music background with a not-so-rock female voice, “Nana Starring Mika Nakashima” is for you."
