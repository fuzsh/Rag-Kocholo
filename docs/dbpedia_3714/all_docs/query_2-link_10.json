        "text": "My opinion on the Hankyung situation:\n\nThis isn't exactly his fault. But neither is he completely innocent. I've always been in the group of people who felt somewhat betrayed by the lawsuit, but decided to support him in his endeavors anyway. It's been almost a year and the issue almost seems to have died down, with an almost peaceful atmosphere on both sides. Hankyung tries not to talk about SME more than he has to (but reporters are nosy, of course), and I've yet to see him \"badmouth\" SME, SJ, or Korea. He does indeed criticize the management and recount times where he felt he was mistreated, but he always finishes off by saying he does not regret his time in Korea and that he's thankful for the opportunity SM gave him. He's been respectful in that aspect at least.\n\nHowever, the recent CF controversy has been somewhat of a disappointment. It's true it was originally filmed in Chinese, and that the reason for the Korean dub was irrelevent, this whole mess was handled rather badly. Everyone ought to know how Hankyung is inextricably linked to any references of Korea by now, and how sensitive the issue is. Either they shouldn't have dubbed it, or they shouldn't have chosen him as the model. He himself should have realized the implications of the CF. Even if he didn't mean to offend on purpose, I dont think anyone should be surprised by the reaction the CF got. And so, even though Hankyung didn't do anything explicitly wrong, he should still make a public statement or apology to clear the mess up. If not for his benefit, then for the fans he left back in Korea, who at the moment are feeling used. Hankyung is too caring to have just forgotten about everyone who helped build him up to this moment. Or at least, I hope he is.\n\nOn another note...\n\nOh god, the Kangin pictures. I think I'm about to cry. He looks SO GOOD! He's really lost a lot of weight and he just seems so much brighter and healthier and... oh... *sniffle*\n\nI miss you so much T-T\n\nMy opinion on the Hankyung situation:\n\nThis isn't exactly his fault.

As of now, though i wont say i have been following Hangeng's every activities, but in my memory, i have not seen a vid or read anything abt him badmouthing sm or korea. if any, he credited what's of his current accomplishments to sm as well. so, he's definitely not ungrateful, if that's what some of us here are thinking or implying.\n\nim not pleased with the \"hype\" around the cf now as well.\n\nand i hope, an action will be taken soon and pls, i hope the management wont place this as those that will die down after some time cause i dont think this will given the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nand besides, i think it's only reasonable that Hangeng make a statement(apology) of some sort to the fans who have been supporting him, especially in Korea.\n\n--\n\n^\n\nHeechul's tweets make me smile.\n\nwhy is he soooooo ridiculously adorably random ?\n\nand i have managed to get 4 tickets for the SS3 in Singapore,\n\nit's mosh pit though... and i have no idea what to expect from that ....\n\nAnd it was clarified that the CF WAS originally in chinese,but then the CF dubbed the women...I dun know whether this was done why the advertising company or by those anti...And you guys can go to allkpop for more details.\n\nI understand that as Hankyung fans, we all want to protect him against any criticism even our own (which is why I haven't said a single thing in the past 11 months about it since the lawsuit took place... until now), but come on. Dubbed by anti's?? Why did the CF folks give a response to the controversy and explain about the dubb if they didn't do it?\n\nBut even if we say that the CF was dubbed and Hankyung didn't know it was going to be dubbed when it was filmed, there is no way to claim that Hankyung was unaware of the premise of the CF. The banner ON STAGE in the CF is in Korean. To say that Hankyung, who has lived in Korea for over 5 years, couldn't tell the difference between Korean and Chinese writing would be ridiculous. Going on a set, knowing that the general idea of the CF was about an angry and put-upon employee revolting against his boss and the set has Korean writing??? You'd have to be a complete moron not to know what the CF was trying to imply.\n\nAs an aside, the LAST PLACE ON EARTH I'd go for more details of any kind is allkpop. They don't have the best track record for accurate reporting of Korean news.\n\nOn a happier note, the SBS PowerFM concert MCed by Heechul....\n\nhttp://www.artsnews.co.kr/news/116655\n\nhttp://www.reviewstar.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=245721\n\nhttp://www.artsnews.co.kr/news/116652\n\nNew SM The Ballad photo.\n\nPreview of S.M.

After seeing PSY who was singing \"Champion\", (I) asked my friends \"Want to try becoming a celebrity?\" After which, (I) went for an audition in SM Entertainment.\" Therefore, having the chance to debut, specifying PSY as the one who led him in becoming a singer, surprised everyone.\n\nTowards MC Yoon Joon Shin's question \"Why did you decided to become a singer only after watching PSY?\", Kim Heechul could not answer and said \"I love music originally.\" The MCs then made a guess stating \"Is it because of the mindset: 'That person is also considered as a celebrity'?\", PSY became hyped up and said \"I'm the one who brought huge hopes to those unspecified singers.\", bringing continuous laughter in the studio.\n\nIn addition, MC Kim Gura joked and said \"When I saw PSY (as a singer), I thought 'Indeed, it's the end of the world.' \", again enticing laughter in everyone.\n\nSource: reviewstar\n\nChinese translation: 宝妮妮 @ i1380.com\n\nEnglish translation:~♡ 혁-fied @ SJ-WORLD.NET\n\nTAKE OUT WITH FULL AND NO ADDITIONAL CREDITS.\n\ni couldn't be happier he's there as guest mc at the right moment when psy was promoting and become a guest, somehow i think his great relationship with kim gura pitched him at the right time\n\nthank u psy for inspired heechul to go to an audition!\n\ni can somehow imagine him seeing this unique guy on tv and think, hey, there is a place for this kind of character (like his own character) on tv, might as well try it, even kim gura hasn't been on tv at 2002\n\nand boy oh boy, HeeMC made in many news, isn't it, his wardrobe is like snape, or i just called him Heechulus Black, jedi master of wink\n\nwith fellow mc park so hyun\n\nwink master\n\nas for geng's case, many posters here said enough, the matter of dub or not is not a huge explanation since the cf concept itself is quite obvious, even if the banner's not in korean, to me, the concept just, so unwise considering he's still in court with sm, and i'm truthfully so sad that many elf bashing on kim jang hoon, somehow that feels so wrong ...\n\nand so agree with @Jae Ho, aion has much prettier and subtle soft movement than this game portrayed in cf ... or maybe the real games is better ... bad cf then\n\n101122 Kangin Jinjoo Army concert famcams\n\nsorry sorry\n\nCredit: 류지나 | reup by: joyyil @YT\n\n~*TAKE OUT WITH CREDIT*~\n\nA Short Journey http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=FCJa3kWiAT0\n\ncredit: cr KF | Reup by: maisao0210 @YT\n\n101122 Youngstreet with Kyuhyun\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/2pinkninja#p/u/7/QkZ7DXQhUm4\n\ncr: 七禾页 @ TUDOU ; TAKE OUT WITH FULL AND PROPER CREDIT\n\nSuper Junior Super All-rounder Idol!\n\n“Super Junior is open all year round”\n\nTheir name says it all ‘Super Junior’. 5 years since debut, hit idol group Super Junior finished their 4th album activities last June. Their 10 active members have been constantly working in many different areas.\n\nMembers Siwon, Sungmin, Donghae and Shindong all went out to become actors at the same time. Donghae (picture above) in the SBS produced drama ‘It’s alright, Daddy’s daughter’ will start greeting viewers with it’s first broadcast on November 22. Despite having a hard live, he lives with a strong sense of faith and responsibility as a youth.\n\nKBS 2TV drama ‘President’ will start it’s broadcast on December 8 where Sungmin plays the role of Jang Sungmin, Choi Soo Jong’s son. SBS drama, ‘Athena: Goddess of War’ where Siwon transformed into a secret police, is also set to air on the same date.\n\nYesung and Kyuhyun broadens their stage through musicals. Yesung’s award-winning singing and acting skills in ‘Namhan Mountains’ and ‘Hong Gil Dong’ landed him a spot in ‘Spamalot: Knights of the Round Table’ performing at Seoul Arts Centre until January 2 next year. Unlike Yesung, Kyuhyun’s first musical stage, ‘The 3 Musketeers’ is set to begin on December 15 in Seoul’s Grand Theatre Hall. Kyuhyun will be playing the role of ‘D’ Artagnan’.\n\nLeeteuk, Eunhyuk and Heechul will further their skills and show the progress to their listeners through their well-loved radio programs.
