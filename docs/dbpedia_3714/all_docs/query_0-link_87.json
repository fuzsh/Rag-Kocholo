I wanted to look them up but it's not letting me copy & paste from the player and I can't speak/type any Japanese to check out more from the rest haha.\n\nHere's the tracklist with english artist names in brackets:\n\n(((さらうんど))) [(((sssurrounddd)))] - 乙zz姫 (Sleeping Beauty Part3)\n\nサ上と中江 [Saue to Nakae] - Too Shy Boy\n\nORLAND - Trust Me!\n\nさよならポニーテール [Sayonara Ponytail] - 放課後えすけいぷ\n\nテンテンコ [Tentenko] - Good bye,Good girl.\n\nNegicco - 二人の遊戯\n\nSugar's Campaign - 有名な映画のようにラブリーな恋がしたい\n\nEspecia - Boogie Aroma\n\n土岐麻子 [Asako Toki] - Kung Fu Girl\n\n西恵利香 [Erika Nishi] - MUSICを止めないで\n\nバクステ外神田一丁目 [Backstage Sottokanda Icchome] - 甘い誘惑デインジャラス\n\n東京女子流 [Tokyo Girls' Style] - 加速度\n\nShiggy Jr. - サマータイムラブ\n\n星野みちる [Michiru Hoshino] - ちょっと SOMETHING NEW\n\nONIGAWARA - Darlin’\n\n一十三十一 [Hitomitoi] - カナリア気分で\n\nSo after I'd basically accepted the loss of MiChi from the Japanese music scene, she's just announced her first live date in 2 years - with Sony music. I honestly presumed she'd been dropped after she struggled to sell more than 500 copies of some singles. She also did another episode of her radio show for the first time in a while. Pair this with her recent return to Tokyo from her NYC exile and the photo with her producers, and I can't help but feel like something might be in the works.\n\nI'm not ready to commit to being perched, but certainly something could be on the way.\n\nThat would be good news. Also maybe a bit confusing because there's a new girl now who goes by the same name just all capitalized."
