        "text": "Ongaku To You's Songs, Artists, and New Artists of the Year for 2021!\n\n2021 was a very interesting year for the Japanese music industry and we at Ongaku to You would like to praise the songs and artists that helped us traverse this amazing year. Each member broke down the year in three categories; Song of the Year, New Artist We Discovered in 2021, and lastly our Artist of the Year. We hope that 2022 will bring many surprises to the Japanese music industry like we received in 2021!\n\nLuna’s Top Song and Artists of 2021!\n\nSong of the Year: “JOYRIDE” by Miliyah Kato\n\nWhen I first heard 'JOYRIDE', I was immediately pulled in by the lyrics as they are sad, emotional, and make a tremendous impact. Miliyah's vocals fit 'JOYRIDE' perfect in every aspect; she knows how to hit each note matching with the melody of the song. Miliyah's vocals, lyrics, the melody all come together making it a song that makes an impact. 'JOYRIDE' has personally made that impact moving me to tears and it has made its way onto my playlist on repeat.\n\nNew Artist of the Year: BRIDEAR\n\nBRIDEAR was a pleasant surprise finding out about this year. They were recommended to me by several people in the JME music group and also popped up on my Apple Music recommendations. I started listening to their Baryte album, which pulled me into checking out more of their music. The tracks \"Ghoul\" and \"Mirror\" made the biggest impacts on me. I enjoy metal but I don't listen to it as often, however, when I do, BRIDEAR is the type of band I enjoy listening too. Vocals, compositions, lyrics - all the members blend so good together when creating music. Ever since I did MC on them, I've add them in my rotation.\n\nArtist of the Year: CREAM\n\nThis year, I dived deep into the Hip-Hop/R&B fusiion scene and CREAM became a huge part of my playlist this year. In 2019, \"Banana\" got me into the group, my MC got me further. This year, I took a turn of going through their whole discography again and appreciating it to no end. CREAM has four songs and all four are in my top 10 on Apple Music Replay for most played. On top of that, I've listened to CREAM the most this year. Not only has CREAM released several new digital singles this year that are on many of my playlists but their older songs such as \"Change\", \"Wonderland\", \"Playboy\", \"Girl LIke Me\", \"Banana\", and \"#nofilter\" have been the most played for me. 2021 has consisted of CREAM and Yayoi Daimon, however, CREAM has reigned supreme.\n\nGray’s Top Song and Artists of 2021\n\nSong of the Year: “Ame ga Hajimari no Aizu” by 7ORDER\n\nI love this song and while I've technically listened to \"Seiyaku No Toushi\" more, \"Ame Ga Hajimari No Aizu\" has my heart. I just love the melody and song composition. Everything works so well together. The vocal work at play here is super good. Every member does a standout job and the harmonization in the chorus is just spectacular.\n\nNew Artist of the Year: White Jam\n\nI've been obsessed with White Jam since I covered them for MC and I know I talked about them all the time on the show. I love Shirose and Niki's vocals plus you have Gashima's rap which is always done super well. White Jam doesn't release too often, but when they do they really make it something. Can't wait to see what these guys do next.\n\nArtist of the Year: Da-ICE\n\nBecoming my consecutive artist of the year, Da-ICE started off the year really strong and stayed consistent throughout. Their latest release is their \"CaITRUS\" first take which is just phenomenal. Also I'm eagarly anticipating the release of their song \"Live Devil\" which is being used for the excellent Kamen Rider Revice. I know I haven't talking about them too much on the show but I'm still carrying the torch for these guys and I can't wait to see what they do next.\n\nKen’s Top Song and Artist of 2021\n\nSong of the Year: “Fushigi” by Gen Hoshino\n\nThis was one of the songs that upon first listen I knew that would be a part of my top songs of the year. However, to becoming number 1 is something of a surprise due to the fact that i didn’t know how much I would absolutely love it. While Hoshino might not be an artist that I’m a total fan of, I do respect the range of styles this man does. As the release before this “Create” was to my dismay, a track that did capture me like the mass have, but “Fushigi” more focus on Hoshino’s vocals with its slow to mid-tempo composition absolutely encompassed me like “Pop Virus” had years ago. While I might not like all of Hoshino’s releases, I cannot deny the influence “Fushigi” did to me throughout the year.\n\nNew Artist of the Year: Rung Hyang\n\nRung Hyang is the breakout star for me in 2021 as she brings a unique taste as a \"soul\" writer who continues to evolve with an \"omnivorous\" style. They incorporate various genres such as Jazz, Hip Hop, Soul, and folk, with realistic lyric styles that anyone can relate to. Hyang is sure to have a work that fans can always jam to throughout her amazing and varied discography. While her solo work is phenomenal, her collaboration work is some of the best work I heard of in the pandemic era.\n\nArtist of the Year: TENDRE\n\nWhat more can I say about TENDRE that I haven’t said before in my prior Music Corners. I shall reiterate that I was really afraid of his signing to EMI RECORDS of Universal Music Japan, his style, while not bad per say, is very difficult to garner an audience in which studio tampering could happen. So to my present surprise, TENDRE’s style is still there and doesn’t skip a beat. While this major label debut was the biggest thing this year for him, it was also what he did behind the scenes as a composer and produces that proved more then enough to become my artist of the year for 2021.\n\nMiliyah Kato Teams Up with the Yoshida Brother For Out of this World Collaboration!\n\nVocalist Miliyah Kato announced that she will be releasing brand new track, “この夢が醒めるまで” (“Kono Yume ga Sameru Made”) across all digital music streaming platforms. This will be the latest release done by the vocalist since “宿命” (“Shukumei”) back in March and will be her second release of 2021. Teaming up with the phenomenal Shamisen playing duo Yoshida Brothers, the track is set to be the ending theme song for the Shamisen anime Mashiro no Oto that began airing during the Spring 2021 season.\n\nWhile the strange mix of genre might be off setting to some, Kato’s rap vocals and the rhythmic Tsugaru shamisen are impressive and are bound to turn heads to anyone listening. A physical release of the track will also drop on June 16th and will have three tracks total. It will drop with a CD-only standard edition and will include the previously released song “Wing” and “Shukumei”.\n\nBe sure to check out “Kono Yume ga Sameru Made” on all digital streaming platforms here, along with the pre-order for the single below!\n\nStandard edition\n\nMiliyah Kato「Kono Yume ga Sameru Made feat.

Each track is available across all digital music streaming platforms, with Apple Music featured on this site.\n\n“OH\" by CRAZYBOY feat. Shota Shimizu & OZworld\n\nCRAZYBOY has filled my ears all month with many tracks, however, “OH” has been my most played of all of them. Ever since “OH” was released in late February, I was caught immediately by the beat of the track as it makes me want to get up, dance, and party. The collaboration between Shota Shimizu and OZworld fits CRAZYBOY’s style perfectly and that is the other reason I love this track: the composition and how all three come together and make a fun club song.\n\nCheck out “OH” here and the music video below!\n\n“Headlight” by Mime\n\nI am absolutely in love with Mime and it’s thanks to Ken at OTY for that. He sent me the music video for “Headlight” and from those first beats and Mime’s lovely vocals, I was pulled in and in love. I cannot pinpoint what it is about this track, but you get lost in its wonderful melody and Mime’s soft, sweet, and serene vocals. To me, “Headlight” has been a powerful track that has moved me on so many levels thanks to the composition and how Mime’s vocals flow throughout the song.\n\nCheck out “Headlight” here and the music video below!\n\n“Aru Hibi” by Hakubi\n\nAs I’ve spent most of this month revisiting past Music Corner’s, many artists and tracks caught my ear, but Hakubi’s “Aru Hibi” is one I have revisited throughout the month. It’s my second favorite track by Hakubi and catching up to my favorite, “22.” “Aru Hibi” starts off slow, composition wise, and picks right up from the chorus and stays that way throughout the song until nearing the end. I love the arrangement as I find it fits perfectly with Katagiri’s vocals.\n\nCheck out “Aru Hibi” here and the music video below!\n\n“Good-bye days” by YUI\n\nWith the release of YUI’s fifteenth anniversary self-cover album Natural, I went back and began revisiting YUI’s music. “Good-bye days” has always been a favorite track of mine and I love every versions of this track. I spent the month listening to all three versions. YUI’s vocals, the composition, and the lyrics make for a perfect track. YUI captures the emotions of this song perfectly and every time I hear it, I am moved to tears. “Good-bye days” is always a tune that I go back to and lose myself in it.\n\nCheck out “Good-bye days” here and the music video below!\n\n“WHY” by Miliyah Katou\n\nWith the release of Miliyah’s 15th Anniversary MILIYAH Budokan 2020 that released March 17, I began preparing by re-visiting her discography. “WHY” is one of the tracks that I kept listening to on repeat as it has so much power behind the words. Miliyah delivers this track so emotionally and it resonates with you on a level that sticks with you. I always go back to “WHY” for the lyrics but also because of the powerful vocal delivery and the composition. It is more of a mid-tempo pop-rock track, which is different than her usual genre as she usually sticks to an urban pop feel. “WHY” always stood out to me and I am looking forward to watching her perform this live!\n\nCheck out “WHY” here and the music video below!\n\nMiliyah Kato To Release 15th Anniversary Tour!\n\nR&B-pop singer-songwriter Miliyah Kato has announced her latest tour, 15th Anniversary Miliyah Budokan 2020, will be coming to Blu-ray and DVD on March 17!
