        "text": "Let me… is the first mini-album released by Sowelu. There were two versions released, each with a special song as track #4. The mini peaked at #37 on the charts and sold over 4,000 copies.\n\nReleased: August 24, 2011\n\n1. I want U to…\n\n2. Let ME Lead U\n\n3. WOMAN\n\n4. Diamond / One more kiss\n\n5. Endless Summer\n\n6. Kimi no Inai Sekai (君のいない世界; A World Without You)\n\nThe mini opens with I want U to…, which is a pop/EDM song that is pretty standard for this time. I can’t say it’s all that great as it sounds a bit outdated at this point and doesn’t really have any strikingly redeeming factors. It’s definitely a change up from Sowelu’s usual R&B sound and she has only done this style a few times in the past. I just wish it was more interesting as the best part of the song is the guest rapper. It’s just lackluster.\n\nI much prefer Let ME Lead U, which still retains a powering pop sound and sounds more like a Lady Gaga track. It’s stomping beat and sensual vocals sound more like an evolution of Sowelu’s music than the last track. With that said, the overall delivery is just subpar. Only the chorus has a strong opening melody line, while everything else that surrounds it is just treading water. A solid track, but nothing particularly noteworthy.\n\nThe first slow song comes in the form of WOMAN, but even then it takes a more mid-tempo, acoustic approach. I think it’s a nice change up and it’s a good song to really hear Sowelu’s voice. The verses are unfortunately quite dull, but the pre-chorus does help to bring a bit more life to things. The chorus isn’t bad, but it’s just odd. The English is an interesting choice, but the melody just doesn’t put hard enough.\n\nThe first of the special tracks is Diamond, which follows similarly in sound to “Let ME Lead U”. Unfortunately, this one is more drab. It has a commanding sound to it, but it just doesn’t hit it on the melody. Everything just comes off particularly flat and doesn’t feel that polished. Just another flat track for me.\n\nThe second of the special tracks is One more kiss, which is a light-hearted pop/R&B track. Up to this point, it’s the strongest of the tracks just because it has a more fleshed out arrangement and a decent melody. The verses a bit dull, but the song does flow quite nicely in the chorus. I do wish the melody didn’t have Sowelu singing in falsetto though as it sounds a bit off on the higher notes. Still, this is a solid track.\n\nEndless Summer is probably the first song I actually like. It has a summery pop sound, but still fits with the rest of the mini due to its usage of synths. The verses are cute, but the song definitely gets its energy in the chorus. The hook is quite catchy and it works with the flashy synths. I only wish the song took it a step up and really hit it harder here because it could really push that energy harder.\n\nEnding things off is Kimi no Inai Sekai, which is the only full-fledged ballad, albeit with some light R&B elements. Unfortunately, it just isn’t that interesting in general. The verses are boring, lacking any vitalization in its arrangement. The chorus also suffers from this as the melody relies on a weak beat and just droplets of synths. I’m sure this would have been better with a stronger accompaniment.\n\nOverall: This is a pretty weak release for me and her worse since her third album. I can say that part of it is the uptempo tracks just sound outdated, employing the late 00’s and early 10’s dance/pop elements, while the slower songs were boring. Maybe more R&B would’ve been better.\n\nC\n\nLove & I. ~Ren’ai Henreki~ (恋愛遍歴) is the fifth album released by Sowelu and her first under the rhythm zone label. The album is a collaboration album with other artists and had no previous singles. It also featured a more sexualized image compared to her releases with Sony Music Japan. The album peaked at #19 and sold 15,000 copies.\n\nReleased: December 1, 2010\n\n1. NEVER\n\n2. Koboresou na Kuchibiru (こぼれそうな唇; Scratched Lips)\n\n3. snow again\n\n4. Make It Last Forever\n\n5. Toshishita no Kimi ni (年下の君に ; To Your Younger Self)\n\n6. Very First Christmas\n\n7. Koko mo Soko mo… (ここもそこも… ; Here and There…)\n\n8. Mannerism (マンネリズム)\n\n9. Chikai no Kami (誓いの紙 ; Written Vow)\n\n10. My Love is\n\n11. The moment I saw you\n\n12. HOT BODY\n\n13. I am GHOST -Kodoku na Jinsei- (-孤独な人生- ; Lonely Life)\n\n14. Kimi wo Omou yo… (君を想うよ・・・; I Think About You..)\n\nThe first song is a collaboration with VERBAL from m-flo, NEVER. The song takes on a mix of R&B and electropop, which is a total change from the majority of the music that she released with Sony Music. The verses are more relaxed and cool. The cold quality of the song really comes out in the arrangement here. I want to like the chorus more, but it feels a bit messy. The music is interesting, but Sowelu’s voice is a little odd here and the song’s more dragged out melody just doesn’t quite work. It’s not bad, but too all over the place.\n\nKoboresou na Kuchibiru is a collaboration with Mummy-D. Unlike the last song, this one goes for a jazzier R&B style. Unfortunately, I just don’t like it all that much. It’s not terrible, but there isn’t anything about it that stands out. The chorus just sort of floats along and it gets a bit dull after a few listens. I actually find the rap to be the best part of the song because this part actually injects some energy into it.\n\nI like that snow again is a duet with Douchin Yoshikuni from CHEMISTRY as I really like the voices from that duo. As expected, it is a sparkly, wintery midtempo R&B tune. At this point, it’s the best of the first three songs. The arrangement is simplified and quite soft, but contains enough energy to keep things bouncing. Both singers sound great here and their voices blend in nicely with the catchy melody. It’s a pretty nice song, even if it is a bit generic for that time.\n\nI like that this album is going for a more R&B sound. Make It Last Forever brings an almost 90’s oldschool R&B edge and I love its sound. A duet with MIHIRO, both artists sound exceptional here. Their harmonies work well with the arrangement that brings some more traditional Japanese elements into the music. It’s soft, but much like the last song, still has enough power in the right spots to keep it interesting. Great.\n\nAnother interesting duet partner comes up next in Toshishita no Kimi ni. Here, we get Miura Daichi, who has one of my favourite male voices in J-Pop. This song retains some R&B elements, but also feels more pushed towards the pop zone with its brighter synths and dance-able beat. Unfortunately, despite the great collaboration partners, I find this song to just be middle of the road. It has some nice points, but it just feels like it’s missing the strong hooks.\n\nConsidering the time of the album’s release, I can understand why it has some more wintery tunes like Very First Christmas. Much like the other songs, it goes for the R&B sound, but this time at a mid-tempo pace with some acoustic accents. I do like that it still stands out a bit from the other songs due to its arrangement. I actually don’t like the raps here from SHUHEI because I find them a bit too aggressive when compared to the general vibe of the song. It’s a solid tune though.\n\nA duet with KG, Koko mo Soko mo… goes for a more relaxed R&B sound. It’s a bit too slow for my tastes, even though I really love slower R&B tunes. The melody just feels too dragged out and if things were actually sped up just a bit, I feel this would have been a good song. The drawn out delivery just makes the hooks lose any sort of impact they could have.\n\nMannerism has a bit more energy to it and brings a brighter pop edge. It’s not bad, but Sowelu’s had better high-energy pop songs. There are some fun moments here or there. I don’t really like the rapper though. There are some nice parts, but in the post-chorus section, the two just don’t match in intensity. His harder delivery doesn’t really fit the song.\n\nThe next song brings a breezy, light acoustic touch to the album. Chikai no Kami gives a bit more of an island vibe and feels like a nice duet between ISEKI and Sowelu. Unfortunately, the song just sort of drags on around the end, so it makes it a bit of a stretch to get through. It’s a cute song, but I feel like it could have a bit more energy to it.\n\nI would say My Love is is the first full-fledged ballad, but even it has an R&B that kicks in once the chorus opens up. I actually find this to be one of the better songs on the album. It has a more emotional touch to it that is not present in the other songs and Sowelu does a great job with her vocals. The beat also keeps things interesting and the hooks are pretty sweet. It’s also the only song without a feature.\n\nThe moment I saw you goes for a more old school, retro jazz vibe that combines a rap. It’s a cute song and I really like that it stands out on the album. It’s not the strongest song, but at least it has a bit of bounce to it. It’s not bad anyways.\n\nHOT BODY is probably my favourite song on the album. It’s one of the most aggressive pop/R&B tunes on the album and it is a lot of fun. The beat goes for a bit more of an electropop edge, but the melody is just super catchy. It’s a bit more on the generic side of things, but I feel like Sowelu really pulls of this kind of sound as well.\n\nI was not expecting to enjoy I am GHOST -Kodoku na Jinsei- that much, but it is a cool surprise. The song is still R&B, but goes at a midtempo pace and brings a smooth and slick vibe. The use of the background vocals really makes it stand out. The song is actually the rapper’s song, so he takes the prominence here, however his tone really works nicely in the song while Sowelu’s parts stand out due to her stellar vocal performance.\n\nFinishing things off is Kimi wo Omou yo…, a duet with Quadrophonic. It goes for a slower pop/R&B sound too and reminds me a bit of Koda Kumi’s “you” and “hands”. I quite like it, although I don’t quite find the hooks to be as strong. Still, it’s a pretty solid ballad and I think it fits Sowelu’s vocals really nicely. The male vocalist also does a good job and they blend together well.\n\nOverall: This album is sort of all over the place. I do like it that Sowelu has gone back to a stronger R&B influence in her sound and throughout there are some really solid pop/R&B songs. Unfortunately, there are also some boring or lackluster songs on here as well. Some of them just drag on or don’t have strong enough melodies. I also felt some of the collaborations didn’t quite mesh as well together as I would have hoped.\n\nB-\n\nNaked is the fourth album released by Sowelu. The album proved to be her least popular at the time. It peaked at #11, her first outside of the top ten and it ended up selling only a fraction of her last album’s sales with 27,000 copies sold. Five singles were used to promote the album, but all except the special collaboration one failed to make much of a dent.\n\nReleased: April 9, 2008\n\n1. Hikari (光; Light)\n\n2. Wish\n\n3. I’ll be with you\n\n4. SEPTEMBER\n\n5. Shiawase no Chikara (幸せのちから; The Strength of Happiness)\n\n6. Dare Yori Suki na no ni (誰より好きなのに; And Yet I Like You More Than Anyone)\n\n7. All My Life\n\n8. Lie\n\n9. Hatsuyuki (初雪; First Snow)\n\n10. Still lovin’ you\n\n11. I Wonder\n\n12. Sayonara (サヨナラ; Farewell)\n\n13. Taisetsu na Hito (大切な人; Important Person)\n\n14. 24karats -type S-\n\nThe album opens with the third solo single, Hikari (#28 / 6,900). I didn’t care for this song much before because it sounds a bit cheesy and generic at times, but it is quite catchy and has grown on me. What I’m thankful for is that Sowelu ditched the acoustic pop sound of her last album and brought back some solid pop. The song does have some rock influences in the music, but it only amplifies the intensity of the music, especially tied with the synths. It’s a pretty starter.\n\nThe album’s final single comes in the form of a light R&B tune. Wish (#36 / 5400) is a cuter song, but it’s completely forgettable. It’s pretty generic with its cute beat and pop/R&B melody. I just wish there was more to it. It feels more like a Christmas song and it there are some cheesy parts to it. It’s not terrible and I’ve heard worse, but this shouldn’t have been a single.\n\nI’ve got to say that I like I’ll be with you. It’s more on the generic side of things, but it reminds me of “Let’s go faraway” from her last album, which is one of her best songs. It has a bright summery vibe to it. The music is great with its light funk elements and brass-like punch. It’s not the strongest song, but it is cute and one of her better album tracks.\n\nSEPTEMBER is something I wasn’t expecting. Here we go a heavier disco route and I love it. I wish the lyrics were smoothed out a bit more so it was catchier, but the song has some great hooks and I love the energy of the music. The arrangement ties some exciting synths with a wicked guitar and bassline. My only peeve would be that Sowelu’s vocals are distorted and it didn’t need to be, but it might’ve been this way to match with the A-side it was included with (the collab single). This is also a cover of a famous Earth, Wind & Fire song.\n\nThe album’s first single is a pretty straightforward piano ballad. Shiawase no Chikara (#20 / 9,700) starts off beautifully and Sowelu’s voice sounds especially gorgeous here. Her softer delivery helps to build the song up. The transition into the chorus is a bit more jarring though. The opening line goes up for a weird pitch change, but it settles itself eventually. It’s a beautiful tune though and one of her stronger ballads. It reminds me of “to YOU”.\n\nWe get the next single and next ballad with Dare Yori Suki na no ni (#22 / 7,400). I’m a bit uncertain why they placed this one right after because it has almost the same vibe. It has a really grand arrangement, dare I say moreso. The orchestral vibe is really strong here. Still, it’s not bad and there are some points that stand out. It has a jazzier vibe in the chorus thanks to the inclusion of the brass elements. It’s a pretty song and is actually a cover of a Toko Furuuchi song.\n\nI can finally say there is a song that I love. All My Life is in English and it’s great. It continues the funk and disco influence of the other songs, but pushes things even farther. The chorus isn’t really catchy, but the overall mood of the song works beautiful with the wicked bassline and string-like synths. I feel like the lyrics could have been tweaked more, but this is what I am looking for.\n\nLie was originally released as a B-side on the album’s second single. It’s a more aggressive pop song and while it’s a decent offering, it is lacking in some areas. I think it is trying to hard to really bring the punch and while I like its more electronic sound, it doesn’t quite hit the spot in terms of arrangement. I feel like the production could be tweaked more so music helps to elevate the melody.\n\nReturning to the slower side of things, we get Hatsuyuki. This is a light midtempo R&B/pop tune with a more acoustic spin. It’s a sweet tune with a fresher sound to it, especially compared to the rest of the album that feels production heavy. It’s quite gentle and just flows along. However, Sowelu’s voice feels rather congested and the song itself just doesn’t quite excel in any area. It’s cute, but forgettable.\n\nAnother B-side pops up. Still lovin’ you doesn’t go the aggressive route, but the lighter pop route. It sort follows similarly to the last song, but ups the R&B elements. I’m thankful for this cause the beat is actually great and really drives the song. This is a solid pop tune anyways and I quite like the melody and it’s smoother delivery.\n\nThe third B-side is right after. I Wonder goes the cuter pop route and has some electronic elements in the music. Unfortunately, this song is completely forgettable and probably my least favourite on the album. It isn’t a terrible song and the verses are actually quite enjoyable, but I don’t remember anything from the chorus. It just floats by.\n\nSayonara is a bit of change because we get som gospel background vocals. The song itself starts off pretty generically and gives off the same feelings as the last song. The verses aren’t that interesting. The chorus is a little better and I like its more emotional take. I’m just not accustomed to Sowelu trying to singing with a darker and more congested tone and it sort of takes away from the emotion.\n\nFinally bringing us back to the ballad side, Taisetsu na Hito comes gently rolling in. It’s quite short, clocking in at just under 2:30 minutes. The whole song just relies on the keyboard and Sowelu’s voice and while it has a touching and sweet quality to it, it just isn’t that memorable either.\n\nIt’s weird to think we end things off with the collaboration between Sowelu, EXILE and DOBERMAN INC. 24karats -type S- (#12 / 20,000) is a total hip-hop and R&B inspired tune. I love the energy that it gives, but it is lacking in some areas. The chorus is fun and I think there are some really catchy points. I also love how their voices blend together nicely. However, the verses sound rather bare and I wish there was a bit more. It’s a cool collaboration though.\n\nOverall: This album was a bit of an oddball for me. While I wasn’t sure what I was going into considering the mixed reactions of her previous three albums and the change up in sound, I can’t say I’m that disappointed. Actually, at this point, it would rank as her second best for me. I enjoy the departure of the acoustic pop/rock sound and the return of something more pop. The album isn’t totally R&B, but it is still found in some areas and I like the experimentation of disco and funk in other tunes. Even the ballads were bad. However, it falters in the second half and I feel this album should have been cut by a good 4 songs.\n\nB-\n\n24 -twenty four- is the third album released by Sowelu. The album became her highest charting, peaking at #3, however, it also saw lower sales than her past two albums as it only sold 84,000 copies. The singles were more successful as a whole as three of the four were top 20 hits. Surprisingly, one of the singles was not featured on the here.\n\nReleased: July 12, 2006\n\n1. Dear friend\n\n2. Crazy for you\n\n3. Mamoru Beki Mono (守るべきもの; Shall Be Protected)\n\n4. tomorrow\n\n5. smile again\n\n6. DANCE\n\n7. Flyer\n\n8. cry\n\n9. Let’s go faraway\n\n10. Kimi no Kehai (君の気配; Your Sign)\n\n11. without you\n\n12. Pride\n\n13. to YOU\n\nThe album opens with its last and most popular single, Dear friend (#19 / 23,000). This is a bit different from her other A-sides as it doesn’t have any R&B influences and is an upbeat pop song with rock elements. To me, it’s not my cup of tea. I do like the energy that it gives, but the fact that Sowelu has done some stronger pop tunes that were much catchier, this just comes off a bit lackluster. It doesn’t really take me into the album like her ‘Do You Remember That?’ did.\n\nCrazy for you is definitely cooler as it has a really funky guitar going on. The pop/rock sound is still present here, which I’m not too happy about as I think Sowelu works best with R&B. The verses are decent, but nothing particularly interesting, while the chorus isn’t much better. It’s just a lackluster pop/rock tune that comes off really generic but average.\n\nMamoru Beki Mono was used as a theme to a Pokemon movie and it is the album’s first ballad. It’s a full-fledged piano ballad and I really like how it starts off. It has a really sentimental feel to it. The chorus isn’t as strong as I feel like the English parts sort of ruin things a bit. It is better than the other two songs, but it does drag on a bit by the end.\n\ntomorrow brings things back to the pop/rock sound but this one comes off like an album filler from Avril Lavigne’s first album. I do like qualities of it, but it just lacks a punch. The songs keeps a consistent feeling throughout and I feel like it really needs something to elevate it. Sowelu does sound nice here though and it is one of the stronger pop/rock songs.\n\nsmile again has some folk qualities to it and I do like that it stands out. The pop/rock influences are there, but it isn’t as strong as there is a nice violin to help offset the guitars. I feel like this song wouldn’t be bad for someone like YUI, but it needs to elevated. The chorus just doesn’t push things hard enough and plays too much on soft and sweet.\n\nWhen I saw the title for DANCE, I was expecting something more…well…dance. Unfortunately, this is yet another lackluster pop/rock song. I think Sowelu’s vocals can actually fit this style really well and the melodies are decent, but the songs just don’t push it far enough. The music doesn’t have any impact and this song just comes off as forgettable.\n\nFlyer is more relaxed and focuses on the acoustic guitar. It’s more on the midtempo side, which is a nice change, but it is another tune that doesn’t particularly impress me. The music doesn’t really go anywhere and Sowelu’s vocals don’t give me any kind of emotion.\n\ncry is another acoustically focused track, but this one actually has something going for it with its gentle vibe and R&B beat. It might not be the best song, but at least it brings something different. Sowelu’s sweet vocals really work nicely here.\n\nFinally, we come to Let’s go faraway(#64 / 9,400), the album’s first single. This is literally the album’s saving grace because we get a sparkling summer pop tune that is insanely catchy and has a lot of fun energy to it. It’s one of my favourite Sowelu songs and it is easy to get sucked into it. It has such a positive feel to it that the hooks really work wonderfully here. The music is bright and explosive and help to push this feeling.\n\nKimi no Kehai is a pop ballad that finally brings something different as well. The verses aren’t bad as they featured a variety of instruments that come flying in. The chorus is a bit generic and doesn’t quite hit the spot. I really wish the music had some punch to it as the music stays so quiet that I wonder what its doing. Not her strongest ballad.\n\nwithout you is another slow song, but this time we have a nice return of R&B Sowelu. This song sounds like something that would have been featured on her last album and I’m quite happy because it is a decent song. I just wish the chorus had a stronger hook as I don’t think I’ll come back to this song that much, but it is nice to hear something that has a bit of punch in its music.\n\nNot quite sure what to think of Pride. It definitely has that pop/rock sound, but it has a more aggressive side to it that isn’t present in the other pop/rock songs on this album. It definitely reminds me of something from Avril Lavigne, which I’m happy about. That is, until the chorus hits, where things turn a bit more pop. I wish it kept being aggressive and darker because it helped it stand out. It’s not bad though.\n\nto YOU (#20 / 13,000) was the album’s second single (as Get Over was not included) and is a full-fledged pop ballad. I didn’t like this song that much at first because I thought it was boring, but it has grown on me a lot. The melody is something that would have been heard on her second album and the hooks are much stronger here than on any other ballad on this album. The chorus also has a lot of punch thanks to the music, which is what I was looking for.\n\nOverall: This is so weird because I do not know what happened. Sowelu’s last album was very strong and had some amazing tracks. This has maybe two. Instead of going her usual pop/R&B route, she switched to pop/rock, which was an odd change. I think it is great when a singer experiments with their sound, but this just didn’t sound like a Sowelu album and the songs were just much weaker. They weren’t terrible, just average and didn’t have anything particular interesting about them. I can’t remember what most of the songs sounded like.\n\nC+\n\nSWEET BRIDGE is Sowelu’s second album and is her second best selling album to date with over 130,000 copies sold. It features five singles (one was a re-cut) and includes her biggest hit, “I Will”.\n\nReleased: January 7, 2005\n\n1. Do You Remember That?\n\n2. I Will\n\n3. No Limit\n\n4. Last Forever\n\n5. He is not for me\n\n6. Shower\n\n7. Glisten\n\n8. cloudy\n\n9. Joy\n\n10. secret candle light\n\n11. The Rose\n\n12. Akatsuki ni Omou (暁ニ想フ)\n\n13. You are my everything\n\nDo You Remember That? (#116 / 1,100) is such a great starter. It has that R&B flavour that was found on her first album, but elevates it with its heavy beats and sensual vibe. The song is really catchy, especially the chorus where the background vocals help to give an airy feel while Sowelu does some runs over it. Her voice sounds much better and she sounds much fuller compared to her first album. It is no surprise that it was eventually released as a single.\n\nI Will (#12 / 32,000) was released as the third single and is the album’s biggest hit. It has the R&B elements like the last song, but definitely has a stronger pop sound. The chorus is especially evident of this with its poppier melody over a thumping R&B beat. The song is catchy, but I don’t think the chorus is as hard hitting as I want it to be. It’s still a solid tune and has a really bright feel to it.\n\nThe second single, No Limit (#44 / 8,400), continues that pop/R&B fusion and is definitely another stand out track. I think it reminds me of material from her first album, but the melodies are just much stronger and the song is more memorable. The chorus is especially great as the hooks are subtle, but effective. I actually find it stronger than I Will because the bright quality of the song just doesn’t seem as overbearing at times. Sowelu sounds great here as well.\n\nLast Forever (#34 / 9,400) is the first ballad and was released as the fourth single. It was the first song I heard from Sowelu and it still remains my favourite of hers. It’s a bit generic in the sense that these kind of R&B-inspired pop ballads are pretty evident throughout J-Pop. However, I really love the feeling of the song. The harmonies in the chorus are really nicely done and help to give the chorus a bit more punch. The music isn’t the most exciting, but it does work well with the charming melody.\n\nHe is not for me is the first album track and brings up to a fun hip-hop/R&B tune. I was a bit worried when I first heard this song, but it has a great 90’s vibe to it. The chorus is especially evident of this with its cool harmonies and smooth melody lines. It’s a strong tune and keeps up the quality.\n\nShower is an interesting change, but also has that R&B flair to it. I quite like it being it slows things down and brings a nice midtempo tune. The beat is especially nice and I love how it works with Sowelu’s voice. It sounds really good in the chorus when a few more synths are brought in as well. I do feel like the melody does get a bit overpowered by the music at times, but it has its charmpoints.\n\nGlisten (#15 / 19,000) was released as the first single from the album is definitely the most “pop” song at this point. I do find that it doesn’t stick out too much compared to the rest of the album, which is a nice thing. With that said, it’s an excellent tune. The song has a pulsating dance beat that really drives it forward and it works really well in the chorus where the hooks and synths fit well with its energy. It’s just a fun tune.\n\ncloudy brings the tempo down and it’s a nice relaxing midtempo R&B/pop tune. Unfortunately, I think this is the weakest song up to this point. I do like the pop elements in the chorus with the melody, but the music is rather weak and a large part of the song just remains rather forgettable. It’s not a bad song, just very average compared to the other songs prior to this.\n\nJoy changes things up by bringing something acoustic and gentle. It’s a sweet tune, but it just has very little impact. The “joy” hook in the chorus is a bit weak and doesn’t really have much impact, while I’m on the fence with the verses. I like the guitar, but I think the melody is not memorable. It’s a bit boring.\n\nReturning to the R&B sound, secret candle light is a darker midtempo ballad. I absolutely love the music for it as it has a slight Latin element to it that really gives it a lot of character. My main issue with the song is the verse is a bit messy and the transition into the chorus is a bit abrupt and awkward. With that said, I love the melody in the chorus and the hook, “Rain after sunshine in my heart”, is actually really clever and catchy. I wish there were more harmonies to level the song out a bit though.\n\nThe Rose is the only B-side included on the album and is a cover of the Bette Midler song of the same name. I don’t know what makes this song so popular to cover in Asia, but they really love this piano ballad. Sowelu has great pronunciation in English, so she sounds quite good in the song. Her sweet voice actually works nicely with this type of song, although I do wish it had a bit more energy around the end. The song stays pretty consistent throughout and doesn’t really have a climax despite feeling like it builds to something.\n\nAkatsuki ni Omou is actually a Miss Monday song that features Sowelu. It’s a grooving R&B tune and it’s actually really smooth sounding. I think Miss Monday is a decent rapper and she works great in this song. Sowelu really only does the choruses, which is really catchy. I think her timbre really fits this song and she does an excellent job on her part. I do wish the song did push it a little more in the end, but I do love the overall arrangement. The bridge is a highlight as well.\n\nYou are my everything ends things on a slower note. It’s the first full-fledged ballad since Last Forever. I don’t quite think it’s as interesting as that song though. The beat is nice, but the chorus is just really gentle and a bit boring. It’s sweet and fits as an “ending”, but I just wish it wasn’t so lackluster. Sowelu also holds things in so the song doesn’t really bring much energy.\n\nOverall: This album was infinitely better than her first album. It continued that R&B/pop fusion, but the arrangements and the melodies were just so much stronger here. Even the vocals were much stronger and Sowelu sounded much more confident in herself. I do think the first half of the album is much stronger than the second half, so it’s a bit disappointing that everything fell off once Glisten ended. I think it could have be arranged in a better way.\n\nB+\n\nSowelu debuted in 2002 and scored a few a few moderate hits before releasing her top 5 album first album in 2003. The album proved to be a success and moved over 200,000 copies. Unfortunately, this album also turned out to be her best selling. Four singles were released prior to Geofu.\n\nReleased: June 25, 2003\n\n1. shine\n\n2. Fortune [MV]\n\n3. Rainbow (original mix) [MV]\n\n4. across my heart [MV]\n\n5. I Wanna Know\n\n6. beautiful dreamer (album version) [MV]\n\n7. Part of me [MV]\n\n8. CC\n\n9. Can’t take my eyes off of you\n\n10. call my name\n\n11. my dear\n\n12. breath ~Omoi no Youryou~ (想いの容量; The Capacity of Thoughts) [MV]\n\nGeofu opens with shine, a pretty laidback midtempo R&B tune. The one thing I really liked about Sowelu was the fact she always released a few R&B tunes. Unfortunately, shine is pretty cheesy sounding. There are some nice aspects about it such as the twinkling in the background and the pretty chill beat. However, the melody is quite boring and I got pretty bored of this soon as it is rather generic. I do like how the verses open with “Hello good day”, but the majority of the English sounds rather cheesy. It’s not a bad song, but highly forgettable.\n\nFortune (#40 / 9,400) was released as the fourth single and is easily my favourite song off the album. Like the last song, this one has a chill R&B sound to it, but the delivery is much better. The melody is much catchier and I really like the use of the background vocals in the chorus, which helps the song as Sowelu is able to add a few adlibs every once in a while to keep it from getting too monotone. I actually really enjoy how full the musical arrangement is and the acoustic guitar really gives the song a bit of edge considering the majority of it sounds especially programmed. But the melody really makes this song. It’s so catchy.\n\nRainbow (#28 / 31,000) is a nice change. Released as the one part of her third single, it is a more upbeat change. It’s definitely more straightforward pop than the last two songs, although there are still some little R&B elements in the verses. It’s not a bad song in general, but it is a little odd. There is a strange transition from the verses to the chorus as it goes from something a little more midtempo to something very bright and upbeat. At times, the transition is quite jarring. I like both parts of the song (although the chorus is incredibly cheesy), but it doesn’t fit well together as one part sounds more contemporary and the other is more 90s J-Pop with its awkward background vocals.\n\nThe first ballad on the album, across my heart is a nice R&B jam and was actually Sowelu’s first released song. It definitely gives me some nice 90s R&B feelings. I love how it is so slow and one of those “rainy day” kind of songs. The musical arrangement and melody is somewhat sad sounding, but the lyrics are really nice and seem to have a slightly more hopeful feel to them. What is really nice though is that it is the first song where I really get to hear Sowelu’s vocal ability. She hits some nice notes and while she isn’t the strongest vocalist, she does do a decent job of working with this kind of song. A nice surprise.\n\nI Wanna Know brings us back to the more midtempo feel. I really like this one cause it’s catchier than some of the other songs on here. I think it has a slightly sexier feel to it as well, which is a nice change to the cheerful feel of the rest of the album (although this one is still quite cheerful). I love the funky beat with the simplicity of the synths and rest of the music. It isn’t overpowering, but is a just sweet. It’s a nice song.\n\nbeautiful dreamer (#20 / 15,000) was Sowelu’s debut single. I’m not entirely sure what the difference between the album and single version are, but it’s a pretty twinkly sounding pop tune with strong R&B inspiration. I really love the verses. We hear a nice taste of Sowelu’s lower register and the melody is quite charming. At first, I thought this song was a bit boring and odd, but I’ve grown to like it. The chorus isn’t anything that stands out that much, but it is quite cute. It’s quite poppish and I really love the beat of the song, with the slight R&B influence heard in the vocal arrangement. It’s a good song to hear Sowelu’s vocals as well.\n\nPart of me (#97 / 1,900) was released as Sowelu’s second single. It’s probably the most straightforward pop ballad on the album. I like the music because it has an eerie mystical feel to it. With that said, that’s all the song has going for it. The vocal arrangement is rather dull and just doesn’t go very far. It would’ve been nice if there was a little more contrast in the song since it just stays pretty flat throughout. It’s nice, but dull.\n\nCC is an interesting change. Here we have a funky disco inspired dance tune. I like the change, but there’s something about this song that just doesn’t really hit the right chords. I love the beat and the music, but it doesn’t work well with Sowelu’s vocals. Also, there is an odd transition from the verses to the chorus. The choruses are much better than the verses though. I just wish there was a little something more.\n\nCan’t take my eyes off of you is a cover of a Frankie Valli song. They pretty much remodeled the song into a midtempo pop song with some dance elements in the music. It’s a nice listen and I do like that they updated it a bit. However, I do find Sowelu’s vocals to be a bit awkward during the verses since her voice just stands out so much above the simple beat. The chorus is a nice switch though and it’s a welcome surprise. The overall song is quite decent, but it’s a bit forgettable.\n\ncall my name switches us back to the R&B sound. This one is a bit more bossa nova inspired, which is a good switch and brings us a slightly different sound. I actually like this one because the background vocals are a nice touch during the choruses and it works well with the relaxed but groovy beat. Sowelu also sounds really nice here and her vocals match this style well since she has a sweeter tone to her voice.\n\nmy dear reminds me of an 80s soul song, but without the power vocals. I do like Sowelu’s voice, but she can’t pull a song of this magnitude off as cleanly as it should be done. Especially by the end, she gets a bit lost in the music. It’s a nice song because the lyrics are quite sweet, but it would’ve been nice if the music was changed a bit to suit her vocals more.\n\nbreath ~Omoi no Youryou~ ends the album on an midtempo R&B ballad. I don’t think the overall song is particularly stellar, but I do like some small surprises about it. Like the little talking parts in the background and the nice use of background vocals on top of the nice beat. The vocal arrangement is quite nice though and I do like the charming feel of it. It’s really sweet and this is especially heard in the slight nip of a note it gives. A nice ending.\n\nOverall: Geofu had some nice things going for it. I love R&B and it was nice to hear a lot of R&B influences in this album. Also, Sowelu does have a nice voice that lends itself well to sweeter songs. Unfortunately, the majority of the material was lackluster and just blends into each other. I think the album would’ve been better if most of the songs had stronger melodies. The majority are nice and quite relaxing and calm, but they aren’t particularly catchy or memorable.\n\nC"
