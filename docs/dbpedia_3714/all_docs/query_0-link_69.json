        "text": "L’Arc-en-Ciel (“The Rainbow” in French, stylized as L’Arc~en~Ciel) is a Japanese rock band formed in 1991 in Osaka. The group has sold over 13 million albums, 16 million singles, and millions of other units, including videos. They were ranked at number 58 on a list of the top 100 Japanese pop musicians by HMV Japan in 2003.\n\nHistory\n\n1991–1996: Early career\n\nIn February 1991, bassist tetsuya (then known as TETSU), later bandleader, recruited vocalist hyde (then known as HIDE), guitarist HIRO and drummer PERO, and formed a band under the name of L’Arc-en-Ciel. After a year of gaining notoriety in their hometown of Osaka, HIRO left the band on June 12, 1992. tetsuya convinced his friend ken to quit his university studies (he was an architecture major at The Nagoya Institute of Technology) and join them as guitarist, but on December 30, 1992 PERO left the group. In 1993, new drummer sakura joined L’Arc-en-Ciel.[2]\n\nOn April 1, 1993, the band released their debut album Dune under the indie label Danger Crue. The album was a success and rose to number one on the Oricon indies charts, catching the attention of some major labels. In 1994, L’Arc-en-Ciel signed on with Sony‘s Ki/oon division, releasing their second album, Tierra that same year. Heavenly followed in 1995. True, released in 1996, became their first number one, million selling album.[3]\n\n1997: sakura’s departure\n\nIn February 1997, drummer sakura was arrested for heroin possession.[4] He officially quit the band on October 4, 1997. This proved to be the lowest point in the band’s history. When news of sakura’s arrest became public, there was an immediate official response and CDs were removed from the shelves.[5] “The Fourth Avenue Cafe“, the fourth ending theme for the Rurouni Kenshin anime, was immediately replaced with its former theme “Heart of Sword” after only six episodes. In addition, the release of the “The Fourth Avenue Cafe” single was postponed.[6] It was eventually released in 2006. Advert for their self-copy band The Zombies.\n\nOver the next few months the group continued to be featured in magazines, but only as a trio. The members formed “The Zombies”, which was advertised as a “copy band”, and sang their songs.[7] They also covered Marilyn Manson‘s “Irresponsible Hate Anthem”.[7] The return from the break was marked by the appropriately named “Reincarnation 97 Live in Tokyo Dome”, with their new drummer yukihiro (former drummer of Zi:Kill and Die in Cries). Their first concert at the Tokyo Dome had an attendance of 56,000, which sold out in four minutes, a record at that time.[8]\n\nIn 1997, “Niji“, the first single after sakura’s departure, was released with yukihiro listed as a supporting member. Not long after the release of the single, yukihiro was signed on as the official drummer for L’Arc-en-Ciel.\n\n1998–2000: Blockbuster success\n\nTheir 1998 single “Winter Fall“, became their first number one single on the Oricon charts.[9][10] They released the album Heart on February 25, 1998. Ark and Ray were released simultaneously on July 1, 1999, and became the first Japanese albums to be released simultaneously in many other Asian countries. Both topped the Oricon music charts, with Ark occupying number one and Ray at number two. Their release marked the commercial high point of the band’s career, with each selling over two million copies.[11]\n\nTheir next album Real was released on August 30, 2000. However, it was their last studio album for some time. “Stay Away” from the album was featured in DrumMania 4th Mix, making the song playable on the machine.\n\n2001–2003: Hiatus and solo projects\n\nThe compilation Clicked Singles Best 13 was released on March 14, 2001, and includes twelve songs chosen by fans online in Asia[12] and an additional thirteenth song, “Anemone”.[13] Their album Real was re-released as a Super Audio CD on July 4, 2001. L’Arc-en-Ciel’s last new single before their hiatus, “Spirit Dreams Inside (Another Dream)“, was released on September 5, 2001. Their English language version of the song, “Spirit Dreams Inside”, was adopted for the closing theme song to the movie Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.\n\nAfter “Spirit Dreams Inside (Another Dream)” was released, the band went on a hiatus. During this time, the members began working on solo projects. hyde released two solo albums (Roentgen and 666) and co-starred in the movie Moon Child with popular singer Gackt. hyde also played the part of Adam in the movie Kagen no Tsuki (Last Quarter of the Moon), based on the manga of the same title. ken founded Sons of All Pussys with L’Arc-en-Ciel’s former drummer, sakura. tetsuya started Tetsu69 and yukihiro formed Acid Android.\n\nThree compilation albums The Best of L’Arc-en-Ciel 1994–1998, The Best of L’Arc-en-Ciel 1998–2000 and The Best of L’Arc-en-Ciel C/W were released on March 19, 2003. The album series included almost all their singles at that time except “Spirit Dreams Inside (Another Dream)”.\n\n2004: Comeback and U.S. concert debut\n\nIn June 2003, L’Arc-en-Ciel performed a series of seven concerts in Tokyo called “Shibuya Seven Days”, during which they announced a new album for release the following year. The band released “Ready Steady Go” in February 2004, their first single in more than three years. The song was used as an opening for the popular anime adaption of Fullmetal Alchemist.[14] It topped the Oricon weekly singles charts.[15] A cover of the song is used in a video game for the Nintendo DS called Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan. The single was followed by “Hitomi no Juunin“, in early March. The album Smile, was released on March 31. Shortly after, on June 2, 2004, the single “Jiyuu e no Shoutai” introduced P’unk-en-Ciel for the first time on CD with “Milky Way”.\n\nOn July 31, 2004, L’Arc-en-Ciel made their North American debut at the anime convention Otakon, held annually in Baltimore, Maryland.

The tour featured displays of anti-war sentiment, reflecting similar lyrics of the songs on the album. It was followed by the “Asia Live 2005” tour, with performances in Seoul and Shanghai, closing with concerts st Japan’s Tokyo Dome.\n\nFollowing the two tours, L’Arc-en-Ciel’s members turned their attention back to their solo projects. tetsuya began recording with, veteran metal vocalist of Dead End, Morrie’s solo project Creature Creature. yukihiro regrouped Acid Android and released the single “Let’s Dance” on April 5, 2006. Acid Android joined Mucc to perform two concerts in Shanghai, China in April 2006.[17]\n\nhyde composed “Glamorous Sky“, the theme song to the film adaption of the manga Nana starring pop singer Mika Nakashima.

The concert was later shown on the WOWOW channel on December 23, 2006. It was also broadcast on February 8, 2007 on Korea MTV.\n\nL’Arc-en-Ciel later recorded the song “Shine” to be used as the opening song for the NHK anime Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit.
