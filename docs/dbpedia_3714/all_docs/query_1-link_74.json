        "text": "Re: The ULTIMATE J-Pop Queens Singles Rate, Part II: Ayumi Hamasaki (21 / 20)\n\n20. is this LOVE?\n\nHighest score - 10 (x2) / Lowest score - 6 (x1)\n\n\"is this LOVE?\" is the 35th single by Ayumi Hamasaki, released on April 20, 2005 as part of the double A-side \"STEP you / is this LOVE?\". It was the first single in advance of Hamasaki's 7th studio album (miss)understood (2006). \"is this LOVE?\" is a powerful pop-rock ballad, with a darker feel compared to its sister A-side \"STEP you\".\n\nThe PV for \"is this LOVE?\" features Ayumi singing emotionally in a hotel suite. As she passes by, objects begin to explode (i.e. a bowl of fruit, a fish tank, walls, etc.). The video ends as Ayumi looks at the hotel, in one piece, with none of the chaos that happened earlier.\n\n\"STEP you / is this LOVE?\" reached #1 on the Oricon and charted for 19 weeks. It sold 345,340 copies, becoming the #19 single of 2005. It was also the best-selling solo single of 2005 by a female artist until September of that year, when Mika Nakashima's \"Glamorous Sky\" outsold it.\n\nRe: The ULTIMATE J-Pop Queens Singles Rate, Part II: Ayumi Hamasaki (19 / 18)\n\nAlright, let's dig into this top 20... bringin on the heartbreak with the next two...\n\n19. Daybreak\n\nHighest score - 10 (x3) / Lowest score - 5 (x1)\n\n\"Daybreak\" is the 25th single by Ayumi Hamasaki, released as a recut on March 6, 2002. Not counting the Europe-only release of \"Connected\" in 2003, it was the 8th and final single from Hamasaki's 4th studio album I am... (2002). \"Daybreak\" is a euphoric pop-rock ballad, with electronic flourishes in the production which give it a unique feel from Hamasaki's other rock ballads. The lyrics deal with themes of hope and love against all odds, something which Hamasaki felt was important to include on her I am... album following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (\"No matter how far apart we are, we're still under the same sky / Don't forget that we're both travelling to the place we once dreamed of\").\n\nThe PV for \"Daybreak\" premiered on February 6, 2002. It features Ayumi on unknown and dusty roadway, where no cars go. A simple affair, she is shown looking at the camera singing throughout the entire PV, before walking away at the end of the video. The video uses a different mix of the song than the one that originally appeared on the album, \"HΛL's Mix 2002\", which would later be included on the single (and is exclusive to the single, having never been released later on an album). This mix was also used in TV adverts for Panasonic Digital Cameras.\n\nLike many of Hamasaki's recut singles, \"Daybreak\" was limited to just 300,000 copies. Peaking at #2 on the Oricon and charting for 9 weeks, it sold 197,140 copies total to become the #57 single of 2002 in Japan. It was her last single not to peak at #1 before her next single \"Free & Easy\" started a chain of 25 consecutive #1's. This is also her last single to feature multiple remixes, and starting from her next single there were only 4 - 6 tracks per single instead of the usual 10 or more (with the exception of No Way to Say which had 7 total tracks and Rule / Sparkle which had 8 total tracks).\n\nRe: The ULTIMATE J-Pop Queens Singles Rate, Part II: Ayumi Hamasaki (19 / 18)\n\nSomeone hold me...\n\n18. poker face\n\nHighest score - 10 (x3) / Lowest score - 5 (x2)\n\n\"poker face\" is the debut single by Ayumi Hamasaki, released on April 8, 1998. It was Hamasaki's first single under Avex trax following the failure of her music career during her idol days with \"NOTHING FROM NOTHING\" (1995). It was the first single from her debut album A Song for ×× (1999).\n\nHaving been abandoned by her father as a young child, Hamasaki and her mother moved in with her grandmother. Hamasaki's mother worked most of the time, and thus the responsibility of caring of young Ayumi fell on the shoulders of her grandmother. Hamasaki would later say that her grandmother felt more like a mother to her than her \"Mommy\" did.\n\nDuring the early days of her career with Avex, Hamasaki was sent to New York City for vocal lessons by label boss Max Matsuura. However, she rarely attended, having always had a problem with authority. She never told Matsuura that she ditched lessons to go shopping in New York instead. While in the city, she exchanged letters with Matsuura, oddly displaying a remarkable talent for expressing her feelings.\n\nUpon her return to Japan, she was ready to record her first single, \"poker face\". Up until the day of recording, Hamasaki had been dissatisfied with the lyrics. Matsuura, remembering Hamasaki's letters, suggested she try writing new ones. Her lyrics were accepted, and ended up being used in the final recording of the song. However, the day before the recording session was to take place, Hamasaki's grandmother was sick in the hospital. Hamasaki visited her briefly, saying that she'd come back later, and that tomorrow she was recording her first single. The day of recording, Hamasaki received a fax saying that her grandmother had passed away.\n\n\"poker face\" is a melancholic pop song, built around a simple piano melody. Lyrically, the song deals with feelings of sadness and loneliness (\"It's so simple I could cry, but I want to smile / If I become stronger I'll forget even your kindness, so I want to stay weak\"), and the yearning for deeper human connection (\"People are always solitary beings / So I need someone / I want to be supported and I want to be supporting\"), as well as exploring the darker side of emotion (\"The better I become at telling lies and excuses, the more I feel afraid in the emptiness\").\n\nThe music video for \"poker face\" was directed by Takeishi Wataru. The video focuses around Hamasaki standing in front for a large tree filled with television monitors that show her in various locations. She's also seen playing with animals.\n\nLike most of her early singles (pre A Song for ××), \"poker face\" was not a hit on the charts at the time, peaking at #20 on the Oricon in its debut week with sales of 11,520. The single charted for 6 weeks and sold a total of 43,140 copies. The single is currently certified Gold by the RIAJ, denoting shipments of over 100,000."
