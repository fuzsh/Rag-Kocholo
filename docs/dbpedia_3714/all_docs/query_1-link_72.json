        "text": "On June 24, 2009, the infamous Kago Ai released her first solo single after the big scandals. (For those that don't know, she was caught smoking in 2006, when she was only 18. Then she was caught dating an older man AND smoking, which prompted her release from Hello!Project.) The title track, \"no hesitAtIon,\" is a cute little ditty with lyrics that were written by Aibon herself. At first listen, the song seems like a fairly typical pop tune. However, after a few rotations, you can hear the \"Kago-ness\" come out. Lately, Aibon has kind of dubbed herself a spokesperson for teaching young people how to behave properly. (Meaning not smoking or having risky sex...things like that.) As such, this song has an uplifting message about starting over and being yourself. Granted, it's not quite as good as the B-side, \"Children of the Night,\" but it is still a really great song. I hope she keeps going long enough to release a full album on her own.\n\nI have been lacking in the music department lately. I apologize. Hopefully, a little boy band music will make you feel better.\n\nWish is popularly known as the theme song for the first season of the Hana Yori Dango jdorama. Of course, both Arashi and HYD feature Matsumoto Jun. Not only is the song cute on its own but the video for it is also adorable. It features a little puppet man trying to win the heart of a little puppet girl. I think, thanks to the HYD connection, that this was my first introduction into the world of Arashi. Let the cuteness wash over you!\n\nArtist: W Members: Kago Ai, Nozomi Tsuji Album: 2nd W Release date: 3/2/05\n\nEnglish translation: Don't hold me Don't hold me What kind of facial expression should I make?\n\nAfter we kiss After we kiss I can't look at your face 'Cause... I just can't look...\n\nWe were born far away from each other And then we met\n\nThere's a lot we don't know about each other, but We went shopping and got asked if we were siblings For some reason, I felt happy\n\nI won't show my tears I don't want to show them I don't want to tell you what kind of tears they are\n\nEverything, I mean everything! I like you This moment, just like this I want it to freeze\n\nThe environments we were born into Even our accents are different But still we met\n\nWe've still got a long fight with the unknown There's a lot of restaurants nearby, so let's go That station is famous for its ramen\n\nApril 9th, a clear Saturday. I wonder how many times we've gone on a date now. It was really fun. But really, I know what number date it is...\n\nI know what number date it is, but... But, I can't count 'em... the second kiss I like you. I like you I like you. I like you. Ahhhhhhh!!! I like you.\n\nThe environments we were born into Even our accents are different But still we met\n\nThere's a lot we don't know about each other, but We went shopping and got asked if we were siblings For some reason, I felt happy\n\nAbout the song: Another W song about liking a boy. Surprised? Like the rest of their songs, this is pretty cute but it's not as powerful as some of their other ballads. The way the lyrics are divided between them is interesting. They even share a 'deatta.' One sings de, the other sings at and the first sings ta. It makes the song a little bit different but it's nothing special. All in all, a forgettable song.\n\nArtist: Ken Hirai Album: Ken Hirai 10th Anniversary Complete Single Collection '95- '05 Release date: 11/23/05 (album), 10/26/05 (single) Video link: Via YouTube\n\nEnglish translation: I wanna be a pop star and be more to you I’m lifted from the ground in a daze A sparling pop star I spread my wings and do my magic just for you\n\nWhen I’m with you I’m so happy but then I’m so sad when I’m not Taking each other’s hands we run straight into a love affair I can’t fly to the sky but I can sing my song of loneliness at night if that would bring a smile to your cheeks When I held you close for the first time It was as if God himself came down upon me Now my destiny is to be a hero, just for you\n\n*I wanna be a pop star and be more to you I’m lifted from the ground in a daze A sparling pop star I spread my wings and do my magic\n\n**I wanna be your pop star try harder for you so come here so I can hold you A sparling pop star I spread my wings and do my magic just for you\n\nI want to hide in darkness and have you pick up me gently If I’m imporatant to you, then hold me tight I keep walking this road, towards the light Using my right hand to protect you from pain so that I can hold you with my other hand\n\nYou’re gonna be my pop star and be more to me You smile in a daze A sparling pop star In your eyes, I do my magic\n\nYou’re my only pop star try harder for me Hold me, and don’t let go A sparling pop star Right now, in your eyes, I do my magic\n\nAs you fall in love anybody can be anyone’s pop star As God himself came down upon me Ny destiny was to be a hero, just for you\n\n*Repeat **Repeat About the song: POP STAR is most famous for its video where Ken Hirai plays every role. It is a very catchy song and I can guarantee that once you hear it, it'll be very difficult to get it out of your head. All I can really say is listen to it. I hope you'll love it as much as I do.\n\nArtist: Do As Infinity Members: Tomiko Van, Ryo Owatari, Dai Nagao Album: Boukensha Tachi (single) Release date: 9/5/01\n\nEnglish translation: It's all right, I haven't forgotten about That dream from then. I know that hill, that light, About how I shone there more than anything -- I'll walk straight ahead...\n\nContinuing to sigh, shivering a little, I knew that reality Wasn't going to be that easy.\n\nIt's all right, I haven't forgotten about That dream from then. I'm sure there's no way I'll be satisfied If it's something I can easily get right away, A path that only I can open.\n\nEven though it seems I'm pressured By loneliness and worries, I keep a balance that seems like it's going to break.\n\nIf I'm sad for whatever reason, And end up without confidence, I'll once again remember that day, And the hill that holds your promises... The day of that refreshing wind...\n\nA storm of despair with rain striking down... A dream full of tears...\n\nIt's all right, I haven't forgotten about That dream from then I know that hill, that light, About how I shone there more than anything...\n\nIf I'm sad for whatever reason, And end up without confidence, I'll once again remember that day, And the hill that holds your promises... I'll walk straigth ahead... About the song: It's easy to tell why this is a B side song. While there are some interesting string instruments being used, the song is still boring. The chorus parts are drawn out while the verses use a normal pace. It leaves the song feeling a little uneven. If they had left out the slow chorus parts, the sound would have been a bit better. Though I think it would still have a bland feeling to it.\n\nArtist: Mika Nakashima Album: Love Release date: 11/6/03 (previously released as a single on 12/7/02) Video link: Via YouTube\n\nEnglish translation: A while angel’s feathers are fluttering down and start to pile up Cry! In a faithless city, life is sacrificed Crushed down Give a KISS of grief...\n\nIf you sleep, morning will come the land of freedom is scary It’s just foolish kindness a fleeting road is all that remains\n\nWhen this girl cannot sing she turns to search for a reason Along in a group, going into the darkness The murmur of voices is interrupted\n\nThe snow started to lead me for now, it illuminates a shape But it’s just my own beating heart\n\nLooking through the gaps in my fingers The world is quickly narrowed towards the future Cry! Scorn this foolish love Spread your arms and give a KISS of grief...\n\nMy pulse keeps going up as I find the deceitful voice Those without all colors are left with just beauty\n\nBut like the snow eventually it’ll get dirty Unless you get away from this city you’ll live in a dream\n\nA while angel’s feathers are fluttering down and start to pile up Cry! In a faithless city, life is sacrificed Crushed down the angel gives a KISS of grief...\n\nUntill you arrive you will call out for the light you lost God’s voice, is just your throbbing heart\n\nLooking through the gaps in my fingers The world is quickly narrowed towards the future Cry! Scorn this foolish love Spread your arms and give a KISS of grief... About the song: This is one of my absolutely favorite songs from Mika Nakashima. Her voice gives the song a sort of ethereal feeling despite the heavy drumline. It's the type of song that can help lift your spirits and just make you feel good about the world."
