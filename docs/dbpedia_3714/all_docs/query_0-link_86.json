        "text": "American singer, songwriter and rock icon Dave Grohl went through two personal tragedies in the past year, when Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins and Grohl’s mother Virginia died within months of each other.\n\nBut Here We Are, the Foo Fighters’ 11th album, is both a visceral and cathartic cry from a man trying to come to terms with loss. Sonically and thematically, it is the most impactful album put out by the band in years.\n\nGrohl, who came to fame as the drummer of seminal grunge band Nirvana, is back on Foo Fighters’ drum kit for the first time since 2005. His playing is both fierce and impassioned, setting the tone for the massive wall of sound executed by the rest of the group.\n\nIt is an album meant to be played loud to appreciate the band’s constantly shifting dynamics, a throwback to the rock grandeur of early Foo Fighters albums.\n\nA lot of the lyrics are written from a first-person perspective as Grohl sings through a range of emotions – rage, despair, pain and, finally, acceptance.\n\nIn Under You, he grapples with the ghosts of the departed, while 10-minute prog-rock epic The Teacher sees him struggle with finding closure.\n\nIn Show Me How, Grohl’s 17-year-old daughter Violet repeats the line “I’ll take care of everything”, a reassuring refrain that cuts through the despondency and offers hope. – Eddino Abdul Hadi\n\nSingapore Scene: JJ Lin and Steve Aoki –The Show\n\nWhen home-grown Mandopop star JJ Lin staged his two-night concert at the National Stadium last November, those in attendance might recall that he debuted The Show, a song collaboration with American electronic dance music titan Steve Aoki.\n\nThat uplifting stadium-worthy dance number has finally been officially released by Fluxgen, a new music venture between Aoki and Asian-American record label 88rising.\n\nIn a statement, Lin says working with Aoki has always been “fun and easy”. Aoki previously remixed another English track sung by Lin, Not Tonight, in 2021.\n\nLin says The Show “talks about the ups and downs of being in showbiz, and finding strength to keep true to one’s heart in this complicated world”."
