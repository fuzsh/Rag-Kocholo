The gospel sound might be a bit strong for her otherwise lovely voice, but she handles it as if she's been doing it her whole life (just as she tackled the NANA songs on 'The End' with little or no trouble). The best song on the album would have to be 'Mienai Hoshi' (track 2) but the whole album is worth a listen or two. It's by far the best album released in 2007 by any female artist in any country. I love you, Mika.\n\npeople found this helpful\n\n2007/10/26 [Ana] UNITED STATES\n\nFinally... 4\n\nFinally, no more NANA-ness in Mika's 4th album \"YES\". Recommended songs to listen are \"Joy\", \"Yogoreta Hana\" and of course the cover song \"What a Wonderful World\". Worth a listen for people out there who wish to listen to the NANA-less Nakashima Mika once again~ ^_^V\n\npeople found this helpful\n\n2007/03/22 [Orange Lee] SINGAPORE"
