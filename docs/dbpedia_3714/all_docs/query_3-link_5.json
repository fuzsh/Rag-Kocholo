        "text": "Headie One is back with news that he’ll be releasing his second album, The Last One, in June (pre-order here). To mark the announcement, he’s also dropped off visuals for lead track “Cry No More”, which features Stormzy.\n\nAlthough it’s his first album since 2020’s number one debut album, EDNA, fans have hardly been starved of projects. Since dropping that album, we’ve had a solo mixtape, Too Loyal For My Own Good, a European showcase mixtape in No Borders, and last year’s joint project with K-Trap, Strength To Strength.\n\n“Cry No More” is Headie One back at his emotive best, getting candid about his past and his journey “from the court to the roads to the court”. Backing the two artists is an 808s-loaded production from U.S. hitmakers ​​Tay Keith (Travis Scott, Drake), Tommy Parker (Ariana Grande, 21 Savage) and Pooh Beatz (Jack Harlow, DaBaby) with a number that could land the pair back in the charts.\n\nFor the video, Raw Tape directs, tracking Headie and Stormzy through the London streets as they narrate scenes of Londoners’ daily battles, from tensions between an expectant couple to a young teen navigating the roads.\n\nHeadie One, who’s credited as creative director on the video, shares: “This is one of my favourites from the album. I loved the sample and 808s straight away when Tay and Pooh played it in the studio. Stormzy went crazy on it, too.\n\n“The video concept was to show people that everyone has struggles they have to deal with daily. That’s no different to myself and Stormzy; regardless of what people think we’ve achieved in our careers, we still have things in life we have to deal with like everyone else.”\n\nPeep the visuals for “Cry No More” above and be sure to add the song to your playlists."
