Romaji Lyrics[]

hontou no kizu wa itamanai yo

koe to kotoba nakushite

tada namida ga afurete kuru dake

risou ni michita

ano koro no kokoro wa ima wa arehate

mujun bakari no jibun o ikiteru

I don't wanna cry no more.

I don't wanna cry cry cry

ato dono kurai na no ato dono kurai cry cry

tsuyogari dake o buki ni shite

tatakatte kita yowamushi

kimi wa zenbu shittete kureta ne

I don't wanna cry no more.

I don't wanna cry cry cry

nakitai kurai na no kowareru kurai cry cry

oh kono sabishisa ni itsuka owari wa aru no?

I don't wanna cry no more.

I don't wanna cry cry cry

ato dono kurai na no

I don't wanna cry cry cry

ato dono kurai baby nakitai cry cry cry

I don't wanna cry no more.

I don't wanna cry

I don't wanna cry

English Lyrics[]

Real wounds are not painful.

You just lose your voice and words,

and your tears simply start overflowing.

My heart that was full of dreams back then

has now fallen into ruin.

And I'm just living as my conflict-ridden self.

I don't wanna cry no more.

I don't wanna cry and cry and cry.

Just how much more? How much more will I cry and cry?

I was a weakling who's been fighting

with pretending to be strong as my only weapon.

But you knew all about my true self.

I don't wanna cry no more.

I don't wanna cry and cry and cry.

It's so much I'd cry. It's so much I'd fall apart and cry and cry.

Oh, will this loneliness ever come to an end?

I don't wanna cry no more.

I don't wanna cry and cry and cry.

Just how much more do I have?

I don't wanna cry and cry and cry.

How much more, baby? I'll break in tears, cry and cry and cry.

I don't wanna cry no more.

I don't wanna cry. I don't wanna cry.
