Cry No More Recordings are an Australian label who have a deep love for reggae and dub inspired sounds. Founded by life partners Kellie and Clay, releases on the label include tunes by The Springtones, Charlies Flat, Dad Bod Dub and Dubbin' Darryl. We believe that good music doesn't have to cost the earth, that's why we press on 100% recycled vinyl, use recycled packaging and power our small business off solar energy.

Cry No More acknowledges the Whadjuk people, the traditional owners of the land we live on, we pay our respects to Whadjuk elders and First Nations communities.
