        "text": "By the time the actor Joan Morgan, who has died at the age of 99, made The Road To London in 1921, she had already appeared in more than a dozen silent movies. Petite, wide eyed and with blonde curls - looks reminiscent of the silent era star Mary Pickford - she debuted in The Cup Final Mystery (1913), just after a production of Little Lord Fauntleroy, featuring her, had been abandoned; by 1920, she had played Amy Dorrit in the first screen version of Charles Dickens' Little Dorritt.\n\nMorgan's father, Sydney Morgan, directed the majority of her films (including Little Dorritt) and was to play a fateful role in her career. He idolised her, and was jealous of the attention paid her by admirers.\n\nIn The Road To London, Morgan featured with the American actor Bryant Washburn, and, as she told me last year, she had a crush on him. Washburn had wanted to take her to Hollywood, but Sydney vetoed the plan. \"Not being allowed to go was my one major regret,\" she said. \"I know I would have been a success; I had the right look.\"\n\nThe daughter of the actor Evelyn Wood, Morgan was educated privately and attended the Ellerker College for the Children of Gentlefolk in Richmond, Surrey. In 1915, having appeared in The World's Desire and Light (both directed by Sydney), she went briefly to the United States with her mother.\n\nWhile there, she appeared in The Reapers, The Perils Of Divorce and The Last Sentence (all 1916). Back in London that November, she made her stage debut at the Apollo in A Pierrot's Christmas, and continued to appear in the theatre into the 1920s.\n\nIn 1917, she was Ellen Terry's granddaughter in the film Her Greatest Performance. Seven films with Sydney followed, including a part as the spoilt aristocrat Lady Noggs in Lady Noggs: Peeress (1920), before the Eugene Mullin-directed The Road To London.\n\nIn 1922, Morgan appeared in an adaptation of H Rider Haggard's Swallow, filmed on location in South Africa, and the following year she made Shadow Of Egypt, again directed by her father. She adored being in Egypt, as she recalled as recently as last April: \"I look at my faded pictures of me next to the Sphinx, and chuckle; it almost looks new compared to how it appears today.\"\n\nAfter Morgan's parents separated in 1926, she stayed with her mother, although she was still to make two more films with her father, A Window In Piccadilly (1928) and her final film - and a talkie - Her Reputation (1931).\n\nHowever, just as Morgan was beginning to take on more mature roles, which stretched her as an actor, the British film industry was coming under increasing pressure from Hollywood. \"Daddy and others like him were unable to compete with the Americans\", she said. \"So, that was it - career over.\" The only complete copy of any of Morgan's films still in existence is A Lowland Cinderella (1921).\n\nSo Morgan began to write, under the pen-names of Iris North and Joan Wentworth Wood. Her film work included Contraband Love (1931) - directed by her father - The Callbox Mystery (1932), The Flag Lieutenant (1933), Chelsea Life (1933), Faces (1934), The Minstrel Boy (1937), Lily Of Laguna (1938) and Honeymoon Merry-Go-Round (1940). She also wrote a dozen novels and a dozen stage plays, including This Was A Woman, which, four years after its West End run, was filmed in 1948. Later, she wrote television plays; her book, The Hanging Wood (1950), was adapted forthe A Question Of Guilt television series in 1977.\n\nDuring the second world war, from 1942 to 1944, Morgan worked at the Ministry of Supply. She also wrote a book about evacuees, Ding Dong Dell (1943). After the war, she moved into the house conversion business, which resulted in another book, The Casebook Of Capability Morgan (1965).\n\nIn 1996, Morgan made something of a comeback as the guest of honour at the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of British cinema. At a grand gala in Whitehall, clad in turquoise silks and a fox fur, she signed autograph books for fans originally on the lookout for screen stars of a more recent generation. It was, she told photographers, \"such fun to be back\".\n\nFour years ago, she moved from her home of 23 years, a Palladian toll house at Henley-on-Thames, into a nursing home. Her room was filled with mementos of her career. \"She was the last of a kind,\" said a member of the staff, \"an Edwardian lady whose graciousness should be noted by some of today's stars.\" She leaves no survivors"
