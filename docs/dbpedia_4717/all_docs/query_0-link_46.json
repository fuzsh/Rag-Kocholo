        "text": "The summer movie season keeps on rolling in theaters this month with the likes of “Despicable Me 4” and “Deadpool and Wolverine.” But over on streaming platforms, some giant tentpoles and acclaimed indies from earlier in 2024 are gearing up to make their own debuts.\n\nWarner Bros., for example, is launching “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” on Max after a successful box office run that saw it become the studio’s highest-grossing MonsterVerse movie to date with $570 million worldwide. The film joins “Dune: Part Two,” “Wonka” and “Barbie” as the latest recent Warner Bros. blockbuster in the Max streaming library.\n\nMax’s library is also getting a boost with the arrival of the A24 queer crime thriller “Loves Lies Bleeding,” directed by Rose Glass and starring Kristen Stewart in an acclaimed performance. The movie earned $8 million at the domestic box office in the spring after a buzzy world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January. Sundance was also the launching pad for the hit documentary “Skywalkers: A Love Story,” which Netflix picked up and is also streaming this month.\n\nPerhaps the biggest new streaming offering of July is Netflix’s “Beverly Hills Cop: Alex F,” the long-awaited fourth installment in Eddie Murphy’s comedy franchise. Murphy had a streaming hit for Amazon Prime Video by reviving “Coming to America” for a sequel in 2021. Can he do the same with “Beverly Hills Cop” at Netflix? The streaming giant is surely hoping so with a prime July 4 weekend release.\n\nCheck out a rundown below of all the best new movies coming to streaming platforms this July."
