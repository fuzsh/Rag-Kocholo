        "text": "Bettelheim (1986) contends that Cinderella is the best-known and mostloved fairy tale with over 700 documented versions. The character and story of Cinderella is considered as exemplary, showing a positive message, where modesty and humility are rewarded (Zipes, 2006; Barthelmes ,2018). Born as an oral tale, it can be already found in ancient Egypt and Ancient China, and later being consolidated in Europe with literary versions such as La Gata Cerentolla1, or Aschenputtel2. In the last few years, especially at the beginning of the 2000s, The Walt Disney Company has been exposed to negative criticism regarding its portrayal of female characters (Menise, 2019), especially princesses. The 1990s feminist film theory developed an increasingly important role in many areas of academic study (Nelmes, 2011). Progressive critics argue with the idea of how badly, submissive and fragile the female figure had been represented within this company, along with sexist, racist and classicist values (Digón, 2005; Orenstein, 2006; Best & Lowney, 2009). Not only the female characters, but also the productions as a whole too, with ideas concerning that Disney intends to imbue values related to respect for authority, traditional nuclear family, defense of consumerism among others (Giroux, 2001). When looking at the points of study in this area, Cinderella is the target for many frustrated writers who try to convince and argue how this female character has nothing positive to transmit to children, neither adult generation, as in the studies from Yolen (1977) and Laderman (2000). The ones which are commoner to find, are those dealing with the dependence Cinderella shows from the prince, as found in the “Cinderella Syndrome”, created by Lewin in 1976. Additionally, other critics focus on the outer beauty as a tool for accomplishing goals is key and without it, you are lost. (Marín & Solís 2017). Submission and lack of power is often criticized as well. 1 Giambatista Basile (1634). 2 Brothers Grimm (1812). As a result, we have been able to see princesses who save a nation (Mulan 1998), hunt in the forest (Brave 2012), and cross the ocean (Moana 2016), and therefore generating comparisons with the old “classic” princesses from the XX century and judging them as apparently not morally exemplary and victims of a sexist world. Fairy tale scholar Jack Zipes (1997) has argued that, currently, children’s understanding and image associations of the fairy tale Cinderella are so closely linked with the Disney’s animated film Cinderella of 1950, that they are inseparable. However, the huge social impact that the American company carries, displaces the original version from Perrault to the shadows and performs a global hegemony in relation to the representation of the characters and the story. As Baker (2007), stresses: “When asked about Cinderella, the children responded with a characterization that is consistent of Disney’s well-known image”. (p.721) From my point of view, it could be seen as something unfair for Perrault’s version due to the fact that can be forgotten, leaving the character of Cinderella automatically linked to Disney. However, Perrault’s version was neither the first one; prior to these, authors such as Basile (1634) had already written their version, and it was at the same time an inspiration to Perrault. Nonetheless, Disney’s film adds the reference to the French author in its opening credits3. The chosen topic for this paper stemmed from those negative critics, which I interpret as a superficial reading, ignoring the full context of the story. Thus, I will demonstrate, based on a rigorous and systematic analysis, that Cinderella provides valuable ethical and moral values such as resilience, forgiveness and patience, and how the character of Cinderella transmits and performs them. These morality principles are going to play a very relevant role in the dissertation because of the fact that they will be the sustain of my analysis\n\nSymbolism is a literary device that uses symbols—may it be words, people, marks, locations, or abstract ideas that represent something beyond the literal meaning. While in literature, symbols are often characters, settings, images, or other motifs that stand in for bigger ideas (Master Class 2020). In this study, the researchers aimed to answer: (1) What are the different literary symbolisms in the selected children’s stories; (2) What are the meaning and interpretation of each symbol presented in the novel; and (3) What is the significance use of symbols in teaching literary device? Text and data analysis is used to know the different symbols in the novels and the category of each symbol according to Frye theory of Symbolism. The researchers made use of qualitative research-descriptive approach to identify different literary symbolisms in the selected novels. Based on the data analysis, different symbolisms are found in the novels that represented various meaning and interpretations. The study concludes that symbols in each selected children’s stories displays interpretation and meaning. These meaning and interpretation rely on how they function and use accordingly to respective stories. The symbolism found in the selected novels will be categorized based on Frye's Theory of Symbols: literal, descriptive, formal, mythical, and anagogic. Qualitative data analysis was used to utilize the different symbols in each novel to explore how symbols functioned in the novels, how symbols were used and interpreted in the text, and how symbols were adapted in teaching literature. Thus, the research is all about the connection of text and different symbols. Keywords: symbols, symbolism, novels, semiotic, Frye’s theories, meanings and interpretations"
