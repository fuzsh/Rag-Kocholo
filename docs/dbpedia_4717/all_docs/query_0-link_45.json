        "text": "Articles By Eric Hillis\n\nFirst Look Review - \"Oddity\"\n\nOver the last decade a crop of talented horror filmmakers has emerged from Ireland, with the likes of Lee Cronin (The Hole in the Ground) and Kate Dolan (You Are Not My Mother) quickly snapped up by Hollywood to helm instalments of the Evil Dead and M3GAN franchises. On the basis of his 2021 debut, Caveat, I suspected writer/director Damian McCarthy might be the most talented of this bunch, and his second film, Oddity, confirms my suspicions. In just two films, McCarthy has displayed more creativity, ingenuity and originality than many genre filmmakers manage across an entire filmography. As with Caveat, there are moments in Oddity that will have horror fans leaning forward and thinking \"Well, that's something I haven't seen before.\"\n\npublished on 08/13/2024\n\nFirst Look Review - \"Good One\"\n\nNew Zealand filmmaker Roger Donaldson was a founding member of the Aussie/Kiwi New Wave of the '70s before succumbing to the lure of Hollywood in the '80s, as did so many from that movement. That acclaimed wave of films tackled such subjects as gender, colonialism and inter-personal relationships, often by contrasting \"civilized\" people against the rugged backdrop of untameable terrain. Though it's set in the US, the spirit of that antipodean movement lives on in Good One, the writing/directing debut of India Donaldson, daughter of Roger.\n\npublished on 08/09/2024\n\nFirst Look Review - \"Detained\"\n\nThe success of Reservoir Dogs gave rise to a slew of '90s indie thrillers based around unscrupulous characters turning on one another in a single location as they attempt to unravel a mystery. Set entirely within a police precinct and centred on the questioning of a suspect, the post-Reservoir Dogs thriller director Felipe Mucci's Detained most resembles is Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects, right down to the inclusion of a mythical underworld figure.\n\npublished on 08/01/2024\n\nFirst Look Review - \"Starve Acre\"\n\nThe current crop of cinematic folk-horror hasn't yielded much of a harvest in terms of quality. Perhaps the 21st century just isn't a good fit for this sub-genre, which had its heyday (or hay day) in the '70s, particularly in Britain. The cream of this crop amounts to a handful of movies and TV shows made in the UK in that post-flower-power decade that saw many turn away from the progress of the modern world and embrace \"the old ways.\" As such, folk-horror has become inextricably linked with beige and corduroy.\n\npublished on 07/31/2024\n\nNew Release Review - \"The Beast Within\"\n\nOne of the best indie horror movies to emerge from the UK in recent years is Jennifer Sheridan's 2020 film Rose: A Love Story. Sheridan took a classic monster - the vampire - and managed to create something fresh by exploring how someone might deal with a loved one who happens to be such a creature. The film was focussed on a man who lives with his vampire wife in a remote part of England, and has found a way to make their unconventional situation work...until it doesn't. With The Beast Within, director Alexander J. Farrell and co-writer Greer Ellison attempt to do something similar with another classic monster, the werewolf.\n\npublished on 07/26/2024\n\nNew Release Review - \"Only The River Flows\"\n\n1990s media was obsessed with serial killers. Movies, TV shows and novels of the era were filled with dogged investigators tracking elusive murderers, an obsession likely sparked by the emergence of DNA tracing at the bginning of the decade, which revealed that many hitherto unsolved murders might actually be the work of lone killers. Filmmakers, TV showrunners and novelists used the premise of the hunt for a serial killer to tap into the angst that was in the air as an uncertain new millennium loomed on the horizon. Arriving within weeks of one another in the summer of 2024 are two '90s set thrillers that channel this angst, the American horror hit Longlegs and director Wei Shujun's thriller Only the River Flows.\n\npublished on 07/25/2024\n\nFirst Look Review - \"Oddity\"\n\nOver the last decade a crop of talented horror filmmakers has emerged from Ireland, with the likes of Lee Cronin (The Hole in the Ground) and Kate Dolan (You Are Not My Mother) quickly snapped up by Hollywood to helm instalments of the Evil Dead and M3GAN franchises.

As with Caveat, there are moments in Oddity that will have horror fans leaning forward and thinking \"Well, that's something I haven't seen before.\"\n\npublished on 07/19/2024\n\nNew Release Review - \"Twisters\"\n\nAlmost 30 years after Twister swept into cinemas, Hollywood's allergy to anything resembling an original idea gives us a belated sequel that, as has proven the case with so many of these endeavours, plays more like a remake than a continuation. While recent revivals like Halloween, Top Gun and Beverly Hills Cop have been built around returning protagonists, Helen Hunt is curiously absent here, probably because only the horror genre allows actresses over a certain age to headline franchise instalments.\n\npublished on 07/17/2024\n\nNew Release Review - \"Maxxxine\"\n\nWith 2022's X, Ti West delivered a successful homage to hicksploitation thrillers like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Eaten Alive and Motel Hell. Hicksploitation is one of the easier sub-genres to imitate as all you need are some good-looking young folk to be butchered by redneck grotesqueries. That said, many filmmakers have tried and failed to emulate this simple formula, with only X and Devereux Milburn's underseen Honeydew managing to pull it off in recent years.\n\npublished on 07/14/2024\n\nNew Release Review - \"Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F\"\n\n1980s Hollywood was fuelled by a simple formula, the \"fish out of water.\" Whether it be an alien landing in the suburbs; a boorish, middle-aged Jewish comic attending college; or a young boy finding himself in the body of Tom Hanks; audiences lapped this stuff up. With 1983's fish out of water comedy Trading Places, director John Landis moulded Eddie Murphy into the '80s equivalent of Groucho Marx. Just as the Jewish Marx had done in the '30s, the African-American Murphy built his shtick around mocking wealthy white people. The movie that cemented this status was 1984's Beverly Hills Cop, in which Murphy played Axel Foley, an unfiltered Detroit undercover cop who found himself in the alien surrounds of that American centre of white elitism, Beverly Hills. The plot - something, something corruption, or something - was irrelevant. Audiences turned up to see Murphy crack wise, do funny voices and take the piss out of rich folk, and he did so with a unique and natural ease that no comic performer has matched in the decades since.\n\npublished on 07/09/2024\n\nNew Release Review - \"A Quiet Place: Day One\"\n\nFor the third installment of his hit sci-fi franchise, A Quiet Place: Day One, John Krasinski hands the reins to fellow Polish-American filmmaker Michael Sarnoski. If you've seen Sarnoski's impressive debut, the Nicolas Cage vehicle Pig, you'll note similar elements here. As with Pig, Day One features a protagonist who has retreated into their shell, whose one friend is an animal, and who embarks on a quest in a major American city. Both movies trumpet the pleasure of simple food in key scenes. Sarnoski manages to weave his own interests into Krasinski's series in surprisingly smooth fashion, suggesting that the world of A Quiet Place can accommodate a variety of stories and perspectives.\n\npublished on 07/04/2024\n\nNew Release Review: \"Kinds of Kindness\"\n\nYorgos Lanthimos reunites with Efthimis Filippou, his regular screenwriter before his recent Tony McNamara collaborations, for Kinds of Kindness, an anthology film consisting of three tales, all of which feature the same recurring cast members. Part of the appeal of portmanteau films is that if you're not vibing with one story you know another will come along pretty soon. With each segment running close to an hour, that's not the case here. If the absurdist tone doesn't hook you from the start, you'll likely find Kinds of Kindness a test of your patience. But while it's exhausting and unwieldy in stretches, it's entertaining and amusing often enough to make it a worthwhile venture for those already onboard with Lanthimos.\n\npublished on 07/01/2024\n\nNew Release Review - \"The Bikeriders\"\n\nHave you ever seen any of those awful British movies about football hooligans that seem to be released straight to VOD on a weekly basis? You know the type. They always star some combination of Danny Dyer, Craig Fairbrass and Tamer Hassan, sometimes all three. The directors always try to emulate Goodfellas, but their attempts to use voiceover to draw us into a world of pathetic masculinity always come off as lazy storytelling. Most of these movies open with a scene in which the protagonist finds himself cornered by some rivals, and the frame freezes just as he takes a punch to his mush, followed by some sort of exaltation along the lines of \"You're probably wondering how a geezer like me got myself in such a norty pickle.\"\n\npublished on 06/26/2024\n\nNew Release Review - \"Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter One\"\n\nOnce in a while a critic will have the cheek to publish a review despite not having seen a movie in its entirety. \"I've seen this a hundred times before,\" is how they inevitably defend themselves when they're rightly attacked for such a lack of professionalism and respect for the medium. With Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter One, Kevin Costner has forced all of his new film's reviewers into the role of the unprofessional critic who forms an opinion despite having only seen half a movie, or in this case maybe only a third, or even a quarter. Costner's project is ambitiously spread across four films, with three reportedly already shot and two guaranteed a release at time of writing.\n\npublished on 06/24/2024\n\nNew Release Review - \"The Exorcism\"\n\nYou wait your whole life for a schlocky exorcism movie starring Russell Crowe only for two to come along at once. Hot on the heels of the entertaining if unoriginal The Pope's Exorcist comes writer/director Joshua John Miller's The Exorcism. Let's face it, all of these movies are to some degree knockoffs of William Friedkin's The Exorcist. But The Exorcism isn't simply another Exorcist wannabe; it's intrinsically tied in to Friedkin's film.\n\npublished on 06/19/2024\n\nAdvertise with New Jersey Stage for $50-$100 per month, click here for info\n\nNew Release Review - \"The Watched\"\n\nIshana Night Shyamalan's feature debut, The Watched (or The Watchers as it's known in North America; who knows what's behind the name change?), shows she has her father's eye but few of his other talents. Like Brandon Cronenberg, Ishana seems set on embracing her father's influence rather than purposely shying away from any comparisons. On paper The Watched reads like exactly the sort of movie you might expect from daddy Shyamalan, but where Cronenberg Junior has proven himself capable of replicating both his father's thematic obsessions and talent, Shyamalan Junior displays none of her old man's storytelling skills. Watching The Watched, I couldn't help but wonder if this is what it's like to watch an M. Night movie if you're not a fan of his distinctive shtick.\n\npublished on 06/17/2024\n\nFirst Look Review - 'In A Violent Nature'\n\nRecounting his first time performing as a nervous young pianist on stage with Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock claimed that halfway through the show the legendary trumpeter leaned over his shoulder and whispered the words \"Don't play the butter notes kid.\" Initially puzzled, Hancock tried to wrap his head around what Davis meant by this odd instruction. Then it clicked. Davis was telling the piano prodigy to leave out the obvious notes, to create something fresh through omission. Hancock had been playing jazz for a while by that point, but that was the day he finally understood jazz.\n\npublished on 06/10/2024\n\nNew Release Review - 'The Dead Don't Hurt'\n\nViggo Mortensen's Falling was exactly the sort of intimate, talky drama you might expect an actor to choose for their debut as writer/director. For his follow-up Mortensen has opted for something that seems very different on the surface, a western, but while there's gun-slingin', horse ridin' and a villain clad in black, it's very much a character-based western of the sort that were common before the Italians stripped the genre down to its action basics.\n\npublished on 06/09/2024\n\nNew Release Review - \"The Beast\"\n\nBertrand Bonello's previous film, Coma, was an intimate project shot within the confines of his home during the pandemic lockdown. His latest, The Beast, is a sprawling sci-fi thriller that plays out over three timelines on both sides of the Atlantic. Despite such differences, the two movies are thematically joined at the hip, and I would recommend seeing them in the order Bonello made them, though modern distribution patterns being what they are, that may not be possible for most viewers.\n\npublished on 05/31/2024\n\nNew Release Review - FURIOSA: A MAD MAX SAGA\n\nThe success of George Miller's first two Mad Max movies gave rise to a wave of knockoffs in the early '80s. Mostly Italian, these movies aped the post-punk petrolhead aesthetic of Miller's films, with Mohawk-sporting warlords crashing dune buggies into one another in the Spanish desert. While some of those movies were fun and provided cheap thrills for an '80s audience eager to feed their new VCRs, they lacked something. For a start they couldn't compete with Miller's craft, but there was another key element missing: they weren't Australian.\n\npublished on 05/27/2024\n\nFirst Look Review - COMA\n\nThe lockdowns of the COVID pandemic feel like a lifetime ago and yet we're still seeing the release of films that were shot under those restrictive conditions. While most of us were making sourdough bread and wearing our PJs all day long, the world's filmmakers were busying themselves by shooting whatever they could in the confines of their homes. Bertrand Bonello was no different. In 2021 he shot Coma in his home and a secluded forest. In contrast with most of the filmmakers who did likewise, Bonello has created something worthwhile here, a film that is often baffling, frequently entertaining and ultimately touching.\n\npublished on 05/18/2024\n\nReview: \"Wildcat\"\n\nFew actors have as much credit in the cinephile bank as Ethan Hawke. While all around him actors are dropping their pants for the Disney dildo, Hawke insists on taking roles he's actually interested in, and working with filmmakers he respects. Nobody bats an eyelid when Hawke name drops some literary figure or arthouse auteur in an interview. We fully believe in him as a well read, thoughtful renaissance man. That wasn't always the case though. Back in 1996 he was roundly mocked for having the audacity to write a novel, met with the sort of snobbish \"stick to the day job, stay in your lane\" derision we now see levelled at any sports personalities who dare to express an interest in any subject outside their competitive field. Hawke's latest film as director, Flannery O'Connor biopic Wildcat, is so terrible that even the kindest of critics may think Hawke might be better off sticking to his day job after all.\n\npublished on 05/16/2024\n\nREVIEW: \"The Nest\"\n\nIt’s been an agonizing nine-year wait for writer-director Sean Durkin to follow up his outstanding 2011 debut Martha Marcy May Marlene, but he’s finally gotten the finger out and delivered a second feature. And boy, has he delivered! Returning to the UK, where he was raised as a child and where he directed the 2013 Channel 4 mini-series Southcliffe, Durkin has given us a doom-laden rejoinder to the current rose-tinted nostalgia for that most awful of decades, the 1980s. The Nest is a moody family drama that plays like The Omen with Thatcher swapped in for Satan.\n\npublished on 09/22/2020\n\nREVIEW: \"The Devil All The Time\"\n\nOver the last decade or so, writer/director Antonio Campos has established himself as a master of intimate, moody character studies. His movies thus far have been rigidly focused on troubled individuals who pose an existential threat to either themselves (Christine) or others (Afterschool; Simon Killer). It’s safe to say he has an interest in homicide and suicide, which might make him the prime candidate to adapt Donald Ray Pollock’s The Devil All the Time, a novel in which almost every character either takes their own life or that of another member of its sprawling cast.\n\npublished on 09/22/2020\n\nREVIEW: \"Unhinged\"\n\nDirector Derrick Borte’s road rage thriller Unhinged belongs to the tradition of movies in which a protagonist finds themselves targeted by a deranged motorist. This was a particularly popular storyline in American TV movies of the ‘70s, when car ownership had exploded to the point where the car became an extension of its owner’s personality, for better or worse. Small screen thrillers like Duel, Night Terror and Death Car on the Freeway exploited the potential for chaos that can arise when a motorist decides to defy the social contract we agree to adhere to whenever we get behind the wheel. Unhinged adds very modern elements like the stress of the gig economy, surveillance and entitlement culture to a formula that always makes for a gripping thriller.\n\npublished on 08/23/2020\n\nREVIEW: \"Sputnik\"\n\nThe Soviet Union used space exploration as a means of keeping its populace onboard with its goals, and Russians embraced their cosmonauts as folk-heroes, a symbol of national pride, something to aspire to. It’s no surprise then that science-fiction, both literary and cinematic, prospered in the USSR. Many Soviet sci-fi films were propagandistic, while some filmmakers, notably Tarkovsky, used the genre to conceal their contempt for the system. In recent years we’ve seen the emergence of a generation of Russian filmmakers influenced by Hollywood sci-fi, whose films are neither political nor propagandistic but rather vacuously glossy imitations of American genre product.\n\npublished on 08/23/2020\n\nREVIEW: \"Carmilla\"\n\nWhat must it have been like to be a young, cinemagoing lesbian in the early 1970s? Your sexuality was still far from being accepted yet on the cinema screen lesbian vampires couldn’t sink their teeth into their same-sex victims quickly enough. Until quite recently, the lesbian vampire movies of that period - The Vampire Lovers, Vampyres, Daughters of Darkness, The Blood Spattered Bride and Vampyros Lesbos, to name but a few - represented the closest we had come to being presented with something approaching a mainstream queer cinema canon.\n\npublished on 07/24/2020\n\nREVIEW: \"The Old Guard\"\n\nOne of the primary reasons many viewers struggle with superhero movies is the lack of intimate stakes. If a movie’s protagonist is the most powerful being on the planet, or sometimes even the galaxy, it’s difficult for us to care about their predicament, as they’re rarely under any real threat. Superman II, still the peak of superhero cinema, had to remove its eponymous hero’s superpowers to create some drama we could invest in, but even that ended up in an intergalactic punch-up.\n\npublished on 07/24/2020\n\nREVIEW: \"Exit Plan\"\n\nDanish director Jonas Alexander Arnby’s Exit Plan (whose original title translates as the not so subtle ‘Suicide Tourist’) follows a long fictional tradition of healthy protagonists who find themselves trapped in sinister healthcare institutions, usually after having themselves committed in order to conduct an investigation. This idea has its roots in Thomas Mann’s 1924 novel ‘The Magic Mountain’, which Gore Verbinski loosely adapted in 2016 as A Cure for Wellness. The general premise can be found in Mark Robson’s Bedlam and Sam Fuller’s Shock Corridor; not to mention a host of various TV shows, most notably the penultimate season of Dallas, in which Larry Hagman’s JR Ewing checks himself into an asylum in the hopes of convincing a resident of signing over oil shares.\n\npublished on 06/23/2020\n\nREVIEW: \"Da 5 Bloods\"\n\nGet on the Bus meets Rambo in Spike Lee’s Vietnam set geriatric action flick Da 5 Bloods. The title refers to five African-American men who served alongside each other during the Vietnam War, or as the Vietnamese characters they meet along the way here call it, “The American War.” Inspirational squad leader ‘Stormin’ Norman (Chadwick Boseman) perished in combat in 1971, but his legacy lives on in the hearts of the surviving quartet - Paul (Delroy Lindo), Otis (Clarke Peters), Melvin (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) and Eddie (Norm Lewis) - who know that without his leadership and guidance, they may not have made it out of the jungle alive.\n\npublished on 06/23/2020\n\nA Good Woman Is Hard To Find\n\nTo get ahead in life you need to be a bitch. That’s the advice a mother gives her daughter in director Abner Pastoll’s Northern Ireland set thriller A Good Woman Is Hard to Find, which is available via Video on Demand. Over the film’s runtime we’ll watch said daughter, young widow Sarah, go from a timid bundle of nerves to an avenging angel in convincing fashion, thanks to a stellar performance from Sarah Bolger.\n\npublished on 05/25/2020\n\nREVIEW: \"Dreamland\"\n\nIt may seem strange to claim that an actor whose IMDB page currently lists 213 performing credits has been under-utilized throughout his career, but that’s the case with Canadian character actor Stephen McHattie. Thanks to the vast amount of American productions that shoot north of the border for tax reasons, the Canuck star has never been out of work, but meaty roles have largely eluded him, and he’s best known to casual viewers as “that guy” who crops up in baddy of the week roles in TV shows.\n\npublished on 05/25/2020\n\nREVIEW: \"She’s Allergic To Cats\"\n\nIf, like me, you’re one of the few nutters who enjoyed David Robert Mitchell’s widely lambasted Under the Silver Lake and fancy another hit of Los Angeles set weirdness, writer/director Michael Reich has you covered with his lo-fi, barely feature length oddity She’s Allergic to Cats.\n\npublished on 04/25/2020\n\nREVIEW: \"The Sharks\"\n\nImagine if in Jaws, the resident of Amity Island who took the appearance of a great white shark most seriously wasn’t the town sheriff but a hormonal 14-year-old girl. The resulting film might be something like writer/director Lucía Garibaldi’s feature debut, The Sharks, which scooped the Directing Award in World Cinema at this year’s Sundance Film Festival.\n\npublished on 04/25/2020\n\nREVIEW: \"The Hunt\"\n\nFew short stories have impacted cinema as much as Richard Connell’s 1924 tale ‘The Most Dangerous Game’, which tells the story of a Russian aristocrat who hunts human prey on his remote island. Along with a direct 1932 screen adaptation from the team behind King Kong, Connell’s story has indirectly inspired a host of movies from around the world including John Woo’s Hard Target, the Roger Corman produced The Woman Hunt, the Ozploitation classic Turkey Shoot, the racially charged Surviving the Game, the trash masterpiece Deadly Prey, the recent Ready or Not, and to some extent The Hunger Games and its Japanese antecedent Battle Royale.\n\npublished on 03/23/2020\n\nREVIEW: \"The Truth\"\n\nArguably the most interesting filmmaker to emerge in the last couple of decades, Hirokazu Kore-eda has worked at a prolific rate, giving us roughly a movie a year, most of which have met with critical acclaim. With his latest, The Truth, Kore-eda leaves his native Japan to try his hand at European cinema, and it’s a remarkably effortless transition. If you didn’t know this French set drama was written and directed by Kore-eda, you might easily believe it a work of a local filmmaker like Mikhaël Hers, André Téchiné or Robert Guediguian, so readily has Kore-eda adapted his voice to an alien continent and culture.\n\npublished on 03/23/2020\n\nREVIEW: \"You Go To My Head\"\n\nWith his solo debut feature (having previously co-directed 1995’s The Blue Villa with Alain Robbe-Grillet), You Go to My Head, director Dimitri de Clercq evokes everything from the psychosexual dynamics of 1940s melodramas to the dusty desolation of Ozploitation, with dashes of Hitchcock, Nicolas Roeg and Richard Stanley thrown in for good measure. The result is a heady brew that doesn’t always work, but for long periods of its narrative, de Clercq’s film keeps you gripped, and marks the veteran producer turned newbie director as one to watch.\n\npublished on 02/26/2020\n\nREVIEW: \"Emma\"\n\nA few years back, Anya Taylor-Joy delivered a striking performance in Thoroughbreds, a blackly comic teen thriller in which she played a spoilt rich kid who takes a troubled young girl (played equally brilliantly by Olivia Cooke) under her wing. The dynamic was reminiscent of that between Emma Woodhouse and Harriet Smith, the young central characters of Jane Austen’s 1815 novel ‘Emma’. With first time director Autumn de Wilde at the helm, Taylor-Joy has returned directly to the source for an adaptation of ‘Emma’ that is too reverent to the novel for its own good.\n\npublished on 02/26/2020\n\nREVIEW: \"Uncut Gems\"\n\nOver their relatively short filmmaking careers, the Safdie brothers (Josh and Benny) have established themselves as the chroniclers du jour of New York street life, employing that city in a way rarely seen since the 1970s. They’ve earned a reputation for mining striking performances from inexperienced actors like Arielle Holmes and Buddy Duress, but recently they’ve begun dropping superstars into their unique mix, with Robert Pattinson leading a largely otherwise amateur cast in their previous film, Good Time.\n\npublished on 01/25/2020\n\nREVIEW: \"Portrait Of A Lady On Fire\"\n\nThe underlying eroticism that can be found in much gothic storytelling comes to the fore in writer / director Céline Sciamma’s Portrait of a Lady on Fire. It’s a gothic romance that holds to its tradition for much of its running time, keeping its passions suppressed before ripping away its bodice for a celebration of forbidden sensual pleasures indulged away from the disapproving eyes of society.\n\npublished on 01/25/2020\n\nREVIEW: \"1917\"\n\nWhen Hitchcock attempted to create the illusion that his 1948 thriller Rope had been shot in a single take, he was forced to disguise cuts every 10 minutes, as that’s how long a reel of film lasted. In today’s digital filmmaking era no such limitations apply, which is why long takes and ‘single take’ movies are growing increasingly popular. Give a filmmaker too much...well, rope and they can hang themselves, with many long take sequences and single take movies feeling gimmicky at best, a waste of the powerful tool of editing at worst. The best of the recent crop of single take movies is the German thriller Victoria, which uses the format to immerse us in the head of its titular heroine, who is swept along on an increasingly dangerous adventure that plays out in real-time as dawn breaks on Berlin.\n\npublished on 12/25/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"Little Women\"\n\nGreta Gerwig’s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women opens and closes with two cracking scenes. Playing an amalgamation of Alcott and her novel’s heroine, Jo March, Saoirse Ronan sparkles in her interactions with Dashwood, a stoic publisher played by the always watchable Tracy Letts. Not wanting sexism to scupper her chances, Jo presents him with one of her short stories, which she claims was written by “a friend.”\n\npublished on 12/25/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"In Fabric\"\n\nThe elevator (or in this case, dumb waiter) pitch for In Fabric, writer/director Peter Strickland's fourth feature, ostensibly concerns a cursed dress, which may remind horror buffs of Robert Bloch's short story 'The Weird Tailor', adapted for the screen as an episode of the '60s Boris Karloff hosted show Thriller and an installment of the 1972 Amicus anthology Asylum. Splitting the film into two distinct though interconnected stories, Strickland's movie recalls the output of Amicus, and while he continues to channel the exotic spirit of '70s Euro horror, In Fabric is distinctly British in its self-deprecating humor. A succinct elevator pitch might read 'Dario Argento's Are You Being Served?'\n\npublished on 11/26/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"The Good Liar\"\n\nIan McKellen and director Bill Condon reteam once again for this adaptation of Nicholas Searle\n\npublished on 11/26/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"Joker\"\n\nAt some point in the late 20th century society decided that clowns were no longer funny, that rather they were the stuff of nightmares. At some point in the early 21st century Hollywood decided that simple entertainment was no longer enough, that movies in which heroes prance around in spandex should be competing for Oscars, and so the Hollywood blockbuster became as dull and soulless as the sort of worthy social dramas we previously associated with Awards season. When Heath Ledger won a posthumous statuette for his performance as Batman’s arch-nemesis The Joker in Christoper Nolan’s gritty, Michael Mann/William Friedkin influenced The Dark Knight, the comic book movie had well and truly grown up.\n\npublished on 10/25/2019\n\nMaleficent: Mistress of Evil\n\nUnlike the redundant ‘live-action’ updates of Cinderella and The Lion King, 2014’s Maleficent saw Disney take one of their existing properties, Sleeping Beauty, and deliver a fresh take that cleverly played with the themes bubbling under the surface of that classic fairy tale. Maleficent, formerly a one-dimensional villain, was put front and center in a movie that explored such ideas as nature vs nurture, the futility of revenge, and whether or not true love really exists. Most surprisingly of all, it served as a potent allegory for how victims of sexual abuse are often shunned by society. But importantly, it never took its eye off the fact that it was primarily a fantasy romp aimed at children.\n\npublished on 10/25/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"Hustlers\"\n\nBob Fosse and Martin Scorsese have a lot to answer for. American filmmakers now seem incapable of telling a true crime story without aping the templates established in Fosse’s Star 80 and Scorsese’s Goodfellas. Lorene Scafaria’s Hustlers (let’s take some comfort from the resistance to titling it ‘Hu$tler$’), based on a 2015 New York magazine article about sociopathic strippers, ticks all the boxes you expect it might. Fake talking head interviews? Check. Extended tracking shots through nightclubs? Check. It’s a Wonderful Life style freeze frames? Check. Voiceover narration delivered over slo-mo sequences? Check. Top 40 soundtrack? Check.\n\npublished on 09/24/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"Ad Astra\"\n\nSteven Spielberg has long maintained that had he made Close Encounters of the Third Kind after marrying and having kids, it would have ended very differently. After becoming a family man, Spielberg balked at the idea that a father and husband would walk away from his family and take a ride off into the great unknown with a bunch of aliens. Has writer/director James Gray become a family man in the short time between his previous movie, 2016’s The Lost City of Z, and his latest, Ad Astra? His new film plays like something of a thematic rejoinder to his last one.\n\npublished on 09/24/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"Gwen\"\n\nWriter/director William McGregor’s feature debut Gwen is an effective example of what can be achieved on a low budget with a small but talented cast and a striking location. Where most British indie filmmakers struggle to mine the cinematic potential of Britain’s over-exposed urban areas, McGregor sets his folk-horror tinged gothic drama in the spectacularly moody Welsh valleys.\n\npublished on 08/27/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"The Peanut Butter Falcon\"\n\n“I’m a Down Syndrome person,” proclaims Zak (Zack Gottsagen), the unique protagonist of first time filmmakers Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz’s The Peanut Butter Falcon. “I don’t give a shit,” is the terse response from Tyler (Shia LaBeouf), the troublemaker who reluctantly takes Zak under his wing. It may seem like a cruel exchange, but for Zak - and, indeed, for representation in mainstream cinema - it’s an important moment, the first time another human has refused to reductively define him by his condition.\n\npublished on 08/27/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"Blinded By The Light\"\n\nIn recent years there has been much talk among the cultural commentariat regarding the need for onscreen diversity. Of course everyone should be able to see themselves represented in movies, whether that be by a reflection of their race, gender or sexuality; but it’s important not to lose sight of the fact that artists don’t need to share your own specific cultural attributes in order to speak directly to you. As a white Irishman, I’ve seen the distinctive traits of my culture represented a lot more accurately in Japanese and Korean cinema than in the movies of my own country’s film industry. As a teen I found the music of U2 so alien that Bono and co. might as well have come from another galaxy rather than a few miles down the road from my house; rather I connected, like so many young working class kids in the British isles have over the decades, with the music of African-Americans; Miles Davis showed me what he was feeling with his heartfelt music, unlike Bono, who simply told me his troubles in his lyrics.\n\npublished on 07/25/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"The Lion King\"\n\n“Doesn’t this seem familiar?”, one big cat asks of another in director Jon Favreau’s remake of Disney’s much loved 1994 animated musical The Lion King. Yes, yes, it sure does seem familiar. Remake, rinse, reboot, repeat. Such is the circle of life for Disney as the studio continues their campaign to wring every last dollar out of their back catalogue with a series of ‘live action’ remakes that are now arriving at a pace few parents could afford to financially keep up with. We’re only halfway through 2019 and we’ve already had remakes of Dumbo, Aladdin and now The Lion King.\n\npublished on 07/25/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"Yesterday\"\n\nThere’s a famous gag in the climax of Back to the Future in which, having traveled back to 1955, Michael J. Fox’s Marty McFly finds himself fronting a band onstage at a high school dance. McFly picks up a guitar and performs a version of Chuck Berry’s ‘Johnny B Goode’, a song which wouldn’t be recorded until 1958. The school kids love this new sound, but McFly pushes his luck with some Van Halen-esque metal strumming. “I guess you’re not ready for that yet,” McFly observes, “but your kids are gonna love it!”\n\npublished on 06/24/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"The Dead Don’t Die\"\n\nThe late George A. Romero always claimed that critics would bash his movies, but whenever they visited his sets they always wanted to play zombies. A zombie movie seems like something that would be a lot of fun to take part in, which may explain why Jim Jarmusch’s The Dead Don’t Die boasts such a stacked, star-studded cast, like a ‘70s disaster movie but for hipster thespians. I hope everyone had fun making The Dead Don’t Die, because I sure did not have fun watching it.\n\npublished on 06/24/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\"\n\nHow many times can you watch Keanu Reeves inflict head trauma on faceless Asian goons before it gets repetitive? The third installment of the hitherto rewarding John Wick franchise answers this question in its opening 20 minutes but repeats the formula over and over regardless, leaving its audience in a mentally numbed state by the time it reaches its uninspired climax, in which Keanu Reeves inflicts more head trauma on an army of faceless Asian goons.\n\npublished on 05/27/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"Late Night\"\n\nBetween 1992 and 1998, over six seasons and 90 episodes, The Larry Sanders Show chronicled the backstage drama surrounding its titular late night talk show, delivering some of the best satire seen on screens big or small. What could be added to the talk show milieu that wasn’t covered in the late Garry Shandling’s signature show? Well, how about the struggles of a woman in the male dominated world of late night American comedy? Enter Tina Fey in 2006 with 30 Rock, which couldn’t sustain its quality across its subsequent seven seasons but was the funniest show on TV at its height.\n\npublished on 05/27/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"Dogman\"\n\nA decade after scoring an international breakout hit with Gomorrah (a movie that would spawn an entire mini industry of spinoff prestige TV dramas), director Matteo Garrone returns to the world of Italian crime, though in a more intimate fashion, for Dogman.\n\npublished on 04/26/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"Under The Silver Lake\"\n\nWriter/director David Robert Mitchell made his feature debut back in 2010 with the coming of age drama The Myth of the American Sleepover, but he really announced himself with his followup, 2014’s It Follows, arguably the best horror movie of the past decade. With that film, Mitchell displayed an innate understanding of what makes a horror movie tick, and most of us thought he would stay in the genre, with many putting his name forward as a potential director for the rebooted Halloween franchise. It’s a surprise then that Mitchell has confounded expectations with Under the Silver Lake, a rambling gonzo adventure that largely defies categorization. It may be his third feature, but it plays very much like a ‘difficult second album’, in this case a four-sided prog rock concept album complete with gate-fold sleeve.\n\npublished on 04/26/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"Her Smell\"\n\nI’ve never been much of a fan of rock music, so the whole indie rock scene of the ‘90s passed me by. While I can’t say I’ve warmed to the music that era produced, I do find myself looking back at that time with a more appreciative gaze. It was a particularly fertile time for female rockers, with the likes of PJ Harvey, Courtney Love, and Tanya Donnelly channelling a female perspective into a musical genre that had previously been dominated by men and refusing to sexualize themselves in the way today’s female stars seem compelled to.\n\npublished on 03/25/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"Ash Is Purest White\"\n\nThere’s a moment in Orson Welles’ The Other Side of the Wind in which a critic accuses John Huston’s veteran director Jake Hanaford of borrowing from other filmmakers. “It’s alright to borrow from one another, what we must never do is borrow from ourselves,” is his sage-like response. I’m not sure I agree with Hanaford, as filmmakers often mature by returning to themes and ideas they explored earlier in their career, developing them with newfound experience. After all, if a carpenter makes the same chair every day for a year, chances are the last chair he fashions will be be more finely crafted than the first.\n\npublished on 03/25/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"Holiday\"\n\nNow that more women are venturing into and being granted more opportunities in filmmaking than ever before, one of the joys for cinephiles is seeing fresh female takes on previously masculine dominated genres. Is there any more macho genre than the gangster drama? The milieu Swedish writer/director Isabella Eklöfhas has chosen it for her feature debut, Holiday. In gangster movies, women have generally either been relegated to background eye candy at worst or Lady Macbeth figures at best. Eklöf takes a gangster’s moll and places her front and centre in this uncompromising and provocative character study.\n\npublished on 02/23/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"Climax\"\n\nIn a self-referential nod to his controversial 2002 thriller Irreversible, Gaspar Noé opens his latest mindfuck, Climax, with the film’s final scene and closing credits. We then cut to an extended Haneke-esque sequence in which the individual members of a multi-cultural French dance troupe are seen discussing their enthusiasm for an upcoming Stateside dance competition on an old boxy TV screen (the movie is set in 1996, likely to avoid the plot hassles that cellphones notoriously cause horror filmmakers). Arranged beside the TV set is a pile of VHS tapes, the spines hinting at Noé’s influences (Argento, Buñuel, Fulci, Pasolini, Zulawski). They also act as a sly warning of the horrors to come - the primary coloured slaughter of dancers (Suspiria); floors splashed with bodily secretions (Salò); a miscarriage/interpretive dance performance (Possession); a blade dragged across human flesh (Un Chien Andalou).\n\npublished on 02/23/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"The Wild Pear Tree\"\n\nWriter/director Nuri Bilge Ceylan follows up his 2014 Palme d’Or winner Winter Sleep with another lengthy drama set in rural Turkey. And as with his previous film, The Wild Pear Tree gives us a protagonist who considers himself the intellectual and moral superior of the residents of a town he wishes to “drop an atom bomb on.”\n\npublished on 01/23/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"Glass\"\n\nWhen M. Night Shyamalan followed up his breakout 1999 hit The Sixth Sense with 2000’s Unbreakable, audiences were largely unsure what to make of this slow-burning movie about finding strength in survival. Arriving just before 9/11 and the rise of the superhero movie, Unbreakable was a film ahead of its time, predicting as it did with its villain - Samuel L. Jackson’s embittered, wheelchair bound Mister Glass - the threat that would rise in the early 21st century from entitled men obsessed with books (be they comics or religious texts) and striking out at a world they believe has left them behind.\n\npublished on 01/23/2019\n\nREVIEW: \"If Beale Street Could Talk\"\n\nOutside of cinephile circles, filmmaker Barry Jenkins is perhaps best known for his role in arguably the greatest debacle in the history of the Academy Awards. On February 26th, 2017, La La Land was mistakenly announced as the Best Picture winner, only for it then to be revealed that Jenkins’ Moonlight was the actual winner.\n\npublished on 12/22/2018\n\nREVIEW: \"Cold War\"\n\nBack in 2006, German cinema scored something of a breakout global hit with Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s The Lives of Others, which followed the travails of a group of disgruntled, pro-western artists in communist era East Germany. At the time I couldn’t help view the protagonists of Von Donnersmarck’s drama as the sort of people who would be just as discontented with their lot if they found themselves living in the capitalist west. The grass is always greener on the other side.\n\npublished on 12/22/2018\n\nREVIEW: \"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\"\n\nFor better or worse (worse in this writer’s eyes), the success of the Harry Potter franchise is largely responsible for the current Hollywood landscape of endless sequels, prequels and that awful phrase “universe building.” The Potter films showed Hollywood that it was a far safer financial model to hook audiences into returning for instalments of an ongoing series rather than taking a punt on the unknown quantity of original properties.\n\npublished on 11/27/2018\n\nREVIEW: \"Shoplifters\"\n\nEarlier this year, writer/director extraordinaire Hirokazu Kore-eda surprised us with The Third Murder, a legal thriller that made for a stark departure from the sentimental family dramas he’s become known for. With his Palme d’Or winning Shoplifters, Kore-eda is back on familiar ground, but this particular family drama shares much in common with The Third Murder. With his thriller, Kore-eda deconstructed the genre, forcing us to question how willingly we place our trust in a storyteller. Similarly, Shoplifters sees Kore-eda lull his audience into a false sense of security, making us develop a warmth and affection towards people who may not warrant such empathy.\n\npublished on 11/27/2018\n\nREVIEW: \"First Man\"\n\nThe image that most defines the 20th century is that of a man standing on the surface of the moon. The man is astronaut Neil Armstrong, but we can’t see his face as he’s wearing a helmet, the glass of which reflects our collective achievement back at us. When he took a small step, we all took a giant leap with him, and Armstrong instantly became more than a mere man, a symbol. With First Man, director Damien Chazelle takes us inside the famous helmet, stripping away the symbol to tell the story of Armstrong the man.\n\npublished on 10/24/2018\n\nREVIEW: \"Halloween\"\n\nIn 2013, John Carpenter’s Halloween received a 35th anniversary blu-ray release. The accompanying booklet credited the following line of dialogue to Jamie Lee Curtis’s babysitting heroine Laurie Strode: “Was it the boogeyman?” Of course, that’s a misquote. In the scene in question, Laurie admits to herself that “It WAS the boogeyman,” to which Donald Pleasence’s Doctor Loomis solemnly replies, “As a matter of fact, it was.”\n\npublished on 10/24/2018\n\nAdvertise with New Jersey Stage for $50-$100 per month, click here for info"
