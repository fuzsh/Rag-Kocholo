        "text": "Plot\n\nIn a faraway kingdom, a beautiful young girl, Margaret, lives with her mean stepmother and two spoiled stepsisters. The Prince of the kingdom throws a ball to find a wife. Margaret wants to attend, but her family thinks her too ugly and stupid, calling her a mere “Cinderella”. A Good Fairy, however, intervenes, and provides Margaret with the means to attend the Prince’s Ball. The Prince, of course, is enthralled upon meeting Margaret, for she is the only woman in the kingdom who possesses the spiritual bounty of inner beauty. Margaret runs away from the Prince before he can announce his intentions, however; she leaves behind only her slipper. The Prince searches the kingdom for the tiny foot which fits the slipper; some women even go so far as to mutilate their big feet to try and fool the Prince. The Prince eventually finds Margaret, and asks her to be his “Cinderella.” A big wedding follows, and the fairy tale couple live happily ever after.\n\nBackground\n\nFilming took place from July 11, 1955 to August 8, 1955 in the studio in Berlin-Wannsee.[2] The prince's castle is on Peacock Island. Other outdoor shots were taken at Charlottenburg Palace, Grunewald hunting lodge, in the Glienicke Volkspark and at the Immanuel Hospital. Waldemar Volkmer created the film sets, producer, director and author Fritz Genschow was also the production manager.[3]"
