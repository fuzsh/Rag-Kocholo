This silent movie tells the story of Hester Stirling (played by Joan Morgan) who is faced with misfortune, manipulation, love, and redemption in a tale mirroring that of Cinderella. Ropetackle spokesperson Nicky Thornton said: “Famed for its role in early British filmmaking, the studio on Shoreham Beach, owned by Progress Films, was the first and only film studio in West Sussex, with A Lowland Cinderella one of its most iconic releases. “Scenes were filmed around Shoreham and in the Metropole Hotel in Brighton, as well as at the studio itself.” Joan’s statue stands at the southern end of the Adur Ferry Footbridge. In 1995, the film was restored and now it returns to the big screen to mark its milestone anniversary. In another local connection, the accompanying musical score was composed by Shoreham virtuoso guitarist Richard Durrant. Supported by British Film Institute and Screen Archive South East, this screening will be a great celebration of Shoreham’s cultural and cinematic heritage, and a nod towards its continued creative richness.
