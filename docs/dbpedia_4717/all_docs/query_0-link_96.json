        "text": "https://www.history.ac.uk/publications/ihr-books-series/new-historical-perspectives/family-firm-monarchy-media-and-british-public-1932-53 The Family Firm presents the first major analysis of the public projection and reception of the British monarchy’s media image in the period 1932-1953. Beginning with King George V’s first Christmas broadcast in 1932, the royal household worked with the Church of England and the media to initiate a new phase in the House of Windsor’s public relations strategy. Together they elevated the royal family’s domesticity as a focal point for popular identification and this strengthened the emotional connections that members of the public forged with royalty. The Family Firm shows how the tightening of these bonds had a unifying effect on British national life in the unstable years during and either side of the Second World War and helped to restore public confidence in a Crown that was profoundly shaken by the 1936 Abdication Crisis.\n\nThis article examines three radio broadcasts from the royal tour of 1939, namely those covering the departure of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth from Niagara Falls, Ontario, on their way to visit the United States on June 7, 1939. The analysis contributes to the debate about the function of “media events ” sparked by Daniel Dayan and Elihu Katz’s eponymous 1992 book. While Dayan and Katz argue that historic national televised cere-monies enhance community loyalty and integration, their critics suggest that they place too little emphasis on issues of hierarchy and power, especially the power of the media them-selves. This study concludes that by their effective use of radio to exploit the symbolism of monarchical ceremony, natural spectacle, and international portals, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s announcers helped to legitimize and augment the authority of the fledgling Canadian public broadcaster."
