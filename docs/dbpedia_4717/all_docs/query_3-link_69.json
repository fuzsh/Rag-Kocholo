        "text": "GRANVILLE - They were the canine of choice for Tinsel Town’s biggest stars during Hollywood’s Golden Era.\n\nNow they’re possibly rarer than lowland gorillas and panda bears.\n\nBut Granville’s Lisa Inman-Lee and husband, Geiger, are determined to give the “Sealyham Terrier” breed new leash on life.\n\n“They’re as smart as Jack Russells, but better adjusted and great with kids,” Lisa said, while recently showing off the rare dogs on Broadway.\n\nApart from playful and amiable personalities, the special terriers also have a proud-Hollywood pedigree.\n\nHumphrey Bogart, Cary Grant, Bette Davis and Gary Cooper all owned Sealyhams, according to the Lees.\n\nBut it was director Alfred Hitchcock with whom the breed is still most associated, they said.\n\n“Hitch” owned three Sealyhams, and the director, famous for fleeting cameos within his own films, actually appears on camera with two of his dogs in his 1963 thriller, “The Birds.”\n\n(Hitchcock can be glimpsed being led by the pair out of a pet store as he passes actress Tippi Hedren.)\n\nIn 2012, two Sealyham puppies appeared in the bio-pic “Hitchcock,” starring Sir Anthony Hopkins and Dame Helen Mirren.\n\nThose same two rare terriers, \"Rapunzel\" and \"Cinderella\" — twins, as it happens — are now four years old and belong to the Lees.\n\nLisa’s Afterglow Kennels LLC, is located in Granville, not far from Pataskala, and an AKC recognized “Breeder of Merit” for Scottish and Sealyham terriers.\n\nBecause of the latter’s rare status, Lisa has taken special steps to bolster their heartiness and diversity by importing more dogs from “Ukraine, Belarus, Russian and the Czech Republic.”\n\n“They’re just always happy and friendly,” Lisa said. “They even smile at you and they’re great to take out in public because they’re so friendly.”\n\nHearkening back to their Hollywood history (in every sense) the two terriers will be making a special appearance at a screening of the Hitchcock classic, “Rear Window” later this month.\n\nThe 1954 film starring James Stewart, Grace Kelly and Raymond Burr will be screened at 7 p.m. Oct. 14 at the McConnell Arts Center, 777 Evening St. in Worthington.\n\nLisa and the “Hitchcock” Sealyham twins will be present to give audience members a “meet the breed” opportunity.\n\nA Hitchcock fan, Geiger said, “I would love it if this brings more attention to the breed.”\n\nTo learn more about Sealyhams, visit the Afterglow website at www.afterglowkennels.com/"
