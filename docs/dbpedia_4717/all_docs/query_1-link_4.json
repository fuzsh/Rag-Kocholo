Based on the fairy tale of the same name by Charles Perrault, it is the twelfth Disney animated feature film. The film was directed by Clyde Geronimi, Hamilton Luske, and Wilfred Jackson. Mack David, Jerry Livingston, and Al Hoffman wrote the songs, which include \"Cinderella\", \"A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes\", \"Oh, Sing Sweet Nightingale\", \"The Work Song\", \"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo\", and \"So This is Love\". It features the voices of Ilene Woods, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton, Rhoda Williams, James MacDonald, Luis van Rooten, Don Barclay, Mike Douglas, William Phipps, and Lucille Bliss.\n\nDuring the mid to late 1940s, Walt Disney Productions had suffered financially after losing connections to the European film markets due to the outbreak of World War II. During this time, the studio endured box office bombs such as Pinocchio (1940), Fantasia (1940), and Bambi (1942), all of which would later become more successful with several re-releases in theaters and on home video. Due to this, the studio was over $4 million in debt and was on the verge of bankruptcy. Walt Disney and his animators returned to feature film production in 1948 after producing a string of package films with the idea of adapting Charles Perrault's Cendrillon into an animated film.[6] After two years in production, Cinderella was released by RKO Radio Pictures on February 15, 1950. It became the greatest critical and commercial hit for the Disney studio since the first full-length animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and helped reverse the studio's fortunes.[6] It received three Academy Award nominations, including Best Music, Original Song for \"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo\".[6]\n\nDecades later, it was followed by two direct-to-video sequels, Cinderella II: Dreams Come True (2002) and Cinderella III: A Twist in Time (2007),[6] and a 2015 live-action adaptation directed by Kenneth Branagh.[7] The castle featured in the film has become an icon of The Walt Disney Company, serving as a basis for the production logo of Walt Disney Pictures, and with real life constructions of the castle being found at Magic Kingdom park at Walt Disney World as well as at Tokyo Disneyland.[6] In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[8][9]\n\nPlot[]\n\nWhen she is a young girl, Cinderella's widowed father marries Lady Tremaine, a widow with two daughters of her own. He dies shortly thereafter. Lady Tremaine, jealous of her stepdaughter's beauty, orders Cinderella to become a scullion in her own chateau and makes her live in the attic, overburdening her with duties. Cinderella's stepsisters Anastasia and Drizella also take advantage of her meekness, mocking her and adding to her workload. Despite this, Cinderella remains kind of heart, obediently doing her chores whilst taking care of the mice and birds that live in the chateau, making friends of them. She also protects them from being eaten by her stepmother's cat Lucifer, who makes her chores harder in retaliation.\n\nOne day, the King becomes impatient for his son to provide him with grandchildren. Despite the objections of the Grand Duke, the King invites all the eligible maidens in the kingdom to a royal ball, so that the Prince will choose one as his wife. Wanting to attend, Cinderella finds a dress of her late mother's to fix up. Her stepmother and stepsisters, afraid she will upstage them at the ball, deliberately keep her so busy that she has no time to spare. Jaq, Gus, and the other animals decide to fix up the dress for her, using beads and a sash discarded by the stepsisters. However, when Cinderella attempts to go to the ball with her family, her stepsisters recognize their belongings and angrily tear her dress into pieces, leaving her behind.\n\nCinderella flees to the garden in tears, collapsing against a bench. She is met by her Fairy Godmother, who transforms Jaq, Gus, and two other mice into four white horses, a pumpkin into a coach, and Cinderella's old horse Major and bloodhound Bruno into a coachman and footman, respectively. She also gives Cinderella a shimmering ball gown and glass slippers but warns her the magic will all end at midnight.\n\nCinderella arrives at the ball, and no one recognizes her, not even her own family. The Prince is smitten, so the King orders the Grand Duke to make sure the romance goes without a hitch. The Duke prevents anyone from interfering as Cinderella and the Prince wander out to the palace grounds and the two fall in love. However, when Cinderella hears the clock striking midnight, she flees the palace, losing a slipper on the staircase. The Grand Duke sends the palace guards after her, but when the magic is ended, Cinderella and the animals can hide from them in the forest. Cinderella realizes that the second glass slipper did not disappear with the magic, and is still on her foot.\n\nThe Prince swears he will marry the girl to whom the lost glass slipper belongs. Elated, the King sends the Grand Duke to try it on every maiden in the country. When word of this reaches Lady Tremaine's chateau, the two stepsisters immediately order Cinderella to get them ready. Lady Tremaine overhears Cinderella humming the waltz from the ball; realizing Cinderella is the 'mystery girl', she locks Cinderella in the attic while Anastasia and Drizella try on the slipper. Jaq and Gus steal the key and try to get it back to Cinderella, but are stopped by Lucifer. The birds summon Bruno, who chases Lucifer until he falls out a window, and the mice free Cinderella just as the Grand Duke is about to leave.\n\nTo prevent the fitting, Lady Tremaine trips the page carrying the slipper, and it shatters. Much to the Grand Duke's relief and Lady Tremaine's astonishment, Cinderella provides the second slipper, which of course fits perfectly. The Prince and Cinderella marry and set off in a white carriage for their honeymoon.\n\nCast[]\n\nRole Live-action reference Voice Singer Cinderella Helene Stanley[6] Ilene Woods[6] Lady Tremaine Eleanor Audley[6] Fairy Godmother Claire Du Brey Verna Felton Prince Charming Jeffrey Stone[6] William Phipps[6] Mike Douglas Anastasia Tremaine Helene Stanley Lucille Bliss Drizella Tremaine Rhoda Williams Jaq and Gus None Jimmy MacDonald[6] King/Grand Duke N/A Luis van Rooten Doorman Don Barclay Lucifer None June Foray Bruno Jimmy MacDonald, Earl Keen Narrator Betty Lou Gerson\n\nAnimators[]\n\nMarc Davis, Eric Larson, and Les Clark were the supervising animators of Cinderella\n\nFrank Thomas was the supervising animator of Lady Tremaine\n\nMilt Kahl was the supervising animator of Fairy Godmother\n\nOllie Johnston was the supervising animator of Drizella Tremaine and Anastasia Tremaine\n\nWard Kimball, Wolfgang Reitherman, and John Lounsbery were the supervising animators of Jaq and Gus\n\nWard Kimball, John Lounsbery, and Norm Ferguson were the supervising animators of Bruno and Lucifer\n\nMilt Kahl and Norman Ferguson were the supervising animators of The King\n\nFrank Thomas, Milt Kahl, and Norman Ferguson were the supervising animators of The Grand Duke\n\nProduction[]\n\nStory development[]\n\nIn 1922, Walt Disney produced a Laugh-O-Gram cartoon based on \"Cinderella\", and he had been interested in producing a second version in December 1933 as a Silly Symphony short. Burt Gillett was attached as the director while Frank Churchill was assigned as the composer. A story outline included \"white mice and birds\" as Cinderella's playmates. To expand the story, storyboard artists suggested visual gags, some of which ended up in the final film.[11] However, the story proved to be too complicated to be condensed into a short so it was suggested as a possible animated feature film as early as 1938 starting with a fourteen-page outline written by Al Perkins. Two years later, a second treatment was written by Dana Cofy and Bianca Majolie, in which Cinderella's stepmother was named Florimel de la Pochel; her stepsisters as Wanda and Javotte; her pet mouse Dusty and pet turtle Clarissa; the stepsisters' cat Bon Bob; the Prince's aide Spink, and the stepsisters' dancing instructor Monsieur Carnewal. This version stuck closely to the original fairy tale until Cinderella arrives home late from the second ball. Her stepfamily then imprisons Cinderella in a dungeon cellar. When Spink and his troops arrive at the la Pochel residence, Dusty takes the slipper and leads them to free Cinderella.\n\nBy September 1943, Disney had assigned Dick Huemer and Joe Grant to begin work on Cinderella as story supervisors and given a preliminary budget of $1 million. However, by 1945, their preliminary story work was halted.[16] During the writing stages of Song of the South, Dalton S. Reymond and Maurice Rapf quarreled, and Rapf was reassigned to work on Cinderella.[17] In his version, Cinderella was written to be a less passive character than Snow White, and more rebellious against her stepfamily. Rapf explained, \"My thinking was you can't have somebody who comes in and changes everything for you. You can't be delivered on a platter. You've got to earn it. So in my version, the Fairy Godmother said, 'It's okay till midnight but from then on it's up to you.' I made her earn it, and what she had to do to achieve it was to rebel against her stepmother and stepsisters, to stop being a slave in her own home. So I had a scene where they're ordering her around and she throws the stuff back at them. She revolts, so they lock her up in the attic. I don't think anyone took (my idea) very seriously.\"\n\nIn spring 1946, Disney held three-story meetings, and subsequently received treatment from Ted Sears, Homer Brightman, and Harry Reeves dated March 24, 1947. In the treatment, the Prince has introduced earlier in the story reminiscent of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and there was a hint of the cat-and-mouse conflict. By May 1947, the first rough phase of storyboarding was in the process, and an inventory report that same month suggested a different approach with the story \"largely through the animals in the barnyard and their observations of Cinderella's day-to-day activities.\"\n\nFollowing the theatrical release of Fun and Fancy Free, Walt Disney Productions' bank debt declined from $4.2 million to $3 million. Around this time, Disney acknowledged the need for sound economic policies but emphasized to the loaners that slashing production would be suicidal. To restore the studio to full financial health, he expressed his desire to return to producing full-length animated films. By then, three animated projects—Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, and Peter Pan—were in development. Disney felt the characters in Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan was too cold, while Cinderella contained elements similar to Snow White, and greenlit the project. Selecting his top-tier animation talent, Ben Sharpsteen was assigned as supervising producer while Hamilton Luske, Wilfred Jackson, and Clyde Geronimi became the sequence directors. Nevertheless, production on Alice resumed so that both animation crews would effectively compete against each other to see which film would finish first.\n\nBy early 1948, Cinderella had progressed further than Alice in Wonderland, and was fast-tracked to become the first full-length animated film since Bambi. During a story meeting on January 15, 1948, the cat-and-mouse sequences began to grow into an important element in the film so much that Disney placed veteran story artist Bill Peet in charge of the cat-and-mouse segments.\n\nBy the late 1940s, Disney's involvement during production had shrunken noticeably. As he was occupied with trains and the filming of Treasure Island, the directors were left to exercise their own judgment more on details. Although Disney no longer held daily story meetings, the three directors still communicated with him by mailing him memoranda, scripts, Photostats of storyboards, and acetates of soundtrack recordings while he was in England for two and a half months during the summer of 1949. When Disney did not respond, work resumed and then had to be undone when he did. In one instance when Disney returned to the studio on August 29, he reviewed Luske's animation sequences and ordered numerous minor changes, as well as a significant reworking of the film's climax. Production was finished by October 13, 1949.\n\nCasting[]\n\nMack David and Jerry Livingston had asked Ilene Woods to sing on several demo recordings of the songs. They had previously known her from her eponymous radio show \"The Ilene Woods Show\" which was broadcast on ABC. The show featured fifteen minutes of music, in which David and Livingston had their music presented.[27] Two days later, Woods received a telephone call from Disney, with whom she immediately scheduled an interview. Woods recalled in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, \"We met and talked for a while, and he said, 'How would you like to be Cinderella?',\" to which she agreed.[28]\n\nFor the role of Lucifer, a studio representative asked June Foray if she could provide the voice of a cat. \"Well, I could do anything,\" recalled Foray, \"So he hired me as Lucifer the cat in Cinderella\".[29]\n\nAnimation[]\n\nLive-action reference[]\n\nStarting in spring 1948, actors were filmed on large soundstages mouthing to a playback of the dialogue soundtrack. Disney had previously used live-action reference on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, and Fantasia, but as part of an effort to keep the production cost down, the footage was used to check the plot, timing, and movement of the characters before animating it.[31] The footage was then edited frame-by-frame onto large Photostat sheets to duplicate, in which the animators found too restrictive as they were not allowed to imagine anything that the live actors did not present since that kind of experimentation might necessitate changes and cost more money. Additionally, the animators were instructed to draw from a certain directorial perspective to avoid difficult shots and angles. Frank Thomas explained, \"Anytime you'd think of another way of staging the scene, they'd say: 'We can't get the camera up there'! Well, you could get the animation camera up there! So you had to go with what worked well in live-action.\"[31]\n\nWalt Disney hired actress Helene Stanley to perform the live-action reference for Cinderella, that she before artists began sketching, playing the role of Cinderella in a particular scene,[33] and artists to draw animated frames based on the movements of the actress.[34] She later did the same kind of work for the characters of Princess Aurora in Sleeping Beauty and Anita Radcliff in One Hundred and One Dalmatians.[34] Animators modeled Prince Charming on actor Jeffrey Stone, who also provided some additional voices for the film.[35] Mary Alice O'Connor served as the live-action reference for the Fairy Godmother.[36]\n\nCharacter animation[]\n\nBy 1950, the Animation Board—which had been established as early as 1940 to help with the management of the animation department—had settled down to nine supervising animators. Although they were still in their thirties, they were jokingly referred by Walt Disney as the \"Nine Old Men\" after President Franklin D. Roosevelt's denigration of the Supreme Court.[38] Including Norman Ferguson, the principal animators included Les Clark, Marc Davis, Ollie Johnston, Milt Kahl, Ward Kimball, Eric Larson, John Lounsbery, Frank Thomas, and Wolfgang Reitherman.\n\nLarson was the first to animate the title character whom he envisioned as a sixteen-year-old with braids and a pug nose. Marc Davis later animated Cinderella, which Larson observed as \"more the exotic dame\" with a long swanlike neck. Because the final character design was not set, assistant animators were responsible for minimizing the differences. When Disney was asked what was his favorite piece of animation, he answered, \"I guess it would have to be where Cinderella gets her ballroom gown\", which was animated by Davis.\n\nMilt Kahl was the directing animator of the Fairy Godmother, the King, and the Grand Duke.[41] Originally, Disney intended for the Fairy Godmother to be a tall, regal character as he viewed fairies as tall, motherly figures (as seen in the Blue Fairy in Pinocchio), but Milt Kahl disagreed with this characterization. Following the casting of Verna Felton, Kahl managed to convince Disney of his undignified concept of the Fairy Godmother.\n\nUnlike the human characters, the animal characters were animated without live-action reference. During production, none of Kimball's designs for Lucifer had pleased Disney. After visiting Kimball's steam train at his home, Disney saw his calico cat and remarked, \"Hey—there's your model for Lucifer\". Reitherman animated the sequence in which Jaq and Gus laboriously drag the key up the flight of stairs to Cinderella.\n\nMusic[]\n\nIn 1946, story artist and part-time lyricist Larry Morey joined studio music director Charles Walcott to compose the songs. Cinderella would sing three songs: \"Sing a Little, Dream a Little\" while overloaded with work, \"The Mouse Song\" as she dressed the mice, and \"The Dress My Mother Wore\" as she fantasizes about her mother's old wedding dress. To recycle an unused fantasy sequence from Snow White, the song, \"Dancing on a Cloud\" was used as Cinderella and the Prince waltz during the ball. After the ball, she would sing \"I Lost My Heart at the Ball\" and the Prince would sing \"The Face That I See in the Night.\" However, none of their songs were used.\n\nTwo years later, Disney turned to Tin Pan Alley songwriters Mack David, Al Hoffman, and Jerry Livingston to compose the songs. They were the first professional composers to be hired outside the production company.[6] The trio had previously written the song \"Chi-Baba, Chi-Baba\" that Walt heard on the radio and decided would work well with the Fairy Godmother sequence. They finished the songs in March 1949.[45]\n\nOliver Wallace composed the score, but only after the animation was ready for inking, which was incidentally similar to scoring a live-action film. This was a drastic change from the earlier Disney animated features in which the music and action were carefully synchronized in a process known as Mickey Mousing.\n\nIn total six songs were performed in the film: \"Cinderella\", \"A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes\", \"Oh, Sing Sweet Nightingale\", \"The Work Song\", \"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo\", and \"So This is Love\".\n\nThe film also marked the launching of the Walt Disney Music Company. The soundtrack was also a first in using multi-tracks for vocals – with the song \"Oh, Sing Sweet Nightingale\", Ilene Woods recorded a second and third vocal track to enable her to sing harmony with herself.[6]\n\n1950 children's album[]\n\nOn February 4, 1950, Billboard announced that RCA Records and Disney would release a children's album in conjunction with the theatrical release.[46] The RCA Victor album release sold about 750,000 copies during its first release, and hit number-one on the Billboard pop charts.[47]\n\nCinderellaother (Children's album) by\n\nIlene Woods With Full Cast\n\nReleased1950LabelRCA Victor\n\nNo.TitleLength1.\"A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes\"3:222.\"The Cinderella Work Song\"3:293.\"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo (The Magic Song) / So This Is Love\"3:334.\"A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes (Reprise)\"3:37\n\nSoundtrack[]\n\nCinderellaSoundtrack album by\n\nVarious artists\n\nReleasedFebruary 4, 1997LabelWalt Disney\n\nThe soundtrack for Cinderella was released by Walt Disney Records on CD on February 4, 1997, and included a bonus demo.[48] On October 4, 2005, Disney released a special edition of the soundtrack album of Cinderella, for the Platinum Edition DVD release, which includes several demo songs cut from the final film, a new song, and a cover version of \"A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes\".[49] The soundtrack was released again on October 2, 2012, and consisted of several lost chords and new recordings of them.[50] A Walmart exclusive limited edition \"Music Box Set\" consisting of the soundtrack without the lost chords or bonus demos, the Song and Story: Cinderella CD and a bonus DVD of Tangled Ever After was released on the same day.[51]\n\nAll tracks are written by Mack David, Jerry Livingston, Al Hoffman.\n\nNo.TitlePerformer(s)Length1.\"Cinderella (Main Title)\"The Jud Conlon Chorus; Marni Nixon2:522.\"A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes\"Ilene Woods4:343.\"A Visitor/Caught in a Trap/Lucifer/Feed the Chickens/Breakfast is Served/Time on Our Hands\"Oliver Wallace; Paul J.

In a personal letter to Walt Disney, director Michael Curtiz hailed the film as the \"masterpiece of all pictures you have done.\" Producer Hal Wallis declared, \"If this is not your best, it is very close to the top.\" Mae Tinee, reviewing for the Chicago Tribune, remarked: \"The film not only is handsome, with imaginative art and glowing colors to bedeck the old fairy tale, but it also is told gently, without the lurid villains which sometimes give little lots nightmares. It is enhanced by the sudden, piquant touches of humor and the music which appeal to old and young.\"[54] Time wrote that \"Cinderella is beguiling proof that Walt Disney knows his way around fairyland. Harking back to the style of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), a small army of Disney craftsmen have given the centuries-old Cinderella story a dewy radiance of comic verve that should make children feel like elves and adults feel like children.\"[55]\n\nHowever, the characterization of Cinderella received a mixed reception. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote, \"The beautiful Cinderella has a voluptuous face and form—not to mention an eager disposition—to compare with Al Capp's Daisy Mae.\" However, criticizing her role and personality, Crowther opined, \"As a consequence, the situation in which they are mutually involved have the constraint and immobility of panel-expressed episodes. When Mr. Disney tries to make them behave like human beings, they're banal.\"[56] Similarly, Variety claimed the film found \"more success in projecting the lower animals than in its central character, Cinderella, who is on the colorless, doll-faced side, as is the Prince Charming.\"[57]\n\nContemporary reviews have remained positive. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three out of four stars.[58] Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote the film \"shows Disney at the tail end of his best period, when his backgrounds were still luminous with depth and detail and his incidental characters still had range and bite.\"[59] The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported the film received an approval rating of 97% based on 35 reviews with an average score of 8.00/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The rich colors, sweet songs, adorable mice and endearing (if suffering) heroine make Cinderella a nostalgically lovely charmer\".[60]\n\nBox office[]\n\nThe film was Disney's greatest box office success since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs earning $8 million in gross rentals. By the end of its original run, it had earned nearly $4.28 million in North American distributor rentals (the distributor's share of the box office gross),[61] which made it the fifth highest-grossing film released in North America in 1950. It was the fifth most popular movie at the British box office in 1951.[62] The film is France's sixteenth biggest film of all time in terms of admissions with 13.2 million tickets sold.[63]\n\nThe success of Cinderella allowed Disney to carry on producing films throughout the 1950s by which the profits from the film's release, with the additional profits from record sales, music publishing, publications, and other merchandise gave Disney the cash flow to finance a slate of productions (animated and live-action), establish his own distribution company, enter television production, and begin building Disneyland during the decade, as well as developing the Florida Project, later known as Walt Disney World.[41]\n\nCinderella has had a lifetime domestic gross of $96.3 million,[64][65][66] and a lifetime international gross of $315 million (in 1995 dollars) across its original release and several reissues.[67] Adjusted for inflation, and incorporating subsequent releases, the film has had a lifetime gross of $532,461,600.[68]\n\nHome media[]\n\nCinderella was released on VHS and Laserdisc on October 4, 1988 as part of the Walt Disney Classics collection. The release had a promotion with a free lithograph reproduction for those who pre-ordered the video before its release date. Disney had initially shipped 4.3 million VHS copies to retailers, but due to strong consumer demand, more than seven million copies were shipped.[69] At the time of its initial home video release, it was the best-selling VHS title until it was overtaken by E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.[70] The VHS release was placed into moratorium on April 30, 1989,[71][72] with 7.2 million copies sold and having grossed $108 million in sales revenue.[73]\n\nOn October 4, 1995, the film was released on VHS and LaserDisc as part of the \"Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection\" line, exactly 7 years after the first VHS release. Both editions were accompanied by \"The Making of Cinderella\" featurette. A Deluxe LaserDisc included the featurette, an illustrated, hardcover book retelling the story with pencil tests and conceptual art from the film, and a reprint of the film's artwork. Disney shipped more than 15 million VHS copies. of which 8 million were sold in the first month.[74]\n\nOn October 4, 2005, Disney released the film on DVD with a digitally remastered transfer. This release was the sixth installment of the Walt Disney Platinum Editions series. According to Home Media Magazine, Disney sold 3.2 million copies in its first week, which earned over $64 million in sales.[75] The Platinum Edition was also released on VHS, but the only special feature was the \"A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes\" music video by the Disney Channel Circle of Stars. The Platinum Edition DVD, along with the sequels to the film, went into the Disney Vault on January 31, 2008. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, a \"Royal Edition\" of Cinderella was released on DVD on April 4, 2011, to commemorate the UK Royal Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. This release had a unique limited edition number on every slipcase and an exclusive art card.[76]\n\nOn October 2, 2012, a 3-disc Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy Combo Diamond Edition was released. The Diamond Edition release also included a 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD combo and a 6-disc \"Jewelry Box Set\" that included the first film alongside both its sequels. A 1-disc DVD edition was released on November 20, 2012.[77] The Diamond Edition release went back into the Disney Vault on January 31, 2017.\n\nCinderella was re-released on HD digital download on June 18, 2019, with a physical media re-release on Blu-ray on June 25, 2019, as part of the Walt Disney Signature Collection commemorating the film's 70th anniversary.[78]\n\nAwards[]\n\nIn 1951, the film received three Academy Award nominations for Best Sound (C. O. Slyfield) lost to All About Eve, Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture (Oliver Wallace and Paul J. Smith) lost to Annie Get Your Gun and Best Music, Original Song for \"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo\" (Mack David, Jerry Livingston, and Al Hoffman) lost to \"Mona Lisa\" (Ray Evans and Joe Livingston) Captain Carey, U.S.A..[6][79] At the 1st Berlin International Film Festival it won the Golden Bear (Music Film) award and the Big Bronze Plate award.[80]\n\nIn June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its \"10 Top 10\"— the best ten films in ten \"classic\" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community.
