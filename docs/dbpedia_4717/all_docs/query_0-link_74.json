        "text": "Books and articles\n\nRay Allister (Muriel Forth): Friese-Greene: Close-up of an inventor. London: Marsland, 1948. A flawed and rather romanticised account of the pioneer of cinematography. John Barnes (see below) writes: 'This unsatisfactory book grossly exaggerates the importance of Friese-Greene's contribution to the invention of cinematography' and says that the relationship with Esm√© Collings is 'briefly and inadequately described'.

This is the work that first identified the significance of the Hove pioneers and named them the 'Brighton school' (a term not reflected in the translations).\n\nD B Thomas: The First Colour Motion Pictures. London: Science Museum, 1969. An account, mainly of Kinemacolor, based on the Charles Urban collection at the Science Museum.\n\nN E B Wolters: Bungalow Town: Theatre and film colony.
