        "text": "English wild rose Joan Morgan who starred in at least 34 drama, crime, comedy movies from childhood, often under the direction of her father Sidney Morgan, making her film debut in Maurice Elvey's 'The Cup Final Mystery' starring Elisabeth Risdon in 1914, followed by 'The Great Spy Raid' starring Harry Lorraine at P&M Films. In 1919 Joan only 14 was so good in her acting ability she was cast opposite the legendary Ellen Terry in Fred Paul's 'Her Greatest Performance' playing her granddaughter. In 1920 Joan was offered a Hollywood contract by the Famous Players-Lasky Film Co who had opened a studio at Islington - soon to become Gainsborough, and hired Joan to play opposite Bryan Washburn in 'The Road to London' in 1921 she got Â£30 a week, Famous Players offered her $100 a week to start with, her father Sidney Morgan went up to meet them and they said, what do you think to this offer made to your daughter? he said 'not much' and that was that, Joan said, i just died inside. Through the 1920's she was given some stage roles in the West End her father cast her in his films such as her most favourite role 'Little Dorrit' (1920), and perhaps her most memorable role in 'A Lowland Cinderella' (1922) and her last major role 'A Window in Piccadilly' in 1928. Although Joan made a talkie in 1932's 'Her Reputation' she was no longer in demand as an actress, luckily, she was able to step into screenwriting through the 1930's using the name Joan Wentworth Wood, her most successful was 'The Flag Lieutenant'."
