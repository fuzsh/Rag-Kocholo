        "text": ".\n\n.\n\nThe actor Ralph Forbes was born as Ralph Taylor in London.\n\nHe did not follow the wish of his parents to take a profession in law or for the navy but dedicated to the acting like his mother, the well-known actress Mary Forbes.\n\nHe made first acting experiences at different theaters in England before he went to the USA in 1917 where he was able to take part in his first movie. But for the time being he did not manage the breakthrough in this medium.\n\nHe returned to England in 1921 and concentrated to his film career, among others with movies like \"The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's\" (21), \"A Lowland Cinderella\" (22) and \"Charles tant\" (26).\n\nFinally he went back to the USA where he became a demanded actor on the second try. With movies like \"Beau Geste\" (26), \"Mr. Wu\" (27), \"The Latest from Paris\" (28), \"The Masks of the Devil\" (28) and \"Restless Youth\" (28) he consolidated his position as a movie actor.\n\nThe 30s created new demands to the actors when the sound became the standard in movies. But Ralph Forbes did not evince any problems with this restructuring and he was able to continue his career sucessfully.\n\nTo his well-known movies of those years belong \"Lilies of the Field\" (30), \"Beau Ideal\" (31), \"The Avenger\" (33), \"The Mystery of Mr. X\" (34), \"Shock\" (34), \"Outcast Lady\" (34), \"Age of Indiscretion\" (35), \"The Three Musketeers\" (35), \"Mary of Scotland\" (36), \"Romeo and Juliet\" (36), \"The Last of Mrs. Cheyney\" (37), \"Stage Door\" (37), \"Kidnapped\" (38), \"If I Were King\" (38), \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" (29) and \"The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex\" (39).\n\nAfterwards his film career drew to an end, appearances in front of the camera were only sporadically.\n\nTo his last movies belong \"Curtain Call (40), \"Frenchman's Creek\" (44) and an episode of the serial \"Masterpiece Playhouse: The Rivals\" (50).\n\nBesided it he acted more often again on stage, among others in the play \"You Never Can Tell\" (48).\n\nRalph Forbes was married three times with the actresses Ruth Chatterton, Heather Angel and Dora Sayers.\n\nHis sister Brenda Forbes became also an actress.\n\nThere are different data to the year of birth of Ralph Forbes. Besides 1896 (his mother was only 16 years old at this time) they mention the year 1904 as well."
