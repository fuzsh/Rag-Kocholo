        "text": "There are many fairy films collected in these pages, some horror, some comedy, most for children, the majority mediocre and a significant minority dreadful. However, if you a day in bed with flu which should you watch. In no particular order we would suggest Totoro (1988) a Japanese film for children from the extraordinary Ghibli studios. Ghibli films have been characterised in the last twenty years by difficult plots and fabulous animation. In Totoro the animation is toned down and the plot (if you can call it that) is as simple as possible: two sisters find themselves in a country district and make friends with a series of supernatural beings, including Totoro, a local ‘troll’.\n\nThe Smoke Fairy (1909): cinema-lovers pretend to like silent films, but how many could truly bear to sit through forty minutes of a melodrama from, say, 1913. The Smoke Fairiy works because it is so very short; barely five minutes long; because it is entertaining; and because plays with perspective. Beautiful for children or adults alike.\n\nThe Secret of Kells (2009) is without question the best cartoon to come out of Ireland and one of the great children’s films of the new century. Set in Dark Age Ireland during the Viking invasions, Secret describes the young monk Aidan as he helps his friend Brendan write the Book of Kells, Ireland’s greatest treasure. The fairy is Aisling, a local forest sprite with beautiful white hair who helps Aidan as he works in the forest and who eventually, the films is ambiguous, dies to save Aidan. The music and animation are extraordinary.\n\nThe Secret of Roan Inish (1994) is another Irish film for kids this time set around selkie/seal legends. The film is sometimes a little bit too much like a Gaelic lesson from an earnest Irish nationalist, but it works and the finale is, against all the odds, moving. There is no mature content – unless talk about storms and tarring boats offends you – but for children brought up on a diet of cartoons this might be hard going. Probably best to wait to your children are at least nine or ten before seeing this.\n\nTinkerbell (2008) was the first of four prequel cartoons to Disney’s Peter Pan, following Tinkerbell in her adventures with friends in Pixy Hollow and clearly aimed at children. Reduced to basic plots the films sound unpromising and Disney’s record with fairies has not been great over the years. But the animation works surprisingly well and the script is often witty and sensitive to fairy lore. If you have a five year old in the house…\n\nThe Faery Faith (2000). One of several documentaries around the question of fairy belief and the most successful of these. The film begins and ends in Canada and includes a visit to Ireland (with Ed Lenihan!) and to England and Scotland. The director makes a case that perhaps does or does not work. But the fairy accounts he chooses, including an incredibly creepy description of fairies stealing a shadow, are vivid and memorable.\n\nEpic (2013)\n\nType: Animation, Family, Comedy\n\nRotten Tomatoes Rating: 64%\n\nDirectors: Chris Wedge\n\nStars: Colin Farrell, Amanda Seyfried\n\nDuration: 106 mins\n\nRated: G\n\nPlot Summary: The boggans and the ‘leaf folk’ (fairies, ‘Ronin’ even has an Irish accent) are fighting for the heart of the forest, which is watched over by an ineffective if lovable old scientist who is convinced that an advanced fairy society lives there and his estranged daughter who accidentally stumbles into the midst of the battle. Epic is interesting for the development of the theme that fairies are the ‘motor’ of nature, found in a slightly tamer version in the Tinkerbell films. Boggans (see boggarts?) are, instead, forces of entropy and not honestly that scary: your seven year old won’t die of fright. Highlights include the frog with a Harlem accent and the pseudo-science of fairies living at a higher velocity than us mere human beings.\n\nSecret of the Wings (2012)\n\nType: Animation; Family, Fantasy\n\nRotten Tomatoes Rating: 58%\n\nDirectors: Roberts Gannaway, Peggy Holmes\n\nStars: Timothy Dalton, Lucy Hale, Megan Hilty\n\nDuration: 75 minutes\n\nRated: G\n\nPlot summary: In the fourth of Tinker Bell’s recent films, the famous fairy’s curiosity about the forbidden Winter Woods leads her to discover she has a sister in that world.

Through teamwork by all the fairies and the star-crossed lovers ruling the two realms, the sisters secure a future in which they can see each other.\n\nThe Tooth Fairy 2 (2012)\n\nType: Comedy, Family\n\nRotten Tomatoes Ratings: 38%\n\nDirector: Alex Zamm\n\nStars: Larry the Cable Guy, David Mackey and Erin Beute\n\nDuration: 90 minutes\n\nRated: PG\n\nPlot Summary: Inferior to the first in the series.

A twist on the originals ending, the film ends with the gnomes resolving their disagreements and the couple getting married.\n\nThe Tooth Fairy (2010)\n\nType: Comedy, Family, Fantasy\n\nRotten Tomatoes Rating: 18%\n\nDirector: Michael Lembeck\n\nStars: Dwayne Johnson, Ashley Judd and Julie Andrews\n\nDuration: 101 minutes\n\nRated: PG\n\nPlot Summary: This comedy stars Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson as Derek Thompson, a hockey player and boyfriend to a single mother by day and a tooth fairy by night.
