        "text": "When a new ride is built, construction is carried out the preceding winter, occasionally starting as early as late summer/fall. This means that the components would have to be ordered and manufactured some time in the summer, fall, or early winter. Therefore construction drawings would have to be all but complete by maybe August, with the design stage occurring now.\n\nGiven that Cedar Fair just purchased Paramount Parks, it's virtually impossible for them to start a new mega coaster from scratch and have it ready for next season. Just like when Six Flags bought La Ronde, I expect the first Cedar Fair roller coaster to open at Wonderland in the 2008 operating season.\n\nIn a worst case scenario, Paramount knew it would be selling so they chose not to plan any new rides for their parks next year. That could mean next year at Wonderland will look an awful lot like this year. I have an inside source, so I'll see what I can find out. I won't be able to find out what's being built, but I'll know whether or not something is being built at all.\n\nThe attendance figures I saw were released by Cedar Fair, and they show Wonderland behind CP and KBF. Can anyone post a link to a complete, up to date list?\n\nA Magnum fan, eh? I found it's been getting a lot rougher over the years - but you're right - it's still a top 10 coaster. I do prefer Millennium Force, though.\n\nI can't imagine Wonderland gating the waterpark in the near term. They would have to build a new parking lot (okay, so there probably is space for that) and a new gate, as well as new changeroom/locker facilities by the new gate. That's a lot of work for a change that would be sure to send park attendance and season pass sales downwards.\n\nMakes sense that 2008 would be the year to see something new. I would be happy if 2007 was a solid clean-up year, with CF changing the branding over, possibly sprucing-up and enhancing the kids areas, and hopefully reviewing the vendor arrangements - I am not a fan of all the 'outside world' vendors doing business in the park. I miss the days when Wonderland food was more unique - not a food court with rides. CF seems to avoid outside food operators as far as I can see (at CP, Geauga and Knott's), which makes sense, as the margins are good on food sales.\n\nHere are the 2005 numbers for the top 25 parks in North America, courtesy Amusement Business:\n\n1. Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Orlando, 16.1 million, +6.5 percent\n\n2. Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif. 14.5 million, +8.5 percent\n\n3. Epcot at Walt Disney World in Orlando, 9.9 million, +5.5 percent\n\n4. Disney-MGM Studios at Walt Disney World in Orlando, 8.6 million, +5 percent\n\n5.

Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., 2.3 million, +7.3 percent\n\nAmazing to think that Wonderland pulls those numbers in less than six months of the year - a shorter season than almost all the parks on the list!\n\nForbes ranks Wonderland among the world's most popular amusement parks...\n\nLink\n\nHere's the list:\n\n#1\n\nMagic Kingdom Park at Walt Disney World\n\nLake Buena Vista, Fla.\n\n2005 attendance: 16.2 million\n\nAdmission: starts at $24 per day\n\nThe Magic Kingdom is the heart of Walt Disney World, where costumed Disney characters roam the streets and Space Mountain rules the rides. Cinderella's Castle, based on the turreted German castle Neuschwanstein, is a guaranteed favorite with little ones.\n\n#2\n\nTokyo Disneyland\n\nTokyo\n\n2005 attendance: 13 million\n\nAdmission: starts at $33 per day\n\nTokyo Disneyland is part of a massive Disney complex that also includes Tokyo DisneySea and a number of branded hotels. The first Disney park to open outside the United States, Tokyo Disneyland is broken up into seven themed lands. Rides include Big Thunder Mountain in Westernland, a four-minute train ride through a \"haunted\" mine.\n\n#3\n\nDisneyland Paris\n\nParis\n\n2005 attendance: 10.2 million\n\nAdmission: starts at $45 per day\n\nDaily parades and shows, including the Wonderful World of Disney Parade, the Legend of the Lion King, and the Tarzan Encounter, are the heart of Disneyland Paris. Like the parks in the U.S. and Tokyo, Disneyland Paris is divided into a series of smaller parks, including Frontierland, Adventureland, Fantasyland, Discoveryland and Main Street, USA.\n\n#4\n\nEverland\n\nKyonggi-Do, South Korea\n\n2005 attendance: 7.5 million\n\nAdmission: starts at $25 per day\n\nEverland in South Korea holds a number of annual festivals, including Snow Festival, Euro Festival, Summer Splash, Happy Halloween and Christmas Holiday Fantasy. The park celebrates its 30th anniversary this year, and special events include nighttime parades and animal-themed safari tours. For the older crowd, the Ho-Am Art Museum, featuring a traditional Korean garden, is next door.\n\n#5\n\nBlackpool Pleasure Beach\n\nBlackpool, England\n\n2005 attendance: 6 million\n\nAdmission: starts at $28 per day\n\nOpen annually from March through November, Blackpool Pleasure Beach caters to an older set looking to let loose and feel like kids again. Rides for thrill-seekers include the Pepsi Max Big One and Valhalla, but there's a wide array of family rides as well, including the first commercial monorail in the world.\n\n#6\n\nTivoli Gardens\n\nCopenhagen, Denmark\n\n2005 attendance: 4.1 million\n\nAdmission: starts at $7 per day\n\nOpened in 1843, Tivoli Gardens is now as much a concert venue as it is an amusement park. The Copenhagen Jazz Festival takes place on the open-air stage, and there is a different rock concert every Friday night--the Sugababes perform on June 9. But plenty of people still come for rides like The Demon, a 60-foot roller coaster with a series of stomach-turning loops.\n\n#7\n\nOcean Park\n\nHong Kong\n\n2005 attendance: just over 4 million\n\nAdmission: starts at $9 per day\n\nOcean Park is one of the world's biggest marine parks. There are more than 40 attractions divided up between the Lowland Gardens, the Kids' World, the Marine Land and several other areas. A highlight is the cable car ride, which provides access from the lowland to the headland and offers views over the surrounding city and the South China Sea.\n\n#8\n\nEuropa-Park\n\nRust, Germany\n\n2005 attendance: just under 4 million\n\nAdmission: starts at $33 per day\n\nEuropa Park in Germany is based on the idea of a unified European continent. Mini-parks are named after 12 European countries, from Austria to Switzerland. There is an Adventure Land, where guests can cruise the River Elz, and a Children's World with a Viking-themed village.\n\n#9\n\nParamount Canada's Wonderland\n\nMaple, Ontario\n\n2005 attendance: 3.7 million\n\nAdmission: starts at $37 per day\n\nThis enormous theme park in Ontario has more than 200 attractions and 60 rides, plus a 20-acre water park, Splash Works. The scariest rides include Drop Zone, which takes riders 230 feet high and then drops them at a rate of 16 feet per second, and Vortex, the first suspended roller coaster in Canada, which runs over waterworks to increase the adrenaline rush.\n\n#10\n\nPort Aventura\n\nSalou, Spain\n\n2005 attendance: 3.4 million\n\nAdmission: starts at $39 per day\n\nPort Aventura and Caribe Aquatic Park are part of a big resort complex on Costa Dorado in Spain. The resort has a wide array of roller coasters, from the Drago Khan, an intense eight-loop roller coaster, to the Stampida, two tracks wide and made of wood. The resort itself is made up of distinct regions, or \"countries\"; themed shows like \"Can Can in the Saloon\" are popular."
