        "text": "A page devoted to news items, snippets of (mainly) silent film information, unfounded rumours and the occasional moan!\n\n2 January 2024\n\nSilent Film Live Events Preview – January The month opens at BFI Southbank with the first of three screenings of Murnau’s Sunrise; A Song of Two Humans (1927)albeit with just a recorded score. Thankfully there is live accompaniment at London’s Prince Charles Cinema from musician Hugo Max, playing along to The Cabinet of Caligari (1920). The Prince Charles is also screening Harold Lloyd classic Safety Last (1923) with a recorded score. The Kennington Bioscope opens its 2024 season at The Cinema Museum with Phantom Of The Opera (1925), but perhaps not in a version you have seen before, being the rarely screened version restored by Photoplay Productions and released in 2003. The Cinema Museum also hosts the quarterly meeting of the Blinking Buzzards, the UK Buster Keaton Society, who will be screening The Cameraman (1928).\n\nNeil Brand has a busy January with five performances of his Presenting Laurel & Hardy show, in Chester, Litchfield, Newark, Basingstone and St Albans, which features two of the boys finest silent shorts, Big Business and Liberty. The month ends with a Lubitsch gem at BFI Southbank, Lady Windermere’s Fan (1925), and Mary Pickford rarity Heart o’ the Hills (1919) at the Kennington Bioscope, both with live musical accompaniment.\n\nFull details of all of these screenings are available here. Happy viewing folks and don’t forget to look out for our February preview, coming soon.\n\n30 November 2023\n\nSilent Film Live Events Preview – December The nights may be drawing in and thoughts turning to Christmas but there is still plenty going on in the silent film world to pique your interest. First up is the very first Wareham Silent Film Weekender, which hopefully will become a regular feature on the silent film festival programme. The Weekender runs from Friday 1st to Sunday 3rd December. The subjects for this first weekender are 1920s Hollywood film royalty, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. The programme kicks off on the Friday evening with Fairbanks at his swashbuckling best in The Mark of Zorro (1920) and concludes on the Sunday with him reprising this role in Don Q, Son of Zorro (1925). In between, Mary Pickford appears in several of her biggest hits including Stella Maris (1918), Little Annie Roonay (1925) and Sparrows (1926) as well as earlier or much less well known films such as Fanchon The Cricket (1915) and Johanna (1918) plus several of her Biograph shorts. Meanwhile, Doug ditches his Zorro mask to appear in the brilliant comedy western (sort of!) Wild And Woolly (1917), the recently rediscovered When The Clouds Roll By (1917) and several of his classic shorts including The Half Breed (1916) and The Good-Bad Man (1916).\n\nMeanwhile, in London, if you’ve seen Ridley Scott’s recent biopic of the dimunitive French chappie, then you really have to see how it should be done, with the great Able Gance’s Napoleon (BFI, 3 Dec), all five and a half hours worth, with the stupendous triptych ending and a newly composed score by the sadly recently departed Carl Davis.\n\nBeing screened the same day at Brentford’s Musical Museum is the 1924 version of Peter Pan, an altogether darker version than that of Walt Disney’s with organ accompaniment from Donald MacKenzie.\n\nScreening on 6 December, the final film of this year’s Kennington Bioscope season, is a real rarity, The Jew Of Mestri, a German adaption of The Merchant of Venice, along with another little known American film, White Gold, based on the 1925 Broadway play of the same name by J. Palmer Parsons, produced by Cecil B. DeMille and staring Jetta Goudal, Kenneth Thomson, George Bancroft and George Nichols.\n\nLater in the month there are two opportunities (17th and 28th at the BFI) to see another classic silent melodrama, The Woman Of Paris, Charles Chaplin’s debut at United Artists as a director/producer. Unlike so much of his previous output this was a serious drama, a tragic love story set in French high society and starring Chaplin’s long term collaborator Edna Purviance.\n\nFinally, if your thoughts turn to lighter faire, Neil Brand will be accompanying three silent comedy classics in a Silent Comedy Triple Treat at Bristol’s Watershed Cinema comprising Charlie Chaplin’s The Rink, Buster Keaton’s The High Sign and Harold Lloyd’s Never Weaken.\n\nFull details of all of these screenings are available here. Happy viewing folks and don’t forget to look out for our January preview, coming soon.\n\n6 November\n\nPickFair Coming To Wareham! What’s this you say, a new silent film festival? Do tell. Well, those great guys at South West Silents have got together with The Rex Cinema in Wareham to bring us the first Wareham Silent Film Weekender, which hopefully will become a regular feature on the silent film festival programme. The Weekender runs from Friday 1st to Sunday 3rd December.\n\nFor this first weekender they have chosen as their festival theme the veritable king and queen of 1920s Hollywood, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. The programme kicks off on the Friday evening with Fairbanks at his swashbuckling best in The Mark of Zorro (1920) and concludes on the Sunday with him reprising this role in Don Q, Son of Zorro (1925). In between, Mary Pickford appears in several of her biggest hits including Stella Maris (1918), Little Annie Roonay (1925) and Sparrows (1926) as well as earlier or much less well known films such as Fanchon The Cricket (1915) and Johanna (1918) plus several of her Biograph shorts. Meanwhile, Doug ditches his Zorro mask to appear in the brilliant comedy western (sort of!) Wild And Woolly (1917), the recently rediscovered When The Clouds Roll By (1917) and several of his classic shorts including The Half Breed (1916) and The Good-Bad Man (1916).\n\nThanks to The Mary Pickford Foundation, most of the Pickford films being screened over the weekend will be the UK premiers of recently restored versions, some with newly composed recorded scores. For the rest of the screenings, there will be live improvised musical accompaniment from top notch musicians Meg Morley and Dominic Irving.\n\nAnd there couldn’t be a better setting for this weekender than the Rex Cinema in Wareham. Built in 1889 as an Oddfellows Hall, it provided various entertainments such as travelling theatre shows, banquets and concerts. It was converted into a full blown cinema in 1920, The Empire, whose interiors brought a touch of Art Deco to Wareham. Renamed The Rex in 1963, the cinema is now run by the Purbeck Film Charitable Trust and boasts state of the art projection and sound equipment (while still retaining its 35mm projectors) as well as some very plush seating, providing a comfortable and cosy atmosphere, just right for a weekend’s silent film entertainment.\n\nAll in all, this looks like being a very enjoyable weekend and hopefully one that will be repeated in future years (hopefully with a little more notice!). All screenings can be booked separately although at just £70 a ‘weekender pass’ covering all 11 screenings represents exceptional value for money. You can’t afford to miss it.\n\nFull details are available from The Rex or from South West Silents. And full details of all of the screenings will shortly be in our live event listings page here.\n\n29 October\n\nSilent Film Live Events Preview – November Its another busy month, silent film wise, with 44 screenings across the country.\n\nThe big event of the month is, of course, the Kennington Bioscope’s Silent Laughter Weekend (4/5th November), two days just packed with rare comedy gems (as well as a few timeless classics). Fresh from a well received screening at Pordenone there is Poker Faces starring comedy stalwarts Edward Everett Horton and Laura La Plante. There is a rare outing for Max Linder comedy The Three Must-Get-Theres, his pastiche of The Three Musketeers, an even rarer outing for one of Mabel Normand’s few surviving features, The Floor Below, as well as the premier of a recently restored Monty Banks comedy, Play Safe.\n\nThere’s a fine selection of short comedies featuring some of the biggest silent stars from Europe, the UK premier of the complete The Way of All Pants starring Charley Chase amongst some rare Hal Roach shorts, a Laurel and Hardy compendium, some stars of the cinematic animal world and a tribute to the much missed film collector, historian and author Dave Wyatt.\n\nAll the films come with introductions by knowledgeable experts and live musical accompaniment from some of the best silent film accompanists around. And they’re all being screened in the awesome Cinema Museum down in Lambeth.\n\nIn contrast to this silent comedy weekend, much of the rest of November’s screenings focus of the scary, the supernatural and the downright creepy. The Hunchback of Notre Dame gets no less than seven outings over the month (2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 10th and 25th) , there are three screenings of both Nosferatu (1st, 3rd and 12th) and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (3rd, 6th and 11th) and a single appearance of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (11th).\n\nBut if you’re not up for outright horror there are plenty of other thrills with screenings of both Alfred Hitchcock’s Blackmail (5th) and The Lodger (19th and 23rd), Anthony Asquith’s sublime thriller Underground (15th) as well as two outings for the rarely screened The Flying Scotsman (10th and 16th), notable for star Pauline Johnson doing all her own stunts including hanging off the side of the moving train while wearing high heels!\n\nBut if you still have an appetite for more comedy, then it doesn’t come any funnier (or more thrilling) than Harold Lloyd in Safety Last (2nd). Then there is a comedy compendium down in Brixton (2nd) featuring Chaplin, Keaton and some French surrealism all accompanied by a 15 piece chamber orchestra while Mr Neil Brand continues touring with his new show looking in to the lives and films of eternal comedy favourites Laurel and Hardy (5th, 9th and 15th).\n\nUp in Edinburgh, there is a look at life within the 1920s fishing community with John Griersen’s documentary Drifters (4th), Manchester gets to see World War 1 epic The Big Parade (11th) while Bristol and Southampton get to see Douglas Fairbanks buckling his swash in The Mark of Zorro (13th and 14th). Then at the fantastic Wilton’s Music Hall in London, the Lucky Dog Picturehouse is screening Battleship Potemkin (16th) along with a compendium of Dickens on Silent Film (14th).\n\nLastly, if your taste is more for the outer limits of the avant-garde then Salome (19th) is the film for you, starring the incomparable Alla Nazimova, with a superb live accompaniment from Meg Morley.\n\nFull details of all of these screenings are available here. Happy viewing folks and don’t forget to look out for our December preview, coming soon.\n\n28 September\n\nSilent Film Live Events Preview – October Well, October certainly is looking like a bumper month silent film wise, with no less than 47 screenings over the next 31 days.\n\nAnd pride of place this month must go to the Northern Silents Film Festival with 20 events scheduled all across the north of England. Particular highlights include the hugely enjoyable (and best version of) Chicago and a rare Walter Forde comedy Would You Believe It in Morecambe (1st October); the legendary Louise Brooks in Diary Of A Lost Girl (13th Oct in Newcastle upon Tyne); Russian Sci-fi epic Aelita – Queen of Mars (21st Oct in Sheffield); Keaton classic The General (23rd Oct in York); expressionist classic The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (22nd Oct in Leigh and 25th in Leeds); the uber smooth Lubitsch comedy So This Is Paris (24th Oct in Leyburn) another Chicago screening (28th Oct in Hull) and the festival wraps up with a timely Halloween screening of the one and only Nosferatu (31st in Sheffield).\n\nIn addition, the festival includes numerous classic comedy shorts from Laurel and Hardy, Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin throughout the month. All of the films are being screened with live musical accompaniment and on 17th Oct there is an online opportunity to hear from the festival musicians themselves who will discuss just how they go about creating new music for silent film.\n\nBut if horror is more the genre for you then you will also be well served this month. The Cabinet Of Dr Caligari gets further multiple outings in October, at the Hippodrome in Bo’ness (7th Oct), the Prince Charles in London (16th and 28th) St Mary Redcliffe in Bristol (25th) and at Turnberries in Thornbury (29th). Nosferatu will also be putting in additional appearances at The Ultimate Picture Palace in Oxford (4th) and the Prince Charles in London (23rd). If witchcraft is more to your liking then docu-drama Haxan screens at the Regent Street Cinema in London (19th). Broadstairs’ delightful Palace Cinema is screening the creepy Hands Of Orlac (15th), The Phantom of the Opera pops up at Regent Street Cinema (29th) while Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde screens at the Musical Museum in Brentford the same evening but if your taste is more for ‘the heart blood of virgins’, then it must be The Magician for you, screening at BFI Southbank (29th).\n\nAnd talking of the BFI, they will be showing late Hitchcock silent Blackmail (25th Oct) but their highlight of the month must be a London Film Festival screening of the restored technicolor delight that is The Black Pirate starring everyone’s favourite swashbuckler, Douglas Fairbanks (15th Oct). Sadly, there is an unfortunate screening clash that same day with the Garden Cinema in London choosing to screen three Chaplin films as a tribute to legendary silent film composer Carl Davis.\n\nThe Kennington Bioscope’s autumn programme picks up pace in October with two rarely screened European gems, Manolescu starring Russian emigre heartthrob Ivan Mouskojine (4th) and the German Merchant of Venice adaption, The Jew Of Mestri (25th). Among other classics screening during the month, the impossibly expressionistic and inter-title free The Last Laugh screens at The Waterfront in Bristol (1st) as does the Weimar era classic Asphalt (22nd), Alla Nazimova pulls out all the theatrical stops as Salome at the Hippodrome up in Bo’ness and there are some Lotte Reiniger fairy tales at the Barbican in London (7th).\n\nAnd taking to the road in October is composer, writer, broadcaster and musician Mr Neil Brand with his latest show, Neil Brand Presents Laurel And Hardy, detailing the lives of this immortal comedy duo and including a couple of their best silent shorts.\n\nFinally, probably the most obscure film you could see during the month screens on the 1st Oct at the Cinema Lumier in London. Presented as part of the London Georgian Film Festival, Bela is a virtually unknown melodrama made in the Soviet republic of Georgia in 1927. Little is known about the film but with live musical accompaniment from Mr John Sweeney its got to be worth a watch (and a listen). Give it a go!\n\nFull details of all of these screenings are available here. Happy viewing folks and don’t forget to look out for our November preview, coming soon.\n\n14 September\n\nSeptember Preview – Last Minute Additions Having made a few recent additions to our listings for the second half of September, a couple of them are worth a special mention as they really are not to be missed. First up, on 23 September at the Hippodrome Cinema in Bo’ness, , there is a screening of Alfred Hitchcock’s last silent film, The Manxman, a tempestuous melodrama about two inseparable friends who both fall in love with the same girl. Set on the Isle of Man (although actually filmed very spectacularly on the Cornish coast), Hitchcock was reportedly unhappy with the final product. Nevertheless, the film was a big commercial success at the time and is now regarded as one of his best silents and it shines even brighter thanks to the complex, sensual performance of Anny Ondra as the girl. Live musical accompaniment for the film will also be of the highest quality, coming as it does from the multi-talented Stephen Horne. Find out more here\n\nThen, on September 28th at Cine Lumiere in London, there is a much rarer beast, with just the second ever UK screening of The Self Seeker (aka Shkurnik, aka A Profiteer). Released in 1929, this is a little known Soviet/Ukrainian avant-garde film, a comic tale of survival in the kaleidoscopic change of circumstances during the civil war in Ukraine and a biting satire on the Soviet propaganda. For that last reason the film was banned barely a week after its first release by the Moscow authorities and spent the next 60 years buried in the archives of the State Film Fund in Moscow until it was rediscovered in the 1990s and restored by the Dovzhenko National Film Studios. I had the pleasure of being amongst an audience of barely 30 people when it got its first British screening 2017 and thought it was an absolute gem ( for my with spoilers review see here ) and hugely deserving of a wider audience. Its beautifully shot, very funny and as bitingly relevent now as it was when first released (not to mention the funniest camel co-star ever put on film!) So it is a real treat to see that The Self Seeker is being shown for a second time in Britain, this time at the as part of the London Georgian Film Festival. This is a film crying out for a wider audience and, with John Sweeney providing live piano accompaniment, it really is a must see. Don’t miss this opportunity. Find out more here.\n\nDetails of these and all other silent films being screened in September are available here\n\n5 September 2023\n\nIts Goodbye to Yorkshire Silent Film Festival And Hello To Northern Silents Well, this seems to have slipped under my radar. The terrific Yorkshire Silent Film Festival appears to have morphed into Northern Silents. Founded in 2016 by musician and silent film enthusiast Jonny Best, The Yorkshire Silent Film Festival hit the ground running that same year with a one month festival across the county screening over thirty silent films, all with live musical accompaniment. Since then, the festival has gone from strength to strength, with its fifth iteration in 2022 as well as a flourishing programme of silent screenings throughout the year.\n\nBut as the Yorkshire Silent Film Festival has grown in scope it has also spread beyond its Yorkshire borders, with increasingly frequent screenings in adjacent counties Hence the change in name to reflect its broader Northern base. But its more than just a new name. The ethos of Northern Silents focuses on a reimagining – sometimes radically – of the relationship between film and live music.They can call upon the services of a growing and increasingly diverse range of musicians to provide musical accompaniment, including both established names as well as those new to silent film accompaniment. They are also developing musical workshops to attract and encourage performers new to silent film while allowing others to hone their accompaniment skills. Northern Silents also presents and commissions innovative new composed music, including the first ever brass band score for silent film, Echoes of the North: Four Chapters in Time (2022/3)by celebrated composer Neil Brand.\n\nBut Northern Silents’ current focus is firmly fixed on its October film festival, taking place across the North of England, from Newcastle Upon Tyne to Manchester and from Morecambe to Hull, highlights of which include the first (and best) version of Chicago, Louise Brooks in Diary Of A Lost Girl and Soviet sci-fi masterpiece Aelita: Queen Of Mars. Almost 20 films, to be screened at a variety of venues across the region, all with top notch live musical accompaniment. What isn’t there to like.\n\nSo, to be clear, the Yorkshire Silent Film Festival might have firmly established silent film in Northern England, but its equally clear that Northern Silents is going to take it to another level. All power to them.\n\nCheck out the Northern Silents website Here or alternatively see Silent Film Calendar‘s regular listings Here for details of all of their forthcoming screenings.\n\n1 September 2023\n\nSilent Film Live Events Preview – September Well, the summer (such that there has been!) may be over, but the good news for silent film fans is that the end of summer brings with it the usual up-tick in silent screenings, as venues kick off their autumn programmes and this is already reflected in our September listings with almost 20 events across the country.\n\nBest news for September is the start of a season at BFI Southbank featuring the work of famed Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu. This extensive season covers Ozu’s entire oeuvre, from the 1920s to the 1960s including many of his (sadly few) surviving silent films. His most well known (and perhaps best?) silent, I Was Born But… screens on 4th and 15th September. Other silents in the season include the delicately beautiful Story of Floating Weeds (9th and 23rd), the student comedy I Flunked But… together with surviving fragments of I Graduated But… (2nd and 13th) and his shomin-geki, or “common people drama,” Tokyo Chorus (2nd and 17th). All of these screenings shuold come with live musical accompaniment.\n\nAnd while we’re talking of Ozu at the BFI, on 10th September they are also screening King Vidor’s dark cinematic masterpiece The Crowd, a film which Ozu himself cited as an inspiration for his own Tokyo Chorus. Live musical accompaniment is by the brilliant Stephen Horne.\n\nAnother season kicking off in September is a monthly event presented by South West Silents and Pound Arts in Corsham, Wiltshire. Their first screening is the Cecil B DeMille epic (and somewhat luridly melodramatic) The Ten Commandments (5th September). Made in 1923, it was Paramount’s highest grossing film until the 1956 remake starring Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner and directed once again by DeMille himself. Live piano accompaniment for this and subsequent screenings comes from Meg Morley.\n\nAlso resuming after their summer break is the fabulous Kennington Bioscope, celebrating their 10th anniversary (doesn’t time fly when you’re enjoying yourself) and kicking off their autumn season with ‘It’ girl Clara Bow, starring in the film which gave her that very same title. It screens on September 13th, accompanied by a collection of Pathe 28mm format films projected by film historian Christopher Bird using an original restored 28mm projector and all with the usual top notch live musical accompaniment down at Lambeth’s glorious Cinema Museum.\n\nMeanwhile, up at Manchester’s Stoller Hall, Northern Silents (previously known as The Yorkshire Silent Film Festival) continue their great work with a screening of G W Pabst’s classic Pandora’s Box (16th) starring the wonderful Louise Brooks and with live musical accompaniment by Frame Ensemble. In a lighter vein, Northern Silents are also screening a Laurel & Hardy triple bill at Farsley in Yorkshire on the 10th.\n\nAnd while we’re looking North, there is a screening of director F W Murnau’s American film debut, the darkly melodramatic Sunrise: A Song Of Two Humans (9th) at St Cuthbert’s Church in Norham, Berwick with live musical accompaniment from the Jane Gardner Quartet.\n\nAmongst other classics due an outing during September, Chaplin’s late silent Modern Times screens at London’s Garden Cinema on the 17th, Buster Keaton’s perhaps less well known but equally funny comedy The Three Ages screens on the same day at the Palace Cinema in Broadstairs, with live piano accompaniment from Lillian Henley, while seminal horror classic Nosferatu screens on the 29th at London’s Prince Charles Cinema with live accompaniment from Hugo Max. There should also (TBC) be a screening of British thriller A Cottage on Dartmoor (14th) appropriately enough at Newton Abbot on the very edge of Dartmoor itself, with live musical accompaniment from local musicians, Wurlitza.\n\nThe month ends with a meeting on the 30th at London’s Cinema Museum of the Live Ghost Tent, the quarterly meeting of The Laurel and Hardy Society which will include a showing of their 1925 silent, Twins.\n\nFull details of all of these screenings are available Here. Happy viewing and don’t forget to look out for our October preview, coming soon.\n\n31 July 2023\n\nSilent Film Live Events Preview – August Although the summer months usually see a downturn in the number of silent film live events, there’s still lots of worthwhile events taking place in August.\n\nFirst up, early August sees the second half of The Lucky Dog Picture House’s silent comedians series. This opens with Harold Lloyd’s Safety Last (1 Aug) before focusing on some classic Buster Keaton with The Navigator (2 Aug) and Seven Chances (3 Aug). There is also a real treat with the rarely screened but equally funny Battling Butler (4 Aug), reputedly one of Keaton’s personal favourites, the financial success of which apparently convinced producer Joseph M. Schenck to fund Keaton’s greatest epic, The General. All of these screenings come with live musical accompaniment by The Lucky Dog Picture House and are being screened at the fantastic Wilton’s Music Hall in London’s East End.\n\nIf you need another helping of Buster Keaton then get on down to Chichester and their International Film Festival which includes another two showings of Safety Last (3 and 26 Aug) as well as Steamboat Bill Jr (17 Aug). The festival also includes Neil Brand’s all-new live show on the life and films of Laurel and Hardy (22 Aug) as well as Lon Chaney in Phantom of the Opera (25 Aug). But probably the silent film highlight of the festival is an all too rare screening of Rene Clair’s sublime comedy An Italian Straw Hat (15 Aug) with live piano accompaniment from John Sweeney.\n\nJust down the road from Chichester, in Arundel, there is an incredibly rare screening of British melodrama Tansy (17 Aug) one of the few surviving feature length films from director Cecil Hepworth, much of which was shot in and around the nearby village of Burpha on the Sussex Downs.\n\nIf your silent film forte tends more towards animal heroes, then get yourself up to Hebden Bridge where the Yorkshire Silent Film Festival is screening a selection of animal films featuring dogs and cats, penguins and seals, bear cubs and more (not to mention some human stars including Laurel & Hardy, Mabel Normand, and Buster Keaton), all aimed primarily at the younger audience but with adults equally welcome. Live piano accompaniment comes from Adam Fairhall and Jonny Best.\n\nBut if you taste turns more to animated animals then BFI Southbank has just the thing for you with an afternoon of early Disney silent shorts (6 Aug), including a popular Alice comedy featuring an animated cat named Julius and Disney’s first big animated star, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a precursor to Mickey Mouse. All with live piano accompaniment from Costas Fotopoulos.\n\nAnd if you still haven’t had your fill of Safety Last, there is one last chance to catch it (20 Aug) at the Edinburgh Film Festival with live piano accompaniment by Mike Nolan.\n\nFull details of all of these screenings are available Here. Happy viewing and don’t forget to look out for our September preview, coming soon.\n\n3 November 2022\n\nStuck for something to do on a miserable November weekend? The clocks have gone back, the nights are drawing in, the weather is getting colder and you can’t afford to turn on the heating? Then get yourself down to Lambeth’s fantastic Cinema Museum this weekend (5th – 6th November) where those wonderful folk from Kennington Bioscope will be putting on their 6th Silent Film Weekend.\n\nThe aspiration of the KenBio, has always been to shed some much needed light on the rare, rarely screened and less oft visited corners of the silent film world and that will certainly be the case with this weekend’s festival. Feature length rarities will include The Lure of Crooning Water(1920) a British made rom-com starring (then) married couple Guy Newall and Ivy Duke. From Germany comes Die Heimkehr des Odysseus (aka The Homecoming Of Odysseus, aka The Death Cheat) (1922) about which I can find out virtually nothing other than it starred former circus artist and muscle man Luciano Albertini but the watchword seems to be don’t worry about the plot just sit back and soak up the breathless action. Then there is Bright Eyes (1929) (aka Palace de Luxe), an Austro-British co-production starring Britain’s own ‘Queen of Happiness’ Miss Betty Balfour. The film is also known as Champagner but is not to be confused with Betty’s earlier, Hitchcock directed, Champagne (1928). There is also a British film adaption based loosely on the song Widdicombe Fair, called, not surprisingly, Widdicombe Fair (1928), of particular interest given that cinematography was by Claude Friese-Green.\n\nBut if you prefer your silent features to be a bit more main-stream, then not to worry. There is von Stroheim’s classic The Wedding March (1928) in which he also stars along with King Kong’s favourite squeeze, Fay Wray. From Germany comes Murnau’s surprisingly rarely screened Faust (1926), his last German film prior to his departure for Hollywood. Going a little further afield there is also a welcome screening for Yasujiro Ozu’s classic Japanese gangster pic, Dragnet Girl (1933).\n\nBut as always with a KenBio festival, there is much more than just feature length screenings. There is a collection of BFI 35mm Silent shorts presented recently at the Bologna Cinema Ritrovato festival, a selection of shorts from the recently released Cinema’s First Nasty Women collection as well as a selection of Mitchell & Kenyon’s Fiction Shorts from the Cinema Museum’s own collection. And do also watch out for the session on the Institute of Amateur Cinematographers (IAC) award-winning films sent on a ‘World Tour’. They are all interesting films but the 17 year old girl’s filmed travelogue of her solo trip to Egypt, To Egypt And Back With Imperial Airways (Ruth Stuart, UK, 1932), stands out while a stunning Japanese short Sister (Kichi Takeuchi, Jap, 1933) is almost more Ozu than Ozu and the Spanish entry Memmortigo (Delmir de Caralt, Sp, 1933) offers a slice of surrealism in the style of Buñuel and Dali,\n\nAnd last but by no means least, there is a real live premier with the first screening of a newly restored print of The Gold Diggers (1923). Long thought lost but rediscovered in 2021, the film offers an invaluable glimpse of the influences behind some of Busby Berkeley’s most successful musicals of the 1930s. Not to be missed.\n\nAnd being the KenBio, all of these screenings come with live musical accompaniment from some of the finest silent film musicians in the business (including John Sweeney, Colin Sell, Lillian Henley, Cyrus Garbysch and Costas Fotopoulos) and all will have sparkling and informative introductions from a band of knowledgeable experts.\n\nCheck out more details Here, . Then get down to the Kennington Bioscope website Here and book yourselves some tickets!! What are you waiting for!!!\n\n15 May 2022\n\nElectric Cinema, Harwich Re-Opens With A 1911 Night At The Movies One of Britain’s oldest surviving cinemas, the Electric Palace in Harwich, has recently re-opened, following an extensive refurbishment intended to restore the building to its original splendor. And what better way could there be to celebrate this re-opening than with an evening of silent films and live music, recreating a typical night at the movies, 1911-style, just as it was when the Electric Palace was first opened.\n\nOn Saturday 21 May, the Electric Palace will be staging A 1911 Night At The Movies, featuring a programme of early comedies, trick films, dramas, news footage of the Titanic, and even a film about the battle of Trafalgar that was shown at the Palace’s original opening night.\n\nThe programme is curated by award-winning film editor and director Christopher Bird (pictured, right) and who has had a lifelong interest in early cinema, and by David Cleveland, the founder of the East Anglian Film Archive. They will even be using a restored 1913 hand-cranked Gaumont projector, on the cinema’s original screen, exactly as it was 111 years ago. Providing live improvised musical accompaniment to the films will be internationally renowned silent film pianist John Sweeney (pictured, left).\n\nFurther details of the event together with booking details can be found here\n\nBuilt in 1911, just two years after the Cinematograph Act (1909), which sought to ensure that all screenings took place in buildings which were safe and suitable for public showings, the Electric Palace cinema in Harwich was constructed in just 18 weeks, at a cost of £1,500 by traveling showman Charles Thurston (picture, right; who also built the Empire Cinema in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, and the Palace Cinema in Norwich). Previously Thurston had screened films in a travelling fairground tent but the 1909 act made this illegal on fire safety grounds. . The Electric opened on Wednesday, 29 November 1911, with a film about the Battle of Trafalgar and the death of Nelson. Admittance was 2d for a wooden bench seat, rising to 6d for a seat in the middle of the auditorium or a shilling (worth about £6.20 in today’s money) for a plush perch at the back of the cinema.\n\nAlthough the cinema survived two world wars, by the 1950s it had fallen on hard times and the disastrous east coast floods of 1953 probably sealed its fate. The Electric Palace (by then known simply as ‘The Palace’) closed in 1956 and lay derelict and forgotten for the next 16 years. Then, in 1972, with demolition looming, it was ‘rediscovered’ during an architectural survey of the town by Gordon Miller of Kingston Polytechnic and his students. A protection order for the building was taken out and dialogue started with interested local people including the Harwich Society about restoring the building and returning the cinema to use. This was finally achieved in 1981 with a grand re-opening on 29 November, the 70th anniversary of the Electric Palace’s original opening. Now operated by the Harwich Electric Palace Trust, it has served as a community cinema ever since. But in 2019 the, by now Grade II* listed, venue was placed on the Heritage at Risk Register. Significant structural defects were found and extensive new refurbishment was required. Funded to the tune of £1.5million with grants from English Heritage and from The National Lottery Heritage Fund, this work has now been completed and the Electric Palace reopened on 8 April 2022, with state of the art projection and audio, plush new decour and ready to serve for another 111 years. .\n\n10 September\n\nHippFest Non-Fest Film Season Kicks Off Although their 2020 festival was a casualty of Covid while the 2021 event was limited to a truncated on-line version, the good people at the Hippodrome Silent Film Festival are obviously keen to get back to actual in-person, bums-on-seats, silent film events. To this end they have put together a short but interesting programme of screenings, all with live musical accompaniment, which kicks off this Saturday, 11 September\n\nThe programme opens with a Charlie Chaplin/Laurel & Hardy double bill. Chaplin stars in the Mutual classic Easy Street (1917), playing the somewhat reluctant police officer trying to impress mission worker Edna Purviance but finding life tough as he battles man-mountain bully Eric Campbell. Meanwhile, Laurel and Hardy appear in late silent Wrong Again (1929) where they face the not inconsequential task of getting a horse on to a piano!. Providing live piano accompaniment to both films is renowned composer, musician and television presenter Neil Brand.\n\nIn complete contrast, Saturday 25 September features two stunningly spectacular feature length documentaries. First up is Grass: A Nation’s Battle For Life (1925) Before they went on to make King Kong (1933) Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack told the jaw-dropping, true story of a tribe of 50, 000 nomads in Iran known as the Bakhtiari and their epic annual 48 day trek across inhospitable terrain from Turkey to Iran, complete with 500,000 cattle and goats. A spectacular ethnographic record, this film was intended for the lecture circuit but was snapped up by Paramount for theatrical distribution on the strength of its powerful dramatic punch. Providing live piano accompaniment for the film is Mike Nolan.\n\nIn the evening, the action switches to the wild Himalayas and the Epic of Everest (1924) A real life adventure captured on film, this is the official record of the fateful 1924 expedition to Everest and is the very earliest footage of the Himalayas. Filming in brutally harsh conditions with a hand-cranked camera, Captain John Noel captured images of breathtaking beauty and considerable historic significance. Live musical accompaniment for the film comes from Stephen Horne on piano, flute, percussion and probably several other instruments. (NB. The Epic of Everest with live musical accompaniment from Stephen Horne also screens at the Dundee Contemporary Arts centre on Sunday 26 September)\n\nSaturday 16 October brings an altogether lighter tone to the season, with Chicago (1927) . Forget Bob Fosse’s 1990s remake, this is the real McCoy! Phyllis Haver is hugely entertaining as the brazen Roxie Hart “Chicago’s most beautiful murderess”, particularly in her rivalry with fellow-murderess Velma (played by Cecil B DeMille’s then mistress, Julia Faye), A cracking, satire on fame and the media, this fun-filled tale of adultery, murder and sin (so sinful that DeMille – known for his Biblical epics – was at pains to keep his name off the credits) is as fresh and relevant as ever. With live piano accompaniment from John Sweeney.\n\nThe short season wraps up on Sunday 31 October with Haxan: Witchcraft Through the Ages (1922). The perfect choice for Halloween, this is a fictionalized documentary with dramatic reconstructions showing the evolution of witchcraft, from its pagan roots to its confusion with hysteria in modern (1922) Europe. Although it won acclaim in Denmark and Sweden when first released, Haxan was heavily censored or banned outright in many countries. But it is now considered to be Christensen’s finest work, a witches’ brew of the scary, the grotesque, and the darkly humorous. With live musical accompaniment from the incredibly inventive Jane Gardner (piano) and Hazel Morrison (percussion).\n\nAn eclectic mix of titles and genres, all with live musical accompaniment from some of the best silent film musicians in the business, what more could you want as a means of getting back into the habit of silent film going. And don’t forget, the Hippodrome Silent Film Festival proper will be back in business from Wednesday 16 to Sunday 20 March 2022\n\nFull details of all of these screenings are available on silentfilmcalendar.org here\n\n9 August\n\nIs there room for in-person and on-line screenings – Stummfilmtage Bonn shows the way. There have been all too few positives over the last 18 months of the Covid pandemic. But, from a silent film perspective, one surely has to be the growth of live on-line screenings. Whether it has been Ben and Steve’s Silent Comedy Watch Party from New York, Retroformat Films from Los Angeles, the Narodny Film Archive from the Czech Republic or our own Michelle and the rest of the Kennington Bioscope team here in London, they have certainly made all the difference during lock-down.\n\nBut with in-person silent film screenings restarting there is the prospect of such live on-line screenings coming to an end. This would be a shame. Of course, given the choice, we ’d all prefer a live, in-person, actual ‘bums-on-seats’ event to that of watching on our own via a video screen. There is just something extra that comes from watching a film as part of an audience, that shared laugh at Keaton in The General, a communal gasp of disbelief at Fairbank’s athleticism in Mark Of Zorro or even a quiet mutual tear at Louise Brooks’ lifeless face in Prix de Beauté. But there surely remains a place for on-line screenings, for two reasons in particular.\n\nFirstly, apart from at specialised events or festival screenings, live silent film screenings are largely dominated to a very restrictive programme range. A casual silent film goer might be forgiven for believing that silent film history consisted of Nosferatu, Metropolis, Phantom Of The Opera, Pandora’s Box and not much more given the frequency with which these same few films are screened, again and again. But on-line screenings provide the opportunity to bring a much broader range of films to a wider audience. Who, for example would get to see the wonderful Czech comedy The Lovers of an Old Criminal(1927) or the equally brilliant The Sins of Love ( 1929) if Narodny Film Archive hadn’t brought them to a wider audience. And how would we have seen the amazingly inventive A Kiss From Mary Pickford (1927) if the Hippodrome Silent Film Festival hadn’t shared it on-line. And what about Oscar Micheaux rarity Within Our Gates (1920) shared by the Cinema Arts Centre in Huntington NY or Lois Weber’s Hypocrites (1915) screened on-line by Gateway Film Festival in Peterborough. All screened with live musical accompaniment.\n\nA second benefit of continued on-line silent film screenings is audience reach. For those of us lucky to live in areas with thriving silent film communities, such as London or Bristol, or with regular film festival events such as the Hippodrome or Yorkshire festivals there are rich pickings. But much of the rest of the country remains a veritable desert for silent film screenings. On-line screenings offer the opportunity to cater to and perhaps even generate a wider audience for silent film nationwide.\n\nIt is therefore great news to see that not only is this year’s Bonn Silent Film Festival going ahead in person but the entire programme is being screened on-line. As well as screening a few well known titles ( for example, Waxworks (1924), Speedy (1928) and The Signal Tower (1924) ) the festival programme offers an ambitious collection of European rarities, many of which are unlikely to be familiar even to hard-core silent film buffs. These include Czech slapstick comedy The Kidnapping of Fux the Banker (1923), Swedish cross-dressing comedy The Girl In Tails (1926) and Italian diva film Flower of Evil (1915) as well as Carl Theodor Dreyer’s directorial debut The President (1919), an astonishingly mature and confidently realised social drama.\n\nAll of the films are being screened with live musical accompaniment. They will first be screened ‘in-person’ at the open air courtyard of the University of Bonn. Each day’s film (and musical accompaniment) will then be made available on the festival website the following day and will remain available to view for 48 hours…for free!!! The festival opens on 12th August (with first on-line screening on the 13th) and runs until 22nd August. What is there not to like about this? An event surely not to be missed and hopefully one that will encourage the continuation of on-line screenings!\n\nFull details of the festival screenings are available here\n\n21 February\n\nA Bumper Time For On-Line Audiences We mentioned a couple of days ago (see 17 February below) that the next few weeks were a good time for Live On-Line Silent Film Festivals. Well, the same is true for non-live On-Line resources too. Starting, somewhat surprisingly, with Netflix, they have recently begun offering viewers a choice of ten (yes ten!) top notch Swedish silents from the 1910s and 1920s. These films come from an era when Scandanavian film making was at the cutting edge of film artistry and innovation worldwide and Swedish cinema in particular was enjoying its first golden age. They were made by directors such as C T Dryer, Victor Sjostrom and Mauritz Stiller who would go on to have prestigious careers in both Europe and America. The films include; the breathtaking Arctic melodrama The Strongest (Den Starkaste, Dir. Axel Lindblom and Alf Sjoberg, Sw, 1929); the heartwarming (and heartbreaking) The Parson’s Widow (Prastankan, Dir. C T Dreyer, Sw, 1920) with a wonderful performance by 76 year old Hildur Carlberg (who sadly did not live to see the completed film) and a superb early example of Scandanavian social realism with Ingeborg Holm (Dir. Victor Sjostrom, Sw, 1913) which helped bring about a change in Swedish social legislation. Other films in the list include the melodramas A Man There Was (Terje Vigen, Dir Victor Sjostrom, Sw, 1917), Sir Arnes Traesure (Herr Arnes Pengar, Dir Mauritz Stiller, SW, 1919) and Pilgramage to Kevlaar (Vallfarten till Kevlaar, Dir. Ivan Hedqvist, Sw, 1921); an early feminist drama The Norrtull Gang (Norrtullsligan, Dir. Per Lindberg, Sw, 1923); a comedy adventure The Malar Pirates (Malarpirater, Dir. Gustaf Molander, Sw, 1923); the romantic comedy Erotikon (Dir. Mauritz Stiller, Sw, 1920); and the madcap comedy Artificial Svensson (Konstgjorda Svensson, Dir. Gustav Edgren, Sw, 1929) which also comes with a delightful sound introduction to explain why it remains a silent film (albeit with some musical interludes). Now, if only they would add the wonderful comedy A Sister of Six (Flickorna Gyurkovics, Dir. Ragnar Hyltén-Cavallius, Sw, 1926) starring Britain’s own “Queen of Happiness” Betty Balfour to this list, life would be almost complete. Sadly, the only drawback to these Netflix screenings is that they come without any musical accompaniment. Details at netflix.com/gb/\n\nFebruary also saw the launch of KLASSiKi, an On-Line streaming service for films from Russia, the Caucasus, Central Asia and beyond.Amongst an initial library of some 60 titles (with regular new additions) are a number of silents. Of particular note, which bodes well for the future, is that although the silents selected include the well known Battleship Potemkin (Dir. Sergei Eisenstein, USSR, 1926), the rest are far less well known, providing the welcome opportunity to catch up on some real rarities unavailable virtually anywhere else. Amongst these are the pre-revolution romantic melodrama A Life For A Life ( Dir. Yevgeni Bauer, Rus, 1916); the wonderfully funny Girl With A Hat Box (Dir. Boris Barnett, USSR, 1926) starring the luminous Anna Sten; a burlesque comedy with minimal plot, Love Berries (Dir. Alexander Dovzhenko, Ukr, 1926) from a director better known for his far more serious ‘Ukraine Trilogy’of realist dramas; and finally My Grandmother (Dir. Kote Mikaberizde, Geo, 1926) a surreal critique of bureaucracy in which the director uses dizzying constructivist sets, animation and even puppetry to invoke the fear and corruption underpinning the state. All of these films come with top notch musical accompaniment. This is a great start from KLASSiKi and offers the prospect of more silent delights to come. More details at klassiki.online.\n\nAnd if this wasn’t enough, don’t forget that several Silent Film Festival websites are offering streaming of some of the films screened at their festivals. The San Francisco Silent Film Festival’s current offerings include; The Last Edition (Dir. Emory Johnson, US, 1925), a crime melodrama set in a San Francisco newspaper office; Jane’s Declaration of Independence (Dir. Charles Giblyn, USA 1915) a charming story of domestic upheaval when a headstrong young woman defies her father for the man she loves; and What’s The World Coming To? (Dir. Richard Wallace, US, 1926), an amusing comedy set in the future in a world dominated by women, where men are the ‘weaker sex’ and Clyde Cook is the ‘blushing bride’. Details at silentfilm.org. Meanwhile, the Giornate del Cinema Muto in Pordenone currently offers; The House of Shadows (Moraenen Dir. Anders Wilhelm Sandberg, Dk, 1924) a story of family intrigue and murder; The Betrothed (I Promessi Sposi, Dir. Mario Bonnard, It, 1922) an Italian epic based on a famous historical novel by Alessandro Manzoni, set in 17th century Lombardy during the Spanish domination which tells of the contrasted marriage between the two young textile workers Renzo and Lucia and is one of the most ambitious and spectacular examples of Italian silent cinema; and New Babylon (Novyi Vavilon, Dir. Grigori Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg, USSR, 1929) an allegorical Russian epic based upon the story of the 1871 Paris Commune. Details at giornatedelcinemamuto.it. All the films from both SFSFF and Pordenone come with superb musical accompaniment from leading silent film musicians and are free to watch. So what’s stopping you? Get watching now!\n\n17 February\n\nA Fest of On-Line Festivals. We may still be stuck in the depths of lockdown but the next few weeks should see a little relief from the gloom with not one, not two, but three On-Line silent film festivals taking place. First up is the Kansas Silent Film Festival all the way from Topeka in, you guessed it, Kansas and screening on the 26th and 27th February. Both days open with a collection of comedy shorts including Charley Chase in Movie Night (1929), Dorothy Devore in Hold Your Breath (1924) and, right back to the earliest days of film comedy, Edwin S Porter’s Jack The Kisser (1907). The main feature on the opening night is Herbert Wilcox’s first directorial version of Nell Gwyn (1926) starring Dorothy Gish and Randle Ayrton which had the somewhat unusual distinction of being a British film that proved popular in the United States. It also has the added attraction of musical accompaniment by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra. The closing feature on the second night is Simba (1928) the only surviving feature length documentary by husband and wife team Martin and Osa Johnson who were probably America’s foremost filmmaker-explorers of the 1920s. The film follows their travels through Africa and not only does much of the footage remain stunning but it also provides an invaluable record of a now lost world. And as well as a nice collection of films being screenedh, the other big plus for the KSFF is….its free to watch!. Further details can be found here.\n\nNext up, and a little nearer to home (not that such things matter in the new ‘virtual’ world!) is Bristol’s long-running Slapstick Festival which runs 1 – 7 March. Now Slapstick is of course much more than just a silent film event but silents have traditionally made up a significant quota of the festival’s events and this year is no different. The festival opens with a W C Fields double bill of Running Wild (1927) in which gains the courage of a lion thanks to a vaudeville hypnotist, followed by Pool Sharks (1915), his first screen appearance. Then there’s Max Linder staring in The Three Must-Get-Theres (1922) his pastiche on The Three Musketeers. Clara Bow puts in a couple of appearances, first in the iconic It (1927) as well as in the (dare I say it) even funnier Kid Boots (1926) co-starring with Eddie Cantor. Keeping with the theme of female stars, there is also Josephine Baker in Siren of the Tropics (1927). And there’s even (and say it in hushed tones!) a ‘talkie. But it does star Harold Lloyd, so that’s OK. In fact, Movie Crazy (1932) is more than OK, its a riot. As well as the films, all of which come with top-notch musical accompaniment, there are talks, discussions, guest presenters, Q & A’s and lots more in an ambitiously packed programme. Find out more here.\n\nLastly, but by no means least, there’s the Hippodrome Festival of Silent Film (HippFest) from Bo’ness, running 17 – 21 March, with an equally ambitious programme. It opens with Oscar Micheaux’s Body and Soul (1925) with an electrifying performance by Paul Robeson. It may be a silent but you’d swear you could hear Robeson’s mighty voice booming out as the bogus minister. There is another slice of early silent documentary making with Grass: A Nation’s Battle For Life (1925) brought to you by the same team that went on to make King Kong (1933). Anthony Asquith’s Underground (1928) is being screened with with Neil Brand’s orchestral score. Then there is Valentino in The Eagle (1925), Mary Pickford in Sparrows (1926) and Marlene Dietrich in her first major role in The Woman That Men Yearn For (1929). But the undoubted highlight of the festival is an incredibly rare screening of Louise Brooks’ third and final European film, the sublime Prix de Beauté (1930). And better than that, it comes with musical accompaniment by the brilliant Stephen Horne. As well as the films, there are talks, introductions by knowledgeable and distinguished guests, a Hollywood walking tour and even a silent cook-along. Find out more here\n\nSo, all in all, a great deal to look forward to. Further details are available on our Live On-Line Events page here.\n\n27 October\n\nSoundtrack To Award Winning Buster Keaton One-Man Show Now Available. Back in 2017, composer and performer James Dangerfield had both a critical and popular success with his one-man show When You Fall Down-The Buster Keaton Story. The show followed Keaton’s personal and professional triumphs and trials as he films the most iconic movies of the silent era. As the world whirls around him, with his marriage failing, his best friend on trial, his career in danger and turning to the bottle, Buster must hit his mark as he films the most dangerous stunt of all. The show premiered in the US in front of Buster’s own family and it was endorsed by The International Buster Keaton Society. After touring the UK in 2018, the show played to sell-out audiences in Paris, London and Edinburgh.\n\nAs well as being a popular success, When You Fall Down-The Buster Keaton Story also attracted rave reviews;\n\n“In this exquisite new one-man show… Dangerfield’s dance, mime and physicality are riveting… His songs and singing technique are reminiscent of contemporary West End shows, but it is the palpable intensity of his commitment that makes this show very special”. ★★★★★ (ThreeWeeks)\n\n“The hugely talented James Dangerfield has succeeded so magnificently in bringing Buster to life before our very eyes… It’s a thrilling 50 minutes… and most movingly gives voice to Buster the man”. ★★★★ (LondonTheatre1)\n\n“An impeccable performance and a sublime show… Enchanting yet informative, full of slapstick, beautiful music, and a dash of pathos – a gargantuan effort by writer/performer James Dangerfield.” ★★★★ (Mind The Blog)\n\npicking up in the process a prestigious Three Weeks Editors’ Choice Award and a nomination for Musical Theatre Review’s Best Musical at The Edinburgh Fringe.\n\nJames had intended to tour once more with his one-man show in 2020 but of course Covid-19 and lock-down have put these plans on hold. However, if we can’t yet get another chance to see the show then listening to the soundtrack must be the next best thing. So you will be pleased to hear that the soundtrack to this award winning show, with music & lyrics by James Dangerfield and arrangements & instrumentals by Martyn Stringer, is now available online from https://fanlink.to/WYFD Get it and you won’t be disappointed.\n\n22 July\n\nExtra! Extra! Silent Film Festival To Go Ahead! Amid a seemingly never-ending string of pandemic driven cancellations and postponements for silent film screenings and festivals around the world it comes as something of a pleasant change to report one going ahead as planned. So its very welcome news to hear that the 36th Bonn International Silent Days Film Festival, Germany’s largest festival of silent film, will go ahead as planned on 6th to 16th August. Screenings at the festival are traditionally held in the open courtyard of the University of Bonn with live musical accompaniment from many of the world’s leading silent film accompanists. That remains the intention this year but covid-19 restrictions mean that attendance at these live events will be limited to 500 people.\n\nHowever, there is a major up side to this audience limit as the festival organisers have decided to stream each evening’s film on-line via the festival website, shortly after the live screening in Bonn concludes. Each film will be accompanied by a recording of the event’s live accompaniment and the films will remain on-line for 48 hours for people to watch on ‘catch-up’ should they choose. It is hoped also to stream at least part of each day’s supporting programme.\n\nThe festival programme has now been released and includes some great screenings;\n\nAugust 6 – East And West (Dir.Sidney M. Goldin, Au, 1923). One of the few surviving examples of Yiddish cinema, East And West is also a delightful comedy detailing the exploits of the daughter of a rich Jewish American businessman who travels to the wedding of her demure cousin who lives in a traditional Polish shtetl.\n\nAugust 7 – Looping the Loop (German: Die Todesschleife) (Dir.Arthur Robison, Ger, 1928) Circus and variety films were a popular genre in the silent film era. This late silent era thriller starring Robert Reinert (who died before it was completed) tells the story of a clown who, while disguising his identity, woos a young artist.\n\nAugust 8 – L’Argent (Dir Marcel L’Herbier, Fr, 1928). L’Herbier’s classic is a spectacular large-scale production that describes the world of financial markets and speculators, focusing on two rival bankers, both of whom have a love affair with the beautiful Baroness Sandorf, played of course by the wonderful Brigitte Helm\n\nAugust 9 – Mälarpirater (Dir. Gustaf Molander, Swe, 1928) Gustaf Molander, who had worked closely with Sjostrom and Stiller, began to direct films and quickly showed that he was something more than an apt pupil. His Malarpirater was a fresh and spontaneous piece about three boys who steal a boat and sail away for a summer adventure on Lake Mälaren. Based on Sigfrid Siwertz’s novel it is well acted by Einar Hansson and Inga Tidblad.\n\nAugust 10 – Mädchen am Kreuz (Girl On THe Cross) (Dir. Luise and Jakob Fleck, Ger, 1929) Young student Mary spends her vacation starting with boat trips, visits to her wealthy groom, and gardening. In fast-paced, rhythmic cuts, Louise and Jakob Fleck draw their audience into a light-hearted, urban comedy of love that transforms itself into a melodrama about sexual violence, shame and perpetrator-victim reversal with a single scene.\n\nAugust 11 – Peg o’ the Mounted (Dir. Alfred J Goulding, US, 1924) When an injured and exhausted Mountie collapses outside her cabin, it falls to Baby Peggy to take up the challenge and track down the illegal moonshiners + Wolf Lowery (Dir. William S Hart, US, 1917) The only surviving example of Hart’s directorial work, Wolf Lowery sees him as the owner of the Bar Z Ranch. He gets worked up when he finds a squatter on his land, but after he discovers that the settler is a woman, Margery Wilson, his attitude changes.\n\nAugust 12 – Duck Soup (Dir. Fred Guoil, US, 1927) Playing together in this film although not yet the famous duo, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are vagrants who wreak havoc in an abandoned villa + College (Dir. James W Horne/ Buster Keaton, US, 1927) which sees Buster Keaton having to master sporting activities and competitions in order to win his beloved. College is one of the best sports parodies in film history, in whose breathtaking finale Keaton did without doubles and camera tricks and brilliantly demonstrated his athletic skills.\n\nAugust 13 – The Student of Prague (Dir. Henrik Galeen, Ger, 1926) This darkly romantic tale, with echoes of the Faust legend and Poe’s William Wilson, is a superbly crafted remake of Stellan Rye’s supernatural chiller of 1913. An impoverished student (Conrad Veidt) sells his mirror reflection to a moneylender and is subsequently stalked by a Doppelgänger over whom he has no control. Veidt’s virtuosic portrayal of a split personality plumbs terrifying depths.\n\nAugust 14 – Phantom of the Moulin Rouge (aka Le fantôme du Moulin Rouge)(Dir Rene Clair, Fr, 1925) The Phantom of the Moulin Rouge continues with the same mischievously surreal themes of Clair’s first two short films with the story of a man, frustrated in his romantic ambitions, who becomes the victim for a scientific experiment in which a strange doctor separates the soul of the man from his body.\n\nAugust 15 – Storm Over Asia (Dir. Vsevolod Pudovkin, USSR, 1928) A classic of Soviet revolutionary film, Storm Over Asia opens with an ethnographic study of the everyday life of the Mongols before moving on to present a picture of their struggle against British colonial rule.\n\nAugust 16 – Le Moulin Maudit (Dir.Alfred Machin, Bel, 1910) In this exquisitely coloured short melodrama Dutch girl Johanna loves poor Joachim, but marries the wealthy miller instead. When the miller finds the two lovers together he takes an awful revenge + Maudite soit la Guerre (War Is Hell) (Dir,Alfred Machin,Bel, 1914) Made just before the outbreak of The Great War, this is a startling masterpiece of early cinema, The film shows how war destroys love and friendship through the story of two friends obliged to fight each other as pilots in the airforce of their respective (unnamed) countries.\n\nAll the films will have live musical accompaniment from noted silent fill accompanists including Stephen Horne, Elizabeth-Jane Baldry, Neil Brand and Günter A. Buchwald. Find out more about the festival here\n\n25 May\n\nLive On-Line Silent Film Event Update Lock-down may be preventing us from getting out to see silent film events ‘in the flesh’. But don’t forget that there are still opportunities to see films at live On-Line screenings. Forthcoming events include;\n\n– Wednesday 27 May The Kennington Bioscope present the third of their Live Stream Broadcasts on the KBTV channel on You Tube. In an impressively high tech format they present silent films introduced by Michelle Facey (@best2vilmabanky) and accompanied live by pianists Cyrus Gabrysh and John Sweeney and this week also Colin Sell. This evenings they present 3 films courtesy of The Eye Film Museum’s Jean Desmet Collection, including Lois Weber starring in & directing TWINS (1911) + one rare DW Griffith Biograph film FATE (1913).

Speedy was Lloyd’s final silent film and sees him reprise his ‘glasses character’ as a baseball-obsessed New Yorker who is determined to save the city’s last horse-drawn streetcar, motivated in no small part by its owner being the grandfather of his love interest. Filled with Lloyd’s trademark rapid-fire visual humour and elaborate set-ups, it’s a fine example of his innovative approach to comedy. Find out more at allmovie.com. The film will be available on You Tube here at 7pm (NB Not clear if this is purely a live event or if you can catch up later.)\n\n– Sunday 31 May – Now up to Episode 11 of the Silent Comedy Watch Party, live from New York and hosted by accompanist Ben Model and silent film historian Steve Massa.

(NB This event will be available to watch live but will also remain available on You Tube to watch later.)\n\n19 May\n\nA Quick Update On Live On-Line Silent Film Events In May Lockdown may be preventing us from getting out to see silent film events ‘in the flesh’. But don’t forget that there are still opportunities to see films at live On-Line screenings. Forthcoming events include;\n\n– Tonight (19 May) the Sands Films Cinema Club in Rotherhithe will be screening Russian director Boris Barnet’s Girl With A Hat Box (1927) starring the incredible Anna Sten. If you’ve not seen it this is a delightful romantic-comedy about the complications that ensue when a young country milliner (Sten) pretends to marry a drifter so he can stay in the room in the city apartment which she pretends to rent but which is in fact the lounge of her employers apartment which they in turn claim to rent out. I’m not quite sure the format of the event but think that there will be an introduction to the film although it will then come with recorded rather than live accompaniment. The event starts at 19:45 for 20:00 on Facebook and You Tube. Further details here\n\n– Wednesday 20 May. The Kennington Bioscope presents a pre-recorded talk by film historian David Trigg, illustrating how Charlie Chaplin drew upon his childhood haunts in South London when seeking ideas for locations and building his film sets in Hollywood.

The value of an on-line listing site for silent film screenings is somewhat diminished when no screenings are actually taking place, as is currently the case with the nationwide Corona Virus lock-down. So, in order both to justify our own continued existence and hopefully help ease the silent film withdrawal symptoms that are no doubt setting in we have been having a look at some on-line silent film resources which you might be interested in.\n\nThe obvious setting out point is the British Film Institute’s own BFI-player, here, which contains a wealth of material, much of it free to watch. But what of on-line resources further afield?\n\nWell, if your interested in Man With A Movie Camera’s Dziga Vertov then the Austrian Film Museum has a good collection of his earliest work. First up are 18 editions of the Kino-Nedelya (Film-Week) newsreels (Click here), produced between May 1918 and June 1919, which were Vertov’s first involvement in film making. Vertov started in the role of a secretary but by late 1918 he was effectively in charge of compiling the newsreels from footage shot by cameramen travelling the length of the country charting the progress of the Red Army in the civil war together with key events and individuals from the earliest days of the newly established Soviet state. Compared to Vertov’s later work, the newsreels exhibit something of a staid conservatism in their compilation and are somewhat idealistically focused but they do also serve to provide a valuable picture of life during the earliest days of Soviet Union.\n\nAfter going on to make three three feature length documentaries from this newsreel footage between 1919 and 1921 Vertov then embarked upon a more significant newsreel series, Kino-Pravda (Film-Truth). Comprising 23 films made between 1922 and 1925, the Austrian Film Museum has a complete set excluding number 12 which is sadly lost (Click here). Although the first few Kino-Pravdas are shot in a similar style to the earlier Kino-Nedelya series, Vertov was already trying to establish a theme for each newsreel in contrast to the somewhat random subject matter of the earlier series. But as the series progressed it also became evident that Vertov was experimenting with and developing his ‘Kino-Glaz’ (Film-Eye) theories of film editing and production. As such, the films present not just a valuable historical record of the era but also a useful guide to the evolution of Vertov’s style which reached its epitome in 1929 with Man With A Movie Camera, which can be viewed Here with superb accompaniment by the Alloy Orchestra.\n\nBoth the Kino-Nedelya and the Kino-Pravda newsreel series are accompanied by a superb collection of informative background notes from the Austrian Film Museum and are well worth a look.\n\nIf documentary news-reels aren’t your cup of tea, how about film travelogues? In which case have a look at what Italy’s National Museum of Cinema in Turin has to offer via Vimeo. There are lots of images of Italian locations,such as this stunning but sadly damaged footage of Venice. But there is so much more, with incredible footage from multiple European locations including Spain, here (but watch out for the gruesome cock fighting scenes!) and Switzerland, here. However, this site is about much more than just travelogues. There is some amazing footage of an Italian submarine squadron here, filmed in the Mediterranean in 1912 together with equally impressive footage here of the Italian navy, filmed in the same year. But the National Museum of Cinema also has what is undoubtedly my silent film discovery of the day, the truly incredible La Guerra e il Sogno di Momi (The War and the Dream of Momi) (watch here) made in 1917 by early pioneering Spanish film director, cinematographer and screenwriter Segundo de Chomón along with Giovanni Pastrone (of Cabiria fame). The film is an incredible mix of realistic live action and amazing animation as a child, told of her father’s exploits in the war, then dreams of her toys coming to life and continuing the battle. There is something of the Brothers Quay here as the toys come to life and the re-enacted battle scenes are hugely impressive, featuring both land and air warfare and which never hesitate in depicting the true savagery of modern warfare.\n\nIf you are after a slightly gentler silent film experience then you couldn’t do much better than director Maurice Tourneur’s (somewhat overwrought) melodrama Broken Butterfly (1919) available here via The Film Foundation in a beautifully restored version with a wonderfully sympathetic soundtrack. Unseen for nearly a century until its recent restoration, the film tells the story of composer Darrell Thorne (Lew Cody) who meets Marcene Elliot (Pauline Starke) in a Canadian forest and is so lovestruck that he titles his next symphony after her. But hopes that she will accompany him to New York are dashed when the young woman’s aunt (Mary Alden) sends them on diverging paths.. Created by Martin Scorsese in 1990, The Film Foundation aims to protect and preserve motion picture history. To date, the Foundation has aided the restoration of 40 films from 24 countries, celebrating and preserving the rich diversity of global cinema. Watch out for the possibility of other silent films becoming available from this source.\n\nNext up, those ever more ambitious South West Silents guys in Bristol are offering access to the Thomas H Ince produced (and co-written) film The Italian (viewed here, with some informative words from SWS’s James Harrison) and with excellent accompaniment by Ben Model. Almost forgotten now, Ince has been compared to Griffith and De Mille as a film pioneer and this story of an Italian immigrant to New York and he and his family’s harsh introduction to life amongst the city’s slum tenement population shows Ince at his best with one of the more realistic social issue films of the era.\n\nFor those after an even more obscure silent film product, how about Finland. finna.fi is an information retrieval service that provides free access to digital collections of about a hundred Finnish archives, libraries and museums and includes a huge collection of Finnish films (here) including many from the silent era. I chose to watch Meren Kasvojen Edessä (Before the Face of the Sea, here ) made in 1926, an eerie melodrama, verging on a ghost story, about a sailor who decides to stay on a barren island after he meets and is attracted to the local fisherman’s daughter. But over time he becomes aware of the tensions between father and daughter which leads to a dramatic denouement. The film is beautifully shot and has been superbly restored. Its somewhat slowly paced, in true Bergman/Scandi style, but this just adds to the tension and the dramatic conclusion. There is a beautifully realised and wonderfully appropriate accompaniment to the film which only at the final credits did I realise had been recorded live during a screening. This is a film well worth a look, especially as it starred Heidi Korhonen, a leading Finnish stage star of her day who puts in an impressively ethereal performance as the fisherman’s daughter. Korhonen made only six film appearances before her untimely death aged just 31, one of which was in The Village Shoemakers (Nummisuutarit, 1923) a beautifully understated comedy which I was lucky to catch up with last year. This film also features in the Finna.fi collection (here) but without sound or English inter-title translations (but if time is no object then Google Translate can help fill in the gaps). Sadly, only a limited number of the films have English translations (and many thanks to Fritzi Kramer from Moviessilently.com for coming up with the search term which identifies the translated films here) But even if you can’t always puzzle out what is going on, some of these films are just stunning to look at. I particularly liked Polyteekkarifilmi (1924) (here), about Finnish preparations for the Paris Olympics (I think!) but check out the amazing aeroplane, overhead shots of Helsinki (?) and propeller driven sledge around the 36 minute mark.\n\nSlightly closer to home but equally impressive is the Danish Film Institute’s new streaming site for silent feature films, Stumfilm.dk. This is another superb collection of films, intended to highlight the significance of the Danish silent film industry in the 1910s and 20s. Although the films lack musical accompaniment quite a few have English inter-title translations. Amongst their selection, it was nice to get another chance to see Asta Nielsen’s first film appearance in The Abyss (1910, here), which was shown recently at the Kennington Bioscope. In an interesting aside, the film has suffered some nitrate damage throughout, but Nielsen’s sexy stage dance is of much better quality, apparently through using a segment of the film which was edited out by the Swedish Censor’s Bureau on the film’s original release in that country. Hot stuff indeed! Also great fun (despite, or perhaps because of, some of the worst ‘ham’ acting) is A Trip To Mars (1918, here ) which has some impressive production values and huge cast. And already setting the trend for earth men in space, “We come in peace” but we have pistols tucked in our belts!! Nevertheless, the film had, for its time, some forward looking views on crime, punishment, international peace and even vegetarianism!! Well worth a look.\n\nBut if all you will settle for is silent film with live musical accompaniment then the place to be must be New York (via the internet of course) on Sunday evenings when film accompanist Ben Model and silent film historian Steve Massa host the next instalment of The Silent Comedy Watch Party. OK, it may not be high tech, with the movies projected on a wall and filmed with a webcam while Ben acompanies on piano and Steve provides remote film info via Facetime, but its great fun and the films being screened are often real rarities. The next episode is at 20:00 UK time on Sunday 5th April, right here.\n\nAnyway, that’s all for now. If there is interest in doing a further selection of on-line silent film resources let me know @silentfilmcal and we’ll do a Part 2.\n\n14 March\n\nCoronavirus Hits Silent Film Festivals Amidst the chaos and disruption being caused by the continued spread of the Coronavirus, Silent Film Festivals are sadly not proving immune. The latest casualty is Scotland’s Hippodrome Silent Film Festival (HippFest). This year celebrating its tenth anniversary HippFest 2020 promised a programme packed with both new discoveries as well as old favourites, all screened with top flight live accompaniment. However, the festival has now been postponed until late October with precise dates yet to be decided.\n\nUnfortunately HippFest is not the only silent film festival to fall victim to Coronavirus. The Toronto Silent Film Festival scheduled for 3-6 April has been postponed until 12-15 June. The San Francisco Silent Film Festival scheduled for 29 April – 3 May has been put back until 11-15 November while the Denver Silent Film Festival has been postponed until a date yet to be announced.\n\nThoughts are with all of those involved in arranging these festivals and the hard work they have put in to setting them up, only now having to go back to square one and start all over. Hope also that they don’t take too hard a financial hit given the usual parlous state of funding for silent film events. Keep an eye on our Festivals 2020 page for rescheduling details.\n\n12 March\n\nCrowd Funding – Will It Work For Silent Film Releases In The UK Fans of the British silent film comedian Lupino Lane are no doubt delighted at the success of an ongoing Kickstarter appeal to raise money to fund the release on disc of restored versions of a whole host of Lane’s comedies from the late 1920s. This project, launched by silent film collectors and historians Dave Glass and Dave Wyatt, has raised almost double its original target of £5,000 thanks to more than 250 subscribers. There is still time to contribute, if you are quick, as the project is open until 11:00 tomorrow (Friday 13th Mar), just Click here. This will be your one and only chance to acquire these films on disc. Because of the various different film archives involved the discs will only be available to contributors.\n\nCrowd funding the restoration and release of silent films has become increasingly popular in the United States, thanks to the efforts of people such as film accompanist Ben Model and his own Undercrank Productions label which has used crowd funding to release films by, amongst others, Alice Howell, Marion Davies and, most recently, Douglas MacLean. However, such crowd funded projects remain very much a rarity in the UK.\n\nBut why should this be? Well film licensing issues clearly seem to be less onerous in the ‘States than they are here, particularly if the film originates from the Library of Congress archive. But invariably if you ask about the possibility of crowd funding a release here, the response is likely to be “Oh, there are licensing issues” or “We couldn’t afford the accompanist/studio time” or “There wouldn’t be the interest” or even “Oh, its just too difficult”. But if 250 people are interested enough to raise nearly £9,000 to fund the release of the films of what is, in all honesty, a fairly obscure British silent film comedian, then clearly there is the interest and there is the money to achieve it.\n\nIt remains deeply frustrating that there are hundreds of silent films sitting, for example, in the BFI archives, a few screened occasionally but most largely forgotten. What could crowd funding achieve here? What about the H Manning-Haynes/Lydia Hayward adaptions of the stories of WW Jacobs (The Skippers Wooing, The Head of the Family, A Will and a Way, etc). I’ve yet to meet anyone who didn’t find these films a total delight on first viewing and long to see them again and to see more of the series. What a great box set they would make. Or what about the Stoll Company’s 1924 adaptions of P G Woodhouse stories (including The Clicking of Cuthbert, Rodney Fails To Qualify and Chester Forgets Himself) which were such a hit when screened at the 2017 British Silent Film Festival. Another potentially delightful box set.\n\nSo what is holding us back. As the Lupino Lane Kickstarter has shown, its not for any lack of interest or money (with the level of subscribers and money raised being on a par with that achieved by Ben Model in the US). OK, so licensing might be an issue, but is it really insurmountable? Or is it because nobody has addressed the issue? Would a ‘subscribers only’ basis with no further retail sales address the issue? So is it just down to the dedication of people like Dave Glass and Dave Wyatt with their willingness to launch a project and see it through.\n\nIn writing this I’ll freely admit to having little more than the simple desire to see more silent film rarities reach a wider audience, with little practical insight into the potential difficulties to be overcome. But for those who do understand more of the processes involved, do you believe that crowd funding offers a way forward in Britain and, if so, how do we best go about it?\n\n7 October\n\nA Rare Big Screen Outing For Napoleon How many of us have got a favourite silent film that we’d go almost to any length to see. You know, the one that gets an outing on the big screen all too infrequently, and then in some far distant venue. And how often do we think ‘Why don’t I just arrange my own screening?’. And that’s usually about as far as that idea ever gets! But not Paul Strickland. Having travelled far and wide to catch rare screenings of his favourite, he’s now arranged a screening of his own. But his favourite isn’t just your run-of-the-mill 90 minute silent feature. No, his favourite is Abel Gance’s 1927 classic Napoleon, all five and a half hours of it and with that breathtaking triptych finale.\n\nBut clearly relishing a challenge Paul, along with the Valley Film Society, have successfully arranged for a screening to take place at the Walwyn Hall in Lambourn, Berkshire on Sunday 24 November. The screening will be accompanied by the tremendous Carl Davis recorded score. Sadly there wasn’t room for a live orchestra but the DTS-HD 7.1 Surround Sound will ensure top notch audio. Additionally, three screen polyvision should do justice to the triptych finale. And all of this for the miserly sum of just £15, which also includes a complimentary supper during the film’s main interval.\n\nFurther details of the screening are on our November listings page here. You can find out more by emailing direct to napoleon.walwyn@mail.com or book tickets at www.seaty.co.uk/napoleon. So, congratulations to Paul on arranging this ambitious screening. Lets hope its a big success. And if anyone else out there wants to do something similar for their own favourite, let us know and we’ll be happy to promote it.\n\n17 September\n\nA Silent Film Autumn To Look Forward To – Feeling a little blue now that the British Silent Film Festival has ended? Don’t think that there is much silent-film-wise coming up in the next few months? Well, how wrong could you be! Both the Kennington Bioscope and South West Silents recently kicked off their Autumn programmes which means that there is a lot to look forward to in both London and Bristol. The Ken Bio’s next presentation is Ingeborg Holm(1913), an early social drama from Swedish director Victor Sjostrom. They then have an H G Wells adaption, Wheels of Chance (1922), a virtually unknown German silent Claire (1924), a bittersweet love story, King on Main Street (1925) with Adolphe Menjou and Bessie Love and their season ends with one of the most lavish British films of the silent era in both budget and scope, Moulin Rouge (1928) directed by the great E A Dupont. And then of course there is their much anticipated DeMille Day, a whole day of films directed by Cecil B himself, including the wonderful Gloria Swanson (plus lion) in Male and Female (1919).\n\nMeanwhile, down in Bristol, South West Silents goes from strength to strength with what must be their most ambitious season so far. They are presenting a series of Weimar classics on Sunday afternoons at the Watershed Cinema, including sensationalist silent drama Opium (1919), Abwege (1928) starring Teutonic ice maiden Brigitte Helm, a fine example of that unusual German genre the Alpine drama, Der Kampf ums Matterhorn (1928) and a landmark of realist filmmaking Menschen am Sonntag (1930). There are new restorations of Der Golem (192o) at the Curzon Clevedon and The Man Who Laughs (1928) at Bristol Cathederal and director Julien Duvivier’s long-forgotten masterpiece Au Bonheur des Dames (1930) also at the Watershed. Meanwhile, SWS’s free screenings at the Lansdown Public House continue with evenings devoted to the careers of IT girl Clara Bow and Czech star Anny Ondra. Coincidently, SWS’s Autumn season also concludes with a screening of Moulin Rouge (1928).\n\nAround he rest of the country, People on Sunday (1929) also screens in Sheffield along with Antarctic survival epic The Great White Silence (1924). Accompanists Minima are touring around the Midlands with The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog ( 1927) and around Cumbria with Nosferatu (1922) while Paul Robinson’s HarmonieBand get several opportunities to accompany Berlin: Symphony of a Great City (1927). Meanwhile, in Scotland accompanist David Allison begins a tour with his acclaimed score for Rob Roy (1922).\n\nBack in London, there are one or two Autumn disappointments. The BFI seems to have sadly reverted to their earlier habit of just a single silent film per month, giving us The Phantom of the Moulin Rouge in September and an illustratrd talk on the life of early film pioneer R W Paul in October. Surely they can do better than this. And a couple of months ago we remarked upon the apparent demise of the Barbican as a silent film venue. While not yet quite dead, it certainly appears on life support with just a single film scheduled this Autumn, the almost completely unknown Alraune ( aka Unholy Love, Mandrake, or A Daughter of Destiny) (1928), an everyday story of artificial insemination, genetic engineering and test tube babies together with another starring role for the glacial Brigitte Helm, making it somewhat unmissable.\n\nSo, don’t despair, there is a lot coming your way silent-film-wise this Autumn. Full details for all of these events are of course in our regular monthly listings pages.\n\n10 June\n\nEnd of the line for silent film at the Barbican? London’s Barbican Centre is a long established venue for the discerning silent film viewer. Programming has covered not just established classics but also many rarities, rediscoveries and recently restored prints, particularly from Europe and Asia.\n\nHighlights from last year included the beautifully restored Variety (Dir. E A Dupont, Ger, 1925), stylish Polish melodrama The Call Of The Sea (aka Zew Morza) (Dir. Henryk Szaro, Pol, 1927) silent film diva Asta Nielsen in The Suffragette (Dir. Urban Gad, Ger, 1913) the wistfully beautiful L’Hirondelle et la Mésange (Dir. Andre Antoine, Fr, 1920) and a mighty Czech epic St Wenceslas (Dir. Jan S Kolar, Cz, 1929).\n\nBarbican screenings have also been notable for the quality of their musical accompaniment, from a diverse pool of hugely talented musicians offering the broadest range of musical styles ranging from the more traditional to wildly avant-garde. The Barbican is noteworthy for being a high quality venue not just in terms of customer comfort but also for its superior projection and sound equipment and its always been reassuring to see that silent film screenings at the venue have attracted a respectably sized audience.\n\nHowever, since mid-2018 there has been a notable down shift in the number of silent film screenings at the Barbican. According to our listings, there were 15 silent screenings there in 2016, 20 in 2017 but just 11 in 2018. The downturn has continued into 2019 with just 4 screenings in the first half of the year and no further scheduled events. We can but hope that this current downturn is but a temporary glitch because to loose the Barbican as a venue for silent film would be a major blow to the silent film scene in London and beyond.\n\n13 May\n\nAnother Action Packed Weekend Beckons At The KenBio Barely has the mirth from their Silent Laughter Weekend died away than those good people at the Kennington Bioscope are busy preparing for their next two day spectacular. This will be their fifth annual Silent Film Weekend, due to take place on 1-2 June at the usual venue, the Cinema Museum in Lambeth.\n\nAs always with the KenBio, the emphasis will be on the rarities, the rarely screened and the occasional downright obscure elements of the silent film pantheon. Don’t expect to find here the likes of Caligari, Metropolis, Potemkin or The General. Sure, these films all have great merit but you can get to see them almost any time or any where. Instead, what the KenBio offers is an opportunity to broaden your silent film horizons, to see something you’ve likely never seen before and very probably leave you pleasantly surprised. And this year’s Silent Film Weekend will be no exception, featuring a particularly strong programme of events.\n\nThe highlight of Saturday’s programme, for me at least, will be Laila, a late Norwegian silent from 1929 written and directed by George Schnéevoigt (cameraman on several C T Dreyer films) and without doubt one of the highlights when screened at this year’s Hippodrome Festival of Silent Film (HippFest) Part romantic melodrama, part action-adventure and part ethnographic picture it focuses upon the pressures upon a young woman of Norwegian origin who was raised within the indigenous Sami community of northern Scandinavia. Featuring some wonderfully authentic performances from the mixed professional and amateur cast as well as some stunning action scenes filmed on location amidst Norway’s icy wilderness this is a film that really is unmissable. For just a sample of one of the superbly realised action scenes click here.\n\nOther likely must see screenings s on this first day include The Stone Rider (Der Steinerne Reiter (1923), a German fantasy-horror based upon an idea suggested by Metropolis script writer Thea van Harbou and starring that film’s male lead Rudolf Klein-Rogge. This screening also dovetails neatly in with the BFI’s ongoing Weimar Cinema season. Then there is another chance to sample the comedic talent of Marion Davis, this time in Beauty’s Worth (1922). There is more Hollywood comedy in the form of the Cruise of the Jasper B (1926) with Rod La Rocque before a change of pace and a helping of melodrama with The Price of Pleasure (1925) starring Virginia Valli and Norman Kerry,\n\nThe ‘big ticket’ item on Sunday‘s programme is an appearance by heartthrob Rudolf Valentino in Monsieur Beaucaire (1924) strutting his stuff across 18th century England and France in the company of Bebe Daniels and Lois Wilson. I can’t help but think that this film should always be screened along side Stan Laurel’s Monsieur Don’t Care (1924), a glorious parody featuring ‘ Rhubarb Vaselino’. But, hey ho, you can’t have everything.\n\nAlso of particular interest on Sunday is Souls For Sale ( 1923) starring Eleanor Boardman as a woman escaping her new husband who has murder in mind and finding herself in Hollywood where we are offered a behind the scenes look at the film making industry itself, with notable stars putting in an appearance including Charlie Chaplin and Erich von Stroheim. Then there is Charles Ray in The Old Swimmin’ Hole (1921), something of a slice of hillbilly hokum with not a lot going on but charming all the same and interesting as an early starring vehicle for Laura LaPlante and also as a film devoid of inter-titles. Then there is On To Reno (1928) and what sounds like a wild farce of mistaken and concealed identity. Lastly, a film I’m particularly looking forward to seeing, Common Ground (1916) a legal thriller with Thomas Meighan but but more notable as one of the few surviving films starring Marie Doro (right), by all accounts a hugely talented and stunningly attractive stage actress who quit the business when she got religion and ended her days a forgotten recluse.\n\nAnd there we have it. What looks like another unmissible weekend from the KenBio. Tickets are on sale now here for the whole event or just one day or even just part of a day and full details of the programme are in our June listings page here. So, see you there !\n\n4 April\n\nSilent Feast Or Famine At BFI There is something of a schizophrenic attitude towards silent film at the British Film Institute (BFI). Most of the time, silent films (which still account for a quarter of all cinema history) are just a small adjunct to the regular ‘proper’ film programming, rarely comprising more than a tiny proportion of BFI screenings. As a case in point, with something like 200 BFI film screenings each month, in January there were only seven silents shown, two in February, four in March and just one in April. Famine indeed. Yet in May we will move into feast territory at BFI with no less than 39 silent film events during the month.\n\nAccounting in large part for this very welcome package of cinematic goodies is the first half of what looks like a pretty comprehensive retrospective of Weimar cinema. Starting right from the outset of the Republic there is outrageous comedy from Lubitsch, I Don’t Want To Be A Man (1918) and The Oyster Princess (1919). There is sensational drama with Opium (1919), old dark house melodrama with The Chronicles of the Grey House (1925) and an example of that unique Weimar genre, the alpine drama, with The Fight For The Matterhorn (1928). Then there is the added delight of Pola Negri in Madame Dubarry (1919) not to mention Anna May Wong in Song (1928). Less obscure but still most welcome are Variety (1925), Waxworks (1924) and The Last Laugh (1924). Most of these films rarely get a screening and nearly all come with live musical accompaniment. As a result, we can forgive BFI for a bit of padding out in the season by including some excellent but oh so regularly screened Weimar classics such as Caligari (1920), Nosferatu (1922) and The Golem (1920), mainly with just their recorded scores.\n\nBut Weimar is not just the only silent delight in May. The BFI is also putting on a weekend of Victorian cinema. Pride of place goes to a second screening of The Great Victorian Moving Picture Show, a compilation of 60mm and 68mm films from the Victorian era, presented by the BFI’s Bryony Dixon, with John Sweeney and his Biograph Band – reprising their spectacular sell-out event at the 2018 London Film Festival. But there is also an experts forum, Heroes of Victorian Film, who will champion the British Victorian era filmmaker they think deserves to be better known throughout the land, not to mention a collection of London focused films, Six Stories About London in Victorian Film.\n\nSo, all in all, May is a great month for silent film at BFI. Tis only a pity it doesn’t happen every month. Details of all of these screenings can be found in the ‘May Listings‘ page of silentfilmcalendar.org.\n\n18 March\n\nRare Michael Curtiz Silent Film Screening in SW7 Director Michael Curtiz (image, right) was certainly one of the most prolific and probably also one of the most accomplished directors to have worked in Hollywood. Able to turn his hand to almost any genre, his most recognised film is probably Casablanca (1942, image, left) for which he won one of his two Academy Awards. But other classic examples of his work include The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) with Errol Flynn, Angels With Dirty Faces (1938) and Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942) with Jimmy Cagney, Mildred Pierce (1945) with Joan Crawford, and White Christmas (1954) with Bing Crosby. He even made a film with Elvis Presley, King Creole (1958). But before he took up Warner Brothers’ invitation to travel to Hollywood, Curtiz (then known as Mihaly Kertesz) was an equally prolific director in Europe, making over sixty films in Hungary, Denmark, Germany and Austria. However, this early work is much less widely known and very rarely screened. The good people at Kennington Bioscope are doing their best to put this situation right, screening two Curtiz films last year, Cab No.13 (Fiaker Nr. 13) and The Golden Butterfly ( Der Goldene Schmetterling), both made in 1926 and both starring Curtiz’s then wife, Lila Damita.\n\nBut there is now a chance to catch a rare screening of another Curtiz silent, one which can genuinely claim to rival not only earlier Italian blockbusters such as Quo Vadis (1913) or Cabiria (1914) but also the work of Griffith and DeMille in Hollywood. The film is Sodom and Gomorrah: The Legend of Sin and Punishment (1922). Regarded as the grandest, most monumental film of the Austrian silent film era some estimates number the cast and crew as high as 14,000 people and a main set towering 230 feet high. Then there was the pyrotechnician, missing fingers from both hands and part of his nose due to earlier accidents, but who still handled explosives with an air of casualness….and with a lighted cigar in his mouth. In charge of all this, director Curtiz apparently had little regard for the money he was spending or the well being of cast and crew, not to mention being in the process of divorcing his first wife, Lucie Doraine, who was also the star of the film. The end result was a three hour monster, eventually cut down as a result of marketing and censorship pressures to little more than 90 minutes. Long thought to have survived in just fragments, a recently restored version of the film now runs to around 140 minutes.\n\nAnd it will be screened on 2 April at the Austrian Cultural Forum in Knightsbridge in London. This, along with other recent screenings, is helping to establish the Forum as an increasingly important (albeit little known) venue for Austrian themed silent film screenings with live musical accompaniment. Last year, for example, they screened a trio of von Stroheim classics, Blind Husbands (1919), Foolish Wives (1922).and Queen Kelly (1929), while this year they have already screened G W Pabst’s superlative Joyless Street (1925) and further silent screenings are promised.\n\nFull details of this screening of Sodom and Gomorrah are on Silentfimcalendar.org‘s ‘April Listings’ page and watch out for details of further silent film screenings at the Austrian Cultural Forum.\n\n8 February\n\nSilent Film Festival Frenzy Nationwide There are an awful lot of silent films cropping up in various film festivals across the UK over the next couple of months so if you fancy getting out ‘on the road’, read on for details of some quite exceptional films around the country.\n\nEarly March sees the return of the annual Borderlines Film Festival in the Herefordshire area. This year they are working with the ever more ambitious South West Silents team to screen a couple of films from the long underrated director Lois Weber, The Blot (1921) and Suspense (1913). Silent London’s Pamela Hutchinson will be along to introduce the films and talk about Weber’s influence on film development while live musical accompaniment for the fi"
