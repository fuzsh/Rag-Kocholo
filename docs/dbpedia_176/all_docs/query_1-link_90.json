        "text": "To help Texans better understand issues surrounding access to health care services, Texas Cancer Information is now providing easy access to United States, Texas, and Texas county-level poverty and median income estimates.\n\nThe poverty and median income estimates are from the U.S. Census Bureau, Small Area Estimates Branch, release date December 2008 for 2006 and 2007 data and November 2009 for 2008 data. The U.S. Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program produces annual estimates of income and poverty statistics for all states, counties, and school districts. The main objective of the SAIPE program is to provide estimates of income and poverty for the administration of federal programs and the allocation of federal funds to local jurisdictions.\n\nThe SAIPE program produces the following state and county estimates:\n\ntotal number of people in poverty\n\nnumber of children under age 5 in poverty (for states only)\n\nnumber of related children ages 5 to 17 in families in poverty\n\nnumber of children under age 18 in poverty\n\nmedian household income\n\nThe estimates are not direct counts from enumerations or administrative records and they are not direct estimates from sample surveys. The SAIPE program models income and poverty estimates by combining survey data with population estimates and administrative records. Please refer to the U.S. Census Bureau SAIPE Methodology page at http://www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/methods/index.html for more details and for General Cautions About Comparisons of Estimates.\n\nPoverty and Median Income Estimates Search Criteria"
