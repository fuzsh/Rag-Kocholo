        "text": "Texans and people writing about Texas often find it helpful to subdivide the large state's area into regions, such as north Texas, south Texas, east Texas, west Texas, and central Texas. Each of these regions has its own geographical and cultural identity.\n\nWhile most Texans have a general understanding of the meaning of terms like \"east Texas\" and \"west Texas,\" there are not any places that are organized as and named \"East Texas\" or \"West Texas\" as such, and any two people are likely to describe the boundaries of these regions differently. Nevertheless, these region names are used constantly, so it helps to lay them out on a map, even if for nothing else than as a starting point for discussion.\n\nSince the mid-to-late 1960s, the counties of Texas have been organized into 24 separate area-wide councils and commissions. With names like \"East Texas Council of Governments\" and \"South Texas Development Council,\" these voluntary-membership organizations provide insight into the regional identity of their members. Our map below consolidates these 24 area bodies into a total of seven regions."
