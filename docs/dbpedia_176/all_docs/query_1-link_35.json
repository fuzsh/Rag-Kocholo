        "text": "Overview of the State\n\nTexas is a vast state, with regional differences in geography, population size, and demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. This section provides an overview of these variations and the existing challenges related to health care availability and access, as well as cultural literacy and effectiveness in meeting the health needs of Texas mothers, children, and their families.\n\nGeography\n\nTexas is the second largest state in the United States (behind Alaska) in terms of land. The Lone Star State encompasses approximately 262,000 square miles, and accounts for 7.4 percent of the total United States (U.S.) land area. The land area of Texas is equal to that of all six New England states and Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina combined [[1]]. Texas has a larger land area than any single country completely contained in Europe including France and the Ukraine. Texas is slightly longer than it is wide, with the greatest straight-line distance from the northwest edge of the Panhandle to the southern tip of Texas below Brownsville on the Rio Grande spanning 801 miles [[2]]. The broadest expanse from east to west is 773 miles from the Sabine River in Newton County to the western bulge of the Rio Grande just above El Paso [2].\n\nThe geography of Texas is as varied as it is large. Texas includes 254 counties that are classified as either rural or urban (Figure 1), with 88.4 percent of the population residing in urban counties. The five largest metropolitan areas in Texas are located around the cities of Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, Austin, and Fort Worth, and these areas encompass multiple counties. Given the immense size of Texas, the distance that some individuals must travel to receive health care services can be a significant challenge to accessing and receiving those services, especially for those living in rural counties (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Rural and Urban County Designations in Texas, 2018.\n\nFor administrative purposes, each of the 254 Texas counties is assigned to one of 8 public health regions. Figure 2 outlines the eight public health regions and the city where each regional office is located. Regions 8, 9/10, and 11 contain border counties. Due to how varied each region is in terms of geography, demographics, and health care needs, unique findings associated with each region’s health care needs is discussed in this report in the “Regional Findings” chapter.\n\nFigure 2. Texas Public Health Regions.\n\nPopulation\n\nJust as the Texas geography is varied, so is the distribution of its population (Figure 3). Differences in race/ethnic composition, along with the high percentage of foreign-born residents, present cultural literacy and effectiveness challenges when it comes to meeting maternal and child health (MCH) needs.\n\nFigure 3. Texas Total Population, 2018.\n\nTexas also has the second-largest population size in the U.S. (behind California), with an estimated population of over 28.9 million in 2019 (Figure 4). According to U.S. Census annual estimates, Texas has been one of the fastest-growing states in the nation since 2010, with a 14.9 percent increase in the Texas population from 2010 to 2019. The Texas Demographic Center predicts that by 2050, the population in Texas will exceed 47 million people [[3]]. The majority of Texans live in the northeast, east, central, south, and gulf coast regions of the state (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 4. Total Population by State Rankings\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2018.\n\nPrepared by: Maternal and Child Health Epidemiology Unit\n\nApr 2020\n\nRace/Ethnicity\n\nThe population of Texas is racially/ethnically diverse with 41.8 percent non-Hispanic White (hereafter referred to as White in the text and graphs), 39.3 percent is Hispanic, 11.8 percent is non-Hispanic Black (hereafter referred to as Black), 4.8 percent is non-Hispanic Asian (hereafter referred to as Asian), and 2.2 percent is non-Hispanic other (data not shown) [3]. Counties with the highest proportions of Hispanic populations are primarily located in the southern and western regions of Texas along the Texas-Mexico border. In 2018, three major cities in Texas (Brownsville, Laredo, and El Paso) were located in counties where over 75 percent of the population was Hispanic, and another three cities (San Antonio, Corpus Christi, and Odessa) were located in counties where over 50 percent of the population was Hispanic (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5. Percent of the Population who are Hispanic or Latino, 2018.\n\nThe distribution of the Black population in Texas (Figure 6) differed from that of the Hispanic population. Based on 2018 Texas Demographic Center data, counties with the highest proportions of Black populations were largely concentrated in the northeastern, eastern, and north gulf-coast regions of the state. In contrast to the Hispanic population, the Black population along the Texas-Mexico border was low and estimated to be slightly above 30,000 in 2018.\n\nFigure 6. Percent of the Population who are Black, 2018.\n\nForeign-Born\n\nTexas had a higher percentage of foreign-born residents (17.2 percent) compared to the nationwide average (13.7 percent) in 2018. In total, 62.3 percent of foreign-born residents in Texas were not U.S. citizens. Over 66.5 percent of foreign-born Texas residents were born in Latin American countries – more than 16 percentage points more than the national average [[4], [5]]. Approximately 35.5 percent of Texans spoke a language other than English at home in 2018. Almost 30 percent of Texans spoke Spanish at home, compared with 13.5 percent of U.S. residents [[6]]. Texas border counties had high percentages of foreign-born residents in 2014-2018, as did several other counties in west and northwest Texas (Figure 7). Counties containing the non-border cities of Houston, Dallas, and Austin also had high concentrations of foreign-born residents. Given these demographic and social variations, the Texas Department of State Health Services’ (DSHS) Community Health Worker (CHW) program has increased the number of certified CHWs to address the need for cultural literacy and effectiveness [[7]].\n\nFigure 7. Percent of the Population who are Foreign Born, 2014-2018.\n\nAge\n\nAccording to 2018 American Community Survey 1-year estimates, Texas is the second youngest population in the United States, with a median age of 34.9 years, behind Utah (median age 31 years) [[8]].\n\nIn 2018, Texas had the second-largest proportion of the population comprised of children younger than 18 years old (25.8 percent) in the nation [[9]] (Figure 8). About 7.1 percent of the Texas population were younger than 5 years old, 14.3 percent were 5 to 14 years old, and 4.3 percent were 15 to 17 years old. Texans younger than 22 years of age accounted for 31.4 percent of the total population in 2018. Border counties in South Texas had high percentages of individuals younger than 22 years old, as did several counties in the Texas Panhandle (Figure 9) [[10]].\n\nFigure 8. Percent of Population Under 18\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2018.\n\nPrepared by: Maternal and Child Health Epidemiology Unit\n\nApr 2020\n\nFigure 9. Percent of the Population Under 22 Years Old, 2018.\n\nWomen comprised half of the total population in Texas in 2018, and women of childbearing age comprise an important part of the population. Women between 18 and 44 years of age accounted for 18.7 percent of the total population of Texas [8]. For the most part, urban counties with large metropolitan areas (including counties containing the cities of Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio, Austin, and El Paso) had the highest proportions of women in their childbearing years (Figure 10).\n\nFigure 10. Percent of the Population Who Are 18-44 Years Old and Female, 2018.\n\nChildren with Special Health Care Needs\n\nThe 2017-2018 National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH) estimated that 16.9 percent of Texas children ages 0-17 had a special health care need. Of those Texas children identified as Children with Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN), 42.4 percent were White, 30.4 percent were Hispanic, and 20.9 percent were Black [[11]].\n\nSocioeconomic Characteristics\n\nSocioeconomic characteristics such as income and poverty, education, unemployment, and crime rates are added challenges for meeting the health needs of mothers, children, and families in Texas. The presence of an increased number of risk factors of this nature in a community pose a danger to the health of the individuals within that community throughout the entire life course.\n\nIncome and Poverty\n\nIncome inequalities exist within different areas in Texas and largely reflect gender and race/ethnic differences. In 2018, the median household income in Texas was $60,629, which was slightly lower than the national median household income of $61,937 [8].\n\nThe Federal Poverty Level (FPL) is set by the U.S. Census Bureau based on income thresholds that vary by family size and composition. If a family’s total income is less than their determined income threshold, then that family and every individual in it is considered to be in poverty. These poverty thresholds are used throughout the mainland U.S. and do not vary geographically; however, they are updated each year to account for inflation. According to 2018 American Community Survey estimates, Texas had a higher proportion (14.9 percent) of people living below the FPL than the national average of 13.1 percent [8].\n\nThe proportion of adults living below the FPL varies geographically and by sex. Among the adult population aged 18 and older in Texas, counties with a large proportion of adults living below the FPL in 2014-2018 were concentrated in the Texas-Mexico border region. Several counties in east Texas, north central Texas, and the Texas Panhandle also had high rates of adults living below 200 percent FPL (Figure 11).\n\nFigure 11. Percent of the Adult Population Below 200 Percent Federal Poverty Level, 2014-2018.\n\nIt was estimated that about 16.3 percent of the adult female population lived below the FPL in Texas in 2018 [8]. Counties in the Texas-Mexico border region had high rates of women living below the FPL, as did several counties in rural East Texas, west of Fort Worth, and between Lubbock and Amarillo in the Panhandle. The fastest growing major metropolitan areas – Austin, Houston, and San Antonio – had a relatively low proportion of women living below the FPL (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 12. Estimated Percent of the Adult Female Population Below 100% Federal Poverty Level, 2014-2018.\n\nFood Security\n\nFood security refers to a household’s ability to provide enough food to keep each member of the family active and healthy. Along with negative health outcomes, food insecurity can make it difficult for children to learn and grow [[12]]. Overall, the food insecurity rate in the United States is 12.5 percent of the population. In the United States, an estimated 17.5 percent of children live in food insecurity. As of 2017, 22.5 percent, nearly one in four children in Texas live in a food insecure household. There are eight counties in Texas where 30 percent or more children experience food insecurity (data not shown) [[13]].\n\nEducation\n\nAs higher educational attainment has been associated with positive health outcomes, it is crucial to understand education within the context of Texas [[14]]. Among those 25 years and older, a greater percentage of both men (16.6 percent) and women (15.4 percent) in Texas had less than a high school education in 2018, compared with men (12.3 percent) and women (11.1 percent) nationwide. About 25 percent of Texas residents aged 25 and older had a high school diploma or equivalent as their highest level of educational attainment, and 19.6 percent had a bachelor’s degree or higher [9].\n\nEducational attainment levels are not evenly distributed throughout the state. There were four counties where the educational attainment of a bachelor’s degree or higher was greater than 40 percent among individuals 25 years of age and older: Denton and Collin counties outside of Dallas, Fort Bend county outside of Houston, and Travis county in central Texas (part of the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan area). Counties where less than 10 percent of the people aged 25 years and older had a bachelor’s degree or higher were largely clustered in south Texas, west Texas, and east Texas [8].\n\nUnemployment\n\nWhile Texas had a higher percentage of adults without a high school diploma compared to the nation, it had the same rate of unemployment (4.9 percent) as seen nationwide (4.9 percent) in 2018 [8]. Even among persons aged 25-64 without a high school diploma, Texas had a lower rate of unemployment (5.0 percent) compared to the national average for this educational attainment group (7.5 percent). Consistent with nationwide trends, the Texas unemployment rate increased as education level decreased. The unemployment rate in Texas was as low as 2.8 percent among those with a bachelor’s degree or higher in 2018 [8].\n\nCrime\n\nCrime impacts the physical and behavioral health and wellbeing of mothers, children, and their families. Neighborhood crime can be detrimental to the safety of children by creating unstable living environments. By assessing communities where crimes occur more frequently, it is possible to identify areas where high risk populations reside and help prevent adverse consequences. In 2018, Texas’ Crime Rate was 2,776.6 crimes per 100,000 persons [[15]].\n\nTexas index crime statistics include two major categories of crime: property crimes and violent crimes. Property crimes consist of burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft. The 2018 property crime rate was 2,539.7 crimes per 100,000 Texans. The highest property crime rates in 2017 were primarily localized within larger Texas cities and their surrounding areas (Figure 13) [15].\n\nFigure 13. Property Crime Rate per 100,000, 2018.\n\nViolent crimes recorded in the Uniform Crime Report index include murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. The violent crime rate was 435.3 crimes per 100,000 Texans. The highest violent crime rates in 2018 were primarily concentrated near the larger cities of the panhandle: Odessa, Lubbock, and Amarillo (Figure 14). Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Corpus Christi and surrounding areas also had a high concentration of violent crimes [15].\n\nFigure 14. Violent Crime Rate per 100,000, 2018.\n\nViolence within Texas families has also been recognized as a growing threat to the safety of Texans. The Uniform Crime Report indicated 197,023 family violence incidents in Texas in 2018. Although the largest percentage of family violence was between other family members (50.2 percent), family violence also occurred among spouses/couples (33.4 percent) and within parent-child relationships (16.4 percent). Females were more likely to be victims in family violence. Of the victims whose gender was known, 28.4 percent were male, and 71.6 percent were female. The 25-29 age group had the highest number of victims in family violence [15].\n\nMobility/Migration\n\nMoving or relocating is one of life’s most stressful events and can impact individual health and well-being. For example, results from the Texas School Survey of Substance Use show that this may influence risk behaviors in youth, as students in grades 7 to 12 living in their current school district for three years or less are more likely to use illicit drugs than those living there more than three years [[16]]. Texas demographic data illustrates patterns of migration that include moving into the state from other states and countries and moving within the state between counties.\n\nOut-of-State Mobility/Migration\n\nFour Texas metropolitan areas (Houston, Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio) together added more people than any state in the country (except for Texas as a whole) between 2016 and 2017. The population in these four metropolitan areas increased by more than 350,000 people in a year. Among these four fastest-growing areas in Texas, two to three percent of the population consists of people who moved to the area from out of state (out-of-state migration). Some rural counties also had high levels of out-of-state migration in 2014-2018, particularly in the parts of the state bordering Oklahoma and the Panhandle, as well as in west Texas (Figure 15) [8]. The majority of Texas counties had little to no new residents from other states.\n\nFigure 15. Percent of Population that Moved from Another State to Texas, 2014-2018.\n\nThe oil and gas industry is concentrated in three areas of the state (Figure 16). A few counties with a large number of approved oil or gas wells in 2016-2017 also had high out-of-state migration. Migration of people into these areas can be attributed to the jobs created by the oil and gas industry [[17]]. Additionally, Texas is home to 13 U.S. military installations. A number of counties that saw a high level of out-of-state migration also have a U.S. military base nearby. In 2017, the military contributed to 224,065 direct jobs to the Texas economy [[18]].\n\nFigure 16. Approved Gas and Oil Sites, July 2016-June 2017.\n\nIn-State Mobility/Migration\n\nAnother aspect of mobility is the number of people who move within or between counties in Texas. While out-of-state migration may reflect job growth, mobility of populations within a county and between counties is more complicated.\n\nCounties with universities and colleges in Texas were among the highest rates of within-county relocations over a one-year period [8]. College Station, Austin, Lubbock, and San Antonio are home to four of the ten largest universities in Texas, which can partially explain the high rates of within-county relocations in these areas. College students tend to move often within the same county to take advantage of lower rents.\n\nHealth Care Coverage and Access\n\nHealth insurance and access to health care are fundamental to the health of Texans. A major finding that emerged from the Title V stakeholder meetings was that limited access to health care is a widespread concern. With 19.4 percent of the state’s population <65 years of age uninsured, Texas has the highest uninsured rate the country [[19]]. Percent of the population that is uninsured is shown in Table 1. Region 11 has the highest uninsured rate and Region 7 has the lowest rate.\n\nTable 1: Percent of Population <65 that is Uninsured by State and Public Health Region\n\nRegion\n\nPercent Uninsured\n\nTexas\n\n19.40%\n\nRegion 1\n\n19.50%\n\nRegion 2/3\n\n18.60%\n\nRegion 4/5N\n\n20.20%\n\nRegion 6/5S\n\n19.90%\n\nRegion 7\n\n15.10%\n\nRegion 8\n\n17.30%\n\nRegion 9/10\n\n21.90%\n\nRegion 11\n\n27.30%\n\nSource: United States Census Bureau (2018). Small Area Health Insurance Estimates, 2017.\n\nPrepared by: Maternal and Child Health Epidemiology Unit\n\nApr 2020\n\nHealth Insurance\n\nTexas had the highest proportion of the population without health care coverage of any state in 2018, with 17.7 percent of all Texans uninsured. The national average was 8.9 percent. Texas had higher proportions of uninsured children, uninsured women of childbearing age, and uninsured individuals living below 200 percent FPL than the corresponding uninsured percentages for these groups nationwide. In Texas, 8.3 percent of children younger than 6 years old were uninsured, and 27.8 percent of Texas women aged 19 to 44 were uninsured. Furthermore, 29.6 percent of Texans living below 100 percent FPL were uninsured [9]. In addition, 2017-2018 NSCH data showed that 7.2 percent of CSHCN ages 0-17 in Texas had no health insurance or had periods of no coverage during the year prior to the survey, similar to the nationwide average of 7.4 percent [[20]].\n\nCounties with high proportions of uninsured children younger than 6 years of age were concentrated in west Texas between Odessa and San Antonio, and in the Panhandle (Figure 17). The Texas-Mexico border regions and several counties outside Lubbock and Waco had high proportions of women aged 19 to 44 without health insurance (Figure 18).\n\nFigure 17. Children Younger than 6 Years Old Without Health Insurance, 2014-2018.\n\nFigure 18. Percent of Females (19-44 Years) Without Health Insurance, 2014-2018.\n\nAccess to Health Care\n\nGiven the large size of the state and the vast distances between points of care for health services in rural areas, access to care in the state of Texas can be a challenge. There was an increase in the number of primary care physicians in Texas from 18,834 (70.6 per 100,000 population) in 2013 to 21,746 (74.1 per 100,000 population) in 2018. However, thirty-four counties still had no primary care physicians in 2018 (Figure 19).\n\nFigure 19. Number of Primary Health Care Physicians per 100,000 Population, 2018.\n\nThe total number of obstetricians (OB) and/or gynecologists (GYN) increased from 2,483 in 2013 to 2,640 in 2017. However, the density of OB/GYNs in Texas decreased from 18.5 OB/GYNs per 100,000 females in 2013 to 18.2 per 100,000 females in 2017. A total of 151 counties had no OB/GYN in 2017 [[21]].\n\nThe Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) designation employs a ratio of population to primary care physicians to determine whether an area has a shortage of physicians. The ratio threshold is 3,500:1 and is reduced to 3,000:1 in areas with high needs, such as at least 20 percent of population below poverty level or more than 20 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. Areas that exceed these ratios may qualify for designation as HPSAs. Other factors, such as time/distance to nearest source of care and population composition, are also included in the federal HPSA criteria. Recruiting and retaining health care professionals is an ongoing challenge not only in rural areas but in some urban areas as well. In rural areas, retention of health care professionals is mostly due to population size, whereas in some urban areas, access is limited because many providers do not accept Medicaid or because patients are not enrolled in Medicaid and are unable to pay out-of-pocket [[22]]. Most counties in Texas are designated as either a whole-county or partial-county HPSA (Figure 20).\n\nFigure 20. Texas Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Areas, April 2019.\n\nParents who responded to the Title V Community Outreach Survey indicated that finding a mental or behavioral health professional was very or extremely difficult, especially finding one that treats children. The National Association for School Psychologists recommends a student-to-provider ratio of 1,000:1 [[23]]. In Texas, only 30 counties met this recommendation in 2019, including Travis and Bexar counties, which respectively contain the large cities of Austin and San Antonio (Figure 21).\n\nFigure 21. Ratio of Students to School Psychologists, 2019.\n\nPsychiatrist shortage is also a concern. The HPSA cut-offs for designating an area with a mental health shortage is 30,000 people or residentsto one psychiatrist, and 20,000 people/residentsto one psychiatrist in areas with high needs[[24]]. One hundred and seventy-three counties do not have a psychiatrist, and many that do have at least one psychiatrist meet the HPSA criteria for the mental health shortage designation [[25]]. Several counties surrounding major cities, however, met one of the two HPSA cut-offs (Figure 22).\n\nFigure 22. Ratio of County Population to Number of Psychiatrist, 2018.\n\nAdditional challenges exist in identifying psychiatrists who specialize in child psychiatry. It is estimated that there are only about 8,300 practicing child and adolescent psychiatrists in the country [[26]]. There are almost no child and adolescent psychiatrists in the state practicing outside of major cities in Texas.\n\nEmerging Issues\n\nThe positioning of the DSHS’ Maternal and Child Health Section (MCHS) program staff at both the state and regional levels allows a broad and local approach in addressing current and emerging issues, including lung injuries associated with vaping, novel coronavirus (COVID-19), and maternal mortality and severe morbidity in Texas.\n\nLung Injury Associated with Vaping\n\nIn 2018, DSHS announced vaping usage had reached epidemic levels [[27]]. Vapes or electronic cigarettes are tobacco products that contain a battery which heat a cartridge containing nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and/or cannabinoid (CBD) oil, along with flavoring. The heat creates an aerosol that is then inhaled into the lungs [[28]]. These products have been on the market since 2007, but have recently experienced a rise in popularity, particularly among youth. As of 2014, these products have become the most commonly used tobacco product for youth [[29]]. Vaping is associated with a number of dangers including: electronic devices catching on fire, nicotine use harming adolescent brain development, and poisoning from swallowing the vaping liquid. Particular attention has been drawn to the negative health outcome of bronchiolitis obliterans, a lung injury associated with vaping. This lung injury is characterized by scaring of air sacs within the lungs, which causes the narrowing of air ways. As the airways narrow, patients experience shortness of breath and wheezing [29].\n\nAs of February 2020, in the U.S. there have been about 2,800 hospitalized cases of lung injury associated with vaping [29]. Of those cases, there were 250 cases of lung injury and six deaths associated with vaping in Texas. Cases have been seen in all regions of Texas, with a concentration in Region 2/3 (136 cases). In Texas, patients range in age from age 13 to age 75, with the median age of 22 [27].\n\nDSHS Response\n\nIn response to the vaping epidemic, DSHS has utilized both existing tobacco programing, as well as developed novel vaping specific programs. Some of the existing programming includes the Texas tobacco phone quitting line called ‘Yes Quit.’ This program includes both online and telephone resources for individuals quitting tobacco use. Other existing tobacco programming includes the ‘Students and Youth Working Hard Against Tobacco!’ or the ‘Say What!’ program which is a youth tobacco prevention collation program working to reduce youth tobacco usage.\n\nWhile many of the existing tobacco initiatives have adapted to also address electronic cigarettes, more specific vaping programing has been developed. Within the DSHS Tobacco Prevention and Control Program website, there is now a specific vaping section which houses resources and information related to vaping. The tobacco unit has also developed a general presentation that can be tailored to a variety of different audiences, highlighting vaping information, health risks, and prevention strategies. In 2019, DSHS began a campaign targeting vaping in high schools. This program includes a toolkit, resources and strategies for instructors, school posters, a quiz style game, and fact sheets on vaping. A media campaign is an important part of this initiative; DSHS has developed radio and social media advertisements to address the dangers of vaping.\n\nAddressing Maternal Mortality and Severe Morbidity\n\nIn April 2017, the DSHS’ MCHS staff attended the National AIM meeting in Baltimore, MD. Key partners were identified, and the staff learned about effective and efficient strategies for implementing Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM) bundles in Texas. In August 2017, the 85th Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill 17 which required the state to implement Maternal Health and Safety Initiatives. In December 2017, DSHS applied for and was selected as the lead coordinating agency to implement the AIM maternal safety bundles, starting with Obstetric Hemorrhage (launched November/December 2018), Hypertension (launch postponed to Winter 2020 due to COVID-19), and Obstetric Care for Women with Opioid Use Disorder (pilot currently being conducted).\n\nIn January 2018, DSHS created the AIM Implementation Advisory Workgroup. This group includes representatives from Texas’ Perinatal Advisory Committee, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, the Consortium of Texas Certified Nurse Midwives, the Texas Hospital Association, the Texas Medical Association, the Texas Collaborative for Healthy Mothers and Babies, and the Texas Nursing Association. DSHS held webinars and sent a letter to all Texas birthing hospitals to recruit hospitals to participate.\n\nAs of August 2020, 218 of Texas’ 223 hospitals with obstetric lines of service are enrolled in TexasAIM and participate in the TexasAIM Obstetric Hemorrhage Bundle. These hospitals represent approximately 98 percent of all the birthing hospitals in Texas and provide care for approximately 99 percent of the births in Texas and approximately 9.9 percent of the births in the nation. A harvest meeting was scheduled for June 2020; however, due to state and local orders around social distancing and large meetings, the meeting was cancelled and is being rescheduled for the Winter 2020-2021. The harvest meeting was to celebrate the completion of the in-person learning sessions associated with the Obstetric Hemorrhage Bundle while launching the Hypertension bundle.\n\nIn May 2020, TexasAIM implementation was halted due to COVID and TexasAIM faculty Chair approached the MCHS staff to disseminate information around COVID-19 to hospitals given that 97 percent of the birthing hospitals participate in TexasAIM. Weekly webinars on COVID-19 and the impact on labor and delivery practice can be discussed as it relates to readiness, recognition, response, and reporting and systems learning. Discussions relate to the guidelines and protocols hospitals are using for the prevention of anemia and how they are conserving blood products, transport protocols and how a rural hospital was approaching their COVID-19 response.\n\nAdditionally, MCHS has been collaborating with staff from the Substance Use Disorder Unit at the Texas Health and Human Services Commission and the Texas Targeted Opioid Response Initiative to improve the quality of care for women with substance use disorders and children with NAS. In June 2018, DSHS launched a pilot project to implement the Obstetric Care for Women with Opioid Use Disorder Bundle through the TexasAIM initiative. Specific hospital systems started piloting the bundle in the early 2020 to make sure the bundle is properly customized for Texas prior to statewide implementation.\n\nDSHS is responsible for overseeing the maternal levels of care designation process for Texas. The maternal levels of care designation rule became effective on March 1, 2018 and the designation for maternal level of care is an eligibility requirement for Medicaid reimbursement beginning September 1, 2021. MCH Epidemiology is providing program support by calculating maternal health outcome measures for ongoing program evaluation, monitoring, and re-designation every three years.\n\nAddressing COVID-19\n\nIn 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged in an outbreak in Wuhan, China, causing a respiratory disease known as COVID-19 and leading to a pandemic which is ongoing as of August 2020. The disease was first reported in the U.S. in late January 2020 [[30]], and Texas reported its first case in early March 2020.\n\nImplications for the MCH population\n\nNeeds are continuing to be assessed during the pandemic. The full implications of the virus and associated systematic changes that have been taken to prevent its transmission, such as school closures and isolation, are still emerging.\n\nAlthough the implications of this virus on pregnant women are still being studied, pregnant women are encouraged to take precautions to protect themselves from the risk of infection. Additionally, DSHS is assisting TexasAIM hospitals by hosting weekly webinars as it relates to key practices in obstetric care. Through TexasAIM, hospitals are preparing for cases to start showing up in labor and delivery units.\n\nThe risks associated with COVID-19 to pregnancy outcomes, to infants born to infected mothers, and for breastfeeding infants are still unknown and under investigation. Impacts of COVID-19 on other maternal and child health population are also unknown, but the need to monitor the health and wellbeing of all MCH populations is evident.\n\nDSHS Response\n\nThe DSHS commissioner, Dr. John Hellerstedt, declared a public health disaster on March 19, 2020. DSHS is working with the CDC to closely monitor the situation and disseminate the most updated information and resources on a separate webpage dedicated to the coronavirus, hosted on the DSHS website. DSHS launched a COVID-19 case dashboard which is updated daily with the preliminary number of cases by county and include basic demographic information [[31]].\n\nMaternal and Child Health Section (MCH) is working to support families and provide education, awareness, support and resources to improve the health of women, infants, children, adolescents, and children and youth with special healthcare needs (CYSHCN) throughout Texas. As such, MCH is participating in various strategic workgroups which help the Section prioritize its efforts.\n\nThe first is a workgroup with the Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS), Prevention and Early Intervention Division. This Division is responsible for the home-visiting and other direct family prevention programs in Texas. The workgroup created an infographic around children under the age of two wearing masks, and is working on one about families preparing medical and child placement plans in case family members contract COVID-19 and need to be isolated. This information is being shared with their Help and Hopes Contractors and contractors throughout Texas. Additional resources will be developed as needs arise.\n\nAnother workgroup concerning child & family mental health supports focuses on the long-term mental health impact of isolation. This is led by the Texas Child Mental Health Care Consortium at the University of Texas System. The workgroup brings many different State Agencies and private entities together to discuss the mental health impact of COVID-19 to children and families and long-term issues that may arise from isolation.\n\nThe Texas Prevention Framework Workgroup is comprised of State Agencies, such as DSHS, the Health and Human Services Commission, DFPS, the UT System, and the Texas Education Agency, as well as private entities such as Texas Protects and the St. David’s Foundation. The goal of this workgroup is to develop resources and awareness around child abuse and neglect. Currently, the group is focusing on the effects of isolation on families and new tends seen around child maltreatment. The group plans to develop resources and awareness materials to targeted populations.\n\nMCH is also pivoting many of its current programs to address specific needs for families related to COVID-19. MCH continues to provide resources and guidance to its Community Based Contractors, who provide case management to families who have children with special healthcare needs. This includes emergency planning, counseling and coordination of healthcare treatment plans. MCH has also allowing provisions in its contracts to provide additional support and resources for families. This includes one-time payments for families in crisis to help pay for food, clothing, transportation, home and medical supplies, and other basic needs. Texas PHRs received $1.2M to hire contracted employees to help with isolation supports in communities across the state.\n\nMCH meets bi-weekly with current Medical Child Abuse Resources and Education System (MEDCARES) contractors. The goal of the MEDCARES Program is to improve services related to the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of child abuse and neglect in hospital or academic health care settings through funding, collaboration, and outcome reporting. The COVID-19 meetings are a way for MCH to learn real-time issues seen around child abuse and neglect within contractors, and for contractors to share resources with each other.\n\nMCH is hosting weekly webinars with the TexasAIM participating birthing hospitals. Through a team of experts, the program is sharing various resources, management strategies for all patients with current blood shortages, PPE for labor and delivery units, supports for rural hospitals, and lessons learned. MCH is also using its epidemiological expertise to track and survey the effects of COVID-19 in families.\n\nFinally, MCH is working with DSHS Communications and other partners to ensure relevant, reliable information and resources to help inform the general public on many aspects of COVID. It is important that Texans have a one-stop-shop that provides credible resources and information in a format and level that is easily digestible. Currently MCH is using the DSHS COVID-19 webpages and working with other agencies to link to and enhance their pages to create a network of resources.\n\nTexas Leadership\n\nIn July 2020, Governor Greg Abbott announced Cecile Young as the new Executive Commissioner for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC). Young previously served in various roles at HHSC, including Acting Executive Commissioner, Chief Deputy Executive Commissioner, and as the Chief of Staff. Ms. Young has more than 30 years of experience in state government.
