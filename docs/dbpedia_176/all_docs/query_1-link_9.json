        "text": "Of the 254 counties in Texas, 14 were named after their original county seats. Of the remaining 240, 199 were named after people, and 27 were named after geographic features, such as rivers. The other 15 have miscellaneous names in English, Spanish, or Indian languages.\n\nOf the 199 counties named after people:\n\n66 are named after men who fought against Mexico in the Texas Revolution. This includes 11 counties named after 13 men who died at the Alamo - including a trio of brothers.\n\n58 are named after men who held public office in the Republic of Texas. 18 of those were also soldiers in the Texas Revolution.\n\n54 are named after men who held public office in the state of Texas. 27 of those also fought in the Texas Revolution and/or held office in the Republic.\n\n66 counties are named after people who aren't in the above three groups. This includes Texas Rangers, Confederate soldiers, U.S. presidents and other office holders, figures from Spain or Mexico, businessmen and landowners, and others.\n\nNo Texas counties are named directly after women, but three counties are named for things named after women - the Angelina River, the Guadalupe River, and Mission Nuestra Se√±ora del Refugio.\n\nIn the list below, a county name in normal font indicates the primary source of the name. Italics are used to indicate a secondary source of the county name. For example:\n\nAustin County was named for Stephen F. Austin, whose career as a colonist earned him the title, \"The Father of Texas.\" In addition to being a colonist, he had brief stints as army commander and commissioner to the United States. Austin County is listed in normal font under \"Colonists in Spanish Texas\" and in italics under \"Other Texas Revolution Soldiers\" and \"Republic of Texas officeholders.\"\n\nBrazos County was named for the Brazos River. \"Brazos\" is a Spanish word. Brazos is listed in normal font in the \"Geographic features\" list and in italics under \"Spanish words and names.\"\n\nThe numbers after the group names indicate the number of counties in that group as a primary source, and the total number . For example (2, 8) indicates 2 counties that are in the group as a primary source, and 8 total.\n\nColonists in Spanish Texas (6)\n\nAustin, Bastrop, DeWitt, Edwards, McMullen, Robertson\n\nProminent Mexicans and Officials of New Spain (2, 8)\n\nGoliad, Gonzales, Hidalgo, Leon, San Augustine, Uvalde, Victoria, Zavala\n\nTexans killed at the Alamo (10, 11)\n\nBailey, Bowie, Cochran, Cottle, Crockett, Dickens, Floyd, King, Lynn, Taylor, Travis\n\nOther Texas Revolution soldiers (30, 55)\n\nAndrews, Austin, Bell, Brewster, Briscoe, Brown, Burleson, Caldwell, Coleman, Collingsworth, Cooke, Coryell, Dawson, Deaf Smith, Dimmit, Duval, Eastland, Erath, Fannin, Franklin, Glasscock, Grayson, Hale, Hall, Harrison, Haskel, Hockley, Houston, Jack, Jones, Karnes, Kent, Kimble, Kleberg, Lamar, Lamb, Lubbock, McCulloch, Martin, Maverick, Milam, Mitchell, Motley, Parker, Rusk, Shackelford, Sherman, Smith, Somervell, Swisher, Tom Green, Waller, Ward, Wharton, Williamson\n\nTexas Declaration of Independence signers (3, 23)\n\nBriscoe, Caldwell, Childress, Coleman, Collin, Collingsworth, Houston, Roberts, Ellis, Fisher, Gaines, Grimes, Hardeman, Maverick, Menard, Motley, Navarro, Parmer, Potter, Robertson, Swisher, Waller, Zavala\n\nRepublic of Texas presidents (4)\n\nBurnet, Houston, Jones, Lamar\n\nOther Republic of Texas officeholders (34, 54)\n\nAnderson, Archer, Austin, Bee, Brewster, Burleson, Carson, Collingsworth, Cooke, Ellis, Erath, Fisher, Franklin, Grayson, Grimes, Hall, Hansford, Hardeman, Hemphill, Henderson, Hill, Hockley, Howard, Hudspeth, Hunt, Hutchinson, Irion, Jack, Johnson, Kinney, Lipscomb, Martin, Maverick, Menard, Mills, Morris, Navarro, Ochiltree, Parker, Potter, Rains, Robertson, Rusk, Sherman, Somervell, Starr, Tarrant, Tom Green, Van Zandt, Webb, Wharton, Wheeler, Williamson, Zavala\n\nTexas governors (6, 8)\n\nBell, Coke, Henderson, Houston, Jim Hogg, Roberts, Runnels, Wood\n\nU.S. Congressmen and Senators from Texas (5, 16)\n\nBell, Coke, Culberson, Ector, Hemphill, Henderson, Houston, Howard, Hudspeth, Kaufman, Maverick, Ochiltree, Reagan, Rusk, Schleicher, Scurry\n\nOther state and local officeholders (19, 34)\n\nBrewster, Burnet, Camp, Crosby, Donley, Erath, Gaines, Glasscock, Gray, Grimes, Jim Wells, Kerr, Lipscomb, Montague, Moore, Parker, Rains, Reagan, Real, Reeves, Schleicher, Scurry, Smith, Tarrant, Terrell, Titus, Waller, Ward, Webb, Wheeler, Willacy, Williamson, Wilson, Winkler\n\nTexas Rangers (12, 15)\n\nBaylor, Brooks, Callahan, Eastland, Gillespie, Hays, Johnson, Kendall, Kerr, Lubbock, McCulloch, Robertson, Sutton, Terry, Walker\n\nConfederate soldiers from Texas (9, 13)\n\nEctor, Foard, Gregg, Hood, McCulloch, Reeves, Schleicher, Scurry, Terrell, Tom Green, Upton, Wharton, Winkler\n\nProminent Texas landowners, ranchers, businessmen (6, 8)\n\nBorden, Glasscock, Harris, Kenedy, Maverick, Menard, Montague, Zapata\n\nOther Texans (13, 14)\n\nCameron, Castro, Chambers, Crane, Dallam, Denton, Loving, McLennan, Mason, Oldham, Sterling, Yoakum, Young, Zapata\n\nU.S. Revolutionary War figures (4, 6)\n\nFayette, Jasper, Knox, Marion, Newton, Washington\n\nU.S. presidents (6)\n\nJackson, Jefferson, Madison, Polk, Tyler, Washington\n\nOther U.S. officeholders (9, 13)\n\nCalhoun, Carson, Cass, Clay, Crockett, Houston, Dallas, Jeff Davis, Knox, Lamar, Stephens, Upshur, Wise\n\nOther people (8, 12)\n\nGalveston, Hamilton, La Salle, Lee, Montgomery, Nolan, Randall, San Patricio, San Saba, Shelby, Stonewall, Throckmorton\n\nSiblings and Families (13)\n\nArmstrong, Garza, Hardeman, Hardin, Hartley, Hopkins, Jack, Mitchell, Roberts, Taylor, Upton, Wharton, Wilbarger\n\nGeographic features (27, 29)\n\nAngelina, Aransas, Atascosa, Bandera, Blanco, Bosque, Brazoria, Brazos, Colorado, Comal, Concho, El Paso, Falls, Frio, Guadalupe, Lampasas, Lavaca, Llano, Medina, Nueces, Palo Pinto, Pecos, Red River, Rockwall, Sabine, San Jacinto, San Saba, Trinity, Uvalde\n\nNamed after the county seat (14)\n\nBrazoria, Galveston, Goliad, Gonzales, Liberty, Mason, Midland, Montgomery, Nacogdoches, Refugio, Rockwall, San Augustine, San Patricio, Victoria\n\nEnglish words (6, 12)\n\nDelta, Falls, Fort Bend, Freestone, Liberty, Limestone, Live Oak, Midland, Orange, Red River, Rockwall, Trinity\n\nSpanish words and names (4, 29)\n\nAngelina, Aransas, Atascosa, Bandera, Bexar, Blanco, Bosque, Brazoria, Brazos, Colorado, Comal, Concho, El Paso, Frio, Guadalupe, Lampasas, Lavaca, Llano, Matagorda, Medina, Nueces, Palo Pinto, Pecos, Presidio, Refugio, Sabine, San Jacinto, Val Verde\n\nIndian words and names (4, 5)\n\nCherokee, Comanche, Nacogdoches, Panola, Wichita"
