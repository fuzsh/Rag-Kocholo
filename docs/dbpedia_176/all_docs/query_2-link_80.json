And still I got only 60 correct, and that included a lot of wild guessing. (Let's enter some common last names! What about rivers? What about colors? Plants?)\n\nI'm most unhappy about missing Harris County. I was going through the alphabet trying to remember it, and when I got to H my brain perked upâ€”but I calmed it down again by telling it it was only excited because of the H in Houston.\n\nI'm not sure I'm up for mastering this one!"
