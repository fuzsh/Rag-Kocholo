With a population of 1,990,522, Bexar County is the 4th largest county in Texas and the 16th largest in the country. The area was once occupied by the Coahuiltecans, Tonkawas and Lipan Apaches and was later explored by Europeans in 1691 on an expedition led by Domingo Teran de los Rios. Native Americans referred to the area as Yanaguana, but in celebration of the memorial day of St. Anthony, it was renamed San Antonio. Bexar County is known for its regional medical center, large number of universities and colleges, and tourist attractions (museums, zoo, two large theme parks and The Alamo).\n\nAtascosa\n\nAtascosa County, named after the Atascosa River, is home to 48,981 residents and the county seat is Jourdanton, Texas. It is a major infrastructure hub for Interstate 37, U.S. Highway 281, along with State Highways 16, 85 and 97. Cities in Atascosa County include Charlotte, Jourdanton, Lytle, Pleasanton and Poteet.\n\nMcMullen\n\nMcMullen County has a population of less than 600 residents and the county seat is Tilden, Texas. McMullen County is named after John McMullen, founder of a colony in Texas. Major State Highways include 16 and 72 and communities include Calliham and Tilden.\n\nJim Hogg\n\nJim Hogg County is a new addition to the 28th Congressional District of Texas.

At the heart of the county is the City of Laredo, which served as the capital of the independent Republic of the Rio Grande in 1840. After the Mexican-American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo ceded the land to the United States in 1848. Laredo is one of the oldest border crossing points along the U.S.-Mexico border, and the nation’s largest inland port of entry.\n\nZapata\n\nZapata County hails its name from Colonel Jose Antonio de Zapata, a rancher who rebelled against Mexico in the mid-1800’s dispute between the United States and Mexico for territory in present-day Zapata. The county seat is Zapata, Texas, and about 14,000 people live there as of the 2020 U.S. Census. Infrastructure hubs include U.S. Highway 83 and State Highway 16.
