        "text": "Early Voting Locations\n\nVoting during the early voting period couldn’t be easier and more convenient! Registered and eligible voters may vote at ANY early voting location located in their county of residence. Whether you are at home, work or out running errands, you will be able to find a polling place near you. Early voting locations will be populated in our search site \"My Voter Portal\" two days prior to the first day of early voting. Here, you can enter your Name, County, Date of Birth and ZIP code to look up your registration information and find your nearest polling location. You may want to contact the Early Voting Clerk for State and County Elections in your county for early voting locations. Also, many newspapers publish early voting polling locations.\n\nNote: Polling place hours vary at each early voting location.\n\nElection Day Voting Locations\n\nOn Election Day, if your county participates in the Countywide Polling Place Program (CWPP) – commonly referred to as ‘Vote Centers’ – you can vote at any location in your county of residence. If your county does not participate in the CWPP, you can only vote at the voting precinct assigned to you. Your residence is located in a specific “precinct” or area within the county where you will vote on Election Day. In some cases, precincts may be combined to accommodate joint local elections. *You can find your voting precinct location by using our search site “My Voter Portal,” which will be populated with voting sites two days prior to Election Day. Many newspapers publish Election Day polling locations as well. Election Day voting hours are 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. at all polling places statewide. For questions regarding polling places, always consult your County Elections Office.\n\n*Your voting precinct number (Pct. No.) is located next to your year of birth on your voter registration certificate.\n\nPlease see our FAQ page for more information.\n\nWhat to Expect at the Polling Place\n\nWhen you arrive at the polling place, you will be asked to present one of the seven (7) acceptable forms of photo identification, unless you are a voter with a permanent exemption on your voter registration certificate. If you do not possess a form of acceptable photo identification and you cannot reasonably obtain one, show a supporting form of identification to the election official and execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration. The election official will ask if you have moved and then ask you to sign the list of people who have voted in the precinct. Depending on the type of election – local, statewide, national, or combination – you will be handed:\n\nA paper ballot on which you will select your choices and which will be counted by hand;\n\nA paper ballot on which you will select your choices by darkening an oval, completing an arrow, or “marking” with the aid of a voting machine; or\n\nA slip of paper with a numerical access code or, in some counties, a ballot activator card. In the next available voting booth, enter your code or card and let the on-screen instructions guide you through the process of electronic voting.\n\nIdentification Requirements for Voting\n\nUnder Texas law, voters who possess one of the seven acceptable forms of photo ID must present that ID at the polls when voting in person. Voters who do not possess and cannot reasonably obtain one of the seven approved forms of photo ID may fill out a Reasonable Impediment Declaration (RID) (PDF) at the polls and present an alternative form of ID, such as a utility bill, bank statement, government check, or a voter registration certificate.\n\nHere is a list of the acceptable forms of photo ID:\n\nTexas Driver License issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS)\n\nTexas Election Identification Certificate issued by DPS\n\nTexas Personal Identification Card issued by DPS\n\nTexas Handgun License issued by DPS\n\nUnited States Military Identification Card containing the person’s photograph\n\nUnited States Citizenship Certificate containing the person’s photograph\n\nUnited States Passport (book or card)\n\nWith the exception of the U.S. Citizenship Certificate, which does not expire, for voters aged 18-69, the acceptable form of photo identification may be expired no more than four years before being presented for voter qualification at the polling place. For voters aged 70 or older, the acceptable form of photo identification may be expired for any length of time if the identification is otherwise valid.\n\nElection Identification Certificates are available from DPS driver license offices during regular business hours. Find mobile station locations here.\n\nHere is a list of the supporting forms of ID that can be presented if the voter does not possess one of the forms of acceptable photo ID and cannot reasonably obtain one:\n\ncopy or original of a government document that shows the voter’s name and an address, including the voter’s voter registration certificate;\n\ncopy of or original current utility bill;\n\ncopy of or original bank statement;\n\ncopy of or original government check;\n\ncopy of or original paycheck; or\n\ncopy of or original of (a) a certified domestic (from a U.S. state or territory) birth certificate or (b) a document confirming birth admissible in a court of law which establishes the voter’s identity (which may include a foreign birth document).\n\nAfter presenting one of the forms of supporting ID listed above, the voter must execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration.\n\nProcedures for Voting\n\nWhen a voter arrives at a polling location, the voter will be asked to present one of the seven (7) acceptable forms of photo ID that is current or, for voters aged 18-69, expired no more than four years. Voters aged 70 or older may present one of the seven (7) acceptable forms of photo ID that is expired for any length of time that is otherwise valid. If a voter does not possess one of the seven (7) acceptable forms of photo ID and cannot reasonably obtain one, the voter may present a supporting form of ID and execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration, noting the voter’s reasonable impediment to obtaining an acceptable form of photo identification, stating that the information contained in the declaration is true, that the voter is the same individual personally appearing at the polling place to sign the declaration, and that the voter faces a reasonable impediment to procuring an acceptable form of photo identification.\n\nElection officials are still required by State law to determine whether the voter’s name on the identification provided (acceptable photo ID, or supporting form of ID, if applicable) matches the name on the official list of registered voters (“OLRV”). After a voter presents their ID, whether it’s an acceptable form of photo ID or a supporting form of ID (if applicable), the election worker will compare it to the OLRV. If the name on the ID matches the name on the list of registered voters, the voter will follow the regular procedures for voting.\n\nIf the name does not match exactly but is “substantially similar” to the name on the OLRV, the voter will be permitted to vote as long as the voter signs an affidavit stating that the voter is the same person on the list of registered voters.\n\nIf a voter possesses an acceptable form of photo ID but does not have it at the polling place, the voter will still be permitted to vote provisionally. The voter will have six (6) days to present an acceptable form of photo identification to the county voter registrar, or fill out the natural disaster affidavit referenced in the Exemption/Exceptions section below, or the voter’s ballot will be rejected. Alternatively, a voter who possesses an acceptable form of photo ID but does not have it at the polling place may choose to leave the polling place and return before the close of the polls on election day with said acceptable form of photo ID to, if the voter would otherwise qualify, vote a regular ballot at that time.\n\nExemptions:\n\nVoters with a disability may apply with the county voter registrar for a permanent exemption to presenting an acceptable photo identification or following the Reasonable Impediment Declaration procedure in the county. The application must contain written documentation from either the U.S. Social Security Administration evidencing the applicant’s disability, or from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs evidencing a disability rating of at least 50 percent. The applicant must also state that he/she does not have a form of identification prescribed by Section 63.0101 of the Texas Election Code. Those who obtain a disability exemption will be allowed to vote upon display of their voter registration certificate reflecting the exemption, and will not need to execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration. Please contact your county voter registrar for more details.\n\nVoters who have a consistent religious objection to being photographed or who do not present an acceptable form of photo identification listed above or follow the Reasonable Impediment Declaration procedure because of certain natural disasters as declared by the President of the United States or the Texas Governor, may vote a provisional ballot, appear at the voter registrar’s office within six (6) calendar days after election day, and sign an affidavit swearing to the religious objection or natural disaster, in order for the voter’s ballot to be counted. Please contact your county voter registrar for more details.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat kind of photo identification is required to qualify to vote in person?\n\nThe following is a list of acceptable photo IDs at the polling place:\n\nTexas Driver License issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS)\n\nTexas Election Identification Certificate issued by DPS\n\nTexas Personal Identification Card issued by DPS\n\nTexas Handgun License issued by DPS\n\nUnited States Military Identification Card containing the person’s photograph\n\nUnited States Citizenship Certificate containing the person’s photograph\n\nUnited States Passport (book or card)\n\nWith the exception of the U.S. Citizenship Certificate, which does not expire, for voters aged 18-69, the acceptable form of photo identification may be expired no more than four years before being presented for voter qualification at the polling place. For voters aged 70 or older, the acceptable form of photo identification may be expired for any length of time if the identification is otherwise valid.\n\nMy acceptable photo ID is expired. Will it still work?\n\nWith the exception of the U.S. Citizenship Certificate, which does not expire, for voters aged 18-69, the acceptable photo identification must be current or have expired no more than 4 years before being presented for voter qualification at the polling place. For voters aged 70 or older, the acceptable form of photo identification may be expired for any length of time if the identification is otherwise valid.\n\nWhat if a voter does not have any of the acceptable forms of photo ID?\n\nIf a voter does not possess an acceptable form of photo ID and the voter cannot reasonably obtain such ID, the voter may still cast a regular ballot by presenting a supporting form of ID and executing a Reasonable Impediment Declaration, noting the voter’s reasonable impediment to obtaining an acceptable form of photo identification, stating that the information contained in the declaration is true, that the voter is the same individual personally appearing at the polling place to sign the declaration, and that the voter faces a reasonable impediment to procuring an acceptable form of photo identification.\n\nHere is a list of supporting forms of ID:\n\ncopy or original of a government document that shows the voter’s name and an address, including the voter’s voter registration certificate;\n\ncopy of or original current utility bill;\n\ncopy of or original bank statement;\n\ncopy of or original government check;\n\ncopy of or original paycheck; or\n\ncopy of or original of (a) a certified domestic (from a U.S. state or territory) birth certificate or (b) a document confirming birth admissible in a court of law which establishes the voter’s identity (which may include a foreign birth document).\n\nVoters with a disability may apply with the county voter registrar for a permanent exemption to presenting an acceptable photo identification or following the Reasonable Impediment Declaration procedure in the county. The application must contain written documentation from either the U.S. Social Security Administration evidencing the applicant’s disability, or from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs evidencing a disability rating of at least 50 percent. The applicant must also state that he/she does not have a form of identification prescribed by Section 63.0101 of the Texas Election Code. Those who obtain a disability exemption will be allowed to vote upon display of their voter registration certificate reflecting the exemption, and will not need to execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration.\n\nIf a voter states that they (a) do not possess an acceptable form of photo identification listed above, and the voter can reasonably obtain one of these acceptable forms of identification or (b) possesses, but did not bring to the polling place, one of the seven forms of acceptable photo identification listed above, the voter may cast a provisional ballot at the polls. However, in order to have the provisional ballot counted, the voter will be required to visit the voter registrar’s office within six calendar days of the date of the election to present one of the above forms of photo ID; OR, if applicable, submit one of the temporary affidavits addressed in these FAQs (e.g., religious objection or natural disaster); OR, if applicable, qualify for the disability exemption addressed in these FAQs, in the presence of the county voter registrar. Alternatively, the voter may choose to leave the polling place and return before the close of the polls on election day with an acceptable form of photo ID to, if they otherwise qualify, vote a regular ballot at that time.\n\nVoters who have a consistent religious objection to being photographed or who do not present an acceptable form of photo identification listed above or follow the Reasonable Impediment Declaration procedure because of certain natural disasters as declared by the President of the United States or the Texas Governor, may vote a provisional ballot, appear at the voter registrar’s office within six (6) calendar days after election day, and sign an affidavit swearing to the religious objection or natural disaster, in order for the voter’s ballot to be counted. Please contact your county voter registrar for more details.\n\nWhat is a reasonable impediment?\n\nReasonable impediments identified on the Reasonable Impediment Declaration are: lack of transportation, disability or illness, lack of birth certificate or other documents needed to obtain acceptable photo ID, work schedule, family responsibilities, lost or stolen ID, or acceptable form of photo ID applied for but not received. You must qualify for one of these reasonable impediments in order to execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration. A person is subject to prosecution for perjury under Chapter 37, Penal Code, or Section 63.0013 of the Texas Election Code for providing a false statement or false information on a Reasonable Impediment Declaration.\n\nWhat if a voter does not have any form of ID with them at the polling place and they do not have a disability exemption when they visit the polling place?\n\nIf a voter does not possess an acceptable form of photo ID, cannot reasonably obtain one, and does not have or does not bring a supporting form of ID to present in connection with a Reasonable Impediment Declaration, or if the voter does not possess an acceptable form of photo ID and can reasonably obtain an acceptable form of photo ID, or if the voter possesses, but did not bring with them, an acceptable form of photo ID, the voter may cast a provisional ballot at the polls. However, in order to have the provisional ballot counted the voter will be required to visit the county voter registrar’s office within six calendar days of the date of the election to present an acceptable form of photo ID; OR, if the voter does not possess and cannot reasonably obtain an acceptable form of photo ID, follow the Reasonable Impediment Declaration procedure; OR, if applicable, submit one of the temporary affidavits addressed in these FAQs (religious objection or natural disaster) in the presence of the county voter registrar; OR, if applicable, qualify for the disability exemption addressed in these FAQs with the county voter registrar.\n\nAlternatively, a voter who possesses an acceptable form of photo ID but does not have it at the polling place, or a voter who does not possess an acceptable form of photo ID, and is reasonably able to obtain one, may choose to leave the polling place and return before the close of the polls on election day with an acceptable form of photo ID to vote a regular ballot at that time. In addition, a voter who does not possess, would otherwise not be able to reasonably obtain an acceptable form of photo ID, but did not bring a supporting form of ID to the polling place, may choose to leave the polling place and return before the close of the polls on election day with said supporting form of ID to fill out the Reasonable Impediment Declaration and, if they otherwise qualify, vote a regular ballot at that time.\n\nWhat if my acceptable form of photo ID was lost, stolen, suspended, revoked or is expired more than four years?\n\nA voter whose photo identification has been lost, stolen, suspended, revoked or, for voters aged 18-69, expired more than four years does not possess one of the acceptable forms of photo ID, and, if the voter cannot reasonably obtain a replacement of the identification that was lost, stolen, suspended, revoked or expired or another form of acceptable photo ID, the voter is eligible to present a supporting form of ID, execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration, and, assuming they otherwise qualify, vote a regular ballot.\n\nMy name on my approved photo ID or my supporting ID (if applicable) does not exactly match my name on my voter registration card. Can I still vote?\n\nElection officials will review the ID and if a name is “substantially similar” to the name on their list of registered voters, you will still be able to vote, but you will also have to submit an affidavit stating that you are the same person on the list of registered voters.\n\nWhat does “substantially similar” mean?\n\nA voter’s name is considered substantially similar if one or more of the following circumstances applies:\n\nThe name on the ID is slightly different from one or more of the name fields on the official list of registered voters.\n\nThe name on the voter’s ID or on the list of registered voters is a customary variation of the voter’s formal name. For example, Bill for William\n\nThe voter’s name contains an initial, middle name, or former name that is either not on the official list of registered voters or on the voter’s ID.\n\nA first name, middle name, former name or initial of the voter’s name occupies a different field on the presented ID document than it does on the list of registered voters.\n\nIn considering whether a name is substantially similar, election officials will also look at whether information on the presented ID matches elements of the voter’s information on the official list of registered voters such as the voter’s residence address or date of birth.\n\nIs the DPS Election Identification Certificate still going to be available?\n\nYes. The Election Identification Certificate is now available, and will be still be a form of acceptable photo ID. Information regarding how to obtain an election identification certificate can be found at www.dps.texas.gov. You may also contact DPS by telephone at (512) 424-2600 for more information.\n\nShould you need additional information, please contact our office via telephone at 1-800-252-VOTE (8683) or email us.\n\nThe vast majority of Texans will cast their ballots on electronic voting machines – many of which are part of a hybrid voting system that produces a paper record that voters can review and verify before officially casting their ballot.\n\nVoting systems in Texas are never connected to the internet, and cannot even have the capability of connecting to the internet in order to be certified for use in Texas elections.\n\nMany counties utilize e-Pollbooks for checking in registered voters when they enter the polling place. These devices are connected to the internet so that they can communicate with one another and ensure that no registered voter can vote more than once in any given election. The official list of registered voters in each county is backed up and secured through layers of cybersecurity to ensure malicious cyber actors are not able to access or alter voter information.\n\nFor more information, please visit the Texas Secretary of State’s Election Security Update on how local and state officials work year-round to ensure your vote is safe and secure.\n\nVoting Methods\n\nTexas uses a few different methods of voting. Texans cast their votes by paper ballot (which is counted either by hand or by using an optical scan system) or by using a Direct Recording Electronic system (DRE).\n\nWhen using a paper ballot, voters will either hand-mark their paper ballot or use an electronic ballot marking device that allows them to make their selections electronically and then prints a paper ballot containing those selections. The paper ballot will then be hand-counted or will be counted using an optical scan system. When using a DRE, the voter will make their selections electronically on the system and the system will record those selections electronically on the system.\n\nDREs and electronic ballot marking devices also allow for the connection of an audio/headphone attachment, simple touch devices, or a sip and puff tube that enables the blind, elderly, individuals with physical disabilities, and non-reading Texans to vote independently and in private.\n\nThe type of system on which you vote is decided by the political subdivision (county, city, school district, etc.) in which you live. Depending on where you live, you may also use a different system for early voting than on Election Day. Here’s a brief summary regarding the different voting methods:\n\nHand-marked paper ballots are still used as the primary way of voting in a number of Texas counties. Voters mark their ballot by hand with an indelible marker (a marker that cannot be erased) or pen and place their finished ballot in a ballot box. Local election officials then count the votes by hand.\n\nBallot marking devices are electronic devices that allow the voters to make their selections electronically on the device, and print a ballot that contains those selections. The printed ballot is then placed into a ballot box for hand counting or into an optical scan system for automatic counting.\n\nOptical scan voting systems enable voters to mark their choices either on pre-printed ballots by connecting “arrows” or filling in “bubbles” next to the candidates’ names, or on electronic ballot marking devices by making their selections electronically on the device and printing a ballot containing those selections from that device. The paper ballot is then inserted into an electronic ballot counter, which then counts the marked “bubbles” or “arrows” on each ballot and automatically computes the totals for each candidate and/or issue.\n\nDREs (Direct Recording Electronic systems) enable voters to record their choices electronically directly into the machine. There are several types of DREs (some have a dial while others use a touch screen), but essentially they all enable voters to move back and forth between screens (ballot pages) to select the candidates and/or issues for whom they wish to vote. Once a voter has made his or her choices, the DRE provides a summary screen that presents those choices and gives the voter the ability to go back and make any changes before pressing the “Vote” or “Cast Ballot” button. One of the benefits of a DRE system is that it prevents “over-voting”; that is, it stops the voter from selecting two candidates or options in a race where only one is allowed. As well, a DRE gives the voter an opportunity to correct “under-voting,” or failing to select any candidate or option in a race.\n\nEach polling place in Texas must offer at least one accessible voting system (either a DRE or an electronic ballot marking device), with the limited exception of sparsely populated jurisdictions conducting non-federal elections.\n\nIn Texas, you’ll vote on one of these systems.\n\nThe State of Texas has certified voting systems from two different vendors: Election Systems & Software (ES&S) and Hart InterCivic. Regardless of the system you’re using, know this: When voting in the Lone Star State, you count. Texas makes sure. Following are the voting systems certified for use in Texas. (You can click on the name of each voting system for more information about that system.)\n\nFrom Election Systems & Software:\n\nES&S ExpressVote, an electronic ballot marking device that produces an auditable paper record\n\nES&S DS200, an optical scan voting system\n\niVotronic, a DRE voting system\n\nES&S Model 100, an optical scan voting system\n\nES&S AutoMARK, a machine that also assists disabled voters to mark a paper ballot\n\nFrom Hart InterCivic:\n\nVerity Duo, an electronic ballot marking device that produces an auditable paper record\n\nVerity Touch Writer, an electronic ballot marking device that produces an auditable paper record\n\nVerity Touch, a DRE voting system\n\n\"Verity Scan, an optical scan voting system\n\neSlate, a DRE voting system\n\neScan, an optical scan voting system\n\nStep-by-step instructions for using:\n\nPaper ballot\n\nOptical scan voting system\n\nES&S ExpressVote (PDF)\n\nES&S DS200 (PDF)\n\nES&S AutoMARK\n\nES&S iVotronic\n\nHart Intercivic Verity Duo (PDF)\n\nHart Intercivic Verity Touch Writer (PDF)\n\nHart Intercivic Verity Touch (PDF)\n\nHart Intercivic Verity Scan (PDF)\n\nHart InterCivic eSlate\n\nIf you need assistance at the polls, tell the election official if you are a voter who needs help to vote. You do not have to provide proof of your disability. For guidance on which voters are eligible to receive assistance at the polling place, please see Section 208 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) which provides for voters who need assistance to vote by reason of blindness, disability, or inability to read or write.\n\nVoters may be assisted by:\n\nAny person the voter chooses who is not an election worker;\n\nTwo election workers on Election Day; or\n\nOne election worker during early voting.\n\nVoters MAY NOT be assisted by:\n\nTheir employer;\n\nAn agent of their employer; or\n\nAn officer or agent of their union.\n\nThe person assisting the voter must read him or her the entire ballot, unless the voter asks to have only parts of the ballot read. The person assisting the voter must take an oath that he or she will not try to influence the voter’s vote and will mark the ballot as the voter directs. If the voter chooses to be assisted by polling place officials, poll watchers and election inspectors may observe the voting process, but if the voter asks to be assisted by a person the voter chooses, no one else may watch him or her vote.\n\nIt is illegal for a person assisting the voter to:\n\nTry to influence the voter’s vote;\n\nMark the voter’s ballot in a way other than the way they have asked; or\n\nTell anyone how the voter voted.\n\nVoters May Use Interpreters at the Polls\n\nVoters who cannot speak English, or who communicate only with sign language, may use an interpreter to help them communicate with election officials, regardless of whether the election official(s) attending to the voter can speak the same language as the voter. The voter may select any person other than the voter’s employer, an agent of the voter’s employer, or an officer or agent of a labor union to which the voter belongs. If the voter cannot read the languages on the ballot, the interpreter may also act as an assistant for the voter, but they must follow the procedures for an assistant. (See assistance section above for more details.) If the voter is deaf and does not have a sign language interpreter who can accompany them to help communicate with the poll worker or read the ballot, the voter should contact his or her local election officials before the election and request assistance."
