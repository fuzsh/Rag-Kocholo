        "text": "History\n\nOn October 1, 2011, the Marfa Border Patrol Sector was officially renamed the Big Bend Border Patrol Sector, to better reflect the area of responsibility of the Sector. The Big Bend Sector is strategically located across the northward route of travel from the area of northern Chihuahua and Coahuila, Mexico, inland to the agricultural areas of West Texas. The town of Marfa, Texas, is located on U.S. Highway 67, the principal highway leading from the Class A Port of Entry at Presidio.\n\nLike the area in which it is situated, the Big Bend Sector has grown extensively during its history. Beginning as a loosely organized group of out stations, many with no office and little equipment, it is now a well organized and highly mobile enforcement organization, closely integrated with other sectors throughout the United States.\n\nArea of Responsibility\n\nThe Big Bend Sector is composed of 77 Texas counties and all of the State of Oklahoma (78 counties). The operational area is 165,154 square miles. The Sector is responsible for patrolling 517 miles of river front along the Rio Grande River which is the international boundary between the United States and Mexico. The Sector's border boundary is almost one-quarter of the country's Southwest Border.\n\nService Area: The Big Bend Sector covers over 135,000 square miles encompassing over 118 counties in Texas and Oklahoma. Big Bend Sector is responsible for the largest geographical area of any sector along the Southwest border. Border Patrol agents in the Big Bend Sector are responsible for over 510 miles of river border.\n\nSector Headquarters Location: 300 Madrid Street, Marfa, Texas\n\nStations: Stations of the Big Bend Sector are located in Sierra Blanca, Van Horn, Marfa, Presidio, Alpine and Sanderson, and our interior stations are Ft. Stockton and Lubbock.\n\nContact Information: Phone Number - (432) 729-5200, or 1-888-536-6204; Sector Headquarters Mailing Address - Big Bend Border Patrol Sector, P.O.
