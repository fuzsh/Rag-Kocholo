        "text": "There was a substantial undercount of children in the 2020 U.S. Census and particularly in Texas. Based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s Demographic Analysis, the net undercount of children in the U.S. Census increased from 1.7% in 2010 to 2.1% in 2020. The net undercount of children contrasts with a 0.2% overcount for adults. While these national numbers are informative, state and local data from the decennial census is critical to gain a constructive understanding of the issue. However, little is known about undercounting children at the county level. To inform this issue, we estimated the Texas net child undercount at the county level and studied its spatial distribution using data from the 2020 Census and the Vintage 2020 population estimates. This study builds on the work of Dr. William P. O’Hare, who finds Texas had more counties with high net undercounts of children than any other state (either in number or rate terms).\n\nThe net undercount of children (aged 0 to 17) in the U.S. Census is high and has grown in recent decades. Based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s Demographic Analysis (DA), the net undercount of children in the U.S. Census increased from 1.7% in 2010 to 2.1% in 2020. The 2.1% net undercount of children in the 2020 Census contrasts with a 0.2% overcount for adults. An overcount exists when the census results are higher than the population estimated by another source. This pattern is consistent with the 2010 Census, when children had a net undercount, and adults had a net overcount.1\n\nWhile these national numbers are informative, local data from the decennial census are critical because the decennial census is one of the few sources of relatively comparable data for all communities in the nation. In many ways, the decennial census is the bedrock of our national statistical system. The decennial census has many uses.2,3 Including:\n\nTherefore, local census information is important, in part, because state and county data are used in many of the formulas to allocate federal funding for 353 federal programs that distributed more than $2.8 trillion in federal funds in Fiscal Year 2021.4 Furthermore, in a similar exercise for 2017, Andrew Reamer found that about two-thirds of the formulas use substate geographic units, making county data especially important.5\n\nThis study employs a commonly used demographic benchmark to identify counties with high net undercounts of children in the 2020 Census. Specifically, the county-level children estimate from the Vintage 2020 population estimates is compared to its corresponding figure from the 2020 Census.6,7 The Vintage 2020 population estimates are calculated using the 2010 Census results as a base and adding births, deaths, and net migration between 2010 and 2020.\n\nThis study builds on the work of William P. O’Hare, who finds Texas had more counties with high net undercounts of children than any other state (either in number or rate terms).8 In doing so, this brief presents the net child undercount estimates for all Texas counties, not only for those with the highest numbers and rates. Hence it includes estimates for the net child undercount rates and net child undercount numeric size in each county. It is worth noting that the net undercount is not the same as the number of people missed in the census. The net undercount includes people missed as well as people double counted. In 2010, the total number of children missed was about double the size of the net undercount, so this distinction is significant.9 In this paper, net undercount is sometimes called “undercount” for simplicity.\n\nIn sum, this paper’s contribution is twofold. First, it makes child undercount data for Texas counties easily available to the public. Second, it explores the Texas net child undercount in its twelve regions (Alamo, Capital, Central Texas, Gulf Coast, High Plains, Metroplex, Northwest, South Texas, Southeast, Upper East, Upper Rio Grande, and West Texas), which are regions created by the Texas Comptroller (see more details at comptroller.texas.gov).\n\nWe use two 2020 county-level products of the U.S. Census Bureau with data on children: the Vintage 2020 population estimates and the 2020 Census. At the time this analysis was conducted, the only data on children from the 2020 Census was the population ages 0 to 17. Undercounted children are estimated by subtracting the population estimates from the census count. There are two reasons to believe the population estimates are more accurate than the census count. First, the 2020 census count had a high net undercount of children. Second, the population estimates for children are based largely on birth certificate data which is quite accurate.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau provides annual population and housing estimates through its Population Estimates Program. The version of the Vintage estimates used here is that of April 2020. As per its methodological approach, it is a simplified version of the U.S. Census Bureau’s Demographic Analysis. On the other hand, the county-level estimates from the 2020 Census come from the 1975 Public Law 94-171, which “…directs the U.S. Census Bureau to make special preparations to provide redistricting data needed by the 50 states.”7 In particular, “Required by law, the Redistricting Data Program provides states the opportunity to specify the small geographic areas for which they wish to receive decennial population totals for the purpose of reapportionment and redistricting”10.\n\nThis paper follows O’Hare’s approach to estimating child undercounts at the county level. In a few words, the net child undercount is the difference between the 2020 Census and the Vintage estimates children count as a percentage of the Vintage estimates’ child count. When the 2020 Census is smaller than the Vintage 2020 estimates, we observe an undercount (expressed with a negative undercount estimate), and when the 2020 Census is higher than the Vintage 2020 estimates, we observe an overcount (with a positive undercount estimate). Then, net child undercounts are reflected with negative values and net child overcounts are reflected in positive values.\n\nThe net undercount of children (age 0 to 17) in the U.S. Census is high and has been growing in recent decades. This study provides a detailed analysis of child undercounts at the county and regional level in Texas and explores its regional patterns. These results can serve as a roadmap for deeper analysis.\n\nCensus-related data is used to determine the distribution of funding for 350+ federal programs, totaling more than $2.8 trillion each year. Counties with an undercount will not receive the full federal funding they are entitled to, impacting budgets for things like schools, health centers, and childcare centers. Furthermore, counties with an undercount will not have accurate data for future planning.\n\nTo address the impact of an undercount, leaders may want to explore ways to compensate counties that experience a high undercount of children. Similarly, leaders in counties with a high undercount of children may want to work with the Census Bureau to look for additional ways to correct the undercount of children in future censuses. The results shown here can be used to start building a targeted approach to increasing the count accuracy of children in the 2030 Census.\n\nAcknowledgements: The authors appreciate the insightful support provided by Helen You, Deborah Stein, and Monica Cruz."
