        "text": "Each of the 254 Texas counties has a county number (also known as a county ID) assigned sequentially in alphabetical order. This is not the order in which most computer programs and spreadsheets would sort counties by name. For example, Ellis County is numbered before El Paso, and the counties that start with \"Mc\" are numbered before all other counties that start with \"M\". If you sort a list of Texas counties by county name, the counties will not be in order by county number.\n\nThe county FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) code is assigned by the US Census Bureau. Texas has a state FIPS code of 48 so all Texas counties have a county FIPS code of 48xxx. The county FIPS code can be calculated from the Texas county number: FIPS_code = 48000 + (county_number * 2) - 1. Some state agencies in Texas employ practices different from the FIPS standard to order county statistics.\n\nMany Texas county names have a variety of spellings. For this reason, you should avoid using the county name to match or join two tables of county data, particularly if they are from different sources. We recommend using the county number or FIPS code as the basis for the match or join. Do not assume that two tables with Texas county data that look like they are both in alphabetical order are actually arranged in the same order.\n\nEach Texas county is assigned to one of 11 public health regions. However, for administrative purposes, there are 8 regional public health offices. Regions 2 and 3 are administered from a regional office in Arlington. Region 4 and the northern part of Region 5 are administered from a regional office in Tyler. Region 6 and the southern part of Region 5 are administered from a regional office in Houston. Regions 9 and 10 are administered from a regional office in El Paso. Of the counties in Region 5, three are in Region 5S: Hardin, Jefferson, and Orange. The rest of the Region 5 counties are in Region 5N."
