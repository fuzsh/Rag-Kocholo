        "text": "A caregiver is a constantly evolving role that an individual most likely undertakes at some point in their lifetime. With discoveries and research in increasing life expectancy, the prevalence of neurological-related diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dementia, is certainly likely to require more caregivers. The demand for AD caregivers is escalating as the prevalence of the disease continues to rise. The projected rise in AD within the Hispanic population in the United States over the next few decades is expected to be the most significant among all ethnic groups. The Hispanic population faces unique dementia risks due to cultural factors like language barriers, lower education, and limited healthcare access. Higher rates of conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease further elevate dementia risk. Family dynamics and caregiving responsibilities also differ, affecting dementia management within Hispanic households. Addressing these distinct challenges requires culturally sensitive approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and support for Hispanic individuals and their family’s facing dementia. With AD and other dementia becoming more prevalent, this article will attempt to expand upon the status of caregivers concerning their economic, health, and cultural statuses. We will attempt to focus on the Hispanic caregivers that live in Texas and more specifically, West Texas due to the lack of current literature that applies to this area of Texas. Lastly, we discuss the ramifications of a multitude of factors that affect caregivers in Texas and attempt to provide tools that can be readily available for Hispanics and others alike.\n\nOur commentary aims to elucidate the importance of participant recruitment strategy in healthy brain aging study, particularly in rural West Texas, where more than 50% of the population are Hispanics and Latinos. The objective of our health aging study is to investigate the possible influence of biological, sociodemographic, and lifestyle factors on the occurrence of chronic diseases and dementia in the aging populations of West Texas. The success of this initiative is, in large part, reliant on high-quality, effective recruitment of participants. To that end, we propose an increase in our strategic recruitment efforts for both healthy, cognitively superior agers as well as those with mild cognitive impairment and patients with Alzheimer's disease in rural west Texas. We discussed, multi-advertising approaches, including ads in the local newspapers, local TV Channels and poster boards in senior centers.\n\nObjective To determine associations between Vitamin D (VD) levels and clinical depression through the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and its questions and subdomains, stratified by demographics and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (HLE). Design, setting, and participants A cohort of 299 Project FRONTIER participants aged 62.6 ± 11.7 years old, 70.9% female, and 40.5% HLE were used. Standard correlation and regression analyses were employed. Measurements The main outcome measures were VD (serum 25(OH)-VD) level, GDS-30 (30-item questionnaire), GDS-30 subfactors and questions, and HLE status. VD categories were defined as VD deficiency (VDD; ≤20 ng/mL), VD insufficiency (VDI; 21–29 ng/mL), VD sufficiency (30–38 ng/mL) and high VD sufficiency (>38 ng/mL). Results The majority (61.5%) of samples fell into VDD/VDI categories. A significant negative association was found between VD level and GDS-30 total score. VD level was negatively correlated with Dysphoria and Meaninglessness GDS-30 subfactors. Although GDS subfactors were similar between HLE and non-HLE groups, VD levels were significantly lower in HLE samples. Finally, HLE/non-HLE groups were differentially stratified across VD categories. Only 4% of HLEs fell into the high VD sufficient category, suggesting low VD supplementation. Conclusion A significant negative association between VD level and depressive symptoms was revealed in our aging Project FRONTIER participants. HLE individuals were overrepresented in VDD/VDI samples, and VDD/VDI was associated primarily with the Dysphoria GDS subdomain. Regression analysis predicted high VD sufficiency (95.5 ng/mL) to be associated with no depressive symptoms (GDS=0). Our results underscore troubling disparities in VD-related depressive symptoms between HLE and non-HLE populations.\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases are a group of pathologies that cause severe disability due to motor and cognitive limitations. In particular, cognitive impairment is a growing health and socioeconomic problem which is still difficult to deal with today. As there are no pharmacologically effective treatments for cognitive deficits, scientific interest is growing regarding the possible impacts of healthy lifestyles on them. In this context, physical activity is gaining more and more evidence as a primary prevention intervention, a nonpharmacological therapy and a rehabilitation tool for improving cognitive functions in neurodegenerative diseases. In this descriptive overview we highlight the neurobiological effects of physical exercise, which is able to promote neuroplasticity and neuroprotection by acting at the cytokine and hormonal level, and the consequent positive clinical effects on patients suffering from cognitive impairment.\n\nAlzheimer’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s disease-related disorders (ADRD) are late-onset, age-related progressive neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by memory loss and multiple cognitive impairments. Current research indicates that Hispanic Americans are at an increased risk for AD/ADRD and other chronic conditions such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and kidney disease, and given their rapid growth in numbers, this may contribute to a greater incidence of these disorders. This is particularly true for the state of Texas, where Hispanics are the largest group of ethnic minorities. Currently, AD/ADRD patients are taken care by family caregivers, which puts a tremendous burden on family caregivers who are usually older themselves. The management of disease and providing necessary/timely support for patients with AD/ADRD is a challenging task. Family caregivers support these individuals in completing basic physical needs, maintaining a safe living environment, and providing necessary planning for healthcare needs and end-of-life decisions for the remainder of the patient’s lifetime. Family caregivers are mostly over 50 years of age and provide all-day care for individuals with AD/ADRD, while also managing their health. This takes a significant toll on the caregiver’s own physiological, mental, behavioral, and social health, in addition to low economic status. The purpose of our article is to assess the status of Hispanic caregivers. We also focused on effective interventions for family caregivers of persons with AD/ADRD involving both educational and psychotherapeutic components, and a group format further enhances effectiveness. Our article discusses innovative methods and validations to support Hispanic family caregivers in rural West Texas.\n\nAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating illness in elderly individuals, that currently has no known cure. Causal genetic factors only account for 1-2% of AD patients. However, other causal factors are still unknown for a majority of AD patients. Currently, multiple factors are implicated in late-onset AD, including unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, traumatic brain injury, chronic conditions, epigenetic factors, and environmental exposures. Although clinical symptoms of dementia are common to all races and ethnic groups, conditions that lead to dementia are different in terms of lifestyle, genetic profile, and socio-economic conditions. Increasing evidence also suggests that some elderly individuals age without cognitive impairments in their 60–90s as seen in rural West Texas, while some individuals progress with chronic conditions and cognitive impairments into their 60s. To understand these discriminations, we assessed current literature on demographic features of health in rural West Texas. This paper also outlines our initiated clinical study with a purpose of understanding the factors that allow some individuals to live without cognitive impairments at the age of 60–90 years, whereas others develop deficits in cognitive function around or above 60 years. Our ongoing study hopes to determine the factors that delay aging in some individuals by investigating various aspects including genetics, epigenetics, ethnicity, biology, culture, and lifestyle. This will be achieved by gathering information about participants’ ethnographic profiles, cognitive assessments, blood-profiles, brain scans, and blood-based genomic analyses in relation to lifestyle. The outcomes of our study will provide insights into healthy aging in rural West Texas."
