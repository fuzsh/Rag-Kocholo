        "text": "This state judiciary article needs to be updated.\n\nTexas County Courts are trial courts in Texas with concurrent jurisdiction over many cases with the district courts.\n\nCourts by county\n\nSee List of Texas counties\n\nand List of Texas District Courts\n\nCounty courts\n\nConstitutional courts\n\nEach of the 254 counties in Texas has a single Constitutionally granted county court, presided over by a single county judge.[1]\n\nCounty courts at law\n\nSince each county is Constitutionally limited to a single county court and judge, the Texas Legislature created statutory county courts at law for the counties with larger populations. Each of the county courts at law was established by an individual statute, and thus vary widely in scope. However, the \"jurisdiction of statutorily-created county courts at law is usually concurrent with the jurisdiction of the county and district courts in the county\".[1]\n\nProbate courts\n\nIn most of Texas the county constitutional court has original jurisdiction over probate matters. In a few counties however, the Legislature has statutorily created probate courts \"so that a county court at law will have concurrent jurisdiction over probate matters with the constitutional county court\". These are located in 10 out of the state's 15 largest metropolitan areas.[2]\n\nOther county courts\n\nDallas County has a County Court of Criminal Appeals\n\nThe counties of Dallas, El Paso and Tarrant each have a county criminal court.\n\nThe counties of Dallas, El Paso, Jefferson and Tarrant each have a criminal district court.\n\nSee also\n\nCourts in Texas\n\nTexas counties"
