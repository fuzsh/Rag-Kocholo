Academic environment in our college is unparallel.\n\nNow we would like to brief our college before you:-\n\nThis college was named after the medieval poet of Humanity, Chandidas. It was founded in 1972 at the village of Khujutipara under Nanoor police station in the district of Birbhum with a motto of imparting higher education to the rural youth.\n\nIt grew out of the long-standing desire and struggle of the people of this underdeveloped area for higher education. It was almost impossible for the local students, coming largely from economically and socially backward classes, to attend the college either at Bolpur or Katwa. Realising their plight and aspiration for higher education, some educationists struggled hard to establish this college, defying all odds, mostly financial. The sapling they planted has now branched out in many directions, now blossoming forth with colours and fragrance.\n\nThe college has since its inception steadily evolved in terms of its human and infrastructural resources. It is affiliated to the University of Burdwan. It breathes natural air of human relations among students and the staff beyond the boundary that prides in it. The college has been accredited by NAAC in 2011, 2016 & 2023.\n\nThis College facilitates you to take-up your desired courses to cope with the changing academic scenario in different streams- Arts, Science and Commerce. The wing of NCC, NSS, Games & Sports and Cultural activities oversees and coordinates your entire Co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. Career counselling and Placement cell is also ready to provide you added advantage alongside your academic pursuit. Recently we introduce mentor system to help you grow in regards to your academic, personal and social life. College is going to open up some job oriented courses free of cost with the technical assistance of and affiliation to NSDC (National Skill Development Corporation). Separate common rooms for boys and girls for leisure period. Very soon Multi gym facilities will be a reality for you. Indoor game facilities are available to realize your sports-talents. Rich and sophisticated canteen is ready to relish your taste buds.\n\nIt’s our firm belief that each of you will be able a confident and successful one if you utilize the campus facilities fully.\n\nThere are some stipulation and cautionary notes in the form of Dos and Don’ts in the E-prospectus available in our college website to make you a responsible student. Hence you are advised to go through those rules and expect that you will comply with them.\n\nWe are ready to clarify your every doubt. Hence our advice to you to contact us for any kind of assistance of clarification.\n\nWe regard the students as our heart and soul.
