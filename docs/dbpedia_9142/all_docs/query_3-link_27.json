        "text": "People and Culture\n\nThe population of France surpassed 60 million in the early 21st century. By far the most populated French régions are Île-de-France (Paris region) and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes in southeast-central France. Other densely populated areas are the industrial cities of Lorraine; isolated large cities, such as Toulouse; and certain small-farm areas, such as coastal Brittany, Flanders, and Alsace.\n\nBecause France is large and, by European standards, sparsely populated, it has historically been able to absorb most of its population gains. As a result, France has not lost as many people to emigration as have other European countries. In the 17th century, however, religious persecution led to a mass emigration of roughly 400,000 French Protestants, or Huguenots. Small numbers of people emigrated to the newly forming French colonies in the New World, notably in the regions that comprise modern-day Quebec and Louisiana in North America and Martinique and French Guiana in Latin America. Emigration, particularly to Canada, continues, though on a small scale.\n\nImmigration into France began to rise in the mid-19th century. In the early 20th century France was considered to be more open to immigrants than any other European country. This reputation led to an influx of immigrants, particularly political refugees. Between the two world wars, roughly 6 percent of the country’s residents were foreign-born. In the two decades after World War II the continued flow of refugees and other immigrants accounted for 40 percent of France’s population growth. In the 1970s, as French workers competed with immigrants for jobs, the government began to restrict immigration, a policy that remained in force in the early 21st century. Historically, most of France’s immigrants came from neighboring countries such as Portugal, Italy, and Spain. More recently, however, an increasing number have arrived from North Africa and French territories and former territories in Central Africa, Asia, and the Americas.\n\nEthnic Groups\n\nThough the French take great pride in belonging to a single nation, they hardly constitute a unified ethnic group. For centuries before Europeans learned of the Americas in the late 15th century, France was thought to be near the edge of the known world. Generations of different migrants traveling by way of the Mediterranean from the Middle East and Africa and through Europe from central Asia and northern Europe settled permanently in France.\n\nThese migrations have all contributed to the ethnic composition of France. Perhaps the oldest reflection of the migrations is the Basque people, who live in an isolated area west of the Pyrenees in both Spain and France. They speak a language unrelated to other European languages and whose origin remains unclear. The Celtic tribes, known to the Romans as Gauls, spread from central Europe in the period 500 bc–ad 500. They provided France with a major component of its population, especially in the center and west. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Germanic (Teutonic) peoples spread through France, especially in the north and east. Vikings brought further Germanic influence. In addition to these many migrations, France was, over the centuries, the field of numerous battles and of prolonged occupations. Immigration in the 19th and especially in the 20th century and early 21st century contributed to the ethnic mix.\n\nLanguages\n\nFrench is one of the world’s most widely spoken languages. In addition to its general use in France, it is the native tongue in seven cantons, or states, of Switzerland as well as in Luxembourg, Monaco, and the southern half of Belgium. Outside of Europe the language continues to be widely used wherever the French colonial influence was once prevalent—for example, in the Canadian province of Quebec and in Haiti. French is also commonly heard in North and West Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. It is one of the official languages of the United Nations and is used at many international conferences as well as in numerous scientific and cultural publications. No other language except English is so widely studied as a second language. The wide use of French and English is out of all proportion to the number of people who speak those languages as their native language.\n\nAs a country formed from a patchwork of individual cultures, France has many linguistic minorities representing various backgrounds. In Brittany, Breton is commonly used. The only living Celtic language outside of Great Britain, it was originally brought to France by Celts fleeing Anglo-Saxon pressure in southern England during the 5th and 7th centuries. In northeastern France, German-speaking people live in the French portion of the region called the Saar. A more distinctive tongue is spoken in Alsace, where German language roots are combined with French additions. Italian is spoken in places along the French-Italian border. Numerous remnants of Latin-based languages from Roman times are heard along the Mediterranean. These include Occitan, also called Langue d’Oc, and Provençal, which is spoken in southern France. The Corsican dialect, used on the island of Corsica, also evolved from Latin during the Middle Ages. In the western Pyrenees, the Basque language is spoken. Recent immigration has introduced various non-European languages, notably Arabic.\n\nReligions\n\nReligious observance plays an important part in the lives of many French people, but the importance of religion in national life has diminished through the years, as it has in most European countries. Roman Catholicism has long been the predominant religion in France. The powers of church and state were closely related under the monarchy. Powerful cardinals, such as Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin, served as the king’s principal ministers. Except for a period of tolerance under the Edict of Nantes, which was issued in 1598 and revoked in 1685, France was bitterly hostile to Protestants. Indeed, many of the bloodiest periods of French history involved the wars of religion that ravaged Europe for over a century. (See also Reformation.)\n\nIn the decade following the climax of the French Revolution in 1789, measures were taken to reduce the power of the church and to separate religious and civil authority. Religious freedom was granted in 1795. Roman Catholicism remains the major religion in France, but most Protestant denominations are active in the country. They are especially strong in Alsace, the northern Jura, the southern Massif Central, and the central Atlantic region. The historic depth of religious feeling in France is perhaps best reflected by the country’s magnificent cathedrals.\n\nOf the non-Christian religions, Islam has the largest following. Reflecting the presence of immigrants from North Africa, France has more than 4 million Muslims. The Jewish community in France, though relatively small, has had a strong influence on the economic and cultural life of the country. France has the largest Jewish population in Europe and one of the largest outside the United States and Israel. Most French Jews and Muslims live in Paris, Lyon, and Marseille. Many of the French, especially among the working classes and the young, profess no religious belief.\n\nUrban and Rural Settlement\n\nLike other European countries, France was predominantly a rural society throughout most of its history, with much of the population concentrated in villages or clustered around castles or manor houses. A few larger communities began to develop early in the Middle Ages as sites with certain features became settlements. Many of these sites were at river crossings and mountain passes and on trade routes and harbors.\n\nParis, as the administrative, economic, and cultural center of an expanding country, grew steadily. By 1500 Paris had a population of about 225,000 and was Europe’s largest city. In general, however, French cities remained small. Lyon, Rouen, and Tours were the only others with as many as 60,000 people in 1500. Many relatively important communities had no more than 5,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe rapid growth rate of urban France, as elsewhere in Europe, came in the 18th and 19th centuries with the Industrial Revolution. By the time of the 1911 census, the population of France was almost half urban. Most of the urban population growth consisted of migration from the countryside. Rural people, many of them impoverished by the machines and manufacturing methods of the Industrial Revolution, flocked to take advantage of the growing job prospects of the cities, which also offered social and educational opportunities. The construction of railroads increased this flow during the late 19th century. By the mid-20th century many rural areas, especially in Brittany, the Massif Central, and the Alps, had lost much of their population.\n\nAfter 1960 the population of French cities changed in several ways. Internal migration from the provinces diminished. At the same time, people from Italy, Spain, Portugal, Yugoslavia, and other European countries joined the French urban-industrial labor force. By the 1990s the face of urban immigration had shifted again, with most arrivals coming from former French colonies, especially those in North Africa and Southeast Asia. The central districts of many French cities began to show population declines as the cost and inconvenience of life in crowded older quarters exceeded the advantages. Suburban living became more accessible with increased automobile ownership.\n\nParis is still by far the most important city of France and is one of the world’s leading cultural and economic centers. The government has tried to decrease the overwhelming influence of Paris by encouraging the decentralization of industry, promoting the economic and cultural development of many regional centers, and building new towns far from the capital. Among France’s major cities are Marseille (also spelled Marseilles), Lyon, Lille, Toulouse, Nice, Nantes, Strasbourg, and Bordeaux.\n\nCulture\n\nFrench culture has evolved primarily from the influences of three ancient civilizations—Celtic, Greco-Roman, and Germanic. Far from being static, however, French culture continues to develop, incorporating new ideas and movements while maintaining a respect for history and a love of tradition. Monuments are found everywhere, many from as long ago as the Roman occupation.\n\nThe rich culture that developed during the Middle Ages was fostered by monks and scholars and encouraged by the wealthy patrons of the aristocracy. The development of the middle class, or bourgeoisie, at the beginning of the 18th century extended the reaches of culture to a wider audience. This was the time of the Enlightenment, an intellectual movement that provoked inquiry and discussion on topics ranging from philosophy to science and art. The spread of free and compulsory primary education by the late 19th century and free secondary education by the end of World War II raised literacy levels and made culture more accessible than ever before.\n\nFrench culture has historically been centered in Paris, though smaller cities and towns have contributed much, particularly in the realm of cuisine. The regions of Bordeaux, Burgundy, and Champagne have produced world-famous wines for centuries. In general, regional cultures are strong and often fiercely defended. In Brittany, parts of the south, and Alsace, for example, much time and money is spent in support of local culture.\n\nThe Arts\n\nThe French people as a whole highly value artistic creativity. As the arts have flourished, they have spread the influence of French culture throughout the world. The French have made invaluable contributions to literature, painting, music, ballet, sculpture, motion pictures, and photography, among other arts.\n\nFrench literature has a tradition that extends back through the Middle Ages. Eighteenth-century author-philosophers such as Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau were instrumental in shaping the ideas of modern France. The works of Jean Racine, Molière, and other neoclassical playwrights are still widely performed. Victor Hugo, Honoré de Balzac, and Marcel Proust were among the literary giants of the 19th century. French authors have won more than a dozen Nobel Prizes for literature, more than those of any other country. Among these Nobel prizewinners were Sully Prudhomme, Anatole France, André Gide, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre in the 20th century and J.M.G. Le Clézio and Patrick Modiano in the early 21st century.\n\nPainting has long been a vital art form in France. Artists often enjoyed the patronage of the nobility, producing works of quality and variety. During the 19th century the impressionist movement was largely the inspiration of French artists such as Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Claude Monet. Many art trends of the 20th century also originated in France.\n\nFrench music gained a wide international following in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Such composers as Hector Berlioz, Camille Saint-Saëns, Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy, and the Polish-born Frédéric Chopin created a distinctively French style. Later French composers included Pierre Boulez, Darius Milhaud, and Erik Satie. In the late 20th century France became known for supporting experimentation in electronic music and acoustics. France is also famous for developing ballet, particularly in the 17th-century court of Louis XIV.\n\nThe atmosphere of free inquiry and artistic integrity that is characteristic of France has attracted many artists and writers from other countries. Leonardo da Vinci, from Italy, spent his later years in France. Spanish-born Pablo Picasso spent most of his artistic life in France. Many American writers, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Edna St. Vincent Millay, and Gertrude Stein, lived in Paris during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nFrench cinema has occupied an important place in national culture for more than a hundred years. Auguste and Louis Lumière made important contributions to motion-picture technology in the late 19th century. Alice Guy-Blaché, the first woman film director, was another noted industry pioneer of the era. In the 1920s French film became famous for its poetic realist mode, exemplified by the grand historical epics of Abel Gance. Such directors as Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut came to prominence with the New Wave group of filmmakers during the late 1950s and the 1960s. Among other French directors to gain international stature were Jean Renoir, Alain Resnais, Robert Bresson, Louis Malle, and Claude Chabrol.\n\nThe leading French film stars of the 20th century included Fernandel, Maurice Chevalier, Brigitte Bardot, Gérard Depardieu, and Catherine Deneuve. Among those French actors winning accolades in the 21st century were Audrey Tautou, Juliette Binoche, Marion Cotillard, and Vincent Cassel. One of the world’s premier film festivals is held annually at Cannes, where the Palme d’Or is awarded to the best motion picture.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThrough the centuries architecture has been the visible, enduring record of the peoples who have inhabited France, of their cultural influences, and often of the historic currents that have swept across Europe. Prehistoric stone monuments are abundant, particularly in Brittany, where the famous alignments at Carnac may have had astronomical, as well as religious and cultural, significance. Arenas, theaters, triumphal arches, and other evidence of Roman colonization are widely found. Many of them have been restored.\n\nDuring medieval times preoccupation with defense and nation building led to the construction of strong fortresses. Although most of them suffered during the centuries of warfare that followed, some survived or have been restored, including La Cité, the vast walled city at Carcassonne. Religious fervor found expression in architecture during this period. Most of the famous churches and cathedrals of France were built then. Many examples of the earlier Romanesque style remain, but the soaring beauty of such Gothic cathedrals as those in Paris, Reims, Amiens, Chartres, and Beauvais place them among the most treasured French buildings. The majority of these cathedrals were begun in the 13th century, though the building of the massive Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris started in the mid-12th century.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, France’s unity, power, and wealth were expressed in the impressive, often extravagant creations of the monarchy. Near Paris, palaces such as those at Versailles, Vincennes, and Fontainebleau still rank among the leading architectural masterpieces. The valleys of the Loire River and its tributaries are dotted with sumptuous ornamental châteaux, or castles, such as those at Chambord, Chenonceaux, and Blois.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries the zenith of French military and colonial power gave rise to grandiose architecture, much of it in Paris. The Arc de Triomphe (Arch of Triumph) celebrates the victories of Napoleon I. Urban renovation of the mid-19th century provided buildings such as the Opéra and broad streets such as the Champs-Élysées. The Eiffel Tower, which has come to symbolize Paris and even all of France, was built as a supposedly temporary exhibit for the World’s Fair of 1889.\n\nFrench architecture has continued to be vital and imaginative. Le Corbusier was one of the most famous of all modern architects. Subsidies from the French government have sustained architecture into the 21st century. Two major achievements of the late 20th century, both located in Paris, were the controversial but successful Pompidou Center, designed by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers, and the pyramid entrance to the Louvre Museum, designed by I.M. Pei.\n\nEducation and Social Welfare\n\nThe generally high standard of living in France is due in part to the educational and social benefits offered by the government. Education is free in both the public schools and universities. Nearly everyone is covered by the social security system. To pay for these services, French employers and employees are taxed at a higher rate than those in many other European countries.\n\nEducation\n\nSchooling, both to instill appropriate citizenship values into the country’s youth and to prepare them for useful roles in a changing national economy, has been a special concern of the government since the French Revolution. Until that time, education was largely controlled by the Roman Catholic Church. Today, there is a wide range of educational opportunities for children, ranging from the excellent public school system to church, private, and alternative schooling. Despite the official separation of church and state, many parents choose a parochial education for their children.\n\nPublic education in France is characterized by its highly centralized structure. The country is divided into educational districts called académies, each headed by a rector who is responsible directly to the minister of education. The French system ensures uniformity throughout the country, but it limits flexibility and allows little local input.\n\nA typical French student begins preschool as early as the age of 2 and enters elementary school at 6. After five years of primary school, the student attends a secondary school called a collège for an additional four years. At age 15 students continue on to another type of secondary school called a lycée, where they may choose either a three-year program leading to the baccalauréat examination or two or three years of technical and vocational courses.\n\nLycée graduates who pass the baccalauréat examination may be admitted to a university. The University of Paris—often called the Sorbonne, which was actually the most celebrated of its various colleges—once dominated higher education in France to an unusual extent. Meanwhile, well-known universities in provincial centers such as Montpellier, Rennes, Lille, Grenoble, and Aix-en-Provence remained comparatively small. In the 1960s, however, student protests about the unavailability of university places, together with concern for the country’s growing educational needs, led to a restructuring of the university system and a great increase in financial resources. The University of Paris was divided into a number of entirely separate universities. Provincial universities expanded rapidly in number and size.\n\nUnique to the French system is a parallel educational network of grandes écoles, schools that compete with and partly reduce the importance of the universities. These elite institutions, founded by Napoleon, were designed to provide France with a steady stream of superbly qualified civil servants and administrators, a function they still perform. Among the best known grandes écoles are the École Nationale d’Administration (National School of Administration), established in 1945, and the École Polytechnique (Polytechnic School), founded in 1794. Most high public officials in France have graduated from the École Nationale d’Administration. The École Polytechnique is now the most important engineering technical school in both the public and private sectors.\n\nScience and Medicine\n\nScientific research has benefited from the same intellectual climate of France that stimulated cultural and artistic achievement. During the 18th and 19th centuries scientists such as Pierre-Simon Laplace and the Broglie family in physics, Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac in chemistry, and Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in biology contributed significantly to their fields. Toward the end of the 19th century the husband-and-wife team of Marie Curie and Pierre Curie began the research into radiation and nuclear physics that made them famous. During the 20th century French scientists won 18 Nobel Prizes in chemistry or physics. Marie Curie is the only person to have been awarded both prizes.\n\nMedical research in France has kept pace with the other sciences. Well-known figures such as Louis Pasteur and Claude Bernard highlight the history of French medicine. Eight 20th-century French researchers were honored by Nobel Prizes for Physiology or Medicine. In the late 20th century French researchers were pivotal in isolating the cause of AIDS. For their work in identifying HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) as the cause of AIDS, French scientists Françoise Barré-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier shared the 2008 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.\n\nHealth and Social Protection\n\nThe social security system is funded primarily by employers’ and employees’ contributions and a special income tax. The government makes up any deficits. The majority of the money is devoted to retirement benefits (pensions) and the partial reimbursement of most medical expenses. Excellent medical coverage and benefits have helped raise the average life expectancy in France to more than 85 years for women and more than 79 years for men. Other programs provide family benefits for dependent children, unemployment payments, and housing subsidies. The government has built an extensive public housing system and has also sought to encourage home ownership through low-interest loans.\n\nHistory\n\nArtifacts discovered by archaeologists show that people have lived in what is now France since the retreat of the Ice Age glaciers. In ancient times the land was known as Gaul. Roman armies led by Julius Caesar conquered Gaul and its people, the Celts, in 58–50 bc. During five centuries of Roman rule the Celts of Gaul became fully Romanized. In the cities of the south they dressed like the Romans, spoke the Latin language, and learned to respect Roman law. Gauls became Roman citizens, held government office, served in Roman legions, and returned home over Roman roads to teach the new ways. Christianity spread from Rome to Gaul and was widely adopted as early as the 4th century.\n\nThe Merovingian and Carolingian Kings\n\nAs the Roman Empire declined in the 5th century, Germanic peoples settled in Gaul and other parts of the Roman world. The most successful of these peoples was the Franks, who settled in northern Gaul. The greatest of the early Frankish leaders was Clovis, who ruled from 481 to 511. He expanded Frankish power throughout much of Gaul and founded the Merovingian dynasty. His most important act as king was his conversion to Catholic Christianity. His Roman subjects were Catholic Christians, and his conversion helped win their support and the support of the powerful bishops of Gaul.\n\nThe Merovingian dynasty ruled Gaul until 751, but none of the later kings were as effective as Clovis. By the end of the 7th century many nobles had become as powerful as the kings. One family of nobles—the Carolingians—gained power as court officials and gradually took control of the kingdom. Charles Martel of this line led the armies that turned back an invasion of Muslim Arabs from Spain. This battle between Poitiers and Tours was one of a series that Charles fought that kept Muslim invaders out of the Frankish kingdom.\n\nThe greatest of the Carolingians was Charlemagne, who created an empire that included much of western Europe. He was a great warrior who spread Christianity to the lands he conquered. He also built schools to educate the young boys of his empire and invited the most learned men of Europe to join his court. On Christmas Day in 800 Charlemagne was crowned emperor by the pope in Rome.\n\nCharlemagne’s empire faced numerous problems after his death in 814. His successor, Louis the Pious, struggled against rebellions by his sons. He and the empire survived, but his sons divided the empire into three parts in 843. The western section would become the kingdom of France.\n\nIn the late 9th and 10th centuries the kingdom suffered repeated invasions by the Vikings. The Carolingian kings were unable to stop the invaders and lost power to regional leaders—dukes and counts—who offered protection to local settlements. The dukes and counts built castles to bolster their authority. Some were as powerful as the king. To keep their support the kings gave them land and rights. By the end of the 10th century the Carolingian king was one of many leaders in France. His authority was limited to the area around Paris. One powerful duke became a king himself. In 1066 William II, duke of the northwestern region of Normandy, vanquished England and took its crown. He is remembered as William the Conqueror.\n\nThe Middle Ages\n\nIn 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced by a new ruling family, the Capetian dynasty. This line of kings would rule France until 1328 and would restore royal authority throughout the kingdom. In the 11th century Capetian kings gradually built up power and extended their authority outside of Paris. In the 12th and 13th centuries they strengthened the monarchy through war and marriage alliances. Philip Augustus, or Philip II (ruled 1180–1223), took control of Normandy from the English king John. Louis IX (1226–70) improved the administration of the kingdom and established a reputation as a great Christian ruler. Philip IV (1285–1314) further expanded royal power throughout the kingdom and waged a successful struggle against the pope for control over the church in France. French kings, including Louis VII and Louis IX, led the Crusades. French knights made up the majority of the warriors who went on the First Crusade.\n\nFrance, especially Paris, was a center of art and culture during the Middle Ages. Architecture advanced as nobles built their great fortress-castles and growing towns erected beautiful churches. Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals are the glory of France today. The Capetian kings were early supporters of the Gothic style. Artists and craftsmen brought the stories of the Bible to life in the sculpture and stained glass of the churches.\n\nThe University of Paris attracted scholars from all over Europe to study theology, philosophy, and the liberal arts. The scholars wrote their treatises in Latin and offered their services to both church and state. The greatest medieval scholar, Thomas Aquinas, taught in Paris in the 13th century and wrote important works of theology. Minstrels recited the adventures of the knights and crusaders in chansons de geste (verse chronicles). Troubadours chanted verses of courtly love in the developing French tongue. (See also French literature.)\n\nJoan of Arc Saves France\n\nThe unity fostered by the Capetian kings broke down in the 14th century. The kingdom, like most of Europe, endured famine and disease, including the Black Death. The Capetian dynasty came to an end in 1328 and was replaced by the Valois line. The new dynasty’s efforts to impose itself on France were undermined by the challenge of the English kings, who claimed the right to the French throne. The struggle for the throne was the primary cause of the Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453). The English won several major battles and caused great destruction to the French countryside. The war was nearly lost until a peasant girl, Joan of Arc, led the French troops to victory.\n\nFrance recovered swiftly and prospered. The cities grew and gained strength as trade flourished. Able kings, such as Louis XI (ruled 1461–83), continued the struggle to bring the nobles’ powerful domains into the kingdoms. Territory changed hands through plots, wars, marriages, and inheritances.\n\nReligious Wars and a Strong Monarchy\n\nFrancis I (ruled 1515–47) strengthened the monarchy and gave it grandeur. He patronized the arts. He encouraged the discovery and exploration in America that was to bring France an empire in the New World. He also involved France in the rivalries of Europe, however, and wasted its wealth in fruitless wars for Italian territory.\n\nThe outbreak of the Reformation and the spread of Protestantism led to wars of religion throughout Europe. In France Roman Catholics and French Protestants, called Huguenots, fought bitterly in the 16th century. Henry IV (1589–1610) restored order when he converted to Roman Catholicism and became the first Bourbon king. He signed the Edict of Nantes (1598), granting Protestantism partial toleration, but his assassination in 1610 showed that religious hatreds had not died.\n\nGrandeur Under Louis XIV\n\nThe 17th century is known as France’s great century. Colonies expanded and trade increased. Art and literature reached new heights. Able ministers, such as the duke de Sully, Cardinal Mazarin, and Jean-Baptiste Colbert, helped make France the foremost power in Europe. The greatest minister, Cardinal Richelieu, helped transform France into the leading kingdom in Europe under the authority of an all-powerful king. Under Louis XIV (ruled 1643–1715) Richelieu’s program was perfected and the movement to centralized government reached its peak. The Sun King’s power was absolute and thought to have been derived from God. He did not call the representative assembly known as the Estates-General into session. He treated his ministers as chief clerks. He also overturned the Edict of Nantes and waged several unsuccessful wars to extend his power.\n\nIn the 18th century France endured a long struggle with England over colonial possessions, and the Seven Years’ War brought conflict with both England and Prussia. Prussia’s forces under Frederick II the Great inflicted humiliating defeats on France, while the English captured French possessions in Canada, the Caribbean, and India. The one French success in the century-long competition with England was the support given to the rebellious North American colonies in the American Revolution (1775–83). French military officers fought with the American forces. For a short while the French navy had control of the high seas. Though the Americans’ victory enhanced French prestige, it failed to bring any territorial gains or economic advantages.\n\nThe French government was severely criticized for the loss of its colonies as well as for inefficiency, abuses, and extravagance. The new cultured middle class was dissatisfied with the old regime and demanded an influence in the government suitable to its wealth and education. France’s great 18th-century philosophers and writers spread ideas of freedom and equality (see Enlightenment).\n\nFrench Revolution and Rise of Napoleon\n\nMatters came to a crisis when financial problems forced the king to yield to protest and convene the Estates-General in 1789. His granting of freedom of the press led to the flooding of France with publications calling for reform and reconstruction. After several months of conflict between the Third Estate (representing the people) and the nobility and clergy, rumors spread that the aristocrats were looking to overthrow the Third Estate. Panic set in among the peasants, who eventually stormed the Bastille, a symbol of royal tyranny, on July 14. The revolution overthrew the monarchy and proclaimed a new French republic. But the country still faced years of terror and war.\n\nIn the late 1790s the French military, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, won great victories on the battlefield. With France suffering from political instability, the government turned to Napoleon, who became first consul in 1799. As emperor (1804–14) Napoleon attempted to make France the supreme power in Europe. In conquest after conquest, he built up a great empire in Europe before his battle-weary troops eventually met defeat, particularly in the disastrous Russian campaign of 1812 and in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The Congress of Vienna (1814–15) reduced France to its former limits.\n\nThe Napoleonic wars left France devastated. The country was slow in accustoming itself to the new order. The Revolution of 1830 (July 27–29) overthrew the Bourbons, who had been restored to the throne in 1814. Louis-Philippe, a member of the Orléans family, was declared a constitutional monarch. He was considered a liberal who was also sympathetic to the upper classes. Nevertheless, he wanted to be a king who both governed and reigned, and he participated actively in decision making. Eventually he fell in the Revolution of 1848 (February 22–24). After a stormy experiment with a Second Republic, the Second Empire brought Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte (a nephew of Napoleon I) to the throne in 1852, as Napoleon III.\n\nFranco-Prussian War and Third Republic\n\nNapoleon III ruled with an iron hand in the 1850s, limiting the rights of citizens. However, in 1859 he began implementing reforms to liberalize the empire. He gave amnesty to political exiles and relaxed controls on the press. Napoleon and his Second Empire fell as a result of the ruinous Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), launched by France against Germany. When Paris surrendered after a long siege, a provisional government made peace. France lost its provinces of Alsace and Lorraine and the valuable iron mines and heavy industry there. Parisian workers rebelled and established a government called the Commune, which was ruthlessly put down.\n\nThe Third Republic was founded in 1875. Under its constitution France had universal male suffrage and an elected parliament of two houses. (French women would not gain the right to vote until 1944.) The republic had a president, but real executive power lay with the body of ministers, or cabinet. Under the parliamentary system, when the government was defeated on a major bill, the cabinet was obliged to resign.\n\nThe public was so divided that it was difficult for any party or coalition to achieve a stable majority in parliament. The numerous political parties ranged from monarchist on the far right to socialist, and later communist, on the far left. Ministries tended to be made up of coalitions of leaders of various parties without a safe majority. In the Third Republic’s 65-year history more than 90 governments were formed, most lasting less than a year.\n\nEconomic Expansion\n\nDespite political conflict and instability during the 19th and early 20th centuries, France enjoyed economic progress. Agricultural production increased greatly after the revolution broke up the great estates and put small holdings into the hands of industrious farm families. Food was abundant. Wool, flax, and silk fibers supplied the growing textile industry. After the monarchy’s arbitrary regulations on manufacturing and trade were swept away, enterprising French manufacturers began to compete favorably with England’s factories. French companies stressed quality and elegance in their wares and found a market for them abroad.\n\nThe government aided commerce by building transportation lines. Abroad, it won colonies in Indochina and Africa to replace its 18th-century losses. In the mid-19th century foreign trade benefited by the building of the Suez Canal by Ferdinand de Lesseps.\n\nWorldwide Cultural Renown\n\nFrance’s cultural prestige was at its zenith. The Third Republic’s list of literary figures was as brilliant as in any period of history. French painters made Paris the world center of art. Museums and galleries in every country collected canvases by the masters of modern French schools of painting, especially Henri Matisse (leader of the Fauvist movement); impressionists such as Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, and Edgar Degas; and postimpressionists such as Paul Cézanne, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Georges Seurat.\n\nComposers such as Hector Berlioz, Camille Saint-Saëns, Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy, and the Polish-born Frédéric Chopin created a distinctively French style of music, original in both composition and harmonies. Scientists rivaled the artists in renown, with Marie Curie winning Nobel Prizes for physics and chemistry. Many of the important discoveries and inventions of the period were the work of French scientists and technologists.\n\nWorld War I and Its Aftermath\n\nImmediately after World War I broke out in 1914, France was invaded by Germany, and the country became the chief battlefield of the war. More than 1.3 million French soldiers were killed. Some 4 million were wounded. Many civilians died of starvation, exposure, disease, and military encounters. Northern France was occupied by the armies of the enemy and of the Allies. Hundreds of towns were deserted wastes. Millions of acres of farmland were scarred with shell holes and trenches. Industrial production was cut to a fraction of its prewar level.\n\nAfter Germany’s defeat, the treaty signed at Versailles provided benefits for France. It regained Alsace-Lorraine and took over many of Germany’s colonies. As payment for damage, France was given a 15-year lease on the Saar coal mines. Germany also agreed to make huge reparations. The Saar and Lorraine provided coal, iron, and potash to aid the postwar development of heavy industry.\n\nFrance assisted in the founding of the League of Nations. Its diplomats were active in the conferences of the 1920s and 1930s aimed at maintaining world peace. Aristide Briand, who served as prime minister of France 11 times between 1906 and 1932, was pivotal in achieving the Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928), in which 60 countries renounced war as an instrument of national policy. Yet the scars of World War I left France feeling insecure. In the 1930s it built the Maginot Line, an elaborate defensive barrier along the German border. France also maintained the largest standing army in Europe. Heavy defense costs forced the government to raise taxes, to float extensive loans, and, in 1926, to devalue the franc by about 80 percent. France also ran into continual difficulty trying to collect reparation payments from Germany.\n\nNevertheless, by the end of the 1920s France had apparently recovered its prewar prosperity and self-confidence. For a time it even seemed immune to the economic crisis that spread through Europe beginning in 1929. However, by 1931 France began to feel the effects of the worldwide economic depression.\n\nEurope Drifts into World War II\n\nIn 1933 Adolf Hitler rose to power in Germany. Boldly promising to create a greater Germany, Hitler rebuilt the army, navy, and air force and constructed fortifications paralleling the Maginot Line. France, however, was divided both politically and economically and failed to counter Germany’s threat. Parties of the left feared rightist plots to set up a dictatorship. Right and center parties feared a communist revolution.\n\nWhen civil war broke out in Spain in 1936, France’s Popular Front coalition, led by Léon Blum (France’s first Socialist prime minister), refused to intervene on behalf of the Republicans. In 1938 France joined England in appeasing Hitler’s demand for Czechoslovakian territory. This policy of appeasement fell into disrepute after Hitler annexed all of Czechoslovakia and Italy’s dictator, Benito Mussolini, seized Albania in 1939. Both France and England had made security guarantees to Poland. Following Germany’s invasion of that country in September 1939, both declared war on Germany.\n\nSurrender, Resistance, Liberation\n\nFrance and the United Kingdom planned to wage a defensive war of attrition, but their strategy failed. In May 1940 German forces swept through the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium. Within a short time the road to Paris lay open. Panic and defeatism gripped the government. It retreated from Paris to Tours and later to Bordeaux. Finally, the defeatists, led by Marshal Henri-Philippe Pétain, gained control of the government and appointed Pétain prime minister. Pétain asked Germany for an armistice, and on June 22 he signed surrender terms. The armistice provided for the maintenance of a partially sovereign French state and for the division of the country into an occupied zone (northern France plus the western coast) and an unoccupied southern zone. France was made responsible for the German army’s occupation costs, and the French navy was forced to disarm.\n\nPétain declared the end of the Third Republic on July 11 and established a dictatorship, with Vichy as the capital. After the Allies invaded North Africa on November 8, 1942, Germany broke the surrender terms and occupied all of France.\n\nPart of the French army had escaped to England. This force was organized by General Charles de Gaulle into the Free French, later called the Fighting French. At home hundreds of thousands of people joined an underground organization called Le Maquis (meaning “Underbrush”), or the Resistance. This group harassed the occupying forces and aided the Allied liberation troops after they landed in Normandy on June 6, 1944. By August, Free French forces captured Paris.\n\nPostwar Chaos and Disunity\n\nVictory left France battered and exhausted. During World War II factories had been looted and bombed and transportation lines wrecked. Two million homes had been damaged—one-quarter of them beyond repair. Farms and vineyards had been neglected. The enormous task of reconstruction was complicated by the country’s great human losses. Some 2.5 million French prisoners of war, forced laborers, and deportees were still in German camps. Two-thirds of them would not return. An additional 550,000 people, including 350,000 civilians, had died during the war.\n\nDe Gaulle was made president of the provisional government. He called a referendum on France’s future. By an overwhelming majority, the French rejected a return to the prewar regime. Members of the Resistance dominated the new government, but they disagreed over the form of the new republic. In January 1946 de Gaulle resigned apparently because he was irritated with the political parties forming the government. A new constitution creating the Fourth Republic was approved in October. France’s wartime unity crumbled as numerous parties battled for power. When coalition governments took office, their policies often failed to get support in the National Assembly. Like governments in the Third Republic, governments in the Fourth Republic were often short-lived: in its 12 years the Fourth Republic had 26 governments.\n\nAchievements Under Four-Year Plans\n\nFrance initially lagged behind its European allies and West Germany in reconstruction and industrial recovery. In 1946, however, the country embarked on a series of highly successful development plans. The first plan was aimed mainly at reconstruction and at replacing the obsolete equipment that had kept output low. Investments in equipment and modernization totaled nearly $12 billion. In 1948 the French began receiving enormous economic aid from the United States under the European Recovery Program (or Marshall Plan), making funds available to buy machinery and materials for public and private industries and public works.\n\nIndustrial expansion was the objective of the 1954–57 and 1958–61 plans. Large investments were also made in housing, schools, hospitals, sanitary engineering, water supply, and city planning. Production had been expanding at an annual average rate of about 4.5 percent when the 1962–65 plan, which aimed at a 5.5 percent annual increase, began.\n\nPlans for European Economic Cooperation\n\nFrance took a leading role in movements to unite western Europe economically. In 1948 it joined with 15 other countries to establish the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), which coordinated efforts to restore Europe’s economy under the Marshall Plan. The following year the Council of Europe was established with headquarters in Strasbourg.\n\nIn 1950 French foreign minister Robert Schuman and diplomat Jean Monnet proposed the establishment of a common market for coal and steel in western Europe. The plan became reality two years later, when France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg formed the European Coal and Steel Community. The same six countries also organized the European Economic Community, or Common Market, which sought the gradual elimination of customs duties and other restrictions on trade. The Common Market and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), which pooled atomic resources for industrial use, both came into existence on January 1, 1958.\n\nFrance rejected the European Defense Community plan in 1954, but the next year it approved the similar Western European Union and authorized a German army of 12 divisions within NATO. France and the United Kingdom failed to get support from their allies in 1956 when they invaded Egypt in an attempt to free the Suez Canal from blockade.\n\nRebellion in Overseas Territories\n\nDuring World War II France’s colonies supplied valuable resources and manpower to de Gaulle and the Free French movement. After the war, the colonies demanded a new relationship with France. French leaders recognized the need to grant concessions. But most French leaders wanted to maintain the country’s empire, partly because losing it seemed incompatible with France’s effort to rebuild the self-respect it lost in the war. The constitution of 1946 introduced only mild reforms: the empire was renamed the French Union, within which the colonial peoples would enjoy some powers plus some representation in the French parliament.\n\nIn the 1950s relations worsened between France and its Asian and North African colonies. The situation in Indochina became especially desperate. A long war against the communist Viet Minh of northern Vietnam resulted in severe losses to French Union troops. After the French forces were surrounded and routed by the Vietnamese at Dienbienphu, an armistice was signed in 1954 in Geneva. Vietnam was divided into a communist North Vietnam and a noncommunist South Vietnam. With full independence for Laos, South Vietnam, and Cambodia in 1954, the conception of a united “French Indochina” ended.\n\nIn North Africa the Arab League helped rouse nationalist ambitions and revolts among the Muslims in French territories. It recognized the independence of Morocco and Tunisia in 1956. The French regarded Algeria, however, as part of France itself. French settlers, called colons, had participated in its development. The colons violently opposed the demands of the Arab peoples for freedom. By 1958 France had sent some 500,000 troops to Algeria, but it was unable to defeat the rebellion. As the revolt dragged on, it sapped French finances and added to the political dissension.\n\nDe Gaulle and the Fifth Republic\n\nThe unstable ministries of the Fourth Republic were unable to end the Algerian conflict or solve France’s economic problems. In May 1958 leaders of the French army in Algeria appealed to General de Gaulle to take control of the government. De Gaulle agreed to return to public life only if he was given full power to act, including the ability to reform the constitution. On June 1 de Gaulle became prime minister and was granted full powers for six months. His constitution, which created a strong presidency, won the overwhelming backing of the voters in September 1958. The Fifth Republic officially came into existence on October 4, 1958. De Gaulle was elected president in December and assumed his presidential functions the following month.\n\nDe Gaulle faced two major issues: the Algerian conflict and inflation. To combat the latter, he devalued the franc and made French currency convertible abroad. France thus could offer favorable prices on its goods in foreign trade. De Gaulle also put into effect an austerity budget. Private investment increased. France prospered along with other member countries of the Common Market.\n\nIn September 1959 de Gaulle suggested self-determination for the Algerians. This enraged the colons, who stirred up riots in Algeria and demonstrations against de Gaulle in France. There were also several attempts on de Gaulle’s life.\n\nIndependence for Many French Colonies\n\nGuinea gained its independence from France in 1958. In 1960 twelve other French possessions in Africa—Dahomey (now Benin), Ivory Coast (now Côte d’Ivoire), Niger, Senegal, Mali, Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso), Congo, Gabon, Chad, Mauritania, the Malagasy Republic (now Madagascar), and the Central African Republic—gained their independence. In the same year two trusteeships, Cameroon and Togo, also became republics.\n\nThe French supported self-determination for Algeria in a January 1961 referendum. Peace talks with the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) were begun in May. This set off terrorist violence organized by the Secret Army Organization (OAS) in France and Algeria. The long-awaited truce guaranteeing Algerian independence was signed on March 18, 1962, and it was approved by more than 90 percent of French voters in April. The agreement provided for joint control of Algerian oil. Algeria became independent on July 3, 1962.\n\nThe Comoros islands unilaterally declared independence in 1975. However, Mayotte, one of the islands, rejected independence and eventually became an overseas département and région of France. The Territory of the Afars and Issas became the Republic of Djibouti in 1977.\n\nFrance After Algeria\n\nFollowing the agreement on Algerian independence, de Gaulle reached new heights of popularity and power. Elections in 1962 gave the Gaullists a majority in parliament. De Gaulle stepped up his efforts to give France primacy in western Europe by developing nuclear weapons and a space program. In 1963 France rejected proposals by the United States and the United Kingdom for a multilateral NATO force. It also blocked the United Kingdom’s entry into the Common Market and refused to sign the international nuclear test ban treaty. France had begun atomic bomb tests in 1960 and sent its first Earth satellite into orbit in 1965. It launched its first nuclear-powered submarine in 1967.\n\nIn 1962 voters backed de Gaulle’s proposed constitutional amendment that would allow French voters to directly elect the president. In 1965 de Gaulle was reelected for a second term, becoming the first French president elected by popular vote since 1848. In 1966 he withdrew France from all NATO military activities and required NATO forces and headquarters to leave French soil.\n\nThe mid-1960s were considered the golden years of de Gaulle’s rule. The country enjoyed economic growth, it had restored its role in international affairs, and it was taking the lead in uniting Europe economically. Not all of the French people were happy with de Gaulle’s rule, however. In 1968 students and workers led violent protests that grew into a national crisis. De Gaulle left Paris on May 29, returning the following day with a promise of armed support from French commanders to put down the demonstrations. The country rallied around de Gaulle. Nevertheless, in April 1969 de Gaulle resigned after voters rejected a referendum he supported.\n\nFormer prime minister Georges Pompidou was elected president in 1969, but he died in office on April 2, 1974. The following month Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, finance minister in the de Gaulle and Pompidou cabinets, was elected president. Giscard appointed as his prime minister Jacques Chirac, and he pushed through policies designed to appeal to younger voters, such as environmental-protection laws, legalized abortion, and a lower voting age. Chirac and Giscard soon had a falling out, and Chirac resigned. He formed a new party, the Rally for the Republic, and was elected mayor of Paris.\n\nA New Socialist Era\n\nWhen Giscard’s presidential term ended in May 1981, it seemed as though he would win a second term. He overcame a strong challenge by Chirac in the first round of voting and seemed poised to defeat the Socialist François Mitterrand in the runoff. However, Mitterrand narrowly defeated Giscard, becoming the country’s first popularly elected Socialist president. The Socialists, who soon won control of the National Assembly, raised taxes on businesses and the wealthy and nationalized several key industries. In 1986, however, the Socialists lost control of the National Assembly. For two years Mitterrand had to share power with Chirac as prime minister—an arrangement known as cohabitation. Chirac reversed many of Mitterrand’s policies, but Chirac’s popularity fell as a result of a transport strike and a wave of terrorist attacks in Paris. In 1988 Mitterrand was reelected for another seven-year term.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s France, along with Germany, led efforts to further integrate the countries in the European Community—from 1993, the European Union (EU)—both politically and economically. Mitterrand strongly supported the Maastricht Treaty (1991), a blueprint for European federalism and a single currency. When the treaty faced severe criticism in France, including riots by farmers, Mitterrand called a referendum to solidify support. His move nearly backfired. His prestige was reduced as only 51 percent of voters backed the treaty.\n\nIn 1991 Mitterrand appointed Edith Cresson as France’s first woman prime minister. In 1992, however, she was dismissed after the government’s defeat in regional elections. Mitterrand then named Pierre Bérégovoy to take her place. In the early 1990s the country was confronted by a wave of strikes, a weak economy that brought record unemployment, violent police clashes with immigrants, and political corruption. In 1993 conservative parties won a landslide victory and took control of 80 percent of the seats in the National Assembly. Mitterrand had to face cohabitation again. He appointed the Gaullist Édouard Balladur as prime minister.\n\nConservative Presidencies\n\nThough Chirac had organized Balladur’s appointment as prime minister, in 1995 he ran against Balladur and the Socialist Party candidate, Lionel Jospin, for the presidency. Chirac captured the presidency by beating Balladur in the first round and narrowly defeating Jospin in the second round. He appointed Alain Juppé, a former foreign minister, as prime minister.\n\nChirac made reducing France’s budget deficit his top priority. He wanted France to qualify for participation in a single common European currency, the euro, which replaced the franc as France’s sole currency in 2002. Chirac’s measures to cut government spending included freezing the wages of public-sector employees and reducing social welfare programs. Chirac continued to pursue his policies despite a massive general strike in late 1995 and record unemployment levels by 1997.\n\nHoping to win support for his program, Chirac called for parliamentary elections in May 1997. He lost the gamble when voters overwhelmingly cast their ballots for the left. Forced to enter a power-sharing arrangement, Chirac appointed Jospin as prime minister. Jospin’s Socialist government followed a moderate path, attempting to balance economic growth with social progress. Yet unemployment remained very high. In an attempt to ease the problem, the National Assembly shortened the national work week from 39 hours to 35 hours.\n\nIn 2002 Chirac won reelection over Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the National Front, a far-right party with an anti-immigration platform. In a surprisingly strong showing, Le Pen had defeated Jospin in the first round of voting. His second-place finish rallied the French political community—both left and right—in support of Chirac in the second round.\n\nFrance took the world spotlight in 2003 when Chirac, along with the leaders of Russia and Germany, opposed the United States and blocked United Nations authorization of the use of force against Iraq. Nevertheless, the United States and the United Kingdom, France’s traditional allies, invaded Iraq, touching off an intense diplomatic conflict. Although the French public largely agreed with Chirac on the Iraq War, his party suffered losses in both regional and European Parliament elections in 2004.\n\nFrench pride in the country’s ethnic diversity wavered in 2005 when the accidental deaths of two immigrant teenagers sparked violence in Paris that spread rapidly to other parts of the country. Nearly 9,000 cars were torched and nearly 3,000 arrests made during the riots, which were fueled by high unemployment, discrimination, and lack of opportunity within the primarily North African immigrant community. In 2006, in another display of dissatisfaction with the government, more than a million people gathered around the country to protest a law that would have eased the dismissal of young employees. Chirac, already suffering a sharp decline in popularity, was forced to suspend the law.\n\nChiracchose not to run for president again in 2007. Echoing the public’s desire for change, the two main political parties nominated a pair of relative newcomers to replace him. The Socialist Party selected Ségolène Royal, a former adviser to Mitterrand, while Chirac’s rival Nicolas Sarkozy won the nomination of the conservative Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). In the second round of voting, Sarkozy won a decisive victory. He promised to reduce unemployment, cut taxes, and toughen immigration laws.\n\nBeginning in 2009, however, high levels of public debt in some European countries led to an economic crisis in all those countries that used the euro as currency. Much of Sarkozy’s domestic and foreign policy was focused on addressing this euro-zone debt crisis. Along with German chancellor Angela Merkel, Sarkozy helped lead the European Union response to the crisis.\n\nHigh unemployment and economic uncertainty in France contributed to the public’s growing dissatisfaction with Sarkozy and his party. In 2010 the government proposed a series of austerity measures, including cuts in public spending to lower the deficit. Despite large nationwide strikes and other protests, the minimum retirement age was raised. Sarkozy drew additional criticism, notably from the European Union, for a crackdown on illegal immigration that targeted Roma (gypsies). France deported hundreds of Roma, mainly to Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nIn 2010 the French parliament overwhelmingly approved legislation to outlaw face-concealing garments in public places. The ban did not explicitly refer to Islamic dress but was widely understood to target veils that fully covered a woman’s face.\n\nSarkozy and the UMP continued to lose public support as he ordered additional austerity measures to reduce France’s budget deficit. In 2011 the Socialist Party and its allies won control of the Senate—the first time they had done so since the Fifth Republic had been proclaimed in 1958. In the presidential elections of 2012, Sarkozy lost to Socialist candidate François Hollande. Sarkozy was the first incumbent president of France in more than 30 years to fail to win reelection. Later in 2012 the Socialist Party continued its sweep, winning a clear majority of seats in the National Assembly.\n\nThe Hollande and Macron Administrations\n\nDespite President Hollande’s efforts, France’s economy continued to struggle as the unemployment rate crept stubbornly upward. In foreign policy the president was largely successful in pushing what came to be known as the “Hollande doctrine,” which sought to position France in a more prominent place on the global stage. Hollande won little support, however, in the municipal elections held in March 2014. Candidates from the UMP and National Front swept the Socialists from office in scores of mayoral races. French voters continued to express their dissatisfaction with Hollande the following May, when the Socialists finished a distant third behind the National Front and the UMP in European Union parliamentary elections.\n\nIn January 2015 France was shaken by terrorist attacks that claimed the lives of 17 people, including 11 journalists and security personnel at the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, a satiric magazine. The country rallied around Hollande, though his approval numbers soon sank again. The Socialists were crushed in local elections that March. The president’s domestic agenda met resistance from his own party.\n\nIn November 2015 at least 129 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in another wave of terrorist attacks in Paris. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL; also known as ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attacks. Hollande declared a state of emergency and stated that France was “at war” with the group. Over subsequent days, French jets bombed targets in ISIL-held areas in Syria and Iraq. An international manhunt targeted those who were suspected of involvement in the attacks. Hollande also proposed expanded security measures and greater cooperation with the U.S. and Russian forces that were already conducting military campaigns against ISIL.\n\nAnother terrorist attack occurred in Nice on July 14, 2016, when a terrorist drove a truck through a large crowd of people celebrating Bastille Day. At least 84 people were killed and many more were injured in the attack, which was France’s third major terrorist attack in 18 months. The driver had a history of petty crime but no known association with terrorist groups. He was killed in a gun battle with police.\n\nThe French presidential election of 2017 produced many surprises. Hollande had become deeply unpopular with French voters. With his approval ratings dipping into the single digits, he announced in December 2016 that he would not seek reelection. That made him the first French president since World War II to decline to run for reelection. Benoît Hamon won the Socialist Party nomination, but he did not attract much support among voters. Former president Nicolas Sarkozy tried to stage a political comeback, but he finished a distant third in the presidential primary of the Republicans (formerly the UMP). The winner of that primary was François Fillon, who had served as prime minister under Sarkozy. However, Fillon soon become embroiled in an embezzlement scandal. In the days before the election, polls showed a close race, with candidates from the far right, far left, and center challenging Fillon. Security remained an important issue in the campaign. Just days before the election, another terrorist attack took place, as a gunman killed a police officer and wounded two others in Paris.\n\nIn the first round of voting in the presidential election, on April 23, 2017, the candidates of the mainstream political parties were eliminated. Instead, the two candidates to advance to a runoff election were Emmanuel Macron, a pro-EU and pro-business centrist who had served as finance minister under Hollande, and Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front party. Le Pen campaigned on a program to limit France’s role in the EU and to severely restrict immigration. Macron, who had never before held an elected office, did not belong to an established political party. Rather, he was the leader of a new political movement called En Marche! (“Forward!”). In the runoff election on May 7, 2017, Macron won a decisive victory, capturing about two-thirds of the vote. At age 39, he was the youngest person elected president of France.\n\nWhen legislative elections were held in June 2017, En Marche! claimed 308 of 577 seats in the National Assembly. Macron formed a coalition that commanded a sizable majority of 350 seats. His government soon encountered domestic troubles, however. In an effort to attract foreign investment, Macron enacted tax policies that benefited France’s wealthiest citizens. Critics began to deride Macron as the “president of the rich.” Public criticism of his government intensified in late 2018, when protesters took to the streets in opposition to a proposed fuel tax increase. The protesters came to be called gilets jaunes (”yellow vests”) after the bright traffic safety vests they wore. The French public broadly supported the protesters. Eventually Macron was forced to withdraw the fuel tax. The country briefly rallied around Macron in April 2019, after a fire seriously damaged Notre-Dame Cathedral. Macron launched an international fund-raising campaign to rebuild the cathedral.\n\nBeginning in 2020 France faced a public health crisis caused by the outbreak of an illness known as COVID-19. In March the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global pandemic. France’s economy suffered as the government locked down nonessential businesses and restricted travel. More than 27 million people in France contracted COVID-19 over the next two years. The country’s high rate of vaccination and jobs retention scheme, however, helped to spare France from the high death rates and lingering unemployment witnessed elsewhere.\n\nIn spite of his administration’s largely effective response to the pandemic, Macron’s approval rating consistently hovered around 40 percent. His low polling numbers were reflected in the results of the 2021 regional elections. En Marche! performed poorly in those elections, failing to capture a single region. In the 2022 presidential election Macron faced a serious challenge from far-right leader Le Pen. Macron was the top vote-getter in the first round and advanced once again to a runoff with Le Pen. In the runoff, held on the April 24, Macron won reelection with more than 58 percent of the vote. He was the first French president in 20 years to earn a second term."
