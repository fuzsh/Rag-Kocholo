After his emigration to the US in 1949, sets were sold by the American Friends Service Committee to raise funds for Zielezinski's support. Zielezinski, a Polish Catholic, was arrested in March 1943 in Warsaw by the German occupation authorities for political activity. He was sent to Auschwitz and, in January 1944, to Flossenb√ºrg.

After liberation on April 29, 1945, Jerzy was hospitalized and while recovering he made finished drawings of camp life and atrocities, based upon the sketches he made secretly on scraps of paper in the camps. He then lived in Schwandorf and Munich displaced persons camp, until gong to America.
