        "text": "A\n\nt the start of Ousmane SembÃ¨neâs 1975 film Xala, a group of Black men in bright, silken dashikis stride up the steps of Dakarâs Chambre de Commerce. Stationed impassively in its boardroom are three white men in dark suits and dark glasses. The Senegalese challengers quickly depose these last hangers-on of the French imperial regime. Pomp and ceremony ensue, with dancing and cheers on the Dakar street.Â\n\nBut SembÃ¨ne did not believe in easy victories. In the filmâs next scene, the Frenchmen return to the Chambre de Commerce, their path cleared by a contingent of Senegalese police. The Frenchmen enter the boardroom silently, carrying seven briefcases. They place one in front of each new board member, now dressed in tuxedos. (One, Xalaâs protagonist El Hadji, will be marrying his third wife later that afternoon.) Opening the briefcases brings a smile of surprise to most men around the table. Inside are stacks of cash. Only the new president of the Chambre de Commerce reacts with apprehension - all at once he seems no longer so sovereign - but by the filmâs end he will have figured out how to get along with a white shadow. (These shots of the cash-filled briefcases were among cuts made by Senegalese censors before Xala could be publicly screened (Gugler & Diop 1998), only restored later.)\n\nThough unremarked upon in Xala, the substance of those briefcases is not âcashâ in general, but the CFA franc in particular. The franc CFA (originally denoting Colonies franÃ§aises dâAfrique) is the official currency of Senegal and most other former French colonies in Africa, from before national independence through the present-day. This monetary system and its history are the subjects of a new book by Fanny Pigeaud and Ndongo Samba Sylla, Africaâs Last Colonial Currency (2021), translated by Thomas Fazi from a 2018 French edition. The book brings to the attention of Anglophone readers the peculiar institutions through which the French Republic continues to exercise colonial rule over nominally independent African states. Franceâs recent âcounterterrorismâ operations across the Sahel region (supported and rivaled in scope by the United Statesâ Africa Command, AFRICOM) represent only one phase in what the Black Alliance for Peace (2020) has called Franceâs âactive and aggressive military presence in Africa for years.â Aggression has often had monetary motivations, and control has often exceeded aggression. One of Pigeaud and Syllaâs commitments and achievements is to show how âFrench âsoftâ monetary power is inseparable from its âhardâ military powerâ (2021: 99). In their telling, the CFA franc has for decades been Franceâs secret weapon in âFranÃ§afrique,â the zone in Africa where France, its representatives, and its monetary system have never really left.\n\nSylla, an economist at the Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung in Dakar, is an increasingly prominent voice on money and finance from the international left. Pigeaud is a journalist with decades of reporting experience in CÃ´te dâIvoire and Cameroon. The two make a good pair. Offering a crystal-clear dissection of a purposefully opaque economic system, Africaâs Last Colonial Currency is at once exposÃ©, history, and economics explainer - and a marker of new directions for critical political economy in the 21st century.\n\nOrigins of the CFA Franc\n\nThe franc CFA was born in Paris on the 25th of December, 1945, with the signature of General Charles de Gaulle and Franceâs ministers of finance and the colonies. The colonial situation was plain: in 1945, the abbreviation CFA indicated Colonies franÃ§aise dâAfrique, extending across two main colonial federations, French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa, as well as Cameroon, Togo, French Somaliland (now Djibouti), Madagascar, and RÃ©union. (Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco had their own specific franc denominations, as did certain French colonies and dependencies elsewhere.) For decades prior, colonial governments and private European banks had striven to âforcibly convert local societies to the colonial capitalist systemâ through taxes payable only in francs, supplanting and suppressing indigenous economic systems (7). The franc and its commercial infrastructure cemented what Pigeaud and Sylla call the colonial pact, the intra-imperial division of labor restricting industrial labor and monopoly ownership to the French while offering âcommercial preferences to the products of the coloniesâ (8). To be sure, these âpreferential regimesâ mostly offered opportunity for the profiteering from colony to metropole so influentially characterized by dependency theorists as âunderdevelopment.â\n\nBy 1945, however, the Second World War had thoroughly disrupted the imperial order. Metropolitan France suffered widespread food shortages, high inflation, and dwindling reserves of the foreign currencies necessary for importing other materials for rebuilding the nation. To join the international monetary system forged in the Bretton Woods agreements - ratified by the French on that same 1945 Christmas - the metropolitan franc would need to be devalued against the U.S. dollar, bolstered by the much stronger U.S. economy. In a spirit of âselflessness,â declared French finance minister RenÃ© Pleven, France did ânot want to impose on its distant daughters the consequences of its own povertyâ (12). Differentiating the metropolitan franc from a new CFA franc would thus spare the colonies from this harsh devaluation. According to Pleven, a differently-valued CFA currency, at a fixed exchange rate (first, 1 to 1.70) with the metropolitan franc but freely convertible from one to the other, would better ârespectâ Africansâ âneeds and their local contingenciesâ (12).\n\nThe embattled empire was compelled to âloosen its gripâ in Africa, extending new rights and privileges to African subjects who had âplayed a decisive role in the war effortâ and now insisted on social improvements (10). Consequently, argue Pigeaud and Sylla, the creation of the CFA franc was âactually designed to allow France to regain control of its coloniesâ (13).Â\n\nWhat Minister Pleven called generosity might better be called a swindle. While the French franc faced devaluation, the CFA franc came into existence over-valued [1]. Pigeaud and Sylla break down how this mismatch was âperfectly functional to Parisâs interestsâ (13). French goods-for-export, now priced in a devalued currency (made cheaper), would find easy markets in the colonies, increasingly through middle-men like Xalaâs Chambre de Commerce. African goods - especially important raw materials, from uranium to cocoa, priced too expensively for domestic consumption and now (by virtue of the âstrongâ CFA franc) more expensively than those of other tropical suppliers - would find buyers more exclusively in France, who would not have to use foreign reserves to purchase these essential imports. In effect, the new CFA monetary policies re-consolidated Franceâs imperial economy even as the monopoly regime of the colonial pact could be formally retired in recognition of demands for change from colonial subjects.\n\nThis pattern of surface transformation and structural continuity finds a case in point in the abbreviation CFA. First, in 1958, after the empireâs âloi-cadreâ reforms and a restored President de Gaulleâs increasing efforts to contain the anticolonial energies of Dien Bien Phu, Bandung, and Algiers (Cooper 1996: 429), the Colonies franÃ§aises dâAfrique were re-christened the CommunautÃ© franÃ§aise dâAfrique. By 1960, the names changed again, with formal decolonization in most of FranÃ§afrique and the splitting of the CFA zone into regional blocs: principally the CommunautÃ© financiÃ¨re en Afrique (in 7 countries of the former French West Africa, plus Guinea-Bissau since 1997) and CoopÃ©ration financiÃ¨re en Afrique centrale (in 5 countries of the former French Equatorial Africa, plus Equatorial Guinea since 1984). CFA to CFA to CFA, the egalitarian parlance of community and cooperation modernized French colonial authority, making it more invisible rather than marking its end.Â\n\nGuarantees and Other Fixes\n\nPlus Ã§a change, plus câest la mÃªme chose, the saying goes. The CFA franc has persisted even as Franceâs empire in Africa gave way to independent nation-states (except RÃ©union, made an overseas dÃ©partement) and even as the French franc was replaced by the euro. For insights into this central dilemma, Pigeaud and Sylla turn to the inner workings of the CFA franc system. Its key principles have remained remarkably durable over decades. Most importantly, France has held up a guarantee of unlimited convertibility between CFA francs and French currency for the three regional central banks of the CFA zone, where blocs of African countries have pooled reserves and coordinated monetary policy since 1955 (institutionalizing the post-1945 CFA franc system).\n\nThis guarantee has two key conditions. First, CFA francs can only ever be converted into Franceâs currency (franc before 1999, euro ever since) before being exchanged for other currencies; even different regional CFA francs must first be converted into the French unit before another CFA franc. Second, the CFA zone central banks have been required to hold an âoperations accountâ at the French Treasury in which to store proportions of their foreign reserves. (These proportions have been lowered in response to moments of political challenge, first from maximal down to 65% in 1967 and then again to 50% in 2005.) Franceâs convertibility guarantee and these stipulations help maintain the fixed parity of the CFA and French currencies and, in the event of overdrafting at the FranÃ§afrique central banks, prevent an emergency devaluation of the CFA franc.\n\nIt bears clarifying: the âfixedâ exchange rate underwriting this system has only ever been fixable by French authorities and only ever adjusted at their discretion, according to their need and benefit. And despite the French Treasuryâs purported guarantee against devaluations of the CFA franc, devaluations of the CFA franc have occurred, and only ever on account of French decisions (67). The late Egyptian economist Samir Amin, an adviser to anticolonial leaders across the continent since the 1950s, once remembered the situation as follows:\n\nI thought the CFA was overvalued, but to varying degrees depending on each country, and that this gap between countries would increase more and more, as national development policies and their results also differed between countriesâ¦I insisted that it had to be understood that a devaluation was not in itself something to be ashamed of, but that it had to be self-controlled; that we should avoid putting ourselves in the position of having it forced upon us by the âmarket,â the French Treasury or the IMF. (73)\n\nIn 1994, in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund and against the wishes of most African leaders, French authorities adjusted the franc zone exchange rate for the first time, devaluing the CFA franc by half. This blanket devaluation was the shock through which structural adjustment was forced upon FranÃ§afrique - an experience satirized in Djibril Diop MambÃ©tyâs 1994 film Le Franc. And the devaluation proved, to Pigeaud and Sylla, that Franceâs ââguarantee of unlimited convertibilityâ was an intellectual and political fraudâ (74).\n\nNevertheless, French authorities have continually held up - that is, brandished and exploited - this guarantee, without honoring it. France has never needed to act on the unlimited convertibility commitment and perhaps never intended to do so. The CFA zone central banks, on whose boards French representatives sit and exercise effective veto power, have maintained stringent money management standards and never faced a convertibility crisis. It is, instead, these central banks in Africa that have guaranteed both the ongoing convertibility of the CFA franc and Franceâs own financial prestige and opportunities for colonial control and accumulation. Pigeaud and Sylla do not mince words: âFrance uses its presumed role of âguarantorâ as a pretext and as a tool to blackmail its former colonies in order to keep them in its orbit, both economically and politicallyâ (38).Â\n\nEconomically, Pigeaud and Sylla argue, the French Treasuryâs guarantee has overdetermined FranÃ§afrique policymakersâ prioritization of âstabilityâ - of prices, as well as of the CFA francâs fixed exchange rate with the franc/euro. In the viciously circular logic of the CFA system, this stability can only be sustained by the continuation of the franc zone and Franceâs âtutelage.â In pursuit of stability, the CFA central banks have long adopted monetary policies precisely opposite to the development needs of the nations and people they are officially meant to serve. Stifling domestic credit is but one way in which broad-based, widely-shared economic growth has been sacrificed to meet the rigid prescriptions of North Atlantic experts. In that respect, the CFA franc system has ensured economic stability in FranÃ§afrique: the stabilization of raw material exportation and goods importation, hierarchy and indirect rule, parasitic accumulation and mass impoverishment, in short, the colonial order.\n\nThe Colonial Playbook\n\nAnd all along, France has found - or compelled, coerced, and more-or-less directly put in place - useful political partners in FranÃ§afrique. In the 1950s, to avoid anticolonial wars like those in Madagascar, Vietnam, and Algeria, or like the British faced in Kenya, France cultivated favorable African allies before âgranting the sub-Saharan colonies an independence that would be preemptively devoid of any real substanceâ (16). The CFA franc has been central to the French strategy of decolonization-in-name-only, providing auxiliary benefits for some wealthy Africans. Rather than (or, perhaps, alongside) briefcases full of cash from French envoys, the CFA currency system itself has enabled African elites to import with greater purchasing-power and, with the free movement of capital in the franc zone, to âstash their legally gained or not fortunes abroadâ (93; cf. Ndikumana & Boyce 2011). In Xala subalterns are able to curse the corrupt elite and perform an ultimate comeuppance - âXala,â in Wolof, names the sexual impotence cast upon El Hadji by the leader of a chorus of landless beggars (dispossessed, in fact, through a fraud perpetrated by a younger El Hadji on his way up the business ladder). In actuality, France has frequently leveraged its financial, diplomatic, and military capacities to insulate friendly African governments against popular challenge and opposition movements.\n\nWhen and where demands for self-determination and changes to the monetary system (usually more minor than exit or abolition) have been strongest, from charismatic leaders or from below, they have been met with a retaliatory response from France and its African partners, frequently going so far as âdestabilisation campaigns and even assassinations and coups dâÃ©tatâ (40). In one chapter, Pigeaud and Sylla recount a stunning history of anticolonial critique and colonial retribution.Â\n\nThe first case is exemplary. In 1958, Ahmed SÃ©kou TourÃ© helped lead Guinea to independence, though his stirring rhetoric (âWe prefer to be poor in freedom than rich in slaveryâ) was more radical than his reform ambitions (41). Guinea was alone in voting down De Gaulleâs âCommunityâ proposal, and after the fizzling of negotiations with France for how Guinea might stay in the CFA zone with relaxed rules, the new state established its own national currency and central bank by 1960. Although other courses of action were considered by different French authorities, the decision was ultimately made to make Guinea a cautionary tale for the rest of FranÃ§afrique. French counter-intelligence officials plotted and hired out a series of mercenary attacks (âwith the aim of creating a climate of insecurity and, if possible, overthrowing SÃ©kou TourÃ©,â recalled one such operative), in conjunction with âOperation Persil,â a scheme to flood the Guinean economy with false Guinean bills, successfully bringing about a devastating crash (43). De Gaulleâs Prime Minister Georges Pompidou declared Guineaâs experience of independence âsuicidal,â naturalizing as invisible his governmentâs hand in the chaos (43). Yet, SÃ©kou TourÃ© was never removed, only ostracized - unlike Sylvanus Olympio in Togo or Modiba Keita in Mali, others whose (initially minor) desired changes to the CFA status quo were refused and rebuffed and who were then deposed in French-linked coups. A coup in Guinea in September 2021 has been connected to French and U.S. AFRICOM training, as have other recent coups across the continent (Moro 2021).\n\nIn the CFA zone, the France-aligned status quo has claimed the mantle of unity, leaving those who would chart a new course alone and more vulnerable to consequences (however manufactured). Indeed, in 1958, future president of CÃ´te dâIvoire and longtime French ally FÃ©lix HouphouÃ«t-Boigny had warned (the French), âIf France gives preference to those who secede from the Community over those who choose to remain, the example of Guinea will spread like wildfireâ (41). Pigeaud and Sylla describe HouphouÃ«t-Boigny and Senegalese president LÃ©opold SÃ©dar Senghor as âcomplicitâ in Franceâs assault on Guinea, choosing the compromising stability and ersatz solidarity of the CFA franc zone over a more radical break from the colonial order.Â\n\nTraditions\n\nIn an essay on Xala and the role of intellectuals in political struggle, Cedric Robinson (1980: 149) mused that âthe petite-bourgeoisie alone are not a fit subject matter for the committed artist or the social critic.â It is too easy to chide and condemn them, he wrote. Members of that class veer âtoo close to self-parody in their immersion in petty corruption, petty politics, petty morality and the âbrief-caseâ independence with which they are so intimately associated.â But it is not the measure of men at their smallest and most crooked that SembÃ¨ne ultimately pursues in Xala nor Pigeaud and Sylla in Africaâs Last Colonial Currency.Â\n\nSimilarly, the task Robinson (1980: 152) described as âstripping away the faÃ§ade of political power to reveal the persistence of foreign dominationâ is only part of SembÃ¨neâs project, and Pigeaud and Syllaâs after him. Xalaâs briefcase-dealing Frenchmen and their real-life equivalents in the French Treasury, diplomatic corps, and ÃlysÃ©e Palace werenât/arenât puppet masters pulling strings, but agents who cajole and threaten and plot and mask. In Pigeaud and Syllaâs account, all actors are on a stage not of their making, entrenched in histories and systems that exceed any oneâs full awareness or control.\n\nBoth Xala and Africaâs Last Colonial Currency, then, make visible relations in which colonial rule has persisted even in its apparent absence, profit has flowed even from poverty, and dreams and projects of freedom have flowered even under domination. In Xalaâs dispossessed and their curse, a weapon of the weak, Robinson (1980: 154) recognized âthe spiritual and moral consciousness formed by African peoples in their effort to come to terms with their historical experience,â anticipating his idiosyncratic formulation of âthe Black Radical Traditionâ (Robinson [1983] 2000). Pigeaud and Syllaâs finest contribution is foregrounding a Black radical tradition in FranÃ§afrique, expressed in popular anticolonial movements as well as in a critical political economy but often blurring distinctions between struggle and study.\n\nAfter all, the most eloquent, incisive critique of the CFA franc system - deeply influential for Pigeaud and Syllaâs own approach (Sylla 2012) - comes from a 1985 interview with Thomas Sankara, then president of Burkina Faso before being assassinated two years later. In one brief response, Sankara illuminated the position of âthe African peasantâ alongside that of âthe French capitalist mercantile bourgeoisie,â identified the CFA franc âmonetary monopolyâ as the system structuring their relations, and articulated why BurkinabÃ© fought âto build an independent and self-sufficient economyâ (59; Sankara [1988] 2007). The martyred Sankara remains legendary in Pan-Africanist political spheres, but Africaâs Last Colonial Currency brings his still-relevant analysis and still-remarkable worldview to bear on discussions of international political economy so long rendered technical, esoteric, and (falsely) value-neutral.\n\nSo too the Cameroonian economist Joseph Tchundjang Pouemi, an even more overlooked figure since his death at the age of 47 in 1984. Pouemiâs experience working at the IMF in the 1970s led him to recognize that the leaders of the international monetary system would ârepress any government that tries to offer their country a minimum of wellbeingâ (60) and could do so especially easily in FranÃ§afrique because of the CFA franc. After leaving the IMF, Pouemi (1980) wrote Monnaie, servitude, libertÃ©: la rÃ©pression monÃ©taire de lâAfrique, called a âmasterpieceâ by Pigeaud and Sylla but never yet translated into English. Africaâs Last Colonial Currency helps recover and circulate the late Pouemiâs work, emphasizing his foundational insights into the CFA zoneâs operations along with his demands for monetary sovereignty and the abolition of the CFA franc and FranÃ§afrique system. Pouemiâs overarching insistence, however, was that the CFA franc was egregious but not exceptional: Africans in and beyond the franc zone were deprived of sovereignty in the international monetary system through a range of instruments - and, in the decades since his death, have remained so. Pouemiâs insights will be essential to any post-CFA franc future, for liberation will require more than one colonial currency arrangementâs demise.Â\n\nPigeaud and Sylla demonstrate why and how Sankara and Pouemi should be touchstones in the critical study of money and banking, too long centered on European and American cases and theorists. Africaâs Last Colonial Currency ought to also be taken up in the overlapping (and less parochial) study of racial capitalism, for which Cedric Robinsonâs work has been foundational. But Robinson ([1983] 2000) emphasized that his account of racial capitalism and the Black radical tradition was only partial. The radical critics of the CFA franc and FranÃ§afrique should rank high among other âlineagesâ of thinking on racial capitalism deserving greater attention (Hudson 2018).Â\n\nPigeaud and Sylla themselves, however, stop short of addressing race as a feature of the franc zone. That French society and empire have claimed ârace-blind,â universalist values - a discourse long assailed by Ousmane SembÃ¨ne and contemporaries like AimÃ© CÃ©saire and Frantz Fanon, but persistently resilient (Keaton, Sharpley-Whiting, & Stovall 2012) - makes an explicit elaboration of racial formations in FranÃ§afrique and the CFA system all the more necessary. Unremarked upon by Pigeaud and Sylla, though traceable in their references, is the historical transformation of lâAfrique noire (Black Africa) into âsub-Saharan Africa,â what Jemima Pierre (2018: 15) calls the âgeographic-cum-racial division of the African continent,â even as race becomes unnamed. This division was inscribed into currency, as Franceâs colonies in âNorth Africaâ were included in the broader franc zone but never in the CFA arrangement. After independence from the French Empire in 1956, the ex-protectorates Tunisia and Morocco replaced their unique franc denominations with national currencies; Algeria, following a long and bloody anticolonial struggle, would do the same upon independence in 1962. What would a full accounting reveal of the racializing causes, effects, and evolutions of these different monetary policies?Â\n\nRace and racism color the retrenchment of colonial-capitalist relations in FranÃ§afrique, as well as any potential for change. Especially pertinent to clarify would be the roles of race - and, indeed, active race-blinding - in processes (and fantasies) of âAfricanizingâ the CFA franc, flag independence, and institutions like central banks and Chambres de Commerce (63). For âAfricanizationâ to actually amount to African monetary sovereignty, Pigeaud and Sylla argue, would require the abolition of the CFA franc system. How, then, has so much less than sovereignty been sustained for so long? Along with the financial machinations and military exploits so well documented, racial regimes are surely essential pieces of the puzzle.\n\nWhether or not Pigeaud and Sylla consider such issues beyond their mÃ©tiers, Africaâs Last Colonial Currency, with its rich empirical detail, offers ample grounds for considering them. Whatâs more, these are problems that critical political economists must take on today - as predecessors have. In the international âracist-capitalist power structure,â Bernard Magubane (1979: 3-4, 16) once wrote, race is foremost among the âpolitical and ideological systemsâ enabling âthe ruthless transfer of wealth from colonized to the colonizer, from black to white, from worker to capitalist.â That a few Black hands in FranÃ§afrique might accrue some wealth along the way makes this transfer no less ruthless, but perhaps more enduring.\n\nA tradition Pigeaud and Sylla do affiliate with is Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), a heterodox form of economics recently popularized in the U.S. and Europe by Stephanie Kelton (2020), Nathan Tankus, and others. Still, Africaâs Last Colonial Currency shows less that MMT might help diagnose the ails of the CFA franc zone than that African thinkers including Pouemi, Sankara, and Samir Amin had already formulated complementary demands for monetary sovereignty and critiques of the liberal and neoliberal orthodoxies imposed on - or made convincing to - nominally independent African governments. MMT is sometimes characterized by critics as U.S.-centric, applicable not so much to nations that print and manage their own currency but more specifically to the home of the U.S. dollar, the worldâs reserve currency. Africaâs Last Colonial Currency transcends pre-existing debates between MMTâs proponents and skeptics, modeling how to reorient the locations and frames of analysis from and through which the global economy is known. More, similar studies should follow.\n\nWhen the CFA franc someday ceases to exist, however, it wonât be accomplished solely because of the insights or influence of Pigeaud and Sylla. What they inspire may be less important than what has inspired them: the âunprecedented mobilisationâ of a ânascent popular movementâ against the CFA system, already in motion all across the CFA zone (121-122).Â\n\nSince the 2018 publication of this bookâs Francophone edition, French president Emmanuel Macron and Ivorian president Allassane Ouattara (who ascended to office after a disputed election in 2010, with the support of France and much of the âinternational communityâ) have proposed additional Africanizing reforms and a new name for the CFA franc, the âeco.â The âeco,â not coincidentally, is also the name of the proposed currency of ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States, long the regional counterweight to FranÃ§afrique institutions. Whether the ECOWAS âecoâ should replace the FranÃ§afrique âeco,â or independent national currencies should replace any federation, Pigeaud and Sylla are most concerned that the fundamental principles of colonial finance be entirely up-ended.Â\n\nNo matter the co-optations and other maneuvers still in store: âthe fight,â Pigeaud and Sylla insist, âfor economic and monetary sovereignty in the service of the prosperity of the African people can only continueâ (144). The more things change, that fight will remain.\n\n[1]Â By comparison, in the sterling area of Britainâs colonies, the West African sterling held half the value of a British pound, nearly opposite the CFA franc/French franc exchange rate. Nevertheless, see Tinashe Nyamunda (2017) on Britainâs own attempts in the 1940s âto resuscitate the imperial economy on the back of African colonies, especially under pressure to settle dominionsâ sterling balances.â\n\nReferences\n\nBlack Alliance for Peace (2020) âWhy We Focus on Africa.â Black Agenda Report.
