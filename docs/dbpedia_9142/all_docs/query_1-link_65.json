        "text": "BNP Paribas El-Djazaïr was launched in 2002 and is one of only a few international banks in Algeria. The bank has actively developed its capabilities, which include card issuing and acquiring, and has become a reliable and trusted partner both for corporations and retail customers, with 13 business centres supporting both Algerian companies operating internationally and foreign companies doing business in the country.\n\nBNP Paribas is one of the top 3 retail banks in sub-Saharan Africa with a well-established African network across 9 countries: Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Senegal, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Gabon and Mali. The bank offers a full range of products and services, with an experienced sales, support and product teams across 676 branches and 36 corporate business centres.\n\nAlgeria is largely a cash-based economy. Payment card penetration rate is low but rising as consumers become more comfortable using cards as a payment method. For example, in Q1 2021, there were 1,782,213 internet transactions carried out by CIB and Edahabia cards, a 340.65% increase on the same period 2020. Value rose from DZD 634 million to DZD 2.2 billion.\n\nThe government is keen to encourage the use of electronic payments and as such in September 2020, made the use of all electronic payments free of charge. As of 31 December 2020, all merchants were required to set up infrastructure to enable cashless transactions. Merchants without the means to receive electronic payments are required to set up a remote payment service, i.e. the TPE QR Code, by end-2021.\n\nLimited electronic banking services are available from some banks. These services are primarily used by larger companies. There is no national electronic banking system in Algeria, so companies use banks’ proprietary services.\n\nLimited online and mobile banking services are provided by the country’s leading banks. The use of digital financial services is low: 16% of adults use digital payments."
