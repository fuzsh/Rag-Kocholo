        "text": "PARIS — On June 11, 1957, at 11 p.m., French soldiers burst into Maurice Audin’s apartment in Algiers. Mr. Audin, a 25-year-old mathematician, just had time to tell his wife, Josette, “Take care of the children” before being marched down the staircase by two paratroopers.\n\nThose were the last words she heard from him. Neither she nor their three children, then 3 years old, 18 months and 1 month, ever saw him again.\n\nFor the next 61 years, Ms. Audin, helped by French intellectuals, fought to have the facts established about her husband, who was a member of the Algerian Communist Party and an antiwar activist. The French Army said he had escaped while being transferred. The truth was more sinister: In a 1958 book based on witness accounts, the historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet revealed that Mr. Audin was tortured by the military and died either as a result of his treatment or by summary execution.\n\nThousands of Algerians similarly went missing during their war for independence from 1954 to 1962, and for six decades France had nothing to say about those disappearances. Finally, on Sept. 13, President Emmanuel Macron paid a visit to Josette Audin, now 87, at her home in Bagnolet, a Paris suburb, to seek forgiveness and tell her and her children, “in the name of the French Republic,” what they knew all along: that the official version was a lie and that Mr. Vidal-Naquet had been right — although the precise cause of Mr. Audin’s death is still unknown."
