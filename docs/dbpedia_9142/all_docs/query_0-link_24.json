        "text": "Central Banks\n\nA central bank is the entity responsible for the monetary policy of a country or of a group of member states. In addition to distributing banknotes and coinage, it is primarily responsible for maintaining the stability of the currency and managing interest rates.\n\nIn the case of the French region, these banks were resposible for managing trade and relations between global regions and Paris. The central banks often issued notes in common designs (\"omnibus\" issues) across broad geographic regions different from the countries we now have on our maps or paper money catalogs.\n\nViewing the notes sorted by central bank or by omnibus rather than country is often more enlightening, and clears up the source of the common designs. I have provided below a list of the relevant central banks, each with a link to the banknotes produced by that bank.\n\nFrance Region\n\nCountries in this region:\n\nFrance\n\n.\n\nLa Banque Royale\n\nIn 1716, John Law created the Banque Générale (Banque Générale Privée), a private bank which was quickly nationalized and renamed Banque Royale. Along with Louis XV providing government funding, Law funded the bank and applied his own untried economic theories to this first French central bank. This was the first French Bank issuing paper money that was only partially backed by silver. After some initial success, the Banque Royale failed in 1720, just two years after its creation, having created an environment of hyper-inflation and public mistrust of a banking system.\n\nA very brief discussion of French units of currency\n\nThrough the Middle Ages to the 1200's, there was no homogeneous unit of currency used across France. France used the livre after the Roman unight of weight, and a livre was made up of 20 Sous, each divided into 12 Derniers, but the various duchies had their own version and valuation of the currency. In the 1200's, King Philip II began France's standardization to the Livre Tournois (Livre made in Tours, symbol \"₶\"). The Livre Tournois lasted until 1795, when France introduced the franc (valued at 1₶, 3d).\n\nDuring this period, French coinage was issued in francs, écu, écu d'or, and gros d'argent, which all had monetary equivalents to the livre and dernier, though the livre tournois was the standard for large transactions.\n\nThis bank issued notes for\n\nFrance\n\n.\n\nAssemblée Nationale\n\nIn December of 1789, the National Assembly of the revolutionary government authorized the issuance of bonds, called Assignats, backed by sized royal and church properties (\"Domaines Nationaux\"). These were not initially intended to be used as currency, but as a way for the state to pay its debts, and for a time were successful. Within a year, with the country's economy in need of support, the Assignat was converted to legal tender. The Assignat was used through the rest of the revolution until its complete collapse in February 1797.\n\nThis bank issued notes for\n\nFrance\n\n.\n\nBanque de France\n\nThe third, and finally successful, French Central Bank is the Banque de France (BdF). It was formed by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1800 and marked the return to the Franc, based on value of gold and silver once again. BdF has provided financial oversight (often called the \"bank of banks\") for all of France's territories through the years, coordinating with the central banks listed below, and stabilizing exchange rates from French Francs to CFA, CFP and now Euros. The Banque de France is one of the few central banks that actually prints its own banknotes, with facilities in Chamalières, France.\n\nThis bank issued notes for\n\nFrance\n\n.\n\nIndochina Region\n\nCountries in this region:\n\nNew Hebrides\n\nFrench India\n\nFrench Indochina\n\nFrench Somaliland\n\nNew Caledonia\n\nTahiti\n\nCambodia\n\nLaos\n\nSouth Vietnam\n\n.\n\nComptoirs Français des Nouvelles-Hébrides\n\nThis bank issued notes for\n\nNew Hebrides\n\n.\n\nBanque de l'Indochine\n\nThe Banque de l'Indochine was founded in 1875, and initially operated in China, Saigon (Vietnam), French India and Cochinchina (Vietnam). The bank expanded over the years to include Tonkin (Vietnam), Haiphong (Vietnam), Phnom Penh (Cambodia), Tahiti and Singapore. A branch was even opened in Djibouti. Banque de l'Indochine branches were eventually closed or acquired by other banks starting in the 1940's. Virtually all banknotes were provided by Banque de France, denominated in Francs or Piastres.\n\nThis bank issued notes for\n\nFrench India\n\nFrench Indochina\n\nFrench Somaliland\n\nNew Caledonia\n\nNew Hebrides\n\nTahiti\n\n.\n\nTrésorerie de Nouméa\n\nThis bank issued notes for\n\nNew Caledonia\n\n.\n\nTrésor Public, Cóte Française des Somalis\n\nThis bank issued notes for\n\nFrench Somaliland\n\n.\n\nInstitut d'Émission des États du Cambodge, du Laos et du Viet-Nam\n\nIn 1951, the responsibility for issuance of banknotes was transfered to The Institut d’Émission des États du Cambodge du Laos et du Viet-Nam, which issued individual notes for the three states: Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.\n\nThis bank issued notes for\n\nFrench Indochina\n\n.\n\nBanque Nationale du Cambodge\n\nAlong with Cambodia's independence from France in 1954, the Banque Nationale du Cambodge was created to replace the Institut d’Emission des Etats du Cambodge du Laos et du Vietnam.\n\nThis bank issued notes for\n\nCambodia\n\n.\n\nBanque Nationale du Laos\n\nLaos gained full independence from France in 1954, and the Banque Nationale du Laos assumed central banking functions from the Institut d’Emission des Etats du Cambodge du Laos et du Vietnam.\n\nThis bank issued notes for\n\nLaos\n\n.\n\nNational Bank of Vietnam\n\nVietnam became independent from France in 1954.
