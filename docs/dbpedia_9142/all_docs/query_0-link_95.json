Here is our answer!\n\nThe verdict, our Revolution will return it\n\nWe are determined that Algeria should live,\n\nSo be our witness - be our witness - be our witness!\n\n4.\n\nFrom our heroes we shall make an army come to being,\n\nFrom our dead we shall build up a glory,\n\nOur spirits shall ascend to immortality\n\nAnd on our shoulders we shall raise the Standard.\n\nTo the nation's Liberation Front we have sworn an oath,\n\nWe are determined that Algeria should live,\n\nSo be our witness - be our witness - be our witness\n\n5.\n\nThe cry of the Fatherland sounds from the battlefields.\n\nListen to it and answer the call!\n\nLet it be written with the blood of martyrs\n\nAnd be read to future generations.\n\nOh, Glory, we have held out our hand to you,\n\nWe are determined that Algeria should live,\n\nSo be our witness - be our witness - be our witness"
