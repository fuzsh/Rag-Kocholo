One of these items may be requested.\n\nMake the payment for your money transfer to Algeria in cash or by card.\n\nYou will find your MTCN (money transfer control number) on your receipt. Be sure to share it with the receiver.\n\nPlease note that it is also possible to start the process online and pay in person at an agent location within 24 hours.\n\nCompare the transfer fees3 corresponding to each payment method, and check EUR/DZD exchange rates using our fees estimation tool. You will also be able to see estimated transfer times. For example, transfers from France paid in cash can be withdrawn in Algeria in just a few minutes1.\n\nPlease bear in mind that the payment method chosen may affect the delivery time for the funds. For example, a money transfer to Algeria paid in cash can arrive in a few minutes1, but this can take three business days when paid for by bank transfer."
