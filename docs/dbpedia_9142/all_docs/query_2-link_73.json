        "text": "Relations between Paris and Algiers, prone to cyclical fluctuations, have entered a cooling period with President Abdelmadjid Tebboune announcing the decision on Wednesday, February 8, to recall the Algerian ambassador in France \"for consultations.\" The prickly gesture is a response to the actions of the French embassy in Tunis on Monday of helping Algerian opposition figure Amira Bouraoui to avoid extradition to Algeria from Tunisia. Bouraoui, who also holds a French passport, had entered Tunisia illegally three days earlier in order to take refuge.\n\nThrough consular assistance in Paris, the journalist obtained Tunisian President Kais Saied's permission to leave Tunisian territory, and she was able to board a flight to Lyon. Her exile is just one of many examples of the intensifying crackdown in Algeria against any key participants in the Hirak, the protest movement that engulfed the country in 2019 and 2020, in which Bouraoui was involved.\n\nIn a statement, President Tebboune denounced the role played by France, calling it an \"illegal and secret evacuation of an Algerian national\" wanted by Algerian courts. In another statement, the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs \"strongly condemned the violation of national sovereignty by French diplomatic, consular and security officials.\" In a sign of the prevailing anger surrounding this matter among official Algerian circles, the pro-regime daily L'Expression berated \"the spook-like behavior\" of French diplomats.\n\nSome form of appeasement\n\nThe incident throws off balance the increasingly warm relations between the two countries over the last six months, which had been an incredible, albeit staged, diplomatic achievement. President Emmanuel Macron's visit to Algiers in late August 2022, followed by Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne's six weeks later accompanied by a dozen ministers, were a display of the French president's solemn desire to rekindle a bilateral relationship that had turned sour following his remarks on Algeria's \"political-military system\" having been built on political exploitation of contemporary history and a \"hatred for France.\" At an event held in September 2021 at the Elysée Palace for young people from families who had experienced the Algerian War, these statements, which also questioned the existence of \"the Algerian nation before French colonization,\" provoked fury from Algiers which froze all cooperation with Paris for many months.\n\nEventually, some form of appeasement was reached when both Macron and Borne visited Algiers, giving reconciliation its full chance. The message then being conveyed by both capitals was that relations should now be part of a \"current of irreversible progress.\""
