        "text": "Rahul Mahajan and wife Natalya Ilina are all set to participate in Star Plus show ‘Smart Jodi’ which is a one-of-a-kind reality show which will judge the compatibilities of various celebrity couples. The show is set to hit the tube from 26th February 2022.\n\nIndia Forums got in touch with Rahul and quizzed him about his participation in the show. Consedering Mahajan’s failed marriages and controversies related to the same, we asked him wheather he was skeptical signing the show. He said, “I wasn’t skeptical at all. In fact, I’ll be opening more about me, my marriage, my past, my history and everything that I’ve not spoken until now on ‘Smart Jodi’. I’ll be explaining about the issues in my past relationships exposing what actually happened. This show is a place where I’ll find my closure for many things in the past”.\n\nHe added, “Amongst Natalia and me, I was more excited for the show as I’ve done a few reality shows and I know the format, I also know the channel and team. It’s going to be different for Natalia as she has never done a reality show before. She was a little skeptical and hesitant as it’s a new experience for her altogether”.\n\nI’ll be opening more about me, my marriage, my past, my history and everything that I’ve not spoken until now on ‘Smart Jodi’. I’ll be explaining about the issues in my past relationships exposing what actually happened. This show is a place where I’ll find my closure for many things in the past.\n\n-\n\nTalking about the experience on the show so far, Rahul said, “I was very happy when I was offered the show and I wholeheartedly signed the show majorly to enjoy, look good with great outfits and share the insights of the relationship and also hear other couples stories and journeys of their relationship. I’m really glad to be a part of this show as compared to any other reality shows that I’ve done and I mean it”.\n\nHe added, “All the other couples are amazing. Even we don’t meet and talk every day, there’s still a connect. I got in touch with it a few people who’re my friends for the past. Vikas, Anita, Arjun. Every couple is unique, there is no repetitions in the stories of these couples and it’s great to know each of them. I’ve not enjoyed any other show this much. It’s too good to be true”.\n\nApart from Rahul-Natalya, popular celebrity couples like Neil Bhatt- Aishwarya Sharma, Monalisa Biswas- Vikrant Singh Rajput, Bhagyashree – Himalaya Dasaani, Arjun Bijlani- Neha Bijlani, Ankita Lokhande- Vicky Jain, Gaurav Taneja – Ritu Taneja, K. Srikkanth – Vidya Srikkanth, Ankit Tiwari- Pallavi Shukla will also participate in the show."
