        "text": "Rahul Mahajan tied the knot for the third time this week with Kazakhstan model Natalya Ilina in a private ceremony on November 20. He was earlier married to pilot Shweta Singh and actress-model and former Bigg Boss contestant Dimpy Ganguly. Both the marriages ended on a rather acrimonious note. However, Dimpy when asked about her former husband's third-time nuptials only wished him the best. In a statement to SpotboyE, she said, \"Oh! Haha! On a serious note, I am glad to know that! And hope he really finds happiness this time around... like I have done. Many Congratulations to the newlyweds.\" She also praised her former husband's courage and faith in the institution. \"Well, I just know how one broken marriage can affect you and he had two. Still, he still believes in the institution. That says something about his optimism.\"\n\nThe lady also spoke about how it was her childhood familiarity with Rohit Roy, which gave her the confidence to marry him and have a new start in life. They are parents to Reanna. Dimpy also said that domestic abuse was the worst thing in a relationship and hoped Rahul would not be violent with Natalya. She also said that people change with time and maybe he had for the better. \"Hmm... but maybe it won't be/is not like that with her. People can change you know. For the sake of both, I really hope all that doesn't happen. It's the worst thing one can do to another,\" she told the portal.\n\nThey were married for four years from 2010 to 2014 when it ended after Dimpy alleged that he would beat her up.
