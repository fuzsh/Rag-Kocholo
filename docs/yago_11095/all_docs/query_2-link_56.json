In the past, Rahul who has a larger than life image and got involved in controversies several times from accusations of domestic violence by his former wives Shweta Singh and Dimpy Ganguly.

After all this, Rahul has taken to spirituality and got married to a Russian named Natalya Ilina Mahajanin 2018. Natalya Ilina happens to be 18 years younger than him. Rahul, who had participated in the show in 2008, revealed to ETimes, that Natalya has converted to Hinduism. He was quoted as saying that the couple is like two tracks of the railway. “We do not interfere in each other’s matters too much and give each other space. We are not even too apart from each other. But we maintain the balance so that our marriage is on the right track,” said. His wife is a Russian and converted to Hindu, revealed the reality TV star. “I always give her the reference of Lord Shiva and Parvati. I always tell her that the husband and wife’s relationship should be like Shiv and Parvati. We keep them as our idols in our relationship. I teach her Bhagavad Gita and we read a lot of mythological stuff together. I feel you really need a good destiny to find a perfect partner and family,\" added Mahajan. Mahajan also stressed that this time he would like to stay away from women in the Bigg Boss 14 house unlike in the past. Rahul said, \"I am happily married to Natalya Ilina and want to steer clear of all the women in the house. I am done with link-ups and don’t want any more fake friendships in the house.\"\n\nFollow Entertainment News on ABP Live for more latest stories and trending topics.
