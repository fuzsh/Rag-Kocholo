        "text": "TV star Rahul Mahajan and his model wife Natalya Ilina are allegedly heading for a divorce after four years of marriage.\n\nThe former power couple are reportedly separating over \"compatibility issues\" but neither party has commented on the divorce rumours.\n\nAn insider source claimed that the Indian TV personality, 48, and Kazakhstan model Natalya, 30, parted ways last year and have filed for a divorce, ETimes reports.\n\n\"Compatibility issues were there between the two since the beginning. However, they stretched their marriage as long as they could,\" the source said.\n\nRahul has not confirmed or denied the divorce, but told the outlet: \"I want to keep my private life private.\n\n\"I would not like to comment on anything.\"\n\nHe added: \"By the way, I'm doing well.\"\n\nThe duo allegedly filed the paperwork last year, but it is unclear if the divorce has been finalised or is still underway.\n\nNatalya was Rahul's third wife after previously being married to Shweta Singh (2006-2008) and fellow reality star and model Dimpy Ganguly (2010-2015).\n\nA close friend of the Bigg Boss star said that he was heartbroken over his third divorce but is now recovering.\n\n\"He was absolutely shattered after the break up. Now he is doing fine. He is getting back to life. He was not in a great state last year.\"\n\nThe unnamed source added that he was \"hoping to find love\" again.\n\nRahul appeared on multiple seasons of the controversial Big Boss show.\n\nHe was last seen on the couple's reality show Smart Jodi alongside Natalya last year.\n\nIt comes as another Bigg Boss star has been slammed on social media over an \"inappropriate\" semi-naked video.\n\nHasbulla rival Abdu Rozik, 19, posted a comedy sketch on his Instagram account titled \"Three in Bed\", but it didn't sit very well with the public.\n\nMeanwhile, Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer has sparked fury in India after a sacred Hindu verse was recited during a sex scene in the blockbuster film.\n\nThe phrase has been branded a \"scathing attack on Hinduism\" as the movie continues to smash box office predictions."
