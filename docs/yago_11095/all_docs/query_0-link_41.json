        "text": "The boom in reality shows on Indian television has created desi versions of Paris Hiltons and Kim Kardashians - celebs whose claim to fame is reality TV. The US and the UK has its own bunch of reality TV stars and India is not far behind, what with popular shows like Bigg Boss and Swayamvar creating stars out of Rahul Mahajan and Monica Bedi. Rahul, who had a controversial image in the media following a much-publicised divorce and charges of drug possession and consumption, finds reality shows a way to connect with people.\n\n“These reality shows have given me a way of connecting with people. They know me as Rahul Mahajan, and not as a character in some soap. And when kids you and ask for your autograph, it feels good. Showbiz is my way of making a living till 2014 and then I am planning to take a plunge in politics,” Rahul Mahajan said.\n\nHis journey on reality TV started with Bigg Boss - Season 2 and then he went on to judge a children’s dance show. Rahul also chose his second wife, Dimpy Ganguly, by conducting a Swayamvar followed by a public wedding on television.\n\nFor Monica Bedi, who also started off with Bigg Boss - Season 2 on television, it is a way of finding her feet back in showbiz after her failed acting career that was followed by the debacle in her personal life, with the arrest of her husband and underworld don Abu Salem.\n\n“Reality shows have been lucky for me. The amount of love and respect I have got due to these shows, I did not get from the 21 films I did as main lead. I have got much more attention through these 2-3 reality shows,” Monica said. The actress is currently starring in Desi Girl on Imagine TV, which will go on air soon and has plans to star in another show.\n\n“Reality shows offer fame and recognition and more importantly, a way of connecting with people and audience easily, something that was not available earlier. They do not just showcase a professional entertainer but the person behind the profession too. It makes them real and approachable,” said Yardi.\n\nAnother celebrity who shot to fame through these reality shows is the controversy and drama queeen Rakhi Sawant. The lady, who has featured in more than five reality shows, started her feat with Nach Baliye 3, went on to do Big Boss - season 1. She also chose her fiance Elesh Parujanwala through Swayamvar and went on to do Pati, Patni aur Woh with him, before breaking up. Currently she appears in Zara Nach Ke Dikha 2."
