        "text": "Former \"Bigg Boss\" contestant Dimpy Ganguly has become the proud mother of a baby girl. The television personality took to Instagram to announce the news with a picture flaunting her baby bump.\n\nDimpy, who is Rahul Mahajan's ex-wife, married Dubai-based businessman Rohit Roy in November 2015. Dimpy expressed her excitement with the Instagram post as she announced the early arrival of her first child.\n\nShe has also said her baby girl has been named Reanna. Earlier, Dimpy had revealed about her pregnancy by sharing an adorable picture with her hubby and flaunting her baby bump.\n\nNow she has announced the good news with the caption: \"Our baby girl Reanna decided to come to us early with 100000 hugs 2000000 kisses and million cuddles waiting for her on 20th of June early morning..lighting our world up like eternal Christmas! I would like to thank all my friends and family for being with us through this journey and God almighty for blessing us and praying that He guides me on this new journey of parenthood every step of the way! Dugga! Dugga! Thank you daddypie @acidxxx for capturing this moment! Love you! [sic].\"\n\nBefore appearing on \"Bigg Boss 8\" in 2014, Dimpy had become popular after she had married Rahul Mahajan on the reality show \"Rahul Dulhania Le Jayega\" in 2010. But the marriage did not work out. Later Rohit proposed to Dimpy with a diamond ring and the duo had a grand wedding. Pictures of their marriage had gone viral on social media."
