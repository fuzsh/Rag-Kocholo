        "text": "According to reports, the makers of the show have approached \"Bigg Boss\" ex-contestant Rahul Mahajan for the fifth wild-card entrant. Rahul's estranged wife Dimpy Mahajan is already creating drama in the show and if reports are to be believed than the former pilot will soon join the league.\n\n\"The makers have approached some of the ex-contestants; especially who had created lot of buzz in the house. This list includes names like Rahul Mahajan, Sambhavna Seth, Dolly Bindra, Imam Siddique and Ajaz Khan. Rahul is almost been finalized; the final dots are yet to be signed. Talks are still going on with the other contestants,\" Daily Bhaskar quoted a source as saying.\n\nEarlier, there were reports that the show will be extended by a month and several other ex-contestants, including Imam Siddique, Dolly Bindra, and Ajaz Khan will make an entry in the reality show. The television ratings of \"BB8\" is comparatively lower than the last few seasons and thus makers are planning to bring in the controversial celebrities.\n\n\"The show is not at all getting the TRP, so to cope up with the sponsors; the makers have decided to extend the show for a month. Also they feel that bringing some old contestants back will surely impress the audience; especially bringing Rahul Mahajan and Dimpy under one roof after their divorce news will be the best twist so far in this season.\"?"
