        "text": "Earlier this week, former Bigg Boss contestant Rahul Mahajan tied the knot with Kazakhstan model Natalya Ilina. Soon after the wedding, pictures from the low-key ceremony had gone viral on social media. Social media is filled with mixed reactions from best wishes to people questioning the age gap between the two or that it’s Rahul’s third marriage. Amidst this, a Spotboye report revealed what his ex-wife Dimpy Ganguly had to say about his recent wedding.\n\nOn a serious note, I am glad to know that! And hope he really finds happiness this time around… like I have done. Many Congratulations to the newlyweds.\n\nHaving said that, she also praised Rahul’s courage to get married once again.\n\nI have to give the man credit for his courage! I just know how one broken marriage can affect you and he had two. Still, he still believes in the institution. That says something about his optimism.\n\nAfter her separation from Rahul, she married businessman Rohit Roy. She is also has a daughter, Reanna Roy.\n\nRahul’s last two marriage had ended in accusations of violence and domestic abuse.\n\nBut Dimpy said,\n\nMaybe it won’t be/is not like that with her. People can change you know. For the sake of both, I really hope all that doesn’t happen. It’s the worst thing one can do to another.\n\nMeanwhile talking to a leading daily, Rahul had disclosed the reason why he had such an intimate wedding ceremony. He revealed that he previously had two grand weddings but none of them worked out and hence the couple had opted for a low-key affair. The couple has reportedly known each other for a year."
