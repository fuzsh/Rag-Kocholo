        "text": "Finally after much of publicity stuunts Rahul Mahajan got married to Ms. Dimpy Ganguly a 20 year old model actress in bengali style wedding. Those who were following the show religiously might had already figured out who the bride would be…\n\nOne questions always cropped in my mind right from the day the show started.. what is Rahul Mahajan. A son of late Mr. Pramod Mahajan. According to Media is spoilt brat. a 34 year old divorced becuase of physically abusing his wife who was his childhood love, a brat in Big Boss whose passport is held by Indian govt because of possesion of drugs and not allowed to leave the country. Also his family background is worth taking into account, father actively into politics, mother a social worker,sister actively into politics after father death. Father killed by his own brother Pravin Mhajan over some family issues and currently in prison and demised after brain hammeroage.\n\nHardly a background for idle arrange amrriages in India where the social stigma is so hyped. Not that such persons cannot have arranged marriage but what do parents think when they send their daughters to such show???//\n\nFirstly the girls chosen by Rahul are below 30 years of age when he himslef is 34 year old. One should consider this age gap between a girl and boy before getting married. How did the girls parents agree to this alliance.\n\nWhen the parents already know he background of Rahul Mahajan why parents allow their daughters to get into such reality shows?????\n\nSecondly all the girls are from modelling and acting field are he norms of actual marriage laid down by the parents itself.?\n\nAccording to the recent show three girls where chosen as finalist, Dimpy Ganguly from Bengal, Nikung Malik from Haryana and Punjabi girl Harpereet. All of them extremly beautifull and talented. why did they get into the show for such alliance is a big question??????/\n\n20 girls spent almost over 5 weeks in particpating for Rahuls Swayamvar … for Rahul it is just 5 weeks as he is used to this kind of life but what abou tthe other girls will they be hapy to return to happy normal life again ? will they readjust themselves again..after getting so intimate with rahul emotionally as most of the girls literally fell head over heels in love????????? what about them…?\n\nAs for now, new s came up that Harpreet is ready for 1 year contract marriage with Rahul Mahajan as the show promises actual swayamvar of Rahul with one of the girl in show..if this news is believed how did the parents agree to this.????????????????\n\nAs for now Nikunj who looked more sensible and matured comapred to another finalists is again coming back to senses and deciding not to marry Rahul due to his flirt manner and other habits… didnt she realise this before however she is no quitting the show…\n\nOne more thing the girl or her parents dont know whether the girl is actually goign to get married to rahul or being dumped by Rahul on national tv. How would the girl feel when shes beingr ejected by Rahul and still wish him all the best wishes in life when they are competing to become bride.. what about the reputation of family and girl after being dumped?????????\n\nWhats the actual scenne between these contestants and their family ? Are they willing to take risk on their hard earned reputation for small amount of money and fame? Is Rahul Mahajan that worth??????????"
