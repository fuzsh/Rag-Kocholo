So, I made that choice of moving away.\"\n\nDimpy Ganguly talks about the negativity she received after her divorce\n\nDimpy had received a lot of criticism and hatred post her divorce from Rahul Mahajan as people left no stone unturned to troll the actress.

Dimpy added:\n\n\"The initial years were hard because I had to start from scratch. I relocated and we started everything fresh. So it was hard. The only way to do it was to completely disconnect. That's why there was a period of complete silence from my life. I didn't want to talk to anybody, I didn't want to do anything. Even though I had time, I didn't take up any project. I just wanted some time to heal and to figure out my way ahead, start a new life. Once I was in a happy space again, then I came out. I made friends, I did things that I used to do.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nDimpy Ganguly on finding love again in her life\n\nFast forward to today, Dimpy Ganguly is living the perfect life with her second husband, Rohit Roy, and their three beautiful kids, Reanna, Aryan and Rishaan.

She added:\n\n\"There was not much thinking into it. I met him and something just felt right. Whether it was pure luck or instinctive; I can't point a finger towards one thing that made me trust him. I still can't. I met him and I felt he is the person I need to trust. There was no other thought. Rohit was my olive branch from everything that I was going through. At that point, my only friend, philosopher, guide and confidante... everything was Rohit. It was easier than having too many opinions, I only had one source from where I could draw my inspiration from. There was only one person, who knew everything about me and that made it a lot easier.\"\n\nWhat are your views about Dimpy Ganguly's revelations?
