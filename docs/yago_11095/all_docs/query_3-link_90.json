        "text": "Kolkata: Not having any qualms to turn up in her first item number in 'Escape from Taliban' director Ujjwal Chatterjee's new Bengali flick 'Swabhumi', 'Nach Boliye' star Dimpy Mahajon says she would love to give first\n\npriority to family.\n\n\"For me small roles, or even character roles are okay in feature films. No wish to join fulll-time acting as my husband Rahul Mahajan, in-laws and family will take up my time first,\" Dimpy told PTI on location of the feature film Swabhumi on land acquisition in Bengal near here yesterday.\n\nDimpy, who confirmed having no qualms to turn up in any item number, said she was okay with any eye-grabbing character in a hard core masala flick so long the character \"entices me\".\n\n\"After turning up in Shiboprosad Mukhopadhyay-Nandita Roy's 'Hello Memsaheb' this is my second outing in a Bengali film,\" she said.\n\n\"It is not a question of Rahul forcing his decision on me. He is more than happy that I am again facing the camera, I guess we have proved to be great 'jodis' in Nach Baliye 5, he knows my passion for acting. It is my decision,\" Dimpy, who and Rahul had created history as the first couple to marry on Indian reality television for a national audience, said.\n\nAffirming she felt disturbed by the turn of events during the land acquisition agitation in Bengal and moved by people's sufferings, Dimpy said \"my character, a pub dancer, tempts the land mafia at a bar and I lip-sync to a peppy Shreya Ghosal number 'lal topke gelo' choreographed by Madhaban.\"\n\nTo a question whether she and Rahul may turn up as 'naach jodis' on-screen for a future feature project, Dimpi said \"if he can match my steps on the telly and that goes high on TRPs, I think now it is the call of directors and producers\n\nto flesh out the script and story.\"\n\nBased on Mahasweta Devi's novel 'Adhoba', Swabhumi, produced by the director and Asthami Films together, revolves round the land movement of 2006-2008 Bengal but Chatterjee had to settle for another village location resembling Nandigram."
