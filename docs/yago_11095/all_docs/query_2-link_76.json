        "text": "It has always been Priyadarshani Singh's dream to marry Rahul Mahajan. So when the reality show Rahul Dulhania Le Jayega was launched on NDTV Imagine, she promptly auditioned.\n\nUnfortunately, the 24-year-old girl's dream was short-lived.\n\nPriyadarshini, who hails from Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, talks to Rajul Hegde about her elimination from the show, and who she thinks will be the future Mrs Rahul Mahajan.\n\nHow was your experience on the show?\n\nI've always dreamt of meeting Rahul Mahajan. I had a huge crush on him, so getting an opportunity to spend time with him was an experience of a lifetime. My experience on this show has been fantastic. Being in Fatehgarh was like living in a fantasy world.\n\nDo you think you got enough time to spend with Rahul Mahajan?\n\nNot really. Honestly, during my entire journey on this show, I never had a one-on-one date with Rahul. But I will not say that he was unfair to me. I made the most of whatever time I got to spend with him. Marriage is a sacred institution and it's Rahul's decision.\n\nWhy do you think you were eliminated?\n\nI think I was too honest. I wished I could be more diplomatic. I can't be fake. I always give honest opinions. That could be the reason.\n\nHow did your friends and family react to your eviction?\n\nThey were astonished. They wanted me to fulfill my dream and win.\n\nKnowing Rahul Mahajan's past, what was your family and friends' reaction when you told them about joining the show?\n\nWho doesn't have a past? My parents and friends were very supportive of me. They wanted me to fulfill my dreams.\n\nRahul had flirted openly with two girls (Payal Rohatgi and Monica Bedi) in Bigg Boss. Doesn't this pose a serious question as far as his loyalty is concerned?\n\nNot really. Healthy flirting is good.\n\nWhich were your best and worst moments on the show?\n\nI have had many good moments on the show. The best one was the first day I was introduced to Rahul. I was super excited to meet him. But when I did, I became tongue tied. I forgot what to say to him. That was the impact he had on me. It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life.\n\nThe worst one, of course, was the day I was eliminated. I was sad to see my dream coming to an end. I know I was honest but I spoke my mind. I said what I had to say. I gave my 110 percent. I have no regrets about what I said or did on the show.\n\nParticipants mostly come on such shows to gain popularity, as they aspire to become actors. Is it the same with you?\n\nOf course not. My funda for participating on this show was very clear. I wanted to get married to Rahul. Besides, I am not from the media background, so participating in this show doesn't help me in any way."
