        "text": "Mumbai:\n\nRahul Mahajan's estranged wife Dimpy, who is entering Bigg Boss 8 tonight, says she wants to become the first wild card contestant to win the reality show.\n\nDimpy, a model, shot to fame by marrying Rahul on a reality show but the marriage had its share of trouble as Rahul was accused of domestic violence by her. They reconciled only to file for divorce earlier this year. \"We have filed for divorce and that's all I would like to say at this point,\" Dimpy told PTI without divulging further details about her personal life.\n\nShe, however, did get some tips from Rahul, who was a controversial contestant on the Colors show in 2008. \"He knows about my decision. He told me to be careful as there are no friends inside the house,\" she said. As a wild card entrant, Dimpy feels her journey inside the house is going to be tough.\n\n\"No wild card entrant has won the show so far does not mean that it cannot happen in the future. Having said that, I know that it will be difficult as other contestants have already created a fanbase and their loyalties are already formed. It is very clear that the house is currently divided into two groups. I don't know which group I would join once I am inside,\" Dimpy.\n\nHaving participated in shows like Nach Baliye with Rahul, Dimpy says she is not a dramebaaz in real life. \"I am not a dramebaaz. I won't be loud. But when it comes to taking a stand, I will do that. I know when to put my foot down and protect myself. As far as contestants pulling publicity stunts to remain in the show, I can only say that it is not easy to wear a mask 24X7. It is not easy being a part of the show,\" she said.\n\nDimpy says she only knows Karishma Tanna from before and feels the TV star is not coming across as a real person."
