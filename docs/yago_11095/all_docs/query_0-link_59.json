His ex-wife Dimpy Ganguly recently got married to Dubai based businessman Rohit Roy on 27th November, 2015.

We are doing a film together which is in Tamil and Hindi. We got along very well on the set and it did not take much time to become friends. There is an amazing chemistry between us but again I am not jumping my guns to anything because I have seen lot of bad relationships. I am just hoping this relationship to turns out great. We have got few more film offers, so let’s see what happens in the future.’\n\nFurther Rahul also added saying, ‘So far, our chemistry is very positive but it’s too soon to talk about the marriage. I am not saying that I have lost trust in the institution of marriage; it’s just that I am very cautious about my relationship now.’ We hope this time the relationship turns out to be great for Rahul and we wish the duo all the happiness in the world.
