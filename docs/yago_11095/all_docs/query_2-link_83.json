        "text": "Mumbai: Buzz is that Rahul Mahajan and Monica Bedi are not too gung-ho about agreeing to feature in the next season of TV reality show Sach Ka Saamna. Both are infamous for their controversial images in public.\n\nThe channel bosses, however, are still trying to get the two celebrities to overcome their reluctance and give their nods towards the show. It is learnt that Rahul was initially positive about appearing on the show and facing some uncomfortable truths from his life.\n\n\"However, Rahul developed cold feet soon after the polygraph tests started. He was informed in advance that he'd be asked questions about his first marriage and subsequent divorce from Shweta, an air-hostess, his hospitalisation after his close associate Vivek Moitra was found dead, his tryst with reality shows and his second and much-publicised marriage to Dimpy on a TV show,\" says our source.\n\n\"We had barely started asking about such personal details when he opted to quit the polygraph tests,\" explains our source. Monica Bedi too has been dilly-dallying about her participation.\n\nAccording to our source, \"Monica is aware that she'll be asked about her relationship with Abu Salem, who's currently in prison after their extradition from Spain about five years ago. She's worried that anything she speaks, might be used as evidence against Salem and her.\n\nAlthough she has participated in a reality show previously, she was in control of how much she spoke. She has neither refused nor confirmed about giving this show a shot.\" Finally, will they or won't they? Only the two can tell."
