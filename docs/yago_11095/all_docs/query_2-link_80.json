        "text": "Seems like 'once bitten, twice shy' is not something Rahul Mahajn believes in. The ex-Bigg Boss contestant has been making it to the news in the past several years for just one reason- his relationships! The man was married twice in the past and as per reports, both his ex-wives accused him of domestic violence.\n\nHe was married to Shweta Singh and then reportedly had a brief attachment to fellow contestant Monica Bedi when they both appeared on the reality show together.\n\nLater, Rahul participated in another reality show which was a 'Swayamvar' and there he fell for the pretty Dimpy Ganguly. They were married for over 5 years but their marriage was pretty turbulent, something which Dimpy spoke about often after they separated."
