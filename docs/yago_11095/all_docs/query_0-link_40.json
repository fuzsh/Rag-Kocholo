After two failed marriages, the ex-Bigg Boss contestant married Kazakh model Natalya Ilina in 2018 in a private ceremony away from the media glare.\n\nDid Natalya actually try to set Rahul up with her mom?\n\nCredit: Rahul Mahajan, Instagram\n\nThe couple made their first public appearance on the reality show Smart Jodi and they seem to have won hearts already. On the show, Natalya shared how she was actually trying to set him up with her mother, but ended up marrying him instead.\n\nShe said, “So what happened, basically, I was trying to set him up with a friend. He had this idea of getting married again. He was looking for a bride. Once upon a time, I even tried to set him up with my mom.”\n\nTo which Rahul said, “Her mother is quite young. She is four years older than me. So, Natalya thought of setting me up with her mom because the age gap was less. Natalya and I have an age gap of 18 years.” Natalya added that her mother is quite hot, to which Rahul responded, “I made an idea that she will also look hot when she is of her mother’s age.”\n\nCredit: Rahul Mahajan, Instagram\n\nOn being asked if he will get married for the fourth time, Rahul said, “Yes, I will marry for the fourth time…with Natalya once again. The channel will get us married.”\n\nNatalya’s take on marriage\n\nCredit: Natalya Ilina Mahajan, Instagram\n\nTalking about Rahul’s failed marriages with Shweta Singh and Dimpy Ganguly, she said, “His two previous marriages were very short. It didn’t bother me much because it was more like a short-term relationship than a marriage for him. Just in a few months of marriage, you can’t call it a marriage. And even in a few years of marriage, it’s not a marriage. Marriage is something deeper.”\n\nSmart Jodi is Natalya’s first reality show and she’s already impressed the audience with her charm. The show gives the couples a chance to work with their life partners, relive the moments of their marriage and create memories.\n\nLead Image Credit: Rahul Mahajan, Instagram\n\nRead iDiva for the latest in Bollywood, fashion looks, beauty and lifestyle news."
