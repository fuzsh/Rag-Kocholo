        "text": "With forthcoming reality shows featuring Bollywood’ s most wanted, you have reason to get excited. Here is the list of some of the most popular shows that debut on TV this month and the superstars who host them.\n\nWith his latest film, ‘Dabangg’, shattering box-office records, Salman Khan has gone from the punchline to the toast of the party. Now the actor wants to solidify his standing as the big boss as he gears up to host Colors’ blockbuster reality show, a post previously held by Arshad Warsi and Amitabh Bachchan.\n\nThe show, based on UK’s ‘Big Brother’, promises to be salaciously entertaining in its fourth season with the likes of Dimpy Ganguly (Rahul Mahajan’s ex-wife) and the actor Shiney Ahuja likely to become housemates. Early reports have suggested that Khan will not try and imitate Big B’s serious hosting style, instead settling for a more jovial and casual tone.\n\nSince Colors is staying mum on all matters regarding the show, rumours have been swirling about the possible housemates (we hear Sania Mirza and Veena Malik will check in). Can’t wait, you say?\n\nFoodies unite, as the ultimate cooking contest is making its way to your telly. The Indian version of UK’s monster hit, ‘Master Chef’, will be premiering on Star Plus. The show will have amateur cooks fighting it out every week for the title of the best cook in the country.\n\nBollywood superstar Akshay Kumar recently announced that he will not only be hosting the show but will also judge it. Among the many jobs Akshay Kumar had before making it to the movies was that of a chef. In interviews, the actor has admitted that the real master chef in his life is his grandmother.\n\nHe’s back. Amitabh Bachchan, the man who made ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati’ a must-watch in 2000, will resume his role as quiz-master of the nation. Though KBC was the most viewed TV show in its first season, ratings dropped sharply in the second season and the novelty soon wore off. Even Shah Rukh Khan, who hosted the show for one season, failed to bring in the eyeballs.\n\nBut Siddhartha Basu seems to be on a mission to restore the show to its former glory. Sony TV, where the show has shifted to this season, has been aggressively campaigning since early 2010 and with over 50 lakh people registering to be part of this show. Don’t count this one out just yet.\n\nPremiering on Bloomberg, it is being touted as the biggest business reality show in the country. ‘The Pitch’ will be hosted by yet another Bollywood actor, Boman Irani, and will feature 30 new entrepreneurs.\n\nThey will be put through various tasks to evaluate their business sense and the winner will walk away with the prize money of Rs 5 crore. Irani decided to sign on to the show because his son has become an entrepreneur. The show itself promises to be interesting, as business honchos like Rahul Bajaj, Kishore Biyani, Naina Lal Kidwai and N Damodaran will reportedly be making appearances as mentors to the contestants."
