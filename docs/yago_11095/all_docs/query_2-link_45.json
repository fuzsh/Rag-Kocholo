The finale of Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega, roped in 1.42 viewers as per aMap.\n\nThe grand episode that went on for 3 hours and 15 minutes recorded an average TVR of 4. Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega was one of popular shows on air giving a tough time to daily soaps.\n\nThe last season of Raki ka Swayamvar was a disappointment for the Imagine viewers with the wedding not taking place. However the channel did kept on saying through promotions that this time it will be different.\n\nAccording to Atrayee Chakraborty director, planning sciences, Lintas Media Group, “”The reality element of the show has diminished and viewers are clearly watching it because of the ‘masala’ factor.”\n\nThe show was aired twice catering to both metro and smaller town audience. The 8 pm and 11 pm slot helped in rope numerous viewers for Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega."
