        "text": "New DelhiReality TV star Rahul Mahajan, who got married in a television show last week, was today allowed by a Delhi court to get back his passport to visit the Maldives for honeymoon.The court asked him to furnish a fixed deposit of Rs5 lakh and a personal bond of same amount for the release of his passport, which was deposited while he was granted bail in a pending drug abuse case against him.Additional sessions judge JPS Malik, who allowed his plea, directed Rahul to give an undertaking that he will not indulge in any type of shooting during his honeymoon period from March 9 to 30.Further, the court directed him that he has to get his marriage registered under the Hindu Marriage Act.Mahajan's counsel told the court that the marriage was performed by observing the law which involved 'saptapadi' (walking seven steps together around the ceremonial fire). Mahajan, 35, son of slain BJP leader Pramod Mahajan, got married on Saturday to Dimpy Ganguly, 21, a model and dancer, during the TV reality show 'Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega'.He had earlier been granted permission by the court to visit Seychelles islands for honeymoon between August 30, 2006to September 11, 2006 after his first marriage to Shweta Singh, a former pilot. They got divorced on August 1, 2008.Mahajan, who was arrested on June 5, 2006 under various provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, has been on bail in the case since June 14 that year. The trial in the drug abuse case against Mahajan and others is yet to start as the records are with the Delhi high court which is hearing various revision petitions against framing of charges under the NDPS Act.\n\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\n\nSCROLL TO CONTINUE READING"
