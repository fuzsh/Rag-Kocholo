        "text": "Bigg Boss 14 is getting exciting day by day. The makers are trying their best to make things interesting. Now, the recent twist is that only four contestants will go forward in the game and play along with the new challengers who will enter the house. Yes, Bigg Boss 11's mastermind Vikas Gupta will enter the house along with challengers, Rahul Mahajan, Arshi Khan, Manu Panjabi, and Kashmera Shah. Rahul Mahajan, who is the son of late politician Pramod Mahajan spoke about him quitting smoking and drinking. He also opened up about big Bollywood personalities involved in the drug scandal. In an interview with IANS, he said, \"Health, personal life, improving on my own self (is keeping me busy). I quit smoking and drinking. I am into healthy food, workout, improving my life spiritually, physically, mentally, personal relationships. So I am working on my whole thing as a perspective of life.\"\n\n\"I am 45, (and have a) different perspective of life. (I have) more intensity. Listening to gurus like Sat Guru and Osho, you go to spiritualism at a certain age. (I am) More into spiritualism, health and cause of life and a lot of other things which are not media-oriented. There are things in play but they don't come out. So, I am working on a couple of things. The Media thing was more of a hobby for me, it was never like a business,\" he added. Rahul also spoke about quitting smoking and drinking. He said, \"I feel free. It is not like if I get a show like Bigg Boss, I will go partying and drinking. There is freedom. There is no need for a cigarette. I feel free.\"\n\nHe also said that contestants smoking in the reality show are suffering.\n\nRahul Mahajan said, \"They are addicted to cigarettes. I am not even addicted to coffee. So (I have) that much of control. That much of transformation I have got and I feel free from everything I don't need. Now, I know how boring it is when you drink and talk.\"\n\nStay tuned to BollywoodLife for the latest scoops and updates from Bollywood, Hollywood, South, TV and Web-Series."
