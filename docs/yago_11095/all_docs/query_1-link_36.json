        "text": "Celebrity couple Rahul Mahajan and his wife Dimpy Ganguly seems to be heading for a split after Dimpy walked out of Rahul's home alleging abuse.\n\nIn an interview to Mumbai based tabloid, Mumbai Mirror, Dimpy alleged that Rahul beat her up regularly and also pointedÂ a gun to her headÂ in one of their fights.\n\nDimpyÂ left Rahul's home after a brawl with him on Thursday morning.\n\nRahul's secretary however denied the allegations. \"Our lawyers will send a legal notice to dimpyÂ regarding this,\" he said.\n\nRahulÂ met Dimpy on a reality show, Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega after which they got married in March 2010.\n\nAt that time, Rahul told rediff.com, \"This wedding is a second birth for me.\" Rahul was earlier married to his long time girlfriend Shweta Singh who divorced him in August 2008 alleging that he beat her.\n\nWhen asked why he chose Dimpy out of 16,500 applicants, Rahul said, \"From day one itself, Dimpy and I were very comfortable with each other. We are good friends now. I have always believed that a good friend will make a good wife, and that is what I saw in Dimpy. I can talk to her about everything. I don't have to be careful about my words or the way I talk. She is only 21 but is really matured for her age. She is always smiling. I love her for that.\"\n\nHowever in four months the marriage seems to be cracking.\n\nThe first signs were visibleÂ last week when Rahul started sending sms to actress Payal Rohatgi who was hisÂ house mate onÂ the reality show Bigg Boss.\n\nPayal inÂ an interview to a tabloid said that she did not wish to be in touch with Rahul because he was already married.\n\nWhen Mumbai Mirror contacted Rahul, he denied the story and said, 'It is not true at all. I just had dinner with Dimpy's father.'"
