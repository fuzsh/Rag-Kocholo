        "text": "Story outline\n\nRahul Mahajan is reportedly going through his third divorce from his wife Natalya Ilina\n\nThe couple had been married for four years\n\nThey filed for divorce in 2022, says a source\n\nMahajan has had a turbulent marital history\n\nHis second and third marriages to Dimpy Ganguly and Shweta Singh, respectively, ended with domestic abuse claims\n\n'Bigg Boss 2' contestant Rahul Mahajan is headed for his third divorce from Kazakhstan model-wife Natalya Ilina.\n\nAccording to an ETimes report, the couple filed for divorce last year after four years of marriage, a source confirmed. However, it is not known if the divorce has been finalised yet.\n\n\"Compatibility issues were there between the two since the beginning. However, they stretched their marriage as long as they could. They parted ways last year and have filed for divorce,\" the source was quoted as saying to ETimes.\n\nThe 48-year-old neither denied nor confirmed the report and Ilina didn't respond to ETimes. Mahajan was quoted as saying, \"I want to keep my private life private. I would not like to comment on anything. I do not discuss what's happening in my personal life even with my friends.\" On a parting note he also mentioned, \"By the way, I'm doing well.\"\n\nThe 'Bigg Boss' regular - who is the son of late former union minister Pramod Mahajan - has had a turbulent marital history.\n\nMahajan's second marriage was a grand affair and caught people's attention after he found his bride on a TV show 'Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayenge' in 2010. After the show concluded, he tied the knot with Dimpy Ganguly, who was titled the winner of the reality show.\n\nOn the other hand, reality TV's favourite star Mahajan has appeared in several shows with his former wives. He participated with Ganguly in 'Nach Baliye' season 5 in 2013. Last February, he was seen on 'Smart Jodi' as a contestant with Ilina.\n\nHowever, Mahajan and Ganguly's marital journey also hit a rough patch. After five years of marriage, Ganguly filed for divorce, citing domestic violence and physical abuse. The divorce was finalised in February 2015 after which Mahajan confirmed on social media that the duo were still friends.\n\nNow, Ganguly is a proud mother of three children – Reanna, Aryan and Rishaan - with her Dubai-based businessman-husband Rohit Roy.\n\nMahajan found love for the first time in Shweta Singh when both joined the flying school in the US. Later, they also worked together as pilots for Jet Airways.\n\nAfter knowing each other for 13 years, the duo got engaged in July 2006 and tied the knot in August the same year.\n\nAs time passed, they encountered various troubles in their married life. According to reports, Shweta filed for divorce, accusing Mahajan of domestic violence in December 2007. In August 2008, the divorce was granted based on mutual agreement between both parties.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nNot TCS.
