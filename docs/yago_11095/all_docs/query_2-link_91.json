        "text": "Mumbai : Reality TV star Rahul Mahajan is the latest to be evicted today from popular show ‘Bigg Boss Halla Bol’, an extended segment of the small screen series.\n\nRahul, a contestant from the second season of the reality show, entered as one of the challengers on ‘Bigg Boss Halla Bol’ besides Sambhavna Seth, Ajaz Khan, Mahek Chahal and Sana Khan.\n\nRahul, 39, who is the fourth challenger to be evicted after Ajaz, Sana and Mehek, said he desperately wanted to be out of the house.\n\n“I wanted to get out of the show as early as possible because I was getting frustrated with the feuds in the house.\n\n“I am very happy that Bigg Boss has eliminated me from the show because had he not evicted me today I would have run away from it. I wanted to go out desperately as I was losing interest,” Rahul told PTI.\n\nThe celebrity contestants who were nominated for this week’s eviction were Dimpy, Ali Quli Mirza, and Sambhavna besides Rahul.\n\nThe ‘Nach Baliye’ star made headlines after he was seen flirting with co-contestant Karishma Tanna on the show in the presence of his estranged wife Dimpy."
