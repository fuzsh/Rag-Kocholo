        "text": "Ask me how I spend my weekend and it will probably be a combination of trying and failing to catchup with friends, peppered with catching up on/binging tv shows and/or new episodes of podcasts that I can catch up on while doing the laundry. Most of my peers, however, are into the phenomenon of watching reality tv. A recent show that my friends have been crazy about is a British reality show Love Island, which was aptly described by one of them as ‘basically soft porn with a thick accent.’\n\nNow, as an adult, I have never been a fan of reality tv. Sure, the premise is tempting and (often) campy enough to induce some laughs, and often many intriguing and agonizing waiting for the next episode. I am still not a fan of shows like Fear Factor or the MTV India hit show Roadies, still going on and well into it’s twelfth season.\n\nAs a teenager, I hadn’t quite been a reality tv show fan, unlike most of my peers. Not to say that I was into some indie-unknown arthouse stuff; that’s me today. Me today also likes to indulge in reality show watching as well…but more on that later. Going back to my formative years and my teens, tv watching mostly consisted of the occasional cartoons, and maybe a night time soap opera that my mother would watch (in tow with the rest of the family).\n\nWith the advent of the internet and adecline in Indian soap opera quality (the latest controversy in TV is a creepy new show about a ten year old prince who falls in love with a 19 year old woman who had been chosen to be his personal bodyguard…by way of marriage), there was an import and subsequent reign of American-styled reality tv shows. We tried, as a family, to get on the reality tv show bandwagon with the release of the Big Brother inspired Indian show Bigg Boss, as well as even a grand Bachelorette spinoff featuring the ever enterntaining Rakhi Sawant in a self titled show Rakhi Sawant ka Swayamwar. There was a Bachelor spinoff too, featuring a washed up ex-contestant on Big Boss, Rahul Mahajan. But I have my own set of reasons to not like that man so I shall not talk about his show further. (Reason? Misogynistic wife-beater and a man-baby who feels he is entitled to the world. Eugh.)\n\nThere was something for everyone. Reality tv shows occupied most of the top slots in tv programming, slots which had previously featured top fictional Indian soap operas. It was this advent in reality tv culture that also amplified the theatrics in emerging fictional soap operas. If mother-in-law/wife tiffs were run of the mill, TV writers sought to add their own masala to the foray; a show intended to be about the problem of child marriage in modern day Rajasthan spirals into a skewed narration regarding time leaps, barely-there plotlines and the so-called main aim of the show being derailed with the main leads, married as children, being romantically interested in each other. While the show attempts to make some points about the fallacies of child marriage, barely any tackle the primary question of class differences (caste, as a social evil, is barely addressed anywhere on these soap operas). Not to say that Indian dramas have always had a history of being ‘regressive’ or of not having a logical basis at all. Many pivotal dramas of the 80’s and 90’s, as broadcast by the likes of Doordarshan. A rise in a whole new middle class audience that wished to watch ‘real’ issues being tackled, lead to the rise in what is now known as middle cinema, and perhaps correlated with the rise in such topics as television serials and features.\n\nIt was, undoubtedly, with the advent of reality television that new forms of attracting the viewer and keeping them hooked to their screens to see what next. And if cliff hangers weren’t enough, there’s a new twist to a hoard of tricks for the viewer: its not an illusion, this is reality. There is no fourth wall. Instead, there are confessional rooms, with raw footage and commentary by ‘contestants’ on a show being broadcast. If the show is, by any chance, task-centric, the centrality of those tasks fades with the drama mixed that comes with fellow-contestant voting, and other such audience-hooking gimmicks.\n\nOn the flip side, I feel like a lot can be said about the cathartic power of reality television as well. There is a portrayal of the ugly side of things, with contestants deliberately going at each other; but there’s a dichotomy at work within these shows as well, something which the producers definitely try and exploit. With a recent controversy regarding the popular american series Bachelor in Paradise, many accounts of producers and show makers manipulating events (especially of the sexual nature) for good television. But as the industry’s standards and norms of tv change, and with the advent of streaming websites hosting some of the best short form television content, old and contemporary, the foundations of tv have been shook up, just as the foundations of Hollywood and the studio system with the advent of television entertainment. That’s what life is; an endless circles within many more circles of pure innovation. Change is constant. We don’t have to necessarily like it, but we do need to accept it.\n\nIt’s the same with the addiction to and changing forms of reality tv. Various shows and reality tv empires like the Kardashians who are constantly innovating and reinventing themselves as celebrities out in the real world. Second gen. stars like Kylie Jenner have launched other ventures (like her ginormous makeup empire) and had recently premiered a reality show based on her life, exclusively. You’d wonder what’s different in this show than the show she had practically grown up in; but the show is already gaining a cult following and fans are responding immensely. Jenner, along with her sisters, is also huge on social media platform Instagram, another important factor in her and her product’s popularity. Kylie Jenner is not just a reality tv show anymore; she’s a brand, and has reinvented herself to become someone who can sell matte lipsticks better than most established cosmetics brands. Perhaps Kylie’s reinvention is the perfect example of the surviving nature of reality tv on screen as a phenomenon. In this extreme capitalist, consumerist world, there are two ways to go out; resist, desist, or become a part of it wholly. Reality shows embody a convoluted ideal, and perhaps a worldwide anxiety and need for attention and, in the words of the wise Lana Del Rey, ‘…money, power, gloryyy’."
