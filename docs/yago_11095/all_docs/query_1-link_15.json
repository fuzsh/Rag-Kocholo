        "text": "Homepage\n\nTelevision\n\nInterviews\n\nRahul Mahajan's Ex-Wife Dimpy On His 3RD Marriage: New Wife Natalya May Not Be Subjected To Domestic Violence, People Change\n\nDimpy Mahajan hopes that Rahul Mahajan doesn't beat up his new wife Natalya Ilina. She wishes him well and does not agree that he was the biggest mistake of her life till date\n\nThis morning, we woke up to the news that the son of late Pramod Mahajan, Rahul Mahajan, has married again- for the 3RD time. He was earlier married to Shweta Singh (pilot) and Dimpy Ganguli (model, TV personality). His break-up with Dimpy was extremely ugly. Reportedly, Rahul inflicted violence on her. Dimpy had said that Rahul is a wife-beater. Later, Dimpy went on to marry Rohit Roy, a businessman. The two had a daughter Reanna, who is now two-and-half years old.\n\nThis afternoon, we spoke to Dimpy about Rahul's new shaadi with Kazakhstan model Natalya Ilina. Dimpy sounded so much in a happy space. She spoke about Rahul marrying again, her past with him and lots more. Here's the conversation:\n\nWhere are you now, Dimpy?\n\nI am in France.\n\nHow is your daughter?\n\nShe is doing great. Thank you.\n\nRahul Mahajan has got married again.\n\nOh! Haha! On a serious note, I am glad to know that! And hope he really finds happiness this time around... like I have done. Many Congratulations to the newlyweds.\n\nDid you know that he has got married?\n\nNope. Guess it takes some time for news to travel this far (laughs).\n\nBad memories of Rahul forgotten or do they still haunt you?\n\nNo. I had made peace with it long ago. But I have to give the man credit for his courage!\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, I just know how one broken marriage can affect you and he had two. Still, he still believes in the institution. That says something about his optimism.\n\nHad you lost faith in the institution?\n\nI didn't lose it, but it was definitely shaken. And the only reason I got around to marrying again is because Rohit is someone I knew since 9th grade, our families stay about 15 minutes away from each other in Kolkata. So, there was a lot of familiarity.\n\nSo you trusted Rohit, right?\n\nRight!\n\nHonesty is the most important thing in life...\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhat is Rohit doing these days?\n\nRohit is presently doing his MBA from INSEAD. I couldn't have been more proud and happy about it. It’s after all the best business school in the world. He is one of the most honest and hardworking people I have ever known!\n\nI would say even his new wife is pretty optimistic, going by Rahul's history of domestic violence with you...\n\nHmm... but maybe it won't be/is not like that with her. People can change you know. For the sake of both, I really hope all that doesn't happen. It's the worst thing one can do to another.\n\nWhat you are saying here is that maybe she won't be subjected to domestic violence like you were by him, right?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nOkay, people can change as you say, but what about the risk factor?\n\nWell, love makes you go against that!\n\nRahul has said that he married Shweta and you in a hurry...\n\nWell, so did I. Plus, too young. And to be fair, we had known each other for only 3 months before that. But Shweta and he were childhood friends, was that in a hurry too\n\nWould you say that Rahul was the biggest mistake of your life, till date?\n\nNo. That's unfair. Let me put it this way, it taught me many important lessons about life and relationships and I won’t have it any other way.\n\nImage Source:- Everycoupleshdwallpaper,zomato,reto,fotobasa,starsunfolded,twitter/@natalyailina_in,recipesvideo\n\nUp Next\n\nAlia Bhatt And Varun Dhawan's Pizza Party Done Right, Post Kalank Wrap\n\nDon't Miss\n\nHere’s Damning The Trolls Who’re Castigating Mira Rajput For Copying Kareena Kapoor Khan\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou may like\n\nRahul Mahajan’s ex-wife Dimpy Ganguly celebrates birthday with family ­­­­­­­­­\n\nDimpy gives birth to a baby girl ­­­­­­­­­\n\nRahul Mahajan’s ex-wife Dimpy Ganguly is pregnant ­­­­­­­­­\n\nRahul Mahajan's Ex-Wife Dimpy Ganguly Ties The Knot Again ­­­­­­­­­\n\nRahul Mahajan's Ex-Wife Dimpy To Marry Rohit Roy ­­­­­­­­­"
