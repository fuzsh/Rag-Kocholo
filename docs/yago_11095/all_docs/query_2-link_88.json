        "text": "Taboos are tumbling in India as new notions of sex, relationships and personal liberty displace traditional values. Nowhere are these changes more visible than on the myriad reality TV shows.\n\nProgrammes like Emotional Atyachar (Emotional Torture) and Sach Ka Samna (Face The Truth) seem designed to shock the older generation in a country rooted in tradition but whose television schedules increasingly resemble the United States or other Western countries.\n\nPreviously, middle class Indians were glued to family dramas in tame daily soaps that usually revolved around the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship -- a crucial yet often tension-filled one in Indian families.\n\nThough these remain popular, most private channels now dedicate a nightly slot to reality shows that shock and titillate, featuring brash youngsters who flirt, argue and shamelessly self-promote.\n\nThey are a force for social change, for better or for worse, and are drawing thousands of fans but making plenty of enemies along the way.\n\n\"Negative emotions have always been around in India but were hidden or well-covered,\" says Raghav Jha, a sociologist in Mumbai.\n\n\"By bringing it in the open, reality shows have found a way to justify them and have made them acceptable,\" said Jha, who works for a private media-research organisation.\n\n\"Reality shows are making millions of Indians believe that it is good to abuse, cool to misbehave, openly share their sexual encounters and justify any act by yelling,\" he said.\n\nIn the last five years, production companies have broadcast Indian versions of popular American and European shows, such as American Idol, The Moment of Truth, Big Brother, the Fear Factor and I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here.\n\nThe genre was propelled to the forefront of Indian popular culture three years ago when Shilpa Shetty, a Bollywood star at home but relatively unknown to the wider world, entered Britain's Big Brother house.\n\nShetty was the victim of racist bullying led by British reality TV stalwart Jade Goody -- who died of cancer 13 months ago -- in a global scandal that led to responses from the British and Indian governments and the show's suspension.\n\nSince then indigenous concepts and productions have been growing fast.\n\nIn one, Rahul Mahajan, a 30-something from a political family who was arrested in a 2006 drug abuse case, chose a wife on the big budget Rahul Dulhaniya Lejayange (Rahul Will Take The Bride) after dating more than a dozen contestants on the show.\n\nIn Emotional Torture, men and women watch their partners when attractive \"honey traps\" are sent round to flirt with them.\n\nIn a country where parents traditionally select and suggest partners for their children and extramarital sex is taboo, both shows were bound to run into criticism.\n\nIn another show that challenged the rigid caste system, children from rich families in Mumbai try out slum-dwelling with the low-caste \"untouchables\" in scenes that would revolt conservative Hindus.\n\nThe winner of the Big Switch, a month-long contest, took home prize money of 21,000 US dollars after charming viewers while shining shoes, selling books at traffic lights and doing other menial tasks normally reserved for the poor.\n\nNajma Heptulla, a member of parliament from the western state of Rajasthan, has campaigned against reality shows, some of which she says are vulgar and un-Indian.\n\nShe has particularly targeted the Indian version of \"The Moment of Truth\", which sees participants asked questions such as whether they had slept with a prostitute or with a girl younger than their daughter.\n\n\"We are not Britain and we are not America. We are in India,\" said Heptulla, who has demanded the show be pulled off air. \"We have different values and we have a different kind of living system.\n\n\"And I think, looking at our society, it doesn?t match with it at all,\" she told AFP.\n\nWhether it matches or not, the desire to take part is undeniable as aspiring actors and college students, many from remote villages and towns, rush for the chance to take part.\n\nDuring one audition held in March on the outskirts of New Delhi for the show Indian Idol, there was a stampede when contestants fought to enter the audition venue, which left 12 wannabe contestants injured.\n\nReality television actors agree that the shows might not be edifying viewing, but they defend their role.\n\n\"These shows are having a wonderful impact because I think people are opening up. They're moving along with the times,\" says Revika Desai, a contestant for an upcoming show scheduled for April this year."
