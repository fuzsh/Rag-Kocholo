        "text": "In a reality show, 12 brides are doing every trick to impress a groom, Rahul Mahajan because only one would be tying a knot at the end of the show with him. At one instance, one bride was having a so called secret conversation; sharing special moments with Rahul and at the end she said that she could have never shared all these secrets to any one in her life ever. This all in front of the camera, may be it slipped from her mind that this show would be watched by millions viewer, this all proves that reality shows are very much unreal. The groom, Rahul Mahajan really respects the females thatâ€™s why he is always on look for the opportunity to hug; a tight one and kiss the girl, no matter on whoever he can put his hand out of 12.\n\nbecause only one would be tying a knot at the end of the show with him\n\nI am not sure, but I would reword it this way:\n\nbecause only one will tie the knot with him at the end of the show\n\nI think \"tye\" is not much used, is it? And why \"would\", not \"will\"?"
