        "text": "With Dimpy, Rahul Mahajan got married after a reality show 'Rahul Dulhania Le Jayenge'. Rahul Mahajan, son of late politician Pramod Mahajan, was found love in the form of Dimpy in a serial. The couple has become a part of history by marrying on National TV. Rahul was divorced and he liked Dimpy as his bride among fifteen contestants. So let's know about them ...\n\nRahul and Dimpy were very much in love with each other and have decided to get married on the reality show itself. Rahul then said, 'Dimpy is my very good friend. In reality, we are best friend and this is very important. So I liked her'. There were reports that the marriage was predetermined and their horoscope was already found when the serial started. Dimpy had said before winning the serial, 'I will not be able to imagine life without him. He is so cute. I will hurt my heart and move forward, but he must be asking me a lot.'\n\nBut this intense and emotional love between Rahul and Dimpy did not last long. 4 months later, they quarreled and Dimpy left for Kolkata. She had accused Rahul of physically abusing her and it was said, 'Rahul Mahajan kicked me, dragged me with hair.' He also showed his bruises and was told that she would soon be separated from him. Incidentally, Rahul was also accused of harassing ex-girlfriend Payal Rohatgi. Now Rahul and Dimpy have moved forward in their respective lives and are very happy with their new spouse.\n\nAlso Read-\n\nNew twist in 'Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai', Karthik and Naira will be away once again\n\nTaarak Mehta fame Dilip Joshi shares this video and appeals to fans"
