        "text": "Rahul Mahajan on divorce from Natalya Ilina\n\nRahul Mahajan said in the interview, “I have therapists who are helping me deal with my feelings. There’s too much stigma around seeking help through therapy in India, but I see no shame in doing that.” “It is like a big earthquake took place in my life. The tremors are still somewhere there. There is a lot of trauma, but life goes on. You’ve no choice but to be strong. I still have love and respect for her. The love never dies. I’m not in touch with her and I don’t even know where she is. But love doesn’t go away just like that,” he added.\n\nRahul also said he is scared to meet someone and fall in love as he is emotionally unavailable for the moment. He also called himself unfit and said he needed healing.\n\nRahul Mahajan on rumours of him wanting a child\n\nReports had previously claimed that Rahul and Natalya ended their marriage as he wanted a child. Clarifying the speculations, Rahul also said, “I did not want baby ever in this relationship, we never tried. Only Dimpy and I tried having a baby and we had a miscarriage. Natalya and I did not have plans for a baby and neither did I ever desire it. I am 48, I don't want a baby now.” He added, “I have never paid a single rupee as an alimony in any of my divorces. All of my divorces have been by mutual agreement.”\n\nDuring the conversation, Rahul also refused to comment on the reason behind their separation. He also asserted that there is no hate for Natalya."
