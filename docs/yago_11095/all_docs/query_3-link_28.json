        "text": "Rahul Mahajan's estranged wife will be soon marrying her business tycoon boyfriend in March 2015!\n\nDimpy Mahajan, who made a wild card entry in the Bigg Boss 8 house is all set to tie the knot yet again. If rumours are to be believed, Rahul Mahajan’s estranged wife will be soon marrying her business tycoon boyfriend in March 2015! Before entering the madhouse, Dimpy was reportedly in a live-in relationship with her Dubai based boyfriend since several months.\n\nDimpy and Rahul met on the sets of “Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayenge” where they eventually fell in love. The duo got married in 2010. However, their marriage hit the rocks soon and the two filed in for a divorce. At one point, Dimpy had even alleged physical abuse. Meanwhile, in “Bigg Boss Halla Bol”, Rahul was embroiled in a controversy with Karishma Tanna, who accused him of crossing the line and flirting with her. However, Rahul says it was for fun and was not intended to hurt anyone. It is believed that Dimpy knew her current beau even before marrying Rahul Mahajan in 2010.

Dimpy, who is the cry baby of the Bigg Boss house, has however, slammed all rumours of being in a relationship. If reports are to go by, her Dubai-based lover runs an event management company and in Dimpy’s own words, he is quite a possessive person.\n\nOn Bigg Boss 8, while everyone thought that the situation would turn awkward it came to everyone’s surprise when Rahul and Dimpy were seen getting along really very well on the show. In fact, Rahul Mahajan also quoted that “We were never enemies. Our friendship has became stronger but that doesn’t mean we went in to solve our personal problems. We are nothing less than friends and nothing more than friends.” READ: Bigg Boss Halla Bol: Dimpy Ganguly and I are nothing more than friends, says Rahul Mahajan\n\nFor breaking news and live news updates, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.
