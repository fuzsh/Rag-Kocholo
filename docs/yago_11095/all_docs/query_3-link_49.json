        "text": "Former model Dimpy Ganguly says she hopes her ex-husband Rahul Mahajan finds happiness with his new wife.\n\nBigg Boss 2 contestant Rahul got married with Natalya Ilina, a Kazakhstani model 15 years younger than him, at a temple in Mumbai’s Malabar Hill last week. On his third wedding, his second wife Dimpy told Spotboye, “I am glad to know that! And I hope he really finds happiness this time around... like I have done. Many congratulations to the newlyweds.”\n\nTalking about her failed marriage with Rahul, she said, “I made peace with it long ago. But I have to give the man credit for his courage! I just know how one broken marriage can affect you and he had two. He still believes in the institution. That says something about his optimism.”\n\nOn Rahul’s abusive nature, for which she left him, she said, “Maybe it won't be/is not like that with her. People can change you know. For the sake of both, I really hope all that doesn't happen. It's the worst thing one can do to another.”\n\nRahul, meanwhile, told Times of India, “My previous two marriages happened in a hurry. There was no time to think and though both Shweta and Dimpy are wonderful individuals, we were just not compatible.”\n\n“Over the last few years, I realised that I don't want to be in a relationship for the sake of it. I don't want to be with someone where there is no way forward. With Natalya, I discovered true companionship and also, there's no room for long arguments or differences between us,\" he added.\n\nRahul’s first wife Shweta Singh was a pilot. The two got married in 2006 after Rahul’s father Pramod Mahajan’s death. However, they separated in December 2007, with Shweta accusing him of domestic violence. They were granted divorce in 2008.\n\nRahul next married Dimpy in 2010 following reality TV show Rahul Ka Swayamvar. The two got divorced in 2015 after Dimpy too accused him of domestic violence."
