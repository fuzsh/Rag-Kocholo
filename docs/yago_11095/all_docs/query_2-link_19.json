        "text": "Sunday marks the end of the journey for Rahul Mahajan in controversial reality show Bigg Boss 8.\n\nAmong the five celebrities to nominated this week, Rahul got the least votes and was eliminated on Sunday.\n\nRahul, who was part of Bigg Boss 2 in 2008, entered Bigg Boss 8 Halla Bol as a challenger early this month.\n\nDuring his stay on the show this time, Rahul lived up to the expectations of adding to the entertainment and masala. He was apparently uncomfortable watching his estranged wife Dimpy and his friend Sambhavna always fighting over petty issues in the show. He also tried flirting with Karishma Tanna but that did not really work in his favour. He was one of the most jovial people inside the house who tried to turn every ugly issue into a joke.\n\nRahul made his presence felt on the show week upon week even after his fellow Challengers Ajaz Khan, Sana Khan and Mehek Chahal failed at surviving on the show. After spending 3 weeks on the show, Rahul finally bid farewell to the housemates and audience when host Farah Khan entered the Bigg Boss house for the very first time and took Rahul back to the outside world.\n\nMarred by controversy from the very beginning, Rahul has had an eventful journey on the show. The constant ups and downs with Dimpy and his flirtatious attitude towards Karishma Tanna, made Rahul the focal point from the very first day of Bigg Boss Halla Bol. While Rahul has been seen as the most secure and balanced contestant inside the house, some debated his intentions for entering the show. However, Rahul cheerfully enjoyed his return on Bigg Boss and his stay inside the house and was now ready to move on.\n\n\"I wanted to get out of the show as early as possible because I was getting frustrated with the feuds in the house. I am very happy that Bigg Boss has eliminated me from the show because had he not evicted me today I would have run away from it. I wanted to go out desperately as I was losing interest,\" Rahul said.\n\nThe rumour meanwhile is that that Upen Patel, who is in the house as a guest, is likely to leave mid-week."
