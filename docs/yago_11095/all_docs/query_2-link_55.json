        "text": "Was it fun, though?\n\nNot really. During my earlier stay, contestants were entertaining; they enjoyed themselves. This season, people weren't having fun. They would joke about other contestants, but couldn't handle a joke themselves. People were camera-conscious and everyone was strategising. There were too many fightsâ€¦ all that was too much for me to handle.\n\nYou were seen flirting with co-contestant Karishma on the show.\n\nIt was all done in fun. She may not have a sense of humour, but healthy flirting and serious flirting are two different things. If I was interested in her, I would have flirted in a more subtle manner.\n\nHow serious are Upen Patel and Karishma about each other, according to you?\n\nThey are stuck to each other all day long, and keep coochie-cooing. I don't know what the truth is. The real test will start six months after the show ends. Their intentions might be genuine, but I don't know if they will last in the real world. I hope they do."
