        "text": "Rahul Mahajan is an entertainer - in no time he became a darling of the Indian reality show brigade.\n\nFrom being a first timer in 'Bigg Boss 2' to now becoming a reality star and participating in the upcoming dance show 'Nach Baliye season 5'.\n\nRahul came into focus of the media when his father, politician Pramod Mahajan, was shot dead. There were rumours that Rahul might follow his father's footsteps.\n\nBut Rahul had a flare for television and grabbing headlines.\n\nRahul's tryst with abused substance saw him being hospitalised just a month after his father's death.\n\nHe then got married to his childhood sweetheart Shweta Singh, but divorced her within 15 months.\n\nIndian television saw the potential in Rahul as an entertainer and thus a reality star was born in 2008.\n\nRahul Mahajan entered the controversial reality show Big Boss in 2008. He did everything possible for the camera and tried to woo two other inmates Payal Rohatgi & Monica Bedi.\n\nAfter his Bigg Boss stint, Mahajan was a judge on 'Chhote Miyan', a children's stand-up comedy reality show.\n\nThen was a reality show that clinched him the title of reality star.\n\nRahul participated in 'Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega', the reality show where he could choose a wife for himself.\n\nHis marriage to Dimpy Mahajan on reality television created history by being the first couple to marry on Indian reality television.\n\nHowever, in four months the marriage was in doldrums, with Dimpy alleging that Rahul beat her up regularly. She even went to the extend of holding a gun to her head in one of their fights.\n\nAnd now...the couple - Rahul and Dimpy Mahajan - are participating in the dance reality show 'Nach Baliye season 5'.\n\nConsidering his success run with reality shows it is very likely that he might strike gold this time, too.\n\nHe has the ability to sway the audiences and keep the ratings going for the shows.\n\nFor sure the couple's dancing skills will be tested, but what will get take them to the top - controversies or dance skills?\n\nIn terms of dance, Rahul sure does have competition with other contestants who have already shown their expertise.\n\n‘Jhalak Dikhla Jaa 5’ winner Gurmeet Choudhary with wife Debina Bonerjee and runner –up Rashmi Desai with hubby Nandish Sandhu will challenge Rahul on the dance floor.\n\n‘Dance India Dance Little Champs’ host Jay Bhanushali will be seen along with wife TV actress Mahie Gill. ‘Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai’ fame Karan Mishra with his newly wedded wife Nisha Rawa will also shake a leg.\n\nAll the best Rahul we sure hope you get the TRP's soaring.\n\nFollow Emirates 24|7 on Google News."
