        "text": "M.today\n\nMumbai,March 07: Rahul Mahajan’s hunt for a perfect bride on TV is over as the reality show star picked Bengali girl Dimpy Ganguly to tie the knot in true Bollywood style.\n\nMahajan, who has had a troubled past with drug abuse charges and an acrimonious marriage and divorce from childhood friend Shweta Singh, hopes that it is a \"happily ever after\" for him.\n\nMahajan chose 21-year-old Dimpy, a model and dancer, over Nikunj Malik, 25, and Harpreet Chhabra, 20, on reality TV show ’Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega’ broadcast by NDTV Imagine.\n\nRahul decided to go ahead with his wedding despite the recent death of his uncle Praveen Mahajan, who was convicted for killing his politician father Pramod Mahajan in 2006.\n\nThe Bengali-style wedding was held in a luxurious Mumbai suburban hotel on Saturday night and the couple wore outfits designed by famous fashion designers Ashley Rebello, Neeta Lulla and Vikram Phadnis.\n\nRahul (34), who is facing drug abuse charges, had requested a Delhi court for releasing his passport so that his wife and he could spend their honeymoon in the Maldives.\n\n\"It’s a great feeling. I am both excited and nervous. I really believe marriages are made in heaven and this time I’ll give whatever I have to make my wife happy. It is going to be happily ever after,\" he had said. Dimpy, who was a favourite due to her \"crackling chemistry\" with Rahul, said she was always confident of being ’Mrs. Mahajan’ as she knows how to handle the media better than the other contestants.\n\nNew Mrs Rahul Mahajan wants him to enter politics\n\nRahul Mahajan`s newlywed wife Dimpy Ganguly, whom he married on a highly-watched and much talked about reality show, wants her husband to pursue a political career like his father, late Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Pramod Mahajan, rather than be in show business.\n\n\"I really want him (Rahul) to pursue a political career,\" Dimpy told reporters here Saturday night after exchanging wedding vows with Rahul on ‘Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega’.\n\nTo this, 35-year-old Rahul said: \"I`ll first manage my home and once that is settled, I`ll manage the country.\"\n\nRahul has earlier participated in reality show ‘Bigg Boss’ too.\n\nDimpy, 21, is a model and actress by profession. She pipped other finalists Nikunj Malik, 25 and Harpreet, 21, apart from over 16,500 applicants from across the country to be Rahul`s wife. And the Bengali lass says she will continue to work after marriage as well.\n\n\"Rahul doesn`t want me to be a housewife. So I`ll work. But I don`t know yet what I will be doing,\" said Dimpy, who was sporting a red wedding outfit designed by Neeta Lulla, the traditional `mangal sutra` in her neck and vermillion on her forehead.\n\nRahul had vowed to marry a girl on national TV and he kept his promise by doing so with the Kolkata-based girl, despite the recent death of his uncle Praveen Mahajan, who was convicted for killing his politician father Pramod Mahajan in 2006.\n\nThe duo will be registering their marriage Tuesday in Bandra here.\n\nRahul`s mother Rekha Mahajan was present during the lavish wedding and blessed the couple. His father`s photograph was also placed at the marriage venue.\n\nDimpy`s family members as well as several TV celebrities attended the glitzy event at the Leela Kempinski Hotel here"
