        "text": "Rahul, who was one of the most entertaining contestants of \"Bigg Boss 2\", was nominated along with Sambhavna Seth, Dimpy and Ali Quli Mirza.\n\nThe episode will beam Sunday night.\n\nThough Rahul entered the show with the same enthusiasm, he lost zeal in the middle of the show and was seen laying low inside the house.\n\nRahul's journey in the house saw lots of ups and downs, but one of the major highlights was Karishma Tanna's accusation of him flirting with her.\n\nAnother reason his entry caught attention was due to the presence of his estranged wife Dimpy as a contestant.\n\nHowever, despite being separated, the two showed their strong bond of friendship during his stint in the show.\n\n\"Bigg Boss Halla Bol\" series started with five challengers from past seasons of the show, competing with five \"champions\" from the eighth edition of \"Bigg Boss\". The new series of the Colors show is hosted by filmmaker Farah Khan.\n\nActress Mahek Chahal, who was also one of the challengers, was voted out in a mid-week eviction from the reality show Thursday. She was nominated along with Dimpy, Karishma and Pritam Singh.\n\nAfter Rahul's eviction, the five \"Bigg Boss 8\" champions - Karishma, Gautam Gulati, Pritam, Dimpy and Ali; and out of the challengers Sambhavna will fight it out for the winner's spot.\n\nThe finale of the show will take place Jan 31."
