        "text": "Wedding bells ring for Rahul Mahajan, ex-Bigg Boss contestant, brother of parliamentarian, Poonam Mahajan and son of former union cabinet minister Pramod Mahajan, once again, as he reportedly tied the knot with Kazakhstan model Natalya Ilina, on Tuesday, 20 November in a private ceremony. Attended by 25 members of the family and the close circle of the couple, it was held in a temple in Malabar Hills.\n\n“Hope he really finds happiness this time around... like I have. Many Congratulations to the newlyweds,” former Bigg Boss contestant and Rahul Mahajan’s ex-wife Dimpy told a digital publication. Dimpy also spoke about Mahajan’s courage and optimism since he chose to believe in the institution of wedlock after two broken marriages.\n\nHis first marriage to pilot, Shweta Singh and second to Dimpy Ganguly - both ended with accusations of physical abuse and domestic violence. Dimpy went on to say, “People can change you know. For the sake of both, I really hope all that (domestic violence) doesn't happen. It's the worst thing one can do to another.”"
