        "text": "Dimpy Ganguly might be leading the perfect life with husband Rohit Roy and their three beautiful kids right now, however, the actress-model faced a rocky start when she tied the knot with Rahul Mahajan on a reality show. Sadly, their marriage didn’t stand the test of time. Dimpy had also accused Rahul of domestic violence. However, both have moved on in life now and are happily married to their respective partners.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, life for Dimpy after her divorce with Rahul was no easy task. She cut herself from everyone and shut herself down. She even drifted away from her parents during her healing process. The former Bigg Boss contestant has now spoken about it.\n\nDIMPY ON LIFE AFTER DIVORCE WITH RAHUL\n\nDimpy Ganguly and Rahul Mahajan had a bitter divorce in 2015. In an interview with ETimes, Dimpy spoke about shutting herself post her divorce. She said, “The initial years were hard because I had to start from scratch. I relocated and we started everything fresh. So it was hard. The only way to do it was to completely disconnect. That’s why there was a period of complete silence from my life. I didn’t want to talk to anybody, I didn’t want to do anything. Even though I had time, I didn’t take up any project. I just wanted some time to heal and to figure out my way ahead, start a new life. Once I was in a happy space again, then I came out. I made friends, I did things that I used to do.”\n\nDIMPY ON DEVELOPING TRUST ISSUES AFTER DIVORCE\n\nDimpy Ganguly, in the same interview, also mentioned that she trusted no one during the healing process. She said, “So, there was a time when I trusted nobody. Not even trusting, I moved away from everybody, including my own parents. We were in touch, but what I was going through, what I was thinking, they had no idea. I was dealing with a lot and I wasn’t ready to talk. It was not easy for them. So, I made that choice of moving away.”\n\nABOUT DIMPY AND RAHUL\n\nDimpy Ganguly got married to Rahul Mahajan in a show called ‘Rahul Ki Dulhaniya Le Jayenge’. Post that, she did projects together like ‘Nach Baliye 5’, ‘Bigg Boss 8’, ‘Kahani Chandrakanta Ki’ and many others. Rahul and Dimpy had many ugly disputes and differences in public. Dimpy had also accused Rahul of domestic violence after a few months of marriage, which made them file for divorce. She stayed away from the limelight after parting ways in 2015. However, she now remains active on Instagram and has about 109 thousand followers on the platform."
