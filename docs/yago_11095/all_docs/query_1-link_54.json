Her real name is ‘Soumasri’ name means ‘as beautiful as moon’ while the screen name is Dimpy.\n\nHere Dimpy is making her day more graceful in this Bridal Saree, spotted at Press Conference of their Reality Show. Her Saree is heavily embroidered with rich artwork of zari and sequins, creating a jaal all over her pallu. Borders are lined up with matching lace, paired with round necked plain georgette blouse."
