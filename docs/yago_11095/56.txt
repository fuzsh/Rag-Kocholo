The report adds that the divorce will take place after the elections. Mahajan, ­however, rubbishes the news, saying, "There is no truth to this ... don’t pay any heed."

Dimpy married Rahul on national television in 2010. She pipped 14 contestants and over 16,500 applicants on Imagine TV's reality show Rahul Dulhania Le Jaayega to marry the son of late Bharatiya Janata Party leader Pramod Mahajan.

However, just four months after marriage, trouble started brewing when the Kolkata-based model accused Rahul of "punching, kicking and dragging" her.

However, both of them later sorted out their differences and were back together. They even appeared on a dance reality show. Dimpy had said then, "Our relationship has grown stronger over the years. We have had our share of ups and downs but now we understand each other much more than before and everything is going good."

Dimpy also acted in a TV series called Kahani Chandrakanta Ki.

Rahul has been embroiled in controversies earlier. His first wife, Shweta Singh, divorced him in 2008 citing domestic abuse. He was earlier charged in a drg abuse case.
