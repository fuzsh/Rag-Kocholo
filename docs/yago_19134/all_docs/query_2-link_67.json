        "text": "ANN ARBOR, MI - A decade ago today -- on April 27, 2012 -- “The Five Year Engagement” hit movie theaters.\n\nThe comedy starring Jason Segal and Emily Blunt wove Ann Arbor into its story. Blunt’s character is a University of Michigan doctoral student. Segal’s character, who suffers from frostbite in Pioneer Woods, works as a sandwich maker at Zingerman’s after rejections from Shalimar, Gratzi and Mani Osteria."
