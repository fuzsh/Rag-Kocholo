        "text": "You don’t know what’s going to happen in The Royal Hotel, and it almost doesn’t matter—the journey is that visceral. As in her debut feature, The Assistant, director Kitty Green showcases a master’s touch in bringing the audience into the subtle, authentic experiences of everyday terror felt by young women out of their element. And just as in The Assistant, Emmy winner Julia Garner is our eyes and ears through the pressure cooker, while cinematographer Michael Latham keeps us trapped, not letting up for a second.\n\nHitting theaters today, The Royal Hotel is a brutally effective step-up for Green and Latham. They had a few extra hours to shoot here than on their first movie—amounting to a still very limited 21 full days—and took advantage of the expansive landscapes and culture of their native Australia, as they follow 30-something American friends Hanna (Garner) and Liv (Jessica Henwick) on a backpacking trip that winds up going terribly awry in the outback. Eventually they take a bartending job in the middle of nowhere after running out of money.\n\n“The image of two women in backpacks is such a horror-movie image that we have to fight that for a lot of the movie, because that’s what everyone expects,” Green says. “The aim is to challenge those genre conventions…but we do a little bit of playing with them too.” The director had the idea for the movie after seeing 2016’s Hotel Coolgardie, a documentary about Scandinavian women working in the outback. “I was so struck by seeing the Australian pub culture through their eyes—I liked watching them stand up for themselves in it,” Green says. “We have this expression in Australia where they always say about certain people, ‘Oh, he’s all right, mate’—like to guys in the dorm room who’ve had too much to drink that you’re a bit worried about. The film exists in that discomfort: I don’t feel safe in this environment, but I’m not entirely sure if that’s an overreaction or if this person’s a real threat.”\n\nFor 90 unsettling minutes, Green and Latham keep you in that space and don’t let you go. Selecting six shots from The Royal Hotel, they take Vanity Fair through how they pulled it off.\n\nThe Boat\n\nThe film opens on a lively, disorienting nightclub scene—which, through a little single-take camera trickery, is revealed to be on a party boat, with Hanna and Liv celebrating their way through an Australian vacation.\n\nKitty Green: We wanted to start out with that kind of dream Australian vacation. The idea is it starts off in any club. It could be anywhere. She opens these doors and you realize the nightclub is in the belly of the boat. She lands up on the deck, and she can see the Sydney Harbor. That’s one continuous shot. It’s actually a cheat, because we shot half of it on the stage—which was the nightclub, and not in the boat—and the other half was shot on Sydney Harbor in a very tiny window of three hours that we had access to that boat. We stitched it together, but that’s the construction of it—setting up what this vacation was supposed to be before it goes off the rails.\n\nMichael Latham: The boats were very expensive to hire. This boat was actually a very corporate boat, so the interior was not great either. So we actually shot these in two different cities. You’re always trying to keep track of consistency and lighting and stuff like that. As Kitty said, we had three hours to do this, but we had a 20-minute loop that we had to achieve to get back in the right position to see the bridge. So it was really tight timing. We got three takes of this if I remember rightly, and I think one of them bumped, so there were only two usable takes. Also, we’re coming out of a dark space, so we’re having to time an iRIS [lighting controller] to bring the exposure down as we come from inside out. It’s a lot of technical stuff that we needed to get in a very tight window.\n\nI love Kitty’s choice of location in terms of skewing the audience’s expectations—you expect to be in a nightclub and then, whoa, we’re on a boat. The Sydney Harbor Bridge is quite clever as well, because it’s one of the most iconic landmarks in Australia.\n\nGreen: Yeah. That’s true. I don’t think anyone says they’re in Australia, actually.\n\nThe Hotel\n\nGreen: This was only a few hours north of the city. We were looking for a two-story pub, because that feels like the most grand. The idea that this place has a history, that it was a really marvelous and upstanding institution, which has since fallen into disrepair, was really important to us. It had enough of an expanse around it that it worked in that there’s a bit of nothingness everywhere. It was a little green, which grayed it out a little bit there, to make it look a little dustier than it was. The pub was abandoned. It’s a town of 29 people. The pub was built when they thought a railway line was going to be built, but the railway line was never built, so the pub sat there, and from time to time over the years it’s been used and then closed up again. So yeah. It was the perfect place for us. It was really spooky though. We were all a bit afraid to go in there alone.\n\nLatham: The thing that’s so interesting about a vast space is that, when you look around in a 180 or 360 degrees, there’s just nothing. There’s nothing to put your eye on. So I think with this shot, we really tried to start on the emptiness. You get a great reaction of what she’s looking at [after], but you also feel that there’s nothing between what she’s looking at and when we get to her.\n\nThe Close-Up\n\nIn a flip, this shot then reveals we’re meeting the pub through Hanna’s eyes, a perspective rule the film maintains throughout. The nothingness surrounding her and slight terror in her eyes signals Green’s genre-skirting methods, which teeter from here on out.\n\nGreen: I hate to admit this, but this shot was inspired by a shot in Midsommar, which is a similar kind of thing—a surveying of the Swedish landscape that lands on Florence Pugh. This was one of those moments where we can lean on genre a little bit and go, “Hey. Here, there’s nothing. There’s literally nothing around you. You’re so isolated at this point, which is terrifying.”\n\nLatham: I was probably more genre-leaning than Kitty. There’d be moments where she would be like, “No, that’s too genre,” and there was a constant conversation with lighting and camera movement to keep it as subtle as possible. For me, when you’re out in the desert, the landscapes are so searingly bright, you’re always squinting. Then when you go inside, you’re squinting again, but it’s because the spaces are so dark. I really wanted to replicate that. We were always trying to find a motivated reason to move the camera. But every now and then, we would move it and be like, “That’s a bit too far past the genre. That push in is feeling a bit too creepy. Let’s not do that.” It was a constant balance of finding the right tone.\n\nThe Pub\n\nGreen: We spent three weeks in this space. We built this interior, mostly because we couldn’t afford to keep the crew out in the exterior location because it was very remote and really hard logistically. So we did two weeks out there, and then we did three in the studio here. Leah Popple, our production designer, built this incredible set, which feels used and loved and lived in. Most of the movie is within these four walls. The claustrophobia of it adds to the tension in the movie; there’s such an expanse outside, but when you’re inside, it’s like there’s no oxygen. It needed to feel cramped, densely packed with people.\n\nBoth The Assistant and this film, which Michael and I also worked on together—a lot of it exists on Julia’s face. A lot of it is her reaction to whatever she’s seeing. It’s her performance that’s holding the whole thing together. It becomes about her perception of the events. Another good thing about building this was you could get enough room behind the bar that we can fit cameras in there with her, to be really close up with her—and then be able to survey the room as if it was her point of view. We were very specific about the way we cover all those events. We’re trying to be with her and her perception at all times. That ends up informing a lot of our choices. That was the biggest rule—it only existed in the way she would see it. If she’s not looking at it, we don’t shoot it.\n\nLatham: Both The Assistant and this had very tight schedules, so Kitty and I storyboard basically everything as much as we can. We knew what the set design was going to be, and did a 3D visualization in pre [production], and essentially plotted the cameras out for probably 95% of the film. We talked a lot about introducing the bar and the chaos of the bar and how that first night, we wanted to make the scene feel as dynamic as possible. So the introductory shot, we move along down the bar, and we’re whipping around, following Julia’s movement as much as possible, to give it a sense of dynamism, which, obviously, when you’re moving 180 degrees in the bar, makes it very tricky to place lights. All the lights that hang above the bar had multiple hooks that we could move them up and down to adjust lighting subtly. They were also LED; they could all be remotely controlled. So I was able to dim and brighten areas subtly without signaling that the image had changed.\n\nGreen: We often had five hours to do a huge scene. So in that sense, we had to be really clear about the blocking, and give the actors the direction as to the blocking, and then hope that within that map that we’ve given them, they were able to find room to play and surprise us and things like that. But it was a very precise exercise in order to just achieve it. The actors were a bit freaked out by that at first; they started to trust the process and trust that we knew where we needed to be, and just tried to really play within the frame.\n\nIn the film’s first hair-raising sequence, a pub regular whose quiet, drunken menace unsettles Hanna makes his way into the upstairs living quarters. The camera pans in the vein of a horror movie to stick to her sense of terror as he stumbles around, with no indication of where he’s planning to go.\n\nGreen: This shot starts on Julia in the room, and pans around and finds the man at night up there having a little drunken stumble. As soon as you push a camera or a camera creeps forward in any way, it immediately screams horror movie. So it was always this tricky thing. The shot after this, where she sits on the bed, Michael and I had very different views on what it should look like. His leaned more horror and mine tried to be a little more observational and feel a little more authentically an experience. Sometimes we were lucky enough that we could fit both in, and then we could decide in the edit, but that was rare. This one is the most horror-y the movie gets in that sense. It’s the moment where it ramps up a little bit and everything gets a little scarier. It’s when the balance of everything shifts a little bit.\n\nLatham: Again, it was trying to stay with Julia’s perspective. She comes out of the room. It’s one panning shot where we see her face and then we see what she’s looking at; it mirrors that first shot when she arrives at the pub and we go from landscape to her. We do the opposite. We go from her to the landscape, which is Dolly (Daniel Henshall) at the end of the hallway.\n\nGreen: Having learned some things on The Assistant, I was able to really try to check that each frame held that tension, and check where that was coming from, how tight we needed to be—and sticking with her seemed to be the best way to hold onto it, because she’s so terrified. She exists in this space where she’s trying to figure out is this a threat, is this a joke, is this guy just drunk and wandering around, or is he coming to attack us or assault us. Staying in her consciousness or staying in her whatever, the way she was processing the events gives it all its power.\n\nThe Window\n\nGreen: This was one of the few frames we didn’t storyboard. We didn’t know that the glass break would be that big enough of a hole to be able to see through it; we didn’t know that that view from the pub was that barren. There’s so nothing out there, which is really incredible. The light’s doing really magnificent things. We just lucked out with the car crash, which we didn’t have time to move. If we were a big Hollywood movie, we’d have time to move the car, but we literally had 20 minutes of dusk or whatever, so we had to just shoot through that door. It happened to line up exactly that the car was where it needed to be. The boys could fight on the left. The girls could hug on the right. We could have this beautiful image that showed those two worlds.\n\nIt was a horrible timing thing. We got two nights of dusk—half an hour, maybe an hour for two nights. We had to crash a car and have a fight and do all these things in that amount of time, which meant, again, only four or five shots.\n\nLatham: This is one of only two scenes where we used two cameras, purely for time reasons. I can’t remember exactly how it played out. I feel like someone was dressing the door, and then the door closed. I was like, “Hey. Check this out. This is quite interesting.” [Laughs] We were very fortunate in that the car landed in the right spot and et cetera. In terms of achieving that, we did a lot of technical rehearsal time prior. We had a backup car, but we only crashed the one car. So it’s a one-take wonder in terms of the actual accident, because we also knew that to reset that car would take something like two hours to do. We didn’t have that time.\n\nKitty and I had a lot of conversations about what time of day what scene would be. We really wanted to move into dawn, because you needed that delineation that time has jumped between her taking a shot at the bar and then waking up and the guys have come back. Without that, it gets very confusing. In terms of achieving it, the simple way of saying it is essentially it’s just different shades of blue and different intensities of light coming through the window. At the earliest crack of dawn, it’s very blue. The light coming through the window is not affecting the set or the subjects as much as later on. Each time we moved from downstairs to upstairs, the shade of blue would be less and the intensity would be brighter. Then when we came back down, it would essentially do the same thing.\n\nThe hallway scene we had to shoot during the day, and so that doesn’t quite equate, which is something that annoys me incredibly. We had to block out windows to shoot that during the day, for scheduling purposes. Hopefully nobody notices it, but essentially there is that little hitch in between, where we drop out of that pattern. But for the most part, that’s how I did it.\n\nGreen: I remember this scene specifically Julia was missing and no one could find her. They were knocking on her little caravan door. They thought she wasn’t in there because they were knocking and no one was answering. Everyone’s running around. I had to run back to her caravan, open the door. She had her headphones in. I think people were too afraid to open her door. [Laughs] We had to drag her out, and drag her onto the set. She just did it. It was one of those ones where it was just like—she miraculously somehow just pulls it off. The fact that we shot The Assistant in 17 days and this one in essentially 21, is because Michael, Julia and I are so close that we’ve gotten to the point where we don’t have to communicate that much. On the day, we can just go, and we get it.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nListen to Vanity Fair’s Little Gold Men podcast now."
