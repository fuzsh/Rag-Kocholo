Norwood, Commissioner December 1979 Bulletin 2044 For sale by the Superintendent of Documents, U .S. Government Printing Office Washington, D .C . 20402 Stock Number 027-001-02425-8 Preface For several decades the Bureau of Labor Statistics has published a biennial directory to provide an easily accessible factbook on the many aspects of union struc­ ture and membership. Information in this directory is submitted voluntarily by unions and employee associa­ tions in response to a questionnaire. The Bureau appre­ ciates the high degree of cooperation it has received to make this publication possible. This directory is divided into five sections. Part I re­ views the structure of the labor movement in the Unit­ ed States, concentrating particularly on the AFL-CIO. Part II lists national unions and professional and State employee associations as defined by the Bureau of La­ bor Statistics, giving the names of the major officers and officials as well as the number of members and lo­ cals or affiliates of each organization. Other details are presented in several appendixes. Part III provides a brief summary of significant developments in organized la­ bor between 1976 and the end of 1977. Part IV presents information on union and association membership in 1976. The various functions and activities that unions perform are discussed in part V. Indexes of unions and associations and names of officers and officials listed in the directory are provided at the end of the volume. Listings in the directory are not intended to confer status or recognition on any organization. The basic re­ quirement for inclusion was affiliation with the AFLCIO or, for unaffiliated unions, the existence of collec­ tive bargaining agreements with different employers in more than one State (except those meeting requirements for exclusive recognition). Professional or State em­ ployee associations were included if they reported that they engaged in collective bargaining or representation­ al activities and claimed membership in more than one State or, if claiming membership in only one State, they represented employees in two or more cities within the State. Every effort was made to include all unions and associations meeting these standards.

Structure of the Labor Movement A total of 203 organizations—170 classified as unions and 33 as professional and State employee associations— are listed in this Directory. AFL-CIO affiliates accounted for 106 of the unions; another 64 unions were unaffili­ ated. Approximately 13 percent of the combined mem­ bership for 1976 was represented by associations; mem­ bers of unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO represent­ ed approximately 77 percent of that year’s total union membership. make recommendations or give directions to the affili­ ate involved. Furthermore, by a two-thirds vote, the Executive Council may suspend a union found guilty on charges of corruption or subversion. The council also is given the right to (1) conduct hearings on charges against a council member of malfeasance or maladministration and report to the convention recommending the appro­ priate action; (2) remove from office or refuse to seat, by two-thirds vote, any executive officer or council member found to be a member or follower of a subver­ sive organization; (3) assist unions in organizing activ­ ities and charter new national and international unions not in jurisdictional conflict with existing ones; and (4) hear appeals in jurisdiction disputes. The AFL-CIO The constitution of the American Federation of La­ bor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, adopted at its founding convention in 1955, established an or­ ganizational structure closely resembling that of the for­ mer AFL but vested more authority over affiliates in the new Federation. The chief members of the Feder­ ation continued to be national and international unions, trade departments, State and local bodies, and directly affiliated local unions (chart 1). The supreme governing body of the AFL-CIO is the biennial convention. Each union is entitled to conven­ tion representation according to the membership on which the per capita tax1has been paid. Between conventions, the executive officers, assisted by the Executive Council and the General Board, di­ rect the affairs of the AFL-CIO. In brief, the functions of the two top officers and of the two governing bodies are as follows: General Board. This body consists of all 35 members of the Executive Council and a principal officer of each affiliated international and national union and depart­ ment. The General Board acts on matters referred to it by the executive officers or the Executive Council. It meets upon call of the president. Unlike members of the Executive Council, General Board members vote as representatives of their unions; voting strength is based on per capita payments to the Federation. Standing committees and staff. The constitution author­ izes the president to appoint standing committees to ex­ ecutive, legislative, political, educational, and other ac­ tivities. These committees operate under the direction of the president and are subject to the authority of the Executive Council and the convention. Twelve stand­ ing committees are operating at present; staff depart­ ments are established as needed. Executive officers. The president, as chief executive of­ ficer, has authority to interpret the constitution between meetings of the Executive Council. He also directs the staff of the Federation. The secretary-treasurer is re­ sponsible for all financial matters. Department o f Organization and Field Services. Meeting just before the opening of the 1973 general convention, the AFL-CIO’s Executive Council revised the role and function of the Department of Organization, by inte­ grating the regional offices of the former department with all AFL-CIO operations and programs. Reflect­ ing this expanded role, the name of the department was changed to the “Department of Organization and Field Services.’’ The director of the department is appointed by the president, subject to approval of the Executive Council. The department has its own staff and other resources necessary to carry out its activities. Executive Council. The Executive Council, consisting of 33 vice-presidents and the two executive officers, is the governing body between conventions. It must meet at least three times each year on request of the presi­ dent. Responsibilities of the council include proposing and evaluating legislation of interest to the labor move­ ment and safeguarding the Federation from corrupt or communist influence. To achieve the latter, the coun­ cil has the right to investigate any affiliate accused of wrongdoing and, upon completion of the investigation, 116 cents a month. 1 Chart 1.

The 1977 AFL-CIO constitution provides for nine trade and industrial de­ partments and others . . as may be established by the Executive Council or the Convention” (art. XI, sec. 1). Five departments were carried over from the AFL and a sixth, the Industrial Union Department, was added at the time of merger. A department made up of unions in the food and beverage industry, chartered in 1961, was disbanded at the 1965 convention but reinstated in November 1976. On November 6, 1974, a charter was issued to the Public Employee Department. In Decem­ ber 1977, the Council of AFL-CIO Unions for Profes­ sional Employees was granted department status to be­ come the Department for Professional Employees. Af­ filiation with departments is open to “all appropriate affiliated national and international unions and organ­ izing committees” (art. XI, sec. 1). Affiliates are obli­ gated to pay a department per capita tax which is de­ termined by the number of members coming within their jurisdiction. ates joined the Federation as fully autonomous unions and retained the same jurisdictional rights held before the merger. These principles are expressed as follows in article III, section 4, of the constitution: “The integ­ rity of each. . .affiliate of this Federation shall be main­ tained and preserved.” Concepts of autonomy and ju­ risdictional rights are further supported in article III, section 7, which gives the Executive Council the right to issue charters to new organizations only if their ju­ risdiction does not conflict with that of present affilia­ tes because “each affiliated national and international union is entitled to have its autonomy, integrity and ju­ risdiction protected and preserved.” With respect to craft versus industrial form of organization—the issue primarily responsible for the 1935 split—the constitu­ tion recognizes that “both craft and industrial unions are appropriate, equal, and necessary as methods of trade union organization. . .” (art. VIII, sec. 9). The constitution acknowledges the existence of overlapping jurisdictions which might invite conflict within the Fed­ eration. Affilates are urged to eliminate such problems “through the process of voluntary agreement or volun­ tary merger in consultation with the appropriate offi­ cials of the Federation” (art. Ill, sec. 10). New and enlarged machinery to replace procedures previously provided for under the No-Raiding Agree­ ment (art. Ill, sec 4) were adopted at the 1961 conven­ tion and incorporated into a new section of the consti­ tution, article XXI, Settlement of Internal Disputes, ef­ fective January 1, 1962 (art. XX in the 1977 constitu­ tion). Under this article, affiliates are required to re­ spect both the established collective bargaining and the work relationships of every other affiliate. In a dispute, the case first goes to a mediator chosen from a panel “composed of persons from within the labor movement” (art. XX, sec 8). Should the mediator be unable to set­ tle the dispute within 14 days, it is then referred to an impartial umpire selected from a panel “composed of prominent and respected persons. . .” (art. XX, sec 9), for a decision which is effected 5 days after it has been handed down, unless an appeal has been filed. An ap­ peal case is first referred to a subcommittee of the Ex­ ecutive Council, which can either dismiss it or submit it to the full Executive Council for a final decision. A variety of sanctions are provided against noncomplying unions, including loss of the right to invoke the dispute settlement machinery and possible suspension. The Fed­ eration is further authorized to publicize the fact that a union has refused to comply with a decision and that it can extend “every appropriate assistance and aid” (art. XX, sec. 15) to an aggrieved union. A panel of impartial umpires and a panel of officers of international unions handle the mediation of internal disputes. All members of the Federation’s Executive Council serve on subcommittees which screen appeals and hear complaints of noncompliance. According to the Executive Council’s report to the State and central bodies. Under the AFL-CIO consti­ tution, the Executive Council is authorized to establish central bodies on a city, State, or other regional basis, composed of locals of national unions, organizing com­ mittees, and directly affiliated local unions. In 1977 there were 51 State bodies, including one for Puerto Rico, and 745 local central bodies. Organizing committees. The Executive Council has the authority to issue charters to groups not eligible for membership in national unions and to combine directly affiliated local unions into organizing committees. These committees have the same status as national unions, ex­ cept that they are under control of the Federation. In February 1976, the only organizing committee was dis­ solved when the AFL-CIO Executive Council issued a union charter to the School Administrators and Super­ visors Organizing Committee. The new union is known as the American Federation of School Administrators (AFL-CIO). Directly affiliated local unions. When the Federation was formed, local trade and federal labor unions (AFL) and local industrial unions (CIO) had a combined mem­ bership of 181,000. These local unions, having received charters from both federations, became directly affilia­ ted local unions of the AFL-CIO and in June 1977 claimed approximately 42,000 members. Under the con­ stitution of the merged Federation, the Executive Coun­ cil of the AFL-CIO is responsible for issuing charters and controlling the affairs of these locals. The council also is under obligation at the request of the locals to combine them into national unions, organizing commit­ tees, or national councils where appropriate. Jurisdictional problems. Former AFL and CIO affili­ 3 AFL-CIO convention in 1977, a total of 1,794 cases had been filed through June 1977 under the Internal Disputes Plan since its inception in 1962. Fifty-six per­ cent (1,008) of the complaints were settled by media­ tion; only 33 were pendiing in mid-1977. Of the 730 to be decided by an impartial umpire, 681 were settled. Factfinding reports were filed in 19 cases; 4 cases are still pending. Only 23 decisions have not been complied with by the union and in these cases sanctions were imposed by the Executive Council. In 10 of these in­ stances, compliance was eventually achieved. considerable autonomy on specific policy issues, includ­ ing work stoppages. Part II lists the 26 AGE affiliates that engage in collective bargaining or representational activities. The second federation listed is the National Federation of Independent Unions (NFIU). Unions af­ filiated with the NFIU which had negotiated agreements covering different employers in more than one State are included among the unaffiliated, or independent, unions discussed below. Unaffiliated or independent unions A total of 63 national or internationl unions not af­ filiated with the AFL-CIO were known to the Bureau in 1976. All of the unaffiliated unions (other than those organizing government employees) reported agree­ ments covering different employers in more than one State.2 The combined membership of these unions for 1976 was 4.5 million, and included members of longestablished and well-known organizations such as the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the United Mine Workers of America. Approximately four-fifths of the membership in unaffiliated national and interna­ tional unions in 1976 were in unions once affiliated with the AFL-CIO or the former CIO. These include the United Automobile Workers and expelled unions such as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the Unit­ ed Electrical Workers (UE), the Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union, and the Distributive Workers. Unaffiliated local unions generally are confined to a single establishment, employer, or locality and there­ fore do not meet the Bureau’s definition of a national union used to compile this and previous directories. A 1977 Bureau of survey showed about 332,000 members in 900 unaffiliated local unions. According to the Bu­ reau’s finding, these local independent unions represent­ ed approximately 1.6 percent of the total 1976 union membership in the United States. Councils The Council of AFL-CIO Unions for Professional Employees was organized in March 1967 and was grant­ ed Department status in December 1977. This left the AFL-CIO without any councils for the first time since its inception in 1955. Railway Labor Executives’ Association This Association is composed of the president of the Railway Employes’ Department (AFL-CIO) and a ma­ jor official from each of the 19 labor unions, of which all but one are affiliated with the AFL-CIO. Ten of these unions have virtually all of their membership in the railroad industry; the remaining nine are established principally in other industries. In 1975, unions affiliated with the Congress of Rail­ way Unions agreed to dissolve the organization, and all but one joined the Railway Labor Executives’ Associ­ ation (RLEA) on April 1 of that year. The Congress had been formed in December 1969 after five unions withdrew from the RLEA over a dispute involving proposed compulsory retirement and pension benefit legislation. The RLEA is not a federation of unions, but functions as a policy-making body on legislative and other matters of material interest to railroad workers. Professional and State employee associations Other federations Thirty-three associations known to be engaged in col­ lective bargaining activities as of early 1979 are listed in part II. The membership series, which reflects 1976 data, includes 35 associations having 3 million members. Organizations are listed which either act as a feder­ ation or have some characteristics of a federation, such as the issuance of charters to, and the maintenance of, a formal affiliation among autonomous labor organiz­ ations. The Assembly of Governmental Employees (AGE), founded in 1952 as the National Conference of Inde­ pendent Public Employees Organizations, is made up of 50 State, county, and local affiliated organizations. AGE is primarily concerned with establishing and main­ taining die merit principle, although its affiliates have 2The requirement pertaining to collective bargaining agreements was waived for organizations of government workers. Since Execu­ tive Orders 10988 and 11491 were issued, the Bureau has attempted to include Federal unions holding exclusive bargaining rights. Or­ ganizations representing postal employees have been included. Some unaffiliated unions, interstate in scope, may have been omitted be­ cause of inadequate information about their existence or scope. 4 Part II.

Membership: 60,000; affiliated unions, 90. 19 NATIONAL UNIONS AND EMPLOYEE ASSOCIATIONS A total of 167 national labor unions and 33 profes­ sional and State employee associations as defined in the following paragraph are listed in this section. Listings of major subordinate or semiautonomous branches of unions are indented below the parent union or association. All 102 AFL-CIO national unions are listed, in ad­ dition to 65 unions not affiliated with the AFL-CIO. Unions in the latter category were included if infor­ mation indicated that they had negotiated contracts with different employers in more than one State or, in the case of Federal Government unions, exclusive bargaining rights under Executive Order 11491. Em­ ployee associations which represent their members in collective bargaining were included if they a) re­ ported membership in more than one State, or b) represented members in two or more major cities of any individual State. The Assembly of Governmental Employees and the National Federation of Indepen­ dent Unions are listed under Other Federations of National Unions and Employee Associations on p. 0 Unions and associations were asked to report their average annual dues-paying membership for 1975 and 1976, and the number of locals in operation at the end of 1976. If an organization did not report membership, the space for membership was left blank. For membership of nonreporting AFL-CIO af­ filiates, paid per capita membership as reported in the 1977 convention proceedings was used and is in­ dicated by an asterisk. Membership totals of major subordinate or semiautonomous branches of labor or­ ganizations are reported separately and are not in­ cluded in the figure shown for the parent organiza­ tion with the exception of the Actors and Artistes (AFL-CIO), and the National Education Association (Ind.). Wherever possible, each organization is listed alphabetically by the key word or words identifying the craft or industry organized by the union. For the convenience of those who customarily identify a union by its full title (e.g., International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers), a finding index begins on p. 00. Union affiliation is indicated by (AFL-CIO) for American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, (Ind.) for unaffiliated or independent unions, or (AGE) for As­ sembly of Governmental Employees. Affiliates of the National Federation of Independent Unions are identified by footnotes. Most unions and associations provided the necessa­ ry information for an adequate listing. For some, in­ formation was supplemented by reference to official union sources such as convention proceedings, of­ ficers’ reports, or journals. In an effort to maintain current listings, all recent changes other than those related to membership and locals were incorporated wherever possible. 20 Secretary-treasurer: Law rence Davidson.
