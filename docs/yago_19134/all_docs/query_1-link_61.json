        "text": "24 AUGUST 2020 .\n\nMy Journey through Life with the Assam Regt\n\nJOHNY MUKERJEE\n\nFormative Yrs\n\nAt age eight years, I had set my mind on joining the RIMC – I had heard about it from my friends in school. Much to my father’s dismay, I insisted on sitting for the RIMC all India entrance test – I came first in the all India merit list. At the last moment however my father refused to allow me to join. As I grew older my eyesight had deteriorated, I was forced to consider joining the Army. I then appeared for the UPSC CDS Entrance Exam, to join the NDA. I appeared for the exam and came first, then went for the SSB interviews, and the medical tests – I cleared all and was selected to join the 24th NDA Course and joined in July 1960. We were awarded an ISc degree when we passed out after our final examination. We passed out of the NDA, in June 1963 and moved to the IMA. Due to the war the IMA had cut out all ceremonials and frills and only a shortened wartime training course was being run. We passed out and were commissioned on 9 Feb 64 after a simply parade.\n\nAt the IMA one of our pl cdrs was a very smart Capt Bahugana from 3 Kumaon. He had impressed me as an offr and as we were to give our choices as to which Regt we wished to join, I gave my choice as the Inf, even though I was a science stream cadet from NDA and for Capt Bahugana’s Regt. He assured me I would get my choice as I was within the first ten of the IMA’s Order of Merit. I was overjoyed and duly purchased all the uniform accoutrements such as the belt, beret, heckle, badges and so on, of the Kumaon Regt.\n\nLittle did I know that then Capt S K Pillai, another very smart pl cdr from the Assam Regt and had got the approval for me to be given his bn – 3 Assam. My knowledge of the ASSAM Regt was limited to SM and Hony Capt Guneswar Bora, also known as “Sakatwala”, from 3 ASSAM, who was the Drill SM (the first Indian to take over from the British Regtl Sgt Maj Ayling) – a tremendous man who was greatly respected and feared by all of us cadets at the NDA. I have yet to see a SM of that stature again in the Army! Despite this, I did not wish to join the ASSAM Regt – in those days, it was not considered a good Regt. It had recently had a mutiny in one of its bns, its men were reputed to be perpetually AWOL, and they came from areas where insurgency was spiralling out of control.\n\nOn 7 Feb 64, I was informed that I was to be commissioned to 3 ASSAM. I was furious and that is the last time I remember shedding copious tears. I tried my best to get it changed, but in reply was only counselled, ‘The ASSAM Regt needs good offrs – you will not regret it’. I thus received my commission into the Assam Regt with no fan fare on 9 Feb 64. So, off I went – most unhappily to report at the ARC, Shillong as a 2nd Lt. How times have changed! Today the Assam Regt, is now one of the most sought after in the IA – even taking their pick of the offrs they want.\n\nRegtl Orientation\n\nWe had been first sent to the ARC for Regtl Orientation before being sent to our bns. In those days, we had a much longer period of attachment with the ARC than today. When we reached Shillong Out Agency we were met by a JCO from the ARC – our stuff was loaded into a truck and we drove to the ARC at the other end of town – we were then housed in the Trg Bn along with the rects as was the case with all new offrs.\n\nWe spent only a few days at the ARC, which was commanded by, (then) Col T Sailo. During this time we were lectured nonstop on various facets of the Regt. On the fourth day, at the dep parade, we were given a lecture by Col Sailo and were sent to 8 Mtn Div, which was deployed on CI ops in Nagaland. We (2nd Lt Yogi Ahluwalia and I) were to spend almost the next two months under the tutelage of Papa Pande, then Dy GOC of the Div and our Col of the Regt.\n\nWe went by rd to Gauhati and then by train to Dimapur. Insurgency was at its peak in Nagaland, so we had to travel on specified convoy days and convoy timings. At Dimapur, we were put up at the home of SM (Retd) G Angami of 1 ASSAM, who recounted stories of the Battles of Jessami and Kohima of the World War II. During each of these night halts spent at homes of retired Rhinos, we learnt more about our men – about their life style, priorities, beliefs, approach to life, their families and attitudes, customs and so on and about their people.\n\nWe spent one night with Papa Pande, who regaled us with stories about the Regt. The night we spent with Papa Pande remains a vivid experience even 56 years later. He then sent us off to see the World War II battle fds of 1 ASSAM in Manipur, Jessami, Kharasom and Kohima with guides from the Regt, who briefed us on the battles on ground. We also visited all the cemeteries and war memorials. It was a tremendous experience which is still vivid in my memory, 56 years later.\n\nIn Manipur, we stayed with men of some of our different tribes – Kukis, Paites, Mizos, Anals, Tangkhuls, Maos, Rengmas and Meiteis and in Nagaland with most of the Western Naga tribes including the Aos, Angamis, Chakesangs and Lothas. Each time, we stayed with a veteran Rhino; it helped expand our knowledge about the NE and the Regt and which gave us a comprehensive insight into the area, its peoples and the soldiers and this period. It was an excellent foundation on which to begin our ‘real’ Army career.\n\nWe travelled extensively on foot with our pl sized escort from the RAJPUT Regiment. After this remarkable adventure, we left Nagaland to report via Shillong to our units.\n\nRecruiting Trips to learn about the men\n\nBy now I had forgotten all my passing out regrets! At that time, the ARC used to send out recruiting parties; such parties were detailed from the Bns of the Regt. The advice at the time was that offrs were encouraged, till the completion of six years’ service, to give up their annual leave (60 days) each year on recruitment drives(with the help of veteran Rhinos of the Regt). Thus, my first years’ leave in 1964 was spent on a recruiting trip to Mizoram. Then, in early 1965, I went to South ASSAM and Khasi, Jaintia Hills and Garo Hills, in 1966 to Tripura, in 1967 to East Nagaland and Tirap, Changlang and Lohit. In 1968 recruiting was in Upper Assam – Nowgong, Jorhat and undivided Dibrugarh. In 1969 our recruiting campaign took us to Kameng, Subansiri, Siang and Dibang districts of Arunachal and Sonitpur and North Lakhimpur districts of ASSAM.\n\nThus, our knowledge and experience we gained during this time, of our men and their homes was almost unparalleled. This practice of personally recruiting our soldiers died out after the 1971 war. I wonder whether there is any scope of reintroducing this experience in today’s Army as I feel that many of our offrs of today have only ltd and bookish knowledge of the Regt and our men!\n\nWhen I joined 3 ASSAM the CO was Lt Col N Ramachandran and the SM was G C Rajbongshi, both extremely competent men in their respective fields and worth emulating. The bn was at that time stationed at New Mal Junc in North Bengal, having mov there from Hasimara about six months ago and about to proceed on a long exercise. I was assigned as a pl cdr to B Coy with the JCO being Sub Imtinangshi Ao.\n\nIn the persisting 1962 war hysteria the bn was posted 1500 men against an auth of 806! My pl had 100 men posted against an auth of 36! We were 32 offrs against 12 auth, incl then Maj Jackson De Cruze (formerly a Sgt from the Royal Sigs), Maj S S Walia, Capt S K Sharma, Capt L K A R Das, Lt D S Rai, 2nd Lt T K Bardhan (the senior most 2nd Lt), 2nd Lt Lanky Manral. The rest of us were all 2nd Lts incl Martin Khongmen and Lalit Mohan Sah. We were pl str of subns. We were from all walks of life – a college professor, an actor, a film director, a policeman, farmers, a restaurant owner and many others who had all joined out of sheer patriotism. All 22 of us 2nd Lts, young and full of undirected energy, creating total and utter confusion! Our bosses often ran out of ideas of what to do with us other than train and train and train!\n\nDining in and Burning Hut\n\n3 Assam was located about a km away from New Mal village (with a paan shop manned by a beautiful Gurkha girl and was therefore always patronised by the Bn) in the midst of tea gardens on the foothills of the North Bengal Himalayas. The entire Bn was housed in bamboo huts on the pattern of a tribal village of NE India. As I reached I was taken to the Bn HQs and was introduced to the CO, 2IC and the Adjt – four of us 2nd Lts had reported for duty together – self, a 2nd Lt Ahlawat (an ECO), 2nd Lt Y K Ahluwalia (again an ECO) and a 2nd Lt Chakravorty (another ECO) we were informed that we would be dined in (welcomed) at the Offr’s Mess as is customary that evening. We were then sent off after completing necessary documentation to report to our assigned Coys – mine being B Coy.\n\nIn the evening as required we reported to the Offr’s Mess in our field mess dress which was olive green bush shirts and trousers. We were then introduced to all the offrs. As was customary we were plied with alcohol whether we were accustomed to it or not. We were thus totally drunk by the time we went in for dinner, which was a semi formal affair served in three courses. This was followed by a toast to the President. After this we had been advised that we all had to give a speech of at least 45 mins regarding ourselves which was to be followed by a toast to the Bn. I was to be last to speak – it seemed an interminable wait with Alhawat’s speech being, I was born on …. punctuated by long pauses and a ‘what next’! I vaguely remember giving out my life history and then going off to sleep at the table. I was thereafter told that we were carried out to our Qtrs for the night.\n\nI had been put in one room of a three room bamboo basha with a very shaky bamboo floor. The other side of the basha was occupied by the 2IC, Maj Jackson D’cruz. The basha was lit by a lantern on a rickety bamboo table. I was half carried in and dumped on the bed where I somehow took off my clothes and collapsed on the bamboo bed. When I collapsed on the bed, the table had apparently shaken, and the lantern had fallen on the bamboo floor and broken – unknown to me the floor had then caught fire which rapidly spread to the rest of the basha. I awoke to discover I was being carried out from the basha naked by the duty JCO. I was later told that the 2IC had bolted out of his side of the basha with his pyjamas burning! I was there after debarred from staying anywhere near the 2IC! That is the description of my first day with 3 Assam, also colloquially called the ‘Phantom Rhinos’.\n\nCapt Lalit Mohan Sah\n\nI can never forget to pay tribute to this Rhino veteran. He was from ECO 1 in 1963, consequent to the Chinese aggression. He was an English College Professor from Naini Tal, who joined out of sheer patriotism, even though he was doing extremely well in civilian life. He did very well with us in 3 ASSAM – he was our hockey team Capt, who took us on to win the Div Hockey Championship. He, however, left in early 1965. As soon as the 1965 War broke out he joined up the second time out of sheer patriotism under the res liability clause. On his demand he was back with us in 3 ASSAM. He left in 1968 and rejoined immediately following 1971 and again demanded and got 3 ASSAM. A pure blooded Rhino and patriot – a wonderful man with tremendous Rhino spirit – there is so much to learn from him for today’s’ and future generations!\n\nMy First Collective Trg\n\nAfter two days, we set off on our first maj collective trg ex into the hills of North Bengal and Sikkim; at that time ASSAM Regt Bns had been classified as jungle tps and were to be trained to operate behind enemy lines for long periods of time. In this ex our Bn was to act as Chandals (Chinese), as the enemy to the div. We were tasked to overrun the Div HQs using Chandal tactics, i.e., by an attack by infiltration from the rear. The ex went through all the stages – moving to the conc area, then the assy area, then moving to and preparation of the firm base defs in a HAA. This was followed by infilt the “ex en lines”, through thick jungle over a route of about 100 kms. Once we had completed the infilt we firmed in behind the en and carried out recce and ptl msns to ident our objs. The ex was to culminate in the overrunning of the Div HQ.\n\nWe were to move totally cross country through the jungles on man pack basis – our orders were to carry 7 days’ amn, 3 days’ rations, wpns and EI Clo (winter clo). Another 5 days load made up of rocks were added to our packs for endurance trg. We were to be self contained with no resupply and live off the jungle for the duration of the ex (over a month). For this duration we lived with the men and ate with them. That is where I learnt to eat everything that mov in the jungle (incl wild cats, hyena, birds of all types, bear, elephant and deer besides other animals and insects) as also all sorts of jungle vegetables and herbs! We learnt jungle craft/lore and about tribal traps and what our men were capable of. It was stupendous! Needless to say we were successful and ended the ex one week early with the bn overrunning the Div HQs, with all its actions being totally undetected. It is important for our offrs to ensure that we do what is required to nurture these skills, as our men are also much more urbanised than before.\n\nRegtl Trg to be a Good Offr\n\nShortly after the ex was over in Mar 64, we moved to our op area in East Sikkim and North Bengal Hills, with 2 Assam relieving us at New Mal Junc. My vivid recollections of the pd are that we were with our men day and ni. In those days, till you had completed six months’ service, you lived with them and trained and trained and trained – day and night. There was not a hill in North Bengal or Sikkim that we had not climbed and ex upon. The 100 str pl would fall in, in the morning with me in front and my senior JCO behind – he would then salute and give me the report in our typical regtl Hindi and after that he would order me in English – “Join in Sahib”! I was thereafter one of the members of the pl under his comd and trg to learn the craft as a ldr. I learnt so much from Sub Imtinangshi Ao – a gem of a JCO.\n\nSr Sub\n\nThe Army had a custom of nominating the sr most sub (denotes combination of 2nd Lts and Lts) as the ‘sr sub’ in charge of all other subs including our disc, adherence to customs and offr like behaviour. In our case the sr sub was Lt Dharam Shamsher Rai, a happy go lucky and music loving offr from Nepal and North Bengal (relations from both places – a wonderful man who had the unfortunate and onerous task of keeping his pl worth of subs in order.\n\nAll of us being young and bubbling with energy were always upto some mischief or the other. Every night he used to fall us in front of his tent and give us a moral lecture for a min of one hr after dinner – sometimes this used to extend to two to three hrs before he let us go to bed – this put us off to no small extent as we had to get up for PT parade by 0430 am every morning. All 22 of us therefore decided to teach him a lesson. He used to stay in a large square comfortable tent – the rest of us used to live in tiny 40 lb tents (which were about 6 feet by 5 feet) with two of us jr 2nd Lts to a tent in the offr’s colony called the “Bhangi Colony” close to the offr’s mess. We therefore got together one night after our nightly sermon, a waited in the bushes for the bn and Dharam to go to sleep. At about 1 am we pulled out all the tent pegs holding up his tent and collapsed it on the sleeping sr sub – we then did a Naga dance on top of the tent and him for the next 15 min before we rushed off and went to sleep.\n\nNext morning at the PT parade at 5 AM there was hell to pay. We were duly produced before the CO, he didn’t say much to us other than that we must be given opportunity to expend our excess energy and to teach us a lesson of disc. We were ordered to return with our complete pls in complete FSMO with 7 days rations and amn and EI clo and blankets – about 80 kgs of load on our backs. We were then given a route for a speed march of about 200 kms to be executed in four days with check points enroute where we were checked. So much for our teaching the Sr Sub a lesson!\n\nAdjutant’s Legacy In early 1965 I had been temporarily been appointed the IO who was responsible to look after all int aspects for the bn’s operations and assist the CO. This warranted a fair amount of office work in close coordination with the Adjt at the Bn HQs. One fine day we were all horrified when we were informed by the Rly Station Master that 13 wagon loads of timber sleepers had arrived for us and that we should pay the due amount of some Rs 20 lakhs!!\n\nI was asked to investigate and find out what all this is about. I checked and found that the timber had come to us correctly from COD Cheoki and that we had demanded it through the trg br of the Bn HQrs, for making tgts for firing practice. The indent had been prepared by the training clerk who had put the decimal point in the wrong place, i.e. instead of demanding some 13.000 sq m of timber the demand read about 13000.00 sq m of timber or 13 wagon loads of it. The matter was reported to the CO who almost had a heart attack – and started thinking of selling his wife’s jewellery to pay for it! Fortunately good sense prevailed with us all and we managed to get all our friends in other units of the entire div purchase some wood – the entire timber was thus distributed and paid for by all through the trg grants. Subsequently we all had a good drink at the expense of the Adjt!\n\n1965 Indo Pak War – Dinhata and Krshnanagar\n\nIn Jul 65 we moved to Dinhata, our conc area near Cooch Bihar in North Bengal in local forests and groves in preparation to advancing into East Pakistan in anticipation of orders in the 1965 Indo Pakistan War. Here we carried out crash op oriented trg and op recce, as we had prior to this been prepared for mtn warfare against the Chinese – whereas we were now required to be prep for ops in the riverine terrain of East Pak. The Bn remained poised at Dinhata along with the rest of the fmn, to enter East Pak till the war ended in Sep 65 – we thereafter continued to remain so poised till the Tashkent Agreement in Jan 66.\n\nMechanical Transport Officer at Krishnanagar\n\nWhile at Krishnanagar, after 2 and half years as a Coy offr and then as a pl cdr, I became the MTO – we had just taken over the MT from another unit. The tpt was all old World War II vintage, in very bad condition – snub nosed Chevrolets and Dodges. My attempts at ‘Geru Chuna’ (painting up the area) were snubbed by the CO. He said “Do not ever waste your time on doing such frivolous things! Know your job and ensure you and your men perform well in executing your duties. All you have to ensure is that your area and vehicles are neat and clean your vehs roadworthy and that all of your men know how to drive and maint your vehs properly.”\n\nMoral Courage\n\nWe then had the inspection of our MT, and much to my discredit, we got a “Bad” remark for the state of our vehs, along with instrs for a re-insp after two months. The CO’s remarks on the insp report sent onto to the Bde Cdr and the GOC read, “I am not unduly concerned by the remarks of the insp offr, given the state of the tpt that we took over – necessary remedial action will be ensured”. I learnt so much from his moral courage. Since the “Bad” report also reflected on the wkshop, we received total coop from them and after two months, we earned an “Excellent” report at the next insp.\n\nSometime thereafter, we offrs were all lined up at 8.30 AM and awaiting a first visit from the new Div Cdr. We waited till 9 AM – there was still no sign of the Gen. Our CO, then Lt Col N Ramachandran, told us to break off and carry on with our trg and that as and when the GOC came, he would bring him to the trg areas to meet us. I was then offg as the IO and so was with the CO. The GOC arrived at 09.30 AM – 1 hour late. CO came out of his office to receive him as he arrived. The GOC asked, “Where are your offrs?” The CO replied, “Sir, my men are busy trg – how can the offrs be away from their duties? They waited for 30 minutes, but as you were late I sent them to carry on with trg. You will meet them in the trg area”. The GOC accepted the CO’s comment with a smile – “You are right” said the Gen. The lesson learnt that day, was of punctuality and earnestness in doing one’s duty! How many Regts have had offrs like that to train under? There were so many other stories. Those were the good old days!\n\nQualities/Characteristics of Our Men seen as a pl cdr\n\nI learnt of the wonderful qualities of our men – simplicity, truthfulness, honesty, loyalty and courage. It was necessary to earn our men’s respect as an offr. Times have of course now changed considerably; however, in those days if a man respected you, he would run after and salute you with a smile. He would, without hesitation, even give his life for you. If he did not respect you, he would turn the other way and pretend not to have seen you!\n\nWe also learnt about the problem of AWOL and desertion w/o arms. It must be understood that the NER was extremely undeveloped, with journeys being so difficult; it would sometimes take the soldiers as long as 30 days to reach their homes. Permissible journey periods were invariably much less. In addition, as the area was in the throes of insurgency, there were specific convoy days, which delayed movs further. On reaching home there would be a dozen things for the men to attend to – jhooming, harvesting, the wife’s pregnancy, illness and so on. There were even cases where the insurgents abducted our men. There was a lack of telecomn facilities to request for extns of leave. It is under these circumstances that the number of cases of late return from leave was fairly large, which was frowned upon by all. As per the Army Act, an absence of more than 30 days led to the man being declared a deserter. All these were treated as offences under the Army Act and were punishable. Our punishment rates were therefore also high.\n\nToday, times have changed considerably. Comn networks have vastly improved, insurgency is under control, there has been a great deal of devp, aspirations have risen due to exposure, while jobs are now difficult to come by and with the present pay and perks, the Army has a good standing. Consequently, absence and desertion are, much much less than in our time. Also, gone are the days when a soldier would get a telegram stating, “Wife become baby – cum soon!”\n\nIncident of New Abhor Mess Waiter\n\nTo illustrate the simplicity of our men, I must relate an incident involving one of our men who had been recently deputed to serve us at the Offr’s Mess. One day we had some offrs visiting the unit. A formal lunch had therefore been planned for them at the Offr’s Mess. The Mess was then housed in two large EP/IP tents joined together with the sides open and covered with cam nets to allow ventilation and for us to be able to call the staff loc outside easily. The staff had been trained repeatedly in their duties. The lunch was conducted as planned and Indian food had been served. There was therefore a requirement of finger bowls for the offrs to wash their soiled finger after the meal.\n\nAs I was in charge of the food (the food member of the mess committee), I sig to this Abhor tribe boy who was acting as the mess waiter with a hand sig to bring in the finger bowls – he was standing outside the tent. He thought I was joking and he sig back in exactly the same fashion with a big grin! My sig and his response was repeated three times over – as he simply could not understand! I had to get up go outside and explain to the staff to send the finger bowls! This is one of the many examples of our men’s simplicity!\n\nIn Jan 66, we were ordered to move to Krishnanagar in West Bengal, again with a similar operational task in East Pakistan. The mov was by road – an extremely interesting experience with the entire bn moving in a mix of its own tpt, addl Army trucks from the Army’s GT Coys and Civ trucks. At Krishnanagar we camped in a forest a little outside the town. Immediately after arrival Lt Col N Ramachandran our CO was posted out – there was much that I had learned from him. The new CO, Lt Col K S Brar an old offr of the Bn took over as the new CO. He was an excellent sportsman and both he and his wife were good people who had a soft corner for me. Shortly thereafter Maj Shishupal Ranpal again an old offr of the bn was posted in as the 2IC and Maj Jackson D’Cruz, posted out. We again carried out extensive trg at Krishnanagar, till we were ordered to mov our peace stn at Gaya in Aug 66.\n\nMove to Gaya\n\nWe moved to Gaya in Aug 66 by mil spec train – a wonderful experience, where the entire bn with all its loads moved by one train together with passenger coaches of all classes for all the men, first cl for the offrs, closed wagons for our stores and the men’s kitchens and Flat wagons for all our vehs – a long train which moved on a fixed schedule with halts at various pre-arranged stns for the men’s bed tea, breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner. As the journey also involved crossing the Ganges by ferry and change of Gauge it took approx five days to reach our destination. As we were mov to a peace stn some families joined us. The Offr’s Mess was functional and we had excellent food, beer and overall really enjoyed ourselves.\n\nPeriod in Gaya\n\nThe Bn was in Gaya, Bihar till November 1968 and the offr’s and men’s families joined us there. I had been appointed the Adjt of the Bn and had become a Capt. Our tenure at Gaya was now spent on extensive trg for ops in the West against Pakistan. We thus hunted out canals and practiced defence and attack across them by day and night.\n\nWe also in 1967, had to move suddenly to Calcutta for IS duties at the Cossipore amn factory as the entire very large number of staff (more than 10,000) had gone on strike, was violent and the factory was under threat – we brought the sit under cont in no time. I then managed to give the offrs a tour of Calcutta’s recreational and party spots before we went back to Gaya.\n\nWe also had a number of visits to Ranchi for trg and ex and to the hills of Neturhat for fd firing. Gaya was otherwise a good and peaceful tenure and during the same I was sent to attend the RSO Course at the MCTE, also at Mhow. The Course was most educative plus Mhow was a good break from the hustle and bustle of unit life – I recd an instrs grading on this course.\n\nIn Nov 68 the Bn was moved to Fazilka, in Punjab, again by spec train – just before the Bn mov to Fazilka, Lt Col Shishupal Ranpal was apptd the CO of 3 Assam and Lt Col K S Brar, the present CO posted out on staff. Lt Col Shishupal was a very nice person who was well liked by all. He was extremely hard working and did a lot for the Bn. Both Col Shishupal and his wife were like parents to me and we became very close. Maj S K Pillai (Later Lt Gen) one of the Bn’s old timers returned to the Bn and was appointed the 2IC. Maj Pillai being the 2IC and I had become very close as we had to work very closely together as 2IC and Adjutant.\n\nMove to and Tenure at Fazilka\n\nThe move to Fazilka in Nov 68 by spec train was again extremely enjoyable but relatively uneventful. The Bn had earlier been located at Fazilka in 1956 for a short period and then at Husseiniwala at Ferozepur. The Bn was located just outside the town in the ltd accn available which was adequate for only part of the Bn – the bal was housed in tentage. As Fazilka was again a peace stn families were loc with the Bn. I continued on arrival as the Adjt of the Bn. The Bn’s op role was def based on the DCB and a canal system located a few kms West of Fazilka for the def of Fazilka.\n\nThe entire period from Dec 68, 69, 70 till Mar 71, was spent on extensive trg for the op role, promotion and specialist cadres and exercises. I addition to my duties as the Adjt, I was the offr in charge of all the promotion cadres. I was therefore extremely busy. The Bn was also actively involved in Op Alert and other exs and fd firing besides routine peacetime commitments.\n\nMy close friends and compatriots at that time were, Majs S K Pillai , T K Bardhan, Maj Martin Khongmen and Maj Gurdip Singh. During this period I met my late brother in law and subsequently close friend, the late Maj L Khiangte who had just returned from the IMA where he had been an instr.\n\n101 Comn Z Area\n\nIn Mar 70, I was posted out of 3 Assam on staff to HQs 101 Comn Z Area at Shillong as the SC ‘Q’ (Wks and Plg) out of the blue. At 101 Area I was the OIC of acquisition/requisitioning/hiring of all lands, housing and its constr for the Army, the adm of all Cantts, KLPs and Zonal Plans for mil stns and their devp in all the seven NE States which was the area of responsibility of 101Comn Z Area – a colossal responsibility which kept me extremely busy and constantly touring the NE. During my tenure I was the offr who planned the acquisition of land and constr of the Umroi (Barapani) Mil Stn in Meghalaya, expansion of Narangi and the devp and repair and maint of all mil stns and cantts in the NE. Having never dealt with such a range of subjects before it was a tremendous learning experience for me.\n\nAfter settling down at HQs 101 Comn Z Area, I visited the ARC frequently and as it was functioning under us I was in a posn to act as their LO to the Area HQs and do whatever was possible for them especially matters related to constr, land and repair and maint matters related to the MES.\n\nI then applied formally for permission to get married as reqd by custom in the Army to my CO, the Col Adm. The wedding ceremony with Sue, Maj Khiangte’s sister, was held at about 2 PM by Pastor Luka, the then ARC Pastor. We then mov out ceremoniously under an arch of crossed dahs given by soldiers from the ARC (Hollywood style)! Some photos are given in the gallery.\n\nBy Dec 71 the sit in Bangladesh was bad and we had all been preparing for war. Besides 4 Corps ops from the East, 33 Corps from the West, it was envisaged that 101 Comn Z Area comprising equivalent of a Div size force (95 Mtn Bde, FJ Sect (Bde strength), Echo Sect (incl two coys plus worth from the ARC and 58 GTC, an additional Bn operating from Dawki (Meghalaya), a BSF Bn), 2 Para Bn to be dropped at Tangeil in Bangladesh, plus about a Div worth of Mukti Bahini grouped with subordinate fmns, was to advance from conc areas in Meghalaya on Tangeil and then Dacca in East Pakistan.\n\nOp of such large forces in riverine terrain with ltd rds, obviously demanded a colossal lgs build up of lakhs of tons of amn, ord stores/clo, fuel, rations, engr stores, br eqpt, sig stores, spares for all types of eqpt, veh, med eqp, drugs and stores, canteen stores, misc other stores and est of Corps and Div Maint Areas and ests for their cont, manning and protection, close to the specified conc areas. Bengal Area was tasked in this regard to do so in Bengal and 101 Comn Z Area in Tripura, Assam and Meghalaya.\n\nDuring the training of the Mukti Bahini (May/June 1971 onwards) and Lgs build up phases (Mar 71 onwards), I was put in charge of supervising the lgs build up and org of the three CMA/DMAs at Udaipur/Teliamura in Tripura, near Silchar in Assam, and near Tura in Garo Hills (Meghalaya) for 4 Corps, 8 Mtn Div and 101 Comn Z Area. We (particularly Bengali offrs) were also given charge of supervising trg of the Mukti Bahini in Echo 1 Sect at the Balat, Barsora and Shella trg camps, set up near the Meghalaya/Bangladesh Border. We were given adequate direct supervisory staff from the Regtl Centres/elsewhere to supervise the trg at each of the trg camps. Ops under our supervision from these camps were launched only from Aug/Sep onwards by which time the Mukti Bahini at the camps had been satisfactorily trained.\n\nI was continuously on the mov between the HQs at Shillong, from where all activities were coord, the AMA at Gauhati, the CMA/DMAs, and also from May onwards once the lgs build up was up and running, to the three trg camps. In May I was also given the responsibility of making the WET and the load tables for the Tac HQs of HQs 101 Comn Z Area as they had never set up a Tac HQs before, nor had they ever moved and they were to ex comd and cont over the tps placed under comd as indicated earlier for the offensive into Bangladesh. The Main HQs was to control the trg camps and the lgs sp to 4 Corps, 8 Mtn Div, Dawki ops and the 101 Comn Z Area ops towards Tangeil and Dacca and the air maint for the air drop of 2 Para Bn.\n\nLgs Build Up\n\nThe lgs build up and stocking of the CMA/DMAs involved their selection in consultation with the fmns, layout, getting the fmns to staff them, arranging the tentage and dunnage for stocking, execution of op wks for storage and offices where required, water sup, elec, working out the actual stocks to be built up in conjunc with the concerned fmns and the services as per laid down war wastage rates. We had to place the demands on the Central Army depots in the rest of India and the AMA at Gauhati for the required stocks, demanding special trains for the move of these stocks to the rail heads and thence by road to the Maint Areas. Then of course there was the matter of continuous reports and returns on the same required to be rendered to HQs EC and the Army HQs. To add to my woes the Col Adm in Nov had a heart attack and was immediately hospitalised, where he very sadly subsequently died. Consequently I was alone in the QMGs Br – I was then given an inexperienced youngster from the Ord Br to assist me in dealing with the stocking and other odd jobs.\n\nMukhti Bahini Raid on Chatak Pakistani Post\n\nIn Oct I recollect we had planned and executed one of our raids with the Mukti Bahini on the Pakistani BOP at Chatak Cement Factory on the Bangladesh border. We were in coy str all dressed in lungis and lightly armed and were supported by 81 mm Mors from the Indian side. The raid was silent and conducted at about 0100 hrs and was aimed at harassing and demoralising the Pak Army coy dply there and cause max cas and destruction. The op had been planned to have two pl size fire sp gps who would infilt onto the two flanks of the post, provide the fire base and an aslt gp to simulate an attack from the rear and impose casualties and destroy the Pak tpt at the post – the mors were to open up to cover our actions. The op was a great success with each pl being actually led by IA Offrs/JCOs. Such ops were quite frequent from all our trg camps, as also under the supervision of the Gurkha Bn at Dawki and the two adhoc coys (ARC Gp led by Col Y P Singh) from the Centres from then till commencement of the war on 3 Dec 71.\n\nFinal Build Up and Launching of Offensive\n\nIn end Oct I was relieved of responsibilities related to the Mukti Bahini trg and was ordered to conc totally on the lgs build up, stocking and by early Nov to the mov of Tac HQ 101 Comn Z Area to Tura, the designated conc area. All other fmns had moved onto their respective conc areas. From that time onwards our Army awaited only for orders to commence the op and adv onto Dacca. The Pakistanis obliged by launching air strikes on Indian instns and a ground offensive in the West on 3 Dec 71. India then formally declared war on Pakistan.\n\nThe IA offensive into Bangladesh commenced the same night. 101 Comn Z Area’s op was directed on axis Tura – Bagmara – Jamalpur on the River – Tangeil – Dacca. Unfortunately shortly after the adv commenced on Jamalpur, the GOC’s jeep with Gen Gill in it, drove over a land mine – he was badly injured with his leg blown off – he was immediately evacuated – I was to have accompanied him that day but I was late. The next morning Maj Gen Nagra, GOC 2 Mtn Div was nominated to take over 101 Comn Z Area and was flown in by heptr. Jamalpur, held by two coys of Pak regulars supported by two coys of Razakars, proved a tough nut to crack, inspite of intense artillery fire, air strikes and futile attempts to overrun it. It was therefore decided to contain it with a small force supported by a Bn worth of Mukti Bahini and bypass it and continue the adv to Tangeil with all speed. The Army IWT Coy at Gauhati and ferries requisitioned from Gauhati were brought in to ferry men and material across the River and bring up stores from Gauhati.\n\nI very frankly was unfortunately not involved in acts of valour – my designated task was very clear – it was to ensure lgs sp to all fmns in the NE participating in the offensive into Bangladesh to liberate it. While doing so, I did experience repeated critical moments in the lgs sp – I remember one such incident of being rung up by all fmns – 4 Corps, 8 Mtn Div and my own fmn that, though only three to four days of the war had gone by, when we were engaging Jamalpur that they had over expended amn – they were running short on Arty and Mor amn of all calibres even though they had been stocked with 21 days of amn. It was then a herculean task getting through to HQs EC, Army HQs, 14 FAD at Narangi, and AD Panagarh and of course the rlys to get additional stocks of amn in on White Hot Priority spec trains and arrange spec amn convoys to take amn straight forward to the fmns. We however managed to get the amn to every one very speedily and just in time. The reason for the shortfall was that the war wastage rates laid down were based on the Second World War scales which saw long periods of inactivity between ops and hence lower rates/scales. We had were similar emergent requirements throughout the war.\n\nI was then sent back by the GOC to Gauhati as it was vital to supervise the lgs build up for 2 Para Bn, which after the 2 Para Bn air drop had on 11 Dec confirmed that the airfd was secure and fit for air landed sorties, was to be air landed at Tangeil Airfield immediately thereafter. I also had to pump in stores by air and by the IWT from Gauhati for my own fmn. Fortunately, seeing our having bye passed Jamalpur on the 6 Dec, the Pakis withdrew to Dacca on the night of 8/9 Dec. 101 Comn Z Area mean while adv with all possible speed to try and link up with 2 Para Bn at Tangeil – they of course had a number of minor engagements enroute and brs blown up across water courses which delayed the adv.\n\nTangeil and 2 Para Bn\n\n2 Para Bn was air dropped on schedule at Tangeil on 11 Dec 71, with total surprise resulting in the Paki Div HQs loc there, fleeing in great haste. I was very fortunate to fly into Tangeil on the first air landed sortie with amn and radio set batteries from Gauhati and supervise the build up of stores there, with the help of the local leaders and the Mukti Bahini for both the entire fmn and 2 Para Bn. The entire op was a great achievement and faultlessly executed. 2 Para Bn immediately reorg and regrouped itself with the help of the Mukti Bahini who commandeered tpt and other essentials to continue their adv on Dacca, while the Mukti Bahini took charge of Tangeil and awaited the arrival of the 101 Comn Z Area colns advancing to Tangeil on ft. 101 Comn Z Area colns managed to finally link up at Tangeil with 2 Para Bn rear elements and the Mukti Bahini on 12 Dec 71 evening, when I also met them.\n\nI was the First into Dacca – to buy Cigarettes!\n\nOn 11 Dec 71 evening, I discovered I had run out of my cigarettes – I was a chain smoker and smoked Charminar plain without filter cigarettes. I was quite desperate – particularly when I found that no cigarettes were available at Tangeil. I therefore caught hold of the local Mukti Bahini who were extremely cooperative. They gave me a lungi, a local escort of four men and a civ veh – we drove straight to Dacca by the side/country roads/lanes avoiding all Paki deply/blocks and reached the outskirts of Dacca – I managed to get my cigarettes, saw some Pakistani troops preparing defs at Dacca and returned to Tangeil by 0100 hours on 12 Dec 1971 – NO act of great valour. I therefore quite unashamedly and jokingly claim to have been the first IA Offr to enter Dacca – which I was!!!\n\nCapture of Dacca, the Pakistani Surrender and Deinduction\n\nAfter meeting the Tac HQs staff when they arr at Tangeil on 12 Dec 71 evening, I was directed to mov back and shuttle between Gauhati, Jamalpur and Tangeil to establish an FMA and build up stocks there, while the fmn rushed fwd on towards Dacca. In compliance with these orders I went back to Jamalpur/Gauhati and did so – I also contd to monitor the sit and ensure replenishment of stocks to 4 Corps, who were advancing on Dacca from the direction of Tripura; and 8 Mtn Div who were adv on Dacca after securing Sylhet.\n\nOn 16 Dec 71 Dacca surrendered to Indian forces irrespective of the US threat of intervention – 2 Para Bn from 101 Comn Z Area were the first tps to enter Dacca followed closely by the Tac HQs 101 Comn Z Area. As is so well known, Lt Gen J S Arora the Eastern Army Cdr accepted the surrender from Lt Gen Niazi heading the Pakistani forces on that date and the battle was won. My battle however continued on the lgs front, as we now had another 93000 POWs to feed, POW camps to be constr and our own tps kept sup till their de-induction from Jan 72 onwards. We also had to arng for the tptn of these POW to POW camps in India by tpt to rail hds and then by spec trains in India.\n\nI was, for my efforts, related to looking after and trg the Mukti Bahini, conduct of their ops in Echo One sect and for the lgs sp to the fmns of the North East Region that I had been looking after, that I was awarded a “Mention in Despatches”.\n\nThe Mercedes and the Austin 8\n\nIn the lighter vein, one day in Jan 72, while I was supervising matters at Jamalpur near the TCP that had been set up, I saw two loaded civ trucks approaching. One had a silver Mercedes Benz and the other an Austin 8 cars loaded on them, with an Engr JCO in the front seat of one and an NCO in the front seat of the other. I had the veh stopped by the MP – I then asked the JCO – “ Saab, koi chhota chiz le jane ke lie nahin mila kya. In reply he told me that he had been ordered by the GOC 2 Mtn Div to take both vehs back to Dinjan their HQs in Assam. I had the vehs impounded and had them sent to Shillong. Enroute at Gauhati they were spotted by Gen Sagat Singh who directed the vehs be taken to his HQs at Tezpur. At Tezpur later, the vehs were spotted by the Army Cdr who directed the vehs be taken to Calcutta! The vehs remain at HQs EC till today, are well maint and are often used by the Army Cdr and the COS (I used the Austin 8 quite often when posted as COS)!\n\nI doubt if there were many offrs in the IA who were educated/war innoculated in the lgs field as I had been. Today, I regret to say that in most cases offrs lack this edn. Also when offrs study the Bangladesh war they fail to realise that the Bangladesh war was to a large extent won because of this colossal effort on lgs sp– that is why General Maneckshaw so very sagely demanded a min of six months for the lgs build up before launching ops – it was barely adequate.\n\nAnother maj factor was the trg and emp of the Mukti Bahini, who forced the Pakistani Army to divert large amounts of resources on security and to a great degree assisted in demoralising them thereby facilitating the IA ops and their victory.\n\nWe succeeded in reaching Dacca quickly, due to our having learnt our lesson from Jamalpur and other such locs, where we initially tried to overrun them but were not very successful, due to which we took to byepassing and containing all strong opposition.\n\nThe operations by the IAF and the IN also greatly facilitated the Indian Victory – their efforts were truly an excellent and perhaps the only true example our Armed Forces have seen of joint-man-ship.\n\nFazilka\n\nFazilka is in Punjab close to the India Pakistan border and was the scene of one of the battles fought against Pakistan while the war in the East was being waged. Fazilka is important to Pakistan as Suleimanke Hdwks on the Sutlej River, is barely one km from the Fazilka border and 16 kms from Fazilka. These hdwks control the flow of water into three maj canal systems that irrigate a maj portion of Pak Punjab. It also had the only tankable br South of Ferozpur, over which offensive operations could be launched into India. Pakistan, therefore, in times of hostilities, had always sought to launch a pre-emptive op to give depth to this area. Pakistan’s 105 (I) Inf Bde was responsible for the def of Suleimanke and was tasked to improve its def posture by capturing a portion of the Pakka enclave which jutted out towards Suleimanke.\n\nThe Indian plan for def was that of a “Fortress Concept”, with Fazilka being prepared as the Fortress (main def) for 67 (I) Inf Bde and 3 ASSAM initially dply fwd at a covering posn. 3 ASSAM was to have three coys dply fwd, with the Bn HQs along with one rif coy and adhoc pl (MT, QM and so on) being dply in depth along the Sabuna Disty (a DCB linear def system) with some 18 brs on the DCB to def. The total frontage of the posn was over extended – about 16.5 kms. Another DCB, the Sabuna Drain, was loc about a half km in depth, but was initially not held. Amn held at the covering posn was only pouch amn, whereas the Fortress Fazilka was stocked with amn for 10 days’ battle. Only ltd def stores and mines were made available for the covering posn.\n\nThe Pakistanis commenced shelling 3 ASSAM posns at last lt on 3 Dec 71. An exodus of civs along with their livestock began from vills ahead of the DCB, moving towards Beriwala Br on the DCB, which was closest to the border and where tps of the adhoc pls were dply. Tps of Pak 6 FF followed on the heels of these refugees. These tps grabbed the br and est a foothold. Meanwhile the en launched attacks on the fwd posns of 3 ASSAM, which were ordered to wdr to the DCB towards morning. Unfortunately, part of B Coy was ambushed while wdr and they suffered hy cas, incl some men being captured. The Pak managed to somewhat extend their foothold, but were prevented further ingress by our rptd CAs and rft of the shoulders of the lodgement and areas in depth. The sit devp into a stalemate by 6 Dec 71 and remained so till the end of the war. The bn fought valiantly and suffered hy cas in difficult circumstances.\n\nExperiences at Fazilka\n\nConsequent to the above battle in 1971, the Bn was desperately in need of offrs. Therefore in early 72, I was posted back prematurely to 3 ASSAM at Fazilka from HQs 101 Comn Z Area, with whom I was serving during the 71 war. This was a particularly important tenure for me, as my Bn had suffered tremendously during 71. I owed it to them and to my brother in law and close friend, late Maj L Khiangte, who had been killed in action during the battle on the Sabuna Disty, while leading a valiant CA with his coy and some tks to try and evict the Pakis from their lodgement at Beriwala br.\n\nA few months after I arrived at the Bn, late Lt Col S D Dasgupta took over the Bn. He really had his hands full with the maj inquiries that had been ordered by the G of I and the Army HQs. The Bn was still dply on the Sabuna Disty and after the Simla Agreement in Jul 72, had to move fwd to re-take the areas that had been secured by the Pakis during the war. We had to clear the area of mines while ensuring security under the direct obsn of the Paki posts on the border.\n\nI was now a Maj and a coy cdr, along with Majs T K Bardhan, Martin Khongmen, Gurdip Singh and others. I heard the story of the battle first hand – an extremely painful experience. It was also a pd of digging up the remains of our dead, some of whom had been hurriedly buried on the Disty and ahead and then re-burying them at the designated site of the planned war memorial, particularly as orders had been received to improve the defs all over. This painful ex also involved receiving the nok of all our dead and completing the process with due mil honours in their presence. Sue’s family also came for the reburial and formal conduct of last rites with full mil honours for late Maj Khiangte, their son – I conducted them and looked after them to the best of my ability.\n\nUnfortunately due to loss of territory and Pakistan taking some POWs the battle was treated as a defeat by the Govt and Army HQs at that time. The Bn therefore went through traumatic times as both the Govt and Army HQ ordered formal enquiries into the same. It is only from the latter half of 1973 that we had some respite from the inquiries – every man of the Bn had been interrogated during these enquiries! An extremely sad period!\n\nIn end 1973 I was sent to attend the JC Course, again at C of C Mhow. I learnt a lot and did well on the course. I was fortunate and received an instrs grading on the course. I then reverted to the Bn, all of whom were busy prep to mov by mil spec train to Misamari near Tezpur in Assam our next scheduled loc. We settled down here and started trg for ops in the mtns which was now our op role. Unfortunately after a mere four months in Misamari the Bn was ordered to mov to Ranchi mil spec train.\n\nJC Wing C of C, Mhow\n\nImmediately on reaching the Bn I received my posting as a DS at the JC Wing, C of C, Mhow. I then decided that this was the ideal time to appear for the DSSC Entrance Exam. Everyone told me that I did not have enough time to prep – I needed to do sustained study for at least one to two years. I had only two months till the exam – I took my annual leave at Mhow and prepared and studied hard for about two months and appeared for the exam in the end of 75. By about Mar 76 the results of Exam were announced. Much to my surprise, with God’s blessings, I had come first in the Army. I along with Maj Ram Subramanyam, Engrs was selected to attend the Scientific Orientation Course at the Royal Military College of Science at Shrivenham in the United Kingdom followed by the Royal Staff College at Camberly\n\nThe Scientific Orientation Course was three months duration and a research project was to be done by each of us for gradation. My project was on “Weather Warfare” – I received a “D” on the Scientific Orientation Course at Shrivenham. We then went onto Staff College Camberly for the Staff Course for 10 months. I was graded a ‘D’ (Distinguished) and Recommended to be a member of the DS at Camberly Staff College (the sec Indian to be so recommended since Indep) and graded as the best student offr on the entire course. This was comn to me personally by the VCOAS on my return to India. – he also placed the same on record to me through a DO letter communicated through my fmn Cdr.\n\nOn my return I was given comd – ‘C’ Coy. Lt Col S D Dasgupta was still the CO of the Bn – it was great to be back home amidst old friends – Martin Khongmen, Maj T K Bardhan, Bill Phillips, Gurdip, Kalia, Moni Kauchhur, Ken Gray and others. We were all then very busy on trg. In early Dec, Lt Col Dasgupta was posted out after a long and very hectic tenure and the new CO, Lt Col B K Khullar posted in. Christmas was celebrated at Ranchi with great gusto and we all enjoyed the celebrations. In Nov 78, we managed to celebrate the raising day properly with a great event of tribal dances, followed by dinner at the offr’s mess – we had invited all the VIPs at Ranchi and from the Army and the event went off wonderfully in typical Phantom Rhino (3 Assam) style.\n\nMaintenance of Golf Courses and My Views\n\nOne evening in 78 I was called up by the CO and instr to take my coy out to the Div Golf Course at night and cut the grass there with the help of lt from petromaxes/lanterns as the Corps and Div Cdrs were coming to play golf the next day. I was most perturbed and flatly refused and told the CO that this was not our job! He told me off and warned me that not doing so would have repercussions. I stuck to my guns and refused to take the coy out for this task being illegal (as usual I was being the argumentative Bengali). The next morning I was told by the CO to dress in ceremonials and was marched up to the Bde Cdr, where I was asked why I had disobeyed the order. I told the Bde Cdr exactly what I told the CO and that the comd I had been given to cut grass at the golf course with my coy at night in this fashion was incorrect. The Bde Cdr knew I was right and I got off with being told off. I remembered this incident throughout my service and from the time I became a Bde Cdr onwards ensured that no mil manpower was ever deployed in my jurisdiction to do up golf courses for the entertainment of senior offrs – in fact I was so put off by the incident that I also totally stopped playing golf that I had just picked up!\n\nIn Jan 79, I proceeded to the C of C, Mhow to attend the SC Course, which was to prep offrs for comd of units. I did well on the course and again got an instrs grading. I returned to the unit in end Mar 79.\n\nJamdhedpur and Bhubaneswar\n\nIn Apr 79 the entire Bn was moved to Jamshedpur by rd for IS Duties related to quelling of riots. Our duties were fortunately ltd to standing bye and doing Flag Marches through Jamshedpur town. The Tata’s veh factory mgmt looked after us very well while were there and gave the entire Bn a tour around their complex. We then moved back to Ranchi.\n\nNo sooner than we got back, the Bn was mov emergently to Bhubaneswar by rd to quell a revolt by the CRPF at the Group Centre with two CRPF bns plus located there. We moved day and night and reached Bhubaneswar in two days. We mov straight into action after carrying out necessary recce of their loc – we then warned them on loudhailers of dire consequences if they did not put down their arms and surrender immediately. We had meanwhile surrounded their campus. We gave them the night to think it over – the next morning they came out with a white flag and surrendered and handed over their arms and the armoury. The CRPF big wigs had meanwhile arrived and took over the sit.\n\nThe State Govt requested us to stay on some time as standbye till they were satisfied that the sit was totally stable. They looked after us very well – our offr’s mess and offrs accn was loc at the lavish State Guest House and the men in the police barracks next door. During the period of two months there, we got our families over to Bhubaneswar and managed to take them sightseeing all over Orissa including to the famous Chilka Lake, Konarak Sun Temple, and its beaches and of course to Puri. We had then reverted to Ranchi in July 1979.\n\nMove to Malari, Joshimath\n\nIn Jul 79 the Bn received orders to move to fd to the UP/ Tibet Border Sect – mov was scheduled for Sep 79. I was detailed as the Advance Party Cdr. I alongwith the adv party moved to Joshimath and Malari under 9 (I) Mtn Bde Gp under HQs CC. We mov by train and tpt to Joshimath, which was the Bde HQs and our Rear and commenced taking over. The Bde had different units guarding the Badrinath, the Harsil, Dharchula, Lipulekh and our Bn – the Malari and Barahoti sub sects. The entire 9 (I) Inf Bde Gp sect was well known as the ‘Valley of the Gods’.\n\nArea familiarisation and taking over\n\nI then proceeded with our teams to the locs where the Bn was to be dply to take over op tasks, arms, amn, stores, eqpt and accn – the Bn HQs group was at Malari feature at about 12000 feet (Malari is a village which is at the convergence of routes from, the famous and beautiful Barahoti plain (a valley on the Himalayan ridgeline and the LAC and the source of the River Girthi Ganga – claimed by China) and the Niti Pass (an old trade route to Tibet) which was at the hd waters of the River Dhauli Ganga. We in addn had posts dominating the Girthi Ganga valley route and at Barahoti and posts covering the Dhauli Ganga valley on the Niti Pass route (locs not given for security reasons). Malari used to be our rd hd and mov ahead to our fwd posts along AT cum ft trs.\n\nRiver Girthi Ganga Valley\n\nAfter starting taking over at Malari, I went fwd with my men along with a ptl of the outgoing Bn. We moved on ft up the Girthi Ganga Valley. I recollect vividly, passing a small stone altar on the edge of the cliff next to a lone root sticking out just below our ft tr – the root looked exactly like a striking cobra. As each man walked past the altar he on his own, picked a piece of shale from the tr and placed it on the altar as an offering to God to keep them safe from the elements – irrespective of their religion, everyone felt as if they were now God’s wards and under his safekeeping.\n\nPatrolling in the Valley of the Gods – Barahoti\n\nAfter reaching Barahoti, which still had plenty of snow, we had some food and rest. We were supposed to leave the post at 2 AM, a time when the snow was still firm and mov across the Barahoti valley to the LAC, to check on Chinese trp activity. At 1 AM I found everyone up and on their knees praying silently to their own respective Gods – we were all under his care and prayed to him as his wards for his protection – it was said that if you failed to do so, you would incur God’s wrath and ill would befall you. All of us actually felt very spiritual and close to the Almighty up there and as if we were in God’s presence. No wonder it is called ‘the Valley of the Gods!’\n\nRather than go back to Malari and then come back up the Dhauli Ganga Valley to Niti Pass, I decided that my men and I would traverse the Himalayan ridge line along the LAC – travel along it to Niti pass from Barahoti (at about 14000 feet) – a treck of about 20 kms traversing the 20000 feet high mtn range. Just before we left Barahoti we saw about 50 PLA soldiers also visit the LAC on horseback. It was a difficult treck – we ran into a blizzard while crossing the range but with God’s blessing passed safely across and by last lt just about managed to reach our fwd post covering the Niti Pass in the Dhauli Ganga Valley. The next morning we moved back along the track to Timarsen, next to Niti Village and our next post. We then completed our taking over tasks there and after a day’s halt proceeded back to the outgoing Bn’s HQs at Malari. I then completed my taking over at the Bn HQs over the next few days.\n\nThere was an interesting incident I remember while at Malari. One morning I looked down from the Offr’s Mess where I was staying towards the ITBP Camp a couple of thousand feet below next to the Malari village. To my amazement I saw a large pahari black dog running ahead, closely followed by one of my boys running after it brandishing a Dah (a tribal sword and the regtl wpn) obviously planning to kill and the eat it (Black dogs are delicacy amongst some of our tribes) with the ITBP Insp brandishing a pistol and running after them – it was apparently his dog. Needless to say he could neither get back his dog nor catch my man! I thereafter had a difficult time mollifying him!\n\nPart of my op familiarisation was also to visit the other bn sectors at Harsil, Badrinath and Dharchula (including Lipulekh Pass on the border). I duly did so. I did so by rd and the entire mov took me over two weeks. I was now in a posn to do the final supervision of my adv party’s final taking over. I also had to make arngs to receive my Bn as it came in – it was now Sep 79. I oversaw the Bn’s arr and mov to all the above locs – it was good to see them again and to be able to pass on my responsibility to them. Having done so I again took charge of my Coy at Timarsen on the Dhauli Ganga – the CO had put me in charge of looking after the Dhauli Ganga axis. After some time 2nd Lt Subrata Saha was posted in as my coy offr.\n\nThe Malari tenure was extremely satisfying – it was purely professional duties in the fd. There was another very interesting incident in this great Valley of the Gods which took place in my sub sect and in front of me.\n\nI continued serving as the coy cdr at that loc in 1980, interspersed with fd firing and collective trg. I was also required to write an ex for the Bde.\n\nRaising 9 Assam\n\nIn early Jun I was informed that I had been approved for promotion as Lt Col and that I was to mov immediately and raise a new bn of the Regt – 9 Assam at Shillong. I was then dined out of the Bn with much good wishes at Malari and moved to ARC Shillong in early Jul 80. I met the Comdt, then Brig V S Bajwa, who went out of way to help us in the raising. We were also given a lot of help by the 5/8 GTC also at Happy Valley, Shillong. Our raising was to be under HQs 101 Comn Z Area my old HQs. Our raising was to commence on 1 Aug 80 and was to be completed in six months.\n\nWe were posted a wonderful group of firebrands and in some cases totally ‘mad cap’ offrs who were capable of wonders, as well as some excellent JCOs including my SM, late Honorary Capt Asuli Mao. The raising was celebrated with a flag hoisting at the QG, a Sainik Sammelan, Church and Mandir, tea and a cake cutting. The raising nucleus was 7 offrs, 7 JCOsand 54 ORs. All serving and retd offrs and JCOs of the Regt were invited to the function.\n\nAs with all new raisings, we had to start from scratch with no money or resources and were dependant on the supply of items, as per our inventory received from various deps. While the quality of men was generally good, we received a fair share of trouble makers. I am afraid that we were fairly ruthless in relation to bad hats – rather than send them back to their bns, those who we just could not bring under control, were sent home.\n\nWe concentrated on trg – initially indl and then coy/bn level, conc on the likely new op role. We also had to equip the bn and finish adm, incl docu, to set our house in order and to complete the raising in the allocated period of six months. There were no frills or red carpets. We did however have a great time and intermingled socially quite frequently.\n\nThe Bn was visited by a number of senior offrs, the COR and all CO and SM during the Biennial Conf and by GOC 101 Comn Z Area. In Dec we had our first Annual Insp by GOC 101 Comn Z Area – as part of the insp we carried out a ceremonial parade for him to inspect. He then visited our sub unit and indl trg. We were then declared ‘Fit for War and fully raised’.\n\nSome of the Offrs who were part of our raising team were Late Lt Col S B Rai (the 2IC), then Majs/Capts/ Lts A G Datar, Maj Rai Singh, Chandra Shekharan Nair, Shashi Bhushan, W A Donoghue, Jasbir Singh Bawa, Bhim Anal, Suresh Ghorpade, Mani Ram, Arun Ahuja, A K Singh, Sree Ramulu, G Nagaraj, V K Sharma, Pradip Vij, Bipin Bhalla, Arun Ahuja, Nandraj Lama, K K Raheja (Our doctor), Nirmal Singh (of the General Service and our QM). Also, Arun Harge, late U P S Jassal, Ashok Malhotra, B K Nair, Shanta Kumaran, Sudhendra Singh, Sujit Maini, Muralidhar Kutty, M R Pankaj, Omesh Madan, and Sanjeev Shenoy (all of who joined later) – with my fading memory I hope I am not missing out anyone – I could not have had a better team of offrs. I however cannot help but say that, we all built up such tremendous espirite – de – corps and camaraderie that we would all go out of our way to help each other even today.\n\nMov to Madekata and Trg\n\nBy Dec, we had recd our mov orders for Dehra Dun in early February. We therefore started plg for the mov. It was essential that we complete our fd firing and battle inoculation and some op oriented trg, prior to the mov. I had checked with the Area HQs, who advised us that we would have to mov in batches spread over a pd, as adequate tpt was not available to mov us in one go. Even though our Canteen was doing well and was generating some profit, we were woefully short of regtl funds to create property for the various institutions of the Bn. We decided to leave Shillong on foot through the Meghalaya forests immediately after New Year 1981. We would take a permit from the forest auth to cut adequate cane, bamboo and wood to be able to constr furniture for the institutes on reaching the new loc. Then, this would be loaded up into our empty tpt and moved to a preselected camp site at a place called Madekata near Rangiya, which was our entraining stn for the mov.\n\nThe bn would meanwhile continue on to the fd firing ranges which were also close to the camp site on the Bhutan border. All went according to plan. We walked, (inspite of everyone saying we were mad!) cut adequate cane, bamboo and furniture wood, went on for field firing (which was carried out with aplomb) and then moved to Madekata, an old fort with a moat around it, which was ideal for conducting attacks across a linear obstacle. The Area Cdr visited us both at the ranges and during collective trg and once again pronounced us fit for war on completion of our raising. It is then that our luck started failing us.\n\nPregnant Families\n\nFirstly, our train was delayed by no less than a month and a half. We were therefore stuck in a tented camp on the banks of the River Puthimari close to Rangiya, seemingly having a picnic! We therefore decided that we would commence full scale indl and sub unit trg. We had, before leaving Shillong, passed very clear orders that NO pregnant families were to accompany us on the journey – they were to mov direct to Dehra Dun. Unfortunately the Coy Cdrs did not enforce these orders rigidly enough. Apparently, Shillong had been a very fertile tenure! My RMO came running to me in late Jan saying that we had 35 ladies in adv stages of pregnancy with us on the banks of the Puthimari!\n\nBasically, the wives had refused to listen to their husbands, whom they had threatened and disobeyed, and had surreptitiously come in the veh colns. This is typical of our Regt! We then spent the next month and a half tearing our hair out hoping that the babies were delivered safely. We managed to deliver 21 babies on the River bank/Rangiya Fd Hosp and one prematurely on the spec train when travelling to Dehra Dun! Finally, we managed to leave Madekata and reach Dehra Dun!\n\nDehra Dun\n\nDehra Dun was an eventful tenure for the bn. We settled down quickly. We put a team into posn to adorn our lines and the Messes with bamboo gates and gazebos, make cane furniture for the institutes and sent off our wood to Saharanpur for constr of wooden furniture for the Messes, Church, Mandir, Offices and so on at a ridiculously low cost. In a couple of months, we had created almost as much infrastructure as an old bn would have. We also had ample opportunity to conduct collective trg at all levels, with particular emphasis on aslt across single and double linear obstacle systems, watermanship and fd firing. The bn did splendidly and earned a very good reputation.\n\nWe still had a few bad hats who created problems intermittently. We had a Sikh Arty unit as our neighbour and their bad hats and ours invariably caused trouble on Sat evenings after the rum was issued. The only offrs staying close to the unit lines were their CO and I – we were both sqn mates from the NDA. Therefore on Sat nis we were both always on stand to – either he would be informed of a fracas or I would and we would both then rush out to get the sit under cont; this was again quite normal in the Regt.\n\nMotivation of GCs\n\nThe IMA was next door. Thus, in consultation with their pl cdrs, we would call selected GCs (those who were doing well) over to the bn to a number of our events including tribal dances and put them through the paces of motivation, so that they would opt for the ASSAM Regt and 9 ASSAM in particular.\n\nEx the Gaon Bura’s Powers\n\nWe had a Paite Nb Sub Adjt with a young and pretty wife. We also had a handsome, very smart and well-built Rengma RP Hav. I got to know through my wife’s circles that they were having an affair and that there was criticism of this behaviour among the families because the two were from totally different tribes and the woman was married. I then called my SM Asuli and asked him to investigate immediately. The next morning he confirmed the rumours to be true. We decided to post them out in opposite directions – they were to be escorted to the train that very ni to nip the problem in the bud.\n\nAt 2 AM, I received an urgent call from the duty clerk, asking me to come to the office imdtly. On my asking why, he said, “Sahib the Nb Sub Adjt’s wife came quietly at night, opened your office, pulled out your chair, put it under the branch of the 200 year old Banyan tree overhanging your door, stood on it and put a noose around her neck. She then started screaming loudly to call the CO imdtly or she would commit suicide.”\n\nI immediately rushed to the office, sent for the Adjt and the 2IC who lived 6 km away and called for the SM and dutyJCO. I then tried my best to coax this lady to get down. By this time, all had arrived and a large part of the bn had reached the place to watch the drama being enacted. She stated that she would get down only if I listened to and accepted her demands. She said, “My husband is an old man who does not satisfy me sexually – he is useless and I do not love him. The RP Hav is a good man and I love him. Please divorce me from my husband immediately under tribal law as the Gaon Bura and send him off to the ARC alone – do not post out the RP Hav or take any action against him.”\n\nThe 2IC, SM and I contd the negotiations for about three hours. Finally, I agreed to a partial deal – I would use my tribal powers as a Gaon Bura, under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution and the relevant Act and divorce them – she and the RP Hav must imdtly go on leave together and never come back, failing which disciplinary action would be initiated. The Nb Sub Adjt was sent off to ARC, much to the consternation of then Comdt – who justifiably fired me up! Unfortunately, the girl deserted the RP Hav within a week and he came back to the unit. Disc action was then initiated. It was a very interesting incident, revealing the actual tribal powers of a CO in those days.\n\n24 Inf Div\n\nIn late 82, I received my posting with orders to proceed forthwith to Bikaner and be part of the raising team of HQs 24 Inf Div, as the GSO 1 (Ops) – that was to be expected as I had not done a staff apmt on my return from Camberly. There was no time for a proper dining out as we were in the midst of a Bn Ex – had to request my 2IC to take over. 9 Assam therefore to date owes me a Dining Out from the Offr’s Mess. Being a new raising it was almost as bad as being back to rum boxes again. We were however able to muscle in and get some accn and furniture at Bikaner for the new Div HQs.\n\nIn the ops branch I got busy opening files on all op matters and edn of my staff. We had to take over the op area, set up the ops cum sand model room and also set up the Tac HQs complete set up – my experience of creating a Tac HQs for 101 Comn Z Area and raising of 9 Assam coupled with the trg at Camberly stood me in good stead. Within a short time we were fully functional as an eff Div HQ. After completion of raising we moved out on our first test ex – acting as enemy to an offensive Corps while testing the concept of nodal point def, in the deserts of Rajasthan near Bikaner. Interestingly during the exercise we bumped into 9 Assam who formed part of the ex en and had tea and samosas together! We all did well on the ex and our GOC was complimented on the performance of the HQs.\n\nHigher Air Command (HAC) Course at Secunderabad\n\nShortly following the ex, I was again posted out to attend the HAC at Secunderabad at the IAF CAW. As I was the first Army offr to ever attend the HAC Course, I was instr to first report to MT Dte Gen and the MS Branch at AHQs for a briefing. I was also to be interviewed by the COAS which was quite unusual. When I was interviewed by all and sundry I was told that the COAS had personally selected me from the merit list of offrs for HC Courses being the first in the order of merit and that he had done so to set an example by sending the Army’s topmost offr for this Course. I was thus unable to protest or argue the decision. The course was an education and I did well – however during the Course sadly my wife Sue died.\n\nIATT Botswana, Africa\n\nStraight after the Course I was selected and posted as the CO of the IATT at Botswana, Africa with a task of trg and helping the Botswana Govt to raise a small Army – the ‘Botswana Defence Force (BDF)’. I was the sec CO of the IATT and we did well and raised the BDF which was about equivalent in size to a Bde Gp.\n\nThe people in Botswana were wonderful – in many ways similar to the tribal boys in my Assam Regt from the NE. They were strong, tough, simple, happy go lucky folk with no airs. I vividly remember during one of my visits to the Wg at Francistown, I dropped in unannounced at the COs office. It was the beginning of the month. The CO had his legs up on his table with two dozen cans of beer in front of him along with a huge plate of Millie (maize) meal and red cabbage. He had a huge roasted thigh of beef in his hand and he was eating and drinking to his heart’s content. My coming didn’t bother him – he simply waved the thigh in my face and offered me a bite! That was what my boys would have also done in those days! He would then be broke by the 7th of the month having blown all his money on wine, women and food. The society was very free but tribal in character. If you left your wife and took off with someone else, tribal laws dictated you must continue to care for both the old wife and her off springs from you and so on.\n\nMy tenure with the BDF passed speedily – they were very happy with me and got my tenure extended by six months by the Indian Govt – they even suggested I resign from the IA and that they would recruit me into the BDF as one of their hierarchy of mil advisors on a substantial salary – I declined. Notwithstanding that it was soon time to return to India in 86, after a wonderful tenure in a wonderful country. I had received my promotion cum posting order as a Col in 86 as the CO of 4 Assam at Barrackpore.\n\nPeriod with 4 Assam\n\nWhen I reached 4 Assam loc at Barrackpore in 1986, I found that only their Rear party was there – the bn had gone on collective trg to Sikkim and was to return after a week. I was however told that the CO was admitted in the hosp at Barrackpore – I could meet him if I wanted and the Bde Cdr and his staff. I met the Cdr and was advised to wait for the Bn to return as it would easily take me a week to reach them. I did so and met the Bde staff and Col Shahi, the CO of 4 Assam, who I was supposed to relieve. He was an inter Regimental transferee from the Sikh Regt and had been posted to 4 Assam as CO. I had inadvertently learnt from the JCO IC of the Rear Party that Col Shahi had been beaten up by the Bn offrs for talking against 4 Assam and the people of the NE and was disliked by all ranks intensely. That was how he had been admitted to the hosp – the Bde HQs had been told that he had been beaten by some civs and that an inquiry was in progress.\n\nMS Br\n\nI was attached formally to the Bde HQs till return of the Bn. However within two days, my posting as CO was held in abeyance by MS Br. A day before the Bn was to return I received a cancellation of the posting and a new set of orders posting me forthwith to MS Br Army HQs as Col MS 1. MS 1 was the sec of MS Br that controlled all offrs postings upto the rank of Col on Staff and ERE at various HQs of the IA. Col MS 1 was therefore considered to be one of the most coveted appts for a Col in the Army.\n\nThe marraige\n\nIn the latter half of 1987 my late wife Sue’s relative Linda I decided to get married. The sr offrs of my Regt were also pressurizing me to marry again. My boss, Brig Cardozo and his wife were also very happy with the idea. We decided on the marriage in Delhi. It was quite difficult to get married at short notice – everyone refused to marry us! We tried to get consent of the Church and get married there but they refused saying they must have minimum 30 days for the bans. We then tried the civil court – they also demanded 30 days – we had only two weeks. I therefore spoke to the three Assam Bns located close around Delhi asking for their pastor to marry us! 3 Assam consented to send the Pastor Rev (Sub) Kungliana and the SM Pasena to marry us! Mr Lalthanhawla, the former Chief Minister of Mizoram and his wife (Linda’s Aunt) kindly consented to come for the wedding, which was to be at my place at SP Marg. Maj V K Sharma agreed to be my Best Man. The wedding was on 27 Feb 88 and was attended by all my offrs and Brig Cardozo and all their wives and Col Ruata and his family. The wedding went off well, after which we had a high tea and cocktails. As everything had to be done by yours truly there were quite a number of flaps, but everything finally all worked out.\n\nARC and 5 Assam\n\nIn 88, there was a serious problem in 5 Assam between some of the offrs and the JCOs and men which necessitated an immediate change of the CO who had also developed a heart problem. The COR, Lt Gen S K Pillai, then requested me to find an experienced CO to post to 5 Assam poste haste – I requested all the COs who were about to complete their tenure/those who had completed the same to go for a sec comd to 5 Assam – knowing the problem there, they all refused. I then told Gen Pillai that I would go even though I had not completed my tenure in MS Br. My offrs and Brig Cardozo strongly advised against it but I insisted for the sake of my Regt.\n\nI then told Gen Pillai that before joining 5 Assam I needed a few months at the ARC, as I had just got married and needed to settle Linda and the kids, before rushing off to a difficult and challenging fd posting with 5 Assam at Mechuka in Arunachal. Both he and my colleagues in MS Br agreed – so off I went as the Trg Bn Cdr at the ARC for a d of three months.\n\nThe Comdt ARC was Brig Prakash Shivpuri and his wife Veena – both of them wonderful people – Brig Shivpuri was an extremely competent soldier, an excellent Comdt and a diehard Rhino as we were all called. He was from 1 Assam, comd 4 Assam and had raised and comd 7 Assam. One could not have a better choice as the Comdt. Brig Shivpuri and Lt Gen S K Pillai as the COR were a winning combination and they did the Regt proud. Late Col L C Sailo was the Dy Comdt – he was a course sr to me – we got on extremely well together. The ARC was responsible for selecting the raw material and trg these new rects for the Bns and laying down policy for the adm of the Regt in consultation with the COR and were doing a wonderful job – I had been posted as the Trg Bn Cdr responsible for the trg of the rects. Even though I was not to be at ARC for long, I did my utmost to ensure we trained them properly. We all therefore remained very busy.\n\nAfter two months at the ARC I received my posting as 5 Assam – to move in a month. I therefore applied for and got SF accn next to Lady Keane College in Shillong Cantt and shifted in there. I had my Volkswagen and moved to ARC and back the rest of my tenure on the same.\n\nAfter exactly three months at the ARC in 88, I set off after being dined out to take over 5 Assam which had just moved to Mechuka. I was required to start my journey at 5 Assam Rear at the Jorhat Airforce Stn and according mov by my car from Shillong to the 5 Assam Rear. 5 ASSAM’s Mechuka tenure is full of worthwhile lessons and hence must be related primarily on account of the degree of difficulty the Bn had to operate under. At that time the Eastern LAC/Macmohan Line was still hot following the Sumdorong Chu and Bisa Cane Bridge incidents of 1986 – 87. The Bde was responsible for the Subansiri River Valley (Tamechung Chung, Asafila and Bisa Cane Bridge), Mechuka and the Siyom River Valley, Manigong and the Tuting – Siang River Valley sectors. CO 5 ASSAM was the Grn Cdr of Mechuka sector, which incl two coys of JATs, two coys AR, one fd bty, one fd coy engrs, necessary comns, ASC, EME, AMC dets under comd, and that the grn must cover the dply of the rest of the bde should the need arise.\n\n5 ASSAM was also to maint tps in readiness to rft the other Valleys if required. All three Valleys were completely air maint and had been occupied only in 87. We were also required to visit the other two valleys and carry out op familiarisation so as to be in op readiness at all times. In addn the grn had to simultaneously constr permt def under Op Falcon for the Mechuka sector. This was a daunting task in itself. Def stores would be flown in, which would then be manpacked by the grn to the respective loc and then the def would be constr. This meant manpacking SRTs, CGI sheets, ballis, AI pkts, PBS rolls and so on uphill over distances extending upto 70 kms. All existing def were to be totally re-sited based on revised op plans. Wooden op hut type living accn and storage sheds were also to be constr at Mechuka for a Bn HQs and two coys for R & R, as well as at all op bases.\n\nI decided to take the ft route and marched up the 110 kms, with the escort the Bn sent me – the route was in fact extremely bad and at places passed through streams which were in spate.. I also stopped over with the men and slept overnight in villages enroute. Notwithstanding the difficult route we moved fast and reached Mechuka in 3 days travelling about 40 kms a day in extremely rugged hilly terrain much to everyone consternation!\n\nDply\n\nOnly the Bn Adm element and the Rear were loc at Mechuka next to the ALG, (which was under repair and extension initially when the bn arrived), and there were to be no flights for another two months. The Bn was spread out across the region with the Bn HQs and B Coy located at Tongkorla, (a feature about 10 kms North of Mechuka), C Coy at Pt 2522, (a site of a battle with the Chinese in 62), D Coy at Changkarla. The fourth Coy, while temporarily on various adm tasks was to dply to a fwd post at Yorlung (screen and about 30 kms ahead of Pt 2522), which was then held by a reinforced pl of AR. Another fwd post existed at Lamang (10 kms from the Eastern LAC/Macmohan Line at Lola Pass and 15 kms North of Yorlung), again held by a reinforced pl of AR. Both Yorlung and Lamang were the operating bases, for all the patrols that we had to keep sending up to the Eastern LAC.\n\nJCOs IC and Their tasks\n\nThe bn was posted only 5 offrs and one more was due to be posted out. In view of the prevailing sit in the Bn, the requirement was to reduce the dependency on offrs, put JCOs in charge at all possible locs and make them accountable; and feel that they had our trust. The first priority was to conduct op familiarisation, rehash and re-site defences and dply the troops accordingly – literally by yesterday.\n\nDomination of the Eastern LAC was as high a priority, as the Chinese just did not hesitate to try and intrude wherever they could. The constr of adm bases at Mechuka (the place was like a funnel channelling the extremely cold wind at high speed through our camp sites) and all op locs with civ help; a class op 5 tr from Mechuka ALG to the base of Pt 2522 and, a suspension br across the Yargyap Chu River (to sustain Tonkhorla and Changkarla, that were impossible to reach when the river was in spate – which was most of the time), were also very high priority tasks.\n\nMoreover apart from men being on leave or courses, we had no less than 100 men in 16 adm dets scattered enroute. The Bn was also required to ensure the same activity for 8 JATs and the AR, who were dply at features adjacent to Mechuka and provided protection of the Air Hd. Everyone in the Bn was hard pressed. However, within six months the Battalion had the class 5 op tr to Tongkhorla base and the suspension br ready, which eased lgs tremendously. The Bn also managed to build some covered accn for the men and our stores at all locs.\n\nSimultaneously, def re-sited and dug and the men started man packing the air dropped def stores forward to all locs. The constr would continue throughout the Bn’s tenure there. There was hence a great deal of delegation which paid off, particularly with the JCOs being given more responsibility. The offrs could thus devote much more time to planning and supervisory functions.\n\nI used to visit the coys every day travelling cross country across the hills and land up at the posts without warning to make sure all was well – I invariably clocked between 15 to 20 kms up and down hill a day in very difficult terrain. The bn’s efforts to make the JCOs more responsible and accountable were a great success and it is good to see that 5 ASSAM has continued with this practice. Thanks to all of our conjt efforts we managed to resolve problems in the Bn and remould it into the excellent fighting team that it was earlier.\n\nLRP by our YOs\n\nTwo YOs had just joined the Bn – it was Dec and bitterly cold. We decided to send both of them together on an LRP to the Eastern LAC passes along with a pl. It was a 10 day ptl as per the pgme issued by higher HQs and they left just before Christmas. On the second day, they reached the first pass and then moved on to the sec. Meanwhile, it was Christmas Day and the rest of us were at the cake cutting celebrations at the adm base.\n\nEarly that morning, they reported Chinese PLA activity at the pass and that the Chinese had not seen them dply defiladed behind one shoulder. They were advised to simply remain concealed and observe the PLA activity. When the Chinese ptl of about 50 men withdrew after a halt of about two h, these two young men – on their own initiative decided to follow them all the way upto the Chinese post, some 10 kms across theLAC! At some point they were detected. The Chinese version that was later deciphered from the PLA comns was that our boys had fired on the PLA! However, the Chinese had come up onto the Bn radio net and on their own nets and were passing orders to cut the ptl off and to block them from getting back across the LAC. The Bn imdtly ordered men fwd, to secure their line of retreat. Fortunately, there were another two strong ptls close to the area. They were finally extracted late that night. Our Christmas celebrations therefore passed, with the bn having to contend with the vagaries of our extra adventurous and exhuberant youngsters!\n\nMaking of Christmas Cake\n\nUp at Mechuka there were no bakeries or any means of getting hold of Christmas Cake – I therefore decided to take on the responsibility of baking cake for the entire Bn. We got seven empty 200 litre barrels which had been used at the ALG and half bury them in the ground with space to light a fire underneath to act as ovens. We had been stocked with our HAA rations which included lots of dry fruits’. We demanded the rind of the oranges and lemons that had gone to the Coys as part of their rations. We had plenty of Flour, Eggs, Sugar and baking powder/soda as part of our rations. I then got hold of 10 men and an offr, JCO and an NCO, nominated them as assist chefs and got down to baking some 100 kgs of Christmas cake. It was quite a sight watching all of us mixing the cake and beating the eggs in huge utensils and kneeding the dough with our feet. We had got hold of utensils from all coys poured the batter into them and then baked on Christmas Eve – we then had the CO’s own Christmas Cake to serve everyone on Christmas day.\n\nHQ Coy Cdr’s Trousers\n\nOne of offr’s was a proper ladies man. We happened to have a girl’s hostel and college in Mechuka vill which was also the Circle HQs. One fine morning while walking through the vill with the SM, to our horror we saw this offr running very fast towards the unit without his pants with about 10 to 12 men running after him with dahs and waving his pants – we later got to know that his pants had got stuck and been torn off on a window sill when he was trying to escape from a girls hostel room. We then had quite a problem cooling local tempers over the incident!\n\nNothing Heard\n\nMechuka was loc 110 kms walking distance from the Bde HQs at Along, consequently unless a heptr or fixed wing sortie was available no one would visit us. Our telephonic and radio comns to the HQs were also quite indifferent. The Bde Cdr was also only three months sr to me. Consequently sometimes when there were unpleasant issues being communicated we were in a posn to say “Nothing Heard” on tele/radio. The Bde HQs accepted this sit most of the time because of our difficult circumstance and the fact that I happened to be the senior most CO in the entire Army by the end of my tenure with 5 Assam and only three months jr to the Bde Cdr.\n\nOne day when flts were through, my nominated staff had by oversight overloaded a returning AN 32 ac – only one ton load was permitted on return from Mechuka. The IAF made an issue of it and demanded responsible be punished. I then took full responsibility for the incident because it had been done inadvertently by my offrs and men – I was later issued a written warning.\n\n165 Mtn Bde\n\nIn early 90, I was extremely lucky to be posted to 165 Mtn Bde on promotion. Our ERE was from the ASSAM Regt and from the three bns that I had served with. I was also extremely lucky to have 7 ASSAM under my comd and was able to take them under my wing. Unfortunately 7 Assam had a trouble maker as the sr coy cdr and both the CO and the 2IC had just arrived from other Regts. I hence had to keep a close watch on the Bn to prevent the CO and the 2IC from being harassed on the instigation of this offr.\n\nA few months after taking over, the entire 20 Mtn Div less our Bde moved west as there was a possibility of another war with Pak. Our Bde was left behind for the def of Bhutan. During the first two months, we were therefore busy recce and making revised plans for the def of Bhutan with one Bde only. I was also looking after the entire Binnaguri Stn.\n\nOnce we completed reviewing our Bhutan task we were instructed to move West forthwith for ops against Pak. I was ordered to mov ahead with my Recce Gp. I was told to fly to Srinagar and that the Bde would follow. When I reported to HQs 15 Corps I was told that they knew nothing of my coming and that I better check with the MO Dir at Army HQs. I immediately did so and was told to mov to Bikaner, Rajasthan. I reached there and was again told – ‘wrong place’ – I was told to mov to Pathankot/Gurdaspur – I reached there and we were finally told and got dply at Amritsar, Khasa Camp after 14 days where we finally rejoined the Div! In fact as I reached Amritsar I received the first spec train of my Bde just chugging in.\n\nWe immediately got down to op trg as we were told to be ready to lead the Div’s offensive into Pak very shortly. I had put 7 Assam in the van. We remained on a high state of readiness; however, the ops were called off six hours before the H hr. We thereafter contd to be on standby at the same loc. This ex familiarised me with the entire Amritsar – Lahore sector and the pattern of ops required to be conducted in case of an offensive into Pak in this sect.\n\nWe thereafter, became involved in the ops to sp the Punjab police in quelling the Sikh extremists. 7 ASSAM did extremely well.\n\nAfter seven months at Amritsar, the Bde mov back to Binaguri, but soon redply some elements to Nalbari (Assam) for Op Bajrang against the ULFA. It was now end 90.\n\nAfter three months of ops there, the entire Bde redply along the North Bengal Bhutan border – ostensibly in the garb of doing sub unit collective trg, in view of the Bhopali crisis in South Bhutan. We then carried out ptl of the area to prevent the Bhopalis from setting up any camps/ sanctuaries to strike at Bhutan. This op totally familiarised me with Bhutan’s Southern border and stood me in good stead later for conducting border sealing ops against IIGs op in Bhutan in 2002.\n\nMy tenure with 165 Mtn Bde had by then drawn to an end. I had learnt a lot during this tenure which incl the def of Bhutan, plg an offensive op as part of the Div into Pak, CI ops under Op Bajrang in Lower Assam, counter Bhopali and border sealing ops related to South Bhutan and finally how to comd a military stn under difficult circumstances.\n\nD & V Dte\n\nI was then posted as DDG D & V (A) at D & V Dte at Army HQs in early 92. As DDG, D & V (A) I was in charge of monitoring and processing all disc and vig case related to all offrs of in the entire Army. This tenure was extremely interesting and educative as it encompassed various legal aspects of the functioning of the IA and was something I had never done before. It involved monitoring of the state of disc amongst offrs, vigilance on their conduct in serious cases and where necessary their prosecution incl that of sr offrs of the Army.\n\nWhile DDG I remember being directed to personally investigate accusations against a Corps Cdr for extensive corruption. A C of I had been ordered in which attempts had been made to hush up the case. I carried out my investigation much to the annoyance of the Comd and Corps HQs involved and concluded that the allegations were correct – the report was then forwarded to my superior for orders – I had recommended dismissal from service under Sec 18 of the AA. The case was mov totally by hand and approved by all qrs within 48 h – he was to be dismissed immediately.\n\nI was imdtly tgt as I had come from that Comd to D & V Dte and my ACR was due. I was given a luke warm ACR by my erstwhile superiors with a view to prevent my further promotion. I was very upset and immediately appealed against the same – I was very fortunate that the system fully supported me incl all my superiors, the AG and the COAS. The ACR was quashed. I must also put on record that I was very fortunate – in most other cases it is never set aside as was done for me. Incidentally I must also pt out that I had got into trouble at all rks – maj, Lt Col, Col, Brig, Maj Gen and Lt Gen for doing something I had done as per my conscience which did not meet the approval of my superiors – I was always very fortunate till I reached the rank of Lt Gen – but more about that later. On reflection I remain very surprised as how I reached the rank of Lt Gen in spite of my outspokenness!\n\nI did also personally investigate a number of other cases but that is not the aim of this book and must be put aside for posterity. In my experience as DDG D & V (A) the max number of offrs disciplinary cases were related to white collared crimes and were in the great maj by those who had opportunity – the ASC, AOC, to a lesser degree the EME, AR and some sr offrs. One would rarely find jr offrs or offrs from the combat arms so involved primarily due to a lack of opportunity.\n\nI must also relate the case of one of my Bns – 1 Assam which had gone on a UN msn to Cambodia. They had somehow picked up a very large number of HIV Aids cases and there was a strong demand for punitive action against the Bn by the hierarchy including the Govt. The Govt had also blocked payment of allowances to the Bn which was also being agitated against by some of them. The AG was directed to go to Cambodia to investigate – he decided to take me with him to do the grnd level investigation. I did a truthful investigation and managed to get the Bn off the hook with the support of the AG. I felt very good about my actions as it would have been very unjust to blame the entire Bn just because of a few bad hats. In fact the UNs Force Cdr, Gen Sanderson (who had been my DS at Camberly and with whom I had a personal equation) and the Bde and Div Cdr were very happy with the performance of 1 Assam and had given them letters of commendation.\n\nAfter this extremely satisfying tenure I was nominated by the Army HQs to attend the NDC. I was also extremely fortunate in being awarded a Chief of Army Staff’s Commendation Card for my work as the DDG D & V (A).\n\nNDC & BGS 4 Corps\n\nAfter NDC I was posted as the BGS at HQs 4 Corps in 1995 – 96. In 4 Corps this meant dealing with all op matters pertaining to the Chinese PLA in Tibet and own troops actions in the entire Arunachal Pradesh. The BGS also monitored all CI ops in the state of Assam and Arunachal. It was a high profile job and very busy. Here also I was fortunate in that the HQs 4 Corps Camp and its Def and Emp Coy were from my Regt.\n\nWhile at HQs 4 Corps I learnt a tremendous amount about the region, the op plans and functioning, which was to stand me in extremely good stead for my next appt as GOC 2 Mtn Div. I travelled extensively and frequently all over the Corps Z alongwith the GOC who trusted me implicitly and took me into his confidence. I got to delve into CI ops in great detail incl study of the different insurgent gps and their pattern of functioning. The most important lesson I learnt was the imp of int and pin point ops particularly as we had so few boots on the ground and to avoid harrassment of the local pop – I applied all these ideas as a GOC 15 Corps later on.\n\nAs a large percentage of my Regt’s men were from Assam and Arunachal, I was able to go out of my way to look after them and to get their perspective on the CI Ops by the security forces and give a feed back on the same to the Corps and Div Cdrs – this resulted I am sure in the operations becoming more humane.\n\nGOC 2 Mtn Div\n\nI was meanwhile posted to Dinjan on promotion as GOC 2 Mtn Div. I was extremely busy at Dinjan – 2 Mtn Div was op responsible of the entire Arunachal Pradesh excluding the Tawang Sector, for ops on the Tibetan border. They were also incharge of the Tirap, Changlang and Lohit Districts of Arunachal Pradesh, the whole of Upper Assam and South Assam including Karbi Anglong and South Cachar Hills for CI ops against the ULFA, NDFB, DHD, KLNCHLF, KNA,NSCN (I & M),NSCN (K) and a few minor other insurgent groups, and had six Bdes dply for these ops. The area was vast, rugged, and hilly in most parts, heavily forested and sparsely populated – larger than the whole of J & K. I was therefore out visiting my tps and guiding ops every day.\n\nI was now comdg tps in the same areas I had looked after when I was the Mechuka Grn Cdr (Siyom, Siang, Subansiri Valleys) and in addition now, the Dibang and Lohit Valleys including the Walong and Kibittu Sects, which were the sites of great battles in 1962 against the Chinese.\n\nIt was essential I visit the tps manning the Eastern LAC fairly often and see the sit and their preparedness for myself and attend to their well being. I therefore did so either by rd or by heptr. It was essential to understand that my HQs was at Dinjan near Dibrugarh and that in no case was any of six Bn HQs and the two fwd Bde HQs looking after the Eastern LAC closer than 200 to 300 kms and involved crossing the River Brahmaputra by ferry which at times took four to five h – or by elephant if going towards Tezu – I was thus continuously on the mov every day. However by doing so I was able to monitor the sit in the Div very closely during my tenure.\n\nDuring such visits I had two mishaps and was lucky to escape alive. On the first occasion, while visiting one of our posts by hepr at a place called Tamechungchung in the Subansiri Valley (a very mountainous area), just after taking off, the heptr engine cut off at an alt of about 100 ft above the helipad – fortunately we had an excellent pilot and he managed to glide back to the helipad and crash land. The heptr was a total write off but we escaped with cuts and bruises! We then mustered tpt at the road head some distance away and walked cum drove back.\n\nOn another occasion during the monsoon I was driving in pouring rain along with my escorts early morning from Dinjan towards Jorhat in Assam. About halfway, we drove through a large patch of oil slick on the rd – some tanker must have leaked it onto the rd earlier that ni. Our entire cvy of six vehs travelling at only 60 kmph just slid off the rd due to the slick – the rd was on an embankment about 8 to 10 ft high and all six vehicles turned turtle on the adjacent fd. We were again cut and bruised but alive and kicking, though the vehs were fairly badly damaged. We then called forward some more tpt on radio and carried on with our travel plan.\n\nCI Ops\n\nOne day I was visiting a Bn at Lekhapani in Upper Assam and after my visit was having lunch with "
