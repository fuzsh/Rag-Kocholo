        "text": "So what do we know about this big-budget Hollywood production spending the entire summer in Macau? Read on to find out more.\n\nWhat is the plot of The Ballad of a Small Player?\n\nLawrence Osborne, a British author and journalist based in Bangkok, published his novel by the same name in 2014. “In Osborne’s feverish novel, the playing is done on the gambling tables of Macau by a tortured embezzler on the run,” wrote The New York Times, which included Ballad on its 100 Notable Books of 2014 list.\n\nThe protagonist is an English con man by the name of Doyle who is passing himself off as a lord – “a corrupt English lawyer who has escaped prosecution by fleeing to the East”, according to the novel’s synopsis. While in Macau, Doyle meets Dao-ming, described as “an enigmatic Chinese woman who appears to be a denizen of the casinos just like himself, and seems to offer him salvation in the form of both money and love”.\n\nThe novel has also been described as “part psychological thriller, part ghost story” and “resonant of classics by Dostoevsky and Graham Greene”.\n\nHow is Ballad different to previous films shot in Macau?\n\nIn this decade, the MCU outing Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) – which also stars Chen – was partly set in Macau. However, due to Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, all the scenes in the SAR had to be created through CGI.\n\nWill there be extras?\n\nWith a casting call flier for an unnamed “international film shoot” doing the rounds on social media recently, Macau was abuzz with speculation. When confirmation came that The Ballad of a Small Player would be shooting in the city this summer, it became clear that this was indeed the movie in question. The flier welcomes all ages and genders, and mentions that casino and hotel professionals are particularly sought after.\n\nRoles include dealers, croupiers, security personnel, waiters, bellhops and concierges. “We are also looking for various background artists like gamblers, hotel guests, pedestrians, etc,” the flier continues. Interested talents can apply by sending their details and photos to Lumière Film Production in Macau."
