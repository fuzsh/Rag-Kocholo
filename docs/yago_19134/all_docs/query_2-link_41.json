        "text": "Discover one of the best hollywood hotels\n\nThe Garland is conveniently located within driving distance of two major airports: Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and Hollywood Burbank Airport (BUR). A number of various shuttle options are available for drop-off at the hotel and can be booked through our concierge at The Store. Vehicles are also available for rental from both major airports and can also be arranged through our concierge.\n\nDon’t want to navigate the city in your own car? You can hire a chauffeur-driven sedan or SUV to take you to and from the airport or wherever you want to go. Take a look at the popular destinations serviced below. All rates below are inclusive and starting base rates.\n\nA & G Transportation Services\n\nPlease contact us directly to book your transportation service at 818.980.8000 or [email protected]\n\nLAX\n\nSedan - $156.42\n\nSUV - $226.42\n\nDisneyland\n\nSedan - $322.86\n\nSUV - $392.86\n\nDowntown (Staples Center) - 7am-Midnight\n\nSedan - $142.06\n\nSUV - $212.06\n\nView Destinations & Pricing\n\nServices listed above are for drop off starting rates only unless an advanced booking is arranged for pick-up. Pricing is subject to change.\n\nAnd that’s just a small sampling of the green initiatives at The Garland. We are continuously doing our part to make Earth a better place for generations to come.\n\nAbout our $1.75 per room per night Environmental Sustainability Fee: The Garland was built in in 1972, and although we’ve had a facelift or two since then, the world has changed a lot in terms of energy efficiency and sustainability. New mandates to the City of Los Angeles, via the energy efficiency ordinance #184674 as well as the commitment of ownership to the implementation of green initiatives, have led us to reassess the environmental impact of The Garland and begin to make significant changes. 100% of this small fee is used toward sustainability causes and updates. This fee is a small contribution to the large costs associated with updating a property of this age. Some of these projects include: a robust solar power system reducing energy consumption by 40%, smart thermostats and occupancy sensors in every room, LED lighting across property, and replacement of HVAC systems for increased efficiency."
