        "text": "Hollywood is loaded with landmark movie theaters and iconic Los Angeles attractions—we certainly understand why it tops tourists' to-do lists. While the Walk of Fame is too clogged with bootleg superheroes to exude much elegance, you can still find a bit of that old glamour in the luxurious Hollywood hotels, or save your money for other Los Angeles indulgences by staying in a more budget-friendly option. It's not just a popular neighborhood for tourists to stay—Hollywood is centrally located and it's easy to get to many other parts of Los Angeles using the subway, bus lines, or freeways that run through it. Here are the best hotels in Hollywood for every traveler's budget.\n\nRECOMMENDED: Things to do in Hollywood\n\nThis article includes affiliate links. These links have no influence on our editorial content. For more information, click here.\n\nThis 1927 landmark, a beautiful example of Spanish colonial design, once more welcomes the A-listers who frequented it during Hollywood's heyday. The hotel is at its most dramatic at the discreet Library Bar, The Spare Room (an intimate bar and bowling alley) and around the buzzing pool. Make sure to stop for a meal at the Public Kitchen and Bar and burger joint 25 Degrees.\n\nRight across from the Pantages and directly above a Metro stop, the glitzy hotel rolls out the red carpet (literally) with its rooftop pool and lounge, grand spiral staircase, Bliss spa and famous Sunday night jazz in the Living Room lounge.\n\nAdvertising\n\nLocated in Hollywood, Mama Shelter Los Angeles is a boutique hotel that's high-design without being too hard on the wallet. Along with free Wi-Fi and fun amenities, Mama Shelter has a gorgeous rooftop and tasty restaurants; walk into the lobby of the hotel and you are immediately faced with a bar on your left, a smattering of tables on your right, and entertainment all around you in the form of a fusbol table, TVs and more.\n\nThis Hollywood hotel sits about as close as you can get to the Dolby Theatre and Chinese Theatre—that's right on top of Hollywood & Highland, for better or worse. With a rooftop pool, sun terrace and an offshoot of Exhale Spa, the 20-floor tower and its fully equipped rooms exude luxury.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWe're not exaggerating when we say this hotel is literally a dream. The 10-story tower features the fourth iteration of TAO restaurant, NYC's cool pawn shop Beauty & Essex, and an 11,000-square-foot, 500-person-capacity rooftop pool and lounge with beautiful views of the Los Angeles skyline. Plus, if that wasn't enough to tempt you, Dream also has a 24-hour Gunnar Peterson-designed fitness center. It really is a dream to stay at.\n\nThis unusual property sits next door to the Magic Castle, an otherwise private clubhouse to which hotel guests gain access—which might just make it a must-book hotel. While the castle is certainly the property's most magical quality, there are other coveted amenities: apartment-style suites, goodies from Susina Bakery and attentive service.\n\nAdvertising\n\nCara Hotel is fairly new and was born in October 2020. It's a hidden gem in Los Feliz. Cara means friend in Gaelic so here, you'll get a sense of comfort and warmth. If you're planning a solo trip or holiday with your partner, this is the place for you. You'll leave feeling as relaxed as you've ever felt. Features include Harry Josh hair dryers, curated mini bar and even a restaurant and bar.\n\nThis modern spin on a roadside motel isn't in the most active area, but that's not necessarily a bad thing in Hollywood. Consider this a good option if you'll have a rental car, as it sits in between all of the Hollywood attractions and the Sunset Strip.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWithin walking distance of the Hollywood Walk of Fame, this Hollywood hotel features spacious rooms with free Wi-Fi and a flat-screen TV. Famous former guests include Marilyn Monroe and James Dean. Guests of The Hollywood Hotel can enjoy a continental breakfast each morning, and laundry facilities are located on site.The Hotel Hollywood is just one block from Hollywood Boulevard and is central to many area attractions, including Universal Studios and the famous Hollywood Sign, both within 10 minutes' drive of the hotel."
