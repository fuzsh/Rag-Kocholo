        "text": "Liam Neeson has checked into Guy Moshe’s Hotel Tehran action thriller alongside the earlier-announced lead Zachary Levi.\n\nMoshe wrote and will direct the project set for a summer 2024 production from Rocket Science, Oakhurst Entertainment, Astral Future and Dreamtime Films, which will handle global distribution at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\n“I’m thrilled to welcome Liam Neeson to Hotel Tehran. He is a true thespian and an icon in our industry. The character he plays, Larry, is complex, irreverent and inspired by real people. I know his fans around the world will relish seeing him inhabit this distinct role and I can’t wait to be there to capture it,” Moshe said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nNeeson is also set to star in the The Naked Gun reboot set for a 2025 summer release. Moshe wrote the script with Mark Bacci (Prisoner’s Daughter) and from an original idea by Bazzel Baz, a former CIA intelligence officer.\n\n“It takes an army to bring a story of this nature to life and we are fortunate to have the experience of top ex-special forces and government intelligence operatives leading the charge. We know they will help craft this film and arm the actors, including the incomparable Liam Neeson and the dynamic Zachary Levi, with the care and authenticity it deserves,” producer Wendy Sweetmoore said in her own statement.\n\nThe producer credits are shared by Matthew G. Zamias, Marina Grasic, Sweetmore and Moshe. Baz executive produces along with Harel Kodesh, Justin C. Oberman and Arbel Kodesh.\n\nMoshe directed the action thriller Bunraku, starring Josh Hartnett, LX 2048 and the drama Holly with Ron Livingston. Neeson is represented by CAA. Moshe is represented by CAA and Echo Lake."
