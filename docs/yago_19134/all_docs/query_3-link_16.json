        "text": "“Sex selection is rampant in India. Women’s survival is at stake. We have to fight for their rights.” – Param Gill, Director of Warrior Savitri.\n\nParam Gill is a rare breed of dentist slash award winning Hollywood film director who is suddenly being thrust under the international spotlight for reasons he never expected. His latest feature film, Warrior Savitri, which is slated for international release on August 25, 2016, has become a subject of heated controversy. Radical religious fundamentalists have not only been protesting the film’s release in public demonstrations throughout India, and setting fire to film posters and effigies of Param Gill himself, they’ve also been barraging him directly with a flood of ominous emails. One even threatening to publicly behead him:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Self ban your film Warrior Savitri. It shows Goddess Savitri in poor light. If this film is released, you will be beheaded in public. Jai Shri Ram.”\n\nA native of India himself, Gill explains that he had no intention of offending the religious sentiments of his homeland but rather to revive the ancient fable of Satyavan, Savitri and Yamraaj from the epic Mahabharata. The Mahabharata tells the story of goddess, Savitri, who used the sheer power of her dedication to her husband Satyavan to save him from being killed by Yama, the god of death. In Hindu mythology, Savitri symbolizes the epitome of a dutiful wife but Gill says he wrote Warrior Savitri as a modern day adaptation to portray Savitri in a more self-empowering light.\n\n“What initially prompted me to write Warrior Savitri was the 2012 gang rape of a young New Delhi paramedical student, which made international headlines,” Gill says. “I wanted to portray Savitri as a strong, self-empowered, 21st-century woman who practices martial arts to combat her enemies as a way to encourage the half billion women living in today’s India to learn to protect themselves. To take martial arts and self-defense classes rather than relying on their husbands and male family members to always be around to protect them,” he explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, radical right wing groups such as Shiv Sena don’t quite see it the same way, although they haven’t actually seen the film yet. The movie posters showing Savitri sitting “backless” in Las Vegas, and trailers showing her in revealing outfits and engaging in sexually charged scenes has already been more than enough to send protestors over the edge. With public demonstrations spreading throughout India, they’ve made it their mission to ban the film worldwide, alleging that the Western portrayal of Savitri is disgracing the ancient Indian fable.\n\nSushil Malhotra, president of the Lal Bahadur Shastri Social Forum, had even sent a letter to Ludhiana Deputy Commissioner, Ravi Bhagat, requesting permission to burn Gill’s effigy in public. Malhotra stated that the film is “obscene“ and “makes a mockery of a revered Indian goddess.” He ended the letter with “Besharam!” (the Hindu word for shameless.)\n\nThe situation has become reminiscent of the South Park incident where show creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, were issued death threats by the radical Islamic web site, Revolutionmuslim.com for portraying an image of the Prophet Mohammed wearing a bear disguise. While Cartoon Network did end up editing out the scene, the Islam convert who instigated the on-line death campaign ended up being sentenced to eleven-and-a-half years in prison.\n\nJust days before Warrior Savitri’s scheduled August 25th international debut, India’s censor board made its final decision to clear the film’s release. Despite the threats to his life, Gill says “the show must go on” and plans to release Warrior Savitri in theaters across the US, UK and India. The international production was filmed in Jodhpur, Mumbai, London, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. The film stars Niharica Raizada as Savitri, Om Puri (100 Foot Journey), Gulshan Grover (Jungle Book), Tim Mann and British model, Lucy Pinder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I really believe that if they actually sat down and watched the film, these people would realize it does the opposite of disgracing its female character,” Gill says.\n\nWatch the film’s official trailer and music videos."
