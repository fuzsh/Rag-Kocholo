        "text": "To this point, Wood had hardly distinguished himself as more than a competent director. However, he subsequently entered a new phase, one that found him possessed of a keener eye and a surer hand. The turning point was Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939), a faithful adaptation of James Hilton’s sentimental novel about a selfless teacher and schoolmaster whose generations of students love him without reservation. The drama received an Academy Award nomination for best picture, with Robert Donat’s interpretation of Charles Chipping earning him the best actor Oscar in a particularly tough field. Other Oscar nominations included Wood’s first nod for best director.\n\nGoodbye, Mr. Chips was Wood’s last credited picture for MGM, but he spent considerable time codirecting Gone with the Wind for the studio after Victor Fleming became ill. However, Wood’s work was not credited, and Fleming alone took home the Oscar for best director. Whether it was that experience that led Wood to leave MGM and go freelance is not clear, but his fortunes continued to rise.\n\nRaffles (1939), starring David Niven and Olivia de Havilland, was an entertaining version of the oft-filmed adventures of a gentleman thief. Even better was Our Town (1940), a well-handled adaptation of the Thornton Wilder play that used many from the Broadway cast, including Martha Scott, who was Oscar-nominated. The film, a classic portrayal of small-town American life, was one of the year’s best picture nominees. Rangers of Fortune (1940) was a minor western with Fred MacMurray, Albert Dekker, and Gilbert Roland. Kitty Foyle (1940), however, was a huge hit. The sentimental soap opera, which was based on Christopher Morley’s best seller, centres on a working-class girl (Ginger Rogers) who must choose between her wealthy boss and an idealistic doctor. The dramatic role made erstwhile dancer Rogers a surprise winner of the best actress Academy Award. The film also received Oscar nominations for best picture, screenplay (written by Dalton Trumbo), and director.\n\nWood’s success continued with the comedy The Devil and Miss Jones (1941). Charles Coburn starred as the wealthy owner of a department store who goes undercover in order to root out union activists but instead is befriended by a clerk (played by Jean Arthur) and develops sympathy for his mistreated employees. Kings Row (1942), a sanitized adaptation of Henry Bellamann’s sensational best seller, was probably Wood’s finest work, a sprawling saga of a Midwestern town’s dark hidden life in the early 1900s. The cast included Ann Sheridan, Ronald Reagan, Claude Rains, Betty Field, and Coburn. Some of the book’s more controversial aspects, including incest and homosexuality, had to be toned down to meet the Production Code standards. The drama received an Academy Award nomination for best picture, and Wood earned his third best director nod in four years. At the Academy Awards ceremony, Wood’s loyalties were divided, however, because his other film from 1942, The Pride of the Yankees, was also a best-picture nominee. The biopic about New York Yankees great Lou Gehrig is considered a classic among baseball films, and Gary Cooper (in the title role) and costar Teresa Wright (as Gehrig’s wife) also received Oscar nods.\n\nIn 1943 Woods replaced DeMille, his mentor, on For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), which became arguably his highest-profile project. The adventure film was based on the Ernest Hemingway novel and is considered one of the best adaptations of the writer’s works. It was an enormous box-office success and received nine Academy Award nominations, with stars Cooper, Ingrid Bergman, Akim Tamiroff, and Katina Paxinou (who won) all receiving nods. Wood reunited with Cooper and Wright on Casanova Brown (1944), a modest comedy about ex-spouses whose baby becomes a point of contention. Bergman and Cooper worked again with Wood on Saratoga Trunk (1945), an adaptation of the Edna Ferber novel about a half-Creole woman in New Orleans who, seeking revenge against her father’s snobbish family, creates a scandal when she begins dating a gambler. Although criticized for being overly melodramatic, the film was popular with moviegoers.\n\nLater films\n\nWood turned to lighter fare with Guest Wife (1945), a romantic comedy starring Claudette Colbert and Don Ameche. Heartbeat (1946) was a failed remake of a French comedy (Battements de coeur [1940; Beating Heart]) about a pickpocket (Rogers) and a diplomat (Jean-Pierre Aumont) who fall in love. Wood fared better with Ivy (1947), in which Joan Fontaine was cast against type as a murderer.\n\nWood then returned to MGM to make his last three pictures. Command Decision (1948) was a solid version of a William Wister Haines play. Gable gave a notable performance as a conscience-racked flight commander who sends his men on a deadly mission, and Walter Pidgeon, John Hodiak, and Van Johnson appeared in supporting roles. The Stratton Story (1949) was a fine biopic about the baseball player Monty Stratton, who overcame the loss of one leg; James Stewart played the title role, and June Allyson was Stratton’s wife. Finally, there was Ambush (1950), an adequate western about an Indian scout (Robert Taylor) trying to rescue a woman kidnapped by Apaches. Before the film was released, Wood suffered a fatal heart attack.\n\nWood, a committed anticommunist, helped found the watchdog Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals in 1944, and he served as its first president. In 1947 he testified against many figures in Hollywood before the House Un-American Activities Committee. His will specified that his heirs (except his wife) had to sign a loyalty oath to the United States before receiving their inheritance.\n\nMichael Barson"
