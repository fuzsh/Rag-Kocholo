An anthropologist really does depend in the most profound way on the kindness of strangers, and every name noted below carries a history of some act(s) that, at a given moment, or throughout the project, made all the difference in the world. First thanks go to (chronologically) documentary ﬁlmmaker Murray Nossel, producer and studio executive James Schamus, and screenwriter John Romano, all of whom patiently gave me their time in the very earliest stages of the project, and helped me begin to deﬁne what this project could and could not be. Also in the early stages of the project, when I knew virtually no one in the industry, I relied on friends and relatives who in turn had friends and relatives in the industry, and I thank them all for the contacts and connections they gave me: Leo and Dorothy Braudy, Alice Kessler Harris and Bert Silverman, Fran Markowitz, Chuck Ortner, Karen Seeley, Elaine Showalter, and Amy Swerdlow. And again in the early stages, I plucked up my courage and cold-contacted professors in the ucla School of Theater, Film, and Television (tft). I expected condescension at best. Instead, I received a warm welcome and the beginnings of a process of ongoing support that lasted throughout the project. I want to thank Barbara Boyle, Kathleen McHugh, Bob Rosen, and Vivian Sobchack for their wonderful collegiality, and especially John Caldwell, who was extraordinarily supportive and helpful in more ways than I can count. Once I broke in and began interviewing key people in the world of\n\nindependent ﬁlm, I was blessed to encounter people of great openness and generosity. I want to single out here for thanks those who gave me multiple interviews, further contacts and access to their networks, and, last but not least, a sense of friendly and warm inclusion in their world: independent producer Albert Berger, ﬁlmmaker Rodrigo García, independent producer Ted Hope, screenwriter and independent producer Vanessa (Wanger) Hope, independent producer Lydia Dean Pilcher, and independent producer Ron Yerxa. All of these folks not only gave me rich and thoughtful interviews but became friends I felt I could return to for more kind assistance—more interviews, more contacts, more access. Next, I thank the people who speciﬁcally facilitated my access to sets. My neighbor, tv composer Jan Stevens, got me a gig as an extra on the set of Scrubs, where I performed brilliantly in the role of a patient lying in a bed. Albert Berger put me in touch with Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, directors of Little Miss Sunshine; Jonathan and Valerie in turn got me admitted to the set of Sunshine Cleaning. Rodrigo García, one of the kindest human beings on earth, and not just for this, agreed to let me observe for a week on the set of Passengers and also invited me back for a day of observation when he was shooting Mother and Child. Producer Lydia Dean Pilcher put out a call on her e-mail networks for someone to get me on a set in New York; line producer Matt Myers agreed to bring me on the set of Franc. Reyes’s The Ministers, and Franc. in turn was welcoming and good-natured about my presence. Special thanks to anthropologist Kate Hohman and ﬁlm editor Chad Beck. Chad was one of the editors of (among other things) the prizewinning ﬁlm No End in Sight, and Chad and Kate were at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007 with the ﬁlm. They warmly included me in their group, and I was able to observe the festival as a quasi-insider, which made for both richer ethnography and much more fun. And so ﬁnally the research was declared done and the writing began. This of course set in motion a whole new army of people for whose help I am also deeply grateful. For student assistance with transcriptions of interview tapes, reference checking, bibliography compiling, transportation, and many other details of project performance and management, I thank Sasha David, Sarah Evershed, Rebecca Feinberg, Hanna Garth, Kayla Noonen, Michael Strickland, and Eric Vanstrom. Here I need to especially single out Adam x ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nFish, who worked for this project for ﬁve (!) years, performing every kind of task with excellence, and also lending his incredible energy and enthusiasm and friendship to me and the project at every step of the way. Next, for reading and very helpful comments on various chapter drafts of the manuscript I thank Sam Anderson, Leo Braudy, Rebecca Feinberg, Andrew Grant, Timur Hammond, Purnima Mankekar, Kathleen McHugh, Luis Felipe Murillo, Dan Segal, and Vivian Sobchack. Major thanks to heroic friends, students, daughter, and colleagues who read and commented on the entire manuscript: Jessica Cattelino, Adam Fish, Ted Hope, Vanessa Hope, Douglas Kellner, Gwendolyn Kelly, and Elinor Ochs. Major-plus thanks to an even more heroic partner, and to several colleagues, who read the whole thing twice: Timothy D. Taylor, Elizabeth Traube, and one anonymous reader for Duke University Press. Individually and collectively, the comments from all these extremely smart, thoughtful, and knowledgeable people improved the manuscript literally beyond measure. Ken Wissoker has been an outstanding editor throughout the process, offering, as always, just the right balance of criticism and support for the project. I thank him for all that, and for his friendship above and beyond. And ﬁnally, for his sharp critical perspective, as well as his diffuse, enduring support, solidarity, and love, I thank my partner, Timothy D. Taylor.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nxi\n\nNotes for the Reader\n\nNames and Pseudonyms\n\nMost names in the book are real names. Where individuals have requested that their real names not be used, pseudonyms have been created and are marked with an asterisk. Sources and Citations\n\nRecorded and transcribed interviews are cited as ‘‘(Interview, [month] [day], [year]).’’ Quotes from transcripts of recorded interviews are verbatim, except for stylistic cleanup. The interviewee of course speaks and is quoted in the ﬁrst person. Quotes from ﬁeld notes are cited as ‘‘(Field notes, [month] [day], [year]).’’ Field notes include notes on many individual and group interviews that were not recorded. They are thus written in the third person (‘‘he told me x,’’ ‘‘she said y’’) and are not verbatim, though they are as close as possible as I could get. Published interviews and all other published materials are cited in the usual American Anthropologist format as ‘‘([author] [year]: [page]).’’ Quotes from ﬁlms are verbatim.\n\nWhat is happening to the world lies, at the moment, just outside the realm of common understanding. The only revenge is to work, to make cinema that illuminates this common understanding, that destabilizes the dull competence of most of what is produced, that infuses life with idiosyncrasy, whimsy, brutality, and like life, that captures that rare but fabulous energy that sometimes emerges from the juxtaposition of tragic and comic.

FILMMAKER JOHN WATERS (IN TIMBERG 2004: 5)\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn January 2007 I attended the Sundance Film Festival, the premier American festival for independent ﬁlm, as part of the research for this project. Park City, Utah, where the festival is held, is a ski resort, cold, snowy, and beautiful in January. The main street of the town is located at 7,000 feet above sea level, with snow-covered slopes all around rising to 10,000 feet, all of it bringing back memories of my earlier high-altitude ﬁeldwork in Nepal. I had registered for the festival and sought housing relatively late in the game, so I stayed in a condo on the far edge of town, at the outer limits of the shuttle service. This turned out to have its ethnographic beneﬁts, as people on the shuttle were very friendly and chatty and I could have conversations with all sorts of people with various connections to the world of independent ﬁlm. Indeed, the friendliness among festival-goers was noteworthy throughout, and as one stood in line after line in the cold and snow, with everyone bundled up in coats and hats and boots, one could always turn to one’s neighbor and say, ‘‘So! What have you seen so far?’’ and everyone was happy to engage in these conversations. By luck I had a personal connection to a speciﬁc ﬁlm in the competition, Charles Ferguson’s documentary about the 2003 American invasion of Iraq, No End in Sight.∞ Ferguson and key members of the production group, together with friends and relatives, were at the festival in a kind of dispersed network, occupying hotel rooms and sharing sublet houses around town. I viewed the ﬁlm with some members of the group, was introduced to\n\nFerguson, and became an informal member of the party, which also included editor Chad Beck, cinematographer Antonio Rossi, and others. The awards are always announced on the ﬁnal night of the festival, and there is an enormous gala party for everyone who either is part of the festival or (like me) had bought the right level of pass. We learned just before the party that No End in Sight had won the Special Jury Prize. Simply being accepted into the competition at Sundance is itself enormously prestigious; actually, winning a prize there is a mark of the utmost distinction in the world of independent ﬁlm. Needless to say, there was a lot of happy celebrating in the group; even the anthropologist got to share in the collective effervescence. I begin with this vignette because it captures and forecasts several of the main themes of this book. First and foremost, this project combines both ethnographic research on the world of independent ﬁlm (including things like ﬁlm festivals) and a study of many of the ﬁlms themselves (including an extended examination of No End in Sight). Most anthropologists who work on the ethnography/ﬁlm nexus emphasize the ethnographic side; a few emphasize the ﬁlm side; I had decided—possibly impossibly—to try to do both. Second, although it was sheerest luck that I had a connection to the group that made that particular ﬁlm, it was no accident that I was watching, out of the hundreds of offerings at Sundance, a political documentary. I had begun to view independent ﬁlm as a culturally and politically critical art form, and I had made a decision even before going to the festival to focus on documentaries in general and political documentaries in particular. And ﬁnally, Sundance itself is a phenomenon that encapsulates, for better and for worse, the tension between art and commerce that animates all creative work in capitalist society. But this tension is perhaps felt in unique and exquisitely self-conscious ways in an artistic world that thinks of itself as ‘‘independent.’’ All of these themes will of course be explored at much greater length in the course of this book. My original intention for this project was not to study independent ﬁlm, but rather to do a re-study of ‘‘Hollywood,’’ sixty-plus years after Hortense Powdermaker’s pioneering work (Powdermaker 1950). My interest was in Hollywood as still one of the most powerful sites for the production of hegemonic (what the folk would call ‘‘mainstream’’) American culture, and for the seduction of American and global audiences into the values of that culture. As it turned out, I found it almost impossible to get 2 INTRODUCTION\n\naccess to the Hollywood studios, but in the course of trying, I more or less stumbled into the world of independent ﬁlm. At ﬁrst I was intrigued; soon I was hooked. This scene, which had begun emerging strongly in the 1980s, was producing ﬁlms like I had never seen before, and seemed urgently to be trying to say something, and be something, new. I came to feel that, for all the many and large changes in Hollywood in the past decades, it was after all still in the same business of making ‘‘entertainment’’ (and money). The only genuinely new thing on the scene seemed to be this quirky little world of ﬁlm people, styling itself as the anti-Hollywood, making ﬁlms that violated one’s Hollywood-adapted expectations and that forced one to think. Or rather, what was new was that these people and these ﬁlms had emerged from the art houses and had begun to achieve both critical and commercial success, playing at a theater near you. This is thus a book about the relationship between independent ﬁlm, ‘‘Hollywood,’’ and contemporary American society. One part of the book is ethnographic, an account of the social world in which independent ﬁlms are made and circulate. Within that world we encounter a value system in which ‘‘Hollywood’’ is seen as presenting false pictures of reality, as ‘‘telling lies,’’ while independent ﬁlm sees itself as trying to tell the truth, to represent reality ‘‘as it really is.’’ The other part of the book consists of interpretations of selected groups of ﬁlms. One of the striking features of these ﬁlms is that many of them are very dark—depressed, angry, violent, ‘‘edgy.’’ Here then I ask about the ‘‘reality’’ that these ﬁlms are representing, and how they go about representing it. I argue that they are best understood as grappling with a range of profound changes wrought in American society under the regime of neoliberal capitalism, that is, the more brutal form of capitalism that has become dominant in the United States since about the 1970s. Although some of the ﬁlms are directly critical of contemporary society, most of them use a more implicit form of ‘‘cultural critique’’ (Fischer 1995; Marcus and Fischer 1986), exposing the harsh realities of many people’s lives in this culture as a way of making audiences think about their own values and assumptions. What is an independent ﬁlm? Social theorist Pierre Bourdieu has argued that one should not even try to give a provisional deﬁnition of an artistic genre, but rather should attend to the way in which the genre is constructed, defended, and transformed within a ‘‘ﬁeld of cultural production’’ (1993). I take this point seriously and will devote much of the next INTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nchapter to examining the social ﬁeld within which ‘‘independent cinema’’ has taken shape and is continuously evolving under various social and cultural pressures. Nonetheless, it seems to me that I have to begin by providing the reader with some sense—some images, some reference points— of the object under discussion. Here then I will spend the next few pages simply establishing a few general—and hopefully not too contentious— rules of thumb for picturing what it is I am writing about in this book. The simplest place to start is to say that an independent ﬁlm is deﬁned to varying degrees and in varying ways as the antithesis of a Hollywood studio ﬁlm.≤ The contrast can be seen in a variety of relatively objective indicators. Where studio ﬁlms are very expensive, independent ﬁlms are made on relatively low budgets; where studio ﬁlms are in the business of ‘‘entertainment,’’ independent ﬁlms often set out to challenge their viewers with relatively ‘‘difﬁcult’’ subject matter and/or techniques; where Hollywood ﬁlms generally eschew taking sides on political issues, independent ﬁlms are often explicitly political and critical; where Hollywood ﬁlms are in the business of fantasy and illusion, independent ﬁlms include virtually all documentary ﬁlms, and even features are usually highly realist; and ﬁnally, where Hollywood ﬁlms classically have happy endings, independent ﬁlms rarely do.≥ Before going on, I have to say that this whole notion of a clear contrast between independent ﬁlms (indies) and Hollywood movies has been contested almost from the moment independent ﬁlms emerged from the art houses in the late 1980s. In a nutshell the argument holds that indies are best seen as one kind of Hollywood product, serving a particular consumer niche. I both agree and disagree, and I will take on this issue at some length in the next chapter. For the moment I will simply say that there is a spectrum of what counts as independent ﬁlms, with a more Hollywood-y end of the spectrum and a more radically avant-garde and experimental end. For present purposes, in order to give the reader some initial ﬁx on the objects (independent ﬁlms and ﬁlmmakers) to be discussed in the pages that follow, the above list of typical indie characteristics—low budget, challenging subject matter, few happy endings, etc.—can provide some simple rules of thumb for distinguishing an independent ﬁlm from a ‘‘Hollywood’’ or ‘‘studio’’ ﬁlm. As a further aid to picturing the ‘‘indie’’ object, let me provide some examples. Selecting such examples is by no means a cut-and-dried ex4 INTRODUCTION\n\nercise. At ﬁrst I thought to provide some of the more well-known examples, ﬁlms that crossed over and received wide circulation, such as Little Miss Sunshine (Dayton and Faris 2008). But then for various reasons, including precisely its wide success (and its happy ending), it might not seem very ‘‘indie’’ to readers. Actually it was an independent ﬁlm in the sense discussed here, although toward the Hollywood end of the spectrum. On the other hand, I could provide the names of many indies the reader probably has never heard of, but that would defeat the purpose of providing some visualizable examples. After some thought, I devised the strategy of providing lists of winners of the two leading American independent ﬁlm competitions, the Sundance Film Festival and the Independent Spirit Awards. The strategy has the beneﬁt of objectivity, rather than being a compilation of my subjective choices. It also underlines the role of festivals/competitions in deﬁning what counts not only as an independent ﬁlm but as a good independent ﬁlm. Finally, the two festivals/competitions give some idea of the range of variation within the independent ﬁlm world. The Independent Spirit Awards, based in Los Angeles, are much closer to the Hollywood end of the spectrum. At the other extreme are some of the smaller and more artistically radical festivals like Slamdance. Occupying the broad middle and in a sense the high ground of the independent ﬁlm festival world is Sundance, which remains the gold standard—at least in the United States —of independent ﬁlm. Table 1 lists the winners of the Grand Jury Prize (Dramatic) of Sundance and the ‘‘Best Feature Film’’ award of the Independent Spirit Awards for the past ten years. I’m guessing that most readers will have seen more of the Independent Spirit Award winners than the Sundance winners; most of them, being closer to the Hollywood end of the spectrum, received wider circulation, while many of the Sundance winners may never have made it to a theater. In addition to these feature (i.e., ﬁction) ﬁlms, virtually all documentaries are independent ﬁlms. With rare exceptions, Hollywood studios do not make documentaries as they are not considered commercially viable, and in any event are not seen as fulﬁlling the fundamental mandate to entertain. Even some of the more well-known documentaries of recent years—most of Michael Moore’s ﬁlms, as well as An Inconvenient Truth starring Al Gore—were originally made as independent ﬁlms, although they have now crossed over to a much wider audience.

When Hortense Powdermaker conducted her study of the Hollywood studios in the mid-twentieth century, she did not discuss the movies produced in those studios except largely to dismiss them. For me, and for this project, it was unthinkable to study the independent ﬁlm scene without immersing myself in the ﬁlms. Thus, from the beginning of the research—roughly the end of 2005—I began intensively watching ﬁlms across a spectrum ranging from super-low budget indies made entirely outside the studio system to somewhat higher budget ‘‘semi-indies’’ (Merritt 2000) made with some kind of studio involvement. Within the indie spectrum I include both features and documentaries, mostly American-made but also some foreignmade. I also occasionally checked out a Hollywood movie, either because it won an award, or because I wanted to see what Hollywood was up to within a particular genre. By the end (although there is no real end) I had watched about six hundred ﬁfty ﬁlms, the vast majority of which were somewhere on the independent spectrum. There was no systematic principle of selection. I tried to watch everything I could. I tried to watch all the ﬁlms of the people I interviewed. I tried to watch everything that won or was nominated for a major award, everything that people I talked to recommended, everything that got good reviews in my various regular newspapers and magazines.∂ I also signed up 6 INTRODUCTION\n\nfor the ucla extension course called ‘‘Sneak Preview’’ for two years, attended several festivals (to be discussed below), and attended many preview screenings hosted by various ﬁlm organizations in Los Angeles. I intentionally tried to be as open-ended and, one might say, as ‘‘ethnographic’’ as possible in my ﬁlm viewing, attempting to get a sense of what these ﬁlms in some collective sense were trying to do and be. In the beginning especially I was often stunned or shocked by the heaviness or darkness of the ﬁlms and found many of them hard to watch. Over the course of the project I became more accustomed to the ﬁlmic themes, moods, and strategies that were distinctive of independent ﬁlm. I began to recognize patterns and styles, what one might think of as mini-genres. These thematic groupings of ﬁlms, rather than individual ﬁlms, will be the focus of most of the ﬁlm interpretations in the pages that follow. In a later section I will discuss my approach to reading the ﬁlms, an approach that, I warn the reader in advance, draws mostly from interpretive anthropology and cultural studies rather than ‘‘ﬁlm studies’’ per se. Most basically, the ﬁlms are seen throughout as part of the place/time in which they were made, emerging from it, reworking it, and in the process critiquing it. Without dismissing important questions of aesthetics, style, and cinematic techniques, my primary issues for this book concern the ﬁlms’ relationships to the social, cultural, and historical world. Speciﬁcally, I will treat independent ﬁlms as part of a story of profound changes in American society and culture that began in the last quarter of the twentieth century and have been intensifying ever since. Public Culture and Cultural Critique\n\nIn the late 1980s, about the same time that independent ﬁlm was emerging as a signiﬁcant force in the cinema world, anthropologist Arjun Appadurai and historian Carol Breckenridge launched a new journal called Public Culture. Subtitled ‘‘Bulletin of the Project for Transnational Cultural Studies,’’∑ the journal addressed itself to the workings of culture in an unevenly globalizing world. Included within the category of ‘‘public culture’’ is everything we would think of as ‘‘media,’’ but also academic works, literary and artistic works, ﬁlm, nowadays everything on the Internet, and more. Appadurai and Breckenridge explain their choice of the phrase ‘‘public culture’’ in terms of the ways in which it ‘‘allow[s] us to hypothesize not a type of cultural phenomenon but a zone of cultural debate, . . . an arena INTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nwhere other types of cultural phenomena are encountering, interrogating, and contesting each other in new and unexpected ways’’ (1988: 6). With the case of India particularly in mind, they expand on the idea as follows: ‘‘The actors in the contest are a variety of producers of culture and their audiences; the materials in the contest are . . . many [different] cultural modalities . . . ; and the methods . . . involve the mass media, as well as mechanical modes of reproduction. What is at stake in the contest is . . . no less than the consciousness of the emergent Indian [or any] public’’ (Appadurai and Breckenridge 1988: 7). There are clear echoes of the work of Jürgen Habermas here, particularly his theorization of the emergence of the ‘‘public sphere’’ of political debate, in turn part of the emergence of the new bourgeois class in European history ([1962] 1994). The relationship between public culture and a changing class conﬁguration will be central to the present work as well, and I will return to that in the next section. Equally important in Appadurai and Breckenridge’s formulation, however, is the idea of public culture as a partially organized space or zone in which a variety of cultural forms operate in various relationships with one another. As Appadurai and Breckenridge say, this is a zone of constant contestation, but that does not mean that a particular historical ordering of forms is easily rearranged. Rather, there are powerful hegemonies in place, in which certain cultural formations dominate and which are aligned with the dominant culture/ideology of the society. But as Raymond Williams (1977) has classically argued, no hegemony remains uncontested, and there are both old (‘‘residual’’) and new (‘‘emergent’’) cultural forces that challenge the existing (‘‘dominant’’) arrangement. This then is precisely the story of ‘‘Hollywood movies’’ and independent ﬁlm. ‘‘Hollywood movies’’ are indeed hegemonic within American public culture, having borne the messages of dominant American culture, and having powerfully shaped American consciousness in line with dominant ideologies, over the course of the past hundred or so years. Of course, this is something of a caricature, since Hollywood movies themselves could be read as a zone of contestation, both across time (see especially Biskind 1998; Sklar 1975) and at any given moment (see, e.g., Caton 1999; Kellner 2010; Pfeil [1985] 1990). Nonetheless, there is little question that Hollywood dominates the huge space of ‘‘entertainment’’ within the public culture, and all other kinds of ﬁlms and ﬁlmmaking must position themselves in relation to it. 8 INTRODUCTION\n\nThere are different kinds of positioning vis-à-vis a hegemonic formation. There is a long tradition of ‘‘experimental’’ and very un-Hollywood ﬁlmmaking in America, but those ﬁlms were shown in extremely small and marginal locations, the so-called art houses to be found in only a few major American cities. One could say that the earlier experimental ﬁlm movements were not so much challenging the hegemony as virtually withdrawing from the public sphere. What is different about the independent ﬁlm story since the 1980s is that these ﬁlms were successfully moved out of the art houses and into more mainstream theaters, playing for more mainstream audiences. The story of how this happened, which involved a kind of cross-fertilization of Sundance Film Festival aesthetics and Harvey Weinstein/Miramax marketing genius, is very well told in Peter Biskind’s Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance, and the Rise of Independent Film (2004). It would be too much to say that independent ﬁlm poses a serious challenge to Hollywood movies, in the sense of suggesting that independent ﬁlms might, for example, become greater money-makers than the blockbusters and rom-coms (romantic comedies) that ﬁll up the box ofﬁce charts in Variety magazine. But I would argue—and independent ﬁlm people would argue—that, unlike the old ‘‘experimental’’ ﬁlms, independent ﬁlms today have clearly made themselves felt as viable alternatives to the standard Hollywood movie. Indies are attracting both talented ﬁlmmakers and sizable, committed audiences, and a case could be made that, collectively, they are at least destabilizing, if not overturning, the Hollywood hegemony. Of course, this does not take place in some magic space cut off from the rest of society; it takes place within the space of ‘‘public culture,’’ in turn deeply tied to the real practices of producers and ﬁlmmakers, and deeply tied to the kinds of class, gender, and generational changes that will be the stuff of this book. But if Hollywood is hegemonic and independent ﬁlms are (self-deﬁned as) counter-hegemonic, then they call for different kinds of interpretive perspectives. For Hollywood movies the job is to, using the term loosely, deconstruct them, to take them apart in terms of their coded ideological messages, their forms of subjectivation of viewers, their false pictures of the real world. There is a strong tradition of this kind of work across anthropology (e.g., Abu-Lughod 2005; Mankekar 1999; Traube 1992a), feminist studies (e.g., de Lauretis 1984; Modleski 1988; Mulvey [1975] INTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\n2004), and cultural studies (e.g., Biskind 1983; Kellner 2010; Pfeil [1985] 1990, 1995; Ryan and Kellner 1988; Shohat and Stam 1994). Independent ﬁlms, on the other hand, form a kind of ‘‘counter-cinema’’ (Steven 1985). They are in the business of ‘‘cultural critique,’’ going up against the dominant culture by way of being ‘‘not Hollywood.’’ At one level, of course, they are themselves full of unexamined elements of the dominant ideology, and of various political and cultural contradictions, just like Hollywood movies. How could they not be? They are part of American culture too. But insofar as one is sympathetic with what they are trying to do, it does not make sense to deconstruct and demystify them as if they were Hollywood movies. Rather, the effort must be to ﬁgure out how and in what ways they are constructing themselves as critiques of, and alternatives to, Hollywood and the dominant cultural order. As I will discuss at length in the next chapter, the independent ﬁlm world thinks of itself as ‘‘telling the truth,’’ as against the ‘‘lies’’ and falseness of Hollywood movies. It also thinks of itself as showing ‘‘reality,’’ as opposed to the fakeness and unreality of Hollywood movies. In the pages that follow, then, I look at the ﬁlms in terms of how they go about this work of telling truths and showing realities that Hollywood movies do not tell and show. Much of this has to do with the kinds of stories independent ﬁlmmakers choose to tell, stories that for the most part Hollywood simply would not touch. The stories are often too violent, too sexually perverse, too depressing, too morally ambiguous, or perhaps simply too weird for Hollywood screens. While looking at stories constitutes a small and marginal part of certain kinds of ﬁlm studies, it is absolutely central to this kind of work. It is not irrelevant that independent ﬁlmmakers themselves often talk about their ﬁlms in terms of stories they felt they urgently wanted to tell. How then to make sense of the relative success of this movement, and of the kinds of relatively uncommercial ﬁlms they make? There are several levels on which this question can be answered. The ﬁrst derives from the so-called culture- (or cultural-, or creative-) industries perspective. This important line of thinking begins with the work of Horkheimer and Adorno in 1944 and is developed further in the 1980s and 1990s by Raymond Williams (1981), Bernard Miège (1989), Pierre Bourdieu (1993), and Richard Ohmann (1996). The 2000s saw a veritable explosion of work in this area, including work by Richard Caves (2000), Toby Miller et al. 10 INTRODUCTION\n\n(2001), John Hartley 2005, Edward Jay Epstein (2006), David Hesmondhalgh (2007), and Scott Lash and Celia Lury (2007). Within a cultural industries perspective, new developments within any sector of the culture industries—like the ﬂourishing of the independent ﬁlm scene in the 1990s —need to be understood in the ﬁrst instance in relation to changes in the political economy and strategic culture of the larger industry. In particular, cultural industry scholars have argued that big media corporations have increasingly pursued a strategy of diversiﬁcation of offerings, including offerings for both ‘‘mass’’ and ‘‘niche’’ audiences, under a single corporate umbrella (see especially Curtin 1996). Although I have not seen any discussion speciﬁcally of independent ﬁlm from this point of view, it is clear that indies would be one kind of niche-oriented product, directed toward an upscale, highly educated audience. The cultural industries perspective is thus very important for our story, as it will go a long way toward accounting for the opening or expansion of studio ‘‘specialty divisions’’ in the 1980s and 1990s, designed to ﬁnance and market low-budget ‘‘edgy’’ ﬁlms that were in many ways the antithesis of movies being produced elsewhere in the same studio. But this book is primarily concerned with understanding the emergence and ﬂourishing of the indie scene at a different level of discussion, namely, at the level of changes in American society and American culture. If, from the point of view of the studios, indies served a particular niche, this book argues that the niche itself needs to be explored and understood as an emergent product of its times. The landscape of American society and culture has changed dramatically over the past several decades, opening up (or closing down) signiﬁcant social spaces and cultural imaginaries. In particular, there have been massive shifts in the class structure at every level, and these will be central to our story. Without in any way losing sight of the inescapable inﬂuence of the culture industries, the arguments of this book situate the independent ﬁlm scene, as a distinctive social world and a distinctive body of work, in the context of these broader social changes. Neoliberalism and Class Transformation in the United States\n\nThis book is informed throughout by an eclectic blend of different Marxist perspectives—political economy, Frankfurt school, Birmingham/British cultural studies, and a kind of Marxist-inﬂected feminism. These perspectives will be discussed in the context of their uses in various chapters. Here INTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nI begin from the basic Marxist insight that important cultural shifts are generally tied in some ways to class transformations in capitalist societies, usually to the emergence of new classes. As Raymond Williams has noted, It is true that in the structure of any actual society, and especially in its class structure, there is always a social basis for elements of the cultural process that are alternative or oppositional to the dominant elements. One kind of basis has been valuably described in the central body of Marxist theory: the formation of a new class, the coming to consciousness of a new class, and within this, in actual process, the (often uneven) emergence of elements of a new cultural formation. . . . A new class is always a source of emergent cultural practice (1977: 124). Thus, working within this Marxist framework, Jürgen Habermas explored the cultural transformations surrounding the emergence of the modern bourgeoisie in England, France, and Germany in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries ([1962] 1994), while E. P. Thompson did the same for the emergence of the modern working class in England in the same period (1966). With respect to Hollywood, the case for the connection between the early development of the movie industry and the changing American class structure—speciﬁcally the massive growth of the American working class at the turn of the twentieth century—has been powerfully made by Steven J. Ross in his Working Class Hollywood: Silent Films and the Shaping of Class in America (1998). I have not seen similar, class-related arguments made for later periods of Hollywood history; in my view they are very much worth pursuing, but beyond the scope of this book. I will, however, pursue this kind of argument with respect to the emergence of the independent ﬁlm movement in the late 1980s. Speciﬁcally, I will argue that the takeoff of independent ﬁlm at that time is best understood in relation to major changes in the American class structure that had been developing since the 1970s.∏ Of course, independent ﬁlm is only one piece of a larger set of changes in the public culture, including changes in popular music (1990s ‘‘grunge’’ is key), architecture (as Fredric Jameson 1984b has particularly emphasized), and so forth. Any of them could be looked at in terms of the issues at stake in this book. The changing class conﬁguration of American society has been well documented and widely recognized. Quite simply, since the 1970s, the rich 12 INTRODUCTION\n\nhave gotten richer, the poor have gotten poorer, and the middle class is coming apart (Krugman 2002; Shapiro and Greenstein 1999; G. Thompson 2008; Perucci and Wysong 2008). Behind this is a particular theory of the capitalist economy called ‘‘neoliberalism,’’ which appears on the surface to be economically rational and socially neutral, but which is actually highly skewed toward the upward accumulation of wealth. Although I assume that most people reading this book will know what neoliberalism is, I need to provide a quick overview of it here (the following discussion draws especially on Harvey 2005; Klein 2007). According to neoliberal economic theory, capitalism works best if there are no constraints on the free play of the market. Government regulations on corporate and ﬁnancial activity simply impede the possibilities for greater proﬁt. In the ideal capitalist economy, there would be no checks on proﬁt seeking, including not only no government regulations but also no labor ‘‘privileges’’ like seniority, tenure, or collective bargaining. In pursuit of the realization of this theory, major changes in the American economic system were initiated, starting in the 1970s. There was a decisive break with past economic policy and practices, involving two somewhat interrelated shifts. The ﬁrst was a shift from a so-called Fordist to a post-Fordist framework deﬁning the relationship between capital and labor: under Fordism there was a kind of working relationship between capital and labor, and (organized) labor did fairly well in terms of pay and job security; under post-Fordism, the working relationship is over, and labor has become dispensable, disposable, and replaceable. The second is a shift from a Keynesian theory of the relationship between the government and the economy to a post-Keynesian (‘‘neoliberal’’) theory: under Keynesianism, the government was expected to play a role in regulating the economy and in sustaining social programs for the general well-being; under post-Keynesianism/neoliberalism, the government is supposed to get out of the way. Another piece of the picture has to do with ‘‘globalization.’’ Various technological advances have allowed for the increasingly rapid circulation of people, ideas, media, money, and so forth, around the globe. Some of this has had quite positive effects (see, e.g., Appadurai 1990; Hannerz 1996; Inda and Rosaldo 2002). But with respect to the American working class, among other things, the effects have been nothing short of disastrous. American companies began outsourcing production to countries where INTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nlabor was cheaper, and the American working class more or less collapsed, both economically and politically. Factories all over America shut down; industrial workers were thrown out of work in huge numbers; America ‘‘deindustrialized’’ (see, e.g., Dudley 1994). The weakening of labor and the deregulation of the economy together had the effect of unleashing the worst possibilities of a capitalist system: the pure pursuit of proﬁt with virtually no concern for its negative social effects. And although the working class was hit ﬁrst by these policies and practices, the effects worked their way up the ladder fairly quickly. Corporations began ‘‘downsizing’’ to both increase proﬁts and remain competitive in the global marketplace, and white-collar jobs became almost as insecure as blue-collar ones (Ehrenreich 2005; Sennett 1998). Finally, all of this has reshaped the American class structure. The inhabitants of the uppermost layers have become vastly richer, while the inhabitants of the poorest layers have become poorer or, at least, poverty has become more devastating due to the removal of many social services under neoliberal (in this case, smaller government) policies. Most dramatic has been the impact on the once prosperous and growing middle class. As white-collar unemployment has risen, and as white-collar pay has been held down even for those fortunate enough to still have jobs, downward social mobility has been prevented (when it has) almost entirely through both spouses working full-time and/or multiple jobs. Actually neoliberalism alone has not created these effects. As David Harvey has emphasized, under conservative political regimes it is aided by active transfers of wealth to the rich, in the form of tax cuts, special deals, lucrative contracts, and bailouts. American society today—mitigated only slightly by the election of Barack Obama—is a picture of the cumulative effects of neoliberal economic policies and conservative political agendas that favor the wealthy, producing polarization of wealth, growing poverty, and widespread economic insecurity. Here let me zoom in more closely on the ‘‘polarization of wealth,’’ which will be central to the arguments in this book. Although the gap between rich and poor began to expand in the late 1970s (again see G. Thompson 2008), the issue of increasing inequality only began to become news starting in the late 1980s, when it began to be tracked in both academic studies and the media. Moreover, the polarization of wealth has, with minor ups and downs, been accelerating since that time. ‘‘You might think that 1987, 14 INTRODUCTION\n\nthe year Tom Wolfe published his novel, ‘Bonﬁre of the Vanities,’ and Oliver Stone released his movie ‘Wall Street,’ marked the high tide of America’s new money culture. . . . The America of [that time] was positively egalitarian compared with the country we live in today’’ (Krugman 2002: 65; see also Phillips 2002). The polarization of wealth represents a profound transformation of the class structure, including both the social organization and the culture of wealth, of the United States. After the Second World War, the New Deal and the GI Bill had the effect of creating a large and economically comfortable middle class. That class, moreover, was arguably culturally hegemonic, in the sense that its values came to be the dominant values of the nation (see Ortner 2003, drawing on a large literature about postwar America). Now, as author Douglas Coupland has recently written, ‘‘The middle class is over. It’s not coming back’’ (Coupland 2010). The rapid erosion of that formerly comfortable and in many ways powerful middle class has produced a new American class conﬁguration, an increasingly bottom-heavy two-tier structure of haves and have-nots. Washington Post columnist Harold Meyerson has written, ‘‘These are epochal shifts of epochal signiﬁcance’’ (quoted in Gusterson and Besteman 2010: 5). The End of the American Dream\n\nThe cultural shift that accompanies these economic and social changes has been captured in the phrase ‘‘the end of the American Dream,’’ that is, the end of the widely accepted belief that hard work was virtually guaranteed to bring economic success and security in America. Observers began commenting on ‘‘the end of the American Dream’’ in the early 1990s when, as noted earlier, the effects of the neoliberalization of the economy began to be felt. To take a few random examples, in 1991 an article in the Ann Arbor News proclaimed, ‘‘American Dream Fades, Changes for Middle Class’’ (Nesbitt 1991).π In 1992 Bill Clinton said in a campaign speech, ‘‘Millions of young people growing up in this country today can’t count on [the American] dream. They look around and see that their hard work may not be rewarded. Most people are working harder for less these days, as they have been for well over a decade. The American Dream is slipping away’’ (‘‘The Economy,’’ quoted in L. King 2000: 11). And in 1993, anthropologist Katherine Newman subtitled her ethnography of a suburban community in New Jersey ‘‘The Withering of the American Dream.’’ INTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\nIn the early part of the twentieth century, the ‘‘American Dream’’ was closely connected with immigrant visions of America as a ‘‘land of opportunity.’’ In contrast with other nations in which, as the story went, people were trapped in low social positions by birth (or worse, were persecuted for their lowness), in America there were no social barriers, and anyone willing to work hard enough could rise up from lowly origins. The early Hollywood moguls were themselves living embodiments of this story, and the idea became part of American public culture in part through early Hollywood movies (Gabler 1988). After the Second World War, the American Dream became more closely associated with upward class mobility within the American nation itself, as a previously quite radical working class was offered access to a middle-class lifestyle by way of better wages, affordable houses, consumer goods, and higher educations. The American Dream was always a complicated thing, both myth and— until recently, for many—reality. As myth, it was in part a highly ideological construct, a picture of upward mobility that could not in fact be realized by many, above all by African Americans. But for large parts of the white working and middle classes, as well as many immigrant minorities, it was embraced as an ideal, a ‘‘dream,’’ of upward mobility, or at least material comfort, to which people could aspire for themselves and their families. Moreover, for large numbers of people this dream corresponded to real material possibilities generated by the post–World War II boom economy of the 1950s and 1960s. Middle-class Americans began to take a relatively high level of prosperity and security for granted. With the downturn of the economy starting in the 1970s, and registering strongly by the late 1980s, people could no longer take the American Dream for granted. This sense of the dream slipping away took shape affectively as a bundle of fears, anxieties, insecurities, and, suffusing all that, anger. This is what we hear in the ethnographic literature (Newman 1993; Gusterson and Besteman 2010) and what we see and hear throughout the public culture. The central fears and insecurities are economic. People are worried about ﬁnding jobs, losing jobs, and (not) ﬁnding jobs again. People worry about jobs with respect to themselves, their parents, their partners/spouses, and their children. Surrounding the fears about jobs are the fears about larger forms of social loss—loss of home, loss of social identity, ‘‘downward mobility.’’ And alongside these economic and social fears are more amorphous anxieties: a rise in fear of class and racial 16 INTRODUCTION\n\nOthers, a rise in fear of crime and violence (despite the fact that the crime rate has been declining), and a rise of obsessions with ‘‘security’’ in relation to all that. While 9/11 was in no way the beginning of this massive shift in the cultural mood, it certainly provided an additional charge to it. For the (unionized) working class, the American Dream was crushed slightly earlier, with all the industrial plant closings in the 1980s. Anthropologists and other observers have provided a number of close-up accounts of the aftermaths of these closings. For example, anthropologist Christine Walley provides a very personal account of her father’s and her family’s experience in the wake of the closing of the Wisconsin Steel Works in southeast Chicago in 1980 (Walley 2010). In a more ethnographic vein, anthropologist Katherine Newman documented the experiences of workers following the closing of the Singer Sewing Machine plant in Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 1982 (Newman 1988). Anthropologist Kathryn Dudley studied the experiences of individual workers, as well as of the town collectively, in the wake of the Chrysler plant closing in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 1988 (Dudley 1994). And in 1989 ﬁlmmaker Michael Moore made Roger and Me, in which he revisited his hometown of Flint, Michigan, and documented the damage wrought by the closing of the General Motors plant there. From all these accounts we get powerful portraits of the devastation of individuals, families, and whole towns by the loss of jobs. Many middle-class observers at the time did not foresee the degree to which the plant closings in the 1980s and related events such as Reagan’s breaking of the air trafﬁc controller strike in 1981 (Newman 1988) were a forecast of things to come for the middle class itself. However, I will suggest later that the (representation of the) fate of the American working class will become, within the context of some independent ﬁlms, both a thing in itself and a parable for the fears of the middle class.∫ Some would argue that the working class never entirely bought into the American Dream, at least not the dream of full-blown upward mobility. For many, there was a desire for material comfort and economic security without necessarily leaving a familiar class/ethnic social world. But if the working class was ambivalent about the American Dream, this was much less true, if at all, for the middle class, for whom it was deeply part of their culture. Middle-class life was proof that the Dream had worked and was working; the nightmare was downward mobility, ‘‘fear of falling.’’ As part of her multi-group study of downward mobility in America, Katherine NewINTRODUCTION\n\n17\n\nman (1988) studied the difﬁcult experience of downward mobility suffered by the ﬁred air trafﬁc controllers in the 1980s, but at the time their experience seemed to be unusual, within what middle-class people still thought of as a stable and productive economy. Subsequently Newman studied experiences of social class in a middle-class suburb in New Jersey. Her book Declining Fortunes: The Withering of the American Dream (1993) was one of the ﬁrst anthropological works to pick up on middle-class people’s experiences within the new, neoliberalized economic environment, and we begin to hear the voices of the new culture: the anxiety, fear, frustration, and anger about working hard and yet losing ground, economically and socially. Newman never uses the term ‘‘neoliberalism,’’ which did not in fact come into common usage until about 2000 (Ortner 2011), but there is little doubt that that is what she is talking about. A note about journalist Barbara Ehrenreich, a great fellow traveler of anthropology, is in order here. Ehrenreich has been tracking social class in America since the 1980s, and her early book Fear of Falling: The Inner Life of the Middle Class (1989) looks at the ways in which fears of downward mobility have played themselves out in the American middle class since the 1950s. In subsequent books, she began to focus on the fact that the entire economic environment was changing. In Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America (2001), which was a New York Times bestseller, Ehrenreich looks at the deteriorating condition of the working class as wages go down and social services are cut. In 2005 she published Bait and Switch, which comes back to the middle class, this time confronting the impossibilities of the new job market for white-collar workers. For Bait and Switch, Ehrenreich spent several months undercover as an out-of-work middle manager trying to get a new job. She learned much about a rather desperate new infrastructure of seminars on resumé preparation, wardrobe selection, interview comportment, and so forth, designed to help such people get (new) jobs, but she never even got close to actually getting one. The subtitle again makes the point: ‘‘The (Futile) Pursuit of the American Dream.’’ There is one more piece to this picture of what we might call ‘‘post– American Dream’’ culture. In addition to this large cluster of fears and anxieties about economic security, there is simultaneously a large cluster of fears about physical security. Middle-class people were experiencing elaborate fears of violent crime at a time when the crime rate in America was 18 INTRODUCTION\n\ndramatically declining, even before the events of 9/11. In 1990, cultural journalist Mike Davis published City of Quartz, about class and race issues throughout the history of Los Angeles. In one chapter, called ‘‘Fortress LA,’’ Davis documents the degree to which Los Angeles has become a fortiﬁed and virtually militarized city, organized around the race/class fears of middle-class homeowners. In 2002, Michael Moore made Bowling for Columbine, about middle-class Americans’ rising fears of violence and the extraordinary growth of gun ownership at a time when, as he pointed out in the ﬁlm, the crime rate was going down. (The ﬁlm won Best Documentary Oscar of that year.) And in 2010, anthropologists Hugh Gusterson and Catherine Besteman published an edited collection titled The Insecure American, with articles on the exponential growth of physical security arrangements and institutions: more gated communities, more jails and prisons, more schemes for walling out immigrants. Middle-class people’s deep anxieties for their own economic futures are simultaneously transmuted into exaggerated fears of physical violence by aggressive Others. ‘‘The First Generation since the Great Depression That Will Not Do Better Than Their Parents’’\n\nIn a completely different zone of the public culture, there was a seemingly different but in fact closely related attempt to grasp the big cultural shift that appeared to be taking place. This was the zone of popular rather than academic culture, and the cultural shift was seen as a generational shift. The idea of ‘‘generations’’ as important indicators of cultural change is not for the most part taken seriously by academic analysts (but see Traube 1992a), and usually for good reason: it originates largely in marketing culture, where it represents an attempt to capture trends for marketing purposes, or to construct consumer entities (e.g., ‘‘the Pepsi generation’’) as targets for marketing campaigns. As the Pepsi example indicates, many of the attempts to articulate generational differences can be quite trivial. But at certain points in time, generational breaks take place along historically signiﬁcant fault lines, and when this is the case, a focus on that break can be very productive. In the mid-1980s, media statements began to appear announcing the arrival of a signiﬁcant new generation.Ω The new generation was initially deﬁned demographically, as the ‘‘baby busters’’ who followed the ‘‘baby boomers.’’ The baby boom, that is, the upward trend of the American INTRODUCTION\n\n19\n\nbirthrate, started right after World War II, in the mid-1940s, and ran until the mid-1960s, producing the huge baby boom generation. The birthrate ﬁrst decreased in 1965 and continued to move downward until the mid1970s, producing the smaller baby buster cohort. The boomers had ridden two decades of a strong growing economy and collectively did very well ﬁnancially. The busters were born into that same good economy, and many were born into well-off or at least comfortable middle-class families, but starting in the 1970s the economy under neoliberalism began the ‘‘long downturn’’ (Brenner 2003). By the time the ﬁrst wave of the new generation reached their twenties, the economy had begun to take the form we see today: the relentless shrinking of the job market, and especially the shrinkage of the market in good jobs—jobs with decent wages, beneﬁts, and some kind of security, and also jobs involving some kind of meaningful work. The main growth sector of this economy has been in what author Douglas Coupland called ‘‘McJobs,’’ ‘‘low-pay, low-prestige, low-dignity, low-beneﬁt, no-future job[s] in the service sector’’ (1991: 5). Coupland published a very inﬂuential novel in 1991 about three educated young people stuck in McJobs, titled Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture, and the label ‘‘Generation X’’ was quickly taken up as the label for the new generation. And where the baby busters were deﬁned strictly demographically (1965–76), the idea of Generation X was expanded to include people born between 1961 and 1981; this has become the standard time frame in the literature.∞≠ Readers may have negative associations with the idea of ‘‘Generation X.’’ For many it is one of those empty, trumped-up marketing concepts mentioned earlier. For others it may have been a useful idea at some earlier moment, but its value has long passed. I will address these and other objections in the course of the following discussion. For the moment I ask the reader to bear with me as I attempt to set out my case. The relevance of ‘‘Generation X’’ for the present study is this: the overwhelming majority of independent ﬁlmmakers were born within that 1961–81 generational time frame, give or take a few years at the transitional front end. This connection between Generation X and the independent ﬁlm movement has in fact been recognized before: in both The Cinema of Generation X (Hanson 2002) and a special issue of the ﬁlm journal Post Script (2000), authors explore various connections between this emerging 20 INTRODUCTION\n\nnew generation and (mostly) independent ﬁlm.∞∞ As we will see in chapter 2, some Gen X ﬁlmmakers self-consciously set out to make ﬁlms about the experiences of their (emerging) generation. But for the most part the connection between generational experience and what we see in ﬁlms is much more complicated; part of the point of this book will be to disentangle the various strands of that connection. The importance of Generation X is this: they are the ﬁrst generation to begin to feel the full impact of the neoliberal economy. They have been repeatedly characterized in the media as the ﬁrst generation since the Great Depression that will not do better than their parents (see, e.g., Business Week 1991, quoted in Ortner [1998] 2006c; Newman 1993: 3). It is much harder for them to get decent jobs, to keep those jobs, and to save money for the future. On the contrary, many of them are deeply in debt before they even start out in life. In addition, they are viewed, and view themselves, as having encountered extremely problematic social conditions, including a soaring divorce rate, high rates of working mothers and latchkey children, ecological disaster, the aids epidemic, and so forth (this is much condensed from a longer discussion in Ortner [1998] 2006a). As a result, they express themselves—in their writings, their music, and their ﬁlms—as angry and frustrated, damaged and depressed, or, as a defense against all that, ironically removed from, and with a dark sense of humor about, the world. Generation X will be a central category in the present work. But as noted earlier, the phrase carries a certain amount of baggage, and I need to do some deck clearing here. First, there has been some question as to whether Generation X is a real social phenomenon or some kind of marketing construct. In fact, the answer is both. This can be seen in the two kinds of literature available on the subject. On the one hand, there is a literature written by outside observers who try to deﬁne Generation X in contrast to the preceding boomer generation (e.g., Howe and Strauss 1993; for overviews see Ortner [1998] 2006c; L. King 2000); on the other hand, there is a kind of ‘‘subculture’’ literature, in which Gen Xers themselves appropriate the term and try to deﬁne who they are (e.g., Rushkoff 1994; Holtz 1995; Ulrich and Harris 2003). Self-styled Gen X ﬁlms of the early 1990s, including Slacker, Reality Bites, and others, were also part of that process of self-deﬁnition and will be discussed in chapter 2. In other words, while Gen X was INTRODUCTION\n\n21\n\ninitially a construct imposed from above, it also developed into an ‘‘authentic’’ (i.e., self-conscious, self-aware, self-productive) social and cultural entity in a complex feedback loop with the public culture that sought to deﬁne it. This is not at all to say that everyone born within the Gen X parameters identiﬁes with the category. On the contrary, although it is clearly ‘‘emic’’ for some people, that is, part of their conscious identity, for probably the vast majority of chronological Gen Xers it is not. Thus, I am using it primarily as an ‘‘etic’’ category, that is, a category that describes some social reality, whether people identify with it or not. Second, I propose that we need to think differently about the temporal parameters of Generation X. Just as the bad effects of the neoliberal economy have not ended, neither, I would argue, has Generation X. Thus, rather than treat Generation X as a ﬁnite cohort, I treat it as an open-ended and ongoing generational entity, born after the end of the baby boom and continuing into the present. There have been various attempts to label new generations after the ‘‘ofﬁcial’’ end of Generation X, but none of them have really stuck. There was an attempt to label and characterize a ‘‘Generation Y,’’ mainly related to the emergence and spread of the Internet in the 1990s; the Internet has indeed been massively important, but I would argue that it has not overridden the continuity between the ‘‘generations’’ in economic terms. There was also an attempt to demarcate something called ‘‘the Millenials’’ (possibly a variant of Generation Y), but they turn out to be the same thing, or in fact worse. Thus, in 2010 we see a story in the New York Times about the Millennials titled ‘‘American Dream Is Elusive for New Generation.’’ The writer tells us that ‘‘for young adults, the prospects in the workplace, even for the college-educated, have rarely been so bleak’’ (Uchitelle 2010). Third, I need to connect the Gen X concept with the earlier discussions of class. Although a ‘‘generation’’ would seem to include everyone born within a certain time frame, a constructed category like ‘‘Generation X’’ actually contains speciﬁc inclusions and exclusions. In fact, it refers primarily to the children of the (mostly white) middle class who had been brought up in reasonable (or more) material comfort and with solid (or better) educations, but who enter a world reordered by the neoliberal agenda. Working-class people and people of color have been hit at least as\n\n22 INTRODUCTION\n\nhard economically by neoliberalism as the children of the white middle class, but for the most part they had lower expectations to begin with. The Gen X concept, by contrast, includes the idea of a kind of generational shock for children of the middle class, who face the prospects of a loss of comfort and security that the middle class had come to take for granted. In sum, the idea of Generation X is meant to capture what we might think of as ‘‘neoliberalism on the ground,’’ speciﬁcally in its middle-class manifestations. But as I alluded to above, there is more to the idea—and the reality—of Generation X than its economic situation, as central as that may be. In fact, one of the useful things about the generational framing is that it does go beyond the narrowly economic ‘‘neoliberalism’’ story. There are actually two other large areas of life in which Generation X is seen as having, and sees itself as having, a more difﬁcult time than the preceding boomer generation. One is the whole area of intimate life, where Gen X is the ﬁrst (middle-class) generation to feel the full impact of the new conﬁgurations of the family, of a rising divorce rate and all its economic and emotional consequences, or of both parents working (more than) fulltime even when the family is intact. As part of that, but distinct, are the upheavals surrounding the new sortings of sexual identities and gender roles. The second large area in which life is more difﬁcult for Gen Xers than the preceding generation is the area of political life, including the new generation’s complex and fraught relationship to feminism and other forms of political activism that had been central to the political life of the boomers. I will take up all of these issues in the chapters that follow. The Roles of Ethnography\n\nThis is a work of anthropology. At the heart of it is an ethnographic study of the world of independent ﬁlm, including both the production and the circulation of those ﬁlms. But as is increasingly common in anthropological work today, the ethnographic elements of the book are both contextualized within and enlarged by accounts of the wider political, economic, historical, and cultural contexts (see Marcus 1998; for a recent example, see Ortner 2003). In addition, because this is a book about ﬁlms, the ethnographic discussions are linked, in various ways, to cultural interpretations of signiﬁcant ﬁlms or groups of ﬁlms. All of this is to say that ethnography today rarely stands alone and is usually part of a larger tool\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n23\n\nkit (see also Marcus 1998). At the same time, it is, for anthropology, the sine qua non of all the rest, and I want to conclude this introduction with a discussion of the speciﬁcally ethnographic dimensions of this book. Ethnographic studies of media production have recently emerged as a very dynamic ﬁeld in anthropology, sociology, and media studies. All such work involves extended ethnographic immersion in one or more sites of media production with an aim of understanding how the forms of the public culture—ﬁlm, television, music, advertising, etc.—are produced. These studies may include information on the mechanics of production, but they are primarily oriented toward understanding the culture and the politics that shape what the public is offered (or not offered) by way of news and information, advertising and marketing, and art and entertainment. Early work in ethnographically based production studies was sparse. There were, ﬁrst, the two early ethnographies of Hollywood, Leo Rosten’s 1941 Hollywood: The Movie Colony, The Movie Makers∞≤ and Hortense Powdermaker’s 1950 Hollywood the Dream Factory. Fast forward, then, to the 1980s, with sociologist Todd Gitlin’s Inside Prime Time (1983), a detailed ethnography of the politics of prime-time programming inside several television networks. Then there is another signiﬁcant gap of time. Finally, in the late 1990s we start to see a marked acceleration of this kind of work. In sociology, continuing in the tradition of Gitlin, Laura Grindstaff published a remarkable ethnography of two tv talk shows (2002). In anthropology, Faye D. Ginsburg, Lila Abu-Lughod, and Brian Larkin published the inﬂuential reader Media Worlds: Anthropology on New Terrain (2002), providing a rich range of articles on ethnographic studies of media production from all over the world (see also Askew and Wilk 2002). In those and other collections, Faye Ginsburg launched a series of very inﬂuential articles on indigenous media production (e.g., 1999, 2002). Recent anthropological monographs on cultural production would include Barry Dornfeld’s study of the politics of producing a pbs series (1998), Lila Abu-Lughod’s ethnographic work on Egyptian television production (2005), Georgina Born’s studies of the Institut de Recherche et de Coordination Acoustique/Musique (ircam) in Paris (1995) and of the bbc in London (2005), William Mazzarella’s study of advertising production in India (2003), and Brian Larkin’s study of ﬁlm production and circulation in Nigeria (2008).∞≥ In media studies, John Thornton Caldwell has launched an ethnographic movement with his multi-sited 24 INTRODUCTION\n\nwork on production practices in ﬁlm and television. His pathbreaking monograph Production Culture: Industrial Reﬂexivity and Critical Practice in Film and Television (2008) was followed in 2009 by a collection of articles coedited by Vicki Mayer, Miranda J. Banks, and himself titled Production Studies: Cultural Studies of Media Industries. Moving to the present work, I want to unpack the various uses of ethnographic methods in this book. As a minimal deﬁnition I will say that ethnography entails an attempt to understand a particular social world from the point of view of the participants in that world. This minimal deﬁnition, emphasizing an effort to hear voices that would otherwise not be heard, was particularly relevant to the study of societies or groups with relatively less social power than the anthropologist’s own, which was the case with most anthropological work until recently. In recent years anthropologists have begun to ‘‘study up’’ (Nader 1969) or ‘‘sideways’’ (Hannerz 2010b; Ortner 2010), that is, to study people/groups who are in positions of equal or greater power than the anthropologist. Even with more powerful people, however, the effort to understand their thinking, to see the world from their point of view, is fundamental to the ethnographic enterprise and must precede any critique one might also wish to make of their power and privilege. I emphasize this at the outset as many readers of this book may not be familiar with the ethnographic perspective. Ethnography is not just a bunch of ‘‘methods,’’ though I will discuss some methods in a moment. It is an open-ended set of strategies for getting at how people differently positioned than oneself, socially, culturally, and historically, see the world in their own terms. Ethnography is most commonly equated with participant observation, with the ethnographer entering physically, and in every other way possible, into the cultural spaces or life-worlds in question, and ideally spending a relatively long time there. I had initially hoped to do long-term ethnography in this sense in a movie studio or a ﬁlm production company but, despite many attempts, was unable to obtain permission (see Ortner 2010 on access issues). The participant-observation parts of this project were thus relatively limited (though intense), conﬁned mainly to several observation opportunities at ﬁlm festivals and on movie sets. At the same time, I continued to feel the need for live and relatively ‘‘natural’’ encounters, in addition to formal interviews. I thus improvised a INTRODUCTION\n\n25\n\nmethod that I called ‘‘interface ethnography.’’ The idea of interface ethnography is that, apart from truly ‘‘secret societies’’ like (say) the Freemasons, most relatively closed communities have events where they interface with the public. In the case of the independent ﬁlm world, one could join a variety of ﬁlm organizations and subscribe to a variety of screening series, whereupon one would be invited to large numbers of preview screenings of ﬁlms, with q&a afterward with the director or other people importantly connected with the ﬁlm.∞∂ Some of these organizations and groups also hold special programs for which one can buy tickets and hear panels of directors, screenwriters, and others talk about their work. One could also buy passes to ﬁlm festivals, in my case to Sundance once and the Los Angeles Film Festival twice, and attend more screenings with q&a, as well as panel discussions, poolside chats among groups of ﬁlmmakers, public interviews of individual ﬁlmmakers, and so on and so forth. The notes from more than one hundred live, close-up, often hour-long discussions between independent ﬁlmmakers, interviewers and/or other onstage participants, and audience members constitute the largest body of my data, other than the formal interviews. And then there are the interviews. Altogether I interviewed, in varying degrees of depth, and in several cases more than once, about seventy-ﬁve people in various positions within the media industry in general and independent ﬁlm in particular. But again I felt I had to improvise, partly for reasons of quantity, but also because of a problem particular to this project: that I could see all the ﬁlms of the people I interviewed, but I could not interview all the ﬁlmmakers whose ﬁlms I saw. The solution in this case came from the fact that ﬁlm people are interviewed all the time, and that one can both attend live public interviews (as at the ﬁlm festivals) and ﬁnd published interviews more or less ad inﬁnitum. This strategy more than doubled the pool of interviews on which I could draw in writing this book. The interviews (of whatever provenance) are used in two rather different ways in the discussions that follow. On the one hand, people tell stories about their own experiences, and in many cases I retain their stories intact. The stories are particularly important in chapter 3, in which I piece together many accounts to provide a kind of insiders’ oral history of the way in which the independent ﬁlm scene came together in the late 1980s and early 1990s. But the interviews, as well as all the ﬁeld notes from the q&a sessions, 26 INTRODUCTION\n\npublic interviews, and panels, are also used in a different way. Speciﬁcally, I treat them as texts to be taken apart in order to understand the language, the discourse, and the modes of self-expression of the world of independent ﬁlm. This represents another way to get ‘‘inside’’ a cultural world, through the interpretation of social and cultural texts broadly conceived, in this case texts of ordinary talk and conversation. The study of culture as the interpretation of texts is associated especially with the work of Clifford Geertz (1973a) and was later adapted and expanded for the distinctive kind of literary/cultural analysis developed by Stephen Greenblatt under the rubric of ‘‘the new historicism’’ (e.g., 1999).∞∑ Recently John Caldwell has put it to powerful use in his own version of ‘‘production studies’’ (2008). Within this Geertzian framework a text can be anything—formal textualized objects such as Shakespeare’s plays or independent ﬁlms, but also games such as Balinese cockﬁghts, rituals such as Sherpa offerings to their gods, three ﬁlmmakers talking to one another on a panel, and so on. Throughout this book I will treat the interviews and ﬁeld notes as texts in this sense and mine them for the distinctive expressions and tropes that seem to open up independent ﬁlm people’s distinctive ways of thinking about their work and their world. Looking at the book as a whole, there are ﬁlm chapters and ethnographic chapters, alternating with one another. But there are ﬁlms in some of the ethnographic chapters, namely, ﬁlms about independent ﬁlmmaking, which I treat as another kind of ethnographic text. And there is ethnography in all of the ﬁlm chapters, including both what I earlier called ‘‘stories’’ (people’s accounts of events and experiences taken substantively) and ‘‘texts’’ (people speaking in the language of independent ﬁlmmaking, where the important thing is the language). The point of it all will be to understand independent ﬁlms as stories meant to shake up and disturb audiences about the condition of American society today. We turn then to the ﬁrst chapter, where I will look closely at various discourses prevalent in the indie world, to try to understand and convey what independent ﬁlm people mean by ‘‘independence.’’ As part of that discussion, I will tackle the debate over what happens to ﬁlmmaking ‘‘independence’’ in the context of new conditions and strategies in the wider cultural industries.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n27\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nMaking Independence\n\nI will argue throughout this book that the independent ﬁlm movement that emerged in the late 1980s represented a critical cultural movement, an attempt to critique the dominant culture (represented by ‘‘Hollywood’’) through their ﬁlms. Cultural critique (Marcus and Fischer 1986, Fischer 1995) in the ﬁlms takes several forms. Some ﬁlms, mostly but not entirely to be found among documentaries, are explicitly critical of the existing cultural and political order. These ﬁlms are very important, in my view, and probably constitute my favorite genre of independent ﬁlms. But they are in the minority among independent ﬁlms, as well as the least favorite with most audiences. They will be discussed in chapter 8. More often, independent ﬁlms perform cultural critique by way of embracing a kind of harsh realism, by making ﬁlms that display the dark realities in contemporary life, and that make demands on the viewer to viscerally experience and come to grips with those realities. Most independent ﬁlmmakers would not see themselves as engaged in ‘‘cultural critique,’’ at least not in those speciﬁc terms. But they do have very strong ideas about the importance of ‘‘independence,’’ which is to say, independence from Hollywood and all that it stands for. I will approach this central issue through an examination of the discourse, the self-representations, circulating within the world of independent ﬁlmmaking. The notion of discourse has had a long and complex life in the ﬁeld of linguistics, and also plays a distinctive role in the philosophy of Michel Foucault (see especially Foucault 1986). But I use it here in the non-\n\ntechnical sense of the vocabulary of terms, tropes, and styles distinctive to a particular social universe, in this case, the universe of independent ﬁlmmaking and all its associated institutions and support structures. The discourse of independent ﬁlmmaking is always a reactive discourse, always set strongly against certain stereotypic notions of ‘‘Hollywood.’’ Producer Larry Drubner* called Hollywood blockbusters ‘‘disgusting’’ (interview, March 23, 2007), and said, ‘‘I don’t love the industry, I hate it.’’ Independent ﬁlmmaker Ramin Bahrani (e.g., Man Push Cart, Chop Shop) said that Hollywood movies ‘‘just don’t make any sense. They create massive confusion’’ (in Scott 2009: 43). Producer Ted Hope, one of the pioneers of the indie movement, talked about his early move toward independent ﬁlm production: ‘‘[I was 19, 20, but] was already [thinking], what is this junk that Hollywood is producing? . . . It was all supposed to be hip and cool, and I was just, this is such saccharine crap, and I remember just being angry at what was supposed to be groundbreaking and wasn’t’’ (interview, March 15, 2006). Not all indie ﬁlm people are literally angry about ‘‘Hollywood,’’ but all by deﬁnition are in some sense against what ‘‘Hollywood’’ is and stands for; that is the basis of the decision to work independently and to go against the grain of the standard Hollywood movie. But this negative stance toward Hollywood is set at two relatively distinct levels. The ﬁrst level might be called the level of cultures and practices: independent ﬁlmmaking sees itself as different from, and better than, Hollywood in its ethos and practices of making ﬁlms, speciﬁcally in terms of the commercial intention of ‘‘the studios’’ and the relatively noncommercial intention of independent ﬁlmmaking. The critique of Hollywood, and of commercialism in general, constitutes independent ﬁlmmaking as a form of cultural critique at the most general level, even before one looks at speciﬁc ﬁlms. The other level concerns the nature of the ﬁlms themselves in the two worlds. Here there is a critique of the stereotypic Hollywood movie as not only informed primarily by the commercial intent but also by a relatively unquestioning relationship to the dominant culture. Here then we can ﬁnd in the discourse of independent ﬁlmmaking a more articulated set of ideas about critical ﬁlmmaking: making ﬁlms that challenge the dominant culture, making ﬁlms that challenge the audience, making, in the words of\n\n30 CHAPTER 1\n\nindependent producer Christine Vachon, ‘‘ﬁlms that matter’’ (Vachon and Edelstein 1998: cover). Before getting to that discussion, I need to say a few words about the interpretation of discourse in the context of this book. I will not be doing what is called ‘‘discourse analysis’’ in linguistic anthropology, a method that entails a close examination of conversational texts, exploring the ways in which conversational styles and gambits enact and co-construct various kinds of intentions, positions, and social outcomes. Instead, I will be doing something we might call cultural ethnography through discourse, listening to the ways in which people spontaneously seem to say or write the same things in many different contexts. For example, many people in the independent ﬁlm world will say things like ‘‘I hate Hollywood,’’ or ‘‘Hollywood is crap,’’ or ‘‘You have to stay out of the studios or they will destroy your ﬁlm.’’ After the fourth or ﬁfth repetition of these sorts of statements by different people in different contexts, it seems reasonable to conclude that there is something like a relatively established discourse of contempt for Hollywood prevalent in the indie world. But—and this is very important—this does not mean that everyone who says something like this has the same intention or relationship to the discourse. For some people it expresses a genuine and deep-seated personal feeling. For others it’s a kind of posturing: to say something like this is to declare one’s status as an auteur, an artist of great individuality. For yet others (and we will see examples), they might say something like this today and sign up for a studio contract tomorrow. For the most part I am not interested in this kind of individual variation or the quest for getting behind informants’ backs that this would imply. At the level of discourse, informants are always right, that is, regardless of their intentions or their subjective relationship to what they are saying, they nonetheless say what they say, and what they say is, from this perspective, an instance of a particular discourse. I am, on the other hand, interested in contestations over the discourse itself, as when people question the reality of the indie/Hollywood opposition, or when people question the very possibility of independence from ‘‘Hollywood’’ in today’s world of media conglomeration. These contestations open questions of the ideological nature of the discourse, and I will explore some of them later in this chapter.\n\nMAKING INDEPENDENCE\n\n31\n\nOne more point should be made about this approach through language and ‘‘texts.’’ John Caldwell has written extensively about ‘‘industrial reﬂexivity’’ in Hollywood, about the fact that Hollywood is endlessly reﬂecting on, representing, and celebrating itself (2008). This is done through various media—through award ceremonies, through ‘‘making of ’’ documentaries, and most importantly, for my purposes, through ﬁlms. Films about ﬁlmmaking constitute a kind of auto-ethnography of Hollywood—in Clifford Geertz’s famous phrase, ‘‘a story they tell themselves about themselves’’ (1973a: 448). The world of independent ﬁlm is not exempt from this kind of self-representation and self-celebration, though they often do it with more irony than is common in Hollywood. In any event, as part of the work of this and other ethnographic chapters, I examine not only how independent ﬁlms look at the world (as ‘‘cultural critique’’), but how independent ﬁlm people look at themselves. The Discourse of Independence\n\nBob Rosen, former Dean of the ucla School of Theater, Film, and Television, was one of the founding board members of ifp/West (Independent Features Project/West, now Film Independent), in which they tried, in the early years, to hammer out—amidst ‘‘prolonged and heated debate’’—a deﬁnition of what made a ﬁlm ‘‘independent.’’ They came up with four criteria: that the ﬁlm be ‘‘risk-taking in content and style,’’ embody a ‘‘personal vision,’’ be funded by ‘‘non-Hollywood ﬁnancing,’’ and embody the ‘‘valuation of art over money’’ (interviews, July 25, 2006 and November 10, 2008). Would-be and practicing independent ﬁlmmakers are encouraged/liberated to make ‘‘personal’’ ﬁlms, in which they tell the stories they want to tell, in the ways they want to tell them. As Hollywood is famous for controlling directors and the contents of their ﬁlms, ‘‘non-Hollywood ﬁnancing’’ is meant to ensure that the ﬁlmmaker is truly independent. The value of independence from Hollywood (and ultimately from the necessity for pleasing an American public that has been programmed with Hollywood values and expectations) is repeated over and over in the public representations of the independent ﬁlm community. One site in which it is particularly audible is at the annual Independent Spirit Awards, hosted by Film Independent. At the 2007 awards ceremony, a short ﬁlm was shown at the beginning of the ceremony. As I wrote in my notes:\n\n32 CHAPTER 1\n\nFilm Independent staged a competition for a short ﬁlm about the idea of ‘‘independence.’’ The winning ﬁlm, called Independence, was really pretty good, starring a homeless guy [standing amid his junk, including a tv with no screen]. He just sort of raps along in a funny way about the upsides and the downsides of independence. On the one hand, nobody can tell you what to do. On the other hand, your tv set doesn’t have a screen. It ended with the guy saying, of course, in order to be independent you needs lots of other people. (Field notes, February 24, 2007) The last point is important. ‘‘Independence’’ does not mean isolation; it means being part of a community of people who share the value of being independent from the mainstream represented by Hollywood. More generally, the term ‘‘independence’’ must have been repeated a hundred times in the course of the awards event. As I wrote in my ﬁeld notes while watching, People went on and on and on about the value and meaning of ‘‘independence,’’ and how everyone in this room shares this ultimate value. . . . The foreign directors seemed especially passionate about it—the Mexican cinematographer [Guillermo Navarro] who took best cinematography for Pan’s Labyrinth, and the German director [Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck] who took best foreign ﬁlm for The Lives of Others. One got the feeling from them that the ultimate horror is to have to bow to the views of others, and the thing about independence is really just following your vision without interference. . . . The German ﬁlmmaker said, the best way to have independence is to lower your budget. He made The Lives of Others, which [went on to win many prizes], for $2 million. He said ‘‘people are not in this for the money.’’ (Field notes, February 24, 2007) Another major site for the public reiteration of the discourse of independence is at the Sundance Film Festival, which I attended in 2007. I have a large-format (11& x 16.5&) brochure about the Sundance Institute that I think was handed to me as part of my packet when I picked up my pass, or perhaps was just lying around among the volumes of free literature at the festival.∞ The front of the brochure has the word ‘‘independent’’ in all caps and very large font. Above the word it says ‘‘Free the Artist,’’ and below the word it says ‘‘Free the Audience.’’ We open the brochure and see the MAKING INDEPENDENCE\n\n33\n\n‘‘Free the Artist’’ spread, which asks, ‘‘What if the question, ‘How will your ﬁlm . . . make money?’ were never asked? Then only two questions remain: ‘Is this the story you want to tell?’ and ‘What is the best way to tell it?’ ’’ (3). The idea of artistic independence is then given an urgent political spin: ‘‘What’s ultimately at stake—the creative use of freedom in an open society —is far too important to trust to economic or political forces, or to the whims of fashion’’ (Robert Redford, quoted on 5). As with Film Independent, but less strongly emphasized, there is an invocation of a balance between celebrating the artistic independence of the ﬁlmmaker and situating the ﬁlmmaker in a collaborative community: ‘‘Here, the tenuous coalition between independence and productive collaboration strives to achieve surprising results’’ (7). At the same time, there is much greater emphasis on reaching and indeed creating the audience that will appreciate these ﬁlms. We ﬁrst read the following: ‘‘When independent artists, free from the constraints of the marketplace and political pressures, ﬁnd their own truth, audiences are freed to experience new truths within themselves. The affect [sic] is intoxicating, addictive, and life-sustaining’’ (5). The brochure seeks to conjure an audience that is not merely open to the kinds of ﬁlms these ﬁlmmakers will make, but actually thirsting for them: ‘‘The Institute continually explores innovative ways to put the voice of freely expressed ideas before audiences that crave originality, diversity, and authenticity’’ (7). All of this comes together at the ﬁlm festival, ‘‘where independent ﬁlm meets independent audiences’’ (11). ‘‘Independence’’ is the core value for the world of independent ﬁlm. But it is very hard, if not impossible, to sustain all four criteria of independence listed by Bob Rosen. In particular, it has been difﬁcult to stay away from Hollywood money if/when it becomes available. More on this below. The Discourse of Passion\n\nIn The Field of Cultural Production, Pierre Bourdieu (1993) provides a theoretically sophisticated exploration and analysis of the world of ‘‘art.’’ Opposing both reductive social interpretations (e.g., linking speciﬁc kinds of works to speciﬁc social groups) and reductive ‘‘charismatic’’ interpretations (vesting the value of the work of art in the creative genius of its creator), Bourdieu develops the concept of the ‘‘ﬁeld of cultural production,’’ a social ﬁeld in which artists and a large cast of supporting players vie 34 CHAPTER 1\n\nwith one another for recognition and prestige, in the course of which speciﬁc values—of what counts as ‘‘art,’’ and of what constitutes good and bad artists, genres, and works—are constantly created, maintained, and transformed. At the base of the ﬁeld of cultural production is the fundamental opposition between art and commerce. The world of art as a whole sets itself off from the wider social and economic world as what Bourdieu calls ‘‘an anti-economy’’ that ‘‘is so ordered that those who enter it have an interest in disinterestedness’’ (1993: 40). More importantly, the art/commerce opposition structures the relationships between different kinds of art within the ﬁeld of cultural production: ‘‘The opposition between the ‘commercial’ and the ‘non-commercial’ reappears everywhere. It is the generative principle of most of the judgments which, in the theater, cinema, painting or literature, claim to establish the frontier between what is and what is not art, i.e., in practice, between ‘bourgeois’ art and ‘intellectual’ art [or] between ‘traditional’ and ‘avant-garde’ art’’ (Bourdieu 1993: 82). In certain parts of his discussion, Bourdieu divides the ﬁeld of cultural production into two subﬁelds, a ‘‘ﬁeld of restricted production’’ and a ‘‘ﬁeld of large-scale production.’’ The ﬁeld of large-scale production is the more or less commercially and/or popularly oriented zone of the ﬁeld of cultural production, producing for large/mass audiences. On the other hand, the ﬁeld of restricted production at its most extreme is one in which cultural producers produce only for the recognition and approval of other like-minded cultural producers, and not for more widespread recognition (Bourdieu 1993: 53 and passim). The opposition between large-scale and restricted ﬁelds obviously maps reasonably well onto the Hollywood/ indie opposition, and I will return to it later. Here I want to explore a particular manifestation of the art/commerce opposition in American independent ﬁlm, the opposition between money and ‘‘passion.’’ From the point of view of the indie world, independent ﬁlms are made from passion, from the ﬁlmmaker’s intense personal commitment (‘‘personal’’ is another keyword here) to tell a particular story in a particular way. Passion is the opposite of a commercial sensibility; the heat of passion is opposed to the coldness of cash.≤ Passion is also the opposite of a mechanical ﬁlmmaking sensibility; a ﬁlm emerges from the ﬁlmmaker’s personal vision, as opposed to (in the worst case) the formulas and franchises and mechanically stamped out ‘‘cookie cutter’’ movies of HollyMAKING INDEPENDENCE\n\n35\n\nwood. Filmmaker Richard Linklater wrote about going to a commercial casting agency when he was casting Slacker: ‘‘The place smells so much like the business side of ﬁlmmaking we run in horror. We’re now determined more than ever to avoid these industry types who have no passion for cinema. We’ll ﬁnd all of our people elsewhere and do the ﬁlm a full 100% against the industry way’’ (Linklater 1992: 4, emphasis added). Passion talk can be heard everywhere in the ﬁlm world; ‘‘passion projects’’ are virtually synonymous with independent ﬁlms. Ursula Jackson*, a partner in an independent but studio-oriented production company, had this to say: ‘‘A really good friend of mine just won one of the Nichols contests [for a ﬁlm set in Bosnia], which is the screenplay contest that is run by the Academy. And everything that wins that is so much a passion piece, almost a documentary, the ﬁlms are so involved in true life and all that’’ (interview, December 2, 2005). For another example, Cherien Dabis (Amreeka), a young PalestinianAmerican independent ﬁlmmaker, spoke about doing two kinds of ﬁlmmaking: ‘‘My career is such that I have my passion projects that I want to write and direct, and those are really mostly Middle Eastern stories, and then I also have this commercial sensibility, like writing on The L Word [where she is a staff writer], things I feel like I need to do to pay the bills, things I think are fun, that I would like to see made’’ (interview, April 4, 2006). Or Fred Irving*, the head of a specialty division of a studio, was talking about why producers would take risks investing in certain independent ﬁlms: There are movies of passion and the people putting up the money realize it’s a huge risk, a bigger risk [than backing studio ﬁlms]. It’s like buying junk bonds instead of buying high quality municipals or something. You know what your return is going to be, or you think you do, on a movie with Tom Cruise in it . . . or with certain subject matter. But other movies [like Brokeback Mountain] about gay cowboys, you sort of would say you’ll be lucky to make your money back. Everybody does this for the love of the movie; that’s the only reason you’re doing it. (Interview, March 27, 2006) In all of these examples, independent ﬁlms as passion projects are contrasted with studio or commercial ﬁlms: passion projects are personal 36 CHAPTER 1\n\n(Dabis’s Middle Eastern ﬁlms; Jackson’s friend’s ﬁlm about Bosnia), and they are made ﬁrst and foremost for love, not money (commercial ﬁlms are things that ‘‘pay the bills,’’ that generate big ‘‘returns on investment,’’ and are ‘‘good business’’). The quality of being passionate in turn is seen as important to a ﬁlmmaker as a personality in the independent world. Passion is often felt to be a necessary ingredient in making a strong ﬁlm; independent ﬁlmmakers are people who are passionate about their ideas and their projects. While it often comes up in casual conversation, I found an excellent illustration of this point in the hbo television documentary series Project Green Light. The series focused on a competition for funding for independent ﬁlms, with the winner getting $1,000,000 from Miramax Films to make his or her movie. The judging panel consisted of actors Matt Damon and Ben Afﬂeck, as well as producer Chris Moore and several Miramax executives.≥ The contest was launched by a script competition on the hbo website. The panel received something like 2,200 entries, and the number was eventually reduced to ten. The ten contestants were sent kits containing a camera, ﬁlm, and other necessary material and asked to shoot a scene from their movie. All of them were then invited to New York, where the tv series was being ﬁlmed. The ten were cut to three, but then the panelists found it impossible to make a choice among the three. At that point they invited the three, one by one, to come back and meet with the panel to make the case for why s/he should be the winner. Here we need to tune in to the dialogue and listen for the rhetoric of ‘‘being passionate’’: Producer Chris Moore [to the camera]: What was being looked for in a\n\nwinner was somebody who would deserve and live up to the fact that we gave them a break. And did they have enough passion to ﬁght the battle? The passion was something big that we were looking for. Ben Affleck [to finalist Pete Jones]: In your mind, when you got into this thing, what did you think would be the basis for the decisionmaking? There is no right answer. . . . Pete Jones [very emphatically and, yes, passionately]: It’s about making the best ﬁlm. . . . It’s about you guys screwing the studio system and saying, let’s make the best ﬁlm. Market the ﬁlm? Fuck you. Who cares? We are making the best ﬁlm. We are putting out a million bucks. I don’t have a million bucks. But studios have some money and a million dollar MAKING INDEPENDENCE\n\n37\n\nbudget won’t crush them. So let’s make the best ﬁlm that we can make and obviously, I’m biased. I think my movie’s the best ﬁlm to make. My ﬁlm probably wouldn’t get made by a studio. By a big studio. You know? I think that ‘‘Greenlight’’ is the kind of project that would make a ﬁlm like this. [Jones leaves the room.] . . .\n\nI was really bowled over when he walked out of the room and when he did that I really in my heart, I knew he was the guy.
