        "text": "We’ve been writing about boxing sim Undisputed for quite some time, but developer Steel City Interactive has been busy behind-the-scenes. Its long-awaited sports game was always intended to enter the ring on PS5, and now it has an official release date: 11th October is the big day. A new trailer embedded above should get you in the mood for what’s looking like one of the most promising sports games of the current generation.\n\nFor years now, the UK studio has been talking a big game. It’s promising the largest roster of licensed boxers ever, including names like Tyson Fury, Muhammad Ali, Deontay Wilder, Oleksandr Usyk, and more. But it’s the gameplay that looks revolutionary: the release features an innovative footwork animation system, as well as a heartrate-based stamina mechanic. It looks, and has always looked, incredible."
