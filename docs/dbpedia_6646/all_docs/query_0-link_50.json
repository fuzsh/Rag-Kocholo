        "text": "Indie Game of the Week 360: Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion\n\nIf there's two things I enjoy, it's Zeldersatzes and not having to pay anyone money. Fortunately, Snoozy Kazoo's Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion—a title so literal it makes the Japanese light novel industry sigh and wonder aloud how and when the art of subtlety up and died (though if it did, I doubt it'd tell anyone)—is a game that delivers on both of those beloved pastimes. As Turnip Boy, the titular rascally root vegetable, the player is forced to perform tasks for the avaricious onion mayor of Veggieville to pay off an exorbitant tax hike on his greenhouse property. He accomplishes this by wandering around the world in a top-down manner, entering dungeons, solving puzzles, finding items that expand his traversal capabilities, fighting bosses, and repeating the loop as often as is needed. The game's pretty flagrant about the whole Zeldersatz thing—though, like many I've observed in the past, tends to prioritize one aspect over the rest: specifically, the parts in Zelda where it leans harder on the \"-adventure\" half of its sub-genre categorization and has you provide items to the specific NPCs that request them.\n\nIt's not long before Turnip Boy finds a sword, but many of the other items and puzzles tend to revolve around horticulture: the local vicinity is full of plants that need a little watering (the watering can being the very first item you find, which Turnip Boy steals from a blind elderly neighbor like the hero he is) and these are often the linchpin for the environmental puzzles that bar your progress. Boomblooms create bombs that can destroy barriers, though you might need the Bomberman-style boots to kick them into place first, while others might produce damaging fireballs or warp portals. The game will periodically roll out new plant puzzles in the dungeons which then allow for you to explore further around the overworld, beyond where you've seen similar roadblocks, for health upgrades and a few superficial collectibles like documents (receipts, love letters, heavy books, historical records; Turnip Boy tears them all up for fun) and fancy new headwear.\n\nEven if the game tends to focus on a lot of silliness about sapient vegetables eluding their legally-mandated tithes while getting their haberdashery on, there's some darker edges to the game's backstory that find themselves sneaking into view whenever you visit the game's subterranean zones, particularly with regards to the previous occupants of the planet. I was mildly impressed that the game's lore involved more than just meme references and brassy Brassica rapa running amok; one boss in particular was kinda heartbreaking to deal with, albeit a tad ballbreaking too (I had some pretty serious trouble avoiding all those toxic pools). There's also a considerable number of NPCs given the game's tiny size with their own distinct personalities and foibles, and it's worth remembering whenever they mention something they want; chances are, you'll find it half the game later and will need to rack your brain about who may have mentioned dyes or spray paint or a missing apple-cat.\n\nThe game's size is often its biggest strength as well as detriment. For one, the game eschews maps completely as each of its areas and dungeons are small enough to not really necessitate them. Some, like the requisite maze that teleports you back to the entrance if you mess up, wouldn't work with them regardless. The overworld is easy enough to navigate though there are times when you might need to backtrack some ways to deliver items to someone; one exchange of correspondence between two tubers has you cycle back and forth between the bottom of one dungeon and the end of the aforementioned maze, which is almost certainly not worth the two free hats you get out of it. I would also say that the game's combat is not its strong suit, as it suffers from some iffy hitbox detection on its weapons and the all-too-probable result of an enemy trapping you in a corner and stun-locking you to death. Your only combat options are the sword and a dodge \"trip\", the latter ideal for avoiding harm in addition to taxation, but most boss fight arenas will also provide boomblooms that might need some figuring out to use effectively (but tend to be worth the trouble given their damage output).\n\nOverall, Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion is a goofy, slight, occasionally amusing (and occasionally grim) Zeldersatz that, well, has the sort of name that might easily draw your attention as it did mine when I was choosing what to play this week. It's not the strongest in its category by a long shot but its charms are innumerable—in addition to the subjective quality of the humor, the eclectic soundtrack and clean pixel art are both pretty solid—and worth slaking one's curiosity about. I'll have to keep a potato eye out for Turnip Boy's next adventure, Turnip Boy Robs a Bank, which looks to be a great deal more substantial in addition to the usual perks that come from a more confident sequel.\n\n(I know, I know, I probably should've picked an XBLA game this week given the number. I'm fresh out though.)\n\nRating: 4 out of 5.\n\n< Back to 359: Depths of Sanity001-100101-200201-300> Forward to 361: This Way Madness Lies\n\nMega Archive: Part XXXIX: From Wonder Library to F1\n\nWelcome everyone to another episode of Mega Archive, your monthly examination of the best (and the rest) of what the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive had to offer the world. 1993 continues apace with another mix of, and let's be honest here, mostly trash. Well, that's perhaps too harsh, but my god do we have a continued downward incline of quality with some of the \"highlights\" this episode. That said, we do have some genuinely great games too, and those are what keep me going as we move ever closer to 1994 on the horizon. (Not that 1994 will suddenly improve things, but hey. Sometimes reading all about bad games can be just as fun. What combination of factors led to such messes, and so on.)\n\nLet's take stock here before we get into the list proper: three sports games, two licensed games, more Amiga refugees, the most flagrant Sonic clone yet, and something that's not even a game. Oh, and another case of a second sequel to a Sega classic I didn't even know had a first sequel, following from Golden Axe III from a few entries ago. I'd make excuses and say we'll have a banger assortment ready for review in April to make up for it—which will be a Mega Archive CD, rejoice—but it's honestly going to get worse before it gets better now that we're in the shovelware rush that was the 1993 holiday season. Good thing I'm only doing wiki research for these and not trying to play them for real, huh? I'll leave the Blight Club games to the experts.\n\nOh right, we also hit 500 games covered on Mega Archive. Whee. I'd be more excited for the milestone if it wasn't for the fact we're nowhere near done. Still, that's a lot of Sega tapes, huh? Maybe I should make some graphs or something. Instead of graphs for now, how about this enormous spreadsheet of the Mega Archive, its many featured games, and links to previous entries? (Good thing to keep open as you read this in case you want to refer back to previously-covered games whenever I mention one.)\n\nPart XXXIX: 491-500 (October '93 - November '93)\n\n491: Wonder Library / Electronic Book Decoder for X'Eye\n\nDeveloper: Victor Entertainment\n\nPublisher: Victor Entertainment\n\nJP Release: 1993-10-08\n\nNA Release: 1995\n\nEU Release: N/A\n\nFranchise: N/A\n\nGenre: Miscellaneous\n\nTheme: Reading is Fundamentally Not What the Mega Drive was About\n\nPremise: Hey kids, *sits on a chair backwards* high-scores and Tetris kill screens are all good and great but you know what's really poggers? Literacy.\n\nAvailability: Extremely rare cart. Might be the least available thing we've covered yet.\n\nPreservation: So, this thing. It's an ebook reader that was built to be used on the Wondermega, otherwise known as the X'Eye in North America, which was a Mega Drive and Sega CD hybrid. You put this cart in the Mega Drive slot and then an .EBXA format ebook in the CD drive and then you could read it on your Wondermega, I think is the idea. As you might expect I couldn't really get too far with the emulated version, but I did see the title screen. Remember Wonder Dog? He's all over this software too; I guess they were trying to turn him into a mascot for the platform. Sega co-created the Wondermega with Victor, who are also the ones who put this \"game\" out. The X'Eye fared even worse: its pack-in \"games\" were Prize Fighter, Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia, and a karaoke CD that included \"Achy Breaky Heart\" and \"Two Princes\". Yikes. Anyway, a hybrid Mega Drive/Sega CD made some amount of sense at the time, but these peripheral products for it far less so.\n\nWiki Notes: There's no page for it and I didn't make one. It's ebook reader software, after all. I'm including it on here anyway though because it's kind of neat.\n\n492: Columns III: Revenge of Columns / Columns III: Taiketsu! Columns World\n\nDeveloper: Sega\n\nPublisher: Sega (JP) / Vic Tokai (NA)\n\nJP Release: 1993-10-15\n\nNA Release: March 1994\n\nEU Release: N/A\n\nFranchise: Columns\n\nGenre: Puzzle\n\nTheme: Isn't It Ionic, Don't You Think?\n\nPremise: Is this puzzle sequel more like Tetris or Puyo Puyo? Little of column A, little of column B.\n\nAvailability: Available on Steam, along with the first game. The second can be bought on Switch.\n\nPreservation: We move onto Sega's own match-3 puzzle game franchise, something they tried to make happen several times with mixed results, and with Columns III specifically we see the pendulum shift closer to Puyo Puyo as it takes on a more madcap cartoonish aesthetic and a more multiplayer-focused set of mechanics. The old Columns had you trying to hold on for as long as you could, but this one's all about crushing your opponent in as definitive and humiliating a way as possible. That means stacking up points you earn from breaking gems and spending them on attacking your opponent, which has the added benefit of destroying whatever their current piece is: bonus points if you can do it just before it lands in a spot that sets off a major chain for them (or was a super valuable magic gem). If you're proficient in setting up combos, you can also dump special trap gems on your opponent that messes up their field in a similar way to the power-ups in Tetris Battle Gaiden: penalties like making their whole field monochrome, or flipped upside down. This sequel's multiplayer focus was inspired by the arcade-only second game, Columns II: The Voyage Through Time, and would later make it to arcades itself along with (after a long while) Wii Virtual Console and Steam. It's also one of the fifty or so MD games to support the Team Player/Sega Tap peripheral, which allowed for up to five simultaneous players just in case you had four friends you wanted to subject to Columns.\n\nWiki Notes: Very little was needed here. Just a header and minor edits.\n\n493: Pebble Beach Golf Links\n\nDeveloper: T&E Soft\n\nPublisher: Sega\n\nJP Release: 1993-10-29\n\nNA Release: January 1994\n\nEU Release: April 1994\n\nFranchise: True Golf Classics / New 3D Golf Simulation\n\nGenre: Golf\n\nTheme: Golf\n\nPremise: Golf\n\nAvailability: Probably a little too dated to see any rereleases.\n\nPreservation: Oh boy. Golf. This is the first of T&E Soft's flagship golf series, New 3D Golf Simulation (True Golf Classics in the US), to hit the Mega Drive and it would be followed by three others named for and set on different courses (Pebble Beach Golf Links is in California, but you probably knew that). However, this was the only one to get a localization. The Saturn would get even more of the things, so I'll look forward to the day we get to that system (no promises; that would be a bleak project regardless of what Isekai Ojisan might tell us). As you could reasonably interpret from the name of the franchise, it's going for a simulation-style that uses basic vectors and the like to give you a vague sense of distance from the hole, though you'll be relying on information provided by the UI most of the time. While there are a huge amount of numbers and gauges it's fairly accessible, albeit incredibly slow due to all the 3D gumming up the works; I imagine the next-gen versions play a little faster. The only other T&E-developed game we've seen so far on the Mega Archive is Super Hydlide back near the system's launch, so this might be a step up (Psy-O-Blade and UndeadLine were theirs too, but the ports were handled by other companies). It'll be nothing but golf games from them from here on out though, including one more before we're done with 1993.\n\nWiki Notes: SNES double dip. Needed all MD releases/box art/screenshots.\n\n494: Awesome Possum Kicks Dr. Machino's Butt!\n\nDeveloper: Tengen\n\nPublisher: Tengen\n\nJP Release: 1993-12-25\n\nNA Release: November 1993\n\nEU Release: N/A\n\nFranchise: N/A\n\nGenre: Platformer (Mascot)\n\nTheme: Environmentalism, Oddly Enough.\n\nPremise: \"I'll let you copy my homework but change a few things so no-one finds out.\" - Sonic Team, 1993.\n\nAvailability: Awesomely out of print.\n\nPreservation: I know it seems crazy in this post-Superstars world but there was a time where people were eager to copy Sonic and rake in at least some fraction of the dough Sega made on the games and the license via his various extracurricular endeavors. Tengen was probably getting bored of porting over Atari arcade games made in the mid-80s and took a chance on a Sonic-killer with Awesome Possum, which aimed to deliver what the hedgehog was lacking: sanctimonious eco-warrior condemnation that took the form of esoteric nature quizzes between levels that you were made to feel bad about whenever you got one wrong. Love to get talked down to about how little recycling I do while jumping on robots as a cartoon rodent (fine, marsupial). Attempts to replicate the speed of Sonic, already dangerously close to being unplayable, coupled with Bubsy's loquaciousness (why was he an inspiration?) sees Awesome Possum fall way short of the mark of being a decent platformer, let alone the type of paragon that could topple Sonic from his throne. Still, points for trying.\n\nWiki Notes: Respect, this page was already pretty complete. Just needed the US box art (weird, since we had the JP one already) and a header image. That image of a gallery of animals looking disdainfully at you for a wrong trivia answer seemed perfect, somehow.\n\n495: Pro Moves Soccer\n\nDeveloper: ASCII Entertainment / BGS Development\n\nPublisher: ASCII Entertainment\n\nJP Release: N/A\n\nNA Release: November 1993\n\nEU Release: N/A\n\nFranchise: N/A\n\nGenre: Soccer\n\nTheme: Soccer\n\nPremise: Soccer\n\nAvailability: Nothin' doin'.\n\nPreservation: I couldn't say I was expecting much from a US-exclusive soccer game (way to pick the most soccer-friendly territory there, lads) that our own wiki had never heard of, but I was hit with quite the upbeat jam as soon as the title screen loaded. Turns out the composer for this game was one Jesper Kyd, of eventual Hitman and Assassin's Creed fame, who really was a kyd at the time: 21 years old and freshly emerged from the homegrown Amiga demo scene as a fledgling pro VGM composer. This is one of his earliest known game projects: he and his company Zyrinx (a proto-IO Interactive) would go on to make Sub-Terrania for Genesis the following year. Zyrinx was subcontracted here on behalf of BGS Development, the Danish half of this Europe/Japan team-up (again, the two regions that did not receive this soccer game) with computer game and peripheral developers ASCII; they'd worked together previously on the top-down racer Double Clutch, and after this neither of them would work on a Mega Drive game again (though ASCII would be very active on the Saturn). As for the game, well... it's soccer. It's not even good soccer. That's why I filled most of this blurb with behind-the-scenes stuff. Since it's a US-based game and they don't really follow the local teams so much, it exclusively features 32 national sides including \"Cameroun\", \"Rumania\", and the globally-acknowledged soccer powerhouse that is the Jamaican national team (this was the year Cool Runnings came out, so maybe representing Jamaican sports was just the trend at the time).\n\nWiki Notes: New page! Don't see these too often. Just wish it was for a more interesting game.\n\n496: The Chaos Engine / Soldiers of Fortune\n\nDeveloper: The Bitmap Brothers\n\nPublisher: Spectrum HoloByte (NA) / MicroProse (EU)\n\nJP Release: N/A\n\nNA Release: November 1993\n\nEU Release: July 1994\n\nFranchise: The Chaos Engine\n\nGenre: Shooter\n\nTheme: Steampunk\n\nPremise: Victorian-era UK has been devastated from within due to a retro-engineered \"Chaos Engine\" computer and its endless hordes of mutated creatures and automatons. Sort of like a clockwork Skynet. A group of mercenaries enter the beleagured nation to destroy the source of the ruin.\n\nAvailability: It's on Steam, or at least the PC version is.\n\nPreservation: Here we are with The Chaos Engine, the fourth Bitmap Brothers game to make it to the Mega Drive and probably the best known of theirs outside the UK (albeit under the name Soldiers of Fortune instead). It's a top-down shooter with multiple playable protagonists and a grim 2000AD steampunk aesthetic, named after and based loosely upon the William Gibson/Bruce Sterling novel The Difference Engine which kickstarted the steampunk genre in much the same way Gibson's earlier Neuromancer did for cyberpunk (Gibson himself seems like a very nice guy, so why he keeps inventing -punk subgenres is beyond me). As I've said about every previous Bitmap Brothers game featured on the Mega Archive, it looks great but plays kinda whatever; the visuals were always enough to charm the '90s British gaming press into giving these middling games rave reviews which, well, I never had a whole lot of respect for those guys even if I do live here. The Chaos Engine is ideally suited for two players, since it's a bit tough to challenge solo, and the many characters offer different ratios of hardiness and skill versatility: it's usually best to be the tank yourself and depend on your AI companion's support abilities.\n\nWiki Notes: SNES double dip. Just minor edits.\n\n497: Cliffhanger\n\nDeveloper: Malibu Interactive\n\nPublisher: Sony Imagesoft\n\nJP Release: N/A\n\nNA Release: November 1993\n\nEU Release: November 1993\n\nFranchise: N/A\n\nGenre: Brawler\n\nTheme: Never Letting Go\n\nPremise: John Lithgow, back when he used to be a scary presence instead of a goofy one, has stolen a bunch of money from the US Treasury and only Sly Stallone's guilt-ridden former mountain ranger can stop him and his gang of merc thieves. Also Michael Rooker's here too.\n\nAvailability: Licensed game.\n\nPreservation: Part of the fun of this feature for me is getting to relive my memories of all the crappy '90s action movies that were deemed important enough to get video game adaptations. To be clear, I love crappy '90s action movies as much as I do crappy 16-bit video games (which is to say, a lot) so this is right in my wheelhouse. I won't regale the whole plot here—I recommend just watching it as there's much to appreciate in how schlocky it is (I'll just say someone watched a whole lot of Die Hard back then (it was me))—but the genre the developers landed on was a belt-scroller brawler which, honestly, kinda suits the movie. You still get guns but it's mostly punching and maybe some climbing sequences. Not going to claim for a second that it's actually good (like most licensed games of the era, it feels very hurried) but how many Nintendo games have Lithgow as a final boss? It's just this and Harry and the Hendersons for NES (and man, did that game go off script). We'll be seeing this game again real soon on Mega Archive CD, as it—like most Genesis-to-Sega CD conversions—saw enough new content to be considered a separate entity.\n\nWiki Notes: SNES double-dip. Screenshots and release edits.\n\n498: Disney's Aladdin\n\nDeveloper: Virgin Games\n\nPublisher: Sega\n\nJP Release: 1993-11-12\n\nNA Release: November 1993\n\nEU Release: 1993-11-11\n\nFranchise: Disney\n\nGenre: Platformer\n\nTheme: \"A Whole New World\" is One of Them\n\nPremise: Homeless NEET catfishes a rich girl by pretending to be a foreign prince and gets away with it and they end up together and everything's just fine. Also, like Pekora, he bought a faqin monkey?!\n\nAvailability: Digital Eclipse revamped it and made it available on many modern platforms. Downside is you have to buy The Lion King with it. (SNES Aladdin is DLC, too bad.)\n\nPreservation: As far as Disney-licensed stuff is concerned, Virgin Games was looking to take Capcom's crown as the King of the Swingers, the Jungle VIP (wait, that's the other game) and it's clear from Disney's Aladdin that they just can't wait to be king (...) by how adroitly they took the license and turned it into a great-looking platformer with plenty of surprises and a pretty decent approximation of the movie's score. I think this was the only Virgin Disney platformer I ended up liking enough to complete: the ones that followed felt worse to play and were way harder besides. I guess kudos are in store for not just taking the obvious route and making a Prince of Persia ersatz. I think it was after this game that Virgin Games officially became Virgin Interactive, but I don't think our wiki makes the distinction and nor should it.\n\nWiki Notes: It was missing the JP box art and release. They got that Aladdin in Japan too, turns out.\n\n499: Dragon's Revenge\n\nDeveloper: Tengen\n\nPublisher: Tengen\n\nJP Release: 1993-12-10\n\nNA Release: November 1993\n\nEU Release: January 1994\n\nFranchise: Crash/Crush Pinball\n\nGenre: Pinball\n\nTheme: Dragon Deez (Pin)Balls Across Yo' Table\n\nPremise: The dragon got woke up by all the pinball you've been doing in his lair and, boy, he's just steaming mad is what.\n\nAvailability: Virtual Console. It was on that while that was still a thing. Otherwise, best bet is probably just playing Demon's Tilt as it's mostly the same deal.\n\nPreservation: We have another Tengen game so soon after the last, and I'm happy to report that Dragon's Revenge is a better game than Awesome Possum (as hard as it might be to believe anything could be better than Awesome Possum). This is the sequel to Devil Crash a.k.a. Dragon's Fury, but it's one of those \"in name only\" sequels like the British Strider 2 where its original Japanese creators (Naxat/Compile, who were busy making Jaki Crush instead) are long gone and it's just plain ol' Tengen on both development and publishing duty. As with the previous game, it's some regular pinball couched in a dark fantasy aesthetic that occasionally tosses enemies on the field for you to roll over as well as a bunch of other business that you wouldn't see on a physical pinball table. I know pinball purists are always in two minds about that kind of stuff, but I generally prefer it when video game pinball takes advantage of the medium to introduce new features and ideas that wouldn't normally fly. Bonus points if Kirby's there. Kirby's not in this, I don't think, but then I didn't get too far in it.\n\nWiki Notes: Skeleton, so it needed a lot of work.\n\n500: F1 / Formula One\n\nDeveloper: Lankhor\n\nPublisher: Domark\n\nJP Release: N/A\n\nNA Release: November 1993 (as Formula One)\n\nEU Release: 1993-11-05 (as F1)\n\nFranchise: Formula 1\n\nGenre: Racing\n\nTheme: The Bass Riff From \"The Chain\" By Fleetwood Mac (In the UK, Anyway)\n\nPremise: Take pole position in the world's fastest racing series in this barebones approximation of Drew and Danny's favorite motorsport.\n\nAvailability: If you're looking for a modern F1 game I believe there's a few.\n\nPreservation: I wish I had something more exciting for the 500th entry than this standard-ass Formula 1 racer. I think it has the shortest name of any Mega Drive game, if that's something? It's not? OK. I tried. (If this game was made today we would call that title \"Search Engine Suicide\".) So here's F1: it's nowhere even near the first F1 game on the system, which feels like the only way you could get away with calling your game just \"F1\". It's based on an Amiga game, though perhaps that goes without saying given the publisher, and we once again also have to credit UK companies Tiertex (sound) and The Kremlin (extra graphics) for some additional contract work. Lankhor isn't British though; they're French, and worked on a bunch of racing games before and after this game before going under in 2001 (we'll meet them one more time on Mega Archive). I have to admit, F1's got a decent framerate for a Genesis game with some basic polygons in it, but the rest of the presentation doesn't really do much for me; though most of that is because it's Formula 1 and that alone is enough to send me to sleep. What I will say is that it's the fifth best game I've ever played that shares its name with a keyboard key (after X, N, D, and Control).\n\nWiki Notes: Another skeleton. Text, screenshots, releases, the whole shebang.\n\nIndie Game of the Week 359: Depths of Sanity\n\nWelcome once again to Explormer of the Week: a feature wherein I play explormers and nothing but explormers. Well, that's probably how it appears by this point—I'm not going to argue that coming up with a new spin on reviewing these things isn't getting as challenging as the developers themselves coming up with new variations. The aquatic, submarine-based Depths of Sanity would appear to be a novel take on the \"explore a map and use upgrades to make progress\" format... if I hadn't already played so many of these things that I quickly recognized where it may have borrowed a few ideas, namely Aquaria, Song of the Deep, and The Aquatic Adventures of the Last Human. Still, I'm not averse to getting my \"Ecco the Dolphin Presents Cask-Strength Thalassophobia\" business on, so let's go ahead and frame this game up right.\n\nDepths of Sanity is presented in media res some time after explorer entrepreneur Abraham Douglas is fished out the ocean after his single-minded quest to find out what happened to his company's submarine craft The Baroness and its handpicked crew of five, one of whom was his own son Clay. They had been investigating a \"bloop\" signal from deep below the ocean's surface before their communication was suddenly cut off, and so Douglas took off in an adaptable mini-submersible to hunt them down. He relays all this to a company therapist after he wakes up, with the player living through his adventure as he tells a dark tale of visual hallucinations, ancient architecture of unknown provenance, monstrously deformed versions of common maritime fauna, and a trail of text and audio logs left behind by the crew that chronicles their unfortunate fates and the moments in their lives that led them there. Douglas himself goes through some shit, to put it mildly, so the game definitely has that \"psychologically unravelling hero in the face of inscrutable madness\" Lovecraft tone on lock. A natural fit given the themes of the deep ocean being a dark and terrifying place at the best of times.\n\nAs you might expect, most of the time you're exploring aquatic locales dealing with unusually large versions of lionfish, sharks, octopuses, pistol shrimps (which are real, but maybe not the \"Yosemite S(c)am(pi)\" you're picturing), moray eels, and other already-dangerous sea life. As you keep descending, you see new variations of these fish with some gross mutilations and even more dangerous (and occasionally bizarre) attacks to elude. Your craft can move in any direction—there's an alternate control scheme where you simply hold the movement stick to go in that direction, otherwise you're meant to turn with that stick and hit an acceleration button to move in a \"tank controls\" manner—and most of your weapons tend to only fire in the direction you're facing. Upgrades include a light for dark areas, hull upgrades that reduce damage or allow for harsher environmental conditions, multiple weapon firing types, torpedoes and depth charges for alternative firepower sources, and a handy little Castlevania backdash thing that is more useful than it first appears. The map tech is fairly basic but it does highlight doors with colors relating to what they need to be opened (a red line indicates an explosive you need to detonate with the right weapon in order to open the passageway, for instance), and the game offers a fair number of fast travel nodes (though it takes a while to unlock them) and save points. Survival is pretty easy outside of boss fights, as most enemies can be safely avoided; they only ever drop health and ammo refills, and even then only sparingly, so if you can avoid them it's best to do so. Some of the more persistent types will get in the way of any investigating though, so those can get fried and added to the menu at Red Lobster for all I care. You can also leave the sub Blaster Master style to explore narrower passageways, and these present their own dangers as you keep in mind your limited oxygen and a very vulnerable one-hit death status outside of the protective hull of the sub.\n\nOverall the gameplay's been pretty standard for one of these, with no particular exceptional characteristics beyond the slightly uncommon submarine/aquatic aspect. If the game stands out at all it's for leaning on that unsettling deep sea atmosphere and the way things get ever darker—both figuratively and literally—as you continue to sink further than any man has been before. The regular influx of logs as they get ever more bleak and distressing, the protagonist's own fracturing mind as he starts to hallucinate that his onboard computer is his dead wife (I suppose this is a Solaris reference, but I can't help but think of Samus and Adam's little chats in Metroid Fusion), some honest-to-goodness body horror as the entity down here communicates to Abe through his employees' waterlogged corpses, and just the way the environment itself appears to be growing more hostile and alien with every vertical kilometer descended. It's been some effective slow-burn horror so far, only slightly let down by the game's MS Paint-friendly graphics (whatever, it's better than anything I could muster up). Decent use of sound design too, though sadly the audio logs aren't voiced.\n\nI'm close to the end of the game as I write this—I just entered a thriving biodiverse graveyard of whale carcasses, which is a real thing called a whale fall, but the wiki article doesn't tell you just how gooey these places are close up—and I've been making notes of where to backtrack to once I sweep up the last of the upgrades. The highlights so far, besides the grim storytelling, have been the boss fights: I've narrowly beaten them all on the first attempt, which to me is perfect boss difficulty. Nothing like walking away from a tough fight through the narrowest of margins without having to suffer the ignominy of having to start over after one too many bumps. They can be a bit long and beholden to patterns where it's hard to damage them for a while, but they work within the confines of your limited movement set: it's not like you could reasonably expect to walk away from a full on danmaku battle with how deliberately the sub moves around, but these boss patterns do give you a moment to get your butt in gear and avoid telegraphed attacks. As an overall package Depths of Sanity been pretty solid despite the evident low-budget feel, and I look forward to seeing how much worse everything gets for these doomed sailors. I just looove misery, I dunno what to tell you.\n\nRating: 4 out of 5.\n\n< Back to 358: Costume Quest 2001-100101-200201-300> Forward to 360: Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion\n\nMento's Month: February '24\n\nFairly productive February, given it's the shortest month (even with the little bonus this year). Well, I say productive, if productive can also mean \"played and wrote about a lot of games\". I'll have to check with Merriam-Webster. (They still haven't gotten back to me about \"explormer\" yet.) We introduced a new feature on the WonderSwan I'll probably return to a few times until I hit an unholy pentafecta (see Merriam and/or Webster? I know difficult words. Call me an obsequious charlatan, will you?) of five Digimon games; my other regular features are still going strong-ish; and I managed to squeeze in a whole two big high-profile games between the many indies and retros and in so doing reduced my backlog from \"catastrophically large\" to just \"monstrously large\". High five, me! Hell ye- huh? How the hell did I miss? Oh, right, the drinking.\n\nNext big game for March will be... hmm, I just realized my \"35 in 35\" Final Fantasy list is out of date. Might have to address that. Comin' after you, Chaos.\n\nGame of the Month: Super Mario Bros. Wonder\n\nIt's no surprise (to me, at least) that the new Mario game was also my favorite of all those I played this month. I love crushing turts (perchance) as much as the next paisano but at the same time what keeps me coming back to these games is the sheer amount of creativity each new Mario squeezes into every square inch of its level design, to the extent that it'll take the time to program in some brand new mechanic or an enemy with a specific type of behavior and have it only exist for that one stage alone. Super Mario Bros. Wonder goes one step even further by allowing you to take some of these mechanics with you: the badge system gives you access to a whole bunch of extra skills in addition to passive boosts (sadly, you can only have one equipped at a time) that can absolutely transform your approach to any given stage. I think my favorite was the vine whip that acts just like the horizontal grappling hook in SteamWorld Dig 2; if you wanted you could probably just waltz through the whole game with it alone, though it obviously works best with vertical levels or those with a lot of solid walls to hook onto. Even the passive badges have serious consideration put behind them: one sprinkles !-blocks around levels like those generated by the Switch Palaces of Super Mario World, and it always astounded me how worthwhile an investment it was to keep that badge equipped as I'd see those blocks everywhere covering pits, blocking enemy-spawner pipes, or dispensing useful power-ups at opportune moments, and I wouldn't be surprised if large chunks of every level were designed with the !-blocks in mind. It's fine to focus on the unpredictable level design variety, the amount of bespoke challenges big and small in its non-uniform length stages, those chatty flora, and the madness that unfolds whenever you pick up one of its Wonder Flowers—and how great it is that the Mario universe is experimenting with psychedelic drugs again? Feels like it's been far too long since the halcyon days of \"Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy\"—but as a gameplay delivery service Super Mario Bros. Wonder has so much happening further down on a subtle level that can be easier to blank on when you're singing its praises to others. I'm just imagining what a Mario Maker 3 with the same specific badge-mandated system as all those expert badge challenge levels could offer to creative armchair designers.\n\nWhat soured the experience a little, as it has in every Mario game since maybe around 3D World, is the post-game super challenging gauntlet, and the reason these things are always super challenging is because there's barely any checkpoints and it's really just an endurance contest to see how many times you want to keep repeating the same 1-2 minute sequence for another opportunity to hit your head against the tougher next one. The first time I finally beat the Final-Final Secret Course I realized I missed the flagpole top by inches (I was invisible at the time, in my defense) and that in order to get the super secret final reward I'd have to replay all ten of its consecutive sequences again. And I did. Twice. It's good that it was the last level because I was thoroughly done with this game after that whole sorry episode was over. I wonder why the Mario devs feel like they need to hold back 100% to all but the most determined individuals? Don't get me wrong, the Secret World levels of Super Mario World were no picnic either, but they still didn't feel the need to make things artificially difficult by depriving you of sufficient checkpointing. Checkpoints exist for two reasons: it makes the game easier, sure, but also makes it far more palatable as you're repeating less of the content over and over ad nauseam. Anyway, rant over. Game's still fantastic by any practical metric and it's only when you compare it to its older siblings and their lack of insecurity about how challenging they need to be that Wonder feels anything less than a modern paragon of the genre. (Rating: 4 out of 5.)\n\nDarling Indies and Other Gaming Tomfoolery\n\nGod of War: Ragnarok\n\nI'm making my way through the few big Sony exclusives left—and given recent news, I don't expect we'll see too many more in the near future—and this sequel to the 2018 God of War reboot, that takes the very angry Greek man who can't get a gyro the way he wants it and transplants him into the great snowy north of \"Scandinavia-ish\" to contend with some very un-Marvel Aesir and Vanir, was definitely a game I had been anticipating playing even before its 2022 release. Granted, I've recently been less attached to these massive-budget, massive-sized, open-world games that still remain the only AAA single-player game anyone makes any more, but I do still like this particular franchise. God of War: Ragnarok's exploration and storytelling is generally superb, especially the smaller incidental stuff as you walk around and the characters converse to fill time between loading areas (playing this on a PS4, it sure does feel like Kratos and co. spend a lot of time crawling or sidling through cracks, or strolling around Yggdrasil's branches until the next realm opens its spectral doors). There's been a huge expansion in the number of lore-apropos characters that show up to deliver exposition, offer side-quests, or otherwise shoot the shit with our hero team and I'm glad to see also that they switch around your protagonist and his companion more than a few times as the game proceeds for a refreshing change of pace. I even like the villains: this Thor's a boorish, divided drunkard less than pleased about his current lot in life and almost uses violence as an escape from his awkward domestic issues, while Odin's even more of a trickster than Loki and played with a perfect amount of mean, sarcastic derision by former West Wing staffer Richard Schiff. They even gave Atreus two love interests, which is honestly two too many for that little twerp. Given the saga-sized length of the game, easily the match for many JRPGs I've played of late, the characters have plenty of time to grow on you as well as develop on the redemptive arcs they began in the previous God of War. Thoroughly impressed with both the presentation and the parts where you're just roaming around figuring out how to reach and open puzzle-locked chests or hunt the skies for where Odin's many Mountain Dew-colored raven spies are hiding.\n\nThe combat's still really meh, though. In theory it's dynamic and exciting as you juggle a hundred different moves to suit the enemies you're fighting, but in practice it's a deeply annoying chaotic mess of a system that feels like Dark Souls if you were in permanent fat-rolling mode and had a whole bunch of elemental facets and colored circles to track. Enemies tend to teleport short distances just so their attacks, once flailing randomly in mid-air due to what look like some very expensive and elaborate animations, now \"retroactively\" appear to have accurately aimed at you as if you were having a showdown with an online opponent and at least one of you had terrible lag. Healing between battles is a rare privilege, and thus you'll enter so many fights with a sliver of health left looking for death just so you can start that battle again in earnest with a full bar (not like there's any penalty for dying anyway, so why they don't just regen after battles is anyone's guess). Stats make a huge and appreciable difference when it feels like they probably shouldn't given this is an action-adventure title that relies on skill, like parries and dodging. The one good thing is how easily you can bounce between melee and ranged while in the thick of things, dispatching one up-close opponent before quickly switching modes to take down its ranged friend some distance away. Yet it's perplexing that a game with this high a budget that's a sequel on top of everything still has a combat system this sticky and ungainly. I struggled to tolerate the previous game's combat shortcomings long enough to complete its little valkyrie side-quest, but I've no idea if I'll have the same patience to pull that off again here with its numerous superboss \"berserker\" encounters. Yes, I'm sure I'm missing some nuance or other that'll make the combat considerably more palatable, but the game has a thousand different systems in it; I feel like I'd have to open up a grazing animal and stare at its intestines long enough to divine the arcane solution to make these fights less sucky. And no beast deserves to die for that.\n\nBut hey, we have a mad Viking writing poetry about other Sony first-party games and a talking squirrel voiced by ProZD. So it's not all bad. In fact, outside the combat, very little of it is bad at all. If I had to point to one more issue it's that it did make me think about death a lot; specifically, the death of my PS4 which had a whale of a time running this thing while doing its best (and, I have to give it to 'em, accurate) impression of a jet engine that just ate a whole flock of migrating geese. (Rating: 4 out of 5.)\n\nWonderSwanning, Mega Driving, and Sixty-Forging Ahead\n\nI now have three retro gaming features now, which I suppose is my own fault for being too cheap to buy anything new. The WonderSwan is a fascinating little guy: the missing link between the Game Boy Color and the Game Boy Advance, released between the two when I guess Bandai figured there was a gap in the market. Since Bandai mostly trucks with anime tie-ins that have limited international recognition (or appeal) they didn't think to release it outside of Japan. Either that, or the GBA torpedoed any plans they might have had cooking. I spent a brief amount of time with five randomly chosen games across both the standard black & white and color models, with Flash Koibito-kun—a puzzle game where a little ninja cupid helps a dude unlucky in love—being the highlight. I'll continue to build that list over this year, though I might not settle into a monthly schedule just yet.\n\nWhat will remain monthly, at least until November, are the Mega Archive and 64 in 64. This month's Mega Archive had one banger in Shining Force II, which was yet another reminder to play it at some point (I picked it up on Steam a ways back); the memorable Haunting Starring Polterguy with its then-unique premise; and an unfortunate amount of sports games (they always pop out of the woodwork around autumntime). The 39th Episode of 64 in 64 found us entirely unable to avoid the ubiquitous Midway Games with both games having some relation to the western arcade giant: Gauntlet Legends and Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits Vol. 1. Neither were objectionable choices in the end—there are many more Midway games I'd be less eager to try—and while I'd probably suggest finding other ways of playing the original arcade games they're based on, both now occupy semi-respectable mid-table placements in the overall ranking list. (At some point I'm going to have to separate that list into concrete tiers to give people a better impression of what's great, good, whatever, and worth avoiding.)\n\nBy the way, your hint for the next 64 in 64 duo is as follows: Two extremely Japanese games, one of which I'm fairly sure is the only game of its genre for the system.\n\nOh, also, I've finally updated the three most recent \"GOTY (Adjusted)\" lists as of the end of 2023. 2021 in particular saw a significant amount of reshuffling—including a new number one—though I've not yet played enough of 2022's offerings to work on that year's GOTY Adjusted list yet (that'll definitely change by the end of 2024 though; and who knows? I might even have a top ten for 2023 by then).\n\nGOTY (Adjusted) 2019\n\nGOTY (Adjusted) 2020\n\nGOTY (Adjusted) 2021\n\nThe \"Indie Game of the Week\" of the Month: The Procession to Calvary (Joe Richardson, 2020)\n\nKind of a low-key February, moving through a few of the obscurities I'd been sitting on for a while in the ol' Steam library (and, more recently, a whole lot of EGS freebies too) but I've splurged quite a bit this past month on bundles so I'm back to being spoiled for choice for future IGotW entries. What's wild is that I have thirteen explormers on deck: no idea when I'll get through them all but it's a fortuitous problem to have. Of February '24's four Indie Games of the Week my favorite would probably have to be Joe Richardson's Renaissance-art-inspired shaggy dog story of a graphic adventure game, The Procession to Calvary (#357), in which a bloodthirsty knightess embarks on a quest to murder the only man it would be morally OK to butcher, at least according to the kingdom's new ruler (and naturally the target would be the kingdom's previous ruler, now deposed). As an adventure game it's fairly straightforward and only starts getting a little complicated towards the end with the final scavenger hunt, but the goofs and the striking art style do much to elevate the totally fine gameplay.\n\nThe rest of the month's offering were a, uh, jumbled pouch. A heterogeneous haversack, if you will. Golf Club Nostalgia (#355) had an intriguing \"last remnants of humanity swirling around the drain\" post-apocalyptic bleakness that sliced (or maybe hooked) through the misery with a quiet, contemplative game of golf across the scattered ruins of human civilization while listening to a nostalgia-rich radio station, though any chill atmosphere it was trying to foment was undercut by how frequently annoying it was to try to play the game seriously as a golfing sim rather than just the tone piece I think it was earnestly aiming for. An example of trying to be two things at once and not quite managing either due to the split focus; the old \"bird in the hand\" dilemma.\n\nSuzy Cube (#356) was a super low-budget attempt to recreate Super Mario 3D Land/World for those of us unwilling or unable to part with the cash Nintendo always demands for their premium first-party offerings (or were already well acquainted with the game). It definitely looks like it cost almost nothing to make, but gameplay-wise it comes pretty close to the fluidity and precision of the Mario games: it's evident the developers spent much of their post-production tweaking time getting the controls down pat, and that was the right call to make.\n\nFinally, there's Costume Quest 2 from last week (#358). Another case of Double Fine delivering on their endearing cartoon charm while sacrificing any deeper nuance or elaborate mechanics or a more focused difficulty curve that other turn-based Indie throwbacks employ to set themselves not only apart from their peers but from the older games they wish to homage, all the while also elevating the format and making a case for themselves as the next step in the evolution of the genre. On the other hand, it seems obvious Costume Quest is meant for kids and teaching them the ropes of this hoary genre by oversimplifying everything was probably more the intended goal. Still, rough to come off Trails from Zero last month and have this be the very next turn-based RPG I play; it doesn't stand a chance in that comparison.\n\nThe Bonus Indie: LEGO Builder's Journey (Light Brick Studio, 2021)\n\nMy criteria for \"The Bonus Indie\" (where do I even come up with these wacky names???) so far has been either games too short or too straightforward to lend themselves to the 1,000 word weekly Indie reviews like the above, or those that might not otherwise qualify. Like this one: LEGO Builder's Journey definitely has an Indie feel from its modest length to its modest aspirations, but it's still published by one of the largest toy manufacturers in the world and the presentation exhibits the sort of budget a company like that would have to throw around on vanity projects. I'm always butting heads whenever I cover an Ori or an UbiArt or something else a major publisher tosses out there in the \"smaller games made for less with sometimes an archaic genre construct that collectively we have no better name for than 'Indie'\" sphere as an aperitif between their huge-budget tentpoles, so this segment will be a fine place for all those big fishes in little ponds.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's... well, it's a trip. In at least two senses of the term. It follows a parent and child as they hike through the forest to their home, using bricks in the vicinity to build little bridges for themselves across rivers and up inclines. Once they get home, the parent is called away for menial labor making solar panels or sound buffering or something abstract leaving the toy castle the two were building unfinished. The child goes into the basement, crafts themself a helper robot that spits out random pieces, and chases after the parent by first competing in some kind of game show before getting lost in the innards of a massive factory, one that eventually meets up to the mobile platform the parent is working on. The factory starts exploding due to the child's tinkering and the two pursue one another through the wreckage, eventually making it out via a flying machine. I'm not sure if it had any greater meaning to impart, but it kind of felt like I was having a dissociative episode half its duration. The proggy jazz music in some parts didn't help. I want to say it's going for that contemplative, artsy, somewhat entry-level gameplay difficulty puzzle-platformer type of route with its simple enough building puzzles, but there were times where the obtuse nature of the presentation also bled through into what you were meant to do to progress. A few times where I thought I wasn't gleaning the right solution despite the relatively low number of moving parts was actually just the game glitching out, so that was fun. I will say it's a very pretty game and almost kinda daringly weird given the Lego license is one almost as zealously protected and revered as Mario or Disney; that Light Brick Studio were allowed to make something that felt this strange to potter around with is a merit to those wacky Danes and their love of interlocking building blocks, or whatever the non-generic name is for Lego. Otherwise I just thought it was kinda whatever. (3 out of 5.)\n\nThe Weeb Weeview\n\nLast time I focused on a trio of anime shows I've been watching that seem to be the big headliners, at least of those that are enjoying their first seasons. Delicious in Dungeon, Frieren: Beyond Journey's End, and Solo Leveling have all been steadily improving since I sang their virtues last month, so I've definitely been sticking with them. This month I'm changing tracks slightly to talk about three isekai shows that might be a little more divisive, disposable, and/or obscure: isekai's now one of those genres that have become far too preponderous for most anime fans to follow too closely, instead looking for whatever few can break out from that crowd as legitimately great shows and leaving the rest to us hopeless isekai freaks. Your mileage may vary with the following three choices, but they're all shows I've been enjoying for different reasons.\n\nVillainess Level 99: I May Be the Hidden Boss but I'm Not the Demon Lord\n\nComing from the Japanese light novel school of giving one's properties overly literal titles, Villainess Level 99 follows Yumiella Darkness, what was at first a side-character from a highschool fantasy otome game (those where a female protagonist has multiple male romantic conquests to pursue) and now host to a reincarnated spirit from Japan. In the original script, Yumiella was an underling of the local mean girl who inexplicably was revealed to be the secret superboss of the game: one considerably more powerful than even the Demon Lord antagonist. Knowing her fate is to die at the hands of the heroine and her harem, Yumiella decides to make more of an effort to ingratiate herself with the student body and avoid \"evil\" decisions that will push her towards that bad ending. Unfortunately, she's as socially inept as she was in her previous life and her sheer overwhelming power, her affinity for creepy dark magic, and her obliviousness concerning her abnormal hobbies leads her to be misunderstood as a monster more often than not. In fact, half of the student body seems convinced she's the Demon Lord herself. But, yeah, I guess you could get most of that from the title.\n\nThere's been a few isekai looking to subvert the whole \"protagonist is OP\" trope—The Eminence in Shadow is a notable example, and obviously there's One Punch Man and Mob Psycho 100 before that—but this one's fun because it's couched in a Degrassi/Harry Potter teen romance format and follows relatable themes of being unable to fit in with the social cliques and accidentally poisoning your own reputation through any number of very public faux pas (which is something Harry Potter's author knows well enough too). Yumiella's a blunt character who reveals nothing of her emotions and thoughts to the outside world, though as the protagonist we viewers get plenty of both from her inner monologues as she flops through one misjudged social encounter to the next. Her immediately making an enemy of the game's romantic conquests by effortlessly blowing them all away in the disciplines they're the proudest of—the supercilious mage, the meathead warrior, and the haughty prince—is always funny and would indicate that the romantic content of the original game won't be something she'll get to enjoy in her side-character role, but the provincial noble's son Patrick who has a good head on his shoulders and a more understanding attitude might prove to be a better match for this stone-cold monster-massacring goddess. Tonally it's been an interesting mix of HS shoujo and fantasy shounen so far, though its story has been spinning its wheels a bit for the sake of setting up more of an episodic sitcom format. I also can't forget to mention the banger OP track from Mayu Maeshima: she performed the (equally great) OP for Isekai Ojisan too and I dig her deep singing voice and cool attitude.\n\nThe Wrong Way to Use Healing Magic\n\nKen Usato is a self-professed \"regular guy\" who admires, along with the rest of his school year, the beautiful and brilliant student council president Suzune Inukami and her handsome vice-president Kazuki Ryusen: two exceptional people who feel like higher beings compared to the rest of the school. However, unexpected circumstances affords Usato the chance to befriend both of them, discovering that they have their own insecurities and down-to-earth personalities that make them far more approachable than they first appeared. However, later that same day all three are whisked away to a fantasy world to learn how to be heroes: Usato assumes he was a stray caught up in the summoning spell by accident until he discovers that his magical aptitude was for the rare healing school of magic. This immediately makes him the target of the intense former knight commander Rose, another healer, who then puts him through the most arduous training imaginable to make full use of his magic. Specifically, physically pushing oneself way beyond one's limits while constantly healing any muscle damage and fatigue that occurs. Despite growing buff in mere days, Rose is adamant that Usato only join her as a \"Rescue Team\" member: those that act as battle medics that are required to charge into the front lines in a non-combat capacity, with the intent of the training being to keep him alive.\n\nThe show's arc is now poised to get into the big war the human kingdom has been preparing for against the demon armies (there's some tragic flashbacks of Rose's to get through first) so the sort of comedic tone it's been displaying so far might be taking a backseat to some battlefield drama before too long. It's not been that \"huge\" of a show so far in terms of its set-pieces and animation: the slower pace and levity suggests it's a bit more focused on characterization. Usato's an unassuming guy thrown into a situation he's struggling to deal with, but is good-natured enough not to let it change or overwhelm him (though he's been growing more of a backbone as he gets ripped from all the intensive training); his two peers are genuinely nice people who have been using this little adventure to escape their own crushing responsibilities and take a breather, though other responsibilities have taken their place (I particularly like the female lead Suzune, who is a bit of a secret otaku and the only one of the three to be stoked about the current situation); Rose is just a straight up badass hurling entire trees at people with a cold, samurai like attitude; and we have at least two cute mascots now including a large blue grizzly cub very particular about who gets to pet him that Usato has to carry around everywhere as part of his training. It's not the kind of show that keeps you on the edge of your seat (at least not yet; this war arc might prove otherwise) but it's solidly written and animated and one of my low-key faves for this season.\n\nMy Instant Death Ability is Overpowered\n\nAnother isekai playing around with the \"OP Protagonist\" trope, though in a slightly more unexpected direction. The lethargic and video game-obsessed student Yogiri Takatou is isekai'd while on a field trip, along with his entire class, by a woman announcing herself as a Sage: a human whose prodigious magical powers has made them something closer to a deity. She immediately kills the teacher and bus driver, adults too old to receive her blessing, and gives all the other students a magical infusion complete with distinct abilities and status screens to peruse and challenges them to become Sages like herself, or else be drained of their magic potential as living batteries for the world's elite Sage class. The few students that escape this \"gift\" are abandoned by their fellow classmates to be bait for an approaching dragon, including Yogiri. However, Yogiri does have a unique ability of his own: he simply has to wish a being to perish and it does, instantly. Using this skill, he defeats the dragon and escapes the bus with the only other survivor of the \"non-Sage candidates\", the plucky straight woman character Tomochika Dannora, and works to catch up with his double-crossing classmates while getting caught up in any number of incidental struggles along the way.\n\nI read the manga of this first and was floored by some of the big twists around the extent and source of Yogiri's powers and the more parodic tone of the story, which tosses in characters that greatly resemble those from other major isekai properties and have them be arrogant, murderous dickwads that Yogiri is invariably forced to put down in self-defense. The amusing deadpan nature of the \"nope, not dealing with this, die\" response to every scenario threatens to become old quick, but the show has the same unpredictable energy as One Punch Man where the set-up is sufficiently different each time that it doesn't even matter that you can see the punchline coming from a mile off. However, the show—compared to the manga at least, I've no clue about the original light novels—seems to be moving a mile a minute, making it hard for many of the goofs to land properly. After all, it's funnier when a villain has a huge amount of build up before they're summarily dispatched in the blink of an eye. I really love the material though, as it somehow manages to merge a standard overpowered isekai comedy with the online spookfest SCP Foundation of all things (let's just say Yogiri was extraordinary long before he got isekai'd), and displays a very refreshing hostility towards the trope-laden isekai genre. I've been seeing some folks turn around on the show (in a positive way) after the revelations of the seventh episode, which is starting to more strongly hint at just how terrifying an existence Yogiri Takatou might be.\n\nNot isekai but isekai-adjacent—shout outs to The Unwanted Undead Adventurer and Shangri-La Frontier. The former's about a kind if physically unimpressive veteran adventurer who is killed by a freak encounter with a powerful dragon and is mysteriously revived as an undead still retaining his memories and personality; like The Wrong Way to Use Healing Magic it has a more gentle pace and delves into character interiority more often as well as the daily struggles of adventuring, but the protagonist's design is kinda cool and it's been hinting towards a darker tone of late. The latter's a MMORPG-based show carried over from last year about a dude who pushes himself to complete shitty and broken games for the sake of the challenge and is able to transfer those skills to a globally-popular MMO with absurdly difficult \"unique monster\" fights that no-one has been able to overcome. The manga was said to have been the inspiration for Elden Ring's own magnanimous champion \"Let Me Solo Her\", and the show's vibe is very similar to their fearlessly taking on the strongest bosses with minimum armor and stupid headwear. It just finished an arc involving fighting one of these unique monsters, an undead robot samurai, and it had some of the best animation I've seen in an anime lately. Also two more banger OPs: that's a list I'm going to have to put together towards the end of March's Weeb Weeview.\n\nSpeaking of which, the theme for the shows I'll talk about there will be as follows: Cute shit. Just, y'know, cute shit. Even I, the legendarily unflappable Mento, need the emotional equivalent of a colonic irrigation from time to time by watching cute animes do the darndest things so look forward to hearing about those. Anyway, enough out of me for now; It's time to punch Chaos while listening to Sinatra, or whatever that game's about (I still haven't been able to figure it out).\n\nToo Long, Do Relinks?\n\nIndie Game of the Week 355: Golf Club Nostalgia\n\nIndie Game of the Week 356: Suzy Cube\n\nIndie Game of the Week 357: The Procession to Calvary\n\nIndie Game of the Week 358: Costume Quest 2\n\nMega Archive: Part XXXVIII\n\nAnyway, Here's WonderSwan (Part One)\n\n64 in 64: Episode 39\n\nIndie Game of the Week 358: Costume Quest 2\n\nI wonder how common it is to have developers where you're a fan of their whole style and maybe a few of the people who work there, but mostly only just tolerate the games they put out. Like you appreciate their moxie, or their adherence to a perhaps archaic way of doing things that appeals to your sense of nostalgia, or they're someone you followed over from game journalism and are rooting for them in the next leg of their careers. I have two myself: Supergiant Games, which no longer needs any grassroots support from me to bat for them after the unbelievable hit that was Hades, and Tim Schafer and co.'s Double Fine. Everything I've played of Double Fine's, from Psychonauts to... uh Psychonauts 2, has been good if not great but they're able to bump up my appraisal of those games due to the comedic style they exhibit, much like Schafer's earlier work with the LucasFilm graphic adventure games for which he became a known industry figure. Some DF games I didn't care for at all—Brutal Legend's affectionately silly metal leanings and Jack Black's full commitment to his role really carried that playthrough whenever the tepid RTS sequences threatened to derail it—but I've always mostly liked most of them. One game that I thought could've been a lot better, to the extent that a sequel that built on and fleshed out its mechanics had a real shot of being a truly great DF game, was the kid-friendly spook 'em up turn-based RPG Costume Quest. The sequel Costume Quest 2, which is this IGotW if that wasn't clear from the title and image, doesn't quite fulfill the concept's potential either, alas.\n\nCostume Quest 2 is set directly after the story of the first and works to resolve its cliffhanger conclusion as twins Wren and Reynolds, along with their neighborhood friends Everett and Lucy, pass through a mystical portal on the way to defeating their nemesis, the killjoy dentist Dr. Orel White whose hatred of candy and Halloween night pushed him into unsealing and controlling a realm full of goblin-like monsters to build his own sugar-free dystopia. The sequel pulls a BTTF2 and sees the pair of siblings appear in a future some twenty years removed from the present after Dr. White has already built his grim Biff Tannen hell world. The adult Everett and Lucy, now married with a kid the twins' age, inform the duo that they can still save the present by going twenty years back (or forty years from their perspective) to before a time-travelling Dr. White originally snatched the idol that kept the monsters safely locked away. It's an excuse for some time-hopping hi-jinks, not too dissimilar to the middle act of Schafer's own Day of the Tentacle, as the pair along with a rotating third member run into any number of excuses to fall into the original game's pattern of having a number of houses to trick or treat and either receiving candy (which doubles as currency, as well as a quick pick-me-up for emergencies) or being forced into a fight.\n\nMost of the gameplay loop involves running around these new neighborhood equivalents, from the town's Louisianan past as a bayou connected to a New Orleans-like \"French Quarter\" to the future dystopia with its goblin-run metropolis, all the while collecting candy while assembling new costumes and completing side-quests for useful (and often progress-mandatory) items. The costumes confer new \"jobs\" for the combat, in which each has a particular elemental type they're strong and weak against (which affects both incoming and outgoing damage), a unique special ability that requires you to max out a gauge first, and their own ratio of health and power increases. Beyond the one special, though, they all fight more or less the same with a few minor differences: for instance, the wizard (which takes a penalty to health for more power) has a normal attack that spreads a small amount of damage to the other enemies, while the Wolfman's attacks leave behind a damage-over-time bleeding effect. What counts most are the elemental superiority/inferiority traits, as it'll help immensely to ensure you're always able to do more damage and take less from the local enemies. (Unfortunately, you only get one costume—the founding father—that is effective against \"tech\" enemies, making it the only compulsory one.) The game, like its predecessor, also employs a \"timed hits\" system that further boosts or mitigates damage with accurate timing, and later provides a means of countering attacks albeit with some risk: you have to start charging the counter early, which means making a 1 in 3 guess as to which of your party members is about to receive the attack (it's sometimes obvious, but not always).\n\nOutside of combat, many of the costumes have their own traversal ability attached, most of which become essential for progress at one point or another. In fact, there's very few truly optional costumes in the game for this reason. Annoyingly, you have to switch your main character to this costume whenever you want to use this traversal skill and then remember to switch back if you already have a party dynamic planned out. Given Psychonauts 2 also had a lot of this constant menu tinkering with its powers, it's evidently not an issue DF has found a way around in the years between the two. Despite that, I found the exploration to be the game's highlight, including the many ways it would hide chests and other valuables around the vicinity and task you to uncover them while also being chill enough to sell you maps that give you a firm idea of how many secrets there are to be found (as well as which houses you've yet to \"trick or treat\", crossing them off afterwards Silent Hill style). The writing and presentation in general is still pretty good, albeit aiming for a younger audience. Of course, you could say that about every facet of the game too: much of the very simple gameplay and lack of features or variety definitely hearkens back to one Final Fantasy Mystic Quest for SNES, a game designed from the bottom-up to be an \"entry-level RPG\" for those unfamiliar with that subgenre.\n\nThat's really where I have an issue with the two Costume Quest games, which are fairly interchangeable if we're talking features and advancements. Anyone going in expecting the bar-raising of a Trails in the Sky SC or Baldur's Gate 2, where character levels have a higher starting point and the game feels secure enough to start rolling out the really heavy stuff for you to contend with, isn't going to get that here. It's as much of a softball as the first, albeit one where instead of a wider range of tactical considerations leading the difficulty curve it's instead ever more damage sponge-y opponents that inevitably do enough serious harm to your party that you have to pause your exploration momentum after every fight to go find one of the healing fountains to refresh—an inconvenience that makes little sense given the game's lack of random encounters (in the sense you always know one is coming, either because the enemies are wandering the overworld or the door you're about to knock on may have a fight behind it). It's a slog, in so many words, and the appealing wrappings around it can only do so much to keep you engaged for the long haul. Mercifully, it's not too long at around a sub-10 hour playthrough, so it at least earns my respect for not stretching things out to eternity like a few other turn-based RPG throwbacks out there. Much like Sonic fans and their own eternal struggle, I'll keep on buying Double Fine games enjoying their style while hoping that they're someday able to nail the gameplay half as well.\n\nRating: 3 out of 5.\n\n< Back to 357: The Procession to Calvary001-100101-200201-300> Forward to 359: Depths of Sanity\n\n64 in 64: Episode 39\n\nWelcome and/or apologies for this month's edition of 64 in 64, depending on your tolerance for second-hand suffering. This would be my regular glance into the library of the divisive Nintendo 64 console on the hunt for games worth preserving through the Switch Online service; the system certainly saw some strong first-party offerings, but what of its third-party support from those companies willing to put up with Nintendo's obstinate refusal to move on from cartridges? Well, there's one western company in particular that stuck by them to the extent that they published almost as many N64 games as Nintendo itself: Midway Games, the arcade giants of the mid-'90s. (Were I a less kind sort already exhausted by this developer, perish the thought, I might even say they got that name by following the Way of the Mid.) We'll be seeing two Midway games this month, such is their ubiquity on the platform.\n\nActually, truth be told, this month's duo were entirely unobjectionable. The random pick turned out to be a game perfect for this kind of structure, and I was prepared to have to deal with the pre-select being a game that has aged very poorly but fortunately hadn't too much. Sometimes I prepare myself for a bad time out of pessimism, paranoia, or plain old pattern recognition but then you'll get instances like this month where I kinda lucked out a little bit. Just a little.\n\nSpeaking of p-words, here are the prules. (No, these segues aren't getting worse, what are you talking about?)\n\nTwo games are selected for every episode. I picked one, one was picked for me. Sometimes the random pick ends up being the better game, but the odds are startingly low.\n\nEach game is played for 64 minutes exactly, give or take human error (I sometimes forget to turn the timer on). I just recently discovered that Windows 11 has a built-in clock app with a timer in it; I've been using a website in a browser like an idiot this whole time.\n\nI've tried to be a little more educational by providing some historical background as well as figuring out the various legal reasons why these games can't come to Switch Online in a hurry. I'd say the journal entries as I play through the game in sixteen minute chunks could be considered educational too, were constantly bemoaning one's lot something you could get an academic degree in. Like a \"Bitch, Bitch, Bitchelor of Arts\".\n\nWe're not to approach those games that have already passed the vetting process and been added to the Switch Online's N64 library. They are under the auspices of a host of powerful entities I'd as soon rather not deal with, otherwise known as Nintendo's legal team. Anything else is fair game though, even if they trend closer to \"bad games\" than \"fair games\". Pretty sure that's how the law works.\n\nIf you feel I didn't torture myself sufficiently this time, maybe your latent sadistic tendencies can be better satiated through these previous episodes. Last month's was a real doozy if you missed it:\n\nEpisode 1Episode 2Episode 3Episode 4Episode 5Episode 6Episode 7Episode 8Episode 9Episode 10Episode 11Episode 12Episode 13Episode 14Episode 15Episode 16Episode 17Episode 18Episode 19Episode 20Episode 21Episode 22Episode 23Episode 24Episode 25Episode 26Episode 27Episode 28Episode 29Episode 30Episode 31Episode 32Episode 33Episode 34Episode 35Episode 36Episode 37Episode 38Episode 39Episode 40Episode 41Episode 42Episode 43Episode 44Episode 45-=-Episode 46Episode 47Episode 48-=-\n\nGauntlet Legends (Pre-Select)\n\nAtari Games / Midway\n\n1999-08-31 (NA), 1999-12-01 (EU), 2000-04-07 (JP)\n\n=236th N64 Game Released\n\nHistory: Gauntlet Legends debuted in arcades as an official entry in Atari Games's Gauntlet franchise—an action-adventure series in which you must zealously protect your characters from harm and hunger as they traverse ever deeper into a precarious dungeon full of traps and monster hordes. Legends brings two notable changes to the blueprint: it's fully 3D, and it's fully an RPG with characters that can level up and grow stronger as they kill enemies and collect treasure. It still has that arcade mindset where there's little plot and a whole lot of fighting but it's easier to get invested in your character once you've levelled them up a few times, rather than just thinking of them as expendable \"red warriors\" and \"blue wizards\". The N64 was the first console to see a home version of the game (as well as its debut in Japan) though ports quickly followed for the PlayStation and Dreamcast.\n\nThis would be our eleventh featured Midway game, following Doom 64 from last month. I only have myself to blame if I'm the one selecting them but given there's almost 40 Midway games for the system it's only natural I'd like at least a few of them. Atari Games is listed as the developer in most online sources but at this time they were more or less interchangeable with Midway, having already been acquired by Midway's parent company WMS Industries which eventually consolidated their multiple video game divisions under the Midway brand.\n\nSo, I've been sweeping up the few remaining translated RPGs that we western N64 owners were fortunate to receive in order to complete a themed mini-project of sorts for the ranking table—a completionist cause I'll be returning to several times for my pre-selected game choices for this final season—and I'd almost forgotten that this Gauntlet reboot was a bona fide action-RPG, albeit a fairly mashy one best suited for breezy multiplayer sessions between games of GoldenEye and Smash. I'll lose something in playing it solo, no doubt, but it's a game I've spent some considerable amount of time with on the original hardware so I didn't want to finish this season of 64 in 64 without one last dungeon crawl smashing up monster spawners for old time's sake. My guess is that it will not have held up, if indeed it was any good in the first place. Let's find out, shall we?\n\n16 Minutes In\n\nI kinda suspected that my memories of this game would be a little rosier than the real thing, but then that's hardly the game's fault. It definitely embodies what an action-RPG made in the late 1990s would resemble if it also had to adhere to the mechanics and quirks of Gauntlet, a game developed in 1985. Choosing a character class and a color—I notice that there are four secret classes too, maybe a NG+ reward?—you also get to personalize them with a name and then you're sent off to a quest to recover runestones that'll eventually allow you to fight the evil god Skorne. (It's Skorne! A big demon with knobs!) Thing is, there's not a whole lot to it: you fight through monsters until you can remove their spawners, you collect keys and power-ups, and you just kinda make your way to the end of these of these little zones. Once back at the hub between levels, you can purchase other power-ups to take with you.\n\nIt feels like it's trapped in a limbo between something with more juice like a Diablo (Skorne's got the juice too, and I can't imagine a more beautiful thing) and its barebones historical antecedent. It's not been bad so far, but it's shaping up to be one of those 64 in 64 entries where an hour's about all I need before I feel like I've seen everything I need to. I'm two zones into the mountain/volcano area—the volcano's called Yserbius, presumably named after the not-at-all-esoteric online multiplayer CRPG Shadow of Yserbius (unless there's some common source from Tolkien or something)—so I'm going to see if I can conquer this part of the game before my time is up.\n\n32 Minutes In\n\nI have to say, this game's affectionate dumbness is starting to work its charms on me. As I've said, there's nothing particularly sophisticated about the combat system—you can swing to attack enemies from a distance, which is generally preferred if you're trying to keep your health up, but the character will attack anything automatically in melee range so they don't even let you have that much—and exploration boils down to having enough keys to open doors or finding switches off the beaten path. Most of the enemies I've found so far are goblins but the last couple of zones have started introducing scorpions (which the protagonist just stomps on instead) and these tougher lava golem things. When I say the game's affectionate dumbness, it's in the way the narrator gravely intones the name of every power-up you find (\"you received... the triple shot!\") or whenever you level up or have low health—the voice sample commentary being a Gauntlet staple—but also when you collect apples or meat or something for health your own character happily exclaims \"I like food!\" and I'm left wondering if this isn't a game meant for kindergartners. Definite \"baby's first RPG\" feeling as I keep going. Might explain why kid-me was so into it.\n\nOnly noteworthy thing was finding a secret (though not that secret; it was just lying out in the open) portal to an old-school top-down Gauntlet level full of purple minotaur coins. I have no idea what these things do—I couldn't use them, and I was only allowed to pick up 50—but I was warped back to the hub afterwards having completed the level I found the portal on, so I guess it was just a bizarre shortcut. The two big progress-important collectibles appear to be obelisks (there's three per area, and you need to activate all of them to access the next part of the game once the boss has been defeated) and runestones (there's thirteen in the whole game and I think you need them all to fight the final boss). The wizard you buy stat boosts and power-ups from in the hub area will also tell you where the next obelisk/runestone can be found for free, so they're really foolproofing this.\n\n48 Minutes In\n\nWe're getting to the point in the difficulty curve where you can't just wade into a group of enemies with your sword swinging as you'll get swarmed and pecked apart way too fast. The zone I just completed had a maze-like structure of bridges connecting islands that demonstrated how effective it is to destroy monster spawners from a distance and, ideally, from somewhere enemies can't reach you. Precious few enemy types can attack from range and they're also the only ones that don't pop out of spawners en masse, so distance is your best ally throughout the game (and it applies to all character classes too: even melee/tank characters like the warrior and valkyrie have ranged attacks). I've also discovered that any power-ups that seem kinda whatever can be sold for quite a high price back at the hub, giving you the cash you need to recover health or improve stats or get yourself a few extra keys and potions. The potions, by the way, don't heal you: instead, they're smart bombs and they're the only way to destroy the life-draining grim reaper enemies that occasionally hide in chests. Seems prudent to keep a stock of both keys and potions with you at all times.\n\nI'm enjoying my time here, I suppose. The zones are starting to take on some more elaborate level design between the hidden switches, circuitous routes, and tougher enemies that require more tactics by way of kiting groups until you can whittle down their number or the aforementioned \"neener neener neener, can't reach me\" abject cowardice strategy, which has always been a firm favorite of mine in any game. I've only got the boss left for this first main area—it's a dragon, which seems a bit harsh this early into the game—but I suspect I might've missed an obelisk somewhere that'll require me to backtrack a little.\n\n64 Minutes In\n\nThe dragon proved to be... troublesome. Maybe I'm running up against the limitations of the single-player approach, but that thing was murderously powerful and I couldn't hold onto my health or do anything like serious damage against it so I've opted for a path I call \"screw this, I'm out\" and have returned to the Cliffs zone for that obelisk I'm missing. Turns out the zone has a second route from the start that I somehow missed and I had just embarked on this other, higher road when the timer rang for the last time. I also read a hint scroll somewhere about an ice axe and a scimitar that might prove to be effective weapons against the dragon: I only found the latter of those, and it sits in a separate page of my inventory for key items being all inactive and such. As always, calling something a game for babies boomerangs on me without fail when I inevitably then hit either an insurmountable obstacle or a puzzle I can't solve, or both in this case.\n\nAnyway, I saw a decent vertical slice of this game and, well, it's a modern remake of Gauntlet. The RPG levelling doesn't add much from what I can tell, and as always your main issue is keeping your health up (though it did at least drop the \"health draining every second because it's also your hunger meter\" aspect from the original games) and not allowing yourself to be swarmed, either by using power-ups to out-DPS the regenerating hordes until you can reach their spawners or finding yourself a nice bottleneck or vantage point to whittle those numbers down in relative safely. I liked also that I could enable or disable the timed power-ups I kept finding, because it's not like I needed a triple-directional shot or a strength boost with no enemies nearby (though some, like the invulnerability, can't be left for later; darn, I thought I might've had something to help with that dragon). Either way, we're all done here.\n\nHow Well Has It Aged?: As Well As the Food I Just Shot. I think if you approach this game as a reimagining of an arcade classic with a few extra bells and whistles, rather than a contemporary RPG of that era, it's probably not the worst game out there. They did of course reboot Gauntlet again in 2014 with even more modernizations and QoL features, and you have Indie throwbacks like Hammerwatch that use that top-down style and crowd control-focused combat but added more considerations for a single-player RPG experience, so maybe Gauntlet Legends isn't really the best way to experience this series any more (if it ever was). Entirely acceptable though, especially given how few action-RPG options you had for the system.\n\nChance of Switch Online Inclusion: Warning, \"Public's Interest in Gauntlet\" is About to Die. Depends on what Warner Bros. wants to do with this franchise. The 2014 reboot didn't do a whole lot for it and I'm not sure there's enough demand for this particular iteration of Hungry, Hungry Hack-and-Slashers. If they ever did decide to start leveraging their old N64 Midway library for Switch Online they would definitely be spoiled for choice, and I doubt this will be at the top of the list.\n\nRetro Achievements Earned: 3 of 44. Curious mix here, including the unlockable characters (I think they are what the purple coins were for), some boss speedruns, and various level- and item-related accomplishments.\n\nMidway's Greatest Arcade Hits Vol. 1 (Random)\n\nDigital Eclipse / Midway\n\n2000-11-14 (NA)\n\n358th N64 Game Released\n\nHistory: Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits Vol. 1, a compilation of arcade games that were first released in the 1980s, is a little bit of a misnomer as they were all historically developed by Williams Electronics. As discussed above, Williams purchased Midway and switched the name of their video game division to that branding, leaving the Bally and Williams brands for their pinball tables. This compilation includes most of the same games released in the earlier Williams Arcade Classics: Defender, Joust, Robotron: 2084, and Sinistar. Exclusive to this N64 port were two more: Spy Hunter and Root Beer Tapper.\n\nAnd so here's our twelfth Midway game, so soon after the eleventh. I'm going to have to take a break from these jokers next month, provided the randomizer lets me. This is also our first encounter with Digital Eclipse. Back then, DE was a port developer that largely focused on converting arcade games to handheld systems like the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance. They became Backbone Entertainment for most of the 2000s (where they continued making arcade ports, this time for XBLA) and then relaunched as Digital Eclipse in 2015 with a string of well-regarded retro compilations like the first Mega Man Legacy Collection and The Disney Afternoon Collection, often praised for their vast amount of bonus materials like concept art and interviews. Fans of this site are also aware that one Drew Scanlon currently works for them, presumably pitching in on games that run into H-button compatibility issues. This is the only DE game on the N64: there was a Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits Vol. 2 but it remained a Dreamcast exclusive.\n\nI hadn't really intended to go full classic Williams arcade game-themed this month but I guess the randomizer app had other ideas. Still, though, I'm grateful it's something like this rather than some inscrutable NFL thing or the near endless number of other N64 sports games we've still yet to see from Midway. Having a selection of arcade games to choose from here means those 64 minutes will just fly by... or, at least, that's the hope. Six games for about ten minutes each seems very doable so let's see if I can earn some high scores before we're through today.\n\n16 Minutes In\n\nJust so I don't spend this whole session trapped in a \"Buridan's ass\" loop of indecisiveness over what to play, I'm going to go by how they've ordered these in-game. The first game the cursor sits on when starting it up is Root Beer Tapper, so I guess I'll start by slinging some suds. The emulation is a little rough—I'm dealing with two layers of it here, between the N64 emulator and the game's own emulation of the arcade games, so I can't quite point to a weak link but it seems incredibly sluggish given arcade hardware is always custom-built to avoid such technical issues. Or, well, I guess that would be the case in a perfect world. Root Beer Tapper might just be a sluggish game in general: you pour out pints of non-alcoholic beverages and send them across multiple bars to thirsty patrons, occasionally having to then intercept the empty glasses they slide back. One of the earliest examples of a \"plate-spinning game\", like Missile Command, where the true test is in your ability to multitask effectively while being conscious of the whole playing field. I got tired of it before I lost—I did lose the mini-game though, didn't expect all the shaken up cans to start shell-gaming themselves—and moved onto the next game.\n\nThat next game was Joust, which I would've probably said was my favorite of the games included here and definitely the one I've spent the most time with (via another home conversion, this time for the Atari ST). Designed by a newcomer to Williams's development team, who I'll call John Newcomer, the goal of this flying combat game is to collide with flying enemies—they're riding buzzards, you're inexplicably on an ostrich—but do so at just a slightly higher altitude to knock the enemy off and turn them into an egg. The egg, if left for too long, will hatch into a tougher opponent so it's important to follow through with every successful joust by collecting it; despite what Senator Armstrong might tell you, it is important to fret over every egg here. As the waves continue, you'll see more changes to the field: the lava will burn away most of the bottom layer platforms (which can help, since enemies and eggs will fall into it occasionally) and eventually the other platforms will disappear one by one to make the field more open and perilous. Gets tough quick, and this version also has some of Root Beer Tapper's slowdown which can really mess up the timing on your flapping (you have to hammer it to gain altitude quickly). I'll play it a bit longer for the next segment and then switch to a new game.\n\n32 Minutes In\n\nThat next Joust run didn't last long: I lost all but one of my lives to the same guy (it was the ping!) and when I finally beat him, the pterodactyl had already arrived. Completing the stage causes the dactyl to withdraw quickly, but it can still kill you if it collides with you as it escapes which it did for me. Snatching failure from the jaws of success, as it were. Our next game was Spy Hunter and I swear it felt like the emulator was dying: not only was it so slow that the famous Peter Gunn theme was unrecognizable but I swear it spent the whole time in a single figure framerate. I can't pinpoint this being the game's fault, necessarily, but it is telling that the two slightly more advanced arcade games they added to this port specifically were the two to give me the most trouble. I'll have to check some reviews from when this compilation came out to see if there's any corroborating experiences. Anyway, in theory Spy Hunter is a fast-paced driving game in which you're also required to eliminate enemy drivers who are trying to ram you off the road or otherwise destroy your flashy vehicle: you have weapons to deter them, each configured to attack from a different direction. I spent almost the whole run in low gear because the lag meant it was nearly impossible to react in time to stuff flying at you in high gear, though of course this meant I ran out of time before hitting the checkpoint. I've never been all that great at racing games to begin with, so I don't imagine I'll have done much better even if it had been emulated perfectly.\n\nAfter that is Sinistar. I've always liked the idea of Sinistar and I do appreciate a variant of Asteroids where the asteroids don't actually hurt you—the only things that can are enemy starfighter bullets and the titular cosmic terror itself—but it's chaotic as hell and always kinda frustrating when you're chasing a pixel around and can't quite seem to touch it. For those unfamiliar, you're in a race to collect ore from asteroids to create heat-seeking \"sinibombs\" while the red worker enemies around you are trying to do the same to build an in-progress Sinistar, a sapient dreadnaught. Once Sinistar is complete, he'll warn you with a \"Beware! I live!\" voice sample and start chasing you while screaming. Very perturbing stuff at the time. With enough sinibombs though, you can just blanket the playing field with them and let them do the work annihilating the scary space monster. The biggest problem is usually those starfighters, since they show up quickly and only take a moment to home their guns on you. Since I've been powering through these games and only have a couple left, I might spend a little more time giving Sinistar the run around before moving on.\n\n48 Minutes In\n\nI tire of Sinistar. So for this block I played a little of the two remaining games: Defender and Robotron: 2084. I've never particularly liked Defender since the speed of the game makes it far too easy to run into enemies and we go back to that whole plate-spinning thing where you're constantly rushing around saving humans from being abducted. In Defender, if an alien successfully snatches a human and takes them to the top of the screen they'll transform into a powerful \"mutant\" that will chase you down mercilessly, as if some trace of the human soul still within is pissed at you for letting them die. It does have some admittedly cool visuals, like the main laser weapon and the way it trails off into particles after being fired, but I've always sucked at it. What's more is that the game had its main fire and the hyperdrive (good for escaping a dangerous situation, much like its function in Asteroids) bound to the C buttons rather than A/B like most of the others. Fortunately, we're far enough along with console UI/UX design at this point in time that I could go into a menu and change the control settings.\n\nLast, we have Robotron. Similar deal in that you're protecting humans from hostile forces (this time it's other robots) but instead it's a top-down affair with a dual-stick shooter control scheme. This lends itself well enough to the controller I was using, though I should check to see if they let you switch between D-pad/Analog Stick, Analog Stick/C buttons, or D-pad/C buttons. Given you can move and fire in eight directions, the Stick would be handy for either. I think this one is my actual favorite of the bunch (sorry Joust) just because there's no slowdown and having two sticks makes it closer to the original arcade experience, but man do I need some practice at it. You can tell Geometry Wars got many of the same ideas from this: it's not just a case of being surrounded at all times by enemies, but recognizing each type and what they can do so you can prioritize destroying the most annoying ones first.\n\n64 Minutes In\n\nThere's one last game of sorts but, well, it's not really much to look at. It's a quiz game that drops the most esoteric trivia imaginable about the games included in the package, like what brand of coffee the developers were drinking while developing the game (Folgers) or how many cumulative seconds the game has been played between its release and the start of 1999 (3.25 trillion). Best I managed was 9 out of 15 and those were softballs like \"what company is advertised on Robotron's title screen\" as if Williams was going to drop some hot shout-outs to Namco on there or something. Whatever, I don't feel too bad for not knowing who Root Beer Tapper was sponsored by: it'd been better to put that information elsewhere, like an elucidating slideshow that told you all about the history behind each machine and maybe some less obvious high-scoring tips.\n\nThe menus do provide some decent options though. In addition to changing the button bindings you can also mess with arcade toggles like the number of lives you start with and how much you need to score to gain a bonus life, which overcomes the issue of these all being 1CC attempts by design. I embarked on a 50-lives run of Joust (they won't last long, I'm sure) to see how far I could get before the final timer was done. Absolutely massacred, but I held on in there until the 9th Wave. The 8th was hardest: the pterodactyl is summoned immediately and remains a lethal presence throughout. I lucked out and managed to bop it on its snoot, which instantly kills it for a big reward, but that's not something you can rely on unless you're super accurate. I feel like I've accomplished everything I set out to do here, which was to play Defender exactly once before bailing, do a fair job getting some distance into Sinistar, Joust, and Robotron (the good ones), and commiserate over the dire states of Spy Hunter and Root Beer Tapper, neither of which I had much of a fondness for anyway. Mission success.\n\nHow Well Has It Aged?: Arcadeic. Archaide. Arc- Let Me Workshop This Some More. I mean, what are we discussing here? The 40-year-old games or the 25-year-old emulation tech used to preserve them? Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits Vol. 1 is not a good option if you want to play these classics in as close to an arcade perfect state as possible. We've seen many more revisions since and those tend to have better controller support to boot. Also, the work Digital Eclipse does now is so much better than it was back then so I'll just wait for them to revive this bunch in some future compilation.\n\nChance of Switch Online Inclusion: Thy Relevancy is Over. As I said, many better options available, so I can't see Warner Bros. signing off on bringing this specific compilation back. I have to imagine (without looking it up, because I'm lazy) that most of the games here can be played on Switch through some other fashion, reducing its value further.\n\nRetro Achievements Earned: N/A.
