        "text": "Untitled Boxing Game codes let you earn free spins and cash in the Roblox game.\n\nUntitled Boxing Game is a Roblox game that lets you take on other players in the squared circle. It lets you tell your own story similar to sports epics like the Rocky movies or anime Hajime no Ippo, as you take your wannabe boxer to a heavyweight champion. For every fight you win, you’ll earn more money.\n\nUntitled Boxing Game lets you use spins to unlock different fighting styles in the popular Roblox game, allowing you to change up your moves and keep your opponents on the ropes.\n\nCash earned by using Untitled Boxing Game codes and winning fights can be spent on personalising your character with gear from the Glove Shop, as well as buying additional spins.\n\nBelow you’ll find a list of the working Untitled Boxing Game codes in Roblox, plus instructions on how to redeem Untitled Boxing Game codes.\n\nOn this page:\n\nUntitled Boxing Game codes\n\nHow to redeem Untitled Boxing Game codes\n\nWhere are new Untitled Boxing Game codes released?\n\nExpired Untitled Boxing Game codes\n\nUntitled Boxing Game codes\n\nHere are all the working Untitled Boxing Game codes in Roblox as of 20th August 2024:\n\nbigcode - free spins\n\ndualemotes - free emotes\n\nfreeemoteforall - freebies\n\nthegames - 10 spins\n\n500mil – 20 spins\n\nubgforever - 10 spins\n\nmanyfixes - 5 spins\n\nwatwatwat - 5 spins\n\nipposreturn - 3 spins\n\nsettings - 3 spins\n\nteleport - 3 spins\n\nhawkrework - 3 spins\n\nkocash – $15,000\n\noneyear - $10,000\n\nfreecrates - $3,000\n\nkoanims - $3,000\n\ncashcashcash - $2,999\n\npocketchange - $2,000\n\ndelayapology - $1\n\nfreeemote2 - freebies\n\nSome Untitled Boxing Game codes can only be used in private or new servers, so if you run into problems redeeming any of these codes, try giving them a go in a different server.\n\nHow to redeem Untitled Boxing Game codes\n\nTo redeem an Untitled Boxing Game code in Roblox, you’ll first need to launch Untitled Boxing Game in Roblox itself.\n\nOnce you’re playing Untitled Boxing Game, look for the 'Codes' button on the left-hand side of the screen.\n\nIf you press the 'Codes' button, you should get a pop-up with a text field. Enter the Untitled Boxing Game code you want to redeem. Then click the 'Redeem' button.\n\nIf the code works successfully, you’ll receive the rewards as a message detailing what you've unlocked will appear above the 'Redeem' button.\n\nIf you receive the words 'Invalid code!', it means the code is incorrect - make sure to check for typos. You will also receive a message if you've already used this code.\n\nIf the message reads 'Expired!', you’ve entered a code that no longer works - this can be due to the code expiring or needing to be claimed in a private or new server. To check, you can try making a new private server and claiming the code there. Many Roblox codes expire after a few weeks, so make sure to claim the latest Untitled Boxing Game codes as soon as possible.\n\nWhere are new Untitled Boxing Game codes released?\n\nTo stay up-to-date with the latest Untitled Boxing Game codes in Roblox, apart from bookmarking this page, you can check the Untitled Boxing Game page for some of its latest codes.\n\nYou can also visit the game’s official Trello board to find more codes and find out more about its latest changes.\n\nFor more codes and the latest updates to Untitled Boxing Game, you can follow creator drowningsome on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nExpired Untitled Boxing Game codes\n\nBelow are all of the expired Untitled Boxing Game codes in Roblox:\n\ncomingsoon\n\nchronos\n\nbalrog\n\nmorecash\n\ndelayingsome\n\nvegeta\n\nhammer\n\nyamcha\n\n200mil\n\nrandomcode\n\nfeint\n\nfreeemote1\n\nfreeemote\n\nfreeunusual\n\ncharge\n\nbeowulf\n\nstyletitles\n\n250k\n\nvalentines\n\n100k\n\n120k\n\n130k\n\n140k\n\n150k\n\n170k\n\n100mil\n\n100mil2\n\n1000likes\n\n5000likes\n\n20klikes\n\n40klikes\n\n60k likes\n\nbalance1\n\nbruh\n\nbullet\n\ndashspam\n\ndataissue\n\ndonewithmigration\n\nearlybird\n\nemotes\n\nfps\n\nfreedom\n\nfreestuff\n\nfunnycode\n\ngems\n\ngetmoremythics\n\nghost\n\nhandslow\n\nironfist\n\njolly\n\njusticeforubg\n\nkimura\n\nmigration\n\nmoretrading\n\nnewlegendary\n\nnewyears\n\nnice\n\nperformancefixes\n\nranked\n\nshotgun\n\nshutdowns\n\ntrading\n\nturtle\n\nviolence\n\nwhitefang\n\nwhynot\n\nGood luck in the ring with Untitled Boxing Game!"
