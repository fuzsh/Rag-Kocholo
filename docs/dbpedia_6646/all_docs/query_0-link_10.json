        "text": "The Good\n\nThe movement was way ahead of its time and is still fluid and smooth by today's standards. It ran on a 386 and was fast action with a floating camera. I would love to see this game remade with better models and textures, but keep the gameplay identical.\n\nThe Bad\n\nI still have it on 5.25\" disks with a pristine manual but I cannot install it without dismantling my PC to temporarily install a drive. I think the copy protection would prevent it from being backed up on my hard drive. =)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nGreat. If you can find it, try it out.\n\nThe Good\n\nThe 3D engine in 4D Boxing was not a gimmick; at the time, it truly was a whole new way to simulate boxing in a computer game. The camera wasn't fixed--you could play through the eyes of your boxer, from ringside, from a fixed isometric view, overhead, whatever. You could even play through the eyes of your opponent. It's a real trip to stare yourself in the face as you beat \"yourself\" up.\n\nThe moves were rotoscoped fairly well, leading to life-like movements, swings, hooks, and uppercuts.\n\nThe Bad\n\nDialing down the detail to a ludicrously low level (stick figures without heads) was the game's idea of \"running acceptably on an 8088\". I had a 386, so I was fine, but it made playing the game against a friend difficult if your friend had a slow machine. The price we pay for innovation...\n\nWhile most of the moves looked realistic, jabs were oddly unrealistic.\n\nIt was rediculously easy (although quite fun) to beat the computer in the first ten or so matches by swinging non-stop roundhouse right and left hooks to the face. (And disturbingly satisfying to hear each punch land. :-)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n4D Boxing had a feel that no other computer boxing game has captured since, even 8 years after it's release. While there have been a few console boxing games that come close (including one for 3D0 that was heavily influenced by 4D Boxing), nothing satisfies the need to box like 4D Boxing.\n\nAnd it runs great on modern machines, so try to pick up a copy.\n\nThe Good\n\nThis game came out in `91, but it still has not been surpassed as the best boxing game, beating out Sierra Championship Boxing. There hasn't exactly been a lot of competitors since then, but I doubt they could beat the sheer fun of this game. The graphics were pretty damn good for the time (except for on an 8086, in which they sucked royally), but the gameplay really makes this. The game is just sheerly FUN. You could play it many times, and it still would be fun. It is just a triumph of game design.\n\nThe Bad\n\nCopy protection sucks, but it was virtually a requirement back then, so that can be overlooked. Also, you could beat the game hitting two buttons, but you didn't HAVE to. I truly cannot think of anything else.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nMah children, do not be scared off by the age of it; this is one of the best sports games ever made."
