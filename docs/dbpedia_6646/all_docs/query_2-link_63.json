        "text": "Iâm gonna get straight to the point, and my problem is this. Whenever I try to play PVP it always glitches out like crazy. The way it does this is by replacing my robotâs pictures with atoms head, and saying all their star rating is 999. It also says that the milestone points and steel I get from each match is XXX, and I assume this was as a placeholder when the game was created.(note, this is when I start the match) I never lose my win streak when this happens, but it takes away whatever cores I use to start the match as well as the silver it takes as well. It even happens when Iâm connected to internet, and this problem started when I wasnât connected. I just hope the devs can figure out what is happening.\n\nFine game but itâs annoying. First of all On the time attack mode if the timer runs out you immediately lose. This doesnât make sense at all because what if Iâm the one who has more health than the opponent? I should win no? Second of all online. Online just doesnât feel like Iâm playing with real people, I feel like Iâm playing with ai computers. Honestly I just feel like this game uses users robots and name to seem like they are actually fighting against you. Third of all the prices. Boy oh boy the prices, when beating a region you get little coins which wonât even get you to buy at least a bronze part. These parts cost at least a million or ten thousands. The upgrades are also odd, too expensive and take long. Also why do you have to pay to fight a player on online? If I already have those 10/10 in order to fight?!? Oh yeah fourth of all I also lost my Apple account because of these âfree gold coins offerâ â ï¸DO NOT TAKE THESE OFFERS AS SOME OF THEM ARE SCAMS AND WILL TAKE YOUR ACCOUNTâ ï¸ fifth of all constantly showing ads after fight. Please stop showing me an ad every time Iâm done with these fights, these ads are so long itâs so frustrating. Sixth of all why do they offer me a version of my robot upgraded with an expensive price no one could possibly afford unless you buy those $5 gold coins that only give you 80 gold coins which the upgrade robot cost at least 100 or 200 gold coins.\n\nIâve been playing this game for quite the while. When I was younger, I loved the movie and I loved this game but I would be on and off with it. Would I recommend this game to a friends? Yes. Is it perfect? No, itâs quite far from it. I donât really expect anything to change since this is quite an old game but still, there are minor glitches. For instance, sometimes enemy bots are still able to fight at 0 health. This isnât too bad but it did cause me to lose a fight once even though my enemy had no health. I also believe that the game is missing some things it could use, for instance, the game should have an âunequipâ feature, in case you need to take a part off a robot but donât have anything to replace it, and a âsellâ feature, to get rid of parts you dislike. Even if you sell it for less than itâs really worth, itâs still quite useful, especially for someone like me who has OCD and I guess it just kinda bugs me. There are other problems in my opinion but those are the big ones. Other thank that though, itâs a great game and I really would recommend it."
