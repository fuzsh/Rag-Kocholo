        "text": "ESPN, “Jock Jam Megamix” (1997)\n\nWhat It Is: ESPN’s one-stop medley for all the ’90s-era jock jam classics, stitching together over a dozen of the then-standards — many of which will be appearing later in this countdown — into one continuous jam-pumping-up.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: During the cheerleader routine before the game, maybe — though honestly, the thing is so purely 1997 that you might not hear it a ton outside of retro night these days.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Pump up the jam/ JOCK JAMS!/ Pump up the jam/ JOCK JAMS!“\n\nListen here.\n\nMacklemore & Ryan Lewis feat. Ray Dalton, \"Can't Hold Us\" (2011)\n\nWhat It Is: A no-ceilings anthem of achievement and perseverance, with a pounding piano hook and hands-up sing-along chorus.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: The final minutes before kick off.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Here we go back, this is our moment/ Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over…”\n\nThe Experts Say: “The beat is simple and easy to clap along to, the lyrics are uplifting and victorious and there’s plenty of ‘Na Na Na Na Na’s to make it fun. On Saturday games, I beat mix it with the Bay City Rollers ‘Saturday Night’ for the older fans.” — Roger Orton, Utah Jazz “Music Guy”\n\nCajmere, “Coffee Pot (It's Time for the Percolator)” (1992)\n\nWhat It Is: A gnawingly repetitive Chicago house classic, best known for its bubbling synths and overcaffeinated, mantra-like refrain.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Fan-cam breaks in the action.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “It’s time for the percolator.”\n\nThe Experts Say: “’Percolator’ is the perfect song to get the fans (and my hips) moving after I sink a backwards half court shot.” — Benny the Bull, Chicago Bulls mascot\n\nDaft Punk, \"One More Time\" (2000)\n\nWhat It Is: A celebration-for-all-occasions dance-pop squee, as futuristic as it is essentially timeless.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: In between the end of regulation and overtime.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “One more time/ We’re gonna celebrate/ Oh yeah, all right/ Don’t stop the dancin’…”\n\nThe Experts Say: “Why do we not have any Daft Punk in the national sports lexicon yet? ‘One More Time’ should be a standard by now.” — Justin Baker, Memphis Grizzlies Click Effects Operator\n\nThe Bucketheads, “The Bomb (These Sounds Fall Into My Mind)” (1995)\n\nWhat It Is: A horn-driven disco-house barnburner — the oft-sampled trumpet hook is originally taken from Chicago’s “Street Player,” though you might recognize it best from Pitbull’s “I Know You Want Me” at this point.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: In a moment of early-game momentum.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “These sounds fall into my mi-i-i-i-nd….“\n\nWolfmother, \"Joker and the Thief\" (2006)\n\nWhat It Is: A ’70s hard-rock throwback epic, with at least two electrifying and instantly recognizable guitar riffs.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: During late-game pitching changes, or particularly high-stakes face-offs.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: That arpeggiated opening riff.\n\nThe Experts Say: “We started using this song about four years ago, and it has become one of the biggest response-getters from our crowd during crucial moments… the clapping part gets everyone involved.” — A.J. Dolan, Chicago Blackhawks Director of Production & Content Marketing\n\nListen here.\n\nRepublica, \"Ready to Go\" (1996)\n\nWhat It Is: A zooming dance-rock hybrid whose megaphoned hook made it absolutely unignorable in the mid-’90s.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: The final minutes before tip-off.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “From the rooftops, shout it out/ BABY, I’M READY TO GO!”\n\nThe Script feat. Will.i.am, \"Hall of Fame\" (2012)\n\nWhat It Is: A motivational paean to the highest level of achievement, athletic or otherwise.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Soundtracking pre-game video montages, or enshrining franchise legends.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Standing in the hall of fame!“\n\nThe Experts Say: “You know what song is going to live forever? ‘Hall of Fame’ by The Script. We just inducted our legendary play-by-play voice, Al McCoy into our ring of honor, so we used that for him. We used that when we put up Penny Taylor’s WNBA jersey into the rafters.” — Cassidy Lien, Phoenix Suns Sr. Director of Game Presentation\n\nReel 2 Real, \"I Like to Move It\" (1993)\n\nWhat It Is: A rather forceful Eurodance song about the appreciation of moving it, moving it.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Cheerleader routines at timeouts.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “I LIKE TA MOVE IT MOVE IT/ I LIKE TA MOVE IT MOVE IT/ YA LIKE TO… MOVE IT!“\n\nBob Sinclair & Cutee B. feat. Dollarman, Big Ali & Makedah, \"Rock This Party (Everybody Dance Now)\" (2006)\n\nWhat It Is: A storming 21st-century update of one of the ultimate Jock Jams of the ’90s. (Shout out to Sinclar’s breezier “World, Hold On,” also a stadium anthem of choice in certain pockets of the U.S.)\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Coming out of timeouts.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “ROCK… THIS PARTY… DANCE EVERYBODY!”\n\nThe Experts Say: “A classic banger at the Madhouse [United Center] because of its big beat and sample from C+C Music Factory’s hit, calling out to fans to get out of their seats and ‘Everybody Dance Now.’” — Michelle Harris, Chicago Bulls Director of Entertainment\n\nKevin Rudolf feat. Lil Wayne, \"Let It Rock\" (2008)\n\nWhat It Is: A guitar-driven club banger that soundtracked every ESPN commercial of the late ’00s.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: T-shirt tosses and flight squad demonstrations.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Because when I/ arrive/ I, I’ll bring the fire/ Make you come/ Alive…”\n\nListen here.\n\nSteve Aoki, Chris Lake & Tujamo, \"Boneless\" (2013)\n\nWhat It Is: A predominantly instrumental electro-house scorcher, with bleating faux-horns and just the right amount of “Woo!“s and “GO!“s.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Bummer timeouts where house DJs need to put a battery in the back of a discouraged fanbase.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: That zombie synth hook, hammering a rusty nail into your brain’s pleasure center.\n\nThe Romantics, \"What I Like About You\" (1980)\n\nWhat It Is: A power-pop standard with more unforgettable mini-hooks than should be legal to host in one sub-three-minute single.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: As time-filler in between innings.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: The opening riff, four claps and one big “HEY!“\n\nImagine Dragons, \"Radioactive\" (2012)\n\nWhat It Is: One of the few obvious stadium-rock classics of this decade, with a dystopian lyric, booming beat and shout-along refrain.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Breaks in the hockey action.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Woah-oh-oh-oh-ohhh, woah-oh-oh-oh-ohh/ I’m radioactive, radioactive…”\n\nThe Experts Say: “[Imagine Dragons] seem to be writing music just for arenas. Anything by them… I would consider them right now, the most arena-rock. They just seem to be writing songs that make the most sense [for us].” — Brian Campbell, Nashville Predators Event Presentation Director\n\nJames Brown, \"Get Up Offa That Thing\" (1976)\n\nWhat It Is: One of James Brown’s countless ’70s funk classics, many of which were similarly related to “getting up” and/or “that thing.”\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Third-quarter dips in crowd momentum.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “GET UP OFFA THAT THING!/ And dance ’till you feel better!”\n\nEminem feat. Nate Dogg, \"Till I Collapse\" (2002)\n\nWhat It Is: Eminem’s most Rocky-like anthem of fortitude and commitment — until, y’know, that other one.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: The two-minute warning timeout.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out/ Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth…”\n\nThe Experts Say: “Granted, Eminem has more than a few classic stadium rockers under his belt, but this one stands out… I specifically use this song to amplify anticipation or moments where I’m trying to highlight grit.” — Poizon Ivy the DJ, Dallas Mavericks.\n\nListen here.\n\nFlux Pavilion, \"I Can't Stop\" (2010)\n\nWhat It Is: A dubstep perennial with one of the genre’s biggest drops, later borrowed by Kanye West and JAY-Z for Watch the Throne‘s “Who Gon Stop Me?”\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: During NBA team-montage videos on the big screen.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “I CAN’T STOP-OP-OP-OP-OP-OP-OP-OP…..”\n\nBush, \"Machinehead\" (1996)\n\nWhat It Is: A screaming alt-rock riffer from the U.K.’s most successful grunge acolytes.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Before the puck drops on the third period.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: If you remembering anything past the opening riff to this song, you are definitely over the age of 25.\n\nThe Experts Say: “If we only have 30 seconds to play something, we put LEDs on the board and then I play ‘Machinehead’ by Bush. It’s a driving song that says ‘Everybody make some noise,’ and everybody freaks out for 15 seconds, and then the batter walks into the box. We try to time it out where we can get enough people engaged, so a song like that is a classic.” — Tim Miller, Minnesota Twins/Timberwolves VP of Marketing & Events\n\nGarth Brooks, \"Friends in Low Places\" (1990)\n\nWhat It Is: One of the greatest sing-alongs in the history of country music and general drunkenness.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Out in the parking lot before, during and after the big game on Sunday.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “…’Coz I got friends in lowww places/ Where the whiskey drowns, and the bee-eer chases/ My blues away…”\n\nElvis Presley vs. Junkie XL, \"A Little Less Conversation\" (2002)\n\nWhat It Is: A big beat remix of a previously minor Elvis single, making it one of the King’s biggest posthumous hits.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: During timeouts when teams aren’t quite ready to pull out the big guns.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: Some combination of the Vegas-ready opening lick and the “A little less conversation, a little more action” chorus.\n\nThe Experts Say: “That was actually one of the few songs that got a request from a coach in-game. It was a visiting coach, George Karl. He wanted ‘A Little Less Conversation.’ ‘What is that? Can you play it again?‘ Usually we get complaints from visitors, so it was nice to get a compliment.” — Paul Kamras, Brooklyn Nets VP of Game Presentation\n\nThe Fratellis, \"Chelsea Dagger\" (2007)\n\nWhat It Is: An indie soccer anthem that was translated to North American sports — particularly hockey — via an overplayed Amstel Light commercial and the Chicago Blackhawks’ 2010 Stanley Cup run.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: After the goal siren.\n\nThe Part You Definitely know: “DA-DA-DUM, DA-DA-DUM, DA-DA-DUH-DA-DUH-DA-DUM!“\n\nThe Experts Say: “How could we not include this one? Chelsea Dagger, our goal song, has almost become synonymous with the Blackhawks in the city of Chicago and beyond. Every time we score, it gets fans immediately on their feet and has really turned into our anthem going forward.” — A.J. Dolan, Chicago Blackhawks Director of Production & Content Marketing\n\nListen here.\n\nYing Yang Twins feat. Homebwoi, \"Halftime (Stand Up & Get Crunk!)\" (2004)\n\nWhat It Is: A guttural call-to-crunk, delivered by at least two of the lifestyle’s most devoted practitioners.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Despite the title, usually before tip-off.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “STAAAAAND UPPPPPPP AND GET CRUUUUUUUUNK!!!”\n\nThe Experts Say: “Right before we tip the ball off in the beginning, I like using ‘Halftime’ by Ying Yang Twins. Just kind of a good anthem to get the crowd going right in the beginning.” — Cassidy Lien, Phoenix Suns Sr. Director of Game Presentation\n\nKISS, \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" (1975)\n\nWhat It Is: The ultimate example of classic rock serving as its own booster.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: After a swinging third strike to close the top of the inning for the home team.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “I… wanna rock and roll all night/ And party e-ve-ry day!”\n\nPennywise, \"Bro Hymn\"\n\nWhat It Is: A howling punk eulogy, originally written for friends of Pennywise’s Jason Thirsk, then re-recorded for Thirsk himself after the bassist’s death in 1996.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: For a couple years last decade, after seemingly any NHL team put one in the net.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “WOAHHHH-OH-OH-OHHHH!!! WOAHHHHH-OHHHHH-WOAH-OH-OHHHHHH!!!“\n\nPitbull feat. TJR, \"Don't Stop the Party\" (2012)\n\nWhat It Is: Pitbull’s version of a protest song.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: When the good times are rolling late in a blowout.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Y’all having a good time out there?/ YEAH-EE-AHH-EE-AHH!”\n\nThe Experts Say: “After a big moment, Pitbull’s ‘Don’t Stop The Party’ is a great way to keep the fans excited, dancing, and singing along.” — DJ Flipside, Chicago Bulls DJ\n\nRam Jam, \"Black Betty\" (1977)\n\nWhat It Is: A traditional early-20th century work song, turned into a southern-fried stadium-rock standard.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Before the quarter starts.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: If you make it as far as the vocals: “Woah, Black Betty/ BAM-A-LAM!”\n\nThe Experts Say: “That’s the kind of stuff I look for. What stands the test of time? You go back to a ‘70s song like Ram Jam’s ‘Black Betty,’ and to this day, the hair on your neck stands up.” — Paul Kamras, Brooklyn Nets VP of Game Presentation\n\nListen here.\n\nBlack Eyed Peas, \"Let's Get It Started\" (2004)\n\nWhat It Is: The BEPs’ formerly politically incorrect party-starter, made safe for the Super Bowl.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Right before the first pitch.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Let’s get it started (Hah!)/ Let’s get it started (In here!)”\n\nThe Experts Say: “The song that we play the most, in terms of pop songs, would be ‘Let’s Get It Started.’ We usually play that if the first batter of the half-inning gets a hit.” — Deron Anderson, Milwaukee Brewers Director – Audio/Video Production, Entertainment and Broadcasting Department\n\nFatboy Slim, \"Right Here, Right Now\" (1999)\n\nWhat It Is: A sweeping, near-symphonic big beat anthem with a relentless four-word refrain.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: As the crowd starts to find their seats before the game.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Right here. Right now. Right here. Right now.”\n\nThe Experts Say: “There’s a couple [songs I like to use if we’re down in the 9th.] If you were to talk about ‘Right Here Right Now’ by Fatboy Slim, that kind of talks to that whole wordplay of what’s happening.” — Tim Miller, Minnesota Twins/Timberwolves VP of Marketing & Events\n\nThe Gap Band, \"You Dropped a Bomb on Me\" (1982)\n\nWhat It Is: A synth-funk masterwork, with whistling bomb sound effects equally worthy of Funk Flex and early NES.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: After a dagger three from the home team.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “You dropped a bomb on me/ Baby…”\n\nThe Experts Say: “‘You Dropped a Bomb On Me’ not only signals immediate crowd happiness – but when you play it out at regular events people act like their team just hit the big shot and go nuts just the same.” — Justin Baker, Memphis Grizzlies Click Effects Operator\n\nDick Dale, \"Misirlou\"\n\nWhat It Is: A rapid-shred surf-rock instrumental, re-popularized in the ’90s by Quentin Tarantino and reinvented for the 21st century by The Black Eyed Peas.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Just after player introductions.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: That mile-a-minute riff, cresting and crashing like a thousand waves at once.\n\nLMFAO, \"Shots\" (2009)\n\nWhat It Is: A worldwide call for alcohol — or, interpreted at an angle, a personal anthem for J.R. Smith.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: In break-glass-of-emergency-type moments of low fan energy.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS/ ERRRYBODYYYYY!!\n\nNickelback, \"Burn It to the Ground\" (2009)\n\nWhat It Is: Nickelback’s paean to rage-fueled oblivion, with the best riff and maybe the best chorus of their career.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Does Pro Wrestling count as a pro sport?\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “We’re going off tonight! (HEY!) / To kick out every light! (HEY!)…”\n\nThe Experts Say: “There’s a big fallout [now] on Nickelback, but however, when Nickelback was its height there was a song called ‘Burn It To The Ground.’ And when that song came out, the lyrics were fine, but the background beats and the way that song was driven and built — we knew that would work in sports, so we asked the record company ‘Hey, can you give us an instrumental of this song?’ Because it was perfect for introductions, it was perfect for noise meters.” — Sean Bovelsky, Tampa Bay Lightning/Buccaneers Music Director\n\nMissy Elliott feat. Fatman Scoop & Ciara, \"Lose Control\" (2005)\n\nWhat It Is: A 21st-century electro reboot whose retro futurism makes it sound paradoxically timeless.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: At the Super Bowl Halftime Show, on a good year.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Everybody here, get it outta control/ Get your backs off the wall/ ‘Coz Misdemeanor said so”\n\nDMX, \"Party Up (Up in Here)\" (2000)\n\nWhat It Is: A seeing-red anthem for going totally brainless.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: When even “Shots” won’t suffice.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Y’ALL GON’ MAKE ME LOSE MY MIND/ UP IN HEEEERE, UP IN HERE“\n\nThe Experts Say: “DMX’s ‘Party Up’ is another one that we love to play. Fans young and old know that track, and it’s a great party anthem. It’s an instant-energy song.” — Anton Wright, Toronto Raptors/Maple Leafs Game Ops Director\n\nJohn Mellencamp, \"R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A. (A Salute to '60s Rock)\" (1986)\n\nWhat It Is: An ’80s heartland rock anthem about the U.S.A. that nobody has to feel guilty for screaming along to.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Any baseball retro night.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: All there in the title. (The main part, anyway.)\n\nFlo Rida feat. T-Pain, \"Low\" (2007)\n\nWhat It Is: The most universal ode ever written to two rather specific clothing items.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Fan Cam time.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Shawty had them apple-bottom jeans/ Boots with the furrrrr…”\n\nThe Experts Say: “We don’t do a whole lot of hip-hop [after warm-ups]. I will say the song that everyone still plays and has stood the test of time is ‘Low.’ Everyone loves that song, no matter what age you are. That’s the one we play when we’re showing crowd shots and stuff.” — Cassidy Lien, Phoenix Suns Sr. Director of Game Presentation\n\nListen here.\n\nP.O.D., \"Boom\" (2002)\n\nWhat It Is: Essential survival-of-the-frattest rock for the XBox era.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: When the coach calls a timeout after the dopest highlight of the game, just so he can flash the guy wearing the headset on the opposing sideline a “How ya like me now?” smile.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “BOOM!/ (Here comes the) BOOM!/ Ready or not, here comes the boys from the South…”\n\nJay-Z, \"Public Service Announcement\" (2003)\n\nWhat It Is: A Black Album deep cut with a beat drop more famous than most artists’ entire catalogs.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: At every Brooklyn Nets game until the end of time, that’s for damn sure.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Allow me to reintroduce myself, my name is HOV….”\n\nThe Experts Say: “There’s just something about how electrifying this song/beat is when it drops…each and every single time, it’s like you’ve never heard it before. That’s hard to find.” — Poizon Ivy the DJ, Dallas Mavericks\n\nDef Leppard, \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\" (1988)\n\nWhat It Is: One of those ’80s rockers so potent it applies to just about any general-interest activity where sweat is somehow involved.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: During routines by cheerleaders unafraid to flirt with the provocative.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Pour some sugar on me/ Oooh, in the name of love…”\n\nThe Village People, \"YMCA\" (1978)\n\nWhat It Is: A disco stomper undeniable enough for a heteronormative sports culture to not bother grappling with its obvious homoerotic subtext.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Anytime a DJ spots sedentary fans in the stands who looks like they’d be much happier putting their arms up in goofy shapes.\n\nThe Part You Definitely: “It’s fun to stay at the… Y! M! C! A!“\n\nQuiet Riot, \"Cum on Feel the Noize\" (1983)\n\nWhat It Is: One of metal’s first and most agreeable crossover hits, and one where all the really good parts fit into the first 30 seconds.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: If ever a song was made to soundtrack highly unscientific stadium Noise Meters…\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Come on, feel the noise/ Girls RAWK your boys/ We’ll get wild, wild, wild….”\n\nSNAP!, \"The Power\" (1990)\n\nWhat It Is: Definitive early ’90s techno-rap, digestible as an iconic four-word soundbite.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: During pre-game warmups.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: That jutting synth hook and its chorus culmination: “I GOT THE POWER!“\n\nPitbull feat. Kesha, \"Timber\" (2013)\n\nWhat It Is: A folktronic rave-up that no NBA fan can listen to post-2014 without also hearing Pitbull echo “Playoffs!” after every chorus lyric.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Pretty all-purpose, really.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “It’s goin’ down/ I’m yelling Tim-berrrrrr/ You bettter move/ You better dance…”\n\nThe Experts Say: “Another one with a really simple beat that’s good for clapping along to. And the lyrics are all about having a great time, which is what these games are for. A little dancey, but also a little powerful. It strikes the right chord for both guys and girls I think.” — Roger Orton, Utah Jazz “Music Guy”\n\nThe Blackout Allstars, \"I Like It\" (1994)\n\nWhat It Is: A Latin supergroup one-off that needs every bit of its collective star power to properly sell its riotous refrain.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Great T-shirt cannon music.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “YEAHHHHHHH BAAAAABYYYYYY/ (I like it like that!)”\n\nPhil Collins, \"In the Air Tonight\" (1981)\n\nWhat It Is: Maybe the slowest, most deliberate entry in the Jock Jam canon, but one whose cinematic sense of anticipation is still so goddamn adrenalizing it’ll get fans as pumped as any EDM drop — particularly once that drum fill hits.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: During team intros.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “I can feel it coming in the air tonight/ Oh Lord.” (And the drum fill, natch.)\n\nThe Experts Say: “What more can you say about a song that was released over 30 years ago and still fires up LeBron James before tipoff? I’ve never seen 20,562 people all simultaneously drum before the chorus more than when we played this before Game 6 of the 2016 Finals.” — Josh Sabo, Cleveland Cavaliers/Indians Music Coordinator\n\nSmash Mouth, \"All-Star\" (1999)\n\nWhat It Is: A ridiculous song whose Internet notoriety has yet to totally overshadow its stadium applicability in the sports world.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: During campaign season in every sport that doesn’t have a “Pro Bowl.”\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Hey now/ You’re an All-Star/ Get your game on/ Go play…”\n\nListen here.\n\nAC/DC, \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" (1980)\n\nWhat It Is: A walls-shaking, earth-quaking classic rock standard that nobody ever seems to get sick of.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Whenever house DJs are more in need of a song that everyone likes than one that’s situationally relevant.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: The imminently mashable main riff.\n\nThe Experts Say: “You find those songs that are gonna fill those holes that you need to fill in between [dance songs and Noise Meters]. So those are the songs that you go “okay, 30 second window here, puck drop, I’m gonna play AC/DC ‘You Shook Me All Night Long’” because people like it. People enjoy it. Whether they clap their hands, whether they just nod their head, they just like the song. So that’s the key.”\n\nBeastie Boys, \"Sabotage\" (1994)\n\nWhat It Is: A rap-rock siren so bright and blaring they had to make a cop TV drama to go with it.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Coming out of a 30-second timeout.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “AHHHHHHH/ Can’t stand it/ I know you planned it…”\n\nThe Experts Say: “Sometimes, if we’re really looking to get the crowd going, we use ‘Sabotage’ by Beastie Boys. That’s a good one.” — Anton Wright, Toronto Raptors/Maple Leafs Game Ops Director\n\nEMF, \"Unbelievable\" (1991)\n\nWhat It Is: Andrew Dice Clay’s greatest contribution to polite society.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: After successful field goals of over 50 yards.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “You’re unbelievable/ (OHHHHH!)”\n\nTechnotronic feat. Felly, \"Pump Up the Jam\" (1989)\n\nWhat It Is: The invention of the ’90s Jock Jam, in essence.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: When the jam needs to be pumped up a little more.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Pump up the jam/ Pump it up/ While your feet are stompin’…”\n\nGuns N' Roses, \"Paradise City\" (1988)\n\nWhat It Is: Arguably the greatest opening 45 seconds in rock history — and then another six minutes that you won’t have to worry about hearing at a sporting event in your life.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Before opening kickoff (or faceoff), optimally at a playoff game.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Take me down to a paradise city/ Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty…”\n\nListen here.\n\nRednex, \"Cotton Eye Joe\" (1994)\n\nWhat It Is: A dangerously stomping Eurocountry reinvention of a 150-plus-year-old folk song, and one of the most demented crossover hits of the ’90s.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Is it safe to play Rednex again yet? Can’t be that much longer, can it?\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Where didja come from, Where didja go?/ Where didja come from, Cotton Eye Joe?”\n\nDJ Kool, \"Let Me Clear My Throat\" (1996)\n\nWhat It Is: The nastiest, skronkiest sax hook recorded outside of Ancient Egypt, commandeered by the one old-school MC insane enough to attempt to ride it for five minutes.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Another good test for the Noise Meter.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: The sax. Good lord, the sax.\n\nThe Experts Say: “If you wanna go old school, a little DJ Kool, ‘Let Me Clear My Throat.’ Some people, they’re not gonna [know] who the artist is, but they know when they hear the first cut of that song. They start moving for some reason.” — Paul Kamras, Brooklyn Nets VP of Game Presentation\n\nFlo Rida, \"Good Feeling\" (2012)\n\nWhat It Is: The song that proved that Flo Rida’s golden touch with a sample and a vibe would cruise well into the 2010s.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: After a 10-0 run has the whole building rocking.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Ohh-ohhhh sometimes, I get a good feeling, yeah/ I get a feeling that I never-never-never-never had before….”\n\nJourney, \"Don't Stop Believin',\" (1981)\n\nWhat It Is: The most unkillable anthem of the late 20th century.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Down by two late in overtime.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: Really?\n\nThe Experts Say: “Because as a sports fan, down to the wire, you just can’t let go of any hope. And as a DJ, you can’t help but love the sound of thousands of voices singing like there’s no tomorrow.” — Poizon Ivy the DJ, Dallas Mavericks\n\nFort Minor, \"Remember the Name\" (2005)\n\nWhat It Is: Mike Shinoda’s signature moment outside of Linkin Park — sorry, “Where’d You Go” — custom-designed for exercise playlists and NBA commercials.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Starting lineup introductions.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “This is ten percent luck/ Twenty percent skill/ Fifteen percent concentrated power of will…”\n\nListen here.\n\nSugarhill Gang, \"Apache\" (1981)\n\nWhat It Is: The Old West comes to the block party — and thanks to Will and Carlton, a goofy-dance evergreen.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Fan Cam, all day.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Tonto, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it/ Kemosabe, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it…”\n\nThe Experts Say: “‘Apache’ is an all-out classic. Within 4 counts it immediately gets people up and rocking their hips.” — Justin Baker, Memphis Grizzlies Click Effects Operator\n\n2 Unlimited, \"Twilight Zone\" (1992)\n\nWhat It Is: The halfway point between The KLF’s stadium-house grabs at world domination, and the Immortals’ version of the Mortal Kombat theme.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: When shit is about to get real.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: Four bars of seizure-inducing synths, a pregnant pause, and one word’s punctuation: “WOO!“\n\nBeastie Boys, \"Fight for Your Right\" (1986)\n\nWhat It Is: A mission statement for adolescents not yet aware that life gets any more dramatic than Game 7.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: After your enforcer gets sent to the penalty box.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “YOU GOTTA FIGHT… FOR YOUR RIGHT… TO PARRRRRRRR-TAYYYYY!“\n\nTaio Cruz, \"Dynamite\" (2010)\n\nWhat It Is: The world’s most celebratory song ever inspired by an oncoming period of sobriety.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: During an early energy lag.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “I throw my hands up in the air sometimes/ Saying AYYYYYYY-O, GOTTA LETTTT GO….”\n\nThe Experts Say: “Even though that song’s a few years old, it still sounds current, so the kids aren’t offended by it. And the moms and dads will get up and react to it.” — Paul Kamras, Brooklyn Nets VP of Game Presentation\n\nAVICII, \"Levels\" (2011)\n\nWhat It Is: One of the enduring anthems of the EDM era, and still the greatest use of that damn Etta James sample.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: As the pick-up song going into the third period.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: Once more with feeling: “Ohh-ohhhh sometimes, I get a good feeling, yeah/ I get a feeling that I never-never-never-never had before….”\n\nThe Experts Say: “‘Levels’ has a hopeful and celebratory vibe that just makes you happy and want to dance.” — Michelle Harris, Chicago Bulls Director of Entertainment\n\nListen here.\n\nJennifer Lopez, \"Let's Get Loud\" (2000)\n\nWhat It Is: The most obviously Latin-tinged of J.Lo’s early hits, and an irresistible challenge for audience participation.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: The final few minutes of halftime.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Let’s get loud/ Let’s get loud.”\n\nMotley Crue, \"Kickstart My Heart\" (1989)\n\nWhat It Is: A roadster psalm that with an intro that contains more reving up than a Knute Rockne speech.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: When your defensive line is going out there to get the biggest stop of the game.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: The motorcycle-approximating opening guitar squall.\n\nThe Experts Say: “This song has such a great build to it that fans seem to mimic the song, and just get louder as the song does.” — Craig Turney, Denver Broncos DJ\n\nTodd Rundgren, \"Bang the Drum All Day\" (1983)\n\nWhat It Is: A bizarrely Buffett-esque skanker from one of the art-rock GOATs, whose purity of essence has helped it endure far better than its No. 63 Hot 100 peak would’ve suggested 34 years ago.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: After a hard-earned touchdown.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “I don’t wanna work/ I wanna bang on the drum all day.”\n\nStevie Ray Vaughan, \"The House Is Rockin'\" (1989)\n\nWhat It Is: A blues-rock boogie that still works surprisingly well on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: When the titular claim isn’t too much of a stretch.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Well the house is a-‘rockin’, don’t bother knockin’…”\n\nThe Experts Say: “Here, we’ll mix in some country songs… ‘The House Is Rockin’,’ that one’s fantastic to use.” — Cassidy Lien, Phoenix Suns Sr. Director of Game Presentation\n\nSteam, \"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\" (1969)\n\nWhat It Is: A song good enough that its writers had to invent a band to release it, and one that endures as perhaps the greatest musical taunt since “Neener neener neener.”\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: When an opposing player strikes out, fouls out, gets taken out or gets kicked out.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Na na na na/ Na na na na/ HEY HEY-EYYY/ Goodbye”\n\nListen here.\n\nKris Kross, \"Jump\" (1992)\n\nWhat It Is: A proto-viral teen-rap smash with a screeching hook and just one verb on its mind.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: If all four pro sports had jump-ball situations, this’d probably be Top 5.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “The Mac Daddy’ll make ya/ (JUMP! JUMP!)/ The Daddy Mac’ll make ya/ (JUMP! JUMP!)”\n\nThe Experts Say: “For whatever reason, this makes people just want to jump, jump.” — Poizon Ivy the DJ, Dallas Mavericks\n\nThe Black Eyed Peas, \"I Gotta Feeling\" (2009)\n\nWhat It Is: The perfect soundtrack to unwavering pre-game cockiness.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: During warm-ups.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “I got a feeling/ (Woo-hoo)/ That tonight’s gonna be a good night…”\n\nDJ Khaled feat.

The hook especially encourages fan behavior and creates a fervor after a team win.” — Laura Johnson, San Francisco 49ers Senior Manager of Game Presentation and Live Events\n\nKanye West, \"Power\" (2010)\n\nWhat It Is: A musical turning point in Kanye West’s career, and an enduring stadium anthem (at least for its first 10 seconds) that it’s unlikely even ‘Ye saw coming.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: During a key defensive stand.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Uh-uh (clap-clap-clap)/ YEAHHH-AHHHHH (clap-clap-clap)”\n\nThe Experts Say: “The more people clap their hands, the less likely they are to not be engaged in the game. If I make the fans clap as much as possible, my job is well done. This song helps me get the job done each and every time.” — Poizon Ivy the DJ, Dallas Mavericks\n\nLed Zeppelin, \"Rock & Roll\" (1971)\n\nWhat It Is: Just what its title suggests: The most straightforward RnR song that Led Zeppelin ever released.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: When things are going well — but not too well — late in the game.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Been a long time, been a long time/ Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.”\n\nListen here.\n\nBlack Box, \"Strike It Up\" (1991)\n\nWhat It Is: An early-’90s diva-house classic with a fantastic Martha Wash vocal (even though she was replaced with a skinnier model in the video) — though, remarkably, not even the highest early-’90s diva-house classic with a fantastic Martha Wash vocal (even though she was replaced with a skinnier model in the video) on our list.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: The first really important timeout of the game.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: That squawking intro synth, met with sporadic “Yeahhhhh” groans.\n\nBon Jovi, \"Livin' on a Prayer\" (1986)\n\nWhat It Is: The ultimate ’80s sing-along, in just about any context currently known to man.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Should be a halftime mainstay — for obvious lyrical reasons — but just too darn high-stakes to plausibly use that early in the contest.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Woahhhh we’re halfway there/ WOAHHH-OHHHH!/ LIVIN’ ON A PRAYER!”\n\nRob Base & DJ EZ-Rock, \"It Takes Two\" (1988)\n\nWhat It Is: The greatest single of all time, according to some.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: More Fan Cam madness.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Yeah. WOO! Yeah. WOO!“\n\nThe Experts Say: “‘It Takes Two,’ another great one that we love to play in the fourth quarter. It’s a great song that allows our dancers to dance to it, and our fans to dance alongside them.” — Anton Wright, Toronto Raptors/Maple Leafs Game Ops Director\n\nBill Conti, \"Gonna Fly Now\" (1976)\n\nWhat It Is: Pretty easily the greatest theme music to a (non-sequel) sports movie (Rocky) in history — and certainly the best theme song a main character could ask for.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: At any Philly sports even for the last 40 years, and a couple non-Philly sports events in cities lacking their own (fictional) paragon of hometown-kid toughness.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: The trumpet intro.\n\nC+C Music Factory, \"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)\" (1990)\n\nWhat It Is: Maybe the most instantly recognizable Jock Jam in history, putting it all out there in its first three words. (Also, the biggest/best of those actually-Martha-Wash diva house classics.)\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: The most critical fan-participation section of the game.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “EVERYBODY DANCE NOW!”\n\nThe Experts Say: “Any song that begins with a prompt/command is a winner.” — Poizon Ivy the DJ, Dallas Mavericks\n\nListen here.\n\nThe Baha Men, \"Who Let the Dogs Out?\" (2000)\n\nWhat It Is: For a brief moment in time, the sun that the rest of the Jock Jam universe revolved around — essential enough that the group actually recorded a new version of it to soundtrack the Mets’ ’00 World Series run.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: In 2017, you’d probably need a very specific retro night or some Dog Cam segment to get away with it. Give it another half-decade, though.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “WHOOO LET THE DOGS OUT?/ (Woof, Woof, Woof-Woof)“\n\nThe Experts Say: “One classic one for me that really dates [itself] — and I think I was one of the first people to play it — was ‘Who Let the Dogs Out…’ If I played ‘Who Let the Dogs Out,’ I would be kind of embarrassed. No offense, I’m sure Baja Men are great guys…” — Paul Kamras, Brooklyn Nets VP of Game Presentation\n\nMetallica, \"Enter Sandman\" (1991)\n\nWhat It Is: The song that proved the arena potential of classic metal, and which still probably haunts the dreams of Red Sox and Orioles fans.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Post-Mariano, you may not hear it as closer music again, but that opening build is still huge for leading into any particular high-stakes situation.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: That crunching opening riff.\n\nThe Experts Say: “It could be a kid in middle school knows ‘Enter Sandman.’ It could be your mom, your dad, your aunt, your uncle. Chances are your grandparents have somewhere crossed that song… And that universal recognizability I think is what makes it so accessible. Because it’s less about a genre. So it’s not that it’s heavy metal or it’s rock and roll, but it’s more about, everybody is familiar with it.” — Bill Wareham, Pittsburgh Penguins Director of Game Presentation\n\nBilly Idol, \"Mony Mony\" (1987)\n\nWhat It Is: A former punk’s sole Hot 100 No. 1 hit, which a whole lot of rowdy fans mutually decided would sound better with much dirtier call-and-response lyrics.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Keeping the energy going after a big play into a timeout.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “I said yeah… / (Yeah!)/ Yeah… / (Yeah!) / Yeah (Yeah!)/ Yeah (Yeah!)/ Yeah (Yeah!)…”\n\nThe Experts Say: “‘Mony Mony’ is a fantastic song for a mascot to just go to center court and play around, lead the fans in clapping, and every time there’s a ‘Hey!’ you can just point to the crowd and make them say ‘Hey!….’ it’s used for what we call hot timeouts. If the team’s on a run and all the fans are cheering, our job is to keep the fans up during the entire timeout.” — Cassidy Lien, Phoenix Suns Sr. Director of Game Presentation\n\nThe Ramones, \"Blitzkreig Bop\" (1976)\n\nWhat It Is: The song that essentially pioneered punk as we know it today, currently used to soundtrack more straight-laced manifestations of aggro energy.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Right before your team receives a big kickoff.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Hey/ Ho/ Let’s go!“\n\nThe Experts Say: “Your team needs a pick me up, well, bring this in at the chorus and the crowd will sing along.” — Craig Turney, Denver Broncos DJ\n\nNeil Diamond, \"Sweet Caroline\" (1969)\n\nWhat It Is: A song few would’ve predicted five decades ago would currently be an essential stitch in the fabric of American pro sports — thanks to the Boston Red Sox, and a whole lot of other fanbases too lazy to develop their own crowd-participation sing-alongs.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Coming out of the 7th-inning stretch.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Sweet Caroline/ (BA! BA BAAAAA!)/ Good times never seemed so good/ (SO GOOD! SO GOOD! SO GOOD!)”\n\nThe Experts Say: “‘Sweet Caroline’ is a big one that our fans love to sing for our Leafs team… it’s another song that instantly all your fans will join together and sing. It’s definitely one that kind of joins your fans together in a moment of pride.” — Anton Wright, Toronto Raptors/Maple Leafs Game Ops Director\n\nListen here.\n\nBlur, \"Song 2\" (1997)\n\nWhat It Is: Britpop greats Blur’s meatheaded send-up of American grunge — which, of course, became by far their most famous song in the States.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: After a goal, a touchdown, a home run — just about anything else worth loudly and obnoxiously celebrating, really.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “WOO-HOO!”\n\nThe Experts Say: “After a big stop, or huge momentum change, this classic song packs the punch that keeps the crowd energized.” — Laura Johnson, Senior Manager of Game Presentation and Live Events for the San Francisco 49ers\n\nListen here.\n\nDarude, \"Sandstorm\" (1999)\n\nWhat It Is: The turn-of-the-century Ringtone of the Gods, a violent trance whirlwind whose title seems barely sufficient.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Before the biggest rivalry game of the season kicks off.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: That five-alarm synth hook, the most inflammatory Finnish export since the Molotov cocktail.\n\nThe Experts Say: “This song is almost guaranteed to get people going after a big play.” — Sir Foster, Atlanta Hawks organist\n\nListen here.\n\nEurope, \"The Final Countdown\" (1986)\n\nWhat It Is: “Space Oddity” for the keytar generation, an interplanetary anthem still yet to be eclipsed in galaxy-hopscotching majesty three decades later.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: When the goalie’s been pulled and there’s 45 seconds remaining to score 6-on-5.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: The iconic synth riff, the Eurometal approximation of a Viking battering ram.\n\nListen here.\n\nThe Isley Brothers, \"Shout\" (1959)\n\nWhat It Is: A call-and-response soul classic, legally required to be played at any public gathering consisting of more than 10 people spanning more than 30 years in age.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: When you’re team’s up 40 in the fourth quarter and something‘s gotta fill the garbage time.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Now waiiiiiiiiiit a minute…./ You know you make me wanna (SHOUT!)”\n\nThe Experts Say: “There’s something about this song that makes it the best celebration song when you can feel the win is within your grasp. It almost seems like it is programmed inside all humans to put their hands in the air and say SHOUT! each and every time.” — Josh Sabo, Cleveland Cavaliers/Indians Music Coordinator\n\nListen here.\n\nAC/DC, \"Thunderstruck\" (1990)\n\nWhat It Is: A blistering finger-tapped riff matched with a rather foreboding weather forecast.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Drive within a 10-mile radius of Oklahoma City’s Chesapeake Energy Arena and your car automatically starts playing it.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “THUN-DER/ (Oh-ahh-oh-ahh, ahh-oh-ahhh-ahhh….)“\n\nThe Experts Say: “I get chills every time I play this. Never fails.” — Poizon Ivy the DJ, Dallas Mavericks\n\nListen here.\n\nTag Team, \"Whoomp! (There It Is)\" (1992)\n\nWhat It Is: Easily the best survivor of the classic Miami bass-derived ’90s hip-hop Jock Jams, though quick shout out to “Tootsee Roll” and “C’mon Ride It (The Train)” as well.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: After a go-ahead touchdown turns the entire building into party people.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “WHOOMP! (There it is!)”\n\nThe Experts Say: “[One of the only two songs] we use at our games is “Whoomp! There It Is…” We use it in 4th quarter hype situations.” — Johnny Watson, Milwaukee Bucks Director, Live Programming & Entertainment\n\nListen here.\n\nThe Alan Parsons Project, \"Sirius\" (1982)\n\nWhat It Is: A spectral prog-rock intro instrumental — play it long enough and it turns into ’80s rock smash “Eye in the Sky” — that became a permanent part of sports lore thanks to the Chicago Bulls in the ’90s.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Still probably the GOAT player introduction song.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: That twinkling intro riff, and the pounding piano chords that provide its exclamation mark.\n\nThe Experts Say: “I will never use the ‘Sirius’ song, just because it’s really synonymous with the Bulls. And the 1992-’93 team here went to the finals against the Bulls. Our intro video was ‘Sirius’ the entire time. It’s probably our most iconic intro video, with ‘Sirius,’ and we actually played the Bulls in the finals, so…” Cassidy Lien, Phoenix Suns Sr. Director of Game Presentation\n\nListen here.\n\nDJ Snake & Lil John, \"Turn Down for What\" (2013)\n\nWhat It Is: A trap/crunk hybrid (trunk?) banger that gleefully lowered the entire nation’s IQ about ten points on average for all 2014.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: When the game looks to be in hand, and your brain can take the rest of the day off.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “FIRE UP THAT LOUD, ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOTS…./ TURN DOWN FOR WHAT?“\n\nThe Experts Say: “I thought this one would get old after a while, but it still gets great reaction four years later. The anticipation builds to the drop and Lil Jon obviously tells everyone when to get crazy. Whenever you can get some natural hype from the artist in a song, it almost always sends the fans into a frenzy at the right moment.” — Josh Sabo, Cleveland Cavaliers/Indians Music Coordinator\n\nListen here.\n\nEminem, \"Lose Yourself\" (2002)\n\nWhat It Is: Eminem’s best argument for hip-hop as North America’s fifth major pro sport.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: When your team only has ONE SHOT left to win the damn thing.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: That partially muted, impossibly tense opening guitar riff.\n\nListen here.\n\n2 Unlimited, \"Get Ready for This\" (1991)\n\nWhat It Is: A song that cast a greater shadow over ’90s sports culture than anything besides Shaquille O’Neal.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Not nearly as often these days, but still occasionally deployed as a sign that it’s officially business time.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “Y’all ready for this?”\n\nThe Experts Say: “It’s an old Jock Jam — it’s not as used anymore, it was more in like the late ’90s. It was definitely a quintessential Jock Jam of its time.” — Cassidy Lien, Phoenix Suns Sr. Director of Game Presentation\n\nOzzy Osbourne, \"Crazy Train\" (1981)\n\nWhat It Is: An opening minute that even kids too young to remember The Osbournes know in their DNA; just ask the young’ns from that Honda commercial. (Bonus shout to Trick Daddy and Lil Jon for ensuring its continued 21st-century relevance.)\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Another coming-out-of-the-timeout classic.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: The opening “ALL ABOOOOOOOOOARD, HA HA HA HA…..” cackle, triggering one of rock’s fundamental bass hooks and guitar riffs.\n\nThe Experts Say: “Another staple in the event presentation industry. A classic that always gets the fans fired up.” — Laura Johnson, San Francisco 49ers Senior Manager of Game Presentation and Live Events\n\n“That’s a big one for the [penalty] box. That’s basically their song, is ‘Crazy Train.’” — Sean Bovelsky, Tampa Bay Lightning/Buccaneers Music Director\n\n“Hard to improve on a classic like ‘Crazy Train,’ but the ultimate hype man Lil Jon yelling ‘Let’s Go’ takes [that] track to the next level.” — Lauren Trusty, Washington Wizards Senior Director of Game Presentation\n\nHouse of Pain, \"Jump Around\" (1992)\n\nWhat It Is: A near-religious celebration of vertical movement, with an exploding shamrock of a sax screech.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: At jump balls, certainly, but during plenty of x-axis situations as well.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “JUMPAROUND! JUMPAROUND!/ JUMP UP JUMP AND GET DOWN!/ (JUMP! JUMP! JUMP!)“\n\nThe Experts Say: “I generally use this on kickoff after a huge touchdown that puts the game away or caps an amazing comeback. The opening blare of horns, coupled with the call to action totally gets the crowd jumping up and down.” — DJ EJ, Dallas Cowboys DJ\n\n“What can I say. This collegiate and professional sports staple not only whips the crowd into a frenzy, but it also gets the players pumped.” — Laura Johnson, San Francisco 49ers Senior Manager of Game Presentation and Live Events\n\n“You can play this at almost anytime of a game and get people jumping around and going nuts. Perfect after a big dunk going into a timeout or a touchdown.” — Josh Sabo, Cleveland Cavaliers/Indians Music Coordinator\n\nListen here.\n\nGary Glitter, 'Rock & Roll Part II' (1972)\n\nWhat It Is: An instrumental sequel that’s one of the two things glam rock icon Gary Glitter is best remembered for — and he certainly hopes it’s No. 1.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Killing time in the middle of long pitching changes.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: Eight guitar strums and one top-of-your lungs “HEY!”\n\nThe Experts Say: “A go-to anthem anytime your team goes on a big run. It never gets old!” — Sir Foster, Atlanta Hawks Organist\n\n“Continues to be one of the top go to songs for any great play celebration. Having 18,000 plus chanting ‘Hey’ in unison always takes the atmosphere to the next level.” — Dean Heaviland, Indiana Pacers Vice President Game Operations\n\n“When I first started, Gary Glitter, “Rock and Roll Part II” was THE No. 1 stadium anthem. But nobody really, at least in my experience I’ve talked to… a lot of people stay away from that song now.” — Sean Bovelsky, Tampa Bay Lightning/Buccaneers Music Director\n\nListen here.\n\nSurvivor, \"Eye of the Tiger\" (1982)\n\nWhat It Is: The song that they invented every training montage cliché to properly accompany, basically.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Before the second OT, when focus is in danger of starting to waver.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: That action packed guitar-and-bass intro.\n\nListen here.\n\nThe White Stripes, \"Seven Nation Army\" (2003)\n\nWhat It Is: The Jock Jam version of the Imperial March, creating 20,000 new Storm Troopers for the home team with every “DUHHH DUH DA DA DA DUHHHH DUHHHHH!” chant-along.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: When your team is really feeling itself.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: Don’t call it a bass riff — it’s “a semi-acoustic, 1950s-style Kay Hollowbody guitar [run] through a DigiTech Whammy pedal set down an octave,” duh.\n\nThe Experts Say: “As much as it seems overplayed, it still gets fans to chant every time. A lot of teams use it and some critical fans are sick of it, but when you need something to get people loud it’s hard not to use it.” — Josh Sabo, Cleveland Cavaliers/Indians Music Coordinator\n\n“‘Seven Nation Army’ has been our tip-off song for years. The crowd standing and jumping together for this song is a great way to get the energy going at gametime.” — Dean Heaviland, Indiana Pacers Vice President Game Operations\n\n“The Miami Heat use an intro video song, ‘Seven Nation Army,’ I won’t use that here. Although, we use a version of it for an intro video… but there’s just some teams that are synonymous with other teams that I try to stay away from.” — Cassidy Lien, Phoenix Suns Sr. Director of Game Presentation\n\nListen here.\n\nZombie Nation, \"Kernkraft 400\" (1999)\n\nWhat It Is: An undeaded Commodore 64 theme remix that turned into one of the most universally recognizable songs that nobody knows the name of or artist behind.\n\nWhen You’ll Hear It: Right before tip-off, kickoff, first pitch and the puck drop.\n\nThe Part You Definitely Know: “OH-OH-OH-OH-OH… OH-OH-OH-OH-OH-OH-OH-OH, OH-OH, OH-OH….”\n\nThe Experts Say: “Fans seem to really have fun with this song.
