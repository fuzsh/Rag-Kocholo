        "text": "Background\n\nOne combat sport with a rapidly growing international profile is MuayThai. The national sport of Thailand is increasing in popularity with fights regularly screened on satellite and terrestrial television channels. Although professional MuayThai is seen more as a spectator rather than a participation sport, amateur participation and competition is growing in popularity with an estimated one million participants worldwide (Gartland et al.,2001). More than sixty-nine countries from five continents sent teams to compete in the 2004 Amateur World Cup (IFMA, 2005) and a 100 counties are predicted to attend the 2006 amateur world championships (Tapsuwan, 2005).\n\nThe sport involves a style of boxing where competitors try to win bouts by scoring points, knockouts or stoppages using full contact blows. Legal techniques include a variety of punches, elbows, knees strikes, kicks and grappling techniques. Target areas for strikes include anywhere on the body except for deliberate strikes to the groin area. All bouts are held in an international style boxing ring with competitors using six, eight or ten ounce boxing gloves. Amateur competition has thirteen weight classes and the professional sport has eighteen (WMC, 1995). Professional fights involve five three-minute rounds punctuated by two-minute rest periods, while international level amateur bouts involve four two-minute rounds with one-minute rest periods. All bouts are controlled by a referee from inside the ring, and scored by three judges in professional fights, and up to five judges plus a jury panel in amateur competitions. While those competing at professional level wear limited protective equipment that includes boxing gloves, mouth guard and groin guard, those competing in amateur competition wear headguards, body protectors, elbow pads and shin-guards. In the amateur sport, competitors are identified by the colour of the protection, shorts and vests worn; these are coloured either blue or red depending on the corner the boxers are competing out of for a particular bout.\n\nThe professional sport is well established with a notable history; references to the activity dating back to the eleventh century and written records of formal competition dating back to the sixteenth century (Wongbandue, 1998). However, amateur MuayThai is a rather recent innovation being introduced with the formation of the Amateur MuayThai Association (AMTA) in 1990. The organisation of this body and its international arm, the International Federation of MuayThai Amateur (IFMA), led to MuayThai being included as a demonstration sport in the Asian games (Prowsree, 2000).\n\nMuayThai judging\n\nJudges in MuayThai have to make similar types of decisions to those made in professional boxing. However, there are differences, particularly in the professional sport. In MuayThai, judges have to consider several factors to decide who wins a fight. Firstly, judges have to make a comparison of the number of legal blows each contestant lands on legitimate targets and decide who landed the greater number of blows (Boxing Board of Sport, 2002). Secondly, judges need to decide on the relative power of attacks hitting their target (Boxing Board of Sport, 2002). Along with the number of blows landing, the perceived strength of blows is also considered in deciding the winner of a fight.\n\nThe amateur sport uses a '20 point must system' this requires a judge to award 20 points to the competitor they consider to have won the round and a lower score (usually 19 points) to the loser. At the end of four rounds, each judge totals their scorecard to decide the winner. If the points they awarded are equal, judges award the decision the fighter who they feel has tried to attack the most. If this is similar, judges are directed to award a win to the boxer who they feel has displayed the best style or has shown the best defence (IFMA, und).\n\nThe professional sport uses a 'ten point must system' similar in principle to the amateur system: the winner of the round is awarded 10 points and the loser awarded less; usually 9 points. However, unlike amateur MuayThai, professional fights in Thailand are judged as a whole with individual rounds not having equal emphasis. This allows judges to make a retrospective assessment of the effect of cumulative blows over the early rounds. Emphasis is given to a fighter finishing the strongest over the last three rounds (Myers, 2005).\n\nWith fights judged as a whole rather than in equal round units, when there is a clear difference between fighters the fight is usually scored 49:47. Closer fights are scored 49:48. It is usual for professional judges in Thailand to make notes during a fight and complete the scoring for rounds after the fight has finished. However, this is impossible in championship bouts where scorecards are collected after each round. It is also usual in Thailand for a judge to avoid awarding a total score of 50 points for a boxer; the maximum score for a fight usually being 49 points (although it is possible for a fighter to score 50). This adjustment is to give credit to a boxer who tries to fight, but has not managed to win.\n\nBias in judging\n\nNo published studies have been conducted specifically on MuayThai judging and evidence of any problems with judging bias is purely anecdotal. However, there is enough evidence from other subjectively judged sports to suggest that similar problems could surface in international competition. Subjective sports in major international competitions such as the Olympic Games have not escaped judging controversies with many of these the result of nationalistic bias. Several major judging biases have been established empirically in subjectively judged sports (Vanden Auweele et al., 2004). Bias has been identified in combat other sports. Balmer et al., 2005 found evidence of bias in European championship boxing, where a home advantage was evident. The authors found that a 'home' boxer tends to be awarded closely fought rounds more often than the 'away' boxer. While some types of bias are not obvious across all sports, the 'patriotism effect' is evident across a wide range of sports in the form of nationalistic bias. Nationalistic bias, has been identified in figure skating (Campbell and Galbraith, 1996; Seltzer and Glass, 1991; Whissell et al., 1993), gymnastics (Ansorge and Scheer, 1988; Ste Marie, 1996), ski jumping (Zitzewitz, 2002) and rhythmic gymnastics (Popovic, 2000). These sports require judges to make subjective decisions to decide outcome similar to MuayThai.\n\nHaving identified bias, subjectively judged sports have adopted different approaches to adjusting scoring to avoid or lessen problems of nationalistic bias. Some of these approaches have been statistical approaches, others technological. For example, several proposals were made to try to reduce bias in ice-skating. These included: increasing the number of judges from 9 to 14; using median scores to rank skaters; and using trimmed means to try to control the influence of extreme scores on overall position (Zitzewitz, 2002). On the other hand, two combat sports, Taekwondo and amateur boxing, opted for solutions that involve technology.\n\nIn 1990, after serious problems with judging at the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988 (Maese, 2004), the Association Internationale de Box (AIBA) made electronic scoring (the Chowdhry Scoring System) compulsory for international competitions (AIBA, 2003). This system requires each of the five judges at ringside to use a keyboard with 4 buttons: red and blue 'point keys' for recording scoring blows, and red and blue 'W keys' for recording warnings. When a judge sees a scoring blow they press a button and computer software records the point awarded and opens a one-second window giving time for other judges to confirm the score. If three or more judges press the same key within that second, the score is “accepted ”for that boxer and recorded. Bouts are awarded to the boxer who has the highest total of blows (AIBA, 2003).\n\nTaekwondo, another Olympic combat sport that involves kicking as well as punching, also decided to use technology in a campaign to improve its reputation after judging problems. The World Taekwondo Federation commissioned electronic protective equipment that registers a score when contact is made. When electronic scoring is used, the electronic body armour automatically records body blows. Head blows are recorded by two judges using an electronic scoring instrument similar to the one used in amateur boxing. One point is awarded for attack on trunk protector, two points for attack on face and an extra point awarded if the contestant is knocked down and receives a count from the referee (WTF, 2005). Along with electronic scoring, the rules of Taekwondo make a specific reference to avoiding using any officials with the same nationality as either of the competitors being assigned to a contest. However, an exception is made when there are not enough referees or judges to make this possible (WTF, 2005).\n\nGiven that Olympic recognition is a major goal for MuayThai's international development (Tapsuwan, 2005), an investigation into judging would contribute to the sport's credibility. This is particularly pertinent given the major changes made to scoring in Olympic combat sports. The purpose of this study was to determine the level of nationalistic bias in international MuayThai judging and to explore possible strategies to reduce bias. It was hypothesised that evidence of nationalistic bias will be observed.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nWe examined nationalistic bias at the level of individual judges scores for each bout.. As a given bout could have non-neutral judges sharing nationality with either boxer, judges were categorised as red (sharing nationality with the red corner boxer), blue (sharing nationality with the blue corner boxer) or neutral (sharing nationality with neither boxer). Scores for each judge in each bout were summed for each of the four rounds, where minus values were assigned to scores in favour of the boxer competing out of the blue corner and positive values assigned to scores in favour of boxers competing out of the red corner boxer. For example, if a judge had a boxer from the red corner winning three rounds and losing one, this would result in a score of +2. Conversely, if a judge scored a boxer fighting out of the blue corner all four rounds, this would result in a score of -4. In total, the dataset was made up of 2,028 difference scores over the 70 bouts. Of these 70 bouts, only the 43 with at least one judge sharing nationality with at least one of the competitors were used in this analysis.\n\nThese data were analysed using a multilevel model, with judges scores fitted as a normal response variable. Further details of this type of model can be found in Goldstein, 2003. In the current study, we fit a simple two level model with scores nested within bouts, and bout included as a random effect. Importantly, this controls for what are likely to be highly variable differences between boxer's abilities, acknowledging that judges scores are more likely to be similar within than between bouts. This type of approach is common where observations are clustered within groups (for example pupils within schools, or people within households) and these observations are likely to be affected by these clusters, which is certainly likely to be the case in the current study. Accounting for such clustering avoids tests that are often too liberal for level-2 (bout level) covariates and typically result in falsely rejecting the null hypothesis too often (Gibbons & Hedeker, 1997). The model had a single categorical predictor with three categories 'red' (judge shared nationality with the red corner boxer), 'blue' (judge shared nationality with the blue corner boxer) or 'neutral' (judged shared nationality with neither boxer).\n\nSecond, we examined the impact of any observed bias on the overall outcome of all bouts in the Almaty tournament and discuss control of nationalistic bias.\n\nIt is hypothesised that nationalistic bias is observed, although the overall is likely to be dictated by the ratio of the neutral to same nationality judges.\n\nNationalistic bias - judges scores within bouts\n\nOf 70 bouts at the Almaty tournament, 43 (61.4%) had at least one non-neutral judge. shows output from the multilevel model of judge's scores on the basis of whether or not they shared nationality with one of the boxers. Note, that negative scores indicate judging in favour of boxers competing out of the blue corner and positive scores indicate judging in favour of boxers competing out of the red corner (see analysis section). The model also includes a random bout parameter, again, as discussed in the 'analysis' section.\n\nTable 1.\n\nParameterEstimate (standard error)Fixed Intercept-.30 (.47) Shared nationality with blue corner boxer- Neutral nationality.64 (.35) Shared nationality with red corner boxer1.09 (.50)Random Between bouts variance4.95 (1.20) Between scores variance4.21 (.37)-2 * log likelihood1409.88\n\nFirstly, the intercept value of -0.30 suggested that on average, judges sharing nationality with blue corner boxers (our reference category) scored these boxers around a third of a round better than boxers competing out of the red corner on average over the course of a bout. Of more interest though, is how scores changed with judge's nationality. Secondly, neutral judges typically scored boxers competing out of the red corner two- thirds of a round (0.64) better than judges sharing nationality with boxers competing out of the blue corner over the course of a bout. Thirdly, judges sharing nationality with boxers competing out of the red corner typically scored such boxers over a round better than judges sharing nationality with boxers competing out of the blue corner over the course of a bout, a statistically significant difference. The equation below provides a simple summary of the model;\n\nJudges score = -0.30 + 0.64 'neutral' + 1.09 'red'\n\nSo a judge who shared nationality with a boxer competing out of the blue corner typically scored 0.3 rounds in favour of those boxers, a 'neutral' judge, who didn't share nationality with either boxer typically scored 0.34 rounds in favour of boxers competing from the red corner (suggesting boxers competing from the red corner were marginally superior overall) and a judge sharing nationality with the boxer in the red corner typically scored 0.74 rounds in favour of boxers competing out of that corner.\n\nNationalistic bias and bout outcome\n\nDespite evidence of nationalistic bias, this does not guarantee that that the outcome of bouts will change. A simple, logical solution to the issue would be to simply remove non-neutral judges. This also allows examination of the impact of bias at bout level. summarises the outcome of the 43 bouts with at least one non-neutral judge; using all scores for bouts but removing the scores awarded by judges who shared nationality with boxers competing out of the red or blue corners and using only neutral judges.\n\nTable 2.\n\nBlue boxer winsDrawRed boxer winsUsing all judges scores19123‘Red’ judges removed19123‘Blue’ judges removed18025Neutral judges only18025\n\nshows only modest changes in outcome when removing non-neutral judges. Effectively, two bouts would change in outcome; one moving from a draw to the red corner boxer winning and one blue corner win moving to a red corner win. Essentially, non-neutral judges decisions impacted on the outcome of two of forty-three bouts where they were present, or two of seventy bouts in the entire Almaty tournament.\n\nHowever, that is not to say that nationalistic bias does not have the potential to impact more severely on outcome. examines the seventeen bouts with both red and blue judges and shows large differences.\n\nTable 3.\n\nBlue boxer winsDrawRed boxer winsNeutral only/all scores7010Red judges only4211Blue judges only1115\n\nThe fact that the scores of judges who share nationality with boxers competing from the red and blue corners do not impact on the outcome is not a case of their scores balancing each other out (removing judges who share nationality with either red or blue boxers still results in 7 blue and 10 red corner wins), but is simply a consequence of same nationality judges not having enough judges (essentially a majority would be required if neutral judges are fairly consistent) for their scores to have real impact. Bias is clearly present, though same nationality judges' minority status reduces the impact of this bias. Moreover the natural control exerted by relatively large numbers of judges in the Almaty tournament also reduces the impact of unusual neutral judge scores, which could in turn potentially allow same nationality judges to have a greater influence."
