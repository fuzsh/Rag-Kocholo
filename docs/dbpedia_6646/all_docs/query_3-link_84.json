        "text": "Ubisoft's boxing game lets players rewrite the Rocky Saga, punch by punch. Turn back the clock and come out swinging in this bone-crunching prequel to the Rocky movie saga. Play as Rocky Balboa, Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, or Ivan Drago before the events of the Rocky films, and re-create their hard-fought quests to become boxing legends. Train like a mad dog and build up your skills in eight punishing training modes unique to each boxer -- or train against a friend in Versus mode. Enter the proving grounds and throw down at 25 venues through Philly, New York, Vegas, Moscow, and other memorable locales from the Rocky saga. All in all, there are eight authentic training games, 40 different opponents (including 26 new boxers), and 13 all-new venus not seen in the previous game.\n\nRocky Legends\n\nWhen Ubisoft's Rocky released in late 2002, it paid fitting tribute to the classic motion picture series.
