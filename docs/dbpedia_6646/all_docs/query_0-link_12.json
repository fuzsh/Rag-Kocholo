        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe sport of boxing is the art of attack and defense with the fists. Some people feel that boxing is a violent and dangerous sport and that it should be abolished. It has, however, endured in one form or another since ancient times and continues to have an enthusiastic following.\n\nBoxing matches take place in a ring. It is a square platform (often called the squared circle), padded and covered with canvas. The ring, which is from 16 to 20 feet square in professional contests and from 12 to 20 feet square in amateur contests, is closed in by multiple lengths of rope that are attached to posts in each corner. Each fighter has his own corner, diagonally across from his opponent’s. The other two corners are neutral.\n\nMost of the regulations that govern boxing today are based on rules drawn up about 1867 under the sponsorship of John Sholto Douglas, the ninth marquess of Queensberry, an English patron of the sport. These rules require bouts to be divided into three-minute periods, or rounds, with one minute of rest between. Amateur bouts usually consist of 3 rounds, and the boxers wear protective headgear. Professional bouts, in which the boxers do not wear headgear, vary from 4 rounds on up, with 12 rounds the maximum for championship fights. Padded gloves, ranging from 8 to 10 ounces (227 to 283 grams) in weight, are worn by the boxers.\n\nTo make contests fair, boxers are classified and matched according to their weights. There were traditionally eight weight divisions in men’s boxing. More divisions were added until professional governing bodies now recognize a total of 17 weight classes, which had their current names established by the major boxing organizations in 2015. The upper weight limits of these classes are as follows: minimumweight, 105 pounds (48 kilograms); light flyweight, 108 pounds (49 kilograms); flyweight, 112 pounds (51 kilograms); super flyweight, 115 pounds (52 kilograms); bantamweight, 118 pounds (53.5 kilograms); super bantamweight, 122 pounds (55 kilograms); featherweight, 126 pounds (57 kilograms); super featherweight, 130 pounds (59 kilograms); lightweight, 135 pounds (61 kilograms); super lightweight, 140 pounds (63.5 kilograms); welterweight, 147 pounds (67 kilograms); super welterweight, 154 pounds (70 kilograms); middleweight, 160 pounds (72.5 kilograms); super middleweight, 168 pounds (76 kilograms); light heavyweight, 175 pounds (79 kilograms); cruiserweight, 200 pounds (91 kilograms); heavyweight, unlimited.\n\nIn Olympic-style amateur boxing the weight divisions for men are: light flyweight, not more than 108 pounds (49 kilograms); flyweight, 115 pounds (52 kilograms); bantamweight, 123 pounds (56 kilograms); lightweight, 132 pounds (60 kilograms); light welterweight, 141 pounds (64 kilograms); welterweight, 152 pounds (69 kilograms); middleweight, 165 pounds (75 kilograms); light heavyweight, 178 pounds (81 kilograms); heavyweight, 201 pounds (91 kilograms); super heavyweight, any weight over 201 pounds (91 kilograms).\n\nThere is no universal agreement on weight divisions within women’s professional boxing. Women’s Olympic boxing is currently restricted to just three weight classes: flyweight, 106 to 112 pounds (48 to 51 kilograms); lightweight, 123 to 132 pounds (56 to 60 kilograms); middleweight, 152 to 165 pounds (69 to 75 kilograms).\n\nBoxing rules require both fighters to engage in a “fair, stand-up” match with no wrestling or gouging. All blows must be struck with the gloved fists, and hitting below the belt, on the back of the head, on the neck, or on the kidneys is forbidden. A fighter who breaks these rules is guilty of a foul and may be punished with the loss of the round or disqualified.\n\nIf a fighter falls or is knocked down, he must get to his feet within 10 seconds. The referee counts seconds aloud as long as the fighter remains down. Some states require a boxer to take a count of eight if he has been knocked down. If the referee reaches the number 10, he declares a knockout (KO). Sometimes a fighter is hopelessly beaten without being counted out. The referee then awards the bout to his opponent on a technical knockout (TKO).\n\nThe bout is decided on points if neither contestant has suffered a knockout or a technical knockout or has been disqualified by a foul. Points are scored for the number of blows landed, for a clever defense, and for aggressiveness. The decision is usually rendered by a majority vote of the referee and two boxing judges on the basis of total points scored.\n\nThe Technique of Boxing\n\nRight-handed boxers usually fight from an orthodox stance. This means putting the left foot slightly ahead of the right with both feet spread apart and the weight of the body evenly distributed on both. This position enables the boxer to move quickly in any direction. The left arm is partly extended to the front. The right arm is held close to the body to guard the stomach and jaw. Left-handed boxers stand with the right foot and right arm forward. The chief points of attack are the tip of the jaw, the spot just below the ear, and the midsection of the body. A solid punch delivered to one of these points often results in a knockout.\n\nA good offense is usually built around the four recognized classes of punches—jab, straight blow, hook or cross, and uppercut. The jab is a sharp, light punch delivered by straightening out the bent arm. The jab can be used effectively to harass an opponent and to keep him off-balance. A straight punch may carry the weight of the body behind it and will result in a knockout if it is landed in a vital spot.\n\nThe hook or cross, either left or right, is a swinging blow, aimed to slip by the opponent’s guard. The uppercut is a blow directed upward, usually aimed at the jaw or the midsection. When delivered with full power either punch can be a knockout blow.\n\nThe defense may also may be built around several basic maneuvers. Blocking is parrying with the glove, forearm, elbow, or shoulder to deflect the opponent’s punches. Slipping, which depends upon fast footwork, consists of stepping aside and making the rival miss. Another trick is to roll with the punch—that is, to soften the effect of a blow by moving in the direction it is aimed. Ducking is bobbing down so that the blow goes over the head. Clinching, when done legally, ties up the opponent’s arms and gives the boxer an opportunity to rest.\n\nOther maneuvers, offensive and defensive, are also useful to a boxer. Feinting is bluffing with one hand preparatory to delivering a blow with the other. Leading is opening an attack, usually with a left jab. Countering is throwing a hard punch at the opponent at the exact moment he leads off.\n\nThe History of Boxing\n\nBoxing played an important part in the holiday celebrations of ancient Greece and Rome. Boxers wrapped each fist in a leather thong (called a cestus when studded with bits of metal or metal spikes). Many bouts ended only when one fighter killed his opponent. Just before the Christian Era a Roman emperor banned all types of fighting with the fists. Boxing, as a sport, then disappeared from history until it was revived in England in the 1700s.\n\nThe first man to popularize boxing with bare knuckles was James Figg of England. Between 1719 and 1730 he defeated all challengers and was acclaimed the first boxing champion. The contestants battled without rest until one had definitely won. In 1745 Jack Broughton devised the London Prize Ring rules (amended as the Revised London Prize Ring rules). These governed all succeeding bare-knuckle fights.\n\nUnder the London Prize Ring rules, bouts were divided into rounds that ended only when one of the boxers fell or was knocked to the ground. If the fallen man was unable to resume the contest in 30 seconds the referee awarded the bout to his opponent. The referee, however, had no power to stop the boxers from kicking, wrestling, or gouging, and these maneuvers usually played an important part in every fight. Most matches lasted until one of the contestants was badly beaten.\n\nIn an effort to improve the sport, the marquess of Queensberry framed the set of rules which still bears his name. The new regulations, first used in England about 1872, soon replaced the old rules in all bouts. Besides calling for the wearing of padded gloves, the Queensberry rules forbade wrestling holds, required a fallen man to be given a free count of 10 to recover, and established the three-minute round with a one-minute rest period. During this time, the introduction of the first weight divisions in boxing also took place.\n\nBoxing in the United States\n\nThe first boxing matches in the United States were bare-knuckle bouts fought under the London Prize Ring rules. Such bouts were illegal, and the battles usually took place in isolated spots away from the police. The matches drew only small crowds, however, for the rough-and-tumble tactics of the bare-knuckle fighters found little favor with the public.\n\nThe man who greatly improved the standing of the sport was American professional boxer John L. Sullivan, whose name has become legendary in boxing history. In 1882 he defeated Paddy Ryan to win the undisputed bare-knuckle championship of the world. Sullivan then temporarily abandoned bare-knuckle fighting and toured the country fighting all challengers under the Queensberry rules. Spectators welcomed these well-regulated matches fought with gloves, and the sport rose in popularity. Sullivan also defended his bare-knuckle crown several times, but after 1889 there were no contenders for the London Prize Ring title. Sullivan never lost a bare-knuckle bout.\n\nEarly World Boxing Champions\n\nIn 1892 at New Orleans, Louisiana, Sullivan fought James J. (“Gentleman Jim”) Corbett for the world’s heavyweight championship under the Queensberry rules. Corbett’s footwork and boxing skill proved superior to Sullivan’s, and in the 21st round he won on a knockout. Five years later Corbett lost the title to Bob Fitzsimmons, who featured a “solar plexus” punch. Fitzsimmons, a former middleweight champion, was knocked out in 1899 by James J. Jeffries in his first defense of the title.\n\nJeffries retired in 1905. The following year Tommy Burns (real name, Noah Brusso) claimed the championship on a 20-round decision over Marvin Hart. In 1908 at Sydney, Australia, Burns lost the title to Jack Johnson, the first Black heavyweight titleholder. Until his fight with Burns, racial discrimination had limited Johnson’s opportunities and purses. When he became champion, a hue and cry for a “Great White Hope” produced numerous opponents. Eventually Jeffries, the former champion, was induced to come out of retirement in 1910 to fight Johnson at Reno, Nevada. Their bout was billed as the “Fight of the Century.” Jeffries had never been defeated in a professional bout, but he was no match for Johnson and was knocked out in the 15th round. Johnson went on to defeat all challengers until, in 1915, at Havana, Cuba, he was defeated by Jess Willard, a powerful ex-cowboy who stood 6 feet 7 inches and weighed over 250 pounds.\n\nIn 1919 George (“Tex”) Rickard became boxing promoter for Madison Square Garden in New York City, and under his direction boxing reached its first great popularity. One of his promotions was a championship fight between Willard and Jack Dempsey at Toledo, Ohio, in 1919. Willard was a heavy favorite to win, but Dempsey slipped through his guard and knocked him down seven times in the first three minutes. Willard lasted only three rounds.\n\nIn 1921 Dempsey defeated Georges Carpentier of France in four rounds, and two years later he knocked out Luis Angel Firpo of Argentina in the second round. The Dempsey-Carpentier bout was the first in ring history with a million-dollar gate.\n\nIn 1926 Dempsey lost the title on a 10-round decision to Gene Tunney, a cool scientific puncher who was a master of defensive tactics. The following year in a return match in Chicago, Illinois, Dempsey knocked Tunney down in the 7th round for a count of 9. Many spectators thought that the count actually could have reached 14, but Dempsey did not move immediately to a neutral corner as provided by the rules. The referee refused to declare a knockout, and Tunney rallied to retain his crown on a 10-round decision.\n\nTunney defended his title once more and then in 1928 retired. In 1930 Jack Sharkey of Boston, Massachusetts, and Max Schmeling of Germany were matched for the title. The German won on a foul and was “elected” champion despite considerable protest. Sharkey won a return bout in 1932, but he lost the crown in 1933, in his first defense, to Primo Carnera of Italy. Carnera—at 260 pounds the heaviest of all world champions—lost to Max Baer a year later; the fight was stopped in the 11th round after the champion had been knocked down 12 times. In 1935 James J. Braddock defeated Baer.\n\nJoe Louis, a former Golden Gloves fighter, built a string of 27 victories before he was defeated by Max Schmeling in 1936. In 1937, however, Louis knocked out Braddock to become the second Black heavyweight champion. The following year Louis avenged his loss to Schmeling, defeating the German boxer in the first round of what was perhaps Louis’s most famous bout. Louis held the title longer than any other heavyweight, successfully defending his title 25 times (21 by knockout) before retiring in 1949.\n\nAmong boxers in the lower weight divisions, several became great champions during the decades preceding World War II. Benny Leonard, world lightweight champion from 1917 to 1925, is regarded as one of the cleverest defensive boxers in the history of the sport. Harry Greb, who usually fought as a middleweight, won the U.S. light heavyweight title in 1922, giving Gene Tunney the only defeat of his career. Greb held the world middleweight title from 1923 to 1926. In 1937–38 Henry Armstrong was the first boxer to hold three titles at the same time (featherweight, lightweight, and welterweight).\n\nThe Modern Era\n\nAfter World War II television took on an increasingly important role in professional boxing. Because of its popularity and relatively low production costs compared with other sports, professional boxing became a regular feature of network programming throughout much of the 1950s and early ’60s. Among the fighters to reach prominence during these years was Rocky Marciano, who gained the world heavyweight title in 1952 by knocking out Jersey Joe Walcott. In one of the fastest heavyweight title bouts ever fought—in 2:25 of the first round—Marciano again knocked out Walcott in 1953. When he retired in 1956, Marciano had won all 49 of his professional bouts.\n\nSugar Ray Robinson became the first five-time world middleweight champion in 1958. In 201 professional bouts, he recorded 109 knockouts. He suffered only 19 defeats, most of them when he was past the age of 40. His outstanding ability and flamboyant personality made him a hero of boxing fans throughout the world, and he is sometimes considered the best fighter in history.\n\nFloyd Patterson won the vacant world heavyweight title in 1956 when he knocked out Archie Moore. Patterson lost to Ingemar Johansson of Sweden in 1959. In 1960 Patterson won a rematch with Johansson and became the first defeated heavyweight champion ever to regain his crown. In 1962 Patterson was knocked out by Sonny Liston. In 1964 Liston lost the title to Cassius Clay (later known as Muhammad Ali), whose crown was withdrawn in 1967 because he refused to be drafted into the U.S. armed forces. After a round of elimination bouts Jimmy Ellis became heavyweight champion in 1968 but lost to Joe Frazier in 1970. Dispute still clouded the championship title until Frazier’s defeat of Ali in 1971. In 1974, 10 years after he first won the title, Ali regained it by knocking out George Foreman. Ali was then the only undisputed champion in boxing’s 12 weight divisions.\n\nAli lost the championship crown to Leon Spinks in February 1978 but in September of that year regained it, becoming the first fighter to win the world heavyweight championship on three separate occasions. Ali retired in 1979, having lost only three of 59 fights; he came out of retirement in 1980 but lost to champion Larry Holmes. Ali retired for good following a loss to Trevor Berbick in 1981.\n\nThe widespread popularity of Muhammad Ali, as well as the advent of cable television in the United States, helped to increase boxing’s presence on television. Television also greatly increased boxing revenues, particularly events broadcast via closed-circuit television and, later, pay-for-view events on cable. Million-dollar purses for heavyweight championships were commonplace by the 1970s, and Ali was estimated to have earned some $69 million during his 20-year professional career. By the 1980s multimillion-dollar purses were no longer restricted to the heavyweight division. When middleweights Sugar Ray Leonard and Marvin Hagler fought on April 6, 1987, they shared a purse estimated at $30 million. Though Hagler had been heavily favored to win that bout, Leonard earned a split-decision victory.\n\nIn 1985 Michael Spinks became the first light heavyweight champion to win the heavyweight crown when he defeated Holmes. (Spinks was the brother of former heavyweight titlist Leon Spinks.) In 1987 Mike Tyson became, at age 20, the youngest heavyweight champion in history. He defended the title against Holmes, Spinks, and eight others before losing in an upset to James (“Buster”) Douglas in 1990. In 1997 Tyson lost his boxing license after a match in which he bit the ear of his opponent, Evander Holyfield. Tyson later regained his license and returned to the ring, but in a highly publicized 2002 title bout between Tyson and heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, Lewis knocked Tyson out in the eighth round.\n\nLewis, the first British boxer to hold the undisputed heavyweight world championship since Bob Fitzsimmons, retired in 2004 with a record of 41 wins (32 by knockout), 2 losses, and 1 draw. Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko, a pair of Germany-based Ukrainian brothers, subsequently emerged as the major forces among the world’s heavyweights, holding between them virtually every professional title in the division by 2011; the Klitschkos’ refusal to fight each other, however, made it difficult to ascertain which brother was the best heavyweight of the era. Public attention, meanwhile, was increasingly focused on the extraordinary achievements of a number of boxers in the lower weight divisions. Bernard Hopkins dominated the middleweight division in the early 2000s, making a division-record 20 successful title defenses before moving up to light heavyweight. With his May 2011 victory over Jean Pascal to capture the World Boxing Council light heavyweight title, Hopkins, at age 46, became the oldest world champion in boxing history. Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao set a record by winning world championships in seven different weight classes by 2009 and was widely considered to be one of the top pound-for-pound fighters in the world. Also regarded as one of the best pound-for-pound fighters of the era was Floyd Mayweather, Jr., who captured world titles in five weight divisions. A long-anticipated showdown between Mayweather and Pacquiao was held on May 2, 2015, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mayweather was the more accurate puncher in the fight and also displayed superb defensive skills on his way to defeating Pacquiao by unanimous decision."
