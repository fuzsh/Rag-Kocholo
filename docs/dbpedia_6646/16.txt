History

In Mexico, the game was re-branded and sponsored by Julio César Chávez, creating Chavez II (the original Chavez having received similar treatment on the Super Nintendo, formerly being known as Riddick Bowe Boxing). Chavez II is thought to have been the only Mexican-exclusive game released for any Sega console in the entirety of Sega's home console endeavours - it is largely the same game as Boxing Legends of The Ring, though omits some sound effects and has been translated into Spanish.
