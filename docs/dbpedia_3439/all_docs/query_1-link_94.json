        "text": "Hamas new leader\n\nThe Palestinian resistance movement Hamas says selecting Yahya Sinwar as its political bureau chief sends a message to the Israeli regime that the movement stands united behind its leadership. Senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, said choosing Sinwar also proves that the assassination of the movement's leaders will not throw it into chaos. He said Sinwar has always been a partner in the Gaza ceasefire talks, and his selection proves that Hamas stands firm on its principles. Hamdan said the speedy selection of Sinwar also demonstrates the movement's vitality. The Hezbollah resistance movement congratulated Hamas on selecting Sinwar as its new leader, saying it proves that Israel has failed to achieve its goals through killing the resistance leaders. Various Palestinian resistance movements have also felicitated Hamas on the selection of its new political bureau chief.\n\nIran response to Israel\n\nIran’s acting Foreign minister, Ali Bagheri, says Israel is the root cause of instability and insecurity in West Asia. Ali Bagheri made the remark in a phone call with his Egyptian counterpart, Badr Abdellatti. He stressed Iran would give a decisive response to the regime’s recent assassination of top Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. For his part, Badr Abdellati, said Egypt had warned the western countries about Israel’s provocative and dangerous moves, expressing hope for a reduction in regional tensions. Bagheri also held a separate phone conversation with his Austrian counterpart, Alexander Schallenberg. He condemned the European countries’ silence over what he called Israel’s terrorist actions and violations of international law. He said such passivity has emboldened the regime to foment and escalate regional tensions. For his part, the Austrian foreign minister called for restraint and stressed the importance of deploying all diplomatic means to reduce regional tensions.\n\nUS-Israeli genocide in Gaza\n\nMore Palestinians are falling victim to the US-Israeli genocide in Gaza as the occupation forces continue to pound the blockaded territory with more air and artillery strikes. At least two civilians were killed and nearly 20 others injured in an Israeli bombing of a house in Gaza City. In the southern city of Khan Yunis, four civilians were killed when their tent came under attack. Here a Palestinian journalist was also killed in an Israeli air raid, increasing the number of media workers killed since last October to 166. Schools and other public places are not exempted from the attacks. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says three schools sheltering internally displaced people have been hit in the past two days, resulting in mass casualties. So far, nearly 40,000 people have been killed and over 91,000 others injured since the onset of the war."
