        "text": "The second instalment of Irvine Welsh's Crime is set to hit our screens tonight (Wednesday, August 7), featuring detective Ray Lennox as he grapples with crime and his personal demons. Originally premiered on the streaming platform ITVX, Dougray Scott will be reprising his role as the tormented Detective Ray Lennox.\n\nBased on a novel by Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh, the second series on ITV 1 will see Ray back in action at Edinburgh Serious Crimes, eager to demonstrate that he has fully recovered from his breakdown triggered by bringing Mr Confectioner to justice.\n\nHowever, much has changed - Bob Toal has lost his spark, while Amanda Drummond has been newly promoted. The team also welcomes two new members, the cunning Tommy Stark and unsuccessful actor Norrie Erskine.\n\nAlongside Dougray, Joanna Vanderham and Ken Stott are returning, while Rebecca Root and Gabriel Scott are joining the star-studded cast. But who exactly stars in the second series of Crime, how can you tune in, and how many episodes are there?\n\nHere's all the information you need.\n\nWhat's the storyline for Crime series 2?\n\nAccording to ITV, the plot of Crime goes as follows: \"When one of Lennox's former colleagues is attacked, Lennox and Drummond quickly realise that not everything is as it appears, as they find themselves entangled in a case about vengeance, identity, and social justice.\"\n\n\"The attack is linked to a gruesome attempted murder of a high-ranking establishment figure at a posh hotel, which has been hushed up by the police. As Lennox investigates via Edinburgh's saunas, crack dens, and poshest hotels, he finds doors slammed in his face; there is an Establishment cover-up at play.\"\n\n\"It's not until the killer targets one of Lennox's team that the pieces start to fall into place. Tracing the motivation back to an unsavoury incident 30 years ago, Lennox begins to realize that there is more to this case than meets the eye, and the killer he has been chasing may not be the driving force behind these murders after all.\"\n\nWho stars in Crime series 2?\n\nThe full cast list for the ITV series is as follows:\n\nDougray Scott as DI Ray Lennox\n\nJoanna Vanderham as DS Amanda Drummond\n\nKen Stott as CS Bob Toal\n\nJohn Simm as Gareth Horsborough\n\nDerek Riddell as Richie Gulliver\n\nGabriel Scott as Fraser\n\nRebecca Root as Lauren Fairchild\n\nDylan Blore as Victor Maslo\n\nMoyo Akande as Maria Pearson\n\nLaura Fraser as Sally Hart\n\nRob Black as Scott Durie\n\nHow many episodes are in Crime series 2?\n\nLike its predecessor, the second series will also consist of six hour-long episodes. These episodes will air weekly on ITV1 but you can binge watch the series in full or at your own pace on ITVX.\n\nThe first series is available to watch on the same streaming platform."
