Joe Hayes, Francie Donnellan, Joe Bane and Bill Malley. And there was plenty of musical guidance and inheritance from her parents who were both from musical families.

O’Jizo perform -- with serene gleefulness -- the cutting edge of a new Celtic sound. Their warm personalities shine through on stage, and they enjoy meeting audience members one-on-one after a performance. Their path to Irish music began in childhood, with the magic of Tokyo Disneyland and Hollywood movies which introduced the band members to American music. Later, after advanced studies in ethnomusicology, and experimenting with classical and traditional music from around the world, the band members met each other and chose Irish music as their favourite. It was the natural choice because the music felt familiar and comfortable -- and is the root of many of the American music styles they were drawn to in their youth. With great respect for the music, they studied in Ireland and have since been welcomed back as Masters of the Tradition.\n\nLearn More\n\nPaula Stokes was born and grew up in Ireland.

The High Kings formed in June 2007 when Brian, Darren, Finbarr and former member Martin Furey were asked to join a brand-new Irish ballad group by David Kavanagh after he had noticed a gap in the market for a band specialising in traditional Irish music. It didn’t take long during their first studio rehearsal for them to realise that the way their individual voices blended together meant that they were onto something special. The High Kings play 13 instruments between them, creating the unique sound and atmosphere that they still showcase to this day. This was confirmed when their self-titled debut album reached number 2 on the world Billboard Music chart. In March 2009 The High Kings played 5 consecutive sold out shows to a packed audience in Dublin’s Olympia Theatre.\n\nLearn More\n\nThe Jeremiahs is an Irish folk band that comprises four musicians who have come together with the common goal of writing, composing and performing folk songs and music.

The Tumbling Paddies have grown from strength to strength, particularly in the past two years. It is no surprise that their music is played in many venues throughout the world. Originally starting out in 2014 as a five-piece performing at local weddings and pubs in their beloved County Fermanagh the band has continuously evolved to where they are today. It wasn’t long until Oisin came in on keyboards and the band started to expand on their music gaining more and more followers as they toured. A major turning point was the chance introduction with Manager Andrew Cox after a performance in Belleek, County Fermanagh. Andrew gave the lads the drive and determination to record and perform throughout Ireland and further afield. After a few years of heavy gigging and indeed the band's first album of ten original tracks they have attracted a large group of loyal fans throughout Ireland and further afield. They continue to sell out venues up and down Ireland such as the TF Castlebar and the INEC in Killarney as well as many venues throughout the world having previously toured in Dubai, Germany, Spain, and England.\n\nLearn More\n\nTimothy G.
