        "text": "Why are cannabis consumers turning from buying pot at a dispensary to home growing? There are a lot of reasons: safety, self-sufficiency, and the prevalence of inflated, fake THC lab results. It also provides the ability to rule out traces of potentially harmful chemicals that weave their way into commercial cannabis markets around the world. Others just want an intimate connection with the plant.\n\nThere are reasons to taking control into your own hands when it comes to cannabis flower. Last month, California’s Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) issued a series of recalls after chlorfenapyr—a dangerous and potentially deadly Category I pesticide—was detected in cannabis samples. Last year, it was arsenic that turned up in a batch of Oregon cannabis, prompting a recall from the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commision (OLCC).\n\nHome growing eliminates the possibility of residual chemicals showing up in your stash. Over a dozen U.S. states allow home growing of adult-use or medical cannabis, while in Europe, decriminalization moves in a running list of countries allow for home growing in a patchwork of laws.\n\nFast Buds, an international company with offices in Los Angeles, Barcelona, London, Prague, and Bangkok, provides seeds to around 50 countries around the world as home growing takes root in many jurisdictions.\n\n“Legalization and decriminalization trends are moving faster and people would like to try and see what growing cannabis is all about,” Fast Buds Head of Marketing Eugene Boukreev tells Forbes in a video call, speaking about the first reason more people are experimenting with home growing. “The second reason is self-sufficiency and cost savings.”\n\nGermany’s recent move to legalize limited adult-use cannabis and create cultivation social clubs is a turning point for the European cannabis marketplace. “Growing cannabis is going to be more cost-effective than purchasing from [cannabis clubs or dispensaries], for example in Germany,” Boukreev says. “We have a lot of German clients that buy products for home growing.”\n\nDevices currently on the market also help beginners learn how to grow, such as AI-powered grow boxes that help novices manage nutrients, lighting, and so forth.\n\n“Technological advancements are another good point, because there are a lot of grow kits and automation around right now companies are trying to reach the market as well,” he says.\n\nConsumers are also home growing because it allows them to choose to use natural alternatives that eliminate exposure to potentially harmful chemicals that are more common in commercial cannabis operations, he explains.\n\nAward-Winning Genetics\n\nAutoflower seeds from the genetic library at Fast Buds finish fast, while feminized photoperiod seeds tend to do better in other climates. Fast Buds’ highest-selling autoflower strains are Gorilla Cookies, Strawberry Gorilla, Purple Punch, Tropicanna Cookies, and Bruce Banner. The majority of the company’s strains are autoflower, as Europe’s relatively high latitude compared to California and other U.S. states make autoflowers ideal for those climates.\n\n“Efficiency” is the reason people like autoflower varieties, Boukreev says, “because you can get a really nice harvest in just nine weeks regardless of sunlight. People choose autoflowers because the seeds are easy to grow.”\n\nThe company’s top six best-selling autoflower strains of 2024, with some change-ups from its highest-ever selling strains, are Gorilla Cookies, Strawberry Gorilla, Banana Purple Punch, Papaya Cookies—winner of Best New Strain at the 2024 Autoflower World Cup—Gorilla Zkittlez, and Ztrawberriez.\n\nAll eyes are on Germany, and the U.K. continues to dominate seed sales in Europe. “The two main markets for us is the United Kingdom and Germany,” Bourkreev says.\n\nFounded in 2010, Fast Buds is home to one of the largest autoflower seed banks in the world. The brand’s award-winning genetics are available direct-to-consumer for delivery in around 50 countries. The genetic library attracts over 1 million visitors per month. Fast Buds’ unique genetics won Best Sativa and Best New Strain at the Autoflower World Cup in 2024.\n\nIt’s a great place to start if you’re interested in growing at home versus buying from a club or a dispensary."
