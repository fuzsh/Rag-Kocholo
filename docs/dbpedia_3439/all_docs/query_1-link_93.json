        "text": "It hasn’t been the easiest of starts for the new Prisons and Probation Minister, James – now Lord – Timpson. Appointing the businessman who runs his family’s chain of key-cutting high-street stores was one of the very first announcements Sir Keir Starmer made on entering Downing Street. It was intended as a clear signal that the Government wanted to adopt a more reform-minded, rehabilitation-orientated approach to prisons than its predecessor.\n\nLord Timpson is widely known for training and employing ex-prisoners in his shops. He also chairs the Prison Reform Trust, and earlier this year he said publicly that too many people are being sent to prison unnecessarily.\n\nYet his first fortnight in Whitehall has turned out to be very different from what was anticipated. His boss, the Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood, has sanctioned the early release of 5,500 prisoners in September and October – not to demonstrate a greater emphasis on rehabilitation but instead to relieve chronic overcrowding in prisons.\n\nThere was real fear of rioting among the almost 90,000 current inmates crammed into prisons that simply have no more space to pack in anyone else. Official projections show that this number could rise to over 105,000 by 2027.\n\nBy the prison department’s own benchmark for safe capacity, there are already more than 7,600 extra people inside than there should be – despite a previous scheme, brought in by the Conservative government in October 2023, which saw 10,000 prisoners released early. In June of this year HMP Leeds had 72 per cent more people being held there than its safe limit, with Durham, Bedford, Wandsworth, Preston and Doncaster at 50 per cent over capacity.\n\nAnd, as Robert Rinder, a former criminal barrister, demonstrated in his recent Channel 4 series, Britain Behind Bars: A Secret History, there are plenty of precedents pointing to the fact that, when prisons get to operational breaking point, those in the cells run amok.\n\nBut how likely is it that the early-release scheme will work to relieve pressure – and could it cause more challenges than it solves?\n\nUnderstaffing, overcrowding and poor quick fixes\n\nMany of the thousands released will go into the care of a probation service that is severely understaffed. The most recent report by His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation published in September last year showed probation officer vacancy rates ranging from 20 per cent in the West Midlands to 35 per cent in Greater London.\n\nNot only is probation short of people, it already lacks sufficient “approved premises”, probation hostels where those released can be closely supervised by trained professionals during those first three months when all the evidence suggests they are most likely to reoffend. The huge new influx will mean that the standard stay in approved premises is being cut from a maximum of 12 weeks to eight.\n\nSimilarly, early release will mean that the preparations usually made in prison for those approaching the end of their sentence will not happen. Former prisoner David Shipley was in London’s Wandsworth jail for most of 2020. It is meant to hold about 950 prisoners but had roughly 1,600.\n\n“There weren’t enough places in the employment and education [schemes] designed to prepare prisoners [for the outside world],” says Shipley. Instead, he says, prisoners spent hours lying in their bunks, getting more depressed and resorting to drugs, alcohol and self harm.\n\nThat problem appears widespread throughout the prison system. “A sort of post-Covid torpor seems to have infected many prisons, with workshops and classrooms empty, and prisoners whiling away their time watching daytime TV and sleeping,” is how the chief inspector of prisons, Charlie Taylor, recently described the current state of affairs behind bars. Hardly encouragement to change lives, even if they are willing.\n\nProblems in the ‘overstretched’ probation service\n\nWhen the previous government ran an early-release programme in 2023 and 2024 – again designed to prevent overcrowding – it resulted in a marked spike in those quickly returning to custody.\n\nIn the last three months of 2023 alone, 7,000 recently-released prisoners did something that caused their probation officer to send them back behind bars. That is up 17 per cent on the same period in the year before, and indicates that the places the Justice Secretary is freeing up this time could well be quickly filled by those who just vacated them.\n\n“Probation is overstretched,” agrees former prison governor John Podmore, now professor of applied social sciences at the University of Durham, “and that increases the pressure on probation officers, a disproportionate number of whom are new to the job and inexperienced, to return those on parole for minor infractions on the terms of their early release.”\n\nToo much focus, he feels, is being placed at the moment on numbers going into prison, “and there is not enough focus on those going out, and how they are being prepared for release and supervised once out”.\n\nShort-term fixes to solve prison overcrowding, Podmore argues after 30 years in the prison service running Belmarsh, Brixton and Swaleside jails, have a poor success record. But what’s the alternative for the new Government – and when did the problem first become a crisis (and it is a crisis) that no government has yet been able to crack?\n\nThe start of the overcrowding crisis\n\nA decade ago prisons in England and Wales had 8,175 “operational” or spare places. By 2019, this had fallen to just 2,012, prompting Boris Johnson to announce plans to create six new prisons at a cost of £4 billion as part of his drive to get tough on crime.\n\nWhile that £4 billion sum has subsequently risen, the promise to have the new prisons open by the mid-2020s has receded. The courts, however, have been busy handing out longer sentences to those who commit violent or sexual offences. In 2009, these accounted for 39 per cent of prisoners. Now that figure is 52 per cent.\n\n“The length and quality of the training has been so cut back. There is no front-line, real-life training,” says Podmore. “They do it all in the classroom now, in mock cells. The result is that recruits aren’t properly prepared to deal with ever more challenging prisoners… That’s why they leave quickly.”\n\nThis gets to the heart of the matter. You need more staff and more facilities in prison if you are to balance the often competing claims of punishment, security and rehabilitation – and if you are to avoid the fate of the 50-plus per cent of released prisoners who at the moment end up back in prison within 12 months, a figure that rises to 70 per cent in the women’s estate.\n\nA spiral of drugs, violence and poor education\n\nOne successful example of things going right in the prison system are the training academies that Lord Timpson’s firm runs on a number of prison sites, so that prisoners can boost their skills while serving their sentence and have the promise of a job when they get out. All statistics about reoffending show that having a job to go to when released – as well as a place to live and a supportive family or friends – make a big difference.\n\nAnd yet at the first sign of a staff shortage, education is always the very first thing to be cancelled, the teachers employed to deliver qualifications complain. In the prison system, they remain on the bottom rung of the hierarchy, despite efforts in recent years to boost education’s standing, including a landmark 2016 report on reforming prison education by a commission led by the “super-head” Dame Sally Coates that included Lord Timpson among its contributors.\n\nCoates’s report was publicly endorsed by then justice secretary Michael Gove “without hesitation”, yet it has not been implemented in any meaningful way in the eight years since, as the parliamentary select committee on education noted in a 2022 follow-up. Only a handful of education departments in prisons were judged by Ofsted inspectors to be outstanding, and most were found inadequate.\n\nA new tendering round for contracts to provide education within prisons is currently under way, but with no more money on the table it has so far failed to attract any new suppliers. One major private provider to the criminal justice system also pulled out last autumn because there were not sufficient profits to be made.\n\n“If you build another wing but you don’t build space for education or work,” Charlie Taylor warned recently, “then that fuels the demand for drugs and we see prisons getting trapped into a cycle of rising drugs, violence and staff leaving because they just don’t feel safe.”\n\nThe focus in prisons is – “rightly”, he added – on safety and security, but that comes “to the detriment of purposeful activity. And by doing so they miss a trick because you can focus on reducing the supply [of drugs] into prisons until you’re blue in the face unless you reduce the demand for drugs.”\n\nLearning from the Scandi prison model\n\nOther prison systems around Europe, notably in Scandinavia and the Netherlands, have achieved impressive results by taking just such an approach. In Sweden, they achieved the triple whammy of falling numbers of prisoners, falling levels of crime and prison closures.\n\nBy contrast the average cost of a prisoner for a year in England and Wales has risen to around £50,000. The official who was in charge of the success story in Sweden, Nils Oberg, subsequently applied to head the English and Welsh Prison and Probation Service, but an internal candidate was preferred. Any real appetite for change appears to be hard to discern.\n\nInstead, initiatives around education and employment are dwarfed by expensive schemes to crack down on drugs being brought into prisons – including by prison officers in the pay of criminal gangs. All have failed to adequately halt the problem.\n\nIn a 2023 Longford Lecture, former prisons minister Rory Stewart argued that prisons are the public service that concerns voters least of all.\n\nCompared with hospitals or schools, most people don’t think they will ever go to prison, or even set foot inside one on a visit, so they have little interest in their taxes being spent on them.\n\nAnd without new money, overcrowding looks unlikely to be an issue easily solved.\n\nThe best solution: an ex-prisoner’s proposal\n\nFormer prisoner David Shipley has one suggestion that wouldn’t break the bank. He began his degree-level studies when he was transferred to complete his sentence at Hollesley Bay Open Prison in Suffolk. He is now working on a PhD.\n\nHe suggests greater investment in reproducing the effective rehabilitative regimes found in such open prisons.\n\n“At the moment only 4,500 prisoners are in open conditions, which are much cheaper to run at around £15,000 less per year per place because there is less of a security-obsessed culture,” he says. “But there is a long waiting list to go there.”\n\nTheir capacity could be easily and cheaply expanded, he argues, since most are on large sites, in the countryside, with space to add more low-rise freestanding buildings. “They could house the potentially 25,000 people convicted of non-violent crimes currently held in higher security prisons who just aren’t going to try to abscond, and free up capacity higher up the system.”\n\nAs for Lord Timpson, the best way forward is to focus his strategy on the long term, rather than the short. It may not bring results in the five-year cycle of general elections, but – as a non-politician among politicians, and a businessman first and foremost – he can take that approach whereas career politicians before him may have struggled.\n\nThere are some other issues he may want to address that cross government department boundaries too. Department for Education figures published last month showed that almost 9,400 youngsters had been permanently excluded from our schools in 2022/2023, up 44 per cent on the previous year. Those excluded make up just 0.11 per cent of the school population, but as they go forward in life they constitute a whopping 42 per cent of adult prisoners, according to official figures.\n\nLikewise, those taken into care as children represent two per cent of the general population, but they are 31 per cent of women and 24 per cent of men in prison.\n\n“Children in care in particular are so much at risk,” reflects Coates, almost a decade on from the publication of her report. “Anyone wanting to address the crisis in prisons needs to ask hard questions about why so many are ending up in prison, and what you can do to invest better the money we are now spending on keeping them in prison in early intervention to improve outcomes for care leavers so they don’t end up in prison.”\n\nThere is no shortage of other suggestions for bringing down a prison population that is the highest in western Europe. What seems clear is that until the chronic overcrowding that afflicts our jails is effectively tackled from the root cause, upwards, the new Prisons Minister is going to struggle to make a sustained impact – no matter how many new cells are built, or how many prisoners are released early.\n\nPeter Stanford is director of the Longford Trust, a charity that offers support to serving and ex-prisoners to continue their rehabilitation by going to university"
