        "text": "Some Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine are likely experiencing drinking water shortages, according to the UK's Ministry of Defence.\n\n\"Damage inflicted during ongoing Russian strikes against utilities infrastructure is now almos certainly curtailing water supply,\" it said in a statement.\n\nRussia has continually targeted Ukrainian infrastructure throughout the two-and-a-half year long war.\n\nThe MoD also noted that hot weather would have exacerbated the issue.\n\nIt also noted one report suggesting that rations for Russian pilots had been limited to one litre per day - a quarter of the minimum requirements for high-temperature working.\n\n\"As a result, Russian pilots have reportedly approached local citizens for water.\"\n\nThe MoD also claimed that some military units had been forced to improvise filtration attempts and were using \"stagnant puddles for daily water\".\n\n\"This has likely led to an increase of waterborne diseases amongst Russian soldiers... and will almost certainly impact morale and operational effectiveness.\"\n\nUS Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal praised Ukraine's invasion of the Kursk region yesterday during a meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nThe senators were visiting Kyiv as part of a US bipartisan congressional delegation.\n\n\"Taking this war to Putin and making him understand and pay a price is the right thing,\" Mr Graham told Mr Zelenskyy, adding that the move was \"bold and brilliant.\"\n\n\"So two-and-a-half years later you're still standing and you're in Russia. Remind me not to invade Ukraine.\n\n\"I'm so proud of you, your people, your military, your leadership, your country.\"\n\nUkraine's top military commander said yesterday his forces now control 1,000sq km of Russian territory.\n\nBelarus has sent troops to Russia in order to take part in training exercises.\n\n\"Crews of missile troops and artillery units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus are leaving for the Russian Federation training ground to practice combat use issues,\" a statement from the Belarusian ministry of defence read.\n\n\"During the field exercise, units will undergo a control exercise on managing missile strikes with combat launches from missile systems and multiple launch rocket systems,\" it added.\n\nBelarus and Russia are close allies, with Presidents Lukashenko and Putin meeting frequently.\n\nBelarus announced the strengthening of its military presence near the borders with Ukraine at the end of last week.\n\n\"Military units from the special operations forces, ground forces, missile forces, including those with the Polyanez jet artillery systems and the Iskander systems, were tasked with deploying in the designated areas. We have also increased the anti-aircraft missile capabilities, e-warfare, and aviation,\" the Belarusian minister of defence said on Saturday.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy's sanctioning of an invasion of the Kursk region is an \"insane step\" that threatens further escalation, the Russian foreign intelligence service has said.\n\nThe service also said that its sources in the US are growing frustrated with the Ukrainian leader and that Washington \"is looking for a replacement for him\".\n\nJoe Biden's administration has strongly supported President Zelenskyy since Russia's invasion and there are no other suggestions that the US is seeking to remove him.\n\n\"Zelenskyy is taking crazy steps that threaten to escalate far beyond Ukraine,\" the agency's press office told state media outlet RIA.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader acknowledged the attack earlier this week.\n\n\"Ukraine is proving that it can indeed restore justice and ensure the necessary pressure on the aggressor,\" he said.\n\nRead more on that here...\n\nAs we reported earlier, Ukraine appears to have continued attacking the Russian border regions with drones as its ground invasion of Kursk continues.\n\n\"The latest is the Russian defence ministry saying they shot down 12 Ukrainian drones launched into the Kursk region,\" our security and defence editor Deborah Haynes, in Ukraine, says.\n\nA further two drones were shot down over the Voronezh and Belgorod regions.\n\nWatch Haynes' latest report here...\n\n\"It's a week now since Ukrainian forces launched their offensive into Kursk from the Sumy region in northeastern Ukraine,\" Haynes says, adding many have been shocked at the success of the operation - including those in Kyiv.\n\n\"I imagine there was probably quite a bit of surprise for the Ukrainians that they've been able to push so far so quickly.\n\n\"Of course, they would have had intelligence, they could see the lack of Russian defences along that border region, but they would have anticipated a much stronger Russian response, much, much faster. But that didn't happen.\n\n\"This is a disaster for Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nAs to the aims of the invasion, Haynes says sources have offered her some insight.\n\n\"One of the [sources] said [the aim] was to create basically a buffer zone, a grey zone, not inside Ukrainian territory, but inside Russian territory,\" she says.\n\nThat would help better protect the the communities who live in Sumy and Kharkiv regions - which have faced heavy bombardment from Russian forces on the other side of the border.\n\n\"Another aim is to have greater leverage over Vladimir Putin to to hold some territory that could maybe then be negotiated for Russian-held territory in Ukraine,\" she says.\n\nAdditionally, any prisoners captured or land gained could be used as part of what is known as the \"exchange fund\" - POWs or assets taken by Ukraine which could be swapped for their equivalents on the Russian side at a later date.\n\n\"Another goal is really to show the Russian people that the war is much closer than they think.\"\n\nUkrainian forces appear to still be advancing inside the Kursk region despite recent claims from military bloggers that Russian troops had begun to stabilise the frontline, the Institute for the Study of War has said.\n\n\"Russian milbloggers claimed on 11 August that Ukrainian offensive activity decreased in Kursk Oblast; however, a prominent Kremlin-affiliated milblogger refuted these claims on 12 August and noted that Russian forces are far from stabilising the situation, in part due to poor C2,\" it said.\n\nC2, or \"command and control\", is a military term meaning that authority and direction is overseen by a properly designated individual over assigned resources in the accomplishment of a common goal.\n\nISW has assessed that Russia has a confused C2 structure and as such has been unable to effectively counter Ukraine's invasion of the Kursk region.\n\nThis is in part down to poor preparedness, but also to Vladimir Putin issuing overlapping instructions to different bodies, like the security service and ministry of defence, ISW said (see previous post).\n\n\"Ukrainian forces reportedly launched new incursions into western Kursk Oblast near Slobodka-Ivanovka, Tetkino, Gordeevka, Uspenka, and Viktorovka,\" it said.\n\nVladimir Putin is looking to shift responsibility for the continuing challenges Russia faces in repelling the Ukrainian invasion of Kursk and continuing problems in other border regions, a leading thinktank has assessed.\n\nThe US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) noted Mr Putin's meeting with military, security, and federal and regional government officials about the situation in Belgorod, Bryansk, and Kursk yesterday.\n\nHis focus was \"to portray himself as an effective and knowledgeable manager of the situation\", ISW said.\n\nReferring to the readout of the meeting, ISW pointed out a number of occasions where Mr Putin appeared to \"chastise\" other officials, \"likely in order to publicly depict the regional heads as responsible for these issues and in need of Putin's help\".\n\n\"Putin's assertion that each official has only one responsibility contrasts with his attempt to frame himself as capable of overseeing and competently understanding the political, socio-economic, and military situation along the international border,\" ISW said.\n\nFurthermore, the decision to publish the readout and share footage of Mr Putin's chastisement of officials was likely a warning to others not to speak publicly on the Ukrainian invasion into Kursk.\n\nHowever, other parts of the meeting were somewhat chaotic - with Mr Putin delegating overlapping tasks to separate departments, something the ISW assessed as \"further highlighting how the Russian force grouping in Kursk Oblast is struggling to establish the joint command and control structures necessary to coordinate operations\"."
