        "text": "In my lifetime, I've probably eaten my weight in red snappers.\n\nIt's funny, when I was young, I thought all the other hot dogs were the weird ones. I thought brown hot dogs were so strange. To the point where I didn't even want to eat them. But you know, age and maturity bring wisdom when it comes to food colors, haha.\n\nRead More: The Worst Fast Food Chain in the US has Zero Maine Locations\n\nThere are plenty of urban legends about them, and all sorts of opinions as well. Most Mainers won't even acknowledge the existence of another hot dog. We defend them with every fiber of our being, as though they were our complete identity. But what if I told you, that red snappers may actually owe their existence to... the British?\n\nRed snappers may be a direct descendant of the saveloy.\n\nSo there's little sausage they all love over across the pond, called the saveloy. It's a little pork stuffie, that you'll find in most fish & chip shops around Britain. As far as what's in it for spices and such, it all seems pretty close to what we'd see. Maybe a bit more herbal. But just like us, they boil them and eat them that way most often.\n\nThey also use them up in curries and things like that. But I noticed on two different sites on my search, that both compared them directly to what we know as red snappers. So there must be something to it. All this time, we've thought this was our legacy, and it's basically just a ripoff of Britain?! Wth?! Here watch this guy eat one...\n\nBut that's not all...\n\nIt's possible that not only is the saveloy the precursor to our beloved red snappers, they say it could be the grandfather of the corn dog as well. It's said that other than boiling, that the other most popular preparation method is to batter them up and deep fry them. So it seems that all our favorite, most \"American\" foods, are just British knockoffs.\n\nRead More: Maine has 7 Locations of the Country's Priciest Fast Food Joint\n\nI mean, it's food. Most recipes are simply a reinterpretation of something else. It's rare when you come across a recipe that's never been done before. And let's be real... Our early American ancestors all pretty much came from Europe. so it's not a big stretch that we ripped of their little hot dog. But I guarantee we perfected it.\n\nHow many of these have we ripped off? Or are these American originals?"
