        "text": "There may be nothing more nü-metal than a cover, but there is also one other constant in the world of baggy jeans and de-tuned guitars… side projects. Most of the bands that are listed in the article take the approach of radio friendly unit movers, but in the case of a few they are passion projects or wacko fever dreams. Here are 13 side projects you may or may not need to know.\n\nDevice\n\nWhen Disturbed went on hiatus in 2011, David Drainman formed Device. The self-titled debut was littered with guest stars like Geezer Butler, M. Shadows, Glenn Hughes and a duet with Lzzy Hale. By 2015, Disturbed was back from hiatus and Device was on the shelf. Device guitarist Virus was quoted as saying that Device \"would have been huge\". The ooh-wah-ah-ah-ah vocalist has no intention of making new Device music.\n\nBig Dumb Face\n\nNü-metal's favorite weirdo Wes Borland released Duke Lion Fights The Terror!! In 2001. Anyone looking for a red backwards ball cap or the nookie was in for a rude awakening. The band features Wes' brother Scott Borland and makes you want to ask Mr. and Mrs. Borland what they fed the boys growing up. Influences from Mr. Bungle and Ween are worn on the Borland boys sleeves. Just don't ask Wes his thoughts on Aaron Lewis.\n\nMurderdolls\n\nIn Murderdolls, Joey Jordison traded in his drum sticks for a guitar, some glam rock attire and some spooky tunes to pay tribute to his Mötley Crüe meets Misfits roots. Bring in Wednesday 13 and you have the recipe for a ghoulish rock masterpiece. Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls was a hit in the UK and Japan. The band recorded a followup with a guest appearance from Mick Mars of Mötley Crüe. The Murderdolls would tour with Guns N' Roses before splitting in 2011. Wednesday 13 is still out there honoring the band's legacy and the memory of Joey Jordison.\n\nCrosses\n\nCrosses is what happens when you lock Stephen Carpenter out of the studio and allow Chino to record all the music on his own. Shaun Lopez of Far joins Chino Moreno on this journey through the pair's dark wave side. Any Deftones fan will immediately feel at home with the sensual vocals and the music will wrap you up in a warm blanket of audio waves. Crosses hits on all the notes of Chino's influences and gives you a peek inside his musical mind.\n\nHellyeah\n\nOn paper, Hellyeah should have been one of the greatest metal supergroups of all time. Two parts Mudvayne, two parts Nothingface and Vinnie Paul of Pantera was the recipe for \"I cannot wait to hear this band\". What we got was \"Alcohaulin' Ass\". Over time the boys did put out some bangers, but it never lived up to what it could have been. R.I.P. Vinnie.\n\nStone Sour\n\nTechnically, Slipknot was Corey's side project. But for this exercise, we will count Stone Sour as the side band of the masked man from the mighty Slipknot. This was one of the first times that many of us got to see Corey's face without the mask with the \"Through Glass\" video. Stone Sour is another time when the vocalist comes with a little more commercially viable product. With Jim Root in tow the group also recorded some killer covers EPs.\n\nA Perfect Circle\n\nThe brainchild of Billy Howerdel and featuring the vocal stylings of Maynard James Keenan of Tool, A Perfect Circle burst on the scene in 2000 with the monstrous Mer de Noms. The band matched Maynard's powerful voice with straight ahead tunes. \"Judith\" to this day is a rock radio staple and brought in the fans that think that Tool is a little out in prog rock land.\n\nLove And Death\n\nBrian \"Head\" Welch's side band, Love And Death, started out as a solo project and now features Breaking Benjamin's Jasen Rauch. Head shows off his Korn roots throughout the band's catalog with some very Jonathan Davis-like vocals and heavy guitars. This is an example of hearing what a band member brings to the main band by hearing his riffs in his side band.\n\nFort Minor\n\nMike Shinoda's the rapper to Chester Bennington's smooth vocals in Linkin Park. With Fort Minor, Mike steps up and takes over the mics and instruments. \"Remember The Name\" is the soundtrack to every sports training video. With Jay-Z at the executive producer helm, you get banger after banger with \"The Rising Tied\".\n\nScars On Broadway\n\nDaron Malakian of System Of A Down grabbed his System Of A Down bandmate John Dolmayan and created a sound that was less frazzled metal and more song-based. That seems to be a theme for your side project. More radio rock for everyone. Daron gives you just enough System Of A Down to satisfy those cravings. The band is active on and off and has recently played some of the Danny Wimmer Festivals.\n\nSeven Hours After Violet\n\nWith only one song released, Seven Hours After Violet has the potential to be one of the best on the list. The band is the brainchild of System Of A Down bassist Shavo Odajian and producer Morgoth. The music is as soft as Charmin at moments and will crush you with the power of the gods at other times. If \"Paradise\" is the beginning of the journey, I am along for the ride.\n\nDark New Day\n\nAnother brother act popping up on the list but the Lowerys weren't raised on a diet of paint chips and H.R. Pufnstuf like the Borlands. Sevendust's Clint Lowery and Stuck Mojo's Corey Lowery teamed up for some metal that hit you right in the soul. The brothers brought the best of their respective bands to this collaboration. Fans of Sevendust will recognize those riffs and vocal stylings.\n\nFieldy's Dreams"
