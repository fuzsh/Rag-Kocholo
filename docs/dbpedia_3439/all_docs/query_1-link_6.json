        "text": "What’s not to love about television from across the pond? There’s the delightfully dry and dark humor (or should we say, “humour”), funky slang, and, of course—those accents.\n\nIf British telly is your cup of tea, we’ve got you covered. From period dramas to crime mysteries, comedies, action, and even reality, we have the best British TV shows streaming now on Hulu.\n\nBritish TV Shows on Hulu\n\nThe Office (UK)\n\nBefore there was Michael Scott, there was David Brent—a mid-level manager at Wernham Hogg, a failing paper company in South East England. Much like Michael, David thinks he’s cooler and more liked by his peers than he actually is.\n\nDespite all the parallels to the American adaptation, there are stark differences that make the UK version of The Office so delightfully British, including dry one-liners, amplified cynicism, and blunt dialogue.\n\nComedian Ricky Gervais stars in the OG version of your favorite sitcom streaming now on Hulu.\n\nWatch: The Office\n\nKilling Eve\n\nCreated in the U.K. by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Killing Eve is a spy thriller series surrounding the cat-and-mouse relationship between a British intelligence investigator and an unhinged assassin. This Golden Globe®-winning series is a female-led, British-American action drama with elements of dark comedy sprinkled throughout.\n\nCatch up on Killing Eve seasons 1-3 now on Hulu.\n\nWatch: Killing Eve\n\nThis Way Up\n\nSet in London, This Way Up follows the relatable life of Áine—a single Irish woman currently putting the pieces of her life back together after an explosive nervous breakdown.

For starters, this series truly has it all—murder, drama, action, and even intense psychological thrills.\n\nElba’s brilliant portrayal of Detective Chief Inspector, John Luther, will leave you wanting more at the end of each episode as his character walks a thin line between good and evil.\n\nWatch seasons 1-5 of Luther streaming now on Hulu.\n\nWatch: Luther\n\nPrey\n\nWhen detective Marcus Farrow is accused of brutally murdering his wife and son, he flees in an attempt to prove his innocence before being tracked down by the people he used to work with. This nail-biting British action drama series will leave you on the edge of your seat as you root for the Serious Crime Unit’s most wanted suspect.\n\nSeasons 1 & 2 of Prey are available to stream now on Hulu.\n\nWatch: Prey\n\nHarlots\n\nYou say harlot like it’s a bad thing (*hair flip*). This edgy British period drama takes place in 1776 London where opportunities for women’s economic advancement are far and few between.\n\nHarlots tells the story of Margaret Wells, a fiercely independent mother and brothel owner determined to pave the way to a better future for herself and her family.\n\nWatch all three seasons of the Hulu original series, Harlots, streaming now.\n\nWatch: Harlots\n\nCoronation Street\n\n88 weddings, 120 deaths, 39 births, and 5,000 characters span the 7,500+ episodes (no, you haven’t gone mad—there are really 7,500+ episodes) that make Coronation Street one of the most popular British TV shows of all time. It’s also the longest-running soap opera ever.\n\nGet a taste of the sordid affairs and domestic disasters that have kept this beloved drama on British airwaves since 1960 by streaming seasons 62 & 63 of Coronation Street on Hulu now.\n\nWatch: Coronation Street\n\nThe Only Way is Essex\n\nAre British dramas and reality television your cup of tea?

Martin’s unfortunate phobia forces him to leave his elite professional life in the bustling city of London and become a general practitioner in a small Cornwall village instead.\n\nFollow Martin as he adjusts to his new life and develops relationships with the locals in all 5 seasons of Doc Martin available on Hulu now.\n\nWatch: Doc Martin\n\nBanished\n\nBanished is a period drama loosely based on true historical events of 1788 Great Britain.
