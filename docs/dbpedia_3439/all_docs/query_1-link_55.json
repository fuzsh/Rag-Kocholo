        "text": "Stardom: The Wire, Luther, and Thor\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nElba’s career break came on the HBO crime drama The Wire, in which for three seasons (2002–04) he played the financially savvy drug kingpin Russell (“Stringer”) Bell. He branched out into comedy on the American version of the sitcom The Office and into romance on the comedy-drama The Big C. Elba later earned critical acclaim as the complex antihero Detective Chief Inspector John Luther in the crime series Luther (2010–19). His interpretation of the brilliant but self-destructive Luther earned him a Golden Globe Award (2012) as well as four Emmy Award nominations and a BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) Award nod. Elba’s later TV credits included the miniseries Guerrilla (2017), about radical activists in 1970s London.\n\nDuring this time, the imposing 6-foot 3-inch (1.9-metre) Elba also appeared on the big screen, having made his feature film debut in Belle maman (1999; Beautiful Mother). He subsequently appeared in such movies as 28 Weeks Later (2007), American Gangster (2007), and Obsessed (2009). In 2011 he joined the Marvel Comics universe as the Norse deity Heimdall in Thor (2011), a role that he reprised in Thor 2: The Dark World (2013), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Thor: Love and Thunder (2022). The versatile actor earned critical acclaim for his moving portrayal of Nelson Mandela in Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom (2013) and for his harrowing turn as the Commandant, a brutal warlord leading child soldiers in an unnamed African civil war, in Beasts of No Nation (2015); for the latter film he earned a BAFTA Award nomination.\n\nThe Suicide Squad and Hijack\n\nIn 2016 Elba played the villainous Krall in Star Trek Beyond, and his rich baritone voice could be heard in three animated films—as the tough police captain (and water buffalo) Chief Bogo in Zootopia, as the villainous tiger Shere Khan in The Jungle Book, and as the sea lion Fluke in Finding Dory. His film credits from 2017 included the action-fantasy The Dark Tower, an adaptation of Stephen King’s popular book series; The Mountain Between Us, an adventure story about two strangers who survive a plane crash; and Molly’s Game, a drama based on a memoir by Molly Bloom, who became famous when she was arrested for her role in an illegal high-stakes poker ring favoured by Hollywood celebrities.\n\nIn 2018 Elba made his feature directing debut with Yardie, a drama about a drug courier who is sent to London, where he seeks revenge for the death of his brother. That year he also created the TV series In the Long Run, a comedy about his childhood; he also appeared in the show. Elba again returned to his roots when he starred as a struggling DJ in the British TV series Turn Up Charlie (2019), which he cocreated. He then played the villain in the action movie Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019), a spin-off from the long-running franchise. His other credits from 2019 included the family musical Cats, a film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s hugely successful stage production. Elba later starred in Concrete Cowboy (2020), about a father who reconnects with his son through urban horseback riding.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

That year he also played an outlaw in The Harder They Fall, a revenge western in which he costarred with Regina King and Jonathan Majors. In 2022 Elba starred in several films, including George Miller’s Three Thousand Years of Longing, in which he played a djinn. The following year he took the lead role in the TV miniseries Hijack, a thriller about an airplane that is taken over by armed men. For his performance, Elba earned an Emmy nomination.\n\nElba was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2016."
