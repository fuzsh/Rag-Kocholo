        "text": "A first of its kind\n\nA few days ago, the government of Ghana launched at a lavish ceremony a facility that it called, “Ghana’s first commercial gold refinery”. At the event, the country’s leaders described the moment as destiny-changing; centuries of exporting raw gold was finally at an end. The hour of “value-addition” has struck! Extreme efforts went into getting the international press to amplify the message. AFP, the global French news agency, even went as far as calling it the “first of its kind in West Africa“.\n\nStrange Misinformation\n\nShockingly, the refinery, housed inside Diamond House, seat of the country’s state-owned jeweler, the Precious Minerals Marketing Corporation (PMMC), is neither Ghana’s first commercial gold refinery nor even the largest and most sophisticated. Stunned by the brazen misinformation, I took to X (formerly Twitter) immediately to straighten things up.\n\nAt least three major commercial gold refineries predated the Royal Ghana Gold Refinery, as this latest one is called. As I explained on X, the first to come to my notice was Asap Vasa Company Limited, with a capacity to refine 100 kilograms of gold a day, opened in 2013.\n\nBut, in truth, there was an aborted attempt to set one up even earlier in 2011. Years later, in 2016, financial close was reached and that project came online as Gold Coast Refinery.\n\nGold Coast Refinery, established near Accra’s international airport by Ghanaian-Egyptian construction company, Euroget, by virtue of having the capacity of refining 480 kilograms of gold a day, is actually the largest refinery of its kind in Ghana (and possibly even West Africa, as it likely outstrips Nigeria’s Dukia Gold), not Royal Ghana Gold Refinery (400 kilograms a day). It was also the first refinery to produce fully standardised “hallmarked” gold bars in line with LBMA rules.\n\nWhilst Gold Coast Refinery was still in the wilderness of financial planning, Sahara Royal Gold Refinery (200 kilograms a day capacity) was launched in Accra.\n\nThese players are merely the ones whose launch was, on each occasion, heralded by senior government officials as marking a new stage of local value addition in the gold sector. There are several other specialty refineries in the country, such as Helvent Holdings, Sewia, AA Minerals, Goldstrom, etc, which are actually the ones often preferred by artisanal gold miners and small-scale traders.\n\nTruth be told, the bigger, more sophisticated, players like Sahara Royal and Gold Coast have mostly been lying idle, in some years refining and exporting zero kilograms of gold. So also has the latest big boy on the block, Royal Ghana. Since technical commissioning in November 2021, customs records show that it has barely exported any refined gold. The problems facing such refineries are rather straightforward and outlined in broad strokes in my tweet. They deserve serious policy attention, not PR. In future commentary, I may flesh out the issues. Right now, though, I am more interested in Royal Ghana’s launch.\n\nWhy such twisted PR?\n\nWhy would the government launch a refinery smaller and less sophisticated than some refineries already operational in the country, and struggling to get gold to refine, with such fanfare? And even go further to pump resources into PR to create the impression that something groundbreaking and country-transforming has happened?\n\nThe innocuous answer is that Ghana is on the brink of general elections on 7th December 2024, and the ruling party just wanted a nice feel-good story for the electorate. An even more optimistic answer is that this refinery has 20% state ownership, is in a direct joint venture partnership with state-owned PMMC, and has been positioned to refine local gold purchased by the Bank of Ghana to boost its reserves. Hence, it is no ordinary commercial refinery.\n\nOne could excuse the outright falsity in the way the project was presented if the above explanations carry weight, except that they actually raise more intriguing questions.\n\nReading into Motives\n\nBefore Royal Ghana came into the picture, Gold Coast Refinery had been discussing a strategic partnership with the government for many years. Having spent nearly five times more money on its refinery than Royal Ghana’s promoters have on theirs, Gold Coast’s investors were just as willing to offer the government carried interest if assurances could be given that local gold miners would be compelled or induced to use it in some fashion before exporting their gold.\n\nAs mentioned in my tweet, the large-scale miners prefer to maintain existing contracts and relationships with LBMA-certified refineries like Rand in South Africa to ensure that they can preserve current international trading channels. Forcing these companies to use a local refinery would require that such a refinery acquires LBMA certification (or perhaps from another major certifier, such as COMEX or Shanghai Futures) in order to be able to export globally recognised hallmarked bars. Such certification programs, however, have strenuous rules on capitalisation, minimum annual output track record, and a whole host of reputational and other due diligence markers. Suffice it to say that no refinery in Ghana meets these requirements for now.\n\nThat makes the use of regulatory fiat more suitable for the small scale gold sector, especially in relation to the Bank of Ghana’s own gold purchasing program. Whichever refinery can secure government support to become the place where small scale gold producers, and maybe eventually even the big mines, have to send their dore (raw) gold to be refined from the 92% – 96% range to the 99.9% range will become the market winner. It would seem that Royal Ghana Gold Refinery has won that contest. But how?\n\nAs previously indicated, Gold Coast Refinery have spent years lobbying for the same strategic relationship with the government. It has invested more capital and been around for much longer. How did Royal Ghana overtake it to win this prize, and why is the government so keen to celebrate the latter with such pomp and pageantry? Even going to the extent of feeding international press outlets with outright misinformation?\n\nState Enchantment yet again\n\nWhenever something of this nature doesn’t add up in Ghana, I turn to my theory of “State Enchantment“. Whenever you see the Ghanaian government working itself up into a frenzy to describe some project in superlative terms as fulfilling some glorious destiny for the country, you can rest assured that they are trying to deflect attention from a closer look at the underlying commercial relations and objectives of whatever it is that has been packaged as a “national redemptive project”. Yes, state enchantment, or jujufication, if you will.\n\nJust as state enchantment is what is at play when the government denies the existence of credit scoring institutions in the country just so it can soften the ground to launch a new one owned by politically connected players, it is the same principle at work when existing refineries are denied existence so that some kind of monopolistic advantage can be conferred on a newcomer.\n\nKnowing the pattern quite well now, there are no prizes for guessing that I dug deep into Royal Ghana Gold Refinery with understandable suspicion as soon as I saw the usual signs. What I found wasn’t too reassuring.\n\nEnter yet another hollow investor\n\nRoyal Ghana, as mentioned earlier, is a joint venture between Rosy Royal Minerals Limited and state-owned PMMC.\n\nRosy Royal is an Ahmedabad (India) – based mining company, 99% owned by Murtaza Samiwala, with registered share capital of less than $1.8 million and authorised capital of less than $6 million.\n\nIntriguingly, it has no experience whatsoever in sophisticated gold refining at all. Nestled in a small unmarked corner of a non-descript building in one of Ahmedabad’s less fashionable districts (since vacating a better location shared with Zinzuwadia Jewelers), it specialises in stone quarrying for tiles production, not gold.\n\nIn recent years, Rosy Royal’s revenues have plummeted and its losses have mounted.\n\nWhereas in 2019, the company recorded revenues of nearly $3.5 million, albeit with negligible profits, in the latest financial year, it recorded less than $2900 in revenues and nearly $250,000 in losses. Its bank balance was barely $30,000. Its total net worth is less than $800,000. The collapse in revenue may be due to a cancellation of some of the company’s mining leases by provincial governments in India, which the courts have reverted back for review. It is worth pointing out though that the company has a history of zero or negligible sales in some years. Its outstanding debts are about $2.1 million, out of which an amount of about $512,000 has been secured with pledged assets.\n\nMore worryingly, lenders have over $200,000 in charges against its assets still outstanding, meaning that it is unable to fully service its debts. It has a highly negative interest coverage ratio, suggesting that the amount of money it pays out in interest for loans it has taken is several multiples of its total earnings.\n\nBoth of its last two CARO-compliant audits were qualified, a sign of auditor unease. In particular, its auditors have been unable to verify the actual existence of its mining equipment, inventories, and other movable assets (it has no buildings or other immoveable property). This, clearly, is a company on the verge of full financial distress.\n\nIn any event, it is highly doubtful that the involvement of such a company as the majority shareholder of Royal Ghana will meet the high bar of LBMA certification.\n\nIt gets curioser.\n\nIn the time period corresponding to the setup of Royal Ghana Gold Limited, Rosy Royal has made no overseas investments, certainly none to the magnitude of $20 million to $25 million as the newly launched refinery is said to have cost. Nowhere does Rosy Royal disclose this massive investment outlay. It is not reflected in its assets, borrowings, or anywhere else in its books over the relevant period. In fact, there is no trace whatsoever of any investment in any kind of subsidiary, related party, or joint venture in its recent accounts. Nothing. Nada. Zilch!\n\nFolks, we have a problem\n\nIn short, dear readers, from the information available on Rosy Royal, we are fairly confident in our analysis that it IS NOT the financial investor in Royal Ghana Gold Refinery. As if to make that point amply clear, it has not assigned any management or board personnel to the company, and it does not appear to have been involved in the actual technical setup, seeing as it doesn’t even have the expertise in refinery management.\n\nThe current chairperson of Royal Ghana is a senior ruling party politician, well known as the party boss of the Eastern Region, from where the president and key members of his administration hail. He was presumably given the role because he also chairs the board of the PMMC.\n\nThe technical brain behind the entire operation is a certain Sandeep Chadha, a consultant at Rare Tech Projects. Rare Tech is a tiny boutique general management consultancy based in New Delhi, India. It has an omnivorous appetite that has seen it get involved in representing agents in nearly every business opportunity under the sun, from textiles to health equipment.\n\nNo footprint whatsoever of any “Rosy Royal Minerals” entity can be traced through or in the setup, funding, and current operations of Royal Ghana Gold Refinery.\n\nWhich raises the fat, round, and voluptuous question: who exactly owns the 80% stake in Ghana’s “first” commercial gold refinery? For whose benefit are the impending monopolistic gold refining privileges intended?\n\n[This is a developing story.]\n\nA few days ago, I decided to catch up with Tullow Ghana Ltd, a company some of us in the policy community keep an eye on because it is Ghana’s largest oil producer and the only company that has put any serious money in the country’s upstream petroleum sector in the last five or so years.\n\nI saw that an upset in its plans to take forward its Lake Turkana project in Kenya has extended the lackluster performance of its share price on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nI then thought to check the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE), where Tullow debuted in 2011 with 0.45% of its outstanding shares valued about $73 million. When I checked, those same shares today would be worth about $2.7 million. Colossal erosion of value for long-term Ghanaian investors. More curious, though, is the fact that the share price hasn’t moved since 2018 and is locked at about 60 British pence despite the same stock now selling for less than 30 pence in London.\n\nThis random episode made me think about Ghana’s stock market in general, and how it is keeping faith with the country’s investor community.\n\nThe challenges that bedevil sub-Saharan African stock exchanges outside South Africa are well known. Low liquidity, low issuances, low subscriptions, low trading, low capitalisation…etc. etc. But there was a time when Ghana’s stock market was widely believed to be destined for greatness.\n\nGreat Expectations at the birth of GSE\n\nIn 1994, four years after it was set up (in November 1990) with just 11 companies and a single corporate bond, its 124% annual index growth catapulted it to the attention of global analysts as the best “emerging stock market” in the world. The magical event that year was the listing of Ashanti Goldfields. Market capitalisation shot up to nearly 2 billion dollars, a grand 35% of GDP, 88% of which was contributed by Ashanti, heavily skewing average capitalisation per listed company to about $110 million.\n\nSadly, 1994 marked an early peak of the market. The likes of Ashanti Gold was never to be seen again.\n\nAs should be evident from the graph above, the market has seen some other short-run bull-charges, or limited periods of exciting performance, since 1994. A decade after the 1994 fiesta, the GSE was once more sprang to the front of the global queue of top performers. Year-on-year market capitalisation growth that year was an eye-popping 673%. Annual index growth was 91.32%. And total trading value hit 657 billion cedis.\n\nA major trigger for this surge in activity was the record four Initial Public offerings (IPOs) of pharmaceutical pioneer, Starwin; spunky ICT innovator, Clydestone; CalBank; and Benso Oil Palm Plantation. On top of this, listed companies had successful rights issues, multiple investment schemes came to market, and Ashanti Gold closed its merger with AngloGold. Recall also that this was at the height of the whole “Golden Age of Business” giddiness. In fact, in that same 2004, Ghana hit the “floating completion point” of HIPC, after creditors provided “assurances” of debt relief confirming that Ghana was on course to meeting the terms of the program. Business confidence was booming.\n\nThat is not all, 2004 was also the year that Ghana’s first Central Securities Depositary was set up, simplifying the most critical aspects of trading shares on the market such as settlement, even though automation had still not been done, a whole 14 years after launch.\n\nThe last time the GSE would experience another miraculous run was also about a decade later, in 2013, just before the 2014 financial downturn. Index growth for that year nearly hit 80%. Once again, the trigger was a confluence of positive events.\n\nA hard act to follow\n\nEach truly spectacular change in market sentiment has, thus, been the product of several positive developments coming together. One might construe, therefore, that Ghana’s stock market only sees stellar performance on a “happy happenstance” basis, rather than on the back of durable secular trends.\n\nAlmost all the critical benchmark indicators like market capitalisation/GDP, turnover ratio (or the Hui-Heubel measure, a measure of liquidity), total value traded/GDP, etc. have all, from 2014 onwards, been on a downward slope, with a few punctuated moments of joy at long intervals.\n\nThere is no controversy in saying then that, since 2014, the performance of the GSE has been rather lackluster. For example, at the tail-end of the 2004 bull-run, market capitalisation was $10.8 billion. When I checked at the close of market last Friday, the equivalent number was $6 billion, less than 10% of current GDP (the global domestic average market cap is about 77% of GDP as of 2022). Adjusting by the number of listed equities, and US dollar inflation, the GSE’s market capitalisation today is at 1994 levels.\n\nGhana’s star dimmed a while back\n\nEven by African standards, Ghana’s current situation is not exciting. Between 1992 and 2018, African stock markets saw their capitalisation rise from $113 billion to nearly $1.15 trillion. Ghana could only achieve half of this growth rate. Today it sits at the top of the bottom half of regional rankings.\n\nThe low market cap is not helped by the fact that companies keep dropping off. The number of equities listed on the main exchange is now 31 (counting the two Stanchart equities as one), down from 37 in 2016. The shocking implication here is that since its founding, just one company enters the main exchange every two years.\n\nThere is of course a connection among turnover, market participation, and overall stock price sensitivity. After checking Tullow’s stock performance on Friday, I decided to take a peep at Atlantic Lithium, another company whose slow business strategy execution has lost it some market momentum in recent months. Whilst the stock is trading at just above 17 US cents in London, it is still stuck at 38 US cents in Accra, obviously due to the super thin trading volume. It seems that rather than a confluence of positive developments being on the horizon, mediocrity is cementing.\n\nThe early hopes of glory have simply not panned out. The GSE’s fate has been to join the mediocre ranks of sub-Saharan Africa’s struggling stock exchanges.\n\nAny hopes for revival\n\nWhat, really, can be done to spice up activity on the GSE? Get more companies listing, get more people trading, and see more share issuances, and eventually complex derivatives that will further drive liquidity and capitalisation growth?\n\nObviously, overall economic growth and improvements in business culture sophistication should help. As should macroeconomic rationalisation. When debt is returning at 30% to 60%, equities, usually considered more risky, must yield in the 100% range to be truly exciting. What kinds of businesses are going to be able to promise future growth at those levels to whet investor appetites?\n\nBut that cannot be all. Egypt has a larger economy than South Africa but as is evident from the graph above, South Africa is way ahead in terms of stock market activity. Tanzania, Zambia, and Kenya all have a more sophisticated economy than Malawi, but that little Southern African economy has often given them a run for their money. And Rwanda is clearly punching above its weight. These facts show lucidly that there could be factors endogenous to the capital markets that require further study.\n\nIt has not been for lack of trying, though\n\nBut let’s be fair, it is not as if the government of Ghana and the Ghana Stock Exchange aren’t aware of these challenges or haven’t made efforts to address them. In 2000, the government lowered corporate tax from 35% to 30% for GSE listed companies to attract more listings. That advantage has been wiped away by recent across the board drops in the rate of corporate tax, but it was there for quite a bit. Long before then, the government had granted tax exemptions on capital gains (profits made from trading on the stock exchange). That policy has been renewed in five year cycles until it was suspended during the “IMF return” period in 2015. The GSE is in active negotiations to make this a more longer-term affair.\n\nUnlike is the case with the once popular fixed income market, foreigners are free to invest without strictures in stocks on the GSE (except in regulated industries where certain levels of ownership require prior approval). The government is also currently compelling companies in certain strategic sectors like mining to list a minimum of 20% of their outstanding shares on the Exchange.\n\nIn short, whilst there has been some inconsistencies in providing incentives, one cannot accuse successive governments of not caring about capital market development.\n\nGSE Management does know what they are doing\n\nAt the level of management, the GSE is now run by one of the most formidable corporate operators in the country, whose knowledge of the market and the formal corporate sector is virtually peerless. At last count, she has engaged dozens of interest groups and “stakeholders”, as we like to say in Ghana, to boost listings by small and medium businesses (SMEs) on the lower tier of the Exchange (known as the Ghana Alternative Market – GAX), moving beyond the original marketing strategy. MOUs have been signed to encourage groups and associations that interface with high-performing SMEs to consider listing on the GAX to benefit from the less stringent criteria and compliance burden, and of course the prospect of raising equity capital in an environment where interest rates for their segment regularly tops 40%. Despite all this effort, the number of GAX-listed companies have stubbornly stayed below 6 since the GAX’s creation in 2013.\n\nNot to be deterred, the current management has launched a new regulated off-market trading platform for companies that do not wish to list at all, even on the GAX. Such trading is meant to boost liquidity in illiquid assets, whilst also giving prospective capital market actors a taste of the stock market.\n\nThe GSE has also jumped on all the fashionable bandwagons: green bonds, sustainability-linked indices, ESG, and ETFs, etc. Working in partnership with the World Bank’s private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), it has launched a framework for issuance of these novel financial instruments in Ghana.\n\nIt is just a very hard nut to crack\n\nMy survey of the situation suggest that all these developments are failing to make a serious dent in the market apathy problem. Whilst the recent bull run (46.5% year-to-date composite index return) is being celebrated to the high heavens by the financial press, the truth, as outlined in previous passages, is that, judged in historical terms, there has been no progress at all. On a share of GDP basis, the GSE market cap growth level today is less than 30% of the performance in 1994, in 2004 (even on a rebased GDP basis) and in 2013. In absolute terms, the $6 billion market capitalisation figure being trumpeted today compares very unfavourably with the ~$30 billion attained over a decade ago.\n\nThe results are similar if one compares the value of trading a decade ago to today’s. In 2013, total annual value traded was in the region of about $225 million. In 2023, the equivalent number was barely $72 million. Even using the best year by far of the decade, 2022, still yields a value traded figure of about $170 million, considerably lower than its historical peaks more than a decade prior.\n\nThe failure of equity markets in Ghana has had a devastating impact on the investment industry as a whole. The poor performance of mutual funds, unit trusts, and other collective investment schemes, including perennial liquidity challenges, has contributed in no small measure to the rampant distrust that has built up among financial consumers. The resultant overdependence of savers on fixed deposits at fantastic rates from the non-bank deposit taking players that resulted contributed to the massacre of the so-called “clean ups”. The country needs diversity of investment channels for savers to induce resilience in the financial system.\n\nThere may be a path, just maybe…\n\nIt is not hard to tell from how I have written about the subject so far that I do not accept the neo-Marxist claim that stock markets are a Western, neo-colonial, imposition on Africa. I have, however, began to wonder if the ideas of joint stock companies, split ownership, and share trading, and the high levels of disclosure required for all of these, sit well with our culture of doing business.\n\nIt is clear that until the recent domestic debt restructuring debacle, the Ghana Fixed Income Market was soaring with a consistency that must have been the envy of the equities players.\n\nMy intuition, fortified by limited research, is that debt is much more compatible with our capital infrastructure and business culture at this point in our economic development. The sophistication of transferability, securitisation, and other capital market techniques could probably be stretched further for the SME segment of the investment spectrum if the likes of the GSE were willing to get more creative with debt instruments than with equities. Unfortunately, the standard GFIM window at the GSE is much too stuffy for the SME sector.\n\nIt seems to me that rather than investing in the GAX as the primary strategy to create a high-throughput feeder and pipeline for the main index, the smart approach is to explore creative venture debt instruments targeted at SMEs in the new over-the-counter segment.\n\nAs a honey-trap to get the SMEs slowly acclimatised to the idea of listing, my sense, crude though it may be, is that this might be more seductive than share-listing, regardless of compliance burden. The marketing would, however, need to be way more camper than we have seen with the GAX. The right narratives, stripped of alienating jargon, and the right endorsement strategies would need to be explored for this to work. Much can be learnt from the halting steps to introduce crowd investment into Africa, which effort, unfortunately, has so far been stymied due to lack of institutional investor interest.\n\nAnd, of course, cut and paste would simply not suit our environment, so engaging with the hubs and entrepreneurial networks that have sprawled all over Ghana and the near-abroad to get a deeper, anthropological, sense of what makes that whole ecosystem tick would be essential if a venture debt platform backed by the stock market and Ghana’s securities industry would have traction as a long-term booster of a more diversified capital market.\n\nPost-script\n\nTo trigger some conversation, I sent this essay in its initial form to a few Ghana Market Specialists. I shall be appending some of their reactions below. [Disclaimer: the views expressed by the experts and specialists below are entirely their own, and do not reflect any institutional positions or those of this author.]\n\nEP:\n\nYou don’t need to dig into anthropology or Marxism to see why GSE has failed. GSE has failed as it does not provide investors with returns or liquidity and has failed to provide companies with access to capital on acceptable terms. Reasons are:\n\n1. No investor has faith in the integrity of company accounts. Our accounting firms commit malfeasance, and are never held accountable;\n\n2. ⁠Trading charges are too high, at 2% of value, compare to LSE’s 0.08%;\n\n3. ⁠SEC rules are burdensome, opaque, selectively enforced, and SEC has never been held accountable for malfeasance or worked to any objective standard;\n\n4. Company managements have routinely gotten away with fraud and misconduct;\n\n5. ⁠As the state is predatory, having public accounts just invites predation from Government actors;\n\n6. ⁠GSE management is inept, does not work to any quantified standard, and cares only for their own status and incomes. And this is not just me asserting it, a 3rd party study was commissioned that said exactly that.\n\nVoila.\n\nWM:\n\nWhat I would have loved to see is the relationship between stock market performance and the confidence investors (both domestic and foreign) have in the future of the economy. Your analysis of stock market activity not necessarily correlating with size is apt, but the missing link is its implied signal of investor confidence and expectation of the general economy.\n\nKN:\n\nAdditional attention must be paid to the deleterious socio- and macroeconomic policies and how these lead to almost all businesses resorting to survival mode behavior. An equity market by its very construct cannot accommodate such damaging policies. As a result, almost all the notable listings over the past 3 decades down to MTN recently have been regulatory driven.\n\nBA:\n\nI have an alternative take on your assessment of government incentives. None of these governments actually appreciates the immense value a well developed capital market brings to an economy. Like most things, I don’t even think there is an understanding of or a conscious strategy for capital formation in the Ghanaian economy; is it to be banking sector-led or capital markets driven, or a blend, wiser.\n\nThey just pay lip service to the capital markets, using it only opportunistically, like when they saw they could borrow billions in treasury bonds 2012?-2022. They have just been sleep walking through it. Review fiscal and monetary policy statements back 20 years, and you would see the laughably sketchy commentary or references to the capital markets. No consciousness about the impact of policies on savings in the economy, investment incentives, returns, private sector financing, market development, growth. The only thing they say is they would finance x% of deficit from the domestic market. Nothing about developing a long term attractive market domestic investors and portfolio investors. The private sector can’t achieve much quickly in changing the GSE; it needs governments that actually understand the value of the capital markets in the broader economy, beyond their narrow budget financing needs.\n\nI looked at total CIT tax paid by all the non-listed banks, etc. recently. Not much vs potential benefits of likely increased investment by the banks from retained earnings, more employment, higher personal income tax collection, other socio-economic benefits, etc, if these banks were incentivized with tax holidays to list on the GSE.\n\nA larger GSE highlights Ghana to fund managers globally, a Nestle listing would potentially attract a fund manager, in say Hong Kong looking for Nestle SA, leads to increased FX inflow, etc. All these multinationals and Nigerian banks listed in their home countries and other markets are not listed in Ghana, artificially deflating Ghana market size.\n\nGovernments have to work with cost-benefit analyses of fiscal incentives in the budgets to support the development of the capital markets. Who knows? Just collecting corporate taxes from 15 non-listed banks annually may be better than encouraging them to list, losing tax revenue for a few years but generating NPV+ economic benefits through employment, investment, wider impact, etc. No evidence that the governments are thinking along these lines.\n\nIn December 2021, Ghana’s Attorney General started prosecuting the Opposition parliamentarian (MP) giving the government its biggest headaches in the powerful finance committee mandated with clearing the government’s budget. As the “ranking member” of the committee, the MP was the Opposition’s point man on finance matters and was critical to holding the lines against approval of the 2022 budget.\n\nWas the man guilty?\n\nComing in the wake of the government’s biggest second-term crisis in the newly split parliament, the prosecution was immediately condemned by some independent analysts, myself included, as pure political persecution and an attempt to undermine democratic accountability. It was apparent then, as it is now, that the MP had been unfairly targeted, and some of us said so.\n\nLast week, the Court of Appeal issued a majority decision that more or less vindicated the persecution theory, and acquitted the MP, overturning an earlier decision by the High Court that his trial should proceed because the prosecution had established a prima facie case. For many of us, this was a resounding blow for democratic accountability.\n\nDuring the two and half years of the trial, commentators like myself have sparred over the MP’s liability in issuing a letter of credit (LC) as a payment guarantee to facilitate the delivery of 30 ambulances, abandoned since 2015 for not meeting specifications.\n\nWe have contended that anyone who understands the risk management features embedded in an LC would not mount a prosecution seeking to make an LC requester criminally liable for “causing financial loss” as a result of failures in an underlying transaction to which he was a mere bystander. The majority of the Appeal Court panel concurred.\n\nAnother issue of contention had been whether the accused opposition MP issued the LC without “due cause and authorisation”. Using an interpretation of an arcane aspect of Ghanaian case law, the High Court ruled that the burden of proving that he had authorisation rested with the accused because the government had framed their case in the negative (i.e. that he had no authorisation) and the factualness or otherwise of that claim was one best known to the accused. Of course, this is entirely philosophical. One could simply argue that the position of the accused is that he “did not act without authorisation”, which would be as “negative” a framing as “he did not have authorisation”. A similar reframing is possible for the prosecution’s position as well. How does such “burden shifting” in this specific instance, though, improve on the classical notion that the one laying the charge should prove?\n\nIn any event, in the public service, whether or not an actor has authorisation for an action is a matter of administrative record, and the government, in this case also the prosecution, is the keeper of records. This is not something that could be said to lie only within the personal knowledge of the accused or even his boss at the time, the substantive Minister of Finance, who was bizarrely not called to testify. The majority of the Appeal Court saw things in similar light.\n\nBut if he wasn’t, who is?\n\nAll this back and forth over what seems to be technical jousting and legal jargon has left some people frustrated. The prosecution was derived from an actual criminal investigation commenced four years earlier, in mid-2017. Thirty ambulances were imported into the country. Under some bizarre circumstances, they were declared unfit. About $2.6 million (EUR 2.37 million) were paid for them. What most people are keen to understand is simple: has there really been a financial loss to Ghana or not, and who is actually responsible? All this jargon-lading wordplay irks them. It comes across as another elite scheme to evade true accountability.\n\nAnother one for “State Enchantment”\n\nIn this short piece, I want to draw my readers away from the technical stuff and refocus on the actual financial loss to Ghana. None of my regular readers would be shocked if I start off with my usual refrain of “state enchantment“. This ambulance saga manifests all that is wrong about what governance has become in Ghana.\n\nKnowing that no rational citizen will quibble if the government says that improving ambulatory care in the country is its mission, politicians have merely been hiding behind enhancing ambulance services, a “glorious” national objective, to dispense cash to cronies.\n\nThe criminal investigation commenced in 2017, but it was conveniently forgotten until the government needed a stick to beat the Opposition MP. From the outset, it was merely a cynical ploy to undermine an existing procurement program in order to benefit business cronies of the ruling party. To buttress these charges, let’s start at the beginning.\n\nAmbling through Ghana’s ambulance history\n\nAfter the stadium crisis of 2001, the appalling state of ambulance services in Ghana was pushed into the limelight. The government commenced work to develop a national ambulance program aimed at transforming a landscape that was at that time highly fragmented. A few hospitals and clinics, mostly private, had some ambulances, but there was nothing like a national emergency hotline that one could call to request one if in mortal peril. In 2004, the National Ambulance Service was created and a pilot with 9 ambulances was started.\n\nAs with all policies in Ghana, and I say this with a great deal of consternation, nothing moves unless the procurement opportunities are clear. Thus, between 2006 and 2012, things moved very slowly. Only about 33 ambulances were active over the period.\n\nIn Ghana, “everything is procurement”\n\nThen, in 2010, Universal Motors, a major car dealership in Ghana, saw an opportunity to make some good money whilst contributing to an obvious social good. It approached the government with a comprehensive proposal, complete with a funding source.\n\nUniversal Motors would import 161 Volkswagen T5 and Crafter base vans from its manufacturing partner, Volkswagen, in Germany to begin with. With a 10 million Euro facility, KfW-IPEX would finance a conversion of the base vans by engaging a specialist German company, Wietmarscher Ambulanz und Sonderfahrzeug GmbH. Voila, ambulances! Because of Ghana’s tendency to struggle with debt, the German Export Credit Facility, EulerHermes came on board to provide insurance cover.\n\nBut there have been simpler times\n\nThe Mills era was a simpler time in Ghana. Hence, this transaction sailed through relatively uneventfully and Ghana’s ambulance stock rose from 33 to 199. The casual reader would have missed several important issues raised by this transaction, which, however, merits attention.\n\nThe local company involved was the authorised distributor of the vans. The funding source was a development finance organisation with a long pedigree in financing public goods. The fact that a so-called “bilateral partner”, the German government to be precise, was involved meant that the funding was also concessional. Of course, it also meant that German companies had to benefit massively.\n\nUntil Ghana’s oil production gathered steam and the country doubled up on Eurobonds, transactions like this one were very common and they often run to a successful commercial close, even if the paperwork was always tedious and there was a tinge of “foreign interference” all over.\n\nThe involvement of Paris Club/OECD type governments in Ghana’s affairs is much resented by the sophisticated elite for its neocolonialist carryover, but it has had a predictable rhythm about it. Usually, well-established companies must be found. Paperwork must be thorough. And, vitally, a plan must exist to cover the basics.\n\nThe times are a-changing\n\nAs the country grew richer, political decision-makers began to have more resources in hand to move away from this model and experiment more. What could have been hailed as a great breakaway from neocolonialism however increasingly began to take the form with which we are now familiar.\n\nSoon after the arrival of the 161 ambulances, steps commenced to bring in more. Ghanaian experts advised the government that the country should aim for at least 1000 ambulances. But instead of relying on authorised distributors, manufacturer-authorised convertors, careful transaction structuring, and the like, creative experimentation with procurement entrepreneurs was in vogue. That is how come the next time a proposal arrived at the presidential complex to supply 200 ambulances from Jakpa@Business, this time around, everything was commercial. The bank involved was Stanbic, which was up for 15.8 million Euros. The van supplier was a company identified as “Big Sea General Trading Limited”, hardly a household name.\n\nThe pure commerciality of the transaction meant that the cost of the loan was 4% above the Eurobor rate. There were no development finance institutions to insist on insurance cover. And there was certainly no German government to ask uncomfortable questions about policy alignment and all that boring stuff. Furthermore, in this brave new world of procurement entrepreneurship, the state-business environment had become more competitive. Business actors backed by different political factions were constantly scheming and plotting.\n\nThe Order of Policy Confusion\n\nWhen pursuant to the contract with Big Sea, the first tranche of 10 ambulances arrived, the reception party was pure confusion. Showing incredible resilience, the owner of Jakpa@Business, Big Sea’s local agent, continued to press. A further 20 ambulances were brought in. The Ministry of Health was at this point wracked by competing interests.\n\nIn the midst of the confusion, pre-shipment inspections were not done. The conversion process was delayed, and the conversion modules (the equipment used in transforming ambulances) were stuck at the port. Whilst the essential pieces had been procured, including Mercedes Benz 311 vans (more robust than the 309 versions contemplated in the contract) and conversion kits, project management essentials were completely derailed by a dysfunctional policy environment in which ministries, agencies, contractors, and the cabinet itself, were clearly misaligned.\n\nFour years is how long it took for all this drama to play out. Four years. But by late 2016, after a raft of court cases, an Attorney General opinion, threats to sue for breach of contract, and a changing of the guard in ministerial ranks, a settlement had been reached and the conversion of the 30 ambulances could proceed so that the rest of the contract could be executed. No money really needed to be lost from this point onwards. Then governments changed on 7th December 2016.\n\nNew King, New Law\n\nDespite the entreaties of Jakpa@Business and Big Sea, the new government would have nothing to do with the ambulances for reasons that shall soon become clear.\n\nIt is important to note here that, on paper, the Big Sea ambulance transaction followed the same essential technical template as the Universal Motors one. Eligible base vans are procured from a reputable manufacturer like Mercedes or Volkswagen. A company that specialises in outfitting vans into ambulances is contracted. And then the requisite inspections, validations, trainings, and handovers are performed. The diligent reader can examine sample protocols used in the most advanced countries for a grasp of the essentials. The attempts that have been made in recent times to suggest that the Big Sea procurements were inherently technically flawed are pure propaganda.\n\nWhat is true is that the way governance is done in Ghana had started changing dramatically between the two transactions making implementation of the Big Sea ambulance project more likely to fail due to far more aggressive political-commercial interests than Ghana has historically known in the Fourth Republic.\n\nAs soon as the new government was sworn into office, it started working on its “own” ambulance procurement scheme. Even though only 55 ambulances were functional by 2019, the government refused to engage Big Sea and Jakpa@Business to complete the ambulance conversion and validation process under the terms of the updated settlement. The 30 imported ambulances were left to rot.\n\nHaving crafted a “One Constituency One Ambulance” (OCOA) manifesto promise ahead of the 2016 elections, the country’s entire ambulatory care policy was now held hostage to the current flavour of partisan politics in which every government policy must also be thoroughly commercialised for the benefit of political favourites in the business realm. The more upstart these favourites are, the better.\n\nBy May 2018, the mushroom ministry set up to advance the OCOA scheme had already made arrangements for 109 ambulances.\n\nBy 2020, 309 new ambulances, based on the same Mercedes Sprinter Van 311 models as the Big Sea ones, had been procured. If the reader is paying attention, they would no doubt have noticed that at no point during this period had any attempts been made to hold Big Sea and/or Jakpa@Business, or indeed any former public servant, liable for any infractions. The government was too busy trying to forget that the country had signed a contract for 200 ambulances for which funding had been ratified by the Parliament itself.\n\nIt is only getting interesting: Enter Luxury World\n\nIn keeping with my belief that in Ghana anytime a new negative trend is discovered, it can only get worse, the procurement entrepreneurship hustle had, by 2020, attained proportions of unbelievable perversity, enriched as it were by state enchantment. In true form, the procurement activities surrounding the One Constituency One Ambulance (OCOA) scheme have been truly fetid.\n\nSomehow, companies claiming to have participated in a competitive tender ended up forming a consortium to execute the OCOA deal, clear and ample evidence of collusion and bid-rigging.\n\nSomehow, this “consortium” has also managed to wring from the hands of the National Ambulance Service (NAS) the lucrative servicing and maintenance mandate even though it has been using the staff and some of the facilities of the same NAS. A member of the consortium called “Luxury World Autogroup”, rather than the consortium that purportedly holds the contracts, has become the primary service provider to the NAS. Virtually all garage contracts now go to Luxury World.\n\nThere is always a shadowy character lurking in the nooks\n\nBut who is behind Luxury World? A colourful figure with a string of convictions in the United Kingdom and noted for frequent brushes with the law in Ghana. Someone supposedly under investigation by the EOCO, the country’s organised crime agency, for forging invoices related to spare parts for the same ambulance program. This very individual is currently in court fighting another politically connected individual believed to have helped broker some of the deals with the government. In the court proceedings, he is alleging the use of national security operatives to harass and molest him and his staff. So much drama! You literally couldn’t make it up!\n\nMeanwhile, ambulance services continue to sink\n\nThe government of Ghana continues to borrow heavily to sustain these procurement-juicy schemes. Yet, the actual policy for ensuring that these ambulances deliver effectively for the people has never had much attention. Over the years, funding for the actual operations of the ambulance service from the government has dried up.\n\nEven as the central government continues to funnel millions of dollars into the pockets of connected political “procurepreneurs”, it is now responsible for less than 3% of the funding that goes into the actual running of the ambulances. Patients now expect to pay before ambulances are dispatched to them against the clear provisions of the law. The government is unable to procure insurance cover for all the ambulances, which means that a serious breakdown often requires decommissioning or, even worse, poorly advertised auction to crony bidders.\n\nWorse still, ongoing parliamentary inquiries by a crusading MP suggest that the invoice inflation problem is not confined to the Chief Executive of Luxury World. It is systemic and rampant in the One Ambulance One Constituency program, and that tallied altogether the cost of these infractions and cost-inflation may exceed $20 million so far.\n\nBut isn’t all this natural for “emerging” nations?\n\nFor those readers who may be tempted into believing that all this procureneurship and state-business enchantment stuff are standard play in the evolution of modern nations, I will urge you to think again. It is true that in the industrial transformation of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and the few Asian countries that have grown their economies the fastest from the last century to date, state-business entanglements were par for the course.\n\nWhat is happening in Ghana, however, is nothing like the very deliberate efforts to build capacity within the domestic private sector, with kickbacks to the political class paid out from productivity gains, that occurred in the most dynamic Asian states. In Ghana’s model, there is no serious capacity building or medium-term productivity gains. The disorganised process proceeds in fits and starts, with random beneficiaries, and the siphoning of public funds ultimately into foreign hands since the business actors in the rackets barely learn to add serious value.\n\nRemembrance of things colonial\n\nBut back to ambulances. The funny thing in all of this is that even in colonial times, Ghana had an organised ambulance service, albeit one with British imperial baggage: the St John Ambulance Ghana service, a mission chartered by law after independence.\n\nToday, Ghana is the only major Commonwealth African country where St. John Ambulance no longer routinely operate ambulance services. Contrast this situation with that of Kenya, for instance, where St John doesn’t only continue to run ambulances but is even in talks to set up a major dispatch facility backed by the government.\n\nHaving been denied the public funds due them by convention, St John Ambulance in Ghana has now been reduced to offering first aid training and hiring vans for the occasional intervention. Their decades of experience in ambulance management and global connections have never been properly tapped by any government in the Fourth Republic.\n\nIt is much too easy to say that in the recent ambulance prosecution saga, we should simply focus on holding to account the individuals who caused the supposed loss of ~$2.6 million. The question, after reading all the above, dear reader, is whom would you charge for “causing financial loss” to Ghana?\n\nA number of community activist groups in Nzemaland, in Southwestern Ghana, are currently in discussions with civil society organisations like IMANI and ACEP about their options in a situation where the government of Ghana is masterminding a landgrab against their economic rights.\n\nThe origin of their grievance lies in a 20,000-acre territory within the Domunli enclave in the municipal area of Jomoro, that is being appropriated by the government for a “Petroleum Hub”. Initiated in 2018, the Petro-Hub was supposed to be completed by 2030. Six years on, and after many false starts, a sudden flurry of activity seems to be focused on nationalising what is currently communal land for the benefit of a group of shady investors.\n\nPhase one of the project, which by the original project timeline should have been 80% completed by now but hasn’t even started, covers the most ecologically sensitive portions of the landscape, like the Domunli Lagoon and the entire seashore.\n\nZoning analysis of the project show that economically important coconut plantations and micro-industries based on a regional coconut value chain, as well as communal farms, are bound to be destroyed if the Petroleum Hub project proceeds. Two communities (Kabenle-Suazo and Bokakole Nkwanta) would be completely relocated elsewhere in Nzemaland, while an additional five communities would require special interventions to deal with the upheaval to their lives.\n\nThe multibillion-dollar investment plan\n\nIn terms of the actual phase one infrastructure, the following were planned: a 300,000 barrels-per-day oil refinery; one million cubic meters of petroleum products storage; a number of petrochemical plants to supply urea, ammonium, and other agrochemical inputs; and a sea jetty and port facilities. Of course, these massive pieces of infrastructure would require access roads, utilities, and a wide array of other amenities to support the emerging townships of skilled and not so skilled labourers to be employed at the Petro-Hub. The pricetag? Roughly $12 billion, or 20% of the total cost of the Petro-Hub as a whole. Land requirement? About 30% of the total appropriated land.\n\nLandgrab in process\n\nNzemaland activists have been extremely agitated of late as word got around that the President of Ghana shall, any moment from now, issue an Executive Instrument vesting the 20,000 acres of communal land in the State for onward transfer to the Special Purpose Vehicle commercialising the Petro-Hub. Their agitation is well informed by a tragic history of communal land being “compulsorily acquired” by the state for one thing and eventually finding their way into the hands of politically connected speculators and crony entrepreneurs to be used for an entirely different thing.\n\nFive main laws empower the government to take over land belonging to communities for uses purportedly in the public interest. Among these are the State Lands Act and the Administration of Lands Act. All of these laws were passed in rapid succession in the early 1960s (though some have been amended since then) when large-scale industrialisation and commercial agriculture were principal elements of national development plans. Whilst the state does pay compensation to individuals, most of whom are usually not represented by legal counsel, whose properties fall within acquired lands, the communal element often receives no attention. Contrast this with how some European communities bargain for strategic compensation that ensure longer-term benefits.\n\nGhana’s conscience is pockmarked by an endless litany of lands seized by the government for botched projects that were eventually transferred into private hands. The Achimota Forest debacle is merely the best known. Lands initially appropriated for meteorological use were leased for peanuts to private property developers. Lands once allotted for aeronautical and aviation purposes now feature luxury condos built by profiteering speculators. And so on and so forth. So crazy is this situation that the Office of the Special Prosecutor is treating the issue as one of systemic corruption.\n\nIn societies where this canker is recognised for the tumour it really is, aggressive laws and special courts have been set up to block land grabbing by both politically connected real estate speculators as well as by government agencies and officials that hide behind the “eminent domain” doctrine to divert public land to well camouflaged cronies. India is one such country.\n\nWhile the courts are wising up to these perverse schemes around the world and clamping down on some of the most egregious instances (in Kenya, Sierra Leone, and West Papua, for instance), there is major room for a more creative approach to compensating communities for the risks they take when these projects come along.\n\nGive the people their cut!\n\nThe Petro-Hub case throws into stark relief the general refusal to consider communities that provide land holdings to support commercial projects as actual equity holders in the project. There is really no rational reason why community stakeholders are typically seen as having only moral stakes and being mere obstacles to be removed after perfunctory compensation. In Canada and other places where indigenous communities have organised, equity stakes are no longer even considered creative. They are par for the course.\n\nIn the case of Nzemaland, this essay will introduce an important dimension: risk.\n\nNzema activists believe that their people in the affected enclaves deserve more than just bare equity. They deserve equity that reflects the risks they are taking in the project. They are contributing highly valued land, 20,000 acres of it, which if fairly valued should be worth billions of dollars.\n\nAs Takoradi becomes saturated, the Jomoro area is poised to become an overflow buffer for residential, commercial, industrial, and recreational developments. That land is damn valuable. Investing the land in the Petro-Hub project entails the use of financial appraisal techniques that respect standard prudential norms on risk.\n\nIn short, the community is looking at its risk-adjusted returns. Carefully considered, anything less than a very large percentage stake in a Petro-Hub SPV set up to distribute returns from the joint investments equitably among all the partners, including the government and the good people of Nzema, would fall short. What are these risks, by the way?\n\nOperational Risk\n\nThe central logic of the petro-hub concept is expressed in the “strategic environmental assessment” prepared by Ghana’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as follows:\n\nCurrently, it takes a minimum of two weeks to ship petroleum products from Petroleum Hubs in\n\nEurope, Asia, and the Americas into the sub-region and in case of a crisis, the sub-region would have\n\nno security of supply. From Ghana, a vessel can easily reach any of the countries in the sub-region\n\nwithin forty-eight (48) hours. This situation makes Ghana an ideal destination for the development of\n\na Petroleum Hub.\n\nWhile at first glance this argument would appear to hold water, it actually leaks badly. There is literally no country on the coast of West Africa that cannot make similar geographic-advantage claims. How then does this become a serious edge for Ghana? Nor is it clear how the landlocked countries fit into this 48-hour delivery window without additional railway networks. Building out a hub with such lofty operational benchmarks creates many tripwires for failure.\n\nCommercial/Demand risk\n\nAs described above, the Petro-Hub will host three refineries with a combined capacity of 900,000 barrels per day and aim to supply 50% of the projected fuel demand in the West African region within the 2030 – 2035 timeframe.\n\nThe current total refinery capacity in West Africa is estimated by the project’s planners at about 500,000 barrels per day. Dangote’s new refinery, the recently completed Sentuo refinery in Ghana, and the planned MEDOIL refinery in Senegal, among others, should easily increase this number to anything from 1.3 million to 1.5 million barrels per day, roughly 150% of regional consumption in the near-term. Nigeria, which consumes 70% of total refined product output in the region has a protectionist mindset, no doubt reinforced by the politics surrounding the commissioning of Dangote’s refinery. In such circumstances, any refinery hub based in Ghana should struggle to sell into regional demand.\n\nEnvironmental risk\n\nEven though the zoning plans envisage buffers for the Domunli lagoon, leakages and waste treatment failures would not be contained by buffers as we have all seen in the Niger Delta where marshland protective regimes are regularly breached. The exceptional biodiversity wealth of the region faces clear and critical dangers that are not sufficiently addressed by planned mitigation measures.\n\nScepticism about the enforcement capacity of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the broader regulatory state is vindicated by the fact that the government is already in breach of recommendations made by its own regulators. The EPA’s Strategic Environmental Assessment states as follows:\n\n“Due to inadequate resources, the baseline survey on fauna and flora within the Petroleum Hub\n\nconducted by the EPA was incomplete. It is advised that the PHDC provide funding to the EPA to\n\ncomplete the baseline studies which will be useful to guide other developments in the enclave.”\n\nThis author’s inquiries suggest that the government has still not complied.\n\nAgain, in the same assessment, the EPA recommended as follows:\n\n“It is advised that a comprehensive Emergency Response and Risk management plan should be prepared and operationalized before the commencement of operational activities.”\n\nThe author’s checks could not confirm that this recommendation has been followed. Clearly, the community cannot just hope to God that such a lackadaisical attitude will change with the onset of commercial operations.\n\nCounterparty Reputational Risk\n\nThe Energy Ministry and the Petroleum Hub Development Corporation (PHDC) have paraded a group of investors as the sponsors of phase one of the Petro-Hub expected to cost $12 billion. The so-called TCP-UIC consortium is made up of the following players: UIC Energy Ghana Limited, Touchstone Capital Group Holdings, China Wuhan Engineering Co. Ltd, and China Construction Third Engineering Bureau Co. Ltd.\n\nUIC presents itself as a kind of diversified conglomerate but it has so far become better known for signing multibillion dollar government-backed infrastructure deals that simply fail to materialise. As the directing mind of the consortium, UIC hasn’t really positioned itself as having the resources to execute. It has created the impression that the other members of the consortium will bear the brunt of fundraising. For that reason alone, it is best to ignore them. For now.\n\nBoth China Construction Third Engineering Bureau Co. Ltd (part of a Chinese construction giant) and China Wuhan Engineering Co. Ltd are Chinese “policy contractors”, which do not finance projects in Africa with their own capital in exchange for equity. So long as these two contractors are involved, any project finance, if in fact secured, must come from either the client (Petroleum Hub Development Corporation or the project’s financial sponsor) or from Chinese policy banks and covered by Sinosure insurance.\n\nSo, that leaves only Touchstone Capital Group Holdings as the putative financier of the $12 billion phase one of the Petro-Hub project. Which, to put it mildly, is a serious problem.\n\nTouchstone is a hollow setup and its principal directing mind, Kenny Song, is in no position to raise billions of dollars even if he somehow found Aladdin’s lamp in a cave on the beaches of Domunli. Like UIC, Touchstone has also become noted for announcing multibillion dollar projects, involving big Chinese companies, that then, well, go nowhere, like this massive tunnel to link Helsinki, Finland to Tallinn, Estonia.\n\nNzema activists have noticed that the company’s flagship entity in the UK has been dormant for a while now, with barely any assets to its name.\n\nIn 2018, Touchstone’s only public listing, in Luxembourg, was tossed off the stock exchange after the company ceased complying with its obligations, usually a sign of grave distress.\n\nIt is not surprising then that when investigators tracked down the London office provided by Touchstone in Marylebone, it led to a shopfront for a maildrop service run by MBE.\n\nMBE maildrop services have sometimes been used by criminals and other unsavoury sorts to run scams, frauds and racketeering operations. In one particularly egregious case, Armenian gangsters used a similar MBE setup to defraud the US Medicare scheme of millions of dollars.\n\nThe TCP/UIC-led consortium is not the first funny group to attempt to grab Nzema land. Another funny troupe led by a company called, Kallo Inc, attempted to raise $150 million for a similar purpose but failed totally. Kallo Inc is the same company that announced a bizarre $795 million deal in Ghana to supply mobile clinics. How it evolved into a Petroleum Hub infrastructure sponsor a few years later is a story for another day.\n\nIn Ghana’s “everything is PR” governance culture, the Ministry of Energy feels no qualms at all about announcing another multibillion deal without explaining what happened to the $15 billion it said it raised 4 years ago when it claimed that the Petro-Hub had attracted “massive investor interest”.\n\nThe Lowdown: risk and reward\n\nIn view of all these risks, the people of Nzema cannot contribute their valuable land to the Petro-Hub project unless, like every other investor, they are rewarded with a considerable equity stake commensurate with the project’s risk profile and with full rights of participation in all decision-making including investment due diligence. Regardless whether and which investors finally come through with the funds for development of this giant asset.\n\nThe World Bank, as we all know, is about financing development to eliminate poverty. Eliminating poverty in the developing world where it is most endemic entails investing in the productive capacity of the economy to put millions in decent, empowering, nation-transforming work.\n\nIn most economies one cannot talk about “productive capacity” without talking about the private sector. Which is why the World Bank has a fully-fledged private sector arm called the International Finance Corporation (IFC).\n\nBeing an integral part of the World Bank, it is not surprising that the IFC’s twin mandate is ending extreme poverty and creating shared prosperity. As it boasts in its latest annual report, it is working towards “a more virtuous cycle — one that ends poverty, protects the planet, and creates inclusive growth.”\n\nGiven the scarcity of capital in places like Ghana, it would be strange if the IFC’s investments do not prioritise projects that build local capacity, inclusive prosperity, and structural transformation. Just like it says in its own strategy handbook.\n\nIn a portfolio of just 23 active investments in the course of the decade up to 2022, one can forgive the odd luxury mall. But within three years of investing in Accra Mall in 2012, the IFC had already approved another such investment, a $60.5 million loan for a sprawling complex called The Exchange in Ghana’s plush Airport City.\n\nCombining a luxury (Radisson Blu) hotel, luxury mall, and luxury condominium, The Exchange was touted as West Africa’s “largest mixed-use complex”. IFC’s investment came at a time when private investors were blanketing Accra with luxury shopping, residential, and hospitality facilities and when many analysts were already warning of pending oversaturation.\n\nSince investing in The Exchange, the IFC has doubled down on more luxury malls and shopping complexes, as well as condos, including a swanky aparthotel called One Oxford Street, where nightly rates routinely top $400 a night, higher than the average monthly salary of most waged workers in the country. The saturation level of luxury real estate in Accra is at a point where 80% of planned construction is now on hold.\n\nThe most curious thing about the IFC’s investment strategy in Ghana is the almost complete neglect of some key productive sectors such as agroprocessing, biotech, chemicals (especially pharmaceuticals), transportation, logistics, ICT, and human capital+skills, even though national development strategies, transformation reports, and the domestic development finance agenda prioritise these sectors. Equally curious is the organization’s aloofness where the country’s social enterprise and youth innovation ecosystems are concerned.\n\nThere is no point being coy about the IFC’s need to generate a profit. Whilst social impact is of course paramount, its DFI model requires it to also pursue a sound financial return on each investment. Could the love for luxury real estate and the seeming disdain for agrotech and social enterprises stem from sensible financial risk avoidance, seeing as even some local commercial banks tend to steer away from some of these sectors?\n\nSuch thinking, though, would constitute a lack of ambition on the IFC’s part. An organisation that returns just 1.5% on capital cannot also lack spunk. But on the issue of risk, the IFC’s investment in The Exchange shows that risk can be highly project-specific and so avoiding whole sectors as a way around it is a short-sighted strategy.\n\nIFC issued the $60 million loan for The Exchange in the name of Actis, a global investment firm focused on emerging markets that likes to tout its social impact. The prime land in the nation’s most sought-after location, the Airport City, and the entrepreneurial vision, were supplied by Mabani Seven, part of the Forewin Conglomerate. Forewin cut its teeth and made its fortune from the merchandise import trade. Mabani Seven formed an SPV with Actis and the British private equity firm, CDC, and took a 49% stake in The Exchange. In addition to the IFC, other development finance institutions like FMO and the OPEC Fund came on board as sponsors.\n\nWith the $60.5 million in hand, the SPV, which had hired a consulting architect (HOK), an engineering services firm (Dar-al-handasah), a project manager (Profica), and a lead contractor, went into fifth gear.\n\nA large advance payment was wired straight to Europe for the benefit of Portuguese firm, MSF Engenharia, the lead contractor. MSF Engenharia set up a front office with thin staffing in Ghana, hired another Portuguese firm, Confrasilvas, to handle principal formworks, and commenced work.\n\nMidstream during construction, MSF Engenharia went bankrupt and its various entities in Europe were fully liquidated, leaving its Ghanaian shell effectively orphaned. Since the project had been insured with insurance bonds (local commercial banks wouldn’t touch the risk), Mabani Seven proceeded to the courts to cash out on the insurance bonds to pay its creditors, the DFIs, IFC paramount among them. The lawsuits quickly degenerated into a spaghetti mess, derailing the entire project. The site of The Exchange is now a fenced derelict patch.\n\nThe only reason any of this information is being made available in the public domain is because of court proceedings. No where on the project page on the IFC’s website would the reader find any useful disclosures, even though records in the said court proceedings suggest that as much as $57.5 million of the $60.5 million loan facility was imperiled following MSF Engenharia’s liquidation.\n\nThe entire matter is now shrouded in considerable legal murkiness, with an appeal regarding the continued servicing of the insurance bonds by the local insurers now pending before Ghana’s choked supreme court.\n\nApart from the opacity of these transactions, which effectively nullifies the IFC’s transparency pledge, the extent to which the IFC will often go to protect its commercial interests also regularly presents massive reputational risk, as we have seen in the Bridges Academies case and the Africa’s Talking case. The failure of the IFC to conduct proper due diligence on MSF Engenharia further amplifies these serious reputational concerns. Around the same time that the firm was engaged, it had already been spotlighted for executing just 6% of road projects awarded to it after missing deadlines. Even more pertinently, it had been indebted to the Ghanaian tax authorities for three years.\n\nWhen MSF Engenharia failed, local Ghanaian subcontractors were left holding the can even as the IFC deployed high-powered lawyers to retrieve its own cash. Ghana’s historically undercapitalized insurance industry is now on the line for millions of dollars in liabilities. The five insurance companies directly exposed to the default risk some capital impairment in the event of reinsurance gaps. Indeed, when their bonds were called by the Project Sponsors, and before the courts got involved, the insurers had negotiated to settle in instalments.\n\nWhat we are seeing, therefore, is an effective transfer of liability from a Portuguese corporation to beleaguered Ghanaian entities courtesy of an IFC-funded project. One of the exposed insurance companies, Star Assurance, lists the default claim related to The Exchange, a sum of $5.8 million, as its largest payout in recent times. Local contractors like Man Construction, which was brought in later to ensure that the abandoned structures do not pose a safety threat, also struggled to be paid.\n\nSix years after it was scheduled to open, the site of The Exchange resembles the ruins of a cautionary monument to the perils of commercial real estate.\n\nGhanaian businesses have lost money, the IFC would very likely lose money, and the community is worse off for it.\n\nThe debacle of The Exchange is clear proof that favouring projects that look like they could make lots of money quickly because they cater to the elite is not any less risky than collaborating with others in the ecosystem to make patient investments in critical sectors like agroprocessing and skills-intensive ICT.\n\nThe Exchange’s $435,000-priced 1-bedroom units would definitely have made a few random multimillionaires happy in Accra, but it is doubtful how much joy they would have created in the broader Ghanaian economy even if the project had worked out. What is for sure is that, for now, everyone has ash in their mouths.\n\nLet the People have the Phones!\n\nThe Vice President (Veep) of the Republic of Ghana is also the ruling party’s candidate for the upcoming general elections on 7th December, 2024.\n\nMuch of the campaign season this year has been dominated by the Veep’s talent for the theatrical. His latest offer is to rain smartphones on the poor by introducing a novel credit scoring system.\n\nSince low or no income is often the barrier to owning a nice smartphone, credit is obviously essential. In Ghana, interest rates are scraping at 30% in the premium banks and often exceed 60% in the lower rungs of the financial system. Consumer credit, in particular, is normally out of reach of the common citizen, even if they are willing to pay such high interest rates.\n\nTo the Veep, all these issues are immediately surmountable because he is introducing a “credit scoring system” backed by the omnipotent “Ghana Card“. (The Ghana Card is the country’s digital national identification system, which has been made mandatory for citizens seeking to access various services such as banking and vehicle licensing.) In sum: 1. Credit Scoring will make smartphones affordable. 2. Ghana Card will make Credit Scoring feasible.\n\nNeither proposition is very lucid. Both propositions are driven by something other than a genuine interest in national credit policy improvement, by something more…self-serving. In this short essay, we will tell you why, but you have to read to the end.\n\nGhana’s Credit Scoring Situation\n\nCountries around the world have different approaches to ensuring that credit is priced fairly. How much a person pays for borrowing money or buying something now and paying later – i.e. the interest charged on their loans, hire purchases, and other forms of credit – should be accurately and fairly commensurate with the true risk of their likelihood to default. But this is not always so.\n\nMany people that can and are willing to pay back are often slapped with punitive interest rates (or risk premium) just because the person offering the loan or item being purchased on credit doesn’t know them well, or doesn’t trust them.\n\nCredit information systems have developed over many decades to reduce this information asymmetry and level the playing field. When they work well, most lenders know enough about the borrowing and repaying habits of prospective customers to charge the right interest rate reflective of the true risk premium.\n\nGhana too has been on the road of creating such credit information systems.\n\nWorldwide, such systems usually start with laws and policies to allow the sharing of information about a person’s borrowing habits, their repayment history, and other related factors that can help guide someone intending to provide credit (such as a loan or hire-purchased item) to determine the right level of risk and therefore the right interest rate to charge.\n\nSome jurisdictions then move on to allow for the establishment of so-called “credit reference bureaus” to serve as clearing hubs for this information sharing.\n\nWhen such hubs emerge, it becomes easier for models, formulas, algorithms, and processes used to make the information held on an individual more comparable with what is known about other individuals. Doing so greatly simplifies the process of charging the right interest rate. You can group borrowers with similar background information into categories and apply simple and complex analysis to those categories collectively.\n\nOne approach to such stratification is the generation of standardised credit scores for each borrower group. A person falling within a certain credit score band is then similar to all others in that band and is expected to behave in roughly similar ways when you lend them money or sell an item to them on credit.\n\nGhana’s Experience\n\nGhana passed the Credit Reporting Act in 2007 (Act 726) and issued additional regulations in 2020 (LI 2394). The initial stage of ensuring that the laws and policies align with credit scoring therefore started nearly two decades ago. In previous essays (here, and here), I have catalogued this evolution extensively so I will not bore the reader by being repetitive.\n\nThe second phase of establishing credit bureaus actually began before the law was ready. The first Credit Bureau, XDS Data, was incorporated in 2003 and became operational in 2004. Since then, others such as Hudson and Dun & Bradstreet have also incorporated and commenced operations (even though Hudson’s license was revoked in 2022). Hudson found it difficult to generate enough revenue to operate.\n\nThe Bank of Ghana regularly reports about the state of credit referencing in Ghana. The reader can find one such recent report here. In this report, the reader will see that in 2022 nearly 10 million credit checks were performed in Ghana using the existing system.\n\nFor the lenders that subscribe to the services of Ghana’s credit bureaus, they had an 85% chance of getting the necessary credit intel on prospective borrowers when they run a search.\n\nNearly 15.2 million individual Ghanaians were captured in the system, as well as more than 520,000 businesses.\n\nSo, what exactly is the Veep promising to introduce?\n\nHere is where it gets interesting. In previous debates about this subject, the argument has turned on whether credit scores are indeed all that different from credit reports.\n\nThe supporters of the Veep claim that the absence of credit scores, a single number that summarises a borrower’s credit report (“credit report” being all the valid, relevant, information held on an individual by a credit bureau), is what is making it hard for citizens to buy phones on credit in Ghana. The introduction of their new credit scoring system will thus address this through the magical intervention of the Ghana Card.\n\nLet’s probe this.\n\nHow Credit Scoring Works\n\nIn the United States, credit scoring was invented by two mathematicians, Earl Isaac and Bill Fair, who set up a company called Fair Isaac (now known as FICO) in 1956 with an investment of $400. The FICO model is today the most widely used method in the United States for synthesizing and distilling credit reports into credit scores. In 2006, in order to challenge the near-monopoly of FICO (a situation that, by the way, has triggered more than 10 antitrust investigations), three of the four credit bureaus in the US came together to create a competing model called VantageScore.\n\nThe FICO model has evolved (it is now in its 10th iteration). The 8th version is the most widely used across the United States, and perhaps the world, and can be summed up along the lines below.\n\nIn short, FICO has a complex mathematical formula/algorithm embedded in a software suite, that allows information held by credit bureaus on an individual or business to be condensed into a single number by applying different weights to different data points. That software is what generates the score and all one needs is to license it and feed it with data of the requisite scope and quality.\n\nCredit Scoring in Ghana\n\nLet’s reapply this experience to Ghana. Ghana has a law that requires lenders to report information on everyone. If you are a Ghanaian who has ever borrowed money from a licensed lender, it is about 85% likely that such information is held on you. There are two existing credit bureaus – XDS Data and Duns & Bradstreet (D&B). D&B is a big multinational and XDS is a regional multinational with roots in South Africa and operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe logic being forced on all of us is that somehow D&B and XDS cannot source software to reduce their reports to a credit score even though they have done so in other markets such as Nigeria and South Africa. How does this make sense?\n\nIn the heat of the last controversy, XDS issued a statement. They claimed that there are data quality issues that have stopped them from generating scores in Ghana. They also mentioned that they have hopes of the Ghana Card helping them clean up some of the data issues.\n\nThe statement was curious because it contradicted information on the website of the company, which suggested that the company was already offering credit scores in Ghana, at least to some customers, notwithstanding these data issues. Clearly, XDS capitulated under political duress. An unfortunate development since by their statement they gave ammo to political spinmeisters. Worse, they enabled conduct likely to be detrimental to their own industry, as I explain later on.\n\nNevertheless, and more importantly, the XDS statement confirmed beyond doubt that Ghana Card data is already being reported to the credit bureaus. Whatever Ghana Card can do, it should already be doing in the existing system.\n\nSo, the question is: if Ghana has credit bureaus collecting information on millions of Ghanaians already, and these bureaus have been using the Ghana Card already, then why is there a need for the Vice President to set up a new credit scoring system backed by the same Ghana Card?\n\nCredit Scoring formats can vary in place and time\n\nIt is important to clarify for the record that a credit information system can work even without credit bureaus and credit scoring, per se. This is the case in France and Japan, where the banks and retailers have followed a different pathway in assessing credit risk.\n\nAnyone who believes that, without a North American style credit-scoring system, making phones available on credit would be impossible is thus patently wrong. Despite not following the North American route, Japan has joined the consumer credit boom sweeping Asia. Credit card networks and financial intel organisations have proved capable of filling any vacuum that may exist.\n\nIn the case of France, policy is actually antagonistic to North American style credit reporting due to privacy concerns. Remember that in countries like the US, Ghana, Mexico, Canada, and the UK, there are a bunch of faceless organisations called credit bureaus that get informed by your bank every time you take out a loan or miss a payment. The pesky French would have none of that. They prefer risk management to be siloed at the bank level and pooled within the Central Bank itself. As with many things, there are many ways to kill a cat, and the wise learn from different experiences.\n\nThe real challenge in Ghana\n\nBut back to the main question. Why hasn’t Ghana’s existing credit information system allowed people to buy phones on credit and pay “1 cedi, 2 cedi” every month? Or cars as earlier promised by the Veep, for that matter?\n\nIf you look at the data carefully, the answer is pretty simple. Retailers, the kinds of entities that would normally sell cars and phones on credit in partnership with telcos and the like, are not using the existing credit information system much. Of the 10 million checks conducted in 2022, less than 8000 were by retailers.\n\nApart from poor awareness, there are other constraints. The credit bureaus, for instance, complain about lax enforcement of the reporting obligation leading to noncompliance on the parts of companies like ECG and Ghana Water, which holds interesting data on consumers. Whilst these companies are meant to share data on their customers with all the licensed credit bureaus, they often don’t.\n\nWithout thorough and consistent data, it becomes a challenge to build credit scoring models because, as you might remember, these models aim to predict whether a category of persons will repay their debt or not. To do so requires enough information about each individual in the pool and enough information across enough individuals within a certain clustering pool. A major statistical burden.\n\nIt would seem that too many individuals in the current credit data pools in Ghana don’t have enough data across the important dimensions for an ethical credit bureau to attempt to use software from FICO or someone else to generate a predictive credit score. There is a fear of spurious correlations leading to credit scores that are not sufficiently predictive.\n\nGhana doesn’t face such challenges alone\n\nFirst, it bears mention that there are countries with even more advanced credit information systems where similar challenges have prevented the most efficient use of credit scoring even when all the preconditions and capabilities exist for credit scores to be generated.\n\nFor example, in Indonesia, credit bureau coverage is still in the low 20% range. In China 70% of the population have no credit score. In Thailand, existing credit bureaus are accused of facilitating “blacklists” rather than leveling the playing ground. In Malaysia, courts are sparring with credit bureaus about their power to even create credit scores after inaccuracies in credit reports led to lawsuits.\n\nIn simple terms, the credit scoring hurdle is not one that any politician can scale by waving a magic wand. The idea that a simple national ID will brush away complex statistical, sociological, financial, and operational challenges is completely preposterous. More so when the countries that have embraced the credit score system most enthusiastically – the US, Canada and the UK – don’t even have mandatory national ID systems like the Ghana Card.\n\nSo, then, what REALLY is driving the Veep\n\nMany Ghanaians have taken the Veep’s promises as standard “campaign platform talk”. Some have tried to dismiss it as gimmickry, whilst his supporters lament the lack of vision of his opponents. Sadly, the entire debate is misplaced.\n\nIn recent times, I have resorted to the term, “state enchantment“, to describe situations where politicians invest massive energy in Public Relations (PR) to spin a narrative of “national glory, success or advancement” as justifying particular projects when in fact the projects are being pursued purely to advance the commercial interests of their friends. That is exactly what is happening in this “buy smartphones for credit” initiative.\n\nThe whole effort to “create a credit scoring system” backed by the Ghana Card when one already exists in Ghana and utilises Ghana Card data is driven by a desire to see a mushroom credit bureau succeed. Why? Because it is owned by close associates.\n\nThis mushroom entity, called MyCredit Score Limited, was set up in February 2023, twenty years after the first bureau in Ghana, XDS, and just after the Vice President started his campaign to make it possible for people to buy cars on credit using the Ghana Card.\n\nMyCredit Score has seven Directors including Ernest Apenteng of Hubtel, Francis Blay of Omni Strategies/Akofis Group, and Aisha Yuuni of Datrix Tech. All these individuals have tight business associations with other initiatives involving Ghana’s Veep, such as the Tap n Go transport digitalisation project, Ghana.gov, and the ECG electricity retailing system and mobile app. In fact, in a bout of coordinated PR, ECG announced right after the Veep’s campaign speech that it has launched its pay on credit scheme.\n\nFrancis Blay is the ultimate beneficial owner of MyCredit Score even though he controls 50% of the shares. The others holding the remaining shares, presumably on his behalf, are the CEO and Sales Director of Hubtel.\n\nThere is something curious about how Francis Blay, a one-time Maryland US resident, does business. Ownership of his other companies is often vested in relatively junior employees such as Joshua Maxwellson, Emmanuel Opei-Kumi, and Eric Takyi. Their roles in Blay’s organisations are often described by titles such as “procurement executive” and “monitoring officer”.\n\nThat Francis Blay is a close associate of Ghana’s Veep is beyond doubt given the extent to which the Veep has gone to impose his mushroom entity on the credit scoring landscape.\n\nBlay’s relatives include politicians in the ruling party, NPP, and senior officials at the Vice Presidency of Ghana.\n\nThe passion of the Vice President for extending credit to the poor so that they too may taste the goodness of smartphones (after first arming them with Ghana Cards, of course) cannot be fully explained until these pieces are put together.\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\nThe Attorney General of Ghana is trying desperately to spin serious embarrassment to the Republic of Ghana in an international tribunal using all the tools in his propaganda toolkit.\n\nOn 16th August 2021, two investors in Ghana’s petroleum sector, Eni (an Italian multinational) and Vitol (a Swiss multinational) filed notice under the UNCITRAL rules of their intention to jointly pursue international arbitration in response to directives issued to them by the government of Ghana that they felt breached their petroleum agreements with the country. Eni-Vitol had come to the conclusion that the political context in which these directives were issued made it impossible for them to obtain fair hearing and justice in the domestic jurisdiction.\n\nThe origin of the controversy\n\nThe government of Ghana had ordered them to merge their oil field, which had been successfully producing oil for a number of years, after investments exceeding $6 billion, with an oil block next door that has never produced oil and seen in total roughly $100 million of investments.\n\nFurthermore, the government wanted Eni-Vitol to also hand over roughly 55% of the combined entity to the owner of the said oil block next door. Ghana’s domestic laws allow the government to do this. However, petroleum exploration and production constitute an international domain in which certain global business and technical logics operate and have operated for many decades.\n\nWhilst the Ghanaian courts have been focused purely on what the law allowed the government to do, and were inclined to rely on the curious technical testimony of the country’s national oil company (GNPC), the truth of the matter is that there are international standards in these matters and any investor coming into any country to invest billions of dollars will ensure that they also have the protection of international law and technical regimes. Given the sheer amount of money they stood to lose (reckoned in billions of dollars), it came as no surprise when Eni-Vitol decided to take their case internationally.\n\nWe have discussed the issues at length elsewhere\n\nIn a previous essay on this site, I have chronicled carefully the history of the controversy in significant detail. In another essay I laid out the basis of my argument that GNPC’s technical testimony in this instance was procured by political pressure as it simply didn’t hold water.\n\nAs the reader would no doubt notice from these essays, civil society organisations (CSOs) in Ghana engaged in the petroleum sector, especially IMANI and ACEP, have exhaustively examined the matters in the controversy and, with deep patriotic concern, warned the government that its actions in the attempted forced “unitisation” of the two offshore petroleum sites are completely against the national interest. In this short essay, we shall show why the tribunal’s final decision given this week, and the consequences of the unjustified “forced unitisation” directives, are all highly embarrassing for Ghana and completely detrimental to the country’s reputation and economic position.\n\nThe case against the government of Ghana\n\nWhen Eni-Vitol filed its arbitration notice, the government of Ghana initially didn’t even bother to submit a detailed response.\n\nEni-Vitol nonetheless proceeded to present their joint statement of claim. At the heart of their case is the simple fact that Ghana is trying to force them to merge a highly valuable, and proven, oil field with another one that has not yet been properly assessed, to international standards, in order to determine if there is even any oil in place.\n\nIn the circumstances, such an attempt amounts to a pure ruse to seize a large part of a highly lucrative asset and hand it over to another business without any sensible foundation. International law frowns on unjust expropriation of foreign-owned assets under different guises.\n\nIf the government was genuinely interested in merging the fields purely because it wishes to improve efficiency, it would first focus on ensuring that the other business owning the “greenfield” block undertakes the proper technical investigations to confirm if indeed there is oil on that block, and what quantity exactly. This is at the heart of the whole matter.\n\nIn fact, carefully analysed from that perspective, Ghana itself STOOD TO LOSE if a merger was forced between a lucrative and fertile oil block and a potentially infertile and valueless one since the merger will affect Ghana’s own holdings in both blocks, which were not uniform at the time of the proposed merger.\n\nIn my earlier essay, referenced above, I lay out the various scenarios in which both Eni-Vitol and Ghana would lose massive amounts of money if the unitisation proceeded. The only beneficiary would have been the owner of the block next door, the optimistically named “Afina field”. The question that has never been properly addressed is why the government of Ghana was willing to go to such lengths to benefit the Afina owners, even to the detriment of its own economic position and international reputation.\n\nIn light of its position on the matter, what specifically did Eni-Vitol want the international tribunal to do for them? Below are the reliefs they were seeking, produced in full.\n\nA careful reading of the reliefs should show that the bulk of Eni-Vitol’s expectations are in the nature of a declaration that the government’s directives for forced unitisation are unlawful and unjustifiable and should not proceed in the manner the government had sought to bring them about. That really is it.\n\nThe tribunal, even per the Attorney General’s own atrociously uncandid summary, has declared the government of Ghana’s attempt and approach at forced unitisation to be in breach of its petroleum agreement with Eni-Vitol and therefore unlawful and unjustified. Simple!\n\nThe government’s attempt at defending its actions\n\nWhat was the government’s principal defense at the tribunal and how does it square with how the Attorney General is attempting to spin the outcomes of the proceedings?\n\nThe government’s super-expensive international lawyers summed up its case in the paragraph below found in the opening of its statement of defense. (“Claimants” in the text extract refers to Eni-Vitol.)\n\nGovernment of Ghana’s primary aim in paying for these expensive lawyers to fight its baseless cause at arbitration was to get the tribunal to agree with its approach to the forced unitisation.\n\nThe government knew that its case was not in the national interest\n\nThe Ghanaian government did not only want the tribunal to agree with its inherently disordered and self-detrimental approach to the merger, which would have damaged the interests of its own citizens, they also wanted the tribunal to find the investors guilty of breaching their agreement with Ghana by not lying down and rolling over immediately they were asked to hand over a juicy chunk of their asset to another business.\n\nThe true mindset of the government’s agents in this matter, especially the Attorney General who instructed these lawyers, is exposed by paragraph 49 of the government’s statement of defense.\n\nWhat that paragraph simply says is that in the end even if the merger leads to losses, Ghana is the ultimate bearer of those losses and so why is Eni-Vitol sweating? Such a deeply unpatriotic and reckless argument to make!\n\nThe government, egged on by the Attorney General, believes that it can proceed with technically reckless actions in Ghana’s petroleum sector, actions that will impose losses on the citizens of the country, with no consequence at all. What it is essentially saying here to investors is that, “why are you crying more than the bereaved? We are willing to bear the losses.”\n\nIn fact, the government spends the overwhelming proportion of its defense arguing against “commerciality” as an important logic in any regulatory directive that affects the economic structure of a petroleum transaction in which Ghana is involved. It attempts, in breathtaking elaborateness, to make the case that even if the Afina block does not have any oil, it is fine to merge it with the oil producing Sankofa – Gye Nyame field (the one in which Eni-Vitol have majority interest) even though the inevitable result will be the dilution of economic returns for both Ghana and Eni-Vitol, and even if the only one who stands to benefit is the third-party private business next door.\n\nThe disorganised logic of the government’s case\n\nPerhaps, in a belated recognition that their longwinded arguments making the case that commercial logic is irrelevant and all that matters is the discretion of government ministers, the government’s expensive lawyers began to moderate their tone somewhat when it came to defending the decision of the government to award 54.5% of the merged field to the private owner of the next-door Afina block.\n\nWhat they are saying here, in essence, is that the precise allocation of acreage in the combined block is still in the works. The illogicality of that argument is inherent in fact that any such decision has to be based on knowledge of how much oil is in the separate blocks. Without knowing how much oil each party is in essence “bringing to the combined table”, there is no technically sound way to divvy up the combined block. Since determining “commerciality” is how you confirm that the owner of the non-producing oil block is bringing anything to the table at all, the hollowness of this belated concession about the exact split of the combined field becomes crystal clear, laid side by side with the claim that commerciality is an irrelevant factor.\n\nAfter all this turning and twisting, how did the government want the tribunal to rule? Ghana’s counter-claims offer a good view.\n\nGhana wanted the tribunal to punish Eni-Vitol\n\nThe government also wanted damages. Yes, it wanted to be paid by the investors for the pleasure of being robbed of their petroleum assets.\n\nAfter these brazen demands, the government proceeded to list its requested reliefs.\n\nThe government failed to secure any of its principal reliefs\n\nThe judges at the tribunal must have had a good laugh. But deep down they were not amused. The government’s punitive claims against Eni-Vitol were totally dismissed. By even the twisted accounts of the Attorney General, it is clear that the tribunal did not so much look at them twice.\n\nWhilst the Attorney General is celebrating the decision of the tribunal not to award large damages against Ghana, and its instructions for Ghana to only pay half of the arbitration costs, the truth is that the government’s attempt to get the tribunal to sympathise with its positions was wholly unsuccessful. Eni-Vitol on the other hand got what they mostly set out to achieve: a ruling by an international tribunal that the government’s conduct is unlawful, on the basis of international standards and a more expansive reading of the country’s own laws.\n\nThe tribunal ruled in Ghana’s interest\n\nIn the end, though, especially for us in civil society, what matters is that the citizens understand clearly that the international tribunal was on their side and their government was acting in ways that would have considerably damaged their interests.\n\nGhana had to issue sovereign guarantees and tap the World Bank’s guarantee facility in order to get the Eni-Vitol field operational.\n\nThe Eni-Vitol field is now the major supplier of gas for the country’s power plants. Ghana obtains significant revenues from its equity stake in the field. Forcing this lucrative project into a poorly thought through merger with an unproven, greenfield, block would have caused massive disruption, undermined the commercial viability of the whole enterprise, and therefore ultimately eroded the benefits of the producing and proven asset to the people of Ghana. It is very likely that the Eni-Vitol would have stopped gas production and plunged Ghana into dumsor should the situation had persisted down the path it was on."
