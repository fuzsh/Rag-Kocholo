        "text": "The Three Lions boss has opted to step aside and a new manager is now set to take over ahead of the 2026 World Cup, with Eddie Howe the early favourite to succeed him\n\nArticle bookmarked\n\nFind your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile\n\nDon't show me this message again\n\n✕\n\nGareth Southgate has decided to step down as England manager following defeat to Spain in a tightly contested Euro 2024 final in Berlin.\n\nHe announced his decision to quit in a statement issued by the Football Association on Tuesday morning. “As a proud Englishman, it has been the honour of my life to play for England and to manage England. It has meant everything to me, and I have given it my all,” he said. “But it’s time for change, and for a new chapter. Sunday’s final in Berlin against Spain was my final game as England manager.”\n\nSpeculation has begun as to who will succeed Southgate, with Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola seen as the outstanding candidate. Guardiola is still contracted to the Premier League club but there is a feeling that he could become available next summer with the FA prepared to wait and see if he would be open to the role.\n\nThe likes of Englishmen Graham Potter and Eddie Howe have also been linked with the role, while Mauricio Pochettino is also considered to understand the culture around the national team by the FA, which is a trait they will target when appointing a replacement.\n\nFollow all the latest reaction after Southgate’s decision and the FA’s pursuit of a new manager below:\n\n1721212225\n\nJude Bellingham hails ‘unbelievable human’ Gareth Southgate\n\nJude Bellingham has described departing England boss Gareth Southgate as “easily one of the best coaches in the history of the national team” after he stepped down from the role.\n\nBellingham said: “I’d like to thank Gareth and his staff for the great memories during his tenure. From the point of view of a fan who has become a member of the squad, it’s been a roller coaster of amazing emotions that has instilled hope and joy back into our country.\n\n“It was a privilege to be led by someone who is so dedicated and passionate, not only is Gareth easily one of the best coaches in the history of the national team but also an unbelievable human being. Thank you for everything and all the best in the next chapter, gaffer.”\n\nMike Jones17 July 2024 11:30\n\n1721211325\n\n‘We can’t lose the culture’\n\nDuring the Lionesses Euro 2025 qualifier against Sweden on Tuesday evening, Karen Carney revealed that she sad to see Gareth Southgate leave his position as England manager but stressed the need to keep the culture he created around the national team.\n\n“My reaction was that I was sad, really sad,” said Carney. “We all wanted England to win on Sunday but we also wanted him [Southgate] to end on a win now that we know it was his final game.\n\n“I think it was probably the right time for him and for England as well. He received a lot of abuse which was unnecessary for what he’s done but maybe England need a refresh to go again.\n\n“We’ve got to be careful what we wish for. Everyone wants more and more but look at his record. The FA have got to be careful about their next decision and I would urge them to take their time.\n\n“They took their time to find Sarina [Wiegman] the right person and I think they need to find the right person [to replace] Gareth. We can’t lose that culture; we have to keep that.”\n\nMike Jones17 July 2024 11:15\n\n1721210605\n\nSarina Wiegman sad to see Southgate depart England role\n\nEngland women’s boss Sarina Wiegman admitted that she will be sad when Gareth Southgate departs his role as manager of the men’s team and claimed that the 53-year-old’s time with the national team was ’incredible’.\n\nShe said: “To be honest yes [I’m sad]. Because he’s such a nice person and a great coach. We wouldn’t see each other all the time but when we did it was realy nice.”\n\nWiegman added that she was proud of what Southgate achieved in the role saying: “What he has done for England football is just really incredible. They made the final [of Euro 2024] and of course the made the last final of the last one [Euro 2020] too. I think he can be very proud of himself and I think England is very proud of him, and me as Dutch, I am very proud of him too.”\n\nMike Jones17 July 2024 11:03\n\n1721209945\n\nFrance files legal complaint over ‘racist’ song from Argentina players\n\nThe French football federation (FFF) has vowed to file a complaint with Fifa amid a row over “racist and discriminatory remarks” by Argentina players against the French team after the Copa America final.\n\nArgentina midfielder Enzo Fernandez, who plays for Chelsea, posted a video of Argentina players appearing to sing about French players with African heritage. Argentina beat Colombia 1-0 on Sunday at Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\nFrance defender Wesley Fofana, who is also Fernandez’s teammate at Chelsea, shared the video on social media on Tuesday calling it an act of “uninhibited racism“.\n\nFrance files legal complaint over ‘racist’ song from Argentina players\n\nEnzo Fernandez issues apology for ‘highly offensive language’\n\nMike Jones17 July 2024 10:52\n\n1721209225\n\nA final word from Gareth Southgate’s departing statement:\n\n“My special thanks go to the backroom staff who have provided the players and me with unstinting support over the last eight years.\n\n“Their hard work and commitment inspired me every day, and I am so grateful to them – the brilliant ‘team behind the team’.\n\n“We have the best fans in the world, and their support has meant the world to me. I’m an England fan and I always will be. I look forward to watching and celebrating as the players go on to create more special memories and to connect and inspire the nation as we know they can.\n\n“Thank you, England – for everything.”\n\nMike Jones17 July 2024 10:40\n\n1721208445\n\nFan who got tattoo of England’s Euro 2024 ‘win’ days before final speaks out\n\nAn fan who prematurely had “England Euro 2024 Winners” tattooed on his leg to celebrate the Three Lions’ “victory” has spoken out after the side were beaten by Spain in Sunday’s (14 July) final.\n\nDan Thomas was inked with an image of the Henri Delaunay Cup and the text - but says he has no regrets about the decision and intends to keep it just in case the side are victorious in 2028.\n\nEngland’s bid for a first major men’s trophy since 1966 was scuppered after substitute Mikel Oyarzabal’s late winner secured a second successive European Championship final defeat for Gareth Southgate’s side.\n\nMike Jones17 July 2024 10:27\n\n1721207725\n\nGareth Southgate resigns as England manager\n\nSouthgate, who had previously worked with England’s under-21s, was appointed in November 2016 having been initially placed in temporary charge after Sam Allardyce’s resignation.\n\nHe guided England to the semi-finals at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, losing to Croatia in extra time, before steering the side to a first European Championship final on home soil three years later.\n\nA contract extension was signed ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, where England were knocked out in the last eight by France, and a fourth major tournament disappointment in Germany has brought the curtain down on his tenure.\n\nMike Jones17 July 2024 10:15\n\n1721207005\n\nWhat next for England? Inside the FA’s process to replace Gareth Southgate\n\nThe Football Association had a plan in place for Gareth Southgate’s departure months before Euro 2024, since it was widely expected, and there is a view in football that managers like Graham Potter have turned down other jobs in anticipation. But the reality of making decisions can be very different from the build-up.\n\nThe FA are now in that classic bind that comes with these situations where you’re replacing a figure so associated with a high-profile job. There’s what they can do, what they want to do and what they should do. Those aren’t necessarily all the same thing.\n\nThere is one priority that feels progressive but may prompt greater debate. The FA want a manager that has an appreciation for the culture of the English national team rather than just being English. Understanding the role is more important than nationality or even CV.\n\nWhat next for England? Inside the FA’s process to replace Gareth Southgate\n\nGareth Southgate’s departure has left the Football Association with a huge decision – with the likes of Eddie Howe, Graham Potter and Pep Guardiola all linked to the job\n\nMike Jones17 July 2024 10:03\n\n1721206225\n\nFA to appoint Gareth Southgate’s successor ‘as soon as possible’\n\nMark Bullingham, chief executive of the FA, has confirmed that work to appoint a successor to Gareth Southgate is already underway, with an “interim solution” also a possibility.\n\n“On behalf of English football, I would like to pay tribute to Gareth Southgate and to Steve Holland for everything they have achieved,” Bullingham said. “Over the last eight years they have transformed the England men’s team, delivering unforgettable memories for everyone who loves the Three Lions.\n\n“We look back at Gareth’s tenure with huge pride – his contribution to the English game, including a significant role in player development, and in culturetransformation has been unique.\n\n“The process for appointing Gareth’s successor is now under way and we aim to have our new manager confirmed as soon as possible. Our UEFA Nations League campaign starts in September, and we have an interim solution in place if it is needed.”\n\nMike Jones17 July 2024 09:50\n\n1721205325\n\nFull statement as Southgate resigns:\n\n“As a proud Englishman, it has been the honour of my life to play for England and to manage England,” Southgate said in a statement. “It has meant everything to me, and I have given it my all.\n\n“But it’s time for change, and for a new chapter. Sunday’s final in Berlin against Spain was my final game as England manager.\n\n“I joined the FA in 2011, determined to improve English football. In that time, including eight years as England men’s manager, I have been supported by some brilliant people who have my heartfelt thanks.\n\n“I could not have had anyone better alongside me than Steve Holland. He is one of the most talented coaches of his generation, and has been immense.\n\n“I have had the privilege of leading a large group of players in 102 games. Every one of them has been proud to wear the three lions on their shirts, and they have been a credit to their country in so many ways.\n\n“The squad we took to Germany is full of exciting young talent and they can win the trophy we all dream of. I am so proud of them, and I hope we get behind the players and the team at St George’s Park and the FA who strive every day to improve English football, and understand the power football has to drive positive change.”\n\nMike Jones17 July 2024 09:35\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
