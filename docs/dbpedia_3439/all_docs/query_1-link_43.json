        "text": "It seems that comic book fans can never get enough Batman content, so it's just as well that Prime Video are giving us a brand new animated series to bridge the gap until the character's return to the big screen.\n\nBatman: Caped Crusader boasts Matt Reeves as an executive producer, but interprets Gotham City in a rather different way to the filmmaker's moody 2022 blockbuster The Batman.\n\nHere, we see a noir aesthetic evoking detective stories of the 1950s and '60s, with alternate versions of well-loved characters like Catwoman, Penguin and Harley Quinn cropping up throughout.\n\nThe new show comes hot on the heels of an explosive The Boys season 4 finale, making Prime Video a competitive streamer for fans of superhero (or supervillain) content.\n\nIf you're looking for something completely different, My Lady Jane puts a fresh spin on period romance, while Outer Range mashes up the Western and sci-fi genres; two titles showing the wide variety of innovative storytelling on the platform.\n\nThe streamer also has a range of other originals available, including Clarkson's Farm, Invincible, Reacher and Mr & Mrs Smith, while some fan-favourite acquired titles available on the platform include the US version of The Office and Bad Education.\n\nIf you need more inspiration for navigating Prime Video's vast library, we're here to help, picking the best titles you can find on the streamer and updating this list with new entries every week.\n\nSo, without further ado, here are the top titles on Amazon Prime Video for UK viewers.\n\nSign up for a 30-day free trial of Prime Video and pay Â£8.99 a month after that."
