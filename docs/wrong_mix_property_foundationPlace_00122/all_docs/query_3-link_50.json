This remarkable achievement was made possible in just under 90 days, due to the excellence of ITSS’ highly trained team of experts.\n\nThe project involved multi-entity implementation of Infinity version R-2023.01 in 5 subsidiaries of Vista Bank Group located in Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, Gambia, and Guinea. Along with the implementation, compatibility with the pre-existing Transact Release R19 was also ensured. Post-implementation, testing support (SIT & UAT), performance tuning, and client training were provided by the ITSS team.\n\nThe project was completed as a hybrid of onshore, offshore, and near-shore using Waterfall methodology and deployed on Cloud platform. Post Go-Live, the bank was able to provide faster, simpler, and easier banking services and products to its customers. Smooth project execution by the ITSS team ensured cost savings in terms of infrastructure, product licensing, and faster go-to-market.\n\nDespite linguistic, geographical, and cultural challenges, the ITSS team emerged victorious in this implementation project, living up to our mission of transforming global and local banking landscapes.\n\nHere’s a statement from Cyril O. Ijoma, the Head of the E-Banking Services Unit, at Vista Bank Group:\n\n“We particularly appreciate the maintenance and stability of the resources allocated to the project.
