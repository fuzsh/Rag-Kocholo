        "text": "I am so excited to announce that Temenos has achieved the prestigious 'Great Place to Work' certification in 3 locations in EUROPE: France, the Netherlands and Denmark. In addition we also got the certification in India and the UAE! Our distinct Temenosity culture is a defining factor that distinguishes us as a brand, making us all immensely proud. #temenos #culture #GPTW Thanks to Rie Henriksen Coralie Nicodème Agnieszka Zboińska for the excellent work on the ground to achieve this in a record time! Thanks to all our employees that participated and confirmed that we are a Great Place to Work. Thanks to Simona (Sacalianu) Noury, for launching the idea and following up on this great project! Special kudos for your sponsorhip and believing in it : Jayde Tipper, FCIPD And Mark Yamin-Ali\n\nWhat a great moment shared with all the employees from our Amsterdam operations. We have opened a new state of the art office which seen tremendous growth. The office is in the vibrant heart of Amsterdam and given the smiles I could saw ; I think we did a good job! Thanks to the core team! @zoubida beranger Rie Henriksen Bruno Macedo Agnieszka Zboińska Eric Steketee And thank you also Jayde Tipper, FCIPD, Kalliopi Chioti and our new CEO Jean-Pierre Brulard to have taken the time to be with us!\n\nForget mimosas and meditation, the Luxembourg team is getting ready for the Temenos Global Wellbeing Week with a knockout punch! We took a break from the spreadsheets and headed to a sandbag boxing class...and we are FEELING it - everyone left nice and toasty (see picture for evidence!). But seriously, this was a great way to de-stress and get those endorphins pumping. What are your favorite ways to boost your wellbeing at work? #WellbeingWeek #SandbagSelfie #ExhaustedButHappy P.S. Don't worry, nobody actually got hurt (except maybe our egos ). Fatima Addad Solange FONSECA Julie Martins Aicha Tazi Yvonne Urzi Alain Beck Youness FTICHI Thomas Payeur Alvaro HENRY MANTILLA\n\nIt was my pleasure to celebrate Temenos' 30th anniversary. Thirty years is a significant milestone in any company's history, and it is a testament of #temenos success and innovation. It is also the direct result of our #hardwork , #dedication and #passion . Also #TemenosLuxembourg has a unique history, it is the sum of different companies, different individuals. There was Odyssey, then Multifonds….we have all our specificities, but at the end, we are One Company. That is why we celebrated Temenos as one ; all together. When I look at the people, I can only be confident that #temenos will continue to thrive and be this indisputable leader in the banking software and leading the flag of innovation. Cheers to our #success Thank you also Steen Jensen to have joined us for this celebration. #teamlux #temenosturns30"
