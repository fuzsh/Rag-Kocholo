Learn how this integration will incorporate Visa Direct’s payment capabilities and consolidate them with other payment services on the single Temenos platform here: https://lnkd.in/giRDJ2iB\n\nDiscover how HAMILTON RESERVE BANK, the largest global bank in the Caribbean, addresses traditional #banking challenges and meets #customerexpectations for personalized, sustainable solutions. Hear from Maurya Murphy, Senior Product Director at Temenos, and Benjamin Wey, Senior Advisor at Hamilton Reserve Bank, on leveraging technology to streamline operations and drive business growth. Watch the video here: https://lnkd.in/e8jtPYvp #TCF2024\n\nWe're proud that Temenos has been certified as a Great Place To Work in Denmark, France, India, the UAE and the Netherlands! We got this certification based on the strong feedback from surveys done across these locations, looking at our culture and wellbeing. Over 80% agreed Temenos is indeed 'a Great Place to Work'!\n\nAs more and more customers expect digital access to financial services, scalable solutions are imperative for #finserv players in APAC. While the likes of Alipay and WeChat attempt to bridge the gap between the banked and #unbanked, #innovation must ensure it is fit for purpose for all. Hear more from PVcomBank CTO & CDO Trinh Vinh Hien and Temenos Managing Director - APAC Ramki Ramakrishnan here: Fintech in Asia: https://lnkd.in/e3JUF3Fm #TCF2024\n\n“Traditional banking relationships are mostly transactional – banks prioritize interest rates and revenue. Fintechs tend to be more focused on building products from the ground up to meet exact customer needs,” according to Mihails Kuznecovs, CEO of FINCI. FINCI is a fintech startup from Lithuania that now serves customers in over 30 countries including SMEs, commercial organizations, and large corporates that have long been underserved by traditional banks. FINCI went live with Temenos in just 4 months and has grown quickly ever since. The volume of #payments processed by FINCI has increased 100% year-on-year, while card transactions have increased by 50%. Learn more about how FINCI is innovating in #SMEbanking with Temenos here: https://lnkd.in/gece83ku #VoiceOfCustomer\n\nHow does integrating #IBOR and #ABOR on a single entity streamline and speed up the #FundAccounting process? Hear from Léa Aouston, Principal Consultant of Temenos Multifonds, explaining 3 essential features in the system to achieve maximum efficiency. #1. Data that is ‘time aware’ #2. Access Data mart for infinite flexibility #3. Automated Exception-driven workflow Download the report here: https://lnkd.in/g37vrWT9\n\nThe future of banking has no borders or boundaries. The #BanksOfTomorrow will be open, flexible, and collaborative. We had an amazing time in Taipei exploring emerging technologies like #GenAI, and discussing how APAC banks can leverage our open, #cloud-native platform to achieve faster time-to-value, increase efficiency, and deliver a faster, more personalized journey.\n\nEarlier this year, we introduced the first #GenAI solution tailored for banks! This groundbreaking technology is pre-built, pre-configured, and deployment agnostic, ready to integrate seamlessly with your existing systems to deliver personalized, customer-centric experiences. Why is this revolutionary? Temenos can enable data-driven decision-making with natural language queries, while guaranteeing safety, security, and privacy with proven security frameworks. Our extensive R&D in data analytics and #AI has culminated in this unique tool, poised to transform #banking software. Watch the video to learn more: https://lnkd.in/eZEXvR8f #SucceedwithTemenos"
