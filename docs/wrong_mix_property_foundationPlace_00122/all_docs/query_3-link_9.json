So it's good to do window shopping at this stage and discover more. We recently wrote an article on selecting a payment hub that could be useful in the process of finding the right solution.\n\nSetting up a payment factory? Include the IT department from the start\n\nBefore you engage in a conversation with the different vendors, you should involve all the key stakeholders from your company – including IT and possibly also procurement – and understand the functionalities you will need. Then, make sure you list everything by aligning it with your roadmap. For example, the payment hub you select should be a future-proof solution, meaning that you can add more functionalities later, such as reconciliation, or even work with the same vendor to improve liquidity management and cash flow forecasting.\n\nUnderstand the payment hub market"
