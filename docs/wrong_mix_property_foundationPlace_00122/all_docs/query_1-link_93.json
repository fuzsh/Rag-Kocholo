        "text": "Temenos, a provider of banking software, has teamed up with crypto-technology firm Taurus to give clients access to digital assets.\n\nThe two Switzerland-based firms will aim to “bridge the gap between traditional investments and digital assets,” Temenos product director Alexandre Duret said in a press release Monday.\n\nTaurus recently received a securities license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) to operate an independent regulated digital assets marketplace.\n\nTaurus offers tokenization, staking, decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital currencies on its platform, and now Temenos’ institutional clients will have access to that platform.\n\nThe integration is aimed toward making it easier for banks to offer trading of digital assets to their clients through Taurus’ products by enabling custody of digital assets and offering connectivity to more than 10 blockchain protocols.\n\nChanges to Swiss regulations in February now give tokenized securities traded on a blockchain the same legal standing as digital assets.\n\n00:34\n\nMarket Maker KeyRock Secures Swiss Anti-Money Laundering Clearance\n\n13:02\n\nRipple Exec on CBDC Platform, Metaco Acquisition\n\n07:51\n\nSwiss Regulator: Switzerland Faced a Bank Run if Credit Suisse Was Allowed to Go Bankrupt\n\n02:13\n\nHow Credit Suisse Developments are Impacting the Crypto Market"
