        "text": "Though each creative practice belongs to each individual in the group, we all exist together to support, encourage and secure the commitment we’ve made to the process. Together, we question, observe, and aim to integrate all of our capacities in alignment with the purpose of our practices.\n\n​\n\na container for growing intensity of engagement. This structure-of-consideration is here to encourage us all to show up fully into the practice.\n\nthe heart-practice,\n\nthe head-practice,\n\nthe hand-practice,\n\nthe whole-practice.\n\nJust after waking, each of us has an invitation to invent the world anew. Choosing the state of the heart is the first phase of creating. This is done in two movements. Firstly, emptying all that the heart carries which does not belong to it - accumulations of feelings and inherited stories that do not serve. Once these layers are observed and released, with newly secured emptiness and spaciousness and to whatever depth is available, you can name a “point of reverence” that you will care for as your day unfolds. Heart-centered practice includes all meditative, contemplative, and embodiment practices (i.e. - yoga, tai chi, breathwork, or even a forest walk).\n\n​\n\nThink of this like a preparation of the grounds. You first clear anything growing on the surface, digging past the layers of accumulation. You loosen the topsoil, and maybe even amend it with essential nutrients, creating exactly the right conditions for growth, until you have thoroughly prepared the grounds for planting. And then, from that state of openness and receptivity, you choose the seed you will plant and lay it gently in the fertile soil of your core.​\n\nNow is the moment for meaning-making. Human beings are story-making-creatures. We thrive on vision. Learning, the quest for understanding, reflection, absorbing inspiration from all directions and sources, discussion, reading, writing or drawing practice, profound dialogue, musical improvisation… The head-practice gets the mind reengaged in the envisioning of the new world you are fostering. The mind is a connection-generator. It is fueled by curiosity and discovery - the ideal state through which to encounter ‘the other.’ Any other.\n\n​\n\nHere, the seed germinates. Its coding begins to activate and come alive. It sprouts. It reaches out its roots. It strives toward the sun - knowing, somehow miraculously, in which direction to extend even if it is still buried in darkness. It follows the subtle inner-knowing.\n\nOnce the new vision, a new story has crystalized - it’s time to make it real. Time to live it. Working with the hands is about materializing that which lives until now only in the mind, the imagination, or perhaps raw and unshaped upon the page. It is also about care. Moving from words to action. Entering into the concrete, shared reality means listening to voices of various needs. This listening process might be called “response-ability.” The ability to respond. Often this is a period of tending to either the concretization of the idea-seed, or the honoring of commitments. These commitments are not outside of the creative process. They are a part of it. They are your laboratory in which to experiment how your heart and mind influence your way of doing and your impact on the environment around you. This is also a practice. We take a bit more time for this phase because the body (physical world) moves at a slower speed than the other aspects.\n\nAt the moment the seed-sprout pierces the surface of the soil, a new work begins. Now it is the time to protect and care for the plant as it grows. That might mean watering or feeding, fencing off or sheltering the young plant, eventually trimming or pruning. If, for example, you have planted an apple seed - it will take years of devotion to the health and wellness of the tree until it eventually gives fruit. This phase is the labor of love.\n\nBy uniting your heart, head, and hands into one whole - it is possible to leave the soulless cycle of transaction and enter into a disposition of offering. This phase is about transmission. Here, your inner and outer work merges into a state that is ready to be communicated and circulated. And this is the work - the vulnerability of making your gift available to others, and the faith that your heart-seed has given fruit that will provide the quality of true nourishment.\n\nThe fruit has ripened. Now is the time for harvest and distribution. Where will you take your fruit? Who will you give it to? Where will it travel? What will it become as it leaves your care? This fruit is not destined for the marketplace. In the market, there are buyers and sellers. Separation. Somehow through the act of offering, it is easiest to recognize the way in which all is connected, and all is shared.\n\nTemenos fellows, in addition to their own lodging here on campus, have continuous access to a number of inviting spaces and areas for collective use. These collective spaces indicate some fundamental beliefs about the environmental conditions that might best support the creative cycle.\n\nThe Library (includes the “library of love” collection of books donated to assist love-studies; a projector and cinema screen; a fireplace, lounging area and large tables for conferences and workshops)\n\nThe Greenhouse Dôme (a space for individual or collective alignment practices and performance practice)\n\nThe Stables (a collective atelier/studio for creative practices - especially material processes in the visual arts; unavailable in spring session due to climate.)\n\nThe Hearth Kitchen (a wood-fired outdoor kitchen, sheltered, with a view of the valley - also an inviting space for exploratory culinary art, traditional craft-work, or eco-creative practices\n\nThe Wellness Area (a space to see how care of the body can impact the state of the mind and heart. Includes a pool, wood-fired sauna, nordic bath, and sun/rain/moon-bathing deck).\n\nThe Valley (a protected natural habitat for wildlife, enveloped by forest and tree-line, with a stream and a bridge for crossing to visit our wise, old oak-elder. This is also a space available for land art and site-specific installation.)\n\nThe Forest (the neighboring forest, with its several rivers and bouldery hillsides, is accessible from the property and includes well maintained paths for easy and safe walks day or night (as well as plenty of wilder corners). This forest will lead you on a walking loop of about 90 minutes to and from “The Forgotten Village” - a 400 year old settlement of stone ruins in the center of the wood.)\n\nAnd lastly, Our Animal-Family and their various habitats:\n\nLiving with animals can invite a powerful reminder to return to the most essential aspects of connection. Observing, bonding with, and caring for animals can increase inner-conditions for creative ‘fertility.’ Presently La SOURCE has on property a family of 11 goats, 3 sheep, a goose, a duck, chickens, and a dog; our neighbors also often pasture their horses on our grounds.\n\nOn-site resources and structures for cultivating extraordinary states.\n\nLeaving the frame of typical daily life to explore other ways of being can provide very fertile grounds in which to plant. Therefore, we encourage and facilitate experimentation.\n\n(Please note that none of these practices are expected, merely available for those curious and interested.)\n\nPresently, this includes:\n\nPeriods without technology\n\nPeriods in silence\n\nPeriods of fasting\n\nPeriods in meditative isolation\n\nPeriods in creative isolation\n\nPeriods in darkness (otherwise known as ‘darkness retreats’)\n\n… (and soon to come: periods in natural immersion)\n\n​\n\nAgain, all of these processes are optional. We’re happy to provide more details on exactly how these practices can happen. We are also utterly open to the proposition of additional forms and will do all we can to safely support them.\n\nA poet, a scientist, a farmer, and a monk\n\nare sitting together around a table.\n\nAn unlikely gathering.\n\nWhat do they speak about?\n\nImagine that they must build the world anew together.\n\nThey have millions of decisions to make. How will they deliberate?\n\nImagine, for a moment, a disagreement\n\nregarding the prevention of poverty.\n\nThe scientist says\n\nto the poet studying a fallen nest, “You’re wasting time.”\n\nto the farmer tilling the field, “You must consider the big picture.”\n\nto the monk praying for the world, “This is irrational; you will accomplish nothing.”\n\nThe poet says\n\nto the farmer, “Your responsibility is heavy; your work is hard and long. You forget to live.”\n\nto the monk, “You cannot reach the ears of god without a passion burning in you.”\n\nto the scientist, “You are strategic and cold. Without beauty, the world is a meaningless mechanism.”\n\nThe farmer says\n\nto the monk, “You can’t eat prayer.”\n\nto the scientist, “All talk, no action.”\n\nto the poet, “Child.”\n\nThe monk says\n\nto the scientist, “Your facts do not yield true clarity.”\n\nto the poet, “Your fascination does not reveal true beauty.”\n\nto the farmer, “Your grains do not provide true nourishment.”\n\nAnd they go around like this…name-calling…because they have not yet recognized the gifts each of them offers in the process. They have not fully invited the others into the co-creation."
