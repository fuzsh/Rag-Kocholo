Copyright 2012 © Celent, a division of Oliver Wyman, Inc. 3 Executive Summary Core banking is the central processing unit of a bank. The banks, with the help of software vendors, have found the opportunity to leverage multiple channels in order to deliver products and facilitate transac- tions. What was once a system heavily reliant on the paper-based operations, has now been revolutionized by digital alternatives, bring- ing with it a new wave of automation. Efficiency and increased productivity are the standards. Branch networks are increasingly able to utilize the cohesive properties of new core systems. The global core banking market looks mature, with a significant per- centage of banks having replaced their legacy systems with more efficient and flexible core banking systems. The desire to change core generally depends on the size of the bank, with smaller seemingly more willing to undergo a switch, yet with larger banks having more capital with which to do so, increasing their momentum within the core market. The main drivers for core replacements are numerous. The most obvious is modernization: providing a more cost effective and efficient way to run core processes. The importance of analytics and its application with regard to the view of the customer and cus- tomer service can also be a subdriver for core modernization. Most emerging markets are finding core replacement a necessity to compete in an ever more competitive, and regulated banking environment, spurring lots of movement in new geographies. Some of the other global trends among the large banks are: ̈ Preference for an SOA-based system. With many large banks having a number of independent systems working from dif- ferent vendors and in different environments, a service- oriented architecture can provide better integration between disparate entities. ̈ Analytics, customer-centricity, and multichannel technolo- gies. Banks increasingly want a core system that utilizes data analytics to provide a more complete view of the customer, which then allows for better customer-bank communication. Multichannel options like ATM, mobile, Internet, and IVR are crucial in attracting and serving customers. Core banking solutions are also expected to facilitate product development and provide flexible customization capabilities.\n\n4. 4 Copyright 2012 © Celent, a division of Oliver Wyman, Inc. ̈ Reduced implementation time. Replacing and centralizing a new system needs to then be done in a phased but efficient way as to minimize this impact. For large banks with a lot of branches, a complete replacement with reduced implemen- tation time would be a challenge for the vendors. Smaller banks will tend to migrate DDA accounts over to a new sys- tem at the same time, while larger institutions will first launch new products and then slowly, if at all, migrate the current accounts. ̈ Major preference for in-house implementation. A majority of large banks in developing countries prefer in-house imple- mentations to hosted implementations. However, offshore branches for large institutions might opt for a hosted solu- tion, especially when engaging in an outsourced service agreement. In this report, Celent examines the solutions focused on the large banks around the world using Celent’s ABCD Vendor View. The vendor with the most advanced technologies is TCS BaNCS. On the breadth of functionality dimension, Accenture Alnova scored over other solu- tions. Temenos T24 has the largest customer base, as estimated by weighted average asset size, among the solutions covered in this report. FIS Profile and FIS Systematics lead in depth of client services. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show a breakdown of each vendors customer base by asset size, taking into account percentages and total numbers for each tier. Figure 3 on page 6 looks at each vendors’ percentage of hosted vs on-premise implementations.\n\n5.

Copyright 2012 © Celent, a division of Oliver Wyman, Inc. 7 This report contains a detailed analysis of vendor solutions with a summary on the strengths and weakness of each product. We analyse solutions catering to large banks around the world. This report is one in a series of vendor analysis of core banking solutions. The other reports are: ̈ Core Banking Solutions for Small Banks—A North American Perspective, March 2012 ̈ Core Banking Solutions for Large and Midsize Banks—A North American Perspective, March 2012 ̈ Core Banking Solutions for Small Banks—A Global Perspective, February 2012 ̈ Core Banking Solutions for Midsize Banks—A Global Perspective, February 2012 Classification of Vendor Solutions Celent has broken down the core banking solutions based on the geo- graphical location of their customer bases and the size of the banks served. We have defined core banking solutions for large banks as those solu- tions who have more than 20% of their clients with more than $20 billion in assets or more than 10 clients over $100 billion in assets. In this report, we cover solutions where more than 10% of the banks are located in regions other than North America.\n\n8. Copyright 2012 © Celent, a division of Oliver Wyman, Inc. 8 ABCD Analysis and XCelent Awards Celent has developed a framework for evaluating vendors called the ABCD Vendor View. This is a standard representation of a vendor mar- ketplace designed to show at a glance the relative positions of each vendor in four categories: Advanced technology, Breadth of functional- ity, Customer base, and Depth of client services. The factors used to evaluate each vendor in this report are listed in Table 1. Table 1: ABCD Scoring for Core Banking Solutions Category Factors Included Advanced Technology ̈ Architecture ̈ Hardware platform ̈ Integration (messaging/middleware layer) ̈ User interface ̈ Operating systems ̈ Databases Breadth of Functionality ̈ Teller/Platform ̈ Internet / Mobile ̈ ATM ̈ Loan Origination ̈ Mortgage Servicing ̈ Wealth Management/Securities/ Mutual Funds ̈ Letters of Credit ̈ Cash Management ̈ Remote Deposit Capture ̈ Payroll ̈ Small Business Administration (SBA) ̈ Asset Liability Management ̈ Bill Pay ̈ Cards ̈ Customer Data Analytics/ CRM ̈ Data Warehouse ̈ Risk Management ̈ Payments ̈ Transfers ̈ Customization Capabilities ̈ Languages Supported ̈ Currency Supported Source: Celent\n\n9. Copyright 2012 © Celent, a division of Oliver Wyman, Inc. 9 Advanced technology is based on the architecture of the system. Is the system written in an object-oriented language? Is a smart client used for the user interface? Can the system be ported to other operating sys- tems and databases easily? Celent gave high marks to vendors that have incorporated recent technological advancements in their solutions. The Breadth of Functionality dimension looks at the various front end systems and other functionalities offered by the vendor. Celent gave highest marks to vendors that offered pre-integrated features. Customer base was estimated based on the number of banks served as well as the breakdown of customer by assets. A vendor that has 20 banks with US$200 million in assets isn't as large as a vendor that has 20 banks with US$2 billion in assets. Celent estimated an average asset size for each asset bucket in the vendor questionnaire and estimated total assets of customers using the core system. Depth of client services measured the level of maintenance and post- implementation support offered by the vendor. Celent gave high marks to vendors that offered change management, training support, robust customer feedback options, and continual monitoring and updates. Note that different banks have different priorities, and the banks need to consider which dimensions are important in their environments. For example, if a bank wishes to implement the core as a hosted solution, without investing in modern platforms, advanced technology might not be a priority. If the bank chose to implement a best-of-breed inte- gration instead of a single vendor, the B dimension can be discounted.

The XCelent Awards Within this methodology, the top performers for each category received a corresponding XCelent Award: ̈ XCelent Technology for the leading Advanced Technology score. ̈ XCelent Functionality for the leading Breadth of Functional- ity Score. ̈ XCelent Customer Base for the leading Customer Base score. ̈ XCelent Service for the leading Depth of Service score. XCelent Technology and XCelent Functionality Figure 4 positions each vendor along two dimensions: the vertical axis displaying the relative rankings for Advanced Technology and the hori- zontal axis showing relative Breadth of Functionality rankings. The XCelent Technology Award is given to TCS BaNCS. TCS BaNCS runs on a multi-tiered architecture which is message-based and compatible with .NET or J2EE channel applications. Infosys Finacle and Accenture Alnova also scored well in that category, utilizing an advanced archi- tecture developed on C++ and Java and SOA / Web services compliance, respectively. The XCelent Functionality Award is goes to Accenture Alnova. Accen- ture Alnova offers almost all of their features with the core at no charge, or as an optional module that is part of the same code base. Temenos T24 also scored well in this dimension. T24 doesn’t usually ship most of the modules as base core code, but offers almost all of them as optional modules that share the same code base.\n\n11. Copyright 2012 © Celent, a division of Oliver Wyman, Inc. 11 XCelent Customer Base and XCelent Service Figure 5 on page 12 positions each vendor along two dimensions: the vertical axis displaying the relative level of depth of customer service and the horizontal axis displaying the relative customer base. The XCelent Customer Base Award goes to Temenos T24, showing a wide geographical spread of their customer base, and a large number of customers across the globe. The next in customer base are FIS Core- bank, CSC Celeriti, FIS Systematics. FIS Systematics and FIS Profile were the winners of the XCelent Service Award. FIS Profile and Systematics provide a wide array post-imple- mentation management consulting, training, and continuous system monitoring tailored to the individual needs of the bank clients. They also include a number of faculties which support customer feedback.

Banking Features Table 2 on page 12 and Table 3 on page 13 summarize the different front end systems supported by the core banking solution. In this seg- ment, the banks would prefer not to invest in a wide range of modules, but instead would be selecting appropriate modules based on their specific needs. Therefore, while almost all the channels are supported by the core banking systems, they are offered as optional modules.

CSC’s offerings include system design and integration, informa- tion technology and business process servicing, applications software development, web and application hosting, mission support, and man- agement consulting. With 97,000 employees and annual revenue of $16.2 billion for 12 months ending September 30, 2011, CSC provides software solutions and services for all sectors of the global financial services industry. In 2010, CSC acquired Vulnerability Research Labs (a cyber threat intel- ligence firm). CSC also acquired Covansys (an Indian IT company) in 2007, Object Builder Software (a Bulgarian IT services firm) in 2008, and VIXIA (an IT consulting firm in Latin America) in 2011. CSC has partnerships in banking with IBM, Communication Intelli- gence Corporation (CIC) (eSignature solutions), and CallMiner (enterprise speech analytics) for technology and functionality enhancements. Additionally, CSC is an IFX Board member and acquired a Brazil-based financial services consulting firm, VIXIA, to focus on the Latin American financial market. Celeriti from CSC is a service-oriented customer-centric application suite with products offering payment, lending, card, merchant, and deposits solutions. In 2010, Celeriti was introduced as a new end-to- end suite of products, components, and Web services leveraging intel- lectual property from the Hogan core banking suite. First Tennessee Bank recently implemented the Celeriti Bank suite, upgrading from the Hogan legacy platform. As shown in Figure 8, The Hogan/ Celeriti system is implemented and supported in 48 financial institutions around the world. Figure 9 shows the Hogan/ Celeriti client breakdown by asset size.\n\n28. 28 Copyright 2012 © Celent, a division of Oliver Wyman, Inc. Celeriti is an integrated banking suite available on IBM System z/OS, z Linux, UNIX and Windows. CSC acquired Hogan suite of banking appli- cations when it acquired Continuum and Hogan Systems in 1996.

Copyright 2012 © Celent, a division of Oliver Wyman, Inc. 29 platform was originally created from scratch in 1981. In 2010, CSC introduced Celeriti as a new end-to-end enterprise suite, leveraging Hogan’s functionality, yet adding numerous new components. Celeriti is considered an upgrade for the previous Hogan suite, and as such, is only live with a fraction of Hogan’s current client base. The Celeriti suite is built on a Service-Oriented Architecture, including IFX 2.x Web services and business processes. It also features a data warehouse, business intelligence, a new Web portal based user inter- face, and business rules and parameters for product and system configuration. The suite includes Celeriti Customer, Celeriti Deposits, Celeriti Loans, Celeriti Cards, and Celeriti Merchant. It utilizes IBM WebSphere, InfoSphere, and Cognos middleware applications, and is available on the mainframe as well as a range of distributed platforms. Celeriti is designed to run on multiple platforms (all of those listed in the table below) or a combination of platforms (a hybrid approach). For example, a bank could run their Web Portal on Windows, their SOA and Web Services on z Linux, and their core processing on z/OS. Three of the largest financial institutions using Hogan/Celeriti: ̈ Wells Fargo, San Francisco, CA: $1.2 trillion in assets—Hogan Customer Information System and Hogan Integrated Deposit Systems. ̈ Westpac Bank, Sydney, Australia: $700 billion in assets— Hogan Customer Information System and Hogan Integrated Deposit Systems. ̈ U.S. Bank, Minneapolis, MN: $290 billion in assets—Hogan Customer Information System and Hogan Integrated Deposit Systems.

Copyright 2012 © Celent, a division of Oliver Wyman, Inc. 75 Temenos T24 is a universal core bank solution. The system is designed to run in C or Java, depending on the chosen framework, and utilizes open-standards. The solution covers various business lines including retail, universal, corporate, Islamic, microfinance, private wealth man- agement, and community banking. The product was originally created as Globus by Ernst Hennche, formerly of Citibank and Lloyds Bank as a pure treasury back office system. In 1993, it was purchased by Temenos (then known as Conquer The World (CTW) Limited). The product was rearchitectured and rebranded to Globus and then T24 in 2004. The T24 framework is written in C, C++, and Java. The domain specific language is their propietary language, jBC, from which Java or C can be generated depending on the nature of the implementation require- ments. This allows the product to run in multiple platforms and maximizes code portability. T24 has never been rewritten, but has gone through a number of rearchitectures to add functionality.
