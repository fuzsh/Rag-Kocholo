        "text": "This year, 19 private banks have won more than one award. Of these, six institutions - including Citi Private Bank, BTG Pactual, Erste Private Banking, HSBC Private Banking, Northern Trust, Itaú Private Bank – gained the top position in three categories each\n\nBest global private bank; Best chief investment office in private banking; Best private bank for entrepreneurs\n\nCiti Private Bank\n\nOne of the main organisational changes at Citi came after the announcement in January 2021 that it had created a single wealth management firm, Citi Global Wealth (CGW), unifying teams from global consumer banking and Citi Private Bank. Management – from group boss Jane Fraser, through to CGW head honcho Jim O’Donnell and its Emea leader Luigi Pigorini – like to call it a “single, integrated platform serving clients across the wealth continuum”.\n\nThey talk about “leveraging our entire franchise” and “tapping into our broader framework”. According to Ida Liu, global head of Citi Private Bank: “Clients across all levels of wealth want the same thing – for their financial lives to be simpler and tailored to their needs.”\n\nThe real story is that, like many in the private banking competitive landscape, Citi has at last realised it is missing out on an even bigger chunk of revenues, by restricting itself to the ultra-high net worth space in many markets.\n\nYet the bank remains conscious of its image and insists exclusivity is not being totally ditched. In the UK, Citi proposes to focus its personal banking and wealth management business on a smaller number of “select” clients, while giving these high net worth individuals access to the broader range of bespoke products and services previously only available to those at the top of the tree.\n\n“Citi Private Bank has established expertise in servicing clients with complex wealth management needs, particularly in the ultra-high net worth bracket. In the UK, we would like to share that expertise with clients who have net worth in the £10m-£25m ($28m) range, where we are confident we could add value,” says Mr Pigorini.\n\nThis “sharing” expertise across a broader base is not to be sniffed at, as the 18-strong CGW chief investment office under David Bailin in New York has a track record of reacting quickly to market trends.\n\nAllocations to real estate, for instance, were recommended during “peak pessimism” around this sector at the height of the 2020 lockdown, leading to significant gains once normality returned. Similarly in 2022, a thematic allocation to global pharmaceuticals outperformed global equities by 13 per cent, says the bank.\n\nMr Bailin’s team works closely with both family offices and entrepreneurs, enjoying around 1600 relationships with the wealthiest families, typified by significant, concentrated equity positions, plus large portfolios embracing private equity, venture capital and real estate assets.\n\n“When events such as the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the rapidly changing relationship between the US and China, and major Fed policy shifts occur, our advice goes well beyond how to manage risk,” says Mr Bailin, chief investment officer and head of CGW investments.\n\n“We aim to build portfolios that anticipate where investment opportunities may arise as unexpected events unfold.” YB\n\nBest private bank in Europe; Best private bank in Switzerland\n\nPictet\n\nPictet has been busy reinforcing its European footprint across a number of target markets. In 2020, the group opened a bank in Monaco, a hotly contested and vibrant market.\n\nOver the past 18 months, Pictet has also welcomed new leaders in France, the UK and Iberia, namely Jean-Baptiste Douin, Robert Suss and Pedro Gonzalez Grau, respectively.\n\nWhile there was previously much talk within the group of downgrading the London office and investing more in EU country Luxembourg as the new post-Brexit hub, the bank now denies that this is part of the European strategy. Luxembourg boasts 500 Pictet staff, with investment increasing in Pictet Technologies.\n\n“Our London operations have been strengthened after Brexit, with several new bankers joining and we look forward to adding more,” says Sven Holstenson, head of Europe for Pictet Wealth Management. “Brexit, in this sense, has not changed the strategic place held by the UK for the Pictet Group.”\n\nFor Pictet, Europe and Asia are both seen as the key growth regions in wealth management. “In Europe, we are not prioritising specific markets, but rather investing across the board to ensure a common culture and approach. We prefer to focus on the quality of our investment strategies and services to our clients, instead of a market in particular,” says Mr Holstenson.\n\nAsia follows a similar philosophy, with teams based in Hong Kong and Singapore. Both regions posted a record year in 2021 across all key metrics, despite the ongoing unprecedented disruption due to the Covid-19 pandemic, says the bank. Pictet also stresses the importance of “reciprocity” between the asset management and wealth management divisions, to spur the growth of both. YB\n\nBest private bank in Central and Eastern Europe; Best private bank in Austria; Best private bank in Slovakia\n\nErste Private Banking\n\nIn each country in central and eastern Europe in which Erste Group operates in, the bank offers a highly personalised private banking advisory service.\n\n“While every local private banking unit has specific local solutions, which consider the local tax, currency and regulatory environment, our clear common focus is discretionary portfolio management,” says Maximillian Clary und Aldringen, head of private banking and wealth management, Erste Bank Oesterreich. “Our solution can be highly individualised according to the needs of each customer, covering all relevant asset classes and product categories, as well as environmental, social and governance criteria.”\n\nThe benefits of employing a highly individual approach can be a differentiator to the services offered to lower wealth segments. “It is the only reason why customers are willing to pay for our services,” says Mr Clary und Aldringen.\n\nIn Slovakia, Jana Holiková, the team leader entrusted with the management of Erste Private Banking operations in the country, says her team has worked hard to engage with the younger generation of investors. She says they are receiving a transfer of assets from a generation of entrepreneurs who started businesses after the revolution in the early 1990s and who are now passing on their businesses to their inheritors.\n\n“As they were mostly the first generation to start the business, there is a lack of knowledge of when and how to include family members in it. We are trying to be the partner who can advise and guide them through the life cycle of their company and to be a partner for the next generation as well,” says Ms Holiková. LH\n\nBest private bank in the Middle East\n\nJulius Baer\n\nThe Middle East, according to senior bankers at Julius Baer, represents an important growth market and is a key pillar of the Zurich-based bank’s long-term strategy.\n\nThe bank opened its office in Dubai 18 years ago and became the first organisation to be licensed in the Dubai International Financial Centre.\n\n“Over the past 20 years, the Middle East has become a global hub, a link between East and West, a gateway for Asian companies to Africa, a home for the expats and entrepreneurs who have found success and prosperity,” says Yves Robert-Charrue, head of Switzerland and Emea at Julius Baer.\n\n“The region has made considerable economic progress and has also positioned itself very well globally coming out of the pandemic, with strong business and economic fundamentals and social infrastructure for wealthy investors.”\n\nDubai is favoured by the bank as a hub for cross-border business and Qatar will be earmarked for similar growth. In 2020, Julius Baer set out a new strategy for its Swiss home market, with a strong focus on expanding segment-specific solutions, adding a real estate offering in 2021.\n\nThe bank has made recruitment a particular priority, focusing on senior talent but also tapping into the next generation of aspiring relationship managers. “Through dedicated training programmes, we are driving the development of our internal talent pool, which will become increasingly important,” says Mr Robert-Charrue.\n\n“Our investment into upskilling will continue through our well-established, in-house Julius Baer Academy. And we are constantly looking at how to meet tomorrow’s needs with the creation of new role profiles and career pathways, such as junior relationship managers or account managers.” YB\n\nBest private bank in Asia; Best private bank for alternatives\n\nUBS\n\nUBS bosses emphasise that much of the bank’s progress has been achieved by developing products for institutional as well as private clients, spurring innovation in alternative assets, often structured in bespoke, separately managed accounts.\n\nThe bank’s research shows investors, particularly those from the family office space, are increasingly snapping up opportunities in private equity, private debt and real estate: 42 per cent plan to increase direct private equity allocations, while 38 per cent intend to raise investments in private equity funds and funds of funds. The bank claims these higher weightings are paying off in performance figures.\n\nAlthough the bank prefers to invest client monies in funds, it is also scaling up its co-investments in private equity. Towards the end of 2022, UBS Global Wealth Management (GWM) will be offering larger clients “the opportunity to co-invest alongside some of our largest and most established global partners in selective opportunities”.\n\nTo douse any unease about a repeat of the collapse of illiquid alternatives at the time of the 2008 global financial crisis, UBS is insisting the “market today is very different compared to 15 years ago”, citing improved manager selection and due diligence procedures by “teams of dedicated experts” under the auspices of its chief investment office. These days, the bank says it works with large, long-term partners, enjoying multi-cycle track records.\n\nUBS is hoping for a seamless top management transition, with Naureen Hassan replacing long-standing company man Tom Naratil, taking the title ‘president of the Americas’, driving regional strategic growth and digital initiatives. Iqbal Khan becomes sole president of UBS GWM.\n\nWhile the fortunes of UBS have been well ahead those of floundering rival Credit Suisse, it has not been plain sailing for Mr Khan and colleagues. UBS says it remains committed to the “build-out of our digital wealth management offering”, yet has terminated the $1.4bn acquisition of robo-adviser Wealthfront, by mutual agreement between the two partners. The idea was to service what the bank likes to call its HENRY’s – High Earners, Not Rich Yet, representing a wealth base of up to $8tn.\n\nMr Khan has stayed tight-lipped about reasons for the pull-out, stressing growth in this segment will be “organically” led. It is believed this will be a hybrid service, based on a digital-first offering, yet with more input from the chief investment office and the broader wealth management offering.\n\nSome analysts have not been impressed by the U-turn. “The UBS business has of course progressed in these tough conditions and has done some amazing things, but I think they have just done an incredibly daft move in backing out of the Wealthfront deal,” says one consultant who has worked closely with UBS. “One could argue that the Wealthfront deal was initially very foolhardy and should not have been committed to. That said, when you commit, then you commit. It reeks of indecision.”\n\nMr Khan is, however, keener to talk about the key position of Asian opportunities in his growth plan. He emphasises that although the firm’s business is skewed towards Greater China, the south-east Asian economies will play an increasingly important part in the bank’s portfolio of new business. YB\n\nBest private bank in Latin America; Best private bank in Brazil; Best private bank in Colombia\n\nBTG Pactual\n\nWhen it comes to liquid markets, BTG Pactual Wealth Management says its portfolio management service is based on an asset diversification approach balancing strategic allocation with well-defined tactical deviations, reflecting opportunist market views. It says the building blocks of tactical deviations are economic outlook, definition of expected returns for the universe of investable asset classes and portfolio optimisation.\n\nBTG holds monthly investment committee meetings to determine asset allocation under the Black-Litterman portfolio optimisation model, which many feel is outdated. Investment decisions are communicated to clients by monthly letters and ad-hoc communiques, as well as a new monthly podcast, complemented by one-to-one calls.\n\nA key area of BTG’s approach is its alternatives programme, which invests in a combination of public and private strategies based on an assessment of managers’ ability to deal with uncertainty, nurture networks; capacity to be mentor/problem-solver; and strong track record in identifying trends and accessing high calibre deals.\n\nThe main alternative strategies of the programme are in hedge funds, deploying further capital to big brand managers, Brevan Howard, TCI, Sequoia Capital, Coatue, Point72 and Perceptive Advisors. There is a reluctance at BTG to bear incremental risk by accessing private markets.\n\nLast year, BTG hosted its first financial education programme designed specifically for women, reflecting the fact that 30.2 per cent of clients were women in 2021, marginally up from the previous year.\n\nBTG says its vision of sustainability reflects a long-term ambition and commitment to responsible and sustainable development. In 2020, a new division was created, focused on sustainable and impact investing, consolidating BTG as a hub to connect global investors to opportunities in Latin America related to sustainable finance, environmental, social and governance, and impact investing funds, as well as carbon markets. LH\n\nBest private bank in Andorra\n\nCrèdit Andorrà\n\nThe key challenge of Crèdit Andorrà’s 2021-2023 strategic plan has been strengthening the bank’s leadership in the Andorran market and consolidating its international presence, particularly in Luxembourg, Spain and the US.\n\nStrategic alliances enabled Crèdit Andorrà to enhance the service offered to customers. “These operations give us a greater competitive edge to impact positively on the value proposition – focusing on specialisation and innovation – in terms of product offerings, technology and the digital transformation,”says Xavier Cornella, chief executive officer of Crèdit Andorrà Financial Group.\n\nThe international unification of the bank’s brand is another pillar “underpinning our actions, helping strengthen our leadership, generate group synergies and boost the sense of belonging within our team, our main asset”, adds Mr Cornella.\n\nThe main “benefits” of the strategic plan have been corporate operations completed throughout 2021 and 2022, organic growth achieved through careful and responsible management, and partnerships enabling the bank to add value. “These have all made the group stronger, more resilient and competitive,” he claims.\n\n“They have also made it possible to strengthen our current business and face the challenges we have taken on with greater guarantees for our shareholders, customers, employees and Andorra as a whole. Our goal is to grow sustainably while ensuring optimal future development,” says Mr Cornella. “Our digitalisation initiatives have allowed us to strengthen relationships with customers through a more specialised and sustainable value proposition and by striving for excellent user experience, with complementary and synchronised digital and remote service channels.”\n\nIn the area of sustainability, Crèdit Andorrà became a signatory to the UNEP Finance Initiative Principles for Responsible Banking. It also acquired Vall Blanc and GBS Finanzas Investcapital in 2022, which enabled the bank to bolster its main business figures – profitability and assets under management, says Mr Cornella. LH\n\nBest private bank in Australia\n\nNAB Private Wealth\n\nOver the course of 2020 and 2021, National Australia Bank (NAB) merged three of its wholly owned businesses, including JBWere, NAB Private and nabtrade, to create a “fully integrated” wealth and advice offering under the new brand of NAB Private Wealth. This strategic shake-up has, according to NAB Private Wealth, provided greater latitude to serve customers in a “holistic manner”, including the provision of a full wealth offering through the use of in-house experts.\n\nThe transformation process itself, however, was far from problem-free. “The greatest challenge has been to transform and perform at the same time. During a period where we were transforming our business model – integrating our three wholly owned businesses into one – we were also performing at the top of our game,” says Ivano Simonutti, executive, NAB Private Wealth.\n\nMr Simonutti notes that client support was key to overcoming some of the associated challenges of the internal merger.\n\n“[We have a] client base that appreciates our strategy centred on supporting their private wealth journey, and are choosing to utilise our lending, deposit and investment facilities at unprecedented rates,” he says.\n\nMeanwhile, NAB Private Wealth has also pursued inorganic growth opportunities. In 2021, the acquisition of Citibank’s Australian wealth management business was announced, in a sign of NAB Private Wealth’s longer-term growth ambitions. Following the completion of regulatory approvals, the transaction was finalised on June 1, 2022.\n\nBeyond this, NAB Private Wealth has also been bolstering the number of bankers within its ranks, in line with its broader development strategy and to strengthen its capacity to provide client advice. JK\n\nBest private bank in Bahrain; Best private bank in Egypt\n\nAhli United Bank B.S.C.\n\nThe growth in high net worth individuals and family wealth across the Middle East has led to an increased need for sophisticated wealth management capabilities. Ahli United Bank (AUB) claims it is well positioned to cater to this growing demand, based on local reach and global expertise. Its wealth management operations benefit from AUB’s regional presence, with 158 branches across Bahrain, Kuwait, Egypt, Oman, Iraq, Libya, the UAE and the UK.\n\nThe bank has pushed through major initiatives over the past two years, to enhance the experience of clients and the level of service that relationship managers (RMs) provide. One major initiative was the launch of its Enterprise RM workbench, enabling digitally charted end-to-end journeys to be undertaken, with a focus on ‘A-Z’ automation.\n\n“To provide clients with greater access and control of their investments, we have also initiated a major project to launch an online investment portal which will serve as the basis for clients to have easy access to comprehensive portfolio reporting, analytics and to be able to digitally subscribe to investment products,” says Richard Jablonowski, group head of private banking and wealth management at AUB.\n\nThe bank also recently entered into agreements with both Principal Global, which manages close to $1tn, and Forbes Family Trust to provide research, market outlook and also advice on the construction of risk-based asset allocation models.\n\n“We believe that partnering with regional and global asset managers that have the expertise and experience in their areas of competence is an important way in which we can provide solutions that our clients may not otherwise have access to and that we do not have the experience ourselves of being able to provide,” says Mr Jablonowski. KG\n\nBest private bank in Belgium\n\nBNP Paribas Fortis Private Banking & Wealth Management\n\nBNP Paribas Fortis strives to offer an “inclusive, family and cross-generational approach” to managing client assets over the long term. The bank’s estate planners, supported by digital tools, provide “high quality advice” to help clients transfer their assets in the best possible way, says Stéphane Vermeire, general manager, BNP Paribas Fortis Private Banking & Wealth Management.\n\nCornerstone of the bank’s wealth planning approach is PaxFamilia, the digital platform developed by GuiSquare, a start-up in which BNP Paribas Fortis has a stake. The tool, which was enriched last year with an estate-planning module, gives an overview of the client’s personal situation, global assets, objectives and projects, allowing bankers to provide bespoke advice. It is also able to run simulations on the future evolution of client assets.\n\nThe Belgian bank says it has supported both small and large enterprises in their growth trajectory over the last 200 years, including during periods of crisis or uncertainty, says Mr Vermeire. The plan for 2023 is “to go one step further” and focus on providing an “integrated, one-single relationship manager-model” to make in-house expertise fully available to entrepreneurial clients, to meet their private and professional needs.\n\nFirst among Belgian banks, last year BNP Paribas Fortis launched a European long-term investment fund, an infrastructure strategy managed by BlackRock, and the plan is to further increase client access to private equity.\n\nThe bank has “a strong conviction on socially responsible and future-oriented management”, says Mr Vermeire, and enjoys around 32 per cent market share in sustainable investing in Belgium, according to consultancy association Forum Ethibel.\n\nThe way private banks deal with new environment, social and governance regulation will have a huge impact on the wealth management sector, says Mr Vermeire. “It is an immense challenge to comply with, yet it is also an opportunity for our bank to reaffirm our frontrunner position in sustainable and impact investing.” ET\n\nBest private bank in Bermuda; Best private bank in the Cayman Islands\n\nThe Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son Limited\n\nButterfield was established in 1858 as Bermuda’s first bank. Since then, it has grown to provide a range of bespoke financial services, as well as community banking offerings, from eight international financial centres. From a private banking perspective, Butterfield distinguishes itself through a “high-touch approach”, which the bank claims nurtures frequent one-to-one interactions between relationship managers and clients. It currently provides its private banking services in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and Guernsey.\n\nIn Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, private bankers act as the sole contact point for customers, granted access to both local and international services, coupled with a multi-jurisdiction trust network.\n\nAccording to Butterfield, this approach empowers bankers to be more thorough and dynamic in terms of their approach to developing, and delivering, financial solutions.\n\nBeyond its core private banking proposition, Butterfield also offers a suite of complementary offerings that include asset management, and trust and fiduciary services.\n\nFrom an asset management standpoint, clients can benefit from Butterfield’s discretionary portfolio management. In this respect, private bankers work jointly with internal asset managers to carve out an investment portfolio that aligns with a customer’s risk preferences, time horizon and fundamental investment objectives.\n\nWhen it comes to trust and fiduciary services, many of Butterfield’s private banking customers employ trust structures within the scope of their wider financial objectives and as part of their succession plans. Private bankers at Butterfield thus work with both in-house trust experts, as well as clients’ non-bank legal teams, to generate tailored trust solutions.\n\nMeanwhile, Butterfield continues to invest in its digital capabilities. In recent times, this has included the rollout of DocuSign technology to enable the bank to send, sign and manage agreements anywhere in the world. JK\n\nBest private bank in Bulgaria; Best private bank in Croatia\n\nUniCredit Bulbank Bulgaria/ Zagrebačka banka\n\nBulgaria and Croatia are two of the eight countries in central and eastern Europe (CEE) where UniCredit CEE Private Banking has local footprint.\n\nThe local banks leverage on the strong expertise of the group investment strategy and fund selection team. Most client assets are invested with global asset managers, including Amundi, BlackRock, Fidelity and JP Morgan, bringing global solutions to local markets.\n\nIn Bulgaria, UniCredit Bulbank has aimed to enhance client service by focusing on client needs by cluster, providing bespoke financial solutions and services, and introducing new partners in asset management, says Borislav Genov, head of retail banking and member of the management board, UniCredit Bulbank (Bulgaria).\n\nWhile still lagging western Europe, sustainable investing is developing and investment opportunities have increased in the country, leading the bank to introduce sustainable investing ratings for part of its investment products, in view of increased client interest and inflows.\n\n“As the bank with the biggest green loans portfolio in the country, at UniCredit Bulbank we follow two principles: first, lead by example, via implementing our own environmental, social and governance strategy as part of the business strategy and, second, develop the tools and products to enhance the transition of our clients,” explains Mr Genov.\n\nZagrebačka banka, the largest bank in Croatia, has a long history, having operated in the country for 105 years. As part of UniCredit, it is in the process of further simplifying its business by streamlining processes and harmonising its service model, while continuing to invest in digitalisation. The bank is committed to creating new products and services to meet client needs, while also improving client education, to improve their knowledge of financial solutions and understanding of market opportunities.\n\n“Zagrebačka banka has a strong brand that ensures high-quality service, security and support for its clients,” says Helena Ćorić, Zagrebačka banka’s head of private banking, praising employees who put “great effort in bringing value to our clients every day”. ET\n\nBest private bank in Canada\n\nRBC Wealth Management\n\nAs the largest wealth and asset manager in Canada, backed by the country’s biggest bank, RBC Wealth Management has the scale and resources to bring a full suite of solutions to clients, says Jennifer Publicover, senior vice-president, wealth management products and strategy at RBC Wealth Management.\n\nThis scale means RBC Wealth Management is able to continue investing in key distribution, product and digital capabilities, she says. “This in turn leads to better client outcomes and better adviser recruitment and retention, which then drives higher adviser productivity and higher market share,” adds Ms Publicover.\n\nBetter outcomes have also been achieved by broadening execution in both the RBC Premier Banking and RBC Private Insurance offerings across Canada, she claims. In RBC Premier Banking, gains have come from delivering a coordinated client experience where the client feels they are dealing with one organisation rather than multiple organisations, regardless of the different platforms or legal entities they may actually be engaged with.\n\n“It means ensuring all wealth management clients have a personalised banking approach and it means delivering more value to all of them,” she says.\n\nRBC Wealth Management has also benefited from a strategic alliance with BlackRock Canada which Ms Publicover says has delivered greater access to investment advisers and an ability to offer a full range of index-based products at scale.\n\nIntegrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into the investment selection process has also reaped rewards, she says. “ESG integration is a core pillar of our approach to responsible investment, and every investment team evaluates material ESG factors as a part of its investment decision-making.”\n\nThe bank believes issuers which manage their material ESG risks and opportunities effectively are more likely to outperform on a risk-adjusted basis over the long term. LH\n\nBest private bank in Chile\n\nLarrainVial\n\nGonzalo Córdova, partner at LarrainVial and CEO of wealth management at the Chilean bank, says innovations undertaken in technology have been key to delivering efficiencies.\n\n“Technological investment has allowed us to develop portfolio solution systems and client proposals designed according to their segmentation in a standardised format. Innovation has allowed us to hire younger bankers and to be more cost efficient. All this leads us to be more effective and to deliver a superior advisory service to our clients,” he claims.\n\nTechnology has also played a vital role in helping finesse communication with clients, says Mr Córdova. “Through our data analytics we have been able to communicate pertinent information and direct clients to our different seminars and activities that we consider of interest to them,” he says.\n\nAnother area that has augmented LarrainVial’s approach has been the development of the bank’s offering to family offices. “No longer focusing only on financial advice, the offer extends to comprehensive advice, through external experts where necessary, in other areas such as philanthropy, innovation, venture capital and tax advice,” says Mr Córdova.\n\nAdditionally, education has been crucial to improving the bank’s business model. “Education has been central to the training provided in the induction of wealth managers. We have become a banker training factory. Upon arrival, new hires are trained for three months in the area of LV Estrategia, an area that pulls together the profiling and portfolios recommended to clients,” says Mr Córdova.\n\n“All our financial knowledge is also shared with clients. Today we have an academy with online courses where we educate our clients. We also offer specialised ad hoc courses for more sophisticated clients,” he adds. LH\n\nBest private bank in China; Best performing private bank in Asia\n\nChina Merchants Bank\n\nChina’s private banking market has endured a number of challenges in recent times, including a shifting regulatory landscape and the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Even so, China Merchants Bank was able to grow its assets under management, operating income and client base at a steady clip in 2021. This was accompanied by efforts to augment its digital product and service offerings, with a focus on the development of a private banking interface on the CMB mobile application.\n\n“CMB utilises industry-leading fintech capabilities to support the digital transformation of private banking,” says Wang Yanrong, director of the private banking department of CMB.\n\n“Private banking works with the CMB technology department as an integrated team. We built an exclusive interface for high-end customers on CMB App, which has 100m users. After its launch in 2021, the click volume of the app of private banking customers soon doubled.”\n\nNevertheless, CMB’s digital progress has not been without its problems. In particular, balancing digital innovation with regulatory requirements in China is, according to Ms Wang, among the most salient hurdles the institution has faced.\n\n“The challenge is to deliver an excellent customer experience while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements,” she explains. “Some [of our] business must be handled offline due to regulatory requirements [in China]. For the rest, we make online services as efficient as possible.”\n\nIn 2021, CMB introduced a new integrated service system tailored to the specific needs of its clients. This includes a focus on the individual, the family, enterprises, and society as discrete segments, in contrast to purely offering retail services to high net worth customers, an approach CMB had originally pursued. JK\n\nBest private bank in Czech Republic\n\nČSOB Private Banking\n\nThe most resonant topics among the client base of Prague-based ČSOB are high inflation and elevated energy prices, which cause disruption to their businesses and trading operations.\n\nIn order to alleviate these concerns, ČSOB looks to its ultimate owner, Belgian bank KBC, for a product provision strategy, now shaped by sustainability and responsible investment values and priorities.\n\nThis dedication to ESG values can, however, cause difficulties in the bank’s home market, says Pavel Tichy, director of the wealth office at ČSOB Private Banking. “Even big names in the investment universe are not able to cope with our strict policies around responsible investing,” says Mr Tichy. “This often means we can end up with a less attractive third-party fund offer.”\n\nČSOB also sees more demand for private equity strategies and infrastructure loans.\n\n“Recently, we are seeing a trend of significantly greater representation of alternative investments alongside classic, but still functional instruments such as stocks, bonds and fixed income,” he says.\n\n“We are aware that this is not just a fashion trend and therefore alternative investments will play an increasingly important role for our clients, whether in real estate or private equity or venture capital funds.”\n\nWhile ČSOB has been working with KBC to create bespoke solutions in this sphere, the challenge, which Mr Tichy hopes to overcome, has been to hedge investments against Czech currency risk for local investors.\n\n“We expect more and more demand around these products for years to come and we aim to have 15 to 20 per cent of our assets under distribution exposed to alternative investments,” he says. YB\n\nBest private bank in Denmark\n\nNykredit Private Banking\n\nLotte Månsson, director of Nykredit Private Banking Elite, says that as the growth of the private banking client segment at the Danish bank continues to broaden, her team has had to adapt its value proposition.\n\nMs Månsson believes a clear benefit of targeting new segments is that it drives the private bank to see its business from fresh perspectives, leading to new ideas, products and offerings.\n\nTraining advisers to a new normal has certainly helped the offering. “We have many private bankers with a high level of professional knowledge, financial skills and know-how. Skills not equally nurtured in our sector are emotional skills, which is why our training has focused on improving advisers’ emotional skillset and becoming more self-aware and then aware of how to read different types of people as we see a more differentiated client segment today,” she says.\n\n“Our employee satisfaction score has been increasing continuously over the last couple of years and as has our customer net promoter score. Moreover, our churn rate is at its lowest point in our 15 years in business,” says Ms Månsson.\n\nAnother aspect of improving Nykredit’s private banking offer has been to get to know clients’ needs in depth through closer contact, she explains. “Through a continuous dialogue with clients, we have been moving even closer to them and have strengthened our relationship.”\n\nThe bank sees a big challenges in attracting the young generation. “Their behaviour and needs differentiate fundamentally from the generation we are serving now. The Gen Z and millennials think digitally in other ways than we do. If we are able meet their demands – and exceed them – I believe we are looking at a big growth opportunity in the future,” adds Ms Månsson. LH\n\nBest private bank in France\n\nBNP Paribas Banque Privée\n\nSupporting entrepreneurs and their families has been key to the ambitious growth plans of BNP Paribas Wealth Management across Europe, with a dedicated team of 300 employees built specifically to service these clients.\n\nThis approach involves bringing together investment strategies from the corporate and investment bank, the asset management division and the bank’s real estate arm, to help clients with what CEO Vincent Lecomte calls “a comprehensive approach, at the centre of all the group’s expertise”.\n\nMany of these clients are increasingly investing in private equity and real estate strategies, which the bank believes provide attractive investment opportunities in today’s market.\n\nAs the bank accelerates its “digital transformation”, it is promoting a new digital solution dedicated to private equity, real estate and infrastructure, called the ‘private assets portal’.\n\n“This platform offers our clients real time access to all information regarding their investments in private asset funds, to which they subscribed via electronic signature,” says Anne Pointet, deputy CEO at the firm.\n\nClients automatically receive notifications as soon as new information about one of their investments is published on the portal. According to Ms Pointet, millennial clients in particular are becoming more and more interested in private assets with an environmental, social and governance (ESG) tilt. They are expressing preferences for impact thematic funds around energy transition, social inclusion or protection of biodiversity.\n\nThe bank is particularly keen to provide tailor-made advice to each client relating to their journey around ESG and impact investments. According to Ms Pointet, this includes strategy definition, analysis of chosen causes, benchmarking, legal and fiscal environment, analysis of different philanthropic vehicles and structuring, methodologies on beneficiary selection and impact evaluation. YB\n\nBest private bank in Germany\n\nBERENBERG\n\nFounded by the Flemish Berenberg family in 1590, originally involved in the cloth trade and the import/export business, Berenberg is one of the world’s oldest banks and today has a strong focus on entrepreneurs.\n\nThe bank prides itself on offering clients the capability set of the whole firm, including wealth and asset management, along with investment and corporate banking. Through a platform of internal and external specialists, the German bank aims to create a network of entrepreneurs with similar mindsets and needs, while a dedicated team focuses on start-ups and young entrepreneurs.\n\nTo meet the specific needs of family offices, in 2020 Berenberg set up a new business division offering a range of services, including how to establish a family office structure, financing, asset management solutions and direct investments.\n\nIn the current challenging market environment, Berenberg’s active management, and long-term and diversified approach have paid off. Its multi-asset strategies have delivered positive returns, also thanks to careful selection of bonds, including short duration and niche themes, and alternative investments, including commodities and tail hedge certificates, which have helped to generate alpha.\n\nIn addition, Berenberg has expanded its wealth management services to include private equity (PE) and private debt. Thanks to the partnership with fintech PE investing platform Moonfare, Berenberg’s advisers can add PE funds to portfolio recommendations, taking into account the client’s investment goals and risk profile.\n\nClients can further diversify their portfolios through real estate and farmland, while the private bank leverages the corporate bank’s know-how in the infrastructure and energy sector to offer customers “innovative” investments in wind, solar and infrastructure projects.\n\nAt Berenberg wealth and asset management, environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are considered “key decision-making criteria”. “Taking ESG into account supports our portfolio management in the holistic assessment of risk and return,” says a bank spokesperson. ET\n\nBest private bank in Greece\n\nAlpha Private Bank\n\nPrivate Banking Services by Alpha Bank\n\nAlpha Bank’s priority is to establish a partnership with clients based on trust, while remaining committed to excellence in providing high quality services, says Andreas K. Katsogiannos, manager of the private banking division of Alpha Bank.\n\nThis can be achieved by utilising comprehensive access to the broad spectrum of Alpha Bank’s resources and capabilities enhanced by innovation and technology, he says. “We strive to create a personalised client experience by driving systematic client activation and proactive engagement enriched by a digitally-enabled approach which helps to grow our franchise and capture additional market share,” says Mr Katsogiannos.\n\nThe implementation of a coordinated plan incorporating swift adjustments and accelerating the use of remote services and digital channels enabled Alpha Bank to reinvent engagement with clients and, thus, enhance the client experience.\n\n“In this context, we are already in the process of digitally transforming our business model, redesigning our offering, re-engineering systems and efficiently streamlining processes, to deliver a new, simplified, more effective operating model while being fully compliant with the complex regulatory framework. Once implemented, we shall be able to provide enhanced customer experience and engagement, upgraded frontline experience and operational efficiency,” says Mr Katsogiannos.\n\nIncorporating digital technologies has delivered multiple benefits for its private banking proposition. These include front-line digital tools enhanced with functionalities that ensure compliance with regulations, internal controls that allow for risk monitoring of portfolios, as well as mechanisms that make process completion speedy and paperless. It also includes digital collaboration tools that provide automatic and paperless updates to clients.\n\n“The initiatives enable faster and more efficient service, thus, freeing up time and effort for the private banker to prioritise client experience and retention, as well as to focus on high-value activities such as advice, sales and attracting new clients that lead to increasing assets under management,” adds Mr Katsogiannos. LH\n\nBest private bank in Hungary\n\nOTP Private Banking\n\nA market leader in Hungary, Bulgaria and Montenegro, with a significant footprint in many other countries in the region, OTP Private Banking has continued to expand its operations, with its private banking services now available in Moldova, Albania and Slovenia.\n\n“OTP Private Banking has been able to grow, not just in Hungary, but in all the countries where we have subsidiaries. New private banking offices have opened or moved to more prestigious locations; new services and products were introduced; and meanwhile, our client base has been steadily growing,” says Attila Bánfi, managing director of OTP global markets.\n\nToday, OTP global markets has nearly 42,000 private banking clients across 11 countries. In Hungary, the bank has 24,500 private banking clients and a market share of around 35 per cent of managed assets.\n\nOTP Bank was the first bank in Hungary to introduce a private banking service model exclusively using digital channels, without any direct personal connection, with the new model providing a centralised virtual private banking hub based on remote elements, hybrid asset management solutions and aspects like video banking.\n\n“Personal contact is still one of the main principles for our work; however, in line with the global digital transformation, a clientele has arisen who demand the latest technical solutions, and the younger generation is increasingly turning towards digital tools in wealth management,” says Mr Bánfi. In just two years the platform has grown to more than 1300 customers utilising the service.\n\nIn 2021, OTP Bank also integrated its investment services and private banking services at a group level. “The period of the pandemic has naturally had an impact on our business processes,” says Mr Bánfi. “At the same time, on the organisational side, this was a period of growth and service development for OTP Private Banking.” KG\n\nBest private bank in Hong Kong; Best private bank in the UK; Best private bank in Asia for philanthropy services\n\nHSBC Global Private Banking\n\nIt has long been the aim of HSBC to bring its specialist investment expertise, global network and deep local insights to its Hong Kong client base, including the territory’s community of colourful tycoons and the broader cohort of wealthy individuals, pursuing family and business interests.\n\nNow the bank aims to build on this strength to establish a much deeper footprint across the region. “Similar to Hong Kong, we are also leveraging on the relationships built over the years in each of the key markets in Asia, including mainland China, Taiwan and the Asean markets,” says Siew Meng Tan, regional head of global private banking, Asia-Pacific, HSBC.\n\nShe reports a growing demand for philanthropic advisory services across the region, with the nature of this need changing fast.\n\n“Philanthropists are focused on driving long-lasting change in their communities and many have extended the way they create positive impact to include aligning their investments with their values,” says Ms Tan. “This could come in the form of investing in environmental, social and governance-screened funds to generate returns for donation; issuing their sustainability-linked bonds for their family business; or delving into impact investments.”\n\nWhile acknowledging the difficulty of luring high-quality staff to Hong Kong, with political difficulties challenges leading many to leaving for southern rival centre Singapore, the bank insists it is not struggling to retain talent. HSBC has operations in both jurisdictions.\n\n“Hong Kong and Singapore will continue to develop as leading international wealth hubs with distinct strengths,” says Ms Tan. “Asia is the place to be for anyone with ambitions to build a career in private banking.”\n\nThat said, a major priority for the bank remains the UK, which during Covid-19, saw both consolidation between established players and new entrants to the industry. In order to grow the private banking business there, HSBC has worked on improving the relationship with HSBC’s commercial bank, allowing a greater range of products to be distributed to private clients.\n\n“This, along with the work we have done to enhance the client continuum with our retail offering, puts us in a strong position to continue or accelerate the levels of growth that we have seen,” says Charles Boulton, chief executive of HSBC Global Private Banking.\n\n“We have gained market share consistently over the last four to five years and I expect that to continue,” he says. YB\n\nBest private bank in Italy\n\nMediobanca Private Banking\n\nWith a core area of expertise in private markets, Mediobanca Private Banking leverages synergies with the Mediobanca Group’s corporate and investment banking division to serve Italy’s large business families.\n\nIt positions itself as a “connection point” between private capital and investment opportunities in the real economy, either directly through club deals or indirectly through funds that invest in the sector.\n\nThrough its equity club deal (TEC), the Italian bank, which aims at becoming the “long-term partner of Italy’s top 500 business families”, completed several investments. These include Jakala, La Bottega, Philogen, Lincotek, CY4 Gate, Has and ART. In the real estate space, it offered co-investment opportunities in historical properties in Milan such as Santa Margherita 12, Turati 12, Palazzo delle Poste and Montebello 18.\n\nIn partnership with BlackRock, the bank launched an alternative fund allowing its ultra-high net worth clients to co-invest directly in unlisted, high-potential companies in the US, alongside private equity funds.\n\n“The project with BlackRock shows it is possible to replicate the success of the TEC initiative globally and create a customised private markets programme,” says Mediobanca Private Banking head, Angelo Viganò.\n\nIn partnership with Russell Investments, the bank offers clients access to funds of funds and a venture capital strategy.\n\nRising inflation and market volatility have increased client appetite for these uncorrelated investment solutions, with additional benefits being the alignment of interests between managers and investors, the long-term time perspective, and attractive returns.\n\nDespite overstretched valuations, markets in late cycle territory and high risk of recession, client investments in private assets, and especially private equity, will continue to grow in Italy, predicts Mr Viganò. “Data show private equity has provided investors with the highest risk-adjusted returns over the past three decades, having generated significantly higher returns with lower volatility compared to public markets, even during periods of crisis such as in 2008.”\n\nInvestors already have access to low-cost and highly diversified portfolios in the public market. “Private markets may be the only missing piece to enable investors to access the ‘free lunch’ of portfolio diversification,” adds Mr Viganò. ET\n\nBest private bank in India\n\nKotak Private Banking\n\nKotak Mahindra Bank’s private banking division, Kotak Private Banking, is one of the oldest and most well-established private banking institutions in India. It provides a full spectrum of wealth management services, including discretionary and non-discretionary investment advisory across various asset classes, as well as social impact investing and end-to-end banking solutions, among other offerings, to its diversified client base.\n\nKotak Private Banking has identified digital innovation and technology as a key pillar of future growth. To this end, it has embarked on a digital transformation journey to improve customer experience and operational efficiency. “The digital transformation journey for Kotak Private started as a tactical solution to cater to Covid-19 challenges. However, since then it has become a strategic part of Kotak Private’s proposition,” says Oisharya Das, chief executive of Kotak Private Banking.\n\nMoreover, Kotak Private Banking has been adapting its product and service offerings to meet the preferences of a new generation of entrepreneurial and wealthy clients that prefer a ‘Do it Yourself’ approach to their finances.\n\n“This required us to build new digital platforms catering to both sets of clients, as well as resetting the culture internally to propose solutions based on their preferences. Changing our culture required us to make life digital for our employees as well. For this we made automation the forefront of our business strategy and\n\ndigitised multiple workflows, business reporting and tracking to improve efficiencies of the teams,” says Ms Das.\n\nWhen it comes to succession planning, clients benefit from the expertise of a discrete subsidiary of Kotak Mahindra Bank, Kotak Mahindra Trusteeship Services. Client offerings include holistic succession plans, provision of an asset register and online will-writing services. JK\n\nBest private bank in Korea\n\nHana Bank\n\nIn an increasingly competitive space, Hana Bank has differentiated itself by focusing on a younger generation of private banking clientele.\n\nIn the post-pandemic period, the bank has pushed into more innovative and competitive services, expanding face-to-face offerings into areas like domestic tour services and matchmaking programmes for second-generation wealthy individuals.\n\nThe bank has also expanded into ‘integrated art banking services’, offering loans secured against artworks and opening the Hana Art Club community. It has also combined finance with gaming to target the younger generations of wealthy individuals.\n\n“The younger generation engaged in IT industries, such as start-up founders, have increased and emerged as newly high net worth individuals in recent years,” says Yoonshik Cho, head of the wealth management division at Hana Bank. “Hana Bank has regarded them as potential VIP clients in the near future and focused on customised products and differentiated marketing for capturing them proactively,” he adds.\n\nThe bank now operates two branches of its private members clubs, Club1, in Gangnam and Gangbuk, as a private community space for wealthy young people. It plans to open a third Club1 in the Seocho area of Gangnam later this year.\n\nMeanwhile, it has also made a strategic alliance with BuildBlock, a US real estate investment platform covering everything from brokerage to investments, in order to meet its clients’ desires for investments in US real estate. It has also begun working with NGeneBio, which has developed next-generation genomics sequencing for VIP customised healthcare services and information. KG\n\nBest private bank in Luxembourg; Best private bank in Europe for succession planning\n\nSociété Générale Private Banking\n\nSeveral years after pulling out of key Asian growth markets, Société Générale Private Banking is leveraging its expertise in banks based in Luxembourg, Monaco and Switzerland to better meet clients’ needs. Together, these entities manage $33bn in assets, serviced by 500 staff.\n\nManagement of assets is the key priority, says the bank, although clients are also assisted with wealth structuring, including succession planning. Clients now have a single contact, who provides them with simplified access to all the bank’s areas of expertise, wherever their booking centre may be.\n\nThe Luxembourg office in particular is being developed as a hub for creation of new products. The bank says: “Société Générale Private Banking Luxembourg offers global solutions for financial engineering and wealth management, as well as global expertise in the field of structured derivatives, hedge funds, mutual funds, private equity, life insurance and real estate investment solutions.”\n\nWhile there have been some efforts to offload the UK subsidiary, Kleinwort Hambros (KH), which is no longer as central to the business model as previously, voices in Paris say they continue to prioritise the London-based business.\n\n“As a full-service private bank, KH is well positioned to manage the wealth of individuals and their private structures with regards to all of their financial needs,” says the bank. “Our purpose can be summarised in one sentence: to simplify life’s financial challenges.” YB\n\nBest private bank in Mauritius\n\nMCB Private Banking and Wealth Management\n\nThe first Mauritian bank to set up a specialised private banking unit, back in 1999, MCB has continued to drive wealth management developments in the country, growing its assets under management by 24 per cent in the fiscal year 2020/21, despite the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn response to the pandemic, MCB provided moratoriums on loans for capital repayments and interest payments. It also halved management fees for fixed income portfolios for the 2020/21 fiscal year, in order to further cushion its clients, and pushed ahead with its digital transition.\n\n“Locally, we have refined our offerings with a focus on digital to provide customers with easier access to banking products and services but also to offer a more convenient experience,” says Alain Law Min, MCB’s chief executive.\n\n“This has helped us consolidate our leadership status as an innovative universal bank.\n\n“On the international front, leveraging on our investment-grade status, we pursued our cross-border diversification strategies by selectively exploring business avenues in areas where we have built expertise over time, mainly across sub-Saharan Africa,” he adds.\n\nThe bank has also been working on a new savings, investment and financial planning mobile application platform, Juice Wealth, set to be released in beta mode to a small group of employees and customers shortly, providing an end-to-end service platform, from onboarding through to planning and borrowing and up to transactional and investment stages.\n\n“This is in line with the expansion strategy of our private banking and wealth management segment, which is two-fold; firstly aiming at democratising access to investment solutions, and secondly, growing our international client base, notably high net worth individuals in the sub-Saharan African and Mena regions,” says Mr Law Min. KG\n\nBest private bank in Malaysia\n\nCIMB Private Banking\n\nCIMB Private Banking has focused on growing its existing client portfolio - helping clients achieve long-term investment objectives as well as advising them on tactical investments to capture market opportunities.\n\nIn the fast-changing economic environment, CIMB says it is vital to reassess and implement new strategies to adapt and react to the “new” normal and navigate extended periods of market volatility.\n\nThe Malaysian bank has further streamlined its teams of private bankers based on their individual strengths and skill sets, where bankers are carefully selected to service each of the identified client segments.\n\nIt says it has also looked at pairing clients and private bankers to ensure both parties mutually benefit from the relationship, ultimately encouraging long-term relationships.\n\nCIMB is leveraging an experienced team of dedicated investment consultants to complement the role of its private bankers in devising investment plans that match clients’ objectives, risk profiles, investments and business needs. The bank says this is crucial in managing key account relationships, which contribute 75 per cent of its total assets under management, as of December 2021.\n\nNew ways are being sought by the bank to innovate its service approach and ultimately meet clients’ personal and business needs. This involves addressing client needs and safeguarding their wealth, while translating investment insights into actionable investments in client portfolios.\n\nCIMB is also ensuring that investment plans are designed with risk mitigation strategies to minimise risk, especially during volatile market conditions.\n\nWhen the Covid-19 pandemic hit, the bank encouraged its private bankers to increase the frequency of contact with clients via digital channels. It provided regular market updates and recommendations through webinars, virtual meetings, conference calls and emails.\n\nFollowing an initiative to streamline, improve and digitalise as many processes as possible, improvements have been achieved in operational efficiency and better process flows, the bank claims. LH\n\nBest private bank in Mexico; Best private bank in Spain\n\nSantander Private Banking\n\nWith a presence in 11 countries across Europe and Latin America, last year Santander Private Banking in Spain enjoyed healthy net new money inflows of €4.5bn ($4.4bn), which helped increase its client assets by 15 per cent, to more than €126bn.\n\n“We have improved our value proposition and our discretionary portfolio management team has done a fantastic job in this challenging market environment,” boasts Alfonso Castillo, global head of Santander Private Banking.\n\nStrong performance and inflows to the discretionary portfolio management platform were the result of a “timely selection of macro views”, as well as returns generated by the bank’s recommended range of investment solutions.\n\nAs a joint initiative with its asset management arm, the bank has built a global team focused on environmental, social and governance investing, and launched a thematic strategy, Future Wealth, investing in the three megatrends of ‘future society’, ‘future tech’ and ‘future planet’, which gathered €4bn last year.\n\nIt also strengthened its alternatives offering, across private markets, real estate and hedge funds, to provide diversification in client portfolios. Leveraging collaboration across segments and geographies brought new business, consolidating the bank’s position.\n\nIn Mexico, profits rose by 65 per cent in 2021, while client assets also grew by 15 per cent. “Our clients are very satisfied with our services, which translate into more business for our bank. We work extremely hard to keep this virtuous cycle moving in the right direction,” adds Mr Castillo.\n\nHowever, increasing market share, especially in the home country, is getting harder. “When you are the largest player in the market, growth is a challenge,” he acknowledges.\n\nContinuing to grow is particularly hard in a “highly volatile” macroeconomic environment, with persistent inflationary pressures and risk of recession, he adds. “To navigate this challenging landscape, we must invest in digital platforms that will help us reach more clients, faster, and with more customised solutions,” says Mr Castillo. ET\n\nBest private bank in Monaco\n\nUnion Bancaire Privée\n\nUnion Bancaire Privée (UBP) Monaco is one of the group’s fastest-growing branches, in terms of both revenue and assets under management. “Since the bank identified Monaco as a location of strategic importance, it has regularly and consistently invested in this branch, in terms of capital, human resources and IT,” explains CEO of UBP Monaco Sérène El Masri.\n\nEvery year wealthy families of many nationalities relocate to Monaco – the world’s second-smallest country after the Vatican City – not just for its preferential personal tax regime, but also for the high level of security it offers to families, certainty regarding the rule of law and high-quality secondary education, as well as to enjoy the benefits of living in one of the world’s most beautiful regions, says Ms El Masri.\n\nInvestors can place their assets in a jurisdiction that has a solid reputation, while accessing a wide array of financial products and services. Regulatory changes have also made it easier for entrepreneurs to set up companies.\n\nUBP Monaco focuses on high-end clients, many of whom expect structured trading solutions, with leverage where appropriate, and seek exposure to investments in real estate, intellectual property and infrastructure. UBP’s “unique” private markets offering includes “exclusive” investment opportunities, such as government-leased real estate, says Ms El Masri. Its new offering of music royalties was oversubscribed, showing client interest for innovative investments.\n\nClients want support with their acquisition projects, particularly via financing and wealth planning expertise, while the most “mature” families seek help to set up their family business governance arrangements or their family office.\n\nThe biggest challenge for wealth managers is the pace of regulatory change over the past five years, believes Ms El Masri.\n\n“The banks that will stay on top will be those that can turn these changes into competitive advantages, by continuing to hire highly qualified and adaptable people, including from larger financial centres, and investing in the efficiency of their client-driven digital solutions.” ET\n\nBest private bank in the Netherlands\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen\n\nWith a history dating back to 1737, Van Lanschot is the oldest independent financial institution in the Netherlands. Following the acquisition of merchant bank Kempen in 2007, the activities of the Van Lanschot Kempen group expanded and today include institutional investment management and investment banking too.\n\n“For decades, private banking has been our core business and clients appreciate our tailored, personal service and high degree of executive involvement,” says Richard Bruens, member of the management board, and responsible for private and ‘semi-institutional’ clients.\n\nIn 2021, private client assets grew by 37 per cent to more than €58bn ($57.4bn). Organic growth was supported by partnerships and acquisitions in the Benelux region, including the acquisition of a 70 per cent stake in Belgian wealth manager Mercier Vanderlinden.\n\nWith the end goal of moving away “from a product-led approach towards a solutions-led approach”, in its domestic market Van Lanschot Kempen completed its transformation from a universal bank to an integrated wealth manager. The new organisational structure has increased the bank’s efficiency by boosting knowledge sharing, optimising use of resources across the group and improving economies of scale.\n\n“Becoming an ‘integrated wealth manager’ allows us to unlock the full potential of our group, by offering our private clients access to the full range of services and products across our business lines,” explains Mr Bruens.\n\nToday, the bank’s private clients benefit from “the same in-depth research and tailored services as institutional clients”. They can also invest in products previously only available to large, sophisticated investors, such as the Kempen SDG Farmland Fund, which aims to invest in land for sustainable agriculture across the globe, and the recently launched Kempen Private Real Estate Pool.\n\n“As ever, the search for yield and returns is ongoing and requires product innovation as well,” says Mr Bruens. “Private and semi-institutional clients are requesting access to asset classes that were previously the domain of sophisticated investors only, such as private equity, land, infrastructure and private debt.” ET\n\nBest private bank in New Zealand\n\nANZ New Zealand Private Bank\n\nStrict Covid-19 lockdowns remained a feature of national life in New Zealand in 2021, further complicating an already challenging business environment. Despite these difficulties, however, ANZ Private offered its clients an uninterrupted service through a mix of proactive support and digital banking solutions. Thanks to these efforts, and other initiatives, ANZ Private boosted its performance across a number of key growth indicators over the period, along with its client satisfaction scores.\n\nMeanwhile, an emphasis on responsible investing has contributed to a notable organisational change for ANZ Private. “Sustainable investing is an increasingly urgent issue for both ANZ Private and for our clients. One of the ways we’ve recognised this is by appointing a new, dedicated head of responsible investment. This new role strengthens our focus and leadership in this critical area,” says Glenn Stevenson, general manager, ANZ New Zealand Private Bank.\n\nANZ Private has also enhanced its approach to responsible investing, with a particular focus on the accelerating global climate emergency. “We’ve recognised the urgency and wide-reaching impact of climate change through our investment approach which recognises both the material risks of climate change, and the opportunities the transition to a low carbon world presents. We continue to strengthen both our monitoring and stewardship processes to ensure we can act quickly in line with our sustainable investing approach,” says Mr Stevenson.\n\nBeyond its commitment to responsible investing, ANZ Private has deepened its proposition for emerging clients. In particular, the provision of investment advice through in-person appointments with investment advisers is helping to nurture a new generation of long-term customers, while promoting financial wellbeing across a wider segment of the country. JK\n\nBest private bank in Nigeria\n\nStandard Bank Wealth and Investment\n\nOver the past year, Standard Bank Wealth and Investment Nigeria has shown strong resilience, despite the lingering impact of the pandemic and complexities exacerbated by the devaluation of the naira against the US dollar, which has led to an increased appetite for foreign currency denominated instruments and alternative solutions.\n\nThe bank has continued to push forward with future-proofing its organisation, through increased delivery of services and solutions that reach far beyond traditional financial services. In 2021, it also adopted a family-first philosophy, focused on forming lifetime partnerships with its clients and their families and deepening its connections to the next generation of wealth ownership.\n\nAll of this comes at a time when the wealth management sector is growing fast in the country. Nigeria has the third-highest number of wealthy individuals in Africa, with a projected growth of about 38 per cent in high net worth individuals over the next decade.“In the last five years, there was increased participation in the Nigerian wealth management industry as the sector continued to witness traction with the entrance of hybrid fintech wealth management firms,” says Demola Sogunle, CEO of financial services firm Stanbic IBTC Holdings, part of the Standard Bank Group.\n\nIn this regard, the bank’s footprint across 20 African countries, and its long history, has helped it stand out, while offering significant benefits to clients. “The most important benefit for clients within Standard Bank Group is the ability to transact and trade seamlessly within the African regions, as well as enjoy a platform for cross-border regional networking across the continent,” says Mr Sogunle.\n\n“We will continue to seek new market opportunities to serve our customers and deliver personalised solutions through the various touch points along the customer journey,” he adds. KG\n\nBest private bank in Oman\n\nBank Muscat\n\nBank Muscat considers itself the only local bank in Oman offering a complete suite of private banking products and services ranging from investment across asset classes, offshore banking solutions and real estate investment. This offer has helped serve an increase in private wealth across the Gulf Co-operation Council region in the last decade, as local investors have invested increasingly in international markets.\n\nPart of this development can be attributed to the steep correction in oil prices which started in 2014. This saw oil-based businesses decrease their earnings while earnings from non-oil businesses increased, and rather than wealth being invested in illiquid local real estate it went into liquid assets instead, says Bank Muscat.\n\nAs well as more traditional clients, the Sultanate has a young, tech-savvy, population, and to target them Bank Muscat has adopted innovative ways to build its brand and marketing such as utilising social media.\n\nIn this respect, the bank says it understands the relationship between brand equity and key value drivers in the business model, and views brand management as a key element to enhance value for all stakeholders. It says it adopts innovative ways to consistently build its brand and thereby sustain customer loyalty, growth in the business and, ultimately, success and revenue.\n\nAn innovative customer-centric approach can be seen in Bank Muscat’s efforts to develop a strong investment platform through which clients can invest in different asset classes across the globe. This helps to retain clients who want to continue investing through Bank Muscat rather than trying to access different products through different banks, it says.\n\nIn a further development, one impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has been the increased use of internet banking and mobile banking for various transactions. LH\n\nBest private bank in Poland\n\nmBank S.A.\n\nAs a local Polish banking group, mBank has not had significant exposure in other geographical areas, nor planned to expand its private banking operation to other countries.\n\nBut as the first private bank in Poland, it has been in a position to close the gap on well-established peers in western Europe, and in terms of technology surpass them, says Krzysztof Bratos, head of private banking at mBank.\n\nIn 2021, mBank launched a fully digital onboarding process for its private banking and wealth management services. That was not such a surprise, given that self-service capabilities, mobile solutions and hybrid service models have been at the very heart of mBank’s strategy advances in this space over the last few years, says Mr Bratos.\n\n“Payment Services Directive 2 regulations, the pandemic and finally the war [in Ukraine] right next to our border have made digital solutions a foundation of our offering. It is no longer a ‘nice-to-have’ feature,” he says.\n\nGiven that 80 per cent of the private bank’s clients use digital and mobile solutions, Mr Bratos predicts that video meetings will likely outpace traditional office meetings by the end of the year.\n\n“It has simply enabled us to seamlessly offer our services in these uncertain times. In the future, we expect this will be a huge boost to our scalability as well as a significant magnet to the younger generation,” he adds.\n\nmBank’s offering has also benefited from the importance of sustainable and impact investing. “Contrary to some of our competitors, we have decided not to introduce some sustainable investment solutions. Instead, we have embarked on a strategy to gradually convert all our managed solutions to be sustainable,” says Mr Bratos.\n\n“We place sustainability at the absolute core of our future growth. It’s driven not only by expected business benefits, but equally by our responsibility towards the greater good for the world,” he adds. LH\n\nBest private bank in Portugal\n\nBPI\n\nMuch of the positioning of BPI in its native Portuguese market has been around transition to a fee-based business model, along similar lines to that of parent institution CaixaBank, which successfully launched this approach in Spain from 2018.\n\nBPI’s Swiss subsidiary began this approach in 2002, and many of the bank’s clients already have a relationship with the Swiss entity.\n\n“Although 2023 will be a key year for the success of this strategic decision, as BPI will become the first Portuguese private bank to have a fee-based advice model, we are confident we’ll be up for this challenge,” says Antonio Luna Vaz, executive director at Banco BPI.\n\nThis transition, however, has not been as smooth as the bank’s leader hoped. Some delays in implementation of the technical aspects of the Temenos reporting tool means the launch of the fee-based advice model will be held off until January 2023.\n\nTying in with this transition, the beginning of 2022 provided a healthy market for mutual fund sales, even though Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its implications for inflation and monetary policy rapidly changed the environment. As that was called into question, however, clients became more interested in a solution that was, until recently, the key proposition in Iberian markets.\n\n“With rising interest rates, we found an opportunity to sell structured products with guaranteed capital, something that hadn’t been possible for the past few years,” says Mr Vaz, who is also working on bespoke solutions for ultra-high net worth clients investing in private equity and real estate, to be launched in 2023. YB\n\nBest private Bank in Romania\n\nRaiffeisen Bank S.A.\n\nRaiffeisen Bank, which launched in 2012, grew from around 1800 clients in 2020 to approximately 2200 at the end of 2021 and is currently one of the leaders in the industry in Romania in terms of volumes and the frontrunner in terms of setting new trends.\n\nIn 2022, the bank became the first and only Romanian private banking service to offer investment advisory services to its clients. “From the client perspective the main benefit is the curated straight-forward advice that they can get regarding how their portfolio should be built or adjusted, which is especially valuable in these challenging times,” says Adrian-Florin Negru, director of private banking Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen (FWR) Romania.\n\n“Not only do we help them clarify and simplify what can otherwise be an extremely complex decision process that is usually associated with high value portfolios, but we also do this by embedding in the advice a lot of valuable resources – domestic and international research, market and portfolio build-up knowledge – in an easy-to-understand manner for someone outside the industry,” he explains.\n\nIn 2020, the bank launched the first environmental, social and governance (ESG)-like fund in Romania, a locally managed fund of funds that gives customers easy access to the biggest asset managers in ESG around the world.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 33 per cent of the bank’s clients in Romania are now women. “This marks a steady and constant growth across the years, and I would say that this is in line with what we are generally seeing in the Romanian business scene, where we have a sizeable representation of women in top management positions and also in the ownership structure of companies,” says Mr Negru. KG\n\nBest private bank in Saudi Arabia\n\nRiyad Bank\n\nRiyad Bank has continued to provide “top-notch” services to its high net worth clients. The bank now has more than 1900 active private banking clients, with that number growing by 12 per cent in just the first quarter of 2022.\n\nRecently the bank has introduced a 360-degree banking experience concept at its newly established private banking centres, one-stop-shops where clients can conduct banking and investment activities under one roof. It has also expanded its physical operations beyond the major Saudi cities of Riyadh, Jeddah and Al-Khobar and into three other high-growth cities: Al Ahsa, Buraidah and Mecca.\n\nAt the same time, the bank is increasingly realigning its acquisition and retention strategy to include female high net worth individuals and younger generations. “Global wealth demographics have been going through seismic shifts in recent times. The growth in women’s wealth is arguably the most important acquisition strategy we need to focus on, as women are estimated to control around a third of the world’s total private wealth,” a bank spokeperson says.\n\nIn 2020, the bank also established a special unit to serve the royal family and key figures in government. KG\n\nBest private bank in South Africa; Best private bank in Africa for philanthropy services\n\nInvestec\n\nAmong investment themes recently communicated by Investec to its clients is the rise of alternative and private assets.\n\n“With inflation increasing and GDP growth declining, it is becoming increasingly difficult for investors to generate real returns through ‘conventional’ ways of investing,” says Cumesh Moodliar, head of Investec Private Bank in South Africa. “Investors need to look for alternative sources of returns, and to be more flexible in their investment decisions.”\n\nAsset allocations, he believes, will be increasingly shaped by the energy transition of the coming decade. “The shift to net zero emissions will be metals-intensive and we are not seeing the scale of plans for expanding mining production that will allow for this to occur,” he says.\n\nThis is an environment helpful for mining companies over the long run, according to Investec, as well as benefiting commodity-exporting countries.\n\nWhile younger generations are keen to make investments with impact, their parents have preferred traditional philanthropy. What Investec is seeing today among its clients is a coming together of these previously separate disciplines.\n\n“We’re seeing the generational divides closing as more investors engage with and understand the full spectrum of capital, which bridges the gap between traditional investing and philanthropy,” says Mr Moodliar. “This includes responsible investing, sustainable investing, and impact investing; each of which have different expectations of financial return and impact.”\n\nInvestec’s enduring brand, signified by the zebra logo, has been a topic of discussion for some time in the group’s head office in Sandton, the financial district of Johannesburg. The thinking has been about enhancing the brand’s presence in financial hubs including Switzerland, Mauritius and the Channel Islands.\n\n“We intend to unlock the full value of our Swiss banking licence to support the internationalisation of our clients’ wealth and will continue to evaluate opportunities in this space,” says Mr Moodliar. YB\n\nBest private bank in Sweden\n\nSEB\n\nA sense of history is behind SEB’s private banking offer. For more than 165 years, the bank has served as a trusted partner to some of the Nordic region’s most successful entrepreneurs, families and foundations, says Linda Jansdotter Larsson, head of private wealth management, SEB Private Wealth Management & Family Office.\n\nShe says that long history and experience have given SEB a deep understanding of the opportunities, but also the challenges, a significant fortune can entail.\n\n“We have grown to understand the mindset of a professional investor, the challenges [faced by] an entrepreneur, as well as the true meaning of managing private wealth with long-term horizons,” says Ms Larsson.\n\nIts digital corporate university, SEB Campus, together with internal expertise and international business schools and universities, offers employees a wide range of learning content to support them in their ambitions.\n\n“We are using the power of technology to create scalable and global solutions, and are continuously exploring new learning formats. We also believe that learning is happening through everyday experiences and social interactions,” she explains.\n\n“Therefore we, for example, offer mentorship programmes, voluntary work, work shadowing and gigs where employees receive the opportunity to work in another part of the bank for a short period,” says Ms Larsson.\n\nSEB has also implemented environmental, social and governance (ESG) awareness in all client portfolios, to meet customer expectations and contribute to the development of a sustainable society.\n\n“By incorporating sustainability interests and preferences into our advisory offering, we improve the ability for customers to consider sustainable alternatives in line with their preferences,” she adds.\n\nIn 2020, the bank paid a $107m fine for inadequate money laundering procedures in its Baltic subsidiaries. Since then it has prioritised the detection of financial crime. LH\n\nBest private bank in Taiwan\n\nCTBC Bank\n\nCTBC Bank has moved fast in recent years. In 2005, it was the first bank in Taiwan to obtain the wealth management licence and first to launch a family membership scheme in 2013, says John Yang, division head, private wealth management, CTBC Bank.\n\nIn 2018, CTBC launched a new service model for the ultra-high net worth segment, the ‘private privilege’ (for those with more than $5m), providing “comprehensive services”, both financial and non-financial.\n\n“In 2020, we acquired the approval of the wealth management 2.0 licence and in 2022, we are ranked number one in the number of high net worth (HNW) customers and assets under management in Taiwan,” says Mr Yang.\n\nWith travel restrictions forcing most banker-client interaction online during the pandemic, digital banking services and transformation have become key points for HNW customer service satisfaction, says Mr Yang. “During the Covid-19 period, the volatility of the investment market also tested whether the bank’s digital service capabilities can help HNW customers quickly respond to the market, adjust investment portfolio positions, and grasp investment opportunities,” he says.\n\nCTBC Bank will continue to “optimise its digital customer experience journey” to achieve better customer experiences and streamline processes across front- and back-end technologies. For example, CTBC Bank launched “next best offer” in 2022, with artificial intelligence models and big data analytics to empower relationship managers to provide the best decisions for every customer and identify potential HNW customers.\n\nAdditionally, CTBC launched asset allocation engine services (intelligent manager asset platform, iMAP) in 2022, helping relationship managers connect customers’ personal data, investment positions, financial market information, and financial products to instantly construct personalised investment portfolios through relationship managers’ digital devices, says Mr Yang. LH\n\nBest private bank in Thailand\n\nKASIKORNBANK PCL\n\nIt was another strong year for Thailand’s Kasikornbank Private Banking, which saw assets under management continue to grow, along with client numbers.\n\nThe bank introduced structured notes as an alternative investment in the second quarter of 2021, offering the opportunity to gain higher returns amid challenging economic trends in global stockmarkets.\n\n“The main benefit of this kind of investment is to open the opportunity to get better benefits from the current situation,” says Jirawat Supornpaibul, private banking group head of Kasikornbank.\n\nAt the same time, the pandemic increased awareness at the bank of the need to continually communicate with its clients, and in 2021 the bank introduced two new regular programmes on its social media channels.\n\nIt also set up a team of assistant private bankers to support clients in areas like deposits and money market funds, freeing up private bankers to focus on more sophisticated products and client needs.\n\nAmong the bank’s other innovative offerings is its land loan for investment product, which enables clients to request loans for investment using land as a collateral asset.\n\n“The growth of land loans for investment reflects higher trust in our brand,” says Mr Supornpaibul. “With the land loan for investment, clients can then generate benefits from their land while still benefiting from the growth of land prices and keeping the land for heritage.”\n\nIn the last year the bank has continued to focus on sustainability, with one notable effort being the introduction of a long-term investment product, K-Sustain-Ui, which allows clients to profit from the shift towards environmentally friendly businesses while also helping to make a positive global impact. KG\n\nBest private bank in Turkey\n\nAkbank Private Banking\n\nAn increase in clients each year is due to Akbank Private Banking’s strong brand name, people, service and breadth of products, claims Alp Keler, executive vice-president, private banking and wealth management at Turkey’s Akbank.\n\nCollaboration with affiliates AK Investment and AK Asset Management also played a key part in developing the private banking offer. This has made it possible to respond to clients’ changing behaviour and expectations and offer a premium client experience with the products and services of the future with a “human-focused and technology driven business model”, says Mr Keler.\n\nAdditionally, through its ultra-high net worth offering, designed as a family office service, Akbank Private Banking is able to meet clients’ sophisticated financial needs and expectations with a holistic approach featuring innovative tailor-made solutions.\n\n“This serves as a platform to foster multi-generational involvement in investment processes. The aim is to become clients’ and their families long-term strategic trusted partner, taking into account requirements to manage transition of wealth to next generations by providing the continuity of high quality asset management and advisory services,” he adds.\n\nDigital leadership has also been a key means of responding to clients’ changing behaviour and expectations, says Mr Keler.\n\n“Akbank Private Banking offers clients a range of product and solutions that fit various profiles and preferences. Account opening, advisory agreement approvals and initial advisory meetings with clients are mostly made through digital channels, including mobile banking and relationship managers’ iPads,” he explains.\n\n“The investment module in Akbank Mobile enables clients to follow all their investment accounts, including price changes and trends, from a single point. They can also trade quickly as well as accessing many other functions,” adds Mr Keler. LH\n\nBest private bank in the UAE\n\nMashreq Private Bank\n\nAn investor-first approach that aligns customer needs with Mashreq Bank’s value proposition is at the heart of the bank’s ethos. It enables the bank to better understand what products and services its clients require, proactively identify their portfolio gaps, alleviate the challenges they face in their financial planning, and create a curated investment journey.\n\n“The highlight is that such an approach allows us to embed ourselves in the client’s journey and exceed their needs and expectations,” says a spokesperson for the bank.\n\nMashreq Bank says it embarked on its digitalisation journey to address existing challenges and enhance customer experience through thoughtfully chosen conversations and investment solutions. “The aim was to both onboard new customers as well as better service the existing customers by empowering relationship managers with the right set of information about customer risk profile and requirements and correspondingly mapping relevant investment products.\n\n“The key objective was to assess how we could financially empower more clients and estimate customer appetite to invest in different assets, and then map the right products to the right customers. As a result, our customers get the benefit of curated interactions that are effective and designed to meet their specific requirements. From a numbers perspective, these initiatives have led to a 73 per cent higher conversion this year,” says the spokesperson.\n\nMashreq Bank’s offer is also enhanced by a suite of customised solutions as it recognises each investor has a unique risk profile and varied return requirements.\n\n“Their circumstances are unique, as well as their investment time frames. Thus, cookie-cutter solutions are not optimal. Which is why we prefer to focus on creating customised solutions that have been curated specifically to meet the unique needs of our customers,” adds the spokesperson. LH\n\nBest private bank in the US; Best private bank for family offices; Best private bank for innovation\n\nNorthern Trust\n\nNorthern Trust’s wealth management business, until recently, was focused on growing its footprint across its network of regional offices in the US. But that ambition is now becoming global.\n\nThe bank recently hired a regional managing director to focus on its growing client base in Latin America and Canada, following the placement of an executive to lead efforts in Asia and Australia from Singapore.\n\nManagement also points to increasing activity across Europe and the Middle East, where the bank has long had some presence, but previously no serious growth plan, for supporting family office clients.\n\nThere is also a push to provide private banking services to non-US residents in the US. Typically, recent growth in this segment has come from clients from Latin America and the English-speaking Caribbean islands.\n\nThe firm is finding it must also increasingly adjust to the international dimension of American families, who may have been more inward-looking in previous decades.\n\n“Many of our US-based family office clients have some form of international exposure, whether from family members living in various locations throughout the world, or from a desire to have a diversified investment strategy in higher growth markets,” says David Fox, president of global family and private investment office services for Northern Trust.\n\n“Their investment interests range from direct real estate holdings through to alternative assets, which may be more opportunistic in nature. Since family offices are set up to look at investment returns over a longer time horizon to achieve superior growth, their appetite for risk is different than many other investors,” he says.\n\n“Given the growth potential in select international markets, we have found that more family offices have incorporated an international dimension to their portfolios but are being very selective given the current geopolitical uncertainties.”\n\nThe bank’s management acknowledges that while it has been hand-in-glove with many families over several generations, it must increasingly take inspiration from outside of the family office sphere, studying the behaviour of competitors, fintechs, software companies and luxury brands.\n\n“Hubris is the enemy of innovation,” acknowledges Steven Fradkin, president of Northern Trust Wealth Management.\n\n“Learning from the success of other organisations and adapting their ideas to the needs of Northern Trust clients is not a weakness, but rather, a form of smart innovation.” YB\n\nBest branding in private banking (Europe)\n\nLombard Odier\n\nWhen clients and advisers think about the Lombard Odier brand, its partners want this to represent responsible investing in particular, with investments around clean energy at the centre of this offer. According to the bank’s partners, the “environmental transition” has been driving a parallel “economic transformation”, which has now been at the centre of Lombard Odier’s investment convictions for at least a decade.\n\nThe bank’s succession plan, with the senior partner’s reins being handed over from long-standing frontman Patrick Odier to Hubert Keller, also reflect this thinking. While Mr Odier has long espoused the green investment philosophy, Mr Keller is seen as a more recent, although very sincere convert, devoted also to alternative investments.\n\nIt is important to him that his prized bank not only reflects wealth planning and servicing customers, but also the investment engine, which he has spent so many years building and perfecting on the institutional side and leveraging this for private banking.\n\nFor Mr Keller, like Mr Odier before him, it is important that a much smaller investment house such as Lombard Odier be able to give a good account of itself against much larger international competitors.\n\nAlthough the Swiss marketplace no longer enjoys the advantages of friendly taxation and secrecy, he believes firms in Geneva and Zurich can still match all-comers. “In Switzerland, we are very privileged to basically lead the private wealth management industry, the only segment of the financial services industry not dominated by Anglo-Saxon firms, as everything else is,” says Mr Keller.\n\n“The reason we lead is that for decades, if not centuries, Switzerland has been viewed as a safe haven for offshore capital to seek a stable and robust regulatory framework to basically promote international savings.”\n\nThis environment also promotes investment expertise, he believes, in areas such as impact investing and Islamic services. “Lombard Odier has a strong Middle East business and we would like to offer this set of clients an offering fit for their needs,” he says.\n\n“We have an ambitious growth plan for this region. In that context, an Islamic offering will need to accompany the plan.” YB\n\nBest branding in private banking (North America); Best private bank for wealthy women\n\nScotia Wealth Management\n\nScotia Wealth Management’s brand essence is developed around the theme of ‘enriching lives’, based on the recognition that affluence comes in many forms and the bank’s offering must be tailored to the “unique” circumstances of each client.\n\n“It’s more about getting clients to think about what wealth management looks like for them, instead of us telling them what it looks like,” explains Scotiabank’s chief marketing officer Laura Curtis Ferrera.\n\n“Our brand strategy, ‘enriched thinking’, demonstrates that when our clients put their minds together with ours, incredible things are going to happen.”\n\nThe Canadian bank aims to collaborate with clients to create a ‘total wealth plan’, providing a deep and personal understanding of the steps clients need to take to reach their goals.\n\nThe institution leverages technology and social media to raise brand awareness for clients and prospects, as well as give them access to thinking by the bank’s experts. “Familiarity with the brand promise impacts the bank’s net promoter score in a very positive way. When our clients are familiar with the brand promise, they are more likely to recommend us to friends and family,” says Ms Curtis.\n\nThe mission of the ‘Scotiabank women initiative’, recently expanded to the global wealth management division, is to break down barriers to economic and professional opportunities for female clients, at different stages of life, to be successful now and in the future, states Erin Griffiths, senior vice-president, client solutions at Scotia Wealth Management.\n\nSo far, the bank has provided training to more than 900 advisers and other employees in client-facing roles on how they can empower their women clients. It has also hosted more than 2400 women at wealth management sessions to help them transition through major life events, such as retirement, estate planning and care-giving.\n\nA lot of the transfer of wealth in the next few years will be driven by women attaining more senior roles in the workforce, an increase in women-owned businesses and a significant wealth transfer from their male partners, says Ms Griffiths. “We want to help women become more confident in making financial decisions and managing their wealth on their own terms.” ET\n\nBest branding in private banking (Asia); Best private bank in Asia for succession planning\n\nDBS Bank\n\nSince Covid’s emergence and amid rising geopolitical and financial market uncertainty, DBS Bank in Singapore reports seeing clients seeking out safe harbours and placing greater emphasis on long-term and strategic planning. Many have also expressed growing interest to give back to society.\n\n“Furthermore, Covid has helped to accentuate Singapore’s appeal as a prime landing point to access the Asian region’s growing wealth of opportunities,” says Joseph Poon, group head of DBS Private Bank. “Many clients have shared that they were impressed by Singapore’s transparency, flexibility and tenacity in handling the crisis.”\n\nThe belief is that ‘Singapore Inc’ is now a jurisdiction in Asia beginning to resemble Europe’s safe haven of Switzerland, offering a cocktail of attributes including a strong force of law, political and economic stability, and high quality of life. “We see a long runway for Singapore’s wealth landscape moving forward,” confirms Mr Poon.\n\nAs well as its Asian connectivity, Mr Poon emphasises the bank’s digital infrastructure and capabilities, “which allow us to deliver a ‘high tech, smart touch’ approach that enables our clients to take greater control over their wealth, whilst engaging their relationship managers in more strategic conversations”.\n\nInnovative investment solutions, combined with this technology, help empower clients, he believes, citing the establishment of the DBS Digital Exchange in 2020, enabling clients to tap into a fully integrated tokenisation, trading and custody ecosystem for digital assets. In 2021, DBS enhanced this proposition by launching Asia’s first bank-backed trust solution for cryptocurrencies, enabling clients to further integrate crypto-assets into their wealth succession plans.\n\nWhile conversations around death and incapacitation have traditionally been frowned on by Chinese and other Asian families, perceived to be “inauspicious” and bad luck for the family, the Covid-19 pandemic acted as a turning point for these discussions around legacy. For example, the bank is seeing many families place greater urgency on structural, long-term needs such as wealth preservation and governance, which may not have been top-of-mind previously.\n\nIn order to help enhance these services in a highly competitive market, DBS claims it is taking a “calibrated approach” to “strategically onboarding talent”, rather than becoming embroiled in “talent fights”. YB\n\nBest private bank in Asia for customer service\n\nSiam Commercial Bank - Private Banking\n\nCustomer service is increasingly about who has the best digital channels and offerings. Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) Private Banking has constantly put itself on the frontline of developments in this regard, with its strong use of artificial intelligence (AI) to manage and optimise its investment portfolio.\n\nDigital technology has proliferated across the bank and has now been applied to all its private banking customer journeys, with customers able to open all types of SCB accounts via a digital platform, iOnboard, by providing a one-time digital signature.\n\nSCB’s back-end systems are now cloud-based and use quantitative models to meet client demands, while in 2021 the bank focused a lot of its energy on synchronising all of its platforms and operating models, as part of efforts to better serve clients’ needs. The bank’s advisory platform, BarraOne, provides clients with instant advisory.\n\n“Digital technology has played the key role in how customer services are to be delivered,” says Lalitphat Toranavikrai, head of private"
