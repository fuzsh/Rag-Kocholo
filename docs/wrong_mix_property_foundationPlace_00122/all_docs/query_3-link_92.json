        "text": "List of the top banking software to use in 2024\n\nDigitalization is changing the world. It’s especially true in the world of banking, where many companies fight for their customers. Thus, to be successful in financial services, a business has to offer the best banking software, and remain convenient, reliable, safe, compliant, and modern. A few years ago, traditional banks were the kings, so they could afford certain flaws and issues. Today, the situation is entirely different.\n\nMany fresh fintech startups confront traditional businesses. Many consumers prefer fintech apps to banks as they provide superior customer service and support. Modern fintech apps offer AI-powered chatbots, customizable dashboards, personalized financial advice, integration with social media, gamification, robo-advisers, and more. It goes without saying that fintech development has revolutionized the way many financial organizations operate. The same goes for banks. The latter, not to lag behind competitors, put digital transformation first, rethinking the way they operate and provide services. 24/7 customer support, instant payments and transfers, mobile access — all that consumers could ever dream of has been brought to life.\n\nIt’s now possible thanks to top banking software systems. So, how do these solutions work? What are the most famous examples? Which functions and modules are essential for the best banking software? Let’s find out in this guide by banking experts from DICEUS!\n\nAre you searching for a software vendor? Here’s more information about software development for financial services.\n\nBanking software trends\n\nFirst off, we want to start with a brief overview of the modern digital banking universe. To understand how the related software works and how it can help your business, it’s essential to know the recent trends. The majority of top banking software companies take these tendencies into account to provide the most demanded services or products. So, here’s the question.\n\nSo what do you think, what are the trends in the development of banking software for the next few years?\n\nTrend 1. A bigger number of communication channels: Mobile applications, web apps, chatbots, and digital assistants, and much more. By introducing more communication channels, banks can attract more customers, provide personalized offerings, improve cross/up-selling efforts, increase revenue, enhance customer loyalty, and gather customer analytics for data-driven decision-making.\n\nTrend 2. A shift to digital banking software solutions: Buying services and solutions doesn’t require face-to-face communication with bank workers. By shifting to digital banking, banks can become branchless and paper-free organizations offering most products and services online. This shift can significantly reduce labor and operational costs, automate many processes, and enhance customer experience.\n\nTrend 3. Artificial intelligence: Machine learning and cognitive computing will grow banks’ revenue. By implementing AI solutions to detect fraud, for example, banks can reduce financial losses and protect their customers’ accounts and personal data. AI-fueled chatbots can provide instant customer assistance by guiding them through FAQs or offering the right service.\n\nTrend 4. Digital-only banks: No branches, offices, or extra financial software development costs for their maintenance. We mentioned that the shift to digitization can make banks paperless and branchless, resulting in lower operational costs. Additionally, banks can save costs on software development and maintenance as they won’t need as many IT guys as they have with traditional models.\n\nTrend 5. Front-end and back-end modernization: Banking software applications become legacy systems over time. Outdated core systems, old banking programs, apps with unattractive interfaces, and complicated user experiences — all require continuous updates and upgrades. So, banks invest in new technologies to simplify the modernization processes and make them more efficient.\n\nWhy do we expect to see an increase in spending on banking automation solutions? Trends require banks to become more digital to meet all the requirements and expectations of the clients. We can admit that this is not the cost growth but efficient investment in top banking software solutions. Now, let’s look at the basics of our topic and then dive into detail.\n\nGet professional consulting on banking software development and implementation.\n\nWhat does banking software mean?\n\nWhat is banking software for the fintech industry? Shortly, it’s a means of communication between a bank and a user. It serves to improve the workflow inside the company and its branches, for easy investment policies, and to provide the services that solve the users’ needs.\n\nHere are three major requirements for the banking software:\n\nPowerful – no delays, mistakes, or crashes\n\nCross-platform – it can be used on any platform and on any device\n\nSecure – no access to the data by third parties\n\nKey functions of banking software solutions\n\nThere are many types of banking software, but they often share the same set of features. The thing is that many systems are packaged. Vendors sell them to various market players. That’s why the presented functions are generalized to satisfy all customers of top banking software companies, from small fintech startups to multinational corporations.\n\nOn average, the list of features looks as follows:\n\nCustomizable interfaces\n\nData management and history tracking\n\nDocumentation\n\nOnline lending\n\nFinancial instruments, investments\n\nLive customer support\n\nMobile version\n\nOnline deposits\n\nSelf-service options for clients\n\nOnline payments and bills\n\nTransaction processing\n\nUnlike off-the-shelf solutions, custom tools developed by dedicated vendors can include other functions. If you know what financial software is and realize which business goals you can cover with it, a custom development team like DICEUS can build software solutions tailored to your needs specifically.\n\nYou might be interested in learning more about the usage of AI in banking industry.\n\nTop advantages of custom banking software\n\nFinancial institutions choosing custom software development benefit in the following ways:\n\nTailored functionalities. Unlike ready-made software, bespoke financial software for banks is designed and built according to unique requirements and business goals. Usually, a development process starts with a discovery phase, also called business analysis, that allows a development team to discover all the challenges, pain points, and frustrations of users with current solutions, pinpoint the ways to address those and offer the best suitable solution.\n\nNon-functional requirements. Custom software for banking industry is developed considering not only functionalities banks would like to have, but also non-functional requirements such as scalability, flexibility, compliance, operability, and many more. For example, when a bank adds some new services or expands its customer base, scalability should be taken into account to scale up or scale down the capacities.\n\nIntegration with DWH. All software used in banks is interconnected: systems exchange data and information taken from databases or a data warehouse. The latter provide information to core banking systems that, in turn, are integrated with CRM solutions, mobile applications, web portals, loan processing, accounts, transactions, analytics, and others. Custom solutions can be more efficiently integrated within the banking IT infrastructure thanks to DWH.\n\nCompetitive advantage. Providing customers with innovative digital solutions like custom mobile banking applications or AI-powered chatbots can make a difference. Modern users would prefer doing everything they need in a mobile app instead of going to the physical bank branch. Today, consumers value quick inquiry processing time, instant support, user-friendly access to all banking products and services online, clear user journeys, etc.\n\nWant to learn more about tailored banking software applications? Check what we do.\n\nLet’s also check out how banking software works. According to the features listed above, there are a few basic modules that host these features. Depending on the chosen architecture model, these modules can work together or independently, allowing customer banks to turn them on and off. The best online banking software usually centers around several essential modules that cover all the areas of client demand.\n\nCore banking\n\nCorporate banking\n\nCredits and loans\n\nFraud management\n\nInvestments\n\nCRM and marketing activities\n\nOperational intelligence\n\nRegional and local support\n\nRisk management\n\nWealth management\n\nTypes of banking software\n\nIt’s impossible to imagine any retail bank without the best online banking software. Surely, today, banks can offer their services round the clock for all clients in any part of the world. Custom solutions give banks a chance to fully satisfy the needs and requirements of their clients.\n\nThe latest trend in the private banking niche is digital-only banking. Obviously, banks exist in an online world without ground branches. Clients use their mobile devices, watches, or other IoT gadgets. Banks get closer to their clients, and it’s much easier to forecast revenue with e-banking software.\n\nSMS banking software\n\nThere’s no need for the clients to own a smartphone to get the most from SMS banking features. Most banks provide their clients with the opportunity to pay bills, enable or disable some services, and so on. Everything required is a short message.\n\nWhat is banking software for SMS? Usually, it’s a set of three key features:\n\nRecharging. You can replenish your mobile phone account or any prepaid service, order a loan without plastic cards, etc. It’s available round the clock.\n\nPaying postpaid bills. One message is enough to make payments.\n\nAccess to information. A client can request any information about transactions or personal accounts with an SMS.\n\nTop 10 banking software firms offer basic SMS services. However, the development requires a thorough approach to make the final product robust and user-friendly. There shouldn’t be complicated commands or lines for the clients. Simplicity is the key to success here.\n\nLearn more about our engineering services for mobile banking.\n\nMerchant banking software\n\nMerchant banks differ from retail banks as they’re more like investment banks, providing their services to businesses, not individuals. Which software used in the banking sector can satisfy merchant requirements? Overall, it has to offer features for collecting information, processing it, and storing it. It can be a portfolio, information about funds or accounts, history of trades, and so on.\n\nIt’s good to have a software solution that will help banks track transactions and get accurate reports on every portfolio. The user-friendly interface of the software should comprise various charts, analytics, and other blocks of data. Everything should be easy to access and perceive in real-time.\n\nTop banking software should have a high level of security to prevent any data leakage. The work of security solutions shouldn’t make the overall workflow slower or influence it anyhow. Bank employees should have limited access to information depending on their position in the enterprise and the tasks they need to solve.\n\nYou might be interested in learning more about mobile banking risks.\n\nInvestment banking software\n\nThe fintech industry and investment banking niche aren’t overloaded with a large number of software solutions for automating everyday processes. What we have now is a pack of services or cloud solutions that solve very specific tasks. What banks require is the best banking software solution that will comprise improving the workflow inside the company and the quality of services.\n\nMost banks provide complex transactions and deal with huge enterprises where there’s a need to process big blocks of data in no time. Open-source solutions are not a good fit here. The less human work is required, the more revenue an investment bank can gain. Online access to any piece of information that is updated in real-time lets the enterprise show a better market performance.\n\nTop 10 banking software examples\n\nAccording to different estimations, 10 leading financial software companies control almost 50% of the market.

Basically, you purchase a system from Microsoft, Oracle, FIS, SAP, or another team. Further, you may want to invest in customization.\n\nIf we take the US, the average yearly income of a software developer is $100,000. There’s a need to have a team with the project manager and a team to cope with each step of the software development cycle. There are a few disadvantages here:\n\nYou have to pay salaries even if no projects are being developed at the moment\n\nYou have to hire a banking software company, even for a tiny project\n\nBut there’s a second option. It’s outsourcing development. What you have here are top banking software companies that act out as in-house teams with the difference that they are located outside the office.

Here are the major stages in the development lifecycle:\n\nBusiness analysis. All banks seem to have the same tasks and operations, but there’s a need to define what’s required for a specific enterprise. There’s an analysis of what is happening at the moment and what has to be improved.\n\nProject planning. It’s time to define the goals, deadlines, and milestones.
