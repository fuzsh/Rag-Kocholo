Over three hundred gravestones, of which more than two hundred with epitaphs (inscriptions), provide a rich historical data. Tombstones' epigraphs were written in both prose and poetic form, using variants of the Arabic script. In the center of the cemetery are two small stone-built tombstones and around them, in the shade of many tall trees, are scattered the on the green grass snow-white tombstones resting of different shapes and sizes. The idilic picture completes an old water fountain.
