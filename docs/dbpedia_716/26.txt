Alifakovac | Veliki Alifakovac

Both Alifakovac cemetery and the settlement are named after Ali-Fakih, a lawyer and scholar of the 15th century, who is also mentioned as a witness in the vakufna of Isa-beg Ishakovic in 1462, which is considered to be Sarajevo's birth certificate.

Since the 15th century, famous Sarajevo people have been buried in this cemetery, as well as foreigners who would die on their way through Sarajevo. Because of this, the cemetery is often called the Musafir Cemetery (musafiri - foreigners, newcomers).
