        "text": "Alifakovac, Sarajevo, BiH\n\nIt is said that Alifakovac is the most enchanting Ottoman cemetery in the region. Slanted on a hill overlooking Sarajevo, it flickers with hundreds of slender tombstones dating as far back as the 15th century, and hundreds of more erected since then. Also known as the travelers’ cemetery where people with no nearest or dearest in the city were buried, Alifakovac holds many layers of history in its limited space. The older stones seem frivolous, eccentric, and even clumsy in comparison with the new ones, which stand tall, stylized, and orderly. What they all have in common is that they tell a story, through an inscription, an image, or both. Sadly, not all can be told all the time. As old stones sink into the ground, bidding a slow farewell to the city that has accommodated them for so long, they deposit their stories in collective memory. Other stones, distrustful of such a repository, stubbornly persist: they hold on, as if keeping together the past and the present and hoping that, even in a mutilated condition, they won’t be cast to oblivion."
