        "text": "Embark on a culturally-rich tour of Sarajevo and discover the city’s history and heritage, while admiring the\n\nOttoman and Austro-Hungarian influence in its beautiful architecture, landmarks and monuments. We start our tour with a visit to one of the most significant sites in Sarajevo’s history, the spot of the infamous 1914 Sarajevo Assassination that started the First World War. From there we cross the beautiful Miljacka River and walk alongside it, en route to the Emperor’s Mosque and St. Anton’s Church and Convent, near to where Sarajevo was founded. Carrying on, we pass through the beautiful Alifakovac neighbourhood, where we visit the local cemetery to enjoy the panoramic views of the Old Town, the Town Hall, the Trebevic Olympic Mountain, the Jajce Barracks, the Sarajevo Brewery and the ancient fortress remains, among other sites. Crossing back to the other side of the river, we walk to Carsija, the commercial and business part of the city, and stop at Svrzo’s House to get a glimpse into how life was during the Ottoman rule. From there we continue to the Old Orthodox Church and then break for traditional Bosnian coffee at the onlycaravanserai in the Balkans. Next, we visit a mosque named after the most prominent man in the city’s history, Ghazi Husrev Bey, and carry on with a visit to the Jewish Quarter, the Old Jewish Temple and Sarajevo’s Catholic Cathedral. We conclude our walking part of the tour by visiting Markale, the green marketplace, where the two deadliest massacres of the siege of Sarajevo took place. Keeping with the theme, we drive to the outskirts of Sarajevo to visit the Tunnel Museum. On our way there, we’ll learn how the war started, why the beautiful National Library was destroyed and, as we drive along Sniper Alley, we’ll also learn about the human toll, listening to tales of the dark times, yet full of hope. As we arrive at the museum, we’ll pass through 20 meters of the original 800-meter long, 1.6-meter-high tunnel and watch a movie about the war and the importance of the tunnel in it. We then head off to Vrelo Bosne, a beautiful public park, to enjoy the spring of the River Bosna, on the foothills of Mount Igman. There, we can take a stroll along Velika Aleja, a 3.5 km lane, surrounded by thousands of century-old chestnut and plane trees.\n\nOvernight Stay at the hotel in Sarajevo (Breakfast Included)"
