        "text": "4.2/5\n\nVery Good\n\nGGuest UserHotel Berr is just an exceptional hotel in the heart of Old Town Sarajevo! I really enjoyed my stay here. Location couldn't be better - the hotel is a stone's throw from Pigeon Square (maybe 100 metres at most) and about a 10 minute walk to all of the main attractions in Sarajevo - City Hall, the various mosques scattered throughout the city and the main artery of Old Town (the pedestrian area). There are restaurants, shops, money exchange bureaus (watch out for those with high commission!), cafes and souvenir shops as far as the eye can see. There is no lack to choose from. There is also a medium sized supermarket on the corner across from Pigeon Square, open early and stays open quite late. The yellow fortress is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel and the white fortress is approximately 20-30 minutes uphill on foot. Note that the white fortress is closed indefinitely for restoration but the views of the city from the top of the hill is well worth the walk! The hotel owns 3 buildings - the result of expansion and buy up of other hotels over the years. So your room will be in one of the building adjacent to the main reception areas or it will be in the primary building. This was not at all an issue, but just so guests are aware of it! Note also that there is no lift/elevator in any of the buildings and the stairwells are rather narrow. I travel with only a small backpack, so for me, it wasn't even a concern, but for guests with large/heavy luggage or with mobility issues, be aware that you will need to climb the narrow stairs. Some of the rooms are in an almost ”attic” which might be a problem for some guests. The room was spacious and very clean! Although I was in a single room, there were two twin beds in my room. I believe all rooms have the same setup, regardless of how many guests you are staying in the room. The room was equipped with a desk, a small coffee table, two chairs, a large cabinet to store your luggage and a little electric kettle for boiling water (though no tea or coffee were provided in the room, I would nab instant coffee packets from the breakfast buffet to use the next morning). There were two mugs, a glass water bottle and two glasses. There was no air conditioning in the room, but there was a small fan which was sufficient for my needs. There was a flatscreen tv also in the room with approximately 30 channels available. Mostly local channels, however I was able to find about 5 in English. Some rooms have a mini refrigerator, but mine did not. It would have been a nice perk, but I managed without. The bathroom was very large and ample towels were provided (2 hand towels, 2 massive fluffy bath towels and a bath/floor mat). The bathroom had a large dispenser of hand soap as well as a dispenser of ”shampoo” (it was exactly the same as the hand soap), but I used it on my hair and I didn't have any issues with residue. My only (minor) complaint would be the lack of an enclosed shower (only a very thin shower curtain) wh\n\nShow More"
