        "text": "When Riada Asimović Akyol recently wrote in the Atlantic that ‘the istory and practice of Bosnian Islam yields a number of noteworthy lessons for those seeking to cultivate a liberal Islam in Europe’, she identified such a liberal version of Islam with the Bosniak’s acceptance of the modern state during Austro-Hungarian rule, in the administrative centralisation of its institutions, in the prominence of Islamic modernism in Bosnia and in history of secularisation – in short, the Bosniak’s adaptability to modernity and secular contexts is a model to be imitated. This paper aims to question the idea of a ‘progress towards a liberal Islam’ as being too straightforward by providing historical, political and also intellectual context to the practice of Islam in Bosnia and, above all, by analysing the present logic of looking for a particular Islamic identity. I will propose a reflection on what the ‘Bosnian model’ might mean in three steps – defining the Bosnian model; placing it in historical context; and reconstructing the context of t he contemporary Islamic community’s efforts to define the Bosnian Islamic tradition and assessing its results.\n\nThis text aims at to understand what kind of country Bosnia-Herzegovina was in 1992 when the war broke-out, and to what extent the ethnic groups living in it identified themselves with the state and with each other. What did really mean to be a Bosnian? To answer those questions we decided to study the evolution of ethnic relations in Bosnia- Herzegovina and the role played by ethnic elites in different historical contexts from a historic sociological perspective, focusing our attention on: the relationship between ethnic groups and power holders; the impact of that relation in the ethnic groups relations; the development of group identity and its forms of expression; and on the evolution of the Muslim question, since the emergence during the Ottoman period of a Muslim community endowed with a separate and particular group identity.\n\nISLAM AS A EUROPEAN RELIGION: SOME VIEWS ON ISLAM IN THE TERRITORY OF THE EX-YUGOSLAVIA - THE CASES OF SLOVENIA AND BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA The paper wishes to present the exmnpfe of two repub/ics from the exYugosla via: Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that claimed independence in 1991, a11d to draw atte11tio11 to some of the stereotypes about !slam a11d Muslims, natio11al mythologies and racism tliat have served as toots i11 the hands of politicians and culminated in the f orm of war in Bos11ia and Herzegovina. Stereotypical conceptions about Islam and Musfim s stiff mark the attitude of S fo venia 's inhabitants towards the Muslims who live in Slo venia as Slo venian citizens. ln the article I will expose some consequences of this stereotypical perception of the \"oth er\" and \"d(f!erent \".
