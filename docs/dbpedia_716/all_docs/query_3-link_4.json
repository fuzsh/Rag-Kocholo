It is named after Ali-Fakihu of Sarajevo, a lawyer and scholar of the second half of the 15th century, who was listed as a witness at the Gazi Isa Bey's 1462 Charter. The central street in Alifakovac is called the Great Alifakovac Street (<i>shown in the above photograph</i>). It begins by the Seher-Cehaja 's bridge end of the old City Hall ('Vijecnica') and it runs up the hill. Alifatkovac is the second oldest section of the Bosnian capital (dating to the mid XVth century); the oldest one is called Vratnik. Alifakovac is located on the east side of Sarajevo, on the hilly parts oppositte of Vratnik and accross the Miljacka River.\n\t\n\tThere is a large and one of the most beautiful Sarajevo's Muslim cemeteries in Alifakovac, the XVth century Alifakovac cemetery.  Over three hundred gravestones, of which more than two hundred with epitaphs (inscriptions), provide a rich historical data. Tombstones'  epigraphs were written in both prose and poetic form, using variants of the Arabic script. In the center of the cemetery are two small stone-built tombstones and around them, in the shade of many tall trees, are scattered the on the green grass snow-white tombstones resting  of different shapes and sizes. The idilic picture completes an old water fountain. \n\t\n\t<a href=\"http://bs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alifakovac\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">bs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alifakovac</a> [Edited by FSSc]</b>",
