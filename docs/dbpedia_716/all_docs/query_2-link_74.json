        "text": "The story of Sarajevo dates way back. Ever since the Stone Age, people have inhabited this area. During the Roman rule, the Sarajevo valley was a part of the province of Dalmatia. At the time, both Romans and Illyrian tribes inhabited the valley. In the 7th century, first Slavic tribes have come to Bosnia and settled in this area. Slavs have converted to Christianity and started building churches. But the city of Sarajevo, as we know it today, was only founded in the 15th century, when the Ottoman rule began.\n\nThe Ottoman era lasted for more than 400 years. During that time, the city grew and became one of the most advanced cities in Europe. Sarajevo reached its peak in the 16th century. It was the biggest and most important Ottoman city in the Balkans, second after Istanbul. During the Ottoman era, many Christians that lived in the area converted to Islam. In the meantime, new Christian population appeared in the city, as well as the Orthodox. In the 16th century the Jews came, and thus has Sarajevo become the city of four religions. And it has preserved that identity to this day.\n\nIn 1878 the Austro-Hungarian Empire has taken the city of Sarajevo. The short period of Austro-Hungarian rule left a significant mark on the city. It was a period of westernization and architectural expansion. Many important buildings were built, and the tramway was introduced. The city expanded outside its historical borders, for the first time. The city’s development stopped in 1914 when the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand took place in Sarajevo. This event soon led to World War I, which brought the end to the Austria-Hungary. After the WWI, Sarajevo became part of Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the government changed. Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Sarajevo became the capital of the Republic of Bosnia, one of the Yugoslav republics. During this period, Sarajevo developed into one of the main Balkan cities. It had a strong industry and a growing population. The peak of city’s growth was the year 1984 when Sarajevo hosted the Winter Olympics. During the 1990’s war, Sarajevo was severely damaged. The long siege of Sarajevo ended in 1996. Only then Bosnia and Herzegovina finally became an independent country.\n\nBaščaršija\n\nFounded by the Ottomans in the 15th century, Sarajevo had all the characteristics of the Ottoman city. The city was divided into two zones. The central part was called čaršija – a commercial center, a zone where all the economic activities are carried out and where all the craft shops were located. It also included a mosque, sebil (water fountain), hamam (public bath), and other important buildings. The residential neighborhoods were called mahalas and they surrounded čaršija.\n\nThe main čaršija was called Baščaršija. Today, Sarajevo’s Baščaršija is the historical and cultural center of the city, located in the heart of the Old Town. Baščaršija lies on the northern bank of the Miljacka river. It’s a square from which narrow streets full of shops spread. Baščaršija is the major tourist attraction of Sarajevo. It houses the iconic Sebilj fountain, which can be seen on nearly every Sarajevo’s postcard. The square itself still has the same form and role it used to have centuries ago. It is also called the “Pigeon Square”, because of all the pigeons that spend their time here.\n\nSarajevo mosques\n\nDuring the Ottoman rule, the city of Sarajevo has had over 100 mosques. Their number has decreased until this day, but there are several mosques that still attract both believers and tourists from all over the world. The oldest mosque in Sarajevo is the Emperor’s Mosque, built before the city itself was founded. Destroyed in the late 16th century, the mosque was rebuilt and made even bigger and more decorated. Side rooms were added near the end of the Ottoman period, in the 19th century, and thus the mosque has remained until today.\n\nThe other significant mosque is located in the heart of the Old Town, near the Baščaršija. It is the Gazi Husrev Beg Mosque, built by Gazi Husrev Beg itself in the 16th century. It is the largest and most representative historical mosque in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the Balkans. It is a complexed object which included a maktab (Islamic primary school), a madrasa (Islamic secondary school), a bezistan (marketplace), and a hammam (public bath). The mosque has only one minaret, but Gazi Husrev Beg decided to build a clock tower next to it. Sarajevo’s Clock Tower (Sahat kula) is a rare example of a clock that shows lunar time. It means that the clock strikes midnight at the moment of sunset. There is a man who climbs the tower once a week to set the clock’s time manually, so that clock would always indicate the right time for prayer.\n\nThe city of four religions\n\nSarajevo’s Old Town includes various sacred objects. The majority are mosques, but there are also several churches and synagogues. One of the oldest sacred buildings in Sarajevo is the Old Orthodox Church. It was built in the 16th century when the Orthodox community inhabited Sarajevo. Due to the damage it suffered throughout the centuries, the church had to be rebuilt, but it kept its authentic appearance. Today it houses a museum with an enviable collection of icons and other historical items. Not far from the old church stands the Orthodox cathedral built in the 19th century. Today it is the biggest Orthodox Church in Sarajevo.\n\nJust around the corner stands the Sacred Heart Cathedral, the main Catholic church in Sarajevo. The cathedral was built in 1889, during the Austro-Hungarian period. In 1997, after the war had ended, Pope John Paul II visited Sarajevo. Catholics of Sarajevo decided to honor that moment and have put a statue of the Pope in front of the cathedral.\n\nThe Jewish community was also present in the city since the Ottoman period. They have built the Old Synagogue in the 16th century and used it as a house of worship until World War II. At the beginning of Austro-Hungarian rule, many Jews arrived at Sarajevo. It was when the Ashkenazi Synagogue was built on the bank of the river Miljacka. During the WWII Jewish community of Sarajevo suffered great losses and hasn’t recovered ever since. Today, the Ashkenazi Synagogue remains the only active temple in the city, while the Old Synagogue serves as a Jewish museum.\n\nVisit Sarajevo museums\n\nThe history of Bosnia and Herzegovina is interesting in every way. Because of the Ottoman influence, it differs from that of the neighboring countries. Visit one of the city’s museums and find out more about Sarajevo and Bosnia.\n\nThe Historical Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina covers the country’s entire history, from ancient times to the present day. But there are many more museums that specialize in a specific period of history. If you are interested in Ottoman culture, visit the Brusa Bezistan or Svrzo’s House. Both institutions hold valuable artifacts from the Ottoman period and show what life was like for the people of Sarajevo.\n\nSarajevo Museum 1878–1918 represents the period of the Austro-Hungarian rule in the city. It gives a special focus on the 1914 assassination. The following period is covered in the City Hall Museum, representing the last century of Sarajevo’s history. The more recent history is represented in several museums and institutions. These are the Museum of Crimes Against Humanity and Genocide 1992 – 1995, War Childhood Museum, and the Tunnel of Hope. All three cover the events of the 1990’s war and the siege of Sarajevo.\n\nAnother interesting place to visit is the Sarajevo Brewery Museum. It is the only European brewery with continuous production since the Ottoman Empire. As such, it offers a different perspective of major events in the city.\n\nTaste Bosnian coffee\n\nWalking around Baščaršija, you will notice that there are many cafés located in the city’s center. Bosnian people love to take a good coffee and it is said that theirs is the best coffee in the region. Bosnians have a specific way of making coffee, but what is more intriguing is the way they drink it.\n\nCoffee is always served on a copper tray in džezva (coffee pot) and fildžan (cup). It is also mandatory to serve sugar cubes, a glass of water, and Rahat Lokum (a.k.a. Turkish Delight). First, you take a sugar cube, dip it in coffee, take a bite, and finally take a sip of coffee itself. This way you will get the most of its rich flavor. Next, you can take a bite of Rahat Lokum. But remember to wash away its flavor with water before taking another sip of coffee.\n\nBosnian cuisine is very popular in the entire region. The traditional Bosnian cuisine is a blend of Turkish and Balkan influences. This results in a variety of interesting and tasty meals. Some of the specialties have spread across all the region, such as ćevapi (grilled dish of minced meat). But you will still find the best ones in Bosnia. There are many restaurants located on Baščaršija square that offer cheap but delicious ćevapi. Traditionally, ćevapi come with somun (a specific type of bread) and chopped onions. Another national dish you can try is dolma, a vegetable stuffed with either meat or rice. A similar dish is japrak, minced meat wrapped in leaves.\n\nIf you want to grab something on the way, go with burek. It’s a meat-filled pastry, rolled in a spiral, usually served with yogurt. The meat can be replaced with cheese, potato, or cabbage. This might not be typical street food, but it sure pays off to try it. If you prefer sweets, try baklava – sweet pastry filled with chopped nuts, topped with syrup.\n\nThere is a restaurant near the Miljacka river called Inat Kuća (“Spite House”) that offers all that and much more! The restaurant is centrally located, right across the City Hall. It only serves traditional Bosnian dishes. And while you eat, you’ll have a chance to listen to authentic Bosnian music – Sevdah. Apart from being a great place to eat, Inat kuća had a big role in Sarajevo’s history! Book a table and find out more about this unique place!"
