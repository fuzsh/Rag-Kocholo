        "text": "Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina gives a glimpse of the past life in the Ottoman Empire. The streets of the trade quarter, Bascarsija are teeming with shops selling crafts of all sorts, and cafes serving dark, strong Turkish coffee. Only a closer look at old buildings will reveal walls pierced with shrapnels and bullets all over like a Swiss cheese. This is a dark hint to the recent past. 25 years ago this city endured the longest ever city siege in the modern history. It was perpetrated in 1992-1995 by Orthodox Serb military in response to Bosnian’s (majority Muslims) decision to separate from Yugoslavia.\n\nA quarter of the century is a relatively short time to heal wounds and scars of the war and the reconciliation process hasn’t even started. In the years following atrocities of the war, Bosnian population saw a steady grow of its Muslim population. Revival and increased interest in Islam was seen by many Bosniaks as a way to find consolation and meaning in this challenging peace agreement. Alongside this process, the mystical part of Islam, Sufism, also played an important role for many Bosniaks (Muslim Bosnians) in reconciling the tragic past[1].\n\nI arrive to Sarajevo just before the Islamic holy month of fasting and reflection, Ramazan (Bosnian pronunciation of Ramadhan). There is no better time to explore the role of mystical Sufism in the lives of Bosnia’s Muslims.\n\nLove, pray and recite\n\nAmira is an Islamic teacher in the High Economic School of Sarajevo and is often referred to as Mualima (the teacher, the wise woman) by her students. She willingly explains to me some aspects of Sufism:\n\n-Most of Muslims are only following rituals of Islam such as prayer, fasting and charity. But there is so much more of spirituality in Islam that could be beneficial for the society! It’s about connecting with the divine element on a more personal, emotive level.\n\nSufism emphasises the importance of kindness towards all living beings, discipline, love and change from within. On an individual level, closer connection with God (Allah) can be achieved through different means, for instance through reciting zikr (dhikr): a rhythmic repetition of the attributes of God. Such ceremonies of zikr are often organised in tekijas, religious schools, and can be open for males, females, or mixed communities. The ceremony is led by a sheikh, a learned Sufi who helps other participants to reach closeness with God through the practices.\n\nThe sound of soul\n\nIt’s the third week of Ramazan, just over one hour before the sunset. The doors of recently constructed tekija[2] at Kovaci district of Sarajevo’s old town are opening. A lively, blonde lady Amela welcomes the guests. Soon the ney (traditional Ottoman reed flute) concert will start.\n\nThose lucky guests are most likely family and friends of the performers – this is a closed and very intimate event. In a few minutes everyone is seated on the sofas in the main room and the Sufis start to play on their reed flutes. The sound of neys and the beat of tambourine are entrancing, otherworldly, with a touch of longing for the unseen, better reality.\n\nIt is not difficult to understand why ney is considered so special in Sufism. It is also closely associated with the most prominent mystical poet of Islam, Mawlana Jalaluddin Rumi[3].\n\nAmela explains: –Ney is the instrument of soul. It is very difficult to play, one really needs to give oneself to make a good sound on it. Only a pure soul can play it.\n\nAnd then, as if to test my intentions, she challenges me to try playing on her ney. I take the flute in my hands and blow into it with uncertainty. A squeaky sound with some meager potential of music comes out of it. One of the musicians nods with respect and says that it took her one month only to learn how to blow this thing.\n\nThe ney musicians meet regularly at the tekija and play various ilahijes (religious songs) but also perform concerts in other cities. To them, playing ney is not just a joy but a way to heal soul and reach for the unity with God that all Sufis strive for. This is a way to express love, gratitude and patience but also to heal the wounds of one’s soul.\n\nEach person has a story to tell. For many, the practices such as zikr and music are ways to reconcile scarred memories of the dramatic past.\n\nEverything in moderation\n\nPeace in ethnically diverse country such as Bosnia and Herzegovina is a delicate art that needs to respond to its citizens feeling of equity, economic needs and sense of social cohesion. Economic growth and institutional improvements are still under progress for this young state and the double digit unemployment rates are a challenge yet to be tackled.\n\nYet, moderate approach towards Islam[4] and other religions, secularism and inter-cultural co-habitation are some of the important features that help the Bosnians to look hopefully in the future. In this backdrop, the Sufi’s emphasis on individual improvement that benefits the self, the community and the world is all-the more important.\n\n[1] https://www.themaydan.com/2018/01/education-heart-revival-sufism-bosnia-herzegovina/\n\n[2] https://balkaninsight.com/2013/04/08/bosnia-s-dervishes-in-a-spin-over-rebuilt-tekke/\n\n[3] https://www.dailysabah.com/feature/2014/03/13/instrument-of-the-human-soul-absolute"
