        "text": "Sarajevo is a compact and essentially linear city, stretched along the banks of the river, slowly creeping up the hills on either side, laughing at the concept of planning permission. Sarajevo is also packed with cultural and historical sites for you to see. You can walk without too much exertion (save perhaps in the heights of a hot summer) and take in sites from as far back as the Ottoman Empire.\n\nYou should start at one end of the city, and meander your way along with the river (which is actually very straight as it runs through the city). You can immerse yourself at street level, up close with history, and then head up higher into the hills to get an almost birds eye view of everything.\n\nAs always, this list in non-exhaustive and you should do a little bit of reading around the places that interest you. Where relevant there are links for more information.\n\nWalking Tours\n\nThere are many different walking tours you can do in Sarajevo. There are some general ones and other more specific ones.\n\nFor example there is a Sarajevo graffiti walking tour and there is a siege of Sarajevo walking tour.\n\nFind one you like and book. It is always great to have someone local describe their city to you.\n\nWalking Tour Details\n\nYou can just google it, but these are good websites if you are unsure:\n\nhttps://www.sarajevowalkingtours.com/\n\nhttps://meetbosnia.com/tour/free-walking-tour-sarajevo/\n\nhttps://www.freetour.com/sarajevo\n\nSome are free, though you should tip. Others state a price for the tour\n\nBaÅ¡ÄarÅ¡ija\n\nThis is possibly the main attraction of Sarajevo. BaÅ¡ÄarÅ¡ija is the old bazaar, built in the 15th century, and is described as the historical and cultural centre of the city. BaÅ¡ÄarÅ¡ija is an absolute must and is home to a number of sites, cafes, ÄevapÄiÄi and aÅ¡Äinica restaurants, and handicraft shops, such as on KazandÅ¾iluk Street, that you will want to visit.\n\nThe vibe and the architecture in this part of town are enough to warrant a visit. Youâll also get to see the Sebilj Fountain, the Gazi Husrev-beg mosque, MoriÄa Han, the old Orthodox Church, the old clock tower, the old town hall (VijeÄnica) and more. Just go there and walk around.\n\nBaÅ¡ÄarÅ¡ija Details\n\nType: Ottoman neighbourhood / commerical centre\n\nWalk around, feel the past, eat some food, have coffee\n\nCost: free (except food, coffee, and shopping)\n\nSites include Sebilj fountain, Gazi Husrev-beg mosque, KazandÅ¾iluk Street, and more\n\nAddress: BaÅ¡ÄarÅ¡ija\n\nFerhadija Walkway & Eternal Flame\n\nExiting BaÅ¡ÄarÅ¡ija to the west will land you in Ferhadija street, a pedestrianised part of town with many shops and restaurants.\n\nYouâll also find the Sacred Heart Cathedral and the eternal flame (VjeÄna Vatra), and âthe iconic lineâ which separates east and west, or rather, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman influence. You canât miss the transition in the architecture.\n\nFerhadija Walkway Details\n\nType: pedestrianised street / walkway\n\nFamous East meets West line and the eternal flame can be found here\n\nStroll along the street, admire the architecture, watch the people in the street\n\nCost: free\n\nAddress: Ferhadija\n\nThe White Fortress and Yellow Bastion\n\nNow that youâve been down and in and around the city, itâs time to get up and above it. On the hills to the east of BaÅ¡ÄarÅ¡ija, overlooking the city are the white fortress and the yellow bastion.\n\nBoth of these locations provide splendid views over the city. The former is an old fort, situated 667m above sea level, possibly constructed in 1550, and later reconstructed. The view is more impressive than the fortress.\n\nThe latter, the yellow bastion, completed in 1739, is not quite as high, but the view is no less impressive. It is also from here that the start of Iftar is marked during Ramadan by the firing of a cannon.\n\nThe White Fortress and Yellow Bastion Details\n\nType: old fortifications which serve as view points\n\nCost: free\n\nStroll up to these vantage points and look over the entire city\n\nAddress: PoddÅ¾ebhana 15\n\nMt. TrebeviÄ & More\n\nIf the white fortress wasnât high enough for you, you can venture up onto Mt. TrebeviÄ using the newly renovated cable car.\n\nThe cable car takes you straight from the city into the mountains. It was first built in 1959, but it fell into disrepair before being destroyed in the Bosnian war. It was reopened in 2018.\n\nOnce there, you can hike to the peak (1627m), stop at some mountain huts from mountain tea (or at a swanky mountain hotel), enjoy a spectacular view of the city (assuming no fog or smog), and visit the old olympic bobsled track. Be careful as some landmines remain on the mountain, though they should be marked.\n\nMt. TrebeviÄ & More Details\n\nType: cityside mountain with cable car access and abandonned olympic bobsled track\n\nPrice: 20 KM return ticket on the cable car / Children under 7 go free. You can also take a taxi, or simply walk the whole way from the city.\n\nCable car runs from 09:00 - 17:00\n\nCable Car Facebook\n\nWebsite about hiking on Mt. TrebeviÄ\n\nRead more about hiking in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nThe Latin Bridge\n\nKnown as the Latin Bridge, Latinska Äuprija, and Principov most, this Ottoman bridge bore witness to the assasination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in 1914 - the act that is said to have triggered WW1. The view from the centre of the bridge looking down the river in either direction is also nice.\n\nThe Latin Bridge Details\n\nType: historic bridge which bore witness to the alleged trigger of WW1\n\nPrice: free\n\nOpen: always\n\nAddress: Obala Kulina Bana\n\nOthers to think about\n\nVijeÄnica / Town Hall\n\nThe Sarajevo City Hall, or Gradska vijeÄnica, was designed in 1891 with a pseudo-Moorish design. Itâs worth passing across the river to take a look at this impressive building from afar. There's also a museum inside; not to mention, it is beautiful inside.\n\nSarajevo Roses\n\nAll over the city, on the pavement, you will encounter Sarajevo Roses. The scars left in the streets by shelling during the siege have been filled by red resin and provide a reminder. Read more about Sarajevo roses here\n\nAlifakovac\n\nAlifakovac is a neighbourhood in Sarajevo that is believed to be one of the oldest urban settlements in Sarajevo. It is located on a hill with an impressive cemetery on top. At the foot of the hill are Inat kuÄa and the Alifakovac bakery, both of which you should visit when you feel like eating.\n\nKozja Äuprija\n\nIf you like old bridges and you like walking, you should also visit kozja cuprija, or the âGoatâs Bridgeâ, built in the 16th century. Itâs a 30 minute walk out of Sarajevo to the east, along the beautiful Dariva walkway by the river."
