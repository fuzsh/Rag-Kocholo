In Alifakovac neighborhood above the Šeher-cehaja bridge, there is a large and one of the most beautiful old cemeteries in Sarajevo due to its location. In the center of the cemetery, at its most prominent point, there are two smaller stone open turbets on pillars, and around them are scattered snow-white niches of different shapes and sizes, scattered on the green grass overgrown with tall trees. An old fountain completes the picture of the environment.

But the significance of the necropolis on Alifakovac lies not only in that; it is perhaps more significant from the point of view of history. Over three hundred tombstones, of which more than two hundred with epitaphs (inscriptions), provide us with interesting information about the past of the town on Miljacka and represent a real archive in stone. Today, we are able to supplement our earlier knowledge about the time of this necropolis with the latest findings. Namely, during the arrangement of the cemetery, a tombstone was found in the ground, a niche in the shape of a larger stele, on one side of which is carved a hand bent at the elbow, with six outstretched fingers above which is the moon, which the hand seems to want to reach.

On one narrow side is a sword with hemispheres. Next to this sight is another one, and it has zigzag lines on the bevel. These are the elements that tell us that the cemetery at Alifakovac was created as early as the 15th century. Nišans with inscriptions in poetry or prose, executed in various variants of the Arabic script, provide a wealth of information about a large number of learned persons, poets, benefactors and tradesmen of old Sarajevo. Alifakovac cemetery is also known as Musafirsko cemetery, where foreigners who would have died in Sarajevo were buried.
