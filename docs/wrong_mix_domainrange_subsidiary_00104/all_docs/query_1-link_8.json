Through a continual dedication to innovation and a passion for cooking, RATIONAL continues to expand and grow as a company year after year. In the USA, we currently have an install base of over 35,000 units coast to coast, over $100,000,000 in sales, and have the largest sales force compared to any other combi manufacturer.\n\nRATIONAL USA has had an established presence in the United States for over 30 years with a subsidiary office and distribution center in the Chicagoland area. Our team is comprised of 26 regional sales managers, 5 corporate chefs, consultant manager, key accounts team, 20 representative manufactures, 10 CustomerCare managers, 8 regional technical managers, and over 100 active RATIONAL certified chefs. We continue to expand our US team in order to provide best in class service that our customers deserve and need through the life of their equipment.\n\nWe concentrate on providing maximum customer benefit to those working in commercial kitchens. As a result, we are there for our customers and partners every step of the way. Providing customer support before, during, and after the sale is our focus. Our CustomerCarePlus experience is unique in the fact that it outlines everything that we offer as a company for our customers exclusively. This includes everything from purchasing, to installation, trainings, and an internal Technical Call Center during business hours, while a 3rd party company handles phone calls after hours and weekends, and much more."
