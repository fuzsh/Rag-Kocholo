        "text": "posted 21 November 2004 08:50 AM profile\n\nquote:I love traditional C&W as well as anyone, but if you live in Tx and you aren't playing some of these guy's material, your crowd is dwindling.\n\nI agree. This is the music of the young Texas music fan, much more than traditional country. Johnny Bush plays occasional concerts with Pat Green, Cross Canadian Ragweed, and others. He's usually second artist on the bill and is treated with honor and respect by the headliners and the crowd as a TX music icon, which he should be.\n\nWe do tailor the show material to the up-tempo numbers, and Johnny's hits medleys (e.g. Green Snakes, Whiskey River, What A Way To Live). Additionally, we'll do \"Uno Mas Cerveza,\" \"Leave My Momma Out of This,\" \"How Can I Kiss The Lips At Night,\" and other tunes that a backwards-ballcap kid might relate to.\n\nThis strategy is called \"keeping contemporary and keeping your career going.\" At on time Johnny resisted this and felt antagonistic about the success of the New TX guys for awhile, But when he got to know some of these boys and realized how much they idolized him personally,... and yes, saw their crowds,... he got on the bandwagon.\n\nJohn's new album, Honky Tonic, has duets with Cooder Graw, Kevin Fowler, Willie Nelson, Stephanie Urbina Jones, and Tommy Alverson. It's been getting great reviews, airplay (?!?!), and is the best received Bush album in a long time.\n\nWhen the crowd is milling around the front of the bandstand, and beautiful babes... and I mean good-looking babes... are chanting \"Johnny F...in' Bush, Johnny F...in' Bush\" when we're coming onstage...well, there's a certain, um, enjoyment in that.

I don't own any Pat Green records, but I can listen to a full show, and personally he's a pretty darn neat guy to have a beer with. And his music is a lot less country than Garth Brooks, whom I also thought was pretty darn good and certainly not the Great Satan so many guys around these parts (i.e. Forumland) seem to think he is.\n\nBoth Pat and Garth know what the people want, they know how to get the goods to the people, their product is good, and they have been and are being rewarded for it.\n\nMy good friend and long-time colleague Justin Trevino vehemently disagrees with me, as is his right. He hates the new sh!t, doesn't want to even be on the shows. We both play very traditional country music, but I'm willing to play \"outside the rules\" if called for. Justin admits that his purism will cost him professionally, and is comfortable with that. Blessed are the believers.\n\n------------------\n\nHerb's Steel Guitar Pages\n\nTexas Steel Guitar Association\n\nposted 22 November 2004 10:39 AM profile I'm really hesitant to post on these types of threads anymore as I have gotten a little riled up before and said some things I shouldn't have and very much regret. I guess I'm a little too thin skinned.\n\nAnyway, I can certainly understand both sides of the fence as I've been on both of them. There are all kinds of music getting mixed together these days. I recently read about this years Shiner \"Bocktoberfest\" down in Texas where Asleep At The Wheel, Cory Morrow and Lyle Lovett were on the same bill with acts like Stained (I have never even heard of them but understand they are a metal band)and Kid Rock. But Texas has always mixed things up. Texas has always been a world of it's own but the mix it up trend seems is speading way beyond there.\n\nI am not surprised at Herb Steiner's willingness to play outside the box so to speak. After all, he was at the forefront during the early 70's when rednecks, hippie's, honky tonkers and rockers together all spawned the \"progressive country\" movement which ended up becoming \"mainstream\" in a big way with the eventual release of \"Wanted, The Outlaws\" album by Waylon, Willie and the bunch. I believe that album still holds some kind of record for sales by a \"country\" album to this day and it was quite controversial in it's time.\n\nThe \"Garth era,\" or the Country Music Boom of the mid 90's, has been gone now for almost 10 years. I think a lot of the young listeners today are not even the people that were into Garth. They're a new generation and were not even teenagers when Garth or any of the other artist of that time hit. They were too young then and don't even know anything about that time period. They instead grew up to something else. What, I'm not sure but it obviously is affecting the stuff that's getting put out today. As a professional musician, I think if you want to work, continue to pay your mortgage and such, you need to be able to bend a little, try to have an open mind and stay up on the current trends. You don't have to like them necessarily but at least try to appreciate them if you can and try to understand where the fans are coming from who do. I know we have all played jobs where we had to bite our toungue and play stuff we don't like.\n\nI have nothing but respect for someone who feels strongly enough to NOT play a certain style of music because they don't like it or have some other reason not to play it. Unfortunately, it seems that many with such strong opinions are very quick to jump on those who don't see it like they do. And I understand that.\n\nI've been involved in all kinds of music. Country and otherwise and had the good fortune of playing all styles from Honky Tonk, Western Swing with some of the original Playboys (some of whom are gone now) to \"Texas\" artists like Jimmie Dale Gilmore and Butch Hancock to Nashville mainstream acts. I think there should be room for all of it.\n\nJP\n\n[This message was edited by James Pennebaker on 22 November 2004 at 10:45 AM.]\n\n[This message was edited by James Pennebaker on 22 November 2004 at 10:57 AM.]"
