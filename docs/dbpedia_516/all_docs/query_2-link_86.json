        "text": "Pat Green/Cory Morrow The Songs We Wish Wed Written Tour Lubbock, TX/November 30, 2000\n\nThey say everything is bigger and better in Texas and this once again proved to be true Thursday night at Liquid 2000 in Lubbock. The combined bill of perhaps the two brightest stars of Texas Music, Cory Morrow and Pat Green would be enough to make any Texas fans mouths water, but it only got better as the night grew longer.\n\nMy friends David, Woodrow (his names really not Woodrow we just like to call him that, it must be a Texas thing), Cade, and I arrived at the club around 8:30 since the show was scheduled to begin with up and coming star Cory Morrow promptly at 9:00 p.m. We waited, and waited as the floor began to fill up but we were determined to keep our front row positions. So 9:00 rolled around and no sign of Cory, however, there was a sweet old dude that looked homeless walking around on the stage and he fell over once and I got a picture of him but thats beside the point. The minutes came and went, helping to pass the time was a CD playing over the PA that everyone happily sang along to, the highlight being country bad boy David Alan Coes classic You Dont Ever Call Me By My Name, a sing-a-long favorite. So 10:30 rolled around and after two hours of standing in my spot Mr. Morrow hit the stage, and man did he hit it! I was a Cory Morrow virgin until this night, only having heard about four of his songs prior to the show, and now Im hooked. Probably not quite as popular as Mr. Green (not the famed Clue character but Pat Green) yet, Morrow had the crowd on his side from the second he strapped on his guitar. The Cory Morrow Band is amazing, especially his drummer and guitarist who are both new and believe me, Cory didnt make a mistake in hiring these men. For all of you who have never heard either one of these guys, or I guess I should say for those of you who havent seen their live shows, this is not your typical country concert, these guys know how to rock with the best of them or I would not be including them on this site dedicated to rock. They dont wear cowboy hats, they dont sing about their dead dogs, they just like to drink, party, and rock crowds. Morrow first set the crowd into a frenzy with Texas Time Travelin which is one of those songs I knew, he may be lacking a little in the showmanship value to Pat but he makes up for it with his stellar voice. He then brought up the president of Tri-Delta here at Texas Tech, definitely one of the hottest sororities here on campus who sings a with him on a few songs on his new album. What can I say, these songs ruled mainly because she was there, and yes she was hot, and yes her ability to sing made her even hotter. Morrow then sang one of his better songs entitled Nashville Blues which is pretty much just a roll call of great Texas artists such as Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, and late legends such as Townes Van Zandt and Stevie Ray Vaughn. Morrow ended his hour long set with my favorite one his songs so far in my short time of exposure, Big City Stripper, which is a great sing-a-long with a funny story, and a lashing out at the catastrophe of the five dollar beers. Cory was definitely a great experience and would have been well worth the $18 ticket himself, but the night was only beginning.\n\nPat F-ing Green, as his fans love to chant before he comes on stage has taken over the throne as the king of Texas Music along with the likes of Morrow and Robert Earl Keen from greats such as Willie Nelson, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Waylon Jennings. The Texas Songwriter came on stage to the roars of a packed house, which Im sure was above the fire code standards of 2,400 sporting a Cory Morrow shirt that simply says Nashville Sucks on the front and a Hawaiian shirt over that with a Miller Lite hat, the beer he so proudly supports, by the way, Be True to Texas, Shes True To You, drink Miller Lite! Pats band is also a big help in his success with rock star look-a-likes guitarist Brett Danaher, who can rock like no other, and drummer Justin Pollard who once sported a Tool shirt at a show. Pat played an abbreviated set relative to his normal shows but it was all good because there was a big surprise in store. Opening with the title cut from his most recent album Carry On Green worked the crowd into a frenzy. It was a hit party for Pat, who just played crowd favorite after crowd favorite including Whiskey, Here We Go, with its famous spoken verse in the middle that the crowd recited word for word with him about Copenhagen and how that shitll kill you if the women dont get you first, #2, and Southbound 35 (thats the interstate 35 for all you non-Texans, or non-Oklahomans, or non-Missourians??? The highlight of any Pat Green show though has to be the hit Georges Bar, the tale about his favorite bar in his hometown of Waco. This song is usually the song Pat closes with, and this instance was no different, but it was awfully early to be ending so it left everyone a little curious like George.\n\nThe crowd of by this time, mostly drunk college students, was shocked to see Cory come back out with his good friend Pat along with his entire band to play another hour and a half together to promote their new CD The Songs We Wish Wed Written. They pulled out all the stops, two drummers going at once, four guitarists counting Green and Morrow on their acoustics, Pats fiddle player, and Corys steel guitarist, for a total of ten people on stage jamming for what was easily the highlight of the night. They started out with Mr. Greens most sentimental song to date, Songs About Texas which is the ultimate love song written about the state he loves so much with Green and Morrow trading off verses. After the song, the two embraced and both flashed their guns in the air, everyone knows Pat Green is a Tech graduate but rumors say Morrow is a filthy Aggie, well know those rumors are dispelled. They continued to play a set of songs they wish theyd written including songs by Jerry Jeff Walker, Townes Van Zandt, and Waylon Jennings. The set also included a few songs they actually did write that will appear on the new album, including the new song Texas Sun, which is definitely a winner. Pat and Cory also sang their duet crowd favorite Drink One More Round On Me which is really the only song the whole crowd seemed to be able to sing with. This song is your typical college, party song about floating down the Guadalupe with a cold case of Lone Star and stumbling into the nearest bar at the end of the day. The set ended with a blistering rendition of Lubbock hometown boy, and rock n roll legend Buddy Hollys Not Fade Away. This song took about 10 minutes to play because of the many electrifying instrumentals that were accompanied by the band introductions. The most noticeable of these were from the two lead guitarists and Morrows drummer, especially Morrows new guitarist though who resembled Jimi Hendrix wailing on the guitar and then beating the hell out of it in an adrenaline-fueled rage, which of course got a rock sign and a you f-ing rock yell from me, which he responded to by shaking my hand and giving me a rock sign in return. After that, Pat switched guitars with him to play around on the electric and sent the crowd singing along to his playing of the rock classic Back in Black by AC/DC.\n\nThat was the end of the show and then came the really cool part, Pat and Cory both signed my Texas flag and the poster that I ripped off the club walls, the Texas flag being one of my most prized possessions now along with my Bowling for Soup bowling pin. I also took a whole roll of film, which I will try to include on the site when I get them back. I know it may be hard for some of you to believe when I say this but this show, Ive decided, is in the top 6 shows Ive ever seen along with Rage, Korn, Deftones, Blink 182 and Goldfinger. You may be saying to yourself, How can this rock mastermind say a country concert is that good? My reply to that is, check them out live and youll see what the hype is about, these guys can flat-out rock with the best of them.\n\nAnd the really cool part is they dont care about the big business Nashville music has become, they just want to play to their true fans and drink beer, and the thing is, theyve actually became very successful at what they do, dont believe me, check out the Wall Street Journal article about Green on his website about his method of money-making as a Texas artist. I give this show two full fisted rock signs, it doesnt get much better! Rock.\n\nReview by Adam Boedeker\n\nEmail comments to mltru2tx@hotmail.com"
