        "text": "Mr. Green,\n\nWe go way back. Not quite way back Texas, but at least way back D.C. When I was in college, I saw you play for the first time live in DC – I think it was the 9:30 club. At the time that seemed to be the farthest north you were playing, and I must have drove down from college in NH to see the show. Reverse engineering the timeline that must have been 2008/2009 – I recall you introducing Let Me, which I think hadn’t been released at the time. At that first show you signed my Mets hat and a PFG tee. Can share full story at later date, but that Mets hat was subsequently signed by a former US ambassador to the UN. I told him he was in good company. I think he laughed. I did not. I lost that hat on a fishing trip. See shirt in picture below – which you graciously resigned, after the first sig basically came off in the wash.\n\nI think your music is very good. My humble country music blog has probably devoted more space to you than any other country artist. I’ve been to a bunch of your concerts, including a bunch of Texas Independence Day shows in NYC. Definitely not as many shows as some or probably most of your fans from Texas, but I suspect I’m super high in the rankings of number of Pat Green shows attended by a person who comes from Connecticut. And almost certainly in top 5 in enthusiasm. Here we are below having a great time!\n\nAnyway, here’s a couple links to posts about you: one, two, three, four.\n\nSo, I’m getting married late July 2020 in Philadelphia. Not just because I’m sure she’ll read this post, my fiancé is absolutely wonderful. I’m very Lucky. (Get it?!) I understand you’ve got a ton going on: family, friends, new material, tours, etc – but it would be incredibly awesome if you were able to stop by to maybe have a couple bourbons and sing a couple songs. (Don’t want to get bogged down in details here but see FN on logistics). Having one of my very favorite singer-songwriters celebrating with our friends and family would really be a great bonus on top of what will already be an amazing day. See comment on absolutely wonderful fiancé above. Most of our friends are a nice combo of fun and reasonable, so should be a solid atmosphere. My friend Greg would I’m sure just be going crazy with excitement, but I promise we’ll keep him in check.\n\nI’ve only got this one country music blog, and I’m not asking any other country singers about this. Full disclosure, if Casey Donahew Band or Cody Johnson were like “hey, we heard about your wedding from your blog post letter to Pat, can we get in on that?” I’d be pretty excited. But I’d have to say, “I don’t know, I asked Pat first, let me check with him”. But, you know, let’s cross that bridge if we get to it.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading. Hope to hear from you!\n\nFN on logistics: I think we could figure out the logistics. Just FYI, we’ll be having a band, and not looking for any sort of concert lift on your end (unless you’re into that). Was envisioning more of a casual share a drink or two, sing a bit, hang out a bit sort of thing."
