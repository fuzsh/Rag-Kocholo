        "text": "Pat Green has blazed his own trail in a way that few artists today can claim. After rising through Texas’ college-town and dancehall scene years ago, Green earned himself major-label support in Nashville and became the poster child of Texas music for a whole generation of fans. His list of achievements includes over 2 million albums sold, three Grammy nominations and a sold out Houston Astrodome.\n\nMarked by resilience, maturity, and the optimistic joy of a creative resurgence, Pat Green’s newest album Miles and Miles of You is the work of an icon reclaiming ground only he himself could have ceded. Ten fresh tracks feel like the spiritual exhale of a celebrated troubadour, taking fans on a journey to the other side of turmoil … and to a place where the old ways feel new again.\n\nCredited as one of Texas country’s modern-era founding fathers, Green has traveled many roads in the 25 years since his debut album, Dancehall Dreamer. A singer-songwriter with a restless creative spirit, his career has gone beyond the bounds of a “country star” to include the work of a painter, sculptor, philanthropist, family man and more. But one constant has remained – his vision.\n\nCombining Southwestern country traditions with the rebellious spirit of rock ‘n’ roll, and adding in a poet’s literary flourish, it was Green’s vision which brought the organic, true-to-yourself Texas style to the country mainstream in the early 2000s. With watershed tracks like “Carry On,” “Three Days” and the Grammy nominated Top 5 Billboard Country Airplay hit, “Wave On Wave,” he’s gone on to sell more than two million records and notch a string of Top Ten hits on the Billboard Country Radio chart, 12 Number Ones at Texas radio, a headlining sell out of the Houston Astrodome and tours with Dave Matthews Band, Willie Nelson, Kenny Chesney and others."
