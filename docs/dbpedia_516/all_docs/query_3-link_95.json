Listen to it exclusively on aolmusic.com for the next 24 hours, then tell us what you think.\n\nmusic.aol.com/franchise/firstlisten.adp\n\nanyone have any word on the date for ad's?\n\nPost by Perp on\n\nIt's pretty good, although I'll admit I'm not the biggest fan of his vocals. I've always been more partial to female singers, in any case. Kassidy Osborn singing lead on this with Kelsi & Kristyn harmonzing would have made a nice track. ;)\n\nAOL Poll results so far:\n\n71% I love it!\n\n26% It's okay.\n\n3% I hate it!\n\nPost by avalyn on\n\nThe new album comes out in August. There is a track on it with Sara Evans. No word if it's a full blown duet or a background vocal appearance form Sara.\n\nNow that you mentioned Wave on wave it does sound like this new song. I thoguht it reminded me of another song I couldn't place it.\n\nPost by Zazie on\n\navalyn said:\n\nThe new album comes out in August. There is a track on it with Sara Evans.

I thoguht it reminded me of another song I couldn't place it.\n\nThe intro sounds just like the intro to an old Mary Chapin Carpenter song. I'm pretty sure it's Passionate Kisses but my memory might be playing tricks on me.\n\nThis sounds like a hit for Pat. The Texans are taking over country radio!\n\nPost by Jim King on\n\nzazie said:\n\navalyn said:\n\nThe intro sounds just like the intro to an old Mary Chapin Carpenter song. I'm pretty sure it's Passionate Kisses but my memory might be playing tricks on me.\n\nGood call on Mary Chapin Carpenter. It sounds like the intro to several of her songs including \"Quittin' Time\" and \"Never Had It So Good.\"\n\nDon't misunderstand me, I love Pat Green, but this sounds very derivative to me. I loved \"Baby Doll\" and \"Guy Like Me.\"\n\n~ Jim\n\nPost by Perp on\n\nThis song's rocket-like climb sure looks more like the one reserved for superstars. What's the deal? Why is there so much right-of-the-box support from so many powerhouse stations? I mean, look at the Format Leaders chart! All had zero spins last week and he's already in heavy rotation at a few. It all looks completely orchestrated. My hat's off to his promo team.\n\nThese are crazy numbers for a brand-new song by someone who isn't a huge superstar... Especially a song that many here seem to think was already a hit in the past and this is just a re-hash.\n\nPost by bigbluenote on\n\nOk, so it seems that people keep asking what's going on with this song.\n\nRemember:\n\nPat Green is/was a TEXAS artist. The Texas stations ALWAYS play Pat Green. Both stations here in San Antonio play Pat Green on a regular basis. And remember that with Dallas and Houston, ANY song can get MAJOR audience.\n\nNow, TEXAS stations that are playing this new single:\n\nAll 3 Dallas stations.\n\nBoth Houston stations.\n\nBoth Corpus Christi stations.\n\nAnd I'm sure the stations here in San Antonio won't be to far behind along with the station in Austin, Beaumont, and in El Paso.\n\nPat Green will ALWAYS have MAJOR support from the Texas stations.\n\nSo that explains a lot of the audience he is already getting.\n\nAs to why other stations are playing him so quick already...............I don't know. Maybe they're jumping on the Pat Green bandwagon?\n\nPost by Perp on\n\n^ I'm aware of the big TX stations jumping on it (I mentioned that back on the 11th). But Minneapolis, Chicago, Denver, Phoenix, Youngstown, and Baltimore too? This song must be way better than I initially thought . *cough* ;)\n\nHow well have his previous singles done on the charts, anyway? I know ZIP about him other than he's a Texan.\n\nPost by Zazie on\n\nFamiliarity is usually an asset, not a liability, on country radio. Go wandering through Mr. Chesney's catalog and you will find songs that have had enormous success by sounding alike. Alan Jackson, Tim McGraw, George Strait -- they've all had their formula songs. Why all of a sudden is Pat Green a lightning rod for all the complaints about lack of originality?\n\nIt does sound a lot like Wave on Wave. He's looking for a hit song. Carry On was original, and got him barely into the top 40. Three Days was original, same story. Wave on Wave was a good song, one that sounded like a lot of others; it reached #3.\n\nNot that your various criticisms are wrong -- but Pat's just doing what the others do. I liked his earlier stuff better, myself, but I guess he wants a slice of nationwide exposure and fame. And the new one is pretty good. Derivative, but good.\n\nPost by Jim King on\n\nzazie said:\n\nFamiliarity is usually an asset, not a liability, on country radio.

Derivative, but good.\n\nSince I started the WOW part 2 comparisons, I must say that the song has grown on me. I still smile as the Mary Chapin Carperter licks come on, and there is one point in the chorus that's lifted directly from WOW, so I stand by my analysis (not criticism).\n\nThe song has some interesting things to say, though, and I love Pat Green and his Texas outlaw personna, so who cares if he's trying to buy chart position. Everybody else does...<cough, payola>\n\nJim, running for cover from Zazie\n\nPost by Perp on\n\nI assumed it's newsworthy when someone without a proven track record of a string of big hits suddenly gets a great start like this. I realize I post items that may not be important in the grand scheme of things (chart twitches), and I tend to conjecture (fancy word for wild guessing) a lot when it comes to trying to figure out what's going on. I should ease up so I don't step on so many toes. Since there seems to be a consensus that people don't want to hear about it anymore, I'll do my best to hold back on payola inferences.\n\nPost by bigbluenote on\n\nSo I have heard this song enough now to form a good opinion.\n\nI LOVE IT! It isn't so much 'Texas country', which is what Pat does best, but it is country. And this song doesn't sound in any way, shape, or form like 'Wave On Wave'. This is a GREAT turn the radio up in the truck song.\n\nPost by bamafan2102 on\n\nI am not a Pat Green fan at all but this is pretty good! I did not like Wave on Wave or Carry On. I like his \"live\" sound that seems to follow him. Nothing seems polished. Now if we could just get Drew Womak to bust out of Texas and make a return to the charts!"
