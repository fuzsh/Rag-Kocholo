        "text": "After spending 15 years as a drummer for several of Texas Country’s most\n\naccomplished singer-songwriters, Michael Kelton, armed with a slew of well-crafted, original songs, is making his move from the back of the stage up to the microphone at the front. Raised by a musical family in Austin, Texas, Kelton found life as a musician came naturally. His bass-playing father Noel is a founding member of Texas legends Johnny Dee & the Rocket 88’s, who Kelton found himself on stage with on more than one occasion.\n\n​\n\nFifteen years on the road holding down the rhythm for some of Texas' most notable singer/songwriters - Zane Williams, Hayes Carll, Brian Keane, Mark McKinney, Matt Caldwell, Bri Bagwell and currently Pat Green - helped Kelton to reach a songwriting milestone of his own. In 2021, he secured two songwriting credits on Pat Green’s latest release.\n\n“Working under the caliber of songwriters that I have has been a blessing and a curse,” said Kelton. “Although I was slowly soaking up their process, I was constantly comparing my work to theirs. That was frustrating at times, but also challenged me to always do better. Having the opportunity to contribute to an album for someone as great as Pat really, for me, confirmed I have been headed in the right direction as a songwriter.”"
