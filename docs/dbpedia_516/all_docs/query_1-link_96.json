        "text": "When it comes to Texas/Red Dirt music, Pat Green is a living legend. He was a pioneer of the genre over 25 years ago and shows no signs of slowing down as he performs at Cooper's BBQ Live in Christoval tonight.\n\nThis is truly one of those must see shows which by the way, will be full band. Get ready for one of the most electrifying entertainers you will ever see. Not only will you hear numerous hit songs from his past 13 albums, but you will also be hearing new music as well.\n\nEarlier this week I had the opportunity to catch up with Pat and talk about what's going on in his world, his music and more. One of the things that I was very excited to hear is that he and the band have a new album coming out. Take a moment to check out the short interview that aired earlier this week:\n\nPat Green has left his mark on countless fans and generations of artists. So much so that numerous top Texas/Red Dirt bands and artist got together some time back and recorded a tribute album to him called \"Dancehall Dreamin\" featuring everyone from Jack Ingram to the Randy Rogers Band and many more.\n\nThat album was conceived as a heartfelt gift for Pat's 46th Birthday. By the way, he just celebrated his 49th Birthday.\n\nWhen you stop and think who actually put Texas/Red Dirt on the map....Pat Green's name is certainly among those at the top of the list.\n\nIt's going to be a great night for live music tonight with Pat Green and special guest 12 Mile.\n\nGet your tickets for Pat Green at originalcoopersbbq.com. For more information, call Cooper's at 325-255-2222. Get there early and enjoy some of Cooper's delicious and famous Bar-B-Que and be ready to party!!"
