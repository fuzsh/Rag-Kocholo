He considers his genre post-Americana - a mix of Americana, rock and country. During an interview with Media Hub, he described it as “Americana with a pop sensibility, story songs with banger hooks.”\n\n​\n\nGreen, hailed for his distinctive fusion of rock 'n' roll and soulful country, has solidified his reputation as a Texas music scene icon. His electrifying stage presence has enraptured audiences, sharing the spotlight with renowned national acts such as Lainey Wilson, Parker McCollum, Ely Young Band, Randy Rogers, and Giovannie & the Hired Guns. Joey Green's star shines bright on the international stage, courtesy of his pivotal role in the acclaimed Texas Music Takeover tour, where he shared stages with notable Texas artists, including Pat Green, Koe Wetzel, Vaden Todd Lewis (Toadies), Casey Donahew, Cody Canada, and Wade Bowen.\n\n​\n\nAdding to his string of accomplishments this year, Joey Green reached the coveted #1 position on the Texas Regional Radio Charts with his sensational collaboration, \"Old Timers,\" featuring George Ducas.

Both captivating videos have secured impressive spots in the \"Taste of Country\" Top 10 Country Music Video Countdown for a remarkable fourteen months. His singles \"Saturdays Are for The Boys\", \"This House Ain't Big Enough\", and \"Puttin' It Out There\" have consistently held strong positions in the Top 100 on the Texas Regional and Texas Music Charts, firmly establishing Joey Green as a rising star in the country music landscape.\n\n​\n\nGreen has eight albums to his credit, the latest “Puttin’ It Out There,” a 6-song EP was released in May 2022. “The War,” was an 11-song project released in 2015.

With his unique vocal stylings, Green breathed new life into iconic tracks like Goo Goo Dolls' \"Iris,\" Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Fortunate Son,\" and a remarkable mashup of Train's \"Drops of Jupiter\" and Matchbox Twenty's \"Bright Lights.\"\n\n​\n\nGreen looks forward to a stacked schedule this year as he was honored to be added to the USO Tour Roster, inked a new publishing deal with Warner Chappell|Space Colonel Management, and committed to a new agency, New Frontier Touring."
