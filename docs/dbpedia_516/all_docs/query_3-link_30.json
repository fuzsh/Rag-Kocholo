        "text": "Founded in 2012, our goal is to help those who have dedicated their lives to helping others. Our aim is to generate funds and raise public awareness for other community-based organizations by presenting golf tournaments and events of the highest order. It is our greatest hope that the people who help us in this endeavor share in the joy that comes from giving.\n\nCredited as one of Texas country’s modern-era founding fathers, Green has traveled many roads in the 25 years since his debut album, Dancehall Dreamer. A Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter with a restless creative spirit, his career has gone beyond the bounds of a “country star” to include the work of a painter, sculptor, philanthropist, family man, and more. But one constant has remained – his vision.\n\nCombining Southwestern country traditions with the rebellious spirit of rock ‘n’ roll, and adding in a poet’s literary flourish, Green’s vision brought the organic, true-to-yourself Texas style to the country mainstream in the early 2000s. With watershed tracks like “Carry On,” “Three Days” and the Grammy-nominated Top 5 Billboard Country Airplay hit, “Wave On Wave,” he’s gone on to sell more than two million records and notch a string of Top Ten hits on the Billboard Country Radio chart, 12 Number Ones at Texas radio, a headlining sell out of the Houston Astrodome and tours with Dave Matthews Band, Willie Nelson, Kenny Chesney and others. His vision paved the way for a generation of fiercely-independent Texan talent, and with the new album, Miles and Miles of You, that vision is focused like never before."
