        "text": "I don't know the song, but I read the lyrics you posted, and I find it ironic that the only singer he referenced with less talent than himself was Toby Keith. Homeboy might not want to drop(kick) names of a bunch of folks who can run circles around him and STILL suck (or not, depending on the reference).\n\nThe new album has a re-cut of \"Carry On\". He replaced the line \"Come down to Texas and drink with me a while\" to \"Come down to my place and drink we me a while\". He's dead to me.\n\nThree Days was okay, Wave on Wave had one good song (\"Run\"), and everything since has been absolute crap. I've never described it as \"selling out\", he's just not good anymore.\n\nThe irony is that he's been such a bad sell out, failing to hit it big with Nashville and losing his Texas fan base in the process.\n\nWith that said, I don't think he has consciously attempted to sell out. He did not decide \"I'm going to change my music to sell more records.\" His life just changed and what inspired his early music -- youth, love, heart ache, struggle and failure -- disappeared. It happens to a lot of Artists. Their success makes life easier and takes away the muse which made them successful in the first place."
