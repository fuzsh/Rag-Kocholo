        "text": "For men approaching their 50th birthdays, some sort of midlife crisis where question marks outnumber the candles on their birthday cakes is pretty common, if not expected.\n\nCelebrated Texas singer-songwriter Pat Green is not one of these common men. Life these days looks and feels pretty sweet for perhaps the biggest artist to emerge from the Texas country explosion of the late ’90s and early 2000s.\n\nWith a pair of sold-out shows at the legendary Gruene Hall in New Braunfels a few days after his April 5 birthday and the upcoming Rock the Coast festival in Galveston April 30, Green sounds like a guy who’s comfortable and secure when we chat over the phone as he’s getting his car washed near his Fort Worth home.\n\nAnd why shouldn’t he be? Green’s heartland rock-flavored twang has sold millions of albums, filled countless concert halls around the United States and won him the undying devotion of a fan base that refuses to ever let him go.\n\nHe hasn’t released a full album since 2015’s “Home,” but that will change later this year when his new album, “Miles and Miles of You,” sees the light of day. During that hiatus, Green’s admirers haven’t been abandoning him in favor of a younger flavor of the month.\n\nNew songs from the upcoming album have been trickling out, with the revved-up “All in This Together” and the dreamy title track, written by Dallas native Jon Randall, already racking up respectable streaming numbers.\n\n“Man, I just kind of release music when I want to,” Green says over the phone. “And after a 25-year career in music, you know, I love being able to do what I want.”\n\nRefreshingly, Green isn’t holding out hope that his new album will send his name soaring back to the top of the Billboard charts or return him to the sort of mainstream glory he enjoyed almost 20 years ago when his signature song, “Wave on Wave,” was nominated for a Grammy.\n\nAfter recording a number of albums on major Nashville record labels, the Texas Tech University graduate is an independent artist these days, and he’s one who crafts songs that don’t fit neatly into the corporate radio marketing metrics and algorithms.\n\nOf course, on top of that, seven years between album releases is basically a lifetime in the minds of record label execs and national radio programmers. Just as his career has evolved, so, too, has his own definition of what success looks like for a new record.\n\n“When it comes to music I put out, I hope that it helps increase the longevity that my band has, that we stay relevant because people still like what we do,” he says.\n\nIt’s not that every day has been just one serendipitous moment after another. The pandemic was “very depressing for me,” he says. Not only did he and his band stop touring, but Galleywinter Gallery, his Fort Worth art space housing his sculpture work and that of other artists, had to be closed permanently.\n\nBut don’t think for a moment that Green doesn’t appreciate his station in life.\n\n“You know, life is as good as it can be for me,” he says."
