Combining Southwestern country traditions with the rebellious spirit of rock ‘n’ roll, and adding in a poet’s literary flourish, it was Green’s vision which brought the organic, true-to-yourself Texas style to the country mainstream in the early 2000s.\n\nYou don’t want to miss this special night with Pat Green performing his greatest hits, backed by the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra!"
