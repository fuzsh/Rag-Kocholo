Trivia[]

The modern name of this place is Brest. In Belarusian it is written Брэст, in Russian Брест, in Polish Brześć, in Lithuanian Brasta, but in Ukrainian it is still Берестя Berestia. It was also named "Lithuanian Brest" (Polish: Brześć Litewski, Russian: Брест-Литовск Brest-Litovsk) to contrast with Brześć Kujawski in Poland.
