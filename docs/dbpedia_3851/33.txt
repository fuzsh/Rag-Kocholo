Berestia is the part of Belarusian, Polish, and Ukrainian ethnic territory, bounded by the Bug River, Pripyat River, Yaselda River, and Narew (Narva) River. Its main cities were Berestia (now Brest), Drahichyn, Kobryn, and Kamianiec. From 1080 to 1150 the land belonged to the Principality of Turów-Pinsk (Turiv-Pynske) {Turów, Pinsk}, later to the principality of Volhynia, and after 1320 to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. From 1569 to 1795 it constituted the Brześć Litewski Voivodeship of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After the third partition of the Commonwealth (1795), the territory was annexed to the Russian Empire.
