For the treaty, see Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.\n\nCity in Brest Region, Belarus\n\nBrest, formerly Brest-Litovsk and Brest-on-the-Bug,[a] is a city in Belarus at the border with Poland opposite the Polish town of Terespol, where the Bug and Mukhavets rivers meet, making it a border town. It serves as the administrative center of Brest Region and Brest District, though it is administratively separated from the district.[1] As of 2024, it has a population of 344,470.[1]\n\nHistorical populationYearPop.±%189746,568— 193941,400−11.1%195973,614+77.8%1970121,629+65.2%1979177,249+45.7%1989258,016+45.6%1999286,400+11.0%2009309,764+8.2%2019338,979+9.4%Source: pop-stat.mashke.org[2]\n\nBrest is one of the oldest cities in Belarus and a historical site for many cultures, as it hosted important historical events, such as the Union of Brest and Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Furthermore, the Brest Fortress was recognized by the Soviet Union as a Hero Fortress in honour of the defense of Brest Fortress in June 1941.\n\nIn the High Middle Ages, the city often passed between Poland, the principalities of Kievan Rus', and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. From the Late Middle Ages to 1795, the city was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which later became a part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1569. In 1795, it was incorporated into the Russian Empire with the Third Partition of Poland. After the Polish-Soviet War, the city became part of the Second Polish Republic. In 1939, the city was captured by Nazi Germany during the invasion of Poland and then transferred to the Soviet Union per the German–Soviet Frontier Treaty. In 1941, it was retaken by the Germans during Operation Barbarossa. In 1944, it was retaken by the Soviet Red Army during the Lublin–Brest offensive.[3] The city was part of the Byelorussian SSR until the breakup of the USSR in 1991. Since then, Brest has been part of independent Belarus.\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral theories attempt to explain the origin of the city's name. The name could originate from Slavic root berest meaning \"elm\". It could likewise have come from the Lithuanian word brasta meaning \"ford\".[4]\n\nTraditionally, Belarusian-speakers called the city Берасце (Bieraście), similar to the Ukrainian name Берестя (Berestia).\n\nOnce a center of Jewish scholarship, the city has the Yiddish name בריסק (Brisk), hence the term \"Brisker\" used to describe followers of the influential Soloveitchik family of rabbis.\n\nBrest became a part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1319.[5] In the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth formed in 1569, the town became known in Polish as Brześć, historically Brześć Litewski (literally: \"Lithuanian Brest\", in contradistinction to Brześć Kujawski). Brześć became part of the Russian Empire under the name Brest-Litovsk or Brest-Litovskii (Russian: Брест-Литовск, Брест-Литовский, literally \"Lithuanian Brest\") in the course of the Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795. After World War I, and the rebirth of Poland in 1918, the government of the Second Polish Republic renamed the city as Brześć nad Bugiem (\"Brest on the Bug\") on 20 March 1923.[6] After World War II, the city became part of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic with the name simplified as Brest.\n\nBrest's coat of arms, adopted on 26 January 1991, features an arrow pointed upwards and a bow (both silver) on a sky-blue shield. An alternative coat of arms has a red shield. Sigismund II Augustus, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, first granted Brest a coat of arms in 1554.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a town, Brest – Berestye in Kievan Rus – was first mentioned in the Primary Chronicle in 1019 when the Kievan Rus' took the stronghold from the Poles. It is one of the oldest cities in Belarus.[7] It was hotly contested between the Polish rulers (kings, principal dukes and dukes of Masovia) and Kievan Rus princes. It was recaptured by Poland in 1020, and unsuccessfully besieged by Prince Yaroslav the Wise of Kiev in 1022. It was captured by Yaroslav the Wise, according to various sources, either in 1042 or 1044,[9] then by 1076 recaptured by King Bolesław II the Bold of Poland,[9] but then lost again by his successor Władysław I Herman. Afterwards, it often passed between the principalities of Turov and Volhynia. In 1164, it was briefly captured by Lithuanians. In 1178, it was captured by Casimir II the Just of Poland, and made the seat of his fraternal nephew Leszek, Duke of Masovia, who, however, soon lost it to the Principality of Minsk. In 1182, Casimir II the Just captured the city once again,[9] and then granted it as a fief to his sororal nephew Roman the Great the following year. It was laid waste by the Mongols in 1241 (see: First Mongol invasion of Poland), and was not rebuilt until 1275. Possibly since the 1270s, the city was contested by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia.[10]\n\nGrand Duchy of Lithuania\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1319, the city became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and Grand Duke Gediminas stayed in the city in the winter of 1319–1320, preparing to capture Kyiv.[9] In 1349, it was captured by King Casimir III of Poland, however, it was restored to Lithuania in 1352.[12] Its suburbs were burned by the Teutonic Order in 1379. In 1385, it became part of the Polish–Lithuanian union. During the Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392), in 1390, the city was captured by Polish forces of Władysław II Jagiełło.[13]\n\nIn 1390 Brest became the first city in the lands that now are Belarus to receive Magdeburg rights.\n\nIn 1409 it was a meeting place of King Władysław II Jagiełło, Grand Duke Vytautas the Great and Khan Jalal al-Din Khan ibn Tokhtamysh under the Polish Deputy Chancellor Mikołaj Trąba's initiative, to prepare for war with the Teutonic Knights, which resulted in the Tatars aiding Poland and Lithuania in the Battle of Grunwald the following year.[9][14] In 1410 the city mustered a cavalry banner that participated in the Polish-Lithuanian military victory at Grunwald.\n\nIn 1419 it became a seat of the starost in the newly created Trakai Voivodeship. Under Władysław II and Vytautas the city was significantly developed and granted privileges similar to those of the Polish city of Lublin.[9] In 1425, the city hosted a congress attended by Władysław II, Vytautas, dukes of Masovia and Polish and Lithuanian nobles.[17] In 1440, a Sejm of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was held in the city, at which Casimir IV Jagiellon was chosen Grand Duke of Lithuania.[9] In 1446, a meeting of Casimir IV, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, and Polish senators regarding the political affiliation of Volhynia took place in the city, and in 1454 Casimir IV met with Lithuanian nobility to convince them to participate in the Polish–Teutonic War on the side of Poland.[9]\n\nPolish—Lithuanian Commonwealth\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1500, it was burned again by Crimean Tatars. From 1513, the city was administratively located in the Podlaskie Voivodeship. In 1566, following the decree of Sigismund II Augustus, a new voivodeship was created – Brest Litovsk Voivodeship.\n\nDuring the union of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Swedish Empire under king Sigismund III Vasa (Polish–Swedish union), diets were held there. In 1594 and 1596, it was the meeting-place of two remarkable councils of regional bishops of the Roman-Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church. The 1596 council established the Uniate Church (also known as the Belarusian Greek Catholic Church in Belarus and Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine). A Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was held in the city in 1653.[19] A royal mint was founded in the city by King John II Casimir Vasa in 1665.\n\nIn 1657, and again in 1706, the town and castle were captured by the Swedish Army during its invasions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Then, in an attack from the other direction, on 13 January 1660, the invading Streltsy of the Tsardom of Russia under Ivan Andreyevich Khovansky took the Brest Castle in an early morning surprise attack, the town having been captured earlier, and massacred the 1,700 defenders and their families (according to an Austrian observer, Captain Rosestein).\n\nPartitions\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 23 July 1792, the defending Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army, under the leadership of Szymon Zabiełło, and the invading Imperial Russian Army fought a battle near Brześć. On 19 September 1794, the area between Brest and Terespol was the site of another battle won by the Russian invaders led by Alexander Suvorov over a Polish-Lithuanian division under General Karol Sierakowski. Thereafter, Brest was annexed by Russia when the Poland-Lithuania Commonwealth was partitioned for the third time in 1795.\n\n19th century to World War I\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring Russian rule in the 19th century, Brest Fortress was built in and around the city. The Russians demolished the Polish Royal Castle and most Old Town \"to make room\" for the fortress.[citation needed] The main Jewish synagogue in the city, the Choral Synagogue, was completed c. 1862.\n\nDuring World War I, the town was captured by the Imperial German Army under August von Mackensen on 25 August 1915, during the Great Retreat of 1915.[20] Shortly after Brest fell into German hands, war poet August Stramm, who has been called \"the first of the Expressionists\" and one of \"the most innovative poets of the First World War,\"[21] was shot in the head during an attack on nearby Russian positions on 1 September 1915.\n\nIn March 1918, in the Brest Fortress at the confluence of the Bug and Mukhavets rivers on the city' western outskirts, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed, ending the war between Soviet Russia and the Central Powers and transferring the city and its surrounding region to the sphere of influence of the German Empire. This treaty was subsequently annulled by the Paris Peace Conference treaties which ended the war and even more so by events and developments in Central and Eastern Europe. During 1918, the city became a part of the Volhynia Governorate of the Ukrainian People's Republic as a result of negotiations and own treaty between the delegation of the Ukrainian Central Rada and Central Powers.[22]\n\nInterwar Poland\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 9 February 1919, Polish troops entered the city, and it returned to Poland, which regained independence three months earlier. During the Polish–Soviet War it was occupied by the Soviet Russians on 1 August 1920, and recaptured by the Poles on 20 August, with borders formally recognized by the Treaty of Riga of 1921. In 1921, it became the temporary capital of the Polesie Voivodeship instead of Pińsk. It was renamed Brześć nad Bugiem (Brest on the Bug) on 20 March 1923.\n\nThe city was developed significantly and a number of representative public buildings were erected in Neoclassical and Modernist styles, especially at Ulica Unii Lubelskiej (Union of Lublin Street, now Lenin Street), including the Bank of Poland, Tax Chamber, Regional Chamber of the State Control, Healthcare Fund and Voivodeship Office. Other notable projects include the officials' housing estate, stylistically inspired by historic manor houses of Polish nobility and the garden city movement, and the Warburg Residential Colony, dedicated to poor Jews who had lost their homes in World War I, founded by Felix M. Warburg, chairman of the Joint Distribution Committee of American Funds for Jewish War Sufferers. In 1929, city limits were greatly expanded.[30]\n\nIn the twenty years of Poland's sovereignty, of the total of 36 brand new schools established in the city, there were ten public, and five private Jewish schools inaugurated, with Yiddish and Hebrew as the language of instruction. The first-ever Jewish school in Brześć history opened in 1920, almost immediately after Poland's return to independence. In 1936 Jews constituted 41.3% of the Brześć population or 21,518 citizens. Some 80.3% of private enterprises were run by Jews.[32][33][34] The Polish Army troops of the 9th Military District along with its headquarters were stationed in Brześć Fortress.\n\nThe city had an overwhelmingly Jewish population in the Russian Partition: 30,000 out of 45,000 total population according to Russian 1897 census, which fell to 21,000 out of 50,000 according to the Polish census of 1931.[35][36]\n\nWorld War II\n\n[edit]\n\nIn early September 1939, the Polish government evacuated a portion of the Polish gold reserve from Warsaw to Brześć, and then further southeast to Śniatyn at the Poland-Romania border, from where it was transported via Romania and Turkey to territory controlled by Polish-allied France.[37]\n\nDuring the German Invasion of Poland in 1939, the city was defended by a small garrison of four infantry battalions under General Konstanty Plisowski against General Heinz Guderian's XIX Panzer Corps. After four days of heavy fighting, the Polish forces withdrew southwards on 17 September. The Soviet invasion of Poland began on the same day. As a result, the Soviet Red Army entered the city at the end of September 1939 following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact's Secret Protocol, and a joint Nazi-Soviet military parade took place on 22 September 1939. While Belarusians consider it a reunification of the Belarusian nation under one constituency (the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic at that time), Poles consider it the date when the city was lost. During the Soviet control (1939–41), the Polish population was subject to arrests, executions and mass deportations to Siberia and the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. Many Poles were imprisoned in the local prison, and then moved to a prison in Minsk.[38] It is suspected that they were murdered by the Soviets in the Katyn massacre in 1940.[38]\n\nFurther information: Brest Ghetto\n\nOn 22 June 1941, Brest Fortress and the city were attacked by Nazi Germany on the first day of Operation Barbarossa, Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union. The fortress held out for six days. Nearly all its Soviet army defenders perished. The Germans placed Brest under the administration of the Reichskommissariat Ukraine. The remaining municipal Jewish population (about 20,000) was sequestered in the Brest ghetto established by the German authorities in December 1941 and later murdered in October 1942. Only seven Jews survived the Nazi executions.[36]\n\nThe Germans also operated a Nazi prison, a forced labour \"education\" camp for men and women, a forced labour camp for Jews, the AGSSt 3 prisoner-of-war assembly center, the Dulag 314 transit POW camp for Italians, the Stalag 397 POW camp for Soviet POWs and a subcamp of the Stalag 360 POW camp in the city.[39][40][41][42]\n\nThe Polish resistance movement, including the Polesie District of the Home Army, was active in the city.\n\nThe city was re-occupied by the Red Army on 28 July 1944, and eventually annexed from Poland the following year.\n\nPost-war period\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1945, the Związek Obrońców Wolności (\"Freedom Defenders Association\") Polish resistance organization was founded in the city, with its activities including secret Polish schooling, rescuing historical Polish monuments from devastation and organising aid for repressed people and those in a difficult material situation.[43] The organization was crushed by the NKVD in 1948, and its members were deported to Gulag forced labour camps for 25 years.[43]\n\nIn early 2019, a mass grave containing the remains of 1,214 people were found in the Brest Ghetto area during a construction project. Most are believed to have been Jews murdered by Nazis.[44][45]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nBrest lies astride the Mukhavets River which flows west through the city, dividing it into north and south, and meets the Bug River in the Brest Fortress. The river flows slowly and gently. Today the river looks quite broad in Brest. The terrain is fairly flat around Brest. The river has an extremely broad floodplain, that is about 2 to 3 kilometres (1 to 2 miles) across. Brest was subject to flooding in the past. One of the worst floods in recorded history occurred in 1974.[citation needed]\n\nPart of the floodplain was reclaimed with hydraulic mining. In the 1980s, big cutter-suction dredgers mined sand and clay from the riverbed to build up the banks.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 2000s, two new residential areas were developed in the southwest of Brest.\n\nTo the east of Brest, the Dnieper–Bug Canal was built in the mid-nineteenth century to join the river to Pina, a tributary of the Pripyat River which in turn drains into the Dnieper. Thus Brest has a shipping route all the way to the Black Sea. If not for a dam and neglected weirs west of Brest, north-western European shipping would be connected with the Black Sea also.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nBrest has a humid continental climate but slightly leans towards oceanic due to the irregular winter temperatures that mostly hover around the freezing point. However, summers are warm and influenced by its inland position compared to areas nearer the Baltic Sea.\n\nPoints of interest\n\n[edit]\n\nA majestic Soviet-era war memorial was constructed on the site of the 1941 battle to commemorate the known and unknown defenders of the Brest Fortress. This war memorial is the largest tourist attraction in the city. The Berestye Archeological Museum of the old city is located on the southern island of the Hero-Fortress. It has objects and huts dating from the 11th – 13th century that were unearthed during the 1970s.\n\nThe Museum of Rescued Art Treasures has a collection of paintings and icons. Brest City Park is over 100 years old and underwent renovations from 2004 to 2006 as part of a ceremony marking the park's centennial. In July 2009, the Millennium Monument of Brest was unveiled. Sovetskaya Street is a popular tourist destination in Brest; it was dramatically reconstructed in 2007–2009. Other important landmarks include the Brest Railway Museum.\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nBrest is home to two Universities: A.S. Pushkin Brest State University and Brest State Technical University. There is also a branch of Belarusian National Technical University.\n\nAmong the secondary specialized educational institutions of the city:\n\nBrest State Railway College\n\nBrest State Medical College\n\nBrest State Musical College named after G. Shirmy\n\nBrest State Regional College of the Olympic Reserve\n\nBrest State Polytechnic College - a branch of the Brest State Technical University\n\nBrest State Professional-Technical College of Instrument Engineering\n\nBrest State College of Transport and Service\n\nBrest State College of Light Industry\n\nBrest State College of Builders\n\nBrest State Trade and Technology College\n\nBrest State College of Communications\n\nBrest State College of Service Industry\n\nBrest branch of the capital's private educational institution \"College of Business and Law.\"\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nBeing situated on the main railway line connecting Berlin and Moscow, and a transcontinental highway (the M1 highway is part of the European route E30 running from Cork to Omsk, where it links with Asian Highway 6 leading to Busan), Brest became a principal border crossing out of the Soviet Union in the postwar era. Today it links the European Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States.\n\nThe city of Brest is served by Brest-Tsentralny railway station. Because of the break-of-gauge at Brest, where the Russian broad gauge meets the European standard gauge, all passenger trains, coming from Poland, must have their bogies replaced here, to travel on across Belarus. The freight must be transloaded from cars of one gauge to cars of another. Some of the land in the Brest rail yards remains contaminated due to the transhipment of radioactive materials here since Soviet days. However, cleanup operations have been taking place.[citation needed]\n\nThe local airport, Brest Airport (code BQT), operates flights on a seasonal schedule to Kaliningrad[49] in the Russian Federation and seasonal charter flights to Burgas and Antalya.[50]\n\nSport\n\n[edit]\n\nHC Meshkov Brest is[when?] the most successful team of the Belarusian Men's Handball Championship, as well as the current (2018–19) champions. Also, there is a Women's handball club in Brest – HC Victoria-Berestie.\n\nHK Brest of the Belarusian Extraleague are the local pro hockey team.\n\nAnother popular sport in Brest is football. FC Dynamo Brest is a local club playing in Belarusian Premier League.\n\nThe sports venues are located on the northern riverside on the hydraulic fill, consisting of an indoor track-and-field centre, the Brest Ice Rink,[51] and Belarus' first outdoor baseball stadium. On the opposite riverside is a large rowing course opened in 2007, home of the National Center for Olympic Training in Rowing. It meets international requirements and can host international competitions. Moreover, it has accommodation and training facilities, favourable location, 3 kilometres (2 miles) away from the border crossing along Warsaw Highway (the European route E30).\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are some newspapers in Brest: Brestskaya Gazeta, Brestskiy Kurier, Vecherniy Brest.\n\nInternational relations\n\n[edit]\n\nSister cities\n\n[edit]\n\nSister cities of Brest include:[52]\n\nFormer twin towns:\n\nBiała Podlaska, Poland\n\nIn March 2022, the Polish city of Biała Podlaska suspended its partnership with Brest as a reaction to the Belarusian involvement in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[53]\n\nOther forms of cooperation\n\n[edit]\n\nBrest maintains partnership with:[52]\n\nHonours\n\n[edit]\n\nA minor planet, 3232 Brest, discovered by the Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Ivanovna Chernykh in 1974, is named after the city.[54]\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nRabbi Yehoshua Leib Diskin, Rabbi of Brisk\n\nMenachem Begin, late Prime Minister of Israel\n\nJarosław Dąbrowski, Polish revolutionary and general\n\nDavid Dubinsky, head of the International Ladies Garment Workers' Union\n\nAndrej Dyńko (b. 1974), journalist and editor[55]\n\nLouis Gruenberg, composer\n\nNikolay Karpol, Russian women's volleyball coach\n\nJerzy Kolendo, Polish classical archaeologist and historian\n\nHarry Kopp (1880–1943), American lawyer and politician\n\nPyotr Masherov, secretary of Belarusian committee of the Communist Party of Soviet Union\n\nYulia Nesterenko, Olympian women's 100 m champion\n\nDzmitryj Rubašeŭski (nom de guerre (“Hans”))(1992-2022), Belarusian volunteer killed in action defending Ukraine during the 2022 Russian invasion[56]\n\nNathan Sharon (1925–2011), Israeli biochemist, expert on lectins\n\nHienadz Shutau (1975 – 2020), a protestor killed during the protests against the 2020 Belarusian presidential election[57]\n\nThe Soloveitchik rabbinical family associated with the Brisk yeshivas, and descendant Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik\n\nDavid B.
