        "text": "Zenith\n\nby kjack1111\n\nChapter 2: 2 Dawn\n\nPrevious Chapter\n\nLog 1/26/0010\n\nTo be honest, I don't think any of us were expecting waking up from cold sleep only 10 years after departure. But there it was, staring us in the face. It wasn't our target planet, thats for sure. It had a massive equatorial continent, With a massive river coursing through the center. The river split off into 6 rivers, Three and the south and three in the north, Dividing the continent into six regions. Most of the regions are filled with farmland, Although there are very large icecaps, Which have more farmland underneath them. Due to the unknown specifications of reaching the area, several remote-controlled drones were sent out. Everything appeared fine, Until we saw that Luna's And Celestia's Colony ships disappeared, Whittling the fleet to just 4.\n\nThen, Surprisingly, Pinkies Penal-Colony ship (Housing several-million low-threat prisoners and the royal guard) suddenly had its habitation centrifuge break, For a completely unknown reason. Because the central core was spinning counter-clockwise, While the centrifuge was spinning clockwise, This caused a devastating inertia effect that caused the ship to completely disintegrate, resulting in the ship soon turning into a very large shrapnel cloud. Thankfully, Pinkie was on twilight's ship when it occurred.\n\nThe main colonists are fine, But the penal colonists are all dead. I mean it is kinda obvious when you get thrown out in space without protection. The problem is, Almost more then half of our colonists were aboard Celestia's and Luna's ships, which means we went from 1 billion colonists to only 500 million. This is enough for several planet-falls, But we were originally going to found 12 cities after making planet-fall. Now we can only make 6. This is extremely concerning to command, and is considering abandoning colonization. Plus, There are unidentified ships in orbit.\n\nSigned, RD.\n\n\"Hey, Jonathon, Are you seeing this on the Goldshine?\" I asked through the radio. A gravitational anomaly appeared around berestia 3, Just when we were about to burn into a gravitational slingshot around alpha Centauri A. \"Copy, Got a anon on sector 10-4, Looks alien in origin, Do you copy\"?\n\n\"Yep Jonathon i copy, Do we have enough Delta-V to burn out of here, over.\" The anomaly was rising from the horizion, And it looked similar to a black hole, but not quite, as the center was a bit colored, With what appeared to be a red-dwarf in the center. \"Jonathon, Can you scan into the wormhole, I think we're getting confirmation that there appears to be a system over there, Copy.\" The gravitational lensing was growing bigger by the second, As we moved toward it. \"Mhm Yep confirmation that there is indeed a planetary system over there, With a habitable planet.\"\n\nEverybody roared with excitement when the captain of the goldshine spoke those words. \"However, The wormhole is on a retrograde orbit around our same exact orbit, So we gotta decide fast if we burn into a grav slingshot or take chances.\" Everybody went quiet, And after a quick vote was reached, It was decided that 5 of our 10 ships would depart to our original planet, while 5- The Mithril, The Goldshine, The Hindustan, The UTS, And the Korodai. 2 Were colony ships, 1 Was a radar ship, And the others were assault carriers- for defending against any aliens, as unlikely as that was. \"Alright, Jonathon, Shirbi Al-Korbi, Verimont, Napole, Prepare to burn toward the anomaly at full speed.\"\n\nThe engines turned on, Emitting a very deep, Orange, Glow, While our fleet zoomed on towards the anomaly, We got a message from the commander. \"Good luck, Fleet beta. The bronzeglow here is reporting there appears to be other colony ships around orbit around the planet, most likely from a planet that shared our same fate. We estimate your chances are success are 50-90% If you get along, And well... If you don't, We're sure your chances are 0-10%. Sorry, No happy endings there. Whatever happens there... Godspeed, Fleet beta. Lets hope we meet someday.\"\n\nWe flew out of comms range, The wormhole clearly visible now. It was a near uniform sphere, And looking through it, We could find only 1 planet. It has a very large equatorial continent, With 2 large ice-caps. Ice caps. Huh, Never thought i would see those. They're very white, i suppose. Back on earth, The icecaps melted and flooded the earth, Plus with all the methane trapped under the ice, Nobody in the last 2 generations even knew what snow was. Then, We saw 3 points of light, The goldshine confirming those are the ships, With a shrapnel cloud next to them. Looks like someone had a bad day. \"10 Kilometers... 9 Kilometers... 8 Kilomet- 7 kilo- 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... BRACE FOR-\" All went silent, as we traveled through the wormhole. The inside looked strange, The walls strangely pulsating, Near-White in their color. The planet was in full-view, And it looked like we were going to drop off very near to the alien colony ships. We braced for impact with full expectations of the worse... And we were silently dropped of within space-walk distance of the alien colony ships.\n\nNothing strange, Nothing weird happened.\n\nThe \"Spark\" Decoupled with its decent pods. These very large pods contained cities within them, Which would unfold when they made planet-fall upon the surface, And found the first equestrian colonies on the new world. Well, Not colony, But you get the idea. Six decent pods Decoupled in total, And burned into a suborbital trajectory. It was agreed that the elements of harmony would have their own part, Seeing as how the continent was divided into 6 area's. The pods slammed into the atmosphere at full force, compressing the air in front of them, Causing a pretty re-entry. Eventually, After a little negotiation with the controls, Twilight landed in her area first. Followed by Rarity, Pinkie, Apple, Rainbow, And Fluttershy.\n\nThe pods, after a bit of negotiation with the controls once again, Opened up, Extended their skylines into the sky, And started automatically harvesting nearby water and food for sustenance, and the nuclear reactor (The only technology to be developed while in space, for now) Was turned on, resulting in a clean, modern city.\n\nThen the alien (human) ships appeared right next to the equestrian colony ships, And deployed their pods- Which were infact cluster-pods, Designed to split off after hitting the atmosphere and mass-colonize around a certain area. How else are you suppose to transplant almost 4 billion people onto another world? Once again, There were 6 cluster-pods, That burned into a area. Before they burned, They used sensor data from the goldshine to conclude there was enough land in the 6 area's to support each colony. When the cluster-pods separated during re-entry, The massive heat signature of the pods separating alerted the commanders of the 6 pony colonies, and when each stepped out...\n\nThere seemed like millions of fiery orange streaks in the sky.\n\n\"Jonathon, What colonies have made planetfall so far?\" I asked, As the cities unfolded. 4 cities out of our 20 had landed within viewing distance, obscured by hills, so it was quite a sight to see. \"Depends if you go by thorium reactor initiated, or dropped. If we're going by fusion reactor initiated, Congratulations, Your the only colony that has dropped and initiated so far. If we're going by landed, Then, The Iberian Franco-Saxon union, Hindustan, And Muslistan has landed. 2 colonies are yet to land, but will very shortly.\"\n\n\"Jonathon, What alien colonies have been established?\" I asked. I could clearly see a alien city over the capital, But the only thing i could see on its flag was a pale yellow. \"Well, Most, If not all of them are established. They also have compatible radio, which means if your playing geopolitics, You share a border with a... Jesus Christ if I'm getting comms right they look like... Environmental pacifists?\"\n\nBy any standards i am NOT a pacifist, But i am a environmentalist. I think that i and the colony should get along. \"Jonathon, Can you try to get a connection? I want to resolve any differences before it escalates, seeing as how i am also, a environmentalist.\" I really hoped that the other colonies would be peaceful, but until i could learn more about them, i had to be cautious. \"Well, I can't appear to get a hold on their capital. I think something is jamming them, most likely poor reactor design. However, I did get a comms request by the IFAU.\"\n\nthe Iberian Franko-Anglo union. The main superpower of the west. I think everybody agrees that everybody except America hates them. its a universal constant: Whenever a Spanish-french union occurs, everybody will hate them. \"Alright. Route the messages. Can't wait to deal with their endless alliance requests.\" After a bit of static, the flag of the IFAU Appears, A man, no more then 30, With a incredibly thick Italian accent being the one i was talking to. \"Amigoooooo! How is the american colony! must be going swell, because you landed around several geothermal deposits! Thank me later!\"\n\nDear god this guy was annoying, but i had to pull through with diplomacy. \"Yes, We will definitely thank you later. Hows it like yon your side?\" I embraced for the worse, because the IFAU has a habit of starting wars with everyone in their vicinity.\n\n\"Well, The resident alien colony in our area has been growing restless, so we've decided to jam all alien colonies and try to starve them of data.\" That sentence broke my faith for European colonies.\n\n\"You are jamming ALL Colonies? Why not just the one growing restless! THEY HAVN'T EVEN ATTACKED YOU YET! What is wrong with you? On the order of the american government, i order you to halt your jamming. Im trying to communicate with my resident alien colony and you are impeding my efforts.\"\n\nI waited for a response, Before he responded: \"You are a american colony, not america. This infraction will be punished in due time.\" In a cold, Monotone voice before he cut communications. I sighed. The IFAU's threats rarely get enforced, but if they do, they usually do so with extreme impunity. I really hope he wasn't serious. I thought about how IFAU-Alien relations would go, before Jonathon interrupted me. \"I've been able to establish communications with the alien colony. I could also hear the conversation. You handed their brains to them on a silver plate.\"\n\nI chuckled a bit before opening communications with the colony. I anticipated what would happen. Would i meet a militarist-but-peaceful colony? Would i meet a incredibly peaceful empire? Thoughts race'd through my head before a quiet, soft, female voice came through.\n\n\"H... Hello?\""
