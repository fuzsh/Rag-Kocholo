An ancient Greek colony on the Taman Peninsula at the site of present-day Sinna, Krasnodar krai, RF. It was founded in the middle of the 6th century BC by colonists from the Ionic city of Teos, and in the 5th century BC it became part of the *Bosporan Kingdom. Phanagoria flourished in the 5th to 2nd centuries and formed an independent state in the ist century BC. Its inhabitants (Sindians, Maeotians, Sarmatians, and Greeks) engaged in agriculture, animal husbandry, fishing, various crafts, and trade with neighboring tribes and Mediterranean states. In the 4th century AD the city was razed by the Huns but was rebuilt by the end of the century. It died out in the nth to 12th century. Excavations of Phanagoria began in the icth century. More systematic digs conducted in the late 19305 and after the Second World War have uncovered the ruins of palaces, houses, wells, the city walls, a gymnasium, the acropolis, and the port. Pharmacology. The science of drugs and their effect on or interaction with a living organism. In Kievan Rus' *Yevpraksiia Mstyslavna, the granddaughter of Volodymyr Monomakh, gathered information about medicaments and wrote the treatise Mazi (Salves). The preparation and administration of medicaments was largely in the hands of folk healers or sorcerers, of whom it was generally believed that they possessed magic powers (see *folk medicine). They prepared their concoctions mostly from ^medicinal plants, infrequently from animal tissues, wine, or honey, and handed down their recipes shrouded in secrecy. After the Christianization of Ukraine the preparation of drugs was taken up by monasteries. Lviv pharmacists are mentioned in chronicles as early as the 14th century. By the loth and iyth centuries handwritten books of remedies existed, called travnyky, zeleinyky, or vertohrady. The first pharmacies in Left-Bank Ukraine were founded in major cities at the beginning of the i8th century by the decree of Peter I and were government-owned or privately operated. The Ukrainian obstetrician N. *Ambodyk-Maksymovych wrote an encyclopedic treatise on medical plants that is regarded as the first pharmacological textbook in the Russian Empire (1783). By the 19th century pharmacology was being taught in medical and veterinary institutes as well as at most universities. The foundations of experimental pharmacology in Ukraine were laid by V. Dybkovsky, H. Shkavera, O. *Cherkes, and Yu. Petrovsky. After the 1917 Revolution the system of training pharmacologists resulted in the creation of related disciplines: pharmacy (the preparation and dispensation of drugs), pharmacognosy, pharmaceutical chemistry and technology, pharmacotherapy (the application of drugs in treating disease), toxicology (the study of drug poisoning), and veterinary pharmacology. Further evolution in pharmacology led to the establishment of its specialized subdivi-\n\nsions: clinical pharmacology, immunopharmacology, chemotherapy, psychopharmacology, pharmacogenetics, and molecular and biochemical pharmacology. Research is conducted at the Kharkiv Chemico-pharmaceutical Research Institute and at the Kiev Scientific Research Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology and in pharmacological laboratories at other medical and scientific research centers. The Scientific Pharmacological Society of Ukraine was founded in 1961 in Kiev and belonged to the All-Union Scientific Society of Pharmacologists. The collection Farmakolohiia i toksykolohiia is published in Kiev. The Lviv Pharmacy Museum (on Rynok Square) is one of the city's oldest museums, with an exceptionally large collection of pharmaceutical items. It is located in the three-story premises of the original pharmacy (est 1735), and its collection includes scales, mortars, crucibles, manuscripts and incunabula, herbaria, and recipe books, totaling over 2,000 items. In the diaspora, a department of pharmaceutics existed at the ^Ukrainian Technical and Husbandry Institute in Munich in 1945-51. P. Dzul Pheasant (Phasianus; Ukrainian: pantarka,fazari). Birds of the family Phasianidae that are related to the quail, partridge, peacock, and jungle fowl. Pheasants are long-tailed birds of open woodlands and fields, where they nest on the ground and lead a sedentary life. They were naturalized in Ukraine and raised for hunting as excellent game birds. They inhabit the regions of Kiev, Kherson, Mykolaiv, the Crimea, and Transcarpathia. Philadelphia. A city and port (1991 pop 1,585,000) in southeastern Pennsylvania, at the junction of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers. It has been one of the main centers of Ukrainian settlement: 28,000 of its residents claimed Ukrainian origin in 1980 but other estimates have put this figure as high as 52,740. Ukrainians from the Lemko region began to settle in Philadelphia in the i88os. Later arrivals came from Transcarpathia and then from Galicia. They were attracted to the city by jobs in locomotive plants, steelworks, sugar refineries, railway transport, and port facilities. Women worked mostly as domestic help. The earliest organized community structure in the city was a Transcarpathian congregation which established the parish of the Holy Spirit in 1891. Galician immigrants, who were displeased by the Hungarian influence in the parish, soon organized their own St Michael's parish. With the coming of Bishop S. *Ortynsky, the city developed into a religious and educational center. The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception was opened in 1908. National Prosvita conferences were held in Philadelphia in 1905 and 1909, and a network of reading rooms and Ukrainian schools was set up. The first branch of the Ukrainian National Association was es-\n\n2\n\nPHILADELPHIA\n\nUkrainian Catholic Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Philadelphia tablished in 1905, and in 1909 the Society of RuthenianAmerican Citizens was founded and housed in its own building. The Basilian order of nuns set up an orphanage in 1911. St Paul's Institute (Minor Seminary) was founded by Bishop K. Bohachevsky in 1925 (transferred to Stamford, Connecticut, 1933). The ^Providence Association of Ukrainian Catholics established its head office in Philadelphia in 1914, and the Ruthenian Bank was founded in 1915 on Ortynsky's initiative. When the Greek Catholic exarchate was divided into separate Ukrainian and Byzantine Catholic (Transcarpathian) jurisdictions in 1924, the former established its seat in Philadelphia. In 1958 it was raised to the status of a metropoly. Archbishop I. *Teodorovych moved the seat of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in the USA from Chicago to Philadelphia in 1925. During the interwar period Philadelphia's Ukrainian community developed rapidly. In October 1922 the founding conference of the United Ukrainian Organizations in America was held in Philadelphia, and until 1930 its head office was located there. In July 1936 the Ukrainian Catholic Youth League staged a Ukrainian-American Olympiad there. By 1936 there were two Ukrainian Catholic churches, one Byzantine Catholic church, one Orthodox church, six community halls, a regular parish school, a girls' secondary school (both schools run by the Basilian nuns), six evening schools of Ukrainian language and culture, four library-reading rooms, three printing presses, and over a dozen women's youth, fraternal, sports, and choral organizations. The Catholic triweekly Ameryka, the Transcarpathian weekly Rusyn, the Orthodox journal Dnipro, the Catholic monthly Misionar, and the Russophile Pravda all came out in Philadelphia. The founding of the \"Ukrainian Congress Committee of America (UCCA) took place in 1940 in Philadelphia, which also is the site of the head office of the \"\"United Ukrainian American Relief Committee since its establishment in 1944. In 1948 the *World Federation of Ukrainian Women's Organizations was founded in Philadelphia. During the postwar years almost 6,000 Ukrainian refugees settled in Philadelphia. By 1981 the number of churches had increased to ten Catholic, three Orthodox,\n\ntwo Evangelical-Baptist, and two Pentecostal. A host of new political, social, women's, veterans', professional, youth, and sports organizations appeared. The Trident sports club won six championships of the American Soccer League. Three financial institutions prospered: the Ukrainian Savings and Loan Association, the Self-Reliance Credit Union (est 1948), and the Trident Savings Association. Most of the local organizations were affiliated with the local branch of the UCCA till 1980, when the latter was split into two rival organizations. A number of national organizations had their head offices in Philadelphia, including the \"Ukrainian National Women's League of America (1943-74), the \"\"United Ukrainian War Veterans in America (1949-), the \"Ukrainian Music Institute of America (1952-9), the \"Ukrainian Patriarchal Society in the United States (1970-9), and the Saint Sophia Religious Association of Ukrainian Catholics (1977-). The main research and educational institutions in Philadelphia include \"Manor Junior College (est 1947), the Ukrainian Art Studio (est 1952), the *Lypynsky East European Research Institute (est 1963), and a branch of the Ukrainian Catholic University (est 1977). The Ukrainian Educational and Cultural Center was established in 1980 to provide physical facilities for a wide range of community activities. It services over 40 organizations, including Saturday school, performing ensembles, professional groups, and youth organizations. In 1982 the UNR government-in-exile moved its head office to Philadelphia. The city was home to the \"Ukrainian Theater in Philadelphia (1949-57) and Teatr u Piatnytsiu (until 1974) under the direction of V. Blavatsky and V. Shasharovsky. In 1953 the Kobzar chorus, conducted by A. Rudnytsky, was founded. In the 19705 it was succeeded by the Prometheus chorus, under M. Dliaboha. A Ukrainian radio program has served the local community since 1939, followed by Blavatsky's Radio Hour (1951-), Holos Myrian (1971-), and the Ukrainian Hour (1973-). Publications coming out of Philadelphia in the postwar period include the daily (since 1950) Ameryka, Misionar, and literary magazine Kyïv (1950-64); the quarterly Ukraïns'ka knyha (1971-82); the women's monthly Nashe zhyttia (1944-74); the Catholic weekly Shliakh - The Way (1940-); and the art magazine Notatky z mystetstva (1963-). Since the beginning of the century Philadelphia has been an important Ukrainian publishing center. Economic prosperity has enabled Ukrainians to move to residential areas in the suburbs. A few old community centers have survived in the inner city, most notably the Catholic community in the Franklin Street vicinity. It encompasses a new cathedral designed by Yu. Yastremsky, several religious institutions, and a senior citizen's home.

The society was founded in 1898 on the initiative of Gen M. Fedorovsky. It was headed first by D. *Mordovets, then by O. *Rusov, and later by P. *Stebnytsky, who initially, together with O. *Lototsky, conducted all of the society's activities. Among its members were hundreds of Ukrainians from various provinces. By 1917 the society had published 80 popular Ukrainian brochures (more than a million copies) on agriculture, hygiene, and, particularly, history. In 1904-5 the society addressed petitions to the supreme imperial institutions demanding the annulment of restrictions on Ukrainian publishing. Together with the auxiliary Shevchenko Society in St Petersburg, the society published the first complete edition of T. Shevchenko's *Kobzar in 1907. Philately. See Ukraine-Philatelisten Verband, Ukrainian Philatelic and Numismatic Society, and Postage stamps. Philipps, Tracy, b November 1890 in the United Kingdom, d 21 July 1959 in London. Journalist and international affairs expert. Educated at Oxford and Durham universities, Philipps was an enigmatic figure with connections to the British intelligence community. In addition to holding postings in East Africa and the Near East, he served as the British relief commissioner in Ukraine in 1921. Between the two world wars he was a foreign newspaper correspondent specializing in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. He came into contact with V. *KayeKysilewsky in London during the 19305, and in 1940 went to Canada, where he played an important role (together with Kaye-Kysilewsky and G. *Simpson) in establishing the ^Ukrainian Canadian Committee (now Congress). In 1941-3 he was an adviser to the Canadian Department of War Services on European immigrant communities and their role in war industry. He was chief of planning, resettlement of displaced persons, United Nations Administration, in Washington and Germany in 1944-5. For a time (from 1939) he was married to L. *Kolessa, the daughter of O. *Kolessa. His writings included monographs and articles on zoology, Islam, ethnology, international affairs, and refugee and minority problems. Philosophy. An intellectual discipline (literally, love of wisdom7 in classical Greek) that, in the course of its history, has been variously defined as the study of the basic principles of being, the testing of the foundations of knowledge, the general guide to the good life, the analysis of basic scientific concepts and methods, and the examination of certain concepts of ordinary language. Unlike the specialized sciences, it does not have its own subject matter or distinctive method. Hence, only a vague definition, such as 'the critical and systematic reflection on questions of the greatest concern to man/ may be broad enough to cover the various forms assumed by philosophy. Because it was adopted from other cultures to address certain pressing political or religious needs, philosophy in Ukraine has been preoccupied with practical rather than theoretical problems. The political calamities and attendant cultural disruptions in Ukraine's history account to a large extent for the lack of durable philosophical tradition in Ukraine and for the absence of a distinctively Ukrainian system or worldview. For this reason some important Ukrainian thinkers (eg, H. *Skovoroda) have been assigned mistakenly to Russia's more stable philosophical\n\n3\n\nculture; others (P. *Yurkevych, V. *Lesevych) did in fact work in a non-Ukrainian tradition. Lacking its own philosophical literature and institutions, Ukrainian culture could be considered to have been incomplete during some periods of its development. At such times writers and poets rather than philosophers were the propagators of philosophical ideas and theories among the Ukrainian public. Medieval period. The period from the adoption of Eastern Christianity to the Mongol invasion (ioth-i3th centuries) was marked by vigorous intellectual development. The assimilation of Byzantine culture was not passive, but an active rethinking that gave rise to original speculation. Because of a common literary language and alphabet, the work of Bulgarian translators and thinkers was readily transferable to Rus'. The ideas of Greek philosophers and the Church Fathers entered Rus' through Bulgarian translations of Greek collections or original Bulgarian compilations, including the *lzbornik of Sviatoslav (1073), Zlatostrui, Pchela (The Bee), the chronicles of John Malalas and Georgios Hamartolos, the Lives of SS Cyril and Methodius, the Hexaemeron of Exarch John of Bulgaria, The Source of Knowledge of St John of Damascus, and apocrypha. The new, imported ideas, which themselves were not systematized and were often opposed, did not displace old popular beliefs, but were set alongside them. Thus, many conflicting answers to the same basic questions were found in different and even the same sources. Neither a single dogmatic scheme not a unified worldview was worked out. Since political motives played a decisive role in the religious conversion of Rus', the emergent philosophical thought was focused on political rather than religious questions. Authors of the first original works produced in Rus' were not concerned much with personal salvation or the defense of Christian doctrine, but with a higher justification of the political order. Metropolitan Ilarion's *Slovo o zakoni i blahodati (Sermon on Law and Grace), the finest theoretical work written in Rus', shows how the Christianization of Rus' is the fulfillment of universal history. Grand Prince Volodymyr Monomakh's *Pouchenie ditiam (Instruction for [My] Children) and the Rus' chronicles portray the ideal prince, a combination of the pagan warrior and the fatherly Christian ruler. Besides these works, the sermons of Bishop Cyril of Turiv, the letters of Metropolitan Klym Smoliatych (reputedly the best philosopher in Rus'), and the writings of Nestor the Chronicler contain philosophical ideas, but fall far short of the kind of articulated, systematic thinking characteristic of scholasticism. The worldview expressed in the literature and folklore of Rus' was practical, optimistic, and life-asserting. The Church Fathers' Christian Neoplatonism reinforced the sense of divine presence in the world and the expectation of happiness in this life that were characteristic of the earlier pagan outlook. The sharp opposition between God and nature, as well as the spirit and the body, and its attendant rejection of the joys of this world was confined to a relatively narrow class of ascetic works. The Mongol invasion of the mid-i3th century began a long period of political turmoil and cultural decline in Rus'. For almost three centuries nothing significant was added to the Kievan intellectual heritage. As a mood of historical pessimism set in, people turned to religion and mysticism for comfort. In the mid-i4th century Hesy-\n\n4\n\nPHILOSOPHY\n\nchasm, a form of monastic mysticism, spread from Bulgaria to Ukraine, and in the i^th century a rationalist sect of *Judaizers appeared in Kiev. Renaissance period. Philosophical ideas and methods of argument gained a new importance in the period of religious struggle in Europe. At the end of the 15th century the ideas of ^humanism were brought to Ukraine by foreign travelers and by Ukrainians studying at foreign universities. The ^Reformation, which was carried into Galicia and Volhynia by rationalist sects, such as the *Socinians, was very different in origin and purpose from the humanist movement, yet their programs coincided and reinforced each other on many points: the extension of education and learning, the use of the vernacular, the right to individual opinion, and the need to return to the original sources and to reassess critically the traditions built on them. Protestant anticlericalism, public-mindedness, and national awareness had an important influence on the church ^brotherhoods in Ukraine. Although these two movements contributed to the cultural revival in Ukraine, it was the Counter-Reformation spearheaded by the ^Jesuits that threatened the very existence of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian culture and aroused the Ukrainian Orthodox nobility and burghers to vigorous organized action. At first the Orthodox adopted a defensive strategy: they turned inward toward their own Greco-Slavonic tradition and rejected anything belonging to the Latin-Polish tradition. Returning to the roots of their culture, they revived the use of Greek and Church Slavonic, translated the Bible, and studied patristic theology. The achievements of the Catholic West scholastic theology, philosophy, and logic - were viewed with suspicion as a devilish ploy to lure believers away from the true faith. New institutions were set up toward the end of the loth century to carry out this program: the Ostrih cultural center, consisting of the Ostrih Academy Press, a learned circle, and a string of brotherhoods modeled on the Lviv Dormition Brotherhood. The leading Orthodox proponents were I. *Vyshensky, V. Surazky, Kh. Filalet, H. Smotrytsky, Ostrozkyi Kliryk, Z. Kopystensky, K. Stavrovetsky, I. Kopynsky, and Y. Boretsky. To them philosophy was part of theology, and most of their ideas were derived from the same sources on which medieval thinkers had drawn - Pseudo-Dionysius, St John Chrysostom, St John of Damascus, and Exarch John of Bulgaria (see ^Polemical literature). This defensive strategy led to isolation from the larger society and from the dominant culture. Withdrawal from this world for the sake of another world did not appeal to the upper classes of the nobility, clergy, and burghers, who continued to drift away from the Orthodox faith and culture. The Orthodox countered by proposing to study and assimilate the tools (Latin, Polish, rhetoric, and logic) and ideas (scholasticism) of their rivals. This was a dangerous policy, for it diminished the differences between the competing cultures, but it was the only policy that offered some hope of success. The turn to scholasticism was a return to an outlived intellectual tradition, but it created the preconditions for the separation of philosophy from theology and the introduction of modern ideas into Ukraine. The chief proponents of the new strategy were M. Smotrytsky, K. *Sakovych, L. Zyzanii, and P. Mohyla. The Kievan Mohyla College (later Academy) was the leading institution to carry out this program.\n\nIn spite of royal prohibition, philosophy began to be taught at the Kievan Cave Monastery School (1631), and the practice was continued when the school was reorganized into the Kievan Mohyla College, later Academy (1632-1817). The philosophy courses, read in Latin, usually required three years and covered three main fields, logic, physics (natural philosophy), and metaphysics. Each instructor prepared his own course; hence, the courses differed significantly in content and style. Some of the professors who offered philosophy courses at the academy were Y. *Kononovych-Horbatsky (1639-42), I. *Gizel (1645-7), Y. *Krokovsky (1686-7), S. *Yavorsky (1691-3), I. Popovsky (1699), Y. Turoboisky (1702-4), Kh. Charnutsky (1704-5), T. *Prokopovych (1707-8), Y. Volchansky (171518), I. Levytsky (1723-5), I. Dubnevych (1725-6), A. *Dubnevych (1727-8), S. Kalynovsky (1729-30), S. Kuliabka (1735-9), M. *Kozachynsky (1741-5), H. *Konysky (1749), T. *Shcherbatsky (1751-3), and D. *Nashchynsky (1753-5). The general character of these courses was syncretic the result of blending elements of Christian Neoplatonism with Aristotelian doctrines. The academy's professors drew ideas freely from the ancient philosophers (mostly Aristotle and Plato, but also the Stoics and Ptolemy), the patristic tradition (Origen, St Basil the Great, St Augustine, Pseudo-Dionysius), medieval scholasticism (Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, J. Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham), and neoscholasticism (T. Cajetan, F. Suárez, P. Fonseca, L. de Molina, R. de Arriaga, and F. de Oviedo). They often criticized Thomas Aquinas, using the arguments of his scholastic opponents. Aristotle was quoted more than any other thinker but was not treated as an infallible authority. The logic course, which consisted of an introductory part called dialectic or minor logic and a more sophisticated part called major logic, was based on Aristotle's Organon and supplemented with refinements introduced by scholastic logicians. On the central problem discussed in logic - universals - the academy's professors rejected Platonism and accepted some version of Aristotelian realism. In natural philosophy they adopted Aristotelian hylomorphism, but tended to stress the ontological primacy of prime matter over form. Shcherbatsky was the first to proffer the Cartesian concept of matter instead of Aristotle's. While accepting creation the Kiev thinkers tended to minimize God's subsequent intervention in the natural world. This deis tic tendency contrasted sharply with their Neoplatonist metaphysics, which emphasized God's immanence in nature. A growing interest in modern science and philosophy is evident in their discussion of Copernican, Galilean, and Cartesian theories (Shcherbatsky first adopted the heliocentric theory and Descartes's vortex theory) and the rejection of Aristotle's distinction between celestial and sublunar bodies (Prokopovych, Kozachynsky, Konysky, Shcherbatsky). Some added ethics treatises to their courses (Prokopovych, Kalynovsky, Kuliabka, Kozachynsky, Konysky, Shcherbatsky). They tended to reject a narrow, ascetic view of life and to assert the desirability of happiness in this as well as the next life and its attainability in an active, rationally governed life. In style the courses looked much like scholastic treatises: the chief problems of philosophy were discussed one by one by proposing a thesis, listing objections, and replying to the objections. Modern period. During the second half of the i8th century the Kievan Mohyla Academy and the colleges in\n\nPHILOSOPHY\n\nChernihiv, Pereiaslav, and Kharkiv were gradually reduced to mere seminaries. At the beginning of the 17605 the Kiev metropolitan ordered philosophy at the academy to be taught according to C. Baumeister's texts based on C. Wolffs system, and thus discouraged any individual originality and intellectual independence. Ukraine's loss of the last vestiges of political autonomy under Catherine II and its swift cultural decline account for the weak impression that the Enlightenment made on Ukrainian thought. Without royal encouragement or interest and without vigorous institutions of higher learning independent of church control, the Enlightenment could not grow into a full-fledged movement. It is represented by a few individual thinkers, such as Ya. *Kozelsky, P. *Lodii, I. *Rizhsky, and J. *Schad, and propagandists, such as V. *Karazyn, H. *Vynsky, O. Palytsyn, and V. Kapnist. A conservative form of Enlightenment based on G. Leibniz's and C. Wolffs ideas was propagated by the higher schools; the more radical form articulated by F. Voltaire, J.-J. Rousseau, D. Diderot, C.-A. Helvétius, P.-H. Holbach, and Montesquieu was cultivated and propagated by small circles of educated nobles. Some Ukrainians (H. *Kozytsky, S. *Desnytsky, Kozelsky, I. Vanslov, Ya. Kostensky, H. *Poletyka, V. Ruban, and I. Tumansky) belonged to a society in St Petersburg (1768-83) that translated and published books by several French thinkers. ^Kantianism was propagated by the German thinker L. Jacob, who was a professor at Kharkiv University (1807-9), and by Rev V. Dovhovych, a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest. Kanfs moral theory made a strong impression on Schad. Grounding a doctrine of natural rights in an ahistorical concept of human nature, the enlightened thinkers proposed to realize these rights (to individual freedom, equality before the law, and enjoyment of property) by restructuring society. All of them were opposed to serfdom, but apart from Kozelsky and Karazyn they urged the restriction of landowners' rights rather than abolition. Karazyn and Lodii preferred constitutional monarchy while Kozelsky preferred a republic. Following Rousseau, Kozelsky advocated not merely equality before the law, but limits to economic disparity. All of them believed in peaceful social reform through education and the moral improvement of the monarch and small elite. Karazyn pointed also to the importance of scientific and technological development for social progress. In its practical (moral and social) consequences the philosophy of H. *Skovoroda is very close to the teachings of the Philosophes, although it has no direct tie with the Enlightenment. It is rooted not in the new natural sciences, but in the humanist tradition going back to the ancient philosophers and in Christian Neoplatonism. In his writings Skovoroda denounced the injustice and exploitation he observed around him, and in practice he renounced this society by turning down a career in the church. His ideal society, which can be realized only by individual moral rebirth, is based on the fulfillment of each member's inner nature. In this context equality is the full (hence equal) realization by all individuals of their unequal potentialities. A number of Ukrainians played an important role in the growth of mysticism in the 18th-century Russian Empire. This trend of thought paved the way for the Romantic worldview and German idealism.\n\n5\n\nThe development of Ukrainian culture, particularly literature and art, in the icth century was influenced decisively by German ^romanticism. The Romantic outlook attained its fullest philosophical expression in the German idealists - J. Fichte, F. *Schelling, and G. Hegel - and it was those thinkers who had a determining influence on philosophical thought in Ukraine during the first half of the 19th century. Fichte's ideas were introduced at Kharkiv University by J. Schad (1804) and were spread to other educational institutions by his students. The first translation of Fichte was done at Kharkiv by one of Schad's students in 1813. Schad also acquainted his students with some of Schelling's doctrines, and his successor to the university's chair of philosophy, A. Dudrovych (1818-30), absorbed Schelling's mystical spirit and taught Schellingian psychology. J. Kroneberg, who taught classical philosophy at Kharkiv University (1819-37), attempted to construct his own esthetic theory using Schelling's ideas. M. *Maksymovych, the first rector of Kiev University, formulated his ideas on nature under the impact of Schelling's and L. Oken's doctrines and was inspired in his later ethnographic work by Schelling's views. K. Zelenetsky, who tried to reconcile Schelling and Kant, and N. Kurliandtsev, who translated Schelling and H. Steffens, taught at the Richelieu Lyceum in Odessa in the first half of the century. P. Arsenev followed C. Carus in his psychology lectures at the Kiev Theological Academy and Kiev University in the 18405 and probably had some influence on the Cyril and Methodius Brotherhood. But the most influential German thinker was Hegel, whose system encompassed all the diverse trends within romanticism (moral, religious, esthetic) and subsumed them all under reason. Hegel's historicism and dialectic made a strong impression on O. *Novytsky, O. *Mykhnevych, and S. *Hohotsky. They not only adopted some of his ideas but also tried to apply his methods of interpretation. Hegel's theory of history influenced a number of historians, such as M. Lunin, who in turn influenced M. Kostomarov, and P. Pavlov, some literary historians such as A. Metlynsky and M. Kostyr, and the philosopher of law P. Redkyn (see *Hegelianism). The Christian Romantic ideology of the *Cyril and Methodius Brotherhood is the finest example of a creative response by young Ukrainian intellectuals to new ideas from the West. As expressed in the *Knyhy bytiia ukraïns 'koho narodu (The Books of the Genesis of the Ukrainian People), their theory was a mixture of Enlightenment political ideals (equality, democracy, parliamentarism), pietist sentiment, and Romantic notions of historical providentialism and national messianism. A religiously colored faith in Ukraine's mission to unite the Slavs in a federation of free national republics inspired the writings of the leading Ukrainian writers of the mid-century and stimulated the growth of national consciousness. As the prestige of the natural sciences rose, the Romantic Weltanschauung lost its credibility. But the ambition to unify all human experience in one all-embracing philosophical system remained strong throughout the second half of the century. P. *Yurkevych, probably the sharpest philosophical mind in Ukraine at the time, set out to reconcile idealism and materialism. Although he did not complete this project, his critique of materialism, interpretation of Platonism, and suggestions for an integrated concept of human nature were promising beginnings. A\n\n6\n\nPHILOSOPHY\n\nunified metaphysical system was worked out by A. Kozlov, who taught at Kiev University from 1876. Influenced by Leibniz, I. Kant, and A. Schopenhauer, he proposed a theory of critical spiritualism that admitted a multiplicity of spirits and denied the reality of matter. A similar system of 'synechiological spiritualism' was proposed later by A. *Giliarov, who viewed the universe as an infinite hierarchy of organisms. Positivism was more popular among scientists than among philosophers in Ukraine. A Ukrainian positivist of particular note was V. *Lesevych. He accepted A. Comte's teachings at first, but later rejected them in favor of a stricter empiricism and worked out his own theory of knowledge, which was close to empiriocriticism. Some positivist ideas can be found in G. Chelpanov, who taught philosophy at Kiev University (1892-1906), P. *Linytsky, and N. Grot, who began his academic career at the Nizhen Lyceum and Odessa University (1883-6). All of them tried to make room for religious faith without weakening the authority of science. Following Kant they drew a clear line between knowledge and faith; they restricted the first to the realm of phenomena and accounted for it in empiriocritical terms. M. *Drahomanov developed his political and social theory in a positivist framework. The sociologist M. *Kovalevsky was influenced strongly by A. Comte, while B. *Kistiakovsky worked out a neo-Kantian foundation for the social sciences. F. *Zelenohorsky of Kharkiv University emphasized the importance of the inductive method without denying the role of deduction and imagination in scientific knowledge. *O. Potebnia's and D. *Ovsianiko-Kulikovsky's philosophy of language was based on associationist psychology. After the First World War philosophy developed very differently in Western Ukraine under Polish rule, in Soviet Ukraine under the stifling restrictions of official ideology, and among Ukrainian émigrés. Denied their own university by the Polish authorities, Galicia's Ukrainians were unable to compete with the Poles in the quality of philosophical education and writing. Some philosophy was taught at the Lviv (Underground) Ukrainian University (eg, by S. *Balei) and at the Greek Catholic Theological Academy by Rev Y. *Slipy (scholasticism), M. *Konrad (ancient philosophy), and H. *Kostelnyk (epistemology). The Western Ukrainian and émigré proponents of different political ideologies, such as ^conservatism, integral ^nationalism, ^socialism, and ^Marxism, discussed, with varying sophistication and objectivity, the philosophical grounds of their outlook. Soviet period. In Soviet Ukraine, for the first few years philosophical activity developed in a normal way: philosophers expressed their views freely, formed associations, and published their own journals. In 1922 the government dismissed some of its ideological opponents from their academic posts and banished them from the Ukrainian SSR, thus warning intellectual circles that it would no longer tolerate criticism of the official ideology. Gradually the regime imposed its control over ideas by dissolving all independent associations and publications and by establishing its own institutions for defining and propagating the approved ideology, ^Marxism-Leninism. As political interference increased, philosophical debate degenerated quickly into servile dogmatism, invective, and denunciation. By 1931 all creative thinking on philosophical issues had been stifled.\n\nThe first philosophical institution in Ukraine set up by the Soviet regime was the Department of Marxism and Marxology in Kharkiv. It was established in the fall of 1921, and a year later it was reorganized into the Ukrainian Institute of Marxism, renamed the \"Ukrainian Institute of Marxism-Leninism (UIML) in 1927. The institute had three divisions, each with three departments. The Philosophy-Sociology Division (chaired by S. *Semkovsky) consisted of the departments of Philosophy (headed by Semkovsky), Sociology (headed by V. *Yurynets), and, from 1928, Law (headed by Yu. Mazurenko). Members of the philosophy department included Ya. Bilyk, Z. Luzina, P. Demchuk, and T. Stepovy, who also lectured at other institutions in Kharkiv. Philosophical research was published in the institute's journal Prapor marksyzmu (192730). In 1927 the Ukrainian Society of Militant Materialists (later of Militant Materialists-Dialecticians) was organized at the institute. At the same time (from 1921) two departments of the Social-Economic Division of the YUAN - those of the History of Philosophy and Law (headed by A. *Giliarov) and Sociology (headed by S. Semkovsky) - functioned in Kiev. In 1931 they were replaced by the YUAN Philosophical Commission in Kharkiv, which was to prepare a philosophical dictionary. In 1926 the Kiev Scientific Research Department of Marxism-Leninism (headed by R. Levik and then O. Kamyshan) was set up under the YUAN. Its philosophical-sociological section (chaired by S. Semkovsky) formed special commissions devoted to scientific methodology, historical materialism, the sociology of law, the sociology of art, the methodology of the history of technology, and atheism. Leading associates of the department were V. Asmus, Ya. Rozanov, M. Perlin, O. Zahorulko, M. Nyrchuk, and V. Yurynets. In 1930 the department was turned into the Kiev branch of the UIML. The UIML and the YUAN departments had two chief tasks: to articulate and propagate Marxism-Leninism and to train political specialists and propagandists for work in higher educational institutions. Besides translating the basic works of K. Marx, F. Engels, and V. Lenin and preparing anthologies and textbooks, their associates conducted prolonged discussions on the nature of philosophy, the place of the Hegelian dialectic in the physical world and the natural sciences, and the weight of Lenin's contribution to philosophy. Since dialectical materialism claimed to be both a scientific theory and a method of studying reality, its relation to the natural sciences and, particularly, the new theories of relativity and quantum mechanics aroused much interest (see ^Philosophy of science). The third branch of philosophy to receive some attention was the history of philosophy, which was limited to the philosophical traditions from which Marxism-Leninism had sprung: B. Spinoza and the French materialists, Hegel and L. Feuerbach among the German philosophers, and N. Chernyshevsky, L. Tolstoi, and G. Plekhanov among the Russians. In 1930 P. Demchuk's book on Spinoza and V. Bon's book on 18th-century French materialism came out. Hegel's Science of Logic was translated in 1929. Although the philosophy department at the UIML had a special commission for the history of philosophy in Ukraine (chaired by S. Semkovsky), little was accomplished in this area. Only a collection of articles on H. Skovoroda (1923), some booklets, and a solid monograph on him by D. Bahalii (1926) were published. The so-called philosophical discussion in Ukraine cul-\n\nPHILOSOPHY minated at a conference in Kharkiv in January 1931, where accusations of nationalism, mechanism, and Menshevik idealism were directed at the leading figures of the philosophical establishment. Despite the absurdity of the charges, everyone admitted his 'errors' in a published self-criticism. The Party was thus able to call for a reorganization of the institutional system of research and the eradication of the vestiges of ^bourgeois science/ In June 1931 the UIML was converted by Party decree into the * AllUkrainian Association of Marxist-Leninist Scientific Research Institutes (VUAMLIN). The UIML's three divisions were turned into three VUAMLIN institutes - Philosophy and Natural Science, Economics, and History - of the six that were created. Each institute had a three-year graduate program. The Institute of Philosophy and Natural Science (directed by R. Levik and then O. Vasileva, and A. Saradzhev) was divided into four sectors: dialectical materialism (including a section on the history of philosophy in Ukraine), historical materialism, natural science (with the Association of Natural Science), and antireligion. It published the journals *Prapor marksyzmu-leninizmu (1931-3), Pid markso-lenins 'kym praporom (1934-6), and Za marksysts'ko-lenins'ke pryrodoznavstvo (1932-3). Among its leading associates were S. Semkovsky, V. Yurynets, T. Stepovy, O. Bervytsky, Ya. Bilyk, and V. Bon. So-called Red Professors institutes (est 1932) assumed the responsibility of training research and teaching cadres within each of the VUAMLIN institutes. At the Philosophy Institute of Red Professors (directed by S. Bludov and then O. Adrianov), V. Yurynets held the chair of dialectical materialism, T. Stepovy the chair of historical materialism, and O. Bervytsky the chair of the history of philosophy. In 1936 the separate institutes were merged into one Institute of Red Professors, with six departments. The philosophy department was chaired by A. Saradzhev and then Yu. Olman and M. Yushmanov. Philosophical research at the VUAMLIN had been long extinct by the time it was abolished in 1937. Many of the aforementioned leading thinkers perished in the terror of the 19305. After the Second World War research and teaching continued to be assigned to two distinct types of institution: research to institutes, and teaching to higher educational institutions, including universities. In 1946 the AN URSR (now ANU) \"Institute of Philosophy was established in Kiev. It published Naukovi zapysky Instytutu filosofiï (195161, 7 vols) and the bimonthly Filosofs 'ka dumka (est 1969), which in 1989 became the monthly Filosofs 'ka i sotsiolohichna dumka. Another research body - the Department of Philosophy of the AN URSR Presidium - was established in early 1950. It was headed by M. *Omelianovsky and then M. Ovander and I. Holovakha. Since any new work in dialectical and historical materialism was ruled out by Stalin's treatment of the topic in the offical short course on the history of the Bolshevik party (1938), and since the methodology of the natural and social sciences remained an uncharted mine field, the history of philosophy in Ukraine became the most promising area in philosophy. A few monographs and numerous articles on the philosophical ideas of 19th-century scientists (M. Maksymovych, V. Danylevsky, and I. Mechnikov) and the so-called Russian and Ukrainian revolutionary democrats (A. Herzen, N. Chernyshevsky, N. Dobroliubov, D. Pisarev, T. Shevchenko, P. Myrny, I. Franko, M. Pavlyk, O. Terletsky, P. Hrabovsky, Lesia Ukrainka, and M. Kotsiubynsky) ap-\n\n7\n\npeared. In a crude and obvious manner their authors imposed a predictable interpretation on their subject: materialist, atheist, or social revolutionary. In the 19505 some work, which was equally tendentious, was done also on i7th- and 18th-century writers, such as I. Vyshensky, L. Baranovych, H. Skovoroda, and Ya. Kozelsky. Such studies proliferated in the 19605; a collection of articles on the history of Ukrainian philosophy came out almost every year. The most important accomplishment of the period was the publication in 1961 of the first full and scholarly collection of Skovoroda's work. The Latin transcripts of philosophy courses taught at the Kievan Mohyla Academy began to be studied and translated, and excerpts appeared regularly in Filosofs'ka dumka. A Ukrainian translation of T. Prokopovych's courses was readied for publication, but appeared more than a decade later, in 1979-81. On the 25Oth anniversary of H. Skovoroda's birth a second, improved edition of his works (2 vols, 1973), a new biography by L. Makhnovets (1972), and several collections of articles on Skovoroda came out. The more important contributors in the field of Ukrainian philosophy were I. Ivano, D. *Ostrianyn, V. Dmytrychenko, A. *Brahinets, I. *Tabachnikov, V. Horsky, P. Manzenko, M. Rohovych, V. Yevdokymenko, and V. *Shynkaruk. A wave of arrests throughout Ukraine in January 1972 launched a concerted campaign to suppress Ukrainian culture and language. At mid-year the Institute of Philosophy was purged: two of its associates, V. *Lisovy and Ye. *Proniuk, were imprisoned for criticizing the Party's policy, and a number of junior researchers and graduate students were expelled. The number and quality of the institute's publications declined: hardly anything was printed in Ukrainian, and the Ukrainian accomplishments had to be described as accomplishments of the three 'fraternal' (Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian) peoples. The pace of publication picked up only in the 19805. V. Nichyk's monograph on the philosophical tradition at the Kievan Mohyla Academy (1978) was followed by a series of related studies by Ya. Stratii (1981), I. Zakhara (1982), I. Paslavsky (1984), and V. Lytvynov (1984), and a catalogue of surviving transcripts of the rhetoric and philosophy courses at the academy (1982). The scope of research was broadened to include the medieval era, on which several collections of articles appeared (1983, 1987, 1988, 1990). Before his untimely death, Ivano finished his survey history of esthetics in Ukraine (1981) and his notable study of Skovoroda's thought (1983). Volumes i and 2 of the ANU multiauthor three-volume history of philosophy in Ukraine were published in 1987. The most significant recent achievement has been the publication of primary sources of Ukrainian thought of the i6th to i8th centuries in Standard Ukrainian translation: ethics courses at the Kievan Mohyla Academy (1987), the works of professors of brotherhood schools (1988), and H. Konysky's (1990) and S. Yavorsky's (1992) philosophy courses at the academy. Among the leading scholars in the field today are V. *Nichyk, M. Kashuba, V. Horsky, Ya. *Stratii, I. *Zakhara, V. *Lytvynov, I. Paslavsky, M. Luk, and A. *Pashuk. Since 1972 the \"Ukrainian Philosophical Society has promoted and co-ordinated philosophical studies in Ukraine. Outside Ukraine. In the interwar period philosophy was taught in Prague at the Ukrainian Higher Pedagogical\n\n8\n\nPHILOSOPHY\n\nInstitute, at which the Skovoroda Philosophical Society (1925-30) was active, and at the Ukrainian Free University (uvu) by D. *Chyzhevsky, who established himself as the leading authority on the history of Ukrainian philosophy with his two monographs on philosophy in Ukraine, two books on Skovoroda, and a study of Hegel's influence in the Russian Empire. I. *Mirchuk, a historian of Ukrainian culture and philosophy, began his academic career at the uvu. M. *Shlemkevych, who completed his PH D under M. Schlick in Vienna, developed a philosophical genre of journalism dealing with fundamental psychological-cultural problems of Ukrainian society. After the Second World War Mirchuk continued his work on the history of philosophy. Some contributions were made by his colleagues at the uvu in Munich O. *Kulchytsky and V. *Yaniv. K. Mytrovych, a specialist in contemporary existentialism, has done some work on Skovoroda. Ye. Lashchyk, a professor of philosophy in the United States, has worked on V. Vynnychenko's 'concordism/ Among Ukrainian émigré scholars who have gained a world reputation are G. *Malantschuk, for his work on S. Kierkegaard's thought, and R. *Rozdolsky, for his interpretation of Marx's Das Kapital. (For recent work in other fields of philosophy, see \"Logic, *Marxism-Leninism, and ^Philosophy of science).

A branch of philosophy dealing with the distinctive nature of scientific knowledge - its logical structure, its relation to experience, and its growth. Formerly discussed among more general problems of epistemology, these questions received increasing attention in the 19th century and are accepted today as a separate field of philosophy. In Ukraine the first contributions to the subject were made by scientists rather than philosophers. V. *Vernadsky tried to define the key features of science in his extended article on the scientific worldview (1902), and B. *Lichkov discussed the fundamental issues of the field in his books in Russian on the limits of knowledge in the natural sciences (1914) and on description and explanation in science (1919). During the early period of the Soviet regime, philosophers tried to define the relation of the new official ideology, ^Marxism-Leninism, to the natural sciences instead of exploring the nature of scientific knowledge for its own sake. Nevertheless, many questions that belong to the philosophy of science were discussed, and some variety of views was tolerated until the early 19305. In the 19205 a special commission on scientific methodology was set up within the philosophy department of the ^Ukrainian Institute of Marxism-Leninism in Kharkiv to study the implications of dialectical materialism for the natural sciences. Besides the philosophers S. Semkovsky (chairman), V. Berkovych, P. Biliarchyk, P. Demchuk, V. Yurynets, T. Stepovy, R. Levik, and V. Chuchmarov, the commission's membership included prominent scientists, such as I. Sokoliansky, D. Tretiakov, O. Korshykov, A. Palladin, L. Pysarzhevsky, O. Goldman, D. Syntsov, and D. Grave. In Kiev a special commission on scientific methodology was set up within the VUAN Scientific Research Department of Marxism-Leninism in 1926. The All-Union Conference on the Philosophical Problems of Science in 1958 marked a turning point in the history of the subject: by condemning the imposition of ideological dogma on science, it permitted the philosophy of science to develop independently of dialectical materialism. In 1962 a new Department for the Logic of Scientific Knowledge was set up at the AN URSR (now ANU) Institute of Philosophy. First chaired (1962-6) by the institute's director, P. *Kopnin, the department soon became one of the largest and most productive sections of the institute. Its first two collections of articles on logic and the methodology of science (ed P. Dyshlevy, 1964; ed M. Omelianovsky, 1967) and the multiauthor monograph on the logic of scientific research (ed P. Kopnin, 1965) outlined the depart-\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY\n\nment7s research program. The nature of scientific theory has been analyzed in a multiauthor monograph (ed P. Dyshlevy, 1965) and in individual monographs by P. Kopnin (1963), M. Popovych (1966, 1971), V. Ryzhko (1975), V. Kuznetsov (1977), and V. Khramova (1984). The distinctive character of scientific explanation has been defined by M. Rozhenko (1970), E. Bystrytsky (1986), and N. Depenchuk, P. Dyshlevy, and N. Kyvenko (1981). Books by M. Vilnytsky (1965), P. Dyshlevy (ed, 1966), V. Khramova (1974), and V. Kyzyma (1976) dealt with the nature of scientific experiment and its role in theory confirmation. The problem of scientific discovery and growth has been discussed in a book by S. Krymsky (1974) and a collection of articles edited by M. Popovych (1983). The influence of general philosophical ideas in science has been explored by V. Chornovolenko (1970), S. Krymsky and V. Kuznetsov (1983), and L. Ozadovska (1989), and the problem of values in science has been approached from different perspectives by V. Zahorodnyk (1984), P. Yolon, S. Krymsky, and B. Parakhonsky (1989), and M. Burgin and V. Kuznetsov (1991). A number of collections have been devoted to the special methodological problems of biology (1966, 1968, 1970) and ecology (1974). In the 19605 many of the collections and monographs in the philosophy of science came out in Ukrainian. Since the abrupt change in policy at the beginning of the 19705, all of the department's publications have been published only in Russian. Thus, in spite of its USSR-wide reputation as a leading philosophy of science center, except for a few individuals among its members, the department stands strangely aloof and alienated from Ukrainian intellectual life.

In 1841, four years after the invention of the daguerreotype, Professor J. Gleister began making daguerreotypes in Lviv. In Kiev the first daguerreotype portraits were made in December 1844 or in early 1845 by a Prussian, K. Shchodrovitsky. In 1858 in Odessa, Y. Mihursky, a graduate of the Richelieu Lyceum and a member of the Parisian photographic society, tried to form a society of amateur photographers but was unable to do so because of the opposition of Governor-General A. Stroganov. In 1863, however, he managed to establish an institute of photography, where he taught the theory and practice of the art. In 1859 O. Pokorsky-Zhoravko, a noble from Mglin, Chernihiv gubernia, and the Kievan photographer Chekhovych tried unsuccessfully to launch a\n\n9\n\nphotography journal in Kiev. In 1852-3 the Englishman }. Bourne was invited to photograph the new bridge in Kiev. The 13 large prints he produced were the first calotypes made in Kiev. L. Plakhov, a graduate of the St Petersburg Academy of Arts, worked in various cities in Ukraine with a camera obscura. The English photographer R. Fenton documented the Crimean War in 1855. O. Ivanov from Kharkiv captured images of the Russian-Turkish War in the Balkans in 1877-8 and compiled an album of nearly 170 photos. The Odessa photographer M. Raul took many photos of daily life in Kiev, Poltava, Chernihiv, and Katerynoslav gubernias throughout the 18705 and received awards at the 1875 Paris Geographic Exhibition and the 1878 World Exposition. Nineteenth-century portrait photographers in Kiev included I. Hudovsky (three portraits of T. Shevchenko in 1859), V. Vysotsky, Y. Kordysh, and F. de Mezer; H. Chuhaievych specialized in urban scenes. Y. Khmilevsky from Poltava left a substantial collection of photos of the folkways of the Poltava region in the 18805 and 18905, an album entitled Gogol' na rodine ([N.] Gogol in His Homeland, 1902), a collection of photos taken at the unveiling of the I. Kotliarevsky monument in Poltava in 1903, and a large series of photos of the Poltava Zemstvo building (1908-9). Ethnographic albums were also produced by Kh. Parfenenko. A. *Fedetsky, the first filmmaker and tricolor photographer in Ukraine, worked in Kharkiv from 1884 to 1902. The first commercial photography studios in Ukraine were established in the early 18705 in Balta, Berdychiv, Bila Tserkva, Kamianets-Podilskyi, Korsun, Lypovets, Skvyra, Uman, Vinnytsia, Yampil, and other Ukrainian towns. On the eve of the First World War there were approx 70 commercial studios, 40 of them in Odessa, and 6 photographic-equipment stores in Kiev. At the end of the 19th century, technological innovations facilitated the growth of photographic arts. In 1891 the Odessa Photographic Society (headed by M. Balikhov) was formed. By 1900 it had 192 members. It issued the periodicals Vestnik Odesskogo fotograficheskogo obshchestva (1912-14) and Russkii fotograficheskii vestnik (1915-16). Photography sections of branches of the Russian Technical Society were formed in Kharkiv (1891), Odessa (1897), and Kiev (1899). The Daguerre Society (1901-17) was established in Kiev by M. Bobyr, the author of Khudozhnia fotografiia (Art Photography, 1907), and others. In 1906-12 its president was M. *Petrov; he later lectured at the Kiev State Institute of Art and Institute of Cinematography. The only school of photography in the Russian Empire, the Art and Craft Printing Workshop, was opened in Kiev in 1903. It was founded by V. *Kulzhenko. It was also in Kiev that the first international photo exhibition in the empire took place, in December 1908. It displayed over 500 works, including examples of X-ray photography. Kiev was also the venue for the Second Congress of Russian Photographers (1908) and an international salon of art photography (1911). Technical advances were made by V. Favorsky, a pioneer in microphotography, and in the 19105 the Kiev journal Iskusstvo i pechatnoe délo documented developments in color photography. Ukrainians who wrote theoretical pieces on art photography included M. *Biliashivsky and I. *Trush. In 1914 Biliashivsky proposed that a systematic photographic census of Kiev be conducted. Articles on photography were published in Ukrainian periodicals (eg, H. Kovalenko's\n\n10\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY\n\non domestic photography in Literaturno-naukovyi vistnyk [1899]), and photos of individuals were used as illustrations in works such as O. Shalatska's Taiemnytsi mista Kyieva (The Secrets of Kiev, 1904). Trush wrote about the relationship between painting and photography in 1905. In Austrian-ruled Western Ukraine, Polish organizations, such as the Club of Photographic Art Amateurs in Lviv (1891-1903) and the Lviv Photographic Society (1903-14,1924-39), were founded in Lviv, and a German Camera Club was created in Chernivtsi. Photography periodicals appeared in Lviv - Przeglqd Fotograficzny (1895), Kronika Fotograftczna (1898-9), Wiadomosci Fotograficzne (1903-6) and Miesiçcznik Fotograficzny (1908-11). The pioneers of photography in Galicia were A. Karpiuk, V. *Shukhevych, and M. Petriv in Lviv; S. Dmokhovsky and Ye. Liubovych in Peremyshl; and F. Velychko in Stanyslaviv. Liubovych organized a photography club at the Peremyshl gymnasium in 1911. In 1912 the archeologist Ya. Pasternak called on photographers to document the ethnography and architecture (particularly wooden churches) of Galicia. At a combat photography exhibition held in Vienna in 1916, the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen's pavilion displayed photos of I. *Ivanets, M. *Uhryn-Bezhrishny, and others. In September 1918 the Riflemen's exhibit was brought to the National Museum in Lviv, becoming the first Western Ukrainian photographic exhibition. In the interwar years of Soviet Ukraine the Kiev Photographic Institute enjoyed a brief existence, and in 1922 it organized an exposition. Original literature in Ukrainian emerged, the first example of which was L. *Skrypnyk's photographer's guide (1927). The photos of S. Arshenevsky, D. *Demutsky, M. Lishchynsky, D. Sotnyk, and P. Yezersky were landmarks of creative achievement, and periodicals such as Foto-kino (Kharkiv 1922-3) and Foto sotsbudivnytstvu (Kharkiv 1928-34) popularized the art. During the terror of the 19305, Soviet Ukrainian photography suffered the same tragic fate as other branches of Ukrainian culture. The first All-Ukrainian Exhibition of Photographic Art was held in 1936, but its catalog was suppressed soon afterward. The first ail-Union photography exhibit was brought to Kiev in 1938. Photography continued to develop in interwar Western Ukraine and in the Ukrainian émigré community. In October 1920 a photography circle headed by O. Balytsky was established in the Ukrainian internment camp in Libérée, Bohemia, and it held a show within a year. In November 1930 the first general meeting of the Ukrainian Photographic Society was held in Lviv, and S. Dmokhovsky was chosen to head it. The society, which had 216 members in 1936, held regular exhibitions and published illustrated catalogs of works by Yu. Dorosh, R. Myrovych, O. *Mokh, and D. Figol and the journal Svitlo i tin ' (1933-9), edited by S. Shchurat and O. Mokh. The Polish journals Miesçcznik Fotograficzny (1925-31), Kamera Polska (1932-3), and Przeglad Fotograficzny (1935-9) were also published in Lviv, and the second (1928) and sixth (1932) international photographic salons were held there. The Ukrainians L. Yanushevych and Ya. Shalabavka had commercial studios in Lviv. In 1957 a photographers' section of the Union of Journalists of Ukraine was formed. The more prominent photojournalists include Ya. Davydzon, M. Kozlovsky, M. Melnyk, and H. Uhrynovych. Professional portrait\n\nFirst issue of the new Ukrainian photography magazine, Svitlo i tin ' (1991)\n\nstudios have been under the supervision of the Ministry of Consumer Services. Until the late 19805 the activity of amateur clubs was limited by government policy and the lack of equipment. Nonetheless, talented photo artists such as R. Baran, Ye. Derlemenko, I. Kostin (who documented the Chornobyl nuclear disaster), I. Kropyvnytsky, S. Marchenko, and V. Lysenko have left their mark. I. Ronchar has amassed a large collection of ethnographic photographs from all parts of Ukraine. The first museum of photography in Ukraine was opened as a division of the ^National Museum in Lviv. S. Bilokin Physical anthropology. The study of the physical characteristics of the human race with respect to origin, development, classification, and distribution. The subject can be subdivided into somatology and paleontology. The first describes and measures discrete bodily members, skin color, height and weight, blood type, and the structure of the internal organs (see *Races). The second deals with early human history on the basis of archeological evidence. The earliest information about the physical characteristics of Ukraine's inhabitants is in Herodotus' and Hippocrates' accounts of the Scythians. Medieval Byzantine and Arab authors, such as Procopius, Zacharias Rhetor, Ibn Dast or Ibn Rosta, and Ibn Fadlân, provided further data on Ukraine's population. Descriptions of Ukrainians are also found in the works of i/th- and 18thcentury travelers. From impressionistic descriptions of the population of Kievan Rus' two anthropological types can be distinguished. The princes, knights, and merchants possessed mostly Nordic traits, whereas the general population consisted of short-headed Trypilians (or Armenoids). According to archeological excavations the following anthropological types once inhabited Ukrainian territories: Neanderthal (Upper to Middle Paleolithic period), Mediterranean (Middle Paleolithic period), Cro-Magnon (Upper Paleolithic period), Lapponoid (Upper to late Paleolithic period), Southern Mediterranean with Negroid features (late Paleolithic to early Mesolithic period), Nordic Cro-Magnon (Neolithic and Eneolithic period), Armenoid (beginning of the Bronze Age), and Mediterranean (Bronze Age). The intermingling of these chief types led to the development of the East European or Sub-Nordic type (from the Lapponoid and Nordic types), the Adriatic or Dinaric type (from the Nordic and Armenoid types), and the Alpine type (from the Sub-Nordic and Dinaric types). The inhabitants of protohistoric and early\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION historic Ukraine consisted of three main strata: people of the Trypilian culture, chiefly Armenoid in type; the Iranian (Sakian) people, chiefly Nordic and Mediterranean in type; and the Slavs, Nordic-Armenoid in type. According to F. Vovk's findings at the beginning of the 2Oth century, the population of Ukraine can be divided into three anthropological belts: (i) the northern belt (southern Kursk, Chernihiv, northern Kiev, northern Volhynia, and Kholm regions); (2) the middle belt (southern Voronezh, Kharkiv, Poltava, and Kiev regions, northern Podilia, southern Volhynia, and eastern Galicia [excluding the Hutsul and Boiko regions]); and (3) the southern belt (Backa [Yugoslavia], Transcarpathia, the southern Boiko and Hutsul regions, southern Podilia, and the Kherson, Zaporizhia, Tavriia, and Kuban regions). Most Ukrainians of the northern belt are of medium height, with fairly light hair and eyes, semiround heads with high foreheads, medium faces, and fairly wide noses, often snubbed. Ukrainians of the middle belt are mostly above medium height, with darker hair and eyes, round heads, high foreheads, medium-broad faces, narrow and straight noses. Most Ukrainians of the southern belt are tall with even darker hair and eyes, round heads, high foreheads, medium-broad and elongated faces, and narrow, mostly straight but sometimes curved and aquiline, noses.

The system of organized instruction in hygiene, calisthenics, and organized sports. Western Ukraine to 1914. Until the early 2Oth century,\n\n11\n\nPE in Western Ukraine left much to be desired. For adults it was limited to sporadic training in hunting, swimming, rowing, skating, sledding, and fencing (training in the last was given by the Sich and Rus' student societies in Vienna and Graz, respectively). In elementary and secondary schools PE was usually taught by poorly qualified instructors. Instruction improved somewhat in the years immediately preceding the First World War, thanks to the efforts of the Sokil society and individual promoters of PE, such as I. Bobersky. At first, one to two school hours per week was devoted to PE. Eventually, extracurricular groups for tennis, track-and-field sports, hiking, swimming, skiing, sledding, and skating were organized. PE for girls and women, which had been neglected previously, began receiving some attention. In 1887, using Czech examples, V. Lavrivsky drafted the first charter for a Ukrainian gymnastics society in Lviv. The Austrian authorities, however, did not permit a Ukrainian PE society to be set up until 1894. That year the *Sokil society was established in Lviv, and branches were soon founded throughout Galicia. The first Ukrainian exercise manual, by O. Popovych, was published in Chernivtsi in 1889; it was followed by I. Bobersky7 s books on games (2 vols, 1904-5) and soccer (1906), T. Franko's book on tennis, and O. Tysovsky's handbook for the Plast Ukrainian Youth Association (1913). During Bobersky's presidency (1908-14) the central Sokil society in Lviv purchased its own stadium and trained many PE instructors and teachers. Paramilitary riflemen's units were organized and trained in 1912-14 by S. Goruk as part of the program of the Sokil societies in Lviv, Drohobych, and other towns; they formed the nucleus of the \"Ukrainian Sich Riflemen during the First World War. PE in Galicia was also promoted by the *Sich society, founded by K. Trylovsky in 1900. Its branches in Galicia and Bukovyna operated independently until 1912, when they were integrated into the Ukrainian Sich Union. Ukraine under tsarist rule. As in Western Ukraine, PE in Russian-ruled Ukraine was sporadic and amateurish. In the early 2Oth century, interest in PE increased with the introduction of a Sokil-style gymnastics program and track-and-field meets as part of the secondary-school curriculum, as well as of the scouting movement. There was, however, no organized Ukrainian PE movement before the 1917 Revolution, although a number of sports clubs were established in Kiev, Odessa, and other cities. During the First World War, gymnastics in the secondary schools was replaced by military drills. During the revolutionary period of 1917-20, PE continued to be part of the secondary-school curriculum. Sports activities were organized by various Ukrainian youth and school clubs and by the first Ukrainian boy scout troops that appeared in Kiev, Chernihiv, Bila Tserkva, and other cities. The *Free Cossack movement also promoted PE among its ranks. As a result, semimilitary, semiathletic youth detachments fought on the side of the UNR in many parts of Ukraine. Western Ukraine, 1918-44. Under Polish, Czechoslovak, and Rumanian rule, the development of Ukrainian PE organizations was to some extent obstructed by the authorities. In the Polish-ruled territories, PE in the schools improved considerably over what it had been under prewar Austrian rule. Besides calisthenics based on the Swedish, Danish, and German systems, the school pro-\n\n12\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION\n\ngrams included outdoor activities and games. Extracurricular sports, hiking, and camping activities were organized by Ukrainian groups such as the Plast Ukrainian Youth Association, branches of the revived Sokil and Sich societies, local branches of the Orly Catholic Association of Ukrainian Youth and the Union of Ukrainian Progressive Youth, and, after the Sich society was banned in 1924, the *Luh society. Many new Ukrainian sports societies were founded. In 1925 the sports section of Sokil central in Lviv, together with various sports societies, set up a central coordinating and planning agency, the \"Ukrainian Sports Union (uss), which organized soccer tournaments, regional and provincial athletic competitions, PE courses, and training camps and introduced a general test culminating in a physical competence badge. During the Second World War, PE in the German-occupied Generalgouvernement was co-ordinated by the Office of Physical Education of the Department for Youth Care of the Ukrainian Central Committee in Cracow. It organized a network of new clubs in the Lemko and Kholm regions. After the Germans occupied most of Ukraine, PE was able to develop only in Western Ukraine. In 1943 there were 124 PE societies there (including 22 in the Ternopil area, 16 in the Lviv region, 16 in the Stanyslaviv region, 13 in the Stryi region, 11 in the Peremyshl region, and 5 in the Kholm region) and 177 PE groups organized by Ukrainian educational societies, with a total membership of 11,000. Soviet Ukraine. PE in Soviet Ukraine was part of the allSoviet PE system. In the 19205 all existing sports organizations were quickly dissolved, and many of their leaders were persecuted. For most of the Soviet period, PE served the interests of the totalitarian state and was organized and controlled by it to prepare the masses for 'highly productive socialist labor' and for the defense of Soviet communism. All PE organizations and sports associations outside the school system created and controlled by the Communist Youth League or trade unions, themselves strictly subordinated to the Party and state. In 1918-19 the first PE teaching institutions were established, and PE became part of military training and the school curriculum. In the early 19205 special councils assumed control over PE on the local level. In 1930 centralized state control of PE in the USSR became official with the creation of the All-Union Council on Physical Culture, to which the existing Higher Council on Physical Culture of Ukraine was subordinated. In 1936 the All-Union Council was reorganized into the All-Union Committee on Physical Culture and Sports of the USSR Council of People's Commissars. Under this system all Komsomol and workers' sports organizations at educational institutions and industrial plants were subordinated to oblast councils of sports associations, and these are subordinated to councils of the central committees of the Komsomol or trade unions. From 1931 Soviet PE was based on the so-called GTO (Ready for Labor and Defense of the USSR) mass fitness program introduced by the Komsomol. The revised program (1972) had five levels: (i) for children aged 10-13, (2) for adolescents aged 14-15, (3) for adolescents aged 16-18, (4) for men aged 19-39 and women 19-34, and (5) for men aged 40-60 and women 35-55. At each level certain physical testing was compulsory. All young people were taught and participated in cross-country running and skiing, in running obstacle courses, swimming, and gymnastics; other sports were elective. Testing reflected the\n\npurpose of the program - to raise labor productivity and military readiness. According to official figures, approx 6.8 million people in Ukraine qualified for the GTO badge in 1982. PE in nursery and elementary schools consisted of an approved program of lessons, exercises, and games. In elementary schools students were taught calisthenics and simple active games and were gradually introduced to gymnastics, track-and-field sports, swimming, skiing, and team sports. In Ukraine there were also over 800 'children's and youth sports schools,' at which more than 321,000 7- to 14-year-old children received preliminary training for future careers in sports. Selected for their athletic talents, the children usually specialized in one, two, or three of 43 sports. Those who went on received curricular and extracurricular training in sports proficiency schools (ages 16-18) and higher sports proficiency schools (ages 18 and over). Exceptionally promising children (ages 7-18) were sent to republican sports boarding schools (26 in the USSR), where they were trained to compete in the Olympic Games. As sports contacts and competitions with the West increased after the Second World War, Soviet PE and sports training intensified. In 1959 the Committee on Physical Culture and Sports was replaced by the Union of Sports Societies and Organizations. Oblast, municipal, raion, and local PE councils supervised all existing *sports societies and clubs and physical-culture collectives at plants, factories, and collective and state farms. In 1981 there were in Ukraine approx 150,000 professional PE workers (65,000 of them with higher education) and 3,000 trainers, 2,500 registered referees, and over 315,000 GTO instructors. In 1987, training and sports facilities in the republic included 112,000 playing courts and fields, 13,600 gyms, 354 swimming pools, 600 skiing bases, 8,000 rifle ranges, 894 stadia, a swimming center in Kharkiv, and a rowing center in Kherson. PE instructors, trainers, referees, and coaches were educated at specialized secondary PE tekhnikums in Donetske, Dniprodzerzhynske, and Ivano-Frankivske; at PE departments of the Lutske, Mykolaiv, Odessa, Ternopil, Kharkiv, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Luhanske, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhia, Kamianets-Podilskyi, and Kirovohrad pedagogical institutes; and at the *Kiev, *Lviv, and Dnipropetrovske institutes of physical culture. Sports medicine was taught at the Kiev Scientific Research Institute of the Medical Problems of Physical Culture (est 1969). Most recently, the Sokil society was revived in Lviv (1990). Abroad. The Ukrainian interwar émigrés in Czechoslovakia had the best organized PE activities. These began in the internment camps and were continued by the Ukrainian Sokil and Sich unions abroad. PE was also part of the activities of the Sokil and Sich societies in the United States, Canada, and Argentina. After the Second World War, refugees in Germany founded the \"Ukrainian Council for Physical Culture in Augsburg (November 1945). Led by I. Lukiianenko, V. Blavatsky, I. Krasnyk, and S. Kikta, it introduced a physical fitness badge; organized skiing, volleyball, and basketball courses and a school for PE instructors in Mittenwald in 1947; and arranged soccer games and athletic competitions among sports clubs in the DP camps. PE among the postwar Ukrainian immigrants in North America, South America, and Australia has been part of the activities of Plast, the Ukrainian Youth Association, and the Ukrainian Democratic Youth Association. Competitions have been\n\nPHYSICS\n\nsponsored by the ^Ukrainian Sports Federation of the United States and Canada. BIBLIOGRAPHY Chernova, le.

The institute's accomplishments include the first induced nuclear transmutation in the USSR (1932), the production of liquid hydrogen (1931) and helium (1932), and the construction of the first three-co-ordinate radiolocator in the USSR (1938) and of the torsatron (1970). The directors of the institute have been I. Obreimov (1928-32), A. Leipunsky (1932-7), O. Shpetny (1937-44), K. Synelnykov (1944-65), V. Ivanov (1965-80), and V. Zelensky (since 1980). Many other noted scientists have worked at the institute, including L. Landau, G. Latyshev, L. Vereshchagin, L. Shubnikov, A. Walter, O. Akhiiezer, V. Bariakhtar, B. Lazarev, B. Verkin, O. Halkin, A. Prykhotko, V. Tolok, Ye. Borovyk, and O. Sytenko (see also *Physics). BIBLIOGRAPHY Ivanov, V. (ed). ^oletKhar'kovskomufiziko-tekhnicheskomu institutu AN USSR (Kiev 1978) L. Onyshkevych\n\n13\n\nPhysics. Originally 'physics' referred to the study of all aspects of nature. In the mid-i9th century it was still synonymous with 'natural philosophy.' The earliest extant Ukrainian source on natural philosophy is the retelling of Aristotelian ideas in the *Izbornik of Sviatoslav (1073). In Ukraine attention was first devoted to quantitative problems in the Protestant schools, which appeared at the end of the i6th century (eg, Berestechko in Volhynia and Khmilnyk in Podilia). They produced mathematical and technical manuals for artisans and merchants, handwritten in the Ukrainian vernacular. Arithmetic and astronomy were taught in the *Ostrih Academy (est ça 1576), the first institution of higher learning in Ukraine. Considerable attention was devoted to the natural sciences in the *Kievan Mohyla Academy (est 1632). T. *Prokopovych's lectures on natural philosophy, physics, and mathematics at the academy were lucid treatments of much that was known on those subjects at the time. From the 17305, natural philosophy was taught at *Kharkiv College; in 1765 physics-related subjects, such as structural engineering, geodesy, and artillery and ballistics, became part of trie curriculum; and in 1795, after the college merged with the Kharkiv Central Public College, physics was taught as a separate subject. In the early 19th century, Kharkiv University was the center of physics research in Ukraine. The first professor of physics there was A. *Stojkovic (1805-13). T. *Osipovsky studied atmospheric optics and argued against the Kantian concept of space and time. His former student M. *Ostrohradsky was the first Ukrainian to contribute to the development of physics and mathematics on the international level. He copostulated the Gauss-Ostrohradsky theorem on the transformation of a volume integral into a surface integral, one of the cornerstones of continuum mechanics and electrodynamics, and solved a number of outstanding theoretical physics problems. In 1882 a Kharkiv University lecturer, M. *Pylchykov, investigating the polarization of light scattered by the atmosphere, found that blue light is scattered more than red, and corrected the prevailing view that the sky is blue because of air fluorescence. Fundamental discoveries in theoretical mechanics were made at the university in the last decade of the 19th century. By generalizing S. Kovalevska's 1889 theoretical studies of dynamical instabilities, A. *Liapunov provided a starting point for applied areas, such as radio technology and control theory. Recently, interest in his work was revived in studies of nonlinear dynamics and chaotic systems; the so-called Liapunov exponent is now an established indicator for determining if a motion is chaotic. At Kiev University the basis for experimental physics research in Ukraine was laid by M. *Avenarius from 1866 on. Avenarius is best known for his discovery of the temperature dependence of the electromotive force of thermoelements (Avenarius's law) and for his systematic measurements of the critical temperatures of fluids. In 1884 the first chair of theoretical physics in Ukraine was founded at Kiev University. It was first held by N. *Shiller, who made important contributions to electrodynamics (highly regarded by J. Maxwell) and showed that differential equations describing the second law of thermodynamics contain an integrating factor that is a universal function of temperature. Shiller also founded the *Kiev Physics and Mathematics Society (1890); it played an important role in the development and popularization of physics in Ukraine.\n\n14\n\nPHYSICS\n\nSubstantial contributions were also made by physicists working at the university in Odessa. There N. Umov introduced the concepts of energy density and the vector property of energy flow in 1874, and M. Pylchykov conducted the first measurements of radioactivity in Ukraine in 1900. Soviet Ukraine Kiev. From 1918 important work in mathematical physics, in particular on approximate integration of differential equations, was carried out in the PhysicalMathematical Division of the newly founded Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. Papers published in the 19205 in the academy's serials and subsequently abroad brought international recognition to those doing theoretical work in Ukraine. Of special significance was M. *Krylov and his student N. *Bogoliubov/s (M. Boholiubov) development of modern nonlinear mechanics. Subsequently, Bogoliubov became world-renowned for his seminal contributions to statistical, nuclear, and particle physics and quantum-field theory. The department of experimental physics organized in 1923 at the Kiev Polytechnical Institute by O. *Goldman was the first modern physics research center in Ukraine. Properties of dielectrics and semiconductors were investigated there. In 1929 the department was transformed into a multifaceted Physics Scientific Research Institute, which in 1936 was renamed the AN URSR (now ANU) ^Institute of Physics. In 1927 Goldman started Ukrains'ki ftzychni zapysky (later Fizychni zapysky, 1926-41), the first Ukrainian serial devoted exclusively to physics. By that time Ukrainian physics and other scientific ^terminology had been largely codified. Fizychni zapysky contributed substantially to the further development of physics terminology. In 1926 N. Morgulis established, as part of the department of physics at Kiev University, a laboratory for physical electronics, where experimental and theoretical work was conducted on the ionization of surfaces. In 1930 the laboratory became part of the Physics Scientific Research Institute. Ten other ANU physics-related research establishments have been based in Kiev: the \"Institute of Mechanics (est 1919); the Institute of Hydromechanics (est 1926); the Main *Astronomical Observatory (est 1944); the ^Institute of Electrodynamics (est 1947);tne \"Institute of Metal Physics (est 1955); the ^Institute of Semiconductors (est 1960), where theoretical and applied laser physics is studied; the \"Institute of Geophysics (est 1960), which also develops and improves geophysical methods for discovering new mineral deposits; the \"Institute of Technical Thermophysics (est 1947), which directs its efforts at investigating alternative and renewable energy sources; the \"Institute of Theoretical Physics (est 1966); and the \"Institute for Nuclear Research (est 1970). The last two institutes have in short order acquired international renown, the former for its research in quantum-field theory (O. Parasiuk, P. Fomin, V. Miransky, O. Parasiuk, G. Zinovev), nuclear and plasma theory (O. Sytenko, I. Simenoh, V. Kharchenko, I. Yakymenko), condensed-matter physics (V. Bariakhtar, I. Dziub), and quantum biophysics (O. Davydov, V. Hachok, E. Petrov, I. Ukrainsky), and the latter for its experimental facilities and a strong theoretical group (V. Strutynsky, V. Fushchych, D. Petryna of the Institute of Mathematics). Some of the other scientists who have contributed significantly to the advance of physical knowledge are V. Stryzhak (neutron physics at Kiev University, 1960-76), M.\n\nBrodyn, I. Horban, A. Lubchenko, M. Shpak (optical properties of solids), and S. Pekar (polaron theory). In 1990 the founding congress of the Ukrainian Physics Society was held in Kiev; V. Bariakhtar was elected president. Kharkiv. In many respects, scientific research output from Kharkiv has rivaled and even surpassed Kiev's. In 1919 D. Rozhansky established a radio-physics laboratory at Kharkiv University, and in 1924-5 magnetrons for radio-wave generation were developed at the Kharkiv Institute of People's Education (KhINO) by A. Slutskin and D. Shteinberg. The All-Ukrainian Association of Physicists was founded at the KhINO in 1926; headed by -A. Zhelekhivsky, it also had branches in Kiev (headed by O. Goldman), Dnipropetrovske (by A. Malinovsky), and Odessa (by E. Kirilov). A department of physics was founded at the KhINO in 1927; it was directed by D. Rozhansky. In 1928 the Ukrainian Physical-Technical Institute (uPTl) was established. It developed rapidly into a major physics center for the entire USSR. The vigorous development of experimental nuclear physics at the institute was exemplified by the 4OO-KeV electrostatic accelerator brought online in 1932 and by the 3.5-MeV facility made operational in 1937 (the most powerful in Europe at the time). Soviet heavy-water production was first achieved there by A. Brodsky in 1934. Major contributions were also made to theoretical and experimental nuclear, high-energy, plasma, low-temperature, and solid-state physics. Important discoveries were made in the areas of antiferromagnetism, ideal diamagnetism of semiconductors, nuclear magnetism, dynamics of magnetic moments, interacting spin waves (magnons), and magnetoacoustic resonance. In 1938 the UPTl was renamed the AN URSR *PhysicalTechnical Institute (PTl). Today substantive theoretical work on supersymmetry is conducted there (D. Volkov). Salient postwar experimental achievements are exemplified by the bringing on-line in 1964 of a 2-GeV electron accelerator (K. Synelnykov, I. Hrishaiev), and by the breakthroughs in high-frequency and turbulent-plasma heating and in the confinement and control of thermonuclear plasma (Ya. Fainberg). Research in advanced fusion technology is pursued with the torsatron SATURN (1970, the world's first) and the Uragan 1-3 series of stellarators (V. Tolok). Notable scientists have been associated at one time or another with the UPTI and PTL In 1932 A. Leipunsky, K. Synelnykov, A. Walter, and G. Latyshev were the first in the USSR to induce the disintegration of a stable nucleus (lithium) by means of accelerated protons. Leipunsky became internationally known in 1934 while working in England in E. Rutherford's laboratory; there he obtained the first experimental evidence for the existence of the neutrino. In 1930, while working at the UPTI, the Russian physicist V. Fock became well known in the atomic and nuclear physics community for his contribution to the Hartree-Fock self-consistent field approximation. The 1962 Nobel Prize winner L. Landau headed the UPTI theoretical department in 1932-7. His imprint has been strongly felt there to the present day. There he and his student E. Lifshits wrote the landmark ten-volume Course of Theoretical Physics, which is still used world-wide. I. Pomeranchuk, author of the Pomeranchuk theorem, worked at the PTl, as did O. Akhiiezer and O. Sytenko, who are known for their theory of plasma fluctuations, I. Lifshits (theory\n\nPHYSICS of metals), M. Asbel and E. Kahner, who discovered cyclotron resonance in metals, and V. Zelensky (materials science). In 1960 the Physical-Technical Institute of Low Temperatures was founded as a PTI offshoot, where fundamental and applied investigations have been conducted in superconductivity, the electronic properties of solids, the molecular physics of heat exchange, macromolecules, and cryogenics (see L. *Shubnikov). Physics research has also been conducted at Kharkiv University; the Kharkiv Polytechnical (formerly Technological) Institute; the Kharkiv Astronomical Observatory; and the ANU \"Institute of Radio Physics and Electronics (est 1955), known for the discovery of the io.4-Hz acoustic laser. A recent outgrowth of the latter institute is the Radio Astronomy Institute (est 1986), directed by S. Braude. It has operated the decameter-band radio telescope UTR-2, the largest in the world (in 1989) in the 10- to 25-MHz range, which has located some 60 new discrete decameter sources. The UTR-2 is the main component of the new system of four decameter-band interferometers (dubbed URAN, an acronym for Ukrainian Radiointerferometers of the ANU) with baseline lengths of between 40 and 900 km.
