        "text": "Berestye Fortress is a fortress of the Polish Commonwealth. It is initially ruled by Colonel Jerzy Halecki.\n\nIt has the village Solechniki.\n\nLayout[]\n\nAccessible area\n\nPlayer Lord's Hall Prison\n\nSiege Ladders\n\nThe Lord's Hall is directly opposite the player's entrance behind the gates. The prison is the first house on the left.\n\nDuring a siege there will be a total of three ladders placed on either side of the gates: one on the left and two on the right. The player will start slightly to the right of the path leading to the gates.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe modern name of this place is Brest. In Belarusian it is written Брэст, in Russian Брест, in Polish Brześć, in Lithuanian Brasta, but in Ukrainian it is still Берестя Berestia. It was also named \"Lithuanian Brest\" (Polish: Brześć Litewski, Russian: Брест-Литовск Brest-Litovsk) to contrast with Brześć Kujawski in Poland.\n\nWikipedia has an article on this subject at:\n\nBrest, Belarus"
