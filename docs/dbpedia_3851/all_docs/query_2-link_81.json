This war memorial is the largest tourist attraction of the city. The Berestye Archeological Museum of the old city is located on the southern island of the Hero-Fortress. It has objects and huts dating from the 11th – 13th century, that were unearthed during excavations in the 1970s. Brest is proud of its shopping mall, Sovietskaya Street. It was dramatically reconstructed in 2007–2009 to revive the initial view of the old town. In July 2009 the Millennium Monument of Brest was unveiled.\n\nThe Museum of Rescued Art Treasures has a nice collection of paintings and icons. Brest also has the first Belarusian outdoor railway museum.\n\nEarlier in Brest there was a synagogue, which was regarded as the first one in Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It is also the seat of an Armenian and of a Greek Catholic bishop; the former has jurisdiction over the Armenians throughout the whole country.\n\nBrest City Park is over 100 years old, and underwent renovations from 2004 to 2006 as part of a ceremony marking the parks centennial.\n\nSights around Brest\n\nBelavezhskaya Pushcha National Park, 70 km (43 mi) north of Brest, is a biosphere reserve of world distinction and can be reached by car or bus. This medieval forest is home to rare European bison (wisent). There is a museum and a zoo, available for tourists in the forest, animals can be seen in enclosures all the year round. 2 hotels and some restaurants and bars are there. Excursions can also be taken by horse and cart into the interior of the forest. As a new tourist attraction, the forest features the residence of Grandfather Frost, known as Ded Moroz, the Eastern Slavic Santa Claus, that works all the year round.\n\nBrest also hosts the first Belarusian outdoor railway museum. Brest City Park is old, but looks new after the recent reconstruction.\n\nKamyanets, Belarus, that lies on the way to the National park from Brest, features an outstanding landmark, the 13th-century tower of Kamyanets. The village of Kosova, where Tadeusz Kosciuszko was born, is also in the Brest region and features a 19th-century palace and a nice Roman Catholic church.\n\nReferences\n\nBrest, Belarus Wikipedia\n\n(Text) CC BY-SA\n\n(,)http://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/s/w-syn-bel-brzesc-1.jpg(,)http://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzcyYTc3NWY1MTFlNWQ4ZGQwN19JTUdfMTgxMS5KUEciXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjYwMHhcdTAwM2UiXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiLXF1YWxpdHkgOTEiXV0/image.jpg(,)http://www.jewishgen.org/Belarus/newsletter/brest-fire.jpg(,)http://www.belarus.by/relimages/000454_782364.jpg(,)http://www.listofwonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Walls-of-Brest-Fortress.jpg(,)http://us.123rf.com/450wm/konstantinks/konstantinks1111/konstantinks111100815/11356488-old-gate-in-brest-fortress-belarus-early-spring.jpg(,)http://previews.123rf.com/images/konstantinks/konstantinks1111/konstantinks111100491/11348836-The-ruins-of-the-Brest-Fortress-Belarus-Early-springStock-Photo.jpg(,)http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/pinkas_poland/images/pol5_00226b.jpg(,)http://www.jewishgen.org/Belarus/newsletter/brestsyn.jpg(,)http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fxCEvTn_Pbg/T1oQ6y95NvI/AAAAAAAADlM/5T8hxIUJSOQ/s1600/Belarus%2B15.jpg(,)http://tobelarus.com/images/stories/thumbs/L2hvbWUvcC9wbGVoYW4vdG9iZWxhcnVzLmNvbS9wdWJsaWNfaHRtbC9pbWFnZXMvc3Rvcmllcy9OYXRpb25hbFBhcmtzL0Vjb3RvdXJpc20vQmVsYXJ1c2lhbl9MYW5kc2NhcGVfUmVzZXJ2ZV9WWUdPTk9TSENIQU5TS09ZRS5qcGc%3D.jpg(,)http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-b4elDNpsW-0/UCU43_fCIwI/AAAAAAAAAY0/_7cP9iHHpYo/s1600/2.Brest%2BFortress%2B%252528Hero-Fortress%252529%25252C%2BBrest%25252C%2BBelarus.jpg(,)http://urodnich.name/img/portfolio/urodnich-painting-s4aswUva.jpg(,)http://urodnich.name/img/portfolio/urodnich-painting-wEphe2Ad.jpg(,)http://www.belarus.by/relimages/000445_99487.jpg(,)http://www.fansshare.com/photos/belarus/railway-station-brest-belarus-912145453.jpg(,)http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C7UxhUpYIO4/T1oRDqpaJbI/AAAAAAAADmE/45Sc9BOiOFE/s1600/Belarus%2B4.jpg(,)https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f4/58/13/f45813e535e2c3b71b29811ab66a5b00.jpg(,)http://tobelarus.com/images/stories/NationalParks/Ecotourism/Belarus_Reserve.jpg(,)http://data2.whicdn.com/images/55362507/large.jpg(,)http://previews.123rf.com/images/infina/infina1307/infina130700004/21745167-Summer-landscape-with-river-Mukhavets-The-city-of-Brest-BelarusStock-Photo.jpg(,)https://images-resrc.staticlp.com/C%3DAR1200x630/S%3DW1200,U/O%3D85/http://media.lonelyplanet.com/a/g/hi/t/570f2783e1db7f4fdb080afa75c95468-brest-fortress.jpg(,)http://tobelarus.com/images/stories/NationalParks/Ecotourism/BelarusVYGONOSHCHANSKOYE_hedgehog.jpg(,)http://www.fansshare.com/images/belarus/brest-belarus-wallpaper-1447446847.jpg(,)http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/19405094.jpg(,)http://euroradio.fm/files/styles/in_report_main/public/field/image/2015/04/kuxarachka.png%3Fitok%3DBlPTUF80(,)http://media-1.web.britannica.com/eb-media/92/126692-004-1BF2DF0E.jpg(,)http://www.belarus.by/relimages/000547_246651.jpg(,)http://www.belarus.by/relimages/000739_362869.jpg(,)http://writespeakenglish.com/images/stories/breads_of_belarus/brest_bakery_4.jpg(,)http://www.belarus.by/dadvimages/000547_875496.jpg(,)https://www.happytellus.com/img/brest/brest-station_16.jpg(,)http://i.ytimg.com/vi/aI3uz5xfG-Q/maxresdefault.jpg"
