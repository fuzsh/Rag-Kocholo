        "text": "Considered to be among the best sources we have on early Russian history are the three or four Russo-Byzantine Treaties inserted in the Povest’ vremennykh let s.a. 907, 911, 944 and 971. Undoubtedly the now lost originals were written in Greek and only later translated into Old Russian, possibly in connection with the compilation of the Povest’ vremennykh let. The question then arises to which extent the Old Russian translation offers an exact rendition of the Greek originals or whether the text was somehow modified to suit 11th-century circumstances. Such a modification was certainly the appearance of the Slavic thunder god Perun on whom pagan Rus’ envoys with pure Norse names are said to have taken their oaths rather than Perun’s Norse colleague, Thor. In the paper, it is argued that another anachronistic modification can be seen in the recurrent prioritized sequence in which citizens of the Rus’ towns Kiev, Chernigov, Pereiaslavl’(-Russkii), were remunerated by Byzantine officials in the three earliest treaty texts. Rather than 10th-century realities, this sequence seems to reflect the seniority system of succession to the Kievan throne as instituted after the death of Jaroslav Vladimirovich in 1054. This view is supported by a discussion of the Tale of the Foundation of Pereiaslavl’, included in the Povest vremennykh let s.a. 992, suggesting that Pereiaslavl’, as seen by the compilator of Povest’ vremennykh let, only came into existence towards the end of the 10th century.\n\nThe Russians and the Ukrainians, and indeed the Belarusians too, share an origin myth which reaches back to the legendary Rurik’s founding of the kingdom of the Kyivan Rus However, rather than reaching fruition in the early 20th century, as was the case in much of Central Europe, the origin story was subsumed into the Soviet experiment, and only remerged after 1991. It is still very much a work in progress. Here we will look at how the founding myth of the Rus has been used in the Ukrainian nation building project, which will unavoidably lead to comparisons with Russia and, to a lesser extent, other neighbouring countries such as Poland, Belarus and Lithuania. From the Normanist debate of the mid-18th century to the rise of nationalism in the 19th century and the use of the Rus in the the Soviet Union, we turn to the present with its all its historical complexity and political ramifications regarding the relationship between Ukraine and Russia."
