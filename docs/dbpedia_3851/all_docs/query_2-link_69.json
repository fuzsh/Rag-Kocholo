        "text": "Cemetery Story 1- Immigration to St. Clements\n\nA journey through a cemetery reveals many interesting facts about a community. The East Selkirk Cemetery provides a glimpse of some of the early immigrants who settled in St. Clements, and their cultures.\n\nBetween the 1880’s and 1920’s, in St. Clements, the largest group of immigrants came from central and eastern Europe. There, Austria–Hungary ruled over two provinces in Ukraine called Galicia and Bukovina and they allowed Poland to be in charge of the Ukrainian people. They did not allow the Ukrainian people to attend their Orthodox Church. Russia was in charge of the eastern provinces and treated them very badly. They were not even allowed to speak their own language. The poorer people in both of these areas did not have enough land to live on or farm. Also, Hutterites from Germany and Mennonites and Doukhobors from Russia were having similar problems.\n\nThey were all looking for a better place to live and Canada, the United States and Brazil welcomed them as immigrants. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian, Polish, German and Russian people left their homes and families to find a better life.\n\nBetween 1890 and 1914 the immigrants travelled by ship and train to get to their new homes. Many people died on the journey due to overcrowding and illness on the ships. When they did land in Canada they boarded trains to the west. Many stopped in Winnipeg but others came to the Immigration Shed in East Selkirk. Upon arrival, they were given about 160 acres of land free. In their homeland, they would have had about 7 acres.\n\nThey settled in East Selkirk, Libau, the Beaches and in Narol-Gonor. Using timber for building and fuel they mainly built two styles of houses, Galician and Bukovinian. They found work on logging crews, railway lines and in mines. Most became vegetable farmers.\n\nManitoba’s Ukrainian Settlers\n\nOver one hundred fifty years have passed since the first wave of European immigrants made their way to a new country (Canada). Leaving their homeland, they were in search of a better way of life on land they could call their own.\n\nIn 1891 when the first large group of Ukrainians arrived on the edge of the Canadian Prairies, the land was still sparsely occupied. Two railways, CPR and CNR, crossed the vast expanse that was once called the Northwest Territory stretching to the newly acquired Province of British Columbia. Under Prime Minister Sir Wilfred Laurier, the newly appointed Minister of Internal Affairs, Clifford Sifton, spearheaded immigration plans to procure people who might be successful in farming the large fertile prairies of Canada’s west. Deals were established with the North Atlantic Shipping\n\nCompany from Hamburg, Germany to transport families from Europe to Halifax or Montreal. From these cities immigrants would board trains to head westward.\n\nIt was during this time that Ukrainian was experiencing economic turmoil and political uprising. Those who were able, seized the opportunity to relocate to Canada where they could obtain almost free parcels of land under the Dominion Land Grant Act. As well they would have freedom to practice their own religion without political interference.\n\nUnfortunately, after 1895, Immigration Officers could choose the location of new immigrants’ homesteads. The most productive lands and those closest to railway lines were given to those who did not need financial assistance by the government. Many of the poorest families were left alone on remote parcels of land. The father, as head of the household would need to work elsewhere on the rail lines or building roads far from home to help bring in the income needed for equipment and survival on a homestead. Some families perished under harsh and difficult conditions. Differences in language, culture and social status played a part in the struggle to gain confidence and to prosper in a relatively young country with a changing evolving society. Canada became uniquely multicultural without become a “melting pot”. Immigrants from many nations proudly celebrated and acknowledged their cultural roots in small communities.\n\nThere were many Ukrainian communities located throughout Manitoba – south, west, east and north of Winnipeg. Between 1899 and the early 1900’s, tens of thousands of immigrants made homesteads in areas along lakes, the Interlake and to the Saskatchewan and Ontario borders. Later some would seek employment in the mining industry and establish roots as far north as Flin Flon, The Pas and Thompson. The home, garden, and church community was still an integral part of the life and cultural identity.\n\nPost World War I and II, when economic conditions were more stable in Canada, another large immigration of 50 thousand Ukrainians arrived between 1926 and 1929. An additional 16 thousand came in 1939 to escape Stalin’s rule of Ukraine under a Soviet Regime.\n\nThe 1951 census stated Canada’s population as 14 004 429. Those of Ukrainian origin were reported as 395 043. In Manitoba, 98 753 out of a provincial population of 776 541 were said to be of Ukrainian descent. Of these numbers, half lived in rural and half in urban communities. In Winnipeg, with a population of 354 068 at that time, one eighth to one ninth were stated to be of Ukrainian origin.\n\nMany towns, schools, and churches were established by Ukrainians who were faithful and determined to make Canada a home for their children for generations to come. With much perseverance and sometimes years of exhaustive toil, immigrants of European backgrounds made much of Manitoba’s wilderness into productive farmlands and beautiful towns and cities. Ukrainians have shared in this transformation through the use of their strong faith, artistic and cultural influence. Thus hoping for betterment of their community and country. The contributions of Ukrainians to their new adoptive homeland only strengthened the multicultural mosaic of the many nations who now also call Canada their “Home and native land”.\n\nThe following are examples of where Ukrainian settlers homesteaded in Manitoba and dates of establishment of Ukrainian Churches. Most contained Ukrainian churches and cemeteries that reveal their birthplace in Ukraine. Many of these towns have now been abandoned.\n\nWinnipeg and Area: Between 1901 – 1926, sixteen Ukrainian urban Parish communities were established.\n\nNorth of Winnipeg\n\n1897 Pleasant Hope 1899Gonor 1903Ladywood- Beausejour 1904Brokenhead 1908 East Selkirk 1910-1911Garland 1913Poplarfield 1900-1914 Foley North and Interlake- Gimli, Fraserwood, Arnes, Zbruch, and Komarno 1914-1915Fletcher 1915-1917Rembrandt 1918Silver 1918Meleb 1918Sylvan\n\nDauphin Area\n\n1897Dauphin 1898Trembowla 1900Ethelbert 1902Keld 1903 Mink Creek 1903Zoria 1906Ashville 1918 Pulp River, Cowan, Scalter\n\nSouth and West of Winnipeg\n\n1898 Stuartburn1899 Shoal Lake (Shoyllyk) 1902 Tolstoi1904 Mountain Road near Neepawa 1904 Olha and Lakedale1904 Ozerna and Sandy Lake 1903-1905 Brandon1906 Portage la Prairie 1906 St. Norbert1907 Caliento 1907 Dolyny1909 Glenella 1909 Rivers1909 Zhoda 1910 Roblin1910 Zelena 1911 Hadashville1909-1912 Elma 1913 Lonesland1913-1915 Sopiwnyk 1917 Horod1923 Merridale 1933 Shortdale1937 The Pas 1947 Menzies1949 Flin Flon 1979 Thompson\n\nInformation taken from articles within the following:\n\nUkrainian Catholic Churches of Winnipeg Archeparchy, History of Ukrainian Catholic Churches in Canada, Volume4 by Anna Maria Kowcz-Baran (Saskatoon, 1991)\n\nTimeline of Ukrainian Settlement in Canada and East Selkirk\n\nSeptember 1817 Lord Selkirk granted 100 acres of land at Fort Douglas (Winnipeg) to Andriy Sankowsky (Yankowsky).\n\n1878 CPR lines reached East Selkirk.\n\nJanuary 1880 Engine house or Roundhouse was completed for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR).\n\n1880-1881 The first wooden school house was built in East Selkirk.\n\n1883 The town of East Selkirk was officially incorporated.\n\nSeptember 7, 1891 Ivan Pylypiw and Wasl Eleniak were the first officially recorded arrivals of Ukrainian immigrants in Canada.\n\n1898 The conversion of the Roundhouse to an Immigration shed was deemed ready by Feb.20, 1899 to accept lodgings for up to 2000 people.\n\nFebruary 22, 1899 The first wave of Doukhobors arrived from Russia through the Canadian Homestead Act and Immigration Policy implemented by Clifford Sifton.\n\nApril 22, 1899 The first wave of Galician immigrants arrived at the Immigration Shed in East Selkirk.\n\nSeptember 30, 1906 The Immigration Shed in East Selkirk was closed by government order.\n\nImmigration Online Resources\n\nImmigration to St. Clements- PowerPoint on Red River North Heritage site\n\nhttps://redrivernorthheritage.com/immigration-to-st-clements-powerpoint-presentation-grade-5-6-level/\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway: A Story for Kids- Article on Red River North Heritage site\n\nhttps://redrivernorthheritage.com/the-canadian-pacific-railway-a-story-for-kids/\n\nThe East Selkirk Immigration Shed Experiential Geocache can be accessed through the Red River North Heritage website.\n\nhttps://redrivernorthheritage.com/\n\nHome » Historic Sites and Activities » Experiential Geocache » Site 2: East Selkirk Immigration Hall\n\nVirtual Museum of Canada\n\nhttp://www.virtualmuseum.ca/\n\nTaras Shevchenko Museum Toronto Ontario\n\nhttp://www.infoukes.com/shevchenkomuseum/\n\nCemetery Story 2- Immigrant Families\n\nMr. and Mrs. Wasyl Gerylo\n\nMr. and Mrs. Wasyl Gerylo, 1935 (submitted by M. Gerylo in 1984)\n\nMr. Wasyl Gerylo was born in the Western Ukraine, in the village of Monasterok, the province of Borschiv in the year 1877. He came to Canada with his parents, Jacob and Elena Gerylo in the year 1899 and settled in East Selkirk.\n\nIt was difficult to find employment but finally he was fortunate to be hired by the Canadian Pacific Railway in Ontario. After staying in Canada for five years he returned to his native land. There he married Tekina Luzny and it was there also that their first son Paul was born (1907). That year he came back to Canada with his wife and son and stayed with his parents until they built their first home which was located next to the Canadian Pacific Immigration Hall. This was before the route of the Canadian Pacific Railway was changed.\n\nMr. Gerylo worked at the Van Home farm (which was later purchased by the Searle Grain Company) for fifteen years. During this period, their other children were born. Michael was born in 1908, and later were born Metro (1911), Peter (1914), Stephen (1916), Andrew (1918), Thomas (1923), and a daughter Olga (1925). Another daughter Mary, died at birth.\n\nAfter working at the Van Home farm, he once more found employment with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. The family was large, wages were low, and the sons had difficulty in finding work, and the depression had set in as well.\n\nOne of the sons, Stephen, hoping to find work away from home at the Saskatchewan farms, “hopped the freight” with many others who were doing likewise. But unfortunately, unlike the others, was accidently killed by the train (1932) much to the sorrow of the family.\n\nAs we recall, several years later the Second World War broke out and sons Paul, Michael, Peter, Andrew, and Thomas went to serve their country. Andrew was discharged in 1941 due to ill health. Paul, Michael and Peter were with the armed forces in Canada throughout the duration of the war and Thomas spent two years overseas.\n\nMichael married Jean Melnyk and after the war made their home in East Selkirk. Andrew married Beatrice Bazylewski, lived for several years in East Selkirk, then moved to Winnipeg where he was employed until passing away in 1959 at the age of 41. Metro married Catherine Miller and moved to Brooklyn, U.S.A., where he still resides. Paul, Peter, and Thomas did not marry. Paul was accidentally killed in 1967 at the age of 62. Mrs. Gerylo died in 1959, at the age of 71, four months later than her son Andrew and Mr. Gerylo passed away in 1963 at the age of 88. Peter and Thomas are presently living in East Selkirk and Olga, who married Fred Harrison is farming with her husband in the Mayfield district, just on the outskirts of East Selkirk. Their two sons, David and Dennis, who are employed away from home, still do their share of helping on the farm, particularly in the spring, putting the crop in and harvesting in the fall.\n\nThis article was written in 1984 and printed in the book 1884-1984 East of the Red (Rural Municipality of St. Clements Centennial Book) p. 550\n\nMany of the family members have since passed away.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Kologinski\n\nSubmitted by their daughter Stella Sul in 1984\n\nMy father, Wasyl Kologinski and his brother John immigrated to Canada from Austria in May 1906. They sailed from Belgium and landed in Quebec.\n\nTheir parents, Marcus and Euphrosyne Kologinski sold one acre of their land to pay their son’s fare to Canada, so that they could make a better living in the new land.\n\nWasyl and John first made their way to Winnipeg, being employed with whatever came their way. They also helped build Highway No. 44 to Kenora, Ont. Their brother Michael and sister Mary soon followed. Later their step-brother, Anton, arrived too.\n\nWasyl and Anna Kologinski\n\nWhile living in Winnipeg, Wasyl met Anna Shastko and they were married on Oct. 22, 1907 in the St. Nicholas Ukr. Greek Catholic Church, Winnipeg, by Father A. Filipow.\n\nAnna was born in Jabloniw, Poland, on January 19, 1887 and was baptized according to the Rite of the Roman Catholic Church by Rev. Bochtalowski. My mother’s mother, Marina Solnik and her husband Simon, (Step-father) moved to East Selkirk from Winnipeg. My parents soon followed to make their home here also. Colville Road was only a mud road then.\n\nMy father was employed for a time by the Manitoba Rolling Mills, and together with his brother-in-law, Nick Solnik, operated the ferry for a few years which took the passengers across the Red River. He also farmed on his small acreage.\n\nMy parents had five children, Sophie, Stella, Sally, and twins Johnny and Michael.\n\nTheir first parcel of land was 2 acres which they had to clear by hand. I remember our first home that had a veranda. Many happy hours were spent there, playing school or games. Then father bought another six acres of land and had a much more modern house built on it. In fact, that is the first house that Selkirk Lumber Co. built in East Selkirk.\n\nLater, my Dad purchased another eleven acres on Colville road. I recall that this was the site of a gypsy encampment. Some of the village women would go to have their fortune told. My mother warned us never to go near there because the gypsies had a reputation for kidnapping children. Needless to say, we still made our way there out of curiosity.\n\nI recall my Dad telling us that his father Marcus was a musician and would be gone for days playing at weddings and parties. He forbade his sons to play a musical instrument as he said they would never make good husbands. Nevertheless, my Uncle John pursued his love for music and played the violin at weddings, social functions and entertained his family and friends. My father played the Jew’s Harp and always either sang or whistled while he went about his daily chores. I can still picture him riding his bicycle and leading his two horses to the pasture while whistling or humming a tune. I remember our Christmas and especially Christmas Eve, were occasions I could never forget. There was that special feeling and excitement with Christmas Eve approaching and we were busy making sure all was neat and clean for the holidays. Also, as money was scarce, we made our own homemade gifts.\n\nMother was busy with the cooking and baking and I can recall the lovely aroma of mother frying doughnuts and little prune buns in cooking oil. We would have a real pine Christmas tree and we would make our own Christmas decorations. We would string popcorn and make chains from different colors of crepe paper. We would also hang walnuts and oranges on our tree. To our little minds, this was the most beautiful tree.\n\nAs the much-awaited Christmas Eve arrived, the first star appeared, our father would walk in the door with an armful of hay and say a beautiful greeting and wish all the family a long and happy life. He would place a little of the hay on the table which mother covered with a white tablecloth, and the rest of the hay was put under the table. We had great fun hopping in this hay.\n\nOur grandparents would arrive just in time for supper and then twelve meatless dishes were served. After supper, we all sang Christmas carols and our grandmother would always choose her favourite carols. As the years slipped by, we knew them all by heart. The carollers would also come out and ask permission to sing under the window. Of course, they were always welcome and father would give them some money. We could hardly wait to exchange our few precious gifts. I remember when our parents gave us a little tea set that was our most treasured possession.\n\nDuring the day, relatives and friends would drop in and mother was forever serving food. Yes, I remember, how wonderful it was, with the security and warmth of all the family being together. There will forever be a longing in my heart, if only we could all be together for just one more time.\n\nThis article was written in 1984 and printed in the book 1884-1984 East of the Red (Rural Municipality of St. Clements Centennial Book) p. 63\n\nNazarko Zahayko\n\nSubmitted by Ann Chyborak\n\nNazarko Zahayko was born in Biloze Zlota Galicia Austria on April 3, 1884. Coming to Canada in 1902 as a young man with another man, they stayed in what was then called the Immigration Hall (roundhouse) where they lived. Mr. Zahayko worked at Garson Quarry for many years.\n\nDora Sawchuk was born on Aug. 2, 1894 in Solkol Village Ukraine. She was 10 years old when she came with her parents, Paul and Alexandria Sawchuk to Canada in 1904. They also stayed in the Immigration Hall, until her parents built a log house not far from the CNR tracks and the road that is now called Colville road. Their neighbours were Sharps, Ogonoski’s and Solomka’s.\n\nNazarko Zahayko and Dora Sawchuk got married on Feb. 4, 1910 in the Greek Catholic Church in East Selkirk. There the solemnized marriage of Nazarko Zahayko, son of Jurko Zahayko and Elena Shalogan to Dora Sawchuk, daughter of Paul Sawchuk and Alexandria Kobasa the officiating Clergyman was Rev. J. Kusyj.\n\nNazarko Zahayko, Domka (Dora) Sawchuk and son.\n\nNazarko Zahayko died at 66 years of age on Nov. 20, 1950. Mr. and Mrs. Nazarko Zahayko bought land in East Selkirk and built a house along Coleville road, now across from McLeans P.O. They had five children Nellie, George, Ann, Paul and Doreen. Their neighbours were Kalinski’s, Moses Zegil, Shastko’s and Ewanchuk’s.\n\nNazarko Zahayko was one of the first men to start working when the C.N.R. section line was built in 1914 or 1915. The section of track they had to work on was 7 miles from Gonor to Poplar Park. Mr. Nickolawchuk (Nickey) was the Section Foreman moving in from Portage la Prairie with his family. They lived with Zahayko’s for a year before the C.N.R. Company fixed up a couple of boxcars for their living quarters and that building was 200 feet from the present C.N.R. station.\n\nLater Mr. Lyzun came to East Selkirk as a Section Foreman and Nazarko was the first man they hired and more men, Mr. Casper Ogonoski, Alex Jacyk, Steve Timo and a few others. Nazarko worked for 29 years, summer and winter, and retired in 1942.\n\nMr. Zahayko was active in starting the Greek Orthodox Church and the East Selkirk hall. All the meetings were held in our house before the hail was erected father was the janitor for the hall. He kept all the soft drinks at his house to keep them warm otherwise they would freeze in the hall. When there were any concerts or bazaars in the hall, he would take the drinks, I guess in the sleigh, during the winter. The hall was not too far away and it was heated by wood stoves, 2 heaters and the stove pipes were extended from one end of the hall to the other. Father was janitor for the hall for 7 to 8 years. (in 1920’s)\n\nMrs. Zahayko was a member and cashier for the hall and Church and a member of Benevolent Society and she was active in Ukrainian concerts and Church.\n\nIn 1931, Zahayko’s family moved out from East Selkirk to their other farm north of the Star Hotel where it is now, on Harold St. West, along Cooks Creek. Paul and his family live now on the homesite off St. Peters Road. We moved a good size grainary from East Selkirk to the farm and added a leanto on for a kitchen, the other one room was big and we fit our furniture in nicely. A barn was built first for the animals, we also had horses. When milking the cows was finished, we would take the creamers with milk down to the creek and put them into the ice spring water and bring them up in the morning.\n\nThe way we plastered our house and barn, and chicken coop, was we gathered dry horse manure and got clay from across the CN track, then we got a good size container to make the mixture. (horse manure, clay, straw, warm water and mix this with our feet or hoe until the mixture was ready, in about one or two hours.) First skinny sticks (willow) would be hammered onto the house and barn and coop to hold the clay mixture on, then we would put white wash on when it was dry.\n\nA new house was built in 1941 or 42. Father had two brothers who came from the Ukraine in the 1920’s, Bill and Mike Zahayko. Bill stayed in Canada for a while but went back to his wife in the Ukraine. Mike stayed and helped his brother, Nazarko, brush the land where the present home is now, this was in 1924-25. Mike left us and we don’t know where he went.\n\nMrs. Zahayko used to butcher pigs for winter meat, skin it, open it up and save the blood and two kinds of casing, one for buckwheat sausage and small casings for homemade Easter sausage. The bacon would be cut in square pieces, salted and put into boxes for the summer months. Some bacon was left to make lard for pies. All this is done in the fall.\n\nIn the fall (1930’s) we would sell potatoes to Sharpe’s and Machewski’s Merchants Store and buy bags of sugar, salt, flour, buckwheat and rice. The rest we had our own, poultry, eggs and milk.\n\nWhen the parents bought a cabinet radio, it had a battery with a handle, when the battery died, we would have to take it into Selkirk to get it charged up. In a few days we would have to go and get it. We would go from home across the Red River (wintertime) through the Selkirk Park (winter route), we also had a crystal radio and listened to the Chicago barn dances. Our treat for English Christmas was to go to the show on Boxing Day. We did not get presents like kids get now ($300.00 Coleco). For Ukrainian Christmas, Mrs. Lyzun, the section foreman’s wife, gave us box hankies and we gave them turkey for Christmas, and we survived, life was very exciting.\n\nIn the summer we walked to Selkirk, we took a short cut from East Selkirk Cemetery through the bush. If we went to the park dance hall we had to be on the ferry by 12 P.M. and we walked home in the dark, because there were no electric lights then (1930’s) and it was just gravel on the roads.\n\nOlder people worked hard then, stooking and stacking hay until it got threshed. The way we made our softener for clothes was we would get wood ashes into a container and pour water on it and let it sit for a day or two, because our water from the river was so hard."
