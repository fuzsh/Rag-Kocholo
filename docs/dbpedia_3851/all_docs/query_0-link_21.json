        "text": "I have been reading the History of Eurasia and Central/Eastern Europe for the last 60 years. I have to say that when reading the history of Eastern Europe, it is very difficult to follow the history of any one nation in a linear fashion. This is the best book written on this topic by any historian and believe me I think I have read most of them. The first problem are the histories written by the victors and then histories written by the defeated. Second there is the problem of countries popping up and then disappearing and then popping up and so forth ad nauseum. Third is the problem of multi-national empires. Fourth there are Nations without political borders or a National ruling elite. Fifth the National Elites change their national allegiances. Ultimately we have the book written by Prof. Plokhy and finally all is clear!\n\nTranslation from Ukrainian. Stolen Name, Why Rusyns Turned into Ukrainians is one of his publications where history studies are combined with linguistic research, which made it possible to provide a complete picture of the Ukrainian history through the life of the name of our nation, starting from the earliest years to the present-day. The books reveals precise facts from the history of Ukraine and Russia which make it clear, how easily imperial historians falsely interpreted the facts and even rewrote them deliberately for political purposes of the ruling regime.Y. Nakonechnyi's Stolen Name is a book of great power of persuasion, all statements supported by references to authentic materials and scientific research. Being a profound study, it is nonetheless read as an adventure story, full of exciting events and discoveries. Written in 2001, it seems to contain answers to a great number of questions of today, not only for Ukraine and Russia but also for the whole world.\n\nThis paper is a study of Voltaire's treatment of the Ukrainian Cossack Hetman, Ivan Mazepa, in Voltaire's two histories dealing with eastern Europe, his 'History of Charles XII' and his 'History of the Russian Empire under Peter the Great,' with some reflections upon that famous author's method of \"philosophical history\" and his use of both oral and printed sources."
