Its main cities were Berestia (now Brest), Drahichyn, Kobryn, and Kamianiec. From 1080 to 1150 the land belonged to the Principality of Turów-Pinsk (Turiv-Pynske) {Turów, Pinsk}, later to the principality of Volhynia, and after 1320 to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. From 1569 to 1795 it constituted the Brześć Litewski Voivodeship of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After the third partition of the Commonwealth (1795), the territory was annexed to the Russian Empire."
