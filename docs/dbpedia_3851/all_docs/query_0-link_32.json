Mirgaleev\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available We bring to attention of specialists an undated letter of Ottoman ruler Mehmed II Fatih to the Great Horde khan Ahmad from the collection of famous collector of Ottoman charters Feridun-bey [1, S. 289]. The addressee is the famous ruler of the Great Horde, khan Ahmad. Daulat Khan mentioned in the letter is Nur-Davlet. He was connected with khan Ahmad, and, as indicated by the letter, he had also set in close contact with the Ottomans whose ruler openly declares in a letter that âour sight of benevolence and patronage is directed toward himâ. Thereby the Sultan made it clear to the âprincipalâ Tatar khan Akhmad that Nur-Davlet was under the patronage of the Ottoman Empire. Considering the period of activity of Nur-Davlet in Crimea, presumably the letter was written in 1477. Famous researcher of the Crimean Khanate V.D. Smirnov had already examined the letter and the question of why Ahmad Khan was named the Crimean khan in the title of the letter [2, p. 221â222].\n\nJanybek Khan and Prince Liubartas-Dmitry\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYa.V. Pilipchuk\n\n2013-11-01\n\nFull Text Available This study focuses on the relations between the Volyn principality of Liubartas-Dmitry and the Ulus of Jochi under the rule of Janybek Khan. Liubartas-Dmitry ascended the throne of the Eastern Volyn largely due to the will of Uzbek Khan. The Land of Berestia together with the Eastern Volyn was the Liubartasâ appanage land in Volyn. As Boleslaw-Yuri II, Liubartas-Dmitry was compelled to pay tribute to the Tatars. During the War of the Galicia-Volyn legacy, Liubartas acted as a vassal of the Ulus of Jochi and ally of Uzbek Khan. Liubartasâ relations with Janybek Khan were fundamentally different from his previous relations with Uzbek Khan. Casimir III enjoyed greater sympathy of the Golden Horde khan due to the payment of tribute. Except for the campaign of 1351â1352, Janybek was hostile towards Lithuania. Only the common hostility of the Poles and Hungarians towards the Volyn and Podolia forced the khan of Ulus of Jochi to intervene on the side of the Lithuanians. For Janibek the western vector of his foreign policy was not a priority. He could accept the loss of a tribute from several Slavic principalities in exchange for success on other fronts, more profitable in terms of the spoils of war. Unlike the Koriatoviches and Olelkoviches, the Gediminoviches of Volyn were more peacefully disposed towards the Tatars since during the âGreat Disorderâ their land-holdings did not increase at the expense of Jochid possessions.\n\nTopographic Maps on the Territory of Croatia Editor: Stanislav FrangeÅ¡\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMiljenko Lapaine\n\n2012-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Promotion of the monograph Topographic Maps on the Territory of Croatiawas organized by the Croatian Cartographic Society and held at the Croatian State Archive in Zagreb on April 18, 2012.

Khan Nuclear Smuggling Network\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMolly MacCalman\n\n2016-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Abdul Qadeer Khan, widely viewed as the father of Pakistanâs nuclear weapons program, was arrested on January 31, 2004 for his key role in the black market sale of nuclear technology and equipment to Iran, North Korea, Libya, and possibly others. A.Q. Khanâs nuclear smuggling network prospered throughout the 1980s and 1990s and was linked to middlemen and businesses in over 20 countries. The network offered buyers a menu of both technical expertise and materials with prices ranging from millions to hundreds of millions of dollars. The Khan network was ultimately exposed largely due to years of intelligence gathering by the United States and the United Kingdom. However, very few of the networkâs members have been successfully prosecuted and the demand for nuclear material by both state and non-state actors continues. The exposure of Khanâs network confirmed that a non-state actor could procure and sell a turnkey nuclear weapons program to willing buyers.\n\n78 FR 48539 - Designation of Bahawal Khan, Also Known as Salahuddin Ayubi, Also Known as Bahwal Khan, as a...\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2013-08-08\n\n...

The highest frequency of haplotypes from the cluster of the Genghis Khan's descendants was found in Mongols (34.8%). In Russia, this cluster was found in Altaian Kazakhs (8.3%), Altaians (3.4%), Buryats (2.3%), Tyvans (1.9%), and Kalmyks (1.7%).\n\nThe Christian Nobles at the Court of Great Khan, as Described in Mediaeval European Sources\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVladimÃ­r LiÅ¡ÄÃ¡k\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Research objectives: âMoreover, the chief princes of his whole empire, more than thirty thousand in number, who are called Alans, and govern the whole Orient, are Christians either in fact or in name, calling themselves the Popeâs slaves, and ready to die for the Franks.â With these words John of Marignola, a notable traveller to the Far East in the fourteenth century and a legate to the Great Khan of Cathay, attested in his Cronica Boemorum the presence of certain Christian nobles of the Alan race in the service of the Mongol-Chinese emperor. The immediate impetus for Marignolaâs mission was that in 1336 the Great Khan Ukhaghatu Toghon-TemÃ¼r sent a delegation of sixteen âFranksâ (Franquis, as the Mongols called Europeans, ad Papam, Dominum Christianorum in Franchiam. They brought two letters to the pope: one purporting to be from the Great Khan himself, and the other from certain princes of the Christian Alans in his service. By the coming of the Mongolian legation in Avignon in 1338, we are informed, among others, that the successor of John of Montecorvino, the first archbishop in Khanbalik, had never reached his destination, as well as the other succeeding archbishops to Khanbalik. Research materials: Marignolaâs mission was important not only with its spiritual message, but rather with an excellent choice of gift for the Great Khan. Western messengers brought with them, among the gifts from the Pope in Rome, a singularly auspicious present: a magnificent black horse with white hind hooves. Marignola, in his Cronica Boemorum, identifies the Christian dignitaries at the court of the Great Khan as the Alans. We know of them from earlier sources, but mostly under the generic name âChristiansâ or âNestorian Christiansâ. John of Montecorvino reportedly converted many Alans (he did not mention their name to Roman Catholic Christianity in addition to Armenians in China. According to the Annals of the Yuan Dynasty, in 1229 and\n\nMolecular Genealogy of a Mongol Queen's Family and Her Possible Kinship with Genghis Khan.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLkhagvasuren, Gavaachimed; Shin, Heejin; Lee, Si Eun; Tumen, Dashtseveg; Kim, Jae-Hyun; Kim, Kyung-Yong; Kim, Kijeong; Park, Ae Ja; Lee, Ho Woon; Kim, Mi Jin; Choi, Jaesung; Choi, Jee-Hye; Min, Na Young; Lee, Kwang-Ho\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMembers of the Mongol imperial family (designated the Golden family) are buried in a secret necropolis; therefore, none of their burial grounds have been found. In 2004, we first discovered 5 graves belonging to the Golden family in Tavan Tolgoi, Eastern Mongolia. To define the genealogy of the 5 bodies and the kinship among them, SNP and/or STR profiles of mitochondria, autosomes, and Y chromosomes were analyzed. Four of the 5 bodies were determined to carry the mitochondrial DNA haplogroup D4, while the fifth carried haplogroup CZ, indicating that this individual had no kinship with the others. Meanwhile, Y-SNP and Y-STR profiles indicate that the males examined belonged to the R1b-M343 haplogroup. Thus, their East Asian D4 or CZ matrilineal and West Eurasian R1b-M343 patrilineal origins reveal genealogical admixture between Caucasoid and Mongoloid ethnic groups, despite a Mongoloid physical appearance. In addition, Y chromosomal and autosomal STR profiles revealed that the four D4-carrying bodies bore the relationship of either mother and three sons or four full siblings with almost the same probability. Moreover, the geographical distribution of R1b-M343-carrying modern-day individuals demonstrates that descendants of Tavan Tolgoi bodies today live mainly in Western Eurasia, with a high frequency in the territories of the past Mongol khanates. Here, we propose that Genghis Khan and his family carried Y-haplogroup R1b-M343, which is prevalent in West Eurasia, rather than the Y-haplogroup C3c-M48, which is prevalent in Asia and which is widely accepted to be present in the family members of Genghis Khan. Additionally, Tavan Tolgoi bodies may have been the product of marriages between the lineage of Genghis Khan's Borjigin clan and the lineage of either the Ongud or Hongirad clans, indicating that these individuals were members of Genghis Khan's immediate family or his close relatives.\n\nKhan's lectures handbook of the physics of radiation therapy\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nKhan, Faiz M; Mihailidis, Dimitris\n\n2011-01-01\n\nKhan's Lectures: Handbook of the Physics of Radiation Therapy will provide a digest of the material contained in The Physics of Radiation Therapy.

In particular, this publication contains a translation of the story about the descendants of Bash-Timur (Tash-Timur according to another version. In this story, Abdulgaffar Kyrymi thoroughly reveals the history of the descendants of Bash-Timur â Gyyaseddin and Devlet-Berdi. He also tells how Haji Giray, Devlet-Berdiâs son, became Khan. In addition, he provides information about khan Ulugh Muhammad, Bash-Timurâs cousin. The author provides us with a very interesting and supporting information in a separate addition to the margins of the manuscript. In particular, this addition contains a brief history of the Turkic tribes and inhabitants of Tataristan, birthplace of the Seljuks and Osman family from the Kayi clan. It also tells how the Ottomans took control of Crimea, examines in detail the reasons for this event, it speaks both about Mengli Girayâs education together with Ottoman princes and on the establishment of relations with Emenek-Bek Shirinsky, Chief Karachi of the Khanate. Then it tells about the rule of Muhammad Giray and his death in the war against the Nogays, about the reign of Saadet Giray, a son of Mengli Giray, during whose reign the uprising of Islam Giray took place.\n\nYarlyk of Uzbek Khan Granted to the Franciscans of the Golden Horde in 1314: The Latin Text, Russian Translation, and Commentary\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRoman Hautala\n\n2014-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The present article contains the Latin text, Russian translation, and commentary to the yarlyk of Uzbek khan (1312/13â1341. Uzbek khan granted this yarlyk to the Franciscans of the Golden Horde 20th March, 1314. Apparently, the original text of yarlyk was written in the Khwarezmian idiom of the Kipchak language. However, the original text of yarlyk has not been preserved as well as a number of other yarlyks of the Golden Horde khans, which survived only in the late Russian translation. Fortunately, this yarlyk was translated into Latin and, subsequently, this translation was rewritten by anonymous British copyist in the first half of the 14th century. Arthur Christopher Moule discovered this medieval copy of yarlyk along with several other Franciscan documents in one of the codices (D. Ii. 3.7. stored in the Cambridge University Library. In 1924, Moule published the first and only edition of the yarlykâs copy together with other Franciscan sources, provided with a thorough preface of Michael Bihl. The text of this Uzbekâs yarlyk have never been translated into modern languages. For this reason, the content of yarlyk has been known only to a narrow circle of specialists studying the Catholic missionary activity in the Mongol Empire. In turn, the scholars of the Golden Horde history, including researchers of the Jochid official documentation, have been unaware of this important legal document up to the present time. The content of Uzbek khanâs yarlyk points out that this document was based on the previous yarlyks of khan Mengu-Timur (1267â1282 and khan Tokhta (1291â1312. Thus, the content of yarlyk allows us to define the time of an emergence and future activities of the Franciscans in the territory of the Golden Horde. Furthermore, this information provide further evidence on the religious tolerance practice of the Jochid khans. In this context, the most significant is an indication of the Uzbek khanâs tolerant attitude toward\n\nDerin PaÅaoÇ§lu D.

He wrote his historical work in 1747 according to the Ottoman-Turkish tradition, that is, the author gave detailed information about the history of the prophets since Adam, the history of Islam, Islamic Turkic states, the State of Seljuks and the Ottoman State, Chinggis Khan and his sons. Moreover, he collected most of the information from local sources of that period. But the main part of the work contains the history of Juchi Khan, his children and the history of the Crimea. It is for this reason that Abdulgaffar Kyrymi gives such a detailed genealogy of the Girayids and the sequence of their rules in the Crimean Khanate. Abdulgaffar Kyrymiâs genealogy begins with Chinggis Khan and his daughters (Kuchi Bike, Chechgan Bigim, Tumalyn Bigim, Elyatun Bigim, Turaly Bigim as well as with his 500 wives. But only five of them were respected: Borte Kuchin Biim, Kulan Bigim, Suyugan Khatun Bigim, KÃ¶kchi Bigim, Jeksulu Bigim. List of the Crimean dynasty of the Girayids is offered here to specialists, beginning with Haji Giray to Arslan Giray. Comparison of the list of the Girayid khans contained in âUmdet al-Akhbarâ with researches on this topic reveals some differences. In the opinion of the author, to solve these problems, along with genealogical and other narrative sources, it is also necessary to use the numismatics data and a large corpus of letters of the Crimean khans to the rulers of various countries.\n\nManaging Tourism in the Greater Mekong Region (GMS: A Case Study of Chiang Khan Community, Northeast Thailand\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRawee Hanpachern\n\n2014-05-01\n\nFull Text Available This study aims to examine complex âsustainabilityâ aspects of the Community-based tourism concept in tourism and destination management in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS. This research is conceptualized in assessing the potential for Community-Based Tourism (CBT development in Chiang Khan, a small village by the Mekong River in the Northeast of Thailand. For collecting data, semi-interviews questions are designed. Focus-group discussion and indepth interviews are carried to include tourism stakeholders of the destination. This study argues that although a community may contain many tourism assets, it is not the only factor necessary for a âsustainableâ tourism to be developed in that community. Through a case study, its natural features, cultural activities, local lifestyle and the serene landscape of its location are exemplified as the important community-based tourism assets. However, a number of complex components and holistic approaches that worked well together Chiang Khan becoming a sustainable tourism destination. There elements and approaches that contribute to starting up Chiang Khan as a sustainable tourist destination include: its unique features of recreational activities and local businesses, knowledge and skills of the locals to develop tourism related businesses, and direct proper marketing strategies.\n\nMehmed Senai: A Crimean Historian at Sarai of Khan Islam Giray Â»\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRefat Rustem ogly Abduzhemilev\n\n2015-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The article is devoted to the creative work of Mehmed Senai â the Crimean chronicler at the serai of the khan Islam Geray III, as well as his chronicle âTarih-i Islam Geray khanâ (âHistory of the khan Islam Geray IIIâ, 1651. The researcher gives biographical information about the author and a brief description of the source. The identity of the writer is defined and based on the text of the Preface to the Chronicle: background, education, position, religious status. The meaning of the pseudonym of Senai is under the study, the text of the chronogram in which it occurs is reproduced. Especially noted thing is the originality of the artistic structure of the Chronicle âTarih-i Islam Geray khanâ.The Chronicle âTarih-i Islam Geray khanâ is the panegyric to the Crimean khan Islam Geray whose reign represents the brilliant epoch in the history of the Crimean Khanate. The writing consists of the ceremonies of public appointments, episodes of military campaigns and making treaties, the text of khan Islam Gerayâs pedigree (shejere, construction and repair of buildings. There is the brief information about the Chronicle and about M. Senai in âCatalogue of the Turkish Manuscripts in the British Museumâ (1888. The primary work on writing was conducted by Polish orientalists who prepared the edition of the original text, its translation and processing, backed with comments. At the time of writing the Chronicle, Mehmed Senai was in his old age, he served as the kadi (religious judge. In his youth he worked as munshi (decorator of papers in the khanâs office. He got education in the Ottoman Empire, and was engaged in the implementation of diplomatic correspondence. The prospect of identification of the author on the basis of other sources is important to clarify the hypothesis of identifying M. Senai with such Crimean Tatar author as Dzhanmuhammed. The ChronÄ±cleâs plot consists of the diary notes on the military expeditions\n\nLes transformations d'un mythe d'origine L'exemple de Gengis Khan et de Tamerlan\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDenise Aigle\n\n2009-05-01\n\nFull Text Available La figure de Gengis Khan, grand conquÃ©rant et fondateur de dynastie, correspond Ã©troitement Ã la figure du hÃ©ros. Sa vie est jalonnÃ©e des signes d'un destin extraordinaire, en particulier sa naissance prÃ©sentÃ©e comme miraculeuse, dont le rÃ©cit a Ã©tÃ© transformÃ© Ã mesure que ses descendants puis ses Ã©pigones s'Ã©loignaient des origines mongoles chamaniques du grand ancÃªtre. Le rÃ©cit de la naissance de Gengis Khan se rattache d'abord au mythe d'origine des Mongols qui descendraient de Â«Â Loup-bleuÂ Â» et de Â«Â Biche-FauveÂ Â», rÃ©cit lui-mÃªme visiblement inspirÃ© du mythe des Turcs. Selon {'Histoire secrÃ¨te des Mongols, de peu postÃ©rieure Ã la mort de Gengis Khan, l'ancÃªtre de celui-ci, Alan-Qo'a, veuve, aurait Ã©tÃ© fÃ©condÃ©e par un Ãªtre Â«Â qui sortait en rampant tel un chien jauneÂ Â».

Hautala\n\n2016-07-01\n\nFull Text Available The author of this article presents the content of selected Latin sources on the Franciscan missionary activity on the territory of the Golden Horde in the 14th century. These sources are of particular interest for the study of the history of the ulus of Jochi since they were written within the Golden Horde during the reign of khan Uzbek (1312â1341. In particular, these sources contain valuable information about religious policy of the rulers of the ulus of Jochi, which allows us to re-evaluate the process of the spread of Islam in the Golden Horde and the degree of Islamization of nomads during the reign of khan Uzbek. First, the author presents the yarlyk that khan Uzbek granted to the Minorites of Kaffa in 1314. The author points to specific conformity of its content with well-known yarlyks granted by the Golden Horde khans to the metropolitans of the Orthodox Church of Rusâ. This yarlyk of Uzbek is essential for clarifying the nature of Uzbekâs religious policy in the initial period of his reign. Its information allows us to review the accuracy of the information contained in the well-known Muslim sources. Further, the author points to the importance of the information contained in a later letter by the Franciscans of Caffa, sent by them to the West in 1323. This letter mentions the substantial proselytizing successes of the Franciscans and, more importantly, indicates that Uzbekâs administration did not obstruct the Minoritesâ missionary activities deployed by them among the nomads of the ulus of Jochi. At the end of the article, the author pays attention to frequent conflicts between the Catholics and Muslim residents of the Golden Horde and focuses on the information of the Latin sources, which allows us to determine the reasons for these conflicts.\n\nMedicinal folk recipes used as traditional phyto therapies in district Dera Ismail Khan, KPK, Pakistan\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMarwat, S.K.; Rehman, F.; Khan, M.A.; Ahmad, M.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis paper is based on the results of an ethno medicinal research work conducted in Dera Ismail Khan (D.I. Khan) District, Khyber Pakhtun Khwa (KPK), Pakistan, during May 2006 to March 2007. The study was focused for documentation of traditional knowledge of local people about the use of medicinal folk recipes of native plants. During field survey, questionnaires were used to interview the local inhabitants, older people including men and women both, who were familiar with traditional uses of indigenous plants. In total 40 new medicinal folk recipes of 26 plant species, belonging to 19 families were recorded. These folk recipes are used as traditional phyto therapies in the area. Plant specimens were identified, preserved and vouchers were deposited in the Department of Botany, Quaid-i-University Islamabad for future references. Results were systematically arranged by alphabetic order of botanical names followed by medicinal folk recipes. English name, local name, family name and voucher no., were listed.

Ponomarev\n\n2013-11-01\n\nFull Text Available Four account books of the Genoese colony in Caffa kept in 1420â1426 by its treasurers (massarii are still unpublished as a whole. Almost four hundreds records in these manuscripts deal with the Tartar-Genoese relations and the political situation in Crimea. Combined with the numismatic data and evidences from chronicles and state correspondence they let the author to ascertain up to weeks and days the chronology of khansâ reign. After the death of the first Crimean khan Bek Sufi in 1421 his brother Dawlat Berdi (the kinship became evident from these records struggled for power with his cousin Ulugh Muhammed, khan of the Golden Horde, for six years and climbed to the Solhat throne four times. The newly obtained information proves that neither Bek Sufi nor Dawlat Berdi, cannot be treated as the khans of the Golden Horde. They were two of the first members of the Tukatimurid dynasty which came to power in Crimea. The separatism and the might of the Crimean tribal beks were a real reason and basis for forming this independent khanate. The same beks reestablished the dynasty in 1441 having invited to the throne Haji Giray, nephew of both khans, who gave his name to the dynasty of the state, established in 1419. It was necessary to use original Latin texts to understand the history that accompaied the research.\n\nGeographical information system based model of land suitability for good yield of rice in prachuap khiri khan province, thailand\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHussain, W.; Sohaib, O.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nCorrect assessment of land is a major issue in agricultural sector to use possible capability of any land, to raise cultivation and production of rice. Geographical Information System (GIS) provides broad techniques for suitable land classifications. This study is GIS based on land suitability analysis for rice farming in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province, Thailand, where the main livelihood of people is rice farming. This analysis was conducted considering the relationship of rice production with various data layers of elevation, slope, soil pH, rainfall, fertilizer use and land use. ArcView GIS 3.2 software is used to consider each layer according to related data to weight every coefficient, ranking techniques are used. It was based on determining correlation of rice production and these variables. This analysis showed a positive correlation with these variables in varying degrees depending on the magnitude and quality of these factors. By combining both data layers of GIS and weighted linear combination, various suitable lands have been developed for cultivation of rice. Integrated suitable assessment map and current land were compared to find suitable land in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province of Thailand. As a result of this comparison, we get a land which is suitable for optimum utilization for rice production in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province.

He then traces back the history of global communication to Denghis Khan and his arrow riders to end up with the modern forms developed by the different generations of distance education with special emphasis on the mega universities . Although communication is dominated today by iPads and smart phones Baggaley points out that important concepts how to bring online media to the population and to convert the recipients of that information into contributors (user generated content have been developed much earlier e.g. by the Polish filmmaker Dziga Vertov about one hundred years ago. So Baggaley always tries to put actual media development into a historical context that includes parallel developments and trends in music or painting as well.\n\nThe Christian Nobles at the Court of Great Khan, as Described in Mediaeval European Sources\n\nCzech Academy of Sciences Publication Activity Database\n\nLiÅ¡ÄÃ¡k, VladimÃ­r\n\n2017-01-01\n\nRoÄ. 5, Ä. 2 (2017), s. 276-289 ISSN 2308-152X Institutional support: RVO:68378009 Keywords : religion in mediaeval China * Yuan Dynasty China * Christianity in the Great Khan court * Franciscan missions * Christian Alan nobility * Western mediaeval sources Subject RIV: AB - History OBOR OECD: History (history of science and technology to be 6.3, history of specific sciences to be under the respective headings)\n\nInvestigating the Use of the Khan Academy and Mathematics Software with a Flipped Classroom Approach in Mathematics Teaching\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZengin, Yilmaz\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the flipped classroom approach designed by using Khan Academy and free open source software on students' academic achievement and to examine students' views about this approach.

Historical data and interview questionnaire. Data were obtained from the Palestinian Ministry of Health on total and faecal coliform contamination in water wells and distribution networks, and on the incidence of water-related diseases in Khan Yunis Governorate. An interview questionnaire was conducted with 210 residents of Khan Yunis Governorate. Total and faecal coliform contamination exceeded the World Health Organization's limit for water wells and networks. However, the contamination percentages were higher in networks than in wells. Diarrhoeal diseases were strongly correlated with faecal coliform contamination in water networks (r=0.98). This is consistent with the finding that diarrhoeal diseases were the most common self-reported diseases among the interviewees. Such diseases were more prevalent among subjects who drank municipal water than subjects who drank desalinated or home-filtered water (odds ratio=2.03). Intermittent water supply, insufficient chlorination and sewage flooding seem to be associated with self-reported diseases. Residents in the Gaza Strip have a good level of knowledge about drinking water contamination, and this is reflected in good practice. Water quality has deteriorated in the Gaza Strip, and this may contribute to the prevalence of water-related diseases. Self-reported diseases among interviewees in Khan Yunis Governorate were associated with source of drinking water, intermittent water supply, insufficient chlorination, sewage flooding and age of water networks.\n\nResearch on efficiency test of a turbine in Khan Khwar hydropower station\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZhang, H K; Liang, Z; Deng, M G; Liu, X B; Wang, H Y; Liu, D M\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe efficiency test is an important indicator to evaluate the energy conversion performance of a hydraulic turbine. For hydropower stations which do not have the direct flow measurement conditions, whether the characteristic curve of a turbine obtained through similarity theory conversion by using the comprehensive characteristic curve of the turbine can correctly reflect the operating performance of the prototype unit is a key issue in this industry. By taking the No.1 unit of Khan Khwar hydropower station as the example, the efficiency test of this turbine was studied on the site, including the measurement method of test parameters, the configuration of the computer test system, as well as the processing and analysis of test data.\n\nVIDEO PRIKAZ VIZUALIZACIJE DOÅ½IVLJAJA ENGLESKE PJESME KUBLA KHAN UZ POMOÄ ALATA ZA OBRADU MULTIMEDIJE\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nStojakoviÄ, Biljana; PopoviÄ, Mihaela\n\n2017-01-01\n\nU radu je prikazan naÄin na koji je uz pomoÄ alata multimedije postignuta vizualizacija doÅ¾ivljaja poznate engleske pjesme Kubla Khan, osebujnog autora Samuela Taylora Coleridgea.

It does not accompany the pain that usually occurs after resection of the sensitive anoderm. This study was carried out to evaluate the clinical outcome of stapled hemorrhoidopexy at The Aga Khan University Hospital. A sample of 140 patients with symptomatic second-, third-, and fourth-degree hemorrhoids and circumferential mucosal prolapse underwent stapled hemorrhoidopexy from July 2002 to July 2007. They were evaluated for postoperative morbidity, analgesic requirement, and recurrence. Seventy-eight percent were males and the mean age was 45 (range 16-90) years. The mean operative time was 35 (15-78) min. The mean parenteral analgesic doses during the first 24 h were 2.1. All patients received oral analgesics alone after 24 h. No significant postoperative morbidity was observed. The mean in-patient hospital stay was 1.3 (0-5) days. Patients were followed-up for 24 (range, 2-48) months. Minor local recurrence of hemorrhoids was seen in four patients and was managed by band ligation. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy procedure was found safe, well tolerated by patients with minimal parenteral analgesic use and early discharge from the hospital.

Khan, Pakistan\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAhmad, M.; Ahmad, S.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nA study was conducted on water rights, water allocation and local institutions prevailing in the perennial spate irrigation systems of Mithawan watershed o D.G. Khan District of Punjab. The Study Area was selected is the Mthawan watershed on the D.G. Khan-Quetta Road almost 70 kms from D.G. Khan and 10 km away from the road, representing real-life operating systems. Small-scale isolated and large-scale contiguous perennial spate irrigation systems were selected for study. A three-prong methodology was designed covering (a) interactive dialogue of the focus groups to document the community-perceptions regarding systems water-rights, water allocation and local institution prevailing in the area; (b) structured interviews to document systematic data regarding some of the study-aspects; and (c) diagnostic surveys to document some of the measured data regarding scheme performance. Water rights and allocation procedures both in small-scale isolated and large-scale Contiguous perennial spate irrigation-system are very clearly defined and do not change with time and space. Local institutions like Biradri and Muchi take care of just allocation of water. An irrigator is deputed who takes care of allocated time among various tribes. At the same time, the community is bringing more area under irrigation. Obviously it has increased water-requirements and in turn management of irrigation system. Previously they were reconstructing the diversion structure only. Present expansion in irrigated area has increased the necessity of maintaining the water-conveyance network more frequently, particularly at critical sections. However, the realization regarding water-losses still needs to be promoted. The linkages of resource-management with water-productivity are going to be the future area of consideration in theses systems, due to expansion of the system largely because of increased population and urge to increase their livelihood.

Over 10K online volunteers contributed 30K hours (3.4 years, examined 6,000 kmÂ², and generated 2.3 million feature categorizations. Motivated by the search for Genghis Khan's tomb, participants were tasked with finding an archaeological enigma that lacks any historical description of its potential visual appearance. Without a pre-existing reference for validation we turn towards consensus, defined by kernel density estimation, to pool human perception for \"out of the ordinary\" features across a vast landscape. This consensus served as the training mechanism within a self-evolving feedback loop between a participant and the crowd, essential driving a collective reasoning engine for anomaly detection. The resulting map led a National Geographic expedition to confirm 55 archaeological sites across a vast landscape. A increased ground-truthed accuracy was observed in those participants exposed to the peer feedback loop over those whom worked in isolation, suggesting collective reasoning can emerge within networked groups to outperform the aggregate independent ability of individuals to define the unknown.\n\nCartographic Anxieties in Mongolia: The Bogd Khan's Picture-Map\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nUranchimeg Tsultemin,\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This article extends cartography into ethnographic and representational practices for territorial inclusion (Hostetler 2005 and nation building (Krishna 1994. Outer Mongolia, a vassal state of the Qing Empire until 1911, produced ethnographic paintings intended as new cartographic visuals around the time of its independence. Mongoliaâs last ruler, the Bogd Khan (1870â1924 commissioned the artist Balduugin Sharav to produce a large painting of the Mongol countryside titled Daily Events, a work that constitutes an unusual cartographic âpicture-mapâ (Paul Harvey 1980 intended for a special public display. The work (now known as One Day in Mongolia depicts the Mongolian people as a distinct ethnic group in quotidian scenes of Central Mongolian (Khalkha nomadic life. This article demonstrates how the covert connections between the scenes together construct a Buddhist didactic narrative of the Wheel of Life, and argues that this picture-map was the result of the Tibetan-born rulerâs anxieties over ethnic identity, national unity, and the survival of his people, who strove for independence from the Qing, as well as their safe positioning vis-Ã -vis new political neighbors.\n\nSurgical wisdom and Genghis Khan's Pax Mongolica.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKÃ¶stenbauer, Jakob\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThe unrivalled conquests of Genghis Khan (CE c.1162-1227) led to the establishment of the Greater Mongolian Empire. By 1279, the Mongol dynasty controlled a vast Empire which, for the first time in history, unified Europe and China via the famous Silk Road. The ensuing century of peace and stability is referred to by historians as the Pax Mongolica, which facilitated Europe's renaissance and remarkably contributed to the rise of modern medicine and surgery. Secondary sources from published literature, primary sources from manuscripts and illustrations courtesy of universities, museum libraries and archives. There is ample evidence detailing the Mongol Empire's power during the thirteenth century and the Silk Road's role as a vehicle of commercial, cultural and scientific exchange. Advances in medical knowledge and surgical skills were made in all parts of the Empire and exchanged from China to Constantinople and back. Prominent medical figures traversed these centres, and no doubt contributed to the spread of surgical science, including Rashid al-Din and Mansur Ibn Ilyas. Their works, it is argued, enriched the practice of surgery and may have indirectly ushered-in the rise of modern surgery in the early medical schools at Salerno, Bologna, Pavia, Oxford, Montpellier and Constantinople to name but a few. The blossoming and diversification of medical and surgical knowledge was an integral part of the great cultural exchange facilitated by the Pax Mongolica. This enhanced surgical practice in China, Persia and Arabia, while coinciding with the renaissance of surgical teaching in Europe.

In 2004, we first discovered 5 graves belonging to the Golden family in Tavan Tolgoi, Eastern Mongolia. To define the genealogy of the 5 bodies and the kinship among them, SNP and/or STR profiles of mitochondria, autosomes, and Y chromosomes were analyzed. Four of the 5 bodies were determined to carry the mitochondrial DNA haplogroup D4, while the fifth carried haplogroup CZ, indicating that this individual had no kinship with the others. Meanwhile, Y-SNP and Y-STR profiles indicate that the males examined belonged to the R1b-M343 haplogroup. Thus, their East Asian D4 or CZ matrilineal and West Eurasian R1b-M343 patrilineal origins reveal genealogical admixture between Caucasoid and Mongoloid ethnic groups, despite a Mongoloid physical appearance. In addition, Y chromosomal and autosomal STR profiles revealed that the four D4-carrying bodies bore the relationship of either mother and three sons or four full siblings with almost the same probability. Moreover, the geographical distribution of R1b-M343-carrying modern-day individuals demonstrates that descendants of Tavan Tolgoi bodies today live mainly in Western Eurasia, with a high frequency in the territories of the past Mongol khanates. Here, we propose that Genghis Khan and his family carried Y-haplogroup R1b-M343, which is prevalent in West Eurasia, rather than the Y-haplogroup C3c-M48, which is prevalent in Asia and which is widely accepted to be present in the family members of Genghis Khan. Additionally, Tavan Tolgoi bodies may have been the product of marriages between the lineage of Genghis Khanâs Borjigin clan and the lineage of either the Ongud or Hongirad clans, indicating that these individuals were members of Genghis Khanâs immediate family or his close relatives.

It is affected by variable environmental conditions throughout the country which limits its production. A 2-year field study was conducted in 2012 and 2013 at Cotton Research Station, Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan to evaluate the effects of six sowing dates on yield and quality attributes of four cotton genotypes. The experiments were laid out in split-plot within a randomized complete block design with three replications. Main plots treatments were six sowing dates, namely March 20, April 4, April 19, May 4, May 19, and June 3 while subplots treatments were four approved transgenic varieties of cotton (CIM-598, CIM-599, CIM-602, and Ali Akber-703). Results revealed that earlier planting produced more vegetative growth rather than lint yield while late planting induced flowering and boll formation when temperature was much cold that adversely affected cotton yield and quality. The results further indicate that the genotype CIM-599 scored first rank in number of bolls plant-1, boll weight, seed cotton yield, ginning out turn, fiber length, fiber strength, fiber fineness, and fiber uniformity when sown on April 19. CIM-598 was the next suitable genotype after CIM-599 which produced higher yield and quality traits in April 19 sowing. Earlier and later sowing than April 19 resulted in lower cotton yield and quality characters due to unfavorable environmental conditions and shorter growth period, respectively. Thus it is concluded that the genotype, CIM-599 sown on April 19 suits well to the study area and had the potential to optimize cotton yield and quality in irrigated condition of Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan.

This codex (588 folios contains Italian and Latin texts of the 16th century of extremely diverse content, which does not allow to determe neither the name of the author of the reproduced letter, nor the date of its writing. Nevertheless, a reference to the name of âLutherâ in the letter suggests that it must have been written in the 16th century and an indication of the main purpose of the letter â matchmaking to anonymous queen â makes it possible to put forward quite a bold (but, for now, unproven hypothesis that this letter might be addressed to approximates of the Polish Queen Bona Sforza and the widow of King Sigismund I the Old starting with the April 1, 1548. Following this hypothesis, the alleged author of the letter could be the ruler of Astrakhan Yamgurchi or the Crimean khan Sahib Giray. However, this assumption remains only a hypothesis, and the author of this article hopes that future researchers will be able to identify both the author of the letter and its recipients. Be that as it may, this letter is of undoubtedly fictitious character since it does not indicate the name of its author and the date of writing and obviously differs from official form of the Tatar rulersâ letters. Undoubtedly, this letter refers to the literary genre of fictional letters of the rulers, which became extremely popular in Europe since the second half of the 15th century. As an illustration of this genre, the author of this article presents a âletterâ of the Turkish sultan to the Tatars and their âresponseâ from the fictional collection of âLetters of the Great Turkâ [1, fol. 18r] of Laudivius Hierosolymitanus, which was a relatively widespread in Europe in the\n\nClimate change, poverty and agricultural resource degradation: a case study of district d.g. khan\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nImran, M.; Bano, S.; Dawood, M.; Tarar, M.A.; Ali, A.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nGlobal development agendas are now being bonded with adaptation to climate change. Sustainable biodiversity and community adaptation to climate change are closely associated as depletion of natural resources adversely affects the living standard of people. Rapid climatic changes and intervention to regulate water resources in Indus delta of Pakistan have put the lives of millions of people residing near the Indus river belt at the stake of climate change. Therefore, this study was designed to inquire the socio-economic conditions of the people residing near the Indus river bank and the perceived impact of climate change on river belt agricultural resources specifically in district D. G. Khan. Based on primary data study employed univariate and bivariate analysis which suggested flood, wind storm and temperature as the significant climate change parameters affecting the land fertility, forest and fisheries. The Foster Greer and Thorbeck technique for calculating the poverty indicated that majority (82%) of population was below poverty line and most of them entirely depend on river belt agricultural resources which were found to be depleting due to rapid climate change.

Maslyuzhenko\n\n2014-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The author of this article identifies the daily and political traditions in the Khanate of Abu al-Khair, which researchers traditionally call the âState of nomadic Uzbeksâ. This State was created in the south of Western Siberia in the 1430âs and annexed by military means to the land of Shibanâs (the younger brother of Batu descendants. The overwhelming majority of researchers consider it as a Muslim State since its very foundation, substantiating their allegations by indication both on the reading of khutba in honor of Khan after he took the âthrone of Sain Khanâ and on the presence of the sheikhs and Sufis in his entourage. At the same time, the authority of Abu al-Khair had the strong support of nomadic elite of more than twenty tribes. Precisely this elite, its inquiries and interests, which were advocated on the nobility councils, formed the existing political and daily traditions. These traditions reflect the preservation of Turko-Mongol customs among nomadic populations. We can find analogies of these practices in the earlier customs among the precursors of post-Golden Horde State, i.e., in the Mongol Empire and the ulus of Jochi. Traditions of the Abu al-Khairâs Khanate represented a phenomenon of cultural inertia, which were restored in the conditions of Islamization and could become the adats. This effect is particularly significant in view of the specific attitude of Sufi tariqats to the phenomena of social life. In political terms, of particular importance among these was the restoration of the Toy and the related kurultay that could take place in accordance with the existing steppe (animals calendar. The khans restored the ritual of robes and beltsâ distribution as the main mechanism for redeployment of posts and responsibilities among the steppe aristocracy. Military tradition was also focused on samples of the previous time, which was particularly manifested in the selection of wings and avant-garde.

A research on the feasibility of new planting techniques (direct seeding on flat, transplanting on flat, direct seeding on ridges, transplanting on ridges and parachute planting in transplanted and direct wet-seeded rice was undertaken at Dera Ismail Khan region of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province during 2002 and 2003. Among the planting techniques, the best performance for the yield formation and economic evaluation was noted for transplanting on flat during both years. Chinese parachute planting technology also showed very promising results in most of the parameters. Direct seeding on ridges could not excel transplanting on flat and parachute planting during both cropping seasons. The findings concluded the feasibility of parachute planting technology along with traditional rice transplanting on flat over all other planting techniques being practiced in the area.\n\nEffect of different plant spacing on the production of cauliflower (Brassica oleraceae var.

It is a stare of over-nutrition with long-term complications such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and coronary artery disease and type-2 diabetes. Underweight is the result of under nutrition leading to reduction in growth and development of every body organ especially the Central Nervous System. Long-term under-nutrition causes failure in linear growth (height) of the child. Growth is further retarded by the repeated attacks of respiratory infections, diarrhea and anemia as a result of reduced immunity. This study was carried, out eight primary schools of Dera Ismail Khan (Private, semi government organizations, and welfare foundations) having mixed population with some of the wards belonging to high socioeconomic group. Thorough clinical examination excluded those suffering from chronic heath problems. Height and weight of each one was taken body mass index of determined according to 'Quatelet's' index.

Initially, the lesion was 1-2 cm in size but gradually increased to a visible-pronounced tumor-like formation. No other dermatologic diseases, neither other known abnormalities were reported for the medical and family history.Â Softly-elastic on palpation tumor-like formation was established in the left infrascapular area of the back, measuring 8/9 cm in diameter. The lesion was clinically suspected for lipoma or another soft-tissue tumour with benign nature, so the patient underwent planned surgical excision under local anaesthesia. A tumour was excited with deep elliptical excision and furthered for histological evaluation, while the wound edges were sutured with single cutaneous stitches. Additionally, a large black-colored tattoo of the Bulgarian historical noble Khan Krum was also observed within the clinical examination, covering almost the whole upper 1/3 part of the patientâs back Within the careful clinical observation of the tattoo, we noticed a fibroma-like lesion, affecting the nobleâs right iris. Fibromas are common benign tumours in Caucasians, composed of fibrous or connective tissue. They can be seen in all organs from mesenchymal tissue, in varies size. Eyelids are often commonly affected in elderly. Although very commonly seen in every day dermatological practice, fibromas have been never reported, located in the iris. In the presented case, a small Êºiris-fibromaÊº, hidden within a black-colored tattoo was diagnosed in a patient with lipoma, as a sporadic clinical finding.\n\nReview of the Monograph: Seleznev Yu.V.

Seleznev published in early 2017 and dedicated to the relations of Russian princes with the Golden Hordeâs khans and their status among the Golden Hordeâs nobility. This work is the first comprehensive study in the historiography of this issue for all two and a half centuries of the Tartar domination. The monograph was published for the first time in 2013 and served as the basis for a doctoral dissertation, which Seleznev defended in 2015. The book was reprinted with certain changes in 2017. The book commendably contains an abundance of factual material through the use of diverse sources and strands of historiography. Seleznev examines the social terminology of Golden Horde-Russian relations, the structure of the Golden Hordeâs nobility and the trips of princes to the Horde, drawing attention not only to the status of the great Vladimir and Moscow princes, but also that of other great and appanage princes. He makes a significant contribution to the resolving the debate regarding the nature of the Golden Hordeâs domination in Rusâ by examining in detail the relationship of the Russian princes with the Golden Hordeâs authorities in different years. The bookâs author proposed to divide the Golden Hordeâs âyokeâ into seven periods characterized by âchanges in the degree of sovereignty and jurisdiction of the khan in relation to Russian principalitiesâ. The author of this review agrees with the main conclusions of the book under review, but at the same time he notes some reservations and criticisms, which do not, however, reduce the academic caliber of the monograph.\n\nNatural radioactivity, dose assessment and uranium uptake by agricultural crops at Khan Al-Zabeeb, Jordan\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAl-Kharouf, Samer J.; Al-Hamarneh, Ibrahim F.; Dababneh, Munir\n\n2008-01-01\n\nKhan Al-Zabeeb, an irrigated cultivated area lies above a superficial uranium deposits, is regularly used to produce vegetables and fruits consumed by the public. Both soil and plant samples collected from the study area were investigated for their natural radioactivity to determine the uranium uptake by crops and hence to estimate the effective dose equivalent to human consumption. Concentrations of 238 U, 235 U, 232 Th, 226 Ra, 222 Rn, 137 Cs and 40 K in nine soil profiles were measured by gamma-ray spectrometry whereas watermelon and zucchini crops were analyzed for their uranium content by means of alpha spectrometry after radiochemical separation. Correlations between measured radionuclides were made and their activity ratios were determined to evaluate their geochemical behavior in the soil profiles. Calculated soil-plant transfer factors indicate that the green parts (leaves, stems and roots) of the studied crops tend to accumulate uranium about two orders of magnitude higher than the fruits. The maximum dose from ingestion of 1 kg of watermelon pulp was estimated to be 3.1 and 4.7 nSv y -1 for 238 U and 234 U, respectively. Estimations of the annual effective dose equivalent due to external exposure showed extremely low values.

Majority of population in this region obtain domestic water from tube wells, dug wells, ponds, stored run off of the Indus and Gomal rivers and perennial streams. This study is aimed to determine the physio-chemical contaminants in the surface and subsurface water which could cause environmental problem. For this purpose, representative water sample were collected from tube wells, dug wells, streams and rivers. These analyses were performed using Hach DR/2000 spectrophotometer and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer. Chemically both surface and subsurface water samples of the area were classified as alkaline fresh water. The comparison of the data with standard limits set by Word Health Organization (WHO) for drinking water suggested that in certain areas of the division, the drinking water samples have high concentrations of Total Dissolved Solids, NO/sub 3//sup 2-/, SO/sub 4//sup 2-/, F-, Cl-, Fe/sup 2+/, Ca/sup 2+/, Mg/sup 2+/, Pb/sup 2+/, Ni/sup 2+/ and Cd/sup 2+/ while pH, EC, HCO/sub 3/-, PO/sub 4//sup 3-/, Na/sup +/, Mn/sup 2+/, K/sup +/, Cr/sup 3+/ and Zn/sup 2+/ were within the permissible limits.

This study evaluated pesticide contamination of groundwater in four intensive cotton growing districts. Water samples were collected from 37 rural open wells in the areas of Bahwalnagar, Muzafargarh, D.G. Khan and Rajan Pur districts of Punjab and analysed for eight pesticides which are mostly used. Information on types of pesticide used and distance to nearest pesticide mixing area and application areas was obtained for each site. From the eight pesticides analysed, six pesticides were detected in the water samples. Only cypermethrin and cabosulfan were not detected. The percentage of detection of bifenthrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, carbofuran, endosulfan, methyl parathion and monocrotophos was, respectively 13.5%, 5.4%, 59.4%, 8%, 5.4% and 35.1% in July; 16.2%, 13.55%, 43.2%, 8%, N.D. (not detected) and 24.3% in October. Maximum contamination levels (MCLs) established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for drinking water were not exceeded. The study has shown the need for monitoring pesticide contamination in rural water resources, and the development of drinking water quality standards for specific pesticides in Pakistan. The conclusions and recommendations will be disseminated to senior decision makers in central and local governments, extension agents and farmers.\n\nUroki mastera, ili Fantazii na temÃµ Andersena / Boris Tuch\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nTuch, Boris, 1946-\n\n2007-01-01\n\nEldar Rjazanovi eluloofilm muinasjutuvestja Hans Christian Anderseni elust \"Andersen.

N. MAMIN-SIBIRYAK\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nValentina I. Gabdullina\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The article studies the special aspects of the authorâs conception of the East and the principles of the reconstruction of the way of life and mentality of the Turks in âEastern legendsâ by D. N. Mamin-Sibiryak within the context of the general interest the Russian literature of the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries experienced toward orientalism. Based on the âLegend of the Siberian Khan, Old Kuchumâ the process of evolution of the poetic stylization into an individual and authorâs version of the genre form is analyzed, as a result of comprehension, aesthetic mastering and the embodiment of the culture of another nation, folkloristic and mythological figurativeness in the artistic text of the Russian writer. In the âLegendâ¦â there is clearly seen the aspiration of the author to show life of the nomadic people âinternallyâ, to look beyond the existing estimative stereotypes about Siberian peoples set in the perception of the Russian in the period of the conquest of Siberia by the troops of the Russian Tsar with ataman Yermak at the head. For the purpose of a comparative analysis the annalistic sources are used (the Esipovsky chronicle. The research is conducted from the perspective of cultural and historical, imagological and motive approaches.\n\nInvestigating Potential Artesian Aquifers in Rod-Kohi Area of DI Khan, NWFP using GIS and Geo-Processing Techniques\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nArshad Ashraf\n\n2012-07-01\n\nFull Text Available The artesian aquifers provide economical and sustainable source of groundwater for irrigation and domestic use. GIS (Geographic Information System was used for development and integration of spatial databases, analysis and visualization of spatial data in two- and three-dimensional views. The aquifer system of Daraban Rod-Kohi area of DI Khan was analyzed to identify potential artesian aquifers using geological sections of the observation wells representing detail of subsurface lithology and strata encountered. According to an estimate, about 1,700 million m3 of extractable volume of groundwater exists in this part of rod-kohi area. Different profile sections were drawn to analyze the subsurface condition of the study area using Rockworks GIS-based software. The geo-processing technique of horizontal litho-blending was utilized for lithological modeling. Based on stratigraphic information of the area, three distinct aquifers were identified down to a depth of about 200 meters among which two are semi-confined to confined having prospects of artesian water. The 2D and 3D analysis show that characteristics of the confined aquifers vary spatially with the subsurface lithology and structural setup of the area. The depth range of confined layer-1 is found between 118 and 133 meters while of confined layer-2 between 182 and 195 meters. The output data indicated a close agreement with the observed data of the artesian wells. The study results can provide base for detail investigation of artesian resource and selection of potential sites for installation of artesian wells in the target area.\n\nFIBIT : k patriotizmu tsherez kubizm i goti"
