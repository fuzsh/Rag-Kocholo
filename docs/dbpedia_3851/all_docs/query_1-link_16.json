THE UKRAINIAN WEEKLY Published by the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> National Association Inc., a fraternal non-profit association Vol. LXIV No. 41 THE UKRAINIAN WEEKLY SUNDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1996 $1.25/$2 in Ukraine In whirlwind visit, Ukraine’s justice minister signs series of judicial agreements in Canada by Andrij Wynnyckyj Toronto Press Bureau TORONTO — Over one intensive work-week in late September, Ukraine’s Justice Minister Serhiy Holovaty met with Canada’s legal establishment as part of his government’s ongoing effort to reform its justice system and consolidate the rule of law in his country. On the first day of official meetings, September 23, Mr. Holovaty was in the host nation’s capital, Ottawa, to sign a bilateral treaty “On Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters” with his Canadian counterpart, Allan Rock. <strong>The</strong> charter, which goes into effect on November 1, provides for assistance in the investigation and prosecution of all offenses proscribed by the respective Parliaments of Ukraine and Canada, specifically mentions those offenses concerning “taxation, duties, customs and international transfer of capital or payments,” and provides for the freezing, seizure and confiscation of proceeds of crime. According to a press release issued by Canada’s Department of Justice, the intent of the treaty is in part to make Ukraine part of “an international network of Mutual by Roman Woronowycz Kyiv Press Bureau KYIV — An unusual L-1011 passenger aircraft descended from the heavens on September 28 into Kyiv’s Boryspil Airport, carrying to Ukraine 65 doctors, and $12 million in medicine from the United States and the latest in medical technology in a humanitarian mission called “Operation Blessing.” <strong>The</strong> plane, the Flying Hospital, had been outfitted with surgical, dental and ophthamological equipment, and with medicines and skilled personnel also aboard, it arrived ready to give Ukraine a medical helping hand. <strong>Ukrainian</strong>s rarely have access to Western medical treatment and all the heralded hi-tech procedures and equipment associated with it. <strong>The</strong>y have consoled themselves with the fact that at least they have access to cost-free medicine, which is becoming less true as clinics and hospitals attach service fees (although minimal) for treatment to subsidize expenses. So, when Operation Blessing set up shop in Ukraine to give free health care to Kyiv’s residents from September 21 to October 4, the turnout was as could be expected. Thousands jammed nine polyclinics and hospitals in Kyiv that were staffed in all by 80 doctors and 170 support staff from America. <strong>The</strong>y were looking for medical advice, treatment and prescriptions for their various ailments and diseases. At one place, the Boryspil Polyclinic, 2,500 people were examined in the first two days, according to Operation Blessing Public Relations Manager Sharon Gabriel. When a radio station mistakenly aired a telephone number that was supposed to be used only by reporters as an information source, the response was such that the district telephone (Continued on page 7) Legal Assistance Treaties ... an important step in the fight against organized and transnational crime.” Canada has now signed a number of these agreements with other states, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and France. <strong>The</strong> two ministers also signed an Understanding in Principle on cooperation in the field of justice. With this understanding, Canada’s Department of Justice and the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine agreed to offer each other the widest measure of mutual assistance in promoting a better knowledge of their respective systems of justice and sharing their expertise on issues such as legislative drafting and organization of a ministry of justice. This kind of sharing was already going on immediately prior to the signing. Earlier that morning, Minister Holovaty met with Canadian Deputy Minister of Justice George Thomson and Associate Deputy Minister Richard Thompson to discuss administrative and managerial issues concerning Ukraine’s efforts to reorganize its Justice Ministry. (Continued on page 5) Parliament elects deputy chairman, a lawyer popular among his peers by Roman Woronowycz Kyiv Press Bureau KYIV — Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada overwhelmingly elected National Deputy Viktor Musiyaka to the post of deputy chairman on October 3 by a vote of 277- 55, after failing to vote in two previous nominees. He replaces Oleksander Diomin, who opted to remain Kharkiv Oblast chairman and leave the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Parliament. <strong>The</strong> <strong>Ukrainian</strong> Constitution does not allow for individuals to hold more than one post in government. Mr. Musiyaka, 50, who hails from Mykolaiv Oblast, received support from a large part of the political spectrum in Ukraine’s legislature, from rightists to Communists. He is respected as a lawyer and legal expert. More importantly, in June, during the fight between President Leonid Kuchma and the Parliament over the proposed Constitution, he resigned his position as the president’s representative in Parliament over the issue of the legality of a referendum on the Constitution — a move that endeared him to many of his colleagues. He called Mr. Kuchma’s threat to go to the people Flying Hospital lands in Kyiv to provide free health care Operation Blessing Surgery is performed aboard the Flying Hospital. for approval of the Constitution “unconstitutional.” Since passage of the Constitution, the presidential administration and the Parliament have been at loggerheads over who will control the reigns of power that are not explicitly delineated in the new Constitution. Deputies from UNA-UNSO through to the Communists agreed that the man from Mykolaiv is right for the job. Deputy Oleh Vitovych, of the far right political organization the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> National Assembly, said Mr. Musiyaka was the best electable choice. “He may not be a good politician, but he is a good and honest person, and that is probably most important today. Even we agree that he is the best choice.” From the far left, Anatoliy Levchenko of the Communist Party said he voted for Mr. Musiyaka. “He is the right person to bring order to the Parliament.” Former President Leonid Kravchuk, currently a deputy, also gave a nod of approval. “He is a lawyer, a professor, a legal expert, and he abides by the law. He is tolerant. He isn’t the type that is going to cause conflict but will resolve it,” said Mr. Kravchuk. “He is the type that could unite the Parliament and even bring some cooperation between the legislature and the executive.” Mr. Kravchuk also said it is high time that a legal expert sit on the Presidium of the Parliament. “Both Moroz and Tkachenko are agronomists,” he explained. Some members of Parliament also believe that because Mr. Musiyaka is not beholden to Parliament Chairman Oleksander Moroz and First Deputy Chairman Oleksander Tkachenko and their dictatorial style of parliamentary procedure, he could be a unifying force. Natalia Vitrychenko, a member of the Socialist Reform Party, said, “He is not going to switch off microphones, nor will he block the release of bills to the floor of Parliament, like Moroz, and especially Tkachenko, does.” Even with what seems like a widespread base of support, the fact remains that Mr. Musiyaka was only Parliament’s third choice for the post of deputy chairman. Valentyn Symonenko, a deputy from the Odessa region, had received the highest tally in a ratings vote that was taken by Parliament to determine the favorites for the post. He withdrew his candidacy on September 18, after being nominated by Chairman Moroz. <strong>The</strong> ex-mayor of Odesa explained that concern for the city’s problems (at that time a hurricane had devastated a portion of the coastal area) would not allow him to effectively carry out his duties as deputy chairman of Parliament.
