Most obviously, the emergence of an independent Ukrainian state in 1991 came as a great surprise in the chancelleries, universities and boardrooms of the West – a surprise that many are still adjusting to. There were also very real reasons why Ukraine was then considered to be an unlikely candidate as a new nation, given its pronounced patterns of ethnic, linguistic, religious and regional diversity. However, an unexpected nation is still a nation – no more and no less than many others. The 2014 crisis showed that the elite of Putin’s Russia clearly thought otherwise (as outlined in Chapter 13). To them, Ukraine simply does not exist, or Ukrainians and Russians are one nation, or its ‘Russian-lite’ parts should be sub-divided from the rest. Putin could have stopped at the annexation of Crimea, but did not. He was unlikely to stop with half of the economic wastelands of the Donbas under his proxies’ control. His broader aim was to make the rest of Ukraine a dysfunctional state. At the time of rewriting, Ukraine was facing economic collapse, and not enough had changed politically, but on this key existential question Putin seemed to have failed. Ukraine was more united after the crisis than before. Nationalists tend to see their nation as eternal, as a historical entity since the earliest times. Their history is written as the story of the nation’s trials and triumphs. In reality nations are formed by circumstance and chance. Ukrainians like to talk about the ‘national idea’. Precisely so. Concepts such as ‘nation’ really belong to the realm of political and cultural imaginations. The approach of this book, to use another ugly but fashionable term, is therefore deconstructivist. Nations are cultural constructs and this is how I have tried to present ‘Ukraine’ – as the product of various imaginations, both Ukrainian and other. Alongside the more obvious narrative of political and social change, I have therefore included representations of Ukraine in literature and the arts and, in the chapter on geopolitics, cartographers’ images. I have also tried to deconstruct, in the sense of debunk, some of the myths about Ukraine and its past – both Ukrainian nationalists’ flights xi\n\nPreface to the Fourth Edition\n\n•\n\nxii\n\nof fancy and Russian and other rival nationalists’ attempts to belittle or deny Ukraine. This should not be taken as an attempt to undermine the ‘Ukrainian idea’, just to build it on more secure foundations. The Ukrainians may now be becoming a nation before our very eyes, but this does not mean that they were always Ukrainians or that they were always destined to become such. Often the inhabitants of what is now Ukraine would have been better described as rebellious peasants, members of a particular faith, left-wing activists or whatever. Often they thought in terms of a local identity; often they saw themselves as part of other communities, some still existing, some long disappeared. The process whereby they became Ukrainians could have unfolded in different ways. The book therefore also tries to be counterfactual. History would have been very different if Russia had absorbed what subsequently became the nationalist stronghold of western Ukraine in 1772 or 1815 rather than 1945. Modern Ukraine might then have been more like modern Belarus, with a much weaker sense of national identity. Conversely, if Kiev had not been sacked by the Mongols in 1240, it might have developed into a rival centre of power to the fledgling state in the north that eventually became first Muscovy and then Russia. This book aims to capture the fact that history is always pregnant with possibility. The approach is also, where necessary, reconstructivist. Significant aspects of the past are often now overlooked and need to be written back into the picture. Above all, this concerns the Ukrainian experience of empire, which has been a more or less ever-present factor in Ukrainian life since the sixteenth century at least. Many Ukrainians were quite willing citizens of the Polish Commonwealth and the Habsburg, Romanov and Soviet empires, and this should not be wished away by, ironically, taking too deconstructivist an approach to the history of these lost worlds and disassembling them out of the Ukrainian experience. I have begun my study in the time of the early medieval kingdom of Keivan Rus, but that history is one that is shared with Russians and Belarusians. Ukrainian Cossacks created an independent ‘Hetmanate’ in 1648, but, again, it could not create the trappings of a modern state. Various Ukrainian governments emerged in 1917–20 after the collapse of the Romanov and Habsburg empires, but they were always precarious and many Ukrainians supported the rival Soviet project. On the whole, therefore, Ukrainian identity has had to be developed in other peoples’ states – until now. The period since 1991 is in many ways Ukraine’s first period of consolidated statehood, but the state is still weak and a real sense of nationhood less firmly established. The reader will, I hope, forgive what is historically arguably an overconcentration on Ukraine’s last imperial relationship, that with tsarist then Soviet Russia. Ukraine’s long linkage with Poland features heavily in the earlier historical chapters, but less so in those on the present day.\n\nPreface to the Fourth Edition\n\n•\n\nxiii\n\nUkraine has not always been defined by its relationship with Russia, but it certainly is today, particularly given the legacy of the Soviet period, which continues to exert a huge influence on Ukrainian identity, politics, economics and even religion. It is no exaggeration to say that the management of this relationship is the key to the future of the whole of Eastern Europe. It is also an association without obvious analogies. Even more so than the Scots and the English, the Slovaks and the Czechs, the Ukrainians and Russians have long been both friends and rivals, and on extremely intimate terms. It may be the crisis that began in 2014 is what will finally drive the two apart. There is nothing more effective than war for accelerating change. Finally, the book seeks to challenge stereotypes about Ukraine’s place in the wider world. Like the Balkans,1 Ukraine is neither as incontrovertibly ‘other’ nor as ‘non-European’ (or just ‘non-visible’) as many have seen it as being in the past; nor is it as incontrovertibly ‘European’ as Ukrainian nationalists would have it in the present. Ukraine has always stood at a crossroads of cultural influences – at times a key part of a Europe that has itself been constantly redefined, at others not. Ukraine’s foreign policy has often vacillated between Russia and the West. In 2004 and 2014 it attempted to choose the West, and Russia attempted to stop it. The subsequent struggle will profoundly affect the future of Russia and Europe, not just Ukraine. In none of this are the Ukrainians unique. As Ernest Renan famously remarked, history is as much about forgetting as it is about remembering: ‘getting history wrong is part of being a nation.’2 All nations tell a version of their histories that is shaped by present circumstances. One of Ukraine’s best young historians, Yaroslav Hrytsak, has argued that Ukrainian history is just as ‘normal’ as that of any other nation.3 Indeed so, but part of that normalcy consists in being prepared to be less fetishistic about the past. One warning is necessary, however. A book of this size cannot be a complete history of Ukraine, both past and present. The same is true of the chronology that follows. I have included most main events, but concentrated on the times and places that feature in the text. Readers can look elsewhere (perhaps starting with the bibliographical essay at the end) for every fact and detail, but can proceed with the assurance that I have tried to include enough information to make the story comprehensible and have assumed only a minimal amount of prior knowledge. The amount of necessary information has, however, varied with how I have chosen to tell the story. A word or two about technical aspects. Given what I have said so far, it would perhaps have made more sense to render names of individuals and places in all the various ways they have been used in the past, rather than impose present-day categorisations and spellings. The city of Lviv (the current Ukrainian spelling), for example, has also been known as Lvov (Russian), Lwów (Polish) and Lemberg (German). Rather than\n\nPreface to the Fourth Edition\n\n•\n\nxiv\n\nburden the reader with two or three versions of the same name, however, I have used modern Ukrainian versions throughout. Nevertheless, sometimes it has made sense to refer to the same place or person in different fashions. The twelfth-century text The Lay of Ihor’s Host (Ukrainian ‘h’) is therefore also the nineteenth-century opera Prince Igor (Russian ‘g’). The great tenth-century prince of Rus is both Volodymyr (Ukrainian version) and Vladimir (Russian version). After all, in a sense Volodymyr, according to the Ukrainian tradition the founder of Ukraine-Rus, and Vladimir, according to Russian history the founder of Russia, are different people. I have tried to avoid using the adjective ‘Ukrainian’ or the place-name ‘Ukraine’ (or indeed ‘Russian’ or ‘Russia’) before the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when the beginnings of modern national identities make them appropriate. Sometimes, however, this is just grammatically impossible. Also, it is difficult to avoid situating very early periods with modern place-names; but this is not meant to undermine the general thesis that national identities are relatively recent creations. To make things easier for the reader I have used an adapted Library of Congress system for transliteration, keeping diacritical marks and distinctive lettering (Pochaïv not Pochaiv), but ignoring soft signs (therefore Khemlnytskyi not Kheml’nyts’kyi and Viacheslav not V”iacheslav), although I have kept them in the footnotes for reference purposes. Certain Anglicisms have been retained; most notably Kiev, not Kyyiv or Kyïv, as there is as yet no real consensus on the use of the latter versions. The river Dnipro is still the Dnieper, Krym is still Crimea, and so on. Otherwise, modern Ukrainian place-names have been used. I have tried to keep footnotes to a minimum, apart from cases of direct quotation. Compensation is provided in the bibliographical essay of mainly Englishlanguage material at the end of the book. My thanks go to the many friends and colleagues who have helped in the preparation of the book, including Jonathan Aves and the two anonymous readers for their comments on the first draft of the text. My good friend Graham Smith helped me to liven up chapter thirteen. Graham died in 1999 and is sorely missed by all of his many family, friends and colleagues. Thanks in Kiev go to the Petrus family, Valentin Yakushik, Valerii Khmelko, Yevgeniia Tesliuk and Oleksii Haran. Catherine Pyke of UCL helped prepare the historical maps. Grants from the ESRC and Leverhulme Trust helped my research. At Yale I am especially grateful to Robert Baldock, Candida Brazil, Tami Halliday, Katie Harris, Heather Nathan, Elizabeth Pelton and Maha Moushabeck for all their patience and hard work.

The Lay of Ihor’s Host (1187)1 The ‘land of Rus’ that Prince Ihor of Chernihiv set out to defend in 1185 was the early medieval kingdom of Kievan Rus,2 the dominant power in Eastern Europe between the ninth and thirteenth centuries AD. Its territory covered most of modern-day western and central Ukraine, nearly all of modern Belarus and the western parts of what is now Russia (see the map on page 3). The Lay of Ihor’s Host is the great narrative epic of the period, the equivalent of Beowulf for the Anglo-Saxons or Táin Bó Cuailnge for the Celts. It depicts Ihor’s heroic campaign against the Polovtsians, a pagan tribe from the eastern steppes who were a constant thorn in the side of the Rus. Unfortunately, Rus was already in decline by 1185 and Ihor’s campaign ended in spectacular defeat. The Lay of Ihor’s Host is therefore more of a lament than a celebration. The poem was supposedly written immediately after the event, but disappeared until its rediscovery in the 1790s by a certain Count MusinPushkin, a collector of antiquities in the service of Catherine the Great. The original copy was destroyed along with Musin-Pushkin’s house during the great Moscow fire that preceded Napoleon’s occupation in 1\n\nThe Ukrainians\n\n•\n\n2\n\n1812, leading some to cast doubt on the saga’s authenticity – especially as it seemed to evoke rather than merely describe a sense of Rus patriotism, thereby fitting rather too conveniently the tsarist ideology of the time. However, the discovery in 1852 of another (fourteenth-century) chronicle, the Zadonshchina, which drew much of its inspiration and material from The Lay of Ihor’s Host, has led most experts to accept that the latter was genuine. On the other hand, there is little agreement as to who the Rus actually were. Linguistic imprecision and, unfortunately, Russocentrism have too often led to the assumption that the ‘Rus’ were simply early medieval ‘Russians’. Many translations of The Lay of Ihor’s Host, including the 1961 version by Vladimir Nabokov from which the above quotation is adapted, render the ‘land of Rus’ (Ruskaia zemlia) as ‘the Russian land’. Tsarist and Soviet historians, and many of their Western rivals, have too often abused the idea of east Slavic common origin in an ‘ancient Rus nation’ to deny Ukrainians (and Belarusians) any separate identity at all. Ukrainian historians, on the other hand, have tended to argue that the Russians and Ukrainians, or at least their ancestors, have always pursued separate historical paths. Two distinct Ukrainian views exist: either Rus was only ever a loose agglomeration of peoples; or the opposite – Rus was a relatively united early Ukrainian state, dubbed Ukraine-Rus, from which the Russian nation emerged as a later offshoot. It is also possible to argue that all the eastern Slavs (Ukrainians, Russians and Belarusians) are descended from the Rus, a once-united people amongst whom fundamental differences emerged only after the time of Prince Ihor. In this case, the fact that a common identity may have existed in the twelfth century is not at all the same thing as saying that Ukrainians and Belarusians are just ‘Russians’ today. ‘Rus’ was what came before all three, at a time when collective identities were extremely loose and modern ‘nations’ as such did not really exist. Why does any of this matter? Russians are still brought up on the idea of a single ancient Rus/Russian nation and still have great difficulty adjusting to the idea not just of a separate Ukrainian state, but of the Ukrainians’ separate origin as a people. Ukrainian historians have often swung to the opposite extreme and, by claiming the unity of Rus as their own (Rus was a Kievan and therefore a Ukrainian state), have sought to deny the Russians their traditional theory of national origin. Or they have rewritten the history of Rus as one of ethnic conflict between the three east Slavic nations already formed – the first stage in a more or less permanent struggle that has continued ever since. Neither approach is capable of explaining subsequent history. The former cannot comprehend why Ukrainians have ever pursued a path of separate development, the latter cannot do justice to Ukraine’s long history of partnership and cooperation with Russia. Simply put, the origins of many current arguments lie in\n\nApprox. extent of Rus\n\nLake Onega\n\nLake Ladoga\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300 km\n\nIC SEA\n\nN\n\nNovgorod\n\nUA\n\nNIA\n\nB\n\nVo\n\nA\n\nga\n\nLT\n\nPskov Rostov\n\nl\n\nSuzdal Vladimir (Moscow)\n\nPolatsk\n\nLI\n\nTH\n\nSmolensk\n\nPO LA ul a N\n\nD\n\nDnie p er\n\nB\n\nu\n\nh\n\nst\n\nNovhorod-Siverskyi\n\nn Sia\n\nVi\n\nPutivl\n\nla Su Pereiaslav\n\nKiev Halych G\n\non\n\nLI\n\nD\n\nA\n\nRo s ou\n\nets\n\nt he rn\n\nIA\n\nN\n\nS\n\nDon\n\nNI\n\nBu\n\nHY\n\nh\n\nA\n\nINS TA UN MO\n\n) IA AV\n\nT S O V P O L\n\nS\n\nr\n\nOL\n\nst e\n\n-V\n\nnie\n\nIA\n\nHI A\n\nC\n\nD\n\nN\n\nR (MO\n\nCAR PA T\n\nChernihiv\n\nPeremyshl\n\nHUNGARY\n\nSEA OF AZOV\n\nTmutorokan Chersonesus\n\nBULGARIA\n\nB L A C K\n\nConstantinople\n\nBYZANTIUM\n\nMap 1.

We therefore begin our story with Rus, as an investigation into the origins of the Ukrainian nation and of Ukrainian identity.\n\nTheories of Unity The Lay of Ihor’s Host seems to support the views of those historians who regard the Rus as a single people. First and foremost, ‘the Rus’ are referred to throughout as a single entity (although in other sources there are references to travelling, for example, from Novgorod in the north ‘to Rus’ in the south – that is, to the heartlands around Kiev).3 This common name for the previously separate and individually named east Slavic tribes can be found as early as the 860s in local chronicles and in documents recording negotiations with foreign powers, such as those with Byzantium in 911 and 944.4 Second, the willingness of the Rus to fight against common enemies such as the Polovtsians (also known as the Cumans) indicates that internal differences could be subsumed and that the main line between ‘us’ and ‘them’ lay on the outside. The Lay of Ihor’s Host describes how Ihor assembled his army from all over Rus; from Kiev and Pereiaslav in the south, from Halych in the west and from Smolensk in the north. The chronicle records how Ihor’s departure was celebrated throughout the land: steeds neigh beyond the Sula glory rings in Kiev trumpets blare in Novgorod banners are raised in Putivl.5 The description of the consequences of Ihor’s defeat leaves little doubt as to the perceived difference between the Rus ‘we’ and the Polovtsian ‘they’,6 nor as to the fact that the relationship was (at least then) fairly antagonistic. After the key battle in the field unknown, midst the Polovtsian land, the black sod under hooves was sown with bones and irrigated with gore.7 Although the princes of Rus fought each other on occasion – especially after central authority grew weaker in the wake of the death of the last great Rus rulers, Volodymyr Monomakh (1125) and his son Mstyslav (1132) – they tended to fight over the entire patrimony of the\n\nContesting National Origins: Lays of Ancient Rus\n\n•\n\n5\n\nstate, so long as Kiev remained its most prestigious and prosperous part (by the time a failed attempt was made to establish a capital at Vladimir in the late twelfth century, Kiev was losing this preeminence). The system of political succession, whereby princes were rotated amongst the provinces, was designed to prevent hereditary lines and closed fiefdoms forming in (most of) the principalities, although in practice it had an unfortunate tendency to encourage fratricidal competition amongst the princes. However, Volodymyr Monomakh’s warning to his children in his Testament (1117) regarding the dangers of internecine strife showed that the idea of Rus as a united patrimony remained strong.8 The lack of natural internal borders in Rus facilitated the movement of people and the dissemination of homogenising cultural influences, although the sheer size of its territory somewhat limited this effect. The river Dnieper, then the main East European trade route ‘from the Varangians [Scandinavia] to the Greeks’, was the central geopolitical fact in Rus and the key image in foreign and domestic representations of its inhabitants. ‘This great waterway’, one Russian historian has argued, ‘was able to overrule all the local centres of crystallisation and to unite the various Slavonic tribes . . . into a single state’.9 It also contributed to the view of the Rus as a single trading nation adopted by outsiders who were less familiar with the Dnieper’s hinterlands. The Lay of Ihor’s Host makes clear that, although Ihor’s army may have had mercenary motives – With their vermilion shields the sons of Rus have barred the great steppe seeking for themselves honour and for their prince glory – they nonetheless saw themselves as princes and knights fighting for the Christians against the pagan troops.10 The Christianity brought to Rus from Byzantium in AD988 was a powerful unifying factor, both in itself and because it provided a more monolithic official ideology that helped to underpin princely authority. Indeed, this may have been Volodymyr the Great’s (ruled 980–1015) primary motive in accepting the new faith. Before 988 he had been an equally enthusiastic promoter of the cult of the pagan god Perun as a means of uniting his diverse realm. Unquestionably, however, Rus became a more unified entity after the Baptism in 988 as the culture that was spawned by Christianity spread throughout the land.11 The new religion also created a new style of public space. The architecture of churches in more\n\nThe Ukrainians\n\n•\n\n6\n\nnortherly towns such as Vladimir and Novgorod echoed that of Kiev, based, usually, on the model of the Cathedral of the Assumption (built 1073–84) in the Pechersk monastery complex, which was itself based on Constantinople originals. (The Assumption was dynamited by retreating Soviet troops in 1941, most probably in the hope of engulfing visiting German dignitaries; rebuilding began in 1998.) Churches were in the Middle Byzantine rather than the Western Gothic style, with a central turriform structure topped by golden cross-domes and a main tower with a circle of windows at its base, supported by tall apses over a compact, centripetal core, usually in the shape of a cross. Internal decoration was similarly elaborate, with painted walls, rich mosaics and ornate iconostases separating the (standing) congregation in the knave from the sanctuary, the privileged domain of the priests. This common style can be seen in the illustrations (see plates 1 and 2) of St Sofiia’s in Novgorod, the Dmitrievskii church in Vladimir and the church of SS Borys and Hlib in Chernihiv. As the Assumption was demolished by the Soviets and the earlier church of the Tithes by the Mongols, the closest example of the type still standing in Kiev is probably St Cyril’s (1146). In a similar but more compact style is the Pyrohoshcha church of the Virgin, built in Kiev’s lower town of Podil in 1135, destroyed in 1935 and carefully restored in the original style in 1998. Kiev’s main church, St Sofiia’s, was built by Yaroslav the Wise (ruled 1019–54) in 1037–44. Its original five apses and 13 cupolas (symbolising Christ and the 12 apostles) were first arranged in a flatter domed style more obviously derived from the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, before later Baroque additions gave the church its current appearance (see also pages 68–9). A common liturgy was used in all the new churches, and by the thirteenth century the simplified Christian canon of saints and apostles had (largely) displaced the many and varied gods of the pre-Christian era.12 The adoption of local saints such as Borys and Hlib, Volodymyr’s martyred sons, and the veneration of Volodymyr himself as the ‘foundersaint’ of Rus, as with St Stephen of Hungary or Arthur of England or Clovis of France, further strengthened the unity of the local version of Christianity. The preeminent symbol of the new religion, the icon, introduced another new constant into the life of Rus. Icon-painting and mosaic work supposedly demonstrated a common local style developed from Byzantium, with at least those icons produced in Novgorod (if less so those in Vladimir) following the Kievan style. The twelfth-century Annunciation of Ustiug and the Angel with the Golden Hair (see plates 3 and 17) were probably produced in Novgorod, although the fact that some authors have attributed one or the other to Kiev indicates that definitive judgment is difficult and emphasises the point about the diffusion of a common style (Ustiug is in the north).13 The golden braid on the head of the angel and on the figure of Gabriel on the left of the Annunciation is one possible indication of an incipient local ‘school’.14\n\nContesting National Origins: Lays of Ancient Rus\n\n•\n\n7\n\nThe advocates of a relatively united Rus have also argued that its inhabitants probably spoke a common language of sorts.15 As written sources are thin on the ground no definitive judgment can be made, but constant commercial and military intercourse and the fact that rival princes attended one another’s courts and assemblies without the need for translators is taken as evidence of a common tongue. Moreover, it has been claimed, books ‘circulated widely, from Halych to Suzdal’.16 One source asserts somewhat implausibly that there were 140,000 books in circulation by the end of the eleventh century – if true, certainly a literary tradition well in advance of states such as Poland.17 One eleventh-century text refers to the Rus as a people ‘feasted to fulfillment on the sweetness of books’.18 The chronicles themselves, constantly retold and rewritten, were a powerful unifying force, both symbolically and linguistically, although, as indicated above, they were no doubt themselves in advance of cultural developments on the ground, promoting as much as reflecting the idea of Rus cultural unity. Admittedly, ‘the literary language was a little elevated over the popular, but this is a common occurrence for all languages’;19 prince could communicate with prince, armies could operate a common chain of command and congregations could understand their priests. On the other hand, the liturgical language was actually Church Slavonic. Although this ‘was close to the literary language of Rus’,20 the literate high culture of Rus was therefore not exclusively local and was shared with fellow Slavs in neighbouring states such as Bulgaria and Moravia. Rus was also something of a diglossia. Communication on an elite level may have been possible, but differences at the level of local popular dialect were probably considerable. The Rus also had a common system of customary law, codified in the eleventh-century ‘Law of Rus’ (Ruska Pravda). The large number of extant copies suggests it was in wide use. The code was notable for its relative humanity, with fines more common than capital or corporal punishment. Women also received surprisingly equitable treatment, at least in terms of tort and family law, if not of inheritance. On the other hand, there was very little in the way of administrative structure to implement this law: Rus was not a modern state and in this respect was less developed than the Carolingian or Holy Roman empire in the West. In other words, the Rus possessed substantial attributes of ethnic unity – a common name, common enemies, a sense of territorial unity and elements of a common culture, although how much of this extended beyond the elite to the lower orders is hard to tell. The Rus were not a modern ‘nation’, but they were not too dissimilar to the ‘English’ or ‘French’ of the twelfth century.21 Like the Angles and Saxons, Aquitainians and Burgundians, they often quarrelled amongst themselves and made occasional deals with outsiders and heathens. Prince Oleh Sviatoslavych (c1050–1115) sought the help of the Polovtsians to\n\nThe Ukrainians\n\n•\n\n8\n\nrecover his throne at Chernihiv in 1078; several notables defected before the 1223 Battle of Kalka: but this was normally a result of personal ambition or outsiders’ deeper pockets. A crusade was always likely to raise more troops than a vendetta.\n\nTheories of Difference This picture of relative unity is disputed by many Ukrainian and Belarusian historians, for whom Rus was no more than a ‘union of monarchs’, a loose collection of warring principalities, a federal entity at best. The nineteenth-century Ukrainian historian Mykola Kostomarov (1817–85) identified six separate peoples amongst its inhabitants. In addition to the Ukrainians or ‘Southern Rus’, the ‘Northerners’, the ‘Great Russians’, and the Belarusians or ‘White Rus’, there were the inhabitants of the city-states of Pskov and Novgorod. The name of ‘Rus’ was sometimes applied to the collective east Slavic whole, but it also had a narrower meaning, referring only to the southern heartland, around Kiev, Chernihiv and Pereiaslav. Byzantine emperors such as Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (ruled 913–20 and 944–59) referred in a similar fashion to ‘Internal’ and ‘External’ Rus. The ninth-century Arab writer Al-Jayhani listed three groups of Rus: the Kuiavii, the Slavii and the Artanii (see page 31). Kostomarov also stressed the factors that brought these disparate peoples together (the fruitful marriage of the southern love of liberty with the northerners’ ‘state-building’ preference for autocracy), but other Ukrainian historians have depicted the various subgroups as more or less constantly at war. Particular attention is paid to the supposed north–south conflict, which in 1169 led to the sack of Kiev, the main principality in the north-east, by armies loyal to Andrei Bogoliubskii, Prince of Vladimir (ruled 1157–75). According to one account: They plundered the whole town for two days – Podil and the hills, the monasteries, St Sofiia’s, the Virgin of the Tithes. No one was shown mercy by anyone, churches were burnt, Christians were slaughtered, and others taken prisoner, women led into captivity, forcibly separated from their husbands, children wept looking at their mothers. The plunderers took countless booty, churches were stripped of icons and books and vestments, and bells were all taken down . . . and all things sacred were carried away.22 Others have argued that such attacks were fairly common occurrences. Prince Riuryk Rostyslavych and the princes of Chernihiv sacked the main Kievan monastery complex at Pechersk in 1203. The Ukrainian historian Petro Tolochko has pointed out that Bogoliubskii’s armies\n\nContesting National Origins: Lays of Ancient Rus\n\n•\n\n9\n\nwere assembled from all points of the compass, so their ‘destruction’ of Kiev, which in any case was only partial, could not be considered an act of one part of Rus against another.23 The long-running feud between the princes of Kiev and those of nearby Chernihiv was as deadly as any between north and south. Belarusian historians have also sought to deconstruct the idea of a single Rus state. Unable to claim Kievan Rus as their own and anxious to play up the autonomy of their own north-western region – the ‘citystate’ of Polatsk – they have attacked the notion that Kievan Rus was ever a truly unified entity. ‘The name – Kievan Rus’, they claim, ‘is not to be found in any of the chronicles. Secondly, this “state” was a patchwork, not long-lasting, united [only] by armed force.’24 Rus was ‘a loose union of principalities, which only ever achieved a form of union in the 70 years between Volodymyr the Great and Yaroslav the Wise.’25 The idea that Rus was only a confederation of city-states, ‘a union of unions’, with a monarch of limited authority and administrative capacity balanced by the power of local assemblies (viche) and militias (druzhyna), even began to creep into Russian historiography in the late Soviet period, particularly in the writings of Igor Froianov.26 However, for Ukrainian historians such as Volodymyr Antonovych (1834–1908), Mykhailo Hrushevskyi (1866–1934) and modern successors such as Yaroslav Dashkevych, the difference between the various city-states was caused by more than mere geography or local dynastic loyalties. There was already an ethnic difference, at least between the lands around Kiev and those around Vladimir-Suzdal. Hrushevskyi dated the difference to the emergence of the Antes tribal federation in the fourth century AD, others have gone as far back as the Bronze Age. Chapter two discusses these theories. Others have accepted that a relatively united east Slavic mass existed until the seventh century AD, when it divided into early Ukrainian tribes (the Polianians, the Volhynians) and their Belarusian (the Krivichians and Drehovichians) and Russian equivalents (the Viatychians and Slovenians). Furthermore, the ‘Russian’ group mixed with local Finno-Ugric elements and the ‘Belarusian’ group with local Balts to increase these embryonic differences, while the Ukrainians had a strong tradition of Iranian and Ural-Altai influence. Some Ukrainians have even argued that the Russians are not proper Slavs at all, but a bastard mixture of Finnic and Mongol elements. Vladimir-Suzdal, the basis of ‘future Russia’, is therefore depicted as a highly marginal outpost of Rus, a frontier melting pot of all sorts of ethnic flotsam, including Bulgarians and Volga Tatars. In one favourite passage from the main Rus chronicle, The Tale of Bygone Years (also known as the Primary Chronicle), several versions of which exist from the eleventh century and after, the behaviour of the civilised Polianians is contrasted with that of the tribes to the north, particularly the Derevlianians, who\n\nThe Ukrainians\n\n•\n\n10\n\nexisted in bestial fashion, and lived like cattle. They killed one another, ate every impure thing, and there was no marriage among them, but instead they seized upon maidens by capture. The Radmichians, Viatychians and Severians had the same customs . . . They spoke obscenely before their fathers and their daughters-in-law. There were no marriages among them, but simply festivals among the villages. When the people gathered together for games, for dancing, and for all other devilish amusements, the men on these occasions carried off wives for themselves . . . [for] they did not know the law of God, but made a law unto themselves.27 Whereas settled agriculture and even manufacture had long been practised in the south, life in the north was supposedly barbaric, peripatetic and short. It is even claimed that the north-east was barely occupied in this period, or at least was beyond the reach of civilisation. Viking chronicles, for example, refer constantly to Kiev, ‘the best realm in all Rus’, Polatsk, Novgorod, Perm and Smolensk, the area known collectively as Gårdarike, or ‘Greater Sweden’, the ‘World of the Gods’ as opposed to the ‘World of Men’; but, like the geographer Ptolemy, the Vikings thought this world ended at the river Don (then known as the Tanais), and the north-east in general was off the edge of their known world.28 The rise of the principality of Vladimir came relatively late, in the twelfth century, when Rus was already in decline. The Ukrainian geographer Stepan Rudnytskyi (see pages 280–1), claimed that the ‘wide [forest] zone, difficult of passage, separat[ed] the East Slavic tribes of the south from those of the north and west . . . the centers in which the Muscovite nation later developed bore the name of Salissye (land behind the forest).’29 The eleventh-century Yngvar Saga (written in the thirteenth) places the north-east firmly in the land of magic rather than the land of civilisation. The hero ventures on a journey to find the source of the greatest of ‘the three rivers flowing through Rus from the east’ and encounters rampant paganism, giants, a flying dragon known as the Jakulus, ‘unpleasant pirates’ and troll-women who attempt to seduce Yngvar’s men with ‘devilish witchcraft’. To protect his men from this particular ‘heathen practice’, the saga records, Yngvar grew ‘so enraged, he drew out a knife and stabbed [the leading troll] in the private parts’. In another incident, Yngvar’s men kill a giant with footprints ‘eight feet long’, ‘with a large number of men dangling from his belt’, ‘so fearsome and ugly they thought it must be the Devil himself’. The giant’s severed leg comes in useful further upriver, when the Vikings need a bait to lure another dragon away from the cave where he guards a glittering hoard of gold so vast that they had to use ‘their axes to hack off a piece that alone was worth a fortune’.30 Many Ukrainian historians, such as Dmytro Doroshenko (1882–\n\nContesting National Origins: Lays of Ancient Rus\n\n•\n\n11\n\n1951), have therefore sought to displace the Russians or their ancestors from the picture altogether, arguing that the Russian nation only began to develop after Andrei Bogoliubskii severed ties with Kiev in the late twelfth century.31 ‘Ukraine-Rus’, as they term it, was relatively unified before that date, but was simply an old Ukrainian state. ‘Difference’ was not so much within Rus but between the Ukrainians and the Russians, who developed outside or after Rus. (Some Ukrainians have argued that Novgorod in the north, unlike Vladimir in the north-east, was culturally close to Kiev until it was sacked by Moscow in 1478; it has even been claimed that Novgorod established Kiev, rather than vice versa,32 although how this fits with the idea of a distinctive southern ethnicity and geography is hard to grasp.)\n\nKulturkampf? These differences between north and south can allegedly be seen in all aspects of life, most importantly in language and religion, then the main manifestations of cultural difference. According to Ivan Yushchuk, a leading member of the contemporary Prosvita Ukrainian language society: The Russian [people and] language as such began to form on the territory of modern Russia from the eleventh century onwards, as a result of the [relatively late] colonisation of these lands by the Kievan Rus. Rus boyars . . . and militia [druzhyna], ruling over local FinnoUgric tribes (Chud, Meria, Ves, Muroma, Mordva, Perm, Pechora and so on), brought there their own mixture of Church Slavonic and Rus: just as, for example, also happened with the formation of the English and French languages, that is as a result of the mixing of the language of the conquerors with local dialects. In Kievan Rus [proper] the dominant language until the adoption of Christianity was the Rus language, which, as many facts demonstrate, sounded closer to the modern Ukrainian language and already possessed the majority of its grammatical and phonetic characteristics.33 ‘Old Ukrainian’ only gradually became a ‘peasant language’ because the ruling Rus elite adopted Church Slavonic after 988 and drifted away from their original traditions. Most scholars, however, would not accept the equation of the Rus and ‘Old Ukrainian’ languages. The three modern east Slavic tongues only began to form as separate entities in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, that is once the Rus themselves had been politically divided.34 Ukrainian historians have also tried, with somewhat more success, to undermine the idea of a unified Rus Church. The first step in their argument is to deny that the Kievan Church was a creature of Byzantium.\n\nThe Ukrainians\n\n•\n\n12\n\nFrom the time of the Baptism, claims one author, ‘the attempts of Byzantium to influence Rus politics through the Church met with resistance’,35 in part because of the strong local traditions that had already developed before 988 (see pages 33–7). ‘Volodymyr sought to be subordinate neither to the Constantinople patriarchate, nor to the Roman curia, but to continue the process begun in Moravia by Cyril and Methodius of building a Slavic version of Christianity.’36 According to Yevhen Sverstiuk, editor of the main Ukrainian Orthodox paper, Nasha Vira (‘Our Faith’), ‘there were no great barriers between Rus and Rome or Rus and Byzantium because Rus had few links with either.’37 Rus and Byzantium were after all at war between 1043 and 1046, and it has been argued that the ‘uncanonical’ baptism of the inhabitants of Kiev in the river Dnieper is evidence that no Byzantine envoys were present.38 Second, it is argued that in the three centuries after the Baptism there was a constant struggle between the ‘patriotic-evangelical’ and ‘messianic-Caesaropapist’ wings of the Rus Church. Instead of an argument between Rus and Byzantium, this opposition is presented as a further manifestation of north–south division, as it is argued that hierarchs from the north tended to support the Byzantine, that is ‘Caesaropapist’, position against the Kievan ‘patriots’. The latter were supposedly closer to the Greek aspects of Byzantine culture and the northerners to the Roman (sic).39 Whereas the southern Rus supported a ‘theological rationalism [that] opposed itself to Byzantium’s aggressive attitude to ancient philosophy, to philosophy and reason in general [and] to its tendency to irrationalism’, the latter ‘became the characteristic feature of Muscovite Orthodoxy’. ‘The Kievan Church’, on the other hand, was characterised by ‘Christian universalism, tolerance towards different religious centres . . . an authentic early Christian orientation, patriotism, evangelism and Paulism’, so that ‘the cross-pollinated fruit of the Eastern variant of Christianity with the Western on the basis of pre-Christian Slavic culture’ created ‘a tolerant open relationship to East and West’.40 This nationalisation of the Church and its embryonic ‘Kievan ecumenism’ can supposedly be seen in the key text of the period, the Sermon on Law and Grace written by Ilarion, the first native Rus metropolitan to head the local Church (probably served 1051–4). In the Sermon, Ilarion argues that all (Gentile) nations and Churches are equal in the sight of God, thus being by implication even-handed towards Rome and Byzantium (‘the Jews’ justification was grudging and jealous for Judea alone, not extending to the nations; but the Christians’ salvation is generous and beneficent, extending to all corners of the earth,’ he argues). Ilarion’s eulogy to Volodymyr, described as ‘a likeness of Constantine the Great: of like wisdom, of like love for Christ’, and of Yaroslav the Wise, called ‘Solomon’ to Volodymyr’s ‘David’, can also be seen as a step towards justifying the Rus Church as an institution in its own right.41 Rumblings in favour of autocephaly, that is formal independence for\n\nContesting National Origins: Lays of Ancient Rus\n\n•\n\n13\n\nthe Rus Church, were initially heard in the eleventh century. A first sign was the desire of Kiev to establish its own saints (Volodymyr, his grandmother Olha and the martyrs Borys and Hlib), although Constantinople refused to recognise their canonisation until the thirteenth century. By the sixteenth, there was a total of 148 Rus saints.42 A second sign was the emergence of native metropolitans. The first, Ilarion, had only a limited localising agenda, of which Constantinople was in any case extremely wary at the time of the schism of 1054. After Ilarion, Greek metropolitans, such as Nikephoros (served 1104–21) and Michael I (1130–45), reimposed Byzantine control and tried to stir up hostility to Latin Christendom. Ukrainian historians have argued that a second, more serious attempt to establish autocephaly was made at the synod of 1147, when Prince Iziaslav Mstyslavych (ruled in Kiev 1146–54) ensured the election of Klymentii Smoliatych as metropolitan (served 1147–55). Iziaslav’s early death cut the attempt short, and a rival, more ‘northerly’ and proByzantine party led by Niphont of Novgorod and Yurii Dolgorukii, the founder of Moscow (ruled 1149–57), was then able to settle accounts with the ‘autonomists’. Significantly, however, a trend had been set. The ‘northern’ party again clashed with the ‘southern’ when Andrei Bogoliubskii attempted to appoint his protégé Feodor as metropolitan of Vladimir and effectively split the Rus Church in two. The attempt failed – Feodor was taken to Kiev in 1169 and executed. The severity of his fate indicated the seriousness with which the idea of a united Church was still taken: ‘[Kievan] Metropolitan Constantine charged him [Feodor] with all his transgressions and ordered him to be taken to the dog’s island. And there they maimed him and cut out his tongue, as fitting for an evil heretic, and they cut off his right hand and gouged out his eyes, because he said abusive [things] about the Holy Mother of God.’43 Nevertheless, there were many signs of the ‘northerners’ developing an ideology and identity of their own under Bogoliubskii. Of particular importance was the cult of Our Lady of Vladimir. Originally imported from Constantinople in 1134 and known as the Virgin of Vyshhorod (a town near Kiev), the icon was one of the central symbols of the divine authority of the princes of Kiev (see plate 18). Its capture in dubious circumstances by Bogoliubskii and transfer to the north therefore symbolised his attempt to usurp the city’s power. In 1395 the icon was transported to the Moscow Kremlin, where it supposedly deterred Timur (Tamerlane) from attacking the city. To this day it is used as a symbol of the continuity of Russia and Rus.44 Bogoliubskii also established new feast days and local saints and embarked on a grandiose scheme of church-building so that Vladimir could pose as a serious rival to Kiev. His scribes elaborated the idea that Vladimir had been founded and Christianised by Volodymyr (the normal date for its foundation is, in fact, 1108, by Vladimir Monomakh, not Vladimir the Great), making\n\nThe Ukrainians\n\n•\n\n14\n\nit the second city of Rus and eventual successor to Kiev, both lands blessed by God – Bogoliubskii means ‘lover of God’. The sack of Kiev in 1169 was supposedly therefore a deeply symbolic act, deliberately designed to undermine the city’s sacred status.45 Other historians have argued that the Church remained relatively united and that the idea of Kievan autocephaly is a fantasy invented to serve later political purposes. Petro Tolochko continues to suggest that the Church, or at least its hierarchs, ‘was the most consistent supporter of all-Rus-ian unity’.46 The good offices of the Church were the most likely means of keeping the peace between warring princes, and the ideology of the unity of Christ’s realm in Rus remained a strong unifying force even after the arrival of the Mongols in 1240. According to the Ukrainian art historian Dmytro Stepovyk, the embryonic cultural difference between north and south can also be observed in forms of artistic expression, icon-painting in particular. In attempting to deconstruct the idea of a common Rus style, he has argued that ‘the Byzantine notion of sacred art discarding all kinds of outside influence . . . was only a starting point for developing the Ukrainian national templeal art’, which drew on earlier pagan traditions and European influences to create a unique local style. Whereas Muscovy supposedly remained a slavish imitator of the Byzantine style of the twelfth-century Komnenos dynasty until as late as the eighteenth century, Kiev artists simply ‘took what they needed’ to form their ‘own original school’.47 In contrast to the northern school in Vladimir, Pskov, Smolensk and eventually Moscow, with its ‘plain use of space, regulated localisation of colour, [use of] reverse perspective, severe linearity’ and ‘excessively brilliant gilded pale-coloured shading’, the Kievan school was characterised by its ‘more reserved use of gold, localised on the aureole [halo] and with shading not of pale, but of deep red-brown gold’.48 In other words, whereas ‘Muscovite’ art actually exaggerated the Byzantine tradition – repetition of standardised and etiolated versions of the human form, flatness of colour and formalistic representations of the material world as a means of concentrating on the image of the divine – Kievan art was more naturalistic, humanistic and more ‘organically’ in touch with local tradition. In short, it had more colour and life. The widespread use of elaborate mosaics in a similar style supposedly attests to the artistic unity of the ‘Kievan school’ and to the wealth and growing cultural solidity of the south. However, the Russian art historian Igor Grabar argued more or less the opposite, namely that the national style developed in the north and was exported south to wean Kiev off its Byzantism.49 Others have rejected altogether the idea of sub-Rus-ian local ‘styles’. The monk Alempius (Alimpyi) is held to have been the leading exponent of this ‘Kievan’ school of icon-painting and mosaic art. The most spectacular example of his style (although actual authorship of the work is uncertain) is held to be the great mosaic of the Virgin Oranta above the\n\nContesting National Origins: Lays of Ancient Rus\n\n•\n\n15\n\naltar of St Sofiia’s (see plate 20). The Virgin is depicted in a local version of one of the three classic Byzantine poses, standing alone with her arms proffered outwards in prayer. Her serenity and transcendent calm, matched in the simple colours of the local stone, is one of the greatest achievements of Kievan art. At the same time, the Virgin is also a powerful symbol of the new Rus state, dressed in the clothes of an empress extending her protection, as the inscription above states, to Kiev, ‘the Holy City, the Holy House of the Eternal. God is within and this house is unshakable’. In the same style is the St Demetrius mosaic, while the depiction of the Virgin is remarkably similar to the icon of the Orans (Panagia) Virgin, which some scholars have also attributed to Alempius, others to artists from Yaroslavl, especially in terms of line and silhouette.50 Both works are now in the Tretiakov Gallery in Moscow (see plate 4). Other icons attributed to Alempius or his school include the St Nicholas, while other works, such as the mosaics for the Cathedral of the Assumption in Pechersk, have unfortunately been lost. One other surviving example of local Rus art is the twelfth-century Angel Rolling Up the Sky in Kiev’s St Cyril church, with its beautifully delicate blue and cream (artist unknown). Ukrainian historians have also argued that Kievan architecture was in an adapted Byzantine style, strongly influenced by local ‘indigenous’ traditions. Kiev’s St Sofiia’s, for example, is not only modelled on the earlier church of the Tithes, it is argued, but on even more ancient predecessors.51 Moreover, it is claimed that Kievan architects had already mastered the use of stone, contrary to the normal assertion that before invited Byzantine masters introduced the practice all Rus buildings were made of wood. The configuration of St Sofiia’s, in particular the proliferation of apses, naves and galleries, has no direct analogy in Constantinople. It has even been argued that St Sofiia’s demonstrates elements of the Western European Romanesque style, as in the great cathedrals of Trier (1047) and Worms (1110–1200) – built after St Sofiia’s. Most important, however, is the internal decoration, whose ‘native’ style is discussed on page 36. In the north of Rus, in contrast, the Kievan style was supposedly first copied and then forgotten, as Moscow developed its own architectural culture with a pronounced eastern influence, the most obvious example of which is St Basil’s in Red Square.52 Other local architectural schools appeared in Vladimir, Chernihiv, Halych (Galicia) and elsewhere as Kiev’s authority began to diminish in the twelfth century. Further alleged differences are found in political culture. Forms of government varied between the principalities. The viche system (gatherings of nobles) was more prominent in Novgorod, Pskov and Polatsk, whereas princely autocracy was the norm in Vladimir and RostovSuzdal, though also in Halych.53 In Vladimir, Andrei Bogoliubskii began to compare himself to the Byzantine emperors, even to Solomon, although Ukrainian historians have cast doubt on the line of succession\n\nIll. 1. Andrei Bogoliubskii taking the Vyshhorod/Vladimir Icon\n\nIll. 2. The Assassination of Bogoliubskii, 1175\n\nto the north-east, through Yurii Dolgorukii to Andrei Bogoliubskii, as Dolgorukii was only a junior son of Volodymyr Monomakh, born to a concubine (like many would-be autocrats, Bogoliubskii came to a sticky end, savagely murdered by assassins in 1175 – the illustrations above show him obtaining the Vladimir icon and the ultimate consequences of the act.) Bogoliubskii’s successor, Vsevolod III (ruled 1176–1212), was the first to style himself ‘Grand Prince’ – of Vladimir, not Kiev. The autocratic Byzantine idea of the ruler as Christ’s prince on earth was therefore first copied in Vladimir rather than in Kiev, before being 16\n\nContesting National Origins: Lays of Ancient Rus\n\n•\n\n17\n\npassed on to the tsars of Muscovy. The practice had not been original to Rus. When the early chronicles of Vladimir and Moscow referred to Volodymyr as ‘tsar’ they were attempting to justify their own practices by inventing a title he himself had never claimed.\n\nThe Fall of Rus The Mongols sacked Kiev in 1240. Although this event is commonly taken to mark the formal end of Rus, it need not necessarily have been the case. One prince, Danylo of Halych (ruled 1237–64), attempted to rebuild Rus from the west. If he had been more successful in resisting the Mongols and in creating a link between Halych and Kiev, and if Poland, Hungary and Serbia had joined a promised crusade in his support, then the main successor state to Rus might have looked more like modern Ukraine than modern Russia. Alternatively, embryonic Ukrainian and Russian polities might have developed in parallel, one in the south under Danylo and one in the north under Andrei Bogoliubskii’s grandson Alexander Nevskii (ruled 1252–63) in Novgorod–Pskov and/or Vladimir–Suzdal. Even in the north there were rival centres of power. Novgorod’s mercantile democracy could have triumphed over Muscovite absolutism in the fifteenth century, rather than vice versa. North and south might have cooperated, as with the brief alliance against the Mongols between Danylo and Alexander Nevskii’s brother Andrei in the 1250s, or they might have moved further apart. The translatio imperii theory (according to which Moscow, via Vladimir, was regarded as the direct and only successor of Kiev and Byzantium) much beloved of future Russian historians, was certainly not the only possibility. The others were closed off by circumstance rather than destiny. Rus could not be rebuilt in the south, as two-thirds of the territory of modern Ukraine was lost to the Mongols. The ‘northern’ option won out, temporarily at least, but the north enjoyed no monopoly. The Kingdom of Galicia and Volhynia enjoyed a century’s afterlife after 1240, until Galicia was occupied by Poland in 1349. Indeed, for Ukrainian ‘Occidentalists’ such as the historian Stefan Tomashivskyi (1875–1930), Galicia–Volhynia was the first true ‘national Ukrainian state’.54 Whereas Rus was a multinational agglomeration like the Frankish empire in the west, too much under the influence of Byzantium, Tomashivskyi’s school argued that Galicia–Volhynia was an ethnically distinct entity moving rapidly away from Vladimir–Suzdal in the north. Galicia, he argued, was also more unambiguously in the European cultural sphere. Under Roman (ruled 1199–1205), Danylo and Lev I (1264–1301), Galicia–Volhynia interacted on equal terms with its neighbours Poland and Hungary in joint defence of Europe against the Mongols, and developed a social structure and conception of royal\n\nThe Ukrainians\n\n•\n\n18\n\nauthority that were more typically feudal than the patrimonial system of Rus. Latin culture penetrated the Galician court and economic ties were mainly with the Baltic and Danube river basins rather than the Volga and Ladoga systems around which Vladimir now based its trade (the once-shared Dnieper system, the ‘route from the Varangians to the Greeks’, being in serious decline). Tomashivskyi’s school have also argued that Galicia–Volhynia was also more ‘European’ in its geography and economy. They have therefore sought to exempt themselves from the agro-cultural determinism propagated by Richard Pipes and others, which argues that the infertile territory of Russia proper is unable to support an accumulative, citybased culture, and in the absence of urban civil society has historically been forced into collective social life and authoritarian state power as the only means of maintaining order.55 Muscovite Russia has been unable to sit still and husband its own meagre resources and has always been an aggressive power coveting its neighbours’ territory. Galicia and Volhynia, however, along with the Kievan heartland when it was not under foreign threat, supposedly provided a fertile forest-protected haven where towns and civic culture were able to develop – an important point in keeping western Ukraine at the centre of the Ukrainian national myth (the steppe zone of south-east Ukraine was at this time still a no-man’sland). Whereas Vladimir and then Muscovy were natural prey to the Golden Horde and soon came to ape its patrimonial authoritarianism, Ukrainian historians have argued, Kiev and Galicia developed a more ‘European’ political culture.56 Ukrainians point out with pride that it is Kiev, not Moscow, that contains a statue celebrating the Magdeburg law (city self-government) which persisted in Ukraine until 1835 – its abolition coming unfortunately not long after the monument was erected in 1802–3 (the monument now has the word ‘Independence’ graffitoed on it – in Russian). Danylo floated the idea of a more formal link with the Catholic West as a means of resisting the Golden Horde, to whom Moscow was already paying tribute. Ukrainian historians have claimed that his representatives accepted a papal crown in 1253, and even that his negotiations with Innocent IV led to his ‘conversion’ and a form of ‘union’ with Rome in 1246–7, Danylo’s predecessor Roman having first considered a similar proposal in 1204.57 Danylo was supposedly recognised as ‘King of Rus’, underlying Halych’s potential supremacy over Vladimir in the north. Significantly, this claim was codified in local historicist mythology, with the main Galician chronicle, the Hypatian Codex, formulating the idea that Halych, not Vladimir, was the real successor to Kiev. Other Ukrainians, including the doyen of historical studies, Mykhailo Hrushevskyi, have seen the Galician-Volhynian experience as transitory. Without a secure hold on Kiev they do not see how it could have been a true Ukrainian state.58 Whatever the case, Poland sought to eradicate all\n\nContesting National Origins: Lays of Ancient Rus\n\n•\n\n19\n\nlinks to Rus in Galicia relatively quickly after it occupied the region in 1349. Further to the east, on the other hand, elements of Rus statehood survived in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Rus and Samogitia founded in the fourteenth century (often misrepresented in Western historiography as the ‘Kingdom of Lithuania’), and even in the Principality of Moldavia (see pages 45–6). Kiev, after all, was also a successor to Kiev. Ukrainian historians reject Russian suggestions that little of significance remained in the former capital after 1240.\n\nConclusions It is vital to begin our story with an honest assessment of the Ukrainians’ and Russians’ common past. The balance of argument supports the claim that the Rus possessed a unity of sorts, at least in terms of the embryonic higher culture that sat above the various tribal cultures. The Orthodox of southern Rus were already different in many respects from their cousins in the north-east, and subsequent events meant their fates would diverge yet further, but as yet there was no well-developed contemporary ideology of difference between the northern and southern Rus. The idea of Rus unity was admittedly only partially developed, but that of two (or more) Ruses was hardly developed at all and is largely a projection of later historians. Internal quarrels tended to pit prince against prince rather than one ethnic group against another. Significantly, it has been easier for Ukrainian historians to take the whole history of Rus and change its subject from ‘the Rus’ or ‘the Russians’ to that of ‘the Ukrainians’ than to write a general history of discord between north and south – in other words to write the Russians out of the picture. The point of the argument that Rus was a Ukrainian or protoUkrainian state is obviously to provide the Ukrainians with a myth of their emergence as a separate nation – as with the Slovak claim that the Great Moravian empire (833–907) was an early Slovak state rather than the original common homeland of both the Czechs and Slovaks, or the Norwegian historians who have portrayed rulers such as Olaf (1015–30) and Håkon IV (1217–63) as definitively independent of Denmark. However, it is perfectly possible to argue that the Rus were a single people, or a pre-national unit, and that the embryonic differences that already existed in 1240 became much greater as a result of the fall of Rus,59 leading to the formation of a truly separate Ukrainian identity by the seventeenth century (see chapters three and four). This is not to subsume the history of one people under that of the other: Rus was simply that which existed before the modern Ukrainian and Russian nations developed. Still less is it to deny the Ukrainians a proper beginning to their history. Nor would it deny the Russians a proper beginning to their history.\n\nThe Ukrainians\n\n•\n\n20\n\nTrue, for most Russians the idea of Kiev as the ‘mother of Russian cities’ is still central to their understanding of their origins as a nation. Moreover, Ukrainian historians have hardly made it easy for Russians to accept the idea of their descent from Andrei Bogoliubskii by lacing their account of Russian ‘ethnogenesis’ with overtones of miscegenation. However, other possibilities do exist. The ‘Eurasianist’ and mystic philosopher Lev Gumilev (1912–92),60 whose views on other questions if not on this particular issue have been highly influential on Russian nationalism in the 1990s, has dated the emergence of the Russian ‘superethnos’ to the post-thirteenth-century synthesis of Rus, Finno-Ugric and Mongol influences. In theory, this approach could allow the Ukrainians to enjoy a separate history of their own, although it tends to be assumed that the Mongol influence affected all the Rus equally.61 Other alternative theories of Russian origin could date their ‘ethnogenesis’ to a direct influence from Byzantium unmediated by Kiev, to the democratic traditions of Novgorod, to ‘the formation of the Moscow state’ or to the ‘indigenous’ traditions developed after the fall of Byzantium in 1453.62 Once again, any of these alternative myths of origin could in principle allow the Ukrainians to be disentangled from Russian history. In practice, none of these approaches is yet common. This is not just an academic problem. Until the equation of ‘Rus’ and ‘Russia’ is no longer universal, modern-day Russians are bound to suffer an existential blackout whenever they are confronted with Ukrainian historiography. They will also have a distorted understanding of their own national origins. Most importantly, however, they will continue to find it difficult to engage with the political reality of an independent Ukrainian state.\n\n2 The Armies of Gog and Magog: Myths of Ukrainian Antiquity\n\nWhat came before Rus? In a period where there is very little written evidence and archaeological sources are open to a variety of interpretations, it would be foolish to say too much. The Rus themselves, or at least their chroniclers, had little real sense of what preceded them.1 Nevertheless, many Ukrainian historians date the beginnings of the Ukrainian nation to as far back as the end of the last ice age, and the Ukrainian view that Kievan Rus was in essence a ‘Ukrainian state’ cannot be fully understood without knowing something of their view as to what came before. A second reason why modern Ukrainians dig so deep into the past is that the geography of pre-Rus civilisations are a closer fit to modern Ukraine than medieval Rus. Most were concentrated on the river Dnieper rather than any further north, and most made a more definitive occupation of south-eastern Ukraine and Crimea than Rus ever did – a fact of paramount importance should these vulnerable borders ever be seriously disputed. The current focus on the ancient era is also a product of the Soviet period, both psychologically (much of the hyperbole is a natural reaction to the Soviet denigration, even denial, of the Ukrainian past) and methodologically. Soviet theory assumed ethnicity was an objective given: the task of historians was therefore to describe ‘ethnogenesis’, identifying various ancient cultures as one’s ancestors. Moreover, much of the research that was undertaken in the Stalinist period to prove the ancient roots of the Russian/Slavic people concentrated on the area around the river Dnieper and has therefore been lifted wholesale by the Ukrainians and given a local spin. The reader will perhaps therefore not mind if we backtrack slightly, thereby avoiding a chronological approach which serves to perpetuate the existential fallacy that there has always been a Ukrainian or Russian nation and the teleological assumption that Rus was some kind of continuation of earlier polities. Some of the wilder flights of historical fancy provide entertainment at least. 21\n\nThe Ukrainians\n\n•\n\n22\n\nJapheth’s Seed ‘Who we are’ depends crucially on ‘where we came from’. Even mainstream Ukrainian historians now tend to argue that Ukrainians and their ancestors have lived on their present territory for thousands of years. Nevertheless, around this central theory of descent are woven versions of history that combine the respectable and the frankly bizarre. Moreover, the further back we go, the more bizarre things tend to get. Since independence, a variety of way-out theories have been popularised by writers such as Yurii Kanyhin and Yurii Shylov, the 1970s dissident Oles Berdnyk and the émigré mystic Lev Sylenko. Many, if not all, mainstream historians steer clear of such arguments,2 but Kanyhin and the others are not just a fringe. One of Kanyhin’s central texts is endorsed with an enthusiastic foreword by ex-president Leonid Kravchuk; another was summarised in the Bulletin of the Academy of Sciences in 1995; Oleksii Bratko-Kutynskyi’s mystical book The Phenomenon of Ukraine was published by Vechirnii Kyïv, Kiev’s traditional evening paper.3 The leitmotif of the ‘ancient origin’ of the Ukrainians is a central feature of Ukrainian nationalism. Many of these works are downright incomprehensible, but three key elements tend to be present in varying degrees: recycled biblical mythology; the claim that Ukraine was the original homeland of all the IndoEuropean peoples; and a peculiar form of Ukrainian Aryanism. Yurii Kanyhin claims that the Bible mentions the Ukrainians at least five times, once for each link in a chain of descent from earliest times to the ‘Ukrainians’ of Kievan Rus. According to Kanyhin, as we ‘read the Bible – the first [reference] was [to] Homer (the Cimmerians), then to Magog (the Scythians), the Madai (the Sarmatians), Tiras (the Slovenes), and finally Tuval/Tubal (the Galician-Ukrainians)’.4 In this particular school of biblical interpretation, the Ukrainians are claimed to be the descendants of Cain, via Lamech, who before the Flood had three sons. As the Bible records (Genesis 10: 5): ‘of these were the isles of nations divided, in their lands, every one after his tongue; after their families, in their nations.’ As the myth has it, the descendants of the first son, Jabal, peopled the Middle East; those of the second, Jubal, Greece. The Slavs are descended from the third son, Tubal-Cain and his sister Naamah, via Magog and Tiras, sons of Japheth. The tongue of the sons of Japheth was the original Slavonic. According to Kanyhin, Ukraine was first known as Tubal (Tuval) or Tiras (Firas), supposedly the country in ‘the far recesses of the north’ mentioned in Ezekiel 38:2; 15.5 The Ukrainians’ ancestors were therefore the people named by the Bible as the Magog, whose divinely ordained mission was to oppose the armies of Gog, ‘the dark forces of Asia’,6 and lead the ‘White’ peoples against the ‘Black’. According to the authors of one popular text: ‘our ancestors were the illustrious Magog,\n\nThe Armies of Gog and Magog: Myths of Ukrainian Antiquity\n\n•\n\n23\n\nwho through the ages fought to the death in battle against the rapacious Gogs of the steppe, and shielded Western (Christian) civilisation from fatal inroads and invasions. The history of early Ukraine and Ukraine itself has, it can be said, a clear and explicit “Anti-Gog” character.’7 One of the key Ukrainian national myths, the image of Ukraine as the frontier of European civilisation against the encroachment of barbarian Asia, thus has a very early beginning indeed. As eloquently argued by Neal Ascherson in his book Black Sea, the lands to the north of Asia Minor have often been depicted as the beginning of the barbarian world, and the steppe zone characterised as the preserve of warrior-nomads.8 A quick glance at any popular map of the ancient world confirms a blank space or warning ‘there be monsters’ in this spot. Eccentric as the likes of Kanyhin may be, Ukrainians therefore have an obvious interest in counteracting such stereotypes by shifting the historical boundaries of ‘civilisation’ sufficiently far to the east. The idea that the Ukrainians were the ‘Magog’, however, is confusing to say the least. Ezekiel in fact refers to ‘Gog, the prince of Rosh [supposedly the Rus], Meshech and Tubal, in the land of Magog’ (38: 1–2). As Gog is ‘prince of’ the Magog, the two are presumably one and the same. Moreover, they are both on the wrong side of the divide between chaos and civilisation. It is the armies of ‘Gog and Magog’ that Revelation (20: 8–9) prophesies will be unleashed against the Lord’s Kingdom on Judgment Day, and they have become jointly synonymous with the threat of apocalypse. It is surprising that the Ukrainians would want to be associated with either. The English artist John Martin (1789–1854), for example, in his monumental painting The Last Judgment (1853) puts as clear a divide as possible between the righteous (assembled on the left) and the damned (being cast into utter darkness on the right), with the armies of Gog and Magog being repulsed from the Holy City of Jerusalem the most prominent part of the latter (see plate 19).9 Nevertheless, the idea that the Ukrainians, or indeed all the Slavs, are descended from Japheth has a long pedigree. It appears in the main Rus chronicle The Tale of Bygone Years, which states that, ‘after the flood, the sons of Noah (Shem, Ham and Japheth) divided the earth among them . . . to the lot of Japheth fell the northern and western sectors (including the land of Rus).’10 Japheth’s sons are often claimed to have been the first inhabitants of Kiev. The myth was still common in the seventeenth century, in texts such as Metropolitan Iov Boretskyi’s Protestation (1621), which describes the Ukrainian Cossacks as ‘the tribe of the glorious Rus nation of Japheth’s seed’,11 and in the old Russian myth that Moscow was founded by Mosokh, the sixth son of Japheth. The Polish nobility of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries believed they were descended from Japheth, while their peasants were the sons and daughters of Ham.12 The idea is even to be found in the work of the Soviet linguist Nikolai Marr (1864/5–1934), who argued\n\nThe Ukrainians\n\n•\n\n24\n\nthat all the Slavs could be grouped in a single ‘Japhetic’ language family, from whose original root other ‘ancient’ languages such as Hebrew and Etruscan are descended. Georgian nationalists, in particular the ill-fated president Zviad Gamsakhurdia, have also made use of the myth, arguing that all the ‘Japhetic’ languages are descended from the original Georgian Ursprache (universal language).13 The second element in this peculiar melange of ideas is the notion that Ukraine was the original homeland (Urheimat) of all the Indo-European peoples. The myth of a common mother culture for all the IndoEuropeans has proved remarkably persistent, as have attempts to pin it down geographically and to identify an original Ursprache as its mothertongue.14 The Ukrainian version is that the original homeland was around the lower Dnieper in the fourth to third millennium BC. Moreover, it is claimed that the Ukrainians were the first speakers of Sanskrit, since the nineteenth century the favourite candidate for an Ursprache. ‘Ukrainian/Sanskrit’ is therefore the mother of all the IndoEuropean languages,15 and it was the ancient Ukrainians who first exported the secrets of the Hindu Veda to India. The Ukrainian language, ‘the language of the world aristocracy’, is therefore as much as 25,000 years old.16 Some of this is not as barmy as it seems. Several mainstream scholars have also placed the Indo-European ‘homeland’ on the Ukrainian steppe, rather than in Asia or elsewhere.17 Colin Renfrew has placed it nearby, in Anatolia.18 The philosopher Leibnitz (1646–1716) thought that all the European languages originated from ‘Scythia’ (that is modern Ukraine – see pages 28–30). The Ukrainian Indo-European theory is, however, tarnished by its association with the belief that the Ukrainians were also the original Aryans. Although Aryanism in general – the myth of an original White race – has been discredited in most people’s eyes by its adoption by the Nazis, it is enjoying a rather dubious afterlife in Ukraine. Ukrainian scholars have argued in their defence that theirs is a linguistic, not a racial conception.19 According to Kanyhin and others, an Aryan is supposedly a ‘tiller of the soil’ (khliborob) or ‘ploughman’ (orach), and therefore an archetypal Ukrainian.20 The word orach is supposedly derived from the ancient Ukrainian god Ora, hence orii or arii, meaning ‘Aryan’ in Ukrainian. The Ukrainian Aryans are therefore more properly labelled Oriiany.21 In the Ukrainian version of Aryanism, the Aryans first appeared in north-western Europe around 20,000 years ago, roaming the steppe from the Carpathian mountains to Tibet and the Hindu Kush, but eventually made their home in what is now Ukraine, whose ‘boundless steppes are the Aryan Golgotha’.22 The ancient name for this homeland was Oriiana, which is depicted on the cover of one of Sylenko’s books (Guest from the Tomb of our Forefathers) as the centre of the ancient world.\n\nThe Armies of Gog and Magog: Myths of Ukrainian Antiquity\n\n•\n\n25\n\nIll. 3. Lev Sylenko, ‘Guest from the Tomb of our Forefathers’, showing early Ukraine or Oriiana as the centre of the ancient world and of ancient agriculture\n\nWithout much in the way of concrete archaeological evidence, the case for Ukraine’s Aryan heritage tends to focus on the alleged antiquity of certain Ukrainian ‘national’ particularities. For example, the trident of Prince Volodymyr, now the official symbol of the state, was supposedly in use long before the time of Rus, as was the sign of the sun, the eight-pointed star and various forms of the swastika, such as that now used by nationalist groups like the sinister paramilitary Ukrainian People’s Self-Defence Force (UNSO).23 The Aryan belief-system that centred around the worship of sun gods seems to have persisted in Ukrainian popular religion up to the time of Rus and beyond. The argument of racial descent is, however, also made, in glossy publications that can be bought in Kiev’s main square.24 On the other hand, much of this mythology echoes, or just copies, Russian neo-pagan theories, such as the obvious forgery produced in the Brezhnev era by Valerii Skurlatov, The Book of Vlas – the ‘Vlas’ being the original Russian Aryans. The ideologues of the Russian New Right are just as prone as their Ukrainian equivalents to mystical speculations about obscure pagan symbols and the links between Rus, Atlantis and Egypt.25\n\nThe Trypillians The Aryan line has been traced throughout Ukrainian history. According\n\nThe Ukrainians\n\n•\n\n26\n\nto Kanyhin, ‘the Cimmerians, Scythians, Sarmatians, Antes, Tavrians [Crimeans], “White” Huns, Slovenes, Polovtsians, Kipchaks, and, eventually, the Rusych-Ukrainians [all] belonged to the Aryanised peoples, who played a huge creative and civilising role [throughout the ancient world], and who received the biblical name Magog.’26 The first proper ‘Aryan’ civilisation in Ukraine is held to have been the Trypillian (or Tripolye) archaeological culture, named after the village below Kiev on the river Dnieper, where painted pottery, clay figurines and farming implements were discovered by the Czech archaeologist Vikentii Chvojka (Khvoika) in the 1890s. Belief in the Trypillian origin of the Ukrainian nation spreads far beyond the ranks of Ukrainian ‘Aryanists’ and is a relatively mainstream nationalist idea, having been popularised by the archaeologist Viktor Petrov (1894–1969).27 The Trypillian culture is normally dated to the late Neolithic or Eneolithic (Copper) eras, sometime between 4000 and 2700BC, although some Ukrainians would place its origins as early as the sixth millennium BC. It was not necessarily unique to Ukraine: similar remains have been found at the Cucuteni site in Romania (more than 100 sites exist in total). Other archaeologists have therefore supported the theory of the Thraco-Phrygian origin of the Trypillian culture – it may have had little to do with the Indo-Europeans, let alone the early Slavs. Nevertheless, Ukrainian archaeologists such as Vadym Shcherbakivskyi, Oleh Kandyba and Yaroslav Pasternak have claimed that it provides evidence of an early Ukrainian civilisation,28 even bizarrely a ‘state’ known as Arrata, ‘which in the period of its development embraced the territory of what are now Poltava, Cherkasy and Kiev oblasts (for Ukraine’s modern territorial divisions; see the map on p. 173), and further to the west the whole of the region up to the Dniester and the Danube.’29 The claims made for Arrata-Trypillia are astonishing, but reveal much about the perceived need to anchor Ukrainian identity in a more prestigious past. Ukrainians have claimed for example that Arrata was ‘the first post-Diluvian civilisation on the planet, which gave mankind “modern” agricultural technology’, ‘before Egyptian or Sumerian civilisation’ even existed.30 ‘The horse and cart – the first human transport – was invented in Ukraine’, the Trypillians having been the first people properly to domesticate the horse.31 The highly talented Trypillians, the world’s oldest metallurgists,32 also made copper farming implements and used harnessed oxen. They were able to create a grain-exporting civilisation at a time when life further north (that is, in modern Russia) was still primitive and precarious. It seems that the ancient Egyptians had to buy their bread from Trypillia.33 Thus another key component of the Ukrainian self-image takes root, the idea of themselves as a uniquely productive agricultural people, even as the fathers of world agriculture. Ukrainians, it is pointed out, occupy almost ‘two-thirds’ of the world’s ‘best land’, including not only\n\nThe Armies of Gog and Magog: Myths of Ukrainian Antiquity\n\n•\n\n27\n\nUkraine’s own ‘black earth’ but the land settled by Ukrainian émigrés in the American and Canadian prairies, the Argentinian pampas and the Australian outback. Ukrainians have always sought out the best land, in natural symbiosis with the fertile territory beside the river Dnieper, which has therefore provided the ecological ‘genesis of indigenism’ in Ukraine.34 In other words, the local people have a long history of staying put in order to enjoy its riches. The lost Arcadian golden age referred to in Greek legend is even meant to have taken place in Ukraine, thanks to ‘its warm climate, fertile black earth, flat fecund steppe, the clean waters of its rivers and its masses of wild animals’.35 To the writer Yevhen Malaniuk (1897–1968) Ukraine was the ‘Hellas of the Steppe’. Arrata-Trypillia had all the other attributes of a developed civilisation, with ‘towns’ of 500 inhabitants or more, two-storey buildings and long defensive ‘anti-barbarian’ walls, long before the building of the Great Wall of China.36 The population so protected thrived to the point where ‘the number of inhabitants in the region from the Dnieper to the Carpathians and the Dniester reached two million’.37 Sadly, concrete evidence of these achievements has not been found. Nevertheless, this has not prevented Ukrainian publicists from making even more outlandish claims, such as ‘modern literacy in Europe comes not from Egypt or Mesopotamia, but from Arrata. [The Trypillians possessed] a written alphabet, which the Phoenicians merely spread.’38 The Trypillians’ ‘written symbols’39 were passed on in adapted form to the Greeks via the Cimmerians, and to the Romans via ‘the Etruscans, [who were] also émigrés from Arrata’ (the Etrus-cans, none too obviously, bear the Ukrainians’ later proper name, the Rus).40 Wandering Trypillians founded the Sumerian (building the ziggurats) and Hittite civilisations, and settled in Palestine (leading to the particularly bizarre claim that Christ’s ancestors were from Galicia).41 Budda and Zarathustra were Trypillians/Ukrainians. The Typillians/Ukrainians invented the calendar,42 and their craftsmen even helped to build Stonehenge, which, just to complete the impression of careful historical research, is described in one source as ‘a temple in Scotland’.43\n\nThe Horsemen of Herodotus After the Trypillians came the little-known Cimmerians. Homer’s Odyssey refers fleetingly to the land and city of the Cimmerians, shrouded in mist and cloud, and never does the shining sun look down on them with his rays.44 Many Ukrainian scholars argue that the Cimmerians were the direct descendants of the Trypillians, other archaeologists that they were once\n\nThe Ukrainians\n\n•\n\n28\n\nagain probably of Thraco-Phrygian origin. Their art and implements have much in common with the finds at Hallstatt in Austria, with its Celtic and Danubian influences – a sign to some of Ukraine’s early and close connection with the West, evidence for others of just how inappropriate it is to attach ethnic labels to pottery collections. After the Cimmerians came the Scythians, probably sometime in the seventh century BC. Most scholars argue that they emerged from the eastern steppe, but Ukrainian nationalists have claimed that they were locals, the direct descendants of the original Aryans, whose three founding ‘tsars’ (Lipoksai, Arpoksai and Kolaksai, lords of the mountains, sea and sun) were the sons of Magog, son of Japheth.45 As with the Trypillian myth therefore, history is often mixed with fantasy. Much more, however, is known about the Scythians. In the Ukrainian version of events, by the sixth century BC the Scythians ‘had created a great state from the Dniester to the Don’, which developed from a mere ‘union of tribes into a single people, united under the leadership’ of the tsar Ateas in the fourth century BC.46 The Scythians were also fearsome warriors. Some Ukrainians have claimed that the prophet Jeremiah’s warning to the Israelites refers to the Scythians, the people later called the Magog, who laid waste to large parts of the Near East in the seventh century BC: ‘Behold, a people cometh from the north country; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth. They lay hand on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voices roar like the sea and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as men to the battle against thee, O daughter of Zion’ (Jeremiah 6: 22–3; see also 5: 15–17). The Scythians are also described in the Histories of Herodotus (c485–425BC). Herodotus is credited by Ukrainian historians with distinguishing between the Scythian ruling elite, the ‘Royal Scythians’, and the ‘Neuri’, the ‘Scythian orachi’ or ploughmen, who were in fact the more properly proto-Ukrainian indigenous inhabitants, descendants, once again, of the Trypillians.47 Some have also claim"
