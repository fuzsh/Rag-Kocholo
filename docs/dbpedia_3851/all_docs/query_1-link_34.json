        "text": "The Role of Language in (Recreating Tatar Diaspora Identity: The Case of the Estonian Tatars\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaarja Klaas\n\n2015-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper focuses on the meanings assigned to Tatar language among the Tatar diaspora in Estonia. According to interviews with Estonian Tatars as well as descriptions of field material from Tatarstan, language is an important aspect of Tatar ethnic identity. This paper will track common discourses about the Tatar language and the way it is connected to Tatar ethnic identity. Issues concerning Tatar language are used to demonstrate various ways of enacting Tatarness in Estonia. It is shown that Estonian Tatars worry about the vitality and purity of Tatar language, but for some, marginalization of dialects is also an issue. People categorized with the same identity labels by self and others can experience and enact their Tatarness in a variety of different ways.\n\nTatar Virtual Institute of Kayum Nasyri\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLiliia Shaiakhmetova\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The article is devoted to the study of structure and activity of the network of centers of Tatar virtual Institute of Kayum Nasyri, created on the basis of Institute of Philology and Intercultural Communication after Leo Tolstoy of Kazan Federal University. The aim of the Institute of Kayum Nasyri is the desire to become a world brand in its field. In this context, the Institute relies on the experience of such world-known educational centers as the British Council, the Institute named after Goethe, Cervantes Institute, Confucius Institute and Institute by Yunus Emre. The Institute's activities are associated with the development of collaboration in the field of education, support, promotion and development of the Tatar language and culture in the regions of the Russian Federation, countries of near and far abroad. There are 7 educational-cultural centers in the Institute at this moment. Each center is supplied with educational, informative literature and fiction, as well as the video-conferencing system for training, conferences and events online. The Institute of Kayum Nasyri is named after the famous Tatar educator. As a fervent supporter of friendship between Russian and Tatar people, he was the first of the educators to acquaintance the Tatars with the Russian history and culture in their native language, translated into the Tatar language many textbooks on geography, physics, mathematics, etc. Kayum Nasyri at the time, made the Russian-Tatar dictionary, was the author of a textbook of Russian grammar for the Tatars, as well as of the significant works in the field of the Tatar linguistics.\n\nTPÃ Akadeemilise Raamatukogu ajaloolised kogud rahvusvahelistes infoallikates / Tiiu Reimo\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nReimo, Tiiu, 1953-\n\n2005-01-01\n\nLk. 99 mainitud : Urve LÃµhmus, Voldemar Miller, Tiiu Reimo; lk. 100 : Voldemar Miller, Kyra Robert; lk. 102 : Tiiu Reimo, Medea Jerser, Toomas Raudam; lk. 103 : Antti Oviir, Aita JÃµulu; lk. 104 : Tiiu Reimo, Marita Paas, Mati Merioja, Tiiu Pukk, Eve Roosileht\n\nThe Tatar Genealogies (shedzheres Â»\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nM.I. Akhmetzyanov\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The article is aimed at studying the relationship between the modern Tatar publicistic and medieval written monuments of the Golden Horde, Crimea, and Kazan Khanate. Since the medieval Tatar written monuments are syncretic in content, they have the features of many types of genres of contemporary written document. In this case, the article sets the task to emphasize the similarity of these monuments with modern documents with publicistic content. As a result of research the author found that the medieval Tatar official yarlyks, charters and letters are the precursors of contemporary governmental letters and agreements. The only difference is that they are likely to reflect the official State ideology, whereas the modern Tatar publicistics reflect the public reaction to the news in the life of society.\n\nMida arvavad koolist ÃµppejÃµud vÃ¤ljastpoolt akadeemiat? / Tiiu Reimo, Kaie Holm, Malle Ermel, Tiiu Valm\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTLÃ Infoteaduste Instituudi direktori Tiiu Reimo, Tallinna Keskraamatukogu direktori Kaie Holmi, Tartu Ãlikooli Raamatukogu direktori kt Malle Ermeli ja kirjastuse TEA toimetuse juhataja Tiiu Valmi arvamused infoteaduse ja raamatukogunduse alase Ãµppe korraldusest Viljandi Kultuuriakadeemias\n\nEssay Genre in Tatar Journalism\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAigul A. Guseinova\n\n2017-11-01\n\nFull Text Available In this article, an essay is considered as a journalistic genre in the context of modern Tatar journalism. Using the example of works by contemporary authors in the Tatar-speaking periodicals of Russia, the main genre and the semantic features of this genre are studied. An essay is a publicistic form to reflect on the topical issues of Russian reality. The reproduction of a fact is not so important for an essay. An important role is played by the description of the author's impressions, reflections and emotions. The periodical press has many materials in the Tatar language in which the author's opinion, author's principle and subjective opinion are strongly expressed. In fact, during the last decades of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first century there was a surge of essays in modern journalism. Due to some political events in Russia during the early 90s of the twentieth century, it was possible to express their thoughts and speak on the urgent problems in society openly in comparison with the Soviet reality. The object of research is essayism as a kind of journalistic creativity, the subject of the study is the essay genre in Tatar journalism. The empirical basis of the work consisted of the essays from Tatar journalists, publicists and writers. Provided that the personality of an author is one of the effectiveness factors concerning the publications in the genre of essay, the essayization of texts in Tatar journalism will be increased in the future.\n\nThe Ancient Tatar States in Central Asia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nS.G. Klyashtorny\n\n2013-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The article examines the earliest stages of the history of the Tatars. The origins of the Tatars are traced from the collapse of both the Han Empire and the Empire of Xiongnu and are considered during the subsequent periods preceding the emergence of the empire of Genghis Khan. The author argues that the Tatar state appeared long before the Mongol era, providing information on the resettlement of the Tatars in the 9th and 10th centuries, which explains why a century later the Mongols, who occupied the same space, were called the âTatarsâ in the Turkic and Muslim environment, as well as in China. This Turkic desigÂ­nation of the Mongols took root not only in Central Asia and the Middle East but also in Russia and Western Europe.\n\nWEAPONS COMPLEX OF RUSSIAN SERVING TATARS IN XV-XVII TH CENTURIES\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nÐ Ð ÐÐ»ÑÑÐ¸Ð½\n\n2014-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The article considers the issue of the offensive and defensive armament of the serving Tatars of the Moscow state in the XV-XVIIth centuries, its research degree in the national historiography, the opportunities and prospects of its enhanced studying. The serving Tatars were one of the categories of the Moscow state nobility, which is reflected, first of all, in written sources. The weapons complex of Russian serving Tatars included minimal armour. European sources do not mention armour and helms or shield. But noble Tatars could have costly armour of many types that were used in that epoch by peoples of Eastern Europe and Middle East - Russians, Persians, Turks. The basic weapons of the serving Tatars were bows and arrows. In the close combat they were using sabres, and (rarely spears. The fire weapon was not used by the serving Tatars (or they used it very rarely and it was not characteristic for their weapons complex, because it was ineffective in their tactics. The serving Tatars were light mobile horse archers that preferred battles of long-distance.\n\nTheory of Tatar Origin of the Yakuts\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nV.V. Ushnitsky\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The article examines the problem of the origin of the people of Sakha (Yakutia in the light of the latest research. Basing on archaeological materials the ethnogenesis of Sakha is associated with the Baikal regionâs Ustâ-Talâkinsky archaeological culture of the 12thâ14th centuries. Analysis of written sources allows to associate representatives of Ustâ-Talâkinsky archaeological culture with the Usutu-mangun tribe identical with the Angara Tatars and referred to in the writings of Rashid al-Din and Abu al-Ghazi. Probably, the Angara Tatars migrated from Central Asia and compactly inhabited the Angara region near Lake Buir-Nur. The article analyzes connection between Sakha folklore sources and real history of Central Asian Tatars.\n\nThe Invasion of the Christian West by the Tatars (Mongols. A Clash of Civilizations between Frederick II, Gregory IX and the Tatars\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHuub Kurstjens\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Research objectives: The author of this article wants to show how the clash of two diÂ­fÂ­ferent civilizations, until then practically unaware of the otherâs existence, the Tatars and the Christian West, undermined the superior and self-confident position of the latter. In the authorâs view, Western Christian Society in the first part of the thirteenth century regarded itself as superior to other civilizations. This article is not focused on either civilization, but tries to unveil motives, background and perspectives from both sidesâ attempts to try to be the strongest power and the most important civilization at that time. In the Christian West there was a constant struggle for power between the Pope and the Emperor, going back to the Investiture Controversy of the eleventh and twelfth centuries and culminating in the conflict between Emperor Frederick II and the papacy in the thirteenth century. At the height of that struggle, in 1241, the Tatars (Mongols invaded Hungary and Poland. Western Civilization was threatened, although at first almost nobody realized the danger and underestimated the consequences. It was due to the superior tactics of the Tatars that they surprised the Christian West. The Tatars were far better in their communication, strategy and information than the divided society in the West. The Tatar invasion, through their use of a kind of Tsunami StraÂ­tegy, had all the necessary ingredients to destroy Western, Christian society. Research materials: By using contemporary sources and books that illuminate the Tatars as well as the Christian West, the character of the conflict that took place becomes clear. Results and novelty of the research: The end result was a clash of civilizations, an expÂ­losive mixture of a political-cultural conflict, a time-bomb which ultimately, narrowly, failed to explode, thanks to a sudden and somewhat mysterious retreat of the Tatars, but leaving Western Civilization faced with an\n\nCampaigns of the Crimean Tatars and Ottomans against Iran\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nÃzer KÃ¼peli\n\n2014-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Starting from the 15th century, when the Crimean Khanate recognized the authority of the Ottoman Empire, its forces was actively used by the Ottoman Empire in its foreign policy. Especially the Tatars were indispensable allies in campaigns against Western European countries, Caucasus, and, subsequently, in the containment of the Moscow State. However, Tatar troops of the Crimean Khanate were also used in other political directions of the Ottoman Empire. The main rival of the Ottoman State in the east was the Safavid Iran. Troops of the Crimean Khanate also took part in these campaigns of the Ottomans. The author describes the participation of Tatar troops in the war with Iran. During the Ottoman military campaigns, the Tatars, for the most part, played a role of Akinji moving ahead of the Ottoman forces and collecting trophies and prey in hostile lands, rather than participating in the frontline battles. Initially, the Crimean khans participated only in the wars that took place in the western territories. However, the situation changed in the second half of the 16th century under Sultan Suleiman, when the Crimean cavalry was also involved in the eastern campaigns. The Tatars did not particularly want to participate in campaigns against Iran. There were cases, when these campaigns ended in tears: with the capture of the heir to the Crimean throne (Adil Giray, its execution and the defeat of the Tatar army. However, the Crimean khans participated in every campaign against Iran on the side of the Ottoman Empire. Disobeying the Sultan orders could lead to the replacement of khan (Mehmed Giray II. Archive documents reveal that the number of Tatar troops sent against Iran, ranged from 5 to 10 thousand soldiers, although the Ottoman sources overestimates the amount (30â40 thousand.\n\nA Word on âEtymological Dictionary of the Tatar Languageâ Â»\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nR.T. Safarov\n\n2016-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Research in the field of etymology demands from a specialist in-depth knowledge, vast erudition, language skills, extensive work experience. Therefore, there are not many works in this area in Tatar linguistics. Rifkat Gazizzyanovich Akhmetyanov is a linguist who devoted his life to this particular field of linguistics. His âEymological Dictionary of the Tatar Languageâ is a long-awaited work not only for the Tatar humanitarians, but also for the whole Turkic world and researchers of the history and language of the ethnic groups neighboring with the Tatars. This is the first fundamental etymological dictionary in Tatar linguistics. The two-volume dictionary contains information about the origin and formation of approximately 10 300 words, not counting their numerous variants. First of all, the authorâs intention was to give an etymological analysis of the lexical structure of the Tatar literary language. Therefore, the dictionary contains all the root words of the three-volume explanatory dictionary of the Tatar language, published in 1977â1981. Special attention was also given to actively developing etymology of dialect vocabulary linking the Tatar language with other Turkic languages or borrowed from other languages. In general, each entry is composed of vocable, its translation into Russian, dialectal variants with their values, indications of source language (if it is a borrowing, area of distribution, i.e. parallels of analyzed lexema, first of all, from the Turkic or, in certain cases, from the Slavic and Finno-Ugric and other languages (if it is not a borrowing. If the etymology of the word is clear, the author points out it. If it causes some controversy, he cites the opinion of authoritative researchers, expresses his attitude and so on. The huge linguistic material based on the consistent scientific principles, studied in details and recorded in the dictionary, allows us to form an opinion on the influence of other languages on\n\nCRIMEAN TATAR FACTOR IN CRIMEA: THE CURRENT STATE AND PROSPECTS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nD.

That the subjectsof the hero concept are treated in all issues of Kazan UtlarÄ± (the KazanLights, a literary journal published in Kazan, is a clear evidence of it.Such ideas as âpositive heroâ, âexemplary heroâ, âour dayâs heroâ,âmasked heroâ and âchallenging heroâ are often encountered in theliterary criticism texts of the recent years. The complicated hero conceptand the positive hero in the literature of recent years, which has beeninfluenced by the freedom movement, does not correspond with thedemands of the perfect hero concepts in the Soviet literature because ofthe enrichment of the former in terms of theme and style, progress ofpsychologism and of prevalence of lyrical and critical works.Nevertheless, some authors, though not in the level of the ideal of life,make efforts to create positive heroes who have a great faculty ofdecency.This paper will concentrate on the principles of the creation of thepositive hero, ideas and experiences of such men of the Tatar literaturein recent years as D. Zahidullina, A. Helim, G. GÄ±ylmanov and F.Beyremova. From the old literature to 1980âs literature will be reviewedand examples of the positive hero are given from the literary works ofthe period. In the Tatar literature in recent years, the characteristics ofthe positive hero have been ascertained in the works of F. Safin, M.Malikova, A. Helim and F.

Kazan-Tatar Turkological School\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA.V. Aksanov\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This book describes the history and current state of the Kazan-Tatar Turkological school. Its author analyzes the development of global and domestic Turkology, points out interrelations between various academic centers and specifies the convention of their separation. According to him, the Tatars played a significant role in the development of the Russian Oriental studies, since already from the 18th century, they collaborated with leading Russian Orientalists. The establishment of the University of Kazan in 1804 was a milestone in the development of Kazan School of Turkic Studies. The 1820â50s were a time of the highest development of Oriental studies in the University of Kazan. In addition to personnel training, the University created textbooks, dictionaries, scholarly works, collected manuscripts and established extensive international contacts. Soviet and modern periods were mainly related to the development of the historical and philological direction within the walls of educational institutions and the University of Kazan. In 2011, their Tatar faculties were united into the Institute of Philology and Arts of Kazan Federal University. Formation and development of the history of Tatar literature as an independent branch of literary science became one of the most important achievements of this stage. Great work on the collection, publication and study of Tatar folklore done in the last century was another important achievement.\n\nFeatures of Woman Journal in Tatar Language\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAigul A.

Despite important expansions of access to conventional treatments, there are still significant proportions of affected individuals who remain outside the reach of the current treatment system and who contribute disproportionately to health care and criminal justice costs as well as to public disorder associated with drug addiction. The NAOMI study is a Phase III randomized clinical trial comparing injectable heroin maintenance to oral methadone. The study has ethics board approval at its MontrÃ©al and Vancouver sites, as well as from the University of Toronto, the New York Academy of Medicine and Johns Hopkins University. The main objective of the NAOMI Study is to determine whether the closely supervised provision of injectable, pharmaceutical-grade opioid agonist is more effective than methadone alone in recruiting, retaining, and benefiting chronic, opioid-dependent, injection drug users who are resistant to current standard treatment options. Methods The case study submitted chronicles the challenges of getting a heroin assisted treatment trial up and running in North America. It describes: a brief background on opioid addiction; current standard therapies for opioid addiction; why there is/was a need for a heroin assisted treatment trial; a description of heroin assisted treatment; the beginnings of creating the NAOMI study in North America; what is the NAOMI study; the science and politics of the NAOMI study; getting NAOMI started in Canada; various requirements and restrictions in getting the study up and running; recruitment into the study; working with the media; a status report on the study; and a brief conclusion from the authors' perspectives. Results and conclusion As this is a case study, there are no specific results or main findings listed.

Editorial board of the monograph consists of leading scholars from academic centers in Russia and abroad. The book is divided into 4 chapters. The first chapter talks about the history of ancient nomads in the Cisuralic region. The second chapter examines the Volga-Kama Bulgaria and political unification of the Turkic nomads. The third chapter is dedicated to the formation of the Golden Horde state and the history of the formation of the Tatar people. The final fourth chapter discusses the Tatar khanates (Kazan and Siberian yurts, the Nogai Horde. An appendix including 55 narrative source is an important part of the collective monograph âHistory of the Tatars of the Cisuralic Regionâ. The authors of the first volume have not only succeeded to considerably fill the lacuna of historical knowledge about the Cisuralic Tatars, but also largely revise existing ideas about ethnogenesis of other Turko-Tatar and Finno-Ugric peoples in the region. This work does not provide all the answers. However, the important thing is that the authors of the monograph have succeeded to present new problems and outline prospects for further research. In the future, it is necessary to continue to study the process of ethnic migrations, which began in the Cisuralic region in the middle of the 16th century as well as the problems linked to the inclusion of these communities into the Russian state and other issues related to the history of the Cisuralic Tatars.\n\nIntergeneration transmission of cultural heritage of polish Tatars family in the years 1918 - 1939\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nURSZULA WRÃBLEWSKA\n\n2017-10-01\n\nFull Text Available The subject matter of my article is analysis religion educational and cultural processes, which influenced in family on Polish Muslim Tatars during the period between World Wars.

Most important among them are Vita of King Stephen UroÅ¡ II Milutin (1282â1321, extant in three different editions and Vita of Archbishop Daniel II (1324â1337. The first one offers insight into the relations between the Kingdom of Serbia and the powerful Juchid prince Nogai, while in the latter, the key role of Tatar contingents in internal power struggle between king Milutin and his brother Stephen Dragutin is mentioned. The presence of Tatars in the Battle of Velbazhd (1330, fought between Serbia and the Bulgarian Empire, is also attested in various sources, including the so-called Old Serbian chronicles and the Code of Law of Emperor Stephen DuÅ¡an (1349. Another group of sources analyzed in the text are several apocryphal writings of South Slavic literature. Their value lies in the fact that they reflect the image of the Tatars in the eyes of the Balkan Slavs. Last, but not least important testimony of Tatar activities in Serbian lands is preserved in place-names of Tatar origin, recorded in royal charters, issued by Milutinâs son Stephen (1321â1331 and grandson Stephen DuÅ¡an (1331â1355.\n\nTiiu Truus : minimalism on elatav / Aale Kask\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nKask, Aale\n\n2008-01-01\n\nSisearhitekt Tiiu Truus sisearhitekti tÃ¶Ã¶st, disainkodust, oma materjalieelistustest, mÃ¶Ã¶bli, treppide ja kaminate ise disainimisest, koostÃ¶Ã¶st tellijatega, inspiratsiooniallikatest.

The disadvantage is the physicians directly visualize the anatomical structures in an open surgery for lung cancer biopsy procedure. There is a need to develop an instrument that may help the physician to guarantee the accuracy and efficiency while performing needle aspiration biopsy. Therefore, a needle aspiration biopsy monitoring instrument or named as NAOMI is proposed. It consists of a microcontroller system, an IMU sensor, an ultrasonic ranging module, a bluetooth module, and a 9V lithium battery. The experimental testing consist of performance testing, functional testing using chest phantom, and user acceptances. The results showed that the NAOMI improve the accuracy and efficiency while performing the needle biopsy operation.\n\nThe Impact of Socioeconomic Status and Population Size on the Use of the Tatar Language at Home\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTovar-GarcÃ­a, Edgar Demetrio; Podmazin, Evgeny\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBased on econometric methods, we found that Tatar children from families with better material conditions and those who live in bigger cities are more likely to use the Russian language at home.

Averkiev âTatar Influence on the Life of the Russian Peopleâ\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nV.V. Trepavlov\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The article contains a review of the book by S.S. Averkiev (1886â1963, which remained unpublished during the Soviet period, since such a topic was at that time unpopular, questionable, and therefore âinadmissibleâ for Soviet publishers. S.S. Averkiev saw the influence of the Tatars on various aspects of the social and cultural life of the Russian people in an extremely wide spectrum. This can even be judged by the chaptersâ titles: âThe Influence of Tatars on Administrative Management, Financesâ, âThe Influence of Tatars on Trade and Industryâ, âEveryday Lifeâ, âManners and Customsâ, âPeopleâs Literatureâ. The authorâs research enthusiasm often encouraged him to seek the Tatar âconnectionâ, where borrowings actually took place from Persia and the Arab countries, from the peoples of Central Asia. Perhaps, the obsolete, pre-revolutionary general designation of Turkic-speaking peoples as Tatars to some extent affected the author in this respect. Averkiev does not insist that all selected cases and examples of borrowings were certainly associated with the Golden Horde and the later Tatar khanates. The topic of Averkievâs book is not new at all. Attempts to identify the various manifestations of the civilizational connection between Russia and the East have been repeatedly made in historiography. As a rule, borrowings from the Golden Horde of the 13thâ15th centuries and from the earlier Turkic states are considered a clear indicator of such a connection. Of course, indisputable examples exist: first of all, in the Russian titulature and social terminology, financial system of medieval Rusâ, organization of the yam-service, and so on.\n\nASHIQ OMER IN THE MODERN CRIMEAN TATAR LITERATURE MODERN KIRIM-TATAR EDEBÄ°YATINDA ÃÅIK ÃMER\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEmek ÃÅENMEZ\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Ashiq Omer is a bard of the 17th century.

Judging by contents of the letter, Zamoyski did not hide his desire to be justified in the eyes of the Roman Curia for the ineffectiveness of his actions, which would have to prevent Tatars to invade Hungary through Ukrainian territory that was subordinated to Rzeczpospolita. Thus, this letter is interesting for two reasons. In the first place, Zamoyskiâs letter contains detailed information about movement of Tartar troops to the west and stratagemme of khan Ghazi Giray, which allowed Tatars to lull Polish hetman and painlessly penetrate into Hungarian territory. On the other hand, the letter contains somewhat clumsy attempts of Zamoyski to justify his unsuccessful actions, which represent a particular interest. This article, therefore, contains the Latin text of the letter and its Russian translation as well as the preface and necessary comments to the text explaining the reasons and the very course of Tatar invasion of the Kingdom of Hungary. In addition, the authors placed facsimiles of two handwritten copies of the letter from the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan at the end of the article.\n\nLes compositions mÃ©morielles autour de la Guerre patriotique.

The Example of the Memory of Musa Dzhalil, Tatar, Stalinist, Poet and Patriot\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFranÃ§oise DaucÃ©\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This article proposes to study the memorial destiny of Musa Dzhalil, a Tatar poet well-known in Russia for his Moabit Notebook written in the Berlin prison where he died in 1944. After 1956, he became posthumously an official Hero of the Soviet Union and won the Lenin Prize for his work. His popularity survived the disappearance of the USSR and Musa Dzhalil is still a popular figure in Russia today. This popularity is the result of a complex combination of factors : he is celebrated as a great patriot (for his military exploit in Germany but also as a representative of the Tatar culture (he wrote his work in Tatar, as an artist (his poems were translated into Russian and, last but not least, as a representative of the Soviet society (of the Stalinist period. Because of the mixing of these different components, the cult of Musa Dzhalil can be appropriated simultaneously by different groups in Post-Soviet society (Russian leadership, Tatar authorities, Communist Party, Cultural institutions. This complex combination of supports forbids any critical assessment of Dzhalilâs memory. Critics against him are immediately denounced as anti-Tatar, anti-Soviet, anti-cultural and anti-Russian. This paper thus shows, through the example of Musa Dzhalil, the insertion of Great Patriotic War memory in a complex collection of social and political bonds.\n\nClimate Crisis and Communication: Reflections on Naomi Kleinâs This Changes Everything\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRobert A.

Communication scholars could help fill that gap. Conversely however, Kleinâs work suggests productive avenues for media researchers to explore, including a fresh take on the relationship between climate crisis, communication and capitalism as a system, and the potential for alternative media to challenge dominant cultural narratives.\n\nWORD BORROWING AND VOCABULARY EXCHANGE IN TURKISH DIALECTS: CASE OF OSMANIYE TATAR DIALECT / TÃRK LEHÃELERI ARASINDA SÃZCÃK ALIS VERISI VE SÃZ VARLIÄI DEÄISIMI: OSMANIYE TATAR AÄZI ÃRNEÄI\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDr. Ercan ALKAYA\n\n2008-08-01\n\nFull Text Available The basic vocabulary which constructs the main vocabulary of alanguage is the word that is transferred from generation to generation in everylanguage, has importance of first degree and reflects important concepts aboutmankind and his environment.

The poloidal field strength is determined from the analysis of circular polarization of a HeII 4686A spectral lines emitted from a plasma. The polarization modulation rate, which is proportional to the magnetic field strength along a line of sight, is estimated as a ratio of the difference between the left-hand circular polarized line intensity and right-hand one to the sum of them. A newly developed fast scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer allows us to improve a time resolution up to 1.5 ms. The poloidal magnetic field profile in He-doped deuterium plasmas of JIPP T-IIU has been successfully obtained with this polarimeter system.

It demonstrates that this mediaâs discourse was a sensitive milieu that reflected the unequal power relations between Crimeaâs ethnic groups â the Crimean Tatar minority and the Slavic majority â and informed the way individuals constructed their identities and social roles within Crimean society.

Naumenko\n\n2016-09-01\n\nFull Text Available One of the main tasks of the Russian state and the European countries is a formation of the uniform multinational people which are capable to resist to internal and external threats. Multiculturalism solves this problem, but migratory crisis in Europe has forced politicians to recognize impossibility of his realization in conditions when Christian and Arab-Muslim cultures are forced to coexist nearby. The article considers opposite experience â combination of orthodox and Islamic components in culture of the Siberian Christian Tatars in XVIII â the beginning of the 20th centuries is considered. Interpenetration of cultures has happened without loss of national identity of the Siberian Tatars; their culture has gained new unique lines. Authors consider that this combination has created a certain ethnic and national psychology of the Siberian baptized Tatars which allows them to coexist harmoniously with other people â Christian and Muslim. In article is considered multiculturalism of the Siberian Tatars in life, legal customs and religious art. Authors analyze the reasons of this phenomenon and emphasize that his major prerequisite â readiness of the Siberian people for interaction. It was based on uniform system of moral values, was formed throughout long evolution of ethnic and confessional development under the influence of a state policy. Authors come to the conclusion that the idea of multiculturalism is real and feasible in a combination \"Christianity/Islam\", but other conditions, than those developed in Western Europe now.\n\nBook Review: The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism written by Naomi Klein\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nLooney, Robert\n\n2007-01-01\n\nBook review by Dr. Robert Looney of the book The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism written by Naomi Klein.

Iskhakov\n\n2014-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The author of this article seeks to identify the historical origins of particular patronal place characteristic for the ulus of Jochi and later Turko-Tatar States established on its territory in the 15thâ16th centuries. This patronal place was known as the âgolden throneâ and has been recorded by the Turko-Tatar (epics, chronicles, historical works and some Russian sources. An overview of historical sources reveals that according to the Turko-Tatar traditions of the 16thâ18th centuries, the âgolden throneâ was a place, where the ruler (Khan, king was sitting in the Golden Horde and at the post-Horde political space. The author of this article emphasizes the important fact: in historical sources the âgolden throneâ was always associated with the place of enthronement of the Tatar ruler. As a result of detailed analysis of the available historical material, the author found that the often mentioned âgolden throneâ existed not only in the ulus of Jochi, but throughout the Mongol Empire. Moreover, further analysis of the available historical material (including a comparison with information contained in the parallel Persian, Chinese, and Latin sources showed that the âgolden throneâ was connected to another symbol of power, common in all Chinggisid States and recorded by a number of historical sources, that is, with special tent (yurt known as the âGreat Golden hordeâ. This tent together with the throne seat symbolized the focus of the khan authority in the Mongol Empire and the subsequent Chinggisid States.\n\n[Glutamate receptors genes polymorphism and the risk of paranoid schizophrenia in Russians and tatars from the Republic of Bashkortostan].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGareeva, A E; Khusnutdinova, E K\n\n2014-01-01\n\nSchizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects about 1% of the world population, leading to disability and social exclusion. Glutamatergic neurotransmission is a violation of one of the main hypotheses put forward to explain the neurobiological mechanisms of schizophrenia. Post mortem studies have found changes in the degree of affinity glutamate receptors, their transcription, and altered expression of their subunits in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus in patients with schizophrenia. As a result of genetic studies of gene family encoding ionotropic AMPA and kainate glutamate receptors in schizophrenia, ambiguous results were received. The association of polymorphic variants of genes GRIA2 and GRIK2 with paranoid schizophrenia and response to therapy with haloperidol in Russian and Tatar of the Republic of Bashkortostan was conducted in the present study. DNA samples of 257 patients with paranoid schizophrenia and of 349 healthy controls of Russian and Tatar ethnic group living in the Republic of Bashkortostan were involved into the present study. In the result of the present study: (1) high risk genetic markers of paranoid schizophrenia (PSZ) were obtained: in Russians-GR4IA2*CCC (OR = 9.60) and in Tatars-GRIK2*ATG (OR = 3.5), GRIK2*TGG (OR = 3.12) (2) The following low risk genetic markers of PSZ were revealed: in Tatars-GRIA2*T/T (rs43025506) of GRIA2 gene (OR = 0.34); in Russians.- GRIA2*CCT (OR = 0.481). (3) Genetic markers of low haloperido! treatment efficacy in respect of negative and positive symptoms GRIK2*T/T (rs2227281) of GRIK2 gene and GRAL42*C/C in Russians, GRIK2*A/A (rs995640) of GRIK2 gene in Tatars. (4) Genetic markers of low haloperidol treatment efficacy in respect of positive symptoms GRL42*C/C in Russians. The results of the present study support the hypothesis of the involvement of glutamate receptor genes in schizophrenia pathway.

The Conference was focused on several topics. On the first day, the Conference started with the issues of the Shibanâs ulus history and a role of the Shibanids in the history of the Golden Horde, including the issue of the borders of these lands, the ulus of Jochiâs place in its administrative structure, the participation of representatives of the dynasty in the events of the Great Zamyatnya (i.e, the Great Distemper and strives of the 1420âs. There were also discussed the ethnic and political processes in the Tyumen and Siberian Yurt. Considerable attention was paid to the Turkization of the Western Siberian population and formation of various groups of the Siberian Tatars. Researchers have noted the limitations of the source base of the late-medieval history of the region and the need for a comprehensive approach to the research involving experts in the fields of history, archaeology, ethnography, anthropology, linguistics. A separate debate was held on the role of the Nogai and Bukhara factor in the history of the Kuchum Siberian khanate. On the second day, there were discussed various aspects of the Turkic-Tatar peoplesâ occurrence from the Ural-Irtysh interfluve to the Russian State. There were presented reports both on the policy and destiny of the Kuchum descendants and legal and military aspects of the Tatar yurtesâ subordination. There was held a discussion about two versions of the Ichkinski Tatar ethnogenesis as a special group of the Tatar population of the region. Thereupon, the conference participants called for a cautious stance on the use of ethnic reconstructions in Turkic history and their use in the construction of\n\nThe Mongol Empire and the Tatars in the Ragusan Chronicle of Giacomo Luccari Â»\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAleksandar Uzelac\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Nobleman Giacomo di Pietro Luccari, or Jakov LukareviÄ (1551â1615, was one of the several notable historians of the Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovnik who lived and worked at the turn of the sixteenth and the seventeenth century. In 1605 in Venice, he published his book Copioso ristretto degli Annali di Ragusa. Luccari attempted to provide an overview of the history of his home city, as well as the states and peoples that influenced the history of Ragusa. One of the most interesting excurses in his work is related to the Mongol Ðmpire, chiefly based on the works of Marco Polo and Hayton of Corycus, but also other less known source materials. Luccari also wrote short sketches about the Golden Horde and the Tatar presence in the Lower Danube region. In general, his book is unreliable source, full of factual mistakes, but it deserves attention of the researchers due to one particular reason. Namely, Luccari was the first South Slavic historian who dealt with the Tatars and their important place in the world history. Despite the considerable degree of popularity it enjoyed at the time of its appearance, Copioso ristretto is neither critically published, nor translated in any modern language so far. Therefore, in this paper, annotated Russian translation of the passages from the work of Luccari with respect to the Mongol Empire and the Tatars of the Golden Horde is presented to the wider circle of scholarly audience, accompanied by a short introductory study about the Ragusan historian and his work.\n\nTHE STYLE OF GREEK AND ITALIAN VOCABULARYâS ENTRANCE INTO CRIMEAN TATAR LANGUAGE / ÃNAN VE Ä°TALYAN LEKSÄ°KASINIÃ QIRIMTATAR TÄ°LÄ°NE KELÄ°P KÄ°RMESÄ°NÄ°Ã YOLLARI VE USULLARI\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nProf. Dr. Ahtem MAZÄ°NOV\n\n2007-05-01\n\nFull Text Available A plenty of Greek and Italian words entered into Crimean Tatar language via different ways after some processes, proceeding by the Crimean Tatars and their language.

Yu.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe eddy-resolved ocean circulation model RIAMOM (Lee et al., 2003) is used to analyze seasonal variability of mesoscale circulation in the Tatar Strait of the Japan Sea. The model domain is a vast area including the northern Japan Sea, Okhotsk Sea and adjacent region in the Pacific Ocean. A numerical experiment with a horizontal 1/18Â° resolution has been carried out under realistic meteorological conditions from the ECMWF ERA-40 reanalysis with restoring of surface temperature and salinity. The simulated seasonal variability of both the current system and mesoscale eddy dynamics in the Tatar Strait is in a good agreement with temperature and salinity distributions of oceanographic observation data collected during various seasons and years. Two general circulation regimes in the Strait have been found. The circulation regime changes from summer to winter due to seasonal change of the North Asian Monsoon. On a synoptic time scale, the similar change of the circulation regime occurs due to change of the southeastern wind to the northwestern one when the meteorological situation with an anticyclone over the Okhotsk Sea changes to that with a strong cyclone. The Lagrangian maps illustrate seasonal changes in direction of the main currents and in polarity and location of mesoscale eddies in the Strait.\n\nThe Role of the Turkic-Tatar Constituent People in the Formation of the State-Forming âPeopleâ of the Jochid Ulus in the 13thâ14th centuries\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nD.M.

Research materials: A complex of written historical sources, materials of historical, ethnological, linguistic and archaeological research. Results and novelty of the research: These processes are treated in extremely simplified forms, the essence of which is reduced to the âassimilationâ of the Mongols with numerically predominant Polovtsians (Kypchaks. In addition to these shortcomings, domestic research suffers from other shortcomings under the influence of historians from Tatarstan who seek to eliminate the tradition of negative labeling of the ruling âpeopleâ of the Golden Horde, which was called the âTatar-Mongolsâ in the old literature. In reality, one must well conceive the ethnic components of the given âpeopleâ for a reliable description of ethnic processes that took place in the 13thâ14th centuries within the framework of the Golden Horde society, which ended with the formation of ethnic medieval Tatars. Meanwhile, this issue has not yet been fully developed. The role of the eastern Kypchaks-Kimaks in the formation of medieval Tatars is particularly poorly understood: their elite had a Tatar identity. In addition, we should pay attention to the participation of the Altai Turks in the ethnopolitical processes in the Jochid ulus, as well as of the Uighurs from the former Kimak Kaghanate closely associated with the Tatars. The study of these aspects of the extensive problem of the formation of a new âpeopleâ of medieval (Golden Horde Tatars makes it possible to construct a different model of ethnic processes in the Jochid ulus, different from the previous one.\n\nNew Book: Roman Hautala.

In his book Hautala presented major part of Latin sources containing early European information about the Tatar-Mongols and written in the period preceding the invasion of Hungary by nomadic army headed by Batu. Thus, the monograph contains historical documents and fragments of Latin chronicles, which were compiled before 1241. This anthology is aimed at presenting evolution of the European perception of the Tatar-Mongols gradually changing due to accumulation of fragmented information obtained from the East. The monographâs main section entitled âSourcesâ contains 91 fragments from Latin sources with information on the growing territorial expansion of the Mongol Empire. Each of these fragments contains, in turn, information about the author and circumstances of their compilation, original text with all significant discrepancies, and Russian translation with detailed comments. The âSourcesâ section is preceded by an introductory part containing a detailed analysis of the sources in the context of contemporary historical research. At the end of the monograph the author has placed Latin and Russian index of names and places, which facilitates the search for materials on a particular historical, geographical, or prosopographical topics. The author classifies the presented information on the Tatar-Mongols according to two main geographical regions of its origin and subsequent arrival to Europe.

The experts had to explain to the Western European elites how they should perceive the two Western uluses of the formerly united Mongol Empire of the Chinggisids. The relations with the Golden Horde and the Ilkhans of Iran appeared to be of crucial importance for the liberation and preservation of the Holy Land. Thus, two images of the Tatars took shape gradually: that of potential enemies in the case of the Golden Horde, and the possible allies in the case of the Ilkhans. This text is dedicated to several treatises of these propagandists, unified under the title and the slogan De Recuperatione Terrae Sanctae. The main focus is on the treatises of Hayton of Corycus (âFlower of the Histories of the Orientâ and of Marino Sanudo Torsello (âThe Secrets of the Faithful to the Crossâ, where we could find extremely interesting information on the Western European image of the Tatars. Several other excerpts are included in the text, namely passages from the treatises of William Adam (âHow to exterminate the Saracensâ, Pseudo-Brocardus (âA Guideline of Organization of a Crusadeâ and the founder of this genre â Fidenzio di Padova (âA Book for the Recovery of the Holy Landâ, where the political and military tendencies are defined very clear. The evolution of the image of the Tatar-Mongols developed from âchildren of the Tartarâ to âbonnes sauvagesâ and âglobal rulersâ, that are able to handle even the holy cause of the liberation of the Promised Land of the Christian people.\n\nMis saab eesti gÃ¼mnaasiumist? / Igor GarÅ¡nek, Linnar PriimÃ¤gi, Tiiu Purdelo ; vestluse pani kirja Raivo Juurak\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nGarÅ¡nek, Igor, 1958-\n\n2008-01-01\n\nRiigikirjandi drillimise asemel on vaja hakata gÃ¼mnaasiumis sÃ¼vendatult Ãµppima valikaineid, leiavad TLÃ ÃµppejÃµud Linnar PriimÃ¤gi, Eesti Kunstiakadeemia ÃµppejÃµud Igor GarÅ¡nek ja SA ÃiguskolledÅ¾i asutaja Tiiu Purdelo\n\nFast cooling phenomena with ice pellet injection in the JIPP T-IIU Tokamak\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSakamoto, M.; Sato, K.N.; Ogawa, Y.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nIce pellet injection experiments were carried out in the JIPP T-IIU Tokamak in order to study thermal (cooling) transport just after injection. The cut-off problem of ECE signals due to the rise in density has been resolved by careful measurements of the temperature profile at a high time resolution (Ît = 2Î¼s) during its decay phase. The phenomenon of ultra-fast cooling (so-called pre-cooling) has been identified using the two different methods of ECE and soft X-ray (SXR) measurements. In the outer region (r > r q=1 ) of the plasma the cooling propagation velocity is comparable to or slightly greater than the pellet velocity, while in the central region (r q=1 ) the propagation velocity is significantly greater than the pellet velocity. Ice pellets were injected into various kinds of JIPP T-IIU plasmas, the current and sawtooth phase of which had different values, including a no-sawtooth plasma. The existence of the q = 1 surface and arrival of a pellet near the q = 1 surface have turned out to be necessary conditions for pre-cooling, and even just after the sawtooth crash the pre-cooling starts around the q = 1 surface, not at the plasma center. Simultaneous measurements of electron temperature and density profiles indicate that the central temperature always decreases before the central density increases. Some anomalous transport might be induced by pellet injection at the central region.

An Experience of the Source Study and Conceptual Analysis Â»\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nD.M. Iskhakov\n\n2016-07-01\n\nFull Text Available In recent years, researchers have begun to pay greater attention to the ethnic aspects of the Great Mongolian Stateâs formation at the turn of the 12thâ13th centuries. However, a key problem of this period still remains controversial. This problem is related to the definition of ethnicity of the Tatar and other kindred clans. This article analyzes the problem in order to achieve a clear understanding of the ethnic situation in Central Asia during the formation of Eke Mongol Ulus. As a result of consideration of historiographical approaches to ethnic nomenclature, which the Mongolian and Chinese sources used with respect to the Turkic and Mongolian groups that settled in this area, the author is inclined to the view of Turkish ethnicity of the Tatars and some other (Naimans, Merkits clans known by source, whom Chinggis Khan faced in the process of formation of the âpeople of the Mongolsâ. At the same time, the author establishes a historical connection between the pre-Mongol Tartars and Kimak and Uyghur khaganates. In particular, he reveals their affiliation to the elite, âroyalâ layers of these Turkic states. In turn, this allows us to reveal the presence of a Tatar component among the eastern Kipchak-Kimaks (Yemeks with close ties with the last dynasty of Khwarezm shahs. On the basis of a detailed and comprehensive review of material, the author points to the need for a new understanding of the term âMongol-Tatarsâ. This term was not imposed by the Chinese officials, but it was a meaningful politonym marking a two-part (Turkic (Tatar â Mongol nature of the âpeopleâ who established the Great Mongol Empire. The author informs in his article about his plans to consider in detail this issue in relation to the ulus of Jochi.\n\nNew features of L-H transition in limiter H-modes of JIPP T-IIU\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nToi, K.; Morita, S.; Kawahata, K.\n\n1992-09-01\n\nIn limiter H-modes of JIPP T-IIU, a new type of L-H transition preceded by an ELM is observed. The preceding ELM (pre-ELM) appears just prior to the L-H transition. This type of transition is usually observed in H-modes of JIPP T-IIU. The L-H transition without the pre-ELM is triggered only in the case when a sufficiently large rapid current ramp down is emploied. In H-modes with constant q(a)â¼3.5-4.5, coherent magnetic oscillations with m=3/n=1 destabilized during L-phase are further enhanced at the pre-ELM, and suppressed suddenly at the transition. This mode is situated in the region of the transport barrier. Propagation frequency of the m=3/n=1 mode, which may be affected by plasma mass rotation, rises appreciably (by â¼ 10 %) during H-phase with frequent ELMs, but remains unchanged for at least 200 Î¼s after the transition. Behaviours of the m=3/n=1 and m=2/n=1 modes are well explained by quasi-linear resistive tearing mode analysis for modelled toroidal current density profiles slightly detached from the limiter. These experimental results suggest that the transition is controlled by the change of a magnetic field structure relating to the modification of a toroidal current density profile near the edge. The possibility for the development of edge radial electric field as a consequence of the transition is discussed.

A new technique for an ice pellet injection system with controllability of injection angle has been developed and installed to the JIPP T-IIU tokamak in order to vary deposition profile of ice pellets within a plasma. Injection angle can be varied easily and successfully during an interval of two plasma shots in the course of an experiment, so that one can carry out various basic experiments by varying the pellet deposition profile. The injection angle has been varied poloidally from -6 to 6 degree by changing the angle of the last stage drift tube. This situation makes possible for pellets to aim at from about r = -2a/3 to r = 2a/3 of the plasma. From two dimensional observations by CCD cameras, details of the pellet ablation structures with various injection angles have been studied, and a couple of interesting phenomena have been found. In the case of an injection angle (Î¸) larger than a certain value (Î¸ â¥ 4 o ), a pellet penetrates straightly through the plasma with a trace of straight ablation cloud, which has been expected from usual theoretical consideration. On the other hand, a long helical tail of ablation light has been observed in the case of the angle smaller than the certain value (Î¸ â¤ 4 o ).

Research materials: the era of Turkic khanate domination in the steppes of Asia and Eastern Europe marked the formation of the ancient Turkic literary tradition. Initially it was displayed in the original Orkhon-Yenisey alphabet. Later, in the principality Kocho and Karakhanidsâ state this tradition was transliterated into alphabet borrowed from the Sogdians. In his work compiled in Arabic, Karakhanid Mahmoud al-Kashgari was first to describe Turkic-speaking dialects that differed from the ancient writing standards. Among them, he focused mainly on the languages of nomadic Oguz and Kipchak confederations. One after another they occupied the steppes of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Based on al-Kashgariâs information, the author of this article demonstrates that the territory occupied by the Kipchak confederation preserved Oghuz dialect used by Oghuz tribes Kangly and KarabÑrkli who joined to Kipchaks. The Kyrgyz branch of the Turkic languages brought by Kipchaks to the West spread in this area as well. The rise and conquest of the Great Mongol Empire changed the language boundaries and literary canons of Central Asia, Siberia and Eastern Europe forever. In the time of the Mongol Empire practice of bilingualism established in the area. Literary canons from now and until the first third of the 20th century were based on the Turkic speech of Chagataid ulus of the Mongol Empire. On the other hand, examining the Antonio de Finaleâs manuscript composed at the beginning of the 14th century on the territory of the Jochid Ulus, and a number of documents of the 16thâ18th centuries written in the Lithuanian Tatar, the author reveals the formation history of Tatar branch of Turkic languages in the steppes of Dasht-i Kipchak. Results and novelty of the research: on the basis of this information the article manages to conclude that both\n\n\"The Song of the Plants\", from Rabbi Nachman from Breslav to Naomi Sherzer\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSarah Kaminski\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available In the Jewish tradition, the Tu Bishvat, or âFestivity of the Treesâ, at the end of January is the occasion to challenge the harshness of winter, celebrate natureâs vitality and fruitfulness, and to admire the articulate relationship between man and environment. All those aspects, related to the mythical and spiritual concept of the sacredness of the Land of Israel, are rooted in an antique tradition expressed in Deuteronomy: 20, 19 âWhen thou shalt besiege a city [â¦], thou shalt not destroy the treesâ. A similar concept is announced hundreds years later in a mysterious text, called Perek Shira, imbedded as part of the Tu Bishvat synagogue recitation. At the beginning of the 19th century, the famous Hassidic Rebbe, Nachman from Breslav, meditated intensely about the insolvable bonds existing between human being and the plantâs world. In his book Likkutei Moharan he persuades his disciples: âYou should know that every plant and plant/ has its own and specific melodyâ. In the seventies, this Nigun becomes a very popular and beloved song by the talented Israeli chansonniÃ¨re Naomi Shemer, born in kibbutz Degania, near the Lake of Galilee. The song is sung in public, at the Shabbat table, in religious and secular occasions, embracing biblical memory, spiritual history and a new musical approach.\n\nDuchowa kultura TatarÃ³w polskich jako integralny element kultury pogranicza sÅowiaÅsko-muzuÅmaÅskiego\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSelim Chazbijewicz\n\n2015-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The spiritual culture of Polish Tatars as an integral element of the SlavicâMuslim borderlands culture The present article depicts the unique culture of Polish Tatars in the context of their history and the histories of other Muslim cultures in Europe, especially in Bosnia. In particular, this article presents the history of this small ethnic group as well as the specificity of their religious practices in relation to the Ottoman tradition and the culture of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Further, the article discusses the tradition of Sufism (the Bektashi and Jesewije orders, as well as its relations with shamanism and its remains. What is more, the article portrays Tatar writings in comparison with the Muslim written culture in East Europe and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Subsequently, the article analyses Tatar rites: their forms and changes they have undergone. These forms reflect the uniqueness of the Tatar culture in the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania and in the present-day Poland. The existing forms are combinations of Tatar, Muslim and Slavic spirituality and provide evidence that the Polish Tatar culture is strongly related to Slavic and Muslim cultures, especially the Ottoman culture and the culture of the former Crimean Khanate.
