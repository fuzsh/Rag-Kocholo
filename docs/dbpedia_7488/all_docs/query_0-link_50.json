        "text": "SLINT began in Louisville, KY in 1986 with drummer Britt Walford, guitarist David Pajo, guitarist/vocalist Brian McMahan, and original bassist Ethan Buckler. In 1987, SLINT recorded their first album, Tweez, in Chicago with Steve Albini (Pixies, PJ Harvey, Nirvana), which was released on the minuscule Jennifer Hartman Records and Tapes label in 1989, and later reissued by Touch and Go Records in 1993. With new bassist Todd Brashear, SLINT recorded their second album, Spiderland, over four days in August of 1990 and the world would never again sound the same. Produced by Brian Paulson and released by Touch and Go Records in 1991, the six songs on Spiderland methodically map a shadowy new continent of sound. The music is taut, menacing, and haunting – its structure built largely on absence and restraint, on the echoing space between the notes, but punctuated by sudden thrilling blasts of unfettered fury. Spiderland spawned a whole new genre, frequently called Post-Rock, and came to be regarded as one of the most important and influential records of the past thirty years. In 2010, Spiderland was enthroned in the popular and acclaimed 33 1/3 series of books about seminal record albums. SLINT broke up shortly before Spiderland was released, but have since reunited for several high-profile performances, including All Tomorrow’s Parties and Pitchfork Music Festival."
