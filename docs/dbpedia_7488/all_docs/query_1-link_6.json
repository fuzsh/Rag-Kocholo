        "text": "In March 1991, Melody Maker printed an album review written by Steve Albini – at the time best known as the former frontman of Chicago noise trio Big Black, though gaining recognition for his work recording other bands. He was writing about the second album by a little known band from Louisville, Kentucky, whose first record he had recorded. He was unequivocal about Spiderland, by Slint. \"It's an amazing record,\" he wrote, \"and no one still capable of being moved by rock music should miss it. In 10 years' time, it will be a landmark and you'll have to scramble to buy a copy then. Beat the rush.\"\n\nToday, Slint's guitarist, David Pajo, remembers hearing the same thing firsthand, in Albini's house. \"He said: 'I don't think you guys will ever get big, but you'll be really influential. I was thinking: 'You're fucking crazy.'\"\n\nIn fact, although it sold fewer than 5,000 copies at the time, Spiderland did become a landmark, one that invented an entire genre – post-rock. Generations have grown up in awe of its shifting landscapes, sinister narratives and intangible, dark power, and Slint have become modern rock's Velvet Underground: a band who created a ripple that kept spreading, influencing bands from Mogwai to Sigur Rós.\n\n\"They cultivated this sort of psychic playing,\" says Mogwai's Stuart Braithwaite. \"It's way above other bands and is really emotional. When I heard Spiderland, it was unlike anything I'd heard before. I still don't know if I've heard anything else like it, now.\"\n\nThe fact that Slint had split up before the album was released and given few interviews and played few gigs beyond Louisville imbued them with a powerful mystique. All listeners had was the music, and a few rumours: that the strain of making the album pushed the band to breaking point, and that some members ended up in psychiatric hospitals.\n\nNow, included in a deluxe box set reissue, Lance Bangs's documentary about Spiderland, Breadcrumb Trail, shines some light on the myths, surprisingly revealing the young Slint as prank-playing teens who named their band after drummer Britt Walford's catfish, let off stink bombs and made jokes about genitalia. By the documentary's end, though, the mystique is actually enhanced: you're left wondering how four goofy kids made such a strange, powerful record.\n\n\"It worries me, sometimes,\" says bassist Todd Brashear, a down-to-earth but thoughtful Kentuckian. \"On the surface we were jovial, smartass kids. Sometimes my friends say: 'Oh, our kids have started listening to Spiderland.' And part of me is thinking: 'Are you sure they should be listening to it?'\"\n\nAlthough they were teenagers, Slint were musical veterans by the time they recorded Spiderland. Walford and singer-guitarist Brian McMahan formed their first hardcore punk band, Languid and Flaccid, when they were just 11 and so small that their fathers had to carry their equipment. Their next band, Squirrel Bait, are still highly regarded, not least by Dave Grohl.\n\nIf loud music provided one means of letting off teenage steam beneath otherwise quiet exteriors, so did mischief. Pajo – who first played with the pair in yet another hardcore band, Maurice – remembers a typical incident when McMahan laced brownies with laxatives and took them into school. \"Everyone who had them was on the toilet all night.\"\n\nPajo remembers the young Walford as \"an amazing drummer. He was so young and skinny, and played so hard. I'd been in bands since I was 14 but I'd never seen anyone play drums like that. Every moment of his life he was winding people up, but you couldn't tell, meeting him, because he was soft spoken and gentle. This dark side would come out, but in ways that couldn't make you mad at him.\"\n\nWhen Walford and Pajo regrouped as Slint – initially featuring a different bassist, Ethan Buckler, who is on their first album, Tweez – they played their first gig in, of all places, a Unitarian church. \"That was really funny,\" Pajo says. \"My amp was taller than I was. I had to reach up just to adjust the volume. Our songs were mostly screaming feedback. It was pretty funny looking up and seeing old ladies walking out.\" McMahan, in the audience, was so impressed he joined the band.\n\nWhen the young musicians recorded Tweez with Albini, in 1987, the producer was greeted at his front door by a band member in boxer shorts wielding a shotgun. But they were jokey sessions – Albini says it contains a recording of Walford on the toilet, and a typical studio request would be Walford's demand that Albini \"make the bass drum sound like a ham being slapped by a [baseball] catcher's mitt\".\n\n\"Britt would say: 'It needs to sound wetter. The ham needs some more juice on it,'\" says McMahan. \"'Can you make it more watery? Can you make the sound more green?'\"\n\nDespite Albini's repeated warnings about having drinks in the control room, McMahan remembers the small, bespectacled Walford making a cup of tea and tipping it right into the mixing desk. \"Which sent Steve leaping in the air, exclaiming: 'Fuck me!' and pulling the power supply out of the board. One day of our studio time was spent trying to dry the channels off and thinking: 'Oh my God, how will we pay for this?'\"\n\nHowever, in the three-year gap between recording their two albums, everything would change. The first obvious developments were musical. Much of what became known as post-rock arose out of the musical collision between guitarists McMahan – who was striving to play better – and Pajo, a \"technically flashy\" player who deliberately deconstructed his style, wanting \"to get worse\".\n\n\"We were evolving all the time,\" Pajo says of rehearsals, which took place in Walford's mother's basement and often involved repeating single riffs for hours at a time. \"We wanted that confrontational aspect that hardcore had, but not be in your face with it. We were trying to make an atmosphere that felt uncomfortable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, McMahan, for one, had started nursing huge musical ambitions. \"We had grandiose notions about the artists we were fixated on. At that age, we thought we could make a record that would have the staying power of AC/DC's High Voltage, Neil Young's On the Beach or Philip Glass's Mishima soundtrack. We were naive enough to think we could do something earth-shattering.\"\n\nAround this time, Walford noticed McMahan was becoming more pessimistic and fatalistic. Bangs's documentary unearths something else significant. In the runup to Spiderland, McMahan was helping a motorist on the freeway when he was struck by a passing vehicle, taking what he now describes as a \"pretty good knock to the head\". He says his survival was \"pretty miraculous\". However, in keeping with their tendency to bottle up emotions, at the time it was barely mentioned.\n\n\"I just sorta sat on it,\" he says, as a two-and-a-half hour telephone conversation becomes slightly darker. \"But I remember becoming depressed a few months afterwards, as my mortality hit home.\" Indeed, the brush with death had such an effect on him that, a year later, when he was held up at gunpoint, he barely flinched. Such deep, repressed emotions would explode within the music.\n\nBefore Spiderland, there was another change. Although sessions with Albini had always been fruitful, Slint switched producers, using Brian Paulson, known for his \"live\" sound.\n\n\"Steve made abrasive, socially provocative music,\" explains McMahan. \"He was about defying norms. He wouldn't have cared if the Queen walked in the studio. He'd be like: 'What the fuck are you doing here?' He was one of those deadpan guys. But we weren't sure if our ideas would be best with the extreme production style that Steve was developing. We didn't want the bells and whistles. We just wanted the music as we wrote it and as we heard it. That's what Brian gave us.\"\n\nWith Paulson at the controls, Brashear remembers the Spiderland recording session as \"real fast, but stressful\". Where Tweez was released by Louisville indie Jennifer Hartman, signing to the influential Chicago label Touch and Go put the pressure on. The bassist describes tomfoolery in the control room, but an \"intense, intimidating\" atmosphere when tapes rolled.\n\nThe softly spoken vocal style that distinguished Spiderland was down to McMahan's lack of confidence as a singer, but both he and Walford wrote the lyrics, mostly about coming of age and the fear of oncoming adulthood. Typically, the taciturn frontman kept his words to himself until the very last moment. \"I did not want to rehearse the vocals,\" he explains. \"It was a one-shot, cathartic experience.\"\n\nAccording to Pajo, when a band acquaintance found the handwritten lyrics to Washer – \"Goodnight my love, remember me as you fall to sleep\" – she mistook them for a suicide note. Similar dark sparks flew in Good Morning Captain, McMahan's chilling screams of \"I'm sorry! I miss you!\" being almost the last thing they recorded.\n\nFor Pajo, McMahan's anguish is pivotal to Spiderland.\n\n\"Even after all this time, those screams gives me the chills,\" he says. \"If Brian hadn't made himself vulnerable on that record we wouldn't be talking about it now. It would have just been an interesting album of instrumentals, but he wore his heart on his sleeve.\"\n\nMcMahan remembers sweating and feeling so nervous he felt like he was having \"an out-of-body experience\". Pajo recalls the singer delivering his performance in pitch darkness apart from a tiny light over the lyric sheet, chugging something to settle his stomach. \"As soon as he'd finished screaming he ran into the bathroom. Then he came back and said: 'I got sick.'\"\n\n\"I don't think even the guys in the band knew this,\" McMahan says, \"but becoming an adult, going through school, trying to satisfy my parents' expectations, my community's expectations … it was tough. Coming of age in Louisville was not easy. For all the liberties we enjoyed as kids, there's not a creative class. I was just trying to figure out: 'How am I going to do this?' My father's father was a musician. Great guy, but didn't seem to have two pennies together. Once I started leaving to do tours my parents were not at all happy. My dad in particular was like: 'This is a huge mistake.' I have a brother, five years younger. I'm not saying Good Morning Captain's about him, but those lines, 'I'm sorry. I miss you', are informed by leaving Louisville and him behind. I was thinking about my brother having to go through the same experiences as me, when everything was just becoming too much. I don't even remember being sick. That whole part is just a blur.\"\n\nThe morning after recording finished, he checked himself into a hospital and was diagnosed with depression. Then he quit the band, a life-changing decision he puts down to the bewilderment of an \"anxiety-ridden mind\".\n\nIt still troubles Walford that he didn't see his friend's breakdown coming. \"But I don't know if I could have understood it, back then. I've since heard on practice tapes him having misgivings that I never had. I'm so sorry that he had all that insecurity and tension and I never picked up on it.\"\n\nTouch and Go boss Corey Rusk – who \"really believed in the record and wanted everyone to hear it\" – was devastated by the split. However, Slint's abrupt ending gives their work purity: they were frozen at their zenith, before experiencing the compromises that accompany success.\n\n\"With hindsight, breaking up was one of the best things we did,\" says Pajo, who has since played with countless bands from Will Oldham's Palace Brothers (Oldham, a Kentucky friend of the band, took Spiderland's famous cover photo of the band up to their necks in water) to Stereolab to Interpol, and recorded solo under his own name and as Aerial M and Papa M.\n\n\"A lot of bands don't break up soon enough, I think. I'm glad it happened. When the record started catching on, I realised that marketing and publicity and all that stuff is important, but it's secondary to the music. And Spiderland proved that. We were a band that broke up leaving an album in a black-and-white record sleeve. No tours, no information. Six songs, but they connected with people.\"\n\nFor Pajo, the album captures teenage trauma, the years when everything is dramatic. \"Your girlfriend makes out with your best mate and it's 'Oh my God!' We could never make a record like that again.\"\n\nAlthough a 1992 attempt to play together again fizzled out, Slint (minus Brashear, who runs a video store in Louisville) fleetingly toured Spiderland in 2005, with occasional shows since. McMahan formed the For Carnation in 1997, but neither he nor Brashear are currently playing music. Recently, Walford told a magazine that the idea of any new Slint music was \"unviable\", but today – despite launching a new band, Watter – says the notion would be \"really cool\".\n\nMeanwhile, Spiderland's influence has become an accepted fact of rock history. \"There are bands who have done a Soviet reverse on Slint music and copied it,\" Albini says, \"but to originate music like that is a rare thing. As an album, I think it's flawless.\""
