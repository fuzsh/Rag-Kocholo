Per Ethan Buckler (Slint bassist on tweez), “Finally - after thirty-five long years - the other guys in Slint decided to be nice to me and let me have my Tweez remix. I complained incessantly back in the day about how the Albini production style ruined our first recording.” In 2023, Ethan took the original multi-track recordings to a local studio in Louisville. Upon handing the engineer a copy of a pre-tweez Slint practice tape, he said “Make it sound like this.” LP2 of this tweez (35th anniversary edition) is the result.
