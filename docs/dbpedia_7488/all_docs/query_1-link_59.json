While the intimate venue holds less than 200 people, ARTxFM has a special access pass that will allow this performance to be heard around the entire world.\n\nThe evening begins with an opening performance from Wishgift at 8 PM Eastern Daylight Time (U.S.). The stream is accessible through our website www.artxfm.com and free \"ARTxFM\" mobil apps. Fans are advised to stream in early as there is limited number of listner slots.\n\nThe line-up includes original members of SLINT - Britt Walford, Brian McMahan, and David Pajo - joined by musicians Christian Tonegawa and Matt Jencik. The performance is certain to be outstanding. No matter where you are in the world on Tuesday, April 15, you are invited to join ARTxFM direct from Nelligan Hall as Louisville bids SLINT a heroes' welcome home.\n\nFor Further Reading:\n\nSLINT - official website\n\nSLINT - Cover Story - LEO WEEKLY\n\nSlint's Spiderland Gets Deluxe Box Set Reissue - Pitchfork"
