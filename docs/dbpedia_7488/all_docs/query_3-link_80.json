        "text": "In January, 2005, the Chicago record label Drag City released a somewhat mysterious record called Superwolf, by Matt Sweeney and Bonnie “Prince” Billy. Sweeney, at the time, was known mostly for having played in Chavez, a beloved New York guitar band in the ‘90s, and for having been part of Zwan, the cursed supergroup Billy Corgan formed after the demise of the Smashing Pumpkins. Bonnie “Prince” Billy was (and is) one of several recording aliases used by Will Oldham, the actor, musician, photographer, and cult figure. Superwolf was unlike anything either man had released before: not in its mystery—Oldham had been releasing music in strange and unorthodox packages since the early ’90s—but in its particular marriage of tenderness and scale. The songs, mostly just Oldham’s voice and Sweeney’s guitar, were intimate, even carnal, about sex and devotion; many of them also contained intricate guitar solos and dramatic, sweeping dynamic changes. It was the kind of record—opaque, and yet close-feeling—that encouraged obsession. And over the years since, many people became obsessed with it. The producer Rick Rubin recently told me in an email about his first encounter with the record: “I felt like I was witness to a special moment in time.”\n\nOldham grew up in Louisville, Kentucky. One of the early, formative experiences of his life was a high school friendship with a band called Slint, who in 1991 released an unloved record called Spiderland (Oldham shot the cover, a black and white photo of the band’s four members swimming in a quarry). “They broke up before it came out,” Oldham told me last week. “And there was nothing. But then gradually that record found its audience”—to the point that in 2005, the band reunited to play the record again to the thousands of fans they’d made since releasing the record into the void. “And I've always just thought that's really the best way,” Oldham said.\n\nUntil this week, Superwolf wasn’t available on any streaming service. This was by design. Oldham comes from a do-it-yourself background, and prefers to deal with people he knows, in arrangements he can control. Spotify, for a while, was neither. “It's a medium that I don't think is the best, and I’m not sure it's healthy for either people or for music, and it seems to devalue music,” Oldham told me. “Especially for the first number of years, it was intensely devaluing because there was no money coming to the creators of the music or the people who own the masters or whatever.” But he also came to realize that his own personal habits around listening to recorded music—in the old way, on CDs and tapes and LPs—were increasingly uncommon. “I gradually started to realize that not everybody can spend the amount of time that I do keeping my musical life healthy. The maintenance of the systems and the collections and all that is not something that people have the time to worry about.”\n\nRecently, Oldham and Drag City finally found an arrangement with Spotify that they felt they could accept. “People are starting to tell me there's money. People are starting to get paid. And that was one of my reservations. I thought, ‘Well we're not even going to get paid. Why would we want to participate in this terrible thing?’ And then, now that there’s money in it, we probably need to either like think of a brand new model for what we're doing and how we're doing it—in terms of, like, should we just make 100 copies of a record and charge 100 dollars? Or 500 copies or 1000 copies and charge 50 dollars? Or just not make music anymore because, you know, it doesn't work, making records? Or should we figure out: can this work? And maybe it's time.” Over the past few months, Oldham and Drag City have quietly been posting a year’s worth of Oldham’s music each week on the service. This week, in the journey forward through time and the Oldham catalog, is 2005.\n\nOldham and Sweeney didn’t talk much about Superwolf when it came out. But for whatever reason, the two men—who have been friends and collaborators since the ‘90s, when a chance encounter on a New York City street brought them together—agreed to talk about the record on the occasion of its debut in the streaming world. Sweeney was in Miami when I called, in South Beach, trying to figure out where to have dinner. Oldham was in the house he and his wife use as an office and studio in Louisville, Kentucky, where he still lives. “My six-pound pocket wolf just jumped on a chair and is cuddled up to my left side,” Oldham said, narrating the circumstances of our call. “And the chair is covered with upholstery that my godmother designed in the 1970s.”\n\nSuperwolf was conceived as an experiment, a way of making songs that was different from either man’s usual method: Oldham wrote lyrics and then sent them to Sweeney, who wrote music. “I was sort of bummed out at the time,” Sweeney told me. “And maybe more so than usual doubting what the fuck I was doing with myself.” Sweeney had played on the 2001 Bonnie “Prince” Billy record Ease on Down the Road, and they’d toured together. But for a time, after that, he’d disappeared.\n\n“One of the big things that happened in the two or three years leading up to writing and then making the Superwolf record was that Matt's old acquaintance Billy Corgan invited him to be a part of this new project that he was doing, which ultimately was called Zwan,” Oldham said. “Early on— it was right after September 11— I got asked to play a benefit for this organization called RAWA, which was the Revolutionary Afghani Women's Association or something like that, in Los Angeles. And it was the beginning days of Zwan. I talked to Matt, and Zwan volunteered their services to be the band. So we go into a rehearsal hall and I'm in there with Matt and Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlain and we're working out all these songs that I wrote, and Billy Corgan is very generous and very sweet, and he comes up with some incredible guitar parts for songs. And it was a great experience.\n\n​So Matt's getting involved with this thing and I'm trying to be excited. But I have reservations because​ I've never fully embraced the musical world of Corgan. And I also know that it can be encompassing. And [Matt and I] just got this musical relationship going, and I'm aware that it's about to go on a serious hiatus. And I want to be positive, but again, I'm not thinking that they're necessarily going to be making music that I'm going to be wrapping my ears around with full glee. And indeed it has its peaks and valleys. But ultimately it's a rocky road that does not end in the success I think Corgan wanted. But essentially Matt was kind of M.I.A. in some ways for a couple of years, and I know it had some great rewards, but I think it was also very, very challenging and distressing in a lot of ways, and didn't necessarily end on a high note.” Superwolf was a way of reaching out, of offering a hand back up. “There was no better way​ when that was over to express to Matt how much I'd missed him than to say, like, 'Let's do this thing.'”\n\nOldham began mailing lyrics in the Oldham style: frank and surreal vignettes—“Astride my horny horn, you’ll be in glory born,” goes one couplet on an early song, “Beast for Thee”—about love and longing. “Will is really good at writing dirty songs, or songs that have a surprising sex line in them,” Sweeney told me. “Making art or making things is sort of like problem solving. Getting presented with some horny lyrics and then trying to give them gravitas is fun as shit.” The guitar parts Sweeney crafted on Superwolf are patient, bright, full of subtle melody and emotion. In the years after recording the album, Sweeney became a popular session musician—he played on Neil Diamond’s Home Before Dark, and Adele’s 21. When artists ask for an example of his work before a prospective session, he said, he sends them Superwolf.\n\nThey recorded the record in the winter of 2004, in Kentucky, at the home of Oldham’s brother, Paul—a late 1800s farmhouse sitting in the middle of fields of corn and soybeans and gamma grass, where Will Oldham also lived for a time. Sweeney remembers walking outside, in the snow, hearing his own playing at a distant remove. They watched Planet of the Apes movies with the sound turned down, or Mohammad Ali fights on VHS. At the end of the session, Sweeney recalled, they were pleased enough to have dreams of doing something different with it—more elaborate, or noisier, perhaps, than the usual way they released music.\n\nOldham, always keen on control, didn’t like the fact that he’d lost some measure of it. “So it kind of turned into this thing where he was like, ‘Do me a favor: Don't do that. And tell Rick Rubin not to play those mixes for anybody.’” In the end, Sweeney kept the rest of the music to himself, and asked Rubin to do the same. “We ended up sort of agreeing to disagree. But also agreeing just not to push it, you know?” Though they did tour, playing the songs after the record came out, the Superwolf promotional effort was over before it even began.\n\n“There's a Minutemen line that I think of all the time,” Oldham told me, wryly. “Which is: Let the products sell themselves.”\n\nI recall coming across the record in the spring of 2005, and becoming obsessed with it—I could never quite figure out what it was about, and I liked that. It was like a beautiful object whose purpose wasn’t immediately clear. In the ensuing years, I would occasionally meet other people like myself, who’d found the record however they found it, and built some intense but essentially private relationship with it. Others were more public. Once the record was finally released, Rick Rubin became an advocate, recommending it in interviews and to other musicians he was working with.“It was my favorite album for some time,” Rubin recalled. “I remember sitting in my car on La Cienega Blvd. with [well-known mixer, producer, and film composer] Dave Sardy playing it for him. I remember specifically because he knew Sweeney and up until hearing that, didn’t believe Sweeney could play guitar.” Rubin began hiring Sweeney for session work: “I liked both the reference points chosen, the looseness of the playing and the emotion in it.”\n\nOver time word would get back to Oldham, or Sweeney, of other unlikely people falling in love with the record. One of those people, Sweeney told me by way of example, was the magician David Blaine. “David Blaine is a huge Will fan,” Sweeney said, laughing. “And a couple of years ago, we ended up writing a song for David about being David Blaine. He was talking about retiring from magic. So Will wrote this really cool lyric about that. And then I made up music to go with it. David paid for us to record it. And he uses it in his show now, like at the end of the show. The song is called ‘Not Fooling You.’ It's kind of exit music, but I texted him the other day, and he's like ‘Yeah, for me that song is what the show is.’ I think it's after he holds his breath for ten minutes, the song comes on.”\n\nSuperwolf, at this point, is in some ways now a distant memory for both Sweeney and Oldham. (Rubin too: “It’s been hard to find lately,” he said, “but every time I hear it, it never disappoints.”) Oldham told me he couldn’t remember the last time he actually listened to it—part of the reason why he decided to relent and put the music on Spotify. “The nice thing is that the way the contracts are written, things can be pulled at a moment's notice. So it's not we're not committed to doing this for eternity. Like the whole catalog could come down tomorrow if we wanted it to come down tomorrow. But it was getting to be where, what was I having input and or control of? It was kind of nothing anymore, you know? Like, if you think of a song as your offspring, at this point some of these records are more like great grandchildren. Enough time has passed and your influence over them has waned. You know, like, ‘Tommy doesn't write me. The last I heard he was in the Peace Corps in Pakistan and that was like three years ago.’ It started to feel like we’d done everything with them in their present iterations that was possible.”\n\nThe two men are recording new music now, they told me, that might someday live in public under the Superwolf name. Both were sort of amused, and maybe a bit incredulous, to be talking about something they made in 2005. But Oldham has always been a little romantic about stuff like this: putting things in the world, seeing how they come back.\n\n“Ultimately, we need certain things in our life, musically,” he said. “And if you don't give up, they're making their way towards you. Sometimes at a slower than a slug’s pace. But that record is waiting for you. And it's going to hit you tomorrow or next week: here it is, all of a sudden. Just because the record crept its way, slowly but surely dragging itself along, until it found its home in your head where it belongs.”\n\nRead More\n\nEarth to André 3000: The OutKast Icon Talks Life After “Hey Ya!”\n\nA raw interview and rare photoshoot with the elusive hip-hop legend."
