        "text": "32/50\n\nSlint\n\nSpiderland (Touch and Go, 1991)\n\nThirty years of scrutiny haven’t demystified the strange aura of Spiderland, an album which continues to cast a long shadow over rock music, as well as over anyone who steps into its disquieting embrace. The combination of Slint’s mystique and the unforced, pervasive darkness of the sound persistently beckons listeners to Spiderland: some remain for the dynamic scale of the music, whereas others develop a Robert Graysmith-esque obsession over the gaps in the album’s history. Either way, it’s a haunting experience which can never be completely shaken or forgotten.\n\nSlint’s second (and final) album was recorded when the group members were barely out of their teens, though they disbanded before its release in March 1991. Several thousand copies were pressed and released to a modest local reception, but without an operational band to promote it, Spiderland arrived with no real fanfare to speak of. There was no tour, no press run, no push for additional promo material. Apart from a glowing ten-star review from Steve Albini in Melody Maker, there was nothing to signpost Spiderland to anyone beyond the vibrant underground circuit of Louisville, Kentucky. It was only through word-of-mouth that Spiderland succeeded to travel as far as it eventually did: over the course of the decade, it acquired cult status, and steadily found appreciation as one of the foundational works of the post- and math-rock genres.\n\nAs new audiences were finding their way to Spiderland in this period, the individual members of Slint generally remained active, continuing to release music in collaboration with various artists through to the present day. The band reconvened in 1992 and 1994 to work on new material, and while nothing (supposedly) came of the sessions, two instrumentals that were recorded prior to the Spiderland sessions were released as a 10-inch in 1994. A handful of festival dates and reunion shows peppered the 2010s, including a performance at the Green Man Festival in 2014. (As someone who attended that year’s fest but missed the set – given I knew nothing of Slint at the time – I now feel like a total chump.) These sporadic returns, and the members’ gradual involvement in interviews and retrospective press has done some work to unshroud the group itself, and Spiderland no longer exists as a document seemingly flung out of space (as it did in the early 1990s): anyone can easily learn about album’s genesis and its place in the rock canon.\n\nThe two most in-depth studies of Slint’s history and legacy arrived in the 2010s. Scott Tennent’s Spiderland entry for the 33 1/3 series presents an ardently illuminating exploration of the Louisville music scene of the time, and Lance Bangs’ documentary Breadcrumb Trail gives insight into the nature of the musicians whose alchemy birthed one of the most influential albums of the decade. But despite the relative wealth of material that now exists about Slint, nothing quite pierces the eerie otherworldliness of Spiderland. Any answers to questions regarding its creation feel unsatisfactorily pedestrian, confined to the ever-disappointing realm of reality. Four guys who were rotating through various Louisville groups gelled together for long enough to record two albums: the first schlocky and raw (Tweez), the second quietly masterful (Spiderland). There is common ground between the two, not least the technical chops of guitarist David Pajo and drummer Britt Walford, but at a glance, they could be the works of two unrelated groups. The wired sloppiness of Tweez is riddled with clownery: while Slint’s potential is occasionally palatable, it’s offset by bizarre flourishes such as the opening chatter about busted headphones, and half-hidden recordings of the band members supposedly defecating.\n\nBy contrast, Spiderland is ruthlessly sombre. The squalling noise is dialled back, there are no puerile in-jokes, and the songs are patiently controlled in progression and volume. Nothing can quite explain or rationalise how the pranksters of Tweez landed on something so preternaturally haunting after a matter of months. Spiderland sounds like a glimpse of some unknowable force that infiltrated the final recordings, or as Tennent describes ‘Washer’: “it doesn’t feel like a song the rest of us are supposed to hear”. Myths have been cultivated from the tales around the album: some convincing, some ridiculous, some confirmed, some dispelled. But regardless of how much you choose to buy into the album’s contextual mythos, when listening to Spiderland, there’s a tantalising sense that the answers to a profoundly huge and disturbing question is right there in the fabric of the recording. It remains just out of sight, impossible to fully parse, but once experienced, it can never be fully shaken. Like many unanswered questions, it exerts its own gravitational pull that continues to draw many listeners – including myself – back again and again.\n\nThe cover of Spiderland contributes to this profoundly. This photograph of Slint was taken in a quarry in Utica, where members of the group occasionally liked to go swimming. The image – taken by Will Oldham (aka Bonnie “Prince” Billy) – shows the boys floating in the water, smiling right down the lens at the viewer. It’s a moment frozen in time: a snapshot of youth that juxtaposes a supposedly carefree moment with an unnerving visual presentation. Blurry, stark, and sapped of the day’s colour, the photograph takes on a dimension of loss, resembling a low-res printout of four missing kids. This image, paired with the tension of the music and the rumours of psychological distress surrounding the recording, gives Spiderland a foreboding aura right from the listener’s first sight of it. What happened to the boys in the quarry?\n\nThe songs of Spiderland (excepting the instrumental ‘For Dinner…’) have the disturbing and dreamlike quality of Edgar Allan Poe stories, and taken in sequence, they evoke a gathering darkness. Long-time inseparables Walford and Brian McMahan co-wrote almost everything here, their writing centring on distinctive individuals with folkloric attributes: fortune-tellers, vampires, lost sea captains. The results unravel like tales: they begin and they end, but something changes along the way, something which irrevocably alters a fundamental aspect of the characters involved. The album moves through these points of no return one by one, some of them oblique (the relationship of the protagonists in ‘Breadcrumb Trail’), some more explicit (the final words of ‘Washer’), finally ending on the barren shoreline of ‘Good Morning, Captain’. The songwriting (if you can call it that, given how few of them resemble “sung” songs that operate with melody and rhythm) is threadbare, and not objectively enthralling. Nor are the voices of McMahan and Walford, whose mostly affectless mumbles are barely intelligible, even in the album’s quietest moments. The writing is basic in the manner of a teenager’s attempts at conveying atmosphere, occasionally nothing more than blunt reportage. “I stepped out onto the midway,” McMahan begins on ‘Breadcrumb Trail’. “I was looking for the pirate ship, and saw this small, old white tent at one end. It was blue, and had white lights hanging all around it. I decided to check out the tent.”\n\nThe first three songs follow this lead, opening with stripped-back statements of exposition: “I live in a castle. I am a prince” and “Don stepped outside”. As they continue, internal and external dramas take hold: the prince of ‘Nosferatu Man’ pursues an enrapturing figure through the night, and Don turns increasingly inwards as his social anxiety suffocates him after leaving a party. For the most part, the lyrics don’t seem particularly gripping when isolated from the songs, but when heard in context, the effect is striking. Words and music are knotted tightly together on Spiderland: to experience one without the other is to leave something crucial behind. There’s a symbiosis of language and performance which rarely feels this essential, elevating both beyond their manifest quality into a whole that is much more affecting. Time signatures shift and jolt, spindly guitar refrains are built into roaring buzzsaws, cathartic moments of release are constantly hinted at, but seldom realised. Tennent summarises it perfectly: “Slint’s fractured storytelling is compelling because the narrative arc is studiously intertwined with music that is anything but monotonous”.\n\nThe final track ‘Good Morning, Captain’ remains Slint’s most famous song, and for good reason. It builds to Spiderland’s loudest and heaviest ascension, and a crescendo which is the clearest precursor to the work of groups who took Slint’s carefully orchestrated dynamics as their own template. Additionally, like Neutral Milk Hotel’s ‘Two-Headed Boy, Part Two’ or Daughters’ ‘Guest House’, it’s an album closer that feels like the capstone to all that came before. The sound is unsettlingly tense and the meaning of the song is left ambiguous, but the searing desolation of the piece is irrefutable. The band are in total command of the mounting dread and horror as McMahan describes a shipwreck survivor clinging to his life, sanity, and sense of self. Exactly one minute before Spiderland ends, McMahan screams. And it’s a real scream. That repeated howl of “I miss you”, open to so many equally valid – and equally chilling – interpretations might be the primary aspect that keeps drawing me back to Spiderland. It’s terrifying. Given his reticence in interviews, McMahan has never fully tapped into what fuelled this expulsion of palatable anguish. In Breadcrumb Trail, Walford recollects that his bandmate was dripping with sweat in the studio, and that once the recording was complete, McMahan ran to the bathroom, the physical and emotional strain of the moment having made him physically sick. Shortly after recording Spiderland, McMahan checked himself into a hospital, and not long after that, announced to his bandmates that he was leaving Slint.\n\nThese anecdotes are the ones most sensationalised in Slint’s history, prompting speculation over McMahan’s mental health at the time. Personally, I find these takes intrusive at best, and insensitive at worst, reducing the complexity and nuance of Slint’s achievements and struggles to unsubstantiated prying. But with or without awareness of such stories, there’s an undeniable unease to hearing McMahan’s screams at the end of Spiderland. The desperation of the captain is corresponded to in some degree by McMahan himself, who was in his early twenties, on the cusp of adulthood. The gaunt, spectral figure of the captain terrifies the child he beseechingly approaches, and is denied a connection. Salvation, safety, innocence is closed to him. The encounter is otherworldly, possibly even hallucinatory given the set-up of the song: as the lone survivor of a shipwreck, there’s a delirious quality to the writing, with images and thoughts delivered out of a linear sequence.\n\nIt lingers long in the mind. The band members have never gone into detail about the writing of Spiderland, and I wonder if they can. The slipperiness of memory, the aporia of stressful experiences, and the process of maturing beyond the person you were at such an age all works to obfuscate any understanding of where such expressions came from. Even with all the material available to tell the story of Slint, a hole remains at the centre of Spiderland. It doesn’t feel fully understandable. The musician Richard Reed Parry (best known for Arcade Fire) best described this feeling in a comment about Neutral Milk Hotel’s In the Aeroplane Over the Sea: “I feel like I’ve lived through something I’ll never quite understand, something really big”.\n\nThe scene of the album cover can still be visited by anyone driving through Utica, Indiana. Water flows into the quarry from an underground river, and the limestone cliffs provide seclusion from the residential estates encroaching the edges of the site. I would imagine that the southeastern sky is usually a blazing blue, which would seem bizarrely out-of-place for those only familiar with the grayscale Spiderland cover, and of course, the heads of the four swimmers won’t be seen floating on the surface of the water. Having known the photograph for so long, the scene itself would probably feel “the same, but different”. You’d be looking at a site with a connection to something that feels inexplicably huge, charged with a weird profundity: a hangout spot of four kids who goofed around, made some music, and quickly disbanded, never clearly articulating exactly what force they tapped into with these songs. Personally, I don’t think they can, but to see them discuss Spiderland, the awareness of that force hasn’t been forgotten.\n\nFacing this kind of impasse, we still feel drawn to search for answers again and again, even if they never come. The water remains implacably calm, and the world keeps its unknowable secrets.\n\n04/04/21\n\nI highly recommend Scott Tennent’s brilliant retrospective of Slint in his Spiderland entry for the 33 1/3 series."
