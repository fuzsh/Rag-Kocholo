        "text": "My first response on hearing about this reissue was to hope that the cd came with a design whereby you could recognise what the disc was and which side up it was easier than the original. Original was plain silver and I had it in a broken jewel case so it fell out and disappeared for ages. It would occasionally turn up when I was tidying up and I wouldn't necessarily recognise what it was.\n\nSo nice to see it has got one black side.\n\nPackage looks pretty nice in fact.\n\nBut do really hope taht the cds come out on their own. Don't have $213 to spare.\n\nThanks for another tip, Leviethan!\n\n(I'm thinking about getting this.)\n\nIf my understanding is correct Bob Weston can't cut these all analog at Chicago Mastering. In saying that, it doesn't mean they will not sound really really good. They do quality work there!\n\nThey capture the analog signal into the digital domain using high quality converters running at 24-bit, 96kHz and the output of the DAW feeding the lathe from a 24/96 signal through 2 sets of mastering grade converters, one delayed by that 1 second.\n\nI have several lps mastered at Chicago Mastering and they range from very good to outstanding.\n\nFYI, the all analog repress (\"Golden\" in deadwax and RTI pressing) is still available for $10 at Music Direct. I have it and the sound is outstanding.\n\nJust thought that would help. I'd love to hear impressions of this remaster!\n\nHmm. I guess I should just get that repress then. $10 for an all analog LP mastered by John Golden? Sold. This is a landmark album, but I'm not in the market for boxed sets these days.\n\nA bit disappointed that labels like Merge and Touch & Go are doing vinyl/cd only combinations for some of their releases. So if you hate CDs you get them anyway. Or, as in my case I do not have enough space to store LPs so I have to by CDs only. I guess I miss out on a box I would love to have, because it doesn't make sense to buy it with the vinyl. Instead I'll have to buy the downloads and miss out on the book etc. (Please don't tell me to buy it anyway and give the LPs away or sell them to someone.)\n\nIt's a great deal and sounds really good and I'm guessing it's the original Golden stampers? Most of the T&G label represses were done at RTI but not all. I have the other slint 10\" and it has the old KDisc Golden stampers but is repressed at Rainbo. The pressing is fine though with a little noise.\n\nI'd be lying if I said I didn't love this album $150 much (+shipping) hopefully they'll still have some by the time I get some money around though.\n\nWow, just saw this. What ridiculousness. I'm tired of these \"deluxe\" reissue type things. $150 for basically one album and bunch of material the band didn't think was good enough to make the cut the first time around. I bought this record sometime in the mid-90s for $8-10, I'm sure that'll just be fine.\n\nSpot on. I skipped the \"Nevermind\" and \"In Utero\" Nirvana Super Deluxe box sets because... well, talk about prohibitive pricing! They really know how to take the mick out of the fans!"
