        "text": "Slint was an American band formed 1986 in Louisville, Kentucky, by Brian McMahan (vocals, guitar), David Pajo (guitar), Britt Walford (drums, guitar, vocals), and Ethan Buckler (bass). Todd Brashear, took over on bass from Ethan Buckler in 1989. The band split in 1991 and even though they only made two albums and one EP in their short life, Slint are regarded by many as the founders of the post-rock movement on the strength of their classic 1991 album Spiderland. Before forming Slint, Walford and McMahan were buddies at junior school, and formed the punk band Squirrel Bait while still in their teens. Walford was also in the band Maurice with David Pajo, and that band's material would form the basis of some of Slint's early compositions. The founding trio eventually came together under the name Small Tight Dirty Tufts of Hair, and played one abortive gig. They were soon joined by McMahan and renamed themselves Slint after one of Walford's pet fish. Slint's first album Tweez was recorded in 1987 by Steve Albini, whom the band chose because they were fans of Albini's group Big Black. Minneapolis producer Brian Paulson and the band worked over one weekend to record Spiderland in Chicago. All of the music was recorded live, with vocals overdubbed afterward in no more than two takes and with little to no rehearsal by McMahan. The day after Spiderland's recording session ended, McMahan checked himself into a mental hospital where he was diagnosed with depression, and subsequently left the band. Spiderland is considered a seminal work, characterized by dark, syncopated rhythms, sparse guitar lines and haunting subject matter. The record's impact helped to usher in a new wave of bands seeking a move away from the unfettered aggression of hardcore punk. The band released the excellent Slint EP in 1994.\n\nArtist Website: slintmusic.com\n\nFeatured Albums: Slint"
