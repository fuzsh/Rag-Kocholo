Background information Birth Name Britt Walford Alias Mike Hunt, Shannon Daughton Born 1970 Occupation Musician Genres Post-Rock, Hardcore Punk, Psychedelic Rock, Indie Rock, Folk, Alternative Rock Instrument(s) Drums, Guitar, Vocals Years active 1983 - Present Labels Drag City, Touch and Go, Temporary Residence, Self-Destruct, Domino Associated acts Maurice, Slint, Squirrel Bait, King Kong, Breeders, Evergreen, Papa M, Watter\n\nBritt Walford is a musician originating from Louisville, Kentucky. Known early in his career for his involvement in punk bands such as Maurice and Squirrel Bait he is best known for his tenures in the seminal post-rock band Slint, his time with alternative rock band The Breeders and currently his work in the post-rock/psychedelic band Watter.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBritt Walford's musical beginnings involved punk rock, namely the Louisville bands Squirrel Bait and Maurice. Notably with the former he would be in the band long enough to perform on the band's self-titled album and with the latter managed to tour with Samhain in 1986. However by that same year he would become a founding member of the seminal post-rock group Slint. In his tenure with Slint the band released two albums, the latter being the iconic Spiderland album in 1990. However, Slint had disbanded by the time of the album's release.\n\nBesides Slint, Walford had been involved with a host of musical projects such as the first releases for dance-rock band King Kong (Featuring original Slint bassist Ethan Buckler) and The Breeders, performing on the album Pod under the psuedonym \"Mike Hunt\". Walford would notably dress in drag for his performances with the band at that time. Walford had also been involved with other Louisville bands through the 1990s such as Evergreen, The For Carnation and The Palace Brothers. However by the late 1990s his musical activity would slow, notably moving to Washington state for a time working in a bakery.\n\nEventually Walford would return to music, performing with a reunited Slint for three tenures (2005, 2007, and a string of shows in 2013 and 2014). A documentary featuring the band directed by Lester Bangs entitled Breadcrumb Trail saw release around that time and featured as a bonus with a remastered Spiderland. Walford also joined the psychedelic/experimental project Watter in 2013, performing as the drummer on their debut album This World. Watter would tour twice with Om in 2014 and then tour Europe that next year alongside Holy Sons and Lilacs and Champagne. However by 2016, Walford would only be contributing to the group as a studio guest, appearing on a handful of songs for the band's 2017 follow-up album History Of The Future.\n\nBands[]\n\nMaurice - Drums (1983 - 1986)\n\nSquirrel Bait - Drums (1983 - 1988)\n\nSlint - Drums (1986 - 1990, 2005, 2007, 2013 - 2014)\n\nKing Kong - Drums, Keyboards (1989 - 1990)\n\nThe Breeders - Drums (1990 - 1992)\n\nEvergreen - Drums (1994 - 1996)\n\nWatter - Drums (2013 - 2015)\n\nDiscography[]\n\nWith Maurice[]\n\nThe First Shall Be Last (2011, Blazebirth; Recorded 1983 - 1984)\n\nwith Squirrel Bait[]\n\nSquirrel Bait (1985, Homestead)\n\nWith Slint[]\n\nTweez (1989, Jennifer Hartman Records)\n\nSpiderland (1991, Touch and Go Records)\n\nGlenn / Rhoda (1994, Touch and Go Records)\n\nWith Breeders[]\n\nPod (As \"Mike Hunt\") (1990, 4AD)\n\nSafari (As \"Shannon Doughton\") (1992, 4AD)\n\nWith Evergreen[]\n\nPants Off / The Queen Song (1994, Hi-Ball)\n\nEvergreen (1996, Hi-Ball)\n\nWarnings From Never Never Land (1999, E-Harp 99)\n\nWith King Kong[]\n\nMovie Star - Drums & Vocals (1989, independent; later Drag City)\n\nFunny Farm - Keyboards (1993, Drag City)\n\nWith Watter[]\n\nThis World (2014, Temporary Residence Records)\n\nHistory of The Future (Selected Tracks) (2017, Temporary Residence)"
