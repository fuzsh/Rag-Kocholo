        "text": "This directory contains the different versions of the Slint logo. It is (manually) copied into the website under https://slint.dev/logo/.\n\nDo not modify the logo by changing the colors, changing of the aspect ration, or other alterations to the corporate identity.\n\nWhen using the logo to refer to Slint from a location not dedicated to Slint, use the full versions of the logo with the full tagline (\"GUI toolkit\").\n\nWhen using the logo to refer to Slint for illustrative purposes, from a place where the viewer is expected to already know about Slint (e.g. because it is on the Slint website itself) use the simple versions of the logo.\n\nFor the cases where a square or circular logo is required (e.g. social media avatar), the square versions of the logo can be used. Prefer the version with the text.\n\nFor a small icon where the text would not be visible otherwise, use the square versions of the logo without the text.\n\nUse the #MadeWithSlint logo for attributions to Slint (e.g. when using Slint under the Royalty-Free License).\n\nFor Dark mode/backgrounds, use the versions with dark.\n\nFor Light mode/backgrounds, use the versions with light.\n\nIf the background switched between dark and light mode, but only one logo can be shown, use the versions with whitebg.\n\nThe Slint blue color is:\n\nFor Screen: #2379F4 (Hex), R=35 G=121 B=244, Tint = 100,\n\nFor Print: CMYK = 75,45,0,0,\n\nFor Spot Color (Pantone): PMS 2727 C.\n\nThe name of the product is Slint, not Slint UI.\n\nslint-ui or slint_ui is used as username for online service when (and only when) slint is already taken.\n\nThe company (legal entity) behind Slint is SixtyFPS GmbH. That name should only be used to refer to the company, including the GmbH. (SixtyFPS was the former name of the product but should no longer be used.) Employees of SixtyFPS GmbH should still use the name Slint whenever possible (e.g. on conference badges)."
