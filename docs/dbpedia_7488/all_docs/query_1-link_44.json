        "text": "What was Slint? That’s the perennial question with these guys.\n\nOne iconic album, one (interesting?) debut album (that nobody noticed when it came out), a solid EP, and then…CRICKETS.\n\nIn one sense, it seems fitting that Slint was lost to the quiet night of distant memory. However, if you want to know the whole story of Slint, check out Scott Tennant’s book from the 33 1/3 series. It’s the definitive picture of the band, IMHO.\n\nRelease Year: 1989\n\nMy Rating: B\n\nI’m one of those kids that heard the Slint-hype and bought this instead of Spiderland. So I didn’t get the hype for a while, because Tweez is not Spiderland, and honestly, I don’t think Tweez is really even accessible until you’ve heard Spiderland and are just looking for more Slint. It’s the totally bizarre dude who is probably mentally unstable and really weirds you out, but once you’ve spent some time with them, becomes familiar and even relatable, despite remaining someone you really wouldn’t want to introduce to others. Also, once you’ve heard this, you’ll understand where Surfer Rosa came from.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: “Ron”, “Carol”, “Charlotte”\n\nRelease Year: 1991\n\nMy Rating: A+\n\nHard to find a more legendary and mysterious record than this one. Steve Albini did us all a solid when he famously gave this “Ten Fucking Stars” once upon a time, because I do wonder if this would have gotten the same notice without that line. It really is something though.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: “Breadcrumb Trail”, “Washer”, “For Dinner”, “Good Morning, Captain”\n\nRelease Year: 1994\n\nMy Rating: A\n\nTwo tracks that, in my view, demonstrate what this band might have been capable of had they stuck it out and become a cracking live act. “Glenn” is a great instrumental, but it’s the live essence of the new version of Tweez’s “Rhoda” (retitled “Rhonda” here) that really impresses me. Totally revelatory on what this band could have been had they continued on to LP3…\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: both of them\n\nRelease Year: 2014\n\nMy Rating: C+\n\nFor an album as iconic and legendary as Spiderland, one would hope for much more from the MOTHERLODE deluxe edition reissue, but the truth of the matter is Slint were just 4 ambitious indie kids that no one believed in until they’d already broken up and moved on. That means that their just isn’t much else to go on, despite the fact that the band did briefly reunite around 1994 to make another go of it. I don’t maybe there’s more, but the things we can be most excited about here are a studio outtake of rarity “Pam” as well as a couple of raw post-Spiderland demos that in true Slint fashion are only named for their composer. Honestly, neither feels very inspired – my high school bands made cooler stuff than them on jambox recordings – but it’s Slint so I’ll take what I can get. Still, a studio version of “King’s Approach” would have been sweet. HIGHLIGHTS: “Pam (Rough Mix, Spiderland Outtake)”, “Pam (4 Track Vocal Demo)”\n\nThem Slint kidz have created a whole lot of music aside from Slint: Tweez-era bassist Ethan Buckler has King Kong, Dave Pajo started Papa M (and has been in everything), Brian McMahan started The For Carnation, and Britt Walford has been all over the place from The Breeders to Evergreen. So I won’t cover everything related here, but I will hit on tracks or projects in which a 3 or 4 members have been involved together.\n\nRelease Year: 1994\n\nMy Rating: A+\n\nOne side of this 7″ release is a cover of Sally Timms’ “Horses”, and not only is it amazing, but it is Will Oldham with Spiderland-era Slint as his backing band. That’s right, all 4 of the Spiderland players feature on this one, and when you realize that, it does kind of sound like countrified Slint. It’s one of my all-time favorite tracks, the kind of cover that vastly improves on the original by getting to the essence of the song itself, and all of the playing is great, but it’s Pajo’s face-melting guitar solo that really steals the show here. I dearly wish I could play guitar like that."
