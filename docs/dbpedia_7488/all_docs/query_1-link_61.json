        "text": "HELLO SUMMER 1986\n\nBefore Slint, the drummer Britt [Walford] and I had a band called Maurice in Louisville, Kentucky. I was replacing Brian McMahan who also played guitar with Squirrel Bait, who were kind of taking off. I was already a huge fan – I didn’t know Britt really, then I showed up at the first practice and I knew all their songs. I have a tape of that first practice and it’s crazy. We’d never played together but we had this almost jazz, psychic connection, where I would throw in this lick and he would throw in a drum fill at the same time and they’d be exactly in sync. I guess the Louisville punk scene kind of recognised me as a musician when I started playing in Maurice, because it was total shredding, show-off, heavy extreme guitar. The last Maurice song, a song I wrote called New Dave, was all clean guitars, it was melodic – justifiably, the singer, who was more of a punk singer, was like, “I can’t sing to this.”"
