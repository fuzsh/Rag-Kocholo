        "text": "We know what happened to Slint after their 1991 finale and masterpiece Spiderland. They’d broken up months ahead of its release, splitting up to focus on various side projects—each of them worked in some capacity with Will Oldham's Palace Music, David Pajo became a prolific sideman and frontman, and Brian McMahan led the excellent For Carnation. They eventually reunited in 2005 for a short run of tour dates, where their once-obscure music found a bigger audience than it ever had while they were an active band.\n\nBut what happened to Slint before the release of Spiderland—a steely, hyper-sensitive record that helped shape the blueprint of post-rock—is less certain. Were the members as dark and brooding as the music suggested? What was it about their middle-American roots that led to their singular sound? What musical Svengali put them on their particular path?\n\nA forthcoming reissue of Spiderland, on April 15 through Touch and Go, helps pull back the curtains on the band’s genesis. The box set's 104-page book paints Slint as a group of friendly teenagers who liked to climb walls and paste crass flyers to the back of their makeshift tour van for their brief trips outside of their hometown of Louisville. They liked potty humor and loved hardcore music. Breadcrumb Trail, an accompanying 93-minute documentary by filmmaker and Slint zealot Lance Bangs shows the band's members as neighborhood kids who loved pranks, played their first show during a church service, and pulled a shotgun on Steve Albini. The reissue package provides an intimate look at and listen to a band that has meant so much but often said so little.\n\nPitchfork: There’s a tendency to look at Slint as a brooding band. But the book and the film show that you were goofballs. There were a lot of penis jokes.\n\nDavid Pajo: We were pretty normal—suburban kids having a good time playing in bands. We were silly. We weren’t dark, intense, humorless people. Humor was one of the connecting forces among us. It was more like camaraderie. When we woke up every morning, one of our things was, “Let’s go put a new sign in the back window of the van.” Those are the different signs we had up in the back of our van, so that the people behind us could have something enjoyable to look at.\n\nPitchfork: Which produced more nostalgia for you: assembling the Spiderland box set or doing the 2005 reunion tour?\n\nBrian McMahan: The box set layout was something that just hit me… it’s so incredibly simple, but it’s spare in this way that totally honors where my head was at when Spiderland came out. It was like revisiting the aesthetic and seeing how incredibly simple things were. That's the biggest source of nostalgia for me.\n\nPitchfork: Was the Slint breakup a fraught or a casual thing?\n\nDP: It was pretty common to form bands that only lasted a few years. Slint was my favorite band that I was in at the time, and I didn’t realize that I was bummed out about it until quite a while later. But there was no bitterness. It was just a totally rational, common-sense breakup. It didn’t feel like losing a girlfriend. That format just splintered off, but it came back in different forms as the years went by.\n\nBM: It did just seem like that’s what was going to happen next. Maybe I’m fatalistic. I don’t know if the monogamous relationship analogy is really a good one, honestly, for Slint. It may have been more of a casual relationship.\n\nDP: We were pretty young, and I lacked quite a bit of common sense. I stayed a kid for a pretty long time, and the logistics of being in a band, I did not take seriously at all. I was into the music, but the idea of showing up places on time or having to tell people when you’re not going to be somewhere—that just didn’t even cross my mind. People like a story that has a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But I don’t think the Slint story really has that.\n\nPitchfork: During the last decade, a debate has emerged about old bands reuniting and touring only on old material, essentially cashing in on their past. What's your take on that?\n\nBM: Do I find that distasteful, exploiting old material? Yes, I do. But any of these times that we’ve played together, it's only happened because a really hardcore group of people wanted it to happen. It was not something we had planned or were looking to cash in. People ask you repeatedly, and you finally start to get the sense that people would really like to hear this song performed live in front of them.\n\nDP: On a musical level, I do find it rewarding. It’s not like I want to blow my brains out while I’m playing these songs from so long ago. I am still surprised by the way the songs are constructed—note choices, the way the arrangements are made, the way these songs are assembled. I’m still amazed at times.\n\nPitchfork: The look and the reach of indie rock have changed significantly since you made Spiderland. What was the experience of being in an indie band in Louisville at the time?\n\nBM: I think of that time as a set of personal and geographic relationships. There was a strong Louisville connection with Chicago, which was the closest major city and five or six hours away. When we were making this music, you obviously couldn’t go online and hear almost any group that you possibly would have heard of for free or immediately. That was unthinkable. Connections made hinged on who had the deepest record collection, who had been where recently, who was talked to when a band passed through town, what news was brought through when a band came through town.\n\nEven to the extent that fanzines existed, it was still a slow process. By the time you read those magazines, a third of those bands were probably not in existence. That’s how long it took to filter through, to get into people’s hands. A lot of the bands that we identified with or inspired us or formalized my conception of what could be done as a band during that time were bands that I had met personally. There wasn’t much coercion from afar.\n\nDP: Most people found out about Slint in the mid or late 90s, but we were an ’80s band. We started in 1986 and broke up at the end of 1990. The majority of these songs were written in the late ’80s, and that was a pretty different time period for music and technology.\n\nI found out about music through talking about music. I would say, “I really like Side Two of My War,” and somebody would say, “You might like these Swans EPs that just came out.” It was usually people that were able to get records or were talking regularly to people in New York and Chicago.\n\nPitchfork: Did that geographic isolation help Slint's sound and aesthetic?\n\nBM: We were self-referencing our material: “Well, we did that, so it seem like it would be cool to do this next.” There wasn’t any outside influence. It was just to entertain ourselves, essentially, because we had next to no fans. By today’s standards, it was probably an unimaginably insular experience, playing in a band and writing music in Louisville, despite the periodic infusions of culture. Things happened a lot slower.\n\nDP: Louisville was also good place for being able to make whatever kind of music you wanted to. You didn’t have to worry about renting a practice space or figure out when another band would be in there or worry about if your stuff is going to get stolen….\n\nWe made basement practice songs.To have them presented in such a huge fashion today—like at Primavera, where it’s thousands of people in a festival environment—is surreal. I never thought some of the songs would ever need to be projected at such a volume or to such a wide span of people."
