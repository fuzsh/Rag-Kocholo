        "text": "Slint - 'Breadcrumb Trail'\n\nInfluential rock act Slint, whose brief career is documented in the film \"Breadcrumb Trail.\"\n\n(Will Oldham)\n\nFrom the vanished band behind it to its seemingly placid cover art, Slint's \"Spiderland\" has long been one of indie rock's more mysterious albums. In \"Breadcrumb Trail,\" Portland-based director Lance Bangs traces the origins of Slint, the seminal Louisville band, collecting interviews with each member as well as notable affiliates such as Steve Albini and Ian MacKaye. What he arrives at is the story of a teenage quartet whose wavelengths clicked through hours of practice, pranks and friendship.\n\nBefore My Morning Jacket and Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy, the Louisville of the 1980s was a hardcore town. By the time Brian McMahan, Britt Walford, David Pajo and Todd Brashear -- four teenagers just a year into college -- recorded \"Spiderland\" in 1990, they had a lifetime's worth of experience in the punk underground. (Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy's Will Oldham, then a fresh-faced kid in oxford shirts who was once asked to join the band, makes a few photographic appearances.) The film explores this background thoroughly, spending more time telling than showing, though it should have enough rare performance and rehearsal footage to appease serious fans.\n\nWhat's most fascinating about the film is how many dots it connects: drummer Britt Walford, portrayed in the film as perhaps Slint's mastermind, went on to live with LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy and played on the Breeders' \"Pod\" under a fake name; pre-Slint band Maurice toured with Glenn Danzig's Samhain in the '80s, while its members were still in high school. And the movie ably dissects the creative process that led to \"Spiderland,\" an abstract, alienated guitar album that was an influential landmark for the slowcore and post-rock music that followed the visceral punk Slint itself outgrew.\n\nThe film's participants are a bit oblique about the band's sudden dissolution and other darker moments, including a car accident that's quickly narrated, though outsiders, including an amused Murphy and Walford's supportive, straight-laced parents, supply some balancing levity. It may not answer every question, but it's an illuminating look at a band that found an audience of thousands and helped set the tone for independent music for years to come.\n\nGrade: B\n\n(90 minutes, screens at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 14 at the Northwest Film Center's Whitsell Auditorium, 1219 S.W. Park Ave.; director in attendance; $9; nwfilm.org/screenings/58/606/\n\n-- David Greenwald"
