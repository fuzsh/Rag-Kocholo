The album was recorded in a single weekend by McMahan, guitarist Dave Pajo (who would later on play with Tortoise, Stereolab, Billy Corgan’s Zwan, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Interpol), drummer Britt Walford and bassist Todd Brashear in 1991.\n\nMcMahan didn’t know this at the time, but during the following two decades the album would become a classic, revered cornerstone of the post-rock movement, and it influenced everyone from Scotland’s Mogwai (whose esthetics are very much based on Slint’s limited output) to Montreal instrumental collective Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and numerous art-punk and progressive metal bands.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“We didn’t know what to expect,” McMahan, Slint’s vocalist and guitarist, said via phone during a tour stop in Los Angeles. “We had some pretty lofty goals and we were listening to albums we considered to be classics. We really wanted to make an album that could sit beside these others. I mean, it was kind of audacious.\n\n“But obviously we had no idea,” he added. “No one liked us, really. It’s not like we had any feedback or music biz types pursuing us. We were sitting in our drummer’s parents’ basement, practising our songs. We just used our imagination.”\n\nMcMahan laughed.\n\nSlint is touring in support of the deluxe box set reissue of Spiderland released earlier this year, a project that took eight painstaking years to complete with producer Bob Weston and designer Jeremy Devine and features a revamped version of the classic album and a selection of outtakes and rarities.\n\nSpiderland may not stylistically resemble the albums McMahan said the band members were listening to in 1991, a steady diet that included U.S. Midwest punk and DIY rock, as well as Neil Young (On The Beach, especially), AC/DC’s early stuff and more spaced-out material like the Mahavishnu Orchestra and Philip Glass Ensemble.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMashed together, you got Spiderland: a crossover of rock, alternative, punk, instrumental and noisy experimental textures.\n\nSlint began when McMahan was in high school. All the members of the band were close friends, ranging from ages 15-17.\n\nTheir first gig took place at Unitarian church, in the spring of 1986.\n\n“That was unique — a landmark,” McMahan said. “It was still in the early, formative stages but it was definitely Slint. The name was ‘BEADS: Small Tight Dirty Tufts of Hair.’ Within three or four months we were Slint.”\n\nSlint, which sounds much less convoluted, was the name of one of Walford’s pet fish.\n\n“It was fairly absurdist and nonsensical,” McMahan said. “It was really a function of our drummer’s sense of humour. He’s an exceptionally creative and really idiosyncratic thinker.”\n\nTheir 1989 debut album Tweez (whose song titles were all based on the band members’ parents) was recorded with Steve Albini, who would garner international attention for his work on Nirvana’s In Utero a few years later.\n\nThrough Albini, McMahan got one of the best and funniest compliments he ever received about Slint and its output.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“He was working with Robert Plant and Jimmy Page on the Page and Plant record in the late ’90s or early aughts, and they were at a pub,” McMahan said. “I don’t know what precipitated it but apparently there was some live music and Jimmy Page turned to Robert Plant and said, ‘Ah! Sounds like Slint!’ And it was a compliment, I guess.\n\n“That’s a good story. I don’t know the guys, and I think it’s better that way.”\n\nMcMahan laughed.\n\nMcMahan blamed the lengthy remaster/reissue process, which began soon after Slint’s first round of reunion concerts in 2005, on “having families and living in different places, being busy and engaged with whatever we were doing. But we’re also a pretty weird, scattered, obsessive group of people.”\n\nSlint’s forthcoming performance at the Rickshaw Theatre in Vancouver will be their first western Canadian performance of the seminal album.\n\nOf performing the album live, MacMahan said, “It varies from night to night. It varies on the age. It’s different in different parts of the world. People relate to it fairly personally, which seems to work pretty well. A lot of the people that show up are pretty familiar with (the record).”\n\nSome are so familiar with Spiderland, in fact, that they can be seen mouthing the words along with McMahan during the spoken word bits.\n\nEvidently, everyone ultimately screams the famous “I MISS YOU!” line in the climax of album closer Good Morning, Captain.\n\n“It’s really cool, and it’s really weird,” McMahan said. “It’s neat to have that sort of connection.”\n\nfmarchand@vancouversun.com\n\ntwitter.com/FMarchandVS\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
