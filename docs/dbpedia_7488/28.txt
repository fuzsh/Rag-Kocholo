Slint was an American rock band formed in Louisville, KY in 1986. They disbanded following the recording of their second full-length album, Spiderland, in 1991. The group consisted of Brian McMahan (guitar and vocals), David Pajo (guitar), Britt Walford (drums and vocals), Todd Brashear (bass on Spiderland), and Ethan Buckler (bass on Tweez). Both McMahan and Britt Walford were members of Squirrel Bait in their teens.

In 2005, 2007 and 2014 the band reunited to play a number of live shows. On the 2007 tour dates, in addition to performing songs from Spiderland and the untitled 10", they also debuted a new composition called "King's Approach." Their 2014 tour coincided with the release of a box set compiling a remastered version of the Spiderland LP, previously unreleased studio outtakes and demos, and a new documentary film about their origins and the Louisville music scene.

Peel first got into Slint in 1989 and played their material until the band split in 1991. The group also had an entry in the 1991 Festive Fifty, which was abandoned in that year due to not many people voting but it was revived in 1993, when the results of the 1991 Festive Fifty was broadcast playing the tracks at the rate of one per show.
