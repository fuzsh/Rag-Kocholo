Slint were a math rock band formed in 1986 in Louisville, Kentucky. The first iteration of the group consisted of Britt Walford on drums and vocals, Brian McMahan on guitar and vocals, David Pajo on guitar, and Ethan Buckler on bass. In the autumn of 1987, the quartet enlisted Steve Albini as a sound engineer and recorded their first album, Tweez. The debut album saw release two years later on the independent label of friend of the band Jennifer Hartman. After the release of Tweez, Buckler left Slint to form his band King Kong and was replaced on bass by Todd Brashear. The new lineup recorded the second and final Slint full-length album, Spiderland, in August of 1990 for release on Touch and Go Records in March of 1991. Though Spiderland proved a critical success and has subsequently been cited as influential to the math rock and post-rock genres, Slint disbanded months before its release. Since their initial dissolution, Slint has sporadically reunited to perform live, and has only released one additional recording, an untitled, two-track EP originally recorded in 1989 and released in 1994. The materials in this collection are gathered primarily from the 2013-14 reunion tour of North America and Europe, which featured the lineup of Brian McMahan, Britt Walford, David Pajo, Matt Jencik, and Christian Tonegawa. Spare materials in the collection also cover an earlier, 2005 reunion tour, which featured Brian McMahan, Britt Walford, David Pajo, Michael McMahan, and Todd Cook.
