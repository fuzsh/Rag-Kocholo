The Animal World is a 1956 documentary film that was produced, written and directed by Irwin Allen. The film includes live-action footage of animals throughout the world, along with a ten-minute stop motion animated sequence about dinosaurs.

Irwin's intention was to show the progression of life over time, although he noted, "We don't use the word 'evolution.' We hope to walk a very thin line. On one hand we want the scientists to say this film is right and accurate, and yet we don't want to have the church picketing the film."

Trivia[]

The Dinosaur sequence was featured in Stop Motion Animation, But they had animatronics for some of the close up shots.

Stock Footage Clips of The Animal World was used in a 1970 Film Trog, Since they couldn’t afford their own Dinosaur Sequence.

Shots of The Animal World was seen on view masters.

A few Shots of The Animal World on a view master at the beginning of “Jurassic World” “Jurassic Park 4” in 2015.

The fight between the Stegosaurus & the Ceratosaurus is a little similar to the animated sequence from “The Rite of Spring” in the 1940 Disney Film Fantasia. Except the Stegosaurus from Fantasia fought a T.Rex.
