        "text": "When I was boy, age 8-11, I remember being enthralled by a television show called Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. I even remember playing with a classic Bic pen, pretending it was the submarine Seaview.\n\nNow, 60 years later, I decided to watch the whole series again. Despite all its flaws (some of which I list below), some of the episodes are pretty good.\n\nWhat are the flaws? First and foremost, it is clear that Irwin Allen—the show’s creator—and many of his writers did not have a good understanding of basic science. Once you get past that, and the Seaview “popping wheelies“, the Seaview “rock-and-roll” incidents (camera is rocked as the cast rushes from side to side on the set, simulating the submarine being tossed around), the frequent on-board pyrotechnic fires, a circuitry room that begs for a more secure door and an armed guard, and the all-too-frequent “monster of the week” and “mind control” episodes, you’ll always find an excellent cast of regulars (led by Richard Basehart and David Hedison), talented guest stars, and some imaginative stories.\n\nSo here goes…\n\nBefore you watch the television series episodes, I recommend you watch two submarine-themed movies.\n\nThe Enemy Below (1957)\n\nThis is a great movie, and includes David Hedison (credited as Al Hedison as Lt. Ware of the USS Haynes) who would go on to play Captain Lee Crane in the Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea television series.\n\nVoyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961)\n\nThis is the Irwin Allen film that later launched the television series. Once you get past the scientific inaccuracies (the Van Allen Belts on fire??), there is an excellent cast featuring such luminaries as Walter Pidgeon, Joan Fontaine, the ever beautiful and alluring Barbara Eden (before I Dream of Jeannie), Peter Lorre, Robert Sterling, Michael Ansara (before his role as the Klingon Kang in Star Trek and who was married to Barbara Eden at the time!), Frankie Avalon, and Del Monroe as Seaman Kowski who would go on the play Seaman Kowalski in the television series.\n\nVoyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1964-1968)\n\nThe television series ran for four seasons. Here are my picks for the best episodes.\n\nSeason 1 (1964-1965)\n\nSeason 1, Episode 2: “The City Beneath the Sea”\n\nSeason 1, Episode 3: “The Fear-Makers”\n\nSeason 1, Episode 6: “The Sky Is Falling”\n\nSeason 1, Episode 7: “Turn Back the Clock”\n\nSeason 1, Episode 9: “Hot Line”\n\nDirected by John Brahm of Twilight Zone fame, and guests include James Doohan and Michael Ansara before Star Trek.\n\nSeason 1, Episode 10: “Submarine Sunk Here”\n\nSeason 1, Episode 11: “The Magnus Beam”\n\nGuests include Malachi Throne before his appearance on Star Trek.\n\nSeason 1, Episode 15: “Long Live the King”\n\nSeason 1, Episode 16: “Hail to the Chief”\n\nSeason 1, Episode 17: “The Last Battle”\n\nSeason 1, Episode 18: “Mutiny”\n\nSeason 1, Episode 19: “Doomsday”\n\nSeason 1, Episode 20: “The Invaders”\n\nSeason 1, Episode 23: “The Human Computer”\n\nSeason 1, Episode 28: “The Creature”\n\nSeason 2 (1965-1966)\n\nSeason 2, Episode 3: “…And Five of Us Are Left”\n\nSeason 2, Episode 10: “The Silent Saboteurs”\n\nGuests includes George Takei before Star Trek.\n\nSeason 2, Episode 15: “Killers of the Deep”\n\nGuests includes Michael Ansara before Star Trek.\n\nSeason 2, Episode 17: “The Phantom Strikes”\n\nSeason 2, Episode 22: “The Death Ship”\n\nSeason 2, Episode 26: “The Return of the Phantom”\n\nSeason 3 (1966-1967)\n\nSeason 3, Episode 5: “The Terrible Toys”\n\nSeason 3, Episode 13: “The Lost Bomb”\n\nSeason 3, Episode 19: “The Mermaid”\n\nSeason 3, Episode 23: “Doomsday Island”\n\nSeason 4 (1967-1968)\n\nSeason 4, Episode 3: “Cave of the Dead”\n\nGuest star Warren Stevens was also a guest on Star Trek later that year.\n\nSeason 4, Episode 5: “Sealed Orders”\n\nSeason 4, Episode 6: “Man of Many Faces”\n\nSeason 4, Episode 7: “Fatal Cargo”\n\nSeason 4, Episode 8: “Time Lock”\n\nSeason 4, Episode 9: “Rescue”\n\nSeason 4, Episode 24: “The Edge of Doom”\n\nSeason 4, Episode 26: “No Way Back”\n\nOf the 110 episodes of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea produced, I think that 33 of them (30%) are well worth watching. Season 1 was the only season filmed in black-and-white, and the only season that had 32 episodes instead of 26. It was also the best season, with 15 great episodes. The next best season was the fourth and final season with 8 great episodes, followed by Season 2 with 6 great episodes. Season 3 was the worst season with only 4 great episodes.\n\nEnjoy!"
