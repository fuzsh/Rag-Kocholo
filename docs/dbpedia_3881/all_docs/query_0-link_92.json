        "text": "WaterBear Network launches today supported by Jack Harries, Lily Cole, Maisie Williams and Dr Mya-Rose Craig\n\nBy WaterBear Network\n\n1 December 2020\n\nPioneering digital network empowers members to take direct action to support NGOs\n\nWaterBear Network Launch Video\n\nWaterBear Network, a new free, interactive video-on-demand platform dedicated to supporting life on earth, has today launched to a global audience of viewers who want to turn intention into action.\n\nPrince Harry, The Duke of Sussex was joined by WaterBear leaders Actress/Activist Lily Cole, Actress and environmental activist Maisie Williams and Mya-Rose Craig (Birdgirl) in celebrating the launch of the platform.\n\nWaterBear’s brand ambassadors have a combined reach of 25 million and will take an active role in creating content with the production team and be interviewed on WaterBear’s original interview series: The Bear Hug in 2021.\n\nNow live in eight countries around the world; the Netherlands, US, Canada, UK, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand; WaterBear is an innovative digital platform and mobile app with the goal of fundamentally changing the way people look at our world, love, care and engage with it. Encouraging its audience to engage with a world of constructive change based on three pillars: watch, join, take action.\n\nShowcasing award-winning documentaries, inspirational original content and live streaming, WaterBear collectively facilitates awareness, education and action. With original content and curated documentaries inspired by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), WaterBear members will now be able to stream hours of video at any time, and on any device - all for free.\n\nThe network democratises the journey from inspiration to education, connection and participation in making a difference. Its pioneering interactive technology enables viewers to watch content, while donating to WaterBear NGO partners, getting involved with the projects behind the featured films through advocacy or volunteering, or by booking sustainable travel. Throughout 2021 TVOD, PPV, Live, sustainable e-commerce and more Take Action features will be rolled out.\n\nWaterBear is working with incredible storytellers including filmmaker, activist and influencer Jack Harries ; producer, director and writer Tom Mustill; environmental journalist and The One Show’s Lucy Siegel and Emmy Award winner Nicolas Brown among many others. Addressing issues such as biodiversity, climate action, circularity and community.\n\nThe interactive network aims to re-imagine corporate responsibility - creating a unique ecosystem for impact. From storytelling to innovative technology, content creation and global partnerships it will help brands to fulfil their own SDG objectives and ultimately contribute to a brighter future for all.\n\nEntirely independent, Resilient Foundation works in partnership with WaterBear to help fund, produce and distribute high quality, data-driven and inspirational content in partnership with its growing network of NGOs. WaterBear and Resilient’s unique vision - backed by the might and experience of Off the Fence, ZDF-E and more - is to bring together three things: great storytelling; a global network of purpose-driven organisations; and technology that facilitates impact and action.\n\nWaterBear has acquired and produced a vast collection of high calibre content, setting the bar for how innovative storytelling can create awareness, motivate people and inspire action. The first WaterBear Original - Africa’s Hidden Seaforest (Swati Thiyagarajan) - a short film about facing our fears, mental health and natures’ healing powers, as well as carbon sequestration below the ocean is amongst a selection of original productions that will be available for global viewing after today’s launch. Anthropocene is a cinematic meditation on humanity’s massive reengineering of the planet, licensed to WaterBear by their partners ZDF Enterprises. With The Bear Hug, WaterBear will dip into interviews with impact, hosted by WaterBear’s Head of Strategy, Sam Sutaria.\n\nThe launch of this platform is now even more relevant as the world deals with the impacts of the coronavirus, which continues to set back many environmental and human rights initiatives. In these unprecedented times, people around the world are increasingly demanding change and the crisis presents an opportunity to build back a better world.\n\nLily Cole, WaterBear Leader said: “Story-telling has an absolutely critical role to play in helping guide and inspire us to address our collective environmental crises - so I was delighted to learn about WaterBear, and their dedication to creating and sharing powerful stories that will inspire, educate and connect us to the threats and opportunities facing our natural world. We need stories like this now more than ever.”\n\nMaisie Williams, WaterBear Leader said: \"I’m so excited to be a WaterBear Leader. This truly groundbreaking platform gives us the opportunity to familiarise ourselves with important, educational content focusing on the sustainability of our planet, empowering us to question the status quo and consider how we can contribute to permanent, effective change.The power to save our planet is in all of our hands, and WaterBear is handing us the tools. I am excited to be joining them on this journey to make further change by raising awareness for issues us and future generations face.”\n\nDr Mya-Rose Craig said, “ I' m very excited to join WaterBear as an ambassador. Being able to take immediate action after watching and engaging with content is exactly what the world needs right now and I couldn't be more excited to join a team striving to make a real difference.”\n\nJack Harries, environmentalist and activist said, “ Storytelling is the most powerful tool we have in our fight to tackle climate change and create a fairer, greener planet for all. As a filmmaker I have always looked for a platform that is dedicated solely to telling these stories. WaterBear represents a new type of media company, one that is dedicated to inspiring the next generation to find tangible sol utions to some of the most pressing issues of our time.”\n\nEllen Windemuth, CEO, WaterBear Network said : “Nothing matters more to me than training a young generation of talented storytellers to create more inspiration and excitement around those values that will give our children a better future. The best way to focus this network is on the UN SDGs – seventeen key values which already more than 193 countries have committed to together.\n\nVictor Eckard, Managing Director, WaterBear Network said: “WaterBear represents the collective vision of millions of people around the world that believe there is hope and that the future is full of opportunities to make the world a better place. At WaterBear we believe in collaboration, local and global partnerships, and using the power of inspirational storytelling, networking and technology to reach and inspire as many people around the world as possible to act (in a small or big way) to make a positive difference to the world we live in.”\n\nThe WaterBear Network is designed to galvanize the hard and dedicated work being done in the field by our world’s most effective NGOs - with top quality storytelling expertise from the documentary world. With this, we can share our impact universe with a global audience and engage each viewer with the cause they feel most passionately about.”\n\nSam Sutaria, Head of Strategy, WaterBear Network said : “This is the start of decades of action, and we firmly believe WaterBear can play a central role in the global fight for a sustainable future. We also believe in the power of good business, and its role to play as we face the challenges ahead. WaterBear is no exception. We are busy building and driving a sustainable business model that is uniquely designed to support a growing network of frontline champions and organizations.”\n\nAndrea Walji, Head of Content and Production said “At WaterBear, we will always keep impactful storytelling at the heart of all we do. We are delighted to welcome on board such high quality content creators: talented directors, producers, personalities, celebrities, influencers, scientists, journalists, and of course our valued NGO partners. And we are always looking to expand and build on our network of global filmmakers to keep adding content to the slate.”\n\nLisa Rose, Head of Impact, WaterBear Network said : “We are stubborn optimists at WaterBear - we’re focused on solutions and the simple, positive steps everyone can take to support them.

The day also reminds us of the urgent need to step up the fight against wildlife crime, which has wide-ranging economic, environmental and social impacts.\n\nSee the Full Feature here ...\n\nRecommended books for wildlife-lovers this Xmas:\n\nBack to Nature: How to Love Life - and Save It\n\nby Chris Packham and Megan McCubbin\n\nOne thing has become clear this year - we need nature more than ever. And it needs us too.\n\nFrom our balconies and gardens to our woodlands, national parks and beyond, Back to Nature captures the essence of how we feel about the wildlife outside our windows. Through personal stories, conservation breakthroughs and scientific discoveries, it explores the wonder and the solace of nature, and the ways in which we can connect with it - and protect it.\n\n‘Rousing, polemical and heartfelt’ – Gardens Illustrated\n\n‘An invitation to take action’ – The Observer\n\nBack to Nature celebrates the bond with wildlife that many formed for the first time while confined at home this spring, but also explains the biodiversity crisis and examines contributors to this great wave of extinctions – from salmon farming and pesticides to the persecution of hen harriers. It is well-researched – with McCubbin providing short scientific interludes – and more nuanced than you might expect from Packham’s many Twitter rants. Is he becoming more diplomatic in old age? “No, I’m getting more strategic,” he says. “I got very angry this afternoon about the Japanese restarting whaling. I don’t blame the Japanese, I blame the world’s conservationists for letting them do it. They just said, ‘Er, that’s not a very good idea at all.’ And then nothing happened. It’s our fault. I still get very angry. There’s no dulling of the blade. The blade if anything is getting sharper and more useful because I’m running out of time. There’s less time in my lifetime to make a difference.” Patrick Barkham\n\nBack To Nature by Chris Packham & Megan McCubbin\n\nAvailable from Bookdepository.com with FREE delivery worldwide.\n\nAlso: Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.com\n\nHope in Hell : A decade to confront the climate emergency\n\nby Jonathon Porritt\n\nClimate change is the defining issue of our time - we know, beyond reasonable doubt, what that science now tells us. Just as climate change is accelerating, so too must we - summoning up a greater sense of urgency, courage and shared endeavour than humankind has ever seen before.\n\nThe Age of Climate Change is an age of superlatives: most extreme this, biggest that, most costly ever. The impacts worsen every year, played out in people's backyards and communities, and more and more people around the world now realise this is going to be a massive challenge for the rest of their lives. In Hope in Hell, Porritt confronts that dilemma head on. He believes we have time to do what needs to be done, but only if we move now - and move together. In this ultimately optimistic book, he explores all these reasons to be hopeful: new technology; the power of innovation; the mobilisation of young people - and a sense of intergenerational solidarity as older generations come to understand their own obligation to secure a safer world for their children and grandchildren.\n\n'Brave and unflinching in setting out the reality of the hell towards which we're headed, but even more urgent, passionate and compelling about the grounds for hope if we change course fast enough, Hope in Hell is a powerful call to arms from one of Britain's most eloquent and trusted campaigners.' Caroline Lucas, MP\n\n'Extraordinarily powerful, deeply troubling, scathing but ultimately purposeful and hopeful. This book is a clarion call to action, and action now. After reading this, we know for sure that nothing, not even a pandemic, must divert us from the most serious problem facing every living creature on the planet. In plain language, Jonathon Porritt is spelling it out. This is our last chance. Read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest. Then act.'

Only six percent of our country is built upon. Contrary to popular myth, large areas of our countryside are not productively farmed but remain deserts of opportunity for both wildlife and jobs. It is time to turn things around. Praised as ‘visionary' by conservationists and landowners alike, Rebirding sets out a compelling manifesto for restoring Britain's wildlife, rewilding its species and restoring rural jobs – to the benefit of all.\n\n'A wonderful book, visionary, illuminating and fascinating. – George Monbiot\n\nThe book is available at Bookdepository.com with FREE delivery worldwide.\n\nAlso: Amazon.co.uk & Amazon.com\n\nLiving Without Plastic: More Than 100 Easy Swaps for Home, Travel, Dining, Holidays, and Beyond\n\nby Brigette Allen\n\nA New Book Offering Over 100 Ways You Can Replace Plastic In Your Life\n\nPlastic Oceans International, a global nonprofit working to end plastic pollution, joins Artisan Books in announcing today (Nov 10th 2020) the publication of Living Without Plastic, from authors Christine Wong and Brigette Allen.\n\nThis new book serves as a concise guide on how to easily embrace a plastic-free or plastic-reduced lifestyle. It offers over 100 simple, sustainable, and stylish swaps throughout our households, providing readers with plastic alternatives for everything from kitchen and dining, to health, beauty, travel, and beyond.\n\n“Brigette and I wanted to share how to break up with plastic in fun, accessible ways,” said Wong, a renowned Instagram foodie who advocates for zero-waste consumption and eco-friendly choices within the kitchen and home. “Every piece of plastic not used is a step in the right direction, and through our collective action, together we can make a difference!”\n\nPlastic is an invention created to improve our lives, from innovations in food safety and product transit to medical sanitation and convenience in our homes. Unfortunately, our dependence on plastic is now wreaking havoc on our environment, and a growing body of science is showing that it is also invading our human bodies through the food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we drink and the soil we cultivate.\n\n“It’s an issue that we can no longer ignore. As easy as we have each contributed to the plastic pollution problem, we can now contribute to solving it by implementing alternatives to the everyday plastics we use,” said Julie Andersen, CEO of Plastic Oceans International and author of the book’s foreword. “This is the perfect guide for doing exactly that.”\n\nIn addition to presenting real-life solutions, Living Without Plastic also provides accessible information in understanding the history and implications of our plastic use.\n\nThe book is available at Bookdepository.com with FREE delivery worldwide.\n\nAlso: Amazon.co.uk\n\nCenter for Environmental Filmmaking News - October '20\n\nBy Maggie Burnette Stogner\n\n8 October 2020\n\nIn the midst of these chaotic, uncertain times, there is one clear path forward: creating caring communities, building resilience and hope together, and embracing solutions that work for everyone in order to forge a path for a better future.\n\nAt the virtual 2020 Jackson Wild Summit this past week, filmmakers, conservationists, impact strategists, and distributors from around the world converged to set a course for equitable, high impact media production and distribution.\n\nOur film “Unbreathable - The Fight For Healthy Air” continues to be a catalyst for environmental justice and community engagement.

This artful exploration of some of America’s most incredible species promotes a deeper understanding of our link to the wild at a time when its future is uncertain.\n\nAlthough they can seem far removed from our lives we have an innate connection to the animals we share the Earth with. The relationship between us is complex, ever changing, and unique to each species. The Wild Connection seeks to understand the link between us at a time when the future is uncertain.\n\nIt is an oft-said thing by those that are engaged with wildlife, in natural history or ecological circles, be they biologists, birders, conservationists or even mere film-makers, that we’ve lost our connection to the natural world. By “we”, we mean everyone else. Those city types, kids of today and the like ... Increasingly losing touch with nature. So, I was immediately invested in the idea behind this film. Can “we” reconnect?\n\nThis documentary aims to show us inadvertent connections at various sites across the USA ... Antelope Island, Utah, where herds of large mammals roam the mountainsides and grasslands and its shores are home to millions of animals but where the early impact of people on American wildlife is illustrated; Crystal River, on the Nature Coast of Florida, where species collide as the large populations of both humans and animals intersect, often with deadly but unintended consequences. There are great success stories but protected species are still under serious pressure, and not just from people, there are invasive species adding to that pressure exacerbated by climate change too; Palo Duro Canyon, located in the Texas Panhandle, is the second largest canyon in the United States. Its’ unique topography creates a climate that offers shelter to wildlife year round. Human-introduced invasive species are also a problem here and massive persecutions of rattlesnakes are unethical, whilst upsetting the balance too. The plight of turkeys and that of cattle, including their impact on the environment are shown ... One billion cows, in the US alone, are seriously contributing to global warming; Baxter, Maine, a testament to conservation that remains largely untouched, despite being a pristine wilderness the animals here are still affected by human activity miles away. An aquatic animal, a conservation success story, that shows the ecosystem is healthy and the surprisingly aquatic moose that is plagued by insects that are exploding in numbers further North due to climate change; Okefenokee Swamp, Georgia, which may seem like a foreboding place, but is full of life. In the black waters of the Okefenokee nature is on full display. Charismatic keystone species are suffering due to hunting, loss of habitat and human development and alligators are impacted by climate change in surprising ways. Even more surprising interconnections link a woodpecker, pine trees and fire, or lack of it.\n\nThe cinematography is exceptional in this film, well edited and good flow with appealing graphics used to illustrate historical points and data. An appropriate use of music nicely balanced with natural sounds with a well-paced narration that helped to keep the attention, even though the film could’ve been shorter.\n\nI found the film incredibly informative, with lots of things learnt about the animals and environments studied, not least the interconnectedness of threats to wildlife in the US and climate change. It felt like a well-researched film but the imparted knowledge was easily digested. I loved the inclusion of the segment on cattle, the cruelty injustices, exploited for meat and dairy products, but also their very significant negative impact on the environment. Not preachy, but part of a wider story including their auroch ancestors. Well done and I would very much like to see more of this kind of truth-telling in wildlife film-making.\n\nThe points made about the “wild connection” were immersed in the wider biology of the animals and ecosystems helping the viewer to understand the fuller context with ease. There’s still a chance for all of these animals and their ecosystems ... Our connection to the wild.\n\n“We” need to remember our shared history, remember our relationship to the land and animals ... realize past mistakes and recognize what we are doing now. We have a chance to modify and reduce our impact as humans on the natural world ... i.e. live in a way mindful of our wild connection. I recommend that you watch this film, immerse yourself in the stories, understand the connections and then find your wild connection, not just to these stories, but in your local patch too. By “we”, I mean all of us.\n\nThe Wild Connection – Official Trailer (2020)\n\nThe film is available to watch on Vimeo (rent or buy) and Amazon Prime Video (rent, buy or stream).\n\nVisit: thewildconnection.com\n\nFollow: facebook.com/habitatproductions & instagram.com/habitatproductions\n\nFilm-maker Bios:\n\nCarter McCormick is from Rising Fawn, Georgia where he gained a deep love for wildlife. He began his filmmaking career in 2008 and his passion for film and conservation have taken him to wildernesses around the globe. Carter has collaborated with many prestigious research organizations, conservation groups, universities, and NGOs.\n\nPaula Sprenger was born in Santiago, Chile and worked to achieve her dream of being a filmmaker since she was a child. Throughout her childhood Paula always had a camera in hand, and her career took a turn when she became successful in fashion photography and portraiture.\n\nEventually, when Carter and Paula met in college in 2015 they began working in film together. Two years after meeting the couple got married, and they set off in their RV to travel across the USA to film 'The Wild Connection'.\n\nToday they live in Ireland where they continue to document wildlife. The two maintain their company Habitat Productions while Carter researches creating more impactful wildlife films for his PhD.\n\nStatement from the Filmmakers:\n\nMany wildlife films, though captivating, seldom impart knowledge in a way that can change how a viewer engages with the world around them. With The Wild Connection, we set out to create a film that was artful and entertaining but that also examined our relationship with wildlife in a way that promoted deeper understanding and empathy. Making this film we navigated sweltering heat waves off-grid in our RV, filled our wetsuits with hot water on cold winter mornings, walked rough terrain with heavy gear in search of wildlife, and faced a multitude of other obstacles. Despite all of the challenges of making a documentary (especially with only two people) every day in the field or working from home was a labor of love. Making this film only furthered our love for the land, plants, and animals we share this planet with and we hope that you share that love when watching our film.\n\nSee the Full Feature here...\n\nWildlife Film Festival Rotterdam 2020 Nominees Announced!\n\nBy Jason Peters\n\n7 October 2020\n\nWFFR is delighted to announce the complete list of nominees selected for the WFFR 2020 Flamingo Awards.

Only once does it return to fresh waters – to give offspring, start the circle of life, and die. These salmons form an inexhaustible resource that feeds billions of people on the planet, a resource that is restored every single year. But soon, we may find ourselves facing the unimaginable: humans will exhaust the inexhaustible…\n\nBest Short:\n\nHow to Save Our Planet\n\nHow to Save Our Planet\n\nJonnie Hughes, Colin Butfield & Keith Scholey\n\nUK\n\nHow do we create a future in which both people and nature can thrive?

The film reveals how scientists spotted the giant hole in the stratosphere and persuaded Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher – two of the most unlikely eco-warriors in history – to take action. Had they not acted, humans would’ve been forced to hide from daylight and become a nocturnal species. Human actions solved the first great man-made threat to the planet’s environment. As climate change begins to feel like an impossible challenge, the forgotten tale of the hole in the ozone layer offers a timely message of hope.\n\nHow to Save Our Planet\n\nJonnie Hughes, Colin Butfield & Keith Scholey\n\nUK\n\nEver Slow Green - Trailer\n\nEver Slow Green\n\nChristoph Pohl\n\nIndia\n\nFifty years ago, a unique afforestation project took root on an eroded desert plateau in Tamil Nadu, South India, when people from diverse countries came together to establish the international experimental township of Auroville.

Yet, if they are to survive, it’s important to learn. For three years, award-winning cameraman Jacky Poon and his team have had unprecedented access to the Qin Mountains and the Woolong Panda breeding centre. In the centre, we follow a young panda from birth, that is later selected to return to the wild.

We talk to farmers, scientists, chefs and academics along the way to give a broad perspective about the threats to honey bees, what it means to our food security and how we can improve it.\n\nOn Thin Ice\n\nHenry M. Mix & Boas Schwarz (Altayfilm GmbH)\n\nGermany\n\nThe Kingdom: How fungi made our world - Trailer\n\nThe Kingdom: How fungi made our world\n\nAnnamaria Talas & Simon Nasht, Anne Pick, Susan Mackinnon, Bill Spahic Austria\n\nSince the dawn of life, fungi have driven evolution and ruled all life on land, making them both powerful allies and, given the chance, formidable foes. The Kingdom of Fungi is an alien world with the largest and oldest organisms alive. Fungi made life possible on a barren planet and brought life back to Earth after the last mass extinction. By looking at fungi in the context of evolution and natural history, scientists are making discoveries that will change our lives. Some fungi will save us, others will threaten us and we are just beginning to understand which is which.\n\nVan Lawick Conservation:\n\nSockeye Salmon Red Fish\n\nDmitriy Shpilenok, Vladislav Grishin, Petr Shpilenok & Anna Sukhova\n\nRussia\n\nThe Tiger Mafia - Trailer\n\nThe Tiger Mafia\n\nKarl Ammann, Laurin Merz Switzerland\n\nThe magnificent tiger is one of the world’s most beloved, and threatened creatures.

Their leader is a silverback called “Musiru”, distinguished by his rusty red forehead. These aren’t the famous mountain gorillas of East Africa made famous by Dian Fossey – they’re the western lowland variety seldom seen by humans. Gabon’s gorillas have survived logging, poaching and even the Ebola virus, and now the future of the region’s wildlife conservation could be resting on their shoulders.

OceanXplorers, produced by BBC Studios’ Natural History Unit with OceanX Media, is a global cross-platform television event that will bring to life the magical worlds of our oceans across six ambitious episodes. Secrets of the Whales is a four-part natural history series for National Geographic from Red Rock Films. Filmed across three years in 24 locations, the series ventures deep into the world of whales to reveal life and love from their perspective.\n\nAt the world's leading international nature film festival’s biannual event in October, Cameron will reveal why he’s so passionate about our oceans and what drives him to explore them. Doherty will also quiz the moviemaking maestro about his love of adventure, science and technology, about the evolution of natural history documentary filmmaking and about the environmental themes that lie behind much of his storytelling.\n\nCameron has a longstanding relationship with National Geographic. As part of the Deepsea Challenge expedition, and in partnership with National Geographic, he famously made a record-breaking solo dive to the Mariana Trench’s Challenger Deep in a custom-built submersible that he co-designed.\n\nHe’s been a National Geographic ‘Explorer at Large’ for nine years and has also executive produced Akashinga: The Brave Ones, the story of a team of women-only rangers and their fight to protect some of Africa’s key species from poaching in Zimbabwe. The short film, winner of two Jackson Wild awards among others, will receive a special screening at Wildscreen.\n\nJames Cameron said: “I feel very much at home in the natural history film-making community, so I’m pleased to be joining everyone at Wildscreen to share some of my personal experiences working in the field. The oceans-related projects I’m producing all share elements I love – new tech used for scientific inquiry wrapped in great storytelling that visually excites and emotionally resonates. I’m proud to work with my longtime partner, National Geographic, as well as BBC Studios’ Natural History Unit, to bring viewers incredible and surprising new insights into our oceans and the rich and abundant life we need to protect and preserve.”\n\nBBC Studios Natural History Unit producer Orla Doherty commented: “This is a rare and exciting opportunity to hear from one of the world’s best storytellers and film-making visionaries on his feature films and documentaries about our natural world. I’m eager to hear about what motivates him as a natural history filmmaker and where he sees tech and innovation taking us both as messengers and as residents of a fast-changing planet.”\n\nSue Martineau, interim CEO Wildscreen added: \"We are honoured and delighted to have James Cameron the 'world's most successful director' appearing at Wildscreen Festival 2020. We know that he will appeal to an extremely diverse and varied audience.

Red fish / 2020 SHPILENOKFILM\n\nWinner: Sockeye Salmon Red Fish\n\nSHPILENOK FILM, Russian Federation\n\nDirected by Dmitriy Shpilenok, Vladislav Grishin\n\nSockeye, a species of wild salmon, is born in Kamchatkan waters and spends its entire life in the Pacific Ocean. Only once does it return to fresh waters - to give offspring, start the circle of life, and die. It is an inexhaustible resource that feeds billions of people on the planet, restored every year! But soon, we may find ourselves facing the unimaginable: humans will exhaust the inexhaustible!\n\n\"Sockeye Salmon. Red Fish” is finished thirteen years after I first had the idea to tell the story of Kamchatka’s wild salmon. Wild salmon are a perpetual engine, feeding billions of people on this planet.\n\nIn 2007, I arrived in the Kamchatkan wildlife sanctuary, with plans to shoot the film. I soon learned that shooting in those conditions was impossible. The scale of the poaching on Kurile Lake shocked me. Every night, poaching groups poached over 700 kilos of sockeye caviar! It was dangerous to be near the significant areas. With this new knowledge, the idea to film a movie about salmon, right next to those who were illegally eradicating seemed overly bold. I had to put away the camera for a couple of years, and join the task force that fought poaching.\n\nBut poaching is not the only thing that threatens the consistent return of wild salmon. The fish are threatened by construction of gas pipelines, dams, and mines, as well as biased overestimation of the region’s safe fishing capacity. In Kamchatka and other regions relying on fish, fish is the basis of all commerce, an inexhaustible source of income and great temptation! These sorts of places attract people and fuel their greed. The great risk is that in their pursuit of profit everything will be irrevocably lost: fish and hundreds of other animals, in addition to the utopian corners of our planet that they live in. The film “Sockeye Salmon. Red Fish” is about the wild salmon of Kamchatka - but it’s only one illustration of a worldwide problem. In the USA and Japan, schools of wild salmon are also under threat. Experience of restoring wild salmon in American, Japanese and Canadian rivers, has shown that expenses greatly outreach their results. The only way to save wild salmon is to stop it’s natural numbers from dwindling.\n\nIt is imperative that the movie “Sockeye Salmon. Red fish” is seen by as many people as possible, especially those that are able to influence the decisions made about the extraction of natural resources. This movie has the ability to attract the attention of the public to places that are too tempting for industry, businesses, and poaching. We need to speak about these places as much as possible, spread their beauty, so that society itself stands as defense against businessmen who aren’t interested in our future, only profit.\" Dmitriy Shpilenok, the director and main camera operator\n\nFinalists:\n\nEdge of Existence Trailer\n\nEdge of Existence\n\nBlack Bean, South Africa\n\nDirected by James Suter, Charlie Luckock\n\nThe Edge of Existence is a long-format documentary, set in the Western Corridor of the Serengeti, that sets out to uncover and document the untold story of human-wildlife conflict in Africa. Human-wildlife conflict is a global issue that has reached crisis levels, threatening the survival of both humans and wild animals. There are communities living alongside wildlife in some of the last remaining wilderness areas on earth. These wilderness areas have started disappearing because of expanding human development, deforestation, and depletion of natural resources, which has left humans and wildlife living in closer proximity than ever before. The conflict arises as a result of the competition for limited space and resources between communities and wildlife. The situation is dire, and if it is not addressed urgently, it will have a catastrophic effect on the environment and on communities that live alongside wild animals daily.\n\nThe Lost Kings of Bioko | Trailer\n\nLost Kings of BiokoGulo Film Productions, Germany\n\nDirected by Oliver Goetzl\n\nOff the coast of Central Africa lies an isolated island, covered by primeval rainforest and surrounded by dark ocean waters, inhabited by a greater variety of species than nearly any other place on Earth this terra incognita is called BIOKO. The ruler of this realm is one of the world's least known primate species, the drill. Historically revered, indigenous folklore tells us of a drill king who ruled the island’s forests, a place where drills still play a critical role in the health of an ecosystem known to scientists as a biodiversity hotspot. Bordering this kingdom is the black sand coastline, an ancient nesting ground for giant sea turtles and home to natural wonders. This film explores the secret lives of drills and their mysterious island home as we follow a family group and a newborn who discovers this tropical paradise with all its challenges for the first time.\n\nBest Short Film\n\n© Beyond The Fence\n\nWinner: Beyond The Fence\n\nIndependent film-maker, South Africa\n\nDirected by Tessa Barlin\n\nGrowing up in rural South Africa means being born in a country so rich in wildlife that foreigners can only dream of, and yet never being given the chance to fully experience the beauty of it for yourself. But Queen, Rifumo and Wisani have set out the change this. Armed with a camera, the trio aim to rise above their difficult pasts and “reframe” the narrative of wildlife conservation, which has long since had a reputation for being white dominated. Queen becomes one of the only black female field guides in South Africa while Rifumo and Wisani start a business together. The trio have one goal - to inspire the youth from their community to become the next generation of eco-warriors.\n\nQueen, Rifumo and Wisani are all graduates of the Wild Shots Outreach program - an organisation founded by British conservationist, Mike Kendrick. Mike believes that exposure to wildlife is the key to inspiring children from disadvantaged communities to become involved in conservation, and that this exposure needs to be paired with opportunity. The trio have each embraced this movement with overwhelming dedication, and are taking wildlife conservation to new heights. Beyond The Fence looks at the inspiring stories of each of our characters, from their challenging pasts to their inspiring outlooks on life and how photography has changed their lives.\n\nWith an aim to shift perspectives, the audience is probed to revisit their own ideas of what it means to do conservation in this day and age. The real question is, how can people care for nature when they don’t even have access to it? And how can they not have access to it when they live right on the park’s doorstep? This is the story of what happens when you give someone a chance.\n\n\"Having my directing debut on a film so close to my heart has truly been a dream come true. It was at a highly prestigious Natural History Awards Night in the UK last year where a friend of mine said to me, \"So I take it you're more into conservation than Blue Chip?\" And it was at that moment when it all made sense to me - the answer had always been clear in my mind. That there is in fact a difference between the two, and if we continue to show Blue Chip series on television while ignoring human-interest stories of conservation, then we stand at risk of losing all our wild spaces altogether. If we don't tell stories that make an impact, then soon we will no longer have a subject to film for our Blue Chip series. I grew up watching the likes National Geographic and Discovery Channel at home. I have always had an ineffable passion for nature and wildlife. I have always had the privilege of visiting the Kruger National Park and other private game reserves with my family. When I realised that it was my privilege that afforded me these opportunities, and that the majority of South Africans may live their entire lives without ever getting to see even a zebra, I knew something had to change, and that I had to be the one to help drive this change. My hope for Beyond The Fence is to touch audiences on a deeply emotive level, of course. But more than that, I'd like to help start conversations. We are at an absolutely critical point in history. We are the only generation to have so much scientific knowledge about our natural world, and we are the last generation to be able to save it from a total, irreversible collapse. Our conservation methods are exclusive and outdated, and if we are to turn this ship around, we need all hands on board. I think it's clear that what we need now more than ever is to reconnect to our natural heritage and to the one and only planet we call home.\" Tessa Barlin, Director\n\nFinalists:\n\nThose in Grass Houses - Trailer 2020\n\nThose In Grass Houses\n\nStudent film-maker, United Kingdom\n\nDirected by Christian Lawes\n\nSociable Weavers engineer the biggest nest built by any bird.

With almost 300 bird species, over 1,000 plant species, and dozens of large and small mammals, Nyungwe is one of the most biodiverse places in the world. Twenty-five years after the devastation of the Rwandan Civil War, the park is now one of the best-conserved montane rainforests in Central Africa. As Claver walks through the forest we uncover the origins of his conservation values and the history of an ecosystem that survived one of Rwanda's darkest periods.\n\n\"I am an MFA student at Montana State University.

This film tells the story of mothers and babies, showing how they learn to survive in this harsh environment. Sandstone ridges and pinnacles shape the habitat which is characterised by a dry season with temperatures higher than forty degrees and almost no rain. It is not easy to find water and fresh fruit and these monkeys must rely on all their ingenuity and remarkable skills to survive here. If they want to become independent, youngsters must learn the strategies of their group: hunting, finding water, digging the ground to extract roots and eventually using stone tools to crack open the palm nuts, their favourite food. Capuchins' success is the result of their intelligence, high adaptability and their effective survival strategies. These techniques and behaviours are transmitted to the offspring and represent their own culture, traditions passed across the generations to face the challenges of the Brazilian wilderness.\n\n\"“Capuchin Culture” is a student film based on the latest discoveries on capuchin monkeys’ behavioural traditions and it tackles the emerging debate of preserving animal culture. Traditions can have important consequences for the survival of animal populations and this has implications for global conservation.\n\nI made this production as a filmmaker and as a biologist with expertise on the behaviour of capuchin monkeys. In 2014, for my Master's thesis in biology, I spent three months in the field site of Fazenda Boa Vista (Piauí, Brazil) to investigate the foraging strategies of a population of wild capuchins. These monkeys learn to crack open very hard palm nuts using stone tools and this strategy is one of the most complex forms of tool use in nature, putting capuchins on a par with chimpanzees and humans.\n\nFazenda Boa Vista is one of the few locations in which capuchin monkeys use tools to crack palm nuts. This behaviour is passed across the generations and it is one of the cultural traits of this population. The researchers of the EthoCebus Project have investigated the social influences on the acquisition of stone tool use and the threat to capuchins’ culture due to human impact. Recently, it has been argued that the presence of humans has eroded the diversity of chimpanzee culture and that conservation needs to preserve animal traditions as well as bodies and genes. Other species, such as capuchins, are also likely losing their ancestral knowledge at our hands.\n\nTherefore, in 2019, I decided to come back to Brazil to film capuchins’ most intimate and outstanding behaviours, showing how youngsters learn the survival strategies thanks to their group members. Although the film was “very low budget” production, I still managed to succeed in carrying out all its phases and getting the results I wanted. I aimed to make an accurate and entertaining documentary and raise people awareness on the importance of protecting this population of monkeys and its invaluable cultural heritage. \" Luca Antonio Marino, director, producer\n\nWildlife-film.com congratulates all of the finalsists and winners.\n\nWe would like to recommend two of the Selected Films:\n\n“RODENTS OF UNUSUAL SIZE” - US Theatrical Trailer\n\nRodents of Unusual Size\n\nTilapia Film, USA\n\nDirected by Chris Metzler, Jeff Springer & Quinn Costello\n\nIt is a brilliant film, a heady mix of human/wildlife conflict of an unexpected kind, pest control on a grand scale, unlikely pets, bounty hunting, rodent cuisine and climate change.

Hoping to discover what potential impacts the reintroduction of missing predators might have, they took inspiration from an icon of the rewilding movement. They named the experiment Project Wolf. By using its very own ‘human wolf pack’, the charity hopes to discover what impact the presence of pursuit predators may have on the deer population and, in turn, the landscape. This short documentary joins the human wolf pack on their patrol, and explores how rewilding is not just about reintroducing large predators, but also changing whole landscapes and reconnecting ourselves with nature.\n\n\"Originally from Aberdeenshire Scotland, I was brought up with a love for wildlife. When studying MA Anthropology joint with Film and Visual Culture at the Unviersity of Aberdeen, I started to think more about how our worlds overlap and wanted nothing more than to make films about it. I relocated to Bristol to do a postgraduate in Documentary at UWE and started doing just that. I self-shot my first short film, 'Red Sky on the Black Isle', that went on to show around the world in film festivals and scientific conferences, win an award and be translated into 3 different languages. Since then I have started working full time as a videographer and crowdfunded my latest half hour documentary film, 'Project Wolf', a half hour documentary on rewilding which is available to watch online for free in full. I researched, developed, filmed and edited both of these films along with many more.

Now, for the first time he reflects upon both the defining moments of his lifetime as a naturalist and the devastating changes he has seen. Honest, revealing and urgent, David Attenborough: A Life On Our Planet is a powerful first-hand account of humanity’s impact on nature and a message of hope for future generations.\n\nThe film, which serves as Attenborough’s witness statement for the natural world, will screen in select cinemas across the UK, the Netherlands, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Australia and New Zealand, before being released widely to theatres in those territories. Tickets are on sale now.\n\nAudiences watching Attenborough’s story on the big screen will have the unique chance to watch an exclusive conversation between Sir David Attenborough and Sir Michael Palin. This will be available in cinemas only. The legendary broadcasters share a passion for exploring our vast planet and a desire to protect it for future generations.\n\nThe film has been created by award-winning natural history filmmakers Silverback Films and global environmental organisation WWF. The film will launch on Netflix globally this autumn.\n\nFilm-makers:\n\nNarrator: Sir Dacid Attenborough\n\nDirected by: Alastair Fothergill, Jonnie Hughes, Keith Scholey\n\nProducer: Jonnie Hughes\n\nExecutive Producers: Colin Butfield, Alastair Fothergill, Keith Scholey\n\nOriginal Music by: Steven Price\n\nEditor: Martin Elsbury\n\nDirector of Photography: Gavin Thurston\n\nFilm-maker’s Statements:\n\n“For decades, David has brought the natural world to the homes of audiences worldwide, but there has never been a more significant moment for him to share his own story and reflections. This film comes at a monumental time in humankind’s history when world leaders make critical decisions on nature and climate. It sends a powerful message from the most inspiring and celebrated naturalist of our time.” Colin Butfield, Executive Producer\n\n“I’ve worked with David on many projects throughout my career, but to collaborate on this film, which is so important at this time, has been a real privilege. At 94 years old, his knowledge and insight of the natural world remains as relevant and cherished today as it was the first time he introduced the British public to pangolins and sloths on television. “As we rebuild from the pandemic, Sir David’s reflections and messages of hope feel particularly timely and relevant. He not only addresses why we must urgently mend our relationship with nature, but also offers solutions to ensuring a safe and sustainable future for our planet and its people.” Keith Scholey, Director & Executive Producer\n\nThroughout his career, Sir David Attenborough has made hundreds of hours of iconic television, yet A Life on Our Planet is his first feature film. Why did he choose this film to make the move to the big screen, and why now? The film’s producer-director, Jonnie Hughes, explains its genesis. David has witnessed a serious decline in the living world over his lifetime. He has seen the rainforests retreating and the grasslands emptying, and has searched ever harder for species hanging on in hidden corners of the world. He’s observed a downward trend that is set to cause a disaster far more profound and with more lasting impacts than the desolation of Chernobyl – a decline that will have a more limited impact on his life, but will come to define the lives of all those who follow him. He is dedicated to lending his considerable profile to efforts to halt and then reverse this decline, and he’s in a good place to do so.\n\n“Saving our planet is no longer a technological problem, it’s a communications challenge,” David has said on several important stages. To bring about the wholesale change required to transition to a sustainable existence on Earth, we all need to hear a new story – a positive, inspiring one in which we take control of our impact and aspire to a future in balance with nature. A key component of David’s efforts to assist in this great communications challenge is this film.\n\nIn 2014, when we at Silverback Films were working with both WWF and David on the Netflix series Our Planet, WWF calculated that populations of wild animals had declined on average by more than half since 1970. This shocking statistic made real the steady dismantling of the living world that David had become increasingly aware of throughout his career. It quantified the terrifying extent of our impact and qualified that, in addition to climate change, a second red warning light was now flashing on the dashboard of Earth – ‘biodiversity loss’.\n\nIt also made us all decide we urgently needed to make a single film that broadcast this biodiversity crisis far and wide – David’s witness statement and his vision for the future – a personal account of a story that involves us all.\n\nDavid is clearly troubled by the vision he has. He knows what happens next. We humans will, accidentally, clumsily, destabilise nature. We’ll tip the world into a sixth mass extinction. Nature, our life-support machine, will seize up. We are, it is suddenly clear, involved in an act of self-destruction.\n\nUnless we build a new kind of life on our planet.\n\nAnd David’s here to tell us how.\n\nStatement from Sir David Attenborough about the COVID-19 pandemic and tackling the Climate and Nature Crisis:\n\n“The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and will continue to cause, immense suffering. If there is hope that can come out of it then that may arise from the whole world having experienced a shared threat and found a sense that we are all in it together. The same unique brains and communication skills that fuelled the development of our civilisations now have access to technologies and institutions that allow all nations of the world to collaborate and cooperate should we choose to do so. “The time for pure national interests has passed. If we are to tackle climate change, enable sustainable development and restore biodiversity, then internationalism has to be our approach. In doing so, we must bring about a greater equality between what nations take from the world and what they give back. The wealthier nations have taken a lot and the time has now come to give.”\n\nDavid Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet | Official Trailer | Netflix\n\nThe film starts out with David Attenborough in Chernobyl, where he makes a comparison to what happened there following a nuclear disaster to what could happen everywhere should we not heed the many warnings being presented to us now.\n\nHe speaks earnestly to camera \"I am David Attenborough and I’m 93. This is my witness statement.” The film goes on to look back at Sir David's long career as a broadcaster, that is more than sixty years, over which time he has seen incredible and alarming changes in the natural world.\n\nThe tone and mood of the film is serious and sombre, with David delivering stark facts alongside the beautiful imagery. The message is clear: Time is running out for Our Planet. Perhaps it would be better to say The Planet, as it doesn't belong to us, as a species, we merely inhabit this planet but have learnt to exploit it on a grand scale, very much to its' detriment.\n\nThe film feels very personal, hard-hitting too. David's oh so familiar, reassuring voice has emotion it it when talking about the issues facing us and the planet. Facts and figures are presented in a very clear and convincing way. There can be no denying.\n\nHe says things like \"If we take care of nature, nature will take care of us\" and \"We need to rediscover how to be sustainable\".\n\nHe also speak about our over-consumption of animal products saying \"Large carnivores are rare in nature because it takes a lot of prey to support each of them. The planet can't support billions of large meat eaters ... there just isn’t the space. If we all had a largely plant-based diet, we would need only half the land we use at the moment.\"\n\nAnd he said much else ... Listen!\n\nEveryone should watch this film and take serious note of David Attenborough's warnings of where we are heading unless we take decisive action now. The climate emergency is very real and we cannot in good conscience ignore it, for each and every one of our own personal actions impact on the future of the planet that we live on. We must do far, far better.\n\nThis is a very important film. The most important film ever made by David Attenborough in my opinion. But, we all need to listen, and act on what this very respected and knowing elder man is saying. There can be no excuses not to.\n\nAm happy to see that he is still hopeful.\n\nVisit: www.attenborough.film\n\nTwitter: @DavidALifeFilm\n\nInstagram @davidalifefilm\n\nFacebook/DavidALifeFilm\n\n#AttenboroughFilm\n\nDavid Attenborough has started his own Instagram accont: @davidattenborough ... reportedly, this account was the fastest to reach one milllion followers in Instagram's history...

Among the hundred or so documentaries viewed, 36 films and 10 short films will be screened during the festival, plus two films out of competition.\n\nHave the constraints of the Covid for the next edition of the festival changed your criteria for choosing the number of films to present, the preferred format?\n\nNot at all! The screenings will be organized differently, with more, but shorter screenings. To complete the offer, we are studying the possibility of decentralizing certain sessions to two or three neighboring municipalities. This project is under advanced discussion, we will seek production approval and then we will settle the logistical aspects.\n\nWhich format dominates?\n\nThe 52 minutes, due to television sales. This is why, for the selection of short (15 minutes maximum), the selectors of the short format2 do not content themselves with the films they receive, but apply for masters and seek nuggets on Vimeo or at other festivals. We have not yet received any animated films this year, although we are not closed to them.\n\nWhat proportion of French and foreign films this year?\n\nThere is a great diversity of countries represented - 13 nationalities are represented - with a newcomer like Georgia and the return of Iran with a film on the Iranian cheetah.\n\nStriking views? Nuggets?\n\nPatrick Luneau: Generally speaking, this year I noticed more originality in the way of approaching the subjects, and I was seduced by a French film, Amnesia of nature, which explains how the memory of nature is lossed over generations. You end up being satisfied with what you have and this film invites us to fight against that. I was taken aback by a Hungarian film which approaches its subject through a ghost. At first, its slowness scared me, then I let myself go in contemplation, in wonder. I think you have to dare to be surprised, including by the slowness and humility, and am sensitive to the absence of imprinted animals. I am also campaigning to promote these films.\n\nPhilippe de Grissac: I fell in love with th"
