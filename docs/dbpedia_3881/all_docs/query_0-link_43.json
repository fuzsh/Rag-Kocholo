And ponder some of the titles of the later films he was adding to his résumé: Horror of the Blood Monsters, The House of the Seven Corpses, Satan's Cheerleaders, Vampire Hookers, The Best of Sex and Violence, Demented Death Farm Massacre, Evil Spawn, Teenage Exorcist .... Clearly, this is a career that needs to be examined by psychologists, not film critics.\n\nWhen I first published that comment, an indignant reader wrote in to complain that, according to Carradine's comments in an interview, it was pure economic necessity that drove Carradine to accept all those roles, making it uncharitable to criticize him. But this claim cannot be taken at face value: surely, no matter how alienated Carradine was from his successful sons, David or Keith would have been willing to give the old man room and board. Further, venerable performers in their declining years have many options in seeking continued income, ranging from dinner theater to tell-all autobiographies, that Carradine seemingly never considered. We are forced to conclude that Carradine participated in all of these execrable films because he wanted to; for him, perhaps, the inhabitants of the Z-movie underworld functioned as a kind of surrogate family, where he was always welcomed like an eccentric old grandfather. In fact, Carradine is one of the rare performers who came to serve as a generic marker; if you saw Carradine in a movie, you knew that it was a horror, science fiction, or exploitation movie. Yet other actors in this category, ranging in distinction from Boris KARLOFF to Whit BISSELL, played that role with much more prominence and dignity; and while he somehow managed to maintain his good cheer as he labored on, examining the sorry chaos of his later career does offer an image of the punishment that a vengeful God might devise for the afterlife of bad actors: being forced to act in a series of movies, each one worse than the last, each venue less prestigious, each part smaller and more absurd, on to infinity.\n\nThat same vengeful God seeking to punish bad film critics might assign them to compile and research a complete John Carradine filmography; I cannot be sure that my list is complete (every book I consult adds some new horror—in every sense of the word—to the roster), and I cannot claim that I have seen every film on the list—because, based on capsule descriptions, it would require a dementia parallel to Carradine's to seek out and watch every one of them. One must first recall, implausible at it seems, that Carradine at one point made a bid for a career as a respectable character actor in major films, with reasonably good performances in John Ford's Stagecoach (1939) and The Grapes of Wrath (1940). But whether due to necessity or to choice, he soon succumbed to the siren call of bad movies. Cast as Dracula in House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula, he was dressed up to look exactly like the villain in a stage melodrama and played the part with bulging eyes and stagey flourishes in a manner that might be frightening to a small child; returning to the role two decades later, he was more subdued and, surprisingly, a little better in Billy the Kid vs. Dracula, but no performance could salvage that ill-conceived project. As Carradine aged, he settled into a succession of roles as mad scientists or traffickers in occult forces: his acting was usually routine, but when given slightly better material, like the sympathetic alien of The Cosmic Man, he might haltingly rise to the occasion.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Carradine often worked in television, where, aside for an unsuccessful pilot where he starred as Dr. Fu Manchu, his most noteworthy parts were a role in The Munsters as Mr. Gateman and an almost evocative performance as a monk who has captured the Devil in the Twilight Zone episode, \"The Howling Man.\" In his declining years, he drifted primarily into low-budget films, where the quality of Carradine's performances tended to be directly proportional to the quality of his directors: for better directors—probably due more to their willingness to rehearse and shoot retakes than to their greater ability to inspire the actor—Carradine performed passably well; for inept directors—probably due to their haste and lack of concern for quality—Carradine was a joke (as in Monstroid, where his purposeless, perfunctory priest character is basically ignored by everyone involved). It is not surprising, then, that his most noteworthy later performance came for his most noteworthy later director: in the segment of Woody ALLEN's Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Sex that spoofed monster movies, he played a mad scientist with zestful energy, cackling with glee about his creation of a huge ambulatory breast to terrorize the countryside.\n\nThe odd thing about Carradine's career is that he displayed no real appreciation for the genuinely unknown or genuinely unearthly; rather, he tried to convey the strange and terrifying only with a tired repertoire of acting tricks. The fact that such an actor could rise to the status of daft elder statesman again suggests that horror and science fiction films, despite a professed desire to shock and surprise, remain curiously domestic genres, devoted more to reassuring audiences with familiar faces than to upsetting their smug assumptions about the world."
