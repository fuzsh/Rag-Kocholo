        "text": "An issue of Starlog in the early 1980ies had a cartoon(?) that proposed to use Harryhausen as a verb, as in to harryhausen = to move in a very peculiar way (can’t remember the exact definition).\n\nAww. I remember going out to the ILM facility when they were at San Rafael, to demonstrate a colour system that could convert scanned film images to video, and back; which they used for the new Star Wars films. I had to fly home on Thursday, early. I was told Ray Harryhausen used to come over for coffee on Thursdays, and natter with film people and see what was new. I did wonder about changing my flight, and see him, but didn’t.\n\nI have never forgotten the skeletons in Sinbad. A great man.\n\nI once got to see a presentation by the Pixar folks who talked about consulting with Harryhausen when they were making Monsters Inc., it was adorable how they were obviously still geeking out over having the opportunity to meet him.\n\nOne of the greatest bits of wisdom he shared about designing and animating creatures was “Remember; they’re only ‘monsters’ when you make them angry.”\n\nI seem to recall you (?) posted about Starevich last time Harryhausen came up here. Keep on doing so - this stuff (credited to Ladislas AND Irene Starevich, interestingly) may actually be technically better. Seems somehow smoother than some of Harryhausen’s work.\n\nIf only there were an English translation/subtitled version. (I tried turning on English subtitles on YT, but no go.)\n\nETA - eventually managed to wrangle the settings to show auto-generated French-English subtitles. Joy! And puzzlement - the AI ain’t up to it yet but combination of spoken French comprehension and subtitles gets me there."
