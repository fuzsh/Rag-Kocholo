        "text": "How does a saltwater crocodile end up in a lake in Maine? That's the question plaguing everyone from a New York paleontologist to a local sheriff to a \"rich kook anthropology professor\" in this jokey horror flick from the creator of hit TV shows like Ally McBeal and Doogie Howser, M.D.\n\nThe Animal: A particularly large saltwater crocodile. (Spoilers: Actually two of them.)\n\nWhat Sets It Off: Having found its way into a lake in Maine, it simply does what crocodiles do and eats whatever it can get its teeth into, eventually including some people.\n\nWhy It's Underrated: As you might expect, with a script from someone known for sitcoms, everyone is hilarious in this charming monster movie, which features a cast that includes Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt, and Brendan Gleeson. The breakout star, however, is a foul-mouthed Betty White, whose appearance here played a big role in her reemergence into the modern pop-culture zeitgeist, even if the flick didn't perform that well at the box office.\n\nBased (loosely) on a true story, this historical thriller sees a pair of big game hunters (played by Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas) going up against a duo of man-eating lions who are preying on the construction crew of a bridge in Africa in 1898.\n\nThe Animals: A brace of lions whom the locals dub \"the Ghost\" and \"the Darkness\" because of how they hunt.\n\nWhat Sets Them Off: \"My particular feeling is that they were evil,\" screenwriter William Goldman said, describing the real-life events that inspired the film, when man-eating lions menaced a construction crew building a bridge in what is now modern-day Kenya.\n\nWhy It's Underrated: With a screenplay by Academy Award-winner Goldman (The Princess Bride), a star-studded cast, and the director of Predator 2 and A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 at the helm, The Ghost and the Darkness also had a relatively high budget, as these kinds of films go. Plus, it's the rare animal attack period piece.\n\nThe directorial debut of acclaimed producer Frank Marshall, Arachnophobia helped capitalize on one of the smallest animals that most people are scared of anyway, and is one of the few movies around about killer spiders that doesn't just go ahead and make the spiders huge.\n\nThe Animals: A (thankfully fictional) genus of extremely poisonous Venezuelan spiders that get loose in a small California town.\n\nWhat Sets Them Off: They're simply transplanted from their native ecosystem, and start to establish themselves in their new hunting grounds as the dominant predators.\n\nWhy It's Underrated: With Steven Spielberg on board as an executive producer, Arachnophobia takes an Amblin Entertainment-style approach to scary spider movies, with Marshall describing his intent as, \"People like to be scared but laughing, like a roller coaster. No one wants to be terrified.\" Not that plenty of arachnophobes weren't still terrified by the flick, which uses over 300 real spiders, often guided around by heat and cold, and sometimes actually placed on tiny leashes! Who doesn't want to watch that? (Besides people who are already scared of spiders.)\n\nThere are countless movies about menacing sharks, from Jaws and its many imitators all the way up through the present day. A recent standout was this nail-biter about an injured surfer (played by Blake Lively) trapped on a shrinking rock by a hungry great white.\n\nThe Animal: In classic shark movie fashion, the villain here is a great white, circling between a nearby whale carcass and the rock where Nancy, our protagonist, has taken refuge.\n\nWhat Sets It Off: Does a shark ever need a reason in one of these movies?\n\nWhy It's Underrated: How do you make a film claustrophobic when it's set on a gorgeous, open beach? Just add a shark. That's what direct Jaume Collett-Serra does here, keeping the tension cranking as the shark traps a wounded Nancy on the rock before allowing the film to explode into a day-glo phantasmagoria in its final confrontation. Also, there's a seagull in this movie named... Steven Seagull.\n\nAdapted from the Stephen King novel of the same name and directed by Lewis Teague, who also helmed Alligator, there's a reason why Cujo is the Jaws of \"dog attack\" movies.\n\nThe Animal: The eponymous Cujo is a large and friendly Saint Bernard... until he chases a rabbit into a hole in the ground.\n\nWhat Sets It Off: Sticking his head into a hole in search of a rabbit, Cujo is bitten by a rabid bat, developing rabies himself and going on to attack a variety of people, ultimately cornering a mother (Dee Wallace) and her son in a hot car.\n\nWhy It's Underrated: There's a reason we still call any big, scary dog \"Cujo\" to this day, but the movie was initially panned by a lot of critics, including Roger Ebert, who called it \"dreadful.\"\n\nFrom director Alexandre Aja (High Tension), Crawl's story of a swimmer and her dad who are trapped in a flooding house during a hurricane and menaced by alligators made waves (so to speak) thanks to its claustrophobic setting and an intense central turn by Kaya Scodelario.\n\nThe Animals: A bunch of alligators.\n\nWhat Sets Them Off: A hurricane floods a neighborhood in Florida, dumping a bunch of alligators into the crawlspaces beneath a house, where they eat what they can get, which happens to be our protagonists.\n\nWhy It's Underrated: Crawl did well for itself in theaters, but then COVID came along the following year and a lot of people may have forgotten the nail-biting thrills of this claustrophobic and bombastic home invasion flick - where the home invaders are massive gators."
