        "text": "GODZILLA MINUS ONE (2023) is being hailed by some fans and critics as the best Godzilla movie ever made.\n\nIt could be.\n\nThat’s a huge boast, considering that this is the 37th time the King of the Monsters, Godzilla, has stomped his way through a movie. And Godzilla really is the king of the monsters, or at least of the giant monsters. I mean, I love King Kong, and he’s my personal favorite giant monster, but in terms of cinematic significance, staying power, and sheer numbers, there’s no comparison. Godzilla is king.\n\nAnd whether or not GODZILLA MINUS ONE is the best Godzilla movie ever made or not (more on this later), the key point here is that it’s an incredibly well-made movie, the most intense giant monster movie since CLOVERFIELD (2008). I loved it.\n\nGODZILLA MINUS ONE features some of the most thrilling and cinematic Godzilla scenes ever put on film, and it takes its time creating memorable characters, so when they are put in harm’s way, the Godzilla sequences become that much more frightening.\n\nGODZILLA MINUS ONE takes place in the mid 1940s, making it a period piece, in the years when Japan was struggling to rebuild after the devastation of World War II. It’s interesting to note that the events in this movie take place nearly a decade before the events depicted in the original GODZILLA (1954). The movie opens with Kamakazi pilot Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) taking refuge on Odo Island to get his plane repaired. The lead mechanic there Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki) tells Shikishima that there’s nothing wrong with his plane, which introduces the main conflict in Shikishima’s life, that he ran away from his suicide mission, and the guilt and shame he feels because of it.\n\nNow, Odo Island should sound familiar to Godzilla fans, as it’s the fictional island where Godzilla first appeared the original Godzilla movie, and guess what? It’s where he shows up for the first time in this movie! And it’s up to Shikishima to shoot and kill the monster, and once again he fails. When he awakes, he finds everyone on the island dead except for himself and Tachibana, who calls him a coward for not taking the shot to kill Godzilla, and he tells Shikishima that all this blood is on his hands.\n\nBack in Japan, Shikishima finds all his family has died, and in the midst of living in guilt and shame, he meets Oishi (Minami Hamabe) a young woman who had rescued a baby, and the three of them form an unlikely family unit. When Shikishima takes a job on a boat to locate and destroy underwater mines, he becomes friends with its small crew.\n\nLater, when Godzilla resurfaces, now as a much larger and more powerful creature and attacks Japan, the broken nation finds itself without a defense. Its military is depleted, and the United States refuses to help in fear that any military maneuvers in the Pacific could escalate tensions with the Soviet Union. So, it’s the private citizens who have to take matters into their own hands, with Shikishima and his mine crew taking on a central role in the battle against Godzilla, which sets up Shikishima’s story arc, as he tries to protect his new family and friends, determined to make the ultimate sacrifice to destroy Godzilla and by doing so give a future to his family, friends, and the people of Japan.\n\nIt’s a terrific story. One of the best from any Godzilla movie.\n\nGODZILLA MINUS ONE was written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki, and while this is his first Godzilla movie, he’s an award-winning writer/director who’s been making movies for over twenty years. And that’s one of the biggest positives of GODZILLA MINUS ONE. It’s exceedingly cinematic and possesses the fine strokes of a master moviemaker and storyteller.\n\nThe Godzilla scenes in this movie are the among best in the entire series. They’re exciting, feature characters you care about in harm’s way, and are shot and framed by Takashi Yamazaki to full effect. The movie also makes full and dramatic use of the original Godzilla music theme during these sequences.\n\nThe climactic sequence where the citizens make their last stand against Godzilla is one of the series’ best. The only sequence which supersedes it is Godzilla’s attack on Tokyo in the original Godzilla, which remains one of the all-time best sequences in any giant monster movie— in any horror movie— period.\n\nOne drawback here is the finale in GODZILLA MINUS ONE is rather derivative of the finale in Christopher Nolan’s DUNKIRK (2017). While it didn’t get in the way of my enjoyment of this part of the movie, while watching it, with the ships, the tugboats manned by the citizens, the plane zooming above, I couldn’t help but think of the similar climactic scene in Nolan’s World War II movie.\n\nThere were other drawbacks as well. While the movie took great care to develop its characters, a lot of this time spent on them got in the way of the movie’s pacing. When Godzilla is not on screen, things aren’t very intense. This is by design, because when Godzilla is not in the movie, characters, at least not until the end, aren’t really talking about him. They’re talking about Japan.\n\nThis movie could have been titled JAPAN MINUS ONE. Of course, that wouldn’t have sold as many tickets. But the title GODZILLA MINUS ONE refers to how low Japan was after World War II, and the emergence of Godzilla put the nation into a minus. So, for the most part, these characters are thinking about rebuilding their lives, and in Shikishima’s case, he’s still living the war because of what he perceives to be the shame of his actions. This is all solid drama, but that being said, this is also a Godzilla movie, and when Godzilla is not on screen, in terms of a Godzilla movie, it’s a tad slow.\n\nI also can’t say that I loved the look of Godzilla in this one. At times he looked sufficiently ferocious, but there was something fake looking about him in many of his ocean appearances.\n\nBut these are minor quibbles. Again, I loved this movie!\n\nSo, do I think it’s the best Godzilla movie ever made? No. The original GODZILLA remains the best for me. I still find that movie so disturbing that it’s difficult to watch. Even the Raymond Burr Americanized version of that film has its moments. The attack on Tokyo, and the symbolism of Godzilla in light of the atomic bomb blasts, makes that movie a horror film for the ages.\n\nThe Godzilla films which followed became more and more fun, and to be certain, for me, all the Toho Godzilla movies of the 1960s and 70s are guilty pleasures. I enjoy all of them. When Toho continued the series in the 1990s and 2000s, they became a tad more serious, but they were also less fun, except for GODZILLA, MOTHRA AND KING GHIDORAH: GIANT MONSTERS ALL-OUT ATTACK (2001), better known among fans as GMK, which in spite of its mouthful of a title is a superior Godzilla movie and up until today my second favorite Godzilla movie.\n\nI haven’t really enjoyed any of the recent American Godzilla movies, and Toho’s previous entry, SHIN GODZILLA (2016), which was quite critically acclaimed, was a bit too cerebral for my tastes. It lacked emotion.\n\nThat’s not the case here with GODZILLA MINUS ONE. Emotions run high throughout. The characters’ stories are the main focus here and do not take a back seat to Godzilla.\n\nGODZILLA MINUS ONE is a superior giant monster movie, a superb horror movie, and probably my second favorite Godzilla movie after the original.\n\nAs such, I give it three and a half stars.\n\n—END—\n\nRATING SYSTEM\n\nFour stars – Perfect, Top of the line\n\nThree and a half stars- Excellent\n\nThree stars – Very Good\n\nTwo and a half stars – Good\n\nTwo Stars – Fair\n\nOne and a half stars – Pretty Weak\n\nOne star- Poor\n\nZero stars – Awful\n\nI love Ray Harryhausen movies.\n\nThen again, who doesn’t? They’re awesome!\n\nHowever, today’s IN THE SPOOKLIGHT feature, THE VALLEY OF GWANGI (1969) is not one of Harryhausen’s best. It also tanked at the box office.\n\nIts tale of cowboys vs. dinosaurs can be traced back to Harryhausen’s mentor, Willis H. O’Brien, who had the idea shortly after he completed the stop-motion effects on KING KONG (1933). O’Brien’s plans to make the movie were eventually scrapped, but he was able to insert the cowboys vs. monster theme in MIGHTY JOE YOUNG (1949), as cowboys in Africa attempted to lasso Mr. Joe Young, the monstrous gorilla in the film, which was also the first movie on which Ray Harryhausen worked, as O’Brien’s protege. Harryhausen did most of the animation work in the movie.\n\nO’Brien tried again with the cowboys vs. dinosaur story in the 1950s, but he eventually had to leave the project, and the movie, THE BEAST OF HOLLOW MOUNTAIN (1956), was made without him; the result a film with horribly inferior special effects.\n\nTen years later, Ray Harryhausen borrowed the idea and made a much better movie than THE BEAST OF HOLLOW MOUNTAIN, which isn’t saying much, but that movie was THE VALLEY OF GWANGI.\n\nI’m on record as saying that a Ray Harryhausen movie with inferior special effects doesn’t exist, because Harryhausen always brought his A game to the movies he worked on. And I stand by that statement. That being said, I will concede that the final stop-motion results in THE VALLEY OF GWANGI fall into the A- category. Harryhausen’s work is always smooth and impressive, but two things get in the way of success here. One, the main dinosaur in this movie, a very hungry Allosaurus, changes color throughout the film, and also in many scenes just doesn’t seem all that large or menacing, which is the biggest knock against this movie. The dinosaur just isn’t very frightening. Compared to Harryhausen’s creation in THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS (1953), the colorful Allosaurus seems like a Disney attraction.\n\nAll this being said, I still like THE VALLEY OF GWANGI. Very much. I’m just conceding that it’s not quite as good as some of Harryhausen’s other movies.\n\nTHE VALLEY OF GWANGI takes place in Mexico in the early 1900s, where T. J. (Gila Golan) runs a struggling wild west show, and much to her chagrin, her former lover, Tuck Kirby (James Franciscus) shows up, having left her years earlier. Tuck is a free spirit, a showman, who is always looking for the next best thing. and he’s there to try to help T.J. with her show. She wants no part of him, and she is encouraged to keep her distance from him by Champ Connors (Richard Carlson), who not only works for T.J., but looks after her, having promised her deceased father years earlier that he would do just that.\n\nBut when T.J. and Tuck discover a hidden valley in the desert in which dinosaurs live, they manage to capture an Allosaurus, and they decide— of course— to bring it back to T.J.’s show as its star attraction, hoping to make lots of money off the spectacle. Things don’t go as planned— of course— because the hungry Allosaurus has other ideas, and all things being equal would rather not be part of a wild west show but instead would much prefer to break free and eat as many people as possible!\n\nAnd that’s the plot of THE VALLEY OF GWANGI. The screenplay by William Bast, Julian More, and Willis H. O’Brien tells a pretty standard story, a variation of KING KONG that is much tamer than the 1933 masterpiece. The best scene in THE VALLEY OF GWANGI is the sequence where the cowboys take on the Allosaurs, but honestly, it’s awfully reminiscent of the scene in MIGHTY JOE YOUNG where the cowboys meet up with Joe.\n\nTHE VALLEY OF GWANGI has a very interesting cast. I’ve always liked James Franciscus, and as such, I’ve always felt a bit sad for him, as he was a really good actor who never seemed to get that big break. As Tuck Kirby, Franciscus is a dashing leading man, a rogue with a heart, as while he does get to speak some unintentional sexist lines of dialogue, he means well, and really isn’t as bad as he’s made out to be. In the end, he really does care about T.J.\n\nFranciscus would go on to star in BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES (1970), a movie that he hoped would help him shed his pretty boy image, but the film underperformed at the box office and the success he had hoped would come from it never materialized. He also starred in the horror movie KILLER FISH (1979) with Lee Majors and Karen Black. Franciscus died in 1991. He was only 57.\n\nGila Golan is enjoyable here as T.J., although her lines were dubbed by another actress.\n\nRichard Carlson of course is best known among genre fans for his work in CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON (1954) and various other horror/science fiction movies from the 1950s, including IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE (1953).\n\nAlso in the cast is Laurence Naismith as Professor Bromley, the visiting British professor who is an expert on dinosaurs. Naismith has a resume a mile long, and also appeared in Harryhausen’s JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS (1963) and in the horror movie VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED (1960).\n\nAnd Freda Jackson plays the witch who curses everybody and anybody in this movie! Jackson appeared in Harryhausen’s CLASH OF THE TITANS (1981), and my favorite Jackson role was as the crazed and dedicated Greta who spent her days and nights protecting the vampire Baron Meinster in Hammer’s classic THE BRIDES OF DRACULA (1960).\n\nAs a whole, THE VALLEY OF GWANGI is an interesting production. It was shot in Spain, with a British crew and director, and an American actor and Israeli actress in the lead roles.\n\nThat British director was Jim O’Connolly, and he doesn’t really do much here to give the film much distinction. There is one memorable sequence, the aforementioned cowboys vs. Allosaurus scene.\n\nThe best part of THE VALLEY OF GWANGI is the special effects of Ray Harryhausen, even though they are not his best work. There’s a neat battle between the Allosaurus and a styracosaurus, and another between the Allosaurus and an elephant. The film’s finale takes place inside a gigantic church, which again features nifty effects from Harryhausen. If only the Allosaurus wasn’t so colorful!\n\nBut he is. Which means, that long before Barney invaded children’s homes, Gwangi was the original purple dinosaur!\n\nCare to give an Allosaurus a hug?\n\n—END—\n\n65 (2023), a new science fiction adventure starring Adam Driver as a space pilot who crash lands on Earth 65 million years ago smack in the middle of some menacing dinosaurs, has a fun premise, but then does nothing with it.\n\nAt all.\n\n65 is the story of Mills (Adam Driver), a pilot who is about to leave on a two-year mission which will pay him well, money he needs to treat his ailing daughter Nevine (Chloe Coleman). But enroute, the ship is struck by a meteor and crash lands on an unknown planet, which happens to be Earth in the age of the dinosaurs. There is only one other survivor besides Mills, a young girl named Koa (Ariana Greenblatt), and so, thinking of his own daughter, Mills vows to get her back home. The specifics of that endeavor include climbing a mountain to reach the ship’s escape pod, which is on the mountaintop because Mills’ ship split in two and that’s where the half with the pod landed. In their way, a jungle filled with hungry dinosaurs.\n\nAnd oh, by the way. This is also the day when the catastrophic meteor strike which wiped out the dinosaurs is about to occur. So, if Mills and Koa don’t get off the planet, they will be pulverized by the doomsday meteor blast.\n\nThere are a lot of thought-provoking roads this movie could have taken. Sadly, however, there just isn’t much that is thought-provoking about this film.\n\nLet’s start with the characters. Mills and his people come from a planet different than Earth, and yet they all look human, and they speak English. But they are about to crash land on Earth during a time before humans existed, and so, I thought, might there be some PROMETHEUS (2012) ideas floating around, that perhaps these folks would somehow become the parents of the human race? But that’s not what this movie is about. And I know, in the STAR WARS universe, they look human too, but STAR WARS is also more fantasy/adventure than science fiction. So, why is it worse here in 65 than in the STAR WARS movies? It’s not. It’s just that in a standalone film about aliens who crash land on Earth who look and act exactly like humans, well that stands out a little more here, and not in a good way.\n\nThe screenplay by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, both of whom also directed the movie, struggles from the outset with this exciting premise. The plot here seems like a no brainer for suspense and excitement, yet the film labors to generate any, especially at the beginning. The ship crashes, and Mills is alone for a while trying to figure out what happened, and all I could think about is, we the audience know what happened: they crashed on Earth in a place full of dinosaurs! Had this ship contained a group of people who were alive, we could see them all dealing with these dinosaurs immediately! Instead, the script makes the dubious decision to kill everyone on board in the crash, except for Mills (and then later Koa when he discovers her alive), and so when Mills looks about the jungle, you know he’s not going to be killed because the movie would then be over after about ten minutes, and so there’s no suspense and no excitement.\n\nThe screenplay also struggles with time. At the beginning of the movie, it’s stated that Mills will be gone for two years. Yet, on the trip, everyone is in stasis, which seems odd for a mission that will have them back home in two years. It’s not like they’re traveling for decades. But I can buy that perhaps they were saving on food and other things, so it would make sense for them to be asleep for the voyage. However, after the crash Mills learns news about his daughter, and while it’s not specifically stated, it just seems like more than two years have passed since he left.\n\nThe movie also employs some of what I like to call LOST IN SPACE logic. Now, I love the original 1960s science fiction TV show LOST IN SPACE (1965-68) and I’m a big fan, but the logic on that show was always silly, and science was never at the forefront of their scripts, unlike STAR TREK. Here, you have Mills sending out distress calls to his home planet, and he seems to believe they will send help immediately. One, he’s on an uncharted planet, so they don’t even know where it is, and two, he must be far from home. What kind of ships do they have? Can they navigate worm holes? Does he really expect them to just show up and rescue them? Apparently, he does. Which makes little sense.\n\nThen, he believes that the escape pod/ship will save them. Yes, it will get them off the planet, but then what? What about fuel? Food? And where are they going to go once they’re flying in space? No one here is asking these questions. It’s all very lazy writing.\n\nThe movie isn’t interested in any of these things, but it is interested in dinosaurs. So, how are the dinosaurs in this movie? Not bad. There are some decent sequences here, my favorite involving a T-Rex towards the end of the movie. But a lot of the scenes are derivative of stuff we’ve already seen in the JURASSIC PARK movies. In short, the dinosaurs here are decent, but they don’t make or break this movie.\n\nScreenwriters Beck and Woods also worked on the screenplays for THE QUIET PLACE movies, which told much better stories than the one told here in 65. THE QUIET PLACE movies took an interesting premise and ran with it. 65 takes a neat premise and drops the ball.\n\nThe acting, however, is fine. Adam Driver is really good as Mills, and he turns in an athletic, driven performance as he will stop at nothing to get Koa home. Driver’s performance, as expected, is one of the better parts of the movie.\n\nAriana Greenblatt is also excellent as Koa, but the sad truth is there’s not a whole lot for either of these two actors to do other than react to scary dinosaurs.\n\nMy favorite part of 65 is that they used the same sound effects from the Martian machines in the classic 1953 WAR OF THE WORLDS for Mills’ ship’s warning system. It was fun to hear it on the big screen, even if only for a few seconds.\n\n65 is pure fluff, but not very thought-provoking or exciting fluff. Its tale of dinosaurs attacking people who have crash-landed on Earth 65 million years ago could have been intense and exciting, but it’s not. It’s superficial and sadly mediocre.\n\nBut because I like dinosaurs… and who doesn’t?… I give it two stars.\n\n—END—\n\nRATING SYSTEM\n\nFour stars – Perfect, Top of the line\n\nThree and a half stars- Excellent\n\nThree stars – Very Good\n\nTwo and a half stars – Good\n\nTwo Stars – Fair\n\nOne and a half stars – Pretty Weak\n\nOne star- Poor\n\nZero stars – Awful\n\nWhen you think of giant monster movies, you most likely think of Godzilla and King Kong, arguably the two most famous giant movie monsters of all time, and you probably think of Japan’s Toho Studios, who made so many of those Godzilla movies we love, as well as plenty of other giant monster adventures.\n\nBut today’s movie, GORGO (1961), hails from the United Kingdom, a country that historically did not churn out a whole bunch of giant monster movies. And while in some ways the plot borrows heavily from the original GODZILLA (1954), except in this case rather than Godzilla emerging from the ocean to destroy Tokyo, we have Gorgo emerging from the ocean to pummel London, GORGO is a good enough giant monster movie to stand on its own.\n\nIn fact, the special effects in this one depicting Gorgo’s assault on London are right up there with Godzilla’s more famous attack on Tokyo. Topnotch stuff! So much so, that this sequence which pretty much takes up the entire second half of the movie, ranks as one of the best monster-attacks-city sequences ever put on film! The movie is only 78 minutes long, and so at the end of the day, GORGO is one action-packed giant monster movie!\n\nBut it’s also rather odd in that it’s one of the few monster movies— or any movie for that matter— that doesn’t really feature any women! There are no female main characters, and I think there’s only two women in the film who even speak any lines of dialogue!\n\nThen again, giant Gorgo is a female, as she is a mommy monster in search of her baby monster which gets kidnapped and taken to London. Hmm. Maybe Gorgo’s contract stipulated that she would be the only prominent female in the cast?\n\nAnyway, GORGO is the story of Joe Ryan (Bill Travers) and Sam Slade (William Sylvester) who helm a salvage vessel, and when they discover a sea monster off the coast of Ireland, they capture it and decide to bring it back to London in order to make money off it. These guys obviously went to the Carl Denham school of business! Little boy Sean (Vincent Winter), who lives on the island where Gorgo is discovered, tells Joe and Sam that they shouldn’t capture the monster and take him away, but the adults don’t listen to him. So, Sean secretly stows away on the ship, and when Joe and Sam discover him, they decide to take care of him and pretty much adopt him for the rest of the movie. Er, Sean, where the hell are your parents?\n\nThey bring Gorgo to London where he is shown off at a circus and much to Joe and Sam’s delight, makes them lots of money. But it turns out, this is only a baby Gorgo, and when mommy Gorgo emerges from the ocean, she’s none too happy about her son being abducted, and so she swims to London and attacks the city in order to get him back.\n\nAnd there’s your plot!\n\nGORGO was directed by Eugene Lourie, who must have loved giant monster movies, because this was the fourth time he directed a movie about a giant monster! His first, THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS (1953), is probably his most famous, as it featured the special effects of Ray Harryhausen and was based on the short story “The Fog Horn,” by Ray Bradbury. Lourie followed this up with THE COLOSSUS OF NEW YORK (1958), a film about a giant robot, and then he made THE GIANT BEHEMOTH (1959), which featured the special effects of KING KONG creator Willis O’Brien, which told the story of a yet another giant sea monster.\n\nAnd then he made GORGO. Overall, THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS is probably his best movie, mostly because it did feature the effects of Ray Harryhausen, but GORGO is a close second, and the attack on London is far more intense than any of the scenes found in THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS.\n\nEven more interesting, these are the only four movies Eugene Lourie ever directed! He should have directed more, because all four of these movies are very good, and two of them, THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS and GORGO are downright excellent! Lourie passed away in 1991 from heart failure.\n\nRobert L. Richards and Daniel James wrote the screenplay which tells a decent enough giant monster story, with the one glaring oddity being that there are no women in this story whatsoever!\n\nYoung Vincent Winter, who played Sean, would become disappointed with acting and turn to working behind the scenes where he would serve as an assistant director for many movies, including the Christopher Reeve SUPERMAN (1978). Winter died in 1998 from a heart attack at the age of 50.\n\nAlso in the cast is Martin Benson, who played the circus owner who promotes Gorgo in London. Benson is no stranger to genre films, having played doomed Father Spiletto in THE OMEN (1976), and, in the role I remember him most for, playing the weasel-like Mr. Rash in NIGHT CREATURES (1962), Hammer’s pirate adventure starring Peter Cushing and Oliver Reed. Benson also had a “pressing engagement” in the Sean Connery James Bond classic GOLDFINGER (1964), as his character ends up being crushed in a car by Oddjob.\n\nAnd speaking of Hammer Films, in the scene where baby Gorgo is paraded around London, you can see Hammer’s THE MUMMY (1959) playing at the theater at Piccadilly Circus.\n\nThe impressive special effects were created by Tom Howard, who would later work on Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968). Interestingly enough, the same monster suit was used for both mommy Gorgo and baby Gorgo, and the size difference was achieved with different sets and models, as well as different roar sound effects.\n\nWhen GORGO was released in 1961, there had only been two Godzilla movies released, the original and its sequel GODZILLA RAIDS AGAIN (1955), but the filmmakers must have had Godzilla in mind because they premiered GORGO in Japan rather than in the United Kingdom.\n\nJapan returned the favor by basically remaking GORGO as MONSTER FROM A PREHISTORIC PLANET (1967) (Its original and better title is GAPPA THE TRIPHIBIAN MONSTERS), a tale in which a mommy and a daddy monster attack Tokyo in order to bring back their baby monster which had been taken to Japan.\n\nThe lesson from both these movies is, if you’re going to put a young giant monster in a show, you’d best ask its parents’ permission first! You might also want to include them in the contract and give them a piece of the proceeds!\n\nGORGO is one of the better giant monster movies of yesteryear. In spite of the dubious decision not to feature any female characters in its story other than the giant monster Gorgo herself, this one features really good special effects and a second-half giant monster assault on London that can’t be beat!\n\nThe title, by the way, comes from the Gorgon, as Gorgo is short for Gorgon, and it refers to the Medusa tale of the creature so hideous one look at her would turn people to stone. While Gorgo is not that hideous looking, the creature is indeed monstrous and is impressive to behold.\n\nSo, you don’t have to be afraid of Gorgo’s face. It won’t turn you into stone. On the other hand, you probably should be afraid of Gorgo’s feet, which will turn you into some itty-bitty pieces of crushed flesh and bone when they step on you.\n\n—END—\n\nAfter KING KONG (1933), film audiences really had to wait a while before any other giant monsters returned to the big screen. The next major giant monster release really wasn’t until Ray Harryhausen’s special effects driven THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS (1953), based on Ray Bradbury’s short story “The Fog Horn.” Of course, the following year Japan’s Toho Studios released GODZILLA (1954) and after that there was no looking back for giant monster fans.\n\nBut in between 1933 and 1953 were lean years, with just a couple of films released featuring oversized creatures. One of these films was ONE MILLION B.C. (1940), an adventure about two different cave tribes who have to overcome their differences in order to survive.\n\nOne of the reasons they have to fight to survive is there are some prehistoric beasts on the loose. Yup, this isn’t factually accurate, of course, as some of these creatures would have been extinct long before cave people walked the earth, but who’s complaining?\n\nWhile ONE MILLION B.C. technically isn’t a horror movie, it does feature enormous ferocious creatures, and it is also of interest for horror fans because it features a pre-Wolf Man Lon Chaney Jr. in the cast.\n\nThe plot of ONE MILLION B.C. is pretty much a love story, as Tumak (Victor Mature) and Loana (Carole Landis) who are from opposing tribes meet and fall in love. Loana’s tribe is the more advanced and civilized of the two, and as they welcome Tumak, he learns of their more modern ways and uses this knowledge to help his own people. Meanwhile, life in the stone age is no picnic. There are nasty creatures at every turn, and pretty much all of them want to eat people for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nLon Chaney Jr. plays Tumak’s father Akhoba, who is a bit rough around the edges and sees nothing wrong with eating all the food first and letting his underlings have the scraps, which is unlike Loana’s tribe, who share their food equally.\n\nWhile Victor Mature, Carole Landis, Lon Chaney Jr. and the rest of the human cast are all fine, since they’re playing cave people, they don’t really have any lines of dialogue, meaning this one can become tedious to watch.\n\nThe real stars in this one are the creatures, and the special effects run hot and cold. Mostly cold. There is a T-Rex like dinosaur that is laugh-out-loud awful. It’s obviously a man in a suit, its size changes, and at times it seems to be no taller than a center for the NBA.\n\nThe best effects are when the film utilizes real lizards and makes them seem gigantic. Most of the time this type of effect is inferior, but in this film the “giant” lizards look pretty authentic. The film also does a nice job with the “mastodons” which are elephants in disguise. If anything is done well consistently, it’s the sound effects. All the creatures, regardless of how they look, sound terrifying.\n\nThe special effects were actually nominated for an Academy Award but lost out to THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (1940).\n\nONE MILLION B.C. was directed by Hal Roach and Hal Roach Jr., and while the monster scenes are all rather exciting, what happens in between them is not. In fact, most of the film is pretty much a bore.\n\nBut audiences in 1940 didn’t think so. ONE MILLION B.C. was the box office champion that year.\n\nMickell Novack, George Baker, and Joseph Frickert wrote the standard no frills screenplay.\n\nVictor Mature would go on to make a lot of movies, including SAMSON AND DELILAH (1949) and THE ROBE (1953), while Carole Landis, who pretty much gives the best performance in the film, sadly struggled to land leading roles in subsequent movies, ultimately leading to her tragic suicide at the age of 29 in 1948.\n\nAnd Lon Chaney Jr. of course would make THE WOLF MAN the following year, and the rest, as they say, was history.\n\nOver the years, ONE MILLION B.C. has been overshadowed by its Hammer Films remake, ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. (1966), which starred Raquel Welch and featured special effects by Ray Harryhausen. Neither film is among my favorites.\n\nThis Thanksgiving, as you prepare to give thanks and dig into that grand turkey dinner, you might want to check out ONE MILLION B.C., a movie that recalls a long ago time when it was humans who were on the holiday menu.\n\n—END—\n\nGODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS (2019), the latest American made Godzilla film and sequel to Warner Bros.’ GODZILLA (2014), is a well-acted action-filled monster movie that somehow in spite of these strengths is sadly underwhelming.\n\nAnd that’s because this movie contains an odd mix of often ridiculous plot points combined with a tone that simply takes itself way too seriously. Instead, the film should have gone for one or the other. A campier tone would have aligned itself better with the goofy superficial plot points. Likewise, a much more realistic and gritty storyline would have fit in better with the film’s serious feel. As it stands, the movie mixes both, and it just doesn’t work.\n\nFollowing the 2014 Godzilla attacks which left the world a different place, the secret organization Monarch is in charge of monitoring all the new giant monsters which have been discovered in various places around the globe (silly plot point #1), but the U.S. government and military want to shut down Monarch so they can destroy the monsters and save the Earth. But the Monarch scientists argue that the monsters really aren’t here to destroy the Earth but to save it from its worst enemy: humankind.\n\nTop Monarch scientist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her husband Mark (Kyle Chandler) lost their son in the previous Godzilla attack, and his death caused them to separate, and Emma alone is raising their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown). It also caused Emma to have extreme ideas about these monsters, and so she aligns herself with the dubious Jonah Alan (Charles Dance)— cue evil villain music!— and the two plan to release the giant monsters so they can unleash their wrath on the world and “cleanse” it of its human cancer. Hmm. Where have I heard this before? Is that Thanos I see whispering into Dr. Russell’s ear?\n\nBut Dr. Russell isn’t arguing a la Thanos that half the population has to be wiped out by the monsters, only some of it, and that at the end of it all there will be new growth and the planet will be greener for it. Come again?\n\nOf course, when this starts happening, the rest of Monarch and the U.S. military go ballistic, and they not only form an uncomfortable alliance to thwart Emma’s efforts, but they also call in Mark Russell to help them. Mark is mostly interested in finding and saving his daughter, and speaking of Madison, once she learns what her mom has planned, she changes her tune about which parent she wants to be spending time with.\n\nThings grow more complicated when one of the monsters, King Ghidorah, is discovered to be from another planet, and he decides that he’s going to control and lead all the monsters in a battle against Godzilla for supremacy of the Earth.\n\nGodzilla? That’s right! This is a Godzilla movie! Funny how I haven’t mentioned him yet. Real funny. Not. Which is to say more Godzilla in this story and less elaborate saving-the-world-nonsense would have been most welcome.\n\nAnyway, it’s up to Godzilla to take on King Ghidorah and ultimately save the world.\n\nBut as you may surmise from this plot summary, it’s a helluva convoluted way to tell a story about everyone’s favorite fire-breathing radioactive giant lizard!\n\nPoor Godzilla. He was supposed to appear in this movie more than he did in the last one, the 2014 film, and while that may have been the case, it sure didn’t feel like it. For a movie that’s called GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS it sure seemed like he took a back seat to the other monsters in this one..\n\nThe best thing that GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS has going for it is its cast. It boasts a really strong cast of actors, led by its three principal leads.\n\nVera Farmiga as Dr. Emma Russell and Millie Bobby Brown as daughter Madison were both excellent. This is Millie Bobby Brown’s film debut. Brown, of course, plays Eleven on the hit TV series STRANGER THINGS (2016-19) so her effective performance in this movie is no surprise.\n\nVera Farmiga is one of my favorite actresses working today, and while her movie performances have all been superb, it’s her work on the TV series BATES MOTEL (2013-17) based on PSYCHO (1960) where she played Norma Bates that I think is among her best stuff. Her interpretation of Norma Bates was much more nuanced and three-dimensional than the character ever was before in both the Hitchcock movie and Robert Bloch’s original novel.\n\nKyle Chandler is always enjoyable in nearly every movie he’s in, and he’s been in a lot, from light fare like GAME NIGHT (2018) to more serious stuff like MANCHESTER BY THE SEA (2016) to small supporting roles like in THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013), Chandler always makes a lasting impression. His work here in GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS is no exception.\n\nWhen these three actors are on-screen, the movie is at its best and most watchable, and the good news is they’re on screen a lot, but the problem is they are stuck in a ridiculous storyline and are often uttering some very superficial and god-awful dialogue that really detracts from the seriousness of their performances.\n\nIncidentally, Kyle Chandler also appeared in Peter Jackson’s KING KONG (2005) which is not part of the current Warner Bros. giant monster universe, and he’s set to appear in the next film, GODZILLA VS. KONG.\n\nThe supporting cast is every bit as good as the three leads.\n\nYou have Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins (THE SHAPE OF WATER [2017]), Ziyi Zhang, and Bradley Whitford as fellow Monarch scientists. Watanabe and Hawkis are reprising their roles from the previous Godzilla movie, and in Watanabe’s case, he’s playing Dr. Serizawa, a name that goes back to the original GODZILLA film from 1954.\n\nBradley Whitford gets the liveliest lines in the movie, but strangely, his frequent attempts at humor seem to misfire repeatedly. Again, it’s that odd mix, and his campy lines seem out-of-place with the serious tone surrounding him.\n\nDavid Strathairn plays Admiral William Stenz, another character back from the 2014 film, and Charles Dance does his villainous best at bad guy Jonah Alan, although at the end of the day the character is pretty much all talk and no action. In short, he does very little here.\n\nThe true villain is King Ghidorah, which brings us finally, to the monsters. After all, you don’t see a Godzilla film for the actors. You see it for the monsters. So, how do the monsters fare here?\n\nWell, the main monsters here are Godzilla, King Ghidorah, Rodan, and Mothra, and while they are all given modern-day looks, I can’t say I was all that impressed. It sounds strange to say this, but with all our current CGI technology, I find that I prefer the old-fashioned man-in-suit monsters from Toho’s glory days. These monsters all look okay, but nothing about them I find special nor memorable.\n\nIn the Toho films, for better or for worse, the monsters, both good and bad, had personality. The monsters here have no personality. They are quite simply generic and not at all cinematic, which is a major knock against this movie, and quite frankly against the other Warner Bros. monster universe films. If the Marvel superheroes lacked similar charisma that series would have never gotten off the ground.\n\nAlso, I did not like the look of this movie at all. Most of the action takes place during various weather events and storms, and so it’s always difficult to see what the heck is going on. For example, the film’s climax takes place in Boston, and at Fenway Park specifically, and I have to say it’s one of the poorest and most fake looking interpretations of Boston I’ve ever seen in a movie. What could have been iconic and devastating is instead cartoonish and superficial.\n\nGODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS was directed by Michael Dougherty, and he also wrote the screenplay with some help from Zach Shields. This is the same creative team that gave us the horror movie KRAMPUS (2015), a film I actually liked quite a bit. In fact, I enjoyed KRAMPUS more than I enjoyed GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS.\n\nDougherty gives us plenty of monsters and monster battles, but since 1) the monsters didn’t look outstanding, and 2) the settings of these battles were often in storms and difficult to see, as presented here, the monsters’ presence didn’t really lift this one to great heights.\n\nThe screenplay is superficial at best. It never gives us real terror— real people are noticeably absent here—- other than the scientists and a few military types, we see no one else reacting to the monsters. The film lacks real world emotion big time.\n\nWhile it attempts to be an homage to earlier films at times, like the use of the Oxygen Destroyer, a weapon from the 1954 GODZILLA, it does it all in a fleeting manner that never really gets to the heart of the matter.\n\nDougherty has a cast of seasoned and talented actors that make this movie better than it is, but he doesn’t really help them out. They are in few cinematic scenes and more often than not are uttering lines of dialogue that are pretty bad.\n\nSo, where do I stand on GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS? For the most part, I did enjoy this movie, especially when watching Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, and Kyle Chandler, but whenever Godzilla and his fellow monsters showed up, I would lose interest, and for a Godzilla movie, this is NOT a good thing.\n\nThe film is a mixed bag to be sure, and while I enjoyed it more than GODZILLA (2014), I still prefer the Toho films of old, from the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. Now, Toho continued the Godzilla series into the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s, even making the critically acclaimed SHIN GODZILLA (2016), and while those films in general are okay—I like the aforementioned older ones more—, they’re about on par with this current Warner Bros. series.\n\nThe next film, GODZILLA VS. KONG, slated for release in 2020, is one that while I’m definitely interested in, based upon the Warner Bros. films so far, I can’t say I’m excited about.\n\nSo, GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS is okay, but since the best part about it is NOT Godzilla, I don’t think Godzilla himself would approve, and for me, that’s all you need to know about this one.\n\n—-END—\n\n2018 wasn’t really the best year for horror movies, at least not at the theater. Netflix actually had some of the better horror movies I saw this year. But at the theater it was slim pickings. Of the nearly 100 movies I saw at the move theater this year, only 12 were horror films, and a few of those weren’t really “horror” per se. Granted, there were a few clinkers I avoided all together, and so by design I saw fewer horror flicks in 2018.\n\nHere we go, my list of HORROR MOVIES 2018, from worst to first:\n\n12.THE NUN – by far, the worst horror film I saw this year. I know, a lot of people liked this one, but the script with both its lame story and ridiculous dialogue was horrible. Shot on location in Romania, the film looks terrific, but that’s all it has going for it. Part of the CONJURING universe.\n\n11.INSIDIOUS: THE LAST KEY – yet another INSIDIOUS prequel. I really wish they’d put this series to rest already. I do like Lin Shaye as demon hunter Elise Rainier, but since this character was killed off in the very first INSIDIOUS movie, the continuing back stories told in the prequels don’t really resonate.\n\n10. JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM – not really a horror movie, but you do have those dinosaurs. Pretty bad entry in the JURASSIC series. Silly and oftentimes dull.\n\n9. HALLOWEEN – after all the hype, this latest entry in the HALLOWEEN series was ultimately a disappointment. Ignoring every other movie in the series except for the original John Carpenter classic HALLOWEEN (1978) the film joins Laurie Strode 50 years later as she’s still dealing with the traumatic events of being stalked by Michael Myers on Halloween back in 1978. Jamie Lee Curtis returns to the series to play Laurie once again, and her scenes are by far the best in the movie- the best written and the best acted. The rest of the movie is surprisingly awful. Tells nearly the same story as HALLOWEEN H20: 20 YEARS LATER (1998).\n\n8. RAMPAGE – Again, not really a horror movie, but the film does feature giant animals battling each other. This ultra silly Dwayne Johnson vehicle has its moments, and it’s more fun than you might think.\n\n7. HEREDITARY – I know, for a lot of horror fans, this was the best horror flick from 2018. I was lukewarm to it. I enjoyed it for nearly 2/3 of the way through, but its ending pretty much ruined it for me. There’s a lot to like about this horror movie, which for me, ultimately did not deliver.\n\n6. OVERLORD – this horror move/World War II action adventure combo wasn’t half bad. On the eve of D-Day, a small group of American soldiers on a secret mission discover a horrific Nazi secret. Works better as an action film than a horror movie, as the horror elements don’t really show up till the end, and they’re not as horrifying as expected.\n\n5. THE POSSESSION OF HANNAH GRACE – this demonic possession movie was better than I expected. The gimmick here is that the possessed being is a corpse rather than a living person. I know. That doesn’t sound like much of a gimmick. But it works here thanks to a compelling lead performance by Shay Mitchell as the woman in the morgue who encounters the angry demon.\n\n4. HELL FEST – another one that was better than expected. This one got off to an awful start with some sloppy direction and bad dialogue, but its standard tale of a crazed killer causing havoc at a Halloween amusement park gets better as it goes along, much, much better. Amy Forshyth is excellent as main character Natalie, the one girl in the group who’s not interested in horror or the supernatural but finds herself smack dab in the center of all it.\n\n3. THE MEG – this giant shark tale starring Jason Statham should have been stupid, but surprise! It’s actually pretty good. So much so that it was one of my favorite movies from last summer. No, it’s not JAWS (1975), but it’s the best of the recent shark movies, in spite of run-of-the-mill special effects.The strength of THE MEG is its surprisingly snappy script and exceptional performances by everyone involved, and seriously, you can’t really go wrong with a Jason Statham action movie, even if he’s battling a gigantic prehistoric shark.\n\n2. ANNIHILATION – this film is way superior to the previous ten films on this list. This horror/science fiction flick about a group of women led by Natalie Portman on an expedition to investigate a bizarre phenomenon where the normal laws of nature don’t apply has three things going for it: the science fiction aspects will blow your mind, the horror scenes deliver, and its female cast is second to none. Exceptional science fiction horror.\n\n1. A QUIET PLACE – my pick for the best horror movie of 2018. Sure, its ending doesn’t make a lot of sense, but what comes before it works so well I let the weak conclusion slide. This tale of vicious alien creatures with exceptional hearing which hunt down humans whenever they hear them follows one family’s efforts to survive in this apocalyptic tale directed by John Krasinski, who also stars as the father in the family. Co-star Emily Blunt has one of the best scenes in the movie, a birthing scene. Yup, try giving birth silently as a hungry alien creature closes in for the kill. Scary stuff. Well done throughout. Also a lot of fun to see a movie that for nearly 45 minutes offers no sound on the soundtrack as the family has to survive silently. It was amazing how fast the silence caused people in the theater to stop munching on their popcorn.\n\nThere you have it. A look at the horror films from 2018.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n—Michael\n\nIt’s Thanksgiving here in the U.S, that holiday where people kick back and relax, reflect on what they’re thankful for, and eat lots of food, especially turkey.\n\nWith that in mind, here are some Thanksgiving Turkey Movie Awards for 2018. Of course, the year is not over, and so these lists are not final. There’s still room for more turkeys, so to speak.\n\nOkay, let’s get right to it!\n\nHere are my 2018 TURKEY AWARDS:\n\nWORST MOVIE\n\n(And again, this list is not final. There are still five weeks left before we close out 2018.)\n\nRight now, my least favorite film of 2018 would be PEPPERMINT, a dreadful action film starring Jennifer Garner, followed closely by THE NUN, a flat-out awful horror movie, and THE HAPPYTIME MURDERS, a very unfunny comedy that wasted a cool concept. I mean, who wouldn’t want to see a raunchy R-rated Muppet comedy? But they blew it.\n\nWORST ACTING PERFORMANCE\n\nThis is difficult because acting is not something that is lacking in today’s movies. Actors today perform at a level that I think generally speaking is much higher than actors in the past. They convey emotions that come off as authentic more often than actors from yesteryear. While there have been great actors in every generation, I think in terms of numbers, more actors today deliver performances that are spot on than ever before.\n\nSo, how to choose a poor performance when there really isn’t any? I’m going to cheat a bit. I’m going to go with the three main “actors” in Clint Eastwood’s THE 15:17 TO PARIS, and this is cheating because these three guys aren’t actors. Eastwood chose to cast the three real life men who thwarted a terrorist attack on a Paris train to play themselves in his retelling of this heroic tale. Decades from now, Eastwood’s decision may be deemed as genius, but right now, that’s not the case for the simple reason that those young men aren’t actors and as such were out-of-place in a movie, even playing themselves. As a result, their scenes were incredibly boring and lifeless.\n\nWORST SCREENPLAY\n\nTHE HAPPYTIME MURDERS – This screenplay by Todd Berger couldn’t be less funny if it tried. They should have hired Fozzy Bear. Waka! Waka!\n\nWORST DIRECTOR\n\nBrian Henson, THE HAPPYTIME MURDERS. Henson has made real Muppet movies. He should have known better and pulled off a far more successful movie. He dropped the ball with this one.\n\nWORST HORROR MOVIE\n\nTHE NUN. Nun of this movie is worth your time.\n\nWORST SEQUEL\n\nINSIDIOUS: THE LAST KEY, followed by OCEAN’S 8, JURASSIC PARK: FALLEN KINGDOM, THE EQUALIZER 2, and MAMA MIA: HERE WE GO AGAIN! Not a good year for sequels. Then again, when is it ever a good year for sequels?\n\nWORST SUPERHERO MOVIE\n\nDEADPOOL 2 – now this is not really a bad movie. It’s simply the superhero film I liked the least in 2018.\n\nSo far.\n\nAnd now for the THANKSGIVING AWARDS portion of the column. Movies I’m thankful for this year:\n\nMARVEL\n\nThree of the best films of the year so far have been Marvel Superhero movies: BLACK PANTHER, AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, and ANT-MAN AND THE WASP. Yup, it’s been a marvelous year for superheroes!\n\nDOCUMENTARIES\n\nWith WON’T YOU BE MY NEIGHBOR? the documentary on the life of Mister Rogers leading the pack, 2018 has been a stellar year for documentaries.\n\nMOVIES ABOUT WOMEN\n\nIt’s been a great year so far for movies starring women, written and directed by women, and that are telling stories about women. Some of these movies include BOOK CLUB, EIGHTH GRADE, ANT-MAN AND THE WASP, ANNIHILATION, and LEAVE NO TRACE.\n\nBEST HORROR MOVIE\n\nA QUIET PLACE – smart horror at its best, even if its ending isn’t nearly as intelligent as the rest of the movie. The horror genre is alive and well.\n\nBEST SUPERHERO MOVIE\n\nBLACK PANTHER – this Marvel superhero movie transcends the genre and is so good it has no business being a superhero film. Marvel continues its run of incredibly entertaining movies.\n\nCLASSIC ACTORS\n\nVeteran movie actors have graced the screen throughout 2018, including Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Andy Garcia, Mary Steenburgen, Candice Bergen, Bruce Dern, Robert Redford, Jodie Foster, Ben Kingsley, Jamie Lee Curtis, Meryl Streep, and Cher.\n\nBEST MOVIE\n\nSorry, but you’ll just have to wait until the end of the year for this revelation.\n\nSo, these are just a few of the movies I’m thankful for this year, along with some cinematic turkeys.\n\nThanks for reading, and wishing you a happy holiday season!\n\nGobble! Gobble!\n\n—Michael\n\nWelcome back to THE HORROR JAR, that column where we look at all things horror. Up today the films of Willis O’Brien, or more specifically, the films in which O’Brien’s amazing stop motion animation effects graced the screen.\n\nWith the Thanksgiving holiday around the corner, O’Brien is on my mind, because years ago, for whatever reason, a popular triple feature on Thanksgiving day used to be KING KONG (1933), SON OF KONG (1933), and MIGHTY JOE YOUNG (1949), and while actor Robert Armstrong appeared in all three of these giant monkey movies, the true common denominator among this trio of films is special effects master Willis O’Brien, who did the effects for all three films.\n\nWith that in mind, here’s a brief look at the magical career of Willis O’Brien:\n\nTHE DINOSAUR AND THE MISSING LINK: A PREHISTORIC TRAGEDY (1915) – directed by Willis O’Brien. O’Brien’s first screen credit, a five-minute comedy short. He both directed this one and created the stop motion effects.\n\nTHE LOST WORLD (1925) – the first film version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s tale about a land where dinosaurs still exist remains arguably the best film version of Conan Doyle’s novel. O’Brien’s special effects are wonderful and a nice precursor to the work he would do eight years later on KING KONG (1933). The conclusion of the film where the Brontosaurus goes on a rampage through the streets of London is a major highlight.\n\nKING KONG (1933) – one of the greatest movies of all time, the original KING KONG is required viewing for all movie buffs. With apologies to actors Fay Wray, Robert Armstrong, and Bruce Cabot, who are all very good in this movie, to directors Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, and to screenwriters James Ashmore Creelman and Ruth Rose, the reason KING KONG remains a masterpiece, and the reason to see this one over and over again, is the stop motion animation effects by Willis O’Brien.\n\nThe special effects in KING KONG are nothing short of spectacular. They hold up well even today. The level of depth on Kong’s island is unbelievable, and the attention to detail uncanny. O’Brien’s team used painted glass plates to create the plush dense forest backgrounds, and many scenes feature human actors and animated creatures in the same shot creating a seamless world that looks as authentic as it is imaginative.\n\nStop motion effects required the use of miniature models— Kong was 18 inches tall— moved by technicians one film frame at a time, an arduous process that would take an entire afternoon just to complete one second of screen time.\n\nOf course, O’Brien also enjoyed some luck. He feared he would be fired when in test shots he could see the imprints of his technicians’ hands on Kong’s fur. Yet when the producers watched the film they applauded him for his attention to detail for making Kong’s fur move in the wind.\n\nIn short, with his animation techniques, O’Brien gave birth to one of the mightiest screen monsters of all time, King Kong, a character who still appears in movies even today.\n\nKING KONG also boasts a memorable music score by Max Steiner.\n\nSON OF KONG (1933) – rushed sequel to KING KONG can best be described as KING KONG LITE. Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) returns to Kong’s island in search of treasure and discovers Kong’s less ferocious and somewhat friendly son there. Light and amusing. O’Brien’s special effects, while not as mind-blowing as his work on the original, remain a highlight.\n\nMIGHTY JOE YOUNG (1049) – Kong creators Ernest B. Schoedsack and Merian C. Cooper return with yet another giant ape story, again starring Robert Armstrong, who plays a Carl Denham clone named Max O’Hara. The film is most notable for O’Brien’s protegé stepping up to do most of the stop motion animation effects here. His protege? Ray Harryhausen, who would go on to create the best stop motion effects aside from KING KONG over the next thirty years in a career that spanned from this movie until the early 1980s. MIGHTY JOE YOUNG is actually a much better film than SON OF KONG, yet it did not perform well at the box office, and plans for a sequel JOE MEETS TARZAN were never completed.\n\nTHE BLACK SCORPION (1957) -standard 1950s giant monster science fiction film, this time featuring giant scorpions in Mexico City. Decent Willis O’Brien special effects.\n\nTHE GIANT BEHEMOTH (1959) – radiation again is to blame for awaking yet another dinosaur in this typical 1950s giant monster tale. Not O’Brien’s finest hour. The special effects are okay but are clearly inferior to the work that Ray Harryhausen was doing at the time, with films like THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS (1953) and THE 7TH VOYAGE OF SINBAD (1958).\n\nTHE LOST WORLD (1960) – O’Brien’s career comes full circle with this remake of the 1925 silent film, this one directed by Irwin Allen. Okay movie, with a decent cast that included Michael Rennie, Jill St. John, David Hedison, and Claude Rains. This one should have been better, mainly because O’Brien’s work wasn’t even used here!\n\nHuh?\n\nO’Brien was hired to work on the film because Irwin Allen wanted to use stop motion animation effects for the dinosaurs, but budget constraints forced Allen to use real lizards instead, which led to far inferior special effects. As a result, although given effects technician credit, O’Brien’s work on this film was largely restricted to conceptual drawings which were never used.\n\nO’Brien passed away on November 8, 1962 from a heart attack at the age of 76.\n\nWillis O’Brien will be forever remembered for creating some of the most incredible special effects in motion picture history for his work on KING KONG (1933).\n\nAnd you can’t go wrong with O’Brien’s giant ape trilogy, KING KONG (1933), SON OF KONG (1933), and MIGHTY JOE YOUNG (1949). Should these be playing on a TV near you this Thanksgiving, be sure to check them out.\n\nThat’s it for now. Thanks for joining me for this edition of THE HORROR JAR where we celebrated the career of special effects mastermind Willis H. O’Brien, and I hope you join me again next time when we’ll look at other topics regarding horror movies.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n—Michael"
