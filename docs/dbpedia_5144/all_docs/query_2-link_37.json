        "text": "The Military Intelligence Directorate is subordinate financially, administratively, and armament-wise to the Ministry of Defence. However, the Minister of Defence does not exercise any power over it. Instead, the Directorate intervenes in the Minister of Defence’s, his Deputies’, and the Chiefs of the Defence Staff’s appointments. It also interferes with the transfers of officers and army personnel. Moreover, the Directorate’s Director is appointed by the President. The Military Intelligence Directorate is considered the security arm of the army institution and armed forces that is present within the society. It is also responsible for monitoring the conduct of military personnel, who are mostly seconded from military units of various specialities, based on the regime’s standards of loyalty and affiliation. It has a number of branches, including Branch 235 (Palestine Branch), Branch 291 (Damascus), Branch 293 (the Officers Branch), Branch 248 (Damascus), Branch 227 (Damascus), Branch 215 (Damascus), Branch 245 (Daraa), Branch 271 (Idlib), Homs Branch, Branch 223 (Latakia), Aleppo Branch, and the Investigation Branch. It is US-sanctioned and EU-sanctioned, and it was added to the UK sanctions list on 24 August 2011."
