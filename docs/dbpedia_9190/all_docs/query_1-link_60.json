I didn't know that Italy was harking back to Ancient Rome already, even before Mussolini.\n\nI thought that was interesting, too.\n\nHere's a bit more info.\n\nThe motif of Cybele in a quadriga drawn by a team of lions is a common one in the ancient world. One of the most famous depictions of this scene is on the Parabiago Plate, found near Milan in 1907. The piece dates from the 4th-5th century, AD. It can be seen in the Archeological Museum, Milan:\n\nAnother depiction is this bronze statuette of Cybele in a cart drawn by lions from the second half of the second century, AD. It can be seen at the Metropolitan Museum of Art:\n\nKing Vittorio Emanuele III (1900-1946) was an avid numismatist (his personal collection is now in the National Museum), who was responsible for Italian coinage featuring highly artistic designs, often inspired by ancient types. A couple of other examples of what he inspired:\n\nAlbanian coins featuring Herakles and the Nemean Lion and Alexander the Great:\n\nAnd an Israeli coin featuring an ancient Judaean coin:\n\nI recently bought some paper currency\n\nI admittedly did not buy this for any classical allusions, but more because I find it interesting that the confiscated church property during the Revolution was used to back the currency. I can now say I own some property in France\n\nInspired by Augustus?\n\nAR fifty lepta, struck for Greece at the Paris mint 1868 (rare), 1874 (common) and 1883 (somewhat scarce).
