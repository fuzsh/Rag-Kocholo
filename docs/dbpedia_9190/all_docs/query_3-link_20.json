        "text": "Dad and daughter signing in at Owl Point in 2016 (photo courtesy of Sergey Kiselev)\n\nMaking time for this blog is always a challenge, given my day job, caring for family and a broken-down old house… and all the other distractions in life that we ALL tend to! So, I’m a bit tardy with this article. But to be candid, it’s the political chaos unfolding at the national level in this election year that has been on my mind in a big way, making it hard to think about the places and things I care about most, right here in WyEast country. I also know I’m hardly alone in being discouraged and fearful about what the November election might bring for our country. It’s a crazy time in America. Again.\n\nThen I had a breakthrough last week. I was up at my beloved Owl Point, on Mount Hood’s north side, scouting for an upcoming trail stewardship event. While there, I was doing my annual tending to the summit register I placed there in 2012. It’s a simple setup: a painted steel ammo box with some maps and photos of the area and a simple log book for folks to sign.\n\nTwelve tough years in the elements, and the Owl Point Register is still holding up in 2024!\n\nWhen I placed it back in in the fall of 2012, I didn’t expect a big response. Though the Old Vista Ridge trail to Owl Point had been re-opened by volunteers five years prior, in the summer of 2007, it was still only lightly visited. The Forest Service would not formally recognize the trail as “maintained” for another five years. Looking back now — twelve years later — more than 1,000 entries by individuals, couples, families, hiking groups and even the occasional dog fill 272 pages (and counting) that have now spilled into a third edition of the register!\n\nGiven its popularity, I’ve always fretted about the box being vandalized or stolen, thus losing all those entries and the wonderful personal histories they contain. Therefore, whenever I’m up at Owl Point I take photos of the latest entries as a backup, of sorts. In this way, I’ve maintained a running digital (so to speak) version of the register since the very beginning.\n\nIt was in this context of capturing the latest entries that I came across the following message last week. It had been entered last October, just before the winter snows closed in on Owl Point:\n\nReading Danielle’s brave, vulnerable message immediately broke through the political noise, dread and polarization that has been swirling in my head in this miserable election season. It reminded me that the antidote to all of the toxicity washing over our society right was right in front of me – Mount Hood towering above and Danielle’s personal testament in my hands. It was a needed reminder of the limitless restorative powers of just being out in nature, rediscovering who we are and what we care about most, and being reminded that we’re always stronger than we think.\n\nAnd therein was the breakthrough for me: return my own focus to being an active advocate and steward for our natural landscapes right here in WyEast Country: for a better future for Mount Hood and the Gorge and for the trails that provide access for everyone to our precious public lands.\n\nRestoring my focus back to these things that matter most to me, and making time to be outside in nature has already helped provide me the renewed sense of hope and perspective I’ll need to make a difference this fall — and beyond. It was always there, but Danielle’s messages was the reminder I needed to look past the discouraging distractions and toward things that I can directly impact right here in my corner of the world.\n\nMount Hood shining under a brilliant summer sky last week in this view from Owl Point – the highlight of the Old Vista Ridge trail\n\nAnd thus, this article. It’s simply a collection of highlights that I’ve selection from the hundreds of messages posted in the Owl Point Register since 2012. I’ve chosen them based upon the joy, hope, graciousness and good humor they offer. They range from poignant and spiritual to whimsical and silly. Yet, in every message you can feel how just being there at Owl Point, taking in that amazing scene, has inspired these messages. The first batch of selections spans the first five seasons, from fall 2012 through 2016. Part 2 of this article will draw highlights from 2017 through the present.\n\nI hope these will resonate with you as they do with me, perhaps restoring some much-needed hope and faith in humanity for you, as well, in this crazy, consequential time we are living in.\n\nIt all started in October 2012…\n\nThe freshly painted Owl Point Register on the day it was placed – October 17, 2012. The ammo can was from Andy & Bax in Portland (the iconic store recently closed, ending an era). I added a coat of army-green Rustoleum and some shaky, hand-painted lettering…\n\nThe Owl Point Register came about as part of a plan to bring more folks to the (then) little-known Old Vista Ridge trail, with an eye toward creating broader awareness of this largely unknown corner of Mount Hood’s backcountry. The register not only lets visitors share their thoughts with those who follow in their footsteps, it also describes the rich history of the area, and has maps and a photo guide to the features on Mount Hood that they can study as they take in the view.\n\nIn 2009, President Obama signed an expansion of the Mount Hood Wilderness into law that pushed the protected area north by about a mile, to where it now follows much of the Old Vista Ridge trail as the official wilderness boundary. It was a welcome recognition of the restored trail and an overdue expansion of protections for the mountain, yet still leaves the rugged country north of the trail unprotected. Thus, the continued goal to make the area known to hikers who can help advocate for its future. As recently as 2008, the Forest Service had proposed an off-road vehicle “play area” for Owl Point and Old Vista Ridge, so the risks of losing this wild place are still very real.\n\nOld Vista Ridge Jedi-volunteer Jamie Chabot becoming one of the first to sign the new register on a foggy day in November 2012\n\nWithin the first year, the register began to fill with messages from hikers. Many were astonished at the “new” view from Owl Point that the trail provided – one of the finest of the mountain, and yet largely unknown at the time. There were also many kudos for those who had rescued the Old Vista Ridge trail and continued to restore this historic route. This was especially rewarding to the handful of trail volunteers doing the work, as it was still unofficial, and there was no guarantee that the Forest Service would eventually recognize the trail, even in its restored state.\n\nThe opening message in the register was written by me on October 17, with a bit of an introduction to Owl Point:\n\nI’d forgotten until preparing this article that I also recorded scattering the ashes of my beloved grandparents on that first day! They had asked me to someday place their remains on Mount Hood, and there simply was simply no better place than Owl Point. I still check in with them every time I’m up there – and they always report that they’re enjoying the amazing view!\n\n2013\n\nThe register began to really catch on during its first full season at Owl Point, in 2013. Among the early surprises: international visitors… to Owl Point? It turns out this hike description that I wrote in the Oregon Hikers Field Guide had reached far beyond the shadow of Mount Hood to wherever internet access existed. In this case, all the way to Saipan:\n\n…and soon, more international visitors to Owl Point – from Austria:\n\n…and from France!\n\nThe postscript from the French visitors surprised me, too! I don’t know that Americans have any better track record than Europeans when it comes to respecting public spaces, but I do think that the particular slice of humanity that is willing to walk two miles into a wilderness for a mountain view does. Hikers are good people.\n\n2014\n\nAs the popularity of the Old Vista Ridge trail continued to grow, entries in the Owl Point Register began to include organized hiking groups, like this one:\n\nEvery year, I’ve also added my own entries to help me track the changes since my last visit. Here’s a message from a trail tending trip in 2014 with Jeff Statt, another Jedi-volunteer. As you can see, seeing other hikers on the trail was still a novelty at the time and very rewarding:\n\nSo, what did the mountain look like on that June day in 2014? Like this:\n\nThe view from Owl Point in June 2014\n\nHere’s Jedi Jeff reading some of the latest entries in the register on that day back in 2014:\n\nJedi-volunteer Jeff Statt reading the Owl Point Register in 2014\n\nAmong my favorite entries over the years are those from young families. I had the good fortune of growing up with an outdoors-oriented family, an experience that has since shaped every aspect of my life. Thus, I love to see young parents adventuring into the forest with their kids. In this case, parents Mike and Brittany signed in with a bunch of kids in July 2014:\n\nThis notable entry in 2014 is from documentary film maker Christopher Alley, made on a scouting trip to Owl Point:\n\nChris (white shirt in the photo, below) returned the next year with his crew, and I was privileged to come along for the ride. Spending time with them ranks among the best adventures I’ve stumbled into in my life.\n\nDocumentary filmmaker Chris Alley and his crew at Owl Point in 2015\n\nPlenty of close friendships are shared in the Owl Point Register, too – along with many Owl-themed sketches and memes:\n\nSo, where did Owl Point get its name? No, not from any official proclamation or map. I confess: I made it up! But that backstory will have to wait until a future article…\n\nBy the fall of 2014, the register was filling up fast, often with reflective messages from visitors near and far – like this introspective pair from North Carolina:\n\nOften visitors are inspired to include ballpoint art of Mount Hood, like this entry from October 2014:\n\nI’m a visual thinker, too, so I do appreciate the urge to draw when inspired – thank you, Francesca!\n\n2015\n\nReunited with my college friend David in May 2015\n\nThe Old Vista Ridge trail to Owl Point has become one of my go-to hikes with out-of-town visitors looking for a Mount Hood adventure. Such was the case in the spring of 2015 when my college roommate David Shafer (above, with me) was in town. David is originally from Portland, so while he’s been in Colorado for many years, now, he still knows his Hood – as you can tell from his message in the Owl Point Register:\n\nI’m not the only person who brings out-of-towners to Owl Point – in this case, sibling escaping to the mountain in June 2015:\n\nFor the record, in the years since this message was posted, those confusing junctions have largely been resolved, and signs posted at those that remain, so fewer folks are getting turned around on the route to the Owl Point trailhead.\n\nThe spectacular view of Mount Hood from Owl Point has inspired many spiritual reflections in the register over the years – like this one:\n\nThis 2015 message from a Chinese visitor came complete with Mandarin and English praises for our mountain:\n\nContinuing the out-of-town theme, these visitors from Oregon, Texas and Sydney, Australia made the trip on consecutive days in June of 2015:\n\n…though the meaning of the Aussie message is lost in translation for me!\n\nHere’s another from around the world, this time a reflective message from a Russian visitor seeking the restorative power that is so specific to time spent alone on a mountain trail:\n\nHere’s another spiritual sentiment from 2015 that I can sign onto…\n\n…and on the same day, two families taking dad out for a hike on Father’s Day recorded this:\n\nStill another family (and their dog) and some visitors from Idaho left this entry in June 2015:\n\nThese youngsters left a message in June 2015:\n\nNo doubt Eli and Tyson enjoyed the view, but one of the best parts of having a summit register is watching kids’ eyes light up when they see it. I don’t know how much they absorb from its contents, but they DO love to open the box and unpack it!\n\nThis message from a pair of especially energetic hikers caught my eye:\n\nOne of my goals is to eventually complete a trail connecting Old Vista Ridge to Laurance Lake, something the Forest Service has already agreed to in concept, at least. This would allow for a very long wilderness loop for backpackers that connects Owl Point to the Timberline Trail via Elk Cove and WyEast Basin.\n\nHere’s the first post from a Vermonter…\n\n…and this is an enthusiastic message from one of the formal hiking groups that have added Owl Point to their annual offerings. These folks were in an older group of 60+ “spring chickens” from Portland:\n\nSecond only to seeing young kids on the trail, I do love to see older hikers on outings like this. They inspire me, as I’m now in their cohort (ahem!) at age 62, and they seem – make that, they ARE – among the happiest, most contented people I know!\n\nStill more out-of-towners, this time two South Carolinians celebrating an anniversary – another surprisingly common theme among visitors to Owl Point:\n\n…and still more out-of-towners visiting WyEast country in July 2015 (with their dog) – this time from Detroit and San Francisco:\n\nAs had been the case for several years, I was joined once again by Jedi-volunteers Jamie and Jeff in the summer of 2015 for more trail tending (below). At this point in its restoration, the Old Vista Ridge trail was starting to look like it had never been abandoned, with the growing number of boots on the trail making it look well used and well loved.\n\nOld Vista Ridge Jedi-volunteers Jeff Statt and Jamie Chabot\n\nThis message from July 2015 is a first for the register – a marriage proposal! These folks were visiting from Minnesota:\n\n…and naturally she said “yes”! It’s the Owl Point effect, and this is just one of my life events that have been recorded in the Owl Point register over the past 12 years.\n\nSometimes complete strangers become acquaintances by virtue of meeting on a trail like Old Vista Ridge, as seems to be the case with these visitors:\n\nMore out-of-towners, this time hecking the box for visitors to the Upper Left corner of the country from the Lower Right corner:\n\nThis eclectic group took me a few reads to figure out, but we seem to have five out-of-towners (two from the U.K.) visiting a Portlander:\n\nSometimes visitors leave big, bold messages of hope – like this one from August 2015:\n\n…and sometimes there’s just anonymous whimsey… or maybe not?\n\nThe above time machine message was just too much for this youngster to resist a few days later:\n\nAha! So, cavemen eat hikers, too? Well, I’ll just add them to the list with mosquitos and black flies… and dinosaurs.\n\nPlace a summit register in front of a stunning mountain view, and you often find entries from people experiencing a crossroad in their life or celebrating a personal milestone. This message is such a great example. I’ve included an enlargement of the sidebar on the left (which is a bit difficult to read), as this is the crux of the message from this transplanted New Yorker:\n\nEnlarged view of the reflective sidebar:\n\nThe challenge of a new trail, the experience of being in a deep forest, the vastness of a mountain view spreading out before you and the satisfaction of reaching your destination. This seems to inspire so many visitors to Owl Point to step away from the background noise of their daily lives and allow needed time for reflection and restoring the sense of peace of gratitude that we all need. I know it has this effect on me, every time I go there.\n\nMore out-of-towners in 2015, this time from Wisconsin and Missouri:\n\nAnd another New Yorker, this time a young person in their mid-20s joining their grandmother’s hiking group for the trip to Owl Point. There are many family entries like this, and they underscore the role trails can play in creating experiences that bridge generations and bond our relationships:\n\nOn the theme of family bonding, Jedi-volunteer Jamie Chabot wasn’t all work at Owl Point back in 2015. Here, he made a point of bringing his young boys to walk the trail their dad helped build:\n\nJamie is a single dad, so making the time to help restore the Old Vista Ridge trail and provide his boys with an outdoor-oriented life takes real effort. Hopefully his boys (below, with Jamie, in early 2015) will hike this trail for many decades to come, knowing that their dad played an important part in making it happen!\n\nJedi-volunteer Jamie Chabot on the trail with his boys in 2015\n\nHere are still more grateful out-of-staters admiring our backyard in 2015 – these folks are from South Carolina and Wisconsin:\n\nOne of the final entries recorded in the fall of 2015 is what mindfulness and gratitude are all about. This is why public lands, and the trails that allow us to experience them, matter so much in our modern world:\n\n2016\n\nWhile this year’s election year turmoil has brought back unwelcome flashbacks to the 2016 election debacle, that year was especially lovely at Owl Point. The Beargrass bloom cycle was enjoying one of its peak years (below) and a healthy snowpack on the mountain lingered well into summer.\n\nSummer 2016 brought a spectacular Beargrass bloom to Owl Point\n\nThese grateful hikers were among the first to hike the trail in 2016 when they visited on Memorial Day, likely crossing a few snow patches along the way and leaving a reflective message of thanks and appreciation in the summit register:\n\nThis coming-of-age message from the same day in 2016 is among my favorites, as I was also 16 when I completed my own first solo overnight hike on Mount Hood:\n\nSamuel is 24 years old, now, wherever he might be. Hopefully, this early confidence-builder will continue to be one of those childhood formative experiences that keep us pushing forward throughout our adult lives. I know it was for me – I still remember that first solo trip like it was yesterday!\n\nHere are a pair of dog messages from the same day in June 2016 – the second one is especially inspired… in an offbeat, Steven Wright way:\n\nThe Old Vista Ridge trail is a great option for dogs. It’s largely forest traveling, with plenty of shade and a soft trail surface that’s easy on their pads. It’s also uncrowded, making it easier to navigate with your pup and avoid unwanted interactions with other dogs. Notably, while I have seen plenty of dogs up there in the 17 years I’ve been involved with this trail, I have yet to find one of those notorious, orphaned bags of dog poop left behind – that’s quite a streak!\n\nThis message from July 2016 took me a couple of reads to figure out, but it’s both tongue-in-cheek and an earnestly triumphant message from a person just getting their trail legs under them:\n\nHere’s another favorite from that year. I love seeing families on the trail, and especially a single parent out their children. It takes a lot of commitment, but they’re doing such an important thing that will forever influence their kid’s lives:\n\n(…and apologies for my thumb in a few of these – they were all taken up at Owl Point, and quite often I was battling the wind to hold the pages down with one hand while shooting the photos with the other!)\n\nHere’s another out-of-towner, this time from Hawaii – a first for the register:\n\nIn this message, WyEast country counts as Heaven on earth, and I can surely sign on to that (and no offense to Ireland):\n\nMore mountain-inspired sketch art (and my thumb, again)….\n\n…and still more art, this time from budding artists. Sure, I can see the mountain! I think…\n\nI can definitely see the trees! Thank you for the fine art, Allison and Christine – and yes, it is beautiful.\n\nJedi-volunteers Jeff and Jamie clearing winter blowdown on the Old Vista Ridge trail in July 2016\n\nA good number of messages in the register share the frustration at our unpredictable weather that the example below carries. Yet, these messages invariably end with deep appreciation for time spent in the mountains, even if “the friendly giant Mount Hood” is hiding in the clouds. As the saying goes, “there are no bad days on the trail”:\n\nStill another New Yorker shared a message in 2016, this time a visitor from upstate – plus a couple of local dogs give two paws up on the view:\n\nAnd yet another anniversary celebration that year….\n\nThis message from 2016 is significant for the mention of William Sullivan’s guidebook:\n\nSullivan added the Old Vista Ridge trail to his fourth edition of the popular Northwest Oregon hiking guide, published in 2013. This edition followed both the reopening of trail by volunteers, and the 2011 Dollar Lake Fire that torched the nearby Vista Ridge Trail. The fire left Old Vista Ridge and Owl Point untouched, which Sullivan describes as a shady, green alternatives to the better-known trails that now traverse the burn. Sullivan’s guide surely sent a few more hikers from well-beyond WyEast country to the trail.\n\nHere’s a wonderful pair of messages from August 2016 that simply celebrate a friendship:\n\nThis brief message stands out for the location. The farm community of Parkdale is plainly visible from Owl Point, directly below, in the Upper Hood River valley. While it’s fun to see entries in the register from all over the world, it’s especially rewarding to know that local residents are enjoying this trail, too:\n\nHere’s a fun message that covers a lot of ground, from corny jokes to a new life together that hikers Allie and Tom were about to embark upon:\n\nBonus points to this couple for the owl sketch and symbolism! Hopefully, they can still return to Owl Point once in a while to recharge and remember this significant day for them back in 2016.\n\nJeff and Jamie relaxing on the rocks at Owl Point after a day of trail work in July 2016…\n\n…where the view is the reward!\n\nStill more out-of-staters in the register in 2016, this time from Scott and Grant in Georgia:\n\nI googled it, and that last part refers to the Georgia Institute of Technology mascot – the Yellow Jackets! Georgia Tech is located in downtown Atlanta and Cumming is a northern suburb.\n\nHere’s a message from September 2016 that jumps from a simple weather report to being surprisingly philosophical:\n\nThis message is straightforward, but “my favorite hike” is always music to my ears when it comes to Old Vista Ridge and Owl Point:\n\n…and then there’s this message that still resonates today – or echoes, perhaps?\n\nNote the date. The country was in the middle of deeply divisive political meltdown that fall, just as we find ourselves in today. As the current election cycle looms, this message from eight years ago is such a good reminder to take time out and gain perspective in that way that a day on the mountain can provide. The sound of wind and scent of a mountain forest really can help drown out the unwelcome echoes from everyday life that we often carry with us.\n\nJust a few days ahead of the 2016 election, Rex and Jay were poetic in this message – though I still can’t figure out what “somambucent” means!\n\nThat fall brought a lot of reflective comments to the Owl Point register. Here are a pair of messages left on the Sunday before the 2016 election – one from a philosopher and the other a first-timer to our mountains:\n\n..and on that same November Sunday, a pair of visitors with multiple aliases left this tongue-in-cheek ode to determination “to be read in a deep, raspy voice”. I chose Orson Welles:\n\nThis message – left three days after the 2016 election – serves as yet another reminder that we’ll always need our trails (and the public lands they lead us into) as a counterbalance to the twists and turns of everyday life. Trails help us reconnect with “what is truly important in our lives” when we most need to restore that faith.\n\nI’m quoting Patty and Lynn (and Theodore and Mighty Dog) on that part, as they said exactly that in this final message in the Owl Point register for 2016:\n\nReading through these messages eight year later reminded me that we did, in fact, survive that election cycle. While real harm was done to our democracy (and to our public lands) during the four years that followed, we also lived another day to work toward “that more perfect union”. With progress comes setbacks – and 2016 was a doozy.\n\nNobody knows what more the 2024 election will bring this fall, though we’re off to a very rough start. Being alone with the view on that stellar, crystal-clear day up at Owl Point last week, and reading through the many hopeful, joyful and gracious messages left in the summit register restored a bit of my faith in humanity. In the end, we have so much more in common than the political battles might suggest.\n\nThe messages also reminded me to block out the political noise (and now violence, sadly) in this election cycle and sharpen my focus on being an active advocate and steward for trails and public lands. Yes, my vote might make a difference in the fall election, but I know I can make a difference right here in WyEast Country. That’s where I need to keep my head and heart through this turbulent time we’re in.\n\n_____________\n\nThe author getting his head straight (once again) at Owl Point on July 11, 2024\n\nIn Part 2 of this article I’ll continue with more highlights from the Owl Point Register from 2017 to the present. This was an especially positive era for the Old Vista Ridge trail, despite the dysfunctional national political backdrop… and a global pandemic! More than ever, the trails were our inspiration and refuge, and Old Vista Ridge delivered.\n\nMore to come!\n\nTom Kloster | July 2024\n\nOneonta Gorge in the 1890s\n\nOneonta Gorge has been around since the ice age Missoula Floods shaped much of the modern landscape in the Columbia River Gorge 14,000 years ago. Yet, in the past 125 years this exquisite work of nature has endured new threats brought on by the explosion of an especially pernicious invasive species: us!\n\nThe past two decades have been especially unkind to Oneonta Gorge, with a massive wave of flip-flop wearing visitors drawn here by the invention of social media, followed by a catastrophic human-caused fire in 2017. This article is a retrospective on how we arrived at this crossroad, and what the future might hold for beautiful Oneonta Gorge.\n\n1900-1940s: Early days at Oneonta…\n\nRailroad tracks had arrived at Oneonta Bluff by the 1880s\n\nFirst peoples in the Pacific Northwest populated the Columbia River Gorge by the thousands for millennia, and they no doubt knew about and visited places like Oneonta Gorge, just as we do today. But it wasn’t until the transcontinental railroad was connected through the Gorge on the Oregon side in 1882 that white settlement began in earnest. Most of the early focus was on logging the big trees grew on the Gorge slopes and harvesting the seemingly endless salmon runs in the river.\n\nThat changed in the 1890s when a new stream of visitors began to follow the rails into the Gorge. Tourists, mostly from Portland, seeking the scenic wonders at each of the train stops along the way. In fact, some of the earliest parks in the Gorge were originally owned and operated by the City of Portland (including Multnomah Falls) to serve the growing interest.\n\nHighway surveyor – possibly Samuel Lancaster, himself –pointing to the site of the future Oneonta Tunnel in the early 1910s\n\nThe trickle turned to a tidal wave in the early 1900s, when local entrepreneur Sam Hill and his visionary road designer Samuel Lancaster opened the world-class Columbia River Highway to automobiles. Known today as the Historic Columbia River Highway, the artfully designed new road brought visitors to the Gorge by the thousands by the time it was completed in 1922, with dozens of roadside inns and restaurants springing up to serve the steady stream of motorists.\n\nAt Oneonta Gorge, Samuel Lancaster navigated a pinch point where the railroad tracks crowded the base of Oneonta Bluff by blasting a tunnel through the cliff for the new road. From the bridge at the west approach to the new tunnel, visitors also had a stunning view directly into Oneonta Gorge from their automobiles. As with other scenic spots along the road, Lancaster designed a pullout and even engineered a short, winding staircase down to the cool waters of Oneonta Creek that he knew tourists would want to explore.\n\nMotorists emerging from the Oneonta Tunnel in the late 1910s\n\nThe east portal to the Oneonta Tunnel in the 1920s shows how the new highway was threaded between the vertical walls of Oneonta Bluff and the railroad – the pinch point that required construction of the tunnel\n\nCuriosity inspired more intrepid visitors to wade into Oneonta Gorge, discovering that at the south end of the 1/3 mile long box canyon you are rewarded with a rare view of beautiful Oneonta Falls. Soon, the word was out, kicking off would be become a century of weekend adventurers making their way through the narrow gorge.\n\nDespite its unique beauty and proximity to the new road, Oneonta Gorge was spared commercial development in the early days of motorists flocking to the new highway, when tourist stops dotted the route at many of the popular scenic spots.\n\nIn the 1920s and 30s, most of the forest trails we know today were constructed by the Forest Service and Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) to bring hikers to the series of waterfalls in the upper canyon of Oneonta Creek. These trails offered new views into Oneonta Gorge from above, though wading the creek remained the only way to reach Oneonta Falls.\n\nVisitors at Oneonta Gorge in the early 1900s\n\nAs the popularity of the area grew, the first photos from within Oneonta Gorge and of Oneonta Falls begin to appear in postcards, travel guides and tourist folios from this era. The pair that follow from the 1930s track a hiker (perhaps the photographer?) exploring Oneonta Gorge in late summer, when the water levels are typically low. Well into the 1990s, the trip through Oneonta Gorge was much like this, with just a few knee-deep pools to navigate in reaching the falls.\n\nOneonta Gorge and hiker in the 1930s\n\nOneonta Falls and hiker in the 1930s\n\nThis postcard view (below) from the 1930s is notable in showing boulders and a large log blocking Oneonta Gorge. From my own experiences there, the route was clear of debris on this scale from the mid-1970s until the rockfall that triggered the modern logjam in the late 1990s. What happened to the debris in this photo? They were simply broken up and swept away.\n\n1930s postcard showing boulders and logs in Oneonta Gorge similar to today\n\nOneonta Gorge was created by a perpetual cycle of erosion, with the stream continually undercutting the vertical basalt walls, then clearing boulders and debris that periodically collapses into the stream. During high runoff events from November through March, Oneonta Creek can become a raging torrent, with enormous hydraulic force that can easily move whole trees and large boulders downstream, eventually breaking them apart into smaller, even more easily transported rock and debris the process (more on that toward the end of this article).\n\nThe tunnel at Oneonta Creek was an uncomfortably tight squeeze for passing vehicles from the beginning, so when the railroads moved their tracks away from cliffs of Oneonta Bluff sometime in the early 1940s, ODOT took the opportunity to move the road and bypass the old tunnel.\n\nOneonta Tunnel in the early 1940s with the relocated railroad line already away from the bluff\n\nThe tunnel bypass involved constructing a new bridge over Oneonta Creek (below), immediately adjacent to the old bridge. Both bridges survive today, with the newer bridge serving as the Historic Columbia River Highway route and the original bridge leading pedestrians and cyclists to the restored Oneonta Tunnel.\n\n“New” highway bridge bypassing the Oneonta Tunnel under construction in 1948. The original bridge can be seen on the left\n\nThe tunnel bypass was completed in 1948 (below), and both ends of the Oneonta Tunnel were blocked with fill to prevent access. The original highway stub over the old bridge was left in place as a wayside for visitors to Oneonta Gorge.\n\nThe completed bypass in the early 1950s with the old tunnel blocked with fill\n\nThe Oneonta Tunnel bypass in 1948 was part of a larger effort by the Oregon Highway Division to realign the original Columbia River Highway as a river-level route, completely bypassing whole sections, including the famous loops that climb over Crown Point and Rowena Crest.\n\nMuch of this work was completed by the early 1950s, but in 1956 the federal Interstate and Defense Highways Act set construction of today’s Interstate-84 in motion, relegating the original versions of the Columbia River Highway to scenic routes in some areas, and being completely abandoned in others.\n\nThat might have been the end of the story for the mothballed Oneonta Tunnel, save for the following provision in the 1986 Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area legislation:\n\nThis unique provision was way ahead of its time in our country by recognizing the historic and recreation value of old, “obsolete” roadways. Since then, ODOT has steadily worked toward this bold vision with a string of exceptional restoration projects. As we approach the 40th anniversary of the scenic area legislation, a completely restored and reconnected historic route from Portland to The Dalles is on track to become a reality.\n\n2003-09: Restoring the Oneonta tunnel and bridge\n\nODOT renovated the original Oneonta Bridge in the 2003\n\nAt Oneonta, the historic highway restoration included renovating the original highway bridge (above) and reopening the Samuel Lancaster’s original tunnel (below) after fifty years of closure. The 1948 tunnel bypass allowed for this segment to be reimagined as a pedestrian route, bringing visitors through the restored tunnel to a dramatic view from the historic bridge into Oneonta Gorge.\n\nThe newly excavated Oneonta Tunnel in 2006\n\nRestoration of the east portal to the Oneonta Tunnel in 2006\n\nRestoration of the west portal to the Oneonta Tunnel in 2006\n\nThe tunnel restoration included recreating the stonework surrounding both portals and a completely rebuilt, wood tunnel lining (below).\n\nConstruction of the wood interior lining in the restored Oneonta Tunnel\n\nThe newly restored tunnel was opened to the public in 2009. For hikers, the new route connected a hiking loop between the Oneonta and Horsetail trail systems. For motorists, it was a new place to explore among the traditional stops along the historic highway.\n\nHikers using the newly restored Oneonta Tunnel in 2009\n\nFamily exploring the newly restored Oneonta Tunnel in 2009\n\nThe Oneonta Bridge restoration included work at the west abutment, where a small alcove with an ornate bench from the original design was refurbished. This unassuming spot is one of the most delightful features in Samuel Landcaster’s vision for the highway. Knowing that visitors would want to explore, he built a tiny, winding staircase that hugs the cliff as it descends from the alcove to Oneonta Creek (below). The stairway is a fun surprise for visitors who stop, as it is not visible from the road.\n\nRestored alcove and bench at the head of the winding staircase to Oneonta Creek in 2009\n\nHistoric winding staircase at Oneonta Creek in 2009\n\nLooking down the historic winding staircase at Oneonta Creek in 2009\n\nWhen these carefully crafted restoration efforts at Oneonta were finally opened to the public in 2009, few could imagine the impact that social media was about to unleash in the Gorge. Facebook had been founded in 2004, but only began its explosive growth in 2007, doubling from 50 million users to 100 million in 2008. It would reach a staggering 1 billion users by 2012. Instagram soon added to the impact after it was founded in 2010, reaching 10 million users within a year and 1 billion users by 2018.\n\n2010: The logjam + social media era…\n\nThe Oneonta logjam in 2011\n\nWhen you consider the recreation infrastructure in the Gorge – the trails, campground, picnic sites, scenic highway, Vista House and the lodge at Multnomah Falls – are much the same as they were in the 1930s, it’s surprising that the exponential growth in visitors in recent decades hasn’t been more destructive. That said, the arrival of social media, and its ability to concentrate large crowds overnight, impacted the Gorge, and especially Oneonta, like no nothing before.\n\nCompounding the “Instagram-effect” of social media in the years that followed reopening of the tunnel, the pair of van-sized boulders that had collapsed into the lower entrance to Oneonta Gorge in the late 1990s had stacked up enough logs to become a true hazard to cross. In the beginning, the boulders themselves weren’t difficult to navigate, but as log pile continued to grow, crossing the obstacle became a risky venture for social media novices drawn here by nothing more than a viral Instagram selfie.\n\nThe Forest Service had posted a hazard warning around 2010, but Oneonta Gorge remained opened to the crowds that were growing exponentially each summer, and the signs went completely unnoticed by the growing horde.\n\nLogjam warning sign in 2011\n\nThe growing summer crowds at Oneonta Gorge were beginning to impact the newly restored Oneonta Tunnel, as well. For anyone who loves the Gorge, it was maddening to see vandalism to the pristine wood lining in the tunnel when it started to appear in 2012. The heavy crowds eventually impacted other features, including damage to the railing on the historic, winding staircase (below) and the fragile ecosystem of Oneonta Gorge, itself. It was a classic tragedy of the commons in the making, with the Forest Service seemingly paralyzed from intervening.\n\nVandalism began to appear in the Oneonta Tunnel by 2013\n\nDamaged staircase railing at Oneonta in 2013\n\nBy 2015, the full brunt of social media – now including still more youth-oriented online platforms, like SnapChat and Reddit – was all too apparent at Oneonta Gorge. Summertime traffic came to a standstill on the old highway, with parked cars lining the shoulders in both directions and overflowing into the nearby Horsetail wayside.\n\nOregon photographer extraordinaire T.J. Thorne (and a friend of the blog!) captured the following images that summer that describe the mayhem in ways words cannot match.\n\nSocial media crowds overwhelming Oneonta Gorge in the summer of 2015 (T.J. Thorne)\n\nCrowds at Oneonta Gorge in the summer of 2015 (T.J. Thorne)\n\nVandalism in the tunnel spiked with the mobs, too, and by 2015 the beautifully restored walls had been almost completely destroyed by the thoughtless members of the summer crowds. Still more discouraging is that the damage was largely wrought by Millennials – a generation supposedly more in touch with environmental awareness, sustainability and mutual respect than any before it.\n\nVandalism overwhelmed the Oneonta Tunnel by 2015\n\nHeavy vandalism to Oneonta Tunnel in 2015\n\nTragically, at least one person was killed while crossing the log jam during this unhinged period, and there’s no way to know how many were injured – nor what the environmental price to the unique ecosystem in Oneonta Gorge has been from so many people pouring into this relatively tiny space. Yet, there was still no effort by the Forest Service to limit or manage access… that is, until the Eagle Creek Fire in 2017.\n\n2017: Gorge Fire… and the future?\n\nThe Eagle Creek Fire as viewed from the Washington side of the Gorge in September 2017\n\nThe Eagle Creek Fire in 2017 reset everything in the Gorge. It was the first major fire since around 1900, yet was also somewhat typical of fires that have always burned in the Gorge. The only thing new about the event was the level of human development and activity that has come to the Gorge since the last big fire, underscored by the fact that it was a human-caused fire set off by a young hiker lighting fireworks on the Eagle Creek Trail.\n\nThe Oneonta Creek watershed was hit especially hard by the fire, with much of the upper basin completely burned. The immediate aftermath of the burn was a lot of surface erosion and falling trees killed by the fire. More locally, the fire killed trees and loosened rocks and debris along the rim of Oneonta Gorge, creating an immediate hazard to anyone below.\n\nAerial view of the fire impact along Oneonta Gorge in late 201. Oneonta Falls can be seen at the far end of the gorge in this view\n\nAerial view of fire impact to Oneonta Gorge and the larger watershed in the distance in 2017\n\nOver time, the extensive burn upstream has released hundreds of logs into Oneonta Creek, with many more to come. It didn’t take long for winter storms to carry these logs and other debris downstream to Oneonta Gorge, where the logjams have now grown to epic proportions.\n\nForest Service crew documenting the growing, post-fire logjams in Oneonta Gorge in 2023 (USFS)\n\nMost of the burn was immediately closed to the public after the fire, but the Forest Service has gradually reopened much of the area as trails are cleared and the forest recovery takes hold. An exception is Oneonta Gorge, however, where the agency continues to prohibit public access.\n\nThat’s a good thing, and overdue. Nobody knows how long it will take for Oneonta Creek to clear the logjams from Oneonta Gorge, but the hazards they create should at least help the Forest Service take the time to enact a new access policy that limits when and how many people are allowed to enter the gorge.\n\nOneonta Gorge sign announcing indefinite closure following the 2017 fire\n\nStatesmen Journal outdoor reporter (and another friend of the blog!) Zach Urness recently reported on Forest Service plans to consider reopening Oneonta Gorge later in this decade. According to Zach’s reporting, the agency will consider these options for the future:\n\n1) Unrestricted access\n\n2) Complete closure to access\n\n3) Seasonal public access outside of salmon and steelhead spawning\n\n4) Open or seasonal public access with trigger points to limit use\n\nMy hope is that something like the fourth option will be pursued in the interest protecting Oneonta Gorge from being loved to death in the future. The Forest Service planning effort will begin later this year.\n\nThe Oneonta Tunnel became an inferno during the 2017 Eagle Creek Fire (USFS)\n\nThe fire had a devastating impact on the Oneonta Tunnel, as well. When I saw the above image of the tunnel in flames during the 2017 Eagle Creek Fire, I had mixed emotions: the first was sadness over the loss of this beautifully restored piece of our history, and the second was a sense of opportunity. If the tunnel were restored again, perhaps this time it could be more closely managed to prevent the grotesque scale of vandalism that had defaced it before the fire?\n\nWest portal to the Oneonta Tunnel immediately after the 2017 fire (ODOT)\n\nEast portal to the Oneonta Tunnel immediately after the 2017 fire (ODOT)\n\nIn 2020, ODOT began repairs to the Oneonta Tunnel, once again bringing it back to its original glory with a wood-lined interior. The re-restored tunnel reopened to the public in May 2021.\n\nOneonta Tunnel cleared and ready for repairs 2020\n\nRe-restored the Oneonta Tunnel in 2024\n\nVisitors exploring the reopened Oneonta Tunnel in 2024\n\nThough the Oneonta Gorge flip-flop crowds are no longer here, vandalism in the newly reopened tunnel continues, albeit at a more manageable pace. While much of the damage before the fire was from names and messages being carved into the soft wood, most of the new vandalism is in the form of spray paint tagging that bedevils our society pretty much everywhere these days. While frustrating, this damage is somewhat easier to repair – assuming ODOT has the capacity and makes it a priority to do so.\n\nWhen the agency was drawing up plans for the restoring the tunnel a second time, after the fire, I testified to the steering committee that oversees the Historic Columbia River Highway restoration work to consider gating both ends of the tunnel and having State Parks rangers lock it during off-peak hours. I still think this could dramatically reduce vandalism in the tunnel.\n\nVandalism in the tunnel continues in 2024, despite the Oneonta Gorge closure\n\nOneonta Tunnel vandalism in 2024\n\nWhat’s next for Oneonta Gorge? Mostly, a much-needed break from humanity, at least in the near-term. Hopefully, the Forest Service will opt for a long-term plan that places the ecological health of this place at the forefront, but nature has no timeline for clearing out the logs that are making it impassible right now. Over time, the force of water will win out, but that could be decades from now, perhaps longer.\n\nVisitors walking the muddy shoulder to the east portal parking pullout in 2024\n\nI’m also hopeful that ODOT will not only take action to keep pace with vandalism to the tunnel, but also continue to make minor improvements for visitors stopping to explore the tunnel and take in the view of Oneonta Gorge. One that stands out to me when I visits is the surprising lack of even a gravel path to serve the parking pullout near the east tunnel portal (above). A boot path has formed, of course, but I watched several visitors with young kids struggle between the choices of a muddy, narrow boot path and walking adjacent to traffic along the fog line of the eastbound highway lane.\n\nHorsetail-Oneonta wetlands in 2024\n\nIf you have followed this blog, you know I’ve posted several articles on Oneonta over the years.

She didn’t hold it against me…)\n\n________________\n\nTom Kloster | April 2024\n\nThe recently collapsed cliff wall along the Collawash River\n\nWe’re experiencing a bit of a geologic moment in WyEast Country, of late. A series of major cliff collapses in recent years along well-known streams has given us a unique opportunity to see the raw forces of nature at work, shaping the landscape in real time, and also to witness nature rebounding after these violent events. Most of these recent collapses have been along streams in the Columbia River Gorge, but sometime over the past two years, the Collawash River joined the trend.\n\nThe Collawash River is special. Even in a region known for pristine, spectacular rivers, the Collawash stands apart. That’s in large part due to its unique geology. The Collawash River originates in the remote, rugged Bull of the Woods Wilderness and tumbles through a deep, forested canyon, made perpetually unstable by ancient landslides that are literally pulling the steep mountain slopes on both sides toward the stream.\n\nMassive landslides create a continually changing landscape along the rugged Collawash River\n\nThe result is very active landscape along the Collawash, with hundreds of massive boulders marking past landslide events scattered along its course. The ongoing landslides, combined with recent forest fires in the Bull of the Woods Wilderness have also created epic logjams where thousands of trees dropped into the river have accumulated behind these boulders in huge piles.\n\nThe erosive action of the Collawash River against the force of these landslides has the effect of a conveyor belt. During high water, the river periodically removes debris from the actively eroding toe of the slides, which in turn, triggers more sliding. This cycle has been playing out for millennia on the Collawash, gradually carrying material from the slides downstream into the Clackamas River, then beyond, leaving only large boulders behind. In time, even the largest of these boulders eventually give way to the elements, and are carried away by the river in pieces.\n\nThe dramatic, evolving scenery along the Collawash River is shaped by massive, collding landslides pushing into the river canyon from two sides\n\nOne of the many landslides feeding into the Collawash River\n\n[click here for a large version]\n\nAlong the way, these landslides also push the Collawash River against solid rock walls along its steep course, allowing the river to gradually cut away at these, as well. Like the erosive process described in this recent article, a solid rock wall that has been persistently undercut by the river eventually collapses, adding still more boulders and loose debris to the river.\n\nI unexpectedly came across just such an event this year along the Collawash River. The first clue was an eerie slackwater (shown below), with streamside Red Alder inundated under several feet of perfectly still, turquoise water. Just downstream was the answer to this strange anomaly. A massive rock slab had split from a tall cliff along the east bank of the river, crashing into the stream and creating a debris dam that formed a temporary lake on the Collawash.\n\nThe eerie, still pool in the Collawash impounded by the recent debris pile\n\nThe new debris pile in the foreground and the impounded, temporary lake on the Collawash\n\nThe river has since breached the debris pile and is now beginning to carry away fine debris. Note the inundated Red Alder trees in the background\n\nBased on available air photos, the collapse occurred sometime between July 2021 and August 2023 — the 2021 image shows the free-flowing river and the 2023 version clearly shows debris the cliff collapse. While these events can occur at any time of year, those we have seen in recent years have mostly happened during the wet winter months, when the forces of erosion are at their peak.\n\nBased at the state of the debris pile, I would guess that this cliff came down sometime in the winter 2021-22, roughly two years ago. Why this guess? Because with events like this, the debris pile is usually loose enough for the stream to initially flow under it – like a sieve – until the pile settles and when fine material carried in the stream begins to plug small gaps in the settling pile. The other clue is the lack of fine material on top of the pile – the Collawash has clearly had some time to scour the pile of small debris during at least one season of high water.\n\n(Update: per Ian’s comment, below, the Forest Service estimates the collapse to have occurred in February 2023 — a full year later than my guess! They also reported that at that time, the entire river was flowing through the debris and had not yet overtopped it, where today a significant amount of the flow is overtopping the debris. The Collowash is making quick work of this blockage!)\n\nThough a portion of the river’s flow is now cresting the debris pile, much of the flow is still flowing through the loose debris\n\nAs with other cliff collapses, several very large pieces of intact cliff survived the fall, but these are already beginning to buckle from their own weight. As the stream continues to churn away at the smaller debris in the pile, the huge boulders sitting on top face enormous stress when the underlying debris beneath them shifts. An especially impressive, house-sized slab that is the largest among the boulders to survive the collapse (below) is already showing large stress cracks. It, too, will eventually break apart as the debris pile continues to shift and erode.\n\nThe largest of the intact cliff sections is this behemoth, roughly the size of a small house. Stress cracks are already forming as gravity and the shifting, eroding debris flow beneath the boulder continues to move\n\nDownstream from the debris pile the Collawash River roars through a new Class 5 rapid created by the debris (below). The erosive energy of this steep, newly-formed rapid is immense. Over time it will erode the debris pile from below, continually pulling material from the collapse downstream and allowing the river to cut more deeply into the remaining pile.\n\nNew Class V rapids formed below the debris pile where the Collawash is now much steeper than before\n\nLooking downstream from the collapse section, giant boulders in the distance (now moss-covered) from previous collapses reveal the most recent event as just another in a perpetual process of river erosion here\n\nThe erosive energy now concentrated in the new rapids just below the debris pile is hydro-physics in action. The panoramic view of the collapse (below) tells the story: the temporary lake on the right hides a series of pools and rapids that existed upstream before the slide, and this energy has now been displaced to the new rapids in the downstream section, just below the slide.\n\nPanoramic view of the cliff collapse showing the impounded lake (right) upstream and the new rapids (left) downstream created by the debris pile at center\n\n[click here for a large version]\n\nThis amount concentrated energy of focused on the lower end of the new, unconsolidated debris pile means the river will quickly win the battle of rock versus water that is on full display here. Eventually, this will become what kayakers call a “boulder garden”, eventually draining the temporary lake and leaving only a few of the largest boulders in place to mark the site of cliff collapse. This is only the latest of many such events at this narrow bend in the Collawash River, and it won’t be the last.\n\nThe following schematics show the newly exposed cliff scar and the debris left by the cliff collapse in more detail:\n\nThe collapse created a 120-foot vertical scar in the cliff\n\nThe debris pile from the collapse is dominated by this massive 25-foot wide boulder\n\nIn researching this article, I stumbled across an image captured by outdoor writer Zach Urness in the summer of 2019 at the popular swimming hole just below these cliffs. To my amazement, you can plainly see that a prominent crack had formed in the cliff face, and matches the outline of the eventual collapse! I’ve marked it with a series of arrows in the photo below.\n\nView of the Collawash River cliff before the collapse with arrows marking the obvious crack that was forming (photo: Zach Urness)\n\nCloser view of the Collawash River cliff before the collapse with arrows marking the crack that would eventually lead to the collapse (photo: Zach Urness)\n\nZach’s photo also shows how this spot in the stream was already littered with large boulders from prior collapses before the collapse. There’s no way of knowing when these earlier events occurred, but we do know from witnessing the latest collapses here and elsewhere in WyEast Country that they are more common – and constant – than we once thought.\n\nThe lack of photos or reporting on the collapse has a silver lining: Zach’s photo was taken from just above the Little Fan Creek picnic area, located at the confluence of the main Collawash and Hot Springs Fork. This area is especially popular with families in the summer months, with crowds of people floating and swimming the many pools in the river, and where a summer event might have had deadly consequences.\n\nHow to see it for yourself…\n\nThe graceful Collawash River Bridge was constructed in 1957 as part of logging heyday in the upper Clackamas River watershed\n\nThe recent cliff collapse on the Collawash River is easy to visit if you’re looking for a weekend drive. The winter off-season is the best time, too, as the Clackamas River corridor is popular and often busy during the spring and summer months. To reach the site, head up the Clackamas River Highway (OR 224) for 26 miles east of the town of Estacada to the Ripplebrook ranger station and campground, Here OR 224 becomes Forest Road 46. Continue for another 3.5 miles on FR 46 to an obvious (but usually unsigned) junction with the paved Collawash River Road (Forest Road 63).\n\nTurn right onto FR 63, and be sure to take your time along this stretch. Here, the road hugs the Collawash River through an exceptionally scenic and geologically interesting areas. You will immediately cross a beautiful arched bridge over the Collawash as you enter the river’s narrow lower canyon on FR 63. Views of dramatic cliffs, river rapids and impressive old growth trees are at every turn, with frequent pullouts for stopping.\n\nAutumn scene along the Collawash River Road\n\nAt about the 4-mile mark you will reach another junction, where paved Forest Road 70 heads right to well-known Bagby Hot Springs, located on the Hot Springs Fork of the Collawash River. Stay straight on FR 63 from this junction and immediately cross the Hot Springs Fork on second bridge. The recent cliff collapse is just upstream from here, so watch for an obvious boulder perched on a pile of moss-covered rock on the east side of the road (shown below). This is where the collapse occurred.\n\nThere’s room for shoulder parking next to the perched rock, and the best view is from the upstream side of the big boulder, on top of the rock pile. Use care scrambling up the rock pile – there’s a steep drop on the opposite side!\n\nWhile it looks poised to roll onto my car, this boulder is from an earlier cliff collapse that occurred well before the Collawash River Road was built in the 1950s. The best viewpoint of the latest collapse is from the top of this rock pile, next to the big boulder\n\nThough the Collawash River was mostly spared by the Riverside Fire that swept across 138,000 acres in the Clackamas River watershed in 2020, the Clackamas River Highway route to the Collawash River travels through much of the burn. While this might sound a bit bleak for a scenic drive, it’s a great opportunity to fully appreciate the scope of the burn and watch the beginnings of the post-fire forest recovery here.\n\nThe Riverside Fire was the third and largest of three human-caused fires to sweep through the Clackamas River canyon over the past two decades. While fires are a natural and necessary element to forest health in the Pacific Northwest, it’s also true that human-caused fires are burning the Clackamas River basin (and many other forests in the Pacific Northwest) at an unsustainable.\n\nThe human-caused Riverside Fire roared across the Clackamas River area in September 2020 burning 138,000 homes and dozens of structures in its path\n\nHuman-caused fires are also killing old-growth riparian trees that have survived centuries of wildfires. Why? In part because of the intensity of these recent burns as a result of decades of fire suppression, but also because riparian areas were often be spared in the past by natural, lightning-sparked fires that typically began on exposed, drought-stressed ridgetop forests – not in moist rainforest canyons, where all three of the human-caused fires on the Clackamas started.\n\nThe Forest Service is still gradually reopening the many campgrounds and picnic areas along the Clackamas River that were affected by the burn, so you are likely to encounter logging operations where trees deemed “hazardous” are being removed by contract crews. These projects are well-signed and easy to avoid if you’re following the main route.\n\nThe Forest Service is still logging fire-killed or weakened trees like these along major forest roads in the Clackamas area as “hazard trees”\n\nFor a longer tour, you can continue further upstream along the Clackamas River Highway from the Coillawash River Road junction. The highway hugs the Clackamas River for another eight scenic miles, with pullouts along the way to appreciate the views. This section of the highway passes Austin Hot Springs, an interesting area, but also a private inholding within the national forest, and not open to the public.\n\nAbove the Collawash River confluence, the main Clackamas River is unburned and a reminder of what the lower canyon looked like before the 2020 Riverside Fire\n\nAs you explore the area, you may begin see each vertical cliff and outcrop with new eyes as – perhaps – the next real-time geologic event! Chances are slim that any of us will witness such an event, but seeing the aftermath of the Collawash River collapse gives a new appreciation for the constant natural processes that continue to shape the scenery around us.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n_______________\n\nTom Kloster | January 2024\n\nThe 2024 Campaign Calendar is the twentieth edition!\n\nWith the December holiday season comes my annual Mount Hood National Park Campaign calendar, but this year is a bit of a milestone: the 2024 calendar is the 20th edition since I began putting these together back in 2003! Much has changed over those years, so this article includes both a retrospective from the early calendars and highlights from the 2024 edition, so I hope you’ll indulge me!\n\nThe new calendars for 2024 are print-on-demand and available now from Zazzle. You can find them here:\n\nSee the 2024 Mount Hood National Park Campaign Calendar on Zazzle\n\nZazzle does excellent work and these can be shipped direct to anywhere. As always, all proceeds go to Trailkeepers of Oregon (TKO) for their crucial work in volunteer trail stewardship and advocacy.\n\nLooking back to the very beginning…\n\nIt was back in 2003 when I kicked off the “idea campaign” for a Mount Hood National Park that encompasses Mount Hood and the Gorge. It’s an idea that has made it as far as legislation in Congress on several occasions as early as the 1890s, but never made it as far as the president’s desk to become law – usually due to moneyed interests in exploiting the mountain. Thus, the purpose of the “idea campaign” is to simply keep the national park idea alive.\n\nShooting the Salmon River with my first digital camera in 2003 (Greg Lief)\n\nI’ve been asked many times “do you really think Mount Hood will become a national park?” I do, of course. Eventually. Most of our national parks had a long and bumpy road to finally being established, often starting as a national monument or recreation area – but always because they had exceptional natural and cultural features unmatched elsewhere. That’s why I believe that Mount Hood will eventually join the ranks of Crater Lake, Mount Rainier and the Olympics and receive the level of commitment to both conservation and recreation that only the National Park Service can offer. In the meantime, this blog serves as place to celebrate those natural and cultural features that make Mount Hood and the Gorge unparalleled places worth protecting, while spotlighting threats to the mountain.\n\nWith this goal, the first calendar (below) was an outgrowth of the idea campaign as a visual way to celebrate the many places and landscapes that combine to make WyEast Country so exceptional. Back in 2004, there were also new technologies that helped make a custom calendar possible: I had recently purchased my first digital camera and CafePress had emerged as a quality on-demand printing service as part of the dotcom revolution.\n\nThe first cover… back in 2004\n\nThe first calendar was modest – printed at 8.5×11 inches with color reproduction that was decidedly “approximate”, though still a big leap forward from color photocopies of the 1990s. The first edition featured a recurring, favorite spot of mine on the cover – Elk Cove on Mount Hood’s north side.\n\nFrom this start, the calendar evolved over the next 20 years in technology, print quality and the landscapes I featured. This collage (below) of the 20 annual covers shows some of that evolution.\n\n[click here for a large version]\n\nLooking back, the two constants among cover subjects were waterfalls and the mountain, though the places and vantage points varied greatly. One of the best rewards in putting the calendars together has been the opportunity to explore different corners of the mountain and gorge, as I set a goal early on to feature new images taken during the previous year in each calendar. While there are a few spots I go back to nearly every year, I’ve also been able to feature new places and perspectives not seen elsewhere.\n\nLooking across those old cover images, I’m also able to see how the cover design evolved. The first two calendars used a script font that looks ridiculous to me now, and by 2006 I had moved on to the “national park” fonts I use today – notably, Copperplate — along with the color scheme I had used on the (then) brand new Mount Hood National Park Campaign website. The graphic below the main image was from bumper stickers I also had printed at CafePress at the time.\n\nGetting there… improved fonts in 2006\n\nThe cover of the 2006 calendar is the first in a series of reminder among the covers that there are no constants in WyEast Country. Everything changes, and lately, change seems to be accelerating, as the cover image of Mount Hood from the Elk Cove trail underscores. Just two years after I took this photo, the Gnarl Fire had roared across the east flank of the mountain, nearly engulfing Cloud Cap Inn. Then, three years after the Gnarl Fire, the Dollar Lake Fire had burned much of the forest on the north slope of the mountain shown in this image.\n\nThe 2011 Dollar Lake Fire started just below the rocky viewpoint where this cover photo was taken. Today, the sea of green Noble Fir and Mountain Hemlock that once covered the slopes has been replaced by a ghost forest of silver tree skeletons, with a new forest just getting underway in their. The following photo comparison from this viewpoint (below) shows the dramatic changes to the north side in stark contrast.\n\nThe Dollar Lake Fire burned thousands of acres of subalpine forest on Mount Hood’s north slope in 2011\n\nThe Dollar Lake Fire brought an unexpected opportunity to witness and document the forest recovery, and without the assistance of man, as most of the fire was within the Mount Hood Wilderness. As such, the Forest Service has adopted a hands-off policy and is deferring to the natural forest recovery process. I’ve since posted several articles tracking the recovery:\n\n“After the Dollar Lake Fire” (June 2012)\n\n“Dollar Lake Fire: Five Years After” (October 2016)\n\n“10 Years After the Dollar Lake Fire” (November 2022)\n\nThe 2007 calendar marked a technology change when CafePress began offering a much larger format, measuring 11×17”. This required a different photo aspect, but also gave sweeping vistas the space they need to be truly appreciated. Such was the case with the first calendar cover in this larger format in 2007, when the sprawling view of Mount Hood’s east face (below) from Gnarl Ridge was the cover image. This edition also featured what has become the basic design for the cover, along with a blue color scheme that I’ve alternated with the original green theme over the years.\n\nGoing ultra-wide with a new format in 2007\n\nIn 2008, I started this blog as an alternative to making constant updates to the campaign website. This opened still more opportunities to explore and capture WyEast country in words and imagery, with deeper dives and more details in the long form that I prefer. As the blog shifted my focus toward emerging risks to Mount Hood and the Gorge, so my photography shifted, and the calendar began to include more remote and obscure places on the mountain.\n\nThere’s a story behind the nearly identical cover scenes of Upper McCord Falls (below) that appeared on both the 2011 and 2013 calendars. In 2012 I lost all of my original digital files from the 2011 calendar in a computer upgrade, and by 2013 I’d clearly forgotten what the earlier cover images was. Apparently, I liked that view of Upper McCord Falls enough to put it back on the cover — though I had also upgraded my camera between these covers, so at least the 2013 version was an improvement on the earlier take – to my eye, at least! (for this article, I recreated the 2011 cover from a printed copy of the calendar I saved).\n\nSeeing double-double!\n\nAs with so many places in the Gorge that I had taken for granted in my life, it never occurred to me that the forests surrounding Elowah Falls and Upper McCord Falls would soon be completely burned, leaving a landscape will take generations to return to the lush, mature forests that I grew up with. As it turned out, Upper McCord Falls was the first trail I visited within the “restricted area” following the September 2017 Eagle Creek Fire. It was just five months after the fire when I headed up there in February 2018 with a Trailkeepers of Oregon (TKO) crew to survey the trail damage.\n\nThe devastation was much more extensive than I expected on what would be the first of many trips into the restricted area after the fire. I had hiked through the recent burns on Mount Hood in previous years, and was braced for seeing ancient trees reduced to burned snags, but what makes the aftermath of fire in the Gorge so unique is the terrain. The forest was playing a greater role in holding the steep slopes of the Gorge together than I think anyone realized, and just five months after the fire the scale of erosion and ground movement was alarming.\n\nLocating surviving trail tread after the fire at McCord Creek in early 2018\n\nThe scene at Upper McCord Falls was startling, as well. The burn was severe around the falls, killing the entire forest. The layers of green moss that survived the burn on the cliffs and boulders nearest the falls seemed like they had been hand-tinted onto the brown landscape, like an old postcard.\n\nUpper McCord Falls in February 2018 (Randi Mendoza, Oregon Parks & Recreation)\n\nThe trail seemed a total loss in several areas on that trip where sliding mud and rock had completely covered the tight series of switchbacks originally carved into the slope by the Civilian Conservation Corps back in the 1930s. In the years that followed the fire, TKO volunteers have removed tons of debris from the trail and reconstructed damaged stone walls built by the CCC, restoring the tread to nearly its original design today.\n\nUpper McCord Falls a few months after the fire\n\nOn the way out from that first visit after the fire, the clouds broke at the west end of the Gorge just as darkness was falling, creating the weird illusion that the charred forest silhouetted against dark the clouds and flaming sunset was still burning. As with all who love the Gorge, it was the beginning of a journey for me in accepting the reality of the fire – including the senseless act that started the blaze, as well as the inevitability of this fire being long overdue – and finally, a deeper appreciation for the resilience of our forests in which fire an essential destructive force.\n\nBurned forests at McCord Creek on my first trip after the fire appeared to be on fire, once again, as a brilliant sunset lit up at the west end of he Gorge\n\nRevisiting the slopes leading to Upper McCord Falls last spring, the resurgence of the understory and beginnings of a new forest was inspiring after five summers of forest recovery. While I won’t live long enough to see big trees replace those that were killed in the fire, the surviving trees are bouncing back strongly, and watching the renewal of the Gorge forests is as inspiring in its own way as the big trees we lost.\n\nA stand of Douglas fir that survived the fire is surrounded by a thriving understory along the McCord Creek trail in Spring 2023\n\nMeanwhile, Upper McCord Falls looks quite different five years later, as well (below). The understory has made a vigorous comeback, but more surprising is the east (left) segment of this twin falls, which appears to be plugged with debris released into McCord Creek from the fire – at least for now. Prior to the burn, the twin tier would have been flowing when I took this photo last spring, just as it was in the calendar covers in 2011 and 2013.\n\nUpper McCord Falls six years after the fire in Spring 2023\n\nUpper McCord Falls has historically had as many as three segments cascading from the basalt ledge that forms the cascade (a third tier once flowed to the left of east tier as recently as the 1970s, as shown below), so in time, there’s no reason to assume the second (or even third) tiers will re-emerge. The defining factor is simply the amount of rock and log debris piled up on top of the basalt ledge.\n\nSince the 1970s, the debris had been further stabilized by a colony of Red Alder that was the main force holding the pile of boulders and debris together, eventually blocking the third tier of the falls completely. Today, those trees have been killed, and with the volatile flooding on Gorge streams since the fire, there’s good reason to expect McCord Creek to re-arrange the shape of Upper McCord Falls by removing some or all of the debris plugging parts of the waterfall.\n\nUpper McCord was a triple falls in the 1970s! (Don Lowe)\n\nWhere the tree canopy along the McCord Creek trail system were completely burned (below), the forest recovery is now in full swing, choking the route in many spots with Thimbleberry, Vine Maple, Douglas Maple and many other understory plants whose roots survived the burn, allowing them to bounce back quickly.\n\nForest understory surging back after six years at McCord Creek\n\nBigleaf Maple are bouncing back in this way, too, pointing to a future deciduous forest canopy as the first phase of recovery in many of the burned areas. Along the lower sections of the McCord Creek trail, ten-foot shoots have exploded from the roots of Bigleaf maple trees whose killed tops still stand as bleached snags (below). Many of these recovering maples will become multi-stemmed trees, a familiar sight in Oregon’s forest and one answer as to why mature Bigleaf Maple so often have multiple trunks.\n\nBigleaf Maples regrowing from the base of burned trees whose roots survived the fire\n\nThe drama at McCord Creek continued a few short years after the fire when the west cliff wall of the Elowah Falls amphitheater collapsed in the winter of 2021. There’s no science (yet) to make the connection, but the Gorge has seen a series of cliff failures since the 2017 Eagle Creek Fire. Could these events be linked to the loss of vegetation or corresponding runoff on Gorge slopes? Perhaps, but as I described in the previous article on the 1973 Tanner Creek landslide, there are unique forces at work in the Gorge that date back to the last ice age, so events like these are the norm, not the exception.\n\nElowah Falls cliff collapse in the spring of 2021 (Drew Stock, Trailkeepers of Oregon)\n\nTKO volunteers discovered the Elowah Falls cliff collapse in 2021 and captured the dramatic photos shown here. In the immediate aftermath of the collapse, McCord Creek disappeared into the loose basalt cobbles that had filled the creek channel and buried the Trail 400 footbridge to its railings. That condition was temporary, however, as by last spring McCord Creek had already carried away much of the small debris and excavated the footbridge. The images below show the erosive power of the stream over a period of just two years.\n\nDebris burying McCord Creek and its footbridge immediately after the collapse (Drew Stock, Trailkeepers of Oregon)\n\nElowah Falls footbridge excavated (and railings removed!) by McCord Creek after just two years\n\nLike most cliff collapses in the Gorge, the jumbled debris fan at Elowah Falls is a mix of truck-sized boulders that managed to hold together amid a sea of smaller boulders and fractured basalt cobbles where parts of the once-solid rock face had simply crumbled during the event.\n\nLarge blocks of basalt mixed with smaller cobbles in the debris pile at the base of the collapsed cliff\n\nToday, a massive scar is still obvious on the cliff wall where the basalt gave way (below). In time, however, the evidence from event will be hidden under a fresh carpet of moss and Licorice Fern, once again giving that deceptive illusion of stability that has never really existed in the Gorge.\n\nLooking up the debris fan at the massive scar left behind by the cliff collapse at Elowah Falls in Spring 2023\n\nWhile the cliff collapse at Elowah Falls was massive in scale, it spared the spectacular trail to Upper McCord Falls where it is carved into the basalt walls 400 feet above the creek. In fact, hikers passing along this vertigo-inducing stretch of trail might not even notice that a large section of the wall directly below them had collapsed into the creek, as the impact is mostly hidden from this airy view (below).\n\nElowah Falls seems unchanged from above along the Upper McCord Trail\n\nIf the cliff collapse Elowah Falls was impressive to see, the earlier collapse at Punch Bowl Falls on Eagle Creek was downright shocking. After Multnomah Falls, and Crown Point, the view into the mossy cavern that holds Punch Bowl Falls might be the most iconic in the Gorge. The idyllic scene drew photographers from around the world before the fire, and even gave its name to the category of “punchbowl” waterfalls.\n\nPunch Bowl Falls as it once appeared in 2012\n\nI posted an extensive piece on this event when it showed up unexpectedly on a series of aerial surveys the State of Oregon had conducted to track landslides after the Eagle Creek Fire. The Punch Bowl collapse occurred just months after the fire, sometime in early 2018. The “restricted area” was still in effect at the time, so the first few people to see the aftermath in person were trail volunteers working to put the Eagle Creek trail back together. Today, you can see the re-arranged landscape by taking the Lower Punch Bowl spur trail down to the falls.\n\nAftermath of the 2018 cliff collapse at Punch Bowl Falls\n\nGetting that classic shot of Punch Bowl Falls during spring runoff usually entailed wading knee-deep into Eagle Creek to get a look into the hidden cavern that holds the falls. The cliff collapse has since changed things a bit. For now, there are a pair of good-sized boulders that landed in the entrance to the cavern, blocking the traditional view.\n\nIn time, Eagle Creek will dismantle much of the debris from the collapse, and even these boulders will eventually break apart or be pushed downstream by the enormous force of the stream during winter floods. This will be aided by the many fallen logs that have dropped into the stream since the fire, and now act as erosive battering rams and levers as they move downstream.\n\nThe ”modern” calendar design emerges in 2016\n\nThe final design and format emerged in 2016 with a switch in vendors\n\nYear twelve in the calendar series brought a major shift and format and improved quality when I moved printing from CafePress to Zazzle. The image reproduction at Zazzle is excellent and the overall printing process much better, resolving some quality concerns that drove me to make the move. Zazzle also brought the added opportunity to have a printed back cover on the calendar, kicking off the grid of nine botanical photos that I continue to include each year. Like the scenic views in each calendar, the botanical images are captured over the course of the prior year on my forays into WyEast Country.\n\nNew with the 2016 calendar? A printed back cover!\n\nOne last profile of note from past calendars is the 2019 edition, where lovely Whale Creek in the Clackamas River watershed is featured. This idyllic scene is – or was – typical of the beautiful rainforests there. Despite a long and frustrating history of aggressive logging over more than a past century, some of the finest ancient forests in the region survived here. Sadly, the Riverside Fire – yet another human-caused event – started just upstream from this spot along the Clackamas, and eventually burned 120,000 acres of forest, as well as numerous structures.\n\nThis scene from Whale Creek taken before the 2020 Riverside Fire was featured on the 2019 calendar\n\nI’ve posted many articles on the necessity and benefits of wildfire in our forests, but the Riverside Fire underscores a few caveats to the science. As I described in this 2021 article, we are burning our forests faster than is sustainable. This stems from multiple factors adding up to a perfect storm: a century of fire suppression coupled with heavy logging has left us with thousands of old clearcuts packed with thickets of overplanted, fire-prone young trees and decades of fuel buildup. Add climate change, with our summers getting drier and hotter, and our forests have become a tinder box in most years, not just the occasional hot summer.\n\nThe same section of Whale Creek after the fire in 2020 (USFS)\n\nGiven this confluence of stresses on our forests, we’re doing an especially poor job preventing human-caused fires – they account for 70 percent of wildfires in Oregon! As I point out in the linked article, we’ll need to set some unwelcome limits on human behavior if we hope to slow down the burning to sustainable levels. So far, the Forest Service is moving very slowly in limited access during extreme fire danger, though successful liability lawsuits against power companies whose live lines triggered some of the 2020 fires may change that thinking.\n\nTKO crews clearing big logs on the Clackamas River Trail after the Riverside Fire\n\nSome good news from the Clackamas? TKO crews have already been working on reopening trails damaged in the fire. Like the Gorge, the Clackamas River canyon is steep country, so keeping trails open as the forest recovers will be a long-term endeavor.\n\nThat’s a look back at 20 years of campaign calendars, and now…\n\n…looking ahead to 2024!\n\nThe view from Inspiration Point is the cover image for 2024\n\nFor the 2024 calendar cover, I selected an image of Mount Hood’s fearsome north face (above), as viewed from a tiny, unofficial trail that I maintain at Inspiration Point (located at the 3-mile mark on bumpy Cloud Cap Road). How long have I been stopping here? I looked back at my photo archive, and the earliest I could find was a slide from the summer of 1984 – which means I’ll celebrate my 40th summer visiting this lovely spot when I stop at Inspiration Point next year!\n\nClouds capping the mountain on the road to Cloud Cap in this 1980s view from Inspiration Point\n\nOn the back cover of the new calendar, yet another collection of nine wildflowers that I photographed over the past year is featured – including a couple that were new to me.\n\nBack cover of the 2024 calendar\n\nPutting it all together, here’s a jumbo collage of the 12 monthly images in the 2024 calendar, plus the covers and a snapshot of the page layout:\n\n[click here for a large version]\n\nFor the January image in the new calendar (below), I selected a view of Mount Hood’s northwest side, with Cathedral Ridge and the Sandy Glacier Headwall covered in an early dusting of autumn snow. On this day last October, the mountain was emerging from the clouds after being socked in most of the day.\n\nNorthwest face of Mount Hood with early autumn snow\n\nFor the February image I thought I’d mix things up a bit with this view of the lower Deschutes River canyon at Oak Springs (below), a corner of WyEast Country that not many find their way to. On this day last winter, a dusting of snow had fallen on Tygh Ridge, the long fault scarp that rises in the distance – another lesser visited spot on this lonely, dry side of the mountain.\n\nLower Deschutes River and Tygh Ridge from above Oak Springs\n\nFor March, a more familiar scene (below) along a quiet section of the lower Salmon River features a group of Lady Ferns. The Old Salmon River Trail follows this stretch of river through some of the best rainforest and oldest trees within easy reach of Portland.\n\nLower Salmon River in Spring\n\nI chose another stream scene for April, though this one is less familiar to most. This is Viento Creek (below), in the east Gorge, just a few miles west of Hood River at Viento State Park.\n\nViento Creek in the East Gorge\n\nThere’s a backstory associated with this photo, as I’ve been working with TKO for the past few years to create a new family-friendly trail from the Viento Campground to a magnificent viewpoint on the Viento Bluffs. The new trail will someday pass the stream scene shown above, enroute to expansive views of the Columbia River – but with a short route that it will be welcoming to casual hikers and young kids. Watch this space for more news on this project!\n\nTKO and State Parks crew surveying a new trail at Viento Bluff earlier this year\n\nThe picturesque view from Viento Bluff will someday become a family trail destination\n\nThe May calendar image features another stretch of the Salmon River (below). This pretty cascade has become a popular spot for photographers in recent years. I included it in this year’s calendar partly for symbolic purposes, as this scene appeared in the very first calendar in 2004. This is also where Greg Lief’s image at the top of this article of me shooting photos was captured in 2003 – hard to believe that was 20 years ago!\n\nSpringtime on the Salmon River\n\nJune brings another symbolic favorite, as Elk Cove appeared on the cover of the first calendar, and in several subsequent editions over the years – and almost always from this very spot (below) along the Timberline Trail. As much as the mountain has changed in recent years, this view remains a bit of a constant – always lovely, but especially the Western Pasqueflower are putting on their “Muppets of the Mountains” show.\n\nSummer wildflowers putting on their annual show at Elk Cove\n\nFor July I selected another repeat spot, one of my favorite viewpoints of Mount Hood and the Eliot Glacier from the shoulder of Cooper Spur (below). I posted a look-back article on this area earlier this year to kick off a series of then-and-now photo retrospectives.\n\nMount Hood and the Eliot Glacier from the Cooper Spur Trail\n\nFor the August image, I selected another scene from a blog article, in this case a view of the recovering Muddy Fork valley where a landslide swept through two decades ago. This event and several now-and-then photo comparisons are over here.\n\nMuddy Fork of the Sandy River\n\nFor September, I chose something a bit different, with a cliff-top view into the lower White River Canyon (below) at White River Falls State Park. So many things make Mount Hood unique (and worthy of national park protection!), but the compact collection of wildly different climate zones might be at the top of the list. There aren’t many places in the world where a 2-hour drive from the middle of a major metropolitan area takes you from rainforest to desert, with glacier-covered volcano rising above you the entire time!\n\nLower White River Canyon in desert country\n\nThe October image stays with the desert theme, and features Lower White River Falls. In spring, this canyon lights up with desert wildflowers that I’ve included in previous calendar editions, but the tawny yellows, gold and reds of autumn create their own beauty in this rugged landscape.\n\nLower White River Falls in Autumn\n\nWhite River Falls State Park remains a diamond in the rough, with much potential for both improved recreation and conservation of the natural and cultural features in the park. The area is becoming more popular, and that has translated into some visible impacts – and therefore several proposals to respond to this increased demand are featured in this article from earlier this year.\n\nLoop Trail concept for White River Falls State Park\n\nFor November, fall colors along Vista Ridge and fresh snow on the mountain are featured (below). This scene is surprisingly easy to get to – it’s along the access road to the Vista Ridge Trailhead, another increasingly popular spot on the mountain. This article from last summer includes some proposals for managing the pressures the newfound popularity is bringing to Vista Ridge.\n\nBrilliant fall colors on Vista Ridge\n\nFinally, a view of the mountain after the first big snowfall of the season (below) from the lightly traveled Gumjuwac Trail, gateway to the Badger Creek Wilderness. My favorite viewpoint hikes are to “pocket views” – those spots where a steep talus slope or rocky outcrop provides an unexpected view – and this rocky crest just below Gumjuwac Saddle is among the best, and was featured on the front of the 2016 calendar, as well.\n\nPocket viewpoint along the Gumjuwac Trail in winter\n\nOn the way up to the Gumjuwac viewpoint, I followed the chunky footprints of a Black bear for much of the route. Hiking in snow is a useful reminder that wildlife are always out there, even if we don’t have snow on the ground to record their travels. This is their home, after all, we are the visitors.\n\nBear tracks along the Gumjuwac Trail\n\nBear tracks in fresh snow on the Gumjuwac Trail\n\nSo, that’s it for my annual calendar review!

Looking ahead to next year, I already have several articles underway, with the usual collection of deep dives, new proposals and reflections on the past. I hope you’ll continue to stop by!\n\nThe author at Owl Point in 2008 (Andy Prahl)\n\nBest to you in the coming year – see you on the trail in 2024!\n\n_______________\n\nTom Kloster | December 2023\n\nBeautiful Wahclella Falls in the massive rock cathedral that Tanner Creek has sculpted\n\nFifty years once seemed like a very long time to me – half a century! Fifty years before I showed up on this planet (in 1962) human flight had barely been mastered and automobiles had just begun to replace the horse and buggy. Looking back today upon the past fifty years, things seems less changed from the perspective of a 61-year-old (though it’s true that without the arrival of personal computers and the internet, I wouldn’t be posting this article!) Our sense of passing time is warped by our own very short lives.\n\nThat’s the gift of witnessing the natural world around us moving forward at its own pace, as it has for millennia. Fifty years is a fleeting moment in time to our mountains and forests, where the only constant is change and the seemingly endless repetitions in the of cycle life that plays out on the landscape. Seeing these larger systems at work is a reassuring escape from our daily lives driven by deadlines and chores, and a reminder of the larger natural order that we belong to.\n\nTanner Creek weaving through the mossy boulder gardens below Wahclella Falls\n\nThis article is a 50-year snapshot of a catastrophic landslide in the Columbia River Gorge that perfectly illustrates these forces at work, right before our eyes. The landslide took place in the lower gorge of the Tanner Creek canyon in 1973, triggering a cascade of events that are still playing out today. It might have gone unnoticed at the time by all but a few avid hikers had there not been an earlier human presence at Tanner Creek dating back to very start of the 20thcentury.\n\nThe story begins at the Bonneville Fish Hatchery, located at the mouth of Tanner Creek. Built in 1909, it remains as one of the oldest hatcheries in the State of Oregon’s system, and was established as a place to breed salmon fry to be shipped to other hatcheries around the state. The map below shows the proximity of Tanner Creek to the Columbia River, Bonneville Dam and today’s Interstate 84.\n\nThe Tanner Creek gorge is located on the south side of the Columbia River at Bonneville, in the heart of the Gorge\n\nThe Bonneville Hatchery opened five years before the Historic Columbia River Highway arrived at Bonneville, when Gorge travel was still by train or boat. It was completed nearly 30 years before Bonneville Dam was constructed, though expanded as part of the dam construction project. Over its nearly 125 years of operation, The Bonneville Hatchery has been expanded and upgraded several times in an attempt to keep pace with continued dam building upstream on the Columbia River. The hatchery continues to be a popular tourist attraction, with stocked ponds and interpretive displays.\n\nConstruction of the hatchery diversion dame on Tanner Creek in about 1907 – note two men standing on the pipeline intake structure (OSU Archives)\n\nThe hatchery diversion dam today\n\nThe Bonneville Fish Hatchery originally depended on the cold, clear mountain water of Tanner Creek for its existence. When the hatchery was constructed in 1908, a small diversion dam was built one-half mile upstream from the main hatchery and a supply pipeline was built along the west bank of Tanner Creek to carry stream water to the hatchery ponds. The original diversion dam still exists today, though most of the hatchery water now comes from wells. The old pipeline has since been replaced, and is now buried under the short access road that hikers follow to the old dam and the start of the Wahclella Falls trail.\n\nThe original pipeline that carried Tanner Creek water to the Bonneville Fish Hatchery nearing completion in about 1908\n\nToday’s access road to the diversion dam replaces the old water supply pipeline, and doubles as the first half mile of the Wahclella Falls Trail. This view is in roughly the same spot as the previous historic photo\n\nWhen the Tanner Creek landslide occurred in 1973, it was first noticed by hatchery workers after the water supply suddenly stopped flowing. An investigation upstream revealed a massive cliff collapse along the west all of the canyon, just below Wahclella Falls. The resulting landslide had completed blocked Tanner Creek, temporarily blocking the streamflow below the landslide.\n\nThere was a rough user trail to Wahclella Falls in the days of the landslide, but it was a sketchy affair, crossing several treacherous, small landslide chutes on the east side of the canyon. Hikers parked at a gravel turnaround by the access road gate (located at today’s Wahclella Falls parking area) to reach the trail. By the late 1980s, the modern trail we know today was conceived, with much of it built by volunteers. When the new loop trail was completed in the early 1990s, the landslide was deemed stable enough to be traversed by the new trail. This has allowed countless hikers over the past 30 years to see the spectacle close-up.\n\nHikers are dwarfed by the Tanner Creek landslide debris – especially the house-sized boulder in the middle of the debris field\n\nLoose material from a landslide typically forms a steep, cone-shaped pile at its terminus, known as a debris fan. Today, the landslide debris fan from the 1973 landslide appears as a green, moss and fern-covered talus slope with a few young trees gradually becoming established in the rubble. A few truck and house-sized boulders poke through the surface of the smaller talus. Below the talus slope, Tanner Creek has stripped away much of the small debris, exposing several of these giant basalt boulders in a dramatic rock garden that the stream continues to shape and shift.\n\nWhat caused the landslide?\n\nThree epic geologic events continue dominate how the Gorge is shaped today, including the 1973 landslide at Tanner Creek and the many smaller cliff collapses and landslides that occur every year. The first event created the underlying geology of the Gorge, and dates back about 17 million years. On the Oregon side of the river, ancient layers of volcanic ash and debris (similar to what Mount St. Helens produced in the 1980 eruption) accumulated to form the loosely consolidated geologic foundation, and is visible at river level. This unstable base is known as the Eagle Creek Formation.\n\nThe second event occurred between 12 and 16 million years ago, when hundreds of epic lava flows originating near today’s Steens Mountain flooded much of Oregon, leaving behind thousands of feet of “flood basalts” in stacked layers. These are collectively known as the Grande Ronde Formation and make up the layers we can plainly see in the towering cliffs that make dominate the Gorge landscape today. For this article, they will simply be referred to as Columbia River Basalt.\n\nThick layers of ancient Columbia River Basalt make up the steep walls of Tanner Creek canyon and much of the surrounding Gorge landscape. Individual basalt layers can range from a few feet to 50 feet or more in depth\n\nThe underlying ash and debris layers of the Eagle Creek Formation are less obvious than the overlying basalt, but this formation is familiar to hikers. Named for Eagle Creek in the Gorge, hikers slip and slide during the wet months on the muddy trail surface where the first mile or so of the famous Eagle Creek Trail is built across this material.\n\nCompared to the hard, black layers of basalt that form the bulk of the overlying geology, the Eagle Creek formation is very unstable, especially when exposed to weathering or stream erosion. And though the overlying layers of basalt are comparatively hard and durable, their weakness comes from the extensive fractures that form when basalt lava flows cool, creating the familiar columns that are common throughout the Gorge (more about that weakness in a moment).\n\nLoosely consolidated volcanic avalanche debris known as the Eagle Creek Formation underlies thousands of feet of basalt layers in the Gorge, making for an unstable, easily eroded foundation\n\nEagle Creek Formation makes up this wall along the lower section of the Tanner Creek Trail\n\nThe third epic event came long after the volcanic ash and lava had cooled and at the end of last ice age. During a period from about 13,000 to 15,000 years ago, a series of catastrophic floods from collapsing glacial lakes in today’s western Montana and northern Idaho and Washington rushed across the landscape of the Columbia Basin, then pushed through the Columbia River Gorge toward the Pacific Ocean. Compared to the volcanic episodes that created the Eagle Creek Formation and Columbia River Basalts, the glacial floods occurred yesterday, by geologic standards, and their impact is still playing out today.\n\nThe floodwaters were an astonishing 800 to 1000 feet deep as they rushed through the Gorge, carving the steep, dramatic gorge we know today. These are now known as the Bretz Floods, and scientist now believe there were over 40 separate flood events over the course of this period. The floods named for Harlen Bretz, a brilliant, visionary geologist who bravely persevered against intense criticism of his theory behind these events before they were finally accepted by the scientific community in the 1960s and 70s.\n\nThe trademark waterfalls of the Gorge are a product of the Bretz Floods where the stacked layers of ancient flood basalts were stripped of loose slopes and debris, revealing the soaring, vertical cliffs and dramatic waterfalls we see today. Where these waterfalls occurred on larger, more powerful streams like Tanner Creek, time and constant erosion has gradually migrated them upstream and away from the Columbia River over the millennia.\n\nThe succession of massive ice age floods known as the Bretz Floods easily topped Crown Point, stripping away all but the basalt cliffs, just as the floods shaped the sheer cliffs we see throughout the Gorge today\n\nSince the great floods, Tanner Creek has persistently swept away debris from each successive landslide and cliff collapse, continually eroding the heavy basalt layers from below and setting the stage for the next landslide event. The underlying Eagle Creek formation speeds up this process because it lies at river level in the Gorge, allowing both the Columbia River and its tributary streams to actively undercut the towering basalt walls that rest upon this unstable, underlying layer.\n\nToday, Wahclella Falls marks the current spot where Tanner Creek continues to carve its own, ever-longer gorge, now more than a mile long from where it began after the floods. Seen in this timeframe, the 1973 landslide at Tanner Creek was just one event in hundreds of similar cliff collapses and landslides over time that continue to shape the Gorge we know today.\n\nWeathered basalt often spalls according to the cooling cracks that formed when the lava flows cooled, "
