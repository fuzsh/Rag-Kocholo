        "text": "The cryosphere (including, snow, glaciers, permafrost, lake and river ice) is an integral element of high mountain regions, which are home to roughly 10% of the global population. Widespread cryosphere changes affect physical, biological and human systems in the mountains and surrounding lowlands, with impacts evident even in the ocean. Building on the IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report (AR5), this chapter assesses new evidence on observed recent and projected changes in the mountain cryosphere as well as associated impacts, risks and adaptation measures related to natural and human systems. Impacts in response to climate changes independently of changes in the cryosphere are not assessed in this chapter. Polar mountains are included in Chapter 3, except those in Alaska and adjacent Yukon, Iceland and Scandinavia, which are included in this chapter.\n\nObservations of cryospheric changes, impacts, and adaptation in high mountain areas\n\nObservations show general decline in low-elevation snow cover (high confidence), glaciers (very high confidence) and permafrost (high confidence) due to climate change in recent decades. Snow cover duration has declined in nearly all regions, especially at lower elevations, on average by 5 days per decade, with a likely range from 0–10 days per decade. Low elevation snow depth and extent have declined, although year-to-year variation is high. Mass change of glaciers in all mountain regions (excluding the Canadian and Russian Arctic, Svalbard, Greenland and Antarctica) was very likely -490 ± 100 kg m-2 yr-1 (-123 ± 24 Gt yr-1) in 2006–2015. Regionally averaged mass budgets were likely most negative (less than -850 kg m-2 yr-1) in the southern Andes, Caucasus and the European Alps/Pyrenees, and least negative in High Mountain Asia (-150 ± 110 kg m-2 yr-1) but variations within regions are strong. Between 3.6–5.2 million km2 are underlain by permafrost in the eleven high mountain regions covered in this chapter corresponding to 27–29% of the global permafrost area (medium confidence). Sparse and unevenly distributed measurements show an increase in permafrost temperature (high confidence), for example, by 0.19ºC ± 0.05ºC on average for about 28 locations in the European Alps, Scandinavia, Canada and Asia during the past decade. Other observations reveal decreasing permafrost thickness and loss of ice in the ground. {2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4}\n\nGlacier, snow and permafrost decline has altered the frequency, magnitude and location of most related natural hazards (high confidence). Exposure of people and infrastructure to natural hazards has increased due to growing population, tourism and socioeconomic development (high confidence). Glacier retreat and permafrost thaw have decreased the stability of mountain slopes and the integrity of infrastructure (high confidence). The number and area of glacier lakes has increased in most regions in recent decades (high confidence), but there is only limited evidence that the frequency of glacier lake outburst floods (GLOF) has changed. In some regions, snow avalanches involving wet snow have increased (medium confidence), and rain-on-snow floods have decreased at low elevations in spring and increased at high elevations in winter (medium confidence). The number and extent of wildfires have increased in the Western USA partly due to early snowmelt (medium confidence). {2.3.2, 2.3.3}\n\nChanges in snow and glaciers have changed the amount and seasonality of runoff in snow-dominated and glacier-fed river basins (very high confidence) with local impacts on water resources and agriculture (medium confidence). Winter runoff has increased in recent decades due to more precipitation falling as rain (high confidence). In some glacier-fed rivers, summer and annual runoff have increased due to intensified glacier melt, but decreased where glacier melt water has lessened as glacier area shrinks. Decreases were observed especially in regions dominated by small glaciers, such as the European Alps (medium confidence). Glacier retreat and snow cover changes have contributed to localized declines in agricultural yields in some high mountain regions, including the Hindu Kush Himalaya, and the tropical Andes (medium confidence). There is limited evidence of impacts on operation and productivity of hydropower facilities resulting from changes in seasonality and both increases and decreases in water input, for example, in the European Alps, Iceland, Western Canada and USA, and the tropical Andes. {2.3.1}\n\nSpecies composition and abundance have markedly changed in high mountain ecosystems in recent decades (very high confidence), partly due to changes in the cryosphere (high confidence). Habitats for establishment by formerly absent species have opened up or been altered by reduced snow cover (high confidence), retreating glaciers (very high confidence), and thawing of permafrost (medium confidence). Reductions in glacier and snow cover have directly altered the structure of many freshwater communities (high confidence). Reduced snow cover has negatively impacted the reproductive fitness of some snow-dependent plant and animal species, including foraging and predator-prey relationships of mammals (high confidence). Upslope migration of individual species, mostly due to warming and to a lesser extent due to cryosphere-related changes, has often increased local species richness (very high confidence). Some cold-adapted species, including endemics, in terrestrial and freshwater communities have declined in abundance (high confidence). While the plant productivity has generally increased, the actual impact on provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services varies greatly (high confidence). {2.3.3}\n\nTourism and recreation activities such as skiing, glacier tourism and mountaineering have been negatively impacted by declining snow cover, glaciers and permafrost (medium confidence). In several regions, worsening route safety has reduced mountaineering opportunities (medium confidence). Variability and decline in natural snow cover have compromised the operation of low-elevation ski resorts (high confidence). Glacier and snow decline have impacted aesthetic, spiritual and other cultural aspects of mountain landscapes (medium confidence), reducing the well-being of people (e.g., in the Himalaya, eastern Africa, and the tropical Andes). {2.3.5, 2.3.6}\n\nAdaptation in agriculture, tourism and drinking water supply has aimed to reduce the impacts of cryosphere change (medium confidence), though there is limited evidence on their effectiveness owing to a lack of formal evaluations, or technical, financial and institutional barriers to implementation. In some places, artificial snowmaking has reduced the negative impacts on ski tourism (medium confidence). Release and storage of water from reservoirs according to sectoral needs (agriculture, drinking water, ecosystems) has reduced the impact of seasonal variability on runoff (medium confidence). {2.3.1, 2.3.5}\n\nFuture projections of cryospheric changes, their impacts and risks, and adaptation in high mountain areas\n\nSnow cover, glaciers and permafrost are projected to continue to decline in almost all regions throughout the 21st century (high confidence). Compared to 1986–2005, low elevation snow depth will likely decrease by 10–40% for 2031–2050, regardless of Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and for 2081–2100, likely by 10–40 % for RCP2.6 and by 50–90% for RCP8.5. Projected glacier mass reductions between 2015–2100 are likely 22–44% for RCP2.6 and 37–57% for RCP8.5. In regions with mostly smaller glaciers and relatively little ice cover (e.g., European Alps, Pyrenees, Caucasus, North Asia, Scandinavia, tropical Andes, Mexico, eastern Africa and Indonesia), glaciers will lose more than 80% of their current mass by 2100 under RCP8.5 (medium confidence), and many glaciers will disappear regardless emission scenario (very high confidence). Permafrost thaw and degradation will increase during the 21st century (very high confidence) but quantitative projections are scarce. {2.2.2, 2.2.3}\n\nMost types of natural hazards are projected to change in frequency, magnitude and areas affected as the cryosphere continues to decline (high confidence). Glacier retreat and permafrost thaw are projected to decrease the stability of mountain slopes and increase the number and area of glacier lakes (high confidence). Resulting landslides and floods, and cascading events, will also emerge where there is no record of previous events (high confidence). Snow avalanches are projected to decline in number and runout distance at lower elevation, and avalanches involving wet snow even in winter will occur more frequently (medium confidence). Rain-on-snow floods will occur earlier in spring and later in autumn, and be more frequent at higher elevations and less frequent at lower elevations (high confidence). {2.3.2, 2.3.3}\n\nRiver runoff in snow dominated and glacier-fed river basins will change further in amount and seasonality in response to projected snow cover and glacier decline (very high confidence) with negative impacts on agriculture, hydropower and water quality in some regions (medium confidence). The average winter snowmelt runoff is projected to increase (high confidence), and spring peaks to occur earlier (very high confidence). Projected trends in annual runoff vary substantially among regions, and can even be opposite in direction, but there is high confidence that in all regions average annual runoff from glaciers will have reached a peak that will be followed by declining runoff at the latest by the end of the 21st century. Declining runoff is expected to reduce the productivity of irrigated agriculture in some regions (medium confidence). Hydropower operations will increasingly be impacted by altered amount and seasonality of water supply from snow and glacier melt (high confidence). The release of heavy metals, particularly mercury, and other legacy contaminants currently stored in glaciers and permafrost, is projected to reduce water quality for freshwater biota, household use and irrigation (medium confidence). {2.3.1}\n\nCurrent trends in cryosphere-related changes in high mountain ecosystems are expected to continue and impacts to intensify (very high confidence). While high mountains will provide new and greater habitat area, including refugia for lowland species, both range expansion and shrinkage are projected, and at high elevations this will lead to population declines (high confidence). The latter increases the risk of local extinctions, in particular for freshwater cold-adapted species (medium confidence). Without genetic plasticity and/or behavioural shifts, cryospheric changes will continue to negatively impact endemic and native species, such as some coldwater fish (e.g., trout) and species whose traits directly depend on snow (e.g., snowshoe hares) or many large mammals (medium confidence). The survival of such species will depend on appropriate conservation and adaptation measures (medium confidence). Many projected ecological changes will alter ecosystem services (high confidence), affecting ecological disturbances (e.g., fire, rock fall, slope erosion) with considerable impacts on people (medium confidence). {2.3.3}\n\nCultural assets, such as snow- and ice-covered peaks in many UNESCO World Heritage sites, and tourism and recreation activities, are expected to be negatively affected by future cryospheric change in many regions (high confidence). Current snowmaking technologies are projected to be less effective in a warmer climate in reducing risks to ski tourism in most parts of Europe, North America and Japan, in particular at 2°C global warming and beyond (high confidence). Diversification through year-round activities supports adaptation of tourism under future climate change (medium confidence). {2.3.5, 2.3.6}\n\nEnablers and response options to promote adaptation and sustainable development in high mountain areas\n\nThe already committed and unavoidable climate change affecting all cryosphere elements, irrespective of the emission scenario, points to integrated adaptation planning to support and enhance water availability, access, and management (medium confidence). Integrated management approaches for water across all scales, in particular for energy, agriculture, ecosystems and drinking water supply, can be effective at dealing with impacts from changes in the cryosphere. These approaches also offer opportunities to support social-ecological systems, through the development and optimisation of storage and the release of water from reservoirs (medium confidence), while being cognisant of potential negative implications for some ecosystems. Success in implementing such management options depends on the participation of relevant stakeholders, including affected communities, diverse knowledge and adequate tools for monitoring and projecting future conditions, and financial and institutional resources to support planning and implementation (medium confidence). {2.3.1, 2.3.3, 2.4}\n\nEffective governance is a key enabler for reducing disaster risk, considering relevant exposure factors such as planning, zoning, and urbanisation pressures, as well as vulnerability factors such as poverty, which can challenge efforts towards resilience and sustainable development for communities (medium confidence). Reducing losses to disasters depend on integrated and coordinated approaches to account for the hazards concerned, the degree of exposure, and existing vulnerabilities. Diverse knowledge that includes community and multi-stakeholder experience with past impacts complements scientific knowledge to anticipate future risks. {CCB-1, 2.3.2, 2.4}\n\nInternational cooperation, treaties and conventions exist for some mountain regions and transboundary river basins with potential to support adaptation action. However, there is limited evidence on the extent to which impacts and losses arising from changes in the cryosphere are specifically monitored and addressed in these frameworks. A wide range of institutional arrangements and practices have emerged over the past three decades that respond to a shared global mountain agenda and specific regional priorities. There is potential to strengthen them to also respond to climate-related cryosphere risks and open opportunities for development through adaptation (limited evidence, high agreement). The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Sendai Framework and Paris Agreement have directed some attention in mountain-specific research and practice towards the monitoring and reporting on targets and indicators specified therein. {2.3.1, 2.4}\n\nThe governance of key resources that are affected by climate-related changes in the cryosphere, such as water, is a relevant aspect for climate resilient sustainable development in mountains at the catchment level (Section 2.3.1.4). In this section, we address broader policy frameworks that are expected to shape a solution space through global action. An important development since AR5, at the global level, is the adoption of key frameworks that include the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 20151033), UN 2030 Agenda and its SDGs (UN, 2015), and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR, 20151034), which call for integrated and coordinated climate adaptation action that is also relevant for and applicable in mountain regions.\n\nIn international climate policy, the importance of averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage associated with adverse impacts of climate change is articulated in the Paris Agreement under Article 8, more specifically (UNFCCC, 20151035). However, despite evident impacts of climate change on the mountain cryosphere (Section 2.3.2), there is limited evidence or reference in the literature to loss and damage for mountains, globally (Huggel et al., 20191036). With already committed and unavoidable climate change, its effects on the high mountain cryosphere (Section 2.2) and related impacts and risks (Section 2.3), substantial adverse effects are expected in the coming decades (Huggel et al., 20191037), especially at high emission scenarios, which renders this issue a relevant aspect for planning climate resilient development in mountains. At least in one region, a concrete example for responding to and translating the Paris Agreement in a transboundary mountain setting, is reported. In 2015, through policy measures afforded by the Alpine Convention for the European Alps, the ministers for the environment of the Alpine countries established the Alpine Climate Board, who at the XV Alpine Conference in April 2019, presented a climate target system that includes strategic targets for ‘climate-resilient Alps’ (Hojesky et al., 20191038). The implementation and monitoring of these initiatives, however, remains to be assessed on an evidentiary basis. Furthermore, mechanisms afforded through the workplan of the Warsaw International Mechanism, specifically its work area under ‘Non-economic loss and damage’, are prospects relevant to address impacts to cultural and intrinsic values associated with losses in the high mountain cryosphere (UNFCCC Secretariat, 20141039; Serdeczny, 20191040).\n\nMonitoring and reporting on progress towards sustainable development through the implementation of the SDGs (UN, 2015) is receiving some research attention in the context of mountain regions (Rasul and Tripura, 2016; Gratzer and Keeton, 20171041; Bracher et al., 20181042; Wymann von Dach et al., 20181043 ; Kulonen et al., 20191044; Mishra et al., 20191045), noting key mountain specific considerations to improve the conditions under which the SDGs may serve a purpose in the mountain context. For example, previous research has identified a need for disaggregated data for SDG indicators and targets at subnational scales, with relevant area units that are both within country boundaries and/or across borders in transboundary settings (Rasul and Tripura, 2016; Bracher et al., 20181046; Wymann von Dach et al., 20181047). Furthermore, the use of non-standardised proxy data can further limit the potential for comparisons between countries and within regions (Bracher et al., 20181049; Kulonen et al., 20191050). On substance, assessments of the economic performance of livelihood options, combined with robust socioeconomic data for mountain systems, are still lacking in many parts of the world, compromising the ability for meaningful comparison and aggregation of data and knowledge for monitoring and reporting on progress of SDGs at regional or global scales (Gratzer and Keeton, 20171051).\n\nDisasters associated with natural hazards in high mountains are placing many communities and their potential for sustainable development at risk (Wymann von Dach et al., 20171052; Keiler and Fuchs, 20181053; Vaidya et al., 20191054). The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 (UNISDR, 20151055) offers a global policy framework under which risks, including climate change, can be accounted for and addressed at national scales. However, there is limited evidence in monitoring and reporting on progress on targets therein (Wymann von Dach et al., 20171056), particularly in systematically reporting on root causes of disasters in high mountains and associated compounded risks and cascading impacts, and even more so when accounting for impacts related to climate change. Technical guidelines available for the high mountain context provide complementary means to monitor and report on the effectiveness of measures to reduce associated risks with changes in the cryosphere (e.g., GAPHAZ, 2017).\n\nOther relevant frameworks include the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, enacted to protect the planet’s most significant and irreplaceable places from loss or damage (UNESCO, 19721057). In it, conservation strategies are listed that aim at preserving natural and cultural heritage across regions, including sites that contain glaciers (Section 2.3.6), and are suggested as means to further support efforts towards the promotion of knowledge, collective cultural memory and climate policy (Bosson et al., 20191058).\n\nOverall, there are promising prospects through international policy frameworks to support governance and adaptation to climate-related changes in the mountain cryosphere whilst addressing sustainable development, with evidence suggesting that treaties and conventions are relevant enablers to support cooperation and implementation at the mountain region scale (Dinar et al., 20161059). However, there is limited evidence to systematically assess for effectiveness in addressing specific challenges posed by changes in the mountain cryosphere, globally.\n\nImpacts associated with climate-related changes in the high mountain cryosphere are evident in the observations reported in this chapter (Section 2.3). However, uncertainties remain with detection and attribution of key atmospheric drivers that influence much of these climate-related changes (Section 2.2.1), due to limited spatial density and/or temporal extent of observation records at high elevations. For example, trends in total or solid precipitation at high elevation remain highly uncertain, due to intrinsic uncertainties with in situ observation methods, and large natural variability. There are clear knowledge gaps in the distribution and characteristics of cryospheric variables, in particular the extent and ice content of permafrost in mountains, but also current glacier ice volumes, trends in lake and river ice, and the spatial and temporal variation of snow cover. These knowledge gaps persist despite a wealth of new data since AR5 especially from Earth observation satellites, which overcome much of the remoteness and inaccessibility of high mountains yet still face challenges for observations in mountains such as dealing with cloud cover and rugged terrain. Along with improved capacities to generate and integrate diverse observation data, initiatives such as citizen science (e.g., Dickerson-Lange et al., 2016; Wikstrom Jones et al., 20181060) or Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge (Section 1.8.2, Cross Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1) can also complement some observations that are based on conventional instruments and models. Radiative forcing effects of light absorbing particles, and understanding their spatiotemporal dynamics, is a key knowledge gap for the attribution of changes in high mountain snow and glaciers and the understanding of regional feedbacks (Section 2.2.2, Box 2.2).\n\nThese observational knowledge gaps currently impede efforts to quantify trends, and to calibrate and evaluate models that simulate the past and future evolution of the cryosphere and its impacts. Specific uncertainties are associated with projections of future climate change trends at high elevations due mostly to current limits in regional climate models and downscaling methods to capture the subtle interplays between large-scale climate change and local phenomena influenced by complex topography and high relief (Section 2.2.1). Coarse-scale simulations of future permafrost conditions in high mountains are fraught with difficulties in capturing fine-scale variation of topography, surface cover and near-surface materials (Section 2.2.4). Improved cross-disciplinary studies bringing together current observation and modelling approaches in each specific field hold potential to contribute to addressing these gaps in the future.\n\nExperiences with changes in water availability, and with changes in frequency and/or magnitude of natural hazards, demonstrate the relevance of integrated approaches to understand past impacts and prepare for future risks, where exposure and the underpinning existing vulnerabilities of mountain socioecological systems influence the extent of these impacts (Section 2.3.2.3). However, there is insufficient understanding of the effects of cryospheric change on some natural hazards such as glacier outburst floods and on infrastructure, for example for transportation. Increased wildfire risk with a shrinking cryosphere is an uncertainty both spatially and temporally and with consequent effects on mountain ecosystems, particularly with respect to soil carbon and potential biome shifts. Overall, few studies have taken a comprehensive risk approach to systematically characterise and compare magnitude and extent of past impacts and future risks across high mountain regions, including compound risks and cascading impacts where instances of deep uncertainty in responses and outcomes may arise (Cross Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1). Furthermore, a key knowledge gap is the capacity to economically quantify cryosphere-specific impacts and potential risks.\n\nWith ecosystems, particularly the terrestrial component, uncertainty exists at which community changes can be directly linked to cryospheric change as distinct from those due to atmospheric warming. In some cases, the changes can be linked, for example, where a receding glacier creates new habitat, but rising air temperature allow some species to establish that would not otherwise be able to. A major research gap is in our understanding of the fate of legacy pollutants such as mercury downstream of their release from glaciers and permafrost in terms of quantity and regional differences, freshwater sinks, and potential effects to ecosystems and human health. Similarly, the effect of permafrost thaw on water quality and ecosystems due to the increasing release of natural heavy metals and nutrients represents a gap in knowledge.\n\nWhile adaptation measures are reported for high mountain cryosphere changes (Figure 2.9 a), it stands as a relatively new and developing area of research since AR5 (Figure 2.9 b), with particular gaps in terms of systematically evaluating their cost-benefits and long-term effectiveness as ‘fit-for-purpose’ solutions in the mountain context. Improved inter-comparability of successful adaptation cases, including the transferability of evidence for how adaptation can address both climate change and sustainable development objectives in different mountain regions, are prospects to support an evidentiary basis for future assessments of adaptation to cryosphere changes in the high mountains (Adler et al., 20191061; McDowell et al., 20191062)."
