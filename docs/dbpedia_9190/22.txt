The Subalpine Republic was a short-lived republic established in June 1802 on the territory of the Piedmont during the Napoleonic era.

It was annexed to France in September 1802 as the départements of Doire, Marengo, Pô (briefly named "Éridan", after Eridanos), Sesia, Stura, and Tanaro.

The Subalpine Republic leaned heavily on France: it introduced French style reforms and its coinage was based on the French Franc. [ [http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/italy/piemrep.html WHKMLA : History of the Subalpine/Piemontese Republic, 1797-1801 ] ]

The structure of government was a Provisional Executive.
