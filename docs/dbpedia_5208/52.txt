East London, port city, Eastern Cape province, South Africa. It lies at the mouth of the Buffalo River along the Indian Ocean.

Buffalo Harbour, first visited by the British in 1836 and named Port Rex, was used as a supply base during the seventh Cape Frontier War (1846). The next year, Fort Glamorgan (now a prison) was built, and the site was annexed to Cape Colony as the Port of East London. It prospered after the arrival of German settlers in the late 1850s, becoming a town in 1873 and a city in 1914.
