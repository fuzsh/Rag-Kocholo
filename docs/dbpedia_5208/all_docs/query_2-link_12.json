        "text": "Home\n\nPlaces\n\nEast London\n\nEast London, affectionately known as Buffalo City by the locals, is situated 1 000 km from Cape Town on the southeast coast of South Africa. Situated in between the Nahoon River in the north and the Buffalo River to the south, East London is home to the only river port in South Africa.\n\nEast London offers sweeping beaches, ideal for sailing, swimming, water skiing and boating, to be enjoyed all year round. East London has a population of about 250 000 residents, with over 700 000 in the metropolitan area. The motor industry is dominant in East London.\n\nThough quite small, East London is a great place for tourist looking for the sea and sun, without the regular rush of holidaymakers. East London is also the ideal destination from which to explore the north eastern mountains and the Wild Coast.\n\nEnjoy the sun, sea and surf during the day, and, when the sun sets, enjoy the many cinemas, theatres and restaurants this city has to offer. he climate in the Western Cape is typically Mediterranean and is usually warm and dry in the summer and mild and moist in the winter. Rain is frequent during the winter months."
