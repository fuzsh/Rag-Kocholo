        "text": "Port Overview\n\nThe port of Durban is the main container port on the South African coastline. While handling approximately 60% of South Africa’s container traffic, the port serves KwaZulu-Natal, the Gauteng region and a large portion of the Southern African hinterland. Together with containers the port also accommodates dry bulk, liquid bulk, automotive and break bulk. Other present port activities, include facilities for local fishing industry, ship repair industries, visiting cruise liner vessels and recreational boating. The Port of Durban is bounded by the city of centre to the north, residential areas to the west and east, and industrial land to the south.\n\nThe port, like all others in South Africa, is operated on a common-user basis and is managed by Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) – through it’s terminal operators organ Transnet Port Terminal (TPT), which provides and maintains the infrastructure as well as the superstructure of the port. TNPA provides cargo handling (except stevedoring aboard vessels which is undertaken by private enterprise) and marine services including tugs and pilotage. Cargo handling facilities are provided on a non-discriminatory basis, whilst vessels are served on a first planned-first served basis. Where necessary, special purpose quays may be provided on a common-user basis for the handling of specific commodities or types of cargo such as ore, grain, bulk cargoes, unitised cargo and containers.\n\nPort website:http://www.transnetnationalportsauthority.net/OurPorts/Durban/Pages/Port-Directory.aspx\n\nKey port information may also be found at: http://www.maritime-database.com\n\nPort Picture\n\nA number of companies operate within the port precinct and offer diverse or specialised services. Within the port certain berths / terminals have been concessioned to private operators some of these are Maydon Wharf – operated by the Grindrod Group offering container and breakbulk facilities, as well as port of call for a regional feeder Ocean Africa Container Lines (OACL), Bluff terminal – providing mineral handling facilities and Island View – offering hydrocarbons handling facilities.\n\nFor more information on port contacts, please see the following link:4.4 Port and Waterways Companies Contact List.\n\nPort Performance\n\nThe Port of Durban offers extensive safe anchorage outside the port.

Transnet National Port Authority has installed advanced security features such as closed-circuit television for some of its terminals and Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) that allow for remote ship identification by port control. The most obvious aspect of this compliance is that it impact access to ports by non-port related users. Many areas previously accessible by the general public such as cargo working terminals and ship repair lay-up quays are now only accessible by authorized personnel. The new Security regulations required the appointment of a Port Security Officer for each port and a Port Facility Security Officer for each terminal. These persons will coordinate security planning, implementation and maintenance between the port authority and port facility operators.\n\nThe wide-area surveillance and perimeter protection solution at Durban Port is comprised of an 'intelligent' command and control system that transforms a network of cameras into intelligent object detection, tracking and recording sensors. At Durban's Port over 120 cameras were placed on the perimeter with the addition of 13 PTZ cameras. Any breach in the perimeter or suspicious behaviour detected by the cameras sets off an alarm in the control centre via the command centre software, enabling the security personnel can react accordingly.\n\nSecurity\n\nISPS Compliant\n\nYes\n\nCurrent ISPS Level\n\n(Level 1 = Normal, Level 2 = Heightened, Level 3 = Exceptional)\n\nLevel 1 = Normal\n\nPolice Boats\n\nYes\n\nFire Engines\n\nYes\n\nPort Overview\n\nThe Port of Cape Town is the premier port for the Western Cape region, providing a wide range of round-the-clock port operations.

Located in the Duncan Dock area of the harbour and in close proximity to major transport routes, the terminal operates within an area with a quayside length of almost 1.8 kilometers with a current staff complement of approximately 220 persons. Cape Town MPT trades with over 20 countries.\n\nGeneral cargo is served by the six berths of the Multi-purpose and Combi terminals, which between them handle a wide range of goods – up to 90 commodities on the ports list – from timber to frozen fish.\n\nGrain and Bulk Handling\n\nThe average tonnage of all grains imported through the Port of Cape Town that can be expected in a month is approximately 90 000 tons. The maximum tonnage of all grains imported through the Port of Cape Town that can be expected in a month is approximately 180 000 tons. Bagging is generally not available for Cape Town Multipurpose Terminal (MPT), however may be discussed with Fresh Produce Terminal (FPT).\n\nMain Storage Terminal\n\nLimited warehousing (shed) space is available in the terminal as terminals are throughput focused. Fresh Produce Terminal (FPT), a private terminal operator (concession) has some warehousing space on their quayside. Privately held cold storage capacity is also available within the port precinct, to serve the agricultural (eg. fruits, animal proteins) and foodstuffs manufacturing (eg. dairy products) industries, such as CCS Logistics.\n\nStorage Type\n\nNumber of Storage Facilities\n\nArea (m2)\n\nBagged Cargo\n\n1 FPT\n\n27848\n\nRefrigerated Cargo\n\n5 CCS\n\n46,500 MT\n\nGeneral Cargo\n\n1 FPT\n\n27848\n\nStevedoring\n\nThe following stevedoring services are offered by Transnet Port Terminals :\n\nstowage of cargo\n\nlashing and securing of cargo\n\nbreaking out of cargo\n\nplanning of cargo to stowage plan\n\noperating ships equipment\n\ncleaning of hatches and tanks\n\nOther private stevedore services companies are also available with operations in various port locations around South Africa.\n\nDuncan Dock Cold Storage Stevedoring Services provides the clients of the cold storage facility with a one stop service in discharging vessel to the cold store.\n\nCargo Handling Specialists\n\n5 Carlisle Street, Paarden Eiland,\n\nSouth Africa, 7405\n\nowen@cargohs.co.za\n\n082 457 9557\n\n(021) 511-9748\n\nPort Stevedoring (PS)\n\nhttps://www.portstevedoring.co.za/\n\n+27 (0) 21 401 8847\n\nSouth Arm Road, Duncan Dock,\n\nTable Bay Harbour, Cape Town, 8001,\n\nWestern Cape\n\nBidfreight Port Operations\n\nTel: +27 (0)21 421 3122\n\nFax: +27 (0)21 421 3136\n\nAlkmaar Road, Table Bay Harbour, Cape Town, 8001, Western Cape\n\nEmail: capetown@bidports.co.za\n\nHinterland Information\n\nFrom the port strategic channels are provided to facilitate the smooth flow of cargo from the port terminals and vice versa, these include a roadway systems that interlinks with the rest of the country, rail services are also available from the port connecting the major commercial centres in a hub and spoke layout and linking to multimodal transit hubs for further connectivity. The terminal as a seaport gateway holds significant interconnectivity to the rest of South Africa and some of its Sub-Saharan neighbours (Namibia, Botswana, Angola) by means of mainly road network and feeder vessel transport (coastal countries, ie. Namibia & Angola). The port serves as a major export gateway to the agricultural industry servicing areas as far afield as the Northern Cape and Limpopo province, with reserve logistics feasible.\n\nPort Security\n\nThere are police, ambulances and fire-fighting services available. Private security companies are available for 24 hour on-board service. Stowaways do pose a problem in Cape Town, however to a small degree, nonetheless, Masters are advised to take the necessary precautions and do stowaway searches before the vessel sails. Firemen are on duty at all tanker and bunker berths whilst vessels are working cargoes/bunkering. Transnet National Port Authority has installed advanced security features such as closed-circuit television for some of its terminals and Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) that allow for remote ship identification by port control. The most obvious aspect of this compliance is that it impact access to ports by non-port related users. Many areas previously accessible by the general public such as cargo working terminals and ship repair lay-up quays are now only accessible by authorized personnel. The new Security regulations required the appointment of a Port Security Officer for each port and a Port Facility Security Officer for each terminal. These persons will coordinate security planning, implementation and maintenance between the port authority and port facility operators.\n\nSecurity\n\nISPS Compliant\n\nYes\n\nCurrent ISPS Level\n\n(Level 1 = Normal, Level 2 = Heightened, Level 3 = Exceptional)\n\nLevel 1\n\nPolice Boats\n\nYes\n\nFire Engines\n\nYes\n\nAirport Overview\n\nO.
