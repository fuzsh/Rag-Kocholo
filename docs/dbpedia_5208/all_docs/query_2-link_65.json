The coal, produced by SNR's Elitheni mine in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, would be shipped out of East London Port. Once the mine \"has reached full production,\" Port Elizabeth would be used as well. SNR, advised by LCB, was in discussions with potential customers for the coal.\n\nBooming Asian demand for South African coal, led by India and China, prompted producers to look for new routes to take advantage of the high coal prices of around $120 a tonne, which give exporters a reported profit of over $60. LCB had sold 200 million tonnes of coal since its inception in 2005, including over 22 million tonnes of South African coal from RBCT in 2010.\n\n2014 cancellation\n\nAs of early 2015, plans for a coal export terminal at the Port of East London have definitively been scuttled, due to the insolvency of terminal developer Elitheni Coal as well as pollution concerns raised by Mercedes Benz South Africa (MBSA), which operates a large manufacturing plant in East London. In February 2012, MBSA publicly expressed concerns that its automobile painting operations would be negatively impacted by pollutants associated with the loading and off-loading of coal.[2]\n\nIn November 2013, Elitheni Coal, developer of the East London coal export terminal, shut down its Elitheni Mine and experienced a hostile takeover after incurring unpaid debts of over 20 million rand. Elitheni Coal's new management subsequently announced their intent to develop a coal power station at the mine rather than exporting coal through East London.[3]\n\nIn June 2014, the Transnet Group, which oversees operations at all South African ports, confirmed that plans for the East London coal export terminal had been cancelled, despite Transnet's investment of over 80 million rand in mobile cranes and other infrastructure for the terminal. According to Transnet Port Terminals chief executive Brian Molefe, Transnet planned to move its cranes and other equipment from East London to a new multi-purpose terminal in Ngqura, the Port of Ngqura, which would begin handling exports of both manganese and coal by 2019.[4]\n\nTransnet Port Terminals\n\nAccording to Transnet Port Terminals's (TPT) website, the East London Terminal trades coal:\n\n\"The East London Terminal (MPT) consists of a Ro-Ro terminal, the largest grain silo on the South African coastline, break-bulk and containerised cargo facilities. The NOSCAR rated Ro-Ro facility includes a sophisticated multi-level car terminal. Established in 1963, the terminal currently employs over 120 people. Recent investments in equipment varying from straddle carriers, reach stacker and forklifts â€“ have seen a focused plan delivering an efficient service that has boosted terminal handling. The East London Terminal still has ample capacity and an ability to attract more volumes across varying cargo including heavy equipment. The terminal handles import and export cargo like motor vehicle components, textiles, sugar, rice, timber, scrap steel, automotive and chemicals.\"\n\nHowever, it only lists a break bulk capacity of 0.21 million tons per annum (in addition to agricultural and automotive capacities) as of 2021.[5]\n\nProject Details\n\nOperator: London Commodity Brokers\n\nLocation: South Africa\n\nProposed Capacity (Tonnes): 2 million\n\nStatus: Cancelled\n\nType: Exports\n\nCoal Source: Elitheni Mine\n\nArticles and resources\n\nReferences\n\nRelated GEM.wiki articles"
