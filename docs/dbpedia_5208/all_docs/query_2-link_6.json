        "text": "East London is a port city on the southeastern coast of South Africa. It lies where the Buffalo River empties into the Indian Ocean. East London is run by the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality. The municipality is a local government in South Africa’s Eastern Cape province.\n\nEast London is situated between the Nahoon River, to the north, and the Buffalo River, to the south. The largest part of the city is on the banks of the Buffalo River. The city has wide, straight streets and gardens.\n\nFishing is important to the city’s economy. Cars are manufactured there as well. East London is also a popular destination for vacationers, tourists, and surfers. It is known for its beautiful white beaches.\n\nBritish settlers landed at the mouth of the Buffalo River in 1836. They hoisted their flag at a place they called Port Rex. In 1846 the British used the site as a base during their seventh border war with the Xhosa people. The British built Fort Glamorgan (now a prison) there in 1847. That year the settlement became a part of the British Cape Colony. It was renamed the Port of East London. East London grew after German settlers arrived in the late 1850s. It became a town in 1873 and a city in 1914."
