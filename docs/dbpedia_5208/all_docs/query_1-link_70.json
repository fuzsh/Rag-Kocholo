        "text": "THE START\n\nThe 17,5km Challenge starts at the mouth of the Kwelera River situated just north of East London, on a narrow gravel road, but soon ventures onto the beach where runners will be welcomed by rocks, loose boulders, stones, shingle and soft sand on the way past Rainbow Valley.\n\nThe Gonubie River, the first of two meaningful rivers to be crossed, is encountered at about 6km into the race. Runners are diverted off Gonubie Beach, past the caravan park and up a 350m hill behind the sand dune. The run down to the hotel is pleasant, while the crowds in Gonubie will lift participants all the way to Eastward Ho, where we meet up with a tricky little path, loose stones and sea sand again.\n\nThe going gets a little easier on the approach to Bonza Bay, where the Quinera Lagoon is unlikely to be open. Roughly 2km more of beach and the Nahoon River awaits, after which a few hundred metres are left before reaching the welcoming crowds at the finish\n\nSTART TIME\n\n14:30 (at Kwelera River Mouth)\n\nCUT-OFF TIME (halfway cut-off)\n\n17:00 in Gonubie\n\nFINISH TIME\n\n18:00\n\nTHE START\n\nThe 17,5km surf ski paddle race starts at the mouth of the Kwelera River and ends at Nahoon Beach at the Finish line. The paddles need to go to the Yellow Sands Caravan park side.\n\nTo enter our paddling race please follow the link provided: https://paddler.canoesa.com\n\nPaddlers will not be able to enter at the registration hall on the day as all entries must go via the Canoe SA website. Once entered ALL PADDLERS must attend registration at the Registration Hall.\n\nSTART TIME\n\n14:30 (at Kwelega Mouth)\n\nCUT-OFF TIME (halfway cut-off)\n\n17:00\n\nFINISH TIME\n\n18:00\n\nTHE START\n\nTHE START\n\nThe Surfers 10km is a race is setup for runners and walkers wishing to test their limits along the grueling Eastern Cape coast line.\n\nStarting at the iconic Gonubie Hotel, this fun yet challenging race distance kicks off at 13:45 and follows the route of the 17.5km Challenge thereafter.\n\nSTART TIME\n\n13:45 (at the Gonubie Hotel)\n\nCUT-OFF TIME (halfway cut-off)\n\n16:00\n\nFINISH TIME\n\n17:30\n\nPlease note:\n\nThe first 1300 participants to finish will receive a Surfers Challenge shirt.\n\nTHE START\n\nThis race starts with the Juniors race at the bottom of the BLUE LAGOON HOTEL. The course follows the Juniors race. That means to finish, the participants will then cross the river and finish at the same finishing line as all the other races.\n\nSTART TIME\n\n13:00 (from the bottom of the Blue Lagoon Hotel)\n\nFINISH TIME\n\n13:50\n\nPlease note:\n\nFinisher T-Shirts: 5km – OPEN – first 300 to complete the race and 5km – JUNIORS – first 200 to complete the race."
