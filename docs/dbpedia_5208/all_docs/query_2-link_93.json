        "text": "EASTERN CAPE NEWS - The Eastern Cape, situated along South Africa's east coast, is flanked by the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, while inland, it shares borders with the Northern Cape and Free State provinces, as well as Lesotho.\n\nIts diverse landscape encompasses the semi-arid expanse of the Great Karoo, the lush forests of the Wild Coast and Keiskamma Valley, the fertile Langkloof as well as the rugged terrain of the southern Drakensberg mountains.\n\nNotably, its coastline along the Indian Ocean is a prominent feature. Spanning an area of 168,966km², the Eastern Cape is the second-largest and third most populated province in South Africa, with a population of 6,996,976.\n\nIts capital is Bisho, with major urban centres including Gqeberha (Port Elizabeth), East London, Makhanda (formerly Grahamstown), Mthatha (formerly Umtata), Graaff-Reinet, Cradock and Port St Johns.\n\nDespite its natural wealth, the Eastern Cape faces socio-economic challenges, ranking among South Africa's poorest provinces, particularly due to the incorporation of vast former homeland areas.\n\nNevertheless, the region boasts significant agricultural and forestry potential. The Langkloof Valley is renowned for its expansive deciduous fruit orchards, while the Karoo supports vital sheep farming.\n\nThe Alexandria-Makhanda area specializes in pineapple, chicory and dairy production, with coffee and tea cultivation thriving at Magwa.\n\nThe former Transkei region relies heavily on cattle, maize and sorghum farming.\n\nEconomically, the metropolitan centres of Port Elizabeth and East London drive manufacturing activities with a focus on motor vehicle production, positioning the province as a key player in South Africa's automotive industry.\n\nAdministratively, the Eastern Cape is structured into two metropolitan municipalities (Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality and Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality) and six district municipalities (Alfred Nzo, Amathole, Chris Hani, Joe Gqabi, OR Tambo and Sarah Baartman) further divided into 31 local municipalities, which include Dr Beyers Naudé Local Municipality in the Sarah Baartman District Municipality and Inxuba Yethemba Local Municipality in the Chris Hani District Municipality."
