However, the region has long struggled with water access, exacerbated by severe droughts, inadequate rainfall, and poor maintenance of water infrastructure. These challenges are not unique to Buffalo City but are reflective of wider issues faced by South Africa, including aging infrastructure, diminishing water supplies, and high water losses.\n\nIn line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG.6), the municipality has forged a partnership with the Department of Water and Sanitation, GIZ/Engagement Global, and the City of Oldenburg in Germany to ensure the availability of clean water and sanitation for its citizens. Since 2022, the city has initiated an awareness-raising project aimed at protecting its clean water resources, reducing water loss, and preventing contamination. This endeavor aligns seamlessly with South Africa’s National Water and Sanitation master plan."
