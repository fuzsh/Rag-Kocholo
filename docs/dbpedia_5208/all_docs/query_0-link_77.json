        "meta_description": "The epilogue is focused on Ishtiyaq Shukri’s The Silent Minaret (2005), which recounts the disappearance of a South African student of Muslim heritage in post-9/11 London. Shukri’s novel is presented as an example of post-transitional South African writing, which travels beyond the national context to include reflections on global forms of both conviviality and racism. The Silent Minaret continues a tradition within South African writing that engages with the global, while remaining rooted in the twin locations of South Africa and London, and through its introduction of other locations, such as Palestine, the novel also exemplifies the reach of contemporary South African literature beyond South Africa and the West. Furthermore, Shukri moves beyond a comparison of national contexts since he aims towards the transcendence of nationalisms or national identities altogether.",
