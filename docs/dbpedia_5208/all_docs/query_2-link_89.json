        "text": "The East London Guild Theatre is a dynamic playhouse facility, producing and presenting performing arts in Buffalo City, Eastern Cape. The Guild Theatre has been home to some of South Africa’s leading artists and emerging local performers, as well as several international acts, since 1962.\n\nSituated on the South East coast of South Africa in the City of East London. The East London Aquarium was officially opened on the 2nd of December 1931, which makes it the oldest public aquarium in the country. This is not a big aquarium, but some unique displays make it a must see. The aquarium plays an active role in conserving the coastline and the estuaries in the East London area.\n\nEstablished in 1921 and considered to be one of the most interesting natural and cultural history museums in the country.\n\nRegarded by all as a course every golfer should play, this delightful playing experience is set on fairways steeped in history.\n\nThe Nelson Mandela Museum is a not for profit institution established by the government of South Africa as part of a portfolio of legacy projects that seek to transform the heritage landscape from our apartheid past.\n\nBuffalo Park in East London hosts first-class and international cricket matches during South Africa’s summer months between October and March. The stadium is known for its friendly atmosphere and its accessibility."
