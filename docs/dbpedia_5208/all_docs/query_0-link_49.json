Hypertension unawareness was reported by 152 participants (23.1%) with significant gender difference (p=0.005). Male sex, age <45 years, higher level of education, single status, current employment, higher monthly income, current smoking, alcohol usage, absence of diabetes and non-obese were significantly associated (p<0.05) with hypertension unawareness.\n\nOf the participants who were aware of having hypertension (n=339), nearly all (91.7%, n=311) were on antihypertensive medication and only 121 participants (38.9%) achieved the BP treatment target. In the multivariate logistic regression model analysis, ageing (95% CI 1.9 to 4.4), being married (95% CI 1.0 to 2.0), male sex (95% CI 1.2 to 2.3), concomitant diabetes (95% CI 1.9 to 3.9), lower monthly income (95% CI 1.2 to 2.2), being unemployed (95% CI 1.0 to 1.9) and central obesity (95% CI 1.5 to 2.8) were the significant and independent determinants of prevalent hypertension.\n\nConclusion The prevalence and awareness of hypertension was high in the study population.

        "text": "Discussion\n\nTo the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first paper addressing epidemiological gaps regarding the prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension in the BCMM. We found a high prevalence of hypertension (49.2%) in our study population. There seems to be an upward trend in the prevalence of hypertension in the country which is rather unsurprising, given rapid urbanisation and its consequent effects on population health. Our result is higher than that in the study by Day et al,23 which reported a 40% prevalence of hypertension among South African adults in 2010. A lower prevalence of hypertension (38.9%) was reported by Peer et al25 among black urban South African adults between the ages of 24 and 65 years in Cape Town. A nationally representative household survey in South Africa which included individuals aged 15 years and above reported a prevalence range of 9% in Limpopo Province to 22.3% in Northern Cape Province.34 The highest prevalence of hypertension (12.4%) was found among the black South African population. Weimann et al40 estimated a higher prevalence, at 37% and 52%, in the Eastern Cape and Northwest Provinces. The higher prevalence of 49.2% found among our sample is comparable to Northwest Province’s 52%, but higher than the percentage reported for the Eastern Cape Province by Weimann et al40 with an almost similar age distribution. Our result was obtained from the primary healthcare setting and thus, may not be representative of the overall population. However, considering the age distribution of the study participants, with more than half below the age of 45, such a high prevalence of hypertension further signifies the need for urgent interventions as population ageing is often associated with a higher prevalence of hypertension.\n\nThere is a wide variation in the prevalence of hypertension across sub-Saharan Africa; from 23% among Zambian and Angolan adults to 26% in adults in four selected sub-Saharan African countries.10–12 41 Akpan et al9 reported a prevalence of 48.3% among rural adults in the eastern part of Nigeria, while a 44.7% prevalence was documented among rural Ghanaian adults. Similar trends of increasing hypertension prevalence have been reported worldwide; Chow et al30 found a prevalence of 40.8% among rural and urban dwellers in selected high-income countries (Canada, Sweden, United Arab Emirates), middle-income countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Poland, Turkey, Malaysia, South Africa, China, Colombia and Iran) and low-income countries (Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Zimbabwe). A higher prevalence was reported in certain other low-income and middle-income countries, with prevalence ranging from 50.7% to 79.8% among adults living in urban areas of India, Latin America and China.42 43 Our finding further supports the epidemiological shift of non-communicable diseases to low-income and middle-income nations.13 44\n\nAlthough a thorough comparison of various studies cannot be done as a result of differences in the definitions, methodology and populations used, the findings from this study indicate that South Africa is already at the forefront of the epidemiological transition. The shift is being exacerbated by advancements in technology attributed to urbanisation and westernisation. These are both the driving forces of the increasing burden of non-communicable disease risk factors of which hypertension is predominant. It is linked to the adoption of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, poor dietary practices and poor engagement in physical activity, leading to obesity, and ultimately, cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension. Our findings signal a looming burden of non-communicable disease among the study participants if urgent actions are not taken.\n\nWe found ageing, male sex, being married, unemployment status, poverty, sedentary lifestyles, obesity and diabetes mellitus as the important determinants of prevalent hypertension in the study population. Several other studies have also established a link between these risk factors. Pires et al12 affirmed that increasing age, lower level of education and increasing weight were associated with hypertension. Additionally, Guwatudde et al11 found diabetes to be significantly associated with hypertension. Increasing age is often associated with changes in the body systems, including the cardiovascular system such as the heart and arteries. Old people suffer a great deal of cardiovascular risk factors, especially hypertension.45\n\nWe found a higher prevalence of hypertension in individuals with a lower level of education (below grade 8). These individuals are most likely to be unemployed and to earn <R2000 per month. The association between level of education and health is rather complex; it can be assumed that the more educated an individual is, the more knowledgeable he or she will be on matters of health. Whether this assumption is true in our study population is rather speculative. Cutler and Lleras-Muney46 reported that education increases knowledge. Educated individuals are more likely to be receptive to new developments, including newly approved drugs, and are often compliant with drug use.47 48 Our study participants with hypertension were poor and unemployed. Their socioeconomic status might have limited their access to healthy foods and increased their consumption of readily available, cheap foods which contribute to risk factors such as obesity and hypertension. This should, however, be interpreted with caution, as being unemployed does not necessarily denote a low income. Underlying factors associated with unemployment, such as psychological stress, could contribute to the high prevalence of hypertension among this cohort. We found a higher prevalence of hypertension among men. Female hormonal effect is believed to be protective49 and since the majority of the women in this study were below the age of 50, this could be a plausible reason for our findings. Also, obesity, work stress, physical inactivity, alcohol intake and salt intake have been reported to be high in men, resulting in higher odds of men developing hypertension.50\n\nThere is a substantial intersection between hypertension and diabetes because of the shared metabolic pathway and risk factors.51–53 Hypertension is always found in more than half of individuals with type 2 diabetes and the chances of developing hypertension among persons with type 2 diabetes is more than double than that among persons with no diabetes.54 Also, as shown by Murphy et al and Bromfield and Munter,55 56 there is a recognised link between hypertension, obesity, smoking, harmful use of alcohol and physical inactivity and a large percentage of the hypertension burden is attributed to these factors. The relationship between hypertension and obesity has long been established. Obesity increases the chance of developing hypertension and increases the risk of developing cardiovascular complications.57 58 As reported by Pandey et al,59 smoking increases the prevalence of hypertension.53 Physical inactivity is a precursor to obesity and hypertension. Physical inactivity is responsible for 20% of hypertension cases.60\n\nThe present study further illustrates that the majority (69.1%) of the hypertensive patients were aware of their status, and of these, almost all (91.7%) were already on treatment with only 38.9% achieving control. This awareness rate is higher than the 24% awareness rate reported among South Asian adults.61 There is a wide variation of hypertension awareness across African countries with rates ranging from 8% in Nigeria to 81% among elderly individuals in Tunisia.62 Also, the study settings being health facilities might have contributed to the high awareness prevalence recorded in this study.\n\nDespite scientific successes in antihypertensive drug discoveries, achieving treatment targets remains a serious challenge. Although nearly all of the participants with prior diagnosis were already receiving treatment for hypertension, a commendable effort, only 38.9% achieved treatment targets. This is somewhat better than previous studies conducted in Mthatha, South Africa (25.5%) and Zimbabwe (32.8%).22 31 It is also comparable to the rate of control of hypertension (36.4%) reported by Day et al23 in a household survey conducted among South African adults in 2010. Generally, hypertension control has been reported to be suboptimal in Africa, ranging from 2.6% in Kenya to 42.2% in Ethiopia.62–64\n\nWe observed that men, those earning more than R2000 per month, those aged under 45 years, employed, cigarette smokers and alcohol users had higher rates of hypertension unawareness. Men have been reported to have higher odds of developing hypertension and the high rate of unawareness among them is not surprising. Females have been recognised as more likely to seek healthcare than men.65 Traditional gender roles in Africa account for the underutilisation of health facilities among men; men are the breadwinners and are perceived as healthy.66 67 Hence, they rarely visit health facilities for screening purposes unless they are sick. Hypertension is largely asymptomatic and this being the case, an affected individual will rarely seek healthcare. Our findings have serious public health consequences, due to the clustering of cardiovascular diseases among the individuals with hypertension unawareness. Younger individuals are unlikely to visit health facilities without any major sickness. Hence, the high rate of unawareness in those younger than 45 years. Besides, this cohort of individuals are preoccupied by their jobs. Older individuals tend to have multimorbidity and as such, would have had several opportunities to be screened for non-communicable diseases. Alcohol-dependence and nicotine-dependence may explain our findings of high unawareness among alcohol users and current cigarette smokers, respectively.\n\nWe found a high rate of uncontrolled hypertension (62.4%) in our study participants. Several factors have been implicated for the poor control of hypertension in Africa, which are generally related to deficiencies in the healthcare system, non-adherence to medication regimens by patients and physicians’ inertia to optimise treatment of hypertension.22 62 Several studies have documented the unavailability of antihypertensive drugs as well as non-adherence to clinic visits by patients as a result of lack of transportation and time.12 68 69 Poor treatment outcomes in Africa has been documented extensively.13 31 62 70 71 In comparison, higher levels of control (64.8% and 66%) of hypertension were reported in the USA and Canada, respectively.72 73 This is not a surprise as the management of hypertension is costly due to its chronic nature. High-income countries have been recording successes in the reduction of the burden related to hypertension and other non-communicable diseases.74\n\nAlso, participants who had diabetes mellitus were found to have a lower rate of controlled hypertension. Multimorbidity with significant risks of polypharmacy are some of the reasons for the poor control of blood pressure in those with concomitant diabetes. A study in a similar setting by Adeniyi et al22 found poor control of blood pressure among individuals with concomitant diabetes. Illiteracy was associated with poor blood pressure control among our study participants already on treatment for hypertension. Poor treatment outcomes among individuals with no formal education is not surprising. Despite the availability of medications at the health facility, some of our patients regularly miss appointments and fail to collect medications. Education is said to be ‘power’ and Cutler and Lleras-Muney46 assert that education increases knowledge. There is a possibility of a lack of adequate knowledge on the importance of medication use in the control of hypertension among illiterate persons. In addition, the benefits of positive lifestyle behaviours for the control of hypertension might not be fully appreciated by such individuals. Likewise, lack of education generally leads to poverty; thus, poorly educated patients are less likely to be able to purchase essential drugs for hypertension or to eat as healthily, as healthy foods tend to cost far more than low-cost, carbohydrate-rich foods.75\n\nStrengths and limitations\n\nThe limitations of the study cannot be ignored. First, this was a cross-sectional study, hence causality cannot be ascribed to the determinants. Our findings should be interpreted with caution in view of the convenience sampling of the participants at the primary healthcare facilities. We also did not obtain information on the hypertensive medications being used and therefore, could not gain a full understanding of the uncontrolled hypertension in our study participants. Notwithstanding these limitations, the findings of the study provide useful epidemiological data in view of the large sample size, the large outpatient clinics selected and the previously understudied setting."
