Located just outside the town, on Summerhill Farm, the Big Pineapple at 16.7m tall celebrates one of the region’s biggest natural exports, first planted here in 1865.

It was named Alexandria in 1856 after Reverend Alexander Smith.\n\nAlexandria is known for pineapple production and dairy farming. The Alexandria area also includes the Alexandria State Forest, known as Woody Cape, which is a narrow stretch of pristine indigenous forest bordering the Alexandria dune field, one of the largest active dune fields in the world. Mammals that occur within the area include bushpig, bushbuck, Cape Grysbok, steenbok, common duiker, Vervet monkey, and large and small grey mongoose. The bird diversity is considerable and includes the westernmost population of the trumpeter hornbill, there are also crowned hornbills, crowned eagle, Stanley’s bustard, narina trogon and Damara tern.

Its chief claim to fame is that it was the administrative centre for the 1820 British Settlers who were established in the district as a buffer between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa pastoralists who were migrating southwards and westwards along the coast. Bathurst is part of the Ndlambe Local Municipality in the Sarah Baartman District.\n\nMany of the original settler houses and other buildings have been preserved, and there remains much of the look and feel of an English village of the early 19th Century. The Pig and Whistle, at the heart of the village, is reputedly the oldest existent pub in the country. Built in 1831 by Thomas Hartley, a blacksmith who came from Nottinghamshire with the Settlers. Later accommodation was added and it became known as the Bathurst Inn. Legend has it that it was nicknamed “The Pig & Whistle” by the men at the nearby 43 Air School in WWII. While time has moved slowly in Bathurst, there is an increasing population of artists, academics (Rhodes University is only 40 km away), and retirees who have chosen to live in this tranquil environment.\n\nBathurst neighbours the Waters Meeting Nature Reserve, home to many species of animals, bird and plants. The reserve offers hiking trails, picnic spots and a remarkable viewpoint of the river and valley. The surrounding area hosts pineapple farms, game reserves and cattle and sheep ranches. It is a 10-minute drive to the beach town of Port Alfred and 45 minutes from the cultural mecca of Grahamstown.\n\nNature Reserve and Hiking – https://www.nightjartravel.com/hiking/waters-meeting-nature-reserve-trail\n\nPort Elizabeth offers visitors a choice of stunning beaches, interesting museums and memorials, award-winning wildlife destinations, cultural and historical nuggets, and some of the friendliest folk in the country.\n\nPort Elizabeth is a coastal hub in the Eastern Cape where locals proudly proclaim that everything lies within 15 minutes’ drive of the airport. It is one of the largest cities in South Africa, and lies 770km east of Cape Town, where it forms part of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro, which links the city with the inland industrial towns of Uitenhage and Despatch.\n\nAlgoa Bay, the coastal strip of Nelson Mandela Bay, incorporates a 40km stretch of beaches, with protected areas for swimming at Kings Beach, Hobie Beach, Humewood Beach, Pollock Beach and Denville Beach. Fishing, surfing, scuba diving, snorkelling and sailing are enjoyed at less- populated spots such as Wildside, Sardinia Bay, Blue Horizon Bay, Bluewater Bay, Beachview and Schoenmakerskop. Port Elizabeth is also home to Route 67 a collection of 67 art pieces celebrating the years Nelson Mandela devoted to public life. It is a mix of visual arts, urban design and heritage, showcasing old Victorian churches; terraced cottages on Donkin Street where massive silver pipes catch the famous winds of Port Elizabeth and make music; a lighthouse that once guided ships into Algoa Bay; and a large pyramid built by Donkin in memory of his wife. There is also a large metal cut-out of Nelson Mandela symbolically leading South Africans to vote in the country’s first democratic election.\n\nWhile in Port Elizabeth, you cannot pass the opportunity to visit the city’s multipurpose, multi-tiered Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, an impressive legacy of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe city is an outdoor-lovers’ paradise, so do not miss out on boat cruises; diving opportunities; or a trip to the lush forests of the Kragga Kamma Game Park, where buffalo, cheetah, giraffe, zebra, nyala, bontebok, lechwe and other animals roams freely. Also worth a visit is a 52m tower with 204 steps leading to the top, known as the Campanile Memorial, a monument that stands sentinel over the Port Elizabeth harbour. It was built in 1923 to honour the arrival of 1820 British Settlers. Another memento of Settler influence is No 7 Castle Hill, built in 1830. This is one of the oldest surviving Settler cottages in the city and encapsulates domestic life of 19th-century middle class, complete with cobbled courtyard and an operational well.\n\nOcean Cruise – http://www.raggycharters.co.za/\n\nWhale and Dolphin Watching – http://www.raggycharters.co.za/\n\nPenguin Patrol – http://www.raggycharters.co.za/\n\nDiving – http://www.expert-tours.com/\n\nSardine Run – http://www.expert-tours.com/ and http://www.raggycharters.co.za/\n\nHiking – http://www.nmbt.co.za/search/1/things_to_see_and_do/adventure_sports/hiking_trails4/port_elizabeth\n\nGolf – http://www.nmbt.co.za/search/1/things_to_see_and_do/adventure_sports/golf\n\nHorse Riding – http://www.heavenlystables.co.za/ and http://www.nmbt.co.za/listing/curanova_equestrian_center.html\n\nAfrican Drumming – https://www.facebook.com/africandrumbeat1/\n\nCultural Tours – http://www.nmbt.co.za/search/1/things_to_see_and_do/arts_culture/cultural_tours/port_elizabeth\n\nTheatre – http://www.nmbt.co.za/search/1/things_to_see_and_do/arts_culture/theatre\n\nArt Galleries – http://www.nmbt.co.za/search/1/things_to_see_and_do/arts_culture/art_galleries/port_elizabeth\n\nMuseums – http://www.nmbt.co.za/search/1/things_to_see_and_do/historical/museums\n\nThe town of Despatch is situated on rich clay soil and in the late 1800s was the site of a flourishing brick industry. Despatch’s name was derived from this brick industry history on the account that the bricks were ‘dispatched’ or more preciously ‘despatched’ away from a railway siding near Uitenhage. Much of the older buildings in Uitenhage and Port Elizabeth were built from these bricks. Most of these early bricks can be identified by the word ‘Despatch’ imprinted on the top and bottom of the brick. The only reminder of the town’s brick industry past is a chimney built in 1882 which formed part of the Brick Works. The Chimney is situated in a field on the outskirts of the town to the north next to the railway tracks. In recent years restoration work has brought it back to its former glory including supports which now give it the appearance of a space rocket. In 1903 the remains of a Stegosaurus were discovered near Despatch.\n\nMuseum – http://www.nmbt.co.za/listing/despatch_museum.html"
