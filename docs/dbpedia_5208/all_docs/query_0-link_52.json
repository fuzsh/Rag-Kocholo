        "text": "Firstly, Most business coaches and consultants have it backward. They expect you to pay a small fortune, so you can work with them and trust that somehow you’ll see a return on your money without a shred of proof. Frankly, I think that’s nuts because hiring a business coach is not the same as hiring an accountant or a lawyer.\n\nThe main difference is an accountant or a lawyer is an expense, where a business coach is an investment ... or should be if you hire the right one. The way I see it, when you hire a business coach to help you grow revenues and profits, you should know with 100% certainty that not only will you earn your money back, but that you’ll see a good return quickly… before you hire or commit to a business coaching. Do you think that's fair?\n\nHaving owned 40 businesses in the last 32 years, I understand that most small business can't afford a business coach. That's why we do NOT charge an upfront fee for our business coaching & Consulting service. Unlike any other business coach or consultant - we believe it is fair to remove all the risk for you, and only pay us for results. No empty promises and hyped - up promotion. You see, when you hire us, you’ll see cash returns far in excess of what you will pay... before you start paying.\n\nWith more than 600 business tools and strategies we can help you get measurable and consistent results... guaranteed. With just a few of my recommended strategies and improvements of just 1% to 10% in a few key areas of your business, you can double or triple sales and profits in 6 to 12 months. But improving a couple of things, especially your profit and cash flow, can quickly double even quadruple the value of your business.\n\nThink about it - you will NEVER pay anything out of your pocket for your coaching EVER - even if we coach you for years! Would you agree this offer is nearly impossible to turn down?\n\nSecondly, and most importantly. Before we start with any coaching, we do in-depth business analysis in 30 key critical areas of your business, to explore your business's true potential, so you can take full advantage of all the opportunities that exist in your business now. We provide you with an easy-to-read report that includes a business valuation, sales, profitability, cost, cash flow, and performance analysis to name only a few.\n\nThen we walk you through the report to help you understand your previous and future financial position and how it will be affected by implementing our recommended strategies. You also receive financial projections of up to 5 years anticipating your business's future sales, profit, and cash flow, demonstrating the ROI (Return on Investment) you will receive from coaching. That means you will know exactly how much money and by when you can expect to earn... before you start with our business coaching.\n\nFurthermore, it will provide you with financial proof that you will only pay us out of your New documented profits. That means you will make money, even before you investing anything in a business coach."
