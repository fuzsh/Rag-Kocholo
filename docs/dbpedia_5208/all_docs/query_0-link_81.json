        "text": "House: National Council of Provinces\n\nDate of Meeting: 25 May 2023\n\nSummary\n\nNo summary available.\n\nMinutes\n\nUNREVISED HANSARD\n\nNATIONAL COUNCIL OF PROVINCES\n\nTHURSDAY, 25 MAY 2023\n\nPROCEEDINGS OF VIRTUAL (OR HYBRID) NATIONAL COUNCIL OF PROVINCES\n\nWatch: Plenary\n\nThe Council met at 14:05.\n\nThe Deputy Chairperson took the Chair and requested members to observe a moment of silence for prayers or meditation.\n\nANNOUNCEMENT\n\nThe DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms S E Lucas): Yes, it is\n\nhere. It is done. Thank you very much.\n\nHon members, good morning. Before we start with anything, I just want to remind the hon members that today, the 25th of May, we usually observe Africa Day. And I thought I should remind the members of this House that we are part of the continent of Africa, and that today it is being celebrated under a very important theme and that is the one of “The\n\nAfrica Free Trade Agreement”. I’m sure the Ministers will elaborate a little bit on that. But I also think it’s important for us in the NCOP, since we are not going to have any debate or any observation immediately that we be reminded that we are observing the existence of the continent, the cradle of mankind. That is what is important.\n\nAnd before we continue, someone whispered into my ear that there is an outstanding ruling that should have been brought to this House. We will just allow the Table to find out how far. The ruling is, and as soon as we received it, we will make sure that we will deliver the ruling to the members.\n\nHon members, before we proceed, let me remind you of the rules relating to Virtual and Hybrid meetings and settings, in particular, Sub-Rules 21, 22 and 23 of Rule 103, which provides follows. The Hybrid sitting constitutes a sitting of the National Council of Provinces. Delegates in the Hybrid sitting enjoy the same powers and privileges that apply in a sitting of the National Council of Provinces.\n\nFor purposes of the quorum, all delegates who are locked onto the Virtual platforms shall be considered present. Delegates must switch on the videos if they want to speak, and they should ensure that the microphones on the electronic devices are muted and must always remain muted unless they are permitted to speak.\n\nAll delegates in the Chamber must connect to the Virtual platform as well as insert the cards to register on the Chamber system. Delegates who are physically in the Chamber must use the floor microphones. All delegates may participate in the discussions through the chat room. In addition, I would like to remind delegates that the interpretation facility should be active.\n\nPermanent delegates, special delegates, South African Local Government Association, SALGA, representatives, and members of the executive on the Virtual platform are requested to ensure that the interpretation facility on the electronic devices is properly activated to facilitate access to the service.\n\nPermanent delegates, special delegates, SALGA, representatives, and members of the executive in the Chamber should use the interpretation instruments on their desk to access the interpretation facilities.\n\nHon delegates, before we proceed, let me take the opportunity to welcome the Minister and the Deputy Minister of Small Business Development, the Minister and the Deputy Ministers of Trade Industry and Competition, the Minister and Deputy Minister of Tourism that will join us all permanent delegates, MECs, all special delegates as well as SALGA representatives into the House.\n\nHone delegates, I have been informed that there will be no Notices of Motion or Motions Without Notice. That said, we will now proceed to the First and Second Orders. The Policy Debate On Budget Vote No 36, Small Business Development and the Policy Debate on Budget Vote No 39, Trade Industry and Competition. Appropriation Bill. I will now call on the Minister of Small Business Development hon Stellar Ndabeni- Abrahams to open the debate.\n\nAPPROPRIATION BILL\n\n(Policy debate)\n\nDebate on Budget Vote No 36 - Small Business Development\n\nAnd\n\nDebate on Budget Vote No 39 – Trade, Industry and Competition:\n\nThe MINISTER OF SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT: Deputy Chair and members of the NCOP, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, director- generals, DGs, officials from our departments, board chairs, and CEOs of their respective agencies, distinguished guests, entrepreneurs, small and medium businesses, and of course the co-operatives of our country, ladies and gentlemen, today marks the 60th anniversary of the signature of the founding Charter of the African Union, which was found in Addis Ababa in 1963.\n\nOn this day, we celebrate the promise and potential of the continent and its people’s heritage and diversity. This year’s theme is “Accelerating the Africa Continental Trade Agreement Implementation”, having the population and youth dividend on its side. I think we all agree that the next few decades will belong to Africa.\n\nThere is no doubt that the continent is the centre future demand in consumption, and we have the entrepreneurial spirit together and change the process of consuming to being innovators.\n\nI would like to dedicate this Africa Day to the youth of our beautiful continent as Tony O. Elumelu, one of the continent’s greatest entrepreneurs remind us when he said and I quote:\n\nYoung entrepreneurs, and those they inspire are the lifeblood of Africa’s rise. Only entrepreneurship creates opportunities when none seemingly exists.\n\nHon Chair, the focus of this address is to provide an update on the work done by the department and our agencies since the last Budget Vote address, and of course to outline plans for this year, which is the last year of the Sixth Administration.\n\nHon member, in the last Budget Vote, we committed to provide business finance to start-up businesses and invest in existing businesses to give them the much needed support for their own growth. The Budget Vote we are tabling today, sets out the achievements from the previous year and highlights our ambition and allocated decisions for the period ahead.\n\nThe Budget Vote is aimed at leveraging partnerships and resources from across the small micro medium enterprise, SMME, and co-operatives ecosystem. This is the approach called for in our National Integrated Small Enterprise Development, NISED, Masterplan. Which is the third iteration SMME strategy for our country, and which was completed in the past financial year, as promised in last year’s Budget Vote address.\n\nRemembers, I’m sure we all appreciate that we are operating in an extremely difficult and volatile global context. The International Monetary Fund forecast that up to one third of economies around the world could enter recession this year, and inflationary pressures remain high. This has resulted in what many now referred to as a cost of living crisis. The small businesses are especially threatened by rising factor costs and reduced consumer demand. In our country, we also have load shedding, which makes life difficult for small businesses.\n\nDespite the current difficulties faced by SMMEs and co- operatives, we remain convinced that SMMEs will be the drivers of our economy’s growth, jobs, and transformation. Building a thriving SMME sector will give us a faster growing and more equal economy. This is aligned to the National Development Plan, which suggests that an upward of 85% of new jobs between 60% and 80% of new economic value will come from the small businesses. The Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan also prioritizes SMMEs as the core building block of a more inclusive economy as we seek to make sure that we live no one behind.\n\nOur approach as the portfolio to the development of the sector we are responsible for is five-fold. The first pillar is to cut the red tape and address regulatory impairments facing SMMEs and co-operatives. Having completed the regulatory impairments to SMMEs study, we will this year work with various sector departments to develop the regulatory reform action plan against which we can monitor the reduction of SMMEs red tape across government. We want to count on this House. to make sure that when we bring those amendments of the different legislations, this House will make sure that we fast track the process. We beg all members, irrespective of the political parties that they come from, to ensure that we create a conducive environment for the small businesses to thrive.\n\nAs things stand, we are reviewing the Businesses Act No 71 of 1991, as it was amended in 1993. We have completed the review process and we are about to introduce the Amendment Bill to\n\nParliament by the end of the financial year 2023-24. We wish the Act will be repealed and a fit-for-purpose legislation enacted. This will address many of the business licensing issues faced by the SMMEs.\n\nIsiXhosa:\n\nSihlalo, kwiindawo zonke esihamba kuzo oosomashishini abasakhasayo bayakhalaza ngenxa yemiThetho eHlonyelwayo eyenziwa ngurhulumente ebasusa kwiindawo abathengisa kuzo. Oomasipala abathile bakwenza oko kuba besithi basebenzisa umthetho. Yiloo nto sili sebe sibone kunyanzelekile ukuba siwutshintshe lo mthetho ukuze abantu baseMzantsi Afrika bakwazi ukushishina kwiindawo ezihambelana noshishino lwabo.\n\nEnglish:\n\nOur red tape at municipality level and the progress on it, we have SALGA, who will pronounce on interventions post their national members’ assembly in August. This year, we will assist 30 municipalities to develop red tape reduction action plans building on the 20 that we have supported this past year. We will also proceed on the establishment of the Ombudsman office, which was held back to enable the processes of the of merger of Small Enterprise Development Agency, SEDA,\n\nSmall Enterprise Finance Agency, SEFA and the Co-operative Banks Development Agency, CBDA, to progress as it required an amendment to the same Bill, the National Small Enterprise Act.\n\nThis year, we will also move to establish the Small Business Advisory Body as envisage International Small Enterprise Act of 1996 as amended.\n\nThe second pillar of our work is to enable access to markets. South Africa remains a very concentrated economy by international standards, a legacy of our apartheid past.\n\nThrough its market linkage programme, we will link 250 products manufactured by SMMEs and Co-operatives to domestic markets this financial year.\n\nWe pledge all of you to please buy products that are produced in South Africa. Here is the collaborative partnership with Proudly SA, which includes the establishment of an e-commerce platform, managed and run by Proudly SA. Through SEDA, we are implementing our comprehensive small business exporter development programme designed to build export readiness and fund emerging exporters to participate in trade shows in exhibitions, whether virtual or physical. And business to\n\nbusiness engagements outside of South Africa with a special focus on African markets and women entrepreneurs through the programme we call SheTrade SA. We are serious about unlocking the opportunities of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area. As a result, we are setting aside R25 million for this support.\n\nSouth Africa will host the Global Entrepreneurship Network, Africa Plus, which will bring leaders and entrepreneurs from across the continent to see how we can create a more effective continental SMME and start-up ecosystem. This is key to making the Africa Continental Free Trade Area work and to build that inclusive economy that we are talking about.\n\nThe other significant market access support you provide as the portfolio is in the area of enterprise supplier development.\n\nBoth our agencies, SEDA and SEFA are collaborating on our Enterprise and Supplier Development, ESD work. For example, SEDA is partnering with South African Pulp and Paper Industries Limited, SAPPI, and South African Forestry Company SOC Limited, SAFCOL, Lafarge in the Northwest, Pick ‘n Pay in the Western Cape, Gold One Mine in the East Rand, SIOC-CDT,\n\nthe Northern Cape and Retail Motor Industry, RMI, in a number of provinces to mention a few.\n\nSEFA has supported 51 SMMEs to gain access to corporate value chain markets. These were supported with the R201 million revolving credit facility to provide goods and services to Corporates, such as Tiger Brands, United Exports, Grain SA, a Cotton SA, Rainbow Chicken Limited, and Mondi amongst others.\n\nThe third pillar of our strategy on the members is access to finance. For the financial year ending on 31 March 2023, SEFA through its development, finance interventions and programmes financed 74 762 SMMEs and co-operatives and dispersed R2,4 billion to these enterprises. Through this disbursement SEFA was able to reach 74 486 black-owned SMMEs to the value of R2,1 billion, 15 535 youth-owned businesses to the value of R564 million, 72 651 women-owned businesses to the value of R928 million, 2 953 township-based businesses to the value of\n\n541 million, 66 302 rural-based businesses, to the value of R952 million. Collectively, these fund interventions have created 32 665 new jobs and sustained 71 882 existing jobs.\n\nSEFA, through this Budget Vote will seek to approve loan finance, the value of two R2,5 billion and disbursed just over R2,2 billion to 93 000 small businesses and co-operatives.\n\nOf this planned disbursements across the direct lending, wholesale lending in formal and microfinance and KCG Instrumentation, 13% will go to the Eastern Cape, 6% to the Free State, 24% to Gauteng, 15% to KwaZulu-Natal, 7% to Limpopo, 9% to Mpumalanga and 5% to the Northern Cape. Whilst we give 6% to the Northwest and 15% to the Western Cape. This is based on the demand of the SMMEs that have made applications for access of the funds that we are talking about.\n\nOf course, hon members, this is an improvement from last year. With more resources now going to poorer and less developed provinces. We will continue with this to ensure more equitable economic activity across our beautiful country. We will definitely leave no one behind.\n\nThe department has also finalized the SMMEs and Co-Operative Funding Policy, which will accelerate addressing the credit\n\ngap through expanded access to finance and early stage investment.\n\nEnabling youth entrepreneurship is a priority for our department. For this financial year, R122 million has been allocated to the Youth Talent Fund. The Township and Rural Entrepreneurship Programme, TREP, is aimed at supporting local productive business ventures in townships and rural areas.\n\nFor the previous year, we set a target of supporting 20 000 enterprises and surpassed this target, providing financial and or non-financial support to 23 344 enterprises located in townships and rural areas. This year we have increased the target to 30 000 enterprises. And have allocated R909 million for the programme that we are talking about.\n\nThe provincial breakdown of the 30 000 enterprises targeted by TREP in 2023-24 is as follows: The Eastern Cape will receive support for 3 916 enterprises, Free State will receive support of 1 760, Gauteng 6 243, KwaZulu-Natal 5 961, Limpopo 3 372,\n\nMpumalanga 2 552, Northern Cape 951, Northwest 2 116 and Western Cape 3 129 enterprises. These are clearly rated by\n\ndistrict which will allow effective alignment with the District Development Model, DDM, planning and processes.\n\nOf this R909 million TREP allocation, R500 million goes to SEDA and it will be broken as follows: Two hundred and fifty million rand to equipment targeting SMMEs with a turnover less than R3 million, R100 million for product markets, which will be piloted in 70 district municipalities, R70 million to energy support for product markets, R50 million for general dealer support and additional R30 million for spaza shop support.\n\nSEFA’s allocation to TREP is R409 million. We take R200 million for township and rural businesses for power purchase product, 209 normal TREP lending. In addition, SEFA will allocate R220 million for other businesses for the power purchase product because load shedding is really hitting hard on the small businesses. One hundred million rand is set aside in SEFA for automotive aftermarket support. Businesses can get up to R1 millions of which R100 000 is a grant and R32 million is set aside for spaza shop support and will be implemented through SEFA and SEDA.\n\nWe have travelled the country. Most of our people are complaining about the influx of the foreigners in the spaza shop area, and we are trying to reclaim the business back to South Africans.\n\nThe other financial support instruments we have as the portfolio include the Informal and Microenterprise Development Programme, which is a 100% grant offered to informal and microenterprises from the minimum grant of R500 up to R15,000 in order to assist them to be competitive and sustainable. To this programme, we have allocated R20 million, and of course, we intend to support 1 333 informal businesses this financial year.\n\nChairperson, we are aware of the challenges that our co- operatives are facing. As a result, through our co-operatives Development Support Programme, we have set aside R73 million to assist them with assets. This programme will be rolled in various provinces as follows: Eastern Cape 13%, Free State 12%, Gauteng 10%, KwaZulu-Natal 12%, Limpopo 14%, Mpumalanga\n\n9%, Northern Cape 8%, Northwest 12% and Western Cape 10%. We are deliberating empowering our communities to create opportunities for self-sufficiency through co-operatives.\n\nThe fourth pillar is access to business development services. Our core here is to make sure that we provide space in incubation and entrepreneurship support. For this administration, we had set a target of 100 incubators, and as we speak, we have 110 incubators nationally that align to government’s priority sectors. These 110 incubators are broken into different sectors of the economy. For the previous financial year, a total of 25 000 and 2 507 SMMEs were supported via the incubation programme, and 1 607 jobs were created while 6 995 jobs were sustained. A total of R148 million has been put aside for incubation for this financial year. Of this, a total R44 million has been put aside to implement the approved 11 incubators in rural and township areas. In total, we have allocated R702 million to enterprise development and the SEDA Technology Programme. The ANC-led government is committed to building a more equal economy.\n\nWe also have the shared infrastructure facility, which is aimed at improving market infrastructure and SMME precincts and hubs to support local SMME trading and production. Just like we walk into malls of the bigger corporates, we also want you to work into the markets that are providing services through small businesses.\n\nWe have provided support to the Chris Hani Development Centre, we have provided support to King Dalindyebo Ntozonke Market in the Eastern Cape, Letsatsi Retail Space in the Free State, Mahikeng Trade Market project in Northwest, Kokosi container structures precinct, and the Spartan Industrial Hub in Gauteng, the Manguzi Precinct Market stores and the Kwamashu train station product market in KwaZulu-Natal, the cultivate trading manufacturing, and agricultural facility, Limpopo, and the informal sector, SMME villages in the Northern Cape are what we have supported in the previous financial year.\n\nThe last pillar is to build our capacity and capabilities to deliver in all of this. We have finalized our organogram. We are in the process of filling in the vacancies. We are finalizing the process towards the Business Development Plan that goes to the merger of the three agencies that I spoke about in order to strengthen the DDM plans. With have appointed district development champions in order to enhance the work that we do at a district level. We are rolling out our digital SMME license application systems, including systems integration and interability.\n\nThis year, we are also implementing key partnerships with the Department of Higher Education. Through which SEDA, together with the National Skills Fund, will train 1 500 graduates and support 12 500 spaza shops and general dealers with business development support training. With the wholesale and retail, SETA 3 000 spaza shops and general dealers will be receiving a stock of up to 6 000 rental and training on stock management.\n\nWith Manufacturing, Engineering and Related Services Sector Education and Training Authority, MerSETA, we are training 600 employees of SMMEs in the automotive industry to obtain trade certificates for a period of two years. In addition, 300 SMMEs within the automotive sector will receive business deployment support training.\n\nWith the South African Breweries that is going to invest an average of R100 million a year in small business development in our country, including in Township Economic Revitalization Programme. With Tiger Brands on supporting SMMEs in the agriculture and food distribution value chain with Johannesburg Stock Exchange, JSE, to develop a pipeline of small businesses for the JSE’s Enterprise Acceleration Programme.\n\nChairperson, we are committed in ensuring that the designated groups participate in the economic growth of our country. We have developed our gender, youth, and disability strategy. One of the objectives is to provide entry points for increased inclusion of women, youth, and persons with disabilities into all SMME development and financing initiatives to benefit equitably from these initiatives. We have funds that support these designated groups.\n\nFor our Disabled Entrepreneurs, SEFA administers Amavulandlela Fund, which is administered ... [Interjections.] ... We are continuing with the Youth Challenge Fund. As I indicated, we thank Parliament, hon members, the department and the counterparts for the support that they have provided to us.\n\nHon Chair, as you agreed that, I must conclude, I now want to make sure that I plead with everyone here that despite the challenges we face as a country, the people should know that the ANC remain the leading force of change in the country and carries the hopes and aspirations of our people. I have no doubt whatsoever that we will succeed.\n\nMa-Afrika, let us all unite and toil together to give the best we have to Afrika, the Cradle of Humankind and found of culture, our pride and hope at break of dawn. Mayibuye!\n\nThe DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms S E Lucas): I-Afrika.\n\nThank you, Nkosazana.\n\nThe MINISTER OF TRADE, INDUSTRY & COMPETITION: Hon Deputy\n\nChairperson, Minister Ndabeni Abrahams, Deputy Minister Majola and Deputy Minister Gina, MECs, hon members of the NCOP, and fellow South Africans, today, as our presiding officer has said, is Africa Day. It is about celebrating our continent, this continent that is the birthplace of humankind, but also a continent that has been through hundreds of years of colonialism, and is now addressing the legacy of that past, a continent of young people, energetic, connected, increasingly urbanized and keen to change our storyline. As we observe Africa Day, we must continue to show commitment to the integration of our continent and the development of value chains, trade, and investment across Africa.\n\nHon members, despite extraordinary headwinds and challenges, we have made considerable progress with pursuing the goals of\n\ngrowth and transformation, and we have laid substantial foundations for economic recovery based on increased investment, industrialization, localization, and trade. We promised, last year, in this House to focus on industrial development in at least 25 districts across the country. We have met and indeed exceeded that target. We now at least have one project that we finance or that we partner in in 49 of the\n\n52 districts. I want to highlight a few of those projects.\n\nLast week, as part of the presidential imbizo, I visited the Cape Winelands District. This is the heart of South Africa’s industry for grapes, apricots, pears, cherries, apples, citrus fruits, and many fruits. A place of mountains, valleys and rivers with a beauty that takes your breath away. A place whereabout one million citizens live and over 300 000 are working. Within just this one district, we identified more than 50 actions, projects and partnerships by the Department of Trade Industry and Competition, DTIC, group to contribute to jobs, innovation, or opportunities for small businesses, and to exports.\n\nIt is in this district that the DTIC action saved thousands of jobs Worcester Rainbow Chicken facility when floods of poultry imports threatened to destroy those jobs, and we put tariffs\n\nin place as part of the Poultry Master Plan. It is in this district in Ashton, where one factory alone employs more than\n\n4 000 workers at the height of the season that produces\n\n60 million cans of fruit a year. It was saved from closure last year, following engagements between the DTIC and the company, as well as partnerships from workers and local farmers.\n\nIt is in the same district where two companies: Heineken, when it bought a controlling stake in Distell, and Shoprite/Checkers agreed to competition settlements with the DTIC that secured workers’ shares in firms that they work for, resulting in more than 3 000 workers benefitting in that district municipality alone.\n\nThe DTIC group also provides financial support to establish businesses and to new black industrialists in the areas. This Saturday, the Stormers take on the Monsters, an Irish team in the finals of the United Rugby Championships. A few days ago, Janette Hilton-Gericke, the owner of the clothing factory and Rosanne Heins sewing machines gave President Ramaphosa a stormers jersey made with the hands of South African workers. It is at the same factory that we make the Bafana Bafana\n\njerseys, the Mamelodi Sundowns jerseys, and the South African Netball supporters’ jerseys. It is in the same district that government provide support to black industrialists and to farmers such as Into Energy, who are into rooftop solar and water treatment projects, or Worcester farmer in cherries and almonds, the reopening of the old Hextex textile factory by Tina Eboka, and the funding of the development of an App by Njabulo Khulu that allow small business to list services, schedule appointments and manage time whilst they do their business.\n\nOn the same trip, we visited a factory in Stellenbosch that makes electric three-wheel delivery vehicle led by Neil du Preez of Mellowvans and a team of innovators supported by the Industrial Development Corporation, IDC, and the DTIC.\n\nI have raised examples from this one district, and a small number of examples from a much wider group. Our work is reaching many different parts of the country. In the available time, I want to look at a few of the areas of success and where we have been able to get traction in the economy. Let me take the example of KwaZulu-Natal, the DTIC provided an incentive that supported the expansion of the Sappi Saiccor\n\ndissolving pulp mill that was officially opened by the President in KwaZulu-Natal. It creates jobs in forestry, jobs in the factory, it gets South Africa export earnings.\n\nWe also opened the Hesto Harnesses factory that employs 4 000 workers in Kwadukuza in KwaZulu-Natal, making wire harnesses. Defy completed its wide goods manufacturing investment facility in Ezakheni valid at R317 million. This means jobs and this means investment. In Mpumalanga, I opened a new facility in the Highveld Steel complex manufacturing railway lines for the South African market and for export to other African markets. One of the poultry farms that I told this august House last year, has now been able to open for production. In the Eastern Cape, that is the home of the auto industry of South Africa, and hon Rayi would be pleased to know that Isuzu launched its new D-Max bakkie, produced by the ands of the workers of Eastern Cape using the facilities of the Auto Master Plan. We supported new component production for the Mercedes C-Class vehicle. In North West, we secured the export of grapefruits through working with a large global importer. The IDC funded the plant to process crude nickel sulphate into pure battery grade material that can be used for energy storage. Last year, in Gauteng, we promised that 11\n\nautomotive component plants should be completed in the Tshwane Special Economic Zone, SEZ, in support of Ford’s major new investment. Ten factories were opened, employing more workers than projected, just over 2 500 in all. Just a few years ago it was open veld. Today, these factories are harming, producing parts, and creating jobs for South Africa. In the Northern Cape, construction is underway for a large energy project by a Saudi investor, ACWA Power, announced at the South African investment conference. We supported the efforts of the Lulu Group to import raisins from the province to the Middle East markets. If you haven’t had the grapes, and the raisins, please do so, very tasty. In Limpopo, talking of fruits, we worked with a large retailer to be able to source avocado, lemons, and oranges from the province. We backed several mining and other projects. In the Free State, the IDC funded a poultry farm. In May last year, Hangda Trading opened its production in Thabanchu. The factory manufactures bullets, steel angle irons, steel tubes, as well as rebar. It employs\n\n300 people. A helium project did its first production in Free State, and a poultry farm has now opened.\n\nI gave many examples of the Western Cape, so, let me just conclude with one of it. Sigma opened its call centers,\n\nemploying workers from Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha in the Western Cape. There are moving human stories behind the blend announcements of opening. Stories like that of Nokwazi Mbele, a young vibrant program manager at a factory in Kwadukuza that makes wire harnesses for cars, or a nuclear engineer, Dr Ramatsemela Masango who manufactures electrical inverters, or Sanele Luthuli, a production analyst producing pulp that will go on to be used for making viscose and pharmaceuticals, or Mike Nkuna and Rashid Gutta, who both run their own furniture manufacturing businesses and are now supported with the Furniture Master Plan. Cornelius Grevale works with the factory that make bottles, and the drinking glass used by the President during Sona meeting, or disabled workers, Kyle Turner and Thato Mbhele who works at a factory that makes plugs, that was previously imported, and now we are supporting that company to get orders from more retailers, or trainees, Nwabisa Bavuma and Garrison Cotzee who work at a company that makes underwater LED lights and cameras that are used for the cables that connect South Africa with the rest of the world.\n\nIt is not just these human stories; it is also how we are transforming our economy structurally. We committed last year to hold a conference of black exporters. We met that commitment. We held it together with a wider focus on black\n\nindustrialists that attracted more than a thousand participants and showed the progress that we made. Black-owned firms are now involved in space technology, in food, in engineering, in the making of car components, in poultry, in sugar production, in clothing, in skin care, and in pharmaceuticals.\n\nWe promised to launch the Japan-South Africa Business Forum, and the Saudi Arabia-South Africa Business Council. We made that promise last year here. Both bodies were launched. We also held business forums with Ivory Coast, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Spain, and the United Kingdom. We visited a supermarket in Saudi Arabia that’s now importing R340 million worth of products to the chains across the Middle East markets. We promised that 55 deals will be finalized under the DTIC-J.P. Morgan small business partnership. I know that Minister Ndabeni Abrahams would be very happy to hear that they exceeded the target, and 70 enterprises were supported.\n\nWe promised the six black-owned poultry farms will be opened, supported by the IDC. Five of the six have already opened and sold their first chickens, and one is under construction, and they include several different provinces. We promised that the DTIC supported the film The Women King telling the story of a\n\nfemale warrior army in Dahomey, in the West Africa, which was co-funded by the IDC, will be released – telling our story as Africans. It premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, last year. It is available on Netflix globally. We promised 200 black women and youth business, and persons with disability will be assisted with export training and support. We exceeded this target. Seven hundred individuals were trained in eight provinces. We committed to meeting the target of R1,2 trillion investment commitments over a five-year period. The President announced at the conference held in April, this year, that we exceeded that target, securing pledges of just over R1,5 trillion in that period.\n\nOn Africa Day, I am pleased to say that we met our target for the work on the Africa Continental Free Trade Area, AfCFTA, and our promise that an offer will be developed for the Southern African Customs Union, SACU. The DTIC is now taking a roadshow to all provinces to highlight the details of the AfCFTA, what it means for firms, and what it means for local businesses.\n\nSugar is important to KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga. We made progress with the Sugar Master Plan when the three-year period contract expired. The Health Protection Levy, and the postponement of the increase was agreed for a further two years. WE are now working on the problems that Tongaat Hulett is undergoing because of fraud by company insiders.\n\nI want to turn to the current financial year. Spatial development and fairness are important to delegates of the NCOP. To address spatial inequities, we will take several steps: firstly, we are working with all the agencies of the DTIC group to decentralize opportunities across more provinces. We are targeting that up to R15 billion in industrial incentives should be approved outside the five main metros. In June, we will be publishing for public comments.\n\nOut intention to establish a Special Economic Zone in Namaqua, in the Northern Cape, which will open beneficiation opportunities in an area with large deposits of zinc and which is in the proximity of the new green hydrogen hub of Boegoebaai. This is an important step to find ways to beneficiate more of our minerals. In a new step for the department, we will undertake outreach visits or programmes in\n\n52 district municipalities and metros. One visit to each\n\ndistrict in every province in South Africa where possible working in partnership with other departments, including bringing to local communities the funding agencies, the ability to register a company, to register for tax and business support. Yesterday, I provided the National Assembly with the number of key targets that we will seek to meet in the year ahead. They include R400 billion in new investment commitments, R40 billion in additional local output,\n\nR800 billion in manufactured exports to the rest of the world. One million workers to be covered by the DTIC-linked programmes or measures and partnerships, and 20 000 more workers with shares in the companies they work for. We will also target to export R330 billion to other African countries over this financial year. Subject to the approval of the SACU offer, we plan to start trading under the Africa Continental Free Trade Area, building on the foundations we have laid last year.\n\nHon members, whilst our efforts have focused on supporting and protecting existing jobs, given the size of the unemployment challenge, our industrial policy a producing is based on identifying new sectors with potential to growth. They include the medical value chain, like medical devices, vaccines,\n\ncannabis use for medical purposes and other products. In the green value chain, solar and wind energy components, battery manufacturing and electric vehicles. In the digital value chain, artificial intelligence, AI, applications, 3D-printing, high end call centres and attracting digital migrants. In the food value chain, covering fruits, meat, nuts, oils, and processed products.\n\nEnergy continues to be the foundation of industrialization, and I have announced eight major actions that the DTIC will take to contribute, and support partnered departments in addressing the energy crisis.\n\nWe are also shifting the focus of our black economic empowerment, BEE, programme. Instead of aiming to get 5% or 10% in an existing company, we are actively trying to increase the number of firms in the economy, backing black industrialist firms, but also want to widen empowerment. We are now promoting a greater level of worker-ownership in the economy. Just last year alone, more than 100 000 additional workers were able to obtain shares in the companies they work for, giving them additional dividends, and several cases giving them a seat on the board of the company.\n\nOver the next few months, we will be working actively. I can in the available time just highlight a few areas, Deputy Chairperson. In June, Procter and Gamble will launch their production facility for Ariel laundry liquid in Kempton Park. VIA Aluminium will launch a secondary smelter producing aluminium alloys. It’s located in Tembisa. In July, the DTIC Group will formally launch the energy resilience scheme worth R1,3 billion for small and medium-enterprises, and a one-stop shop on energy. Future Life will start producing cereal in Dube TradePort. The DTIC will host the BRICKS Trade Ministers’ meeting, and the construction of the Orion Engineered Carbons black oil tank project will be completed, hon Rayi. We hope to complete a site handover of bricks manufacturing that’s owned by two young black females in Mokopane in that month. In August, Tetra Pak will complete a manufacturing facility in KwaZulu-Natal. The IDC backed black-owned firm will begin planting almonds and cherries in the Boland. In September, Vhadinda Utilities will have completed implementation of the investment in manufacturing electrical hardware for the telecoms industry. A black-owned citrus farm will have commenced planting in KwaZulu-Natal, with the IDC support.\n\nIn October, we hope to have held the workers conference celebrating ownership by workers of shares in their companies. And Future Life will complete construction of their cereal production facility. The update of the green hydrogen strategy would have been done. In November, Wilmar will launch the edible oil refinery in Richards Bay, which will boost localization content of cooking oil. So, when we cook, we can use more locally refined cooking oil.\n\nAs I conclude, hon Chair, I have spoken of many actions in the economy of work we are doing with cars, food, pharmaceuticals, jobs that have been created, and of investment that is being mobilised. But the DTIC work is also about building the South African story, our narrative of telling a wider story both now and our history.\n\nOne film series supported by the DTIC Shaka iLembe is due to be released shortly. It sets out the story of an extraordinary man, and an early nation-builder. I look forward to having feedback from members of the NCOP on how well we are telling our story. I thank you, Deputy Chairperson for this opportunity to set out the work of the department. We have taken just a small sample to illustrate the depth of work, and\n\nhow working together with business, with workers, provinces and with local government, we can, in fact, grow the economy, and grow it in an inclusive manner. I thank you.\n\nMr M I RAYI: Hon Deputy Chairperson, greetings to you and to the Ministers, the Deputy Ministers, MECs, permanent and special delegates, as well as director-general of the two departments and the staff – Happy Africa Day! The South African economic history has been characterised by ruling elites that controlled the country’s mineral wealth, particularly that of diamonds, gold, iron ore and platinum. From the 1890s through to the 1990s, this wealth was shared between the white English and Afrikaner capital that has ruled the economic landscape for most of South Africa’s modern economic history.\n\nThe Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, ERRP’s, goal of creating a new economy that differs from that which existed at the time of the “crisis before the crisis,” requires extensive structural transformation. Structural transformation, as we understand it, has several dimensions. First, it means breaking the chains of our colonially defined place in the imperialist division of labour as producer and exporter of\n\nprimary products, by moving to higher value-added production. This must involve industrialising and reindustrialising in such a way that it supports a broad-based rise in incomes through the creation of higher income and higher quality livelihoods, as well as greater inclusivity. This does not mean just growing the manufacturing sector in a narrow sense, though it includes this. It would also include promoting mineral beneficiation, adding more value to mineral commodities rather than exporting them as dirt out of the ground as well as smart agriculture aiming, inter alia, at capturing more of value chains of exported product. History teaches us that almost all but a few countries that have broken out of underdevelopment and poverty have done so by undergoing such structural transformation. History also teaches us that all those who have followed this path, without exception, have implemented state-led, high impact industries. Industrial policy has therefore a central pillar of structural transformation.\n\nSome of the structural constraints that continue to reproduce our challenges include, amongst others, the lack of coherence between our skills development policy and industrial policy - which means that firms tend to privatise the necessary\n\ntraining that merits public provision, which implies a bias against smaller firms. According to the Competition Commission’s latest report on “Measuring concentration and participation in the South African economy,” the number of large firms has grown by an average of 3%, while the number of small, medium and micro-sized enterprises, SMMEs, declined by an average of 9% from 2012 to 2016. This indicates that there is a poor survival rate for SMMEs in our economy. Small, medium and micro-sized enterprises are key creators of jobs and without their increased participation we may not be able to effectively liberate our people from the clutches of poverty and joblessness.\n\nThe imperative for addressing high levels of concentration and low levels of participation in the economy extends beyond the Competition Commission to all areas of government and civil society. Regulatory frameworks, licensing processes and procurement across government directly impact the spread of ownership and opportunities for effective participation in the economy, which will ultimately impact concentration. Some proactive interventions are achievable through the Competition Commission’s ability to undertake market inquiries.\n\nIndustrial policy refers to efforts by the state to shape the sectoral allocation of the economy and promote structural transformation, by targeting specific industries, firms or economic activities. These include both firm-focused measures and general efforts to improve economic performance.\n\nThe ANC-led government through the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition has taken a different, clear and bold approach on industrial policy and structural transformation in the current annual performance plans, APP, and placed at the centre structural transformation through industrialisation.\n\nThis will be a success if the African Continental Free Trade Area can be steered towards development integration and the emergence of new regional value chains, more opportunities for deeper industrialisation will be created not just in South Africa but across the continent. This we believe should involve greater inclusivity. We believe that we are on the path to develop an economic framework to support a sustained economic development necessary to catapult the majority of South Africans into improved livelihoods and be able to realise their full human potential. Conventional approaches have not been able to do this over the past three decades nor have they transformed the deeply unequal and highly\n\ncorporatised economy inherited from the colonial and apartheid eras.\n\nWith regard to the Special Economic Zones, SEZs, amongst other strategic interventions is a Special Economic Zones Programme, which specifically includes targeted economic activities, supported through special arrangements which include laws, regulations, incentives and systems that are different from those that apply in the rest of the country. Special Economic Zones seek to create a sustainable environment for foreign and domestic direct investment, build sector-based industries, which will help the South African economy to develop its strategic industrial capabilities. The Special Economic Zone Programme serves as a key policy programme underpinning spatially integrated industrial development, particularly in the context of unlocking or optimising South Africa’s comparative and competitive advantages. The Special Economic Zones Programme has now entered a full implementation phase with designated SEZs continuing to show a positive progress in terms of the number of investors operating in the zones.\n\nThe number of designated Special Economic Zones in South Africa has now reached 10, covering seven provinces. These\n\nSEZ’s are real and practical drive at industrialising our economy. For example, in Gauteng, 10 newly built factories opened in the new Tshwane Automotive Special Economic Zone last year, producing parts for the new Ford Ranger bakkie, the hon Minister was referring to. A total of 3 200 additional manufacturing jobs were created in Ford and its suppliers. The new vehicles that the Minister referred to in the Eastern Cape, which is the Isuzu G-Max began rolling off the production line in Gqeberha not so long ago. In KwaZulu-Natal, government supported Toyota to get its plant back to production after the devastating 2022 April floods. The spin- offs of this are jobs and sustained economic growth, we may not see the impact immediately but the seeds are being sown for economic development.\n\nOn state capability, what will further strengthen our resolve to build our economy is state capability and our efforts at industrialisation will only be successful if we have a capable state that is able to deliver on its developmental imperatives. Building a capable state is one of the key pillars of the National Developmental Plan. Capable and decisive state is characterised by a strong planning and co- ordination in the implementation of government programmes,\n\nbreaking free from unnecessary red tapes and strong on turnaround times in achieving timelines without fail. In this regard, the District Development Model mechanism in government as an instrument of breaking silos in government and enforce planning at all three levels of government is beginning to show signs of co-ordination in our reindustrialisation policy implementation with provinces and district municipalities.\n\nWe are living in uncertain times, with risks and opportunities, global development ranging from inflation, high interest rates, inequality and poverty, compounded with the cost of living both Global North and Global South, caused suffering and hunger for the poor and squeezing the middle class and the social progress of the working people remain stagnant.\n\nSouth Africa, in terms of trade is much dependent to the major economies such as China, Germany, EU, UK and USA. Trade opportunities, both in the African continent and global village should be used strategically to support the economy and further access global talent to boost skill base and access new markets. We have said in may platforms that both globally and in South Africa, that the Russian-Ukraine War\n\nmust end, and lasting peaceful solution must be found. Globalisation must be about the wellbeing of all citizens of the globe.\n\nThe Department of Trade, Industry and Competition presents its budget and spending plans under uncertain period, as I have just highlighted. Domestically we have our own challenges much more pronounced in the electricity industry. We also know by now that the electricity crisis is hurting individuals, households, markets and society in general. In the 2023 Budget Review and in the state of the nation address, government has announced both plans to tackle the crisis, given the time, painful as it is. We shall overcome the electricity nightmare.\n\nGovernment has taken over R254 billion of Eskom’s debt to ease the pressure on the company’s balance sheet. This should allow Eskom to invest in transmission and distribution I infrastructure. Further, the entity would be able to scale up maintenance essential to improving the availability of electricity.\n\nIn the 2023 budget, government introduced tax incentives measures to support the roll-out of rooftop solar for\n\nhouseholds to encourage electricity generation and expand the renewable energy tax incentive for business. Many businesses, big and small will benefit from these incentives. As Parliament, we need to oversee that indeed businesses and households across the country fully benefit from the government’s introduced measures. The government measures will go a long way to attract private investment in expanding electricity generation and there tackling electricity crisis.\n\nOver the medium term, the department has undertaken commitment to its regulatory processes to attract private sector investment in electricity generation and huge completion laws to broaden participation of SMMEs in the electricity industry and also introducing energy resilience scheme to assist firms to mitigate the impact of load shedding, and further to introduce measures to protect consumers and energy users.\n\nThe introduction of renewable energy will further deepen government action to ensure that the industrialisation process respond to aspirations and make the economy future fit proof. Government has identified opportunities in the transition to a greener economy. The department, in collaboration with other sister departments, develop finance institutions, research and\n\nacademic institutions and working to unlock opportunities in green hydrogen economy, hybrid electric vehicle, renewable energy generation and battery storage technologies.\n\nThe main focus of government as articulated in the state of the nation address is to reset the economy and to make sure that the economy moves beyond economic ... [Inaudible.] ... but becomes more sustainable, jobs also created as we move the economy forward. Thank you very much.\n\nAfrikaans:\n\nMnr J J LONDT: Agb Ondervoorsitter, dit is lekker om u in die Stoel te hê.\n\nEnglish:\n\nHon Ministers, hon members, fellow South Africans but also fellow Africans, it is indeed a day where we celebrate Africa. We have so much to be proud of on this beautiful continent and\n\n... the beautiful people we have along its length and breadth, and we must never shy away from celebrating what’s good and beautiful about this continent. We must also never hesitate to call out what is often wrong and, unfortunately, on our continent quite often what’s wrong are the elected\n\ngovernments. In that sense, we are definitely not unique on the African continent.\n\nHon Minister, when the Department of Small Business Development was started, one of the key targets was that unemployment must be reduced to 6%, not to reduce it by 6%. It’s to 6%. However, since the establishment of your department, we have regressed year in and year out. We are now sitting with unemployment at a staggering 32,9%. There are a myriad of reasons that you can put forward as to why we are regressing. You will put forward COVID and you will put forward the global recession. However, this affected the entire world, yet we are still going on the wrong trajectory when many other economies like ours have gone on a different trajectory. We are in fact potentially in one of the fastest growing markets — Africa, but we are not tapping into that.\n\nOur youth unemployment figure is now sitting at a staggering 46,5%. How does this government say that we are truly looking at the future because quite often the speeches only look to the past and look there for excuses instead of truly finding workable policies and solutions? Hon Ndabeni-Abrahams, you are one of the younger Ministers, so you are the one who is going to take the longest criticism. When some of your colleagues\n\nhave retired, you will still be criticised for sitting in a Cabinet that is not focussed on a youth enabling economy.\n\nThe question should then be, why is it that this department is failing so miserably in addressing the unemployment crisis?\n\nHon Rayi touched on it when he said that we are actually regressing. Our small, medium and micro enterprises, SMME, market is contracting. For the past few financial years, this department has regularly missed its own performance targets. When will you start turning that trend around? How can you start contributing to the solution, if in-house you cannot even sort out what is going on there?\n\nSmall business owners are ambitious individuals who start with small enterprises but dream of reaching the top. Occasionally, we come across success stories of these small start-ups that become massive, employing thousands of people and inspiring others to start their own businesses.\n\nRecently, I spoke to a small business owner who has spent his entire life painstakingly building up his small business and who over the years has employed hundreds of people who then in turn can look after their families. The truly remarkable thing\n\nabout this business owner is that he is achieving this in spite of three massive hurdles. The first hurdle is that he is stationed in an ANC-run municipality, the second hurdle is that he is stationed in an ANC-run province and the third hurdle is that he is stationed in an ANC-run country. These business owners are the true heroes that are trying to prop up an economy that is struggling because of failed policies implemented by the ANC.\n\nThese business owners are jealous of those businesses stationed in the Western Cape under DA-run municipalities, and that only have to deal with a national government that is unable to cut red tape, that is unable to provide a safe environment through an efficient SA Police Service, the SAPS, that is unable to use the tax money that they diligently pay year in and year out and trust that that money won’t be stolen and that that money will in fact go to where it is intended to build the infrastructure that is needed to grow this economy.\n\nThat is only if we are looking at the internally focussed SMMEs that rely primarily on the Southern African markets. Then we have the thousands of SMMEs that rely on the broader international market; a market that this government takes for\n\ngranted with your stance on international events such as the Ukraine. The African Growth and Opportunity Act, Agoa, is up for renewal in 2025. I do not think we can underestimate and understate the importance of that, not just to South Africa but to the broader Africa. Yet, for some bizarre reason we are willing to risk billions in trade and thousands of job opportunities. Hon Ministers, it should be that we look after the most vulnerable in our own country first, instead of looking after our relationship with Russia.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa emphasised that small businesses are vital for South Africa. Like I said, Agoa currently supports at least 60,000 direct jobs in the country. Losing Agoa would negatively impact this. It is essential for government to prioritise small businesses and job creation.\n\nHon Patel, you spoke about the recent imbizo in the Cape Winelands and I feel sorry for you because you get allocated to a district that your party loses and where there are five municipalities where your party loses. So, you come here and I want to thank you for the good work that you do there.\n\nHowever, I also wonder when you go up on stage and you look at the results of the most recent elections and you say, hey, I\n\nfailed. However, the only reason why you have failed is because voters in the Western Cape have realised that supporting ANC policies will negatively impact them. That is why voters in this province have rejected you now, election after election after election. You are getting less than 20% because they know that here there is policy certainty. There is a red tape reduction unit and if you want to start up a small business, you can go somewhere and they will help you get through the hurdles and hoops. If they start up a small business in a municipality, they know they do not have to pay a bribe in order to get the necessary permissions. If they start a small business in one of the DA-run municipalities, they know that the refuse will be removed. They know that they do not have to spend money to fix their vehicles that drive through potholes. It’s the small things, like creating an enabling environment ... why we are so successful in this province, and once you learn that, colleagues, the rest of the country will be successful as well.\n\nAn analysis of South Africa's economic growth cycle and trade flows reveals a strong correlation between export-led growth and overall economic expansion. When our exports thrive, our economy prospers. South Africa is strategically located in one\n\nof the world's fastest growing regions — Africa. This geographical advantage should offer lucrative opportunities for South African businesses and entrepreneurs should be able to tap into this market, similar to how China and India rely on their large internal markets.\n\nHowever, our trade with African countries and other southern economies is hindered by cumbersome and costly import-export procedures, complex customs processes, limited regional integration and a lack of a clear trade strategy. Linked to this is how we treat our brothers and sisters from the African continent. Hon Rayi, you had a lot to say now about the conflict in Ukraine but you and your party were deathly quiet\n\n- I think you called it quiet diplomacy - when our neighbours went through turmoil and that caused millions of our neighbours from the north to move to South Africa for opportunities. Yet now, because of your failed policy, the growing unemployment and a competition for resources, we get instances of xenophobic violence towards our own brothers and sisters. That is a direct flow from the failed policies that were implemented.\n\nHon Patel, we did your question and answer session on the scrap metal ban ... I see I’ve now actually run myself out of time, but hon Ndabeni-Abrahams, your session that was postponed ... we will get you back here on the 21st and then we will get to the rest of those questions.\n\nI want to briefly touch on a few aspects. We often hear the critique from ANC colleagues that we only come here with criticisms, which is not true. We have put solutions to you quite often but I don’t know if it’s the willingness or the unwillingness to hear it that is the problem. However, I’m just going to touch on five key principles that speak to the heart of what both the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition and the Department of Small Business Development should do.\n\nOn the one hand you have the ANC that only targets the elites, the connected insiders. A small group of people benefit from your policies. You say a large group of people do but it’s not the case. However, on the other hand, the DA targets the vulnerable and the disadvantaged. Of course there is space for improvement. Of course there is space to expand on that, but at the end of the day, if you look at the scoreboard — and hon\n\nPatel, it’s Munster not monsters, but I mean it’s great for the economy that Munster will be travelling to us — you actually have a 25% unemployment rate, which is still unacceptably high. However, that is a good 10%, 15%, 20% less than the rest of the country or other provinces.\n\nThe DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms S E Lucas): As you\n\nconclude, hon member.\n\nMr J J LONDT: I know that you gave some extra minutes ...\n\nThe DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms S E Lucas): Hayi suka!\n\nContinue. I’m treating you the same as I treat everyone else. So continue.\n\nMr J J LONDT: I’m going to finish off with the last one. The big difference is also that the ANC’s policies deter investors. Hon Dangor laments the fact that people criticise South Africa. The problem is that it’s not just the opposition that criticises South Africa. It’s the people living ... expatriates living here that have family here; other Africans that live here and they tell their friends and their families how they are treated. So, hon Dangor, maybe if you look in the\n\nmirror and change your own policies, and you follow the example of what the DA is doing, you might get a little bit more investment. Hon Patel, you have a chance to change that course, otherwise, like the rest of Africa, the youth will step up and make that change for you. Thank you.\n\nMs N PIETERS (Eastern Cape): Hon Deputy Chairperson, Ministers and Deputy Ministers present, MECs, all hon members of this august House, ladies and gentlemen, ...\n\nAfrikaans:\n\n... goeie middag.\n\nEnglish:\n\nIt is an absolute pleasure and honour to take part in today’s debate on behalf of the Eastern Cape province. I wish to submit that the province welcomes and supports the Budget Vote of the Department of Trade Industry and Competition, DTIC, as presented by Minister Ebrahim Patel. The speech that he made demonstrated current economic challenges, progress on strides for recovery and plans to improve the current situation.\n\nThis financial year presents a rather interesting year, as it presents the final year of the current government term of administration, but also the final year before the 2024 national elections. We can all agree that the incumbent administration operated in a rather unique environment, as the government was forced to use its resources responding to the numerous economic blobs, including the Civid-19 pandemic, the July 2021 riots, the electricity crisis, recurring disasters and labour unrests.\n\nWe have seen steady recovery of the economy post the effects of Covid-19 and other economic shocks. The Eastern Cape is also recording good recovery figures. Our unemployment numbers are steadily decreasing, as the Eastern Cape’s unemployment rate now stands at 40%, down from 42,1% in the previous quarter.\n\nWe are also the province that registered the largest decrease in unemployment in the country year on year, as our unemployment rate decreased from 44% in quarter one of 2022 to 40% in quarter one of 2023.\n\nWhilst the decrease in unemployment numbers is pleasing and presents hope, they remain a concern for us and the concentrated support from the DTIC and national government will make meaningful impact on growing our economy and creating much-needed jobs.\n\nThe spatial planning and the structure of our economy must be revised to benefit the Eastern Cape and other rural provinces. For our economy to continue to be largely at the hands of Gauteng, the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces creates a huge economic risk for our country, as we have seen during the 2021 riots.\n\nOur economic developmental agenda for 2023-24 is anchored on, amongst others, township and rural economy, the revitalisation if state-owned entities and climate change. This aligns with the Minister’s vision to intensify the industrialisation as part of de-risking our economy.\n\nThe revitalisation of our state-owned industrial parks remains one of the top priorities in the province. Since 2015 to date, the government has contributed close to R600 million towards infrastructure projects in the various industrial parks. These\n\nparks need to be upgraded to provide world-class services to current and future industrial investors in the province.\n\nWe appreciate the support from DTIC and the provincial government for the upgrading of bulk infrastructure in the parks, which resulted in 460 deconstruction jobs and 46 operational jobs created during the event.\n\nThe parks are spread over the province, thus ensuring spread of the industrial infrastructure and include Vulindlela in Mthatha, Dimbaza in Buffelo city Metro, Butterworth, Ikomani and Somerset East.\n\nThe Wild Coast Industrial Park in Mthatha is the latest addition to the portfolio and is at the development stages, with R35 million invested for security fencing and for R49,5 million for bulk infrastructure. The park has an investment pipeline of R1,7 billion of agro-processing companies, with a mixture of local and foreign investors.\n\nOperationalisation support for the Wild Coast Industrial Park has resulted in 796 construction jobs being created and supporting 96 SMMEs. Additionally, a total of 10 investors\n\nwere secured, 21 in the pipeline and, in total, equating to R2,4 billion.\n\nThis has resulted in us submitting an application to grant the Wild Coast Industrial Park as a special economic zone status, SEZs. The SEZs in the province, which by nature have a better economic impact are currently located on the border of the western side of the Eastern Cape. This is our attempt to expand industrial activity beyond its concentration in the urban metropolitan areas.\n\nIt is our firm belief that branding the Wild Coast Industrial park in Mthatha as a SEZ would change the lives of our people that reside on the eastern side of the province. We therefore implore the Minister to prioritise our application.\n\nWe are delighted about the support from the DTIC for increasing the attraction in the province, which is largely driven by the Eastern Cape Development Corporation and the two special economic zones - East London Industrial Development Zone and Coega Development Corporation, CDC.\n\nThat positive trajectory is the culmination of multiple interventions undertaken by the province, in collaboration with the Minister’s department and at attracting numerous investors and positioning the Eastern Cape as a preferred investment destination.\n\nThe Eastern Cape held its provincial Investment Conference towards the end of 2022, which saw the announcement of 10 new projects with an investment value of R46 billion.\n\nThe Eastern Cape is home to most of the automating original equipment manufacturers, OEMs, in the country and these manufacturers account for a large portion of jobs created in the province and also contributes meaningfully to the GDP of the country.\n\nThe current challenges are inadequate electricity supply, and policy uncertainty on electric vehicles in the country poses a huge risk for the future of our relationship with these OEMs. We however believe that our recent interaction with the Minister of Electricity and the leadership of the automotive industry will yield positive results, to enable these OEMs to operate effectively and efficiently.\n\nWe appreciate that the DTIC had the White Paper on Electric Vehicles in 2021, and the province subsequently submitted a response to this paper for consideration of critical elements that would enable the province to transition to the electric vehicles, in line with global trends underpinned by climate change consideration.\n\nWe are however moving ahead with our plans of developing viable infrastructure in the province, including the establishment of at least 13 charging stations across the province.\n\nI wish to appreciate the continued support by DTIC and its leadership, as the province advances its efforts for inclusive economic growth and development, in particular the support they give at our SEZs and industrial parks. Our long-term plan is to capacitate the CDC and East London IDZs to be more than just bringing investment locations, but to be engines of economic growth and employment in the province.\n\nWe shall continue to explore and grand giant leap forward to excel the existing potential of these entities to achieve\n\nsound industrial development for massive economic growth in our province. I thank you.\n\nMr K M MMOIEMANG: Hon Deputy Chairperson and greetings to our hon Ministers and Deputy Ministers. Also a word of greetings to my colleagues both permanent and special delegates. Indeed in honouring Africa Day, Deputy Chairperson, allow me to pay homage to one of Africa’s outstanding sons the late President of Tanzania and our appreciation that they are celebrating Africa Day with us today. The outstanding son that we are celebrating is Mwalimu Juluis Kambarage Nyerere. In celebrating and paying homage to this outstanding son, allow me to quote his words:\n\nUnity will not make us rich, but it can make it difficult for Africa and for African people to be disregarded and humiliated. My generation, led Africa to political freedom. The current generation of leaders and the peoples of Africa must pick up the flickering touch of African freedom, refuel it with their enthusiasm and determination and carry it forward.\n\nIt is within this context Deputy Chairperson that I want to also follow suit in articulating the line as set out by our two Ministers and the Chairperson of the Select Committee on Trade Industry by recalling what the President of our country said in 2019 and I quote:\n\nWe will stimulate local demand and grow South African Manufacturing by making sure the “Buy Local Campaign” is everywhere and present.\n\nIndeed the President was doing this within the context of articulating the reimagined industrial strategy which is indeed underpinned by the ethos to localise. This is one of the key areas that was raised by Minister Patel.\n\nSince the announcement made by the President in the midst of the global pandemic we have observed the ANC-led government putting in place an intergraded approach together to drive that strategy. Implementing it and harvesting early fruits.\n\nThe buy local efforts typically have to address more than simple and appeal patriotism. It must broaden the productive forces which is inherently unjust. Consumers look at price and\n\nproduct relation or quality. Investors look to the size of the market and whether it justifies the investment. Consumers loot at the local availability on the shelves and the marketing there off.\n\nTherefore, the integrated approach it surround’s seeks to address these complementary elements of the Buy Local Campaign. To improve local products competitiveness, we have seen our government launching a series of industry masterplans to strengthen the supply side of industry.\n\nAs the select committee we had an opportunity to interact with the leadership of the department on these masterplans. To address the need for larger markets, the President furthermore launched the start of the trading under the African Continental Free Trade Area to enable ... [Inaudible.] ... to kick in.\n\nIndeed, Deputy Chairperson, to address the availability of locally produced products there are number of commitments that the business community and retailors has made in partnering with the ANC-led government around localisation campaign. For\n\nan example, Coca Cola has made a 250ml available to drive the campaign as part of its competition commitments.\n\nThis indeed will help us monitor implementation gaps and to identify new opportunities including products where we can scale up.\n\nSouth Africa is not unusual in the focus on local production. We have seen even people from other countries doing the same appealing for local consumers to buy goods made in their communities. Like was also the two successive years administration has done the same under the slogan the Buy America Campaign.\n\nSouth Africa recognised during the pandemic to rely on global suppliers came with enormous challenges and difficulties for our country. The pandemic has both exposed the fragility of global supply chains and revealed a great capacity we have here in South Africa innovation and adaptation in manufacturing.\n\nMore recently as indicated by the chairperson of the select committee, Ukraine and Russia has further exposed the\n\nvulnerability we are faced with due to the import reliance. It has nothing to do with the ANC-led municipality or ANC-led provincial government as a huddle.\n\nIn the space of just two year during the pandemic, through collaboration and out of necessity, we managed to build local production probability as the Minister has indicated around ventilators and sanitizers, medical grade, face masks, and gloves, vaccine and therapeutic masks and anaesthetics. Not only did we produce as the ANC-led government these goods to meet local needs, but also to meet the needs of other countries on the continent.\n\nLocal production is important because it encourages national pride in the goods and services and products made on our home soil. It supports the growth of small business and the expansion of larger fields. It creates employment and sustain livelihoods. Local production supports our manufacturing sector. It enables us to build much needed infrastructure and improve our services.\n\nAn example around localisation and its successes there of is that of Mr Rasheed who was a trader and an importer of Italian\n\nfurniture. With the weakening of the rand Mr Rasheed Gutta moved his procurement from Italy to China where, Italian designed furniture was manufactured for Mr Gutta’s design requirement. Over the years Mr Gutter noticed that Chinese Pradacian Mucize was steadily increasing and the rand was further weakening and is pleased with his profit margins. As we speak now, Mr Gutta is operating his production facilities in Gauteng. He is now vertically integrated and supply to his own stores. He also sells to leading furniture chain stores in South Africa. This are the successes of the ANC-led government in terms of localisation.\n\nAs part and parcel of the investment pledges and we saw since the start of the Sixth Administration, that the ANC-led government introducing the Investment Conferences to mobilise private sector contributes towards development as the Minister has indicated. We can indeed agree Minister, that there are currently, 161 projects that are either finalised or under construction. An example is the production of the new generation Ford barky which follows the R16 billion investment in the United States, US, car makers operation. Also the production capacity has increased of the Ford which now produces new Ranger from 164 000 to 200 000 units. This\n\nconstruction will be completed and since were advice, by the end of 2023.\n\nHon Deputy Chairperson, it is also an established fact that trade is not necessarily developmental, but rather preferential. Either in the form of bilateral or a regional form.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that they are essentially preferential in nature as they are intended to benefit signatory countries. However such agreements are sometimes abused by competitive third countries that penetrate the entire regional preferential markets.\n\nHowever, there are lessons to learn, the 21st Regional Trade Agreement such as the Association South East Asian Nations are about more than simply opening markets between preferred trading partners. They are also intended to encourage and incentivise investments particularly in the higher value-added manufacturing.\n\nIt is important that we also look into the analytical framework called by the African Continental Free Trade\n\nAgreement which is centred on four parallel pillars. Operation on building mutually, beneficially, fair trade integration and co-operation also on industrial development and upgrading in regional value-chains, but also on investment in cross border infrastructure and also building on democracy and on good governance.\n\nWe also appreciate the platform created by the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, Brics, block. The percentage share among Brics countries was just under 11% when compared to the East global trade in 2017. The engagements in Brics summits provided a platform and the discussion and the exchange of issues of mutual interest that have helped develop closer co-operation in strengthening of trade and investment ties between the Brics nation. We have seen that the commitments under the Brics plus configuration the benefits that will flow from the broadening or the growth of Brics including among other countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Kazakhstan will further and create an opportunity for the Brics nations or the Brics to grow. This will ensure shared benefits of trade. Our continents needs an adequate policy tool for building a\n\nregional value-chain and promoting transformative industrialisation.\n\nIt is important to also that in the interactions that the Africa Continental Free Trade Area will be looking forward to. It will be around five ideas. Amongst them is that the government needs industrial policy that supports the building of local firms that are crucial for cumulative capability.\n\nSecondly, is that the industrial parks as well as the attractive investment conditions should be created through fiscal financial and infrastructural incentives. The third one is the regional initiatives to upgrade infrastructure and create commonly regular frameworks across the region are fundamental. However, also there is a need for Africa to take control and revitalise its consumer market by addressing issues of second hand garments. It is important that we ensure that emerging trend which is a major opportunity for African countries must be embraced if we want to compete in the global economy. We have to take our integration of trade to higher level with the changing balances of forces globally. As South Africa we have to build internal capacity to enable us to survive global shocks.\n\nLet us intensify our Buy Local Campaign to be able to drive up demand in our country. Thank you, Deputy Chairperson. As the ANC we support this budget.\n\nThe DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms S E Lucas): Thank you\n\nvery much, hon Mmoiemang. As we continue with the debate, we will apologise for the hon Duma from KwaZulu-Natal. He is currently still presenting in the legislature. We will call on the hon Hadebe of the IFP to continue with the debate.\n\nMr N M HADEBE: Hon Deputy Chairperson, hon Ministers hon members. The Department of Small Business Development was established to support small businesses and corporatives, with a strong focus on programmes seeking to advance entrepreneurship amongst the most vulnerable groups in society. However, in the 2023-24 financial year, there have been budget cuts on entities which support small businesses.\n\nThis is concerning as it is these very same entities, which are the backbone of the survival of SMMEs.\n\nA number of issues such as the conflict and hostility between local and foreign-owned businesses and the lack of established legislation intended to specifically safeguard townships and\n\nrural enterprises have been raised over and over. The department has done nothing to this effect, despite the consistent calls to find a workable solution between local and foreign-owned businesses. Not only with these budget cuts to agencies such as Small Enterprise Development Agency have a direct bearing on small, medium and micro-sized enterprises, SMMEs access to finance, by they will also have a negative impact on the growth of the economy as SMMEs account for 34% of the country’s gross domestic product, GDP.\n\nHon Minister, it is important for this department to offer all the financial support to small businesses as they are struggling to cope with the intensity of Eskom. The frequency of load shedding has intensified with government offering little foresight of the problem is subsidising. These small businesses have to select hours to trade, limit their services especially those economic services, which make use of electricity such as hairdressers with hair dryers. These small businesses struggle to make ends meet as they are facing the growing pains of any business, but they are added the burden of load shedding which will surely enforce their closure.\n\nSo, adding in mechanisms such as generators and invertors to fend off the load shedding in their businesses is simply unaffordable. One of our constituency business owners has advised that, they are small tyre shop that is located rurally, has to turn away people at times if a job will fall into a load shedding time, as they are unable to operate the lifts to bring customer cars down. This is just one example of\n\n... [Inaudible] ... that people are being forced to turn away as a result, not to mention the job losses that these businesses face.\n\nTo address this, the department can establish a working relationship with commercial banks to make available and expand credit and loans to small businesses. Guaranteed access to loans for small businesses, of course under monetary will encourage more and more young people, women and people living with disabilities to also start their own businesses and subsequently be able to sustain themselves.\n\nIn dealing with the matters of Trade, Industry and Competition, the IFP has seen the great potential initiative at the Africa Free Trade Agreement has to bring. We are increasingly worried that the budget presented before us will\n\nnot adequately set the foundation for Africa Free Trade Agreement to be of major benefit to South Africa. Whilst we strive to work to an agreement that will unite Africa to work together efficiently, and yet our own country is struggling to get working.\n\nToday making marking Africa Day should unite us on how we can work together as Africans and make this continent self- sufficient and debt free from other world powers. Our agenda should today focus on the benefit of Africa Free Trade Agreement and the ways in which marginalised people could be given new hope. Instead, we see a very poorly allocated budget to of the biggest changes in Africa to come. Africa trading, manufacturing development in its own countries could have exponential growth.\n\nSA Revenue Service, Sars needs to be funded, incapacitated to manage illicit financial flows, and monitor monies owed to the revenue connector from foreign nations will conduct business in South Africa. We must look to develop infrastructure support for industrial zones of South Africa so that we can once free, trade between fellow African countries, capitalise on the benefits of opening up borders to free trade with other\n\nAfrican countries. Hon Chairperson, the IFP wishes to support both Vote 36 and Vote 39. I thank you.\n\nThe DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms S E Lucas): Before we\n\ncall on the hon F Majola, the Deputy Minister, we just want to acknowledge our guests up there. You are welcome to the debate. I see that in the past few days they have been quite interested in the debates that have been presented here. We will now call the hon Majola, the Deputy Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition. Hon Majola was the first person to present the Africa Free Trade Agreement to the National Council of Provinces and it is historical that we are welcoming him back here. Over to you Deputy Minister.\n\nThe DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE, INDUSTRY & COMPETITION (Mr F Z\n\nMajola): Hon Deputy Chairperson, Ministers; Patel, Ndabeni- Abrahams and De Lille, Deputy Minister, Gina; members of the executive council, MECs; hon members and fellow South Africans, let me begin by wishing all Africans in the continent and in the diaspora a happy Africa Day. This year’s celebrations mark the 60th anniversary which is being celebrated under the slogan: “Our Africa, Our Future.”\n\nAs we observe Africa Day, we must continue to show our ongoing commitment towards the all-inclusive integration of the African Continent. We are emboldened by the words of Haile Selassie, the former Emperor of Ethiopia, in the first meeting of the Organisation of African Unity when he said, and I quote: “Today, we look to the future calmly, confidently and courageously. We look to the vision of an Africa not merely free but united.”\n\nToday, we are pursuing that dream of our forebears to achieve a free and united Africa. Our focus on the African Continental Free Trade Area has been primarily on negotiating the legal frameworks for preferential trade to commence. While we continue to prioritise the conclusion of outstanding negotiation issues, we are now shifting our focus and efforts towards facilitating and maximising the opportunities presented by the African Continental Free Trade Area, AfCFTA.\n\nI would like to inform you that after substantial delays in achieving a common position, in February this year, the Southern African Customs Union achieved a common offer covering 90% of its tariff book. In the coming week, Minister Patel and I will travel to Nairobi Kenya, to attend the\n\nCouncil of Ministers which is expected to consider and approve the Southern African Customs Union, SACU, offer.\n\nIn collaboration with provincial governments, the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, DTIC, is undertaking a targeted awareness strategy in all provinces to identify opportunities for businesses. We want to identify and match key export priorities of each province with the new market access opportunities in countries and regions that have finalised their tariff offers.\n\nThe first of these provincial sessions took place in KwaZulu- Natal today and will be followed by Limpopo, Mpumalanga and the Western Cape in June and we hope to complete the process by the end of July 2023. Deputy Chairperson, last year we made a commitment to revise our spatial strategy in order to build and support a new model of special economic zones. This was informed by the need to involve all spheres of government as the only way in which we can speedily drive the special economic zones’ programme. The success of the new approach as evident in the Tshwane Automotive Special Economic Zone has prompted us to further expand the scope to other districts across the country.\n\nThe new approach recognises the capacity of special economic zones to advance regional economic development in support of the District Development Model. Yesterday, Minister Patel announced the imminent publishing of our intention to establish a special economic zone in Namaqua, Northern Cape. This special economic zone will catalyse growth and development in the district and neighbouring economies and will also bring more jobs and further investments to the entire province. In the Vaal, unemployment and poverty levels remain acute and the District Development Model presents an opportunity to harmoniously deploy state resources to uplift the quality of life of our people.\n\nAddressing the Sedibeng Presidential Imbizo held on the 12 August 2022, President Ramaphosa said, and I quote:\n\nBy far unemployment is the biggest challenge. The Gauteng government has ambitious plans to revitalise Sedibeng by developing agriculture, by developing logistics, tourism and industries as well. These plans are pivoted around the Vaal Special Economic Zone.\n\nWorking together with the Gauteng provincial government, the district and local municipalities, we are on a path of regeneration and rejuvenation in this region. The initial phase of the implementation of the proposed Vaal Special Economic Zone is anchored by two investment projects that are valued at R5,6 billion.\n\nThe Mitochondria Energy will establish a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell manufacturing facility in the Emfuleni local municipality for a total project cost of R4,3 billion. The Bluedrop Energy will establish a facility in the Lesedi Local Municipality for the manufacturing and distribution of composite liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, cylinders for a total investment of\n\nR1,1 billion. These two projects, which are scheduled to break ground within this financial year, will create a combined\n\n2 300 jobs during construction and 1 000 direct jobs at the operational phase.\n\nHon members, Minister Patel is leading a process that will unlock an investment that will catalyse the development of the Vaal Aerotropolis and the Vaal River City projects. The Minister announced these investments by City Bank earlier today. These two megaprojects along with the proposed Vaal\n\nSpecial Economic Zone, are the cornerstone of the interventions that will revitalise the Vaal economy and stimulate massive direct investment flows into the region.\n\nI am also proud to announce that our department in partnership with the Limpopo provincial government, district and local municipalities has advanced plans to create the Fetakgomo Industrial Park in Sekhukhune as a base for the creation of the proposed Fetakgomo-Tubatse Special Economic Zone. The proposed Fetakgomo-Tubatse Special Economic Zone has developed a positive investment pipeline of 35 domestic and global companies to the tune of just over R40 billion. Eight of these investors have shown keen commitment and confirmed to be ready to locate in the next 6 to 12 months and projected to invest just over R5,5 billion.\n\nThis proposed special economic zone has also presented an opportunity for government to collaborate with private investors to establish a new smart city in the Sekhukhune District. These investments will benefit communities of Fetakgomo-Tubatse, Sekhukhune District and the entire Limpopo province. Hon Deputy Chairperson, as we continue with the task of connecting with our people, two weeks ago I joined other\n\ngovernment leaders as we accompanied the Deputy President to Jagersfontein, a community ravaged by the tailings dam disaster.\n\nWorking with Deputy Minister Tau, the Free State provincial government and other departments we are embarking on a programme to help bring normality to the community of Jagersfontein. We will canvass resources to enable adequate and efficient service delivery to the people of this town, drive infrastructure investment and advance local economic development. The project to refurbish the rail corridor linking the Tshwane automotive hub with the port of Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape is gathering momentum.\n\nThe project is driven by national government working together with Gauteng and Eastern Cape governments and will help attract more investors and create more opportunities and jobs. The MEC has already covered the progress we are making in the Wild Coast Industrial Park. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this moment to share with you some of the projects funded by the department and its entities. Alpla, a world leader in the development and production of innovative plastic packaging solutions has an investment of R1 billion in the\n\nCity of Cape Town. The new plant will produce various plastic products including bottle closures and special packaging for the food and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nCreslow Energy Solutions is a 100% black-owned business founded in December 2021 based in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga, and will operates in the energy storage industry. ArtSolar is based in Durban and is capable of designing and implementing renewable energy solutions. This, hon members, is very important for our objective to establish South Africa as a critical role player in the supply of solar products.\n\nAs I conclude, I would like to thank Minister Patel and Deputy Minister Gina for their support, the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition family led by the acting Director- General, Ms Malebo Mabitje-Thompson. Lastly, the leadership of our entities. Once again, happy Africa Day. Our Africa, our future. I thank you.\n\nMs C LABUSCHAGNE: Hon Chairperson, Hon members, Hon Minister and fellow South Africans, it cannot be denied, economic hardship is increasing for most South Africans. Unemployment is persistently high, food price inflation is rising, the\n\neconomy is perishing and small business confidence has plummeted due to inter alia power cuts which are on an indefinite stage 6 or even more. This sector and country are facing very dark times with the Consumer Price Inflation above the SA Reserve Bank target band of between 3% and 6%.\n\nThe real crisis is that the ANC appears incapable of turning around state failure and boosting growth and jobs. Why is this? It is because your ANC government keeps favouring the elite when it comes to the awarding of contracts and course the exorbitant public service wage bill. For the elite, it’s government contracts, for the unions it’s pay increases.\n\nMinister, support from your department is few far and few between as we see small, medium and micro enterprises, SMMEs, having to divert to alternative sources of energy as they can no longer rely on the national grid. This has led to businesses facing severe financial losses, a drop in productivity and having to retrench many workers. Around 27% of businesses have indicated that their businesses will not be able to invest in alternative energy solutions. Even the CEO of Business Leadership of South Africa has stated:\n\nElectricity insecurity has damaged many of our businesses, made many investments impossible and destroyed jobs. It affects businesses both big and small while damaging the quality of lives of ordinary South Africans.\n\nLooking at township businesses, they have also indicated that they are struggling to stay afloat amidst the constant and crippling blackouts, this is according to a Nedbank Insights Report which was conducted in partnership with the Township Entrepreneurs Alliance. This report further indicated that 64% of township small businesses completely cease operations during load shedding, 66% of these businesses have shed jobs and load shedding has also led to increased operating costs, loss of revenue and declining margins which of course affects profitability. Businesses say that they don’t know how to look for solutions as they are not in a position to do so as they lack funding to become self-sustainable. This Minister is a source of grave concern and it would appear as if you and your government are very complacent about it as we see little to nothing being done to support this specific sector. A perception has been created that progress is being made in reducing red tape and promoting the ease of doing business with the establishment of the Red Tape Team in the Presidency.\n\nHowever, following last year’s Sona, where the President announced the establishment of the Red Tape Team, this team has been established in name only as since their inception nothing has happened.\n\nSipho Nkosi, the Task Team Leader, even indicated that this team has no permanent structure with no administrative capacity. The question that needs to be asked is, what purpose does this budget serve for this team, could these finances not rather have been utilised in supporting the struggling small, medium and micro enterprises businesses and industry?\n\nMinister, in February of this year you stated that the department and its agencies are urgently working on an energy relief package for small, medium, informal and micro sectors and that the details of the package are expected to be announced soon. We are now in May 2023 and still, we have not seen anything of this relief package on the table. Is it all talk or rather an attempt to chase votes for the 2024 elections with the usual empty promises?\n\nMinister, it is time that you put action to words to enable this sector to continue doing business and to furthermore\n\nensure that this assistance is not another opportunity for corruption. I thank you, Chair.\n\nMs M O MOKAUSE: Thank you, Deputy Chair of the Council, when the EFF was formed 10 years ago, men and women from all walks of life throughout South Africa came together and advise on the question of what needs to be done. Amongst those were ordinary South Africans, SMMES being part of those because they contribute towards economic freedom in our lifetime. They wanted to be a part of it. They wanted to be a part of this journey because a black child suffered before. This journey is about attaining economic freedom in our lifetime.\n\nWe are here 10 years later to reassure those ordinary people who are on a journey with us to attain economic freedom in our lifetime. That’s when we take over power in May 2024, the first task is to end load shedding. Their businesses will not suffer any loss under the EFF government. Chair, we say this because we are publicly inviting all those small businesses to come and showcase their businesses and sell their goods during the EFF 10th anniversary at the end of July at FNB Stadium when the commander-in-chief will be gracing this beautiful gathering of the masses of South Africa with the 10th year\n\nmessage July 2023. We do this because we are all aware that they are sometimes being evicted from their places of trade in all these big cities of South Africa governed by the ruling party, the African National Congress.\n\nThe Economic Freedom Fighters reject the proposed budget for Small Business Development and that of Trade and Industry. We reject the budget of this department which is simply meant for salaries and procurement and not assisting small businesses.\n\nAs the EFF, we stood on many platforms before and made it very clear that there is no need for this Department of Small Business, as there is no basis to separate Small Businesses from Trade and Industry.\n\nWe therefore reject this budget, as it is a budget intended for a department which was created out of a need to create positions for a certain faction in the ruling party and adding a burden to the already bloated Cabinet. We know this to be true as we have been on the ground, in various provinces across South Africa, understanding the decision to separate small businesses from industrial policy.\n\nFrom our groundwork, we have learnt that what was meant to be industrial zones in eMonti, Dimbaza and many other areas has turned out to be a feeding scheme for comrades who act as industrial entrepreneurs while their main aim is to loot what is meant to produce jobs for our people.\n\nEven when the communities in which these industrial areas are based kept on alerting this department that some of the claims that are made by the people who are getting large sums of taxpayers’ money to form viable industries are not doing so but they are enriching themselves. This fell on deaf ears.\n\nThis department keeps on acting as if it is well. Small businesses are not only suffering in the initiated industrial zones but in areas where the small business used to be vibrant, places such as Zwelitsha in the Eastern cape, Zone 1, eQonce, Mdantsane, Sada where the Minister originate from.\n\nWe found the same to be true in construction, retail, textiles, and hospitality industry. Black businesses, who need to meet rental demands in order to maintain a presence in malls and city centres, have closed down due to incompetency, because they have received no support from this sitting\n\ngovernment. This is disappointing to note for a Ministry which should have had by now a very clear program on how to assist women, young people and persons living with disabilities, especially those who are deliberately excluded by the current system, made to be slaves for white masters forever by this government. This is disappointing for a department which should have by now, had a database of all young people who are interested in starting and owning their own businesses regardless of their political affiliation.\n\nIn almost all the so-called industrial zones, there is no clear plan on how to deliberately push for women, youth and persons with disabilities to play a role in established businesses. It is only the few connected, especially those who have links with the ruling party who get funding and e"
