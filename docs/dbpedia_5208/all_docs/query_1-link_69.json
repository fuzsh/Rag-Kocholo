Data were obtained through semi-structured interviews with learners and educators who were purposively selected from two rural high schools and two rural primary schools. Data were analyzed and interpreted through a thematic approach. Findings revealed that most educators and learners were optimistic about using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to support teaching and learning; however, they faced challenges such as unstable network, expensive data, lack of devices, and digitally illiterate educators and they worked collaboratively in trying to manage the situation. Moreover, they were confident in their abilities to improve their digital challenges and learn new digital skills and competencies. Thus, recommendations to assist rural schools in exploring all possible avenues for successfully integrating ICT into their teaching and learning methods were made.",

        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nFormal education involves a deliberate and planned effort to create a learning environment and process. This framework enables learners to actively cultivate their personal and academic potential, meeting the needs of individuals, society, and the nation at large [1]. Formal education must promote the UNESCO notion of the four pillars of formal education such as learning to know; doing; being; and learning to live together [2]. Syaharuddin et al. [1] further emphasize that the dynamics of education necessitate an adjustment to keep up with the advancement of science and technology in preparing human resources with global competitiveness. Hence, education should aim at creating high-skilled human resources that can compete in the global period with actual human labour required for the twenty-first century. The goal of implementing twenty-first century education is to develop learners who are technologically informed, creative, innovative, and practical so they can compete in the globalized world. However, this is not the case to many South African rural schools which are in disadvantaged communities where there are major challenges such as financial challenges, inadequate learner support material, lack of clean water and sanitation, electricity, poor quality of teaching, lack of technical and digital skills, and inadequate support [2].\n\nRural schools are placed in quintile 1 in the quintile system used to categorize schools in South Africa, which starts at quintile 1 for the least advantaged schools and ends at quintile 5 for the richest schools [3]. COVID-19 outbreak exacerbated the situation for such schools as it forced the introduction and implementation of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) which is centred on the application of digital technologies to reduce divisions between the physical, digital, and biological spaces in education [4]. The focus had to shift from traditional teaching and learning methods to technology-integrated teaching and learning methods which is information communication technology (ICT). ICT includes the internet, computers, and mobile devices (such as mobile phones, tablets, and laptops) [5]. Kalisa and Picard [6] also agree that smartphones and tablets are the predominant mobile devices used for learning. Moreover, Adedoyin and Soykan [4] suggest that conducive ICT learning requires digital tools sensitive to school resources, a certain level of digital skills for both educators and learners and their attitudes with respect to technology are central to transformative learning.\n\nIn this chapter, transformative learning refers to the shift from traditional teaching methods and learning to online learning methods where educators and learners from these schools are not technologically savvy. Cranton and Taylor [7] perceive transformative learning as a person’s creative enlightenment, which includes both spiritual awakening and learning new concepts or skills that would not have been learned otherwise. Transformative learning is perceived as learning which touches deeper levels of knowing and meaning, and, by so doing, then influences the immediate and concrete levels of knowledge, perception, and action [8]. Learning about ICT in the classroom enables learners to acquire a wide range of important practical skills and opportunities that can be used to encourage community social development [9]. South African government wants to integrate ICT education in rural schools to achieve universal basic education and to invest in education [10]. ICT education is therefore crucial in helping learners gain the knowledge needed for the twenty-first century and building informed societies, especially in rural areas. ICT can be used in schools to increase access to and dissemination of high-quality instruction. South African Department of Basic Education supplied computers and tablets to schools in an attempt to keep learners and educators current with new technology skills [11]. Even though Zeoli [12] points out that today’s youth are so tech-savvy and are always glued to their devices (toys to smartphones, smart tv), they take part in various social media platforms thus, integrating technology into learning is not a challenge for this generation.\n\nThe introduction of a broadband connection to every school was required by the South African National Broadband Policy of 2013, which is part of a project to guarantee the availability of broadband internet access throughout the nation by the year 2030 [13]. According to the National Broadcast Policy, improving educators’ and principals’ internet connectivity is necessary to support learners’ access to and use of educational resources that can improve classroom instruction and foster the growth of their digital skills. The difficulty of providing equal facilities to learners in rural and urban areas, however, posed the biggest problem. A factor that contributes to the visible gap between learners in rural and urban areas is access to telecommunications technology and internet connections [14]. Moreover, COVID-19 pandemic sped up this process as schools had to integrate ICT to support teaching and learning irrespective of their readiness.\n\nMost of learners and educators in rural schools are not capacitated to use online learning mode effectively and are facing challenges in using the virtual platforms. Though some learners are digitally literate and have technological backgrounds, however, they are not familiar with using such knowledge in teaching- learning platforms since they acquired the skill through self-regulated learning (SRL). According to Alvarez et al. [15], SRL refers to how students become masters of their learning processes. They see this process as an active, positive one in which students set goals for their learning and then try to monitor, regulate, and control their cognition, motivation, and behaviours, guided and constrained by their goals and the contextual features in the environment [15]. They go on to describe it as a fundamental cognitive and metacognitive process that entails controlling and managing one’s own thoughts, emotions, behaviours, and learning strategies in order to achieve particular goals or outcomes [15].\n\nHowever, many aged educators from the selected schools are not digitally literate, have little or no computer knowledge and struggle to create or present information digitally therefore, guiding learners on relevant digital strategies to implement was a challenge.\n\nFor this study, data was collected from 4 rural schools (2 primary and 2 secondary) in East London outskirts in the Eastern Cape province in trying to respond to the following questions:\n\nWhat are rural educators’ and learners’ perceptions on using ICTs to support teaching and learning?\n\nHow does technology readiness impact on the adoption of ICT to support teaching and learning in rural schools?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Literature review\n\n2.1 Migration of education activities to online method\n\nThe only choice left to schools after governments announced physical school closures as a means of halting the pandemic’s spread globally and locally was to implement online learning and teaching [16]. To accomplish their setup objectives, educational institutions all over the world have started the digital transformation process. Hodges et al. [17] report that while some institutions experienced a smooth transformation process, others experienced a crisis-response migration process because of the pandemic.\n\nThe transition to online teaching and learning came with several logistical difficulties, but one of the most significant was that it forced education administrators, educators, and learners to change their attitudes about the value of online teaching and learning [18]. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, some schools offered distance learning, which aided them during migration. Online learning is the process of creating educational materials, delivering instructions, conducting virtual classes, and managing programs using the internet and other key technologies.\n\nHrastinski [19] highlights the two methods of online learning such as synchronous and asynchronous are frequently compared however, for online learning to be effective and competent, educators, organizations, and education institutions must have a systematic understanding of the benefits and drawbacks. In higher education institutions, digital transformation can be regarded as the culmination of all digital processes required to complete the transformation process and provide opportunities for higher education institutions to effectively apply digital technologies, according to Kopp et al. [20].\n\nAccording to Kopp et al. [20] five well-known beliefs that are more expected to prevent higher education institutions from undergoing a digital transformation than they are to help it happen. These beliefs are (i) change, (ii) pace, (iii) technology, (iv) competences, and (v) financing. According to Means et al. [21], online teaching and learning is the educational use of technological tools, devices, and the internet. Since the turn of the millennium, there has been an increase in the drive for online learning, but Joshi et al. [22] found that the effectiveness of online learning is in doubt when it prevents face-to-face interaction, when both educators and learners have subpar levels of digital competency, and when information about online learning is both accessible and available. Prensky [23] emphasizes that because they were born and raised in the digital era and are tech-savvy, today’s learners and some faculty members are considered to be “digital natives”. Shariman et al. [24] came to the conclusion that the effects of new digital technologies to redefine literacy are still not fully understood because a significant portion of them lack the skills expected of digital natives.\n\n2.2 Digital readiness\n\nICT is a powerful tool for bringing about significant change and advancement in the context of traditional education [25]. ICTs in education are used to enhance the calibers of teaching and learning and to democratize access to education. The invention of appropriate educational materials, which can involve high fixed costs, can be accomplished economically if target markets are identified and established by overcoming the relatively high fixed costs of obtaining access to IT resources. Rural ICT providers can offer these educational services affordably as part of a wider range of services.\n\nDuring COVID-19, the emphasis on education has transitioned to better reflect the techno-economic culture. The modification ought to have been coordinated with methods to mitigate its effects on the standard learning process [26]. The institutions’ and learners’ needs should be prioritized to bring positive change because of the shift to online learning. To ensure the best teaching practices in monitoring and guiding learners, online learning could be implemented in schools in the primary stages. Then later learners can apply it away from school at their convenient time and place. Hence, Siripongdee, Pimdee, and Tuntiwongwanich [27] emphasize how flexible it can be and is the best method for larger classes and it is a learner-centred instruction, so learners can actively engage in learning.\n\nThe importance of the role the educators play in facilitating communication and collaboration with learners is highly considered as significant in transforming the learners’ perceptions and attitudes towards online learning. The success of online learning relies on the educators’ digital abilities, content expertise, creativity, choosing relevant activities, and teaching methods is key. Similar to this, staff and learner training is essential for successful online learning [28].\n\n2.3 Online learning challenges\n\nRural South African schools have long struggled with issues related to their underprivileged setting, such as a lack of infrastructure and classrooms, as well as restricted access to services like water, electricity, and landlines [29]. Such schools are currently facing new challenges because of digital advancements. On top of the mentioned challenges, rural-urban digital inequalities add to the list that must be addressed to give rural schools the tools they need to overcome these challenges. Blank et al. [30], highlight demographic factors as a major factor in internet usage differences between rural and urban areas.\n\nGiven that education levels can affect digital inequalities, the integration of ICT resources and ICT literacy instruction in rural schools is an important topic. National and international literature has discussed these issues and potential solutions, but these studies do not address how rural schools, particularly those in South Africa, are impacted by and should handle technological advancements. This study has a particular interest in looking more closely at schools in rural areas because these areas are frequently slower to adopt digital literacy developments due to the challenges mentioned earlier.\n\n2.4 Theoretical framework\n\nTheories that underpinned this study were the transformative learning theory by Mezirou [31] and the technology readiness index (TRI) model by Parasuraman and Colby [32].\n\n2.5 Transformative learning theory by Mezirou\n\nTransformative learning theory involves a process of critical reflection and self-examination that leads to changes in an individual’s beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors [31]. It is characterized by a shift in perspective, as the individual begins to examine their previously held assumptions and beliefs. Transformative learning refers to the enhancement of a learner’s capacity to transform experiences and content into broadly applicable knowledge, skills, and perspectives. Mezirou [31] defines transformative learning as the critical awareness of unspoken assumptions or expectations and the assessment of the applicability of providing an interpretation. He highlights that transformative learning frequently results in a significant shift in a person’s beliefs, attitudes, perspectives, or behaviors. In this study, learners and educators were expected to shift from face-to-face teaching and learning mode to the integration of ICT in their teaching and learning mode. They were expected to upload and download information, conduct virtual sessions, and have online assessments, basically, they were expected to be technological savvies without training and insufficient resources. They had to analyze, verify, and reframe the meaning of their experiences which was a profound shift in awareness that altered their perceptions of ICT. Hence Mezirow emphasizes that the theory causes a paradigm shift that will directly affect experiences moving forward, learners tend to discover their actual capabilities or hidden talents.\n\nMezirow suggests that there are three codes that form meaning structures:\n\nSociolinguistic codes: the impact of society on the mental models and structures of individuals. Social customs, cultural expectations, and linguistic usage are typical examples.\n\nPsychological codes: This relates to a person’s emotional and mental state. These include their ideas and feelings, which have an immediate impact on their conceptual frameworks.\n\nEpistemic codes: Epistemic codes focus on how knowledge is acquired, its veracity, and the circumstances of the learning process. Learners will place less value on new information if it does not directly originate from a trustworthy source.\n\n2.6 Technology readiness index (TRI) model\n\nThe Parasuraman-developed technology readiness index (TRI) is a framework for evaluating people’s readiness to adopt and use technology [32]. The framework examines people’s intentions to use technology, focusing more on their mental states than their skill sets (with, however, the recognition that digital skills may influence the state of mind). The TRI uses four concepts such as optimism, innovativeness, discomfort, and insecurity to understand an individual’s state of mind, in this case, we are referring to learners and educators from rural schools. Parasuraman believes that with technology you need to have a positive mindset, and willingness to be innovative and overlook or pay no attention to discomfort or insecurities you may experience along the way. For this study, all four schools are in the rural areas where both educators and learners are technology illiterate and are experiencing challenges such as network connectivity, many hours of interruption of electricity supply, and technological factors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Results and discussion\n\nThis study explored how educators and learners in rural schools in South Africa’s Eastern Cape province perceived transformative learning through technological support. The participants had to adapt their traditional teaching and learning methods to ICT-based or blended teaching and learning methods. The COVID-19 pandemic has sped up the process of implementing the 2030 vision, 4IR in education and other sectors. Findings revealed that digital inequalities still exist amongst rural and urban schools in the province and this has impacted negatively towards rural schools. Pillay [2] emphasizes the numerous issues confronting schools in rural areas such as unstable electricity, high dropout rates, inadequate classroom infrastructure, a lack of technologically savvy educators, poor network connectivity, and a lack of teaching and learning resources. Many learners highlighted the problem with network coverage, and how hard for them to even access online the learning materials provided by the Department of Basic Education. They were frustrated that their geographic area does not allow them to fully participate online, saying this style of delivering teaching is proper for learners who are staying in cities where there is always full network coverage.\n\nThe study found out that schools in rural areas struggle with teaching resources as they do not have computer laboratories and cannot even afford to have the luxury of having ICT resources. Learners from such schools have fewer opportunities to interact with digital devices even at home, as they come from low socioeconomic backgrounds and they often show reluctance towards computers. According to Mestry and Ndhlovu [3], this has an impact on the role of schools, which are in charge of both teaching learners on how to responsibly use ICT equipment and demonstrating to them the value of learning digital skills. The study also showed that rural poverty is one of the biggest issues South Africa is dealing with, and as a result, schools in rural areas face difficulties in providing an effective education. Inadequate state funding, a lack of resources, and overcrowded teaching have an impact on the quality of education [29].\n\nMany learners expressed their mixed emotions when educators informed them about infusing technology in teaching-learning even after COVID-19. They welcomed the initiative as they realize the need to be relevant and be equipped with the digital skills required for the twenty-first century however, they were anxious that they could not afford any devices. Some are only able to have access to tablets and internet at school, after school hours is a challenge as they do not own smartphones and must borrow to access any announcements some educators might post after hours. In addition to the lack of devices, the research participants also reported that many educators do have laptops with data uploaded monthly however, the aged ones are unable to use the devices, and they do not know online learning applications, websites, or software applicable to their contents which makes it challenging for these educators to assist learners. “In my school, some of the colleagues cannot even use the laptops government gave us. They were trained as educators 30 years ago when computers were not common in South Africa or in rural areas and now, we are expected to use them, it is a hustle for some of us”. And participant 2 added that “some educators are not familiar with these things, in my school, I always assist my educators with software or application for various things, and relying on such educators to help with online teaching will be a waste of time”.\n\nFindings also revealed that many educators in rural schools especially the aged lack advanced digital skills, and there is a risk that they are merely using ICT equipment incorrectly or not all, since they do not fully realize its potential in addressing learners’ needs [33]. The department gave us laptops and provided data on a monthly basis, integrating my lessons with technology is interesting, I can see that from my learners, they enjoy it so much. It is convenient as technology does most of the work for you, however it is not easy to find your way, but we are learning small-small. Hence, World Bank [34] highlights how educators’ lack of digital literacy impacts on learners’ digital knowledge gap and accessibility. Insufficient digital skills on educators hinder learners’ research abilities and hinder them from using websites to find relevant academic articles [34]. The fact that in these schools, many educators are elderly and lack the necessary digital expertise to guide or assist the learners was also mentioned by the learners as not providing them with much guidance or assistance. They emphasized that they learned digital skills on their own to deal with COVID-19. The World Bank [34] also emphasizes that learners who are already proficient and knowledgeable about using technology tools to support their learning and online sources, who have adequate access to good bandwidth and connected devices, and who are supported by their family and peers, will be able to make the best use of online learning. Therefore, the effectiveness of any curriculum implementation depends on the user system’s capabilities thus if educators’ training has been compromised, the curriculum will be implemented ineffectively."
