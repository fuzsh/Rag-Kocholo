        "text": "The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) provides an overall measure by pulling together a weighted combination of transformed and standardised scores from each of the seven domains.\n\nFigure 6.1 shows the relative weights (out of 100) used to combine the scores from each of the domains. The final weights applied were the result of a combination of analysis of the data, expert opinion and consultation. Income and Employment deprivation make up 45 per cent of the IMD between them and Health and Education deprivation make up a further 27 per cent. Barriers, Crime and Living Environment deprivation have less influence with weights of less than 10 per cent each. Income and Employment deprivation are more than twice as important as these latter domains. A later section shows how levels of deprivation identified under each of these domains vary across the country and differ from each other.boxed-textboxed-text\n\nSpatial Patterns of the Indices of Deprivation\n\nThe first stage in our analysis is to look at what the indices tell us about the pattern of deprivation across England. First we consider the overall patterns of deprivation at the LA and LSOA level, then we consider how the individual domains of the IMD vary across the country.\n\nThe IMD at the Local Authority Level\n\nMap 6.2 shows the overall IMD rank for each local authority in England. The rank is calculated from a weighted average of the individual LSOA scores within each local authority. A rank of 1 represents the most deprived local authority and a rank of 354 represents the least deprived. Areas are shaded on the map using four equally sized groups, so that 25 per cent of local authorities fall into each group. For example, the LAs shaded dark green are the least deprived 25 per cent of local authorities.\n\nThe patterns here would seem to be fairly strong.\n\nThe least deprived areas spread across a broad swathe of the south of England and also in a block covering parts of Cumbria, Lancashire and Yorkshire. Further groups are seen in Cheshire and on the Norfolk/Suffolk coast.\n\nThe most deprived areas would seem to be focused in two distinct types of areas. Firstly there is a very clear concentration of deprived LAs in urban areas. The pattern is most noticeable around London and in a broad band that runs all the way from Liverpool to Leeds & Sheffield and down into Nottingham. Nonetheless these areas are not unique – almost all urban LAs fall into the bottom 25 per cent of the IMD at this level. Birmingham, Plymouth, Hull, Bristol, Brighton and Newcastle all emerge as deprived.\n\nThere is, however, a second pattern here which, ironically, seems to relate to remoteness from urban areas. Coastal areas around the Wash, in Cumbria and in the South West all have LAs with high levels of deprivation according to the IMD. On inspection of this map alone there would seem to be a strong relationship between the urban / rural character of areas and their level of deprivation. Urban areas and the most remote areas would seem to be the most deprived.\n\nThe IMD at the Lower Layer SOA level\n\nAs ever, viewing the data at a lower level provides a different perspective and shows that different patterns emerge at different scales.\n\nMap 6.3 shows IMD rankings for every Lower Layer SOA (LSOA) in England.\n\nAs would be expected, the overall pattern is very similar to that for local authorities.\n\nThe least deprived (dark green) areas are areas outside the cities but relatively close to them. A broad area of the South East along with the ‘suburban’ areas near many of the main cities across the whole of the country all fall into this category. Map 6.13, later in this article, shows the location of urban areas and may be useful for reference here.\n\nThe most deprived areas (dark grey) also mirror the earlier pattern – they are very heavily focused on urban areas. LSOAs in cities are not universally highly deprived however. Areas in the least deprived group are virtually absent from cities but the severely deprived areas are fragmented – all urban areas show holes where there are ‘middling’ areas and all cities include pockets of low deprivation.\n\nThe ‘remoteness’ element of deprivation that we identified at the LA level is also clearly evident at the LSOA scale. The coastline around the Wash, the more remote part of Northumberland and Cumbria, the Welsh borders and, most strikingly, much of the South West all suffer deprivation that would appear to be directly related to their remoteness. Even coastal areas in Kent appear to be deprived in this way.\n\nAgain a comparison with the rural/urban map (Map 6.13) is worthwhile – showing what seems to be a remarkably strong relationship between the most remote rural areas and deprivation.\n\nThe extremely deprived areas (dark grey) in remote areas we identified at the LA level are less obvious at the LSOA scale – but the relationship is still there. For the most part the most deprived LSOAs do seem to be ‘coastal’ rather than principally remote. The coast of Lincolnshire, East and West Sussex and Devon all have highly deprived coastal areas apparently related to the location of deprived coastal towns. Three additional areas are interesting – the extreme tip of Cornwall, the Isle of Sheppey on the north coast of Kent and a broad area across the middle of the Fens in the north of Cambridgeshire. All appear as highly deprived – again being ‘cut-off’ seems to be influencing the level of deprivation.\n\nRemember that some of these coastal areas are likely to have a relatively elderly population and that this may be having an influence on the measured levels of deprivation. Equally it is worth noting that deprivation is a complex concept and that different things matter to different people. For some, remoteness and inaccessibility will be seen as a positive influence on their quality of life.\n\nWhatever the precise patterns, a consideration of this data at both scales shows clearly how the LA level data smoothes out significant variations in the data. This variation clearly underlines the importance of using the lower level data wherever possible – and particularly when targeting resources.\n\nThis initial inspection of the patterns has focused on the overall IMD but it is important to remember that this is a complex and multi-faceted measure. Areas identified as deprived will all have different mixes of factors leading to their deprivation. In one area high deprivation may be related to low income or high unemployment, while in another, barriers to housing and services may be the key factor. The next section looks at how these different factors – the domains of the IMD – vary across the country.\n\nFurther background: The Indices of Deprivation\n\nThe IMD forms part of a package of indicators – The Indices of Deprivation – maintained by CLG.\n\nSets of indicators published for Wards in 1998 and 2000 were extended to form a more complete scheme of indicators and the ‘Index of Multiple Deprivation’ summary measure for LSOAs in 2004.\n\nThis set of indicators (ID04) was updated, with some additions, in 2007 (ID07). While the early measures had been published at the ward level, ID04 and ID07 were published for the new Super Output Area geography which is ‘frozen’ and does not change over time. This, combined with the fact that the methodology underpinning ID04 and the ID07 are largely the same mean that, with some caveats, comparison between the indices is possible.\n\nA guidance document describing the purpose, methodology and sources for construction of the indices ‘The English Indices of Deprivation 2007’ is available for download from the Communities and Local Government website. This document also includes an analysis of the most and least deprived 20 per cent of LSOAs on a regional basis and excellent maps of the overall IMD measure at the LSOA level. This article does not repeat this analysis – rather it provides a more detailed regional level analysis and looks within the individual domains making up the IMD.\n\nGuidance: Using the Indices of Deprivation\n\nThe Indices are an immensely powerful tool for summarising the level of deprivation in an area or for pinpointing pockets of deprivation. They have been widely used to help focus and monitor renewal policy and are the best measures currently available for England.\n\nThere are however a number of caveats to be aware of when using the IoD to analyse small areas.\n\nMost importantly it is critical to remember that not all deprived people live in deprived areas and conversely, not everyone living in a deprived area is deprived; the indicators identify areas with characteristics associated with deprivation – not deprived people\n\nThe Income domain (for example), does not measure income. Its main inputs are measures of the number of people on particular benefits in each area (and so assumed deprivation in terms of income). Accordingly the indices should not be used as a measure of affluence. Low levels of income deprivation do not necessarily mean an area is affluent\n\nThe indices provide a relative measure of deprivation and therefore cannot be used to determine how much more deprived one LSOA is than another. For example, it is not possible to say that an LSOA ranked 10 is twice as deprived as an LSOA ranked 20. However, it is possible to say that the first LSOA is more deprived than the second\n\nThe scores and ranks cannot be used as absolute measures of deprivation or to identify absolute change over time. The indices are good for spotting where things have improved (or otherwise) but some care must be taken in assessing change between ID04 and ID07. See the CLG guidance for more details\n\nThe Income and Employment domain scores are rates. It is therefore appropriate to describe the LSOA in terms of the proportion of the population experiencing income or employment deprivation. For example, if the LSOA has a score of 0.63 on either of these domains, then we can say that 63 percent of its population is either income or employment deprived. This does not apply to the other five domains\n\nIt is not appropriate to use the scores to compare an LSOA between domains. This is because the scores have different ranges and different minimum and maximum values. If you want to compare across domains, then ranks should always be used\n\nThe Indices are for England only. Although the Indices for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland use similar methodologies, it is not valid to compare them. The Office for National Statistics is currently preparing guidance on how to approach comparison between the separate schemes\n\nThe following maps show the distribution of high and low levels of deprivation for individual domains of the IMD – all at the LSOA level. For clarity at this scale only the 25 per cent most deprived (grey) and 25 per cent least deprived (green) of the SOAs are shown.\n\nIn interpreting these maps it is important to remember that our perception of these patterns is partially influenced by differences in size of the LSOAs. LSOAs are synthetic statistical areas built from postcodes and designed specifically to capture small areas of similar population size (averaging around 1,500 people). Accordingly urban LSOAs are much smaller (in area) than rural ones. The majority of LSOAs in England are ‘urban’ (around 80 per cent – see the later discussion) but larger suburban or rural LSOAs can seem to dominate on many of these maps. This should be borne in mind when studying the patterns.\n\nNote: Limited space means we focus on a limited part of the country for this article – but maps plotting results for each domain for the whole of England are available to download from the Neighbourhood Statistics website.\n\nIncome Deprivation\n\nThe Income Deprivation domain aims to measure the proportion of the population experiencing income deprivation and is built using a range of measures of income related benefits.Footnote 3\n\nMap 6.4 shows ranks for the ‘Income Deprivation’ domain.\n\nThere are some striking similarities to the spatial patterns shown for the combined IMD (see the darkest green areas on Map 6.3). This is perhaps not surprising as the Income domain is given one of the heaviest weightings when calculating the IMD and there is an obvious correlation between income and deprivation.\n\nThere are some subtle differences between the maps however.\n\nAlthough the overall spread is very similar, a close look at the patterns in Norfolk, Suffolk and Kent for example shows that local patterns vary a great deal. Even for this domain, the most closely correlated to the IMD, different dimensions of deprivation provide subtly different results.\n\nInterestingly a close look at the urban areas shows another difference. Although most urban areas are highly deprived both on the IMD and Income domain there would seem to be more ‘non-deprived’ LSOAs in the centres of some of the cities on the Income domain than the IMD. There are some pockets of relatively better off areas in cities – but these are being ‘pulled-down’ by other aspects of deprivation included in the IMD.\n\nEmployment Deprivation\n\nThe Employment Deprivation domain aims to measure ‘involuntary exclusion of the working-age population from work’ and is based on a number of measures of those receiving benefits.\n\nMap 6.5 shows ranks for the Employment domain, and there are obvious similarities to the Income domain. However, the least deprived LSOAs for the Employment domain seem to spread further out than did the least deprived areas identified for the Income domain Map 6.4.\n\nExamples of this can be seen in Suffolk to the North East of London and in Kent where the least deprived LSOAs for the Employment domain spread further than the least deprived LSOAs for the Income domain. London would seem to be having an influence on employment deprivation (or lack of it) far beyond its boundaries – and, interestingly, a greater effect than that observed on income.\n\nThe most deprived area around Central London also appears smaller than on previous maps suggesting that London is less employment deprived than income deprived. In the top left hand corner of the map (around Bradford/Leeds and Sheffield) the opposite is the case – this area is showing more areas with severe employment deprivation.\n\nRemember the IMD is ranked and so a relative measure. ‘Success’ in one part of the country influences the rank of deprivation elsewhere.\n\nHealth Deprivation and Disability\n\nThe Health Deprivation and Disability domain identifies areas with ‘relatively high rates of people who die prematurely or whose quality of life is impaired by poor health or who are disabled’.\n\nThe pattern for most and least deprived LSOAs for this domain (Map 6.6) is again broadly similar to the preceding two domains. Again, ‘suburban’ areas do best and cities and ‘remote’ areas worst.\n\nIt is difficult to be definitive from this type of analysis but, if anything, the differences between city and suburb seem to be polarised here. There would seem to be highly deprived core in the centre of London (and other cities), while deprived ‘gaps’ are rarer in suburban areas.\n\nThese first three domains have shown a fairly similar pattern. The remaining domains start to show more significant differences, and so to show why the IMD is such a complex measure.\n\nEducation, Skills and Training Deprivation\n\nThe Education, Skills and Training Deprivation domain (Map 6.7) measures deprivation in educational attainment, skills and training using a range of Key Stage results, measures of qualifications and the number of school absences.\n\nAgain broadly non-deprived areas spread across much of the Home Counties – but on closer inspection the areas of deprivation have a quite different pattern.\n\nThe urban areas in the top left corner of the map (Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield, Nottingham) show a clear pattern of deprivation. For the most part urban areas are education deprived – but this is much less the case in London. There are, of course, severely deprived areas in London but they are more fragmented than in previous domains and there are significant areas of low deprivation within its boundary – notably to the west of the city. To some extent this is a particular London effect – London is simply less education and skills deprived than other cities. A look outside this areaFootnote 4 shows similar, though less marked, effects in other major cities such as Bristol, Birmingham and Manchester.\n\nThe most obvious differences here, however, are the appearance of a number of clusters of highly deprived LSOAs in the most remote areas. The most obvious of these is a group around the Fens south of the Wash but more remote parts of Essex and Kent (again including the Isle of Sheppey), and much of the coastline of Lincolnshire emerge as highly deprived. The Isle of Wight is similarly deprived. Clearly accessibility is playing some part in these areas and it seems likely that this element of deprivation may be contributing to the overall ‘remoteness’ effect we identified in the IMD.\n\nCrime Domain\n\nThe Crime domain measures the rate of recorded crime for four major crime types – burglary, theft, criminal damage and violence (Map 6.8).\n\nWithin the Crime domain there is a very different spatial distribution. The most deprived LSOAs are mainly located in major towns and cities, while the least deprived LSOAs tend to be located in rural or remote locations. The clear conclusion here is that crime is a largely urban phenomenon, and that rank improves when moving away from urban areas. The ‘spread’ of more deprived areas beyond those indicated on earlier maps perhaps even suggests that transport and accessibility are playing a role in areas experiencing high rates of crime.\n\nThis pattern is hardly surprising but the strength of the relationship is striking.\n\nAlthough there are some subtle differences, the relative similarity of the preceding maps suggests that these domains are showing elements of deprivation that are, at least partially, related to each other. The next two domains show greater differences, but this is not a problem. These differences are why it is worth having separate domains making up the IMD – deprivation is a complex phenomenon and different facets of deprivation affect different people.\n\nThe Living Environment\n\nThe Living Environment domain aims to identify deprivation in the ‘quality of the local environment’. The domain pulls together two sub-domains: 1) ‘indoors’ which measures poor housing condition and 2) ‘outdoors’ which includes air quality and a count of road traffic accidents.\n\nThe mixed nature of this domain results in a very different spatial distribution to that we have seen on previous maps. A larger area of Map 6.9 is shaded for the middle-ranked LSOAs than we have seen before.\n\nAs usual the cities seem to fare badly – but, if anything, it is the very centres of urban areas that are most deprived. As well as poor housing stock these areas might be expected to suffer from poor air quality and large numbers of traffic accidents. A wider range of rural and coastal areas are also in the most deprived category – this time perhaps because of poor housing conditions. Overall the groups would seem to be polarised again in this domain.\n\nThe least deprived LSOAs are not in major cities but are scattered across the area. Better air quality, fewer accidents and a higher quality of housing stock are all likely to be contributing here.\n\nBarriers to Housing and Services\n\nThe Barriers to Housing and Services domain also consists of two sub-domains: 1) ‘geographical barriers’ which measures accessibility of shops, GPs, schools and Post Offices and 2) ‘wider barriers’ which includes issues relating to access to affordable housing.\n\nAgain the mixed nature of this domain results in a completely different pattern. For the first time urban areas do not dominate the most deprived areas (Map 6.10).\n\nRemember, as mentioned before, the maps show quartiles so each map actually has the same number of LSOAs falling in each category. The apparent ‘spread’ and multiplication of deprived areas here is a purely visual effect – the result of deprived areas in this case being more rural, so larger in geographic area, than previously.\n\nThe pattern here is actually close to the reverse of that on previous maps where deprivation is much more likely in rural areas. London is an exception in this domain – an urban area where increased accessibility of services is not sufficient to pull it out of deprivation, probably because of the lack of affordable housing.\n\nThe least deprived LSOAs in this domain tend to be located near towns and cities (excluding London). All of the urban areas in the top left corner of the map have significant less-deprived areas associated with them – the result of good access to services and more affordable housing. Interestingly the urban areas in the South East have much fewer such areas – again probably a housing cost effect.\n\nThe maps above have shown that there are clear differences, as well as strong patterns of similarity, in the spatial distribution of the IMD and its separate domains.\n\nNonetheless, some general patterns emerge when studying the domains. There would seem to be a strong urban influence on the degree of deprivation in all of the domains but also a clear factor relating to ‘remoteness’ in many. The Income, Employment and Health domains display very similar patterns mirroring that for the overall IMD. Education deprivation is often urban although major cities also seem to draw in skills and an educated population – at least in places. Crime seems to have a much more direct relationship with accessibility to the urban areas than the other domains. The Living Environment and Barriers domains on the other hand show completely different patterns – in part as a result of their different and sometimes mixed (even conflicting) focuses – see later discussion.\n\nThe relationship between ‘urban-ness’ and different domains of deprivation are considered in more detail later.\n\nIt is clear that, particularly outside the most deprived city areas, individual LSOAs are often mixed in their level of deprivation in different domains. For example many areas will be deprived in Barriers, Living Environment or Crime domains but not in Income or Employment (and vice versa). The IMD is obviously designed to pull together these differing facets of deprivation but when carrying out small area analysis it is often worth looking closely at what the domains, and even their sub-domains, tell you about different aspects of deprivation.\n\nThe analysis so far has been based on visual observation and is consequently rather subjective. The next section looks for more substantive evidence by considering the statistical distribution of the ranks and how the different regions fare on the individual IMD domains.\n\nRegional variations in deprivation by domain\n\nFigure 6.11 provides regional boxplots for the IMD and each of the domains.\n\nA box plot is a statistical graphic that provides a visual overview of a data distribution by showing the median, quartiles and spread for each area of interest. If you are unfamiliar with the use of boxplots see the Analysis and Guidance area of the Neighbourhood Statistics website, or Regional Trends 40 (Page 18) for advice.\n\nThe boxplot in the bottom left hand corner of the graphic, for example, shows the spread of results from the IMD for each region. Each of the nine bars shown represents the spread of ranks for an individual region. The box in the centre of each boxplot shows the middle two quartiles of the data – the 'inter-quartile range. The ‘whiskers’ that extend top and bottom show the full range of all ranks.Footnote 5\n\nThe thin black centre line running across each bar is the median value. This will differ slightly from the mean in some cases but has been chosen because it is less influenced by extreme outliers and is felt to be a better indication of the ‘middle’ of the range in this case.\n\nRanks range from 1 to 32,482 and the green line running across the centre of each boxplot indicates the middle of this range – our dividing line between more and less deprived LSOAs. Bars towards the top of the plot indicate that a region is less deprived than the national average while those at the bottom show that a region is more deprived.\n\nThe boxplot in the bottom left hand corner of the graphic is for the overall IMD ranks – and the regions are listed in order of declining median deprivation score – with the least deprived region (the South East) at the left hand side of the plot and the most deprived (the North East) at the right hand side. This same region order is used for all of the boxplots here but the ‘order’ of deprivation varies depending upon domain.\n\nConsidering first the plot for overall IMD and using the (dark green) inter-quartile boxes shown on the plot as an indicator of the distribution it is clear that there is considerable variation in the overall level of deprivation between regions.\n\nThe least deprived region here, the South East, has most of its inter-quartile range (shown by the dark green box) lying above the national mean, while the North East has almost all of its inter-quartile range lying below the mean. Other regions fall somewhere between these two and the order is interesting in its own right.\n\nPatterns are very similar for the Income, Employment and Health domains and the order of regions very similar. In the case of Employment and Health the disparity between the least and most deprived regions seems to become even more marked – and in the case of Health all of the inter-quartile range for the South East lies above average, while the North East lies wholly below the mean.\n\nThe one region that bucks this trend is London. It performs worst of all on Income and better than its overall IMD score might suggest on Employment and Health. Remember however, as mentioned before, that the income domain is driven by benefits rather than income itself.\n\nThe Education domain, again, provides a more mixed picture at the regional level. In this case London and the South West come to rival the South East at the less deprived end of the scale while West Midlands, East Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber and the North West are all relatively deprived – joining the North East at the bottom of the scale. The ‘remoteness’ element identified at the LSOA level does not seem to be significant enough to affect the results here – at least in part because most regions have some ‘remote’ areas.\n\nCrime shows equally mixed patterns. Yorkshire and The Humber, the North West and London are the most deprived while the South East, East of England and particularly the South West have the lowest levels of Crime deprivation. For once the North East is seen to be less deprived than the national average. The patterns here would seem to support the earlier supposition that crime deprivation spreads around cities. The most deprived regions here all have a large part of their populations living in or near major conurbations.\n\nThe Living Environment domain is even more mixed. The most deprived region in the IMD – the North East – is the least deprived in the Living Environment domain – 80 per cent of its LSOAs lie above average. The South East, the East of England and East Midlands also fare well on this domain. Most of the other regions lie around the national average – but London is hugely disadvantaged on this measure. London's whole inter-quartile range lies below the average.\n\nFinally the Barriers domain is the most mixed of all. East Midlands, Yorkshire and The Humber, the North West and the North East all do well while London, again, is very significantly the most deprived region. Regions with a large proportion of urban population would seem to be doing well – while the severe lack of affordable housing in London clearly pulls it back – 86 per cent of the LSOAs in London fall in the bottom half on this domain.\n\nThe next section of this analysis considers the relationship between the IMD domains and the National Statistics Area Classification. It attempts to answer the question: to what extent can the social characteristics of an area as summarised in the Area Classification explain and predict the different types of deprivation suffered in that area?\n\nNational Statistics 2001 Area Classification\n\nArea classifications provide a simple way of summarising the nature of different localities by grouping together areas of similar type and describing them according to their key characteristics. They can be useful in helping us focus on appropriate areas without being overwhelmed by a wide range of differences in the underlying data.\n\nThe National Statistics 2001 Area Classification of Super Output Areas and Data ZonesFootnote 6, which is freely available, is one such classification built from a range of 2001 Census data. Although the Area classification is based on data from 2001 and the ID07 on data from 2005 data the Classification still provides a useful way of answering the question ‘What type of area is this’?\n\nThe basic technique for creating the National Statistics Area Classification is known as cluster analysis, and is well established. The cluster analysis here takes a total of 43 variables derived from Census 2001 and using this data identifies, for each area, those other areas to which it is most statistically similar. Accordingly it generates a set of statistical ‘clusters’ and every LSOA is allocated to one of these. Labels attached to each grouping describe the key characteristics that make up that type of area. The clusters are themselves grouped into a three-tier hierarchy referred to as Super-groups, Groups and Sub-groups.\n\nThe ‘Super-group’ level of the classification at LSOA level is used here to examine how different types of areas perform on the IMD07 and its constituent domains. The Area Classification Super-groups (referred to from now on as ‘AC Groups’) are: Countryside, Disadvantaged Urban Communities, Miscellaneous Built up Areas, Multicultural City Life, Professional City Life, Urban Fringe, and White Collar Urban.boxed-text\n\nCensus data are used for denominators throughout the IMD and for the Area Classification– but this should not result in any unwanted effects in the comparison – in fact it should help in ensuring consistency of the results.\n\nFigure 6.12 includes a set of histograms which provide a detailed view of the relationship between Area Classification classes and the IMD domains.\n\nA careful study of the patterns here can reveal a huge amount of information and many of the subtleties of the complex relationship between IMD domains and Area Classification groups.boxed-text\n\nAnalysis using the NS Area Classification: a couple of caveats\n\nAs ever it is important to remember that deprived areas are not the same as deprived people. Areas described in the National Statistics Area Classification as, for example, ‘Professional City Life’ do not contain only professionals. The categorisation arises from areas with certain social or statistical characteristics – not from any direct assessment of the situation of individuals. There are a range of generalisations and categorisations going on here and it is important that any conclusions drawn are used with this in mind.\n\nEqually, it is important to note that the Area Classification used here has a direct (although relatively small) statistical relationship with the IMD. Three of the 38 indicators that make up the IMD are drawn directly from census variables – but only one of these (households with no central heating) contributed to the construction of the Area Classification. In this one case, however, exactly the same set of statistics is contributing to the clusters of the Area Classification and values the Living Environment domain. Combination with other variables in both cases, the process of cluster analysis in the Area Classification and standardisation and ranking of scores in the case of IMD means it is virtually impossible to identify exactly how strongly this relationship holds. It seems likely that the direct link is relatively minor but it is worth being aware of.\n\nInterpreting the histograms\n\nThe multiple histograms included in Figure 6.12 and 6.14 are initially daunting but repay the effort required to understand them.\n\nIn the case of Figure 6.12 a separate histogram is provided for each intersection of the Area Classification and the overall IMD and its domains. Each histogram shows the count of LSOAS broken down into the deciles (10 per cent groups) of deprivation ranks and so the profile of deprivation for that domain and that type of area. LSOAs ranked in the lower deciles (1st – 5th) could be said to be ‘more’ deprived, with LSOAs ranked in the upper deciles (6th – 10th) being ‘less’ deprived.\n\nTo further explain this consider the example which is an extract from the main diagram:illustration\n\nThese particular histograms show the profile of the Income deprivation domain for two of the AC Groups.\n\nA graph with a peak at the top (large ranks – so low deprivation) shows a relationship where areas of this type are generally less-deprived in this domain. Equally a peak at the bottom of the graph shows that areas of this type are largely more-deprived. Here we see that Multicultural City Life areas are highly deprived on the income domain (with 99 per cent of the LSOAs falling in the bottom half of the distribution) while White Collar Urban areas are much less deprived (with 72 per cent of the LSOAs falling in the top half).\n\nThe value of these multiple graphs is most clearly seen, however, by considering the whole graphic. Essentially each ‘column’ on the graphic shows the ‘profile’ of deprivation for those LSOAs which fall within a given Area Classification group. Each ‘row’ of graphs shows how deprivation of this type varies across the different area types. It is the intersection of these two sets of information, however, that provides most information. Patterns in the distributions provide clues about relationships and, sometimes subtle, differences in the shapes of the distributions reveal much more information than could be obtained from a set of correlations.\n\nNote that in order to ease comparison, as far as possible, common scales have been used for these graphs. The first two columns have a different scale from the rest of the graphs but in all cases graphs within a column have the same scale – so comparisons across the domains remain valid.\n\nFigure 6.14 considered later follows a very similar scheme showing the relationship between the IMD and the National Statistics Rural/Urban Area Classification.\n\nOverall relationship between area types and the IMD\n\nThe bottom row of charts on the page shows how individual groups fare in the overall IMD. What is immediately obvious is that there are strong patterns here. Some groups do well (they have lots of LSOAs in the higher deciles – at the top of the graph) while others do badly (their LSOAs tend to fall in the lower deciles – at the bottom of the graph).\n\nConsider first the Disadvantaged Urban Communities group – the graph in the extreme bottom left hand corner. Disadvantaged Urban Communities are the most deprived group overall with 72 per cent of its LSOAs falling in the bottom 20 per cent of the IMD. The Multicultural City Life group (see the third graph in this row) is also highly deprived according to the IMD with 62 per cent of its LSOAs in the bottom 20 per cent. What is most striking here is the strength of the relationship – there are virtually no LSOAs in either of these categories in the top half of the IMD (0.2 per cent and 4 per cent respectively). Very nearly every LSOA of these types is deprived.\n\nThe pattern for Urban Fringe is equally strong, but in the opposite direction – only 2 per cent of Urban Fringe LSOAs are in the bottom half of the IMD ranks. Urban Fringe LSOAs, a largely ‘suburban’ group, are by far the least deprived group overall\n\nOther groups of the Area Classification show less extreme patterns – with most LSOAs falling somewhere in the middle of the IMD ranks. Professional City Life and Miscellaneous Built-up Areas are marginally worse off than White Collar Urban and Countryside areas which have very similar broadly ‘less-deprived’ profiles. The White Collar Urban group also tends to occur on the edge of cities.\n\nNote that the ‘thinner’ graph for Professional City Life is the result of the smaller number of areas categorised in this group – remember that these graphs show counts of LSOAs and that the graphs have (two) common scales.\n\nThis initial inspection suggests that the AC Groups have a strong relationship to the IMD. Disadvantaged Urban Communities and Multicultural City Life areas are almost universally highly deprived while Urban Fringe areas are almost never deprived. Other groups fall somewhere in-between.\n\nClearly the (social) type of area you live in is a strong predictor for how deprived your area is going to be – particularly at the extremes. At first this finding seems obvious and rather facile – but a closer inspection shows such a link is, at least statistically, not inevitable. The Area Classification is built around the social characteristics of areas at Census time 2001. The Indices of Deprivation are largely built around much more recent outcomes – school results, benefits and levels of crime etc. Although there are a few direct statistical links and there will be some clear correlations between related variables the Area Classification and IMD are measuring distinctly different dimensions of the characteristics of areas – so the strength of relationships evident here are valid and interesting.\n\nRelationship between area types and the individual domains\n\nThe next step is to look at the individual domains of the IMD and how they relate to the AC Groups.\n\nWhat is immediately striking here is that the bottom three domain rows (Income, Employment & Health) are remarkably similar and an almost perfect reflection of the IMD results. This helps confirm the evidence of the similarity of these domains shown on the maps and boxplots included earlier in this article. To some extent this similarity is because these domains are the most highly weighted in the IMD but it is also because these domains are highly correlated with each other.\n\nThe other domains of the IoD are less predictable.\n\nEducation is similar to the IMD and the domains already discussed but Disadvantaged Urban Communities strongly dominate the poorly performing areas. This group which consists of two sub-groups – ‘struggling urban families’ and ‘blue collar urban families’ – makes up 16 per cent of the UK population but accounts for 78 percent of the LSOAs falling in the most deprived decile (10 per cent) on Education. Conversely the other badly deprived group Multicultural City Life, whose definition includes a very significant ethnic population, is much more deprived on Income than any other group, but does relatively well on Education. The most interesting group on Education however is the Professional City Life group. These areas perform extremely well on education – this running against their results on the IMD where they are distinctly middling.\n\nCrime shows a similar pattern to the other IMD domains but the differences and contrasts between areas are less marked. Perhaps this is a mirror to the map we looked at earlier. Crime is a problem in the city – but extends beyond it into the suburbs. The strongest pattern here is in the Countryside group which shows very little Crime deprivation. Some 58 per cent of Countryside LSOAs are in the top 20 per cent least deprived in the IMD.\n\nLiving Environment and Barriers, the final two domains, provide mixed patterns on the graphs just as they did on the maps.\n\nThe ‘most deprived’ group Disadvantaged Urban Communities is not particularly deprived on either of these domains whereas Multicultural City Life areas and Professional City Life are. This latter group is relatively well educated – but (like the Multicultural group) they live in city centres where the Living Environment and Barriers domains fare badly. The largest proportion of this group are also in London, Birmingham and Manchester where housing affordability (part of the Barriers domain) will also be a problem.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Countryside does not rank particularly well on the Living Environment domain – faring worse than White Collar Urban and Urban Fringe areas. This seems counter intuitive; rural areas would usually be considered to have a good environment, green space and good air quality. This apparent anomaly however arises from the definition of ‘Living Environment’. As well as air quality and road traffic accidents this domain includes measures of housing stock quality and central heating. It is likely that these elements are complicating the picture for Countryside areas (and incidentally improving the performance Disadvantaged Urban Communities) on this domain.\n\nMost striking in these last two domains, however, is the very poor performance of Countryside areas on the Barriers domain – this is the only domain on which the Countryside group does badly. This will be largely the result of the inclusion of the access to services in Barriers but the affordability of housing may also be playing a role. Miscellaneous Built-up areas and White Collar Urban do best on this domain. These groups are often located on the edge of urban areas – in less expensive housing but with reasonable access to services.\n\nIt is also possible to look at this graphic using the opposite dimension – the profile of each IoD domain across each area type – and readers may wish to look at this. Only the most obvious patterns are described here and you are likely to be able to spot more subtle differences and relationships throughout the diagram. It is the ability to pick out such subtleties that makes this type of graphic useful for summarising and analysing this type of complex, cross-domain relationships.\n\nSome conclusions will be drawn from this analysis later – after looking at the IMD from another dimension – its relationship with Urban and Rural areas.\n\nWith a basic understanding of the Rural Urban Classification it is possible now to look in more detail at its relationship to the IMD. The method used here is exactly the same graphical one used earlier with the Area Classification.\n\nFigure 6.14 shows the relationship between the RU Classification and the IMD and its domains.\n\nSee the box before Figure 6.12 for guidance on how to interpret this graphic.\n\nThis time the ‘columns’ show how each area type fares on the different IMD domains. The ‘rows’ show the profile of deprivation for each IMD domain across the different types of area.\n\nUnfortunately, because the numbers of LSOAs falling into each area type vary so much, it has not been possible to keep the scales consistent across the graphs this time. The scales have, however, been kept consistent within each column – so comparison is valid.\n\nAs noted before the ‘sparse’ groups are extremely rare so they have been grouped together at the right hand side of the diagram – the lighter coloured columns. The small numbers involved mean it is important to take some care in interpreting these particular graphs. Their relative ‘roughness’ in some cases is the result of natural variation within small numbers which is smoothed out in the ‘less-sparse’ graphs. The broad pattern the sparse graphs show will be broadly representative – but it is important not to read too much into small variations in the detail.\n\nWith these caveats in mind it is possible to start to look at what the RU Classification tells us about deprivation.\n\nRelationship with the overall IMD\n\nFocussing first on the IMD as a whole (and the first three columns) the patterns seem to bear out our earlier findings. Urban areas are broadly deprived – but show a significant mix of levels of deprivation. Notice that the IMD ‘kicks-out’ a little in the top decile (as a result of similar patterns in all of the bottom 4 domains). The urban areas contain a small but significant set of LSOAs which are not at all deprived. To some extent this may reflect the common observation of relatively affluent areas in many city centres. Remember however that the RU classification definition of Urban is also a very broad one, containing more than 80 per cent of the population. Map 6.13 shows how far the major conurbations spread out into their ‘suburbs’ – and so into less deprived or mixed areas – perhaps picking up some of these affluent areas here. Urban areas tend to be deprived, but not universally so.\n\nTown and Fringe – which are largely sub-urban and ‘market town’ areas – do very well and are largely less deprived; 76 per cent of this group fall into the top half of the graph. Village, Hamlet and Isolated Dwellings are broadly non-deprived and have virtually no LSOAs in the most deprived two deciles. They do not, however, do quite as well as the Town and Fringe group at the very top of the distribution. They actually have a lower proportion in the top decile than either of the other two area types.\n\nA look at the ‘sparse’ groups on the IMD shows a radical difference – all of these groups show a tendency to be mildly deprived. They have very few of the most deprived LSOAs but equally they are unlikely to have many areas in the least deprived.\n\nIf anything the urban areas do worst of the three remote (sparse) groups – but as noted before the numbers are too small here to place too much trust in these patterns.\n\nThe broad message does seem to be clear however. If you are remote it doesn't matter what type of urban or rural area you are in – you are more likely to be in a deprived area.\n\nRelationship with the individual domains of the IMD\n\nConsidering first the ‘Less-Sparse’ groups the usual patterns are obvious. Income, Employment, Health and Education domains show strong parallels with the IMD – though there are some differences.\n\nTown and Fringe does well again on all of these domains – but rather less well in these domains than in the IMD. Further up the graphic we can see that it is getting its very good IMD results from very low deprivation on the Crime, Environment and Barriers domains rather than from these lower ones. Equally the ‘Villages’ group does better on Employment and Health than the overall IMD would suggest– this time the IMD is being pulled down by poor showings on Environment and, particularly, Barriers.\n\nA quick look at the Sparse areas for these lower 4 domains shows a repeat of what we saw on the IMD. In every single case the profiles are worse in Sparse areas than in the respective Less Sparse areas. Again the remote areas are more deprived.\n\nCrime is different. As we saw before Crime clearly has a strong Urban/Rural dimension. This is the domain where Urban areas do worst of all – and ‘Villages’ best of all. In this case the Sparse (remote) areas do better than their respective Less Sparse areas. As the maps suggested earlier – the more remote the better when it comes to avoiding crime deprivation.\n\nAs ever the Living Environment and Barriers domains produce mixed, and sometimes conflicting, results. Urban areas have mixed results on both domains, Town and Fringe do fairly well on Barriers – and extremely well on Living Environment (its best result). The ‘Village’ group is particularly interesting on Environment – a distinctly middling result and a poor one compared to its results on most other domains. It seems likely that this reflects poor results on the indoors (housing and central heating) indicators balancing out good results on the outdoors (air quality and traffic). Equally ‘Villages’ produces the predictable very highly deprived performance on the Barriers domain – pulled down by poor scores on access to services. Note that results for Sparse Villages are predictably more extreme still.\n\nAs we have seen in the earlier discussion Barriers in particular seems to produce results that run contrary to the scores on the other domains.\n\nIn the case of ‘Village’ areas– the very poor showing on Barriers is mirrored by a very good showing on Crime. Further inspection of the data shows that the extreme values in both cases are in roughly the same areas so these results largely cancel each other out in the IMD (since their weightings are the same).\n\nThis does not, however, mean that there is any flaw in the logic of the IMD. It is actually only in the more rural areas that this cancelling out occurs. This confirms the common observation that there are up-sides and down-sides to living in rural areas. Whether an individual living in a remote rural LSOA actually considers their location to be deprived due to such factors requires a more subjective interpretation. Some people relocate to rural areas precisely because such areas are isolated, and do not consider such geographical barriers to have a negative impact upon their daily lives.\n\nAgain this has been only a summary analysis – the reader may want to study these graphs further and look for the more subtle patterns.\n\nUsing the IMD for small area analysis.\n\nThe first conclusion to be drawn here is that in order to get any real understanding of spatial patterns of deprivation it is important to use data at as low a level as possible – and this means at the LSOA level. Using district level summary measures for either the IMD or Area Classification would largely mask some of the subtle effects identified here.\n\nThese studies have also shown that different types of areas perform very differently on individual domains. What is very obvious, however, is that in carrying out any type of analysis the user needs to be very aware of the complexity and summary nature of the IMD measure. Often consideration of the individual domains or even sub-domains will offer more insight than just using the IMD. Equally it is important that users are aware of some of the sometimes conflicting characteristics of the different domains.\n\nThe influence of the Crime, Environment and Barriers domains do complicate the picture – but notice that they do this in a very specific way – relating strongly to the rural-ness of the area. The Barriers domain which is frequently dominated by accessibility does often run counter to the results in the other domains but this does not make its contribution to the IMD wrong or unnecessary. The inclusion of some element of accessibility in the IMD does seem entirely appropriate – it just happens to be important in areas which are otherwise relatively less deprived.\n\nIt is of course possible to argue with individual elements of the IMD or to take different views of what the relative weightings should be. Some of the domains contain apparently conflicting pulls on the scores. Again however this is not evidence that there is a weakness in the logic of the measure. Different areas do suffer different types of deprivation. We just need to be aware of these in drawing conclusions.\n\nIt is fairly obvious that this is a difficult area and that assessment of multiple deprivation is inevitably partially subjective. This study has not looked to test the validity or otherwise of the IMD as a measure. What is has shown however is that the IMD as currently formed reveals strong and apparently consistent relationships between location, area type and deprivation.\n\nThis does not, in itself, validate the success or otherwise of the IMD in identifying deprived areas but it does at least show that it is a consistent measure.\n\nThe influence of ‘place’ on deprivation\n\nThis article has done much to confirm observations that may seem obvious – but it has also uncovered some subtleties in the relationship between the domains of deprivation and different types of places.\n\nIt has proved that the domains of the IMD have very distinct and, in some cases, quite different patterns. It is impossible to prove any causal relationship with this type of analysis but the strength of the patterns revealed on the graphs clearly shows that different types of places do suffer very different fates in terms of deprivation.\n\nThe indication is that geographical ‘extremes’ help contribute to deprivation – cities and remote areas are most likely to be deprived – though their deprivation will often be driven by very different factors.\n\nThroughout all of these brief studies we have seen the same areas performing best – the ‘Town and Fringe’ in the Rural Urban Classification; the ‘Urban Fringe’ in the Area Classification; the suburban areas to the main cities on the maps. The next most suburban of the Area Classification groups, White Collar Urban, also does well. All of the evidence here suggests that areas near the city – but not in it – are almost always the least deprived.\n\nThe study has also confirmed what one would expect – that Urban areas tend to be the most deprived – but also that the pattern here is far from universal. Urban areas can also be relatively very well-off particularly on specific domains and for specific groups. The broad definition of ‘Urban’ used here tends to cover a wide range of types of areas and it may be appropriate to use the Area Classification to supplement any analysis of differences within the urban areas.\n\nRural areas perform relatively well on all measures (except Barriers) and do particularly well on Crime but they do not perform as well as suburban areas. The most remote areas fare much worse – often displaying some of the highest levels of deprivation.\n\nThis article has revealed a number of ways in which place influences deprivation and shown that deprivation is driven by a complex, sometimes conflicting, set of factors.\n\nWhile these factors lead to subtle variations in different domains and in different types of areas one overall pattern emerges. Geographic extremes – the inner city and the most remote rural areas – coincide with extremes of deprivation while suburban and ‘middle-England’ almost entirely escape them.Footnote 9"
