        "text": "EASTERN CAPE\n\nCape St Francis Jeffreys Bay Port Elizabeth Grahamstown East London Port Alfred\n\nEastern Cape Accommodation for Eastern Cape Businesses, Eastern Cape History and Eastern Cape interesting Information about Cape St Francis, East London, Jeffreys Bay, Grahamstown, Port Elizabeth and Port Alfred\n\nThe Eastern Cape is a province of South Africa. Its capital is Bhisho.\n\nIt was formed in 1994 out of the \"independent\" homelands of Transkei and Ciskei, as well as the eastern portion of the Cape Province. Landing place and home of the 1820 settlers. It is partly the traditional home of the Xhosa, and the birthplace of many prominent South Africans, such as Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki, Steve Biko and Charles Coghlan.\n\nThe landscape is extremely diverse. The western interior is largely arid Karoo, while the east is well-watered and green.\n\nThe Eastern Cape offers a wide array of attractions, including 800 km of untouched and pristine coastline along with some particularly splendid beaches, and \"big-five\" viewing in a malaria-free environment.\n\nThe Addo Elephant National Park, situated 73 km from Port Elizabeth, was proclaimed in 1931. It offers sanctuary to 170 elephants, the last Cape buffalo and 21 black rhino of the very scarce Kenyan sub-species.\n\nSouth Africa's only ski resort, Tiffindell, which is situated near the hamlet of Rhodes in the Southern Drakensberg on the slopes of the highest mountain peak in the Eastern Cape (3001 m).\n\nThe National Arts Festival, held in Grahamstown is Africa's largest and most colourful cultural event, offering a choice of the very best of both indigenous and imported talent. Every year for 11 days the town's population almost doubles, as over 50,000 people flock to the region for a feast of arts, crafts and sheer entertainment.\n\nThe Tsitsikamma National Park is an 80 km long coastal strip between Nature's Valley and the mouth of the Storms River.\n\nIn the park the visitor finds an almost untouched natural landscape. Near the park is the Bloukrans Bridge, which is the world's highest bungee jump.\n\nJeffreys Bay is an area with some of the country's wildest coastline, which is backed by some of Africa's most spectacular sub-tropical rainforest. Famous for its \"supertubes\", probably South Africa's longest and most consistently good wave, it's charged with a surf vibe as relaxed as it is friendly, and this tends to soften the effect of the wealthy set who have made this part of the coast their own.\n\nAliwal North, lying on a splendid agricultural plateau on the southern bank of the Orange River, is one of the country's most popular inland resorts and is famous for its hot springs. The rugged and unspoilt Wild Coast is a place of spectacular scenery, and a graveyard for many vessels."
