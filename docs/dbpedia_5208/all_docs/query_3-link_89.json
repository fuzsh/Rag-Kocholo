        "text": "The San Francisco Declaration (DORA) aims to reform the way academic research quality is assessed and measured. UCL is committed to principles of DORA and working with partners to implement them.\n\nWhat is the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment?\n\nIn 2015, UCL signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) on research assessment; which acknowledges weaknesses in the use of the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) as a measure of quality, since this measure relates to journals as a whole and not to individual articles. Recognising that research results in outputs other than journal articles, DORA also attempts to identify new routes to research evaluation.\n\n> The San Francisco Declaration\n\nCommitments of DORA\n\nUniversities who sign DORA should:\n\nbe explicit about the criteria used to reach hiring, tenure and promotion decisions, clearly highlighting, especially for early-stage investigators, that the scientific content of a paper is much more important than publication metrics or the identity of the journal in which it was published\n\nfor the purposes of research assessment, consider the value and impact of all research outputs (including datasets and software) in addition to research publications, and consider a broad range of impact measures including qualitative indicators of research impact, such as influence on policy and practice.\n\nResearchers should:\n\nmake assessments based on scientific content rather than publication metrics, when involved in committees making decisions about funding, hiring, tenure, or promotion\n\nwherever appropriate, cite primary literature in which observations are first reported rather than reviews in order to give credit where credit is due\n\nuse a range of article metrics and indicators on personal/supporting statements, as evidence of the impact of individual published articles and other research outputs\n\nchallenge research assessment practices that rely inappropriately on JIF, and promote and teach best practice that focuses on the value and influence of specific research outputs.\n\nImplementation and monitoring of DORA at UCL\n\nIn 2021, UCL remains committed to these principles and to working with the Wellcome Trust to implement them. In line with the Wellcome declaration on DORA, UCL affirms that it is committed to implementing the principles to which it has signed up.\n\n> Wellcome’s commitment to DORA\n\nPolicy and Practice\n\nUCL has a clear plan for developing policy and practice in this area. It has already delivered a Bibliometrics policy which was signed off by UCL Academic Committee in Spring 2020, which is fully aligned with DORA and the Leiden Manifesto and which has been hailed as ‘sector leading’. UCL has also developed an Academic Careers Framework, which is fully aligned with Open Science practices. It has made Open Access to research outputs mandatory for all UCL researchers from Grade 7 to Grade 10.\n\n> UCL Bibliometrics Policy\n\n> Leiden Manifesto\n\n> UCL Academic Careers Framework\n\nOpen Science\n\nUCL also holds frequent Open Science meetings and webinars, where the implications of implementing DORA are assessed and shared with the UCL community. There is also an Open Science blog and a large collection of relevant materials on the UCL Open Science website.\n\n> Open Science Blog\n\n> UCL Office for Open Science and Scholarship\n\nTraining\n\nOnline training on Next Generation Metrics is available and DORA features in regular pan-UCL induction sessions for researchers new to UCL. UCL has also created an Open Science video introduction entitled Open Science and Scholarship as part of UCL Research Culture\n\nSteering Group"
