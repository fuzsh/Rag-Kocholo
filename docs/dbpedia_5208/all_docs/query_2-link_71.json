        "text": "Municipalities\n\nEastern Cape\n\nBuffalo City Metropolitan Municipality\n\nBuffalo City Metropolitan Municipality (BUF)\n\nGeography, History & Economy\n\nMDB code: BUF\n\nDescription: The Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality is a Category A municipality situated on the east coast of the Eastern Cape Province. The boundaries of the newly established municipality now include a large area characterised by very different features. Two former municipalities, Transitional Local Councils – that of East London and King William's Town – have merged into one. Other areas that were previously not included in either of them are now part of Buffalo City.\n\nThe municipality was established as a local municipality in 2000 after South Africa's reorganisation of municipal areas and is named after the Buffalo River, at whose mouth lies the only river port in South Africa. On 18 May 2011 it was separated from the Amathole District Municipality and converted into a metropolitan municipality. History was made in Buffalo City when the City elected its first female mayor on Friday, 17 March 2006.\n\nThe area has a well-developed manufacturing base, with the auto industry playing a major role. The climate is mild, with year-round sunshine. Average rainfall is 850mm.\n\nArea: 2 753km²\n\nCities/Towns: Beacon Bay, Berlin, Bisho, Breidbach, Dimbaza, East London, Kidd's Beach, King William's Town, Mdantsane, Phakamisa, Potsdam, Zwelitsha\n\nMain Economic Sectors: Community services (25%), finance (24%), manufacturing (24%), trade (12%), transport (12%)"
