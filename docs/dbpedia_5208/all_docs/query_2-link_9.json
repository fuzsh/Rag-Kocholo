        "text": "East London\n\nGeography and History\n\nEast London on the East coast of South Africa is affectionately called Buffalo City. Situated 1000 kilometres from Cape Town, between the Nahoon River in the North and the Buffalo river to the South, East London is the only river port in South Africa. The shores are lapped by the warm waters of the Indian Ocean and with its sub-tropical climate is a sought after tourist destination for local South Africans and international tourist alike.\n\nEast London is at the northern end of a 300 km stretch of coastline referred to as the \"Sunshine Coast\" which has St Francis Bay at the Southern end. The Sunshine Coast is renowned for its stretches of beautiful unpolluted and un-crowded beaches.\n\nActivities\n\nNahoon Beach, Gonubie Beach and Orient Beach are extremely popular, as they offer clean sand, sparkling waters and beautiful sunsets. The fact that they are not overpopulated seems to lure many visitors to enjoy the many water sport activities such as surfing, dolphin and whale watching, scuba diving, sail boating, water skiing and fishing.\n\nAdventure activities include hiking, horse riding and cycling.\n\nGame reserves are plentiful and visitors can get up close and personal with their favourite African animals at nearby game reserves such as Camdeboo National Park, Mpgongo Private Game Reserve, Inkwenkwesi Private Game Reserve and Mountain Zebra National Park.\n\nEast London also has a wonderful miniature game reserve that is home to animals such as crocodile, tigers, lions, zebra and a large variety of birds.\n\nThe East London Aquarium and the East London Museum are another two attractions that should not be missed out on.\n\nAccommodation\n\nAccommodation includes Hotels and many Bed and Breakfast and Self-Catering establishments where you will find great service and true South African hospitality.\n\nPhotos courtesy of East London Tourism & Wikipedia\n\nEast Londoners are very laid back and will welcome you with open arms!.\n\nLatest Listings - View All"
