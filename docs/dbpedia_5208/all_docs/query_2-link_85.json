        "text": "The Eastern Cape Development Corporation (ECDC) is a dynamic economic development agency in the Eastern Cape.\n\nECDC works with provincial and national ministries, municipalities, chambers, private business, communities and other development agencies to implement the economic development policies of the Eastern Cape provincial government.\n\nECDC reports to an independent Board of Directors representing all stakeholders in the Eastern Cape. The directors are appointed by the Department of Economic Affairs, Environment and Tourism.\n\nECDC was formed in 1996 by an Act of the Eastern Cape Legislature to plan, finance, co-ordinate, market, promote and implement the development of the Eastern Cape Province and all its people in the fields of industry, commerce, agriculture, transport and finance.\n\nECDC is the official economic development and investment agency for the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. It is wholly-owned by the Eastern Cape Government.\n\nOur work is closely aligned with the strategic intent of the Provincial Development Plan (PDP), the Eastern Cape’s official roadmap to a prosperous future for all its people, as well as broader national and local policy interventions designed to deliver growth, employment and reduce the levels of poverty in the country.\n\nECDC’s head office is in East London, which is centrally situated in the province.\n\nWe reach throughout the Eastern Cape via a network of regional offices in Port Elizabeth, King William’s Town, Komani (Queenstown) and Mthatha, with satellite offices in Aliwal North and Butterworth.\n\nThe Eastern Cape, a province of vast potential and world-class industrial sectors, is working steadily to overcome the severe underdevelopment it inherited from apartheid, particularly in its large rural areas."
