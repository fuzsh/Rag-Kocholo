        "text": "In 1938, Mrs. E. B. Ntsonkota of East London, South Africa, appeared in a testimonial advertisement for Ambrosia Tea in the bilingual Xhosa-English newspaper Umlindi we Nyanga (The Monthly Watchman). The advertisement occupied half a page, and featured a full-length photograph of Mrs. Ntsonkota. ‘One cannot help being a loyal user of Ambrosia Tea’, she was quoted as saying; ‘As a Headman's wife I have introduced its use to a lot of friends’.Footnote 1 Mrs. Ntsonkota's testimonial was part of an advertising campaign that highlighted African women customers through write-in competitions and testimonials.Footnote 2 In all, Ambrosia published the names and addresses of 36 different women between 1938 and early 1941, when Umlindi closed because of wartime shortages. Six women's photographs appeared in eighteen of these advertisements, and a few of the testimonials included lengthy statements by the writers. These advertisements offer an opportunity to examine the making of a literate, aspiring middle-class feminine African consumer culture in early twentieth century South Africa.\n\nThe Ambrosia campaign shows how a white-owned business worked to build an African market in South Africa's rural eastern Cape region during the 1930s, a time when both consumer goods and consumer culture were changing. The owners of Ambrosia and the editor of Umlindi we Nyanga used the format of the testimonial to portray rural, literate, African women as ideal consumers. In doing this, the advertiser, newspaper editor, and testimonial writers all tapped into local meanings of tea consumption and ongoing debates about modernity, femininity, and respectability. Ambrosia tried to attract customers by cultivating a participatory, feminine reading public centered on the consumption of goods that were ‘wise’ and ‘intelligent’. At the same time, two Ambrosia spokeswomen used the format of the testimonial to promote their newly founded home improvement societies, and to offer their own analysis of rural women's duties as leaders of the home and of the nation.\n\nHistorians have effectively dismantled the image of African consumers as naïve buyers of ‘trinkets’ or ‘truck’, either during the era of the slave trade or in the era of mass-produced consumer goods.Footnote 3 Scholars have been particularly interested in consumers’ creativity in the realm of clothing and fashion. By ‘dressing up’, people changed the meanings of garments and challenged social hierarchies.Footnote 4 Even products less pliable than fabric, and with an apparently fixed branded meaning, have been used by buyers for various purposes.Footnote 5 New histories of consumer culture in Africa are thus attentive to the social context of consumption; that is, the relationships within which consumer desires and choices are embedded.Footnote 6\n\nTherefore, histories of consumption in Africa must attend not only to what people bought in stores and how they used those items, but also to the media in which those goods were marketed, because local tastes also influenced advertising.Footnote 7 Histories of marketing in Africa have examined corporations’ attempts to get ‘inside the skin’ of the Black consumer in the 1950s and later.Footnote 8 Ambrosia's advertising campaign in Umlindi we Nyanga shows how, as early as the 1930s, a white-owned company crafted a successful marketing campaign based on their perception of the existence of a rural, educated, literate, feminine African customer market.\n\nIn South Africa, the extensive archive of the Black press has sustained a long scholarly discussion of power, representation, and race. In the nineteenth century African intellectuals founded independent newspapers in indigenous languages, but by the 1930s most had been bought out by white business interests, which saw the newspapers as a way to grow the Black consumer market.Footnote 9 For a long time, scholarly discussion of this ‘captive black commercial press’ centered on its political content, and the extent to which white-owned newspapers could be vehicles of resistance.Footnote 10 More recent scholarship on newspapers in colonial and postcolonial Africa emphasizes the creative, participatory relationship between readers and writers.Footnote 11 The South African vein of this scholarship has demonstrated that newspapers hosted complex cultural and political debates among Black readers.Footnote 12 This understanding of newspaper culture depends, as Natasha Erlank has argued, on reading the ‘form’ of the newspaper, attending to the relationship between all parts of the newspaper and not only the political columns.Footnote 13 In the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Black press, advertisements were not completely distinct from editorial or news content.Footnote 14 One scholar argues that Bantu World's advertisements ‘activated the dual construction of readers and consumers’.Footnote 15 Lynn Thomas's work on Bantu World shows how men and women in the 1930s debated standards of beauty, the use of advertised cosmetics, and their relationship to racial respectability.Footnote 16 Readers of the Black commercial press were participants in complex discussions of the moral and financial values of the products advertised to them."
