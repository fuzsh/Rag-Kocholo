        "text": "The Eastern Cape, at 168 966 km2 , is South Africa’s second largest province after the Northern Cape. The Eastern Cape takes up 13,9% of the total land area of South Africa. The province has a population of more than 6,5 million people. The majority of whom speak isiXhosa, followed by Afrikaans and English. It is a region of great natural beauty, particularly the rugged cliffs, rough seas and dense green bush of the Wild Coast. The region has remarkable natural diversity, ranging from the dry, desolate Great Karoo to the lush forests of the Wild Coast as well as the Keiskamma Valley; the fertile Langkloof Valley, renowned for its rich apple harvests; and the mountainous southern Drakensberg region at Elliot. Various floral habitats meet in the province, ranging from tropical forests in the north to the more temperate woods of the south. The Eastern Cape is one of the poorest provinces in South Africa. This is largely due to the poverty found in the former homelands, where subsistence agriculture predominates.\n\nThe province is home to a number of higher education institutions. These including Rhodes University, the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, the University of Fort Hare as well as the Walter Sisulu University of Technology. It has airports in Bhisho, East London, Mthatha and Port Elizabeth. It also has two major harbours in East London and Port Elizabeth respectively.\n\nThe Eastern Cape offers a wide array of attractions, including 800 km of untouched and pristine coastline along with some particularly splendid beaches, and “big-five” viewing in a malaria-free environment.\n\nVisit the Eastern Cape Tourism page for information on what the Eastern Cape has to offer.\n\nThe coastal area of the Eastern Cape Province lies directly between subtropical KwaZulu Natal and the Mediterranean Western Cape. Its inland area is bisected by the great escarpment, and the northern areas have lofty plains of the Plateau and the Great Karoo. These topographical differences are what cause the climatic differences and conditions experienced by the various towns and cities.\n\nIn the North East along the Wild Coast, towns like Port St Johns experience long, hot, balmy conditions and high rainfall, while Graaff Reinet, in the heart of the Karoo Heartland, experiences long hot summer months and moderate winters. Up towards the Free State (at towns such as Lady Grey and Aliwal North) the rise in altitude means the appropriate lowering in temperature and sometimes snow.\n\nAdded to the diverse coastal experiences are more than 60 state-owned game reserves and over 30 private game farms, which collectively cover an area greater than the Kruger National Park.\n\nEastern Cape Agriculture, fisheries and forestry\n\nThe fertile Langkloof Valley in the south-west has enormous deciduous fruit orchards, while sheep farming predominates in the Karoo. The Alexandria-Grahamstown area produces pineapples, chicory and dairy products, while coffee and tea are cultivated at Magwa. An olive nursery has been developed in collaboration with the University of Fort Hare to form a nucleus of olive production in the Eastern Cape. The coastal areas receive good summer rainfall and have a moderate climate, becoming more subtropical to the north-west. This, therefore, makes it particularly suitable for forestry. The basis of the province’s fishing industry is the squid. This also includes some recreational and commercial fishing for line fish, the collection of marine resources, and access to line-catches of hake.\n\nEastern Cape Industry\n\nThere are two industrial development zones. The West Bank in East London as well as Coega, near Port Elizabeth, which includes the deepwater Port of Ngqura. The metropolitan economies of Port Elizabeth and East London are based primarily on manufacturing, the most important being automotive manufacturing. The province is also the hub of South Africa’s motor industry. With its ability to link throughout the economy, the government has therefore identified the automotive industry as a key growth sector. It already exhibited significant growth under the Motor Industry Development Programme. Other important sectors include renewables and green industries, forestry and timber processessing, pharmaceuticals, plastics and chemicals, capital goods and tourism. The two major industrial centres, Port Elizabeth and East London have well-developed economies based on the automotive industry. General Motors and Volkswagen both have major assembly lines in the Port Elizabeth area, while East London is dominated by the large Daimler Chrysler plant, now known as Mercedes-Benz South Africa.\n\nMajor Metropolitan Municipalities\n\nBuffalo City Metropolitan Municipality (BUF)\n\nDescription: The Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality is a Category A municipality situated on the east coast of the Eastern Cape Province. The boundaries of the newly established municipality now include a large area characterised by very different features. Two former municipalities, Transitional Local Councils – that of East London and King William’s Town – have merged into one. Other areas that were previously not included in either of them are now part of Buffalo City.\n\nThe municipality was established as a local municipality in 2000 after South Africa’s reorganisation of municipal areas and is named after the Buffalo River, at whose mouth lies the only river port in South Africa. On 18 May 2011, it was separated from the Amathole District Municipality and converted into a metropolitan municipality. History was made in Buffalo City when the City elected its first female mayor on Friday, 17 March 2006.\n\nThe area has a well-developed manufacturing base, with the auto industry playing a major role. The climate is mild, with year-round sunshine. Average rainfall is 850mm.\n\nArea: 2 750km²\n\nCities/Towns: Beacon Bay, Berlin, Bisho, Breidbach, Dimbaza, East London, Kidd’s Beach, King William’s Town, Mdantsane, Phakamisa, Potsdam, Zwelitsha\n\nNelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality (NMA)\n\nDescription: The Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality is a Category A municipality, established on 5 December 2000. Nelson Mandela Bay was the first city in South Africa to establish a fully integrated democratic local authority and the only city in the world named after Nelson Mandela, who was born and spent his formative years in the Eastern Cape.\n\nNelson Mandela Bay is a major seaport and automotive manufacturing centre located on the south-eastern coast of Africa. It is the economic powerhouse of the Eastern Cape Province and one of eight metropolitan areas in South Africa. Its boundaries are formed by Cassie Mountain View in the north, Cape Recife in the south, Sundays River Mouth in the east, and Van Stadens River Mouth in the west.\n\nThe city is a holiday hot spot for both national and international tourists. The predominant languages spoken are English, Afrikaans and isiXhosa.\n\nArea: 1 957km²\n\nCities/Towns: Bethelsdorp, Bloemendal, Blue Horizon Bay, Clarendon Marine, Despatch, KwaNobuhle, Motherwell, Port Elizabeth, Summerstrand, Swartkops, Uitenhage\n\nMain Economic Sectors: Manufacturing (25%), community services (23%), finance (23%), trade (13%), transport (13%)\n\nHome of Legends\n\nCultural melting pot and birthplace of iconic world leader, Nelson Mandela, the rich heritage and diversity of the Eastern Cape with its people, sights and sounds are interwoven into the tapestry of what makes this region so unique. Become encapsulated in the history of a proud region and its people.\n\nNELSON MANDELA\n\nBorn 18 July 1918 in the village Quna, Eastern Cape\n\n“No one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin, his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.” Nelson Mandela\n\n– Long Walk to Freedom (1995)\n\nIn a country ruled by racial oppression for a number of years, Nelson Mandela became a world icon for peace when he became the first black president of South African in 1994. Held with deep respect throughout South Africa and the world, Mandela is fondly known as the ‘Father of the Nation’ and received numerous awards for his stance against the Apartheid regime and its abuses.\n\nMandela stayed in office from 1994 to 1999 during which time his government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid through tackling institutionalised racism, poverty, inequality and fostering racial reconciliation.\n\nAs an African Nationalist, Mandela held other political positions including President of the African National Congress (ANC) from 1991 to 1997, and the Secretary-General position of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. During his term as President of South Africa, Mandela established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate abuse during the Apartheid years.\n\nMandela is Xhosa born and attended the University of Fort Hare in the Eastern Cape as well as the University of Witwatersrand in Gauteng. At these universities he studied law and later became involved in anti-colonial politics, resulting in his joining the African National Congress. As a founding member of the ANC Youth League, Mandela rose to prominence in 1952 in the Defiance Campaign and oversaw the 1955 Congress of the People. Mandela later served 27 years in prison for conspiracy to overthrow the government. Mandela spent most of his sentence in the now famous Robin Island, off the coast of Cape Town. Lobbying through an international campaign led to his release in 1990.\n\nMandela has received over 250 awards including a Nobel Peace Prize, the US Presidential Medal of Freedom as well as the Soviet Order of Lenin.\n\nBig 7\n\nCome face to face with the Big Seven in the Eastern Cape and experience Africa’s greatest animals on land and sea.
