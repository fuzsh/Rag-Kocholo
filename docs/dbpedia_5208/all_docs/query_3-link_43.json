        "text": "Global: In the first half of 2024, while the value of M&A deals rose by 5% compared to the first half of 2023, overall transaction volume fell by 25%, continuing a downward trend that started in 2022. In the first half of 2024, deal volumes were just over 23,000 and deal values reached $1.3tn. This is a far cry from the record levels of activity in the second half of 2021, which saw almost 34,000 deals and deal values of $2.7tn.\n\nAsia Pacific: In the first half of 2024, deal volumes and deal values in Asia Pacific decreased by 17% and 32%, respectively, compared to the first half of 2023. Deal volumes in Japan decreased by 22%, China by 19% and while Australia, India and South Korea all saw declines in volumes, these were less severe. Deal values were down across all countries except India: despite a 17% decline in deal volumes, India’s deal values increased by 18%, but the average Indian deal size of $41m remains significantly below the past five-year average of $81m. Asia Pacific had no megadeals in the first half of 2024, compared to five in the first half of 2023.\n\nEurope, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA): In the first half of 2024, deal volumes in EMEA decreased by 26% as dealmaking in the region continued to face challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. Deal values increased by 9% from a year ago, but remain below 2020–2022 and even pre-COVID-19 levels. EMEA had nine megadeals in the first half of 2024, compared to ten in the whole of 2023."
