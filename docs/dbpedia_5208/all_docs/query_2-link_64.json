The East London branch is located in Chiselhurst on the outskirts of the city, thus creating the opportunity to eliminate much of the traffic and hustle and bustle of the city. The branch is easily accessible by public transport, with a taxi route and a train station within walking distance from the branch. The branch has adequate parking space for taxpayers, and our knowledgeable staff are equipped to deal with taxpayers in various official languages, thus assisting taxpayers in a language of their choice. Although the branch is on the outskirts of the city, it is however within 5-10 minutes walking distance to the Vincent Park shopping centre.\n\nLanguages spoken:"
