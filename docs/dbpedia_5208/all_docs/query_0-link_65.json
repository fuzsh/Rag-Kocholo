        "text": "If you’ve always lived in South Africa, and never travelled to a ‘cold’ snowy country in winter, chances are, you might never have seen snow in South Africa, thrown a snowball, made a snowman, listened to the rubbery squeak of your footsteps on a thick carpet of fresh snow, or watched falling snowflakes drift across your path.\n\nThis is something we think should be rectified as soon as possible, and it can be done right here in South Africa.\n\nSo here are some local places that aren’t too hard to reach, most don’t require passports or visas or long haul travel.\n\nCheck out the SA Snow Report.\n\nMatroosberg, Western Cape\n\nJust 2 hours from CT, the Matroosberg is the most reliable snow-place in the Western Cape, and attracts a lot of daytrippers when the flakes fall, so you’ll be sharing the sights with a few others who want to see snow in South Africa.\n\nCederberg, Western Cape\n\nSnow turns the rugged, rocky Cedarberg into a totally different landscape. Capetonians, pack your warmest layers and head out; it’s just a 3 hour drive to your first snowman.\n\nSutherland, Northern Cape\n\nHome to the enormous SALT telescope, icy-cold Sutherland often gets early winter snow, and is within easy reach of Cape Town.\n\nRhodes, Eastern Cape\n\nRhodes is a small, remote village, about 4 hours drive from East London, close to the Lesotho border. And this is where you’ll find the Tiffindell Ski Resort – so yes, it’s snowy. And snow or no snow, the winters are cold!\n\nTake hot chocolate, gloves, hoodies – you get the picture.\n\nHogsback, Eastern Cape\n\nHogsback is South Africa’s own Hobbit-land, and if you time your visit right, you might find yourself in a snowy fairytale. The Hogsback mountains are snow-capped in winter and the quaint town is worth a visit, with or without snowflakes.\n\nGolden Gate Highlands National Park, Free State\n\nClose to Bloemfontein, the Golden Gate gets a lot of snow almost every winter. Stay in the park or find great accommodation in Clarens, nearby. Take hot chocolate, gloves, hoodies – you get the picture.\n\nUnderberg and Sani Pass, KZN\n\nThe famous Sani Pass demands a 4×4 vehicle, so this is not for everyone, but you’ll get the snow you were looking for. The nearby towns of Underberg and Himeville also get snow, although not every year.\n\nMooi River, KZN\n\nJust 160km from Durban, Mooi River and Van Reenen’s Pass nearby both get a fair amount of snow in winter. In fact, the pass is sometimes closed due to heavy snowfalls.\n\nCathedral Peak, KZN\n\nOne of the most beautiful destinations and one of the best places to see snow in South Africa, Cathedral Peak always sees snow in winter, and you’ll be surrounded by snow-capped peaks. Hike to the top of the Peak, or just enjoy the scenery from below."
