        "text": "Understand\n\n[edit]\n\nEast London is on the east coast of South Africa. It is the main city in the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality, which includes East London, Bhisho and King William's Town. East London is home to Mdantsane township, once considered to be the second largest township in the country. It has an airport, a deep water port, and a railway link to the national rail network. It is widely held that this area was where the African buffalo was first spotted in the country, hence the name Buffalo City. The name \"East London\" is an old colonial name, and there is an ongoing debate about finding a suitable name change for the city.\n\nEast London has an estimated population of 810,000. It includes extensive tracts of land suitable for grazing and horticulture and is one of the major tomato-growing areas in the country because of its good climate throughout the year. Known for its beautiful beaches, it also boasts great game reserves where the Big Five can be found, including a lion park close to the city. In the sporting world, East London is also known as a boxing hub due to the number of world champion boxers it has produced and continues to produce.\n\nIn 1938 the then-curator of the town museum found an unusual fish in the catch of a local fishing vessel. The fish turned out to be a prehistoric coelacanth, long thought to be extinct.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nEast London can easily be reached by car. The N2 highway connects East London to Port Elizabeth and Durban ; the N6 goes to Bloemfontein.\n\nIf you are coming from or going to Port Elizabeth you should consider taking the scenic R72 \"Romantic Coast Road\", which takes a bit longer, but offers spectacular views and some nice little coastal towns (such as Port Alfred).\n\nDistances\n\n[edit]\n\nEast London-Mthatha (Umtata) : 235 km\n\nEast London-Durban : 676 km\n\nEast London-Cape Town : 1100 km\n\nEast London-Johannesburg : 982 km\n\nEast London-Kimberley: 720 km\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nShosholoza Meyl[dead link] operates regular inter-city trains from Johannesburg, Bloemfontein and Cape Town. You can also get to Kimberley, Pietermaritzburg and Durban (by changing trains in Bloemfontein) and Port Elizabeth (by changing trains in Noupoort or Colesburg). The fare from Johannesburg to East London is R540 in Sleeper class.\n\nMetroRail[dead link] operates commuter trains to some outlying suburbs of East London, with a reduced service over weekends.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nTranslux and Greyhound operate regular bus services to all bigger South African cities. on the corner of Buffalo and College streets are Minibus taxis going to port Elizabeth for R100. 6 hours. Eldo Coaches have buses to Johannesburg for R300.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nEast London lacks a public transport system, so getting around is difficult if you don't have a car. There are many car rental companies available, 3 of which have branches at the airport.\n\nTaxis are the best way of getting around East London and the suburbs of the city. They can be pre-booked and are quite cost-effective. A journey from the seafront (Sugarshack hostel) to the Hemingways Mall should only cost around R70 each way (2011 prices). From the Sugarshack to the downtown Shoprite costs R7.\n\nTo get from the Airport to any address in East London, the \"Little Red Bus\" offers a safe, reliable and good value link. They can be pre-booked by phone or email and will wait at the airport with your name on a sign. There may be other people sharing the bus with you, but the fee is per passenger. The bus will leave when all of the booked passengers have been picked up, so there is no worry about over filling the bus. The return journey to the airport or any other journeys in and around East London can be arranged as well.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]"
