14. Explore Nahoon Point Nature Reserve

Established in 2004, Nahoon Point Nature Reserve has over 2 kilometers of beautiful coastline and raised walkways with stunning ocean views. Its diverse landscape includes coastal sandstone, sandy beaches, coastal forests, rocky shores, and tranquil coves. The Nahoon area is of particular paleoanthropological importance owing to the discovery of fossilized footprints in a nearby cave in 1964. The footprints were later confirmed by the East London Museum to be around 124,000 years old, making them the oldest human footprints of their kind in existence. The cave’s roof has collapsed since then, but the rocky slab containing these prints, perfectly preserved, is now exhibited at the East London museum. Besides its historical significance, people come here for walks, birdwatching, and surfing.
