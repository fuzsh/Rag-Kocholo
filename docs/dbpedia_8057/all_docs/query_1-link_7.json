        "text": "On Saturday, July 2, from 4 to 6 p.m. in the back plaza gallery, Vail International Gallery will host an opening reception of the Nikolai Timkov (1912-1993) retrospective exhibition. Critically acclaimed as one of the finest 20th century landscape artists, Timkov’s works have been exhibited and sold at prestigious galleries in the American Southwest and on both coasts since the mid-1990s. His oeuvre was one of the first to open the collective eyes of Western Europe and the United States to the creative output of Russia under the Soviet system, undercutting the myth that all art created in the Soviet Union was dull, drab and inferior to our own art. Known for his colorful and soulful depiction of the Russian landscape, Timkov’s works are influenced by the great Post Impressionist painters of the early 20th century, artists whose works he studied during his student days in St. Petersburg before World War II. For more information, call the gallery at 970-476-2525 or email info@vailgallery.com ."
