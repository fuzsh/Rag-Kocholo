It was approved at the party congress of 1932 as a tool to strengthen the authority of the party and promote state ideas.\n\nThe authorities noticed the influence of art on public opinion and decided to use this power for the benefit of the development of socialism — this is how a new creative method was born.\n\nThe creations of socialist are simple to recognize. Their typical subjects are the factory workers at work, happy kolkhozniks against the backdrop of virgin lands, May Day marches, joyful pioneers, people on subbotniks, leaders meeting the population, and all that. Artists seemed to draw frames typical of Soviet films, they praised work — not for money, but for certificates and places on the honour boards. The paintings are realistic, they have no metaphors or abstractions. On the canvases, the colour scheme is light and pastel.\n\nA classic example of socialist is the Worker and Kolkhoz Woman monument, \"the Soviet era ideal\".\n\nBefore a public demonstration, all the creations needed to be aligned with the ideas of Marxism-Leninism. The approved paintings met three principles:\n\n— commitment to the people: understandability for people without special education, simplicity.\n\n— ideological commitment: the image of daily labour exploits that people performed to build a bright future.\n\n— specifity: socialist did not tolerate metaphors — only straightforwardness without any imagery or symbols.\n\nObjectives and methods\n\nThe authorities put the socialist realists the task of instilling in the population the belief that they live in the best country in the world, involving the people in building socialism, unconditionally believing in the Communists.\n\nTo justify the demands of the leaders, the artists painted an improved version of reality: happy pictures from the life of the average man, where there is no place for analysis and doubt. The state leaders were depicted exclusively in a positive light.\n\nSocialist realist artists were kindly treated by the authorities: they received government prizes, awards, and rested in sanatoriums. In parallel, there was the so called informal underground art, which met the trends of world cultural development. For such work, you could be imprisoned.\n\nYou’re an expert, if:\n\n… if you do not attribute all the work by Petrov-Vodkin to socialist without any exception — it contained metaphors, and sometimes even hidden ridicule of the Soviet ideals.\n\nYou’re a layman, if:\n\n… if you think that socialist is a subgenre of the that Caravaggio introduced to the world practice. The critic Andrei Sinyavsky concluded that this method was actually a Soviet version of classicism and .\n\nFamous social artists:\n\nIn painting: Evgenia Antipova, Isaak Brodsky, Boris Vladimirsky, Alexandr and Sergey Germasimovs, Gavriil Gorelov, Nikolai Timkov.\n\nIn sculpture: Vera Mukhina, Nikolai Tomsky, Yevgeny Vuchetich\n\nSignificant works:\n\nFyodor Reshetnikov’s \"Low Grades Again,\" 1952 is stored in the Tretyakov Gallery. During his career, the artist was recommended to several government awards and enjoyed the sympathy of the authorities.\n\nKim Su Dong’s \"Front Workers of the Age of Songun,\" 2009 is a painting by a representative of the Korean socialist realism; and the style is still popular in this\n\ncountry.\n\nWorker and Kolkhoz Woman, the sculpture by\n\nVera Mukhina\n\nMitrofan Grekov, Trumpeters of the First\n\nCavalry Army, 1934\n\nFine kettle of fish!\n\nIn order to show that socialist did not disappear along with the USSR, in 2009 Russian artists organized an exhibition of North Korean socialist in Moscow. The event was shocking: aside from the Asian appearance of the characters, you might think that the canvases depict the life of Russia in the Stalin era. However, in North Korea, such things and phenomena are happening now, in our time.\n\nToday in the world, there are several specialized galleries of socialist realism — in particular, the Museum of Socialist Art in Sofia, Bulgaria. The curators say: it is easier to learn the history of the no longer existing country from such canvases, than from books.\n\nRecommended artworks:\n\nWarm Evening\n\n1993, 50×70 cm\n\nAd\n\n\"On Warm Stones.\"\n\n2022, 130×140 cm\n\n€9,096.00\n\nOriginal\n\nAd\n\nTaiga\n\n2023, 60×50 cm\n\n€256.00\n\nOriginal\n\nAd\n\n\"Between Two Roads.\"\n\n150×180 cm\n\n€9,096.00\n\nOriginal\n\nAd\n\nSunset over Istanbul\n\n2024, 90×70 cm\n\nAd\n\n\"ONE SUMMER DAY\"\n\n130×130 cm\n\n€9,096.00\n\nOriginal\n\nAd\n\n\"In a rainbow.\"\n\n2023, 120×210 cm\n\n€9,096.00\n\nOriginal\n\nAd\n\nThe power of nature\n\n2023, 70×50 cm\n\n€2,251.00\n\nOriginal\n\nAd\n\nSpillover\n\n150×120 cm\n\n€9,096.00\n\nOriginal\n\nAd\n\n\"Motion 1 - (LISTOPAD).\n\n2021, 140×160 cm\n\n€9,096.00\n\nOriginal\n\nAd\n\nI'm with you\n\n2024, 100×80 cm\n\n€358.00\n\nOriginal\n\nThe delicate balance\n\nSocialist was surely a mirror of the era, and it perfectly reflected its positive aspects. Nevertheless, the artists were not always restricted in their freedom with a leg on their throat. For example, the well-known and respected socialist artist Deineka painted nudes, and he made beautiful\n\npaintings, which met the canons of the time.\n\nBathers\n\n1941, 65×79 cm"
