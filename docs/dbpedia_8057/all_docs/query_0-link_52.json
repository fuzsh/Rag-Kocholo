        "text": "My great-uncle made around 1000 photos when he served in the German Navy (before/during 2nd world war). Some of the pictures are rare (e.g. the picture from the Laconia incident that I have uploaded), additional pictures from ~1937 to 1943 will follow. I've also already sent an e-mail to permissions-commons@wikimedia.org (05 April)\n\n1) Do I have to use OTRS? 2) Is it possible that I attach additional pictures to the same OTRS ticket? If yes: How? And how would it work? Are the additional pictures then auto-approved when I refer to an approved ticket?\n\nThe situation is always the same: my father inherited the rights, he asked me to upload the files.\n\nM colorfu (talk)\n\nIf you sent the images as an attachment to permissions-commons, they will be redirected to the photosubmission queue where there is a 5-month backlog. If you prefer to upload the images yourself, you don't need to send in any email permission where you are the owner of the images. Stifle (talk)\n\nI would Like to post a picture of shaun white and his former girlfriend Summer Spiro(from the band RubySummer newly signed to disney's lyirc street records he has confirmed dating her many times in various interviews and i would also like to edit his personal life to mention that he dated her\n\nWhere did you get the picture? Stifle (talk)\n\nHello,\n\nI'm not sure where the user (Zithan) got permission to post this picture, but the woman in the picture, my colleague, Victoria Obst, would like it deleted. Please inform me of the procedure to take it down. Here is the file: Vicky_Obst_on_assignment_in_Nepal.jpeg\n\nThank you, Naureen\n\nNaureen, thank you for letting us know. Could she send this request via email to permissions-commons wikimedia.org? —Pill (talk)\n\nActually that's a bad place to send it. It should to to info-en-c wikimedia.org if the image is a copyright violation, or info-commons wikimedia.org if not. If it's already sent, it will be redirected to the right place. Stifle (talk)\n\nHi guys,\n\nThis image is from a website where other photos are all rights reserved, but per User:L.m.k/E-Mail Andrew Maycock the author gave permission under GFDL. However, L.m.k hasn't been on wiki for 2 years, so I doubt we can get permission emailed to OTRS (I just sent an email asking). Can we just copy this to an otrs ticket, or should I start a DR as lacking permission? -mattbuck (Talk)\n\nSpeaking for me, it would definitely not be sufficient to simply copy the email to OTRS. —Pill (talk)\n\nI concur with Pill. The permission needs to be sent via email where we can see proper headers; with due respect and no accusation involved, anybody could have written the details on that page. Stifle (talk)\n\nThat's what I was worried about. I'll wait a few days for an email and if nothing comes I'll delete it. -mattbuck (Talk)\n\nLicense information is missing for this image. --High Contrast (talk)\n\nOTRS tag was added by the uploader; now removed. Stifle (talk)\n\nOk, but here is no need for stating any license information? --High Contrast (talk)\n\nThere is. —Pill (talk)\n\nCan someone confirm, that the ticket this user selected for his fakes (belonging to files like File:ColinFirth05.jpg or File:Dita Von Teese at Selfridges, London.jpg) is indeed a fake? --Martin H. (talk)\n\nYou are correct. That ticket only refers to specific Caroline Ucci images from flickr. Inthernar is mis-using (or lying) about the ticket. I'd be glad to remove the ticket or take further action if necessary, but I'll leave you to it for the time being.\n\n-Andrew c (talk)\n\nIll just speedy delete the files. Note the false author information too, note the two deleted files DylanRamsey230px.jpg (log) and File:DylanRamsey.jpg. So: author wrong + ticket wrong.. fake upload, uploader searched for a way to trick Commons but he failed. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nOn Friday the confirmation on usage of football photos should come from michael_62(a)mail.ru to permissions-commons(a)wikimedia.org. Can anybody show me Ticket's ID? Sidik iz PTU Sidik iz PTU (talk)\n\nThe ticket number is 2010040910027812 but in order for a permission email to be properly processed, a response team volunteer has to review it first -- he will tag the image description files accordingly or email you in case of outstanding questions. This may take about two or three weeks. —Pill (talk)\n\nDoes Leningradartist have permission from the painters? We know, that only the copyright holder can grant a license and that this requires a written form. So he must have some written paper from the painters or their heirs either 1) transfering copyright on the paintings or 2) allowing him to license the particular reproductions under CC. His bookcover File:Unknown-Socialist-Realism-bo47bw.jpg passed OTRS, but on a wrong base! The painter Alexander M. Semionov was not even mentioned as an author but it contains his work. Now on this OTRS pass he claimed everything he uploaded as validly confirmed via OTRS. Based on his uploads this includes the painters:\n\nAlexander Semionov (1922—1984)\n\nLev Alexandrovich Russov (1926 - 1988)\n\nVladimir Ivanovich Ovchinnikov (1911 - 1978)\n\nFrentz Rudolf (1883 - 1956)\n\nDmitry Ivanovich Maevsky (1917 - 1992)\n\nPiotr Alberti (1913 - 1994)\n\nSergei Osipov (1915 - 1985)\n\nEvgenia Antipova (1917 - 2009)\n\nNikolai Pozdneev (1930 - 1978)\n\nNikolai Timkov (1912 - 1993)\n\nYuri Khukhrov (1932 - 2003)\n\nTaisia Afonina (1913-1994)\n\nVeniamin Ivanovich Borisov (b. 1935)\n\nDo the tickets 2010032110008071 and 2010040210038813 include this painters permissions to CC (or is the way of copyright transfer of the paintings explained and documented)? --Martin H. (talk)\n\nNote: Correspondence is in Russian. —Pill (talk)\n\nUser:Leningradartist asserts that he has exclusive rights for this paintings, which confirmed with paper agreements with each of listed authors. But OTRS correspondence not finished for this moment. — putnik\n\nI would like permission to use the photo of Jane Frazier on my family tree.\n\nThen, you have to ask the photographer. --Túrelio (talk)\n\nThat isn't necessarily true. First, you may want to review the FAQ. All content on the Commons is licensed freely, which means you are welcome to use the content, as long as you are following the terms of the licenses. For more information check out COM:REUSE and read the licensing information on the image description page for the image you want to use. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nIs this a correct fix [2] of the missing ticket problem? There are bunch of other files with similar bad ticket number. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nWhen following the concept, it would be. However, there's no such ticket. ZooFari\n\nActually, the ticket number can't be determined by the link. If you could provide a list of files to us that show this error, we can help fix. I have corrected the example you provided. ZooFari\n\nThanks for looking into it. Below is the list of files with a similar problem. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nFixed. ZooFari\n\nThanks again. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nOp 31 maart 2010 is de website www.rijksoverheid.nl live gegaan (zie hier). Op de copyright pagina van deze site staat \"Tenzij anders vermeld is op de inhoud van deze website de Creative Commons zero verklaring (CC0) van toepassing. Dit houdt in dat iedere vorm van hergebruik van de inhoud van deze site is toegestaan, tenzij bij of in een bepaald onderdeel (bijvoorbeeld een foto of een document) staat aangegeven dat op dat onderdeel een auteursrechtelijke uitzondering van toepassing is.\" Dit kan dus een zeer interessante bron zijn voor beeldmateriaal en het ligt voor de hand dat hiervan veelvuldig gebruik zal worden gemaakt. Het lijkt me erg onpraktisch als voor elke afbeelding afzonderlijk OTRS-toestemming moet worden verkregen. Daarom wil ik vragen of het mogelijk is om aan de uploadpagina deze bron expliciet toe te voegen (net als 'Het komt uit een bron van de federale overheid van de Verenigde Staten').\n\nEnglish:\n\nOn March 31st 2010 the website www.rijksoverheid.nl went live. This website is created by the national government of the Netherlands. The (dutch) copyright page of this site states \"Unless otherwise stated the Creative Commons zero (CC0) licence applies to the the contents of this website. This means that any reuse of the content of this website is allowed, unless it is indicated near or in a particular part (e.g. a picture or document) that a copyright exception applies.\" This site can be a very usefull source for images en it is to be expected that it will often be used as such. I think it would be very impractical if OTRS-permission needs to be requested for every single picture. So I would like to request to add this source explicitly to the dutch uploadpage (similar to 'It is from a US federal government source').\n\n--NormanB (talk)\n\nWhich is the same as {{PD-NL-Gov}}. /Pieter Kuiper (talk)\n\nPieter, thanks for your response. I have been able to upload a few pictures using this template, now I know it exists. But my request remains, since it is completely unclear that this template should be used when one views the uploadpage. The 'licentie' dropdown list doesn't show this option and the explanation on the top of the uploadpage doesn't mention anything about the option of using a special template in the 'toestemmings' box. With the information on the uploadpage, one would have to conclude that one has to use the OTRS route, which would be very cumbersome and, as I now understand, is not the correct route. So if anyone could make the upload page more clear in this respect, that would be very helpful. --NormanB (talk)\n\nHello!\n\nI have recently uploaded two images:\n\n(File:Megalodon jaws on display at the National Baltimore Aquarium.jpg) and (File:Megalodon skeleton.jpg)\n\nI request some one to check the information and provide OTRS permission. I have permission to use these images on wikipedia from their authors (copyright holders). The copyright holder of the first image instructed me to use Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license and I used it accordingly. The copyright holder of the second image instructed me to simply credit him and I did that, but I have used Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license for it too. The copyright holder of the second image have checked the details of the uploaded image by visiting the article in which it has been cited, and he did not object to this choice of license.---LeGenD (talk)\n\nHave you sent the permission you received from the copyright holders by email to permissions-commons wikimedia.org? If not, then please do so. If you have, please wait for an email reply to confirm that the permission has been received. The current processing time for permissions is three weeks. Stifle (talk)\n\nAlthough a week's worth of emails has been processed in the last day, so it mightn't be that long. Stifle (talk)\n\nI need permission to use File:SantiagoMapFinal.jpg. It says I have permission to use if I have an OTRS account or to post a message for someone who has this type of account. My email is abauer@ocde.us Thank you, Allison\n\nI'm afraid that isn't what that tag is saying. Please refer to the licensing information, and note that you are free to use the image as long as you follow the terms of that license. For more information, see COM:REUSE. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nHi! I found matching OTRS ticket for this image File:Cat in Winter.JPG. Anyone thinks it is not ok now? --MGA73 (talk)\n\nIt looks fine. Of course, keep in mind that there's really no way to verify any of the email addresses in the ticket other than to email here and see if you get something back. But that's an inherent limit of the system we have. Your task is done.--Chaser (talk)\n\nfor an architectural magazine, OnOffice.\n\nThanks\n\nMichael\n\nMNwilloughby(at)gmail (dot) com\n\nHave you read the FAQ and COM:REUSE? Stifle (talk)\n\nThe person has stuck a great big watermark on the picture claiming their copyright. Can we accept this? I don't really want to put it on the article in that state. 167.206.19.12\n\nI cannot find a file on Commons associated with that ticket. I've viewed the ticket, and it is a photosubmission, not permissions, related image, and it has not been approved/uploaded yet to my knowledge. If the submission is approved, and it licensed freely, then we are free to remove the watermark under the terms of the license. Can you post a link to the image you are discussing? Thanks. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nDear all,\n\nI would like to know if someone can tell me that do I have the right to use the music file \"File:07 - Vivaldi Autumn mvt 1 Allegro - John Harrison violin.ogg\" to be score of one of a broadcasting promotion video? Who and how should I seek permission of using it in the shortest time? Please contact the undersigned if you know. Many great thanks!!\n\nMkkisaac (talk) Mak Kit Kwan, Isaac <email address removed>\n\nI emailed him Commons:Reusing_content_outside_Wikimedia via Special:Emailuser.--Chaser (talk)\n\nSounds like a pointer to COM:REUSE would have done just as well. Stifle (talk)\n\nHi. I am wondering what is covered in OTRS #2010040810034691. TeeExperte (talk · contribs) has uploaded several images of dubious copyright, but that OTRS number is used at de:Diskussion:Teepack - I just don't read German so I don't know what it says or what the OTRS is for. Most or all images from TeeExperte are now at COM:DR and s/he has been brought up at COM:AN/U. Thank you. Wknight94 talk\n\nThe ticket addresses the copyright of text at the (since deleted) Teepack_GmbH article. It doesn't address images. Эlcobbola talk\n\nJust for the record: The article was moved to de:Teepack, the legal form of the company, GmbH, was removed. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nHi! I'm working on Category:Items missing OTRS ticket ID and I wonder if https://ticket.wikimedia.org/otrs/index.pl?Action=AgentTicketZoom&TicketID=1672578&ArticleID=2022165&ZoomExpand=0#2022165 match File:Motopuma.jpg? --MGA73 (talk)\n\nCould be, but we need someone who understands Spanish. —Pill (talk)\n\nThe ticket was mainly for the text, but the authorities of the website http://www.motospuma.com.ar granted permission for \"the content/material\" to be licensed under GFDL. Estoy de acuerdo con que el material se publique bajo la\n\nlicencia GFDL\n\nI don't feel it's enough for the ticket to be a permission for images on the website, as the whole email pertained to the text and not explicitly for images. Thoughts? ZooFari\n\nPlease check the permission for the picture Ludwigsbahnhof Fuerth 1835.JPG. I've sent the permission given by the builder of the model to permissions-commons@wikimedia.org Urmelbeauftragter (talk)\n\nI've updated the image description page. Note, however, that it may take up to some weeks until your email will have been processed. —Pill (talk)\n\nI have obtained permission and I have made templates:\n\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:Kre%C5%A1imir_Biki%C4%87_Picasa\n\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:Bosna_Srebrena --Quahadi Añtó\n\nOTRS emails are processed in the order received. There is currently a queue of approximately three weeks for processing of emails, and it would not be fair to jump your request ahead of the rest. Stifle (talk)\n\nDone. Permission granted--Ex13 (talk)\n\nDid they grant for just a specific list of images? If so, the templates should probably be subst'ed for those images. Wknight94 talk\n\nIt's allowed to take all pictures from http://www.bosnasrebrena.ba under cc-by-sa-3.0 licence. Also it's allowed to take pictures from album http://picasaweb.google.com/kresimirbikic under cc-by-sa-3.0 licence, except pictures with clearly visible people faces.--Ex13 (talk)\n\nI would like to know the content of the email sent from the ICRC on their emblem image. There is a discussion on that here and there seems to be some confusion on how the emblem should be properly used. --SaMi ✉\n\nThere's no email, no such ticket. I tried searching for it but I didn't get any results. ZooFari\n\nThat's weird. It seems the file the email originally applied to was File:ICRC Logo.png. It was changed according to the email on 11 February 2007. If that makes a difference. --SaMi ✉\n\nHi! I also need a check for File:Окрестности села Янурусово (Ишимбайский район).jpg and File:Река Кияук.jpg. Perhaps this ticket 2010041610044423 / [3] works. --MGA73 (talk)\n\nRussian is a language for which it might make more sense to directly ask a speaker that is currently active on their home project. I see several Russian speakers listed at OTRSwiki:List of accounts and meta:OTRS/personnel.--Chaser (talk)\n\nCould be. I just thought - what is the point of having a OTRS noticeboard and to have this \"Commons user and wish to confirm the permission, please contact someone with an OTRS account or leave a note at the OTRS noticeboard.\" in {{OTRS}} if users with OTRS account do not look here? :-( --MGA73 (talk)\n\nYou may get a Russian speaker responding here. If you don't, it may be necessary to contact them directly. Cheers.--Chaser (talk)\n\nUsers with OTRS accounts look here. It's just primarily English speakers. :-) Killiondude (talk)\n\nFile:Porcupine Tree band 2005.jpg has been marked for deletion. There is a reference to OTRS #2006082110002647. Does that OTRS confirm use of the image? Thank you. Wknight94 talk\n\nIt appears that a Wikipedian sent in an email asking for the copyright holder to use a free license, listed several, then the copyright holder just said \"OK\". Essentially, they didn't really choose a license. Killiondude (talk)\n\nIn view of Commons:Deletion requests/File:Lisa11-big.jpg I wonder what criteria you guys have for stating: \"The permission for use of this work has been verified\". This indicates that permission did not come from the photographer. In this case I would like to know who granted permission. /Pieter Kuiper (talk)\n\nAnswered by Rjd0060 here. --Captain-tucker (talk)\n\nI had seen that. It is not an answer to my questions. My impression from the outside is that the criteria for giving an OTRS ticket are less stringent than what is used in typical deletion requests for images uploaded by contributors without OTRS. So I asked for the criteria here, and specifically, for this image, I would like to know who granted permission. /Pieter Kuiper (talk)\n\nI think we have fairly strict standards on OTRS, or at least I've had issues come up in the past where users submitting permissions have been upset when I have said they aren't sufficient. Generally speaking, if something has been published elsewhere on the internet, we need to have a consent statement or form filled out by the copyright holder (and we check to see if the e-mail address it is being sent from matches what is listed on the contact page of the website where the content was first published). If they don't match up, we ask them to resend from an official e-mail address, or amend their webpage to list the new e-mail address. This doesn't cover all situations though, but it is the most common situation when dealing with permission. OTRS agents are asked to respect the privacy of those who send in permission, and we aren't to give out names, e-mail addresses, and other personal information. This may be why people are reluctant to be more specific in regards to \"who granted permission\". I've also viewed the ticket and found it clearly sufficient, but I don't want to get into more detail than necessary. A website that published the images got us in touch with an authorized party of the estate who gave permission.-Andrew c (talk)\n\nGenerally, in deletion requests, permission by a site owner posting the image is not good enough. For example, lots of images are posted by people on Flickr with a free license. That in itself is not sufficient to keep if that photo is not theirs. Typically, such images would get deleted on commons.\n\nAlso, in deletion requests, it is not uncommon that portraits get deleted that were submitted by the subject him/herself, or by heirs of the subject. /Pieter Kuiper (talk)\n\nWe are well aware of flickrwashing and rarely approve Flickr posted images, instead referring them to flickrreview. We also have a template response which points out the photographer is often the copyright holder, not the subject of the photograph. I entirely believe OTRS' handling of your example situations is entirely in line with how they are handled in deletion discussions. People can't sneak stuff through OTRS because we are more slack or anything like that (not to say that things don't sometimes fall through the cracks at both OTRS and DR).-Andrew c (talk)\n\nLet's get to the point. What specifically do you think is wrong with this image in relation to permission? do you have evidence that someone has submitted false information or is lying about permission?-Andrew c (talk)\n\nNo, how could I \"have evidence\"? I had asked because of the quote given here: \"I do not own [the photos].\" All that I can see is that the images were uploaded by User:Bynk in December, with Jeff Jacobson as the author, his website as the source, and GFDL as the licence. This has now changed completely. The licence is now CC-BY, although the quote talked about PD, and although credit does not seem to go to the photographer. (I am only responding since you asked; after your previous answer I had decided to drop it, because I do not wish the family to be bothered.) /Pieter Kuiper (talk)\n\nThe user who uploaded the content was confused or didn't have permission or something else along those lines, and thus entered incorrect information when first uplaoded. Through various e-mails on OTRS to two different individuals, we eventually received permission. Through these e-mails, we discovered information that the uploader did not know, and that is why the information changed on the image description page. The ticket is hard to read due to the formatting of the older messages (you know how some e-mail programs add lines and >>>>> marks to designate older e-mails being replied to). The website owner is the one who said \"I do not own the photos\". The OTRS agent asked for clarification and then we were put in touch with an authorized party of the family. The final permission did not come from the uploader or the website owner, as stated previously. The permission is valid in my opinion, and in the opinion of the agent who approved the ticket. Hope this helps. Not trying to drag this out any further, but I don't want you to leave thinking OTRS is lenient or allowing improper content. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nHello,\n\nCould someone please check this ticket and see if it provides answers to the problem I mention on Commons:Deletion requests/United States Holocaust Memorial Museum photographs and texts ? Is there a list of file names ? What is the licence of the files ? Does it adress the copyright status of the texts ? Teofilo (talk)\n\nI could not locate ticket 2007071910012533 in the OTRS system, also did a search for Buchenwald_Children_26146.jpg, Buchenwald_Children, Buchenwald Children with no results. --Captain-tucker (talk)\n\nThank you for your research. Teofilo (talk)\n\nI found the ticket (it is not in a permission queue) but it does not contain any information about copyright status; we were only noticed about a mass-upload of images. However, from what I can tell from the email address used, I can confirm that the claim on User:USHMM, i.e. that \"This user is in fact affiliated with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\", is apparently correct. —Pill (talk)\n\nThanks, should have said 'within the permissions queues'. Too bad OTRS does not tell you that the ticket exists but you don't have permission to view it. --Captain-tucker (talk)\n\nAn IP user, probably a person from the museum is asking at Commons:Deletion requests/United States Holocaust Memorial Museum photographs and texts what must be done so that the pictures are not deleted. Perhaps OTRS volunteers would like to add (or amend) whatever is necessary concerning OTRS requirements. Teofilo (talk)\n\nI am pleased to advise that the backlog on OTRS permissions and permissions-commons queues has been cleared down and the average response time to permissions emails in English is now 2-3 days. Hopefully it stays that low. Of the other languages, German, Russian, and Portuguese are currently somewhat backlogged, and Spanish is heavily backlogged.\n\nThis does not apply, however, to emails where the image has not been uploaded, but has been attached to the email instead. Emails like this are sent to the photosubmissions queue, which has a substantially longer wait time. Stifle (talk)\n\nI sent the permission by the author of File:Martin Rummel.jpg by email. Is this sufficient now?\n\n--DI Florian Fuchs (talk)\n\nYou should receive an email reply in a few days confirming either that the permission is acceptable or that it is not, and why not. Stifle (talk)\n\nFile:Elena Panova Photo Session.jpg has an OTRS ticket - does it not also cover other images uploaded by the same user of the same subject around the same time? Just making sure before I deleted one. Thank you. Wknight94 talk\n\nNo, the ticket only covers that specific image. Physchim62 (talk)\n\nCan someone double-check my work on these three images, please? (The issues are identical for all three.) OTRS ticket #2010041710024345. Relevant dialog and concerns here. Private comments can be emailed to me. Thank you.--Chaser (talk)\n\nAdditional: I wrote an possible author in my edit summary, if that author is covered by the source everything is fine although - as a matter of accuracy - I not like the already disclosed author information not being mentioned here but only someone called 'Thorson's webmaster' who has presumably no authorship. I'm not an OTRS volunteer, so I cant say its not OK, but from seeing the outcome of information I would say, its an mislabeled photo that was given from the photographer to the subject for a limited purpose (portfolio, use on own website) and without a copyright transfer taking place, as User:Toglenn once explained to me that this is a very common procedure in that industry. I refer to en:Wikipedia:Contact us/Photo submission requiring a description of the scenario of copyright transfer. --Martin H. (talk)\n\nUpdate I think we're good. [4].--Chaser (talk)\n\nHi! I just wanted to remind everyone that this category needs attention reguarly. At the moment the category contains 346 images mainly because I used my bot to find images with no ticket or a bad syntax. Asuming that volunteers know the syntax it could be a indication that ticket was added by a non-OTRS-user. So it might be a good idea to check image when syntax is fixed. I hope some users will help cleaning up. --MGA73 (talk)\n\nStarting to work on it. After fixing 10, one pattern has appeared, the id and ticket get reversed sometimes with id=ticket URL and ticket=id #. --Captain-tucker (talk)\n\nSuper! I fixed some of these syntax errors with the bot and I just noticed that the number is down to 191 images. --MGA73 (talk)\n\nI have this down to 88, I think I have almost all of the syntax issues fixed, have been playing with AWB and trying to remember what little I learned about REGEX years ago. --Captain-tucker (talk)\n\nThere are currently eight pictures on Commons for Your Favorite Enemies,\n\n1) File:Your favorite enemies 01.jpg\n\n2) File:Cd your favorite enemies.jpg\n\n3) File:Ep your favorite enemies.jpg\n\n4) File:Japan 01.jpg\n\n5) File:Japan 02.jpg\n\n6) File:Japan 03.jpg\n\n7) File:Japan 04.jpg\n\n8) File:Japan 05.jpg\n\nthat were orginally uploaded with OTRS permissions but there are no tickets numbers. The uploader says they are the copyright holder, but they list a flickr source where the images are \"All rights reserved.\" I would appreciate if someone would be able to look into these files. Aspects (talk)\n\nSee here. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nFile:Royal Trophy 2010.jpg is tagged as having no source, but I noticed the uploader included \"Ticket#2008020410021415\" in the info box. Is that a valid ticket? If so, does it clear up the source and permission of the image? Thanks. Wknight94 talk\n\nThat does not appear to be a valid OTRS ticket number. I enter it into the system and it takes me to a zero results page. Keep in mind the first 8 numbers of an OTRS ticket # are the date, so why would a ticket from Feb 4, 2008 apply for an image taken in 2010? Seems odd. Have you contacted the uploader to see the intention? The user has been around for quite a while, so maybe there was a mistake somewhere. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nHmmm, looks like the user has invented other ticket numbers: [5][6] Wknight94 talk\n\nThe first one is an actual OTRS ticket, and that user does appear to be the sender, but it's not in English, and it never received final OTRS approval. The 2nd one came up like the one you mentioned in your first message. Maybe there was a database loss? I know last year some unanswered tickets were deleted at some point, but don't know if something similar could explain these blank tickets, or whether they actually are 'made up', since at least one clearly isn't fake. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nHmmm. Well, I've deleted File:Royal Trophy 2010.jpg anyway. Like you said, how can a picture of a 2010 golf event be approved in 2008? But maybe someone with matching language can assist the user. Wknight94 talk\n\nAny Dutch-speaking volunteer around? (Note that ticket:2008020410021415 and ticket:2008011410011651 are valid ticket numbers, the tickets are in the info-nl queue [unfortunately, with present configuration you are not displayed the tickets if you do not have at least read access to the queue in which they are stored]; a Dutch-speaking volunteer may also want to look at ticket:2007120410018181.) —Pill (talk)\n\nSorry about that. Normally I'm taken to a \"no permission\" error screen for situations like this, but for whatever reason I was taken to a nil search result, which is why I was saying they weren't real tickets. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nI think the \"no permission\" screen appears if you follow the ticket URL; it doesn't if you search for the ticket from within OTRS. —Pill (talk)\n\nAnd either way can whoever finally deals with these tickets move them to permissions-nl? Stifle (talk)\n\nFile:Mehdi Karubi-campagne.jpg and en:File:Portrait of Mohammad Khatami.jpg have the same OTRS number? feydey (talk)\n\nThe ticket references an entire picasa web album, but it isn't clear to me that an OTRS agent gave final permission. There were concerns about the photographer, not the subject owning copyright, and we never sent out a \"thank you, images approved\" message, so IMO both are lacking permission due to the ticket not having satisfactory evidence of permission. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nAnother upload - en:File:505px-Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Nowruz.jpg - any decisions on keeping/removing these images? feydey (talk)\n\nThe Picasa web album tag these as non-commercial, and there were outstanding issues with the OTRS, so I'd say they are non-permission, deletable (however, I'm not 100% sure on that since there is a bit of Arabic in the tickets that I cannot read). -Andrew c (talk)\n\nCommons has few images of coins from the same site. For example File:Half Shekel.jpg I wonder, if I may upload other image from the same site using the same permission. Thanks.--Mbz1 (talk)\n\nYes, that ticket is valid for GFDL/cc-by-sa-2.5 for all images on that site. Stifle (talk)\n\nThank you.--Mbz1 (talk)\n\nHi! There is a ticket for this file. Maybe someone can check it? Thanks! --Ireas talk•de•en\n\nRaymond added an OTRS tag to the (now deleted) local file version on dewiki; the ticket number specified was the same as that mentioned by you. Does this suffice? —Pill (talk)\n\nThanks. Can you please correct the information on the file description (I don’t think that Reiner Beck is the author) and add the OTRS template? --Ireas talk•de•en\n\nHi, I have resent the permission for photos hushuli.jpg, hushuli2.jpg, and hushuli in copenhagen.jpg. Posting here to let you know. Thank you very much. ~wangjing13 64.27.1.179\n\nWhile sorting photos related to high schools, I came across 3 images related to a controversial prom invitation in 2009. I have put them in Category:John Burroughs School 2009 prom invitation. They claim to have OTRS pending as of 2009-12-31, but were improperly templated, so that the OTRS template didn't actually appear. I fixed the templates, but they are still backdated and need to be dealt with. In particular, I've discovered that the origin of File:2009ControversialInvitation2.jpg appears to be The Seven Deadly Sins: LUST by Marta Dahlig (blackeri on deviantART) of Poland, and a free license is not likely. --Closeapple (talk)\n\nI cannot find anything related in our system. Could you perhaps add a \"no license\" tag? —Pill (talk)\n\nThey all have {{Cc-zero}}, but that seems unreliable, especially for Marta Dahlig (a commercial artist with no evidence of having given permission). I've now added {{Npd}} to #2 (Dahlig's) and {{Nopd}} to the others. --Closeapple (talk)\n\n2006101710008538 is used as an example ticket ID in several contexts, most notably Template:PermissionOTRS/doc. From Commons:OTRS/Noticeboard/Archive 3#Permission to use picture of stickleback stamp in book published by University? and {{Faroe stamps}}, I infer that it is valid for stamps from the Faroe Islands, but it appears that its use as an example parameter means that it is also being abused for other purposes (be it in good faith or in bad faith).\n\nWith that in mind, could I get an OTRS check on the following files:\n\nFile:Alex friends.JPG\n\nFile:Masjid Banten.JPG\n\nFile:Kota Tangsel.PNG\n\nFile:Kota Cilegon.PNG\n\nFile:KabupatenSerang.PNG\n\nFile:RatuAtut.JPG\n\nFile:Moh masduki.jpg\n\nFile:Dgte.jpg\n\nFile:Sexy girl.JPG\n\nFile:School222.jpg\n\nFile:G10f01-pub-1g.jpg\n\nFile:TheChamp.jpg\n\nNot sure all of these need an OTRS permission, although if the uploader thought one was needed, clarification might be needed, if only for that fact. Some definitely do need permission, and some also have issues with missing information. In those cases, please check if there is another valid ticket and correct and complete the information as needed. Thanks! —LX (talk, contribs)\n\nNone of those images are covered by the ticket in question. The uploads by Artaveiro all seem suspect, as I could not locate anything about \"Banten\" when searching. Couldn't find a ticket for File:Dgte.jpg either. I only briefly searched for Alexms22's images since they were tagged as own work (didn't find a ticket in my minimal searching). And we clearly don't need OTRS for a Department of Treasure US work. Didn't find anything for TheChamp.jpg either. So, I'd say remove all references to this ticket, and the ones you feel need permission, tag as NPD and contact the uploader. Hope this helps. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nWould it be a good idea to also go through all the examples using it and change it to some obviously bogus number like, say, 2010023012345678? —Ilmari Karonen (talk)\n\nMight be a good idea! Except I think your number isn't obviously bogus. maybe something with all zeros or Xs. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nWell, I was trying to make it follow the usual format. But yeah, you're right, 0000000000000000 is probably better. —Ilmari Karonen (talk)\n\nI went and changed Template:PermissionOTRS/doc to use 0000000000000000 for the examples (except for the old-style syntax where I had to use 2000000000000000 instead to make it work; eww). I also make the same change to w:Template:PermissionOTRS/doc, but there are still quite a few other pages left using the 2006101710008538 number. —Ilmari Karonen (talk)\n\nWent through and fixed up/tagged all the files above. —LX (talk, contribs)\n\nI just did a search for the ticket URL example given, and found some more bogus images. I'll list them as you listed the ones above:\n\nFile:Cristian berrios.jpg\n\nFile:Morozov 1990.jpg\n\nFile:What.jpg\n\nFile:The Four Age Groups.pdf\n\nFile:Rt130front.jpg\n\nFile:Geir Stian Orsten Ulstein av Tonsart .jpg\n\nFile:Geir Stian Orsten Ulstein 2 av tonsart.JPG\n\nAnd as above, I'd say mark them as NPD if you think they need permission, simple remove the tag if it's sufficient \"own work\", and contact the uploader when in doubt. Good luck! -Andrew c (talk)\n\nLooking at the files referencing this example URL, it seems that permission is valid for some works by Matthew Bowden. Correct?\n\nFor File:Cristian berrios.jpg (which makes no reference to Matthew Bowden), the OTRS tag was added by the uploader, Seth Garden, who is not an OTRS volunteer and thus should not be adding such tags. Still, User:J.smith, who is an OTRS volunteer, was somehow able to confirm the permission, and Shizhao, who is also an OTRS volunteer, found the information provided to be satisfactory enough to remove the file's problem tag.\n\nFor File:Geir Stian Orsten Ulstein av Tonsart .jpg and File:Geir Stian Orsten Ulstein 2 av tonsart.JPG, the references to the example ticket were added by Kjetil r, who is an OTRS volunteer.\n\nI feel like I have no idea what's going on here. Could anyone clear this up? —LX (talk, contribs)\n\nI have no idea what those other admins were doing. I can only confirm that the ticket on those images only relate to stock.xchng user thesaint, and that all of those images are not sourced to stock.xchng user thesaint, and therefore at the very least have an incorrect OTRS ID. I can try to search the system, but if the permission was given in a non-English info queue instead of a permission queue, I won't be able to see if there is a ticket for the image or not. I can also search based on what OTRS agent gave the permission... it'll take a bit of time, but I guess I'll look into it further maybe later tonight or tomorrow. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nSorry for that, I don't know what happened there. Good thing that Andrew c fixed it. --Kjetil_r\n\nFile:Cristian_berrios.jpg Uploader added OTRS #[7]. Not sure what OTRSN discussion Martin H was discussing, I looked at archive 2 and nothing from around 31 August 2009 jumps out at me. I'd say this image has no permission, as I searched OTRS for it's file name and got nothing\n\nI found a ticket for the 2 Geir Stian Orsten Ulstein images, so I have stricken them. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nUntil about two years ago, I had access to \"permissions-commons\" and a couple of more permissions queues. For some reason, this access disappeared, and I now only have access to the \"info-no\" queue. Is it possible to get the access to \"permissions-commons\" back? Regards, --Kjetil_r\n\nYou might contact one of the OTRS administrators directly. I don't think they read this page regularly.--Chaser (talk)\n\nThere is an OTRS admin noticeboard on the OTRS wiki, which at least 2-3 of them regularly monitor, so response time is often snappy. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nI do not know about an OTRS wiki (when was this information sent out to OTRS volunteers?), but I'll contact one of the admins directly, thanks. --Kjetil_r\n\nLooks like it was created in September 2008. I've been an OTRS agent for just over a year, and so I was told about it when my account was created. It's located at http://otrs-wiki.wikimedia.org. If you are interested, I'm sure whatever admin you talk to can create an account for you there, if you don't already have one. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nThanks, have emailed user:Guillom about this. --Kjetil_r\n\nHi, I emailed through a permission for File:Currawong explosion 8.jpg yesterday (or the day before?) - the copyright holder had sent it to me rather than directly to permissions - I wasn't sure how long the wait was currently but the last two got approved within a day (for which I was grateful). If someone could chase up and verify I'd be very grateful. Casliber (talk)\n\nThere may be as many as 40 e-mails before yours. Please be patient. While the backlog has been reduced since a month ago, you still should wait 14 days or so before contacting us here. Thanks!

Could someone please provide the details? 67.128.23.239\n\nProf. John Harrison has clearly stated he has the full copyright to that file in his e-mail to the OTRS on 2007-02-27. This has been checked by OTRS people in 2007 and seems to be ok. odder (talk)\n\nIt says that permission from Lysenko was sent to permissions-ru on 03 may 2010, but description has no OTRS-ticket.

I can't verify that 100% because I don't read Russian. I'd say we should add the OTRS pending template to the image, as that is the proper procedure, and helps add the image to the proper pending categories. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nActually, I did some more digging and looked from 5/1-5/6 in the Russian queue and found no tickets dealing with this image. I also searched for the file name (and variations on it) and found nothing.-Andrew c (talk)\n\nWikiwal3 (talk · contribs) is saying that the otrs:4514443 for File:Marienhafe Orgel 6.jpg should also include File:Marienhafe Orgel 1.JPG, File:Marienhafe Orgel 2.jpg, File:Marienhafe Orgel 3.jpg, and File:Marienhafe Orgel 4.jpg. Can someone verify and add OTRS tags to those if applicable? Thank you! Wknight94 talk\n\nThe linked ticket (2010022310007392) applies only to File:Marienhafe Orgel 6.jpg, which is referenced specifically by file name.

If the uploader and/or copyright holder wants us to approve a permission, they need to e-mail us directly or forward the messages with headers intact. Furthermore, that permission is not sufficient because the request was misleading by saying we are non-commercial, and the permission seems to be for \"Wikipedia only\" where permission has to allow 3rd party reuse, modification, and possible commercial use. Best thing to do would to have the copyright holder choose a free license, and then e-mail us directly a consent statement (i.e. COM:EMAIL) -Andrew c (talk)\n\nHi! I sent a permission granted by Around the Rings (http://www.aroundtherings.com/) to permissions-commons, and I would like to ask its confirmation. I do not know if the copyright holder sent the permission directly (as I asked), so I decided to forward the email. Best regards; Felipe Menegaz\n\nDid you read the FAQ?

I am wondering if this ticket is applicable to sites that claim to have obtained their images from CNG (File:Pdc 24586.jpg and File:Mithradatesi.jpg, which were taken from www.parthia.com). Jappalang (talk)\n\nThis ticket covers just two named images. I suggest to get in contact with the copyright holders for any further images or to explicitly ask for a general permission. --AFBorchert (talk)\n\nThis is a bit weird; according to Flominator and Siebrand at Commons:Deletion requests/Template:CNG (2), Ticket# 2006092710009217 is supposed to \"licenses all images from the site both cc-by-sa-2.5 and GFDL.\" Instead, it covers only two images from the site? Jappalang (talk)\n\nI don't agree with Flominator's and Siebrand's interpretations. The permission applies to images at http://www.coinarchives.com/a/lotviewer.php?LotID=48290&AucID=52&Lot=886 only (now dead - the ticket is from 2006). This same URL is pasted twice; there are not two unique coins and/or URLs in the ticket. My reading from this address, then, is that this permission applies to coins appearing in Auction 52, Lot 886. The ability to search the archive with that specificity, however, appears to be a pay only service. The site's screen shot of the archive suggests one coin per lot, which may mean this ticket applies to but one coin. (Although identification be be available through http://www.parthia.com, I haven't looked.) If this ticket truly applies to all cng coins, I'd really appreciate an explanation of how that conclusion is to be reached. Эlcobbola talk\n\nI just forwarded the email to AFBorchert and the OTRS. I was really sure, that I asked them about all of their pictures. Looking at that email now, three and a half year later, I think I didn't :( The reason: I was just forwarding an email of someone else to them, where he mentioned two links. I thought, these were about the site in general (they didn't end on .jpg), but apparently they were links to certain coin images. I will ask them NOW, if we can use their pictures in general. :( --Flominator (talk)\n\nHi Flominator, the email you've forwarded to OTRS is a duplicate of the one we have already in ticket 2006092710009217. Please ask the copyright holder to send a general permission to OTRS, preferably refering to “[Ticket#2006092710009217]” in its subject. Regards, AFBorchert (talk)\n\nI just forwarded you their reply. --Flominator (talk)\n\nThanks, it's in our system. Following common practice, I have asked for a confirmation. Regards, AFBorchert (talk)\n\nWe have received now the confirmation of the copyright holder in the OTRS system that this permission covers all images from the site www.cngcoins.com under the free licenses {{GFDL}} and {{Cc-by-sa-2.5}}. I suggest to use {{self|1=GFDL|2=Cc-by-sa-2.5|migration=not-eligible|author=Classical Numismatic Group|attribution=Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. http://www.cngcoins.com}}{{PermissionOTRS|id=2006092710009217}}. If this is likely to become a larger set of images, I might be helpful to create a specific license template for it. --AFBorchert (talk)\n\nJust a note that a specific license template was already created—{{CNG}}—although with ticket ID 450621. Jappalang (talk)\n\n(outdent) Okay, now that the ticket (for all CNG photos) is sorted out, how about the original question: can this ticket apply to the photos on another site that claim them to be CNG images? Jappalang (talk)\n\nOh sorry, I've missed that. I have asked the copyright holder for a confirmation regarding these two images and I've updated {{CNG}}. —AFBorchert (talk)\n\nWe have now received an explicit permission for the two images referenced above. As stated above, we have a general permission for all images coming from www.cngcoins.com. In case of doubts for images coming through third parties, I suggest to post them here such that an OTRS member can ask the copyright holder for a confirmation. --AFBorchert (talk)\n\nThank you very much! But since you asked (heh), would anyone mind checking File:Mithridatesiiyoung.jpg? It came from coinarchives.com, which uses images from several coin auction site (including CNG). I have yet to see a CNG image with a pale blue background, and so would like this to be verified.

Thanks, --Kam Solusar (talk)\n\nTicket #2008110310020197 is associated with File:Iskanwaya 1.jpg.

Meister says he doesn't have any details about the correspondence anymore, so we don't know what exactly the author agreed to back then. Seems like the images have to be deleted. --Kam Solusar (talk)\n\nImages are claimed to be from Flickr. Much easier to go through the flickrreview process, as often it is hard to confirm identities from flickr, plus flickr mail is not compatible with external e-mail programs, so it's best to just ask the owner to change the licensing tag on Flickr. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nYou're right, asking the Flickr user to change the licensing on Flickr is the easiest way. Maybe Meister still knows where exactly he found the images, because I can't find them or the user anywhere on Flickr. --Kam Solusar (talk)\n\nHi!

JoeJohnson2 (talk)\n\nHave you seen w:WP:COPYREQ? First, you need a more specific permission statement, one that clearly is a declaration of ownership, followed by stating a specific license for reuse. Permission for us on Wikipedia only is not acceptable. You can have them forward a default consent statement to our e-mail address per COM:EMAIL, or you can forward the permission if it is sent to you, as long as you keep the e-mail headers intact, and don't copy and paste like you did here. It is a bit complicated, but we do take licensing and copyright issues pretty seriously here, since our mission is to be free (as in freely licensed). Hope this helps. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nCan someone check to see if the above file is OK & good for transfer under this ticket from File:04.JVL-Octopuss from Who's Zoo.jpg or this one from File:'muchness' for Alice089.jpg both from the same author?

The author did, however, state that permission should be validated to all the images at en:John Vernon Lord. The volunteer rejected and gave permission only to the files stated in the email. The author would need to send another email listing all of the images in the article (e.g. en:File:JVL Jack Snipe.jpg) in order to validate permissions for each image he is releasing. ZooFari\n\nHm.

Stifle (talk)\n\nDid you ever get a permission for use of all images from http://www.sanmartin.gov.ar? I'm sorry that I can't provide a ticket number--DieBuche (talk)\n\nWe would need a ticket number, or the subject of the email permission, or the address it was sent from. The OTRS search system is not very good to use. Stifle (talk)\n\nThis appears to be the relevant ticket. I don't know Spanish.--Rockfang (talk)\n\nCan someone tell me the status of File:Phantom ray rollout.jpg. I nominated an article and the image for Did you know on Wikipedia and its in the Queue (without its image) set to appear 20 hours from now. Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (talk)\n\nI could not find anything in my queues when I searched for \"Phantom ray rollout.jpg\". This means one of three possible things 1) e-mail was never received 2) e-mail doesn't mention the filename by way of \"Phantom ray rollout.jpg\" or 3) it's in a queue I don't have access to. Do you have any more information, such as the subject of the e-mail, or e-mail address it was sent from or something I could search for (or the date it was sent, or what address it was sent to...) -Andrew c (talk)\n\nAddress:permissions-commons@wikimedia.org\n\nDate:Thu, May 20, 2010 at 5:21 PM\n\nSubject:File:Phantom ray rollout.jpg\n\nIf I send it again will you verify it?Marcus Aurelius (talk)\n\nGuess this one is my fault. I didn't search the subject line, ha. I only searched for message text. Anyway, I was processing images from the 15th earlier today, so due to the backlog, it may be another couple days before we can get to your request. Maybe another agent will see this, and due to the DYK deadline in 20 hours, decide to handle this ticket sooner. BTW, I've merged your newest e-mail with the original one, so there shouldn't be any confusion or duplicate response due to you having sent it twice.-Andrew c (talk)\n\nThis appears to be the relevant ticket. The copyright holder needs to clearly state they are releasing the image under a specific license.--Rockfang (talk)\n\nI uploaded the image a few days ago, if the email I sent to the OTRS permissions email could be confirmed for the image, I'd really appreciate it. I understand there is likely an overload of images needing attention, but if the image could be verified sometime soon, to allow for any mistakes to be corrected as quickly as possible, again, I'd really appreciate it. Gage (talk)\n\nRoughly a 17 day backlog at this point for English language e-mails. Tickets are handled in the order they were received. Please be patient. Check the FAQ for more details. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nCould you please provide the subject line (or a portion of it) of the email that was sent to otrs?--Rockfang (talk)\n\nCan This image be used in a book /Paperback Kindle. This is a beautiful image. Thank you.

And an OTRS agent is already on top of this. Nothing to see here. -Andrew c (talk)\n\nResolved\n\nTeofilo (talk)\n\nI'm confused about File:MehganCommercial.jpg and otrs:2010022010020417. An OTRS ticket was applied but there is still no source. What is the OTRS ticket for then? Thanks. Wknight94 talk"
