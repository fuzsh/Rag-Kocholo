After completing middle school Skoptsov proceeded to work as a metalworker. At the same time Skoptsov started drawing and illustrating. He served in the USSR Airforce and at the conclusion of his military service attempted to enter into arts major programs in Odessa and Moscow. During his attempt at formal education, Konstantin discovered that the subject matter requirements imposed by the Communist Party contradicted with his artistic vision and personal beliefs. He therefore abandoned his efforts towards a college degree and instead joined the growing underground movement of young and politically independent artists.\n\nHis first public exhibitions started in 1976, mostly in the apartment galleries hosted by private art collectors, accessible by invitation only. Today, his works are displayed throughout the world, in major galleries and museums.\n\nIn 2000 Skoptsov was introduced to his future mentor, Temistokl Vyrsta, a renowned French abstractionist. This relationship had marked an important milestone in the artist's career as he became a representative of the French Art Association Fenix and established a large presence in Paris, in collaboration with the art project Paris School of Ukrainian Painting.\n\nIn 2004, Skoptsov received a recognition award by Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John for his illustrations to Henri de Régnier. Concurrently he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by the Russian-Italian Academy Ferroni [1] for illustrations to Dante Alighieri, as well as an essay on Giotto di Bondone’s frescoes at the La Basilica di San Francesco d'Assisi.\n\nSkoptsov develops and promotes his signature Semantic Realism style and uses a variety of media for his artistic inspirations, from canvas and paper to natural leather. He considers such Masters of drawing and painting as Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Hieronymus Bosch to be an inspiration and predecessors of Semantic Realism. Based on his own interviews and similarity in themes and style, he is frequently referred to as \"Bosch From Odessa\" by the Ukrainian media.\n\nCurrently, Konstantin Skoptsov lives and works in his home city of Odessa, continuing collaborations with international galleries and museums.\n\nQuotes\n\nAbout Drawing and Painting: “Line expresses everything permanent, while color – transient. The line, reigning this world, determines everything – it is a solely abstract symbol: Line reflect both character of the subject and unity of narrative. Line defines the whole atmosphere and fixates your feelings. Reality here can only serve as a starting point for Art to travel to the place where Idea dwells “Clothed in sensual form”.\n\nAbout Underground: “True art was and always will be an outsider, staying beyond the limits of the aquarium of art life and always remote from the crafty art feeder. It is the “salt”, without it art becomes bland, it is the “cut” of the diamond, and as defined by Jean Cocteau, reflects artistic aristocracy. Only when we look at the pieces created by such artists as Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Modigliani, cast out by contemporaries, we see deeply into fundamental reasoning of art”.\n\nQuotes about him\n\nBy Russian Art Critic Stanislav Aidenyan: \"His [Konstantin Skoptsov's] name is among the most talented graphic artists in Odessa. Konstantin is an artist and a poet, though also is known to be a kind of a philosopher, a thinker who encourages submerging into the subconscious mind. His creative work combines avant-garde and tradition, mysticism and unchained elaborate imagery... That could be said in reference to both his visually- artistic and literary-poetic experiments\".\n\nBy Ukrainian journalist Viktor Tymoshenko: “the subjects [of Skoptsov artworks] are inspired by the ancient chinese and japanese poets, by the couplets of their genius creations. It is a mystery how Konstantin Skoptsov \"materializes\", populates a sheet of paper with dreams, \"phantoms\", horrors, outer worlds of the remote, unfamiliar to us time\".\n\nAchievements and awards\n\nA registered member of Professional Artist Union of Russian Federation.\n\nRepresentative of Paris School of Ukrainian Paining in Odessa, founded by Temistokl Vyrsta.\n\nRepresentative of Art-Association Fenix, Paris.\n\nFounder of Semantic Realism art style.\n\nHonorary Fellow of Russian-Italian Academy Ferrony.\n\nFellowship at Nouvelle Academie Libre (Paris).\n\nMember of Art-Club Ekaterinenskaya Square, Moscow.\n\nRecipient of Ordre souverain militaire hospitalier de Saint-Jean, de Jérusalem, de Rhodes et de Malte award for Achievements in Art.\n\nFinalist of Ukrainian Rating Project Top 100 Pride of Ukraine: Men.\n\nSolo and group exhibitions\n\n1986 – Participant, Group Exhibition Salon of Association of Galleries of Taiwan, Hong-Kong.\n\n1989 – Participant, Group Exhibition City Dreams, State Literary Museum, Odessa, Ukraine.\n\n1990 – Participant, Group Exhibition Mystic Art, Odessa Museum of History and Ethnography, Odessa, Ukraine.\n\n1991 – Solo Exhibition, Museum of Anastasia and Marina Tsvetaevy, Alexandrov, Russia.\n\n1991 – Solo Exhibition.
