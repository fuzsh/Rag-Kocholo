        "text": "[M]y latest obsession—as odd and passionate as any—has actually been the history of winter landscape painting. Yep, you read that right. [For weeks] I have spent several hours every day scouring the internet in search of awe-inspiring winter landscapes from art history. My tired eyes have scanned thousands of paintings, and I’ve finally come up with a list of over 1000 that I want to share with you in chronological order—a diverse selection which I think will beautifully illustrate the story of winter landscape painting (at least in the West). And may I just say: it’s not as boring as it sounds! In fact, I think it’s riveting stuff. I hope you will agree.\n\nHow, you may ask, did I become so fixated on such a bizarre topic? Well, like many folks, I’ve long enjoyed the glittering and austere beauty of winter landscapes. … [But] I only became interested in this particular topic—the history of winter landscape painting—when my wife posted an article from NPR over the holidays called “These Artists Will Change Your Mind About Winter” by Susan Stamberg. It contains some great lesser-known examples of winter landscapes as well as some fun commentary. “For me,” Stamberg writes, “the perfect way to experience snow is to see it hanging on the wall of a great museum!” I can empathize.\n\nAnyway, that article sparked my interest and led me to do a quick search of other lists of winter landscape paintings from art history. What I found was that most of the lists—such as here, here, here, and here—recycled the same dozen or so famous winter landscapes with not that much variation. There has to be more than just these, I thought. In fact, I knew there was. I knew enough about the massive and diverse history of Western painting to know that there was indeed much more to winter landscape painting.\n\nYet, it’s certainly not a well-known subgenre. If I think back to my Art History courses in college, there were very few examples of winter scenes. If you could somehow list the 1,000 most popular paintings in the Western public’s imagination, probably no more than 10 would feature any snow or ice, and pretty much all of those 10 paintings would be by either Pieter Brueghel the Elder, Caspar David Friedrich, or Claude Monet. That’s what we think of when we think of winter landscapes—and to be sure, those guys are the greatest pioneers of the genre, but there’s much more to it. Despite the traditional aversion to landscape and nature-centered painting in the West prior to the Northern Renaissance, winter has been a big part of Western life. In much of Europe and North America, global warming notwithstanding, snow and ice have been pretty regular features of life for about a quarter of every year, and that was especially true during the so-called “Little Ice Age” which lasted from about 1300 to 1700.\n\nThus, to get at last to the point, after several weeks of digging I’m ready to start sharing my list with you. It is of course hardly a definitive or even exhaustive list—I’m quite confident in fact that there are still hundreds more stunning winter masterpieces to be discovered, particularly in non-Western and more contemporary art traditions, but I just can’t stand to stare at screens anymore right now. That said, because the list is so long—having, as I said, ballooned to over 1000—I’ve decided to break it up into these four batches:\n\n1.) 1400-1870: This batch goes from the late Medieval period through the Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassical, Romantic, and Realist periods in Western art history to the early days of Impressionism, which began in the mid-1860s. It also includes landscapes from the golden era of Japanese printmaking.\n\n2.) 1870-1900: This batch encompasses most of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist periods—in which there was A LOT of landscape painting being done—as well as the tail-end of the (official) Realist period.\n\n3.) 1900-1930: This batch includes a bunch of works from the Expressionist movement, as well as occasional works from the Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Fauvist, Cubist, and Surrealist movements. It also includes a lot of paintings from North American iterations of Impressionism (e.g., Group of Seven painters) and Regionalism/Realism.\n\n4.) 1930-2020: This last batch is a mix of all kinds of things, mostly from North America, though it largely avoids the abstract and pop-art styles dominant in Western art in the post-WWII era—mainly because there aren’t a lot of obvious “winter landscapes” by abstract artists. Most of these paintings range in style from Regionalism/Realism to modern variations of Impressionism and Expressionism. It’s a very mixed bag.\n\nUltimately, while winter landscape painting may not be the most exciting genre of art history, I have found that it is a fascinating and illuminating lens through which to view the development of Western art. I hope you too garner some insights from these lists, and find a few works that you too enjoy. Feel free to share your favorites in the comments."
