        "text": "Artistic journey and the heritage of a distinguished Russian artist Viacheslav F. (Frantsevich) Zagonek (1919-1994) give an insight into how natural talent for painting and artistic ideals acquired over time could be successfully realized in the contradictory atmosphere of the twentieth century.\n\nViacheslav Zagonek was born in Irkutsk, Siberia. His par ents were an 18-year old girl from Belarus, thrown to the Urals by the inclement winds of the Revolution, and a Moravian former officer of the AustroHungarian army. In 1920 the family immi grated to Czechoslovakia; however, in 1927 they became Soviet citizens and settled in Leningrad.\n\nLater, speaking of his predisposition to painting he inherited from his father, Viacheslav Zagonek gratefully recollected everything his father had done for his son’s artistic development. It was his father who took him to renowned art teacher Alfred Eber ling to study at his private art studio and also enrolled him to the Centre of Art Education for Children. Before the revolution, Eberling studied at the Ilya Repin’s atelier of the Academy of Fine Arts and was taught by the famous Franz Lehnbach in Vienna. He was a fashionable court artist and a typical metro politan Bohemian of the early twentieth century.\n\nTwice a week Zagonek drew plaster casts of male sitters. On Sundays he painted stilllives, portraits and nudes. The teach ing was not limited to professional training: driven by a desire to broaden his students’ horizons, the teacher organized meetings with prominent artists such as Anna Ostroumova-Lebedeva, Arkady Rylov and Vasily Shukhaev.\n\nIn 1939 Zagonek was conscripted. He participated in the SovietFinnish war and during the World War II he was the crew commander of an antiaircraft battery situated near Lenin grad. In late 1942 he demobilized and in 1945 was summoned by the Academy of Fine Arts to return to Leningrad. In 1946 Zagonek began his study at the personal atelier of Boris Iogan son at the Academy. The students grasped the skill of composition, studied how to render firsthand impressions from objects and mastered various art materials.\n\nZagonek began his diploma work in 1949. By that time he had become more drawn to landscape painting. On the basis of studies painted en plein air he created a composition called “Spring on the Collective Farm” in which he beautifully depict ed the atmosphere of awakening nature. The persuasiveness of the execution and the harmony of colour merited the highest grade and earned Zagonek the title of a Painter.\n\nDuring his study he acquired the essential professional knowl edge and skill which enable a creative person to realise his individuality. This was greatly enriched by his serious research of classical art at the Hermitage, the Russian State Museum and the Art Museum at the Academy. Among Zagonek’s teachers were many Masters of Painting such as Vasily Surikov, Valentin Serov, Isaac Levitan, Mikhail Nesterov, Konstantin Korovin and Igor Grabar.\n\nThe artist’s debut was an exhibition in 1952 when his land scape called “Spring Day” impressed its audience. Visitors re membered an image of joyous excitement in his colourful canvas. This first success inspired him and soon after he painted land scapes called “Flying Away” (1954) and “October” (1955). In them he aspired to capture the fleeting moment of first impression. Perceiving nature as a constantly changing living or ganism, Zagonek combined in his canvases the contrasting and mutually complementing elements of landscape: forest, fields, river, and skies which he often depicted with dramatic suspension.\n\nZagonek’s trip to the Lake Onega in 1955 became pivotal for shaping his now familiar artistic style. The nature of Northern Russia, the simplicity and purity of colours, the melodious breadth of panoramic views struck a cord in the artist’s heart. He fell in love with this region and painted numerous studies which served as material for future paintings such as “It is Getting Cold”, “On the Banks of Lake Onega” (both 1956) and “Dear Mountain Ash Tree” (1957). In the latter, according to Zagonek’s biographer G. Arbuzov, the artist conveyed the impression that “it is not only people who listen to the quietened nature but, nature itself, from the majestically rising moon to the trembling leaves of young aspen, listens to the inner thoughts of men.”\n\nHis accumulated experience allowed the artist to paint a brilliant composition called “Morning” (1960), which he took three years to complete. His methods of painting, typically suited to monumental murals, were dictated by the enormous size of the canvas. Art critics at the time remarked that through search for the best way to express himself Zagonek had found his own artistic manner, both individual and stylistically modern. His ability to breathe new life into traditional techniques is acutely revealed in his painting called “The Thunderstorm is Over” (1961) where he conveyed with great sincerity and warmth the sense of elation overcoming people after the devastating war.\n\nThese canvases, which reflected an entire historical era, brought their author great popularity. His influence grew and Zagonek was elected to the administrative board of the Union of Artists. He travelled considerably across the Soviet Union: to the Far North and the Far East, Lake Baikal, IssykKul, Crimea and the Baltic Republics. Zagonek’s art had a special connection with Staraya Ladoga. A small town, noted for its austere northern beauty, old fortress and churches towering above the fullflowing river Volkhov always attracted artists. The expanse of fields and forests with scattered villages and blue sparkling rivers under the transparent dome of the sky were close to Zagonek’s heart.\n\nHe used to spend more than three months a year, from spring to late autumn in Staraya Ladoga. Regardless of the season he went to the fields with his painting box or worked in the studio on a new painting. Here his style finally took shape. Zagonek always aspired to create paintings which he perceived as “strictly organized expressions of a big idea and the art of great philosophic generalization”. His habit to persevere in composition is apparent even in his sketches. Although a study, to his mind, was only an expression of a particular thought and only one part of a future creation, many of his sketches are works of art in their own right. Studies called “The Flowering Willow” (1958), “After the Rain” (1960), “Melt Water” (1965), “The Glittering Sun” (1966) and “Evening Field”(1969) were used as material for large canvases but are themselves accomplished art works.\n\nIn Staraya Ladoga he painted a series of landscapes such as “Winter Day” (1961), “The River Volkhov” (1962), “The Ice had Gone Morning” (1965) and “Winter Landscape with Robins” (1966). One of his most memorable paintings is called “The Spring” (1965). It captures the artist’s favourite theme: deep shadows on the mauve snow, strong rhythm of birch trees posing against the turquoise blue sky and a tractor crossing through the thick snow.\n\nGenre paintings called “The Flowering BirdCherry Tree” and “March Workdays” (both 1964), which Zagonek considered particularly important were also dedicated to spring. In his own words: “one can reveal the beauty in everything, even in something very simple and at first sight unattractive”. The subject matter of the painting is only a pretext for the poetic comprehension of the relationship between man and nature, and the quest for beauty in the surrounding world in all its manifestations.\n\nAfter being awarded the title of the Honorary Artist of Russia in 1965 Zagonek organized a solo exhibition – the result of fifteen years of his artistic work. The exhibition was shown in Warsaw, then in Moscow and Leningrad. Judging by the favour able reviews the exhibition became an outstanding event in his career. It struck the audience with its colourful, lively and sincere depiction of the world.\n\nComing to the end of this important period in his career, the artist could have been satisfied with his achievements: he had built his own artistic circle, he had developed his own style, and most of his paintings were acquired by the largest museums of Russia. But it was then, in the late 1960s, that the very concept of his artistic perception of nature changed its course, at first, ever so slightly, and then with increasing rigour.\n\nGradually, the prosaic and everyday content disappeared completely from his art. The idea of a storytelling painting was replaced by the concept of painting as a musical and lyrical poet ry. The earliest works featuring the poetic image of nature were the wonderful landscapes such as “The River Volkhov High Water Season” (1967), “The Baltic” (1967), “October Twi light” (1968) and others.\n\nHe used a compositional method, typical to his subsequent artistic period, whereby the panoramic image is transformed into a lively, interpenetrating superimposition of natural shapes. He built the correlated colour scheme not on the colour contrasts, but on a delicate harmony of light and shadow, cold and warm, that so precisely reflects the modest northern nature. One of the landscapes called “The Baltic”, which he particularly valued, invokes an incredible union of all elements of nature. It differs from his earlier works in the effortless fluency with which Zagonek operates. The spectacular motif transformation was not the most important element of painting for him. He valued the creation of an artistic image of nature, revealing the cultural wealth and not the mere formal values."
