Painting is the study for ”Mr. President (Richard Nixon)”, which resides in the National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, and was published in the 4 February 1969 issue of ”Look” magazine, captioned ”Weighed, yet buoyed, by the American past and present, Richard M. Nixon, 37th President, faces the future in this Rockwell portrait”.\n\nRockwell painted this study in late 1968 of then President-Elect Richard Nixon, a man whose portrait he found ”elusive” but whose features here are unmistakenly Nixon, revealing at the same time both the guardedness and warmth of the 37th President. As the premiere portraitist of the 20th century, one would expect no less from Rockwell. Oil on canvas measures 14” x 11”. Provenance is from Judy Goffman Fine Art of New York, and then subsequently the Charles E. Sigety Collection. Exhibited at the Mississippi Museum of Art in ”Norman Rockwell: The Great American Storyteller” from 2 March-15 May 1988, no. 64. Painting is in very good condition, with a stretcher bar mark along upper edge. Wax lined, with no inpainting. Sold for $125,000.\n\nConsign your Nikolai Efimovich Timkov art at Nate D.

The drawing, created circa 1882, is signed with the initial, ”R”. Renoir, who had been painting Parisian scenes for many years, saw his fame take off when, along with other Impressionist painters, including Monet, Degas and Cezanne, his work was represented in the first Impressionist Exhibition in 1874. He painted scenes of people at work and play, often painting women and girls. He was known for his free brush strokes and the warm sensuality present in the light and color of his palette.

Painted by the famed portrait artist who captured the likenesses of nearly all of the important statesmen of the 18th century, including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. This compelling 22.5″ x 27.5″ oil on canvas comes with a fascinating backstory. Since Bonaparte was unwilling to sit for any artists, Peale spent hours sketching the Emperor on public occasions, such as during the procession of deputies in the Champ de Mars where Bonaparte sat still for hours on end. Contrary to the famously romanticized, larger than life interpretations of the French dictator by such artists as Jacques-Louis David, here Peale offers a very human-scale Bonaparte. Peale employs a palette of muted burgundies and blacks, soft lighting and an echo of the background wine-colored drapery in Bonaparte’s scarf. Painting comes with a transcript of the letter Peale gave to artist Thomas Hollingsworth Morris, original owner of the portrait, datelined Philadelphia, 26 January 1858. Letter reads as follows: “Dear Sir, The Portrait you allude to, is an Original Study of the Head of Napoleon Bonaparte, which I made in Paris, in the Year 1812 (not when he was 1st Consul)–but Emperor). It was the result of many paintings, after seeing him at Reviews & other occasions – for he had decided never to sit to any Artist, after the design to assassinate him by Cerachi [sic] the Sculptor who was making a Bust of him–The same Cerachi who was in this Country & made a Bust of our Washington, which is more like Cerachi himself than like Washington. He was guilliotined [sic]. This Head, the effort of repeated Memories, David the Emperor’s Painter thought a good likeness. I am sorry you did not subscribe your address, as I should like to see this Portrait again when I visit Baltimore. Respectfully Yours, Rembrandt Peale (signed).” An excellent portrait of the legendary military genius by an American master portraitist. Excellent Rembrandt Peale painting. Sold for $32,000.\n\nAuction your Nikolai Efimovich Timkov art at Nate D. Sanders Auctions.

Benton, a leader of the regionalist movement, was a muralist, social critic and teacher of other artists, including Jackson Pollock. His subject matter honored everyday American life, often ordinary people, such as these workers, in the throes of hard work. Provenance: William Neuse, New York (acquired directly from the artist).
