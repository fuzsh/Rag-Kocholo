Inspired by the memories of their home town of Vladimir and the beauty of its landscape, these artists (who were educated at the Vladimir Art School) developed their own distinctive style. In the wake of the devastating war, this group was determined to present a bright and optimistic view, contrary to the strict academic standards dictated to artists within the Soviet system.\n\nThe emblematic qualities of Vladimir Landscape painting are the deep jewel tone colors, the thick passionate brush strokes, and the implied reality of the actual scene.

When I first visited him in his rooftop studio, I was immediately struck by the astonishing range of...\n\nSee Exhibition\n\nUK EXHIBITION\n\nChetkov both inherits and reinvents the traditions of Russian art. He was a bold experimenter who took artistic risks which resulted in the creation of original and stunning images. He developed his own unique unofficial artistic style. We could describe his work as a new hybrid of Fantastic Realism and Primitivism. Chetkov through the course of his life, and the depth and breadth of his expression, ultimately could be said to have created his own school which we can call...\n\nSee Exhibition"
