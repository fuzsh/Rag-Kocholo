        "text": "March 8th, 2020\n\nFort Worth Show of Antiques, Art & Jewelry, Fort Worth, Texas\n\nThe Fort Worth Show of Antiques, Art & Jewelry has a long history in this Texas city often referred to as Cowtown. A visit to this year’s three-day show in March made it clear that this is no swap meet in a dusty cow pasture. Much has changed in the 57-year history of this show, particularly this year when a new owner with a different vision took over the reins. Not only does the show have a new look and fresh feel, it also changed its name from the Fort Worth Show of Antiques & Art to the Fort Worth Show of Antiques, Art & Jewelry. The show is now under the direction of Andrea Canady of Naples, Florida, who rebranded the show to align with the Miami and Palm Beach shows that are also under the umbrella of her Luxe Events business.\n\nThe new direction produced a dazzling display of sparkling jewelry, museum-quality antiques, and spectacular works of original art by renowned artists interspersed with show staples of mid-century modern furniture, artisanal rugs and textiles, vintage silver, cut glass, and whimsical collectibles.\n\n“We had a very diverse group of exhibitors,” said Canady, who described the show as spanning “every genre, juxtaposing many periods and movements.”\n\nBut Canady’s inaugural Texas show was a victim of unfortunate timing. The March 6-8 show occurred just as fear of the COVID-19 outbreak was beginning to grip the country and shutdown orders were being put in place.\n\nAs a result, some exhibitors didn’t make it, and attendance was lower than anticipated, with a crowd of about 5000 over three days. The show featured 105 exhibitors.\n\n“People who did come loved what they saw and the mix of dealers,” she said. “I’ve had a ninety percent renewal, so I believe it will be better next year.”\n\nInspired by a quotation from Albert Einstein, “Look deep into nature and then you will understand everything better,” Green River Stone Company turns ancient fossil remains into stunning works of art. Geologists carefully sift through a company-owned quarry in an ancient lakebed in Wyoming to locate the most detailed fossils embedded 50 million years ago. The fossils and slabs of stone are taken to Green River’s laboratory in Logan, Utah, where artisans craft each piece into a work of art. This 36\" long Baena arenosa (turtle) fossil is in a 44\" x 28\" frame and was priced at $75,000.\n\nThe antiques show is a longstanding tradition in Fort Worth. It began in 1963 when Dolly Johnson brought together dealers and established a prototype for future shows in other locations. This show has also been identified as the oldest antiques show in the American West.\n\nThe show remained under the ownership of the Johnson family until 2009, when a descendant of the founder sold it to Fort Worth native Jan Orr-Harter, an antiques dealer.\n\nThroughout its history, the show has been held at the Will Rogers Memorial Center, home of the annual Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo and an important and popular hosting site for equestrian and livestock shows and competitions.\n\nOver the years, the show evolved from a focus on American and farmhouse primitives to a broader range of antiques and collectibles from different eras. Orr-Harter added art to the mix of antiques, which grew to include English and Continental pieces as well as Americana.\n\nWith nearly 30 years of experience in antiques event management, Canady was eager to take over from Orr-Harter, who was ready to retire after ten years.\n\nCanadian-born fine jewelry designer and dealer Rebecca Koven of New York City shows off a breathtaking Art Deco 1920s jeweled necklace. The piece features 60 carats of diamonds and 60 carats of Burmese rubies. The necklace can be worn as a necklace or separated into three pieces that can be worn separately as brooches. The asking price was $250,000 for the estate piece.\n\nCanady’s introduction to antiques show management began when the owner of the Original Miami Beach Antique Show hired her away from a customer service job at a bank to assist him. Her career includes extensive show production experience with U.S. Antique Shows and serving as director of business development with the Palm Beach Show Group.\n\nCanady acquired the Fort Worth show with a goal of elevating the quality of the show with more expensive merchandise and a more upscale image. She brought in carpet to cover the bare floors and required all exhibitors to cover their display tables and peg boards.\n\nAnother addition was an opening night preview party at the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame, featuring food and drinks as well as early access to the redesigned show.\n\nMany of Canady’s regular exhibitors at her Florida shows and at shows she was involved with in the past in other parts of the country followed her to Fort Worth. The addition of jewelry for the first time was a popular choice among those who attended the show, and exhibitors were pleased to enjoy robust sales, which made the trip worthwhile for them, she said.\n\n“Overall, it was very successful,” Canady said. “Many dealers did well even though attendance was not quite what we had expected. That was definitely because of the virus.”\n\nFor more information, see the Luxe Events website (www.luxeshowevents.com).\n\nTom Wester of The Wester Gallery, a third-generation art dealer in Atlanta, Georgia, specializes in top-quality Tiffany lamps and contemporary art.
