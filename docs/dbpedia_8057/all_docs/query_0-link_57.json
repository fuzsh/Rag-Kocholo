MS 24\n\nIt is a 12th-century English illuminated manuscript, as is The Ashmole Bestiary\n\nIt consists of 103 folios measuring , 30.2 cm (height) 21 cm (width)\n\nIt is made of parchment (probably goatskin or sheepskin)\n\nThe calligraphy (not specified), probably littera textualis formata\n\nThe Aberdeen Bestiary includes an illustrated cycle of the Creation\n\nCodex: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex\n\nSources:\n\nAberdeen Bestiary (Wikipedia);\n\nAberdeen Bestiary (Aberdeen University Project & The Medieval Bestiary).\n\nBestiaries\n\nBestiaries are allegorical illuminated manuscripts in which animals, plants and stones are therefore given a symbolic meaning. Bestiaries differ from Books of Hours and other illuminated manuscripts in that they are not devotional or liturgical in meaning. However, they are moralizing in tone and reflect the ideology of early Christianity. As indicated in Wikipedia’s entry, three days after their death, pelicans give their very blood to bring back to life their dead offsprings, just as Christ rose from the dead three days after his crucifixion, a martyrdom and death he suffered to redeem flawed and sinful humanity.\n\nThe meaning of each animal — I am excluding plants and stones — is pre-determined as each possess the attributes given in a\n\n2nd-century BCE, a Greek compilation entitled the Physiologus.\n\nOther sources are:\n\nRabanus Maurus (c. 780 – 4 February 856) the author of the encyclopaedia De rerum naturis (On the Nature of Things) and De Universo, moralisations added to Isidore’s Etymologies;\n\nIsidore of Seville (c. 560 – 4 April 636 CE), the author of Etymologiae;\n\nSaint Ambrose (c. 340 – 4 April 397 CE), a father of the Church and the author of the Hexæmeron, a fourth century commentary on the six days of creation;\n\nearly third-century Gaius Julius Solinus, the author of De mirabilibus mundi also known as the Collectanea rerum memorabilium (‘Collection of Curiosities’), and Polyhistor, a third-century travel guide, incorporating much of Pliny’s Natural History;\n\n2nd-century Claudius Aelianus or Aelian, who authored On the Nature of Animals.\n\nOther and older sources are:\n\nPliny the Elder, or Gaius Plinius Secundus (23 CE – August 25, 79 CE), the author of a Naturalis Historia; Greek philosopher\n\nAristotle (384 BCE – 322 BCE), the author of Historia Animalium;\n\nHerodotus, the author of Histories, who lived in the fifth century BC (c. 484 – 425 BCE) and is considered the “Father of History.”\n\nAlthough the treatises of these gentlemen imposed a meaning on animals, they were not necessarily discussing real animals. In fact, among the animals featured in Bestiaries some do not exist or have a poetical reality: the unicorn, the phœnix, the dragon and the griffin are legendary animals and at least two, the unicorn and the dragon are cross-cultural beasts and two of which straddle the mythical and the mythological: the griffin and the phœnix. The others, such as the mythological Centaur, half man, half horse and, therefore, a zoomorphic as well as a mythological animal. In fact, even “real” animals have fantastical attributes. “Real” bears do not lick their cubs into shape.\n\nChrist in Majesty, (F4v)\n\nCreation, (F2r)\n\nChrist in Majesty\n\nHowever, there is a sense in which Christ in Majesty (F4v) belongs to a bestiary. The mythologies I am familiar with all feature Creation tales. Amerindians believed in a Manitou and the Haida Amerindians of the northwest Pacific Coast carve(d) totem poles that suggested animal ancestry, which may point to a belief in evolutionism, except that, as I have already mentioned, Amerindians also had a Manitou (as in Manitoba). These totem poles were at times so beautiful that patrons commissioned Totem poles as Jean de France (30 November 1340 – 15 June 1416) commissioned his Très Riches Heures. (See Totem poles, Wikipedia.)\n\nThe Aberdeen Bestiary\n\nThe Paper: Parchment, but not vellum (calfskin)\n\nThe Aberdeen Bestiary (Aberdeen University Library, Univ Lib. MS 24)[i] is a 12th century English illuminated manuscript bestiary. It was first listed in 1542 in the inventory of the Old Royal Library at the Palace of Westminster in 1542. (See Aberdeen, History.) It was made on parchment (parchemin), which means that the paper used by the artists and scribes was probably sheepskin or goatskin. Although calfskin is called parchment, vellum (calfskin) is the superior parchment, and when vellum is used, the paper is called vellum. This does not lessen the quality of the Aberdeen Bestiary.\n\nFrom the Old Royal Library to the Aberdeen University, via Thomas Reid\n\nThe history of the illuminated manuscript is somewhat mysterious. According to scholars and researchers involved in the Aberdeen Project, the manuscript was listed as No 518 Liber de bestiarum natura in the inventory of the Old Royal Library, at Westminster Palace (1542). This library was assembled by Henry VIII (28 June 1491 – 28 January 1547), with the assistance of antiquary John Leland, to house manuscripts and documents rescued from the dissolution of the monasteries. However, the manuscript may have been part of the royal collection. Many books “escaped” from the Royal Library. (See Aberdeen, History.)\n\nThe Aberdeen Bestiary was probably given to Thomas Reid[ii] by Patrick Young, the son of Royal Librarian, Sir Peter Young. Thomas Reid was Regent of Marischal College, Aberdeen and Latin Secretary to James VI. As for Thomas Reid, he gave the precious illuminated manuscript, along with about 1350 books and manuscripts, to Marischal College in 1624-1625. In the 1720s, the books of Marischal College Library were reorganised into presses and the Aberdeen Bestiary was catalogued MS M 72, in 1726. When the Library was catalogued by Thomas Gray in c. 1670, the book had the shelfmark 2.B.XV Sc. Excisions were first recorded at that time, but mutilations stopped. “When Marischal College amalgamated with Aberdeen University in 1860, the Bestiary became part of the University collection[,]” which is probably the moment when the Aberdeen Bestiary acquired the shelfmark MS 24. (See Aberdeen Bestiary, Wikipedia.) However, this may not be exact as there is disagreement among scholars. (See Aberdeen, History.)\n\nSources\n\nIsidori physiologia: Isidore of Seville‘s Etymologiae\n\nWhen the Library was catalogued by Thomas Gray in c. 1670, the Aberdeen Bestiary was called Isidori physiologia, which suggests that many descriptions of animals were borrowed from Isidore of Seville rather than the compiler of the Physiologus. Isidore of Seville is the author of several books, the most famous of which is the Etymologiae, 184,[iii] “an encyclopedia of all knowledge.” (See Aberdeen, History.)\n\nThe Artist or Artists and the Patron\n\nThe Artist or artists: The Ashmole or Ashmolean Bestiary\n\nWe do not know who illuminated the Aberdeen Bestiary, but experts believe that the miniatures of the Aberdeen Bestiary were painted by the same artist, or artists, as the miniatures that adorn the Ashmole Bestiary. The Ashmole Bestiary[iv] (Bodleian Library [Oxford University] MS. Ashmole 1511) is a late 12th or early 13th century English illuminated manuscript Bestiary containing a creation story and detailed allegorical descriptions of over 100 animals. The anonymous artist probably lived near his patron, in Lincolnshire or Yorkshire.\n\nAs for the Patron of MS 24, the Aberdeen Bestiary, he is believed to have been an ecclesiastic on the basis of F32r (turtle doves), F34r (cedars of Lebanon). It seems our patron was Geoffrey Plantagenet, the illegitimate son of King Henry II and therefore half-brother to Kings Richard and John. Geoffrey Plantagenet was Bishop-elect of Lincoln (1173-82) and later Archbishop of York (1189-1212). Moreover, he owned the St Louis Psalter (Leiden U.L. MS 76A), which means he was wealthy. Luxurious illuminated manuscripts were usually commissioned by members of royal families.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen I discovered the Aberdeen Bestiary site, I felt I should perhaps refrain from writing a post on this famous bestiary. A few Aberdeen Bestiary illuminated folios are online. They can be investigated at leisure but images posted on the Bestiary cannot be used without violating copyright legislation. Fortunately Wikipedia has a site containing a good selection of the Aberdeen Wiki Commons.\n\nThere was an exceptional interest for animal fables and beast epics beginning with the publication of Nivardus of Ghent’s 1148 or 1149 Ysengrimus. The Ysengrimus (6,574 lines of elegiac couplet) is Reynard the Fox ‘s birthplace. Reynard is called Reinardus and his foe, the wolf, Ysengrimus. In Reynard the Fox, they become Reynard and Isengrim (Renart and Ysengrin [FR]). However, although the animals inhabiting medieval Beast Epics and Fables are anthropomorphic, i.e. humans in disguise, the wolf looks like a wolf and the fox, like a fox.\n\nHowever, in illuminated Bestiaries not only are animals fanciful, but they are often grotesquely obscene. In fact, when I was a student, the various Reynard the Fox beast epics were not even mentioned in the curriculum. Nor were Bestiaries. If one visits Beverley Minster, in Beverley (Yorkshire), one wonders whether parents should allow their children to see the cathedral’s misericords. I was copiously entertained, but I was also busy looking up members of my husband’s ancestors several of whom have found their final resting place in Beverley Minster.\n\nBestiaries were commissioned by the wealthy for the wealthy and were not intended for children. Children were probably told children Æsop’s fables as these passed down from generation to generation in an oral rather than learned (written) tradition. In fact, bestiaries circulated in courtly milieux next to the Roman de la Rose, c. 1230, part of which Chaucer translated into English. Let us pause here.\n\nTiny Gallery\n\nI cannot copy images from the Aberdeen Library site as I would be in violation of copyright laws.

But there is some disagreement with respect to the authorship of the texts included in the Physiologus. The Physiologus “is ascribed to one or other of the 4th-century bishops Basil and Epiphanius.” Peter of Alexandria, Basil, John Chrysostom, Athanasius, Ambrose, and Jerome; even pre-Christian authors like Solomon and Aristotle were said to have written parts of it (Curley, p. xvi). (See Medieval Bestiary)\n\nHowever, for our purposes, we need simply know that “medieval bestiaries ultimately are derived from the Greek Physiologus.”[ii] but that India “may also be a source:”\n\nSome Indian influence is clear—for example, in the introduction of the elephant and of the Peridexion tree, actually called Indian in the Physiologus. India may also be the source of the story of the unicorn, which became very popular in the West.[iii]\n\nThe Popularity & Dissemination of the Physiologus\n\nThe Physiologus may not have been as popular as the Bible, but nearly so. “It was translated into Latin (first in the 4th or 5th century), Ethiopian, Syriac, Arabic, Coptic, and Armenian. Early translations from the Greek also were made into Georgian and into Slavic languages.”[iv] It was then translated into several other languages. However, the symbolism attached to these allegorical animals may have changed and new symbols may have been added as various manuscripts wound their way through translations and possible “editions” of some original Physiologus. A thousand years elapsed between the publication of the Physiologus and that of the Aberdeen Bestiary.\n\nAccording to Britannica, The Physiologus would have “48 sections, each dealing with one creature, plant, or stone and each linked to a biblical text.” As for animals featured in the Physiologus, they are listed in Wikipedia. In its list, Wikipedia names the dragon and the unicorn, both of whom are “fantastic” animals, as are the griffin, the phœnix, and other animals . (See Physiologus, Wikipedia and Medieval Bestiary)\n\nThe Dragon, the Griffin, the Unicorn, and the Phoenix\n\nIn the Oxford Dictionary of Classical Myth & Religion, the Physiologus is described as “an exposition of the marvellous properties of some 50 animals, plants and stones, with a Christian interpretation of each.”[v] In this statement, the key word is “marvellous.” It matches the word used to describe the “fantastic” aspects of certain documents dating back to the French Middle Ages. Several mediavelists speak of the “merveilleux [marvellous] chrétien.”\n\nTruth be told, among animals described in the Physiologus, some do not exist. The dragon and the unicorn, who are listed in Wikipedia’s entry on the Physiologus, are legendary animals that I call “mythical animals.” There are other mythical animals, two of whom are the afore-mentioned dragon and unicorn, but the Physiologus does not feature the phœnix, a mythical creature who was adopted as a symbol in Early Christianity. Nor does it mention the griffin. However, somehow I discovered the above fresco of the griffin while reading about the Physiologus. It is so lovely that I could not resist inserting it in this post. Although there are several mythical animals, the dragon, the griffin, the phœnix, and the unicorn are the more familiar. They are the four animals I call “mythical animals.”\n\nMythical vs Mythological Animals\n\nMythical animals may inhabit mythologies, east and west, but unlike the Minotaur of Greek mythology, they are legendary beasts who do not have a lineage. In this regard, they differ from Greek mythology’s Minotaur who is the son of a bull and Phasiphaë, the daughter of Helios and the wife of Theseus, the mythical and mythological — Greek mythology — founder-king of Athens. As for Pegasus, the winged horse, he is the offspring of Poseidon and Medusa. However, among the fifty or so beast Physiologus depicts, there is a Centaur, a zoomorphic — half human, half horse — mythological animal as well as the Siren of Greek mythology.\n\n(please click on the image to enlarge it)\n\n*F. J. Bertuch\n\n(please click on the image to enlarge it)\n\n*Jean-Étienne Ramey\n\nA Poetical Reality\n\nThe reality of these “fantastic” animals is poetical. It is the reality that J. K. Rowling used when she wrote the Harry Potter series. For instance, she featured the mythical phœnix, who is described in the Physiologus as an animal that rises from its own ashes and therefore represents Christ rising from the dead three days after his crucifixion. Similarly, the legendary pelican kills its off springs and, three days later, revives them by feeding them her blood.[viii] The author of the Physiologus may have borrowed from “pagan” sources, but his interpretation of the 50 animals, plants and stones is a Christian interpretation, which would suit medieval and Christian authors of bestiaries and artists depicting the fanciful animals bestiaries featured.\n\nThe animals featured in the Physiologus are in fact all the more “marvellous” and poetical in that they are zoomorphic, i.e. combining human and animal features, which is the case with the Centaur. But mythical and mythological animals may also combine the features of several animals, which is the case with Pegasus, the winged horse. However, whatever their appearance, these animals all stand for human beings or all symbolize human attributes. They are not humans in disguise, but allegorical or animals depicting mankind.\n\nConclusion\n\nI wanted to write on the Aberdeen Bestiary, but many of the animals featured in the Aberdeen Bestiary originate in the Physiologus, as does the symbolism attached to them. It would appear that the “religious sections of the Physiologus (and of the bestiaries derived from the Physiologus) are concerned primarily with abstinence and chastity; they also warn against heresies.”[ix]\n\nHowever, what is most fascinating about these animals is that they are part of our world. They are fanciful and the iconography attached to them, mostly delightful, but it could be that we actually need the phœnix. If the phœnix rises from its ashes, we can also rise again, whatever ordeal has befallen us. As for the pelicans who stretch maternal love to the point of reviving dead off springs by feeding them their blood, they are quintessential motherhood. In other words, both the Physiologus and bestiaries it inspired tell our story, and that story is one we created.\n\nThe Physiologus is an “illuminated” manuscript. Artists and scribes transformed it into a work of art. Second-century artists may have used techniques that differ from the manner in which the Book of Kells and the Aberdeen Bestiary are illuminated, but the Lascaux Cave is a splendid testimonial to a motivation to “picture” our world and, in particular, the animals we require. Several manuscripts of the Physiologus have survived. The Bern Physiologus may well be the most notorious extant illuminated manuscript of the Physiologus.

On the 4th of September 476, Romulus Augustus, the last Emperor of the Western Roman Empire, was deposed by Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain. The collapse of the Western Roman Empire occurred gradually as nomadic tribes: Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Vikings, Vandals, Franks, Gauls, etc. invaded the various regions the Romans had conquered.\n\nThe new age, known as the Middle Ages and, pejoratively, as the “dark ages,” would last until the 15th century CE and was not entirely dark. In Western European countries, it was the golden age of illuminated manuscripts, many of which featured fanciful and even mythical beasts and are called bestiaries.\n\nIt would appear that Celtic monks were among the first artists to produce illuminated manuscripts, but the movement spread south and reached a pinnacle in the 15th century, in the current Netherlands, then known as the Franco-Flemish or Burgundian lands.\n\nThe Fall of the Byzantine Empire and the invention of the printing press\n\nHowever, a thousand years after the fall of the Roman Empire, in 1453, the Byzantine Empire fell to the Ottoman Turks and, three years earlier, in 1450, the printing press had been invented. These two events changed the course of history. The fall of the Byzantine Empire brought about a rebirth (Renaissance) in European culture and it so happens that Johannes Gutenberg (c. 1395 – 3 February 1468) invented the printing press as the Greek scholars of the Byzantine Empire fled west, first to Italy, carrying precious Greek manuscripts. So the invasion of the Byzantine Empire, by the Ottoman Turks, the last invasion, ushered in a new age. Europe entered its Renaissance (literally: rebirth) and, as it did, works that had been hand copied mostly by monks in the scriptorium of monasteries would henceforth be printed at a rapid rate, putting an end, however, to the long reign of illuminated manuscripts.\n\nThe reign of illuminated manuscripts had, indeed, been a long one. The Book of Kells, a Gospel book in Latin, was created by Celtic Monks in c. 800. The Book of Kells is the finest illuminated manuscript belonging to Insular or Hiberno-Saxon art, the art of the British Isles, and predates the Très Riches Heures de Jean de France, Duc de Berry (c. 1412 and 1416), a Book of Hours. Moreover, the Book of Kells had antecedents. It was a pinnacle.\n\nTitian, Tiziano Vecelli or Tiziano Vecellio (c. 1488/1490 – 27 August 1576)\n\nThe Printing Press\n\nJohannes Gutenberg invented the printing press in 1450. (See Johannes Gutenberg, Wikipedia.) The Pope (1458 – 1464), Pius II (18 October 1405 – 14 August 1464) was delighted because the Bible could be printed quickly and disseminated widely. However, despite the invention of the printing press, illuminated manuscripts had a period of grace. Between 1450 and 1501, books could be printed, but blank spaces were left so the book could be illuminated. Books printed during this fifty-year period are called “incunables.”\n\nThe Aberdeen Bestiary\n\nMedieval Beast Literature: two traditions\n\nBut the Aberdeen Bestiary, one of several medieval bestiaries, was not an incunable and it belonged to one of at least two traditions in beast literature and visual arts. Medieval beast literature includes allegorical bestiaries, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, beast epics and fables originating, to a greater or lesser extent, in India’s Panchatantra, written in the 3rd century BCE, if not earlier. The Panchatantra could belong to a learned tradition stemming from an oral, i.e. unwritten, tradition.\n\nThe Aberdeen Bestiary: an Allegory\n\nThe Aberdeen Bestiary (Aberdeen University Library, Univ Lib. MS 24) is a 12th-century English illuminated manuscript bestiary that was first listed in 1542 in the inventory of the Old Royal Library at the Palace of Westminster. Bestiaries[i] are not Gospel books, nor are they Books of Hours. They are allegories, which means that each beast, plant or stone is a symbol. Britannica defines allegories as “a symbolic fictional narrative.”[ii] For instance, in Western literature, the Unicorn, a fantastical animal, represents Christ and the Phœnix, an immortal bird, represents the resurrection of Christ. Each animal is a symbol.\n\nReynard the Fox & Fables\n\nWorldly Wisdom\n\nHowever, as bestiaries — allegorical texts — flourished, so did various beast epics and fables. As noted above, this tradition is rooted, to a significant extent, in the Sanskrit Pañcatantra, [iii] attributed to Vishnu Sharma, translated into Pahlavi in 570 CE (AD), by Borzūya, and into Arabic, in 750 CE, by Persian scholar Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa. Ibn al-Muqaffa’s translation is entitled Kalīlah wa Dimnah. A 12th-century version became known as Kalīleh o Demneh and would be the basis of Ḥoseyn Wāʿeẓ-e Kāshefī,[iv] or Kāshefī‘s 15th century the Lights of Canopus and The Fables of Bidpai (The Morall Philosophie of Doni [English, 1570]. (See Panchatantra, Wikipedia.)\n\nBidpai is the storyteller. Moreover, several Æsopic fables and the many versions of Reynard the Fox (Le Roman de Renart FR) are associated with that tradition, but not completely. Æsop (c. 620–564 BCE), if indeed there was an Æsop, did borrow from Bidpai, but he also drew from several other sources. In his second volume of fables, Jean de La Fontaine retold fables by Bidpai. His source was, in all likelihood, Kāshefī’s Lights of Canopus, translated by Gilbert Gaulmin, a pseudonym, and entitled Le Livre des lumières ou La Conduite des Rois (1644). (See Pañcatantra FR, Wikipedia.)\n\nThe Education of the Prince\n\nInterestingly, tales stemming from the five books of the Pañcatantra (pancha: five; tantra: treatises) are, first and foremost, about “the wise conduct of life,” i.e. a nītiśāstra, and, consequently, closer to Machiavelli‘s Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli [3 May 1469 – 21 June 1527]) Prince than to allegorical medieval bestiaries. (See Pañcatantra, Wikipedia.)\n\nReynard the Fox, first written in the 12th century, is filled with trickster tales and tales pointing to the need to consider the consequences of one’s actions, the moral of countless fables. Fables are moralizing, but in a worldly fashion, as befits stories that will guide a prince. As mentioned above, the Panchatantra, or Pañcatantra, has been linked to Machiavelli’s Prince. Yet, the Pañcatantra is not unethical, nor, for that matter, is The Prince, if one keeps in mind that the world Machiavelli lived in was factious and that his prince would have to live in that very world. Machiavelli had worked for the Medici family who were bloodthirsty and in whose quest for power “the end justifie[d] the means.”\n\nAnimals, Plants and Stones as Symbols\n\nThere are, nevertheless, similarities between the allegorical bestiary, where animals are symbols, and beast stories rooted, in part, in the Pañcatantra. In both traditions animals are anthropomorphic. The word anthromorphism is derived from the Greek ánthrōpos, meaning human, and morphē, meaning shape. In other words, literary beast are humans in disguise and, in both traditions, they are also stereotypes. The fox is wily and the phœnix symbolizes the resurrection of Christ.\n\nHowever, bestiaries differ from Reynard the Fox. In bestiaries, we have zoomorphic animals, or animals that combine human and animal features (satyrs, the Centaur and the Minotaur of Greek mythology) or animals that combine the features of many animals (Pegasus, the winged horse). In other words, our allegorical animals are as fanciful as many of Jacobus de Voragine‘s saints and martyrs. Strictly rather than poetically speaking, there is no St George. Moreover, strictly rather than poetically speaking, there are no unicorns, griffins, or dragons. Yet, fantastic animals, the phœnix, unicorns, griffins, dragons, mermaids, and others, are the denizens of bestiaries and have a reality of their own, a poetical, symbolic reality. However, they are not talking animals.\n\nFanciful or “Fantastic” Animals\n\nMost of the artists who created illuminated bestiaries had never seen the animals they depicted. In fact, historians themselves relied on the reports of travelers, from ancient Greece down to Marco Polo (15 September 1254 – 9 January 1324). The Travels of Marco Polo (Il Milione and Le Livre des merveilles du monde) and the accounts of other travelers no doubt contained descriptions of animals, but a picture is worth a thousand words. There is a Marco Polo sheep, but it could be that a traveler described an animal with one horn, not two. That animal might have been a rhinoceros, a real animal, but, short of a picture, our animal could take on characteristics that transformed it into a unicorn, a mythical, or fantastical, animal.\n\nThe Physiologus: A Source\n\nTherefore, our artists based their illuminations mostly on descriptions found in books. Their most important source was a 2nd-century CE Greek book entitled the Physiologus. In the Physiologus, the pelican feeds her young with her own blood, the phœnix rises from its own ashes, etc. These “animals” were symbols before entering medieval bestiaries. Authors of bestiaries also borrowed from Isidore of Seville‘s (c. 560 – 4 April 636) Etymologiae or Origins. Finally, although they may not have been accurate, there were books on animals written by historians. The main ones are listed in From Bestiaries to… Harry Potter.\n\nConclusion\n\nI must close, but we have the backdrop.

Hoarfrost, 1969\n\nNikolai Timkov’s Winters\n\nNikolai Timkov often depicted winter. However, the painting above is a fine but very personal portrayal of winter. As we will see, it is reminiscent of the “lyrical landscapes” of nineteenth-century Russia. Moreover, it can be associated with impressionism, a French art movement that flourished during the last two decades of the nineteenth century.\n\nYet, the creator of this winter landscape, Nikolai Timkov, is a twentieth-century artist, born at settlement of Nakhichevanskaya Dacha, close to Rostov-on-Don, in the Russian Empire. He studied art at the Repin Institute of Arts and graduated in 1939. Four years later, he became a member of the Leningrad Union of Artists (St Petersburg), beginning in 1943. Although Tomkin has explored other areas of painting, such as genre art, the portrayal of people engaged in everyday activity, he is known mainly for his lyrical landscapes.\n\nRussian Lyrical Landscapes\n\nAlexei Savrasov (24 May 1830 – 8 October 1897) is the creator of this mellow style that also characterizes the art of Isaac Levitan‘s (30 August 1860 – 4 August 1900) mood landscape. So how is the above painting, by Timkov, a lyrical landscape? Well, Timkov has colored winter in a lyrical or poetical manner. For him winter is essentially blue. In this regard, “Russian Winter. Hoarfrost” resembles the paintings associated with impressionism, an art movement developed in France in the final decades of the nineteenth century.\n\nImpressionism\n\nImpressionism was a French art movement, but it had considerable influence outside France. Its masters are Monet, Renoir, Degas, Pissaro, Manet, Sisler, Berthe Morisot, Marie Bracquemont, American-born Mary Cassat, etc. Starting with Cézanne, Gauguin and Van Gogh, who are labelled post-impressionists, paintings present distortions, but were otherwise precise.\n\nHowever, the goal of earlier impressionists was to convey the essence of the object or subject they depicted: landscapes, still lifes, persons, etc. Such a goal can lead to a more personal depiction of objects or subjects, but during the early years of the movement, works produced by impressionists were characterized by a degree of imprecision. They were impressions and “suggestions” of objects or subjects.\n\nThe Colour Blue\n\nBut let us return to Timkov. Timkov provides us with mostly realistic paintings, i.e. the various components of his paintings are not impressions. Yet, in one painting, Russian Winter. Hoarfrost, he has transformed a winter landscape into a study in blue, where details are a relatively secondary element. For instance, there are very few details to his trees. Timkov uses little black or indigo lines that “suggest” branches and give depth to the landscape. Moreover, to the right of the painting, we see roofs and houses. They are almost imperceptible unless one looks closely, but they “suggest” the presence of a village and, because they are small, they too give depth, or perspective, to the painting.\n\nAs for the river, in the foreground, Timkov has used a very dark blue to carve it out of the canvas. This dark blue lends the painting a very firm and mostly horizontal base, except to the right, where the river bends in the direction of the village. There is texture to the river and to every component of the painting. The river, its shore or banks, the foliage of the tree, all combine a dark and paler shade of the same blue. This confers not only texture to the painting, but also dimensionality, particularly the trees. The same is true of the banks and the sky.\n\nYet, this painting is mainly monochromatic: shades of blue, and it cannot be considered a truly realistic portrayal of winter. It is not foggy or blurry, but it is nevertheless an impression of winter and subjective. In this one painting, Timkov’s winter is essentially blue, which gives Russian Winter. Hoarfrost a certain intimacy. This is not winter; this is Timkov’s Russian winter.\n\nIf the painting were realistic, a little blue would help shape the snow. But fir trees, the evergreens, would be green, and deciduous trees would not have foliage, which they do in Timkov’s painting, blue foliage.\n\nAs a result, the painting is both representational: a landscape, and fanciful and poetical, or an impression of winter seen as essentially blue and, therefore, a subjective impression.\n\ncomposer: Dmitri Shostakovich (25 September 1906 – 9 August 1975)\n\npiece: Valse N° 2\n\n© Micheline Walker\n\nFebruary 19, 2013\n\nWordPress\n\nGiorgione, born Giorgio Barbarelli da Castelfranco (c. 1477/8–1510)\n\nTitian, born Tiziano Vecelli or Tiziano Vecellio (c. 1488/1490 – 27 August 1576)\n\n(Italian High Renaissance)\n\nPastorals: a Genre and a Movement\n\nPan is the “Greek god of the wild, shepherds and flocks, nature, of mountain wilds, hunting and rustic music, and companion of the nymphs” (Pan, Wikipedia) whose Roman counterpart is Faunus as well as Lupercus, the God of Shepherds.\n\nGreek and Roman Antiquity: Theocritus and Virgil\n\nPan is also the god of all things “pastoral,” such as pastoral music. The Pastorale is a form of Italian music and the word “pastoral” is also used to describe Beethoven’s 6th symphony. Moreover, there is a pastoral literature.\n\nPastoral literature is rooted in Greek and Roman Antiquity, as is the Lupercalia. Its two Greek and Roman authors are Theocritus[i] (born c. 300 bc, Syracuse, Sicily [Italy]—died after 260 bc), the creator of pastoral poetry[ii], and Virgil.[iii] Virgil or Vergil wrote not only the Aeneid, but also the Egloges or Bucolics and the Georgics. The Egloges can be read online at Egloges, a Gutenberg publication.\n\nCloser to us pastoral literature begins with Battista Guarini‘s bucolic tragicomedy Il Pastor Fido[iv] (1580 to 1585), The Faithful Shepherd, set in Arcadia, literally, a region of Greece; metaphorically, an idyllic countryside.\n\nLa Préciosité: French 17th-Century Salons\n\nMoreover, pastoral, also describes the “perfect” world of 17th-century salonniers and salonnières who made believe they were shepherds and shepherdesses. Préciosité was escapism at its worst or its best, depending on one’s point of view. Seventeenth-century Précieuses (literally, precious) put such a high price on marriage and sexuality, that they often made suitors wait a very long time. French dramatist Molière[v] ridiculed the Précieuses in Les Précieuses ridicules (Théâtre du Petit-Bourbon, 18 November 1659).\n\nPréciosité was a lifestyle. It was courtly love carried to an extreme, i.e. platonic love precluding sexuality. Préciosité is therefore at the opposite end of the Lupercalia which celebrated fertility. Lupercus was god of shepherds, but not the imaginary shepherds and shepherdesses of précieux convention, nor the raucous Luperci of the Lupercalia, but Christopher Marlowe‘s well-mannered yet “passionate” shepherd, associated with courtly love, idyllic love that does not exclude sexuality.\n\nChristopher Marlowe’s Shepherds and Sheperdhesses\n\nThe Passionate Shepherd to his Love by Christopher Marlowe (baptised on 26 February 1564 – 30 May 1593) is perhaps the most celebrated of English pastoral poems:\n\nCome live with me and be my Love,\n\nAnd we will all the pleasures prove\n\nThat hills and valleys, dale and field,\n\nAnd all the craggy mountains yield.\n\nThere will we sit upon the rocks\n\nAnd see the shepherds feed their flocks,\n\nBy shallow rivers, to whose falls\n\nMelodious birds sing madrigals.\n\n(Pastoral, Wikipedia)\n\nMarie-Antoinette & Geoffrey Chaucer\n\nEarlier in my new career as blogger, I wrote a post about Marie-Antoinette, an accomplished musician who composed a lovely “pastorale” that straddles the less rigid conventions of courtly love and Christopher Marlowe’s “The Passionate Shepherd to his Love.” Courtly love’s masterpiece, sometimes considered too daring, is the Roman de la Rose, The Romaunt of the Rose, an allegory of love translated, though not in its entirety, by Geoffrey Chaucer.\n\nValentine’s Day\n\nChaucer (c. 1343 – 25 October 1400) can in fact be credited with the birth of Valentine’s Day as we know it, a matter discussed in my next post. However, Chaucer was influenced by a tapestry, La Dame à la licorne (The Lady and the Unicorn), housed at the Cluny Museum, in Paris. The Unicorn is a mythical animal that can only be captured by a virgin. However, the Unicorn is also a trans–cultural figure, hence multi-faceted.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\n“C’est mon ami,” composed by Marie Antoinette (michelinewalker.com)\n\nTea at Trianon: C’est mon ami (Elena Maria Vidal)\n\nThe Lady and the Unicorn: the Six Senses (michelinewalker.com)\n\nThe Lady and the Unicorn: a Tapestry (michelinewalker.com)\n\n_________________________\n\n[i] “Theocritus”.

Amulius had seized power from his brother Numitor and had forced Rhea Silvia, Numitor’s daughter, to become a Vestal Virgin so she would not bear children.\n\nAfter the birth of Romulus and Remus, Amulius threw the babies into the river Tiber and sent their mother to jail. However, Romulus and Remus were saved by shepherds and fed by a she-wolf, Lupa, in a cave called Lupercal, perhaps located at the foot of Palatine Hill. They were then discovered by Faustulus, a shepherd.\n\nThe feral twins killed Amulius when they learned about their mother, but Romulus killed Remus who wanted Rome founded on Aventile Hill rather than Palatine Hill. Whence, the existence of Lupercus (from lupus: wolf), the Roman god of shepherds, and that of the Lupercalia, a yearly Roman festival honoring Lupa.\n\nLupercalia & Candlemas\n\nIn ancient Rome, the Lupercalia (Lupercus) took place between February 13th and 15th. This “pagan” feast is sometimes associated with Candlemas, celebrated on February 2nd, using the Gregorian calendar as opposed to the Julian calendar, called O.S., old style. In the Gregorian calendar, feasts were celebrated about 12 days earlier, than in the Julian calendar. The Eastern Church reflects this discrepancy.\n\nAs we will see, there was a motivation to transform the Lupercalia into a Christian feast. However, the Lupercalia endured until the 5th century CE and was celebrated beginning on the Ides of February, i.e. the 13th, ending two days later, on the 15th.\n\nAt the start of the Lupercalia, two goats and a dog were sacrificed. Next, two young Luperci, members of a corporation of priests, were led to the altar and anointed with the blood of the sacrificed animals. Luperci then dressed themselves in thongs, called februa, taken from skin of the of the sacrificed goats and dog and ran around the walls of the old Palatine city carrying thongs and striking the crowd.\n\nPancake Day or La fête des crêpes\n\nLater, salt mealcakes prepared by the Vestal Virgins were burnt, which is interesting because in France, Candlemas, celebrated on 2nd February, is “la fête des crêpes” or Pancake Day and today, 12th February is International Pancake Day. It would be my opinion that pan of pancakes is the pan of pots and pans, but would that it were the Pan of the “Greek god of the wild, shepherds and flocks, nature, of mountain wilds, hunting and rustic music, and companion of the nymphs” (Pan, Wikipedia).\n\nPan’s Roman counterpart was Faunus. But Pan protected the flocks from wolves, which would suggest that he was also the counterpart of Lupercus, the above-mentioned Roman god of shepherds who replaced an earlier god named Februus (see Lupercalia, Wikipedia).\n\nValentine’s Day\n\nHowever, for our purposes, the ancient and “pagan” Lupercalia was a raucous event which Pope Saint Gelasius I (494–96) wanted to abolish. Senators opposed him so he invited them to run nude themselves. After a long dispute, Gelasius replaced the Lupercalia with a “Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary,” to be observed on Candlemas. It was a noble thought, but eventually the “pagan” feast became Saint Valentine’s Day or Valentine’s Day, celebrated on the 14th of February, near the Ides of February. According to Britannica, “[i]t came to be celebrated as a day of romance from about the 14th century.”[i] That would be in Chaucer’s (born c. 1342/43, London?, England—died 25 October 1400, London) lifetime.\n\nThe many Saints called Valentine\n\nThere was a St Valentine a convert and a physician, who may have restored the sight of his gaoler’s blind daughter. According to Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, this Valentine was clubbed to death c. 270. His feast day is the 14th of February. However, there could be other beatified Valentines. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia there are three saints named Valentine, one of whom would the bishop of Terni, formerly Interamna. However, Roman Martyrology recognizes only one St Valentine, a martyr who died on the Via Flaminia and whose feast day is the 14th of February. (See Saint Valentine, Wikipedia.)\n\nConclusion\n\nI will break here. We have gone from the Lupercalia to Valentine’s Day and stumbled upon la fête des crêpes (2nd February) or Pancake Day, which is quite a journey. Let us return to the Lupercalia. Pope Saint Gelasius I did abolish disorderly “pagan” festival. However, though there is at least one saint named Valentine, Valentine’s Day is very much as escribed in Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. It is a “relic” of the Lupercalia. It is no longer the Lupercalia of old, but it remains a celebration of love and friendship and a bit of a carnival. In fact, not only is today, 12th February 2013, International Pancake Day, but it is also Mardi Gras (Shrove Tuesday), which is the end of the carnival season.\n\n______________________________\n\n[i] “Valentine’s Day”.

(Photo credit: Wikipedia)\n\nThe Golden Legend\n\nThere is no mention of Jacobus de Voragine’s Golden Legend,[i] or Legenda aurea, in my list of other illuminated manuscripts, my last post. Yet hagiographies and martyrologies, the lives of saints and martyrs, were among illuminated manuscripts and the Golden Legend, compiled around the year 1260, was the bestseller of the Middle Ages.\n\nJacobus de Voragine (c. 1230 – July 13 or July 16, 1298), also known as Giacomo da Varazze, Jacopo da Varazze and Jacques de Voragine, was an Italian chronicler and, reluctantly, the Archbishop of Genoa. As a chronicler, he wrote a Chronicle of Genoa. However, he is also the author of Sermones de omnibus evangeliis, discourses on all the Gospels, and several other texts. In fact, Voragine was a prolific writer and may have translated the Bible. If he did, that translation has disappeared. In short, although it is illuminated, the Golden Legend, or Légende dorée, is first and foremost a text.\n\n(please click on the picture to enlarge it)\n\n“Crucifixion” (showing also the archbishop Jacobus de Voragine with his book the Golden Legend in his hands), by Ottaviano Nelli, Chapel of the Trinci Palace, Foligno, Italy (Photo credit: Wikipedia)\n\nHagiographies and Martyrologies\n\nHowever, as a text, the Golden Legend was not just any text. In the Middle Ages, lives of saints and martyrs were a favourite. Saints perform miracles and some kill mythical animals. St George slayed a dragon, which made him a popular saint during the Middle Ages. Miracles are manifestations of the supernatural and dragons, a mythical creature born of the collective human imagination. The Golden Legend has an apocryphal St Sylvester who goes down a dungeon, tames a dragon and climbs out carrying the dragon.\n\nThe Subject Matter\n\nSo, there can be little doubt that the Golden Legend owes its popularity in part to its subject matter. Hagiographies belong, to a large extent, to that special realm of literature we call the “fantastic” and, in Voragine’s case, a Christian fantastic, or “merveilleux [marvellous] chrétien,” a term used by scholars to describe “fantastic” aspects of French medieval literature. In short, Voragine wrote legends, golden legends. Miracles and martyrdom constitute another “reality.”\n\nFiction: a Legend\n\nMoreover, Voragine wrote extremely well. He knew the merits of fiction and style, which may be the real key to the success of the Golden Legend. Other authors wrote hagiographies and martyrologies, but not in a way that truly engaged readers. As for Jacobus, he “embellished” his texts to the delight of readers. Voragine is also said to have “borrowed” from other writers such as Jean de Mailly[ii] and Bartholomew of Trent,[iii] but did he “borrow” or retell?\n\nVincent de Beauvais, the author of the Speculum Maius (The Great Mirror), “the compendium of all of the knowledge of the Middle Ages” also borrowed from Mailly, Bartholomew of Trent and other authors. (See Speculum Maius, Wikipedia.) Borrowing need not be plagiarism. Although a large number of La Fontaine’s Fables are Æsopic in origin, Jean de La Fontaine is one of the finest French authors.\n\nA Calendar\n\nFinally, the Golden Legend was yet another calendar, a liturgical calendar. Every day of the year, a saint or an event, such as the birth of Christ, is commemorated. Voragine himself was beatified in 1816 and his feast day is July 16th. The Golden Legend’s calendar is divided into five seasons.\n\n(please click on the picture to enlarge it)\n\nA Golden Legend illumination (Photo credit: Google images)\n\nAn Illuminated Manuscript and an Incunable\n\nYet, The Golden Legend was illuminated, not by Voragine but by several Italian artists. Moreover, it was copied (calligraphy), again not by Voragine, but by different scribes, probably monks working in a scriptorium.[iv] So The Golden Legend could have been listed in Other Illuminated Manuscripts as several copies were made between 1260 and 1450, the year Johannes Gutenberg (c. 1395 – February 3, 1468) invented the printing press. However, it also constitutes an incunable (sometimes called a “fifteener,” fifteenth century).\n\nIncunables or incunabula (incunabulum, singular: “in the cradle”) are books printed between 1450 and 1501, of which the best known is the Gutenberg Bible (also known as the 42-line Bible, the Mazarin Bible or the B42). To see the facsimile, click on Gutenberg Bible. Another famous incunable is the Hartmann Schedel Weltchronik (a German translation of the Liber Chronicarum (Nuremberg Chronicle). But The Golden Legend is also, and not negligibly, an incunable.\n\nOne characteristic of incunables is that the printer often left room on the printed page so an artist could illuminate the text. For instance, incunables often featured rubricated (from red) letters. Rubricated letters are slightly different than historiated letters, a matter that can be discussed later.\n\nConclusion\n\nI will pause by saying that The Golden Legend tells far more than the lives of saints and martyrs and does so because Voragine embellished his accounts to the point of creating saints and martyrs. He was a storyteller and that may well be the reason his hagiography has endured. However, for the record, The Golden Legend is\n\nthe bestseller of the Middle Ages,\n\nan illuminated manuscript,\n\nan incunable and, after 1501,\n\na printed book.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\nOther Illuminated Manuscripts\n\nJacques de Voragine: The Golden Legend\n\n______________________________\n\n[i] Online text, The Golden Legend (Fordham University)\n\n[ii] Abbreviato in gestis miraculis sanctorum (Summary of the Deeds and Miracles of the Saints)\n\n[iii] Epilogum in gesta sanctorum (Afterword on the Deeds of the Saints)\n\n[iv] It would appear that the scriptorium was a series of recesses located in a monastery and not a room.\n\ncomposer: Guillaume de Machaut (c. 1300 – April 1377)\n\nform: Virelai\n\npiece: Douce Dame Jolie\n\n© Micheline Walker\n\n11 February 2013\n\nWordPress"
