        "text": "Abstract There is a general agreement that galaxy structures exhibit fractal properties, at least up to some small scale. However the presence of an eventual crossover towards homogenization, as well as the exact value of the fractal dimension, are still a matter of debate. I summarize the main points of the this discussion, considering also some galaxy surveys which have recently appeared. Further I discuss the implications for the standard picture of the observed fractal behaviour in galaxy distribution.\n\nThis paper discusses if large scale galaxy distribution samples containing almost one million objects can be characterized as fractal systems. The analysis performed by Teles et al. (Phys Lett B 813:136034, 2021) on the UltraVISTA DR1 survey is extended here to the SPLASH and COSMOS2015 catalogs, hence adding 750k new galaxies with measured redshifts to the studied samples. The standard $$\\Lambda $$ Λ CDM cosmology having $$H_0=(70\\pm 5)$$ H 0 = ( 70 ± 5 ) km/s/Mpc and number density tools required for describing these galaxy distributions as single fractal systems with dimension D are adopted. We use the luminosity distance $$d_{\\scriptscriptstyle L}$$ d L , redshift distance $$d_z$$ d z and galaxy area distance (transverse comoving distance) $$d_{\\scriptscriptstyle G}$$ d G as relativistic distance definitions to derive galaxy number densities in the redshift interval $$0.1\\le z\\le 4$$ 0.1 ≤ z ≤ 4 at volume limited subsamples defined by absolute magnitudes in the K-band. Similar t...\n\nAbstract: Some years ago we proposed a new approach for the analysis of galaxy and cluster correlations based on the concepts and methods of modern statistical physics. This led to the surprising result that galaxy correlations are fractal and not homogeneous up to the limits of the available catalogues. In the meantime many more redshifts have been measured and we have extended our methods also to the analysis of number counts and angular catalogues. This has led to a complete analysis of all the available data that we ...\n\nAbstract In this letter we present an idea which reconciles a homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann universe with a fractal distribution of galaxies. We use two observational facts: The flat rotation curves of galaxies and the (still debated) fractal distribution of galaxies with fractal dimension [FORMULA]. Our idea can also be interpreted as a redefinition of the notion of bias."
