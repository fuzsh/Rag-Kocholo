Nessa (NES). Jan. 2012. Reissue of the band's third album from 77, on which free improvisation and poetic swing were back then topping and showing pure creativity!\n\nAkinetón Retard: Akinetón Ao Vivo. 4th release by the group, double CD in limited edition, recorded live in Santiago/Chile and Rio de Janeiro/Brazil, featuring tunes from their three studio cds plus some new compositions. Excellent sound fidelity. This band, on stage, displays superior energy compared to their sudio work, with more solos and improvising.\n\nAlban Darche Trio: Brut Ou Demi-Sec? Yolk (J2046). Street date: 14/09/09. Maybe more known for his band \"Le Cube\", French saxophonist Alban Darche opts here for the trio + 1 formula, guitarist and previous member of the Orchestre National de Jazz Alexis Thérain joining them in their unceasing exploration of new rhythmic contours or melodic surfaces\n\nÄleklint/Holmlander/Nilssen-Love: Fish & Steel. PNL Records (PNL044). Street date: 04-10-19. Sculled from the Large Unit band, this new trio of trombone, tuba and drums springs into open and free jazz territories!\n\nAlessandro Galati Trio: On A Sunny Day. Via Veneto Jazz / Jando Music (VVJ105). 17-12-15. Galati's trio presents in this disc melodic and singable songs, often melting, drawing fantastic melodies, through a complex harmonic structure. Its charm is therefore in its duality between simple and complex, between the familiar and innovative. Listening to this record will be like traveling in a musical journey full of twists and turns of program that will fuel the desire to discover new sensations with the desire to \"start again\" with each new listening. With Gabriele Evangelista on double bass and Stefano Tamborrino on drums\n\nAlessandro Scala Quintet: Bossa Mossa (CNCD2009). The group formed in 2003 under the leadership of sax player Alessandro Scala, jazz lover and big \"hard bop\" fan. The group performed live tracks by Horace Silver, Hank Mobley, Lee Morgan, etc... trying to bring back to life the BLUE NOTE sound. Alessandro Scala then composed original tracks that are now released in this debut album\n\nAlex Maguire Sextet: Brewed in Belgium. Moonjune MJR022. Recorded live on October 27 at De Singer in Rijkevorsel, Belgium by Henk Weltevreden for the Dutch National Radio (VPRO), broadcast on November 7, 2007. Mostly known by those who follow the British jazz scene but also fans of Canterbury prog outfit Hatfield & The North (in which he took the keyboard chair at the band's reformation), Maguire has here put up a new project implying another exciting Belgian combo called The Wrong Object. They team up to launch a repertoire ranging from lyrical to groovy tunes, haunting melodies, free improvisation and high-energy interaction. Maguire's talents as a pianist and a keyboard player are so diverse, his touch so personal and his telepathic conversations with the other musicians so explosive and brilliantly unpredictable that the line that divides the written parts from the collective improvisations is often impossible to draw. Thanks to the sextet's improvisational skills, the mixture remains coherent and fascinating throughout despite the wide range of styles that characterizes this highly unusual record.\n\nAnderson, Fred: The Missing Link. Nessa (NES 23). Jan. 2012. Reissue of the third album by the Chicagoan saxophonist; a unique approach of the art of improvising!\n\nAndrea Grossi Blend Orchestra: Four Winds. We Insist! (WEIN9). Street date:25-09-20. The keystones of this work, crafted between November 2015 and June 2017), are the pieces that bear the names of the four ancient Greek winds: Borea (North), Noto (South), Euro (East), Zephiro (West). This imagery can't obviously ignore the perspective of the \"migrating wind\" as an entity in movement, that blends and transforms itself, renovating traditions, identities and cultures, overcoming walls and barriers of all kinds. This music is meant to be an hymn: an eulogy to the differences that nourish and enrich our world. At the same time, with its harshness, it aims to stimulate a reflection about the terrible fate accompanying those who are forced to give up their lives in favor of a greater hope; an aspiration that, very often, remains unfulfilled.\n\nAndrea Grossi Blend 3: Lubok. We Insist! CD / LP (CDWEIN05/LPWEIN05). Street date: 14-06-19. Andrea Grossi is a young and extremely talented double bass player and Blend 3 is his trio featuring alto sax player Manuel Calliumi and guitarist Michele Bonifati. The group explores the diverse sound aspects of a trio format that, without a preconceived set, utilizes composition and improvisation as its only resources. This is some sort of Chamber Jazz where each sound controls its own development to remain suspended and constantly communicative. Nonetheless, sudden nervous and electric transgressions sometimes burst abruptly.\n\nAndreas Røysum Ensemble: S/T. Motvind Records (MOT7CD). Street date: 13-03-20. This is an album coming from ten musicians / souls belonging to the young Norwegian jazz scene. Joyous melodies, passionate outbursts and lots of fun are created with extended means: two basses, tablas, a string and a wind quartet, simply put: a luxurious listening experience for the adventurous! It's also released on LP (MOT7LP)!\n\nAndy Emler MegaOctet: No Rush! Label La Buissonne (RJAL397044). Recorded at La Buissonne studios on August 30th & 31th, 2021 by Gérard de Haro, this album is the ninth studio recording of the MegaOctet, a funny coincidence since this small big band is also made of [b]nine[/b] musicians, in the form of an exceptional laboratory of human alchemy and sound. Inspired by 20th century music (Arnold Schönberg, Witold Lutoslawsky, György Ligeti, Maurice Ohana, Philippe Manoury, Tristan Murail, Bernard Cavanna, etc.), the album also sees the return of guitarist Nguyên Lê (who participated in the first version of MegaOctet in 1989). Filled with colourful orchestral combinations, meticulously written sequences or subtle and rich improvisations, the album one more time reveals the multi talents of his \"organic\" leader, as pianist, composer, arranger and true catalyst of energies!\n\nAndy Emler Megaoctet: A Moment For ... La Buissonne (RJAL397032). Street date: 05-10-18. The new repertoire, composed by Andy Emler, finds its origins in the idea of suspending time in order to question ourselves on our social and cultural environment. The compositions are musical reflections on human relationships at the beginning of the twenty first century, each piece of music sounding and echoeing with the musical universe of the high level performers of the MegaOctet: Guillaume Orti, Philippe Sellam, Francois Verly, Claude Tchamitchian, Eric Echampard, Laurent Dehors, Laurent Blondiau and François Thuillier.\n\nAnemic Cinema: S/T. El Negocito Records (eNR103). Street date: 02-04-21. Anemic Cinema is a fresh instrumental quartet at the junction of (free) improvised music, contemporary classical and heavy metal. Created for Citadelic 2020 by guitarist Artan Buleshkaj, it features some of Belgium?s most adventurous young improvisers. The omission of a conventional bass instrument allows other instruments to assume this role (or not). This creates certain interesting compositional and improvisational challenges. The timbre distinct for (heavy) metal simultaneously provides an arousing stepping stone, enhancing the harmonics of modern jazz. This all results in a listening experience equal parts visceral, hard-hitting and unpredictable. The line up: Artan Buleshkaj: baritone guitar & compositions / Rob Banken: alto saxophone & clarinet / Steven Delannoye: tenor saxophone & bass clarinet / Matthias de Waele: drums.\n\nPaolo Angeli: Rade. Anma / ReR Megacorp (PA14). July 2022. With Rade, the Sardinian guitarist changes course - compared to his previous album - and openly confronts the Mediterranean in a navigation that takes us to the mixed race atmosphere of Mare Nostrum's ports. Balkan pulsations, Middle-eastern arches, North African desert adagios, Rebetiko citations and memories of historical avant-gardes, flamenco reminiscences, dissonant phrasing, epic art-rock crescendo and patches of lyricism. The concept album sums up Paolo's twenty-five years of life with his orchestra-guitar, pushed to the limit of its tonal and expressive potential. Paolo's voice, however, is what weaves the narrative here. Nasal and with a Sardinian-Spanish flavor, relying on quatrains from 1700s and 1800s Sardinian poets from the regions of Gallura and Logudoro.\n\nAngelini, Bruno: Open Land. La Buissonne (RJAL397031). Street date: 23-03-18. More and more present on the French music scene, violinist Regis Huby also excells in coming up with very different projects and sounds. Here, under the leadership of the pianist and together with bass player Claude Tchamitchian and percussionist Edward Perraud, he offers a rich palette of sounds, treated with live electronics or created with bow techniques, contributing to the slow development of a climate with icy, quiet facettes, not far from what some call a Nordic tone. Mysterious, creepy and lively, quietly lyrical and melodic, here's a refreshing, delicious nightly beverage!\n\nThe US label Art of Life Records has just released a previously unreleased recording by three legendary British musicians: bassist Danny Thompson (Pentangle, John Martyn), guitarist Allan Holdsworth (Igginbottom, Nucleus, Tempest, Soft Machine, Gong, Bruford, U.K., Tony Williams New Lifetime) and drummer John Stevens (Spontaneous Music Ensemble, Derek Bailey). Recorded at Island Studios in London, on September 4th & 5th, 1978, \"Propensity\" includes two extended length group improvised tracks which prominently feature guitarist Allan Holdsworth on electric guitar (\"It Could Have Been Mono\") as well as 12-string acoustic guitar (\"Jools Toon\"). Other than the brief track, \"Gone Sailing\", from the '75 album \"Bundles\" by Soft Machine , this is the only known recording of Holdsworth soloing on a 12-string acoustic guitar! All tracks have been professionally mastered using 24-bit digital technology.\n\nAstral Travel: If You Say You Are From This Planet, Why Do You Treat It Like You Do? Hyperjazz (CD / HJ003-2 - LP / LPHJR003-1). Street date: 27-03-20. Enter a world in which drummer and composer Tommaso Cappellato leads a new configuration of his Astral Travel ensemble, comprised of selected improvisers from the contemporary creative music scene: pianist Fabrizio Puglisi, reeds player Piero Bittolo Bon, who also contributes to the electronic soundscape, and double bass player Marco Privato. Inspired by the poetry of Sun Ra inscribed within the pages of the book \"This Planet Is Doomed\", the music and lyrics focus on the current consciousness of the planet, raising questions and issues of humanity's collective spiritual direction. The body of work contained in this album is the result of numerous live-in-studio improvisations, deconstructed in a meticulous post-production process by avant-garde electronic producer Rabih Beaini. Vocalists Dwight Trible and Camilla Battaglia sing and declaim the poems.\n\nJean-Jacques Avenel: Live at Pôle Sud. Jazzdor Séries (JAZZSOR 0001/4). Oct. 2016. Recorded on November 15th, 2011 in Strasbourg, this album is a solo recording on acoustic bass by the ex-Steve Lacy partner.\n\nDenis Badault: H3B. The pianist and previous leader of the French national emblem L'Orchestre National de Jazz comes here with an album where violinist Régis Huby brings some classical touches to a subtle music between written and improvised, where we also meet bass player Sébastien Boisseau.\n\nBaker, Chet: Chet On Poetry. Mono Jazz (MJC129001CD). Street date: 28-04-23. Recorded in Rome, this happened to be Chet's last record in studio, but indeed it differs from the others and is one of the most charming ones. Among the most known players of this Italian lineup, let's note its rhythm section: bass player Enzo Pietropaoli and drummer Roberto Gatto. Taken off the original tapes and remastered with today's amazing technologies\n\nBilly Bang: Da Bang! Tum Records (TUMCD 034). 2013. Da Bang! was recorded in February 2011, just two months before the master violinist Billy Bang (1947-2011) succumbed to cancer. In this final session, the Billy Bang Group featured one extended composition by Bang, \"Daydreams,\" as well as other compositions by some of Bang's favorite musicians, including Barry Altschul, Don Cherry, Ornette Coleman, Miles Davis and Sonny Rollins.\n\nFrode Barth & Harald Johnsen: Blue Spheres. MTG Music MTGCD70003. The Norwegian musicians and composers Frode Barth (acoustic and electric guitars) and Harald Johnsen (acoustic bass) have worked professionally for many years. Both have extensive experience in recordings, concerts and tours at home and abroad. Barth and Johnsen have previously been co-featured in various CD-recordings (Johnsen is for ex. part of the Tord Gustavsen Trio on the prestigious German label ECM) . This time, they have joined forces to produce their very own unique album, Blue Spheres. One might describe their style as modern jazz, for lack of a more precise phrase. A romantic tone meets elements of contemporary music and electronica. Blue Spheres is the result of many years of collaboration, improvisation and compositional exchange between these two outstanding musicians.\n\nStefano Battaglia & Michele Rabbia: Stravagario 2. Via Veneto (VVJ 049). This duo consisting of piano / Rhodes + percussions delivers a subtile and moving modern jazz with a strong Italian touch.\n\nAlbert Beger: Evolving Silence Vol.2. Earsay's Jazz Production 2006. Beger is a saxophonist born in Turkey who immigrated to Israël at the age of three. This second volume presents him on tenor sax and alto flute, together with the illustrious rhythm section of Hamid Drake & William Parker. The latter is heard on bass and African hunter's harp. Albert's music is inspired by the world and environment around him, while the Jazz music is the basis to all this. Furthermore, he combines the influences of Classical and Ethnic music in tunes which come from nature and the soul.\n\nDisciples of harmolody, the Belghoul Quartet is composed of 3 Algerian brothers and a friend. Their album \"Harmolodies\" is clearly inspired by the master Ornette Coleman.\n\nAlain Bellaïche: Sea Fluorescent. Le SouffleContinu (fflCD063). Street date: 09-10-20. First ever reissue of highly sought after french jazz funk fusion nugget from Alain Bellaïche, featuring Jerry Goodman of Mahavishnu Orchestra's fame, John Hicks (Strata-East) & Fabiano (Fabiano Orchestra). Remastered from the master tapes.\n\nTwo albums by ace bass player Jeff Berlin are actually seeing a reissue; Aneurythms (EX 27160) from 2006 and Lumpy Jazz (EX 37290) from 2004. On the first, he teamed with talented and versatile drummer Vinnie Colaiuta, while ex PMG member Danny Gottlieb seats on the drum chair on the other album\n\nBill Frisell Trio: Valentine. Blue Note (00602508992094). Street date: 14-08-20. The debut recording of guitarist Bill Frisell's trio with bassist Thomas Morgan & drummer Rudy Royston is a wide-ranging 13 song set that mixes Frisell originals new & old, jazz standards, traditional songs, and covers. Valentine explores the creative freedom of the trio format and the profound musical relationship between these three musicians after years of touring.\n\nBjörkenheim / Parker / Drake: DMG @ The Stone / Vol 2 (DMG 722). March 09. This 2nd volume presents on the same stage (Stone) the Norwegian guitarist Raoul Björkenheim (some of you have maybe heard him in the Scorch Trio ?), backed by a dream team: William Parker on bass and drummer Hamid Drake\n\nBlack Hole Quartet: Black Ol' Blues. Rudi Records (RRJ 1005). August 2012. This is a project founded by Daniele Cavallanti, saxophonist of the middle-sized band Italian Instabile Orchestra. An electric saga deliciously told in several musical languages without any constrictions!\n\nBlazin' Quartet: Sleeping Beauty. Moonjune Records (MJR111). Born in Bosnia & Herzegovina and today living in France, composer, arranger and educator Srdjan Ivanovic presents here his international unit, featuring as special guest maestro flutist Magic Malik. With members from Greece, Italy and Bulgaria, the band delivers for their 4th studio album a very profound, organic, timeless and articulate sound. Seldom does such an ensemble jazz cast weave so seamlessly, yet play with such heartfelt emotion, conviction and, at times, abandon. With an inherent, extraordinary chemistry on display, moments of the most rare, exquisite beauty materialize while ascending to the fore.\n\nBlue Moka feat. Fabrizio Bosso: Blue Moka. Via Veneto Jazz (VVJ122). Street date: 15-01-18. Debut album of a quartet composed of Alberto Gurrisi (Hammond organ), Emiliano Vernizzi (sax), Michele Bianchi (guitar) and Michele Morari (drums) with the extraordinary participation of Fabrizio Bosso. The album collects 8 original songs that combine blues atmospheres with funky rhythms and R'N'B, opening up to New York nu-jazz. To these pieces are added two standards by Wayne Shorter (Footprints) and Michel Petrucciani (Brazilian Like) and a tribute to Lucio Dalla (Futura), a musician very dear to the band.\n\nBob Downes Open Music: Crossing Borders. Reel Recordings (RR011). 2008. Bob Downes is a multi-instrumentalist composer possessing a distinctive musical personality and prowess. Through bodily breath emanates sublime sounds from an array of flutes, poignant patterns from his alto and tenor saxophone performances, and engaging expressions of complimentary vocalizations. Open Music is the moniker under which Bob has produced an eclectic range of records since 1968. However none of the above prepares the listener for the profoundly engrossing experience that is Crossing Borders. Composed during an extended tour throughout South America in 1973, and evocative of the exotic locales encountered, Crossing Borders is a compendium of musical precision, mysticism, and tranquility. During the late seventies Bob Downes produced a beautifully warm analogue recording of his programmatic vision, colluding with contemporaries: guitarist Brian Godding, trombonist Paul Rutherford (1943-2007), bassists Barry Guy, Mark Meggido and Paul Bridge (1941-1998), and drummers Denis Smith and John Stevens (1943-1994). Thirty years later this unreleased record finally sees the light of day, and it has aged like a fine wine. A recording this special comes deservedly wrapped with our highest recommendation for everyone prepared to cross musical borders!\n\nBonaccorso, Rosario : Viaggiando. Veneto Jazz (VVJ098). Feb. 2015. The innate strength and vigour of Rosario's melodic writing, together with the striking form structure on which he has been working for years, make him widely regarded as one of today's most influential and innovative double bass players. At his side, Fabrizio Bosso sustains the creative flow, as he intuitively chisels evocative melodic fragments with his trumpet, while Argentinian saxophonist Javier Girotto and Brazilian guitarist Roberto Taufic blend in seamlessly into the fabric, further flavouring this journey with the cultural sensitivity deriving from their homelands. A voyage that spans over the Mediterranean, America's Jazz, Brazil, Argentina ... essential and pure ingredients that, under the guidance of Bonaccorso, give birth to a kaleidoscope of emotions that only music can convey.\n\nBoolvar: Gros Canard. Gigantonium. Street date: 24-05-22. This limited edition on EP CD presents the abrasive duo of Delphine Joussein (flute, voice, effects) and Sheik Anorak (drums, electronics). Recorded by the latter on March 9th 2022 at La Dynamo de Banlieues Bleues, Pantin, France, the duo take us on the slippery roads of a post jazz with metal rock asperities, delivering some kind of timeless 21th century exotic jazz krautrock!\n\nHåkan Boström Quartet featuring Joey Calderazzo: Refraction. Art of Life Records (AL1041-2 CD). 2010. Recorded and mixed on February 27, 2008 at Sami Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. This is the recording debut for the label by this Swedish saxophonist, here with his Swedish rhythm section and guest star Joey Calderazzo. Anchored in modern post bop jazz, the album is based on own compositions by the leader and also the bass player, plus tributes to great pianists and composers Don Grolnick & Richie Beirach\n\nLester Bowie: All the Numbers. Nessa (NES 31). 2CD. Jan. 2012. Those pre AEC trio (CD1) and quartet (CD2) sessions with Mitchell, Favors and Jarman were part of the Nessa 5CD boxset released years, no, centuries ago! Those who didn't get their fingers on it will surely appreciate this reissue!\n\nBobby Bradford / John Stevens: And The Spontaneous Music Ensemble. Nessa (NES 17). 2CD. April 2012. At the time of this recording (1971) at the Polydor studios in London, drummer John Stevens was experimenting new forms of writing open to musicians with various backgrounds, which ultimately became the Spontaneous Music Ensemble; besides Stevens and co-leader and trumpetist Bobby Bradford, we find musicians like saxophonist Trevor Watts, singer and also here guitarist Julie Tippetts and more.\n\nAnthony Braxton / Italian Instabile Orchestra: Creative Orchestra (Bolzano 2007). Tracce (RTP 0013). Dec. 09. The saxophonist directs the famous Italian ensemble on a repertory made of his own compositions. Top summit filled with a great deal of enthusiasm!\n\nBriggan Krauss'H-Alpha: Red Sphere (SKI 009). Nov. 08. Saxophonist (alto and baritone) Briggan Krauss offers here an album between the written and the improvised. With him are tenors of the improvised free jazz scene, drummer Jim Black and laptop specialist Ikue Mori\n\nPeter Brötzmann / Juhani Aaltonen / Peter Kowald / Edward Vesala: Hot Lotta. Street date: 11-05-18. Limited, exclusive, extended reissue of Hot Lotta, one of the rarest items in Peter Brötzmann's oeuvre. Hot Lotta was a special cultural event, the meeting of the brightest free jazz talent from Germany and Finland. Peter Brötzmann and Peter Kowald were joined by Edward Vesala and Juhani Aaltonen for the studio session that resulted in the album but also toured Finland and recorded a radio session. That radio session has now been unearthed and is presented as an added bonus in this official reissue. Will also be released as 2LP, the bonus tracks recorded for Yle on 4.6.1973 filling the 2nd LP.\n\nBrötzmann / Manderscheid / Samba: Danquah Circle (KCD 5127). Nov. 2005.\n\nBrötzmann / Yudanov / Luoma: Fryed Fruit. Red Toucan (RT 9316). Feb. 09. Recorded in 1999 at the Kerubi Club of Joensuu, a Finnish town, this power trio is closer to rock than to jazz, drummer Nicolai Yudanov reminding us of Japanese extravert Tatsuya Yoshida (from the duo Ruins). The Finnish guitarist Sakari Luoka doesn't either spare extravagance, sending around splashes of atonal chords, scratching his strings with metallic objects while Brötzmann vociferates in or through his horns (sax and clarinet), growling like a mad man. Big sound and raw energy are what you'll get here!\n\nBrötzmann, Peter : Petroglyphs. Long Arms LA 04051. October 06. This is the first CD by Brötzmann on a Russian label. This is a sax trio recorded in moscow in April 2002. Brötzmann is heard on alto, tenor and taragot while his russian partners are Ed Sivkov on baritone sax and Nick Rubanov on bass saxophone\n\nBill Bruford & Michiel Borstlap: In Two Minds (EX 36116). March 09. Recorded in 2007, \"In Two Minds\" features eleven intimate and conversational tracks of new, original material, and a stand-out reading of the Miles Davis classic \"All Blues\". This is the 2nd CD done by the duo\n\nBill Bruford & Tim Garland: Earthworks Underground Orchestra. BBSF013CD. This little big band's debut performance in the USA at Iridium, New York City, was captured live in full roaring swing, and the result will appeal alike to Earthworks fans, and fans from Bruford's former life in King Crimson and Yes. Earthworks, as a small group, celebrates its 20th Anniversary in 2006, and when Bruford and Garland took fresh arrangements of some of the band's best loved tunes over to NYC to work with some of the finest players in the U.S. in a nine-piece configuration, it sounded like the perfect anniversary party was just around the corner!\n\nNew from Bill Bruford and his labels Summerfold & Winterfold.\n\nDrummer Bill Bruford has since 2003 taken in own hands a program of releases and reissues of his own music. Here is an overview of those due to release in March 2005.\n\n- Earthworks: S/T. BBSF009CD. This recording of the debut Earthworks album has been re mastered and includes two bonus tracks: All Heaven Broke Loose and A Stone's Throw. Earthworks Mark 1 also featured horn players Django Bates and Iain Ballamy alongside upright bassist Mick Hutton. As with other albums in the Summerfold series of releases, Earthworks comes repackaged with a bonus disc containing music from the contrasting Winterfold catalogue and an exclusive interview with Bill Bruford.\n\nBrûlez Les Meubles: S/T. Circum-Disc (microcidi011). Feb. 2018. Here is the album and meeting of three musicians with very different backgrounds around the desire to create a jazz guitar trio that is oblique in the history of the genre. Nourishing aesthetic filiations with many precursors, from Jim Hall to Sonny Sharrock via Abercrombie or Bill Frisell, the trio stands out by a marked indifference to the habitual harmonic progress of jazz as for the repetitive movements and prefers melodic lines with indefinite harmony (harmolodie?) and incisive riffs.\n\nBruno Angelini Open Land Quartet: Nearly Nothing, Almost Everything. La Buissonne (RJAL 397043). Street date: 28-10-22. Inspired by minimalistic poets from the entire world, this new album, recorded in June 2021, is really part of the continuation of the two previous albums made by this quartet (released under the same label), both in its quality of writing and in the interpretation. Time and space stretch to give the necessary weight to each note, each pulsation. The silences are rich, nourished and thought. With Bruno Angelini (piano, composer), Régis Huby (violin, tenor violin, electronics), Claude Tchamitchian (double bass) and Edward Perraud (drums, percussion).\n\nMaurizio Brunod/ Danilo Gallo/ Massimo Barbiero: Gulliver. Via Veneto Jaz (VVJ145). Street date: 17-03-23. This is the 2nd record by three well-known italian improvisers, Maurizio Brunod on guitars, Danilo Gallo on double bass and Massimo Barbiero on drums and percussion, who perform a heterogeneous repertoire made up of songs drawn from popular traditions from around the world, and some original compositions, creating a fascinating fluid and coherent sequence as if they were playing a single suite, between jazz, rock, folk, improvisation and extemporaneity.\n\nThe Bureau of Atomic Tourism: Hapax Legomena. Rat Records (RAT 034). New album by this free improvising unit around drummer Teun Verbruggen. Recorded live in May 2014, this album sees guitarist Hilmar Jensson taking the place of Marc Ducret, who was the guitarist on the previous studio albums.\n\nGeorge Burt / Raymond Mc Donald (featuring Lol Coxhill - Bill Wells - Daniel Padden): One Bloke (Textile Records TCD13). Release Date: June 26th 2007. The collaboration of George Burt and Raymond Mc Donald with Lol Coxhill has produced 5 CDs, each one having a different approach. For this CD the duo wanted to add Bill Wells & Daniel Padden to the mix; not least because they are their friends with whom they have collaborated many times, but also because they felt their approach, at times improvisatory but with a strong melodic focus, would be very compatible with their own way of working with Lol. Of course Lol has a huge and richly deserved reputation as a unique free improviser with an innate, organic and never-ending sense of melodic inventiveness.\n\nCarl Maguire's Floriculture: Sided Silver Solid. Firehouse 12 (FH01009). Jan. 10. The leader (piano and Fender Rhodes) has been the pupil of Roscoe Mitchell, Fred Hersch & Marilyn Crispell and the ensemble has been playing his compositions in New York and around since 2001.\n\nClaude Tchamitchian Quartet: Émouvance. October 2012. After having worked with and written for bigger units, bass player Claude Tchamitchian is now recentering his work on smaller combos, like this quartet featuring guitarist Rémi Charmasson, violinist Régis Huby and drummer Christophe Marguet. Achieving a greater mobility inside a very original sound universe, he deploys with energy his melodic talent and unusual harmonic constructions, plowing rarely uncharted territories for a jazz unit like progressive rock, even folk may find its way at times.\n\nClaudia Campagnol: I'm Strong. Giant Sheep Music (GSM0432). Digipak. Street date: 29-04-19. This debut album by a young new Danish talent on the jazz scene comes around many stylistic roads, including pop-jazz, R&B, soul. 9 of the 10 tracks are penned by Claudia herself and the working team on the album calls for some big experienced shoes, especially concerning the rhythm section, with bass player Jimmy Haslip and the versatile drummer Vinnie Colaiuta, but also British trumpet player Gerard Presencer. The music has a strong crossover appeal and a catching dynamic, wrapped by the singer's warm sound!\n\nDaniel Carter / William Parker / Federico Ughi: Navajo Sunrise. Rudi Records (RRJ1016). 2013. Daniel Carter's relaxed phrasing moves naturally between Parker's earthly bass sound and Ughi's sensitive drumming. This trio's music seems to be possessed by a light and welcoming spirit. A constant flux of energy, a three way dialogue consumed within the time and space of one breath. Telling the story of the trio's origins, the musicians talk about dreams and desires while the body of this music takes shape within the human connection of the band's relationship which has grown over time, through meetings, travel and concerts.\n\nCathala / Durand / Vaillant: Live Au Sunset. Connexe Records (CR-002). May 2014. Trio guitar/sax/drums, with a strong contemporary approach, refined and delicate as well as quirky and daring, flirting at times with rock rhythms but always willing to surprise, search and ... find!\n\nCédric Caillaud Trio: June 26. Aphrodite Records 2006 (APH 106004). Cédric Caillaud is both the bass player and leader of this French trio, which is not too common. France has a lot of excellent jazz bass players but leaders are few (Patrice Caratini & Henri Texier are those who come to mind). Cédric has been travelling forth and back from France to New York where he followed classes and took teaching hours by great names such as pianists Richie Beirach, Kenny Barron or trumpetist Tom Harrell. He is today one of the most aftersought bass players on the Parisian jazz scene and works among various formations throughout Europe. A few guests are to be heard here as well, among others another bass player and composer, French Pierre Boussaguet who had an important role in Cedric's growth as player.\n\nCecchetto, Roberto: Humanity. Via Veneto Jazz (VVJ134). Street date: 13-03-20. This is the newest album by Roberto Cecchetto, one the most original and eclectic guitarists on the European jazz scene, member of Enrico Rava's historic \"Electric Five\" band, renowned for his sonic experimentation and collaborations with the most important musicians in European jazz (Palle Danielsson, Richard Galliano, Paolo Fresu, Stefano Bollani, Paolino Dalla Porta, Lee Konitz, to name a few.) Cecchetto pairs with Lionel Loueke on guitar and Alessandro Paternesi on drums, weaving together rich and creative sonic textures into refined and genre-defying compositions. Soft melodic combinations and a rich harmonic palette are characteristic of Cecchetto's musical creations.\n\nCentazzo, Andrea: With Mitteleuropa Orchestra. This release from the label Newtone is the 5th of the Ictus reissue program. Goin back to the 80's we find highly acclaimed improvisers such Enrico Rava, Franz Koglmann, Gianluigi Trovesi, Carlos Zingaro.\n\nChamorro, Joan & Magalí Datzira: Joan Chamorro Presenta Magalí Datzira. Temps Records (TR1435). 10/04/14. Is it the schooling effect of Esperanza Spalding? Magalí Datzira is a double bass player ... and sings! Says saxophonist Joan Chamorro: \"She has a very particular way of approaching tempo and melodies, reading them in a special way and confronting a score as if compass bars did not exist\". Several guests appear on the album, like saxophonist Perico Sambeat, to name but one.\n\nCharles Tyler Ensemble: Live At Sweet Basil Vol 1 & 2 (CT 1964 & 1965). Concert from March 12, 1984. The first volume focuses on personal compositions while the second is grasping Monk's compositions. The rhythm section of the ensemble consists of bassist Wilber Morris and drummer John Betsch. Roy Campbell is on trumpet, Richard Dunbar plays horn and pianist Curtis clark completes the band.\n\nChicago Underground Duo: Age of Energy. Northern Spy (NSP 020). April 2012. This is the 6th album recorded by Rob Mazurek (cornet, electronic, vocals) and Chad Taylor (drums, mbira, rhythm box, electronics).\n\nClark, Curtis: Letter To South Africa. Nimbus West (NS 0501). May 2011. Recorded in Holland in 1985, this is the international quintet of the pianist Curtis Clark, featuring saxophonist John Tchicai, cellist Ernst Reijseger, the South-African icon Louis Moholo-Moholo on drums and bassist Ernst Glerum. The composing is in a post-bop / early Blue Note vein.\n\nNels Cline / Elliott Sharp: Duo Milano. Long Song LSR03. October 07. Sharp considers Nels Cline as one of his favoured guitarists and partners! Those moments captured in a very good recording studio have been worked out with much precision and a sense for details!\n\nCobham, Billy: The Art of Five. In+Out (IOR 77063). June 2011. This release will present you the bop side of the drummer, a fresh take for those who only know his fusion side. With him are saxophonist Donald Harrison, pianists Eric Reed or Julian Joseph, bass players Robert Hurst & Orlando Le Flemming (Joseph and Hurst paired together on two tracks) and trumpetist Guy Barker . CD reissue. This \"The Art of ...\" series started with \"The Art of Three\" (IOR 77045), where Cobham plays a swinging drumming together with pianist Kenny Barron and bassist Ron Carter. In between is \"The Art of Four\" (IOR 77085) where Carter and Harrison meet again, the missing part being pianist James Williams\n\nGraham Collier: Hamburg 1968. British Progressive Jazz (BPJ008STC). Street date: 10-06-22. This performance occurred in December 1968, three months before Collier took his upcoming sextet (with trumpeter Harry Beckett, multi-instrumentalist Karl Jenkins, saxophonist Stan Sulzmann, trombonist Nick Evans and drummer John Marshall) into the studios to record his second album, \"Down Another Road\". None of the pieces here feature on that album or elsewhere. These tracks find Collier at a point of transition in his music. Several tunes here hark back in style and mood to the modal, Miles-inspired approach of \"Deep Dark Blue Centre\" (Deram 1967), while others anticipate the music on \"Down Another Road\" or can be linked with \"Workpoints\", the music composed for his 1968 Arts Council commission. A few other players are also featured here: Ted Curson (trumpet, piccolo trumpet), John Mumford (trombones), Tony Roberts (tenor sax, bass clarinet, flute) and Pierre Cavalli (guitar). All in all, this makes for an excellent addition to Collier's catalogue and further illuminates a major chapter in British jazz history.\n\nCommand All Stars: Curiosities 1972. Reel Recordings (RR010). 2008. In February 1972, a group of young jazz musicians gathered in London's Command Studios, with producer Robert Fripp, to record a double album intended for Ronnie Scott's Productions. The cast, consisting of pianist Keith Tippett, saxophonist Elton Dean, trombonist Nick Evans, trumpetist Mark Charig, and bassists Harry Miller & Johnny Dyani, with drummer Keith Bailey, unquestionably qualify the moniker All Stars. When the results were rejected as \"no commercial potential\", the master tapes were reused and the project forgotten, until Nick Evans, prompted by Reel Recordings, found copy reels for two of the four sides. What was discovered were diverse collective improvisations in a variety of group settings occasioned with unlikely instrumentation (Tippett - electric piano, Dean - sopranino, Miller - African flute). These tracks amount to much more than a series of curiosities as its title suggests, and open-hearted listening to this spontaneous music making reveals a plethora of riches. Of special note is the emotionally deep playing and interaction from South African bassists Harry Miller and Johnny Dyani. Recorded documents that add to the important history of British Jazz do not surface very often and this rare All Star session commands its cultural recognition!\n\nCompassionate Dictatorship: Cash Cows. FMR Records (FMRCD284-0310). 2010. Described by Jazzwise Magazine as \"catching the current wave of Brit Jazz\", \"Compassionate Dictatorship\" evolved out of the long standing collaboration between guitarist Jez Franks and saxophonist Tori Freestone, both educated at the Leeds College of Music. They joined then forces with Danish bass player Jasper Hoiby and - on the present album - drummer Ben Reynolds. The guitar and sax led quartet play original material that draws from a wide and eclectic range of influences from folk to free and contemporary jazz, creating fresh sounds and atmospheric textures within interesting harmonic frameworks and varied meters over bubbling grooves, blending the four distinct voices into one (guitar and sax often play quirky thematic lines in unisson). Reminiscences of albums by Michael Brecker may come to mind (listen to the opening track!), while other more folky and dreamy pieces are not so far from Oregon.\n\nChick Corea & Gary Burton: Hot House. Decca. April 2012. The two giants renew their meeting together with this album, for a set of mostly covers by jazz and pop icons like Monk, Brubeck and The Beatles.\n\nVincent Courtois & Ze Jam Afane: L'Homme Avion. Chief Inspector (CHIN 200813). Following \"Les Contes de Rose Manivelle\" here's a new album presenting the extraordinarily poetic universe of French cellist Vincent Courtois and the African lyricist Ze Afane Jam. It's hard to describe how much this album catches on one, from the chamber rock arrangements made by Courtois to the splendidly articulated musical narration of his partner. Of course understanding French will open some more doors (some political messages, some poetic dreams) but it is not a must and non French readers will also been seduced and hypnotized by the unreal magic brought in by all players! A lovely album, even more concise in its nearly dadaistic logic than its predecessor\n\nVincent Courtois: Les Contes de Rose Manivelle. On the french label Le Triton. With Louis Sclavis guesting.\n\nLol Coxhill: Ear of the Beholder. Esoteric Recordings (eclec 22275). 27/06/11. Recorded between July 1970 and January 1971, the double LP \"Ear of the Beholder\" gave Lol Coxhill the chance to produce a unique solo work which saw him touch various musical areas, including the avant garde, jazz, rock and more. Coxhill was assisted in the recording sessions by contributions from colleagues such as Kevin Ayers, Mike Oldfield and David Bedford. This reissue also includes the A and B sides of two singles recorded by Lol Coxhill and David Bedford in 1971 and 1972.\n\nCrimson Lip: S/T. Improvising Beings. Sept. 2011. 61 minutes extracted from the Japanese tour of bass player Alan Silva in 2009, with one of the pionneers of early free jazz over there, drummer and percussionist Sabu Toyozumi; completing the line up are guitarist Takuo Tanikawa, also using a computer, and singer Keiko Higuchi. Dark, hot but never suffocating!\n\nCrovella, Beppe: Soulful Traffic. ARTB 303 CD. 2010. Crovella is mostly known as the keyboardist of the much celebrated fusion/prog band Arti & Mestieri but he is a versatile player and producer! After his personal tribute to the spirit of Soft Machine, with the humoristic title \"What's Rattlin' on the Moon?\", he comes here with something quite different, 18 compositions for Hammond organ and band. The album generates a \"Soulful Traffic\" made of melodies, moods and grooves coming from different musical inspirations and styles, from soul to R&B, from rock blues to rock, from acid jazz to jazz-rock, from latin to 60/70's moods.\n\nDadada : Saison 3. Label Bleu (LBLC6725). 2017. Pianist Roberto Negro, saxophonist Émile Parisien and drummer/percussionist Michele Rabbia offer here a mysterious and adventurous night-shaded album, playing on timbers, emotions and subtle electronic effects.\n\nDag Arnesen Trio: Norwegian Wood (RM17-2). With this album, the Norwegian jazz pianist Dag Arnesen reaches back to the music of his childhood. With him are Terje Gewelt on bass and the great drummer Pal Thowsen. These folk songs, along with the music of Edvard Grieg have always been an important part of Arnesen's musical identity.\n\nDaniele Cavallanti & The Milano Contemporary Art Ensemble : Sounds of Hope. Rudi Records (RRJ1026). 05/03/15. The Milano Contemporary Art Ensemble is a large ensemble and a real \"manifesto\" of the present creative scene of Milano. Cavallanti presents here a dense repertoire both of original music with dedications to Joe Henderson, Sam Rivers, Anthony Braxton and Roscoe Mitchell, as well as Wayne Shorter and Mongezi Feza's arrangements.\n\nDaniele Cavallanti Electric Unit: Smoke Inside. Long Song LSR02. October 07. Cavallanti is a saxophonist player, member of the Italian Instabile Orchestra. He invites here in his quintet guitarist Nels Cline for a music that would unavoidably be linked to the late 60's Blue Note period. And the outburts of the Tony Williams Lifetime aren't far either!\n\nDanny Gottlieb Trio: Jazz Beautiful Ballads. With pianist Mark Soskin and bassist Charles \"Chip\" Jackson. Nicolosi Prod. NIC90018\n\nDauner, Wolfgang: Tribute to the Past. HGBS Musikproduktion (HG20012). German release date: Oct 8th, 2010. Hailing from Stuttgart in Germany, Wolfgang Dauner is a major figure of the German music scene; reaching the age of 75 in December 2010 therefore fully justified the recording of this musical autobiography, his pen being the very same Bösendorfer Grand Piano, that he and so many other famous artists used back in the MPS days. And, one can hear it clearly on this album, all three (maestro Dauner, the MPS studio, and the Bösendorfer) are still in very good shape!\n\nDave Burrell Trio: Expansion. HT 001. His 23th album as leader and here with Andrew Cyrille and bassist William Parker (also playing here kora). Burrell is one of those rare pianists able to encompass stride and avant garde at the same time.\n\nDave Douglas Quintet: Live At The Jazz Standard. Greenleaf GRE05. Sept. 07. This 2CD gathers a selection of the best tracks recorded by the quintet at the club \"Jazz Standard\" in December 2006. The 12 sets played in this period were already offered as MP3 downloads on the trumpeter's site but at the demand of his fans who wanted to hear his music without the mp3 compression, he decided to come up with this CD! Note that it also includes two covers ONLY available on the CD! The band features saxophonist Donny McCaslin, the great Uri Caine on Fender Rhodes, James Genus on bass and Clarence Penn on drums.\n\nDave Stapleton Quintet : The House Always Wins. Red Eye Music (Redeye 010). Release Date: 10th September 2007. This is Stapleton's fourth album as leader. The Cardiff-based pianist-composer (and owner of the label) is winning a wider reputation, probably due to the strength and virility of his playing, matched by an innate capacity for tenderness and reflection. As a composer, he draws upon a formidable grasp of Jazz, Classical and World styles, yet transforms these raw materials into something richly personal. With the exceptional talents of Paula Gardiner on bass and Elliot Bennett on drums, this is an album of powerful, driving rhythms and lingering melodic hooks. With the highly individualistic sound of Jonny Bruce on trumpet and impressive multi-instrumentalist Ben Waghorn on reeds, Stapleton has put together a band of high-rollers and high stakes winners.\n\nDDJ: S/T. Umlaut (UML009). Dec. 08. Young French trio based in Paris and price winner at the sought after jazz competition of Paris La Défense in 2007. Julien Desprez on guitar, Benjamin Dousteyssier on saxophone and Yann Joussein on drums can remind us of Tim Berne in his more experimental projects with guitarist Marc Ducret or the more electric versions of Curlew.\n\nDe Bethmann, Pierre: Cubique. Plus Loin. Recorded in June 2009 at Ferber Studio A (Paris), here's the new album by French pianist (here on Rhodes) Pierre De Bethmann and his septet, featuring among other vocalist Jeanne Added. A continuation of the Ilium project (2003), turned into a 7tet combo : voice, two reeds, guitar, and rhythm section. No doubt that the two strong voices here - the personalities - are the human one and the fabulous Fender Rhodes, the reeds and guitar having a more subtle role in contrapuntic lines or melodic support.\n\nDe Vito, Maria: Core (Coração). Via Veneto Jazz (VVJ115). Street date: 18-05-17. New album recorded between Rome and Paris, with special guest Chico Buarque on two tracks (the second being a duet sung in Neapolitan!).\n\nDe Wilde, Laurent: New Monk Trio. Gazebo (GAZ133V). Oct. 2017. At the occasion of Monk's 100 years birthday, pianist Laurent de Wilde, bass player Jérôme Regard and drummer Donald Kontomanou deliver an homage album arranged for acoustic trio and modernly played, clearly showing that the pianist's modernity goes beyond the limits of time; De Wilde also presents a personal composition - Tune for T - played on piano solo. Available on digipak with a 16-page booklet but also on vinyl with printed inner sleeve\n\nDi Meola, Al: Opus. Sheer Sound. New album, mainly acoustic and still exploring various styles, from tango, jazz to newer experiences like a musical conversation with himself!\n\nAfter many European concerts, Laurent Dehors: Dommage à Glenn is now available on CD.\n\nAlfonso Deidda: Lucky Man. Via Veneto (VVJ097). Feb. 2015. Saxophonist, composer, arranger and multi-instrumentalist Alfonso Deidda releases here his debut album; spontaneous and unpredictable, yet focused and highly melodic, the repertoire is composed of well-conceived, original jazz songs with underlying contemporary grooves - ranging from Latin, European jazz, to free, and funk - where the interplay between musicians is intimate and technically brilliant, resulting in engaging sound textures that are creatively out of the ordinary; vibrant with emotional tension.\n\nDelirium: Green Side Up. ILK 172. March 2012. Led by Finnish saxophonistMikko Innanen, this band inspired by the heritage of Ornette Coleman also features three of the best players from the Danish scene: drummer Stefan Pasborg, cornetist Kasper Tranberg and bass player Jonas Westergaard; they were recorded in Copenhagen in 2009.\n\nJean Derome / Louis Sclavis Quartet: Un Moment De Bonheur. Live in Quebec. Sclavis brought with him bassist Bruno Chevillon and Derome's drummer Pierre Tanguay.\n\nDeurloo, Hermine: Crazy Clock. TWM 001. Oct. 06. Member of the Willem Breuker's Kollektief since the 90's, Hermine is one of the few challenging harmonicists at work. For her 3rd album, she offers us re-readings of Hendrix's Electric Ladyland or pieces by Ali Farka Touré, the \"Throughout\" of guitarist Bill Frisell and more yet. If you think you knew what playing the harmonica was about, you may reconsider it an extra time!\n\nDiego Schissi Quinteto: Tongos. Untref Sonoro. 2010. Here's another post-Piazzola work of high complexity and great compositional quality, written for a classical tango instrumentation: piano, bandoneon, violin, bass and guitar. Passionately and whole-heartedly recommended!\n\nDigital Primitives: Hum Crackle`n Pop. Hopscotch HOP 42. Oct. 09. This is the first album from a trio led by multi-instrumentist Cooper-Moore, here playing keyboards, flute, harp, zither, banjo, etc... With him are saxophonist Assif Tsahar, by many considered as the spiritual continuation of Albert Ayler, and drummer Chad Taylor, coming from Marc Ribot's band (Spiritual Unity). Blues-edged funk with ethnic colorations and the kind of free jazz typical of the loft generations are what our guys deliver here. Other titles are also available on the same label: \"Planet Dream\" from the same trio, \"Lost Brother\" (from 2005, with drummer Hamid Drake replacing Taylor), \"Tells Untold\" (duo Cooper-Moore / Tsahar).\n\nDinamitri Jazz Folklore & Amiri Baraka: Live in Sant'anna Arresi 2013. Rudi Records (RRJ1019). Feb. 2016. This is a live recording from the Sardinian festival of St. Anna Arresi, where Baraka appeared in 2013 as part of the Dinamitri Jazz Folklore, a marvelous Italian ensemble directed by alto saxophonist Dimitri Grechi Espinoza. The music takes shape from a sound ritual based on voice and bells, and it slowly develops through various soundscapes including echoes of Africa, deep Blues, modern jazz tributes to Sun Ra, and a long sequence of highly infectious grooves. A tight combination of poetry, orchestral arrangements and collective improvisation. A very strong sound narrative built around Baraka's unforgettable voice and words.\n\nDionne, Vincent. Mostly known for his 70's work with Bregent in the progressive musical fields, the Canadian artist did later released two solo albums: \"Destinations\" and \"Parade\". These albums came out in 1988 and 1991 respectively. Both these albums have aspects of e-music, minimalism, and ECM-ish jazz. \"Destinations\" is mostly a trio work with Dionne on drums/percussion/synth, Paul McCandless of Oregon on woodwinds, and Roxanne Turcotte on keyboards. \"Parade\" is Vincent aided by five or six musicians on different tracks performing similar instrumentation, plus bass and tabla. There is a McCandless composition on this one and also a Michel-Georges Brégent composition. Both albums are now available, gathered and reissued on one single CD!\n\nDirty Six: S/T. Via Veneto Jazz (VVJ127). Street date: 31-01-19. Debut album for this new Italian quintet featuring Claudio Filippini on the piano, the saxophonist Daniele Scannapieco, Gianfranco Campagnoli on the trumpet, Roberto Schiano on trombone and the rhythm section, with a noticeable sound impact, composed of Tommaso Scannapieco on electric bass and double bass and Lorenzo Tucci on drums. Jazz, R & B, Funky and Afro contaminations are cleverly combined together by the six musicians.\n\nDjivilli Quintet: Give Five. Vade Retro VD0105. Gipsy jazz in the tradition of Django: solo guitar, violin, two rythm guitars and bass.\n\nThe Documentary: Sights and Sounds from the Recording of \"The Sound of New York Jazz Underground\". (See details in the jazz section under Freshsound)\n\nReleases from a small label: Dodicilune!\n\n+ Kenny Wheeler & Brian Dickinson: Still Waters. ED 213. fluegelhorn and piano for charming ballads composed around the thematic idea of water. A forgotten recording to rediscover!\n\n+ Antonello Messina: Aziyz. ED 225. The leader is playing the piano, accordion and bandoneon. With the trumpet of Fabrizio Bosso, a rhythm section and a few guests, a musical universe made of rigorously constructed melodies, a subtile blend of sounds between instruments, well crafted improvisations, opens itself to us!\n\n+ Andrea Sabatino: Pure Soul. ED 221. An album made by the new Italian generation, fresh and energetic, percussive and ludic!\n\nDouglas, Dave & Keystone: Moonshine. Green Leaf (GRE 1006). Nov. 2010. Live recording by the electric version of the trumpetist's band, featuring Adam Benjamin on Fender Rhodes, DJ Olive on laptop and turntables, drummer Gene Lake and bass player Brad Jones, tenor saxophonist Marcus Strickland.\n\nA Douglas, Dave boxset is planned for release in October 2012! Part of the Black Saint (BS) & Soul Note (SN) monographic boxset collection aimed at recounting the most beautiful chapters that revolutionised the history of jazz, this one gathers the following albums: Parallel Worlds (SN 1993), Five (SN 1996), Convergence (SN 1999), John Coltrane's Ascension (BS 1995, a live recording with the Rova Saxophone Quartet), Bounce (BS 1998, with the John Lindberg Ensemble), Force Green (SN 1995, an album by bass player Mark Dresser).\n\nDouglas, Dave: Three Views. Greenleaf (GRE 1023). Dec. 2011. This 3CD set testifies of the trumpetist's creativity and productivity. Disc 1, Rare Metals, adds 5 new compositions to the repertoire of the Brass Ecstasy, in direct lineage with Lester Bowie's Brass Fantasy; disc 2, Orange Afternoons, has Douglas directing a prestigious quintet, featuring among other saxophonist Ravi Coltrane and pianist Vijay Iyer; disc 3, Bad Mango, is the most experimental, Douglas facing the many percussions (marimba, drums, glockenspiel, saw, small bells, toys, etc..) of the So Percussion Quartet\n\nDouglas, Dave: Meaning And Mystery. Greenleaf GRE04. June 06. This third album by the quintet of the eclectic trompetist is inspired by the late 60's period of Miles Davis (with such albums as Filles de Kilimandjaro, Miles in the Sky, In a Silent Way), but also by the actual quartet of Wayne Shorter or the combos led by Julius Hemphill or Baikida Carroll. We find on piano and Rhodes the great Uri Caine while the bass and drums chairs are occupied by James Genus & Clarence Penn\n\nDouglas, Dave: Keystone (GRE 03). Oct. 2005. This brand new set by Douglas is inspired by the life and films of silent movies actor Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle. 11 original sound tracks revisited by an energetic band, not unlike Martin, Medeski & Wood and featuring among others Jamie Safton würlitzer or DJ Olive on turntables. the DVD presents us the film \"Fatty and Mable Adrift\" as well as a reworked video of another comics classic.\n\nNew from trumpetist Dave Douglas! His albums for Arabesque Jazzwill finally be released in 2006 in France during the Spring\n\n+ Leap Of Faith (98). Quartet featuring saxophonist Chris PotterJames Genus and drummer Ben Perowski. AJ 145\n\n+ Magic Triangle (97). Same formation pusshing away the boundaries of free bop. AJ 139.\n\nDPZ: He's Looking At You, Kid. E-Motive Records (EMO 901). This rather new French project is the collaboration work of saxophonist Thomas De Pourquery (member of the group \"Le Sacre du Tympan\") and trombonist Daniel Zimmermann (member of Andy Emler's Megaoctet). Sound, improvisation and writing are here at the service of a lyricism and a communicative energy leaning towards a rock approach. Dark, passionate, with a burning rhythm section and the guitar of Maxime Delpierre, another new name belonging the young generation of upcoming musicians\n\nDreamtime: Double Trouble. Reel Recordings (RR018/019/020). 2010. Dreamtime is an international quintet featuring prominent names of the British jazz scene (and partly progressive rock as well) like Welsh trombone player Nick Evans or American expatriated trumpetist Jinm Dvorak. This excellent package provides 2 CDs and 1 DVD. Disc One presents a stunning set by the quintet before an appreciative audience at the 1986 Bracknell Jazz Festival, as introduced by compere Lol Coxhill. Disc Two lets us experience a rare 1991 recording of the Dreamtime quintet doubled up with friends: Paul Rutherford on trombone; Paul Dunmall on tenor and baritone saxophones; Kevin Davy on trumpet; Marcio Mattos on bass and Mark Sanders on drums. To bring the Dreamtime into a multi-sensory realm, Disc 3 is an all-region DVD of an amateur film made at London's 100 Club in 2006. In this performance the sextet, including pianist Keith Tippett, play homage to their late friend, Elton Dean. What more can be said for the music? Everything that listening will give testament to! Double Trouble presents three discs with an ear and eye towards an overdue reappraisal of this much loved band of musical misfits, known today as \"the dreamers\".\n\nDreamtime: Cathanger '86 (HUXO55). Released: 28/06/2004. Dreamtime was formed in 1982 as a jazz trio featuring Nick Evans (tb), Gary Curson (sax) and Jim LeBaigue (dms). However in the same year it augmented to a quintet with the addition of Jim Dvorak (tp) and Roberto Bellatalla (b), then finally later to a sextet with the addition of pianist Keith Tippett.\n\nDrouet / Frith / Sclavis: Contretemps, etc... In Situ (IS244). Oct. 2011. New meeting between the three musicians, recorded here during the 26th festival of jazz and improvised music in Besançon, 2007.\n\nDumoulin, Jozef & Orca Noise Unit: A Beginner's Guide to Diving and Flying. Yolk (J2072). March 2018. Featuring among other Sylvaine Hélary, Bruno Chevillon, Antonin-Tri Hoang, this album is based and focusing on the faculty of some people to consciously travel through dreams. Orca Noise Unit is in fact the anagram of \"oneironautics\", the name of this faculty!\n\nPaul Dunmall / Tony Bianco / Dave Kane: Ritual Beyond. FMR Records (FMRCD286-0210). 2010. The British trio was recorded at Delbury Hall on July 15th 2009. With a post Trane high energy and exhuberance, this trio is a tight and dense unit who has something to say and they say it loud, with force and convinction!\n\nDunmall / Edwards / Gibbs / Sanders: Boundless. FMR Records (FMRCD278-0709). 2010. Top British musicians are gathered for this recording made in Bristol on January 17th 2008. The great saxophonist Paul Dunmall teams with bass player John Edwards and drummer Mark Sanders (heard in several projects with for example ex-Soft Machine saxophonist Elton Dean), while guitarist Philip Gibbs complete the line-up.\n\nDupont, Hubert: Jasmim. Ultrack (UTK 1002). 2013. The French bass player, inspired by the revolution of the Arabic Spring, comes here with an already much praised album, whose musical thread would be words like reuniting or bringing together. To this purpose, he has invited a talented Syrian flutist - Naïssam Jalal, a famous Parisian sax player - Denis Guivarc'h, a fantastic Brazilian guitarist - Nelson Veras and an oriental magician of percussion - Youssef Hbeisch. The poetic dream of reunited Mediterranean countries has started!\n\nEarth: The Bees Made Honey In The Lion's Skull. Southern Lord SUNN90. The Bee Made Honey In The Lion's Skull finds Dylan Carlson and the band growing into a harder, more rock and American gospel oriented and improvisitory direction framed by a truly psychedelic production and blazing guitar sounds. Earth shows its affinity with a nod to the best elements of the more adventurous San Francisco bands of the late 60s and 70s, and the more spiritually aware and exciting forms of jazz-rock from the same era. This is no nostalgia trip but a thoroughly inspired and original metamorphosis. Earth is honoured to be joined on this record for three songs by legendary and virtuoso guitarist Bill Frisell (doing some of his most fuzzed out playing in years). Frisell adds a brilliant texture and counterpoint to the scintillating riffs of Dylan Carlson and the band. On drums is Adrienne Davies , lending a classic and steady feel to the proceedings. Back in the band is Steve Moore , adding heavy Hammond organ and his intense jazz-inspired piano playing. Live bassist Don McGreevy also makes his full-length Earth debut on this record.\n\nEl Heladero: Cajas (2003). MDR Records (MDR1403). Auspicious debut album by this Argentinean acoustic jazz quartet, not too far away from the Hard Bop realm. The group is headed by bassist and main composer Alejandro Frenkel, whose songwriting presents a focused interest in the harmonic factor, improvisations with constant harmonic shifts and intimacy. A second saxophonist, Alberto Garantón, appear as soloist on tenor\n\nElefante: S/T. 2008. Pai Records. Young, up-and-coming Argentinean sextet with musical references to Blue Note's hard-bop, spiced up with a wonderful Fender Rhodes; The group's compositions are original in their conception and a tight control of intensity and dynamics bring forth some powerful tensions as well as define the group's musical esthetics. A band to follow!\n\nEllman, Liberty: Orthodoxy (RG 01). Reissue of a well received album by the guitarist on his own label Red Giant, released in 1997. Ellman was member of the first incarnation of Steve Coleman's Mystic Rhythm Society and has also been partner of such great names as Greg Osby or Henry Threadgill.\n\nElton Dean Quartet: On Italian Roads (Live in Milan 1979). British Progressive Jazz (BPJ012STC). Street date: 12-08-22. Digipak. First official release for what many fans consider to be the 'ultimate' lineup of Elton's Quartet, with drummer Louis Moholo, bassist Harry Miller and pianist Keith Tippett. Comes with extensive liner notes and a booklet including dozens of previously unseen images of the quartet. The music was recorded on February 25th, 1979 at Teatro Cristallo, Milano.\n\nElton Dean's Ninesense: The 100 Club Concert 1979. Reel Recordings (RR024). 2012. The Canadian based label releases a stunning two compact disc celebrating the thirty-third anniversary of The 100 Club Concert 1979. Complimenting this release is a twelve page booklet from the pen and archive of Riccardo Bergerone, the young Italian friend of Elton who recorded this extraordinary concert using a Pro Sony TC-D5M cassette recorder at the stage front table. All of the musical magic from the compositions and soloists are potently heard and on full display, including two hitherto unrecorded renditions of Elton's magnificent charts. Completing Riccardo's special document of Elton's Ninesense in full concert flight is an inner three panel photo gallery of Ninesense in concert.\n\nEnrico Fazio Ensemble: Girotondo. We Insist! (CDWEIN17). Street date: 03-06-22. The idea for Girotondo is taken from the play of the same name written by Arthur Schnitzler. Like the characters in Schnitzler's text, here the musicians are invited to take part in a series of dialogues in pairs, so as to form a chain, a roundabout: the first with the second, the second with the third, until the last one joins the first, closing the circle. The musicians have been matched by lot to a theatre character, so that the duets are the random result. Fazio acts as a guest, an external narrator to the couples, elaborating an electronic introduction that represents the scenic space in which the encounters develop, and a final roundabout in which everyone is involved.\n\nEnzo Pietropaoli Wire Trio: Woodstock Reloaded. Via Veneto Jazz (VVJ123). Street date: 15-03-18. This album wasn't conceived to be a cover but an original re-reading, an update of the reverberating impact and a reminder of those emotions, animating memories and encompassing the milestones that followed as it approaches through time. This is a tribute to the festival and a narration of the turning points and evolution of musical language from that moment to present day.\n\nEspen Berg Trio: Free To Play. Odin (ODINCD9569). Street date: 06-09-19. New album by the Norwegian pianist, a raising star on the jazz scene, both in Europa and Japan.\n\nEthnic Duo: En Public au \"Chêne Noir\" d'Avignon, 1980. Musea Parallèle (MP3128). June 2010. The disappearance of legendary Zao after the album \"Typareth\" (1977) had left a big gap among the numerous fans of keyboardist François \"Faton\" Cahen and his fellow saxophonist-flutist Yochk'o Seffer.. This led in turn to the creation of this duo, with one single eponymous album recorded in 1980 by our two men. If - as many fans - you were left thirsty of more, here's a live recording dating from the same year as their studio album and a new chance for all to rediscover the power and inspiration of this duo!\n\nFAB Trio: Live in Amsterdam. Porter Records (POR 4014). March 09. Recorded in 2008, this is the 4th album by this trio made of violinist Billy Bang, bass player Joe Fonda and drummer Barry Altschul\n\nFariselli, Patrizio: Acqua Liquida Suite. 2007. (NUN 0180602). Brand new record by ex-Area keyboards player Patrizio Fariselli, with the help of Paolino Dalla Porta on double bass and Massimo Manzi on drums. A suite in seven movements for Fariselli's jazz trio.\n\nFerra / Dalla Porta / Sferra: Frames Of Crimson. Via Veneto Jazz (VVJ114). Street date: 30-03-17. This project will have to be placed in the prolongation of another, similar in spirit: The Crimson Jazz Trio! Guitarist Bebo Ferra has indeed drilled into Fripp's acclaimed and intricate works, delving into the soul of each one and embarking on unexplored soundscapes, together with Paolino Dalla Porta on double bass, Fabrizio Sferra on drums and - as special guest on trombone - Gianluca Petrella. They have gone off the beaten track, in the footsteps of a pioneer, becoming forerunners themselves in bringing Fripp's music ... elsewhere!\n\nFirst Meeting: Cut The Rope. Libra Records (104-025). 2009. The latest and newest quartet in the Libra roster is a noise improvisation project led by trumpetist Natsuki Tamura, also featuring his wife, pianist and composer Satoko Fujii. The line up is completed by guitarist Kelly Churko and drummer Tatsuhisa Yamamoto. Conventional melody and structure are here replaced by fragmentation, textural and timbral explorations. The album is made of total improvisations that sound complete and organic because the careful listening, expert judgment, and musicianship of the band members shapes the music. Be it metallic clingin cymbals, piercing wails from the trumpet, gamelan sounding prepared piano or electric staccato bursts from the guitar, there is an amazing use of texture and tone color throughout that will keep the listener in a state of excitement\n\nFiuczynski, David: Flam! Blam! Pan-Asian MicroJam! Rare Noise Records. March 2016. After his previous attempt on the album \"Planet MicroJam\", the New York based guitarist pushes the envelope even further on his latest microtonal project, Flam! Blam! Pan-Asian MicroJam! Jointly dedicated to 20th century classical composer Olivier Messiaen and innovative hip-hop record producer J Dilla, this ambitious venture has the guitarist-composer pursuing his passion for the notes that fall between the cracks with his intrepid microtonal crew. The seven movements that comprise Flam! instigated by Fiuczynski receiving a 2011 Guggenheim Fellowship, show the connections between exotic bird calls and J Dilla's famous \"flam beats\" while also referencing the colors of Messiaen's music, Gagaku, the ancient court music of Japan, and other Pan-Asian ingredients. The three extra tracks that comprise Blam! feature special guest Rudresh Mahanthappa on alto saxophone. Fiuczynski is joined on both portions of his latest release by former Microjam Institute students Utar Artun on microtonal keyboard, Yazhi Guo on suona (Chinese oboe) and percussion, Helen Sherrah-Davies on violin, Jack Sherman on microtonal keyboard, Justin Schornstein on bass and Alex Bailey on drums.\n\nFlat Earth Society: Cheer Me, Perverts! Crammed Discs (CRAM 138). 2009. New album by Peter Vermeersch's 14-piece band, whose title is indeed an anagram of his name! New repertory but still the bitter-acid-sweet delirium we can expect from this musical chameleon!\n\nThe Fonda / Stevens Group: Memphis. Playscape Recordings (PSR 033108). Oct. 09. Featuring trumpetist Herb Robertson and drummer Harvey Sorgen, this is the 4th studio album by this outfit; as pianist Michael Jefrey Stevens today is based in Memphis, the title may be seen as an elogy to a town that is in fact a true musical melting-pot, like the band as well?\n\nFortune, Sonny: Live At The A-trane. Konnex / Atonal. March 07. The ex Miles Davis member, saxophonist and flutist is joining here in 2005 the trio of German drummer Ernst Bier, which also features guitar and organ.\n\nFrancesco Diodati Yellow Squeeds: Flow, Home. Auand (AU9056). 8-10-15. Italian guitar player Francesco Diodati presents here his third album as leader and a new Italian quintet, featuring Enrico Zanisi on piano, Enrico Morello on drums, Glauco Benedetti on tuba and Francesco Lento on trumpet. Diodati is also a member of Enrico Rava's New Quartet and has an ongoing duo project with the Italian trumpet player. The band results from the union of many approaches and styles, thus enriching Diodati's originals with a timbric range and countless expressive possibilities, including a tribute to Thelonious Monk, Diodati's musician of choice, here celebrated with a daring reinterpretation of Played Twice, which shows the interplay skills of this young yet wise quintet.\n\nFranck Vaillant Benzine: Skits for the Ears. Gazul (GA 8860). July 2012. This fourth album under the Benzine monniker is the result of the close co-operation between drummer and composer Franck Vaillant and sound-engineer Philippe Teissier Du Cros. All tracks were first composed and programmed during a journey through many Caribbean islands. The next stage was to have musicians improvise over the tracks; among them are flutist Magic Malik and French jazz saxophonist Sylvain Cathala; the recordings were then re-organised, edited and re-composed. The result consists in 15 very diverse tracks, with a unique and uncompromising texture; the music is led by a thorough research on field depth, on the arrangement of layers, rhythmic and theatrical illusions and a complex layout of textures, all of which are served by the great sonic quality. This conspicuously experimental and abstract work will lead you on a sentimental sci-fi journey to be rediscovered every time.\n\nFrode Gjerstad Trio: Forgotten City. PNL Records (PNL050). Street date: 12-06-20. In fact not really a trio but rather a quartet, as alongside the well oiled duo of Gjerstad and drummer Paal Nilssen-Love, we find an interactive post for the bass chair, made of two musicians having decided to play together as one instrument and also having both - but individually - a past experience with the trio: Øyvind Storesund and Jon Rune Strøm. This is easy for them to change roles whenever they want; if one takes charge of the bass function, the other is freed and can play free-form. This fexibility also brings new challenges to both drummer and reedman!\n\nFujii, Satoko: Gen Himmel (Libra 201-033). USA release in August 2013. This is the third CD of Satoko Fujii solo piano music.\n\nFujii, Satoko! I have always been in awe when looking at the impressive discography of the Japanese pianist and its diversity! Her pianistic expression has always deeply moved me but if you had the quality of her meticulously chosen and numerous musical partners, you're in for a great great treat! From her trio with drummer Jim Black and bass player Mark Dresser to the various Western or Eastern big bands to jazz-rock/fusion combos with her husband, the list is long! I decided that Music By Mail should have most of her output on our catalog for sale. So if you want to initiate a long journey in her fantastic musical thoughts, contact us by mail and we'll make sure that you get it!\n\nThe Japanese pianist Satoko Fujii makes again the actuality with 3 new releases on her own label, planned for June 2008:\n\nSatoko Fujii Trio : Trace A River. Libra 203-020. A new recording in four years by her longstanding trio with bassist Mark Dresser and drummer Jim Black . \"Trace a River\" finds them expanding on and refining the collective artistry they have developed over the past 10 years. Satoko still succeeds in finding new ways to showcase the trio's ensemble empathy and individual brilliance.\n\nJunk Box : Cloudy Then Sunny. Libra 203-019. This is the 2nd release by this trio featuring trumpeter and husband Natsuki Tamura and percussionist John Hollenbeck. The new release is both unpredictable and provocative. Fujii doesn't use conventional notation in her compositions for this group, instead the scores include words and some graphic elements. The result is what she calls \"composed improvisation,\" an approach that blurs the line between the consciously conceived and the instantly performed and allows the players wide improvisational freedom alongside some composed direction.\n\nGato Libre: Kuro. Libra 104-018. Gato Libre is more in a world vein with an all acoustic sound calling for trumpet, guitar, accordion (played by Satoko) and bass. The music seems to emanate from no particular country on Earth, but comes instead directly from Tamura's own unique imagination, a quirky land where European folk idioms and modern improvisatory techniques have formed a special bond. Kuro finds the band exploring the furthest reaches of Tamura's concepts, in an album that feels like the soundtrack to a vaguely narrative dream.\n\nFutari: Beyond. Libra Records (202-061). Street date: 30-05-20. Delayed by a misfunctioning postal service, this is the duo of Taiko Saito (vibraphone) with pianist Satoko Fujii, recorded during their first Japan tour in 2019.\n\nGard Nilsen Acoustic Unity: To Whom Who Buys A Record. Odin Records ( ODINCD9570 or 2LP ODINLP9570). Street date: 12-07-19. Gard Nilssen is artist-in-residence under 2019's Molde Jazz Festival. This album is the third released with this trio, created in 2014 and featuring bass player Petter Eldh and saxophonist André Roligheten. Expect a dense playing rich in musical ideas!\n\nGard Nilssen's Supersonic Orchestra: If You Listen Carefully The Music Is Yours. ODINCD9572. Street date: 07-02-20. The Norwegian drummer and composer Gard Nilssen has been artist in residency for the kazz Molde festival and this new band is its materialized result: an unusually big band, with three drummers, three bass players and ten horn players, most of them saxophonits! Challenging, courageous and genre-defying, here is a music reflecting the freedom of mind and energy of his creator!\n\nGari, Ananda : T-Duality. Auand (AU9041). Nov. 2014. Ananda Gari is a young Italian drummer and composer. This is his 2nd album, featuring saxophonist Tim Berne, guitarist Rez Abbasi and bassist Michael Formanek; it represents the result of all his past studying and performing experiences and clearly shows his deep interest in free improvisation, avant-garde music and complex rhythmic approaches.\n\nGarrobé, Joan: Música Infidel. Bebyne Records (CDB 010). Release date: April 1st, 2013. With an impressive solo career already behind him, guitarist Joan Garrobé delivers here a trio recording with Jordi Camp on double bass and Lluís Ribalta on drums & percussion. The atmosphere of the album is elegant and tasty, highlighting a very natural sound of the acoustic guitar. The trio sounds compact and fresh and the original songs and arrangements make every minute a total pleasure to the ears. The great Carles Benavent plays electric bass on \"Guindilla\", his original composition and another guest is also featured, percussionist David Casamitjana\n\nGato Libre: Shiro. Libra Records (104-026). 2009. Shiro is the 4th recording under this moniker and dedicated to the exploration of a South-European sound; it has a definitely quiet and world-like character, with leader and (usually) pianist Satoko Fujii here shifting to accordion, accompanied on trumpet by her husband Natsuki Tamura, whose playing in this context appears much traditional (though at times the two of them can bring it quite \"out\" and near to chaos). Bass and guitar complete the instrumentation.\n\nPierrejean Gaucher: Zappe Satie. Musiclip (mu 2103). Street date: 05-03-21. Digipak. After having immersed himself in the musical universe of Frank Zappa, the French guitarist now (re)discovered a composer whom he considers to be a possible grandfather of Zappa. This new album also marks his return to writing with a whole new repertoire, carried by young and brilliant musicians who have been making jazz news in France for years (ONJ, Ping Machine, PJ5, Sarab?). To the core quartet of guitar, Fender Rhodes, acoustic bass and drums are added / invited several \"blowers\" on saxophone, trumpet, trombone and clarinet.\n\nPierrejean Gaucher: Melody Makers 2. Musiclip (MU1205). June 2012. After a first opus paying tribute to British pop, the French guitarist returns to the subject with ten new original compositions. Besides the leader on guitars, the trio includes Clément Petit on 4 & 5-string cello and Cédric Affre on drums and percussion. The CD also includes a bonus video of the group's work in the studio.\n\nMusic By Mail recently decided to focuse on the legacy of French guitarist PierreJean Gaucher and offer you to rediscover or finally get your hands on some of his projects needing more light. Feel free to contact us, here are some of the albums in stock:\n\n- Abus Dangereux: Le Quatrième Mouvement. Recorded in 1979 and certainly the most progressive of all, with at times a noticeable Zeuhl touch\n\n- Zappe Zappa. As the name maybe reveals, this is a project anchored in the universe of guitarist Frank Zappa. The studio album, recorded in 1997, features bass player Daniel Yvinec, today directing the famous and respected French State big band, L'Orchestre National de Jazz. In the group is also an old acquaintance from the time of Abus Dangereux, saxophonist Bobby Rangell. The other album is a live recording from 2002 at the Bürgerhaus Stollwerck in Köln, Germany.\n\n- Phileas Band is basically a quartet + guests and the band stretches into several musical corners, from Celtic to Balkans or Latin\n\n- The duo with guitarist Christophe Godin may be the most overseen album of PierreJean's discography. But Godin having acquired quite a reputation and following with his metal-fusion band Morglbl, this should soon lead to a prompt rediscovery of this live album powered only by their two electric guitars. What they can do with it has to be heard!\n\nPierreJean Gaucher: Melody Makers. Musiclip (MU 1009). This new trio album by the guitarist and leader of the French band Abus Dangereux is entirely a cover album! PierreJean Gaucher wants to show his fascination and love of melodies that printed a mark on him. Be it Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir\" or \"Dinosaur\" by King Crimson, the dedication is strong and the \"making of\" well crafted. Acoustic and electric guitars, electro-acoustic 5-strings cello, drums and percussions are the tools used to fashion this revisited world made of smiles, laughes and memories. Welcome!\n\nGayle, Charles: No Bills. Long Arms LA 05057. Oct. 06. Solo recording (sax and piano) from Moscow and Arkhangelsk in April 2003 by one of the free players with the most incredible intensity and spiritual dedication\n\nGee Hye Lee: Geenius Monday. HGBS Musikproduktion (HG20014). Nov. 2010. This young lady came all the way from South Korea to Stuttgart in order to study classical piano but ended in the MPS studios after having jammed and played jazz in clubs for years. The result is this, her 2nd album where nearly fourty jazzers from the Stuttgart area accompanied her, ranging from seniors like trumpeter Herbert Joos to juniors like saxers Andi Maile or Sandi Kuhn.\n\nGeel, Elisabeth: So Cool. MP Records MPRCD 048. 2006. The newest release from this Italian label presents us with a nice surprise: Elisabeth Geel is a songwriter and singer with a warm, powerful and precise voice and her compositions, quite rooted in jazz (acoustic and electric), are challenging; so are the lyrics too, serious stuff. Along her own music, she also interprets a few classsic jazz and bossa standards. A very cool debut album, between Joni Mitchell & Patricia Barber!\n\nGeoff Goodman Quintet: Tall Tales and Dreams (Tutu CD 888222). Intelligent music penned by the leader and guitarist Geoff Goodman, characterized by a complex balance between form and improvisation, control and spontaneous impulse. The band consists of: Felix Wahnschaffe: alto saxophone; Rudi Mahall: bass-clarinet; Geoff Goodman: el-guitars & banjo; Henning Sieverts: bass & cello; Peter Perfido: drums & percussion.\n\nGeorge Schuller Quintet: Round 'Bout Now. Playscape Recordings PSR021302. Nov. 06. This octet wants to pay an homage to the crucial Miles Davis quintet from the period 1967-1969. They do this by covering 3 of his compositions (Sidecar, Circle in the Round et Filles de Kilimanjaro), presented in new personal arrangements. This is sometimes very close to the \"Meaning and Mystery\" album previously done by trumpetist Dave Douglas. The instrumentation of the band is rich and varied: alto flute, sax, trumpet and horn (played by Ingrid Jensen), vibraphone, kaval, bass clarinet, guitar, accordion, bass, drums and percussion.\n\nGewelt, Terje: House On A Hill. Resonant Music (RM282). Street date: 13-11-20. This is the 12th album released by the established bass player and composer, featuring the same line up as on his much acclaimed 2017 album \"Wow and Flutter\": Bjørn Klakegg on guitar, Erlend Slettevoll on piano and keyboards, Terje Evensen on drums and elektronics. An album of maturity, marked by a recent touring activity in Brazil as well as the deep prints of our uncertain pandemic time! Questionings, emotive reactions, deep musical thoughts about our future, have been encapsulated by the much respected sound engineer Tor Magne Hallibakken for what may become Gewelt's best production.\n\nGhost Horse: Il Bene Comune. Hora Records (HORA005-2205-CD). Street date: 22-07-22. Composed during Italy's second Covid lockdown in the winter of 2020-21 through digital correspondence and illicit face-to-face meetings, the underlying structure of this music hinges on shared familiarity with the basic modules, predominantly simple, repeating motifs. This simplicity allows for significant individual freedom for each member of the sextet, however this freedom must be exercised responsibly in order to maintain balance within the greater structure and avoid total collapse or loss of the central message. Also available on LP (HORA005-2205).\n\nGilmore, David: Unified Presence (KRM-CD-1124). 11 tracks for this new record by one of the most in-demand guitarists in jazz, previous companion of Steve Coleman in his \"5 Elements\" band. Featured both on electric or acoustic guitar, David called this time for a number of reknown partners such as Christian McBride on bass, Ravi Coltrane on saxophone (yes, John Coltrane's son!), and drummer Jeff \"Tain\"Watts.\n\nGiovanni Maier Technicolor: Featuring Marc Ribot / A Turtle Soup. Long Song LSR 105. June 08. This is a double keyboards + rhythm section quartet. Maier is known as the bass player of among other the Italian Instabile Orchestra or more recently the Daniele Cavallanti Electric Unit and even the frequent partner of trumpetist Enrico Rava. Here on electric bass, he offers us a record between fusionish flies (where Ribot reminds us of Jeff Beck or even Mike Stern) and more etherical ambiances.\n\nGiuliani, Rosario: Love In Translation. Via Veneto Jazz (VVJ133). Street date: 24-01-20. This album marks the return of an exciting collaboration between two protagonists of the international jazz scene which started twenty years ago at Umbria Jazz: Italian sax player Rosario Giuliani and US vibraphonist Joe Locke, now accompanied by two other renowned artists, bassist Dario Deidda and drummer Roberto Gatto. With this intense and sophisticated album, Rosario and Joe celebrate the twentieth anniversary of their alchemical partnership and friendship. As the album's title itself suggests, Love in Translation is centered around the theme of love - the most powerful and enigmatic emotion. Among the famous standards contained are \"Duke Ellington's Sound of Love\" by Charles Mingus, \"Love Letters\" by Victor Young and Edward Heyman, and \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" of Elvis Presley's repertoire. It includes creative and warm original songs as well as tributes to two remarkable musicians: \"Raise Heaven\" which Joe Locke dedicates to Roy Hargrove and \"Tamburo\" by Rosario Giuliani to Marco Tamburini.\n\nFrode Gjerstad / Fred Lonberg-Holm / Michael Zerang: Sugar Maple. FMR Records (FMRCD289-0410). April 2010. The Norwegian saxophonist and clarinetist is here recorded with his new trio in a club from Milwaukee, USA. Lonberg-Holm is on cello & electronics, Zerang on percussion. They deliver a little more than one hour music, spread on 4 tracks, each giving plenty of time for the building of their free collective improvisation\n\nKarolina Glazer: Normal (JARO 4296-2). 2009. Recognized as the rising star of Polish jazz vocalism, Karolina Glazer specializes in an instrumental approach to the voice and directs a lot of her attention to scat improvisation. With her 4-octave scale and a great imagination, she delivers on \"Normal\" a journey across various cultural spots of the world combined with harmony and jazz tradition, mixing Arabic scales with Latin sounds, drum'n'bass with jazz. She is not alone either and many musicians contribute to the final result; among them, bass celebrity and sound maker Krzysztof Scieranski (Laboratorium, String Connection) or vibraphonist Bernard Maseli have to be pointed at and thanked for their great input!\n\nMichel Godard - Günter \"Baby\" Sommer - Patrick Bebelaar: Three Seasons. HGBS Musikproduktion (HGBS 20039). Digipak 2014. Godard on tuba, serpent and bass, Sommer on drums & percussion and Bebelaar on piano. \"Three Seasons\" essence is in particular that each one of the three musicians contributes his very own \"fragrance\", thus at the same time finding the counterpoints with spontaneous and mutual operations, fed by a repertoire of already in other contexts tested and new pieces.\n\nBrian Goder: Torque. Latham Records 5106-2. The composer, trumpetist and ensemble leader Brian Goder releases here an album with the Sam Rivers trio, featuring bassistDoug Mathews and drummer Anthony Cole, both being members since respectively 1993 and 1991. Rivers is heard here both on sax and flute and the innovative compositions of the trumpeter offer a perfect framework to his inspired improvisation skills.\n\nGoldberg, Stu: Eye of the Beholder. Promising Music (MPS 441112). June 2010. This was the 2nd recording of the ex-Mahavishnu member for the German label MPS, originally recorded in Hollywood in 1981.
