        "text": "If you look at your calendar - you may notice that December 25th is fast approaching - and the end of 2022 is nigh. The fast charging end to the year has us pondering what will be in our “round up” show for the end of December and the start of 2023. Suffice it to say, with all of the challenges, 2022 has been also filled with many blessings for fans, performers and presenters of jazz.\n\nFor now, we’ll celebrate the holidays - a visit with Roger Humphries about his upcoming Holiday Concert with Anita Levels at the O’Reilly Theater - December 19th. Roger tells us there’ll be new arrangements by Joe Sheehan, a deep dive into the Count Basie holiday bag of happiness - and treats from the versatile vocalist Anita Levels.\n\nA couple of days later, the Pittsburgh Jazz Orchestra will bring its holiday sounds to the Pittsburgh Playhouse with trumpeter Sean Jones and vocalist Kim Nazarian, December 21st.\n\nAlong our way in this hour of the Scene, We’ll also hear Pittsburgh Holiday Jazz sounds from newly minted Pittsburghers the Colbys - plus Tania Grubbs, Katie Simone with Mark Lucas, Lisa Ferraro, Reid Hoyson with Hendrik Meurkens and John Shannon, Joe Negri and Johnny Costa.\n\nPlus - a newly discovered Oscar Peterson recording from Helsinki, 1971 - a trio that also featured Niels Henning-Ørsted Pedersen (bass) and Louis Hayes (drums)."
