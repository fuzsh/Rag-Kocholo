        "text": "I have admired and followed the work of trumpeter, flügelhornist, and trick vocalist Clark Terry for over fifty years. “CeeTee” was featured in the Tonight Show Orchestra during the Johnny Carson years. In that capacity, he had broken the colour barrier, as the first African American staff musician for a television network. His brief soloing and hip contributions to the “Stump the Band” segments were what attracted my attention in late adolescence. I was also mightily impressed by his playing on the 1964 LP entitled Oscar Peterson Trio + One and on another album that I acquired right afterwards, Lambert, Hendricks, and Bavan at Newport ’63, which also featured the Gildo Mahones Trio. I am pretty sure that I have more albums by Clark Terry than by any other jazz artist, and I never fail to come away from encountering his playing both smiling and shaking my head in wonder. I still cannot believe that I never saw him, or any other jazz artist for that matter, perform when we lived in New York from 1968 to 1971.\n\nSome months ago, somebody posted on the internet two pages from Clark Terry’s 1960 date book. It shows contact information – usually just phone numbers – for organizations and people whose surnames, given names, or nicknames began with C, D, or E. At the time, I thought, well, this is the coolest thing that I have ever seen, and I would love to get my hands on the whole date book. This item seems to have disappeared from the net, but I still have a copy. Here it is.\n\nAs you can see, some of the entries are hard to decipher or otherwise mysterious in their meaning or import.\n\nJust look at the names that are legible and readily recognizable and think about what it must have been like knowing all of those particular people. Every jazz fan to whom I have shown this has reacted with fascination, and there has resulted much conversation as to what access to the other pages might reveal.\n\nMore recently, I have found another item on the net that includes several pages from CeeTee’s 1959 date book. It includes details concerning concert dates, recording sessions, editing work, gig payment records, “to do lists”, and, again contact information. This is another document that I would love to see in its entirety. I wonder too how many such date books there are; it is implied in CeeTee’s autobiography that he maintained them throughout his long career, although for much of that time he also had an agency keeping track for him.\n\nIn this blog entry, I shall ruminate on the connections between Clark Terry and the various people and organizations listed on the two pages from the 1960 datebook. Sometimes the identity of the person and the connections with CeeTee are pretty obvious, the only difficulty being recognizing when one has said enough about them. In other cases, I was able to confirm after some investigation the precise nature of the relationship with the person in question. In still others, considerable detective work was required to suggest or establish clearly the circumstances under which CeeTee and that individual likely met. In some instances, I have been able to ascertain who the individual in question likely was, without having been able to determine with any confidence the specifics of the relationship. And, finally, there are some entries for which I have no clue as to the person’s identity.\n\nDuke was, of course, Edward Kennedy “Duke” Ellington, whom Clark revered as a youngster and for whom he played from 1951 to 1959, and occasionally in the early 1960s. I need say no more.\n\nDizzy obviously refers to the exciting and revolutionary bebop genius, John Birks “Dizzy” Gillespie, who once called CeeTee the greatest jazz trumpet player on earth. Clark Terry’s playing comes out of Roy Eldridge and Charlie Shavers, with the discernible half-valve influence of Rex Stewart as well, and the same could be said for Dizzy Gillespie’s playing. The two met as early as 1946, and possibly even before that. Somehow I have it in my head that Terry saw Gillespie play with Lucky Millinder in the early 1940s, but I cannot remember why I think that, and there is no direct reference to any such early meeting in CeeTee’s autobiography, which I am currently reading. What is clear from the book is that, from early on in his career, CeeTee kept a close eye on the development of bebop generally and made note of trumpet playing “à la Birks” in particular. Later on, in CeeTee’s Bayside, Queens, New York days, Dizzy would sometimes join him when he made his regular visits to Louis Armstrong, who lived nearby. CeeTee played on at least twenty-three recording sessions involving Dizzy, starting with one in 1952, when Gillespie sat in with Ellington, and ending with a session in 1980 involving the Oscar Peterson Quartet, CeeTee, Dizzy, and Freddie Hubbard. Prior to 1961, Terry and Gillespie were involved together in three recording sessions with Duke Ellington (1952, 1957, 1959), one date for the Timex All Star Jazz Show (1959), and two in which CeeTee played with Dizzy’s band (1960).\n\nKen Dorham is better known as Kenny Dorham, a delicate and inventive bebop trumpeter, singer, and composer. He was a member of the original Jazz Messengers co-operative, and played later on with the likes of Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins, and Max Roach. Dorham was on Terry’s Serenade to a Bus Seat in 1957. Later, Dorham and Terry played for Gillespie at Newport in 1966, and in the 1970s Dorham helped Terry with an early jazz education project in Harlem.\n\nLockjaw Davis was Eddie “Lockjaw” Davis, tenor sax, who played with Lucky Millinder in the mid-1940s, when it had become essentially a rhythm and blues outfit, and with Basie as well. The first time that Davis and Terry recorded together was backing Dinah Washington, in 1954. Lockjaw’s early 1960s collaboration with fellow tenor Johnny Griffin is legendary. CeeTee played in two Lockjaw-led recording sessions in that period, resulting in the albums Trane Whistle (1960) and Afro-Jaws (1961). They got together several times after that as well.\n\nMiles Davis was from East Saint Louis, and was mentored by Clark Terry. They first met in 1940, when Miles (then known as Dewey) was 14, and CeeTee was all of 20. It was about five years later that he truly realized Miles’s potential, after which they formed a long and complicated friendship, which is discussed in their respective autobiographies. The details of their inter-personal relationship are quite fascinating. Davis’s account is, if anything, more revealing as to his own bad behaviour towards his friend, although Terry certainly does not shrink from revealing the gist of it. Interestingly, there is absolutely no recordings evidence that Miles and CeeTee ever played together.\n\nGeo. Divivier was George Duvivier, a beautiful bass player, who worked with a wide range of big bands and smaller outfits. He was on TV quite often, as a member of the Bobby Rosengarden Orchestra on the Dick Cavett Show. He was also on one of my favourite CeeTee LPs, It’s What’s Happenin’: The Varitone Sound of Clark Terry (1967), which includes “Electric Mumbles”, “Take the A Train”, and “Grand Canyon Suite”. Terry and Duvivier first recorded together for Mercer Ellington’s 1958 LP, Steppin’ Into Swing Society, so perhaps that is where they met. A quick look at CeeTee’s discography reveals that he and Duvivier were on well over forty recording sessions together. In the year 1960 alone, they participated together in at least six recording sessions, fronted by Mundell Lowe, Bob Wilber, Al Cohn, Sonny Truitt, Chris Connor, and Randy Weston. These all resulted in albums, one of which was released in “Music Minus One” formats as well as by the “Classic Jazz” label.\n\nEric Dolphy was an inspiring virtuoso and influential bass clarinetist/flautist/alto player who emerged in the early 1960s. I became aware of him through his 1960-’64 work with Charles Mingus. Presumably CeeTee and Dolphy met when Mingus asked Terry to participate in an early 1960 recording session. The initial meeting with Mingus did not go well, however, as CeeTee decided, given all his other commitments, including his regular gig on the Tonight Show, that he did not really have the time to decipher Mingus’s chicken scratches and deal with his paranoia. However, he did in fact end up recording the album with Mingus in May, 1960: it was released first as Pre-Bird and later as Mingus Revisited. Dolphy was also on Lockjaw Davis’s Trane Whistle album with CeeTee, recorded in September of that year.\n\nPaul Chambers was a virtuoso bass player, who worked with Miles Davis from 1955 to 1963. He is particularly renowned for his work on Kind of Blue: “So What?” you might say, and you’d be right! Chambers was a great admirer of both Charles Mingus and George Duvivier. The only reference to Chambers in CeeTee’s book has to do with a recording session with Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins, Paul Chambers, and Max Roach in 1956, with Terry joining them for two numbers. I also know that Chambers played on the aforementioned 1957 album, Serenade to a Bus Seat, the title of which had nothing to do with Rosa Parks, by the way.\n\nGil Evans was Ian Ernest Gilmore “Gil” Evans (né Green), Toronto-born, American jazz arranger, best known perhaps for his collaborations with Miles Davis. I can find no evidence of CeeTee having been involved in any recording sessions in which Evans was implicated, prior to 1961. There are, however, a number of collaborations after 1960. Of course, everyone in the business would have known who Evans was, but I would imagine Terry’s path would already have crossed Evans’s by 1960, in some way, perhaps through Miles Davis.\n\nMercer Ellington was a trumpeter, arranger, and composer, and the son of Duke Ellington. After Duke’s death in 1974, Mercer kept the band going, and eventually his own son Paul took on the job of maintaining the “ghost band”. Prior to Duke’s death, Mercer had his own band, at times. Clark Terry played on a Mercer Ellington album in 1958, and on another one released in 1959. Of course, CeeTee had been in Duke’s band from 1951 to 1959, and Mercer had been involved in it throughout that period, in one capacity (trumpeter, arranger, composer) or another (general manager and copyist). Terry also participated, many years later, in a 1986 “Duke Ellington” recording session under Mercer’s leadership.\n\nHank Edmonds very likely was Henry “Hank” Edmonds, pianist, author, transcriber of Bud Powell solos, and modern-jazz composer. One of his publications, which presented explanations of the principles of modern jazz composition and provided a collection of Edmonds compositions, was edited by Mercer Ellington.\n\nDoug Watkins refers to the “walking” bassist who, during his short life, played with Art Blakey, Charles Mingus, and Sonny Rollins. He was the brother-in-law of bass player Paul Chambers.\n\nArt Davis was a New York session musician, known for his work on bass with Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, Max Roach, and McCoy Tyner. He participated with Clark Terry in recording sessions with Gillespie, Ernestine Anderson, and John Carisi in 1960-61, and he played on a Terry album in 1962.\n\nKenny Drew was a jazz pianist. He and CeeTee had both been in a group fronted by Cecil Payne that participated in the Town Hall Jazz Festival in 1958. After having played with Johnny Griffin, John Coltrane, and Buddy Rich, Drew subsequently moved to Paris (1961) and then Copenhagen (1964). He played on over fifty albums with the great Danish bassist Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen.\n\nBobby Donaldson was a jazz drummer, and a rough contemporary of Clark Terry. He played for Count Basie at one point. He also participated with Terry and Duvivier in a May, 1960 recording session in support of vocalist Anne Williams, and an October one involving Terry and other members of Budd Johnson and his Band.\n\nRichard Davis, now a music professor and recently designated a 2014 NEA Jazz Master, is a bassist and, as I recall, an occasional and wild vocalist. In 1960, he and Clark Terry backed Sarah Vaughan in a “live in Europe” album entitled,Sarah Vaughan Accompanied By Clark Terry Quartet. They worked together after 1960 as well, including in a large band backing Ruth Brown in 1965, and Davis played with Terry in one or more sessions for each of Earl Hines, Gary McFarland, Oliver Nelson, Lalo Schifrin, and Chico Hamilton in 1966.\n\nWalter Davis was Walter Davis, jr., a hard bop pianist out of Bud Powell, who played with Art Blakey, Dizzy Gillespie, and Sonny Rollins. He and CeeTee appeared on a Donald Byrd “live in Paris” album together, Au Chat qui Pêche, 1958. This could have been when and where they met.\n\nJim Chapin (drums) was, very likely, the drummer (and father of Harry and Tom Chapin) who played with Woody Herman, Glen Gray, Tommy Dorsey, and others, and wrote books on advanced techniques for modern drummers. I have not yet found any evidence of his having collaborated with Clark Terry in any musical ventures.\n\nRolf Ericson, Swedish jazz trumpeter and flügelhornist, played in both Charlie Barnet and Woody Herman’s big bands. He joined Barnet in 1949, that is shortly after CeeTee had left Barnet for Basie in 1948, and he was also with Duke Ellington, starting four years after CeeTee had left regular employment with Ellington. Ericson and Terry were both involved with Charles Mingus’s 1962 Town Hall Concert, and they were both in the trumpet section for Listen to Art Farmer and several other Farmer sessions in 1962, but I have not yet found anything about their having collaborated prior to that.\n\nPanama Francis refers to David Albert “Panama” Francis, a drummer for Lucky Millinder from 1940-46, and with Duke Ellington in 1952, that is while CeeTee was with Ellington. In 1958, he and Terry participated in a Cat Anderson recording session (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof). In 1960 he, Duvivier, Terry, and Dick Wellstood recorded a quintet album under Bob Wilber’s leadership that was released as Evolution of the Blues, with both Wilber and Terry’s parts removed (but notated) for the “Music Minus One” variant releases of the album.\n\nWillie Dennis was a trombonist whom Terry mentions in his autobiography as having played on commercial dates with him in the 1960s. CeeTee’s discography reveals that they indeed played together a fair number of times, particularly in the early 1960s, for people like Gary McFarland, Gerry Mulligan, Oliver Nelson, and Benny Goodman. CeeTee and Willie’s first gigs together were with the Mundell Lowe All Stars in June, 1960.\n\nGeorge Dorsey was a saxophonist who had played with Basie for a time in the mid-1940s, before Terry joined Basie in 1948. He was also mentioned by Terry as having been involved in commercial work with him in the 1960s. CeeTee’s discography actually reveals twelve recording sessions between 1960 and 1963 in which both Terry and Dorsey participated. The ones from 1960 were the Anne Williams session mentioned earlier in connection with Bobby Donaldson, and two sessions held in late December that led to the highly successful Ray Charles Genius + Soul = Jazz LP.\n\nSarah Cassey doubtless refers to Sara Cassey. She is indicated in various sources as the composer of “Warm Blue Stream”, “Windflower”, and “Very Near Blue”, for example. The latter was included in a 1958 album entitled Clark Terry Quartet with Thelonious Monk.\n\nDoug Braye was Doug Bray, an industrial psychologist and “inventor of the modern day assessment center”. Bray was the founder of the NYC-based Duke Ellington Society, originally called the Duke Ellington Jazz Society, founded in 1959 and “devoted to promoting the appreciation of all aspects of things Ellingtonia”.\n\nTom Detienne was the 1st Vice-President of the Duke Ellington Society. CeeTee was actively involved in the Society, and it would seem served as the motor force among Duke’s continuing players and alumni in organizing the annual concerts that came to be presented through this organization.\n\nDom Cerulli was the East Coast editor of Downbeat, and author of many sets of liner notes and several books. He worked for a number of record companies, and closely collaborated in particular with John Hammond at Columbia.\n\nDownbeat has been “the book of record for the jazz world” since 1934. CeeTee and valve trombonist Bob Brookmeyer won the Downbeat Jazz Critics award together in 1963, and CeeTee was admitted into the Downbeat Hall of Fame in 2000.\n\nJoe Diskint is alluded to in CeeTee’s autobiography as someone to whose daughter’s wedding he was invited at one point. Otherwise there is no information available on the nature of their connection.\n\nI rather doubt that Bill Dubois was W.E.B. DuBois, author of both The Souls of Black Folk and Black Reconstruction in America, and co-founder of the NAACP, although he was still alive, in his 90s, in 1960.\n\nCORE is the Congress for Racial Equality, for which organization Clark Terry played at fundraising benefits, for example at Jackie Robinson’s house in Connecticutt.\n\nDaryl Bolden/NAACP refers to an official of the National Association for Colored People, for which organization CeeTee also did benefits.\n\nAny hopes of discovering that the McDonalds Dining Room was a significant 1950s/60s musicians’ hangout somewhere in Manhattan, probably near the Half Note on Hudson, were dashed by my finding virtually nothing but references to the hamburger chain on Google. Mind you, there is one such McDonald’s situated on the 14th Street side of the famous artists’ building on East 13th Street in Greenwich Village. However, I don’t recall there having been a McDonald’s there in the late 1960s, and, in any case, I somehow doubt that CeeTee would have had any reason to have its phone number in his date book.\n\nI found nothing definitive or even suggestive on the names Johnny Culp, Phil Edmund, Billy Frazier, Val Irving, Cheaten(?) L. Duval , Joe Drak?es, Willie Degus, ___ Belock , ___ Dotson, Eli ___, or Ernest ___.\n\nEisen and Eisen might have been a legal or accounting firm, or a booking agency, or, who knows, an obscure comedy or dance duo.\n\nPerhaps after I have had a chance to read CeeTee’s book properly and completely I will know more about his relationship with some of these individuals. There is also the possibility that someone reading this blog will be able to provide us with some clarification.\n\nThis was certainly an absorbing and interesting exercise, but it pales in comparison to listening to Clark Terry. I recommend it highly.\n\nBerkeley Fleming\n\nSackville, N.B."
