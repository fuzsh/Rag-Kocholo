He has also received numerous awards from Jazz Times and the Jazz Journalists Association for Tenor Saxophone, Album of the Year and Musician of the Year.\n\nBorn in Cleveland, Ohio on December 29, 1952 he attended the famed Berklee College of Music in Boston where years later he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate. Since 2001 he has held the Gary Burton Chair in Jazz Performance and is a founding faculty member since 2009 of the Global Jazz Institute at Berklee directed by Danilo Pérez. He is a guest lecturer at New York University’s Jazz Program, Juilliard and Manhattan School of Music as well as Clinician at Universities around the globe.\n\nFrom 1991 through 2016, Lovano released an unprecedented 25 records as a leader for the historic Blue Note Records. Joe Lovano Quartet: Classic! Live at Newport featuring Hank Jones was recorded in 2005 and released in 2016 to critical acclaim. In 2019, Lovano released his debut album as a bandleader on ECM Records, Trio Tapestry, with Marilyn Crispell and Carmen Castaldi. Over the next few years, Lovano saw the release of three additional ECM Records albums: ROMA, a collaboration with Enrico Rava; Arctic Riff, a special guest appearance with the Marcin Wasilewski Trio; and the sophomore release from Lovano’s Trio Tapestry, Garden Of Expression.

Three years is a long time, but Kandace is convinced that her fans will feel the wait was worth it. “In a way, this album took a whole lifetime to make,” she says, “and I think it shows.”\n\nCLAUDIA MEDINA’S PERUVIAN PROJECT\n\nFriday, June 21st – 4:00pm – Mears Park\n\nClaudia Medina, a Los Angeles-based saxophonist, multi-instrumentalist, composer, music producer & educator, is committed to playing and never giving up.

Hard Bop’s intricate structures\n\nmake it challenging to master, yet incredibly rewarding for both the\n\nmusicians and their audience.\n\nLive music is often used as background to other activities such as\n\ndining, so Hard Bop is rarely performed outside late-night niche clubs\n\nthat require a cover charge. Recognizing the need to widen its impact\n\nto a broader audience, Jesse Simon, a Twin Cities professional drummer\n\nwith a performance degree from The Manhattan School Of Music (’99),\n\nestablished the Minnesota Hard Bop Collective (MNHBC) in 2016. His\n\nvision was to create a platform for a new generation of musicians and\n\nlisteners to experience Hard Bop without the barrier of cover charges.\n\nThis initiative led to the MNHBC being awarded the recognition of\n\nnon-profit IRS tax exemption in 2021, and by 2022, it had begun\n\nfundraising efforts to extend its educational outreach to high school\n\nband rooms. Starting in 2023 the MNHBC began their weekly Sit-In\n\nSeries (www.sitinseries.org) at MetroNOME Brewing Co.\n\n(Metro-N=Nourishing O=Outstanding M=Music E=Education).\n\nUnlike a jam session, the Sit-In Series provides music students an\n\nopportunity to spontaneously perform with a professional ensemble as\n\nan invaluable chance to learn the lessons of auditioning, networking,\n\nand observing the unwritten rules of a professional performance stage,\n\nwhile bridging a generational gap that is often overlooked in the\n\nmusical community. Every accomplished musician cherishes the memory of\n\ntheir first sit-in—it’s an experience that can open doors or teach\n\nhard lessons. It is an essential skill for anyone pursuing any\n\nprofessional career, all under the energetic embrace of Hard Bop.\n\nNumber of student players and instrumentation:\n\nProfessionals:\n\nTBD – Piano 6/21\n\nDale Alexander – Piano 6/22\n\nTom Lewis – Bass 6/21\n\nTed Olsen – Bass 6/22\n\nJesse Simon – Drums\n\nMentees:\n\nIntern: Bernadette Brownrigg Spray – Vocals (Augsburg Graduate)\n\nApprentice: Luca Cavalletti – Alto Saxophone (Southwest HS)\n\n2023/2024 High School Sit In Mentees … and anyone who wants to stick\n\naround from the day’s previous performances.\n\nFriday, June 21st and Saturday, June 22nd – Walker West Music Academy Youth Stage at Saint City (formerly Creator’s Cup) – 5PM\n\nMINNESOTA YOUTH JAZZ BANDS\n\nMinnesota Youth Jazz Bands, now in its 20th season, enjoys three dynamic High School Ensembles, two Middle School Ensembles and one Super Sax Ensemble.
