        "text": "I agree completely about the two labels reflecting the personal preferences of their founders. They had two different approaches with BN mixing and matching both new and established musicians in different combinations with sometimes amazing results. One of the differences was BN started in the late 30's when Jazz was the poplar music and they could be a little more experimental. Pablo came at a time where Jazz was much less popular and had a much smaller market. The titles had make a profit since they were now competing with other more popular genres. Granz used establish band leaders or singers fronting working bands. These artist had a name and had established themselves many decades earlier. They were a known quantity and had an established base of fans.\n\nWhen CDs arrived on the scene in the mid 80's they were very scarce for the first few years. I remember going into stores and choosing between the same 100-200 CDs in each store. At first there were far more Jazz and Classical titles than there were rock. I began buying both Classical and Jazz CDs to have something to play. I didn't think I liked Jazz after about 1945. I'd heard some early after-hours sessions at Minton's that were very raw and crude sounding Bee Bop. These sessions were very rough and unmusical sounding to my ears. Like several people playing different songs, very fast all at the same time. As a result I tended to stick to 1925-1945. I also discovered Count Basie and Duke Ellington, Billie Holliday and Ella Fitzgerald. Even though the new big band CDs were supposed to be remastered for CD for the best sound, they still only hinted at the great sound hidden within. I always wanted to hear what a top swing era big band really sounded like at their peak. There were some recordings from the early 1950's that gave a hints of this. They were reunions of classic big bands 10 years later and these came the closest, but they were few in number. There were also many tributes to the swing era by a leader fronting a band of talented jazz musicians. The problem was they were not a working band and this style was less familiar to them. There were little enhancements, fills and such that the brass or the woodwind sections would play in unison while not breaking a sweat. These same things seemed almost painful when played more slowly by these more modern musician. It just wasn't a regular part of their daily routine and it was more work for them and it showed.\n\nWhen I got back to records in 2018 I made many discoveries. The first was there were lots of good big bands jazz titles from 1949 to the mid 50's where it was original musicians from the big band era who could still bring it. Many of these LPs never made it to CD. Duke Ellington and Count Basie continued to make music throughout this period. So some great LPs from the 50's and early 60's were there to be had. Both of these leaders continued playing into the 1970's and this is where Pablo came in. Granz took big names whom the big labels no longer had any interest in, and made many albums with them. They were working bands and this allowed him to record them quickly. This filled my desire to hear big band music recorded on modern equipment by folks who knew the material and played it well. As I said in my first post in this thread: In the 70's I mistakenly thought these were past-their-prime-has beens recording on a budget label. These LPs were often highly discounted when CDs arrived on the scene, which only reinforced my thinking. I used to see them featured as new releases as I passed through the Jazz department. I only wish now that I had stopped and picked these LPs up new.\n\nAs for Blue Note I was curious about them when I started buying LPs again, but I didn't think I liked modern jazz. To me this meant almost anything from Bee Bop and beyond. BN always had a reputation for having amazing sound. I bought some late 50's early 60's BN titles both used and from the 80's series and then the Tone Poets, It turns out I loved them and I couldn't understand why. Discogs often listed the as Post-Bop and I knew I hated Bee Bop, didn't I? Had Post-Bop changed that much? I bought more and more BN records. What I loved about many of these session is they were a bit like a baseball game where it was an all star game every time, not once a season. These folks could play with anyone it seemed. If you found someone you liked, they appeared on many other sessions with the same or a totally new cast of characters.\n\nSo it is good that these two labels reflected the preferences of their founders-we get a diversity of choice. As a post script: This year I bit the bullet and bought a Charlie Parker - Bird Of Paradise (Best Of The Dial Masters) and found I loved Charlie Parker. The two CDs with early jams from Minton's were an exception to the rule, not the rule. Sadly I gave up looking after these two CDs. I am making up for 30 years of lost time and correcting that error now."
