Without saying a word to Blanton, Ellington began to improvise and modulate through different keys. Blanton didn’t miss a note, and when the two were done Marable–who had served as musical father to Louis Armstrong, among other jazz notables–said of the 18-year-old “How do you like my bass player?” To which Ellington replied “He’s my bass player now.”\n\nRef: This One’s for Blanton\n\nJazz Innovator\n\nClearly, Jimmy Blanton’s innovative approach to the double bass helped shape the course of jazz history.\n\nInnovator that he was, Blanton’s playing style was characterized by his use of arco (bowing) techniques, which added a new level of expressiveness to the instrument.
