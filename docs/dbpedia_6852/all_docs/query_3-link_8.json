        "text": "My first exposure to Oscar Peterson was in Sacramento at a concert called Jazz at the Philharmonic. It was a series of concerts and recordings produced by Norman Granz over a period from 1945 to 1983 featuring such jazz giants as Louie Bellson, Ray Brown, Benny Carter, Roy Eldridge, Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dizzy Gillespie, Illinois Jacquet, Gene Krupa, Charlie Parker, Oscar Peterson, Barney Kessel, Lionel Hampton, Billie Holiday, Lester Young and a few others, including the great Nat King Cole.\n\nI was blown away with his technique, playing complicated improvised runs at the speed of sound, and having fun doing it â€” singing along, now and then laughing, and generally just enjoying the music almost as much as those of us in the audience."
