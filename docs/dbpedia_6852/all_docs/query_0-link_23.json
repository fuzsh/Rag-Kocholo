He also played in other Danish venues with Bud Powell, Count Basie, Roy Eldridge, Dizzy Gillespie, Jackie McLean, and Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nCelebrated Danish jazz bassist Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen formed his first group, “Jazzkvintet 60,” during his early teens in 1960 and had his debut performance at Jazzhus Montmartre in Copenhagen on New Year’s Eve 1961.\n\nNiels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen was well-known for his jazz arrangements of traditional Danish folk songs and was awarded the Nordic Council Music Prize in 1991.\n\nAmong his best-known original songs are “Jaywalkin’,” “My Little Anna,” and “The Puzzle.”\n\nNiels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen performs a Danish folksong accompanied by Kenny Drew in 1973.\n\nPersonnel:"
