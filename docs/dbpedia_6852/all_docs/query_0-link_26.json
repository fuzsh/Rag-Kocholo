        "text": "Cats have nine lives, but Ryan Calloway is living several, vividly, all at once, without strain. I first encountered him in person four years ago, but in that time I have found so much to admire in the ease with which he balances his several selves, generously offering us surprising beauty in each one.\n\nI have never been able to swing dance, which has only intensified my fascination with those who can. Lindy Hop remains a particular favorite, and I have watched many live and video-ed displays of that graceful athletic art. Some dancers I know and admire have partnered with Ryan at Lindy Hop championships, and here are examples of his audacious skills as well as theirs. Exhibits one and two, if it please the court:\n\nand . . . .\n\nI will never shimmy like my sister Kate, but I would love to move with one-tenth of that grace and power. Ah well. And in case the dates on those videos suggest that swing dance is no longer his forte, he dazzled on the floor when he stopped by at the March 2024 Jazz Bash by the Bay in Monterey.\n\nI didn’t encounter Ryan as a deep Albert-system clarinetist until 2020, but he impressed me strongly:\n\nLast October, at the Redwood Coast Music Festival, I recorded a performance of MY GAL SAL, featuring Ryan with Clint’s New Orleans Jazz Band, which shows off his many arts so nicely: the ensemble clarinetist, the engaging singer, the adept soloist, all in one person.\n\nI’ve been admiring his paintings and drawings as well. Skill, passion, and that same audacity. You can see much more at his website.\n\nHere’s Charles Ellsworth Russell, a recent evocation:\n\nWilliam Basie, of Red Bank, New Jersey:\n\nHere’s his “Prof. Harkin 3-D prototype”: details here:\n\nThe King of the Savoy, William Henry Webb:\n\nand the King of the dance floor, Frankie Manning, on a hoodie that can be purchased here.\n\nI follow Ryan on Facebook and https://www.instagram.com/ryancallowayart/ , so I see him making art in fascinating video presentations. And more of his gorgeously quirky art — morphed into t-shirts and stickers — can be found here.\n\nBut let us loop back to the vital heartfelt music Ryan has recorded with the Silver Bell Jazz Band, still gigging and having fun.\n\nHere’s the title track from CALL OF THE FREAKS — which so nicely evokes the weird side of the Luis Russell Orchestra, with the appropriate glee-club tribute to your local sanitation department.\n\nAnd a frolicome SNAKE RAG, music for happy dancers born well after 1923.\n\nWhatever Ryan turns his hand to comes out with feeling, personality, and depth. His spirit is surprising and expansive.\n\nI can’t wait to see what he does next!\n\nMay your happiness increase!\n\nWith a few exceptions, most “films about jazz” make me crabby and restless. (Some of the notable exceptions are the Bill Crow and Jimmy Wormworth documentaries by Neal Miner, LOUIS ARMSTRONG’S BLACK AND BLUES, ALMA’S JAZZY MARRIAGE . . . and I am sure there are worthy ones I haven’t seen.) They are inaccurate or tone-deaf, melodramatic or dominated by talking heads where the music should be.\n\nBut this new one is a delight.\n\nThe new documentary about Eddie Durham, his music, his world, his family, is a spectacular rebuke to those flawed creations. It’s compact and focused; it offers new information, new sounds, and new stories. I think I saw and heard Eddie once in New York City; the OAO and I left the screening feeling as if we knew the man. And liked him, which means a great deal.\n\nThe film draws on pertinent recordings, conversations with family members, and musicians who knew and worked with him — Loren Schoenberg, Chris Flory, and James Chirillo — and also gives us the gift of a previously undocumented Durham arrangement of I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW played with style and dash by the Juilliard Jazz Orchestra, conducted by Mr. Schoenberg. And when you look at the players in that Orchestra, no one’s thinking about Medicare. Truly inspiring.\n\nHere’s a one-minute taste:\n\nLet’s assume the name Eddie Durham is unfamiliar to you: possible, given the machinery that makes some musicians Stars and others, even more gifted, not so. But you’ve heard of the electric guitar, right? Listen to this:\n\nThat electric guitar, swinging, resonant, and original: that’s Eddie.\n\nYou’ve heard of Count Basie? Here’s Eddie’s composition and arrangement, TOPSY:\n\nHow about Jimmie Lunceford, Glenn Miller, Bennie Moten, the International Sweethearts of Rhythm? They all are seriously indebted to Eddie: composition, arrangements, leading, making the Kansas City groove an integral part of the Swing Era and beyond.\n\nThe film also celebrates a good father, caring husband, fine colleague. Modest, inventive, perceptive, a problem-solver who didn’t demand credit for everything he made better.\n\nInterested in seeing this beautifully-done documentary? Nothing simpler. Free.\n\n“WVIA and Chiaroscuro Records have announced the premiere of a new original documentary titled WHAM Re-Bop-Boom-Bam: The Swing Jazz of Eddie Durham, which will be made available to public television stations nationwide on February 1st, distributed through American Public Television (APT). The film will be broadcast on over 250 APT member stations nationwide.”\n\nAnd, before you start looking on your phone to find your local American Public Television station, let us all bask in the generosity of the people who made this film, Eddie’s children and friends, the musicians who want his innovative work to be known. Click HERE and settle back to be entertained, enlightened, and educated in the most rewarding ways.\n\nAnd then, you can look around for more of Eddie’s music, for it’s available and alive; also, if your temperament leads you this way, you can share the experience, as in, “Have you ever heard of Eddie Durham? No? He was a pioneer, a real trail-blazer in music. And a good person. You can watch a great film about him for free.”\n\nI promise you a most rewarding hour with a fast-moving, lively, colorful film.\n\nMay your happiness increase!\n\nI don’t have the wall space for all these holy relics, but the word “breath-taking” is for once accurate to describe my reaction when I saw this collection on eBay.\n\nI have to explain, however, that the bidding closed yesterday; these actual 78s have been sold. However, I thought the images were priceless, so I saved them for the JAZZ LIVES audience. That way, should you desire it, you can have a photograph made of any or all of the labels, or use the image to decorate a coffee mug, a t-shirt, or what have you. The world of products is wide beyond belief. I write this note because someone asked, “Where can I find these records on eBay?” and I had to respond that they were no longer for sale.\n\nNow, back to our regularly scheduled program.\n\nThe seller’s description is candid and funny:\n\nI AM CURRENTLY LISTING THIS 1ST GROUP OF A LARGE COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL 1930s-40s AUTOGRAPHED 78 RECORDS. THEY’RE FRESH OUT OF AN ESTATE. THEY ALL CAME FROM THE SAME COLLECTION. PLEASE SEE THE REST OF MY CURRENT LISTINGS FOR THE OTHER RECORDS IN THIS GROUP.\n\nTHE RECORDS ARE ALL ORIGINAL & IN THE ORIGINAL PERIOD THICK PAPER SLEEVES THEY WERE FOUND STORE IN. THE RECORDS ARE NOT CRACKED, CHIPPED, WARPED UP, MELTED, BROKEN, REPAIRED, POLISHED UP, CLEANED, MODIFIED OR REPAIRED. PLEASE NOTE: THE GROOVES ALL STILL HAVE A NICE SHINY SHEEN, BUT I HAVE NO WAY TO PLAY THE RECORDS TO SEE IF ANYTHING SKIPS. (I CANNOT OFFER A RETURN IN REFERENCE TO A RECORD SKIPPING.)\n\nI ASSURE ALL BIDDERS THAT YOU’RE VIEWING AUTHENTIC ORIGINAL PERIOD HAND SIGNED AUTOGRAPHS. MOST ARE IN WHITE INK. THE SIGNATURES ARE NOT PRINTS, AUTO-PEN, FACSIMILE, ETC… THER’YE 100% REAL. I HOPE THESE RECORDS GO TO A GOOD COLLECTION. THEY’RE BEING OFFERED DIRECTLY FROM AN ESTATE & AS PICTURED HERE.\n\nPLEASE TAKE NOTE: THESE ARE PRIMITIVE BRITTLE OLD SHELLAC RESIN 78RPM RECORDS. THEY WILL CRACK EASILY. DUE TO VALUE & EXTREME FRAGILITY, I CANNOT OFFER COMBINED SHIPPING FOR THIS ITEM. EACH RECORD WILL BE SHIPPED IN IT’S OWN SEPARATE BOX FOR SAFETY IN TRANSIT.\n\nI don’t know anything more than that, but the collection includes records made c. 1938-1947. They also look well-played, which touches me: whoever chased after the musicians, white pen at the ready, valued the music in the grooves as much as the signatures. They came from an estate in the Georgetown area of Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd, as I have said at length elsewhere, getting an autograph requires that one’s idol share a moment, a few words, eye contact, perhaps even a smile. One is in the presence of Greatness, and one has an invaluable souvenir to prove that the encounter happened.\n\nInto the present — selling these now is, to me, more commendable than locking them away in a glass-fronted cabinet with its own alarm system with only one person allowed to admire them. Spread the joys!\n\nSo, without further ado, as they say —\n\nEDDIE and FATS:\n\nCOOTIE on Capitol:\n\nWell, HI-DE-HO to you, too!\n\nThe very dear Mr. Butterfield:\n\nBig Tea:\n\nThe one, the only Rabbit:\n\nChicago’s ART:\n\nMiss Ethel Waters!:\n\nLittle Jazz:\n\nThe HAMP:\n\nHarry CARNEY:\n\na double-header or a trifecta, with JIMMY JONES and LAWRENCE BROWN:\n\nfrom Freeport, New York, MIFF:\n\nThe Holy Main:\n\nFatha!\n\nand Mr. B.:\n\nPeggy:\n\nBenny, in part:\n\nand he’s in the groove:\n\nElla:\n\nWas there anyone finer?:\n\nArtie:\n\nThe one, the only:\n\nGene:\n\nStuff:\n\nMr. Berry, himself:\n\nLouis Jordan:\n\nMister Hackett, very jovial:\n\nThere were others, but that’s a satisfying supply of marvels for now.\n\nMay your happiness increase!\n\nIt isn’t heralded with drums, parades, fireworks, and headlines, but sometimes the miraculous happens. Musically, I mean.\n\nIt did two Sundays ago, May 7, 2023, at The Ear Inn (326 Spring Street, Soho, New York) when a singular version of the EarRegulars assembled in the corner that has been their stage and pulpit for about sixteen years now.\n\nThey were Danny Tobias, trumpet and Eb alto horn; Dan Block, clarinet and tenor saxophone; James Chirillo, guitar; Rob Adkins, string bass. And here’s an example of their gliding lyrical mastery: the Count Basie-associated pop tune, I’LL ALWAYS BE IN LOVE WITH YOU, written in 1929 (Bud Green, Sam H. Stept, and Herman Ruby). Did the Basie musicians play and sing it in Kansas City then? I can’t say, but it certainly enjoyed a renaissance in 1936 . . . and in 2023.\n\nBut let us consider the source material, a very pretty waltz:\n\nIt came from a pioineering sound film, with an enticing one-word title:\n\nso I assume that musicians as well as civilians went to see the film and had the song in their minds. But when Count Basie picked it up again, perhaps seven years later, it was not to be a waltz, but a swing number for the dancers. And the Basie way — sly, understated joy through swing — lives on here:\n\nBut “the Basie way” is a beautiful paradox: taking life and art with the greatest seriousness while refusing to be perceived as doing so. Literary people will recognize Castiglione’s sprezzatura, or nonchalance . . . grooving without sweating over it, making the most difficult work appear easy. Messrs. Tobias, Block, Chirillo, and Adkins know how in their cells, and show it here. Bless them as they bless us.\n\nMore to come. And you’ve never been to the Ear Inn on a Sunday night?\n\nP.S. as of today, May 25, I am still exiled from Facebook, thanks to a hacker. So please share this with people who will get its spirit. Thank you.\n\nMay your happiness increase!\n\nEven as jazz as an art form prides itself on “moving forward,” it’s always been affectionately retrospective, cherishing the deep past and the recent past in performance and recordings. Think of Louis bringing his mentor’s DIPPER MOUTH BLUES to the Henderson band, even though Joe Oliver was probably continuing to play it; Bix and Tram recording the ODJB’s OSTRICH WALK; Bird playing Lester’s solo on SHOE SHINE BOY. (I am indebted to Matthew Rivera for reminding me of this idea through his radio broadcast on WKCR.)\n\nOne of the most rewarding institutions to come out of jazz’s desire to both honor the past as itself and to make it new was the New York Jazz Repertory Company. Not only did the NYJRC perform at the Newport in New York jazz festival, it brought its “shows” worldwide, most often under the leadership of the brilliant Dick Hyman. I saw Louis and Bix tributes in the early Seventies, and they were electrifying; even better, the NYJRC idea was a staple of the Nice Jazz Festival, and some of the concert performances were broadcast on French television. (I’ve posted a ninety-minute tribute to Benny Goodman recently here.\n\nTrotting through YouTube last night — the cyber-equivalent of my getting on my bicycle when I was thirteen and riding to the public library — I found two half-hour NYJRC delights, posted by others in 2015, that I hadn’t seen before. I predict that you will enjoy them also. The first is a Basie tribute, from July 12, 1978; the second, Duke, July 17, 1977.\n\nThose expecting note-for-note recreations of recordings will be, I think, pleasantly surprised by the openness of the arrangements and the leeway given the “contemporary” soloists to play their personalities. Everything is reasonably idiomatic but there are delightful shocks here and there.\n\nThe “Basie band” here is Sweets Edison, Cat Anderson, Jimmie Maxwell, Joe Newman, trumpet; Benny Powell, Dicky Wells, John Gordon, trombone; Paul Bascomb, Paul Moen, Bob Wilber, Pepper Adams, Earle Warren, reeds; Dick Hyman, piano; Bucky Pizzarelli, guitar; Chubby Jackson, string bass; Bobby Rosengarden, drums. I count at least six venerated Basie alumni.\n\nJUMPIN’ AT THE WOODSIDE (Paul Bascomb, Harry Edison, Benny Powell, Bob Wilber, Dick Hyman) / ONE O’CLOCK JUMP (Hyman, Paul Moen, Dicky Wells, Bascomb, Joe Newman, Hyman) / ROCK-A-BYE BASIE (Wilber, Moen, Sweets, Hyman and Chubby Jackson) / HARVARD BLUES (Bascomb, Newman, vocal) / BROADWAY (Wilber, Sweets, Hyman, Wilber, Bascomb, Pepper Adams, Powell, John Gordon, Earle Warren, Cat Anderson, Moen):\n\nand “the Ellington band,” made up of many of the same champions, Hyman, Rosengarden, Wilber, Pepper Adams, Maxwell — with Jon Faddis, Pee Wee Erwin, Joe Newman, trumpets; Eddie Daniels, Zoot Sims, Billy Mitchell, reeds; George Duvivier, string bass, John Mosca, Billy Campbell, Earl McIntyre, trombone:\n\nEAST ST. LOUIS-TOODLE OO (Wilber, Pepper, Daniels, Erwin) / DOUBLE CHECK STOMP (Maxwell, Wilber, Billy Campbell) / JUNGLE NIGHTS IN HARLEM (possibly John Mosca, Maxwell, Daniels) / DOCTOR E.K.E. (composition by Raymond Fol, piano; Mosca, Mitchell, Faddis, Sam Woodyard, drums) / HARLEM AIR-SHAFT (McIntyre, Faddis, Daniels, Joe Newman) / BLUE GOOSE (Wilber, Maxwell, Zoot, Mosca, Wilber) / JUMPIN’ PUNKINS (Duvivier, Pepper, Rosengarden, Hyman, Rosengarden) / CHELSEA BRIDGE (Hyman, Zoot, Hyman, McIntyre):\n\nHonoring the originals and their creators but giving plenty of space to honor the present — a lovely balance. And if you’d rather hear the Basie Deccas and Ellington Victors, they will still be there, undamaged and pristine.\n\nMay your happiness increase!\n\nLESTER’S BLUES is a septet (often with guests) based in Gent, Belgium, and they swing like mad.\n\nIn instrumentation, they resemble the Reno Club band and they have much of the same free-wheeling joyous spirit. Basie always started with the saxophone section, so I will also: Tom Callens, tenor, alto, vocal; David Lukacs, clarinet, tenor; Hans Bossuyt, trumpet; Luk Vermeir, piano; Victor Da Costa, guitar; Sam Gersmans, string bass; Frederik Van den Berghe, drums; guests Dree Peremans, trombone; Monique ‘Mo’ Harcum, vocal.\n\nI found their first album so delightful that I did everything but hug the disc. I distrust hyperbole, but called it “a triumph” here. Visit that post, by the way, and you can savor some delightful video evidence. Just be sure that the Depression glass is not too close to the edge of the shelf, because your castle will be rocking.\n\nOne of the pleasures of this band is that their repertoire is intelligently spacious. “Basie tributes” often fall back on familiar lines on I GOT RHYTHM, HONEYSUCKLE ROSE, the blues, and a few ballads . . . but JUMPIN’ AT THE WOODSIDE has been picked clean, and many forget that the Basie band was also playing IF I DIDN’T CARE, THE YOU AND ME THAT USED TO BE, and originals like TAXI WAR DANCE, inspirations that LESTER’S BLUES follows. They remember that Lester loved the music he heard on the radio.\n\nEnough with the words, as they say. Some music!\n\nThinking about the blues idiom and Bessie — in a performance that, to me, imagines a Basie-Bessie performance at Carnegie Hall in 1938 (think FROM SPIRITUALS TO SWING). Totally evocative without raising its voice:\n\nand the expertly frolicsome GEORGIA JUBILEE, credited to Arthur Schutt and a young man from Chicago named Benny:\n\nSeveral things leap out at me: not only the immense subtlety of the soloists, but the wonderful mix of exactitude and freedom in the ensembles. And the sound! Delicious and warm, never clinical.\n\nIn addition to these two performances, the new disc, RADIO RHYTHM, offers LITTLE WHITE LIES, WHEN THE SUN SETS DOWN SOUTH, MOTEN’S SWING, ROLL ‘EM, CLIMAX RAG, I LEFT MY BABY, THAT’S ALL, and the title tune for a total of ten performances both leisurely and compact. The band is comfortably “modern,” in its grooving, but no one needs six choruses to get rolling. Readers with memories will notice associations with Jelly Roll and Mary Lou, Smack, Bechet, and Mister Five by Five in addition to Basie and Lester in a variety of periods.\n\nAnd what this recording and this band remind me, with gentleness and integrity, is that classic jazz is an unbroken continuum over the last century-plus, with our heroes in contemporary times offering love to the past, while the past says, “Go on and be yourselves! We did it, and that’s why you admire us so.”\n\nI offer as testimony to the greatness of this orchestra and of this session my chunk of enthusiastic prose — but don’t quail, it’s only a little more than six hundred words. Or you can skip to the end and purchase the music.\n\nThere are two ways to approach the Past. One is to handle it tenderly as fragile relic, ready to dissolve into dust. Thus, bands play CHANT OF THE WEED from manuscript paper, aiming to sound like a 1933 Don Redman 78 rpm record. Expertly done, it sends shivers down the spine. But for others it is like a parlor trick, an impressionist pretending to be someone else. The other approach acknowledges that our heroes were innovative, horrified at the idea of being “a repeater pencil.” LESTER’S BLUES knows the originals by heart and has taken them to heart, but they are a band with spice. They have a glorious wildness at their center of their deep love of classic jazz. They are respectful of the original arrangements – they do not destroy the cathedral to put up a shopping mall — but within the arrangements they go their own idiosyncratic joyous ways. They create devoted homages to the recorded past, but those prayers to Bluebird Records and the Famous Door are springboards for creativity, not ankle bracelets to keep living artists restricted to older conventions. And what I hear is exultant, even when melancholy and slow.\n\nThe musicians have a common love of swing. Sadly, many contemporary players and singers keep “the pocket” or “the groove” at arm’s length, as if swing is Grandpa’s pocket watch and fob in the era of the iPhone. How sad. On the rock of this rhythm section this band could build a new swinging city on a hill. And the soloists! Bless them for their strong personalities, rooted yet playful, and celebrate them for how well they meld into vivid unity. And bless the light-hearted and sublimely effective arrangements, at once roadmaps and wind in the trees.\n\nEach performance has its own singularity. I won’t praise the soloists, nor will I anatomize each performance or tell the history of each song – that’s your delightful homework – but these ten performances fill the room with light and joy. And more: each track is at once music and beyond music: one is a Turner landscape, another a Jacob Lawrence, a Calder, a Kandinsky.\n\nNone of this is by accident. Tom Callens told me, “We have a total of ten tracks which were chosen out of a bigger pool of songs. We chose these for their freshness, special arrangements, strong melodies, less popularly known (except ‘Nobody Knows You When You’re Down & Out’ of course), or just because we have an emotional attachment to them. That’s why it’s not a concept or tribute album. It’s just us trying to play really well, having a new repertoire, a cohesive and rhythmic sound, and enjoying the ride. We recorded at the same place as earlier and this time did it using one stereo ribbon mic (in blumlein configuration), positioning ourselves around it and adjusting our positions to mix the individual volume levels. The L-R signal was fed through a state of the art dual tube microphone preamp and sent straight to two-track tape. Tracks were recorded in one go (one-takes) so there’s no editing involved.”\n\nJust like the old days, but brand-new. Passion and exactitude; personal freedom within defined frameworks, power and airy lightness (like Jimmy Rushing on the dance floor). And it all fuses in the nicest communal way. LESTER’S BLUES feels like “a band,” spiritually: a happy group united for a communal purpose. I imagine them getting together for a celebratory meal after the session, laughing and enjoying what they have created. I am sure that Pres, Basie, Jo, Benny, Bessie, Jelly Roll, Mister Five by Five, and Charlie (Christian and Parker) are grinning their faces off. You will be, too.\n\nYes, music for dancers, but also music for people who pat their foot and grin while seated in front of their computer and speakers. Music for people who understand joy, recognize it, and avidly choose it.\n\nYou can find both their albums (or downloads) here.\n\nMay your happiness increase!\n\nIf you already know Percy France, don’t spend another moment reading what I’ve written. Go immediately to www.percyfrance.info — where you can hear him play, read about him (tributes by people who loved him), and learn more.\n\nBut if he’s only a name to you . . .\n\nPerhaps because it is often mistaken for simple entertainment, jazz is oddly distinguished from other art forms by a powerful Star System. There is too much of “the greatest of all time,” which negates the broader accomplishments of many beautiful artists. But those who listen deeply know that alongside — not behind — Louis, there are Ray Nance and Bill Coleman; alongside Art Tatum there are Ellis Larkins and Jimmie Rowles, and so on, creative men and women ignored in the speeding-train chronicles of Important Artists.\n\nWith that in mind, and the joy of discovering someone “new,” here is tenor saxophonist Percy France. He may be little-known or even unknown to many. I did hear him on the radio (broadcasts by WKCR-FM, Columbia University’s station, from the West End Cafe in New York, presided over by Phil Schaap), but I never saw him in person.\n\nBut before you assume that Percy’s semi-obscurity is the result of a diluted talent, let me point out that this summer when Sonny Rollins was asked about him, his response was as enthusiastic as it could be. The excerpt that caught my eye is simple: I never could beat him. We were good friends, and I think of him as my brother.\n\nLet that sink in.\n\nAnd since you might be saying, “All right . . . praised by Sonny. What did he sound like?” here are three samples, thanks to Daniel Gould, about whom I will have more to say.\n\nHere’s Percy, fluid, melodic, cheerfully making the over-familiar come alive:\n\nand a different kind of groove, quietly lyrical:\n\nFrance plays Fats, light-hearted and witty:\n\nI admire honest deep research unashamedly, since often what’s passed off as information is made of cardboard. So I present to you Daniel Gould’s wonderful Percy France site — solid and ever-growing — his energetic tribute to a musician who should be cherished as more than a name in a discography: www.percyfrance.info will take you there.\n\nDaniel has done and continues to do the great hard work of the reverent researcher: he proceeds without ideological distortion, for his sole purpose is to ensure that Percy and his music (as if one could separate the two) are not going to be forgotten. And, also quietly and without fanfare, he wants us to honor Percy as an individualist, someone “with his own voice,” not simply another “tough tenor” following well-worn paths.\n\nTo the site. What will you find there? First a biography (audio as well as print) documenting his too-brief life (1928-1992) his musical development, his associations with Sonny Rollins, Bill Doggett, Jimmy Smith, Freddie Roach, Sir Charles Thompson. Charlie Parker and Count Basie make cameo appearances as well. Then, even more beautiful, remembrances by Doggett, Bill Easley, Allen Lowe, Mike LeDonne, Sascha Feinstein, Michael Hashim, Sammy Price, Randy Sandke, Chris Flory, Scott Hamilton and others — all testifying to Percy’s qualities as musician and gentleman.\n\nThen the treasure-box opens, revealing hours of unknown enlightenment and pleasure: a session by session listing, complete with newspaper clippings, photographs, record labels — first, Percy’s King and Blue Note record dates of 1949-1962.\n\nThe sessions continue — 1977-81, live dates featuring Percy alongside Doc Cheatham, Sammy Price, Chris Flory, Loren Schoenberg, Randy Sandke, Allen Lowe, Dick Katz, and others . . . and here Daniel has provided selections from these wonderful and wonderfully rare performances.\n\nFinally, and most expansively, the period 1982-1990, is documented through the Leonard Gaskin Papers held at the Smithsonian — and it contains seventy-five percent of Percy’s recorded work . . . with Gaskin, Cliff Smalls, Oliver Jackson, Budd Johnson, Buddy Tate, Lance Hayward, Bill Pemberton, Major Holley, Bob Neloms, Bill Berry, Wild Bill Davis, Big John Patton, Doug Lawrence, and others. And there’s MUSIC . . . my goodness, how much music there is. I abandoned my chores for the better part of the day to listen, and I still have more to hear.\n\nA few more words about Daniel Gould and his site. He is a clear fluent writer; his site is a pleasure to visit, and the treasures overflow. And he has a purpose: that Percy France, one of the lovely creators now no longer on the planet, shall be remembered with the attention and affection he deserves. I delight in Percy and in Daniel’s efforts.\n\nMay your happiness increase!"
