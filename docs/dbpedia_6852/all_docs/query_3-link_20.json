        "text": "It was hard to give a present to Michael. You couldn’t really buy things for he placed little value to having them. He was always happy to get a book from someone, something from an author or a disc from a musician or colleague. Life with him was always unassuming. He never cared about clothing or how he appeared . . . . although he did appreciate fine clothing.\n\nMichael loved people with a strong work ethic and admired Humility. He didn’t care about awards and much to my disappointment, never display them. It was the music that was important and with that he was driven to perfection. He cared deeply for the musicians and would offer anyone a place to stay if needed.\n\nIn business I think he would avoid conflict. If he couldn’t say something good, he would keep it to himself, and consequently, I’ve never heard a bad thing said about him.\n\nIf you wanted to please him, you would either keep quiet or make him laugh. He would say, “the best way to get through life is to say as little as possible.” Quick wit, sarcasm, dry humor and spontaneity were food for his soul and they made him smile.\n\nBeing alongside of Michael for 38 years was full of surprises, and always an entry ticket to the dressing room after the show. It was seldom disappointing. It was truly a gift.\n\nMichael meant a lot of good things . . .to a lot of good people.\n\nWe will all miss him.\n\nLisa Cuscuna\n\nBy now, most of the great jazz artists from the mid-century crucibles of bebop and its avant-garde successors are gone, and most of the rest, in their eighties and nineties, have retired from performing. Yet there are still troves of unheard treasures to be unearthed—from radio-station vaults, concert-hall storage rooms, musicians’ archives, and collections of bootlegs made by enthusiasts. Some are unreleased and others circulate in unauthorized versions, but a diligent and devoted community of producers working at specialist record labels has made a small but mighty industry of high-quality rediscoveries and reissues, often collaborating closely with musicians and their estates. This spring has brought an unusually rich spate of such releases, which, to my ear, stand out both for their musical excitement and for their place in the history of jazz. There’s also a new release by an octogenarian jazz great who seems to be getting younger by the year. – Richard Brody, Read More At The New Yorker\n\nMichael Cuscuna, a titan in the world of jazz, passed away on April 20, 2024, leaving behind a legacy that will resonate for generations.\n\nMichael is survived by his wife Lisa, his children, Max and his wife Jackie, and Lauren, and two grandchildren, Nicolas and Penelope Cuscuna. His passing leaves a void in the hearts of all who knew him. May he rest in peace, and forever be remembered as he will be deeply missed.\n\nThroughout his career, Michael possessed a curiosity for unearthing unissued jazz recordings, delving into the vaults of record labels looking for hidden gems. In 1975 his search led him to the great Blue Note vaults – unlocking a treasure of unissued material by the great jazz legends.\n\nThis experience would later be the impetus for co-founding Mosaic Records Inc, a boutique label specializing in complete sets of some of the most influential jazz artists. Mosaic Records, co-founded with Charles Lourie, produced hundreds of editions including works by Thelonious Monk, Sidney Bechet, Hank Mobley, John Coltrane, Lee Morgan, Dexter Gordon, Art Blakey, Tina Brooks, The Nat King Cole Trio and Miles Davis.\n\nMichael recently received a Lifetime Achievement Award from Downbeat and here is an excerpt of one of Michael’s last interviews this past January. (full interview here).\n\nBorn in Stamford, Connecticut, in 1948, Cuscuna first got into music at the age of 9 or 10. “It was contemporary R&B on the radio at first,” he recalled recently. “But I played drums on a little starter kit and got into drum records like Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich on Verve, then Max Roach and Art Blakey. When I started to hear the music around the drums, that’s when I got completely hooked. I went through Benny Goodman, Dave Brubeck and the MJQ, until I caught up to what was going on around me around 1960.\n\n“By age 14, I was going to Birdland, which had a peanut gallery. That’s when I heard Blakey and the Messengers, the Coltrane Quartet and Miles. They became my passion and still are. It’s the stuff that gets to you between about 12 and 25 that stays with you for life. You never absorb music in quite the same way after that.”\n\nMany years ago, Woody Shaw said of Cuscuna, “No matter what you produce or do in your life, the thing you’ll be remembered for is rescuing all that Blue Note material.”\n\n“Looking back all these years,” Cuscuna says today, “I’m content with that.”\n\nI’ve known Michael for 25+ years since having the privilege of joining Mosaic Records. While many are aware of the legacy of riches he has catalogued for one of the greatest art forms, all of us who work or have worked at Mosaic also know him as a hard worker, generous and dedicated to his family.\n\nMichael possessed an energetic spirit and drive that was infectious. When I look at the list of 200 sets for Mosaic plus all the Blue Note, Impulse and other recordings that Michael was instrumental in bringing to the public, it’s clear his passion for music drove his life-long ambitions. He was proud of his achievements while at the same time being very appreciative and grateful that he was working with many of the greatest jazz musicians and their body of work.\n\nIt’s very hard for me to convey my feelings about someone I worked closely with every day, had many lunches with and was treated to innumerable special musical memories. I’ll miss a partner, a lunch-mate, and a special friend.\n\nFred Pustay\n\n==============================================================================\n\nI can’t think of any better way to describe Michael than as my mentor. His guidance was immeasurable – filled with direction, leadership, knowledge, understanding, and of course, toss in some of that incredibly sarcastic wit and sense of humor. Michael knew, like his partner and close friend Charlie Lourie, how to run the business of a jazz re-issue label when there were few and far between such companies.\n\nHe also was a true family man. I saw and heard the love he unconditionally gave to his family. It was not uncommon to hear a heartfelt “I love you” at the end of a conversation to his wife Lisa, or to see and hear the love and dedication to his children, and then, in the past few years, the stories of his grandchildren who gave him immeasurable pleasure.\n\nMichael embraced my passion for jazz record collecting and after about a dozen years of managing the Mosaic warehouse he and Charlie gave me a job of producer, expanding the Mosaic catalog to include more pre-tape era boxed sets. I am ever in debt to the both of them.\n\nAnd there are so many other Mosaic journeys in the past 36 years that I could impart to you, as I’m sure there are many others who knew him even better than I that could spin countless tales of this unique man. Seek them out. Keep Michael in your heart and on your turntables, CD players or however else you listen to the music. And be grateful and thankful he was here on this planet.\n\nScott Wenzel\n\nPianist Billy Taylor waxes poetic in a JazzWax article on the importance of Don Byas and what he meant to not only tenor saxophonists but to improvisors in general on any instrument.\n\n“Don [Byas] was very special. He did something that was unbelievable in terms of really playing and showing the Europeans that the music was moving forward. What the Europeans heard him play was the beginning of what John Coltrane and others like him eventually did. He paved the way over there. He was way ahead of Coltrane on those sheets of sound. He was trying to make the tenor saxophone sound like Art Tatum.\n\nHe and Coltrane had the same idea for the same reason. They both had heard Art’s seamless runs on the piano. Don was trying to do that on the tenor back then. He was head and shoulders above everyone else. Don was also playing bebop and pre-bop. What I mean by pre-bop is he was playing things that led up to bebop. They were long phrases and new ways of using harmonies so that they sounded like the dominant melody. This stuff hadn’t been done yet until Don started playing them.” – Billy Taylor\n\nThis stunning version of “So What” comes from an April 2, 1959 CBS program featuring Miles’s quintet with John Coltrane and an ensemble arranged and assembled by Gil Evans. The first recording of “So What” was made exactly one month earlier. Played at its original medium-slow tempo, the piece is haunting. Over the years, the tempo accelerated to avalanche speed. Miles’s playing here is absolute perfection! – Michael Cuscuna\n\nLiner notes studio version: Bob Blumenthal\n\nBill Evans takes over for So What, which remains the most influential track from this most influential album and one of only two that became a permanent part of the Miles Davis repertoire. It is a 32-bar, AABA structure, built on two Dorian modes rather than a more detailed chord sequence. Once musicians grew accustomed to blowing over this open terrain, So What became the I Got Rhythm of modal jazz.\n\nIt is introduced here by piano and bass, playing the only detailed written material employed at the session which has been attributed to both Gil Evans (the more likely source) and Bill Evans. Chambers states the melody, with responses by Evans and the horns. The two-note kicker is another “amen” cadence that gets at the church-music echoes Davis wanted in the music, although the interval creates a far different feeling here than on Freddie Freeloader. Each soloist confronts the challenge of blowing over modes brilliantly; and each horn soloist draws distinct accompanying textures from Evans. The horns riff behind the piano solo, as Evans responds with complex chord voicings on the bridge of his chorus. – liner notes Mosaic Box set LP release\n\n“I’d actually met Don Cherry and Billy Higgins before Ornette. We got together and started playing at Don Cherry’s house. We would play every day and stop and talk about what we were doing and then we would play the tune over again. It was really something.\n\nComing to New York in 1959 was really exciting. I’d never been there before, and after checking into the hotel we went down to the Five Spot for a rehearsal…When we started playing every night, the place was packed with people not just from the music world but from the art world, from everywhere. There were famous painters, poets…\n\nOne night we were playing, Cherry was taking a solo and all of a sudden I heard the solo change direction and I opened my eyes and it was Miles. He had gotten up on the stand, taken Cherry’s horn and started playing. And there wasn’t a night when I didn’t open my eyes, look out at the audience or the bar and see some great bass player checking me out. Paul Chambers, Percy Heath, Mingus. Those were exciting days. Then we went on the road and scared everybody to death in the towns we played — Boston, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia. The musicians would come to hear us, word had come down the grapevine, people were expecting something new.” – Charlie Haden\n\nThe anticipation in The Town Hall was infectious, with the Cecil Taylor Unit and the audience melding their exhilaration into what would be an astounding performance.\n\nProudly, I can announce the revival of my label Oblivion Records to present the entire concert recording of Cecil Taylor’s Return Concert of 1973. The previous release of only one half of the performance, “Spring of Two Blue-J’s”, was hailed as one of his best recordings ever (and until now was only available as a European bootleg). The addition of a 90 minute quartet will only sharpen that opinion.\n\nThe concert is available now only on your favorite streaming service, with 100% of the proceeds going to the Cecil Taylor estate.\n\n50 years ago, two partners and I started a tiny record label to record world class blues and jazz musicians, and at the same time I’d oversee live jazz broadcasts at my college radio station in New York City. One day a manager asked if I’d record the concert of Cecil Taylor Unit’s triumphant return to New York City after several years teaching at midwestern US colleges. I jumped at the chance to work with one of the three acknowledged leaders of avant-garde jazz.\n\nThe second set would be perfect for the two sides of a vinyl LP which Cecil released on his own label; a side long solo backed with a quartet performance with stalwarts Andrew Cyrille, Jimmy Lyons and Sirone. Hailed as one of his best recordings ever, Cecil’s lack of interest in running a company allowed the 2000 copies to fall out of print, eventually only being available as a European bootleg ripped from the vinyl.\n\nFor years I hadn’t listened to the first half of the concert –”Autumn/Parade” was one uninterrupted hail of 88 minutes with the entire Unit– but during the pandemic I pulled out the tapes and realized history had been sitting on my shelves for almost half a century. Putting it together with the two part “Spring…” would allow the world to hear the astonishing progress of Cecil’s vision.\n\nYou can listen to “The Complete, Legendary, Live Return Concert at The Town Hall NYC November 4, 1973” right now on Spotify, Amazon, YouTube Music, Apple and Tidal.–Fred Seibert\n\nPreorders are now shipping!\n\nWe are working on the backlog and hope to ship all this week\n\nMost of the players Mr. Tristano admired were supremely ”hot” players – Roy Eldridge, Charlie Parker, Bud Powell. His other hero, Lester Young, was a light-toned but forcibly rhythmic improviser. Like Mr. Young, Mr. Tristano concerned himself with creating improvised lines that were longer, more thematically coherent, and more organically related to the rest of the material in a given performance than the lines created by most of his contemporaries.\n\nHis fondness for Bach’s fugues often carried over into contrapuntal group improvisations; sometimes he would improvise dizzying counterpoint alone at the piano, with his left and right hands moving utterly independently. He also reharmonized the standard pop tunes that were the basis of his improvisations, sometimes so radically that even musicians had to listen hard in order to recognize them.\n\nThe musicians who are Mr. Tristano’s contemporaries recognize his worth more readily than most of the critics. Charlie Parker frequently jammed with him, and their few recorded collaborations reveal an intriguing affinity. The chords the pianist played behind Mr. Parker were often so dense they were practically atonal, and they inspired the great saxophonist to some astonishingly inventive flights. A number of modern pianists made use of Mr. Tristano’s ideas, with George Shearing, Oscar Peterson, and Bill Evans simply the most prominent among them.\n\nNor did the free-form recordings fail to elicit a response. Miles Davis commented publicly on their importance, and several musicians who either participated in similar Tristano experiments or were close to his circle, including the saxophonists John LaPorta and Teo Macero, went on to record some early attempts at what was then called ”atonal jazz” with the bassist Charles Mingus.\n\nMr. Tristano was hardly an isolated or marginal figure, then. He was an important thinker and doer who provided a crucial link between the modern jazz of the 1940’s and freer forms of the late 50’s and after. – New York Times excerpt January 24, 1982\n\nExcept for some lean years in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Frank Sinatra was one of the greatest entertainers of all time and was able to find popularity like no one else of his generation. Frank was the master when it came to the singing of a ballad. He understood and gave meaning to the lyrics as he would by being a storyteller.\n\nThis was especially true with, what he would call, his “saloon songs” – songs of heartbreak and pain. And although he wasn’t a jazz singer (and by that I mean he didn’t scat or take incredible liberties of a song’s melody) he sure did know how to swing and his favorites included Billie Holiday, Lester Young and for phrasing Tommy Dorsey. To give you an outline of Sinatra’s years, we have songwriter, guitarist and vocalist Billy Vera expounding on the life along with musical examples. Billy covers it all and brings out key elements of this magical performer. – Scott Wenzel\n\nEven in a world shaped by iconoclastic creative geniuses, Lennie Tristano stood out. He applied his prodigious technique to new ways of creating improvised jazz. He often altered the roles of the left and right hands on the piano, built original chord sequences and gave rhythm a flexibility. He even performed completely free jazz in the late ‘40s. He built a deep empathy with his sidemen which was necessary to keep his music fresh and intuitive.\n\nDespite the accolades he received after arriving in New York in 1946, winning the Metronome poll, the support of artists like Charlie Parker and recording opportunities with Keynote and Capitol, Tristano developed a reputation as a great teacher, sharing his rhythmic and harmonic theories with his students.\n\nIn some ways, his performances and recording took a back seat to his teaching goals.\n\nNonetheless, Lennie Tristano led a variety of groups and continued to record and perform live when opportunities presented themselves. This 6-CD set of previously unreleased material from Lennie’s personal tape collection chronicles his growth and accomplishments from 1946 to 1970.\n\nCarol Tristano carefully curated this set of her father’s music and separated great performances by context. The 6 discs cover his early trio with Billy Bauer, his superhuman solo piano work, the sextet with Konitz and Marsh, the ‘50s trio with Peter Ind, duets with Sonny Dallas and live material from the Half Note in 1962. There’s never been a more comprehensive portrait of this genius.\n\n(Not yet available for preorder. Released date mid-November)\n\nGeorge Wein who died this week at 95 years old was an extraordinary person, who was often misunderstood. He loved music and wine and lived his life in pursuit of both on the highest level. He was a restless pianist who ended up being a club owner, record producer, concert promoter and festival creator/director. Some complained about not getting on one tour or another and others griped about being held to 50 minutes stage time. But those were disciplines that came with the job.\n\nGeorge’s taste were traditional, but he was a prime promoter in the careers of trailblazers like Miles Davis, Stan Getz, John Coltrane, Archie Shepp and so many more. He loved musicians and he loved the road. He also built an amazing international staff with people like Marie St. Louis, Simone Ginibre, John Philips and Danny Melmick who dedicated their lives to pulling off great events and treating musicians with love and kindness.\n\nGeorge was also fortunate to share a life with his wife Joyce who had many skills and complimented George and his musical activities seamlessly. Joyce passed away in 2005. His most cherished times were those shared with Joyce over food (she was a gourmet cook) and music and memories over experiences like playing piano for Lester Young for a week at Storyville in the early ‘50s. He was a no-bullshit delight and a generous soul. – Michael Cuscuna\n\nPhil Schaap, a fixture on the New York jazz scene for more than 50 years, succumbed to cancer on Tuesday, August 7 after a hard-fought four-year battle with the disease. His daily morning show “Bird Flight” on WKCR was an institution, shaped by his deep love of Charlie Parker’s music and his amazing memory for music and details. Programs could range from a two-hour lecture on minutiae on a specific day in Brid’s life to debuting newly discovered live music by Parker.\n\nPhil was also an educator, historian and reissue producer on such high profile box sets like the Complete Verve recordings of Charlie Parker, the Complete Miles Davis-Gil Evans Studio Sessions and the Dean Benedetti Recordings of Charlie Parker. Above all, he was a great friend who was generous with his knowledge and who could take himself seriously one minute and laugh at himself the next. He will be missed in so many ways. – Michael Cuscuna\n\nRead New Yorker article about Phil Schaap from 2008.\n\nRight in time for her 85th birthday, Carla Bley tops the DownBeat 69th International Critics Poll and becomes their choice for the DownBeat Hall of Fame. About time, don’t you think?\n\nSuzanne Lorge in her celebratory piece, Carla Bley: The Voice, charts the composer’s travels through 60 years of jazzdom, from her hanging with the New York avant-garde, composing for everyone from George Russell to Gary Burton, into her own big bands and orchestras, captivation of soul and R&B and back again toward chamber trios and duos. Not to mention her decades of recording, touring and entrepreneurship (with Michael Mantler) in record labels and distribution. And to this day, she doesn’t stop. Whew!\n\nBack in 1970, there was an evening where Carla unknowingly opened my ears, eyes and my world, like she would for countless others over the years. I not so innocently stumbled past a “Closed Session! Do not enter!” sign at the RCA Studios having no idea what this “Jazz Composer’s Orchestra” was, but as a young rock’n’roller looking for more I was interested in whatever ‘jazz’ was. The giant studio floor was completely filled with musicians –sure, a rhythm section, but also cello, clarinet, tuba, a whole orchestra, wait, is that Don Cherry?!– and I had no idea that this was an early session for what would unfold as the three LP opera (operas were back in vogue after The Who’s Tommy) Escalator over the Hill. It sure didn’t sound like jazz that night, but boy was it intriguing.\n\nA little later I overcame the indignity of Carla calling my college radio show when I admitted to chatting with friends during the New York radio debut of Escalator when she and Mantler invited me to become the packing assistant at their ground breaking New Music Distribution Service. And again when they asked me to do sound and road manager her first ever tour across the United States. Across every venture I was honored to witness, her open ended musical curiosity and open heart for the disenfranchised was mind expanding to anyone who would listen.\n\nOnce at NMDS, when we suggested dropping artist owned lines who barely sold but took just as much administration as the Philip Glass hits or the ECM releases, Carla admonished us.\n\n“My music was rejected by everyone, always! We started NMDS to help all the artists that no one else wants. How about this? If someone sells at least one album a year, we keep distributing their line?” And that was it. From then on we all knew what it was all about.\n\nCarla Bley stood for the artist and the art. What else is there? – Fred Seibert\n\nBy Ricky Riccardi\n\nBy the time we get to “Hotter Than That” from late 1927, the New Orleans ensemble sound is mostly gone. It is now a string of solos from start to finish, Armstrong opening the proceedings and setting the bar high on this romp based on the chord changes to “Bill Bailey.” Clarinetist Dodds and trombonist Ory contribute exciting outings but both sound primitive after Armstrong’s seamless brand of swing.\n\nIn the middle of the record, we hear Armstrong’s distinct voice for the first time in a stunning display of scat singing. Armstrong had put scat on the map with his 1926 record of “Heebie Jeebies” but he turns the “nonsense singing” into high art here during his duet with special guest Lonnie Johnson, another New Orleans native and a pioneer guitarist.\n\nIn the final chorus, Armstrong uncorks a spiraling ascending phrase before hammering home a two-note riff over and over, foreshadowing a decade’s worth of big band writing that would follow in the 1930s.\n\nArmstrong’s playing was now stimulated by younger contemporaries who grasped his concept on how to solo and how to swing. Having transformed jazz from an ensemble-based music into a soloist’s art, Armstrong bid adieu to the original Hot Five shortly after this session."
