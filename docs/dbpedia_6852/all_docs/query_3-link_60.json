His former colleague, the saxophonist Martin Speake, who worked with Motian on record and in concert, joins Alyn Shipton for a selection of the essential discs by this most innovative and influential of percussionists.

A star of fusion, but with a far wider stylistic range, Sanborn looks back at his 1975 debut Taking Off (which featured his long-term associates the Brecker Brothers); 1980s triumphs such as \"As We Speak\" right up to his current work, including 2010's \"Only Everything\".\n\n12/11/2011 • 33 minutes, 47 seconds\n\nRegina Carter\n\nViolinist Regina Carter is a major jazz talent from Detroit.

In this week's programme, prior to a concert at the London Jazz Festival, Portal joins Alyn Shipton to pick some of the best examples of his recorded jazz. From his multi-tracked solo \"Dajarme\" via work on clarinet, soprano, alto and tenor sax to his most recent album \"Baliador\", selections from which he will play in London, Portal's choices are eclectic and dazzlingly virtuosic.\n\n10/29/2011 • 26 minutes, 27 seconds\n\nLouis Jordan\n\nThe saxophonist and singer Louis Jordan bridged the gap between jazz and rhythm and blues, pioneering many techniques that would be the foundation of r and b, and of rock, but always played as straight ahead jazz.

So in this programme as well as sampling his work with jazz heavyweights such as Gary Burtion, Charlie Haden and Billy Higgins, we also hear him in full flight with members of Sex Mob, Deep Banana Blackout and Medeski, Martin & Wood.\n\n4/24/2010 • 25 minutes, 29 seconds\n\nRon Carter\n\nBassist Ron Carter is one of the most influential and revered instrumentalists in jazz, famous for his work with Miles Davis's 1960s quintet. He joins Alyn Shipton to select the highlights of his recording career, ranging from his work with Miles to string orchestras and his current quartet. Producer: Alyn Shipton.\n\n4/10/2010 • 24 minutes\n\nAl Grey\n\nTrombonist Al Grey (1925 - 2000) was one of the most distinctive soloists in big band jazz, working with many of the most famous swing orchestras. In an archive interview, recorded just before his death 11 years ago, Al selects his key recordings with, among others, Count Basie, Lionel Hampton and Dizzy Gillespie. With his gap-toothed grin, pith helmet and extrovert trombone style, Al Grey was one of the most colourful characters in jazz. He and Alyn Shipton first met when Radio 3 broadcast Lionel Hampton's Golden Men of Jazz, for whom Al was musical director. They kept in touch, and not long before Al's death in March 2000, Alyn visited him at his home in Great Neck Long Island to pick the trombonist's favourite recordings from his voluminous catalogue.\n\n4/3/2010 • 26 minutes, 31 seconds\n\nOrnette Coleman\n\nCelebrating Ornette Coleman's 80th birthday in March 2010, Alyn Shipton was joined by Scottish saxophonist Paul Towndrow to select the key recordings by Coleman, the saxophonist who developed free jazz in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\n3/20/2010 • 33 minutes, 35 seconds\n\nEd Thigpen\n\nJazz Library pays tribute to the drummer Ed Thigpen who died in January.

In this edition of Jazz Library she joins Alyn Shipton to celebrate her 92nd birthday next month, and to select the highlights both from her recordings with her own trio, and also from available CDs of her radio series. Producer: Alyn Shipton.\n\n2/20/2010 • 27 minutes, 11 seconds\n\nKeith Tippett\n\nPianist Keith Tippett is a musician of extraordinary breadth and vision. His projects range from the vast 50-piece orchestra Centipede - so large it had its own private plane for touring - to introspective improvised solo concerts. He joins Alyn Shipton to pick the highlights of a recorded catalogue that spans over forty years, and which not only contains his ensembles large and small, but several surprises as well. Keith Tippett is one of Britain's most inventive musicians, although nowadays he something of a prophet without honour in his own land, celebrated in Europe, but performing infrequently at home. This edition of Jazz Library demonstrates just what local audiences have been missing, in a fascinating spread of music in which Tippett handles sprawling big bands with the same sureness of touch as he applies to his own piano playing. The programme includes his large groups Tapestry, Ark and Centipede, his current band Mujician, the celebratory Dedication Orchestra which commemorates the cream of South African jazz players, and Keith's long musical partnership with his wife, Julie Tippetts, who was formerly known as the pop singer Julie Driscoll, with her top ten hit for Brian Auger \"Wheels on Fire\".\n\n2/13/2010 • 38 minutes, 35 seconds\n\nA Tribute to John Dankworth\n\nOn 6 February 2010, Sir John Dankworth died aged 82.

To select his finest recordings, Alyn Shipton is joined by the young British pianist Neil Cowley. The programme includes examples of Garner's earliest stride style, covers the emergence of his own individual jazz voice, and features his most popular album \"Concert by the Sea\". Producer Alyn Shipton.\n\n1/30/2010 • 37 minutes, 44 seconds\n\nBing Crosby\n\nFocusing on the jazz side of Bing Crosby, Gwyneth Herbert joins Alyn Shipton to pick Bing's jazziest recordings, ranging from his Paul Whiteman days to the swing bands of Buddy Bregman and Billy May, and including Bing's immortal discs with Louis Armstrong.\n\n12/26/2009 • 34 minutes, 54 seconds\n\nStefano Bollani\n\nOne of the highlights of 2009's London Jazz Festival was pianist Stefano Bollani's residency at Kings Place, where the Italian gave solo performances as well as concerts in duo, trio and quintet settings. Recorded in front of an audience at the festival, Alyn Shipton talks to Bollani about his varied recording career, including his latest trio outing for ECM.\n\n12/19/2009 • 37 minutes, 12 seconds\n\nLawrence Lucie\n\nSwing guitarist Lawrence Lucie died in 2009, aged 101. Not long before his death, Lucie met Alyn Shipton in New York to look back over his remarkable career, which not only included stints with Fletcher Henderson, Lucky Millinder and Benny Carter, but a long stay in Louis Armstrong's orchestra. Lucie was also the longest surviving member of Jelly Roll Morton's band, and he looks back on his work with the self-styled \"inventor of jazz\".\n\n12/12/2009 • 24 minutes, 27 seconds\n\nGraham Collier\n\nFew people did more to promote the cause of jazz in Britain than Graham Collier, who died on September 9th. He led a succession of pioneering ensembles over the last 45 years, and was a key figure in Jazz Education. Collier was still actively writing and composing right up until the time of his death. In this special memorial edition of Jazz Library, Alyn Shipton presents an archive interview with Collier, who selected highlights from his long career, from early triumphs such as Down Another Road to his last issued album Directing 14 Jackson Pollocks.\n\n12/5/2009 • 33 minutes, 29 seconds\n\nLionel Hampton\n\nCritic and pianist Brian Priestley joins Alyn Shipton to select recording highlights from the career of drummer, vibraphonist and pianist Lionel Hampton, one of the greatest musicians of the swing era.

Together, they pick the critical high points of Getz's work, from the 1940s Woody Herman Orchestra, through to his many small groups, and by way of the bossa nova craze to his final quartet of the 1980s.\n\n11/7/2009 • 35 minutes, 59 seconds\n\nStuff Smith\n\nTo mark jazz violinist Stuff Smith's centenary year in 2009, Alyn Shipton meets fiddle player Chris Garrick to celebrate one of the most unusual instrumentalists in jazz. They chart a course through the available recordings, from the 52nd Street days of Stuff's Onyx Club Boys to his latter-day triumphs as a soloist in Europe, and also present new releases of previously unavailable material.\n\n10/31/2009 • 34 minutes, 22 seconds\n\nRashied Ali\n\nUntil his untimely death in 2009, Rashied Ali was widely regarded as the doyen of free jazz drummers. He made his name in John Coltrane's quartet and went on to a wide range of musical activity in the forty-two years since Coltrane's death. More of a colourist than a rhythm player, Rashied Ali changed the role of jazz drumming for ever. In a candid interview with Alyn Shipton he explains the importance of John Coltrane to his life and work, and selects the finest records they made together, before also selecting highlights of his discs with Marion Brown, Archie Shepp, Eddie Henderson and his own bands.\n\n10/24/2009 • 27 minutes, 15 seconds\n\nBill Frisell\n\nLooking forward to guitarist Bill Frisell's appearance at the 2009 London Jazz Festival, Alyn Shipton is joined by Phil Robson to select Frisell's finest recordings.

Singer Christine Tobin joins Alyn Shipton to pick the highlights from the more than 60 albums that McRae made before her death in 1994.\n\n10/3/2009 • 30 minutes, 2 seconds\n\nGeorge Russell\n\nThe jazz composer and theorist George Russell was a major innovator in jazz for over 50 years. In an archive interview with Alyn Shipton, Russell looks back at the highlights of a recorded repertoire that began with Dizzy Gillespie's big band and went on to encompass modal jazz and the dawn of jazz rock fusion. George Russell was a ceaseless experimenter - spending most of his life writing his theoretical masterwork on Lydian Modal theory - but on the way writing extended compositions for Dizzy Gillespie in the 1940s, introducing Miles Davis and John Coltrane to modal jazz in the '50s, and mixing world jazz and rock with Jan Garbarek and Terje Rypdal in the 60s. His Living Time Orchestra ran from the '70s to the present decade and included innovative soloists from both sides of the Atlantic. In conversation with Alyn Shipton, who visited Russell at his home near the New England Conservatory in Boston, the composer looks back at what he considers the highlights of his work, and at his standard compositions such as All About Rosie and Ezz-Thetic.\n\n9/26/2009 • 24 minutes, 56 seconds\n\nCarla Bley\n\nPianist and composer Carla Bley joins Alyn Shipton to choose her essential records, from the jazz opera Escalator Over the Hill via her various big bands, to her current small groups.\n\n9/19/2009 • 30 minutes, 56 seconds\n\nHampton Hawes\n\nIn the 1950s, Hampton Hawes was the most exciting and technically gifted pianist in Los Angeles. Pianist and author Tim Richards guides Alyn Shipton through the highlights of Hawes' trio recordings made with the likes of saxophonist Art Pepper, works which are considered landmarks in the history of jazz piano. After a period in prison, Hawes emerged a changed man - Richards also selects the key recordings from his later more contemplative years.\n\n9/5/2009 • 29 minutes, 50 seconds\n\nBilly Taylor\n\nAlthough he is not as well known in the UK as in America, where he is the best-known broadcaster on jazz, pianist Dr Billy Taylor is a hugely influential musical figure.

Alyn Shipton presents an archive interview with Hanna in which the drummer selects the highlights from his recorded work, including discs with Herman, Harry James, Marian McPartland and Toshiko Akiyoshi. When Jake Hanna joined Harry James, the bandleader sent his wife to collect him and his drums from the station - not everyone can claim to have been met off a train by Betty Grable. This is just one of the stories that Jake Hanna tells Alyn Shipton in his highly entertaining account of his recording career, which also includes work with Bing Crosby and re-launching the career of Rosemary Clooney as a jazz singer.\n\n8/8/2009 • 24 minutes, 28 seconds\n\nJoe Pass\n\nGuitarist Joe Pass recovered from narcotic addiction to launch a stellar international career as arguably one of the finest exponents of his instrument in jazz history.

Manne spanned more different styles of jazz than almost any musician, ranging from the swing groups of Coleman Hawkins to the free jazz of Ornette Coleman.\n\n7/25/2009 • 31 minutes, 38 seconds\n\nRoland Hanna\n\nRoland Hanna was one of the most dazzlingly talented of pianists until his untimely death from a viral infection in 2002. Just weeks before he fell ill, he met Alyn Shipton for what turned out to be his final interview, looking back on his long and distinguished recording career, including his brilliant contribution to Mingus Dynasty.\n\n7/18/2009 • 20 minutes, 52 seconds\n\nTeddy Edwards\n\nThe late, great tenor saxophonist Teddy Edwards talks to Alyn Shipton. Shortly before his death in 2003, Teddy Edwards met Alyn to discuss the highlights of a long and illustrious recording career. One of the most original voices in West Coast jazz, he settled permanently in Los Angeles in 1944 and created a distinctive and original bebop style.\n\n7/11/2009 • 21 minutes, 24 seconds\n\nNat King Cole\n\nGwyneth Herbert joins Alyn Shipton to select the high points of Nat King Cole's work as a hugely influential pianist, charismatic vocalist, and one of the most combative of all jam session players. Music includes Straighten Up and Fly Right, Nature Boy and the legendary After Midnight sessions.\n\n7/4/2009 • 38 minutes, 13 seconds\n\nBud Shank\n\nBud Shank was one of the major figures in West Coast Jazz before his death in April 2009. To commemorate Bud and his music, Alyn Shipton selects Shank's key recordings, with the help of a 1992 archive interview with the man himself, covering his work with Stan Kenton, Shorty Rogers, the LA Four and many of his own groups.\n\n6/20/2009 • 25 minutes, 22 seconds\n\nBooker Little\n\nAlyn Shipton is joined by Tom Perchard to select the highlights from trumpeter Booker Little's recorded catalogue. Before his death in 1961 aged 23, Little was seen as one of the brightest hopes of jazz in the 1950s, forging a new compositional and playing style that offered a way forward from bebop that was strikingly original.\n\n6/13/2009 • 28 minutes, 41 seconds\n\nJoni Mitchell\n\nSinger Christine Tobin guides Alyn Shipton through the jazz-oriented repertoire of Joni Mitchell, including her work with Wayne Shorter, Jaco Pastorius and Herbie Hancock. Mitchell often employed jazz musicians on her recordings, but she was also fascinated by Charles Mingus, making an album of his music shortly before his death.\n\n6/6/2009 • 29 minutes, 28 seconds\n\nDave Liebman\n\nDave Liebman came to fame as the saxophonist in Miles Davis's 1970s band, but he has had a formidable career since the 1980s as a bandleader in his own right, often specialising on the soprano instrument, but also returning to the his first love, the tenor. He joins Alyn Shipton in front of an audience at Cheltenham Town Hall to select the highlights of his recordings. In this Jazz Library, Dave Liebman, who was the Cheltenham Jazz Festival's artist in residence in 2009, joins Alyn Shipton to look back over his extensive catalogue of recordings, including free solo improvisations, reinterpretations of classical music, tributes to John Coltrane and interpretations of standards. A virtuoso musician who is also a leader in the world of jazz education, Liebman shows his mastery in a variety of settings from playing completely unaccompanied to working with a full-scale big band.\n\n5/30/2009 • 33 minutes, 50 seconds\n\nBob Wilber\n\nEighty-one-year old Bob Wilber is one of the leading clarinettists and saxophonists in traditional jazz, and he joins Alyn Shipton to look back at the highlights of a career that began when Bob was a teenage pupil of the great Sidney Bechet. The programme covers recordings from the 1940s to the present day and includes Wilber's dramatic recreations of Ellington for the Francis Ford Coppola film The Cotton Club.\n\n5/16/2009 • 35 minutes, 53 seconds\n\nHugh Masekela\n\nSouth African trumpeter Hugh Masekela joined Alyn Shipton to discuss his finest recordings. For Hugh Masekela, jazz and political activism go hand in hand. As he guides Alyn Shipton through his recording career, we hear of his first band, the Jazz Epistles, cruelly cut short when the Sharpeville Massacre led to large public gatherings being banned on the eve of its first national tour. We follow him to London and New York, with his early American album Grrrr! and his London session Music Is Where The Heart Is with revolutionary saxophonist Dudu Pukwana. Hugh then traces his career as an exile through discs made in New York, and in Botswana, where he recorded during the years he was unable to enter South Africa. His music blends jazz and Afro-Pop, using the characteristic sounds of South African choirs and voices as essential ingredients alongside his distinctive trumpet and flugelhorn playing, creating music that always evokes his homeland, but never loses touch with the African-American jazz that inspired his vision of freedom.\n\n4/25/2009 • 26 minutes, 53 seconds\n\nHeath Brothers\n\nFew families have produced three such exceptional musical brothers as Percy, Jimmy and Tootie Heath, a bassist, saxophonist and drummer who have worked at the highest level. On one of their last visits to London before Percy's death in 2005, Alyn Shipton talked to all three of them about their collective and individual careers in jazz, introducing not only the finest albums they made together, but their discs with other musicians as varied as Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Dexter Gordon and Wes Montgomery. The Heath Brothers band was a legendary ensemble in jazz from the 1970s to the death of bassist Percy Heath in 2005. All three brothers, Percy, saxophonist Jimmy and drummer Tootie, were masters of their art, and there was a collective magic about their appearances together. But in this programme Percy also talks about his work with Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Quartet, Jimmy remembers his earliest records with John Coltrane when they were fellow members of Dizzy Gillespie's band, and Tootie recalls the thrill of accompanying Wes Montgomery and Dexter Gordon. We also hear their work together on the albums 'Triple Threat' and 'As We Were Saying'.\n\n4/11/2009 • 29 minutes, 2 seconds\n\nJoshua Redman\n\nIn a programme recorded at the Gateshead Jazz Festival 2009, Alyn Shipton is joined by saxophonist Joshua Redman to look back at his best recordings. These include his early quintets and quartets, his trios with organist Sam Yahel, right up to more recent albums, all of them marked out by Redman's consistent balance between exploration and instrumental virtuosity.\n\n4/4/2009 • 34 minutes, 18 seconds\n\nSheila Jordan\n\nAmerican singer Sheila Jordan joins Alyn Shipton in front of an audience at the Gateshead International Jazz Festival 2009 to select the highlights from her half-century as arguably one of the most adventurous and individual singers in jazz. The programme features her minimal settings and explorations of timbre and timing, from her 1960s classic Portrait of Sheila to her most recent recordings.\n\n3/28/2009 • 36 minutes, 56 seconds\n\nLouie Bellson\n\nIn a special tribute to drummer Louie Bellson, who died in February 2009, Alyn Shipton presents an archive interview with the man himself, in which he selects key records from his career.

As well as collaborations with such great American players as Duke Jordan, Warne Marsh and Lee Konitz, he explains his fondness for working in duo with guitarists or other bass players.\n\n3/14/2009 • 29 minutes, 12 seconds\n\nBrad Mehldau\n\nSinger Gwyneth Herbert has proved herself an insightful commentator on the recordings of fellow vocalists on Jazz Library, but in this week's programme she shares her enthusiasm for the pianist Brad Mehldau, who is one of the most challenging and innovative of contemporary jazz players. With a repertoire ranging from Broadway songs to the works of contemporary rock players, his music seldom stands still. He is a romantic player in the grand tradition of Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett, but also a fearless experimenter with time, and musical structure. Gwyneth Herbert joins Alyn Shipton to pick Mehldau's finest recordings, as a soloist, with his trio and with the bands of Lee Konitz and Charles Lloyd. Brad Mehldau performs at the 2010 London Jazz Festival.\n\n3/7/2009 • 29 minutes, 36 seconds\n\nDexter Gordon\n\nThe tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon was one of the first tenor saxophonists in jazz to adopt the bebop style in the 1940s, going on to become one of the most influential and distinctive soloists of the 60s and 70s. Soweto Kinch joins Alyn Shipton to select Gordon's finest recordings, ranging from his early days with Billy Eckstine to his Oscar-nominated performance in Bertrand Tavernier's film \"Round Midnight\".\n\n2/28/2009 • 33 minutes, 44 seconds\n\nGene Krupa\n\nAlyn Shipton is joined by vintage-drum expert Richard Pite to select the highlights from Krupa's many recordings.

Born Herman Blount, he was as famous for his exotic headgear and claims that his inspiration and music came from outer space, as his band The Arkestra. Yet beneath the exotic image, Ra was a highly creative musician, redefining the structure and sound of the jazz big band.\n\n10/18/2008 • 35 minutes, 24 seconds\n\nBenny Goodman\n\nThe King of Swing, and one of the finest of all jazz clarinetists, Benny Goodman recorded prolifically, and was as dazzlingly talented in a big band setting as in a small group.
