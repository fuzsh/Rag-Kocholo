First came \"Live in '65 & '68,\" a gem from the latest series of \"Jazz Icons\" DVDs on Naxos (jazzicons.com). Consisting of a pair of concerts in Copenhagen originally taped for television broadcast, it finds Mr. Rollins, the great tenor saxophonist, in casual form but at a creative peak, improvising with an astonishing flow of ideas. In the loose but invigorating 1965 performance he digs in with Alan Dawson, a whip-smart and underdocumented Boston drummer, and Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen, a precociously nimble Danish bassist. The 1968 concert feels a bit more settled and less surprising, with Mr. Rollins and Mr. Orsted Pedersen alongside Kenny Drew on piano and Albert (Tootie) Heath on drums. In both instances there's a deceptively breezy version of Mr. Rollins's signature calypso \"St. Thomas,\" and he makes each feel like a fresh opportunity.\n\nback to list\n\nNew on DVD\n\nBy Mike Clark, USA TODAY\n\nOctober 2, 2008\n\nBox sets\n\nJazz Icons 3 (1958-75, Naxos, unrated, $20 each or a $120 box with bonus eighth disc): A sequel to perhaps DVD's most revered jazz sets again plumbs European archives. Nina Simone performs Bob Dylan's The Ballad of Hollis Brown and sings movingly of Martin Luther King Jr. Saxist Sonny Rollins offers two versions of St. Thomas. Bill Evans' piano-playing can be intense, but the brow of seemingly looser Oscar Peterson is drenched, too. Also: Lionel Hampton, Cannonball Adderley and Rahsaan Roland Kirk.\n\nback to list\n\nDecember 9, 2008\n\nDVD of the Week: Sonny Rollins-Live in ’65 & ’68\n\nFor enthusiasts of archival treasures featuring the great tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins, who were put off by the variable quality of his recent compilation “Road Shows, Vol. 1,” relief is here. The “Jazz Icons DVD” release of Sonny Rollins-Live in ‘65 & ‘68, featuring performances filmed for television in Denmark, offers some of the best music that Rollins ever recorded—in particular, the 1965 session, from the Copenhagen Jazz Festival.\n\nOn tour in Europe with others from the Newport Jazz Festival, he was matched with the American drummer Alan Dawson (famous as Tony Williams’s teacher, and frequently recorded alongside Booker Ervin) and the nineteen-year-old Danish bassist, Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen. The company proved immensely stimulating. Rollins plays almost uninterruptedly for nearly an hour, picking up heat and whimsy as he goes along. His full, hearty sound is exceptionally sculptured, bluff, and pliable; the notes of the rising phrase in the opening number, “There Will Never Be Another You,” seem to hang in the air like balloons. Dawson sets a brisk, light tempo, Rollins makes room for Pedersen’s solo, and then sidles over into the harmonic wilds and lets fly cascades of notes and broken, modernistic tones while trading fours with the drummer, before ending with a suave solo cadenza.\n\nBut the high point of the show is a medley—a genre that Rollins had attempted several times in the studio and here (as Ashley Kahn reports in the liner notes) undertook spontaneously—of “Oleo” and “Sonnymoon for Two.” (Credit for the inspiration, on the evidence of the disk, should go to Dawson.) The rapid-fire “Oleo,” Rollins’s 1954 variation on “I Got Rhythm,” begins with a rhapsodic phrase of Vernon Duke’s ballad “I Can’t Get Started,” before Rollins builds from an elegant melodic swagger to swirling, keening phrases of great intensity. Dawson, after trading breaks with Rollins (and another swaggering Rollins solo), takes a long, swinging solo that ends with a cool, jolting halving of the tempo on the hi-hat cymbal; but by the time his right hand gets back to the first, fast tempo on the ride cymbal, Rollins himself has halved the tempo, playing the closest thing he has to a signature theme, “Sonnymoon for Two.” Dawson quickly picks up on it, pressing him on with a loose shuffle boogie that prompts Rollins to wild bluesy furies. It’s as great as anything Rollins has ever done; the following ballad medley—“I Can’t Get Started” and “Darn That Dream”—stays at the same astonishing level of intensity and spontaneity.\n\nBy contrast, the 1968 session isn’t much: Rollins, having had something like a musical breakdown, hadn’t recorded since 1966, and he sounds somewhat tentative, even nostalgic, and interacts only mildly with his fine band, which includes Pedersen, the American expatriate pianist Kenny Drew, and the drummer Albert (Tootie) Heath; but the marvels of the first, longer performance make the disk not merely delightful but essential, a new and crucial addition to the Rollins discography.\n\nback to list\n\nJazz Giants Swing on Cool DVD Collection\n\nReview by Mike Zwerin\n\nOct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- This kind of thing is often said about products, but it's rarely true: The three \"Jazz Icons'' DVD boxes (Reelin' In The Years Productions) are essential to your collection.\n\nVolume Three, which features Sonny Rollins, Nina Simone, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Bill Evans, Cannonball Adderley, Oscar Peterson and Lionel Hampton, is just out. The DVDs are sold separately as well as part of the box, which includes a bonus disc.\n\nThe performances were sponsored, recorded and preserved by television stations in Denmark, Holland, Sweden, Belgium, France, Norway and Finland. ``Preserved'' is not the least of it.\n\nNone of these performances, from 1958 to 1975, when giants still strode the earth, has been on the market before. If U.S. TV ever recorded top-quality non-pop-star musicians such as these, which is doubtful, they tended to erase and re-record on the tapes rather than store them.\n\nIt's a privilege to be able to watch these, yes, icons, in their prime, close-up. Their sidemen are excellent, though sidemen credits are not always easy to find in the liner notes. But let's not quibble.\n\nThe ``Jazz Icon'' DVD collections are still more evidence, if any is needed, of how, for maybe half a century and in a kind of reverse colonialism, Europe has been the strongest market for American jazz.\n\nHere are some images that stay in the mind. (Something about the music works better in black and white.)\n\nSonny's Tune\n\nRollins was and is one of the most inventive improvisers of them all. As his explorations unwind, he keeps referring back to the tune in the most varied and interesting ways. He never forgets the tune. He plays with his eyes wide open sometimes, and when he does he's somehow always looking right at you.\n\nKirk made himself into a musical instrument, basically he played the Kirkophone. He's a sight to behold, with three saxophones -- sometimes he played all three at the same time -- and a bird whistle hanging from his neck, a flute waiting to be addressed in a sax bell, wearing his Ray Charles shades. Oddly -- he was blind -- you can't really appreciate his music unless you also look at him.\n\nEvans is the only white bandleader of the series, whatever that means. His eyes are pinned, he is gaunt and sallow and he obviously has some bad habits. I hope it is coincidental, but I have never heard him sound better.\n\nRay on the Bass\n\nTo my taste, Peterson played too many notes. I have long been puzzled why that never seemed to bother most other people. To me, one of the best things about Peterson is that he hired Ray Brown as his bass player.\n\nThis isn't football, there's no winner, but Ray Brown may well be the best bassist of all time. One of the joys about ``Jazz Icons'' is watching him in close-up. The communication among Peterson, Brown and drummer Ed Thigpen is so intense that it becomes physical as well as mental.\n\nThe combination of love, hurt, humor, intelligence and beauty on Simone's face is, as we used to say, mind-blowing. There is no way to fully appreciate her voice other than also seeing her close-up. This is a must for all her fans, and we are legion.\n\nYes, if you've read this far, this package is essential to your well-being.\n\nThe boxed set of the seven DVDs plus a bonus item costs $119.99. The individual DVDs are priced at $19.99. For more information, see http://www.reelinintheyears.com/.\n\n(Mike Zwerin is a critic for Bloomberg News. Opinions expressed are his own.)\n\nback to list\n\nFriday, September 26, 2008\n\nMedia Room\n\n\"Jazz Icons: Series 3\" (Naxos, 8-DVD box set, $89.99) - America in the 1960s wasn't always a welcoming place for jazz musicians. Many of the best headed to Europe, where adoring audiences almost guaranteed successful tours. Part of the legacy of that era, fittingly enough, is a treasure trove of video recordings made in European television studios and concert halls - footage rarely, if ever, seen since it was made.\n\nNaxos has been dredging through those forgotten vaults, releasing stunning DVDs of everyone from John Coltrane to Ella Fitzgerald. With the debut this month of a seven-disc collection of performances by Sonny Rollins, Oscar Peterson, Lionel Hampton, Nina Simone, Bill Evans, Cannonball Adderley and Rahsaan Roland Kirk, it looks as if the company has another winner - an often riveting look at some of jazz's greatest players in their prime.\n\nShot between 1958 and 1975 in studios and small concert halls, the black-and-white videos don't really capture the vitality of a club performance, and the settings sometimes can seem a little formal. However, that's all forgotten in the intensity of the playing. To see Mr. Evans, head bowed deeply into the keyboard, performing \"My Foolish Heart\" in an intimate 1964 performance, or Miss Simone giving a playing-for-keeps account of \"Mississippi Goddam\" is to discover depths that audio recordings don't always reveal. Also, who can resist the sly charm on Mr. Peterson's face when he lets loose some unexpected changes? Or Mr. Kirk's wildly kinetic mastery of the half-dozen instruments draped around his neck?\n\nRecording quality varies from very good to excellent, and with more than seven hours of material on these discs, there's enough to keep any jazz lover happily exploring for days. The DVDs can be bought separately or as a boxed set, and there are surprises on every disc; check out trumpeter Clark Terry scat-singing at the end of Cannonball Adderley's set or the jaw-dropping virtuosity of Danish bassist Niels Henning Orsted-Pedersen - who was all of 19 years old in this recording with Sonny Rollins.\n\n- Stephen Brookes\n\nback to list\n\nIconography of the aural sort\n\nSeptember 28, 2008\n\nJazz DVD | Steve Greenlee\n\nFew jazz experiences are more enjoyable than putting on a classic Rahsaan Roland Kirk album and marveling at his ability to play two and three saxophones at the same time. But a record like \"Rip, Rig, and Panic\" or \"Blacknuss\" can deliver only so much information. Actually watching Kirk do what he did elevates the experience to a whole new level.\n\nThis is why the \"Jazz Icons\" catalog of DVDs has become so invaluable. With its third series arriving this week, the \"Jazz Icons\" project from Naxos has quickly become one of the most intimate ways to experience the full artistry of our jazz legends. The seven new DVDs can be purchased individually or as part of a box set, which comes with a bonus disc. This installment features concerts and television recordings from Cannonball Adderley, Bill Evans, Lionel Hampton, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Oscar Peterson, Sonny Rollins, and Nina Simone, all filmed in Europe between 1958 and 1975.\n\nThere is a lot to absorb. The Kirk DVD contains two versions of his showcase tune, \"Three for the Festival,\" from 1963. To watch him blow into three saxophones, essentially playing chords, is to be amazed at his dexterity, not to mention his lung capacity.\n\nSimone's performances are riveting. She sits at the piano, seriousness and anger on her face, and turns social protest into high art. She closes her 1965 set in Holland with a harrowing version of \"Mississippi Goddam,\" and when she hits the final chord she simply says \"That's it,\" and the concert is over.\n\nWe get close-up looks at two very different pianists. Bill Evans, introspective as ever, turns in beautiful renditions of \"'Round Midnight\" and \"Someday My Prince Will Come\" in a Swedish club in 1970, his head bowed straight down the entire set. Oscar Peterson works up a sweat as he takes his trio through a raucous version of Duke Ellington's \"C-Jam Blues.\"\n\nThe Rollins set from 1965 in Denmark is filmed beautifully, the saxophonist and his sidemen shot against solid black. Rollins leads a typically rousing take of his signature calypso, \"St. Thomas,\" and then listens intently to the other musicians. When the tune concludes, he checks his watch, perhaps wondering how many more songs he could fit into the remainder of his set. You don't get that kind of information from a CD.\n\nExtras: Additional footage of Rollins, Kirk, and Simone on the bonus disc. (Naxos, $19.99 each; $119.99 for the box set)\n\nback to list\n\nJazz DVDs Invite You To Watch and Learn\n\nBy WILL FRIEDWALD | September 29, 2008\n\nThe godfather of jazz on film was not a performer or a producer but a collector and archivist named David Chertok. Decades before YouTube, DVDs, or even videotapes, Chertok (1922-88) offered 16 mm footage of jazz's canonical figures in a long-running series of concert-like shows at the New School and, eventually, all over the world. From clips of Louis Armstrong displaying his radiance in 1930s Hollywood features to Charlie Parker receiving an award from Earl Wilson to Thelonious Monk doing his dancing bear act, Chertok gave us an amazing way to absorb jazz. He was showing us what we never thought we'd see, making jazz more \"real\" to us than any record ever could. (Chertok once bequeathed to me a piece of footage so rare - of the great British jazz and pop singer Al Bowlly - that when Hugh Hefner heard about it, I was summoned to the Playboy Mansion. But that's another story.)\n\nChertok couldn't imagine a world in which jazz video is as accessible as vinyl used to be, where all one has to do is pop a disc into a player or type a name into a search engine. Not that there's anything wrong with good old studio albums, which offer a kind of perfection you won't get in a TV appearance, particularly if you want a carefully conceived concept collection. But live performances, snippets and segments of which constitute most of the action on the new eight-disc collection \"Jazz Icons: Series 3\" (Reelin' in the Years, jazzicons.com), have a raw energy and spontaneity that no studio session can match. Even when it's a regular touring group, playing the same set night after night, the players get something back from the audience that they don't get anywhere else.\n\nThen there's the proof factor. I have played Rahsaan Roland Kirk for younger listeners and tried to explain to them that the three saxophones they're hearing are, in fact, one man playing all three instruments simultaneously, without overdubs. But here is the proof, in the form of footage of a 1967 show in Norway: The blind miracle man you see whipping those horns around, resting his flute in his tenor sax when he's not playing it, is a one-man reed section.\n\nNaturally, there are different kinds of virtuosity that need to be documented by the camera. Oscar Peterson played only one piano at a time, but unless you were fortunate enough to witness him in action at the height of his powers, no one would blame you for believing he had eight arms and was playing four pianos at once.\n\nFor a convenient point of comparison, Kirk begins his 1963 Belgium studio set with Milt Jackson's \"Bags Groove\" and Peterson commences his Swedish concert of the same year with essentially the same tune, here titled \"Reunion Blues\" (but also credited to Milt Jackson). It's hard to say who is more impressive - Peterson with his flying digits or Kirk with his whirling horns and one-man band apparatus.\n\nI never got see Bill Evans perform. On his album covers, he always looked like the essence of nerdy cool, cigarette dangling perilously low, threatening to incinerate either his tie or the Steinway. And just as Peterson appears here beaming at the crowd with his head held high, Evans too is in his characteristic pose, his head hanging limp like a rag doll, too focused on the music to notice the cameras or, for that matter, the crowd. The Icons series includes parts of five Evans shows, concluding with a heavily bearded Evans in color in 1975. But my favorite is a 1965 French concert, in which Evans plays one of his most intimate ballads, \"Detour Ahead,\" and every note shines as though it were crafted by Harry Winston.\n\nThe third pianist in the new package, Nina Simone, was possibly the most extroverted keyboardist-singer in all of jazz or pop - yet also one of the most subtle. In segments of two shows from 1965 and 1968, Simone had already eschewed her earlier standards and show tunes in favor of protest songs. (One can date the first show by noting that Simone still says \"negro\" rather than \"black.\") Her signature tune, \"Four Women,\" is another of those pieces that needs to be seen rather than merely heard - a major piece of acting in which Simone transforms herself into four distinct characters right before our eyes and makes sure that everybody knows about \"Mississippi Goddam.\"\n\nSurprises abound throughout the rest of the series: Cannonball Adderley and his Sextet, with their full-dress tuxedos, look curiously formal in 1963 for a group whose specialty was the funky backwoods blues; Lionel Hampton and his 1958 orchestra comes up with something like a concert presentation that encompasses a makeshift history of jazz and climaxes in an orgiastic \"Flying Home,\" and Sonny Rollins plays two remarkable sets with his 1959 tenor saxophone-bass-drums trio - costarring the young Henry Grimes - including his only documented performance of the beautiful ballad \"A Weaver of Dreams.\"\n\nUntil you've seen Rollins, Roland Kirk, Oscar Peterson, and Bill Evans in performance, you haven't really experienced them, and they're like nothing you've ever seen before. This is the third release in the Jazz Icons series, bringing the total up to 27 volumes, making it possibly the most complete jazz-on-film library available. Here's hoping that series four will include Sidney Bechet, Gerry Mulligan, Ornette Coleman, Anita O'Day, Lennie Tristano, Ben Webster, Billy Eckstine, and Miles Davis.\n\nback to list\n\nThe Best Jazz Videos in the World\n\nby Richare Gehr\n\nOctober 7, 2008\n\nThe Naxos recently released its third set of vintage European jazz performances and, once again, the first thing you'll probably notice about these cats - in this case Oscar Peterson, Bill Evans, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Lionel Hampton, Sonny Rollins, Cannonball Adderley, and Nina Simone - is that they dressed sharp.\n\nRecorded originally for television between 1958 and 1975, the ongoing series' third set consists of remastered and handsomedly packaged concerts and in-studio performances, mostly in elegant black and white, that have languished forgotten for nearly 50 years.\n\nThe fascinating time-machine quality of these DVDs is accentuated by the audiences. These consist mostly of earnest-looking Danish, Swedish, and Dutch listeners, who accorded American jazz a type of rapt respect we rarely see anymore. This was Serious Business for both musicians and audience, for the most part, and the latter's attention pays off in some of the most consistently fine jazz playing you may ever see and hear.\n\nWith the exception of vibraphonist Lionel Hampton's hour-long 1958 Belgium concert, each of the Jazz Icons DVDs contains between two and five separate performances. Pianist Bill Evans, for example, is captured on five occasions in Sweden, France, and Denmark. Both artist and music change over the years. The serious-looking, short-haired gentleman performing a beautifully spacious \"My Foolish Heart\" in coat and tie in 1964 develops into a shaggier, red-jacketed man still hunched over his piano, like a father fascinated by an infant in a crib, as he performs \"Up With the Lark\" with playful intensity in 1975.\n\nThe Jazz Icons series boasts a remarkable breadth of music. A world of imagination and experience separates relatively traditional pianist Oscar Peterson's intimate trio or Cannonball Adderley's searing bebop from Rahsaan Roland Kirk, the powerful, witty, and blind jazz visionary who sometimes blew three saxophones simultaneously. The only common denominator among these artists appears to be the consistent high quality of their playing.\n\nSinger-pianist Nina Simone is in a class by herself. Where the male instrumentalists reflect a sober dignity abroad, Simone was a brash Civil Rights activist whose politics were inseparable from her music (the recently released To Be Free: The Nina Simone Story provides a terrific overview of her remarkable and tumultuous career on three CDs and another DVD). An all-American maverick sensibility informs the passion and anger with which she sings the protest songs \"Mississippi Goddam\" and Bob Dylan's \"The Ballad of Hollis Brown\" in a 1965 Holland television appearance.\n\nThe seven latest Jazz Icons DVDs can either be purchased separately or together. I recommend the box, which contains an otherwise unavailable bonus disk containing 14 more tracks from Rollins, Kirk, and Simone. And remember liner notes? Every Jazz Icons package contains a 24-page booklet featuring a long essay, prefaced by a personal reminiscence by a friend or relative, providing context and insight into the artist in question's life in general and these performances in particular. And why not? Jazz has always meant many things to many audiences, and one of those things is \"American classical music\" - although I promise you that a typical Jazz Icons performance is a lot more fun to watch than your garden-variety classical-music video.\n\nback to list\n\nDVD: 'Jazz Icons: Series Three'\n\nby Jesse Hamlin\n\nFriday, October 24, 2008\n\nHighest Rating Possible\n\nThis is a smashing set of DVDs featuring never-released live and studio performances by seven singular artists: Sonny Rollins, Bill Evans, Nina Simone (left), Oscar Peterson, Cannonball Adderley, Lionel Hampton and Rahsaan Roland Kirk (a bonus disc for boxed-set buyers has other rare tracks by Rollins, Simone and Kirk). Taped for television in cities across Europe, these club and concert performances capture the musicians at peak moments in their careers. We see a shaved-headed Rollins blowing his tenor saxophone for a live crowd in Copenhagen in 1965, pouring out solos of sustained invention and energy on \"St. Thomas\" and \"Oleo.\" He plays with equal fervor during a Danish studio performance taped three years later. The Evans disc brings together five performances with various trios, filmed in Sweden, France and Denmark from 1964 to 1975. We see the lyrical pianist huddled over the keys as he shapes a beautifully introspective \"My Foolish Heart\" with bassist Chuck Israels and drummer Larry Bunker in Stockholm in '64, and swinging \"Someday My Prince Will Come\" in Copenhagen in 1970 with drummer Marty Morrell and bassist Eddie Gomez. Simone never sang more passionately than she did during the potent performances offered here: a 1965 Dutch concert at which she sings Dylan's \"The Ballad of Hollis Brown\" and her wrenching civil rights song \"Mississippi Goddam,\" and a 1968 broadcast on England's Granada TV featuring everything from Screamin' Jay Hawkins' \"I Put a Spell on You\" to \"Ain't Got No/I Got Life\" from the musical \"Hair.\" The Adderley and Kirk discs are full of bright moments as well. Each DVD comes with a booklet of fine essays, photographs and ephemera.\n\nback to list\n\nSeven Jazz Icons Hit the Screen\n\nRocks OFF by Bob Ruggiero\n\nTue Oct 07, 2008\n\nCompared to Deadheads, Beatles fans and the KISS Army, fans of classic '50s and '60s jazz are, admittedly, a small but extremely dedicated bunch. Somewhere out there is a middle-aged man (possibly with a beard) creaming his corduroys to discover tape of Miles Davis sneezing into the mike during a lost take of \"Freddie Freeloader,\" or grainy nightclub footage of Charlie Parker leaving the stage and disappearing into the bathroom while his band takes a long, long break.\n\nSo that's why jazz fans celebrate each release in the Jazz Icons DVD series as something akin to Harrison Ford planting his mud-caked mitts on the Lost Ark. The recently-released third series features individual releases by Sonny Rollins, Cannonball Adderley, Bill Evans, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Lionel Hampton, Oscar Peterson, Nina Simone and a bonus disc available only with the box set.\n\nEach DVD features several full concerts and appearances taken from European television, shot mostly during the 1960s but restored with incredible clarity of sight and sound. Each DVD also features an detailed booklet containing an insightful critical essay, photos of rare memorabilia, and a foreword often by the performers' widows and children.\n\nRocks Off recently spoke with David Peck, Phillip Galloway and Tom Gulotta of Jazz Icons producers Reelin' In the Years Productions in a four-way gang-bang phone call.\n\nRocks Off: The concerts and performances are all from European television and films. What do you think that says about the appreciation for American jazz and performers over there as compared to here? I can't imagine CBS giving an hour of airtime for an uninterrupted jazz concert in the mid-'60s.\n\nTom Gulotta: Well, look at the color of [the performers'] skin! That explains why they weren't on American TV. The Europeans were way ahead of us in appreciating the cultural contributions of jazz.\n\nDavid Peck: Also, European television had no commercials. Plus, these artists were treated like royalty when they went over there, and the music was respected. And not just jazz, but blues as well.\n\nRO: I was actually surprised at how amazingly clear the footage looks and sounds, given that it was recorded decades ago for what may have been a single broadcast. What was the restoration process like?\n\nDP: We make a point of going back to the original formats - film or video - and transferring it digitally. We also work with a [restorer] in England for sound. Look, we could put it through a George Lucas process and spend $300,000 to get every scratch and grain out if the footage, but that's not gonna happen. But we do everything in our power. And a lot of these [shows] were recorded on actual recording tape, and the mikes were placed very well.\n\nRO: On the Sonny Rollins disc, you have two shows several years apart both featuring his signature song \"St. Thomas,\" but sounding radically different. Does jazz - more than any other genre - allow the artist to change up their material like that?\n\nTG: Yes, definitely. The nature of jazz is the live performance, and for so many of these guys the thrill of changing a song and the improvisation was part of the art of jazz. On our Charles Mingus tape from a previous series, we had three shows in one week, and each one has \"So Long, Eric,\" but it's completely different each time. That's what makes jazz exciting. The audience may not appreciate it because they were seeing only one version, but for what the band is experiencing, it's amazing.\n\nRO: Another interesting DVD was the one with Rahsaan Roland Kirk. He's often dismissed by some jazz fans as an Uncle-Tomming blind freak whose claim to fame is playing three horns at once. But on the DVD, you really see his dexterity and skill in a way that just listening to a record can't deliver.\n\nPhillip Galloway: Absolutely. What comes out on the DVD is what a dynamo he was. And to watch the way he goes between two horns and they're all hanging from his neck, there's nothing circusey about it - it's pure genius. Just watch the sidemen try and keep up with him! With Kirk, there's a tornado effect just watching this high-speed genius.\n\nRO: And then there's the Nina Simone tape. I wasn't that familiar with her work, but was struck by the intensity of her songs, much of it concentrating on then-current political and racial subject material. And the way she almost acts out the lyrics. Her version of Bob Dylan's \"Ballad of Hollis Brown\" is way more foreboding and scary going to the murderous climax than his own.\n\nDP: As an African-American woman in 1965, all of what she was seeing and experiencing came out. All three of us here worship Dylan, but when she does it, you kind of forget he even wrote the song.\n\nPG: Dylan wrote it [based on the real-life story] of this poor, white hillbilly farmer who kills his family. When Nina does it, it has a whole different edge to it. When [music journalist] Rob Bowman sent over his liner notes for the DVD, he talked about Hollis Brown being a black man. But of course, he was white! Nina just made that song so much of her own, you couldn't see has as anything but black. Now that's a powerful singer!\n\nRO: Are you planning a fourth series?\n\nDP: Holy hell, yeah! There is so much footage all around the world. We're not done yet.\n\nRO: One last question. Have you ever gotten a cease-and-desist order from Steely Dan about the name of your company?\n\nDP (laughing): Ha! Well, I don't believe you can own the rights to a song title. Thankfully.\n\nback to list\n\nPLAYLIST\n\nFresh thoughts on new music\n\nBY MARK STRYKER * FREE PRESS MUSIC CRITIC * September 28, 2008\n\nIt's impossible to overstate how authoritative Sonny Rollins sounds on the 1965 Copenhagen concert included in the new DVD \"Sonny Rollins: Live in '65 and '68\" (FOUR STARS out of four stars, Jazz Icons). Here is one of the great improvisers in jazz history at age 35 and at the peak of his powers, discovering the Joycean stream-of-consciousness style of his later work, yet still in touch with bebop conventions. Past, present and future dissolve into solos beyond time and category.\n\nPut simply: The sustained euphoria of Rollins' inventions belongs in the top tier of jazz ever captured on film.\n\nIn stores Tuesday, the DVD is among the new releases in the Jazz Icons series, which now includes 23 titles drawn from rare European television and concert footage, restored to pristine black-and-white stock with first-rate sound. Past gems included DVDs devoted to Dexter Gordon, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus and Wes Montgomery. The new titles include those devoted to Cannonball Adderley, Bill Evans, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Oscar Peterson, Lionel Hampton and Nina Simone.\n\nThe Rollins disc includes two Danish television programs, the 55-minute Copenhagen concert with Danish bassist Niels-Henning Ørsted Pederson and drummer Alan Dawson, and a 25-minute studio performance in 1968 with pianist Kenny Drew, Pederson and drummer Tootie Heath.\n\nRollins, dressed sharply in a turtleneck, sport coat and pocket square, stalks the stage in 1965, swinging his horn like a dance partner. He warms up with \"There Will Never Be Another You,\" followed by an increasingly inspired version of his famous calypso \"St. Thomas\" that slides into high gear when the rhythm shifts into swing and Rollins tears into a second solo. Then things get really interesting.\n\nThe next 35 minutes segue from one tune to the next, starting with a snippet of \"I Can't Get Started,\" followed by an extended \"Oleo\" at a fast bebop tempo, which downshifts abruptly into the blues \"Sonnymoon For Two,\" which closes with Rollins cleverly harkening back to \"Oleo.\" A quick wink again at \"I Can't Get Started\" morphs into a short reading of \"Darn That Dream,\" which gives way to a vibrant Rollins solo cadenza and a trio romp through \"Three Little Words.\"\n\nWow.\n\nPlaying with a vocalized sound as sturdy as steel, Rollins invents vast cathedrals of thematic ideas filled with melodic and rhythmic rhyme, wit and surprise. He generates tremendous momentum, attacking each line with a variety of articulation and color -- some notes pop, others smear and splinter. The stunning command of rhythm and time -- note the way some phrases float between single and double time -- suggest total freedom within form. There's nice interplay with the 19-year-old Pederson and Dawson, who lay down a strong beat and solo impressively.\n\nThe 1968 performance is not as inspired, though there are nice moments. And it's interesting to hear Rollins team with Drew, with whom he played in a neighborhood band as a kid. But Rollins also sounds a bit disconnected. It's not surprising that soon after this taping, he would embark on a second sabbatical from performing that would last until 1971. His sound and style would shift again upon his return.\n\nback to list\n\nThere is a good reason that each Jazz Icon DVD begins with a choral \"Hallelujah.\" Every fan should praise God for His gift, since every good thing comes from above. This music includes stuff that is a hint of heaven, and will be a pleasure for jazz fans everywhere, both musically and visually.\n\nCannonball Adderley is caught in two 63 gigs in Switzerland and Germany, respectively, with what was arguably his best band, including brother Nat (cornet), Yusef Lateef (reeds), a cephalically hirsuit Joe Zawinul (piano), Sam Jones (bass) and Louis Hayes (drums). The band cooks like Wolfgang Puck on burners like \"Jive Samba\" and \"Unit 7\". Adderley nonchalantly sprays out a myriad of licks, while a very cool and dapper Lateef switches between full bodied tenor, exotic oboe and\n\nethereal flute on \"Jessica's Day,\" \"Trouble In Mind\", and \"Angel Eyes\" respectively. The rhythm section snaps like a campfire, with deep incessantly stronger grooves on each chorus of tunes like \"Bohemia After Dark.\" Absolutely joyous music.\n\nWhile Adderley is captured during one peak year, pianist Bill Evans is represented over a period of just under a decade, in various configurations. 1964 finds him with one of his best trios, featuring Chuck Israels/b and Larry Bunker/d for a pair of intimate readings, of which \"My Foolish Heart\" is jarring in beauty. 1965 has Evans with Alan Dawson/d, Niels Henning Orsted-Pederson/b and Lee Konitz guesting on alto for a fittingly dry \"Melancholy Baby.\" By 1970, Evans is starting to show a bit of wear and tear during his Denmark and Swedish gigs with Eddie Gomez/b and Marty Morrell/d. The music, as Evans slowly started his downhill slide, got more and more emotive, with tunes like \"Emily\" and \"Re: A Person I Knew\" filled with glorious moments. The closing 1975 gig in Denmark is right about the same time as Evans' classic meeting with Tony Bennett, with the infamous cover photo. On this evening, Evans while he appears highly mortal, he and his band of Gomez and Eliot Zigmund/dr, still give emotive treatments of \"But Beautiful\" and and energetic \"\"Up With The Lark.\" This is music at it's most vulnerable, and fascinating to observe.\n\nOn the completely opposite side of the temperament spectrum, Lionel Hampton leads a swinging and loose 1958 band during a fun concert in Belgium. In fact, they're SO loose, you've got to wonder why bassist Julius Browne is wearing sunglasses during the gig. Some scuffle between sets with someone? No big named sidemen, but the guys do their job, with tenorist Andy McGee sounding very hip during his solo on \"Hot Club Blues.\" Hampton and company go through a clever \"history of jazz\" by featuring music from each evolving style, with \"Hamps Piano Blues\" a boogie woogie delight. The sprinting \"The Chase\" shows how the band\n\ncould deliver the goods, with a no holds barred two trumpet battle between Eddie Williams and Art Hoyle. Lots of good vibes all around.\n\nRahsaan Roland Kirk benefits most from having his music presented on DVD. Playing two or three instruments at a time, or altering between self-created horns in the middle of a solo demands seeing to be believed. It's just amazing how he could master so many instruments, and at the same time, without it appearing gimmicky. The two 63 concerts (from Belgium and Holland) find a very cool looking Kirk and band (George Gruntz/p, Guy Pedersen/b and Daniel Humair/d) crackling through bop tunes like \"Milestones\" adn \"Bags' Groove\". With right hand on manzello, and left on tenor, Kirk veers through \"Lover\" like there's no tomorrow. The stop-start timing on \"Three For The Festival\", featuring Kirk on three horns simultaneously, must be seen over and over to be believed. The 67 show in Norway includes Ron Burton/p, NHOP/b and Alex Riel/d digging deep grooves over tunes like \"The Shadow Of Your Smile.\" His tenor work during \"Blue Rol\" shows that he was highly underrated at playing one instrument at a time. You'll check this one out many times over.\n\nThe Oscar Peterson Trio was the toast of the world when these gigs were performed in Sweden, Denmark, and Finland, respectively. Ray Brown/b and Ed Thigpen/p tear through ebullient versions of \"Reunion Blues\", \"On Green Dolphin Street\" and \"Chicago\" with Peterson as they set the standard for the piano trio. Trumpeter Roy Eldridge joins the trio in Sweden for a tightly muted \"But Not For Me\" that builds in intensity for four fierce choruses. Clark Terry brings a whole different mood to Finland, as he waxes elegance on \"Misty\" before bringing the house down with a hilariously classic \"Mumbles\" that deserves it's status as one of the high points of vocal jazz. Why do these guys make it seem so easy?\n\nCaught in Denmark/65 and 68 when Sonny Rollins was, well, SONNY ROLLINS, the tenorist looks, sounds and plays like a guy who is the Saxophone Colossus. With his head shaved and a sporting a groovy beard, Rollins does the trio format with NHOP/b and Alan Dawson/d in 65 for some room filling playing on \"There Will Never Be Another You\" and \"Darn That Dream\". The band glides like Katerina Witt on \"Oleo/Sonnymoon for Two\" as Rollins, with ever cool demeanor, tears of\n\nthe layers of the piece like pealing an onion. The 68 quartet includes pianist Kenny Drew and drummer Tootie Heath along with NHOP and a bereted Rollins for a thunderous \"Green Dolphin Street\". Rollins' a capella intro, and 90 second closing cadenza, are simply heart stopping. Heath is having a good time during this set, humming along \"St. Thomas\" as he snaps, crackles and pops through the tune. Classic period of a classic tenor.\n\nPianist/singer/activist Nina Simone visibly demonstrates the a-changes that occurred during the tumultuous 60s. Her 65 Holland set has Ms. Simone in elegant European-style attire as she delivers chilling versions of songs like \"Four Women\" and \"Brown Baby\". By 1968, she had become a symbol of the Black Power movement, and is dressed in more African attire during her harrowing treatments of \"I Put A Spell On You\" and the forewarning \"Go To Hell.\" The only problem with watching this lady during the two shows is that she has a perpetual sour puss on her face. Does music always have to exhibit anger?\n\nBy George W. Harris\n\nback to list\n\nJAZZ ICONS Series 3 (Naxos) — For the third time the folks at Reelin’ in the Years Productions have dug into the archives of European and Scandinavian television networks and come up with pure gold. The seven new DVDs in this marvelous collection feature Lionel Hampton, Sonny Rollins, Cannonball Adderley, Bill Evans, Nina Simone, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, and Oscar Peterson, with a bonus disc in the boxed set including additional performances by Rollins, Kirk and Simone.\n\nDrawn from live concerts and television specials, these DVDs give us intimate and immediate portraits of iconic jazz figures at the peak of their powers. The Bill Evans set includes broadcasts from 1964 in Sweden, 1965 in France, 1970 in Denmark and Sweden, and 1975 in Denmark, enabling us to see how the iconoclastic pianist changed both physically and musically over a decade’s time. (I’ve never seen another pianist hunch over his keyboard and turn his head as Evans does, as if to put his ear as close to the notes as possible.) Like all of the discs, this one is accompanied by a handsome booklet with rare photos, memorabilia, and well-written liner notes (by such knowledgeable jazz chroniclers as Doug Ramsey, John McDonough and Ira Gitler)...but the pièce de resistance is a poignant recollection of Evans written by his daughter.\n\nThe Lionel Hampton set is a typical barn-burner, although it opens on a surprising note as Hamp performs a four-mallet featured solo on Dimitri Tiomkin’s theme from The High and the Mighty. This beautiful ballad, with a double-tempo reprise, is worth the price of admission alone. (There’s also a lively reminiscence in the booklet by Quincy Jones, who got his start playing trumpet in Hampton’s band.)\n\nI’m especially fond of the Oscar Peterson set, drawn from three performances in 1963, 1964 and 1965 when Peterson was in perfect synch with bass player Ray Brown and drummer Ed Thigpen. The opening set is a bit perfunctory and the numbers abbreviated, but the second set is sublime, with a lengthy rendition of Ellington’s “C-Jam Blues” that’s just about as good as it gets. In the final segment the trio is joined by trumpeter Clark Terry for more great music. (I love the way Peterson and company back him up.)\n\nIf you’re new to this series I encourage you to check out the previous volumes as well. No effort has been spared in their production, and what’s more, the producers have involved the musicians’ heirs and estates. They’re even paying the sidemen who are still alive.\n\nback to list\n\nMasters' performances preserved in \"Jazz Icons\" DVDs\n\nBy Bret Saunders\n\nOctober 31, 2008\n\nI've found a respite from election-season anxiety in the form of black-and-white European telecasts from the '50s and '60s. The latest wave of \"Jazz Icons\" DVDs focuses on distinctive bandleaders and soloists, and they're packed with revelations and comfort in the knowledge that these giants have been preserved on film.\n\nThe sets from vibraphonist Lionel Hampton, saxophonist Cannonball Adderley and pianists Oscar Peterson and Bill Evans are all worthwhile for capturing these artists in their prime, the 1963 Adderley performances especially notable for the inclusion of woodwind ace Yusef Lateef as the sixth member of the group. If you spring around $100 for the whole box (the seven DVDs are also available separately), there's a \"bonus disc\" with footage from the following three artists in this year's \"Icons\" collection, all of whom get some well-deserved acknowledgement.\n\n\"Rahsaan Roland Kirk Live in '63 and '67\" is an unearthed treasure, and not just because there isn't all that much commercially available footage of the man who played three saxophones simultaneously and made it seem normal. Though Kirk was better known in the '70s, the '60s represent his rowdy creative peak, madly wailing away on tenor sax as well as the stritch and manzello, often simultaneously and with jaw-dropping dexterity. He plays his own tunes from the vital Mercury Records period, including a lighthearted \"Moon Song\" and a couple of frenzied takes of his signature \"Three For The Festival.\"\n\nThere hasn't been anyone remotely like him, and for those who wondered how he did it all, here's an ecstatic demonstration. As pianist Ramsey Lewis is quoted in the sets' notes, \"It blew your mind but at the same time it reached your heart.\"\n\nMore laid back but just as distinctive is the Nina Simone contribution, \"Live in '65 and '68\" (OK, the DVD titles aren't as stirring as the music). The small studio crowds in Holland and England (where half of the audience resembles members of The Velvet Underground) are entranced with Simone's unusual vocal inflections and deadpan piano accompaniment. Her interpretations of songs from The Animals and Bob Dylan are even more memorable in this visual incarnation because of her solemn intensity.\n\nSonny Rollins, on the other hand, projects genius exhibitionism on \"Live in '65 and '68.\" An unstoppable improvising force, it's a gift to watch and hear the connection from his brain to his tenor sax, especially from a period of his career that isn't well documented on record (he was rarely heard between 1967 and 1972).\n\nWith these performances as evidence, he was playing brilliantly at this time, even if he stuck with familiar themes. Even more remarkable is another new Rollins DVD, \"In Vienne\" (Doxy) where the great man expounds naturally on themes in 2006, nearly 40 years after the Denmark inventions that make up the second half of the \"Jazz Icons\" release. Is Rollins superhuman? What does he eat? And where can I get some?\n\nback to list\n\nCannonball Adderley, Sonny Rollins & Oscar Peterson\n\nTHREE ICONS IN A FEAST OF SIGHT AND SOUND\n\nBy Eric Kamm | TRAPS\n\nI’m going to cut right to the chase. All expectations are met on these three latest vintage performance releases from the incomparable Jazz Icons series. Yes, two versions of “St. Thomas” appear on the Sonny Rollins- Live In ’65 & ’68 DVD. Yes, Cannonball Live In ’63 features both “Work Song” and two versions of “Jive Samba,” where the infamous alto player performs next to his brother, Nat. And yes, drummer Ed Thigpen and bassist Ray Brown accompany Oscar Peterson on Live In ’63, ’64 & ’65.\n\nYou’ll find a young Alan Dawson and virtuosic bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pederson backing up Sonny Rollins in Denmark. In 2001 I asked studio great John Robinson what he learned from studying with Dawson at Berklee College Of Music. “Sing the melody while you’re playing,” he responded. You’ll understand what Dawson meant when he takes fours and an extended solo on “There Will Never Be Another You.” His effortless chops form beautiful, creatively phrased melodies on the drums. After watching this video, you’ll understand why guys like Tony Williams and Billy Kilson studied with Dawson in Boston as well.\n\nIn Sonny Rollins’ 1968 performance, Albert “Tootie” Heath is behind the drums, with Kenny Drew on piano. Several years ago, I caught Tootie playing with his two brothers, saxophonist Jimmy and bassist Percy. The drummer was playing the swing beat in a very flattened, samba-like triplet pattern, almost like a cascara rhythm. It was interesting to see that his right hand swung more conventionally back in 1968. His drums are tuned high like Roy Haynes, and he takes some risky fours. Sometimes you think he’s lost the 1 in a fill, but he’s always right there when Sonny hits the downbeat. The band bridges the tunes “St. Thomas” and “Four” in this burning performance.\n\nThere’s joy to any note an Adderley brother plays. When Cannonball isn’t blowing his alto, he’s snapping his fingers and dancing around on stage. All of his groups have an uncanny grasp of both the music they’re playing and the musicians surrounding them, which in these two sets include multi-instrumentalist Yusef Lateef, pianist Joe Zawinul, and drummer Louis Hayes.\n\nHayes knows how to make a single note count better than any other drummer. Where many players need a full bar for certain transitions, Hayes only needs a single cross stick on the snare. This is not to suggest that he doesn’t have an arsenal of chops at the ready – you don’t know what hit you when he takes his solo on “Bohemia After Dark” – it’s just that his real talent lies in the soulful manner in which he swings a band.\n\nI had always assumed that Ed Thigpen gradually worked his way up to becoming a brush master, but apparently he was born with the gift. The second you press play on the Oscar Peterson DVD, you’re hit with a ridiculous “Reunion Blues” pocket supplied by bassist Ray Brown and said drummer, wires in hand. The group grooves together, crescendos together, and completes each other’s sentences. Trumpeters Clark Terry and Roy Eldridge join them at different performances.\n\nThe film and audio quality of these DVDs is tiptop. The Jazz Icons series has helped fill a void in the music industry, where previously there has been a conspicuous dearth of restored footage from the heyday of jazz. These performances should be required viewing for all serious music students.\n\nback to list\n\nJAZZ VIEWS\n\n\"Jazz Icons: Series 3\"\n\nSonny Rollins, Nina Simone, others\n\n(Reelin' in the Years)\n\nThe third series of Jazz Icons DVDs presents another batch of jazz greats filmed between 1958-1975 for European and Scandinavian television in a straight forward, black and white style. The music, not the camera work, is the star, and the sounds are riveting. Tenorman Rollins' is at a creative peak in performances of \"Oleo,\" \"St. Thomas,\" others, from 1965 and 1968. Singer and pianist Simone delivers vivid renditions of \"I Put a Spell on You,\" more, from 1965 and 1968. Multi-reedman Rahsaan Roland Kirk displays his phenomenal, three-horns-at-once art on \"Three for the Festival,\" others, shot in 1963 and 1967. Other ace DVDs spotlight altoist Cannonball Adderley's magnificent 1963 sextet with Yusef Lateef and Joe Zawinul; pianist Oscar Peterson's A-1 trio Ray Brown and Ed Thigpen; and the evolution of piano giant Bill Evans in performances from 1964 to 1975.

There are real pearls here. For that and other reasons, the series should be required viewing for anyone who came away from Ken Burns' PBS documentary thinking jazz was strictly for the starched-shirt set.\n\nProduced by the same folks behind the landmark \"American Folk Blues Festival 1962-1969\" releases, the Jazz Icons DVDs are comprised of rare, pristinely restored, black-and-white concert footage, primarily from the 1960s, of legendary American artists on European stages. It would be hard to overstate the project's overall excellence, from artist selection to sonic quality. Frequent shots of enthralled club and TV audiences suggest these musicians commanded tremendous respect - certainly more than most of them were receiving at the time in the civil rights-riled US, as the detailed booklets accompanying each DVD make clear.\n\nThe Series 3 package includes seven DVDs of performances by Cannonball Adderley, Bill Evans, Lionel Hampton, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Oscar Peterson, Sonny Rollins and Nina Simone, plus a bonus disc of previously unseen footage of Kirk, Rollins and Simone.\n\nSome may quibble that this series' legends are lighter-weight than those in Series 1 and 2, which presented Louis Armstrong, Chet Baker, Count Basie, Art Blakey & the Jazz Messengers, Dave Brubeck, John Coltrane, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Dexter Gordon, Quincy Jones, Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk, Wes Montgomery, Buddy Rich and Sarah Vaughan. But, with the exception of Hampton, who launched his storied career in the 1920s and achieved lasting fame with Benny Goodman in the '30s, it's more the case that Series 3 presents later generations and directions in jazz.\n\nThe Hampton footage is the most formal in some ways, with the exuberant vibraphonist fronting his orchestra (including on-fire guitarist Billy Mackel) on a no-frills stage for a clearly entertained audience. Filmed in Belgium in 1958, it proves the globetrotting jazz ambassador was a showman and bandleader par excellence. Despite some awkward cuts, the music soars.\n\nThe most revelatory discs are those featuring pianist Bill Evans and über-diva Simone - Evans because the five performances from 1964 through 1975 chronicle his compositional genius and sensitivity as well as the sad erosion of his abilities, and Simone because of her dramatic intensity. All of Evans' performances are stellar, but the first two achieve moments of transcendent grace. \"My Foolish Heart\" and \"Israel,\" filmed with bassist Chuck Israels and drummer Larry Bunker in Sweden in 1964, are stirring testaments to jazz's poetic possibilities.\n\nSimone, the only vocalist in Series 3, would likely have argued against her inclusion, as she insisted her hard-to-classify music contained more folk, blues and classical than jazz elements - an assertion borne out by these performances from Holland and England in 1965 and '68. Nonetheless, they present some breathtaking expressions of Simone's artistry and political awakening, most notably her sarcastic rendering of \"Four Women,\" the majestically angry \"Mississippi Goddam,\" and the harrowing \"Brown Baby\" and \"Why? (The King of Love is Dead).\"\n\nThe liveliest and most lighthearted performances are those by alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley with his world-class sextet, which included brother Nat on cornet, pre-Weather Report pianist Joe Zawinul, melody-parsing bassist Sam Jones, drummer Louis Hayes and Yusef Lateef, who stuns with his dexterity and sweet, pure tone on sax, flute and oboe. Visually, the Adderley footage is less crisp, but the music is positively joyful.\n\nThe Oscar Peterson footage is even more dynamic. The Canadian giant could swing with the best, but some of the most memorable moments occur in a smoky Denmark club in 1964 when a sweat-drenched Peterson, drummer Ed Thigpen and incomparable bassist Ray Brown play with heads bowed, united in prayerful concentration as they explore the subtleties of Milt Jackson's \"Bags' Groove,\" the jazz standard \"On Dolphin Street\" and Peterson's meaningful \"Hymn to Freedom.\"\n\nPeterson's dizzying flights up and down the grand piano keys are simply astounding.\n\nIn contrast, the Sonny Rollins and Rahsaan Roland Kirk discs are more cerebrally demanding. Kirk later forayed into the avant-garde, but he was most innovative in his proclivity for introducing new sounds and for playing three horns at once. His fiery performances from Belgium, Holland and Norway in 1963 and '67 are the least melodic and the most modern in the series.\n\nRollins' highly evolved, intellectual playing demonstrates why he was the only saxophonist to be seriously considered Coltrane's equal, and rivals Evans' early performances in compositional depth.\n\nRollins exhibits a similar degree of poetic absorption during his intricately constructed solos on signature tunes like \"St. Thomas,\" and even when listening to the rhythmically complex contributions of bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen and drummer Alan Dawson (a peerless rhythm section).\n\nRollins' daunting improvisations, concentration and consummate artistry testify to the enduring value of this series - and not just for jazz fans.

Rollins was swinging, creating and playing with both fury and precision, while Drew not only crafted surprising and sometimes humorous accompanying sections, but also added his own nimble explorations and solos.\n\nBoth shows were wonderful, though the 1965 in my view proves just a bit more musically combative and challenging. But both mark a period in Sonny Rollins' peak years, the time when his robust solos and fiery performances inspired not only numerous fans, but plenty of musicians as well.\n\nCannonball Adderley was finding a profitable middle ground during this same time between soulful pieces and ambitious ones, and his early '60s sextet that included his brother Nat on cornet and Yusef Lateef on tenor (and several other instruments) was perhaps his finest band. Cannonball Adderley depicts two concerts recorded two days apart in Switzerland and Germany in 1963.\n\nThese numbers are among the hardest and most furious bop and blues ones Lateef ever made, and things were sparked even more by the spry and funky piano contributions of Joe Zawinul. They also show how underrated Nat Adderely was as both a frontline contributor and individual player.\n\nNina Simone catches the legendary and fiery performer during two '60s concerts that thankfully weren't marred by any technical glitches, audience misbehavior or any of the other things that occasionally could cause Simone to become just a bit hostile.\n\nIt does include stirring renditions of everything from rock to blues, Broadway to jazz, and also presents Simone doing a wonderful rendition of \"The Ballad of Hollis Brown,\" a Dylan cover that hasn't received nearly as much acclaim as some other rock and folk covers she's done.\n\nThis edition is magical.\n\nOscar Peterson's speed, facility and flair could be scary, especially for anyone who's ever dabbled on piano. Yet Peterson's bombastic personality and incredible technical prowess sometimes generated as much disdain as praise, with some critics claiming he lacked swing and substituted flash for soul.\n\nThat was never something that seemed accurate to my ears, and there's no shortage of energy, imagination or authority on Oscar Peterson, a DVD that links three Peterson shows from 63-65.\n\nA special treat comes in watching his great trio that also included bassist Ray Brown and drummer Ed Thigpen. Whether this was the greatest trio of all time will always be debated, but there certainly weren't many in their class.\n\nA pair of trumpet giants, Roy Eldridge and Clark Terry, also participate on some cuts, though it's Oscar Peterson's mastery on the piano that's the shining light here.\n\nAnother pianist with a dramatically different approach was Bill Evans. While Evans certainly possessed as much technical brilliance, it was his shimmering ballads and melodic might that made him so influential.\n\nThis set has five Evans performances done over a 10-year stretch from 1965-1975. Over that time there were occasional variations in mood, selections and pace, but never any letdown in Evans' interpretative qualities or style. Among the numerous players whose work greatly reflects Evans' impact, you can clearly hear lots of Keith Jarrett and Herbie Hancock in different sections of the cuts on Bill Evans.\n\nRahsaan Roland Kirk was not only a terrific player, he was a wonderful showman and insightful, funny individual. His shows mixed powerhouse musical pieces with biting commentaries on multiple subjects. The personality aspect isn't quite as evident as the multi-instrumentalist side on Rahsaan Roland Kirk, but the music more than balances things out.\n\nThere are many examples of his cycle breathing technique (holding notes for impossibly long stretches) and his ability to play three or more horns at once, sometimes executing different things on them at the same time. While he was unquestionably a great tenor soloist and an inventive type who created many unusual instruments, this DVD also shows what a wonderful clarinet player Kirk could be when he chose to play that instrument.\n\nFinally, there's a good Lionel Hampton set from 1958, which suffers only by comparison to some of these other dates. Hampton was as enthusiastic and personable as ever, and also displays his skill on drums and piano as well as vibes. His band's also a good unit, and the Belgian audience clearly enjoyed it. But having seen Hampton on many other occasions, this set isn't one of his greatest, though it's still quite good.\n\nThis series also has a bonus DVD that has different (but no less valuable) performances from Rollins, Kirk and Simone, though in shorter, less concentrated fashion. Each set also includes glorious photos, memorabilia and extensive notes from various critics, historians and jazz scholars.\n\nback to list\n\nDVD reviews: Sonny Rollins; Rahsaan Roland Kirk\n\nWords About Music From Greg Burk & Friends\n\nSonny Rollins, \"Live in '65 & '68\" (Jazz Icons)\n\nAshley Kahn's notes about Sonny Rollins quote the tenor saxist as saying he can't think and play at the same time. Rollins must have had his own definition of thinking. Look at his face at age 35 as he works -- a privilege we have rarely enjoyed till this Jazz Icons DVD came out. With his shaved head and contained demeanor, Rollins could make you flash on Kobe Bryant, and maybe Rollins does embody something of the athlete; the weaving physicality of his improvisations recalls the thousand minute coordinations of legs, arms, fingers and eyes Bryant executes when he drives to the hoop. Is Bryant thinking? Yes; he's just not 100 percent conscious of it. Maybe what he does is art, too.\n\nRollins in 1965 has reached his pinnacle, and it's impossible to blow any better. Having toned down the extreme avantisms he broached with Billy Higgins and Don Cherry a few years earlier, Rollins has added split tones and gushes of Coltrane hyperspeed to his arsenal, but only as accents to augment the total mastery he achieved with his 1957 \"A Night at the Village Vanguard\" trio recordings. He's got the sudden inspired extrapolations on the melody, the elastic expansions and contractions of rhythm, the cunnilingual shapings of note contour and tone. And he succeeds in making you imagine that he's actually not thinking; that it's all just pouring out of him. Well, that might've been sometimes true of even the best saxists, a Parker or a Gonsalves. Not this guy, though. Every measure is a composition.\n\nThe material doesn't stray from the reliable Rollins book: a tour de force \"There Will Never Be Another You,\" a playfully arrogant \"St. Thomas,\" a freeform blowout on \"Oleo\"/\"Sonnymoon for Two,\" a quick \"Darn That Dream\" preceding the stand-alone schema that sets up his tribute to Lester Young, \"Three Little Words.\" Boston drummer Alan Dawson, though little known, swings like a well-oiled gate. And here's Danish bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen, who would eventually play with just about everybody, at 19. Try to fault his quickness, intervallic technique or drive; you can't.\n\nRollins returns to Copenhagen TV for the briefer 1968 portion of this DVD, which ranks slightly below the '65 performance for a number of reasons. The addition of Kenny Drew is superfluous; good as the pianist always was, his light fluidity distracts. No problem with the creative Tootie Heath on drums or with Pedersen, who returns radiating still more understated confidence to exact punishment upon the big new watch on his left wrist, but Rollins himself has slipped a fraction. Though his ideas continue to flow, as they do to this day, his long tones have begun to quaver, his \"St. Thomas\" is sluggish, and under his beret and beard, he looks tired. The death of his friend John Coltrane the year before let a lot of air out of the jazz balloon; for Rollins, it must have been like losing a twin.\n\nNo question, this DVD is a huge gain for jazz fans. Some young musicians will watch it and give up. The strongest, though, will see it as a challenge. This, folks, is what you're shooting for.\n\nRahsaan Roland Kirk, \"Live in '63 and '67\" (Jazz Icons)\n\nEvery new exposure to Roland Kirk adds to the multiwindman's historic stature. The guy was an incarnation of the life force, and when you see him with several instruments hanging from his big body or tucked under his arm, they assume properties of octopus limbs, not metal tools. His long absence from the scene (he died in 1977 at the age of 41) makes this DVD drawn from Belgian, Dutch and Norwegian TV a special prize.\n\nThe durable European musicians who backed Kirk in '64 include pianist George Gruntz and drummer Daniel Humair; bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen pops in for the '67 date. But they're nearly invisible behind Kirk's gale-force assault as he huffs up to three horns at once or locates the meatiest tones on tenor and flute, on both of which his dominance was undisputed. Whether holding one note indefinitely via circular breathing, ripping deep blues out of the prissy clarinet or running roughshod over \"The Shadow of Your Smile,\" Kirk boggles the eyes and ears; makes you wonder what this blind prophet would've thought if he could have seen himself.\n\nThe 1967 segment is especially fun to watch, as a frenzied Kirk wanders off mike with his manzello, bangs into the microphone with his tenor and topples his stritch stand (which he deftly catches before it falls). A cramped soundstage just couldn't contain this man. And a DVD hardly can either -- sweat and steam virtually pour from the thing. Grab it.\n\nIn addition to the Rollins and the Kirk, the third slate of Jazz Icons releases spans DVDs by Cannonball Adderley, Nina Simone, Bill Evans, Lionel Hampton and Oscar Peterson. And the eight-disc box ($96 from Amazon) includes a bonus DVD featuring Rollins in 1959.\n\nback to list\n\nOctober 2, 2008\n\nRoland Kirk: Bright Moments\n\nThere is probably no more intimidating a figure in jazz than Main Rahsaan Roland Kirk. If you don't know much about jazz or are unfamiliar with Kirk's music, images of the artist in sunglasses with four or five different saxophones around his neck or in his mouth probably have led you to only one conclusion: Here is someone who plays wild, noisy music that will be tough to deal with unless free jazz is your bag.\n\nActually, nothing could be further from the truth. Kirk was an extraordinary talent who loved melody, was fascinated by sound and harmony, and remains Rahsaan_rolandkirk along with Wayne Shorter one of the most interesting saxophonist-composers of the 1960s. His works include Bright Moments, Serenade to a Cuckoo, The Inflated Tear, Spirits Up Above and A Handful of Fives.\n\nAnd if seeing is believing, Rahsaan Roland Kirk: Live in '63 and '67, the new DVD just released by Jazz Icons as part of its third series of concert videos, makes Kirk's importance crystal clear. The video shows off all facets of Kirk's gentle genius and will leave your mouth hanging open. Here you'll see Kirk as one-man quintet in action. He switches from one sax to another to produce different textures or plays three at once to extract harmonies as rich as a big band reed section. (To see a video clip, go here and click on \"watch preview.\")\n\nYou also see in this DVD how sensitive Kirk was as an artist and musical storyteller. I think he actually enjoyed his intimidating image, in that it kept away the jazz fakers, leaving only purists who truly understood his message and appreciated his many talents.\n\nBlind from age 2, Kirk was born in 1936 and played trumpet before devoting himself to the clarinet and C-melody saxophone. By age 15, he was playing in an r&b band, developing blues chops that would later come in handy with artists such as Brother Jack McDuff. Kirk's passion for reeds led him to make alterations to instruments with rubber bands and to modify the keys so he could play multiple saxophones at once. He also was a gifted flutist.\n\nKirk chose to wear a pawnshop's worth of saxophones around his neck not as a some bohemian style thing. There was a more pragmatic reason. He simply loved the different sounds they made individually and together and couldn't see them if they were sitting in stands. Their vibrations on his chest also helped him feel his way through to his art. By 1960, Kirk even added a metal hunting horn to emphasize climactic points in pieces. In 1963, Kirk adapted a circular breathing technique that let him play continuously.\n\nHis first recording Triple Threat was in 1956 for King Records. In 1961, he spent three months with Charles Mingus, but after that short stint, Kirk went on to lead groups in concerts and on recording dates for the rest of his career, until his death in December 1977.\n\nOver the years, Kirk's music has managed to slip into semi-obscurity. Long mischaracterized as a far-out player (mostly by those who hadn't heard his music), Kirk was and remains a significant improviser who had a huge soul and beautiful tone. As Sonny Rollins and Pharoah Sanders pointed out, Kirk was better with one hand than most saxophonists were with two.\n\nThe Jazz Icons DVD features Kirk playing on three live dates in Belgium (1963), Holland (1963) and Norway (1967). Each song is a wonderful example of an honest artist robbed of sight who finds his way to a song's heart and shares its beauty along the way. Three highlights for me on this video are Milestones, Bags' Groove and The Shadow of Your Smile.\n\nOn Milestones, Kirk plays three saxophones and creates almost the same sound as the Miles Davis Sextet's recording of the song. Bags' Groove demonstrates Kirk's ability on the soprano sax while The Shadow of Your Smile shows you what Kirk could do with a pop tune. All are spirited and fabulous.\n\nKirk was all about jazz ideas and vibrations. You just have to open yourself up a bit to grasp his art and message.\n\nJazzWax tracks: Many jazz fans are unfamiliar with Rahsaan Roland Kirk. To put you at ease, let me first let you in on a funny secret: He's playing stritch and alto sax on Quincy Jones' Soul Bossa Nova. That's the quirky song that the Austin Powers movies used as its theme song.\n\nback to list\n\nJazz Icons DVD's - Series 3 Box\n\nYear: 2008\n\nReview: No doubt you're aware of the remarkable-and growing-DVD collections of, yes, iconic jazz artists playing in Europe during their prime years. Two sets of Jazz Icons DVD's already are available for viewership and ownership, and they have become major events in the documentation of jazz. Indeed, at a time when it seems that new performances by some of the innovators of the language of jazz has been exhausted, along comes Reelin' in the Years Productions to release even more. It wasn't easy. Ingeniously, Reelin' in the Years, which possesses the world's largest library of music videos, realized that Europeans had filmed an abundance of jazz performances when American jazz artists performed there. Only now have these videos been released, and they offer some astounding discoveries. Even Ken Burns Jazz relied mostly on existing footage and photographs instead of uncovering new material. Jazz Icons' videos bring to life various jazz artists in their prime at a time when a new generation of jazz enthusiasts are discovering and admiring their work. JazzTimes, for instance, ran a cover article about Rahsaan Roland Kirk at a time when he is receiving fresh consideration for his musicality, rather than his famous instrumental innovations. In fact, some jazz musicians like Jane Bunnett, Larry Coryell and Steve Turre had admired Kirk's recordings all along before his rediscovery was underway.\n\nThe three-so-far Jazz Icons series include videos of performances by musicians too numerous to mention for the interests of concision within this review. Just a few of the featured musicians of previous Jazz Icons packages include John Coltrane, Louis Armstrong, Thelonious Monk, Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus, captured on tape when European broadcasters recorded them. In many cases, these priceless tapes were stashed away and forgotten for decades. Fortunately, the resources finally have been assembled to deliver not only collectively some extended and important videos packages of groundbreaking jazz musicians, but also individually opportunities to experience the feeling of one of their live performances.\n\nThe most recent release consists of seven DVD's, each at least an hour in length, of artists performing in various European venues centered around the 1960's, when social protests started to increase and before fusion changed the nature of jazz. This third series actually covers a range of jazz extant at that time, rather than focusing on a single style, and for that reason the Naxos and Reelin' in the Years producers deserve much credit. For the box set ranges from the unclassifiable style of Nina Simone, who was true to herself rather than to a category, to the continuing joyousness of Oscar Peterson's music to a throwback to the 1940's with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra. These producers show, through the results that they offer and through their lavish documentation, open-mindeness and a strong devotion to the music. Each DVD package includes a tribute from someone close to the artist, such as Bill Evans' daughter, as well as extensive appreciations of the artists by highly regarded jazz writers.\n\nIt is impossible to describe in even minimal detail the abundance of delights in these DVD's. Every person has his or her own reaction to music, not to mention to the sight of an artist in performance. However, brief descriptions of each DVD follow.\n\nNina Simone performs two concerts, the first in Holland in 1965 and the second in England in 1968. The 24-page booklet includes an introduction by Simone's daughter, and the concerts include some of the songs that she made famous, including \"Four Women,\" Mississippi Goddam\" and \"Go to Hell,\" after her political awakening from the Medgar Evers assassination. Reportedly, this choice was the producers' most controversial, and people whose opinions they sought were split about including Simone. Thankfully, they did. Now that Simone is being re-popularized by singers like Nnenna Freelon and Robin McKelle for her fierce originality, Jazz Icons has made it possible to take in the soulfulness of her live performances.\n\nLionel Hampton's video is the most traditional of the entire set, but it gives a sense of his famous unflagging energy that invariously excited his audiences, as Quincy Jones recalls in his reminiscence in the booklet. In addition, John McDonough provides an insightful and literate appreciation of Hampton's work. The Hampton concert took place at the Royal Theatre Opera House in Liège, Belgium in 1958. Reportedly, public broadcaster INR took liberties with the editing of the concert for television viewing, but still the DVD exhibits the exuberance of Hampton and the vitality of the band in no uncertain terms.\n\nCannonball Adderley, though reluctant to move to New York for a jazz career, became a sensation and inspired numerous musicians with the joyous spirituality of his music, including Nancy Wilson, Michael Wolff or Louis Hayes. The Jazz Icons package includes note by Ira Gitler and a remembrance from Adderley's widow. Moreover, the concerts in Germany and Switzerland in 1963 give a sense of Adderley's effervescence and confidence and includes sidemen Nat Adderley, Yusef Lateef, Joe Zawinul, Sam Jones and Louis Hayes. Moreover, Reelin' in the Years' dedication to the project is evident by its determination to present entire concerts, even though initially only 20-minutes of footage was available. Further research found the additional tapes, and now the entire 71-minute Swiss concert is shown for the first time since 1963.\n\nSonny Rollins performs with his-not customary-but unrestrained exuberance as if he's putting everything on the line whenever he performs during his 1965 and 1968 concerts in Denmark. The producers appear to appreciate Rollins' unique ability to connect with listeners by including appreciations by Joe Lovano and Joe Goldberg, a Rollins acquaintance from the 1950's who wrote the liner notes to Newk's Time. Noted biographer Ashley Kahn covers Rollins' career and describes the circumstances of the Danish concerts in detail. As Rollins toured Europe, he picked up back-up bands for his performances, and these two included Kenny Drew, Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, Alan Dawson and \"Tootie\" Heath. Rest assured, Rollins, as a force of nature until to give a less-than-astounding performance, includes his famous long introductions, penchant quotes, jubilant melodies, irresistible rhythms and signature cadenzas.\n\nBill Evans appears in a series of concerts in Sweden and Denmark from 1965 to 1975 with Chuck Israels, Ørsted Pedersen, Alan Dawson and Larry Bunker, and the concerts documented here are the shortest in the series. However, they do give evidence of the changes that Evans underwent during the half decade covered in the videos, and the viewer is treated to a youngish Lee Konitz walking onto the stage to join Evans. The booklet itself includes a touching tribute by Evans' daughter, Maxine, who had no idea how much her father affect thousands until she saw the multitude of people attending his memorial service at St. Peter's Church, including some outside who climbed onto the window sills to look in. In addition, Israels writes eloquently about the experience of performing with Evans. Possibly one of the most introverted of jazz musicians, hunched over the piano and seeming to give careful consideration to each note, Bill Evans comes across with the smoldering intensity that somehow made possible unique and beautiful, inimitable music.\n\nOscar Peterson gives more of his impeccably technically individualistic and unavoidably swinging concerts in Sweden, Denmark and Finland from 1963 to 1965. His popularity in Scandinavia comes as no surprise due to the fact that some of his famous albums, such as Eloquence, which was recorded live at the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen. Unfortunately, Peterson passed away just before the DVD was released, but his widow-who writes a foreword- permitted use of personal photos in the booklet. Peterson's irrepressible trio for these concerts included Ray Brown and Ed Thigpen as they always challenge each other and push each other to the highest levels of performance. Guest musicians include Roy Eldridge in Sweden and Clark Terry in Finland.\n\nAnd then there's Rahsaan Roland Kirk. Talk about being uncategorizable! And visually entertaining! Kirk always regretted, though, that his musicianship wasn't appreciated sufficiently, even as he emphasized his experimentation in sonic possibilities by playing multiple horns or creating some of his own instruments. However, his musicianship is entirely evident throughout these concerts, particularly on flute and tenor sax, and as always, he pours his entire soul into each concert, each song, each note. During Kirk's concerts in Belgium, Holland and Norway, he is joined by George Gruntz, Ron Burton, Guy Pedersen, Daniel Humair, Ørsted Pedersen and Alex Riel. While Kirk's strange and innovative sounds provoke some wonder when listening to CD's, his video provides clues to how he achieved such sonic accomplishments, such as his circular breathing, odd technique, unique fingering, the nature of the instruments identified with him and his interaction with audiences.\n\nLong review? No, it's short in comparison to the riches to be found in the Jazz Icons DVD's. The third set is available as an entire package, or the DVD's may be acquired separately according to the artists of interest. Whatever the case, the Jazz Icons series represent a major discovery in the documentation of legendary jazz musicians universally revered.\n\nBill Evans\n\nLive '64-'75\n\nYear: 2008\n\nRecord Label: NAXOS: Jazz Icons\n\nStyle: Jazz DVD / Video\n\nMusicians:\n\nBill Evans (piano), Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen (bass), Alan Dawson (drums), Lee Konitz (alto sax), Larry Bunker (drums), Chuck Israels (bass), Marty Morrell (Drums), Eliot Zigmund (drums), Eddie Gomez (bass)\n\nReview:\n\nThis newly issued DVD provides footage of the late and undeniably influential pianist Bill Evans' performances across Europe, spanning 1964-1975. Including an extensive booklet with photos and reminisces by Evans' daughter Maxine, the program offers a comprehensive documentary of the pianist's various trios, presented in chronological order.\n\nThe booklet features a conversation with bassist Chuck Israels (appearing on the 1964 tracks) who discusses Evans' ability to play so wondrously amid his drug addiction while providing other insights about the pianist's sense of organization et al. And Maxine Evans recollects the time when she rode in a limo with her father and Tony Bennett from New York to the Mike Douglas Show in Pennsylvania. Nonetheless, there's a wealth of information to accompany the video. With the opening moments of \"My Foolish Heart,\" from a 1964 performance in Sweden, we see the paradigm of Evans' stage persona, where he faces down towards the keyboard via his trance-like enactments.\n\nAlto sax great Lee Konitz sits in with the band for a breezy, mid-tempo swing on \"My Melancholy Baby, which is a highlight from Evans' 1965 gig in France. Here, the audience is treated to a flawlessly executed drum solo by Alan Dawson, who employs cross-sticking and other difficult to execute techniques. Of course, the late drummer was a revered clinician. Yet Evans remains the focal point during all of his trio permutations up through the color footage of his 1975 Danish TV set with bassist Eddie Gomez and drummer Eliot Zigmund.\n\nEvans' lyrically rich chord voicings and wondrous harmonic movements were engineered upon an ever-present sense of buoyancy and swing, regardless of pitch or tempo. A giant among jazz pianists, his artistry is often imitated, although his impressionable mark of authenticity can never be compromised. The film shows Evans bridging the gap between trad-jazz, bop and modern mainstream while conveying variable stylistic changes along the way. (EssentialŠ)\n\nRecord Label Website: http://www.jazzicons.com\n\nOscar Peterson\n\nLive in '63, '64 & '65\n\nNAXOS: Jazz Icons\n\nOne of several new DVD releases from NAXOS ' Jazz Icons series is late pianist Oscar Peterson's famed '60s trio, captured live in Scandinavia spanning 1963-1965. Featuring Doug Ramsey's insightful liner notes to round out a twenty-four page booklet, the black and white footage reinforces the musicians' zealous interactions and tight-knit arrangements.\n\nPeterson along with bassist Ray Brown and drummer Ed Thigpen are featured at theaters and clubs in Sweden (1963), Denmark (1964) and Finland (1965). Otherwise, Ramsey provides a comprehensive essay regarding these films, that have resided in TV station storage since the initial European airings back in the '60s. He also cites the steps leading up to the fruition of this trio, including guitarist Herb Ellis' departure from Peterson's band in 1958 and followed by the pianist's decision not to hire another guitarist. Hence, the booklet contains an informatively written historical perspective of Peterson's career and much more.\n\nThe camera crews were diligent during these performances. Zoom and pan shots of the well-dressed musicians are in abundance throughout. As one would expect, Peterson is often smiling at his band-mates while quietly mimicking many of his phrasings with facial gestures. Then trumpet great Roy Eldridge joins the trio via his soaring muted lines on \"But Not For Me.\"\n\nWith many of these jazz standards, Peterson occasionally launches matters into overdrive via his unbelievably fast arpeggios and single note runs. One of my favorite performances is culled from the band's appearance in Denmark. Here, drummer Ed Thigpen kicks off \"On Green Dolphin Street,\" with mallet rolls, paralleled by Peterson's swirling chord clusters. They follow with a lush, medium-tempo swing vamp, enhanced by the drummer's flawless timekeeping. While the trio closes out the Denmark set with its signature song, \"Hymn to Freedom.\"\n\nClark Terry appears with the band during its Finland show and conveys his wondrous stage appeal by alternating (left-hand, right-hand) trumpet and flugelhorn lines then finalizes the set with his always endearing piece, \"Mumbles.\" In addition, the soloists generate lots of high heat as Terry's distinct technique, coupled with Peterson's dazzling virtuosity translate into a proverbial match made in heaven. In sum, Peterson aficionados have reason to rejoice here.\n\nRecord Label Website: http://www.jazzicons.com\n\nReviewed by: Glenn Astarita\n\nback to list\n\nJazz Icons Series 3:\n\nCannonball Adderley, Bill Evans, Lionel Hampton, Oscar Peterson, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Sonny Rollins, and Nina Simone\n\nMark Burnell and Brian Ferdman\n\n2008-09-28\n\nLike its excellent predecessors, the third installment of the Jazz Icons series presents some phenomenal performances of world class jazz artists captured in various live settings throughout Europe between the 1950s and 1970s. Available as a set or individually, each of the following DVDs is culled from mostly excellent footage and has painstakingly restored sound that is typically crystal clear. In addition, each artist gets the royal treatment with his or her own 24-page booklet featuring liner notes from family members and prominent jazz historians, as well as rare photographs and memorabilia. Once again, the Jazz Icons series is a phenomenal package that is essential to any jazzhound's collection.\n\nCannonball Adderley Live in '63\n\nIn a time when jazz was dominated by performers who took an icily detached attitude toward their audience while playing heady compositions, Cannonball Adderley was a wonderful change of pace. Here we see him staying true to his Southern roots, having no qualms about visually expressing his joy onstage, frequently snapping, grooving, and laughing while engaging his audience in jovial banter, which was practically unthinkable in the austere jazz world of 1963. Musically speaking, he was rooted in the blues and swing, and those elements color his works, adding vibrancy and character. His sextet at this time was beyond impressive, including brother and songwriter Nat on cornet, the astounding Yusef Lateef on a variety of reed instruments, and a young Joe Zawinul getting funky on piano. Lateef's beautifully unique, Eastern stylings create a wonderful counterpoint to Adderley's bluesy sax, and the entire band is a very tight unit, especially on the groovy \"Jive Samba.\" The Swiss performance is in front of an audience while the German performance is not, and the difference becomes quite clear, as it is evident that Cannonball Adderley was a musician who truly fed off of the energy of the crowd. - Brian Ferdman\n\nBill Evans Live '64 - '75\n\nAs talented as he was, Bill Evans was far from a visually dynamic performer, and these concert clips certainly back up that notion. Hunched over his keyboard, Evans methodically plays notes without expressing any sort of visible emotion. However, his stoic demeanor belies his very expressive playing. Unfortunately, the collected songs on these performances are mostly ballads and there is a very similar quality to all of them. While Evans' smooth and gentle style becomes readily apparent, the lack of visual or sonic variety is a detriment to this DVD. Although these songs certainly create a wonderfully mellow mood, after 98 minutes, it's hard to avoid being lulled to sleep by Evans' lush chords and blank facial expression. - Brian Ferdman\n\nLionel Hampton Live in Belgium '58\n\nIn his introduction to the liner notes, Quincy Jones calls Hampton \"one of the greatest entertainers of the 20th century,\" and that sounds like pure hyperbole until you actually watch the DVD. Of course, I'd heard Hampton's terrific vibes before, but to actually see him perform is nothing short of a revelation and underscores just how historically important the Jazz Icons series really is. Surrounding himself with top notch musicians, Hampton is a one man spectacle of energy and showmanship that is simply joyous. I defy anyone not to be speechless by the end of \"Sticks Ahoy,\" an extended romp during which Hampton performs one of the greatest drum solos I've ever heard-- on a single drum. It's an utterly remarkable moment. - Mark Burnell\n\nOscar Peterson Live '63 - '65\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, the venerable Mr. Peterson barely moves at all. The other members of the trio, drummer Ed Thigpen and bassist Ray Brown, are barely any more animated in these three shows from Scandinavia, but it matters not because the intensity and quality of the playing is spellbinding. And even with this most unanimated of groups, the visual aspect of the shows are a treasure; from the subtle nods and cues between band members to Peterson's fascinating habit of apparently mouthing every note as he played it. There isn't a dull moment, either sonically or visually, and the highlights are simply too numerous to mention. - Mark Burnell\n\nRahsaan Roland Kirk Live in '63 & '67\n\nThere is genius, and then there is Rahsaan Roland Kirk. The multi-instrumentalist was one-of-a-kind, turning the world on its head, as he played multiple reed instruments simultaneously to great effect. Kirk's virtuosity is a spectacle to behold, and it is fascinating to watch him effortlessly wield this arsenal of saxes, flutes, and more. Performing with his musical weapons hanging around his neck, Kirk deftly switches horns on a dime, throws two and three saxes in his mouth (somehow managing to create a great sound with them), and even plays a whistle with his nose. All of this reads like campy gimmickry, but the brilliant Kirk makes it sound incredibly natural, and if one ignores the visual image, it easy to envision an army of reed players doing the work of one virtuoso. This was the genius of Rahsaan Roland Kirk, and these concerts showcase a master at work. - Brian Ferdman\n\nSonny Rollins Live in '65 & '68\n\nWhile watching this DVD, it dawned on me that I was finally watching a musician play more notes per minute than Jerry Garcia at his noodliest. In truth, there are many valid comparisons between Rollins and Garcia; apart from the obvious shared love of pure improvisation, both seem to lose themselves in their own worlds when they play, both have a habit of dropping melodies from other songs into their solos, and both have a fondness for trying to find beauty in sonic dissonance. This pair of shows from Denmark, capturing a trio from 1965 and a quartet set from 1968, beautifully showcases the gamut of Rollins' styles, from the bluesy to the modal bebop to a squonk factor of 10. It's fascinating to contrast the two very different versions here of Rollins' signature tune, \"Saint Thomas.\" The '65 version is ten minutes of Rollins exploring the tune, weaving in and out of the main theme and exploring every nook and cranny, whereas in the '68 version, Rollins allows his sidemen more freedom to put their own twist on the song, which results in an ending in quite different territory. Seeing Rollins pace around the stage like a caged tiger perfectly matches the restless exploratory nature of his music. - Mark Burnell\n\nNina Simone Live in '65 & '68\n\nThis release finds Ms Simone in two very different modes. The earlier concert from Dutch television is as intense as a performance gets, consisting of nothing but in-your-face tales of racism and poverty. Even the humor in the audience sing-along-encouraged \"Go Limp\" is as dark as you'd expect from a song about being arrested in a race riot. Simone's performance here of \"The Ballad of Hollis Brown\" is spine curdling—starting from a bare whisper, she works herself into a trance-link frenzy of indignation and anger. The second concert is from London in 1968 and finds Simone wearing an African headdress and playing funkier music with a slightly lighter subject matter than that of the previous show. That being said, the closing \"Why?,\" a number about the assassination of Martin Luther King, is as sad and moving as music gets, and towards the end of it, Simone looks as if she's about to burst into tears. It's worth noting that there is a faint hint of background static for a good chunk of the London show, but when the performance is this good, such a flaw is barely noticeable. - Mark Burnell\n\nback to list\n\nby Mark S. Tucker\n\nBill Evans: Jazz Icons Series 3: Live ‘64-’75\n\nIt would be impossible to overstate Bill Evans’ place and importance in jazz…or in music period. Anyone inclined to debate the point would be extremely hard put to defend his territory. My fave keyboardist is Keith Jarrett, and I’d be fighting for my life if I had to argue my choice in a roundtable with any aficionado of Bill’s. The guy was a phenomenon with a suppleness that defied description and a coolness that was unflappable, a gentleman born to outclass everyone merely by his very existance. In classical music, it was Glenn Gould; in jazz, it was Bill Evans. This set of performances spanning a little over a decade shows why.\n\nEvans was always completely concentrated into his music. Somber and in fact often almost funereal in aspect, the world existed in his hands, and he ceded everything to them. One could see the transfer physically. Only someone willing to play in that way could embody the million and one subtleties Evans displayed as a matter of natural course, from impeccable volume control and dynamics to brilliant clusters of improv that seemed too knowing, pre-scripted, part and parcel of the writing, impossible to be the spontaniety they were. And his transitions in speed and tone! Panthers and gazelles cannot move more gracefully. Following Evans’s workouts demands close attention, requiring the concentrated focus of the audience, and the crowds here are extremely enthusiastic. There’s an intensity of feeling in their response that’s life affirming, graphically illustrating the power of witnessing masterful art.\n\nEvans allows his backing players lots of room, and they return the favor by emitting solos that further provoke listeners to newer heights of involvement. Whether it’s Lee Konitz, Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen, Eddie Gomez, or whomever, there’s an élan present that sweeps out over the attendees. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of it all is the fact that Evans always took a gentler path. Even at his most energetic, there was a care for nuance, an extension of his inner being that forever stated itself in balladic tones and sophisticated restraints. His reading of Alfie completely transforms the composition, wringing classical elements from pop while improv-ing and pushing the tune onto a higher plane.\n\nSpeaking of pop, though bassist Eddie Gomez would later make ill-fated decisions to head into those pastures, here he’s stunning, complementary to Evans while sometimes running ahead of him, an unusual position for a bass player to take. Nonetheless, it invigorates the piano player to a new perspective and subtly transforms his voicing and direction, something one must be convinced he relished. Perhaps even more interestng is to watch, as the years pass and social and artistic cultures free up, Evans’ hair gets longer and his acumen ever deeper, almost on a one-for-one basis. By the time we get to the rarely performed Sareen Jurer, the level of complexity is overwhelming. Thus, unlike others in the video series, the Bill Evans release is a record of change and development rather than an arresting snaphot in time.\n\nCannonball Adderley: Jazz Icons Series 3: Live In ‘63\n\nShould any doubt for a moment why Miles chose Julian “Cannonball” Adderly (alto sax) for his ensembles, this will put the inquiry to rest. Sporting a dynamite band with brother Nat (cornet), Yusef Lateef (tenor sax, flute, oboe), Joe Zawinul (piano), Sam Jones (bass), and Louis Hayes (drums), Adderly commences the set in high fashion with “Jessica’s Day” a snappy boppish tune trotting out everyone’s chops before letting down into the balladic Angel Eyes, given over to Lateef and Zawinul, wherein Joe exhibits the Romantic side that forever dwelled in his work, whether trad or fusion.\n\nThe two sets—one from Switzerland, one from Germany—total 99 minutes in 11 songs, so there’s plenty of room for improv and solos. Unfortunately, Nat isn’t wielding that wickedly cool clarinet at any point, but he blends in with Cannonball and Lateef beautifully on cornet. When soloing, his tone’s a mid-point between Cannonball and Maynard Ferguson. The ensemble in total achieves an extremely large sound for just six cats and the rhythms are infectious as hell. Unlike some in the Naxos series, Adderley, though capable in any mode, favored a more urbane approach, rarely hiking into the stratosphere in terms of the groundbreaking. His genius lay in killer arranging and interpretation, above and beyond his exhaustless energy. Big band connoissieurs gravitated to him much more than to, say, Sonny Rollins or Coltrane, who were not as easily understood.\n\nAs with the rest of this series, the sound is pristine, as up-to-the-moment as a contemporary broadcast. This is crucial in cuts like Bohemia After Dark and its accelerations into overdrive. The clarity is as precise as a blueprint at almost all levels, though Jones remains a tad undermiked, probably purposely. In this song, the three frontmen—the Adderleys and Lateef—trade off sections of the melody and solos, vying to top one another in an overachieving display of superlatives; thus, even though the band may not be as radical as some, it took a backseat to no one.\n\nOscar Peterson: Jazz Icons Series 3: Live in ‘63, ‘64, & ‘65\n\nIf there were two contemporaries who could put the sweat in each other, it had to be Oscar Peterson and Bill Evans. Oscar had a harder edge, more the bop and swing in him, while Bill was the Romantic and classicalist, but both could cut the rug out from under a symphony orchestra when they got going in their chops. Peterson was as clean as they came, each note crystalline, every chord a well-defined cluster, and this trio is still considered to be one of the best ever produced in jazz, Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums. Clark Terry drops in on cornet and trumpet, Roy Eldridge doing the same on just trumpet, but center stage belongs to the trio.\n\nA number of classics come up for treatment during this 84 minute feast—Misty, On Green Dolphin Street, and so on—with Satin Doll demonstrating how Peterson could make a song dance on its own head, changing up all over the place, flurries of notes cascading just before blocks of chords fly up, the piano completely pliable under his hands. (Oh, and if you want to see where the theme to the TV show *Bewitched* came from, listen here.)\n\nWhen it came to sheer purity of tone, Peterson was the guy, his time’s Al DiMeola on the piano. People speak of trying to follow modern guitarists’ fingers during solos—well, the camera zooms in on Oscar’s digits, and they’re just blurs. How anyone could control ten separate pegs like that? It’s above human, but seeing is believeing, and that’s part of the magic of these DVDs: you’re right there, closer than the audience itself ever got, up close and personal, witness to the miraculous.\n\nThat said, there are many I’d listen to over Peterson—Corea, Jarrett, Evans, and so on—but there’s no denying the man’s brilliance and this set of video momentos is something I’ll be returning to time and again. There may be voices I prefer over his, but it’s nothing short of incredible to watch a man do what Oscar Peterson does. Those who think all the time in between then and now may have produced a higher caliber of player would do well to catch these rare tapes and think again.\n\nNina Simone: Jazz Icons Series 3: Live in ‘65 & ‘68\n\nNina Simone was an iconoclast of the first water, someone who backed down for no one, stood her ground fiercely, and poured out rage,"
