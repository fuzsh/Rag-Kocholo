Their distinctive sound, follows in the tradition of great English alt pop and progressive rock whilst also reflecting their background in jazz.' (album notes). 'Four years in the making, this eight-track album from the husband and wife pairing of award-winning vocalist Zoë Gilby and multi-instrumentalist Andy Champion, scores highly for its strikingly distinctive sound-world, a multi-layered mash-up of all pop, prog and jazz which scrambles musical categories in rich and fascinating ways .....' (Peter Quinn in Jazzwise ****)\n\nDetails and Samples :\n\nGroup Sounds Four & Five - Black & White Raga\n\n(Jazz In Britain) - Released: 29th December 2020\n\nHenry Lowther (trumpet); Lyn Dobson (tenor sax); Ken McCarthy (piano); Ron Rubin, Jack Bruce (bass); Jon Hiseman (drums)\n\n'Two sessions previously assumed either lost or unrecorded, by Henry Lowther’s and Lyn Dobson’s mid-sixties groups. Considered one of the missing links in the development of British free-form jazz. The Group Sounds Four session includes Jack Bruce, who contributes an original composition never otherwise recorded. Also features Ron Rubin, Ken McCarthy and Jon Hiseman. With comprehensive notes by Duncan Heining concerning the historical significance of these recordings.' (album notes). 'Taken from the Jon Hiseman tape archive Group Sounds Four (a broadcast from June 1966...) and Group Sounds Five (another broadcast, this time from November 1965 ....) is an important archival find. The group never recorded according to Lowther ....Moving effortlessly between open and closed forms, they may have been waiting for the latest Miles release of the period, but this music has a distinct imprimatur of strong musical personalities doing things their way.'

After stepping out of their spacecraft, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin bounced around in this strange gravity vacuum – gathering terrain samples, snapping photos, then planting a momentous flag, as they looked back into space at the place from which they came. Captured within their gaze, Earth appeared no more than thumb sized from so distant a perspective...... It could also be said that seeing the world from such a perspective had the net effect of raising our collective environmental/ecological conscience. One photo brought us to the realization of the habitat we all share, and our inherent duties to its preservation: in essence, the photo was a depiction of the ecological movement’s claims, and an impetus for positive action on our planet’s behalf..... Fast-forward to the present day: In May of 2017, a ship of mighty musical warriors joined forces for a meeting of kindred spirits. Departing from the La Casa Murada launchpad (adjacent to nearby Barcelona, Spain), they embarked on a freewheeling nomadic adventure across known and unknown borders of the musical universe – and beyond! In terms of direction, these sonic pioneers relied more on instincts than any cues from a map. The seeds were planted; an air of excitement was already cultivated, in anticipation of something new and supremely unique sprouting forth.... Their corporate voyage carried them through the labyrinths of alien-influenced, unpredictably imaginative musical terrain. Hari Ketiga is the logbook amassed during the exploration: an incredible array of nine tracks that weaves written scores together with full improvisation.' (Extract from extensive album notes).'\n\nDetails, Extensive Album notes, and Samples **: Listen to You'll Never Be Alone : Listen to The Deal :\n\nBarbara Thompson - Live At The BBC\n\n(Repertoire Records) - Released: 30th November 2020 [14 CD Box set]\n\nBarbara Thompson (saxophone, flute, recorder) with various musicians.\n\n'14 CD set containing 27 complete radio programmes constituting 14 hours of music. Over 100 remastered and restored tracks from 1969-1990 together for the first time on one release. Featuring contributions from many legends of British jazz including Jack Bruce, Jon Hiseman, Don Rendell, Harry Beckett, Kenny Wheeler, Henry Lowther, Ian Carr, Dick Heckstall-Smith, Gary Husband, Frank Ricotti and Chris Spedding. Liner notes by celebrated jazz critic, broadcaster and saxophonist Dave Gelly MBE. Barbara Thompson MBE is a virtuoso saxophonist, composer and bandleader whose career has spanned five decades. Despite her battle with Parkinson's Disease, Barbara's vast career has seen her perform, compose and lead on many projects including The New Jazz Orchestra, The United Jazz & Rock Ensemble, Jubiaba, Paraphernalia, Andrew Lloyd-Webber productions and Colosseum. She is considered a pioneering composer for the saxophone and was part of a luxuriant crop of new jazz composers in the 1960s: Mike Westbrook, Neil Ardley, Graham Collier, Mike Taylor, Michael Garrick and several more. Within a few years, Barbara would be among the most eminent of them, and by far the most prolific. This previously hidden treasure trove of Barbara Thompson recordings amounts to 14 CDs containing complete radio programmes recorded and broadcast by the BBC over a period of 21 years. Many come from Barbara's own tapes, preserved by her husband, legendary drummer Jon Hiseman, in their archive at Temple Music, while others have been gathered from private collections across Britain and Europe. The material ranges from a live concert by the New Jazz Orchestra, introduced by Humphrey Lyttelton, in February 1969 to a set by Paraphernalia, featuring Jon Hiseman and keyboard player Peter Lemer, dating from June 1990. Along the way are such rarities as: a set of compositions by Mike Taylor, broadcast in 1969 as a tribute following his then-recent death; Improvisations for Octet and Strings (1970); Five Movements for Jazz Ensemble (1971), conducted by Neil Ardley and introduced by Ian Carr; several broadcasts from the mid-1970s by Jubiaba; and many sets by Paraphernalia in its various forms including a complete concert broadcast live from Holland Park, mastered to the highest level.' (album notes). '.... The joy of this compilation isn't simply to indulge yourself in the delights of Thompson's sax, flute and composing skills. It also provides a snapshot (admittedly a 14-hour snapshot) of 20-plus years of jazz in the UK and, curiously, its relationship to the BBC ....' (Andy Robson in Jazzwise ****)\n\nDetails : Purchase Details :\n\nBad Uok - Lateless\n\n(Trouble In The East Records ) - Released: 20th December 2020\n\nFederico Pierantoni (trombone); Leonardo Rizzi (Fender Rhodes); Andrea Cali (piano); Andrea Grillini (drums)\n\n'The Bologna-based members of the bass-less quartet Bad Uok - drummer/composer/leader Andrea Grillini, guitarist turned keyboardist Leonardo Rizzi, trombonist Federico Pierantoni and pianist Andrea Cali - celebrate a decade-long collaboration with a new album, Lateless, which brings in as much of aesthetically composure as experimentation. The album kicks off with “105 Pt.3”, which makes a bridge between the first recording, Enter (2013), and this one. A repetitive piano note and minimal percussion provide a light path for the trombone explorations, but it’s only after the picture becomes tinged with Rhodes shadings that an entrancing rhythm gains shape, making us move our feet. The group skirts around that battering pulsation for another relaxed trombone dissertation, after which an accessible avant-jazz interlaces with elements that are reminiscent of danceable electronic music. The piece ends with chiming organ sounds and brisk drum work. Particularly cinematic, “Nails” allowed that a few famous chase scenes popped up in my mind...... Bad Uok keeps the thrill factor throughout as they invest everything in rhythm and mood. Moving seamlessly between genres with a non-rigid posture, the group deserves international credibility.' (JazzTrail).\n\nDetails and Samples** : Listen to 105 Pt 3 : Listen to Nails :\n\nStephen Godsall - Atlantic Skies\n\n(Southern Summer Records) - Released: 8th December 2020\n\nStephen Godsall (composer, plucked and keyboard instruments, drums); Ian Ellis (tenor sax); Sarah Bolter (alto sax, flute, bass clarinet); Anita Somner (flute); Angharad Miller (trumpet), Featured vocalists; Alison Baverstock, Hazel Tratt, Natalie Davis, Laura Taylor and Sara Harris.\n\n'Stephen Godsall is a composer and multi-instrumentalist based in Southern England. In 2020 Stephen Godsall challenged himself to create a new track each week, released with a short film on youtube. He describes it as a surprising experience; “I was a little afraid of running out of ideas and wearing out my listeners. Instead I've found that both the music and the number of listeners has grown; I still have lots of ideas which I plan to develop in 2021.” His new album selects highlights from the year; many of which are collaborations with other musicians. The music combines jazz, electronica and ambient ideas. The fiery “Mental” in 5/4 time combines harmony vocals, sax and Hammond organ. “Deciduous” is a reflective duet for nylon guitar and tenor sax while “Hell's cauldron” is a sweeping soundscape of prepared piano and electronics. “15 things to do with a cheap ukelele” is a wry take on the joy of making music. Sampling plays a big part, with orchestral sections, sound sculptures and a new song which apparently features Jimi Hendrix on vocals.' (album notes).\n\nDetails and Samples : Video for Mental : Listen to Deciduous : Listen to Hell's Cauldron :\n\nMiles Davis - Before The Cool : The Miles Davis Collection 1945 - 1948\n\n(Acrobat) - Released: 2020 [2 CDs]\n\nMiles Davis (trumpet) with various personnel including Kai Winding, JJ Johnson, Charlie Parker (alto sax, tenor sax), Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell, Hank Jones, John Lewis, Al Haig, Max Roach, and others.\n\n'Trumpeter Miles Davis was without doubt one of the most important and influential jazz musicians of the post-war era, not only as a pioneer of the bebop movement but through being at the forefront of many stylistic and musical innovations over the years. His landmark debut album for Capitol The Birth Of The Cool, recorded during 1949 and 1950, became regarded as seminal in the history of cool jazz, exploring unusual harmonies and textures. This excellent-value 49-track 2-CD set comprises his studio recordings in small ensembles, in which he is the only trumpeter, from his studio debut in 1945 through to the end of 1948, just weeks before the first of the Birth Of The Cool sessions in January 1949. As a bonus, it concludes with a live recording with Charlie Parkers All Stars in December 1948. It features performances with Charlie Parker's Reeboppers, the Charlie Parker Septet, Charlie Parker All Stars, Coleman Hawkins All Stars, Miles Davis All Stars, Charlie Parker Quintet & Charlie Parker Sextet from eleven different recording sessions during these years . Charlie Parker was his primary collaborator on these sessions, but among the musicians featured in the various line-ups were Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell, Kai Winding, Coleman Hawkins, Lucky Thompson, Hank Jones, John Lewis, Max Roach, J.J. Johnson, Al Haig, Curly Russell and others. Its a fascinating insight into the development of his music during these key formative years.' (album notes). 'Given the album's timeline, it's no surprise that 45 out of these 49 tracks feature Charlie Parker (and to a greater extent than Davis) while the four with Bird on tenor are the only ones led by Miles himself. So, in other words,this is another selection of Savoy Master Takes and Dial Master Takes, widely available elsewhere. But, if we take the compilers' premise at face value. it's interesting to note the great strides taken by the trumpeter during this three-year period ....' (Brian Priestley in Jazzwise ****)\n\nDetails (Amazon) : Details (WH Smith) : Samples :\n\nRendell / Carr Quintet - BBC Jazz Club: Rendell/Carr Quintet 1965-1966\n\n(Rhythm and Blues Records / 1960s Records) - Released 2nd November 2020\n\nIan Carr (trumpet, flugelhorn); Don Rendell (tenor sax, soprano sax, flute);Michael Garrick, Colin Purbrook (piano); Dave Green, Jeff Clyne (bass); Trevor Tomkins (drums)\n\n'Creating a most interesting groove which combines a good deal of avant garde experimentation with the jazz fundamentals of logic and swing (Melody Maker), the Don Rendell-Ian Carr Quintet has gone down in British jazz history as a cult band, its few commercially-issued albums remaining among the most collectable of their kind. Mixing the gravitas of the veteran saxophonist Rendell with the ambitious and eclectic tastes of co-leader Carr the unit was a crucible of Brit-jazz development, swiftly moving from orthodox Hard Bop to a style unquestionably its own. These three previously unissued sessions (both studio-taped and live) capture the band in transition from its early incarnation with Colin Purbrook in the piano chair through to the wilder, free-flowing, moods that followed Michael Garrick s arrival in 1965. Long-term Rendell/Carr fans will welcome new versions of the quintet s classic tracks Dusk Fire, Jubal and Hot Rod, as well as several group-penned compositions heard here for the first time.' (album notes). '.... The sound quality of the broadcasts is superior to the previous live releases, making this a must-have CD from what has come to be regarded as one of the finest jazz groupos ever.' (Stuart Nicholson in Jazzwise ****)\n\nSamples : Details :\n\nJimmy Smith - Four Classic Albums (Live) Second Set\n\n(Avid Jazz) - Released: 2020\n\nJimmy Smith (organ); Thomas Schwartz, Eddie McFadden (guitar); Donald Bailey (drums)\n\n'AVID Jazz continues with its Four Classic Albums series with a second finely re-mastered 2CD release from Jimmy Smith complete with original artwork, liner notes and personnel details. For this set, our second featuring Jimmy Smith we have selected four more albums that feature arguably one of the greatest exponents of the Hammond organ and certainly one of the most famous and influential to future generations of musicians. And this time it's a Live set! 'Live At The Baby Grand Volumes 1 & 2' and 'Groovin' At Small's Paradise Volumes 1& 2'. We don't think we would find many detractors if we were to say that our latest guest artist is probably the most famous jazz Hammond organist in the world. Mr Jimmy Smith, or to give him his rightful name The Incredible Jimmy Smith (depending on what album you're listening to) spent his formative years in the early 1950s in R&B bands playing piano and dabbling with the Hammond organ. After hearing Wild Bill Davis he made the permanent switch to the Hammond and was soon discovered by Blue Note supremo Alfred Lion. Smith was incredibly prolific, (hmm, perhaps that's where the name came from?), recording over forty sessions for Blue Note in a period of just eight years. He made many classic albums and we at AVID think we hit the spot with our first set AMSC1321. For our second set we have gone Live with two volumes apiece recorded at The Baby Grand in 1956 and at Small's Paradise in 1957. Both feature Jimmy Smith in a Trio setting with the Baby Grand set featuring Thornel Schwartz on guitar and Donald Bailey on drums. The second set at Small's features Bailey again on drums but this time Eddie McFadden takes the guitar chair.' (album notes) '..... There's a minor carp, of course, because what's on offer is definitive stuff, made all the more attractive for its budget price. Indeed, don't overlook the fact that with Universal still sorting out its Blue Note reissue plan, releases like this are now doubly important. All in all, a great introduction to Smith at his stripped-down best.' (Simon Spillett in Jazzwise ****)\n\nDetails :\n\nKeith Tippett - The Monk Watches The Eagle\n\n(Discus Music) - Released: 23rd September 2020\n\nKeith Tippett (composer, conductor); Julie Tippetts (text and solo voice); saxophone ensemble and improvising soloists: Paul Dunmall (soprano), Kevin Figes (alto); Ben Waghorn (tenor), Chris Biscoe (baritone); The Apollo Saxophone Quartet: Tim Redpath (soprano); Rob Buckland (alto); Andy Scott (tenor), David Roach (baritone); The BBC Singers.\n\n'Keith was commissioned to write this work for the 2004 Norwich and Norfolk Festival, where it received its premier (and to date only) performance, together with a broadcast by BBC Radio 3. It is a beautiful and stirring work for large choir, saxophone octet and solo improvising voice. Whilst clearly referencing the great polyphonic choral music tradition, Keith's score also enables improvisational elements to be present - in such a skilful way that the listener is left with the impression of a very unified piece despite the diversity of approaches which a close listen to the work reveals. Julie Tippetts says \"What a thrill to work alongside the BBC Singers, and be in the midst of such wonderful musicians. What generosity of warmth and spirit was displayed in this spine-tingling performance of Keith’s wonderful composition. I feel honoured to have been a part of it. I shall never forget the magical magnitude of that wonderful event. So atmospheric. Such a beautiful, moving experience.\" And the final word has to be Keith's own dedication “A gift to my father, Patrick” – Keith Tippett (album notes). '... Tippetts gyres and gambols from an ecclesiastic piety to the dirtiest of blues moans, all interspersed with a catalogue of yelps and wails that Maggie Nicols would relish.... a fittingly heavenly way of remembering the recently-passed Tippetts.' (Andy Robson in Jazzwise ****)\n\nDetails and Samples :\n\nJanne Mark - Kontinent\n\n(ACT Records) - Released: 13th November 2020\n\nJanne Mark (vocals); Arve Henriksen (trumpets, spoken word & electronics); Nils Økland (hardanger fiddle, viola d’amore & violin); Henrik Gunde (piano, harmonium, mellotron & vibraphone); Esben Eyermann (double bass); Bjørn Heebøll (drums).\n\n'Hymns and spiritual traditionals are the source of inspiration for Danish vocalist Janne Mark, and also her own compositions elude a sensual, and meditative energy. Intimate, reduced music with influences from worship music, folk, singer-songwriter and jazz. With this second release on ACT singer, songwriter and hymnist Janne Mark presents a kaleidoscopic travelogue from her pilgrimages in life and art. KONTINENT is a soaring departure from PILGRIM (2018) and documents the expanding collaboration with musical miracle worker Arve Henriksen. KONTINENT affirms Janne Mark’s position as a strong voice in contemporary hymn writing and as a sculpturer chiselling out melodies from the bedrock beneath her. The world she creates for herself on KONTINENT contains as diverse elements as the melodies of the northern Atlantic folk music tradition, Danish author Naja Marie Aidt’s poem from the novel When Death Takes Something From You Give It Back and the spellbinding 7th-century celtic lullaby Taladh Chriosta and they sit comfortably among the hymns and clear-cut melodies of the artist herself. With Arve Henriksen as trumpeter and producer.' (album notes). '.... Powerful and memorable, this is music for the ages.' (Stuart Nicholson in Jazzwise ****)\n\nDetails and Samples : Introductory Video : Video of Altid allerede elsket :\n\nRaphaël Pannier Quartet - Faune\n\n(French Paradox) - Released: 18th September 2020\n\nMiguel Zenón (alto saxophone); Aaron Goldberg (piano); François Moutin (double bass); Raphaël Pannier (drums) + guests Jacob Bergson (keys, electronics); Giorgi Mikadze (piano).\n\n'With Faune, the New York-based French drummer/composer Raphaël Pannier provides an arresting work of elaboration in which he includes serious-minded originals and renditions of known classical and jazz pieces made contemporary. His debut as a leader couldn’t have been so effective if he hadn't put together a tight-knit quartet fronted by his mentor and musical director, the Puerto Rican saxophonist Miguel Zenón. The group is rhythmically bolstered by pianist Aaron Goldberg and bassist François Moutin. The lead-off track, Ornette Coleman’s “Lonely Woman”, is taken to new heights. Leisurely flowing and surrounded by space, this inventive interpretation finds the drummer throwing in some curve balls with textural ingeniousness and colorful technique (sometimes hand drumming too). The silkiness is slightly roughened for Zenón’s invigorating discourse, and then it’s Moutin’s stunning bass monologue that resumes the breathiness. The bassist talks empathically again on “Midtown Blues”, a Manhattan-inspired trio piece that thrives with piano elasticity and vividly swinging brushwork. It ends up with tradeoffs between the drummer and his bandmates. The jazz covers are completed with Wayne Shorter’s “E.S.P.”, a staple of the Miles Davis Quintet, here redefined with a keen aesthetic sensitivity via an incredible control of tempo and steep variations. Feeling simultaneously focused and carefree, especially while swinging, this tune is bookended by a galloping intro and a crescendo-motivated outro, both atmospherically enriched by the producer/keyboardist Jacob Bergson. ... I'm left to conclude that the quartet’s perception of Pannier’s music is thoroughly accurate. The drummer's gifted compositions are worthy of admiration while the non-original material sounds fresh without being sinister.'

Jarrett, whose family roots reach back to Hungary, viewed the Budapest concert as akin to a homecoming, and the context inspired much creative improvisation. Where Jarrett’s early solo concerts shaped a large arc of music over the course of an evening, the later concerts have generated suite-like structures, comprised of independent “movements”, each of them a marvel of spontaneous resourcefulness. Creative energy is applied also to familiar songs given as encores, “It’s A Lonesome Old Town” and “Answer Me”, transformed in the Budapest concert.' (album notes). 'After the sad news reporting that prolific pianist Keith Jarrett might not ever play again in public after two strokes suffered in 2018, we try to find solace in his discography. The double solo album Budapest Concert, his latest ECM release, was captured live at The Bela Bartok National Concert Hall in Budapest, Hungary, an inspiring country for him for several reasons. First of all, because of his appreciation for Bartok’s impressive music, and second because his maternal grandmother hailed from there. Following up last year’s Munich 2016, this is the second live-recording culled from his memorable 2016 tour. Over the course of the album’s 14 tracks, we are sucked into his personal musical realm of free improvisation with classical and folk influences. At the end, he even grants us a couple of standards that are usually part of his concert repertoire - a slow-paced rubato interpretation of “It’s a Lonesome Old Town”, which also appeared on the previous recording, and a touching reading of “Answer Me My Love” .....No one expected this to be at the level of works like The Koln Concert or Solo Concerts: Bremen and Lausanne. And it’s not. Still, it’s Jarrett speaking his sophisticated language, totally immersed in his incontestable style.'

It is the right time to stand and see the disruption humans have caused to nature's balance and our growing disconnection from our natural landscape. ‘Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind’ is about the sea, a place we are slowly seeing the harm caused, to the reefs, ecosystems, and from plastic pollution. ‘Polar Retreat’ reflects on the melting of the ice caps and celebrates our wild, barren landscapes, we are at risk of losing. I feel we're standing at a vital crossroads, as we realise the damage that we have caused to our natural world, a world so many of us love and all depend on. It is only through these realisations we can find creative solutions and see new possibilities to create a brighter world......' (album notes). 'Like a double cherry, this album has two parts delicately connected vivid instrumentals, and songs that take the soul-jazz shape, coupled by an intention to tell stories. As We Stand is an expressive work, as if reading the personal diary of harpist Tori Handsley; confusion, reflection, love, playfulness and exasperation play out, while the musical intuition of Ruth Goller, Moses Boyd and Sahra Gure delineate compelling angles ....'

In the words of Greta Thunberg, \"Our house is on fire\", so we must do everything we can to halt and reverse this disaster. Alastair Penman is a multi-award-winning saxophonist and composer praised by critics for his \"undoubtedly brilliant imagination\" and \"surpassingly beautiful music\". 'Do You Hear Me?' fuses Penman's masterful saxophone playing with electronic effects, backings and enhancements to create a unique sound world and convey the urgency of the climate emergency. 'Do You Hear Me?' has been produced by legendary saxophonist and producer John Harle, following on from Penman and Harle's successful collaboration on Penman's critically acclaimed debut album 'Electric Dawn'. 50% of proceeds from the album will be donated to two highly impactful environmental charities: Clean Air Task Force and Coalition for Rainforest Nations.'\n\nDetails : Video for Our House Is On Fire :\n\nArtemis - Artemis\n\n(Blue Note Records) - Released: 11th September 2020\n\nMelissa Aldana (tenor sax); Ingrid Jensen (trumpet); Anat Cohen (clarinet, bass clarinet); Cecile McLorin Salvant(vocals); Renee Rosnes (piano); Noriko Ueda (bass); Alison Miller (drums).\n\n'All-star collective featuring Renee Rosnes, Anat Cohen, Melissa Aldana, Ingrid Jensen, Noriko Ueda, Allison Miller & Cécile McLorin Salvant release their debut album 'Artemis', a superb nine-song set that features material composed and/or arranged by each of the band's six instrumentalists. 'The group identity emerged organically', Rosnes says, and Artemis discovered a thrilling collective vision early in its lifespan. 'We are seven leaders, each with our own vision and personal point of view, but we play with a unified conception.' (album notes). 'Artemis is an all-female supergroup whose seven members already possess deep credentials in the modern jazz world. They are not only intrepid improvisers and colorists but also true team players. Hence, Artemis’ eponymous debut album is highly demonstrative of those feats. Under the musical direction of Canadian pianist Renee Rosnes, this international ensemble proudly features New York-based jazz figures from different parts of the world, namely Israeli clarinetist Anat Cohen, Chilean saxophonist Melissa Aldana, Canadian trumpeter Ingrid Jensen, American vocalist Cecile McLorin Salvant, Japanese bassist Noriko Ueda and American drummer Alison Miller. Artemis is the Greek goddess of the hunt and the wilderness. The opener, precisely titled “Goddess of the Hunt”, was penned by Miller, who forges an attractive rhythm with Ueda here. The tune features four distinctive soloists - Aldana, exemplary in her acrobatic movements, is effective across the whole range of the saxophone but really stuns whenever she hits the low notes; Rosnes develops fleet phrases with horn fills in the back; Jensen’s unique locution is filled with meaningful piercing notes; and Cohen brings her dulcet sound and agile imagination to the fore. The interesting arrangement inflicted by Jensen to The Beatles’ “The Fool on the Hill” transformed the amiable pop of the British group into polished post-bop. Amidst the collective effort, it’s hard not to notice the conjoint work of the contrabass and the bass clarinet toward low-end stabilization. ....

Descending chords introduce the second section as the band steps into the gathering maelstrom, eventually resolving into a beatifically lyrical theme that seems to summon the abiding power of the iconic vista. (album notes). 'Cleveland-born, Baltimore-based pedal steel guitar player/composer Susan Alcorn always finds a taut balance between articulate melody and ambiguous, atmospheric ambiances. She’s usually seen playing in duo and trio formats but for her most recent outing, Pedernal, she assembled a quintet with three old collaborators - guitarist Mary Halvorson, bassist Michael Formanek and drummer Ryan Sawyer - and a new backer of her musical cause - violinist Michael Feldman. The album embraces diverse languages, moods and styles, yet, the five Alcorn compositions perfectly cohere as a whole. The title track initiates the journey by centering guitar and bass in a spiritual communion. The group embraces folk, chamber music and country-jazz with a deep melodic sense in this charming sonic portrait of Cerro Pedernal, a narrow mesa located in northern New Mexico. Inspired by the Anasazi dwellings in southeastern Utah’s Hovenweep National Monument, “Circular Ruins” enhances a contrasting, restless cymbal activity within the reflective mood delineated by concurrent guitars and violin countermelodies. Halvorson’s exquisite tones are wonderful during the explorative states of suspension created by Alcorn’s colorful chordal work and the lugubrious bowing of the bass and violin .... Alcorn’s long-awaited debut as a leader is a promising sign regarding the work that will come in the future.'

Charette’s keyboards are accompanied by synths and drum machines that he has programmed to react to him in provocative ways as he tracks live. The music is original catchy instrumental tunes with hip beats, memorable melodies, slick chords, and dreamy atmospheres. The heart of the music is the Hammond Organ which is compelling because it is rarely seen in this robotic context.

Following up Kingmaker - his encouraging debut on Blue Note - Who Are You? is a collection of 15 new made-to-measure instrumentals whose result is utterly rewarding. Ross, who moved to New York from Chicago, welcomes bassist Kanoa Mendenhall into the group, expanding the original quartet featuring saxophonist Immanuel Wilkins, pianist Jeremy Corren and drummer Jeremy Dutton. Proficient jazz harpist Brandee Younger is also featured on five tracks, including Coltrane’s “After the Rain”, where the sweetness of her sweeps and plucks contribute to achieve spiritual heights. The record kicks off with “Dream”, a Dutton-penned piece that brings a certain magic spell and dramatic quality. This is followed by Mendenhall’s solo-bass “Calling”, which serves to bridge the path that takes us from the opening piece to the waltzing “Home”, a Ross composition cooled-out by an unspeakable comfort and endearment .... Ross is a storyteller with an ample melodic and harmonic sense. He brings such a broad scope to the jazz vibraphone universe that his music is capable of influencing hearts and minds.'

For Chris Potter, a musician who has been on the road continuously since the 1990s, whose raison d’etre is playing live, lockdown presented both a challenge and an opportunity. It’s a tribute to his creativity, personal integrity and huge musical talent that Chris was able to take on this challenge and make something unbelievably fresh from the opportunity. Starting in May 2020, as the Black Lives Matter movement was kicking off (reflected in the track ‘I Had A Dream’), Chris set out to create something alone, to express his reaction to these chaotic times. Uniquely, playing each and every instrument: piano, keyboards, electric and acoustic guitars, bass guitar, drums, clarinet, bass clarinet, flute, alto flute, percussion, samples and of course saxophones, Chris took just six weeks to complete the whole process.' (album notes). 'This solo album by Chris Potter, made in six weeks while in lockdown, reveals instrumental insight as he plays all the instruments in a new and challenging experience that included writing, recording and producing. It's not as thrilling as when he plays with his groups, but his known strengths are on display, especially the killer saxophone solos, the compositional eclecticism, and the ability to find color and joy in his surroundings. The opening track, “I Had a Dream”, has all that. The piece, inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, has a glowing Afro-folk feel to it that enhances the urgency of equality in this world.... In turn, “Rest Your Head” waltzes gently, displaying a lovely pop melody on top of a harmonic tapestry competently textured with acoustic and electric guitars.....There is a Tide was conceptualized and arranged with imagination, insisting on the search for beauty and hope instead of focusing on the fear and despair. Although far from Potter’s foremost works, it’s hard not to be uplifted by its positive energy.'

Guest artists: Tosin Abasi (guitar); Areni Agbabia (vocals); Artyom Manukyan (cello).\n\n'Produced by Hamasyan, 'The Call Within' is a journey into the artist's dreamlike inner world, which is as realistic to him as his physical one. Hamasyan, who believes that the 'moment of unconscious creation is the way to feel conscious', says: 'Unutterable seconds of longing, subliminal realization, and mostly joy fill the body as a work of art, a poem, or a melody is being born into this world for no apparent reason, but only for the humanity to discover what is invisible: the divine mystery'. (album notes). 'After two consecutive solo albums, namely An Ancient Observer (2017) and For Gyumri (2018), Armenian pianist/composer Tigran Hamasyan returns to the trio format on The Call Within, his sixth album for Nonesuch and the most fascinating thus far. Pairing up with American electric bassist Evan Marien and Swiss drummer Arthur Hnatek, Hamasyan delves deeper into dreamlike inner states, nudging the band into uncharted realms while drawing inspiration from astrology, maps from ancient eras, geometry, divine mysteries, ancient Armenian design and folklore, and many more. The album provides several highlights encrusted with technical acuity, and “Levitation 21” couldn’t have opened the album in a better way. Incantatory chants are set against a relaxed piano-driven background; yet, on top of that, the energetic rhythmic thrust of Marien and Hnatek creates a polyrhythmic feel that completely dazzles. It’s a beautiful piece indeed, with effortless transitions in which the ethereal moods of folk and classical contrast with the powerful dynamism of progressive jazz and rock ..... These expertly structured frameworks are designed with imagination and a perfect sense of direction. I hope they provide the same exhilarating listening experience for you as they provided for me.'

More than ten years after BFP creation, three recorded albums and many tours around the world, the trio comes back to present the 4th album: a succeed, successful and flagship album. \"L\" marks a frank evolution in Benjamin Faugloire's style: if it confirms his personality and his emotivity, it nonetheless refined here even more and focuses on the essential. Indeed, he avoids conventions and makes fun with form or style: Only the narration counts. The trio just reached a level of cohesion and musicality unmatched until now. Spontaneity of playing and improvisation, strong moments, unforeseen silences, as much risks as a united trio like BFP can accomplish with so much control and flexibility. The whole with the precision and the colorful writing from the pianist. \"L\" is one of those albums that gives you chills, makes you cry and laugh, brings you back to your childhood memories, your love stories...

I worked with Julian Tear for many years in the Academy of St Martin's in the Fields chamber orchestra and asked him to record the music with his quartet. The quartet becomes a quintet when I call on the double bass to play 'arco' and the French horn is a bridge between to the two genres.” Most of the ten original compositions on the album were written five years ago. “They seemed a little sad and reflective at the time so I put them in a folder and forgot about them,” says Rattigan. “The irony is that the title When could be applied to the times we’re living in now.” (album notes).\n\nDetails and Listen to the Title Track When :\n\nKate Westbrook / The Granite Band - Earth Felt The Wound\n\n(Westbrook Records) - Released: 31st July 2020\n\nKate Westbrook (voacls); Roz Harding (alto sax, soprano sax); Mike Westbrook (keys, Piano, organ); Jesse Molins, Matthew North (guitar); Billie Bottle (bass, piano, organ, vocal;s); Coach York (drums)\n\n'Hard on the heels of their ‘epic and ground-breaking’ Granite project, Kate and the Granite Band with producer Jay Auborn are back with a major new album.

The band perform each song in their own unmistakeable style, breathing new life into the best vintage music. “Swing Into Christmas” is Down for the Count’s holiday celebration - a collection of our favourite Christmas tunes, alongside a few winter-themed jazz standards. This album is special to us, as it’s the first time we have worked in the studio with string players. For years, we at Down for the Count have dreamt about adding strings to the line-up, and over the past year or so we have been lucky enough to work with City String Ensemble, led by Sophie Poteratchi. They are not only fantastically talented musicians, but they are also a wonderful group of people to be around, and it has been a joy welcoming them to the Down for the Count family. Huge thanks to Sophie and her team for their energy and positivity - we hope that this will be the first of many albums we record together, and we’re sorry that you’ve had to endure our questionable sense of humour and 15 years of “in-jokes”. For this album we’ve also expanded the regular Down for the Count line-up with more instruments, including trombone and percussion, and we hope that listeners enjoy the results! ....We began planning this album in August 2019, and the first day of recording was in January 2020. As we all know, a few weeks afterwards the world changed. It’s been a difficult year for everyone, for one reason or another - and for those who love the arts, it has been particularly challenging. We know that this album can’t even begin to replicate the joy that live performance brings to our lives, but all of us at Down for the Count remain hugely grateful to our loyal fans (including the many new fans who have discovered us in lockdown).

Chris Barber's discography runs to around 200 pages. Starting off as a standard, but highly accomplished, Traditional Jazz band, from the 1960s onwards the band started to expand its horizons and widen the repertoire without losing sight of its roots. This previously unreleased CD from 1963 shows that development in place: alongside the standard Trad Jazz fare there are Gospel tunes, Duke Ellington material as well as two tunes by Kurt Weill and originals by Chris Barber himself. Blues singer Ottilie Patterson also broadens her Blues scope with songs by Memphis Minnie, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and a reworking of an old Bessie Smith song. Most of Chris Barber's 'live' recordings have been large concert ones, but this sees the band in a Jazz club setting, less formal with the band relaxed, on top form and enjoying itself.

This is not a slavish recreation, or an attempt at nostalgia, but the result of a creative mind working in the spirit of the album, and with the legacy of a great artist. It’s an exercise in expressing the past in the present and the future. Tim has brought together a multi-talented chamber orchestra to interpret his interpretation and compositions. “It is not just the spirit of Focus I wished to pay homage to on this album, but the experimental urges of the early 1960s that were heard in jazz, film music, and the classical world - fuelled by romanticism and the burgeoning psychedelia of the new decade.” (album notes).

On his debut as leader, South’s mature, emotionally direct playing is matched by three regular collaborators who together take the strong source material through a set of volatile landscapes....... The album is a collection of the choral Spirituals that glue together the movements of Michael Tippett’s oratorio A Child of Our Time, delicately arranged by Graham for this project. The Spirituals themselves combine strong religious imagery with a broader symbolic struggle ushered in by their context – all originated as songs sung by African American slaves in America, with the strong liberatory tone of the lyrics offering hope of eventual triumph through strife. Maintaining an appreciation for the music’s origins whilst also carving out a space for creativity was something deeply important in Graham’s approach to the album, as he explains: “The creative process around these arrangements and performances was based around the musical and lyrical content of the songs, trying to show deep respect to them whilst providing space for improvisation. Working with these spirituals has led me to seek more knowledge about their history, the systematic oppression of the Black Americans who created them, and the wisdom of the songs themselves.” ......

(album notes). 'Featuring a collection of songs written by Scottish musician and composer Duncan Lamont, the album is full of the character and wit that Lamont, who died in July 2019, brought to his work as an astute observer of places and people. Originally a trumpet player, Lamont left his hometown, Greenock for London in the 1950s, and like many other musicians of the time, he worked his passage on transatlantic liners, by now playing saxophone in the ships’ orchestras so that he could experience the jazz scene in New York while on shore leave. He not only learned from the musicians he heard on these trips, going on to play with Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Bing Crosby, Count Basie and Sir Paul McCartney among other top line stars, he also got ideas for songs.....“Every time I sing a jazz standard like Midnight Sun or More Than You Know, I think of Duncan because these songs were of the quality that he aimed for in his own writing,” says Tina May. “And he very often succeeded because he was such a perfectionist. There’s a least one song on the album that had two different sets of lyrics because Duncan kept tinkering and improving on what he’d written.” (Rob Adams).\n\nDetails when album is released : Video of Tina May singing Duncan Lamont's Where Were You In April live six years ago :\n\nThe Nels Kline Singers - Share The Wealth\n\n(Blue Note Records) - Released: 13th November 2020\n\nNels Cline (guitars; Skerik: saxophone); Brian Marsella (piano, keyboards); Trevor Dunn (bass); Scott Amendola (drums); Cyro Baptista (percussion).\n\n'On Nels Cline's third release 'Share The Wealth', the sonic explorer and guitar renegade delivers a potent and provocative program of spontaneous, uncompromising, and ultimately compelling music. The expanded edition of his long-running project, The Nels Cline Singers, features saxophonist and punk-jazz iconoclast Skerik, keyboard marvel Brian Marsella, bass powerhouse Trevor Dunn, longtime collaborator and drummer Scott Amendola, and Brazilian percussionist Cyro Baptista. Together they revel in swirling, evocative soundscapes brimming with ferocious skronking and uninhibited stretching on this dynamic album.' (album notes). 'The spunky music of farsighted American guitarist Nels Cline glitters with jagged detail and unfolds with a progressive attitude. Following-up on Microscope (Mack Avenue, 2014), his previous work with the squad The Singers, Share the Wealth is a grippingly disorienting double album that results from a two-day recording of spontaneous music. The current formation - a sextet - allows Cline to merge stylistic currents with complexity and sophistication, and the fantastic opener, Caetano Veloso’s “Segunda” is a case in point. A visceral folk dance working within a more conventional song format and delivered with irresistible rock and Brazilian flavors, shows that Cline not only is unafraid to step into risky musical forays, but also does it successfully.....Touting nearly telepathic interplay, this thought-provoking record is an absolute joy for the ears and a must listen for all lovers of modern music. Indisputably, one of my favorites of 2020.'

Lionel Loueke is one of the most singular, compelling and innovative artists of his and any generation on the international scene. Known for his ability to “transform the guitar into a virtual Afro-Western orchestra” (Jazz Times), he is a musician who transcends genre to create unparalleled sounds. In a deeply personal tribute, Lionel takes Herbie’s best-known compositions (including Cantaloupe Island, Watermelon Man and Rock It), and creates something entirely fresh and new.' (album notes). 'The eclectic work of legendary pianist/keyboardist Herbie Hancock informs and inspires a new album from virtuoso West African guitarist Lionel Loueke, whose idiosyncratic style is not just served with a groove-oriented posture and rhythmically advanced patterns, but also emotional lyricism. He definitely puts his own stamp on fresh interpretations of selected Hancock pieces..... Boasting a firm grasp across styles and idioms, Loueke makes a wonderful homage to Hancock; from a great musician to another great musician. And he closes out the album with a rambunctious reading of “One Finger Snap”, whose original hard-swinging abandonment is discarded in favor of a relentless and hectic electronic vibe.

The remaining members are bassist Michael Formanek and drummer Tomas Fujiwara - both colleagues of Halvorson in the Thumbscrew trio - and avant-garde vocalist Amirtha Kidambi. The material on this recording was inspired by many factors, but perhaps the most significant of them has to do with the challenging poetic forms picked by Halvorson to write the lyrics for each tune. With words inspired by and dedicated to novelist Lawrence Osborne, “The Lemon Trees” is a pure delight. It kicks off with gentle waltzing steps conducted by arpeggiated guitar, brushed drums, and topped by Latin-flavored trumpet, quickly segueing into the sung part, where Wyatt’s beautiful voice - efficiently backed by Kidambi and Grand - takes us to the realms of King Crimson. The final section of O’Farrill’s wide-ranging solo has exclusively drums as accompaniment, and, afterwards, the drummer seizes the opportunity to deliver an enthusiastic statement himself.....Halvorson, who always takes the jazz guitar to another dimension with such extraordinary talents, creates another powerful album. And, damn, how I loved to hear Wyatt here!'

Ingrid Laubrock presents on this double album five compositions in double version. On the first CD, the EOS Chamber Orchestra Cologne interprets Laubrock's compositions. The soloists are Cory Smythe (piano), Sam Pluta (electronics), Robert Landfermann (bass), Tom Rainey (drums) and Ingrid Laubrock (saxophone). On a second CD of the double album a filigree ensemble around the core trio of Ingrid Laubrock, Cory Smythe, Sam Pluta and the guests Adam Matlock, Josh Modney and Zeena Parkins play the same five compositions. The two CDs of Laubrock's works contrast, diverge and complement each other. Ingrid Laubrock writes: “While the small-group versions were composed first, I did not just re-arrange those compositions for the orchestra but rather re-imagined them. As I wrote the large-scale pieces, I often zoomed-in on a detail in a small-group version to generate a materially different large-group piece.” As a whole, the two CDs paint fascinating musical panoramas, inspired by the composer's dream worlds, characterized by Laubrock's ability to compose and the individual colors and shades of the soloists.' (album notes). 'Saxophonist Ingrid Laubrock’s latest release, Dreamt Twice, Twice Dreamt, displays her unwavering talent as not only an improviser but as a composer/arranger as well. Recently, she has been focusing more on large scale composition, with her previous outing, Contemporary Chaos Practices (Intakt, 2018) receiving general praise. Yet, this new double-album features two disparate versions of five compositions originally written for small ensemble and later re-worked and expanded for chamber orchestra. The main inspiration for the pieces was Laubrock’s dream diaries......With respect to “I Never Liked That Guy”, the small-ensemble version triumphs as a result of a haunting atmosphere that keeps pushing us into dark corners with skittering soprano diagonals over prostrate piano shapes and mysterious electronic effects. It all ends in a feast of ostinatos. This extended opus offers a substantial listening with all its transitions, integrations and innovations. Laubrock’s music can be slow-burning and quietly exploratory in one moment, combustible and antic the next. Here, she manages to keep the freshness and vibrancy for which her music is known.'

Michael Feinberg, bassist/composer originally from Atlanta, Georgia is one of them. Feinberg with seven leader albums up his sleeve may not be labelled as a new comer but this is his debut release on this label which prides itself with the rich tradition of great bass players such as Red Mitchell, Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, Sam Jones, Jay Anderson, Scott Lee, just mention a few. Feinberg leads here a formidable band with two horn-front by one of the most influential saxophonists Dave Liebman on soprano and young elite Noah Preminger on tenor whose SteepleChase debut album, by the way, is on its way. (album notes). 'The seventh outing as a leader from rising star bassist/composer Michael Feinberg offers an accomplished set of tunes and features a well-versed lineup that includes multi-generational saxophonists - veteran master Dave Liebman and today’s revitalizing force Noah Preminger - plus a cohesive rhythm section in which he links up with Gary Versace on piano and Ian Froman on drums. A notorious swinger, Feinberg demonstrates to have a warm and easily appealing bass playing that sparks with a lovely glow, while composition-wise, he melds tradition and modern jazz sensibilities with an organic disposition. The leadoff track “Louisville”, named after the city where the boxer Muhammad Ali was born, is the perfect example, sliding between epic modal jazz and blithe Latin-tinged passages. The rhythmically tense melodies unleashed by Liebman propose an avant-garde coating, while Preminger, no less explorative, appraises idioms loaded with verbal elasticity and quick-wit. For his part, Versace, who has a gift for spontaneous melody, sequences rhythmic figures with nimble fingering.....Feinberg’s music is as much straightforward as it is extraordinarily appealing. From Where We Came leaves an indelible impression.'

His compositions exhibit his philosophy of providing short melodies as the basis of both solo and group improvisation; \"Get in and get out,\" as Allen likes to say. This gives his music a remarkable ever-transforming feel, as if the improvisation was actually part of the composition itself. To bring his music to life, Allen requires players of the utmost talent and creativity and he has certainly found them in bassist, Ian Kenselaar and drummer, Nic Cacioppo. \"I found the bad boys of this generation, as far as I'm concerned,\" says Allen, \"guys who are not afraid to dip their toe in the avant-garde a little bit, and then turn around and play the tradition.\" But tradition to Allen is a development, an unending arc of creativity which begins at the dawn of jazz and to which he is the latest contributor to the music's evolution. (album notes). 'Throughout a triumphant career, saxophonist JD Allen has taken the time to refine his sound and develop his language, carving out a unique place for himself in the jazz spectrum. On his new trio outing, Toys / Die Dreaming, he summons for the second time bassist Ian Kenselaar and drummer Nic Cacioppo, two young musicians who find here a pragmatic compromise between the robust, the adventurous, and the polished. Peppering the proceedings, the trio opens with a standard; “You’re My Thrill” gets a fresh reworking from minute one, when Kenselaar and Cacioppo create the ideal ambiance for Allen’s advanced melodic recital. The theme, stated with smart and subtle punctuation, is followed by improvised tenor run-ups embellished with blues and gospel licks. Allen’s engrossing intonation - incisive, dark and compact - is on full display here, providing unexpected muscularity to a supposedly soft tune. In opposition to the first track, “The G Thing” feels like a standard without being one. It displays a solid mid-tempo swing after a theme statement conducted with beseeching sax melodies and cymbal legato...... Not as muscled as Barracoon, its predecessor, Toys/Die Dreaming features Allen as we know him: in superb form.'

Since relocating from his native UK to New York City he’s thrived in the world’s toughest jazz environment, and brought his inimitable personality to work on projects for the likes of Branford Marsalis, Joey Calderazzo, Kurt Rosenwinkel, Bill Charlap, Billy Cobham, Wayne Krantz, Ari Hoenig, Seamus Blake, Jeff “Tain” Watts and David Sanchez among many others.“As a leader he shines even brighter - his drumless OWL Trio in particular gained plaudits across the board for its hushed, intimate atmosphere. Now he’s back with a completely different conception: his latest release Romantic Funk: The Unfamiliar introduces us to a new sound, a tribute to the muscular, high-intensity fusion of the 1980s, and a new band, Romantic Funk. .... Le Fleming’s tunes showcase his band’s individual excellence and group cohesion. ‘I’ll Tell You What It Is Later’ is influenced by the Miles Davis albums of the 80’s and late 60’s. It uses a simple form with minimal chords and open unrestricted solo section, giving Philip Dizack space to shine. “Phil is a very intuitive, musical player. His choices always seem to make so much sense.” ‘Waynes’ is inspired by le Fleming’s two favourite Waynes - Shorter and Krantz alternating excitingly between tension and release. .....“When writing this album, I was very conscious of the improvisational sections being tailored for the specific musicians, allowing them freedom to express their quirks. I encouraged risk taking and tried to make it fun for them without being too much of a control freak. It’s very much a cohesive band, as we workshopped this material at the 55 bar over the last year. The ‘Romantic’ in Romantic Funk is more in line with romantic ideals such as the indefinable, unbounded, inexpressible, unfamiliar.” To which we might add - Outstanding.'

These newly discovered recordings feature wonderful performances that are every bit as compelling as those the original Time Out. We discovered that during the original 1959 sessions the Quartet also recorded 'I'm In a Dancing Mood' and an unlisted trio jam with a major drum solo that included snatches of the melody from 'Watusi Drums'. Two tracks from Time Out, 'Pick Up Sticks' and 'Everybody's Jumpin', were achieved in e take so no alternates exist to include here. These 7 new performances (and bonus track) are fascinating finds.\" Chris Brubeck. \"We've all heard Dave Brubeck's Time Out - but never quite like this. You'll hear Dave Brubeck's signature pieces afresh and anew. Listening to this album will make you rediscover why you fell in love with The Dave Brubeck Quartet featuring Paul Desmond, Joe Morello and Eugene Wright. This is mesmerising music.\" Kabir Sehgal, Grammy Award Winning Producer. \"Once the Dave Brubeck Quartet released Time Out in 1959, the world of jazz was never the same. Every note of the seven original compositions soared with wild originality and trained musical genius. 'Take Five' became the best-selling jazz single of the twentieth century. I've often wondered how this work of genius came to fruition in the studio? How did Brubeck develop such chemistry with alto-saxophonist Paul Desmond? Now the mysteries are solved with the historic release of Time OutTakes (alternative takes to the masterpiece that blew the hinges off the doors of jazz). What a high privilege it is to be able to be in the studio with the quartet as they innovate using 9/8, 5/4 and 2 bars of 3/4 alternating with 2 bars of 4/4 on such classics as 'Blue Rondo a la Turk' and 'Three to Get Ready'. All listeners of Time OutTakes will experience the Cold War era jazz revolution as it unfolded. What joyous music for the ages!\" Douglas Brinkley, CNN historian and Grammy-winning jazz producer.'

Dexter’s arrival in Copenhagen had a tremendous impact that left a lasting impression on the Danish jazz scene. He was handsome and well-dressed. His playing was superb, with a giant sound; his introductions and showmanship were unique and captivating. In addition, Dexter felt the Danish mentality was well-suited for playing and enjoying jazz...... It’s impossible not to notice Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen on this recording. He was already a virtuoso in 1964, at the age of 18. NHØP was a genius on the contrabass. First and foremost, however, this session is an excellent example of how good it sounds when musicians get to play together every night, week after week. The trio played with Dexter three months throughout the summer to a full house every night. With the great Tete Montoliu the trio was burning behind Dexter. This album is an example of the superior quality of the music that was played at Montmartre during this golden era. Thank you, Dexter for all that you gave us!....'

Following the disastrous results of Britain’s 2016 Brexit referendum vote Jaswon took the decision to leave London for Berlin and set about establishing himself in Europe’s creative hub. This journey of musical discovery has led to collaborations with artists from Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam and Copenhagen, the formation of the Joshua Jaswon Octet and the recording of Silent Sea. “The nucleus of the project first took shape when I read a collection of twenty contemporary poems collated by Carol Ann Duffy,” explains Jaswon. “The project was an opportunity to engage with themes that have significant meaning for me and move beyond an exercise in abstract music making.” Each composition on the album is based on the text of a contemporary British poem by writers Jackie Kay, Maura Dooley and Rachael Boast and deals with the issues surrounding climate change and Brexit. “It is moving, fresh and thought-provoking and the music perfectly mirrors the poem’s anxiety and satirical humour,” says Kay, Scotland’s Makar (poet laureate), commenting on Jaswon’s interpretation of her poem ‘Extinction’. “The jazz music fits the poem like a hand to a glove, and the rhythms and tempos capture the heightened sense of time running out, of seizing the moment.” The Octet’s distinctive sound is lyrical, intensely rhythmic and steeped in the magic of storytelling. “One of the challenges in writing for an eight-piece group was to utilise the timbral and compositional possibilities afforded by a larger ensemble without losing the intensity that comes from small-combo interaction. The group’s rhythm-section powerfully shape the music’s narrative and momentum while being able to respond in the moment to it’s shifting contours,” says Jaswon. “The playing of Miguel Gorodi, Marc Doffey and Jan Landowski shows their exceptional ability as improvisers and ensemble musicians, and the music lives and breathes through Anna Serierse’s outstanding voice.” (album notes)\n\nDetails and Samples : Article by Howard Lawes for Sandy Brown Jazz : Brief Introductory Video :\n\nPatrick Cornelius - Acadia: Way Of The Cairns\n\n(Whirlwind Recordings) - Released: 30th October 2020\n\nPatrick Cornelius (alto saxophone); Kristjan Randalu (piano); Michael Janisch (double bass); Paul Wiltgen (drums)\n\n'Over the course of eighteen years living in New York City, Patrick Cornelius has earned a substantial reputation as a saxophonist, composer, solo artist and educator, and created an impressive body of work comprised of nine albums as a leader, featuring some of the finest musicians from the global jazz and improvised music scene. Now for his latest release Way of the Cairns he reunites a ‘TransAtlantic Collective’ of like-minded musicians for a brand new project of original compositions. Fourteen years ago, Cornelius and bassist (and Whirlwind label boss) Michael Janisch teamed up with Luxembourgish drummer Paul Wiltgen and virtuoso Estonian pianist Kristjan Randalu for a tour that turned into a band that turned into a recording project that delivered, in Cornelius’ own words, “some of the best musical experiences I’ve ever had”. This new music takes inspiration from his experiences of hiking with his growing family among the untamed wilderness of Maine’s Acadia National Park. The band delivers an outstanding set of first and second-take performances that combine the heat of New York’s jazz scene with the depth and subtlety of the European jazz tradition to create a set of recordings that are accessible and melodic, but as powerful and compelling as the landscapes that inspired them. The album takes the listener on a journey through a set of inspiring scenes. ‘Way of the Cairns’ describes the ascent of Great Head Mountain, through texture and tempo changes and a strong bass/sax unison melody. ‘Star Party’ commemorates a beachside star-gazing session with a lyrical piano feature for Randalu. The insistent, subtly shifting groove and intricate melody of ’Blueberry Mountain’ evoke a sense of tumbling, childlike excitement, contrasting with the radiant, gently lilting calm of ‘Seawall Sunrise’. ‘Darkest Night’ has a feature for Janisch’s powerful, clearly articulated bass, and ‘On The Precipice’ hands the reins to Wiltgen for a thrilling drum break, both pieces articulating the ominous quality that can be revealed when travelling across the wilderness. ....... Though Cornelius is leader and principal writer, Way of the Cairns is very much the sound of a collective - “My idea was to feature the band as the lead voice, rather than myself. There’s a definite chemistry here - not super-straight ahead but not avant-garde either - embracing the European aesthetic, but with the ability to swing hard as well - that’s the unique magic of this band.” The inspiration from Cornelius’ favourite landscapes that underlies the compositions, combined with the special rapport between the players, gives the album a powerful, highly characterful unity that makes this a stand-out release.'

When compiling the POTTED HISTORY OF BRITISH TRADITIONAL JAZZ (LAKE LACD300) triple album, it became apparent that there were various stories within the stories and the previous TANGENT series attempted to tell the stories of Classic style, Dixieland/Chicago, Mainstream, New Orleans style, Territory bands etc, etc. This final set is a round-up with examples of all the aforementioned. The series tried, as far as possible, to avoid the 'big names' of Traditional Jazz, but this volume does include tracks by Ball, Barber and Bilk plus Alex Welsh and Terry Lightfoot. Its subtitle is 'Rarities & Hidden Gems' because 18 of the 23 tracks are previously unreleased and those that have been released were mostly on small, obscure labels. It makes an enjoyable, informative and fitting end to the series.'

After an All Star tour in Europe in 1958, Pettiford decided to relocate there. Berendt went straight to work organising a series of studio appointments with band members for his American guest. These included not only local talents such as trumpeter Dusko Goykovich, clarinettist Rolf Kühn and drummer Hartwig Bartz, but also more widely established artists such as saxophonist Hans Koller and guitarist Attila Zoller; each took his place in the queue. American colleagues, including drummer Kenny Clarke and saxophonist Lucky Thompson, occasionally joined the team and formed exquisite combos that discreetly courted Pettiford. For his part, Pettiford thanked them with inspired eloquence on his instrument. During the next couple of years, a good dozen recordings were made, mainly of standards, but also including Pettiford hits such as Blues in the Closet. These recordings document a master of the bebop swinging groove bass. Pettiford died prematurely in Copenhagen on 8 September 1960, as the result of a traffic accident. But he remains a charismatic figure in the annals of jazz history, whose art is always worth rediscovering.' (album notes). '....There's good playing from him and from some of the locals such as guitarist Zoller and reedmen Kuhn and Koller, but only the slow 'Sophisticated Lady' has fellow expatriate Lucky Thompson .....Most of these sessions are rather laid-back with either no percussion or very unobtrusive drumming ....'

Guitarist Chris Montague (Troyka, Squarepusher) and drummer Jon Scott (Kairos 4Tet, Sons Of Kemet XL) provide the perfect complement for Simmons’ matching of comprehensive musical chops and fearless imagination, and the resultant EP glues together the atmosphere of Massive Attack inspired dub and Fourtet influenced ambience with freewheeling improv amongst the trio itself. Simmons’ wide-ranging cultural curiosity provides the inspirations behind the evocative, cinematic quality of Monocled Man’s music: Bernabe Jurado is inspired by the curious true story of William Burroughs’ murder of his wife Joan Vollmer in a drunken game of William Tell, and the subsequent defence offered by his enigmatic lawyer Bernabe Jurado: the macabre stories of Katherine Dunn and country singer Steve Earle’s Southern Gothic novel ‘I’ll Never Get Out Of This World Alive’ further set the tone and provide the imagery for Simmons to pin his project to. For this latest iteration, four tracks of delay drenched trumpet, jagged guitar lines and chewed up drum patterns unfolded in the studio around melodies penned by Simmons, only to be chopped and reassembled by him into new ever-evolving forms. For ‘Bernabe Jurado’ Simmons created layers of ambient textures, influenced by contemporary producers like Brian Eno and Thom Yorke, over which his trumpet playing moves between Arve Henriksen/Nils Petter Molvaer inspired introspection, the twisting improv of Dave Douglas and the glassy rawness of Tomaz Stanko. The otherworldly ‘Sero Max For Joan Vollmer’ is based around multiple cut up rhythm parts from Scott and cumulates in a fearsome shred from Chris Montague....... Impossible to categorise, equally impossible to forget, Monocled Man continues the exploration into half-glimpsed worlds at the fringes of creative imagination.'

He’s equally at home exploring the tradition or pushing fearlessly against the boundaries, and now his unique creative voice is back in the spotlight with a typically idiosyncratic project: a re-framing of Radiohead’s Kid A album, featuring ten original arrangements of the source material played by an all-star band of like-minded musical mavericks. Whirlwind recording artist Tori Freestone joins James Allsop to form the twin-saxophone frontline, and Simpson is joined in the rhythm section by by the universally respected veteran Dave Whitford on bass and upcoming young hotshot Will Glaser on drums. The project was created to mark the 20th anniversary of the original album’s release, as part of a series of sell-out shows curated by Simpson at London’s Vortex club featuring non-jazz records rearranged with an improvisational focus. The original show was such a success, drawing in listeners from beyond the club’s regular audience, that Simpson re-assembled the band in the studio and recorded the entire album in a single afternoon session “I think the time pressure contributed to the performances. It’s really punchy and to the point, but a lot happens – it captures the energy so well”. There’s a wealth of detail to discover, and surprises at every turn. 'Everything In Its Right Place’ sets the scene, with the horns framing a beautifully constructed solo from Simpson, leading into the hushed piano intro of ‘Kid A’ that builds and builds towards a dramatic finale of controlled chaos.... ‘Motion Picture Soundtrack’ ends the journey with a hushed, contemplative ballad reading. Simpson’s imaginative, free-flowing arrangements give his superb band space to unleash their own individual voices. Sometimes sticking closely to the original melodies, sometimes re-purposing elements as the jumping-off point for radically new explorations, he leads his creative cohort to create a thrillingly uncategorizable musical experience. This record takes the listener on a journey through an ever-changing landscape of powerfully emotive moods and textures, while still preserving the concise, focused energy and emotional directness of the original.

This recording features an all-star cast of his longtime collaborators, with altoist John O’Gallagher and Josh Arcoleo on tenor making a ferocious twin-horn frontline and virtuoso bassist Sam Lasserson completing the rhythm section. With all the compelling immediacy of a live concert recording, 'Road Tales' documents how the shared experiences of being a band on the road for a decade or so has shaped a musical narrative, as each member tells the story of those experiences, and shows how they established their own identity within the compositions. “Some of these tunes go back many years, but I think what’s special here is the way that band works together, adding things that aren’t on the paper. So many things were completely unplanned - it’s pure interaction, the sound of a band taking risks together.” Williams’ compositions give his band a wonderfully diverse span of moods and colours to work with, and they rise to each occasion magnificently ... 'Road Tales', his sixth release for Whirlwind, marks the latest stage on a continuous musical journey for Williams and his musical partners. “I love to have a band that is able to take chances – It’s wonderful the way this group can develop my compositions, with their ability to take things as far as possible without going over the cliff. There aren't many actual on-going bands in jazz anymore. The fact that this is one is something I'm proud of. That's the only way a performance of this type becomes possible.” (album notes)\n\nDetails and Samples : Introductory Video : Listen to The Interloper :\n\nSimon Deeley's Blue Haze - Afan's Dance\n\n(Self Release) - Released: 31st May 2020\n\nSimon Deeley (piano, keyborads); Ian Cooper (bass); Charlie Russell (drums)\n\n'The music recorded for Afan's Dance shows the full stylistic range of Simon Deeley's writing at this time: from powerful, driving Jazz-Fusion numbers to groove-driven, blues-infused tracks, and on through atmospheric film music style compositions, to reflective, evocative ballads.

The album’s release coincides with a period of recuperation for Hamilton following surgery to remove his right kidney after a tumour was found during a CT scan for another problem that has since cleared up. “I went into hospital on September 25th and had the kidney removed along with the tumour and hopefully any traces of it from my body,” he says. “It seems we found it early enough to hope for a clear outcome moving forward.” As the Covid-19 pandemic began to take its effect on live music, Hamilton had tours with his regular employer, drumming legend Billy Cobham, as well as all his other bookings, cancelled.
