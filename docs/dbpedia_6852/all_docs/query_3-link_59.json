I could never repay Sonny for what he gave me, and it is safe to say that most of what you are about to read could not have happened without him.\n\nOn the subject of \"could not have happened without\" I also pay tribute to my parents, Henry and Edith. I think it's an even safer statement that neither of them could ever have imagined a work like this emerging from our family. Nevertheless, here it is Mom and Dad, and thanks for everything.\n\nMy last dedication is to the future, and specifically to my sons Frank and John David: I hope that your individual journeys will be as interesting as mine has been so far, and that you each find your voice and learn to use it wisely.\n\nAlso, with personal thanks to Safford Chamberlain, Charles Coffman, and above all Jack Goodwin for his friendship and support. I encourage all readers to visit the website that Jack has created with information and news regarding Warne: http://www.warnemarsh.info\n\nAnd of course, to Warne Marsh.

Since then I have often had the thought that the story was unusual and worth telling, and that I should write a book about it. Some circumstances in the summer of 2005 led me to start organizing notes on the technical aspects of my studies with Warne, and I then decided to begin work on the book that I've been imagining for many years. At this time (Spring of 2009) I have been at work on the project for almost four years and in addition to documenting the musical material that I learned with Warne I also tell the story of our time together. When I received the very sad news of his death in December of 1987 I mourned the loss of a good friend and mentor, and also felt that the jazz world had lost one of its most brilliant artists. As the pain of that loss receded over the following years it became increasingly clear to me that the beauty and inspiration evident in Warne's best work is still with us and arguably sounds as fresh today as when first created.\n\nIn 1991 I was contacted by author Safford Chamberlain and in introducing himself Safford mentioned then that he was an English teacher and saxophone player, had studied briefly with Warne before his death, and was planning to write a biography of him. I remember saying in that first phone call that (in my opinion) while a reasonable segment of the jazz world knew of Warne's unique abilities and contributions as a player, it seemed to me that there was very little awareness in the jazz community of his highly developed and unique teaching ability. This brings me to my second intention, which is to shed more light on Warne's role as a teacher and mentor and to document the information and methods that he shared with me. So while the first section of the text presents the history of our relationship and the issues that arose as a result, the second presents my recollection of the technical material that we covered in lessons. I also am of the opinion that much like his actual playing, Warne's conception of the underlying language and structures in jazz was unique and is still not widely known at this point in time.\n\nIn closing, I would like to comment on the title. I remember coming across the suggestion that for an average jazz enthusiast (or as Warne put it, 'people who work a day gig') who is getting to know the music through listening and reading, another way to learn is to become friends with a jazz musician in the local community. After a period of about two years an understanding of what can be regarded as the \"jazz life\" should be formed, and the resulting real-life experience would be far deeper than any book could ever offer. This work then is my attempt to share and honor major segments of several 'jazz lives' and communicate the profound passion, brilliance, commitment, and love for the art that informs and has informed those lives.\n\nFinally, if there are comments or feedback please send them along, I am happy to hear from anyone interested in Warne's legacy.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nJohn Klopotowski\n\nOakland, CA\n\nJune, 2009\n\nmail to: jklopotowski@gmail. com\n\nTechnical notes\n\nFor computer readers - audio and video examples are inserted or linked throughout the text.

Fall, 1980\n\nSonny Dallas\n\n\"Hey John, have you ever heard of a bass player named Sonny Dallas?\" It was an innocent enough question, and thinking back it was posed by my wife, Leslie, in the fall of 1980 when I was twenty-five years old. Even though I was a young man then I was both a jazz player and listener and considered myself fairly well-informed however my response was no, I hadn't heard of Sonny Dallas and asked why. Leslie told me that she had recently met a woman at work who was involved with him, and that he had been an active jazz player in New York in the 1950's and 60's and had either performed and/or recorded with Bill Evans, Phil Woods, Lee Konitz, Lennie Tristano, Warne Marsh, and others. Leslie went on to say that she had told Sonny's friend a little about me and that he passed back a message that he would like to meet. (I found out some time later that jazz drummer Chiz Harris, a friend of Sonny's, had a test of whether someone was 'hip' or not – if they had heard of Sonny Dallas they were, if they hadn't they were not!)\n\nLeslie and I were living at the time on the north shore of Long Island in a small harbor town called Port Jefferson, and I was enrolled as a doctoral student in music composition at Stony Brook University, which was fairly close to Port Jefferson.\n\nPort Jefferson is located on Long Island roughly fifty miles from the New York borough of Manhattan\n\nI entered the graduate program at Stony Brook two years earlier, however by 1980 had been a serious student of jazz for probably seven years and earned an undergraduate degree in Music/Jazz Studies at William Paterson College in Wayne, New Jersey with jazz guitar as my major instrument. William Paterson was in northern New Jersey close to the city of Paterson, which was where I grew up and not far at all from New York City.\n\nAfter about a week or so I summoned the courage to call Sonny and found him to be friendly and approachable. We chatted a little and set a time to get together at his home, a small house located on the southeastern shore of Long Island. When Leslie and I arrived the four of us got better acquainted and Sonny gave a slightly more detailed account of his past than when we had first talked on the phone. He had just turned 49 years old, was of Italian descent (his family name had been shortened from D'Alessandro), grew up in Pittsburgh, was originally a singer but took up the bass in the late 1940's, and moved to New York in 1955 to play jazz. One of his early friends and employers was alto saxophonist Phil Woods and Sonny had performed with Phil and recorded two albums with him in the 1950's. He worked for several years with pianist Lennie Tristano (starting in 1959) and in fact lived for a period of time in the basement of Lennie's house in Queens. Sonny had bought his current house in the 1960's when he was making a decent income as a free-lance player in New York and moved there permanently around 1970 or so.\n\nI really didn't have much to match Sonny's experiences in my own story, but shared some of my educational background and experiences as a player. After spending time talking we went to his studio on the second floor and played some duets for awhile. These are somewhat dim memories now, but I recall that the first tune we played was \"All the Things You Are,\" also that we played everything with a metronome beating quarter notes, and finally that Sonny was a tremendous soloist and played a quarter-note bass line that reminded me strongly of Paul Chambers, Miles Davis' great bassist in his 1950's groups. We played for an hour or so, and then when we were recapping the night and saying our goodbyes Sonny mentioned that he had been having regular weekly sessions at his house for several years with various players and that I was welcome if interested. I told him that I was definitely interested, thanked him, and said that I would be in touch.\n\nSonny Dallas in his studio in 1984\n\nLennie Tristano\n\nThrough Sonny I was also given a fast introduction to the musical world of Lennie Tristano. During the first evening that we met he spoke with obvious respect and affection for Lennie, but I had to confess that I didn't really know his music. In retrospect though, this was mostly due to lack of exposure to Lennie's work when I was studying jazz as a full-time student. Through my readings in jazz history however I did know of him as one of the principal \"cool jazz\" players from the late 1940's. Sonny mentioned that there weren't a lot of Lennie's recordings available, however an LP called \"Descent into the Maelstrom\" had been released near the end of his life and Sonny was on two tracks. He put the record on the turntable, but rather than play a track that he was on he chose a solo piano track of a standard called \"It's You or No One.\" I had a reaction that in retrospect is fairly common among many of Lennie's admirers - I was riveted as I sat and listened! I really had never before heard a pianist produce that sort of intense sound and also deep jazz feeling. Besides his strong sense of swing he was also playing a 'walking' bass line with his left hand as he improvised a single-note melodic line in the right, along with chords. One thing that struck me (and I still clearly remember) is that I naturally started tapping my foot on the second and fourth beats of each bar as I was listening. However, what was unusual was that there were moments when I was suddenly 'wrong': while I hadn't done anything different in my time keeping I found myself tapping on what felt like the first and third beats rather than the second and fourth beats. As I kept it going though I would then find that I was back on the second and fourth beats without making any sort of adjustment for my 'mistake. ' This went on through the track, so at the same time that I was inspired and impressed, I was also somewhat confused! When the track ended I asked Sonny about what I had heard. His slightly vague/jazz slang response to my question was that Lennie was able to \"put it on the wrong side of the barline. \" I didn't know what that meant, but I accepted it and in retrospect had my first seeds of curiosity planted about the Tristano approach to jazz.\n\nLennie Tristano: \"It's You or No One\"/Descent Into the Maelstrom\n\nThe next day I decided to do some research on Lennie in \"The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Jazz\" by Brian Case and Stan Britt and found this entry:\n\nBorn 1919 in Chicago, blind pianist and teacher Lennie Tristano attracted a small dedicated group of disciples in the '40's and '50's for what was popularly called 'The Cool School'. Running counter to the prevailing passions of bebop, Tristano experimented in linear improvisation, long, undulating Bach-like lines, counterpoint, atonality, a low decibel count and intense and subtle rhythmic complexity. … In 1949 the Lennie Tristano Sextet with altoist Lee Konitz, tenorman Warne Marsh, (and guitarist) Billy Bauer, recorded a classic (Crosscurrents). Over a steady rhythm the players wove in and out of each other's lines lightly and precisely. Intuition from this session dispensed with a harmonic base and is arguably the starting point of the New Thing – certainly free collective improvisation has never sounded so seamlessly beautiful.\n\nThough his detractors have accused Tristano of sounding bloodless and academic, Charlie Parker respected his music and the two men played together on the All Star Metronome broadcast. Tristano's moving blues for Bird, Requiem (Lines, 1955) proves that the cerebral approach need not preclude feeling. … Always a recluse, the great pianist did not choose to record again until 1962 (The New Tristano) which in terms of melodic invention, facility with complex time signatures and sheer technical mastery remains unsurpassed. An outspoken, uncompromising man, Tristano has remained aloof from the jazz world since, completely out of sympathy with the overt emotionalism of today's music – 'all emotion, no feeling'.\n\nIt became clear to me that Lennie Tristano was a large subject, and I resolved to find the recordings that were mentioned so that I could study them and form my own opinions.\n\nLennie Tristano at a solo concert in Copenhagen - 1965\n\nI remember having a somewhat restless sleep on the night that Sonny and I played and I dreamt that I could hear his bass line during what seemed like most of it. I decided to call him the next day and told him how much I enjoyed playing with him, and he graciously returned the compliment. And so we started playing once a week on a regular night and were joined by a good friend of Sonny's, tenor saxophonist Jim Brostman. Although Jim was playing tenor at the time, he was originally a trumpet player and impressed me as quite a brilliant guy and musician. The sessions were marvelously informal, and I became a regular participant for the next six years.\n\nThad Jones remembered\n\nThe sessions at Sonny's went on this way for the first few weeks, and one result was that I experienced something of a personal rebirth in jazz as a result. I was reminded of a time a few years before when I had chosen music as my major as an undergraduate student. I became immersed then in the world of jazz, generally practicing my instrument for at least four hours a day for several years and also doing a lot of playing with others and teaching at a busy music studio. My primary teachers had been Bob DeVos, a well-known northern New Jersey guitarist, and also the faculty members that I both studied and came to be friends with at William Paterson. Included in that group was Thad Jones, the great jazz trumpeter/composer/arranger. Though I don't think any student was ever a close friend of Thad's (he was frequently absent because of tours with his big band) he was always very friendly, warm, and encouraging. I remember first meeting him in late September of 1975 when he had just returned from a tour of Japan. We were all nervous when he showed up to the Jazz Improvisation class that he was teaching, but after hearing me play and getting to know me a little he invited me to sit in with his quartet at the campus coffee house two nights later (I had recently turned twenty years old when that happened). He was performing there for three nights with a quartet drawn from the members of his big band that included Walter Norris on piano, George Mraz on bass, and Mel Lewis on drums. He had me up to play two tunes in the second set, the room was filled to capacity, and I had quite an auspicious introduction to both my new school (I had transferred to William Paterson that fall from Rutgers University in Newark) and also to the world of professional jazz. I had the sense that night that I went through a rite of passage, and that though I was \"over my head\" in playing with the group I had to accept his generous invitation and learn what I could from the experience. Recently someone sent me a recording of a concert that Thad gave at the school just about a year before I started, and both his mastery of the trumpet and ever-creative and clever mind are in full display.\n\nThad Jones/Mel Lewis Quintet: \"Hot House\" (excerpt) – with Jerry Dodgion (woodwinds), Roland Hanna (piano), and George Mraz (bass) – recorded 9/12/74 at William Paterson College\n\nThad Jones - this picture was taken sometime during the time I knew him and is exactly how I remember him – bigger than life and full of spirit.\n\nAs time went on groups of students would also travel to New York to hear the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra on Monday nights at the Village Vanguard. On breaks he would invite us into the kitchen, which was considered sacred ground in jazz (there are famous jazz legends about John Coltrane practicing in the corner of the kitchen during breaks when he worked at the Vanguard). I also heard as much other live music in New York as I was able at that time, and some of my primary influences were guitarists Pat Martino and Jim Hall, and also the jazz universe that grew out of the various bands that Miles Davis had led, especially pianists Bill Evans and Chick Corea.\n\nBy the time I started graduate school at Stony Brook though my jazz life became somewhat dormant as I was immersed in classical studies and composing for the first two years and also much further removed geographically from northern New Jersey and the New York environment. I did miss my activities in the jazz world and I remember sharing this at the time in a phone call with one of my best friends, Bob Keller, a marvelous tenor saxophone and woodwind player who had been on the faculty at William Paterson. In that call Bobby encouraged me to look for a bass player locally, so when the opportunity came to get together with Sonny I had been hoping to find a situation where I could start playing regularly with other musicians again. Bobby also knew of Sonny (so he passed Chiz Harris' 'hip' test) since he had grown up in Queens and heard Sonny frequently there in local clubs with different players, and had even played with him once at an open session.\n\nI was very enthusiastic in those first few weeks with Sonny and the idea came to me then of studying jazz again, however I realistically doubted that I would have the time given my commitments at school. The thought stayed with me though and when I went to the next session I was sitting with Sonny and Jim and listening to music before we started playing. I decided to mention what had been on my mind, so I told them that I was thinking about studying jazz again. Sonny asked who I was considering as a teacher and I mentioned that my first thought was that I was sorry that Lennie wasn't still with us and teaching because he would be my first choice. I went on to say though that if I were to study with a guitarist I would choose Jim Hall since I admired his playing a great deal, and if it were anyone else I would choose alto saxophonist Phil Woods since he was clearly a master improviser and jazz performer. Sonny's quick response surprised me: \"well, if I were a young cat and looking to study there would only be one teacher I would consider.\" His statement aroused my curiosity so I asked, \"really, and who would that be? \"He responded, \"Warne Marsh – in my opinion he's the greatest improviser in the world, and he's teaching in New York.\" And further: \"I have his phone number and would be happy to give it to you.\" This surprised me because at that point we had not listened to many of Warne's recordings, and had discussed his work only peripherally in relation to Lennie Tristano. So I was intrigued to say the least, but for the time being filed the information in my mind and planned to get more familiar with Warne's music.\n\nII. 1981\n\nIt turns out that I was correct in my suspicions and didn't have the time to devote to studying jazz again due to the circumstance that as a first semester doctoral student I was immersed in my school work. There was a series of events about to unfold though that moved me forward in the direction of studying, whether I thought I had the time or not. Over the course of the previous few weeks Sonny had become quite enthusiastic about the sessions we had been having, and sometime around the New Year he brought up the idea of going into a recording studio to capture some of what we had been doing. I was all for it, and the timing was good in that I was on break between semesters at school and could spend a little more time practicing. Sonny had a contact who owned a recording studio in the town of Lake Ronkonkoma on Long Island and we booked some time for a session in early January. My recollections of the evening are that we were going through a very cold patch of winter weather and when we got to the studio it was in a basement and had no heat. This was a difficult environment for anyone there, and I remember feeling it physically in my fingers. So I was quite cold and also nervous, and this affected my playing in that I was \"rushing\" a lot, and whether it was nervousness or the cold I also didn't have a very free flow of ideas as I was improvising. Once the session was over and I received a copy of the tape I was fairly horrified at the result, so I called Sonny quickly and apologized for my performance. I also brought up the subject of lessons – over those first few months we had been sharing general ideas about teaching (I had amassed a reasonable amount of private and classroom teaching experience by then), and Sonny had several jazz students that he required to come for lessons once a week. I asked if he might relax that requirement a little and take me on as a student every other week. He pondered it and said, \"well, I think I can help you with note availability\" (whatever that meant!). After a brief pause he then said that he wasn't sure about bi-weekly lessons but would give it a try.\n\nSo we started lessons that month and in our first meeting Sonny explained his overall approach to teaching improvisation and offered some feedback regarding my jazz feel (or lack of it) that was a little tough to hear, but was very encouraging in that he felt I had tremendous potential as a player. His method involved working on some basic melodic and rhythmic patterns and then improvising through sets of chord progressions in twelve keys to develop facility as an improviser. He also taught me his approach to harmonic improvising or chord substitution: he had done significant playing in New York with pianist George Wallington, and Wallington was very much a player in the style of Bud Powell. The material related to chord substitution involved a technical approach to altering the harmonic structure of a jazz standard. This was essential information for me both in general and also because Sonny would improvise his bass lines along these principles. If a player didn't have this training there was a very real chance that they would never really \"hear\" or be able to respond to what he was doing. Finally, at the very end of the lesson he challenged me by saying: \"All my students sing solos, when I studied with Lennie he let me pick the first one, and I'll do the same with you.\" (I picked Charlie Parker's solo on \"Billie's Bounce.\")\n\nThe assignment of singing a solo with a recording was new for me as I had not been \"taught\" this way before. This was liberating and also gave confidence over time in that I was learning and internalizing some of the great recorded jazz literature by ear and then would learn to play the same material. In that two-week period I not only learned to sing the solo but also went ahead and taught myself to play it on the guitar and piano and felt I was well-prepared for my next lesson.\n\nCharlie Parker\n\nThe lessons with Sonny went on this way for some time and I felt I was making great progress as a result. I was also growing as a player through the weekly sessions we were having with Jim, and it was a standard practice then for us to spend a bit of time listening and conversing each week before we started playing. The listening could be casual, such as when one of us may have heard a new recording and brought it with us, or it could be quite detailed when listening to classic jazz recordings. This was definitely the case with recordings of Lester Young and Charlie Parker (I'll also refer to them by their jazz nicknames of Prez and Bird). Regarding Bird, at that time (the pre-CD era) there still weren't a lot of his recordings available, and in fact a double-LP reissue of his Savoy Records master sessions from the 1940's (including the take of \"Billie's Bounce\" that I learned) had come out toward the end of my last semester at William Paterson. However, it was at the sessions at Sonny's that I first heard the set of famous recordings that Bird had made for Dial Records, also in the later 1940's. I was captivated by these recordings, and most especially Bird's treatment of the several ballads that he played. For myself and many others, his sensitivity, lyrical flow of ideas, and depth of feeling in playing ballads are unsurpassed. I remember one night that we were listening to some of the Dial tracks (\"Bird of Paradise,\" \"Embraceable You,\" \"How Deep is the Ocean,\" etc. ) and the recording of \"Out of Nowhere\" came on. After we listened once through (we were listening to a cassette copy) Sonny sat next to the cassette player and rewound the tape. He then would stop frequently as he replayed the tape, highlighting and replaying certain phrases, singing the phrases, and sharing his thoughts on what made Bird such a great player. Not only did my ears grow immeasurably through experiences like this, but on a deeper level I fell in love with those recordings and also with Bird as a jazz artist and musical figure.\n\nCharlie Parker\n\nCharlie Parker: \"Out of Nowhere\"/Dial Records\n\nI learned several of his solos later in my studies, but to bring this story back around to Warne Marsh I had a similar experience through the course of 1981 with his recorded music and my appreciation of his stature as a jazz artist.\n\nWarne Marsh\n\nWarne did become a favorite subject of our pre-session listening in 1981, but let me first backtrack in my narrative timeline. After Sonny gave his recommendation that I study with Warne I thought about it and at home the next day again took out \"The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Jazz.\" I found this entry on Warne Marsh:\n\nBorn 1927 in Los Angeles, tenor-man Warne Marsh is a disciple of Lennie Tristano's 'Cool School'. Making his debut with altoist Lee Konitz and leader Tristano on the celebrated Capitol sessions of 1949, Marsh's work is characterized by great rhythmic subtlety, a pale sound, and long, looping lines that plait with those of Konitz. For many years, he recorded solely with other Tristanoites, preferring – like his mentor – to perfect his playing in isolation rather than compromise with the commercial world of the jazz club. … A master of inflection, his curiously-wrought lines seem to challenge every convention while exhibiting a highly personal sense of balance. Sinuous, yet never declamatory in the currently fashionable style, Warne Marsh has yet to receive the recognition he deserves. …\n\nfrom left to right – Warne Marsh, Peter Ind, Lennie Tristano, Jeff Morton, photo taken in Lennie Tristano's studio in the early 1950's\n\nI thought this was both an interesting and intriguing appraisal, and couldn't find a description quite like it pertaining to any other jazz musician in the book. I decided then that I needed to get to know Warne's playing for myself and went to the local record store to look for some of his recordings. These are a little easier to locate currently, but in late 1980 there were not many of his records available. However, I had some luck and came home with two LP's: \"Warne Out\" and also \"Jazz Exchange Vol. 1: The Warne Marsh Quintet featuring Lee Konitz and Niels Henning Orsted Pedersen.\" I immediately put on \"Warne Out\" and had the first of many moments that continue to occur when I listen to Warne: what I heard not only identified him as a highly skilled improviser, but also as one of the most unique players that I had encountered. The LP is a trio recording made in Los Angeles in the later 1970's with Warne joined by Jim Hughart on bass and Nick Ceroli on drums. This is a spare setting, however it was obvious that nothing was missing in terms of other instruments. The first track is cleverly titled \"Loco 47\" (Local 47 is the Los Angeles chapter of the Musicians Union) and is an improvisation on the harmonic structure of the song \"This Can't Be Love.\" Warne begins by playing a relatively simple melody, and then goes on to improvise several choruses that sound to my ears to be an example of spontaneous playing of the highest order. Beyond that, it just \"sounds right\" in a way that defies any verbal analysis or explanation, and shares this quality that I believe is inherent in all great jazz performances either recorded or live. One element I also noticed was a rhythmic command and freedom much like the first track of Lennie Tristano that I heard at Sonny's house, however it seemed that Warne went even further than moving the implied downbeat back and forth. There are phrases that he improvises in polyrhythm over the basic time that Jim and Nick provide, as well as phrases that toy with the overall sense of meter in a playful way but always come back to the correct spot in the form. Finally, Warne's sound and 'concept' in some way revealed a healthy 'sense of humor' to me. This is a term that I used to hear in reference to jazz improvising, and while it is difficult to define I believe that \"Loco 47\" amply displays it. Over the years I have developed an internal personal \"short list\" of greatest recorded examples of Warne's playing, and \"Loco 47\" is definitely on that list.\n\nWarne Marsh: \"Loco 47\"/Warne Out, Interplay Records, with Jim Hughart, bass, Nick Ceroli, drums, 1977\n\nIn contrast, the Jazz Exchange LP was recorded live in a jazz club in Copenhagen in December of 1975 and features a quintet of Warne and Lee together with three Danish musicians led by the well-known bassist Niels Pedersen. Historically this time marked Warne's first visit to Europe, a reunion with Lee after about a decade of not playing together, and also the beginning of regular visits to Europe for the balance of his life. The material features compositions by Lennie Tristano, Lee, and Warne as well, and I also include his solo from \"Blues for Lester\" from this LP on my \"short list.\" To me this performance also captures Warne at his commanding best and features a unique quote of the song \"Would You Like to Wish on a Star?\" placed in an unusual spot in the form.\n\nWarne Marsh: Solo on \"Blues for Lester\"/Jazz Exchange Vol. 1, Storyville Records, Copenhagen, December 1975\n\nOnce I had bought these records I brought them to our next session and remember asking Sonny as we listened to \"Loco 47\" - \"Son, is that a head that Warne wrote?\" His response surprised me – \"no, he's improvising. Warne can improvise a line that sounds like he sat there composing it for hours before he played it.\" Sonny loved the recording and especially the saxophone/bass/drums trio format because of its simplicity (it reminded him of a widely acclaimed LP named \"Motion\" that he recorded with Lee Konitz and drummer Elvin Jones in 1961). However, to return to the account of our listening sessions, the one recording of Warne's that we ended up listening to for many hours was called \"The Art of Improvising, Vol. 1.\" This recording had very small distribution when released and has not been available for many years.\n\nThe Art of Improvising\n\nWhen Sonny first brought out his copy of \"The Art of Improvising\" I was quite intrigued: in terms of format \"The Art of Improvising\" consists of twenty relatively short tracks that for the most part are edited jazz performances of Warne that were recorded live during an engagement at The Half Note jazz club in New York City in 1959. More specifically, on most of the tracks there is a quick fade in and out at the beginning and end and everything other than Warne's solo is removed. (There are a few tracks where Lee plays simultaneously with Warne. )\n\nWhen we first started listening to this record I was somewhat mystified, as I had never heard any like this before. Some of my first impressions were that Warne's style at that time was entirely unique (as it was throughout his career), and though his sound reminded me of some players (notably Lester Young), it was unlike any I had heard. Also, his approach to the material was much the same as in the trio recording I had purchased, although he was a much younger man when these recordings were made and his sound or tone was lighter. He had a very free approach rhythmically, but also exhibited a highly subtle sense of jazz swing. One other thing I noticed was the consistency of the performances – though some of the individual phrases or entire solos stood out slightly as being very inspired, he operated on a high level of performance throughout that never resorted to cliché or self-parody and yet was firmly rooted in the tradition of jazz as I knew it.\n\nSince the \"Art of Improvising\" was unavailable Sonny let me make a cassette of it and I listened to it frequently. Prior to playing at sessions he also would go through a similar process as when we were listening to Charlie Parker of playing one track several times, and then replaying certain phrases for deeper listening. We also later used this recording in a playful way for \"blindfold tests\": since the tracks did not feature an opening melody statement and were frequently without piano we would try to identify the harmonic structures of the songs after we hadn't listened to the tape for a couple of weeks and our ears were a little fresher. It was around that time that I also started wondering if somehow Warne's general approach could be expressed through the guitar, and decided to set myself on the path of finding out if it was indeed possible. In short, over the course of the first six or eight months of 1981 I came to regard Warne Marsh as one of the greatest living jazz improvisers, and though it took me many years to verbalize it I fell in love then with his playing and general approach to jazz.\n\nWarne Marsh: \"Indiana\"/ from The Art of Improvising Vol. 1, recorded at The Half Note, NYC, 1959, Revelation Records\n\nMy life in 1981 continued on these various paths - playing sessions, studying with Sonny, practicing, listening deeply - on a daily and weekly basis. The course of study that Sonny set for me definitely seemed to be yielding results, and I especially enjoyed the process of singing and playing recorded solos along with the other things we were doing. Along with the technical work we did in lessons Sonny shared stories of his background as a young musician in both Pittsburgh and New York. He was a gifted story teller and gave me a very real feeling and sense of \"jazz lore\" if you will, and made the jazz life palpable to me (in contrast to reading about it in a history book). Finally, along with my work in lessons I continued to acquire recordings of interest. There were two releases in 1981 that were significant to me: Atlantic records reissued major recordings of Lennie Tristano that were brought out originally in 1955 and 1962 as a two-LP set, and also released a two-LP set of live quartet recordings from 1955 that featured Lee Konitz with Lennie and had been previously unavailable. I'll address these recordings shortly, however there was an event that occurred in August of 1981 that I still vividly recall and is important to this story.\n\nThe Village Vanguard\n\nWhen living in Port Jefferson I made a habit of reading the New York Times and the Village Voice when possible. I would regularly check the listings of upcoming club and concert performances in New York and the surrounding metropolitan area in those papers and was intrigued to see a listing for the Warne Marsh/Sal Mosca Quartet in the second week of August at the Village Vanguard. Sal Mosca was a prominent jazz pianist and had been one of Lennie's foremost students in the 1940's. At that time I didn't really know his playing, but Sonny always spoke highly of Sal and was personally very fond of him although they had not seen each other in quite a while. At any rate, I had not been to the Vanguard in some time, so I made plans to go into New York (about a two-hour ride one-way) on Thursday evening August 13 and stay for the entire performance. The format then at the Vanguard was that bands would play three one-hour sets beginning at 10pm, 11:30pm, and finally at 1am, so the total night would last four hours and groups were booked for six consecutive nights from Tuesday through Sunday (Mondays were big band nights, at that time the Mel Lewis Big Band performed there regularly). I think this kind of performing intensity has been somewhat reduced these days to less sets and less nights at many clubs around the US, however as a young player in training the fact that significant musical strength and endurance was necessary to perform in this setting was not lost on me. Some other things I also always enjoyed about the Vanguard were the sense of history and the intimacy of the room. I can't imagine that the club holds much more than a hundred people, and that is with all the tables spaced fairly close together.\n\nAugust 13 turned out to be a typical hot and humid summer night in New York, and I arrived at the Vanguard and settled into a centrally located table before the music started. The band took the stage (a small bandstand surrounded by red drapes in the corner of the room) and Warne and Sal were accompanied by Frank Canino on bass and Skip Scott on drums. I didn't know anything about these players at the time, but both were young and capable and I found out later were significantly connected to the extended Lennie Tristano world – Frank was a student of Sal's, and Skip had grown up knowing Lennie (his stepfather, Dick Scott, was a jazz drummer who had played with Lennie, Warne, Sonny, and other players). I remember that the first tune was based on \"There Will Never Be Another You,\" and opened with a jazz line that was typical of Lennie's approach to small group writing (I found out later that it was \"Smog Eyes,\" and was written by tenor saxophonist Ted Brown, a well-known player and student of Lennie's in the \"early\" days). I was struck immediately by Warne's presence: in such small quarters he occupied a central location and was a commanding figure. He impressed me as a fully mature and capable statesman of jazz – he appeared to be around the age of fifty and clearly was a master. He also had some notable idiosyncrasies – one being a very relaxed persona and physical presence that incorporated a lot of free but subtle movement that expressed the music that he was playing. His dress was casual – a long-sleeve, horizontally-striped, dark colored polo shirt with the top button open, light-colored pants, and a wide brown leather belt with a large buckle. He may have been wearing sandals with socks, and his sleeves were pulled up just below the elbow. He also had what I would characterize as a combination of aristocratic and 'beatnik' bearing – Warne had short-cropped graying hair that was slightly receding and he wore a goatee, also graying, and without a moustache. His eyes were active and piercing but he often kept them closed while playing. As I listened to him over the course of the entire evening I was struck again by the absence of clichés, noticeable formulas, or self-parody, and at the time I sensed that he was exploring for four hours and taking the band and audience along with him (if they were up to the journey!). Musical thoughts or ideas would come along in the course of his playing; at times he would linger on a certain idea if it seemed to catch his interest, at others he would just keep moving, but to my ears he never repeated himself. All of it was of exceedingly high quality, and also extreme virtuosity.\n\nWarne Marsh, October 1980\n\nSal Mosca provided a striking contrast to Warne: in appearance he looked to me a little like the filmmaker Martin Scorsese and wore a light-colored short-sleeve shirt with buttons down the front. His shirt was outside his dark colored pants, and the top button was open. If Sal's dress was quite conventional (and if he were in the \"Little Italy\" section of Manhattan it would have been) his playing however was startling: to my ears it was highly abstract in just about every way, and yet struck a delicate balance of being firmly rooted in the jazz tradition. It was clear to me that night and still today that I have never heard a player that sounds like Sal Mosca, and this is a very difficult feat to achieve. One piece that evening that I still remember was a duet that Warne and Sal performed of the jazz standard \"You Go to My Head,\" and it was extraordinary. It took me some time to recognize the underlying structure since the melody was never stated by either player, and the best description I can offer is that it sounded every bit as \"contemporary\" as the 20th century classical music I was studying in graduate school, and yet was an improvised jazz performance. Some of the other pieces I remember were compositions of Lennie Tristano's that I knew – \"317 E. 32nd\" and \"Lennie-Bird,\" and there were also two performances that featured Warne that were memorable: a saxophone-bass-drums trio performance of the standard \"I Love You,\" and also a very fast reading of \"Cherokee.\" I really could not get enough and the music had a cumulative mind-altering effect on me that left me euphoric by the end of the night.\n\nSal Mosca, October 1980\n\nThere was also a personal element to the evening in that I had a brief conversation with Warne. I summoned up the courage to approach him on a break, and given the close quarters of the Vanguard the performers essentially have no refuge as they enter and exit the stage area. I think it was after the second set that I decided to introduce myself and engaged him as he was heading toward the kitchen. I forget exactly what I said, but it was something very complimentary, and I believe his response was a quick and soft \"thanks man\" as he kept walking. I then said as he continued walking away from me, \"by the way, I'm a guitarist and I play with Sonny Dallas.\"Warne had known Sonny for almost twenty-five years at that point and they had both been members of Lennie Tristano's most commercially successful jazz group in the 1960's. He had also first recruited Sonny to play with Lennie in 1959 (they started with club performances in New York and then went on a US tour as a quintet with Lee Konitz with the Newport Jazz All-Stars that summer). Once I mentioned Sonny's name Warne quickly stopped, turned, and looked at me in a way I would later become accustomed to: I had the feeling that he was staring directly inside of me! There was a momentary silence, in retrospect it really wasn't a long moment, but it certainly seemed longer, and he finally said \"oh yeah? … Is Sonny still playing the Fender? \"(Warne was referring to the electric bass that Sonny played at the time as opposed to the acoustic bass that he played earlier in his career. ) I responded, \"yes he is, and he sounds great. He speaks very fondly of you all the time and wanted me to say hello for him.\"Warne paused for a moment, looked at me again in that searching way, and said: \"you give Sonny my love.\" He then turned around and headed toward the kitchen.\n\nI didn't know exactly what to make of the exchange but was glad I talked with Warne and eager to pass on both his greeting and my impressions of the evening to Sonny. After the long ride back to Port Jefferson I arrived home around 4am and clearly remember getting up late the next morning and feeling filled with a euphoria that was still with me. I thought that if I could, I would go back that night and do it all over again. It turns out I could not, both because I had a commercial gig of my own to play and also because it was a fairly grueling eight-hour trip that took some planning. That said, I was powerfully affected by the experience and couldn't wait to tell Sonny about it. We spoke the next day and he was glad to hear that Warne had sent his love and also that the music was of such high quality.\n\nThe Vanguard again\n\nI noticed in the Village Voice in November that Warne and Sal would be playing again at the Vanguard from the 17th through the 22nd. Because of school I didn't have the free time in November that I had in August, consequently I was only able to get in for the last night of the engagement. This was a lower-key evening than the one in August (perhaps due to being the last night of six and also a Sunday), however was very consistent with the quality that I had heard on that first night. By the time the third set came (at 1:00 am) the club was fairly empty, and I moved closer to the bandstand. I could overhear a little bit of conversation, although Warne and Sal didn't talk much at all, and the only person who would address the audience was Warne when he would introduce the players at the end of each set. As the time neared 2am I realized there would probably be only one more tune, and at that point the rhythm section (Frank Canino and Skip Scott again) launched into a fast blues. Warne started playing alone with them (Sal did not enter for some time) and started quietly building a solo that gradually increased intensity. This went on for some time and I remember having the distinct feeling that he was overtaken by some force that moved his playing from excellent to inspired. There was a look in his eyes of being somewhere else, and not focused in his vision on anything specific in the room. This is difficult to explain in words, but it was a very powerful experience and I had the sense during that final tune that we were privileged to be hearing one of the great living jazz players at a moment of highest inspiration.\n\nWarne Marsh/Sal Mosca Quartet: \"Blues\"/Village Vanguard, November 22, 1981\n\nFor me personally I felt that somehow I was not quite the same after witnessing that last performance of Warne's. It reminded me of a rare recording that Sonny had shared with me of a solo that Warne had played on the tune \"Cherokee\" when he was with the band called \"Supersax.\" (Supersax featured arrangements of Charlie Parker's solos for five saxophonists and rhythm section and would also feature the members as soloists. The group earned a Grammy award for their first recording. ) Apparently Warne had some close friends that recorded him often in live performances, sometimes editing out the other players much like some private recordings of Charlie Parker. The solo is brilliant and stunning, it is taken at a breakneck tempo and yet the flow of ideas from Warne seems utterly unaffected by the speed. He weaves in and out of the rhythm, and even at that high speed plays very much \"within the time.\" It was clear to me from hearing this one solo, recorded perhaps sometime between 1972 and 1975, that at any moment Warne could elevate his playing to a level well beyond any that I had heard. I knew that night that I and the small audience at the Vanguard had the good fortune to experience one of those moments with him.\n\nWarne Marsh with Supersax: \"Cherokee\"/date and location not exact, but in the mid 1970's\n\nWYRS\n\nIn the fall of 1981 I also became aware of a new local jazz radio station - WYRS-FM - which broadcast from Stamford, Connecticut and was able to reach listeners on Long Island. The program director was Rick Petrone, who was also a working bass player, and along with playing a lot of good music there were historical segments on the great figures in jazz as well as interviews with local well-known players. Sometime that November Sonny called and told me excitedly that he had phoned the station about a recording and was invited by Rick to do an interview on December 1st. I listened that evening from home and the interview started with Rick playing a track from Lennie Tristano's LP \"Descent Into the Maelstrom.\"The conversation was marked by an audible familiarity, perhaps because both Sonny and Rick were bass players. Sonny began by talking about his friendship with Lennie and tried to dispel what he considered to be prevailing myths regarding Lennie's temperament and his approach to playing and teaching jazz.\n\nSonny Dallas: Interview excerpt 1/ Commentary on Lennie Tristano, WYRS-FM, Rick Petrone, host, December 1, 1981\n\nSonny Dallas: Interview excerpt 2/ Commentary on Lennie's lack of exposure\n\nRick also featured tracks from Sonny's recordings with Lee Konitz (\"Motion\" and \"You and Lee\") and Phil Woods (\"Warm Woods\" and \"Phil Talks With Quill\") as well as the Lennie Tristano Quintet recorded live at The Half Note in New York in 1964. I was happy that Sonny was getting attention from the station and Rick, and Sonny took many phone calls from listeners while at the studio.\n\nSonny Dallas: Interview excerpt 3/Commentary on first gig with Lennie\n\nLennie Tristano Quintet: \"Subconscious Lee\" (Lee Konitz)/ recorded live at the Half Note, NYC, June 1964 (video clip)\n\nSonny Dallas, Warne Marsh, Lennie Tristano, Lee Konitz at The Half Note, New York, June 1964 (Nick Stabulas not pictured)\n\nI heard a real surprise as I was listening again to WYRS later that week though: Warne Marsh was scheduled to do a similar interview on December 8. This must have been a hastily arranged date because Sonny hadn't heard of it when he was there, and was as surprised as I when it was announced. It turned out that I couldn't be home to hear the interview when it was broadcast but Leslie offered to record it on cassettes.\n\nI had been out at a rehearsal and didn't get home until after the interview was finished, but Leslie confirmed that she had made the cassettes and I decided to stay up and listen. I was quite amazed by what I heard: first of all, the character of the dialogue, at least in the first thirty to forty-five minutes, was quite different from Sonny's interview. While I think that both Warne and Sonny were possibly a little nervous, or at the very least had to overcome the inertia of getting started, Sonny struck me as more approachable. That said, the tone with Warne was serious from the start, and the first topic that was addressed was Lennie Tristano. The interview began with a live recording of Lennie's group playing \"Indiana\" at Birdland in 1949 and featured a wonderful solo by Warne. The line of questioning that Rick took in this part of the interview was directed at getting Warne to share his thoughts as to why the band enjoyed little commercial success or recognition in the jazz community. These were difficult topics, and contributed to the serious character of the dialogue. Warne's brief but well-considered comments also heightened the seriousness. For example, Rick kept prodding Warne as to why the band had endured years of obscurity in the 1950's, and his response was a slightly heated: \"do you have an answer?\" The conversation seemed to relax though as they got more into the interview, and Warne mentioned early on that one of his outstanding memories of \"the past\" was \"Lee Konitz – how beautiful he sounded.\" He also summed up his view of the best way to approach Lennie Tristano: that in his thinking Lennie was \"simply a very well-informed musician\" and also \"heart and soul with the great traditions of jazz.\" In speaking directly about Lennie's sextet in the 1940's Warne made the understatement that the group was \"well-rehearsed\" and that Lennie encouraged and trained the players to both fully realize their individual potential and competence, and also to function as a group to the best of their abilities. Regarding his early studies Warne noted that \"Lennie was very heavy on this matter of individual competence.\" He also mentioned that Lennie's attitude toward recording was that they needed to be aware that a document was being created that should \"stand the test of time.\" This explained why so few of his recordings were released, however those that came out are generally regarded as being of exceedingly high quality.\n\nWarne Marsh: Interview excerpt 1/ Commentary contrasting Charlie Parker and Lennie Tristano, WYRS-FM, Rick Petrone, host, December 8, 1981\n\nAs the interview proceeded Warne also addressed some of Lennie's philosophies of teaching, and Rick brought up the specific matter of singing solos with recordings. This was in the context of commentary on a recording that Warne had done in Los Angeles in the mid-1950's of Lester Young's composition \"Tickletoe\" with alto saxophonist Art Pepper. Rick asked why a student should sing a solo, and also whether Warne thought there could be a danger in copying the player being studied. Warne's response was that Lennie encouraged a student to abandon themselves to their influences, and more specifically that if a student was sufficiently moved by an artist's work then he or she should \"allow themselves to be as completely influenced by a player as possible.\" However the next step for a student was the real test, and that was to let go of those influences after internalizing them and have the \"courage\" and trust to express their own voice. Warne went further on this point: \"it's like this – each of us has his own melody in us somewhere, and the point of education is to crystallize it, to bring it to the surface …\" As the interview proceeded this concept of the importance of the individual voice became a central point, as well as the worthiness of the pursuit of jazz performance and improvisation as artistic endeavors. He also made it clear that in his view jazz as an art form was rebalancing some of the trends in music in general back toward spontaneous playing. He contrasted the intimate small jazz group as a unit where players needed to \"think for themselves\" with the standard modern symphony orchestra of over one hundred players with essentially one person \"doing the thinking for everyone.\" Finally, and this is a subjective impression, I heard in Warne's responses and explanations a very clear conviction that not only was the pursuit of jazz as an art a highly worthy and noble activity, but also that for him there was clearly no other path in life.\n\nWarne Marsh: Interview excerpt 2/ Commentary on his influences\n\nTwo other points in the interview also caught my attention: the first was Warne's response to a question that hypothesized Rick being a young music student newly arrived in New York from a distant location and overwhelmed by the choices available. The question to Warne was simple - \"what would you tell me to do?\" Warne's response was that he would advise that person \"to listen to everything you can, and learn to discriminate. \" He went on to say that when he was a young player in that situation the choices were clear: \"in the 40's there were two kinds of jazz available in New York – Bebop and Dixieland. \" Though he didn't mention all the other trends that had come and gone since then he made it clear that his musical values were formed at that time through his experiences in studying and performing with Lennie Tristano, his exposure to Charlie Parker and Lester Young both live and in recordings, and in his study of the music of Bach and Bartok. He noted that \"if Lee and I have had any success it's largely due to sticking with something for thirty years.\"\n\nWarne Marsh: Interview excerpt 3/ Commentary on rapport with Lee Konitz and individuality\n\nLee Konitz and Warne Marsh: \"Subconscious Lee\" (Lee Konitz)/ excerpt from NBC-TV broadcast \"The Subject Is Jazz\", 1958 (video clip)\n\nHis final thought on this question was to \"not be afraid to look back. \" He mentioned that the great influences in jazz were all still very much with us, even if only through recordings.\n\nThe last point that caught my attention came at the end of the interview and was in response to a casual question about Warne's current students. He had noted that since the 1970's teachers such as he and Sal Mosca had noticed a change in the student population in that the newer generation of students were \"taking it all seriously and wanting to dig deeper than what's available in rock and roll. \" In specific response to Rick's question Warne mentioned that the task of \"presenting a student properly\" was a concern for Lennie, and he took it seriously as well. He mentioned a few of his current students - vocalists Judy Niemack and Janet Lawson, tenor saxophonist Jimmy Halperin - and then … the tape ran out! I sat there amazed at what I had just heard for the last two hours, and instantly knew not only that I had to study with Warne Marsh, but also somehow that I would. What remained to be seen was how that was actually going to happen.\n\nIII. 1982\n\nThe early winter of 1981/82 moved along for me in a somewhat \"normal\" fashion however there was a special event that January: a performance at Gulliver's, a jazz club in West Paterson, New Jersey. This was one of the clubs that was close to where I had grown up and along with attracting some major talent on weekends there was also a regular Monday \"Guitar Night\" that was an established tradition and had received attention in national magazines. The schedule was structured so that major players (Jim Hall, Joe Pass, Pat Martino, etc. ) were alternated with local veterans and younger promising players and Bob DeVos had recommended me to the owner (Amos) for a Monday night gig. It was scheduled for late in January and I asked a marvelous pianist and old friend named Rave Tesar to perform with me. We rehearsed a few times and played the gig, but we had been playing semi-regularly for several years so were quite comfortable with each other. On the night of the gig the weather was slightly treacherous because of a snowstorm that weekend but there was still a good crowd and the evening was probably the high point in my life as a performer up to then.\n\ncopy of calendar from Gulliver's in West Paterson, NJ, Jan/Feb 1982\n\nAfter this performance was over I settled back into my routines but during those first couple of months of 1982 a plan also occurred to me as I surveyed the calendar for the year: the school semester would be finished at the very beginning of May, and I thought that I might contact Warne and ask if he would take me as a student for the summer. I decided to bring this up with Sonny but had some trepidation about it due to the strength of the bond we had established. It turned out that in March we were hired to play at a private party as sidemen by a local pianist who called us occasionally, and on one of the breaks I was sitting alone with Sonny. I remember looking over at him during a quiet moment and saying, \"Son, I'm thinking about going into New York and studying with Warne, what do you think?\" He sat quietly for a few moments (which was unusual for Sonny), and then said in a soft voice: \"that's great man, I'll be interested to see what he can do for you.\" The heaviness of the moment was palpable and I decided not to press it. I realized that his response was in stark contrast to what he had said when he first recommended that I study with Warne, but so much had happened with us since then that obviously the entire nature of our relationship had changed. I left the topic by saying that I was thinking of calling Warne when the semester ended and would ask for his phone number then. Around that time I also remember seeing an occasional small ad in the music classifieds of the Village Voice, and it looked something like this:\n\nI remember going to see Sonny for a lesson on a Saturday in later April and singing Lennie's solo from the recording \"Line Up\" both with the recording and with him accompanying me on the electric piano. I also played very well and decided to take advantage of the momentum by bringing up the subject again of studying with Warne. His response this time was quite different: \"you're definitely ready man, Warne is going to love you!\" He then gave me two phone numbers: Warne's home in Ridgefield, Connecticut and also his studio at the Bretton Hall Hotel in Manhattan. As I left Sonny that day he said that I was going with his full blessing. I thanked him, but it was difficult to fully express how much I appreciated his support and generosity, and also his facilitation of my journey. I didn't know at all how things would go with Warne, and in fact was somewhat terrified of what I was about to do both because I felt that I realized his stature as an artist and also was quite intimidated by what he had achieved. That said, I called him in Connecticut late that afternoon. I was extremely nervous, but with a jittery voice introduced myself and said I had met him at the Vanguard in August, was playing and studying with Sonny and would like to come for a lesson if possible. He said that would be fine and that the first lesson was more of an interview and would be free. We set a date for 3:00 in the afternoon of Monday May 3 at Bretton Hall; it was difficult to think of much else before then, but finally that Monday arrived.\n\nBretton Hall – May, 1982 – the first lesson with Warne\n\nBretton Hall Hotel – Broadway between 85th and 86th Streets, New York City (the circled window was Warne's studio)\n\nLetter to Jack Goodwin dated October 15, 1999: (excerpt)\n\nHi Jack:\n\n… I quite agree with you that Warne's work has grown in stature in my mind over the past twelve years, which I didn't think was possible. I'm going to attempt to reconstruct my story, in bits and pieces, because it's fairly long. Fairly soon after I met Sonny, I thought about studying jazz again. I had actually been a \"jazz major\" in college, which in retrospect seems absurd, but I went on to graduate school on Long Island to study classical composition and all that it entails. I didn't think a lot about jazz for those two years, but then I met Sonny, and got really excited about what we were doing. I mentioned one night that I was thinking about studying again, and he asked who with. I replied either Jim Hall or Phil Woods, but I didn't know if either of them taught or would take me as a student. His reply was that if he were young and looking to study there was only one person in the world he would consider. My interest piqued, I asked who that would be. \"Warne Marsh – he's the greatest improviser in the world and I've got his phone number.\" I told him I would think about it. This had to be in late 1980. We had made a recording in January '81 and I thought I played horribly, so I asked him if he would take me as a student. We started working, and he really helped me. I had never sung solos with records before that, and I really got into it with Sonny. I still think that is the quickest way to make sweeping changes in your \"concept\" – to sing and then play a solo on your instrument. We did Lester Young, Bird, Lee, Warne, I learned to sing and play \"Requiem,\" and after a little more than a year I started working on \"Line-Up.\" During that time though I would read the Village Voice and a lot of players advertised for students in New York, and occasionally I would see a small ad that said \"Jazz Lessons – Warne Marsh. Hotel Bretton Hall, Rm. 412.\" That was it! (Talk about mysterious)I forget exactly when, but over a period of time I decided I was going to go study with Warne in New York, which was frightening to me. I thought he was the greatest jazz player I had ever heard, so to have the chance to actually study with Warne was a little surreal. I was enrolled in the Ph. D. program in the University at the time, the semester was ending at the beginning of May, and I resolved to seek out Warne. If things went well I would study with him over the summer and see how things looked at that point.\n\nI remember it was maybe March of that year that Sonny and I were playing a gig and I mentioned that I was planning to go see Warne. He seemed crushed – he got really quiet, and said \"that's great man – I'd like to see what he could do for you.\" It was an awkward moment, but I had a lesson with him in maybe the middle of April, and sang \"Line Up\" note for note with Lennie. We were both in great spirits, so right before I left I said \"Son, I think I want to go see Warne, do you still have his number?\" He said \"man, you've earned it\" and I went in with his blessing. So I called Warne in Connecticut -he divided his time between there and New York - and set up a lesson for Monday May 3 at 3pm in New York.\n\nI lived about 50 miles from New York, so I left at around 1:00 that afternoon, and was really nervous. I got there and Bretton Hall was a large old hotel that I learned was a low-rent situation with lots of artists as residents. Warne's rent was $60 a week, I think. I took the elevator to the fourth floor, got out and walked to my left down a hallway maybe thirty yards, and as I walked farther down the hall heard the unmistakable sound of Warne playing – something very free, out of tempo, it sounded like he was working with material around the tonic chord in a minor key. I couldn't believe what I was about to do, but took a deep breath and knocked on the door. The playing stopped, the door opened, and there was Warne. He eyed me and said \"do we have an appointment?\" I said yes, we had talked on the phone when he was in Connecticut, and that I was Sonny's friend. He invited me in and I walked into a large room, old, with at least a 12 foot ceiling, and probably 20 or so feet across and 30 or so feet long, with a good sized window that looked out on Broadway, opposite from where the door was. There was a piano on the left against the wall as soon as you walked in, an old Steinway upright that was pretty good. Above it was a long rectangular black and white print that was yellowed with age of a violin student apparently taking a music lesson, with people listening while they sat and waited. I later learned this was a well-known picture and was a depiction of Liszt's studio, probably in Paris sometime around 1870 or so. It contributed to the room's old, nineteenth century feeling. To my right was a mattress propped against the wall, this was apparently where Warne slept. There was a good-sized open space in the middle of the room, with an old rug on the floor, and toward the window, an old drum set. In the corner to the right of the drums Warne had what looked like a small old kitchen table against the wall which served as a desk, and to the left of the drums was a really old sink, stove, and refrigerator unit that gave the place the feeling of a tenement in Harlem. Behind the drums if my memory is right I think you could actually sit on a ledge to look out the window. I think there was also a microphone on a stand in the middle of the room, and a TEAC 4-track tape recorder sitting propped up on a chair. On the wall nearest the door was a bulletin board of sorts: I think there was a notice for a gig for the Carla White/Manny Duran Quintet and also two photo portraits of a couple of boys, and I assumed they were Warne's sons. I asked Warne if I could use the bathroom, and he said it was down the hall and to the right. I walked all the way down the hall past the elevator, then turned right and walked another 30 or 40 yards to get to the bathroom, which was pretty bad and I think had a small flood on the floor because the shower overflowed. I remember being afraid I would get robbed in that place, and also I couldn't believe that Warne Marsh was actually living like this. But I mustered up some courage, and put off any other judgments, and headed back to his room.\n\nOnce back in we made a little bit of small talk, ask someone who knew Warne what that was like! He was exceedingly quiet, almost brooding. I think he made himself some coffee and while doing that asked if Sonny had said anything to me about a book that he wanted to write. I said yes, he mentioned in passing that he would like to collaborate on a book with Warne and Lee on jazz improvisation. Warne asked me what I thought of the idea. I said \"based on what I know about you, my guess is that you probably wouldn't be interested in writing any books.\" He paused and then said slowly: \"that's right man – my book is in my head.\" I forget what happened next, but I think we talked a little bit more, I think he asked what he could do for me, or what I wanted from him. I said that first I didn't really have an agenda, I just wanted to be a better improviser, and would take whatever advice he could give me. I did say though, that I heard something in his and Lennie's playing that really intrigued me: it was the ability to turn the beat around at will, and if he could explain any of that to me I would appreciate it. This was when he explained the concept of the meter studies to me for the first time, and also how Lennie's lines were composed. That discussion took several minutes, and next he said he needed to hear me play, alone, and with the metronome. I said OK, and decided to play, I think, \"You Stepped Out of a Dream.\" I asked if he wanted to hear the melody, he said it was up to me, but not really. So I played a couple of choruses, and not too bad. While I played he mostly stood with his back to me looking out the window, and when I finished he stayed there for what seemed like forever. He finally turned around and said \"… you sound good man, in fact, you don't really need to study with me. …I like the way you play with a lot of downstrokes – I require that of all my guitar players. …But … there's a place for you to go … the only thing is, if you go there, you can't come back. Your assignment this week is to think about whether you want to go there or not.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say! But he was very serious, and I took him seriously. I did say that I didn't consciously think about the downstrokes, it just came out that way. He said he got into some pretty serious arguments with his guitar students over it, but that was the way it had to be. (Charlie Christian played with something like 90% downstrokes. )Warne's comment was that he didn't see how a player could play two consecutive notes with a different technique – to him every note had to get the same amount of weight. I think I asked him what I should practice, and he gave me my first assignments in the meter work, and told me to spend about half my practice time slow improvising, and to play standing up, it helped you get looser (I had sat in a chair while playing for him). The hour was about up, and a young girl came in towards the end with what looked like an alto case. Before I left though I told him that I was prepared to sing Lennie's solo on \"Line-Up.\" He eyed me again and said \"Yeah?\" He put the tape in and I did it. He had his back to me again, and turned around quicker this time and said \"Yeah, John.\" (I told Sonny this later and he said \"Warne said 'Yeah'? Oh, then he really dug you man!\") It seemed that the hour was much more a real lesson than an audition or interview, so I asked Warne if I owed him any money and he said if I decided to study I would owe him for a lesson, if I didn't then I didn't owe him anything. I was feeling pretty excited at that point, like I had met some kind of challenge that I had set for myself, although with a million more questions as a result, so I set up another date with him. He said he really wanted me to think about it before coming back, but if I did it would have to be weekly for at least a while, so we made a time for the following week.\n\nSo that was basically my first lesson, Jack, you already know the outcome, but I will continue with some details and how everything progressed in future e-mails. All I can say is, was Warne ever right – once you go there you can't come back!\n\nFollow up letter to Jack Goodwin dated October 28, 1999: (excerpt)\n\nHi Jack:\n\n… two further brief impressions … the whole environment at Bretton Hall was somewhat frightening at first, but I felt safe there pretty quickly. I started going in for lessons in the evening after that first one. It made the drive a little easier because of less traffic, and I enjoyed being in New York at night. Also, there was one small detail that I forgot to mention about the room that always caught my eye – there was an old, tall, standing lamp in the left corner opposite the door and near the sink that had no shade, just an exposed bulb. Somehow Warne rigged a small saucepan up at the top to serve as an improvised shade. It was quite bohemian, and every time I looked at that lamp with the saucepan shade I had to smile, and I still can picture it. It served as a reminder of what the really important things were that were happening in that room.\n\nRegarding these two letter excerpts, I had struck up an acquaintance and close virtual friendship with Jack Goodwin in August of 1999, and I came to know Jack through the author Safford Chamberlain. I remember having a conversation with Safford around that time, and he made a passing mention of cassettes that were being passed around. I asked if he knew of anyone I could contact who might be interested in trading some recordings. Safford suggested that I contact Jack, and said that he had helped him with a complete discography of Warne's work that was to be included in his book. He gave me Jack's physical and email addresses, and I contacted him with an introductory email. I heard back from him within a day, and we struck up a fast and close friendship that continues to the present. It turned out that he had a large collection of unreleased recordings of Warne that dated back to the 1940's and continued up to his last recorded performances at the end of 1987. Jack had been an admirer of Lennie Tristano since 1950 or so, and also all the players involved with Lennie by extension, but as a result of a lot of concentrated and critical listening had come around to the assessment that Warne was a unique and gifted artist in the pantheon of jazz greats. We started exchanging recordings, and this began a second, more recent, stage of my study of Warne's music. I will draw on what I have learned through this study, and it has given me a bigger frame and perspective to the work I did together with Warne as teacher and student when he was alive. For now though, let me pick up the thread of that first lesson and what came next as a result of it.\n\nThe first three months of study\n\nThere is a good deal of technically oriented material drawn from the first two months of lessons in the section on meter studies in Part II, and while this does not tell the whole story there are significant aspects that I won't repeat as this section of the text and the technical section will start to dovetail. As far as the structure of what I experienced, in retrospect it is clear to me that there was a first stage of my studies that lasted until roughly the end of July. At that point Warne let me know that he would be in Europe performing for a few weeks and back in later August. In the larger sequence of events I went from starting the lessons in early May, to actually playing with Warne for the first time in late June, and then performing with him at an impromptu event in New York about a month later.\n\nIn the aftermath of the first lesson I plunged into the various assignments and two specific items were quite new to me: the meter studies and slow improvising. As far as the meter work was concerned the first week was quite frustrating. In contrast though, the discipline or activity of slow improvising was in many ways revelatory for me. I had never practiced this way at any length before, but it made perfect sense as Warne explained it. So slow improvising ultimately became the one activity that I started doing then, and in fact still do, that uniquely integrated everything I was working on, however put the focus clearly on spontaneous individual performance. I would perform in this way at each lesson for Warne, and always felt from him that he was listening intently to everything I was doing, and aware of much more than I was capable of at that time. Warne could be stern, and the first basic admonishment/criticism he made came not in a specific statement about something I played, but a more general one: after I played for him in the second lesson he said with some intensity that \"improvising is not about playing licks.\" This was one of those statements that I thought a lot about afterward, and certainly all the way home. While it seems basic and obvious that any improvised solo is being created spontaneously, another side to the issue is that much of jazz teaching then and probably now is oriented to learning pre-set patterns and/or \"licks\" that are mastered in various ways, and then reassembled by a player in the course of a solo. There are well-known players who have gone to the point of stating that their \"method\" consists of working over a handful of favorite licks in this way, along with adding spontaneous connecting material. Some of Sonny's teaching to me was oriented along these lines, but to be fair to him it was with the intent of having me develop an improvisational \"concept\" that was more rooted in the work of the great players of the past. That said, I, and many young players I'm sure, would resort to these patterns or licks too often. When a player makes that decision internally they are not being truly spontaneous, and in fact must be somewhat conscious about what they are doing. Warne was aware of this immediately, and would have none of it. The key component to being truly spontaneous though seems to me to be an attitude - or perhaps commitment is a better word - to create music that we have not created before. As I grew to understand and appreciate this notion I also realized that practicing in this way served as a vehicle for experiencing creativity on a daily basis, and also as a means to develop self-awareness as improvisers.\n\nMany years later I came across a recording of a broadcast of Warne performing duets with the great jazz bassist Red Mitchell in June of 1980 at the Sweet Basil jazz club in New York. Music producer Michael Cuscuna interviewed Warne briefly on one of the breaks, and he addresses this very issue in the following interview excerpt. Warne's response includes a statement that I always remember and in some ways summarizes his approach to improvising jazz: \"I never want to be so tied to ideas themselves that I can't play a continuing melody.\" My understanding of his use of the word \"ideas\" includes both pre-conceived or prepared 'licks' as well as musical-political opinions and positions.\n\nWarne Marsh: Interview excerpt/ Sweet Basil, NYC June 5, 1980, introduction by Billy Taylor\n\nI've also included \"It's You or No One,\" the first piece that Warne and Red played in the broadcast. To my ears not only is this a wonderful example of two masters arguably at the peak of their abilities, but the sound and character of Warne's playing that is captured reminds me strongly of what he sounded like when I played with him in 1982.\n\nI actually did not play with Warne for some time in my lessons. His tenor sat prominently on a stand at Bretton Hall but he did not offer or invite me to play with him for almost two months. If he needed to demonstrate something he would generally sing whatever he was talking about, or occasionally play an example on the piano. That said, in the course of getting to know each other I gave him a cassette of my performance at Gulliver's in January as I wanted him to hear me in a live gig situation and thought that those tapes were a good representation. I was quite surprised to come back the next week and find him listening to the cassette when I arrived. He was very complimentary, he said that he especially liked how \"loose\" I sounded, and he then said that the next time he would work in the area with a guitarist that he was going to use me for the gig. I couldn't quite believe my ears, and that was probably the first time (of many) that I felt the particular combination of intense excitement and intense fear at the prospect of playing with Warne.\n\nIn the second or third lesson he mentioned that I struck him as being a serious teacher and that he would be happy to discuss anything related to the topic, and so we began talking about education on a regular basis. There were two comments in particular that he made in our ensuing conversations that have remained in my memory, and I'll paraphrase the first: \"If I've made one mistake in teaching it has been to assume that a student is closer to my level of knowledge and experience than they really are.\" In response I asked what effect this had on any particular dynamic with a student and his reply was that they could be frustrated through a lack of understanding or comprehension of what he was telling them. Because of this he felt he became a better listener to what students were sharing with him, and also became more involved with the questions he would ask them in lessons. The other comment that stuck with me was surprising: \"It should only take two years to teach a student what they need to know.\" This statement was somewhat shocking to me in light of the fact that Lennie had students that stayed with him for many years, some for more than twenty years, and Sal Mosca did as well. I asked Warne about this and his response was that he was opposed to that sort of relationship, I have also heard Lee Konitz further suggest that the relationship at that point is about more than learning music. Even at that early stage of studying with Warne it was clear to me that he did not want to encourage dependence, and in fact it seemed that all the work we were doing was pointing toward independence and mastery. He would offer more information regarding teaching as he thought that I was reaching new levels of understanding over time.\n\nSo during that first ten to twelve weeks of my studies it felt like we were building a strong rapport and relationship, and I certainly took the work very seriously and had the utmost respect for Warne as a teacher and mentor. I really enjoyed my evening trips into Manhattan and subjectively thought I was making rapid progress, although in retrospect I didn't exactly feel that I consciously knew or could articulate what I was progressing toward other than being a better musician and improviser. In that way there was a palpable sweetness about being so engaged in the moment, and there was much joy contained in the newness of what I was experiencing in my studies with Warne. I could never forget what he said in the first lesson about a 'place to go,' however that 'place' remained undefined and actually we did not discuss it again. What we did discuss was music and improvising and that was enough for me.\n\nPlaying with Warne\n\nIf memory serves me correctly the first time Warne and I played together was at a lesson on a Thursday in later June. He mentioned that he was having a session the next week and asked if I was available. I froze when I heard the question, but I responded yes, however mentioned that we had not played together yet. He seemed surprised and immediately picked up his tenor, saying, \"then let's play something.\" As I recall we agreed on \"There Will Never Be Another You,\" and for many reasons (including the fact that I had never heard Warne in such close quarters before) it was an experience bordering on the magical for me. I do remember though having some doubt as to how I should ideally accompany him, so when he was soloing I chose to play a quarter-note 'comping' style that imitates what a bass player might do, and is sometimes called the \"Freddie Green style\" after the well-known guitarist with Count Basie. I thought the piece went well, and when we were finished Warne turned to me and said, \"see, we can play together. I have to get you to stop playing like a bass player though.\" We then played another tune and I imagined that there was a bass player with us, so I did not define the pulse in what I played. We were to have more detailed discussions in the fall about my role as a guitarist with him, and though my memories of those couple of weeks starting at the end of June are somewhat of a blur, I do remember being extremely excited and aware of an accelerating pace of events and involvement that seemed to be taking place.\n\nThe session was set for noon on that following Thursday, and we had scheduled my lesson for 11:00 so I needed to make an early start from Port Jefferson. Toward the end of the lesson the first player to arrive was the bassist, Earl Sauls. Earl was also from Northern New Jersey, and our paths had first crossed when I was a student at William Paterson College. He became an in-demand bass player in Northern New Jersey at that time, and I knew that he had done a lot of playing with my friend Rave Tesar. So it was surprising and comfortable to see him again, and as we conversed the other players arrived. They were a pianist named George Ziskind who was one of Warne's best friends and an excellent player, and a drummer from Copenhagen who was visiting New York at that time. I don't recall the drummer's name, but he had either played with or met Warne in Europe and Warne arranged the session essentially for him. The drummer's excitement and enthusiasm were quite contagious, and one of the memories I have is that after every tune he made some sort of statement about how he could not believe he was in New York and playing jazz with Warne Marsh. I remember being very quiet and somewhat cautious and reserved (in fact, I believe those qualities characterized my behavior throughout my studies), but also was quite amused by the drummer's incredulous comments. We played several tunes that afternoon, and Warne did offer some coaching comments. One was that he chided George and I to really listen to what each other was doing. (In retrospect this was one of the few times that I played with Warne when a pianist was present. )He mentioned that having both piano and guitar in a group required special treatment, and also a special approach on the part of the two players. In his opinion the ideal was what Lennie had done with guitarist Billy Bauer in his early groups, and in his characteristically succinct way his comment was \"Lennie and Billy did it.\" That said, I remember that some of the tunes were \"There Will Never Be Another You,\" \"317 E. 32nd,\" \"My Old Flame,\" and \"Yesterdays.\" At the end of the session the drummer produced a camera and some group photos were taken, he then announced that he was heading to another session at an address in Harlem and the rest of us chuckled and cautioned him to be careful in that neighborhood.\n\nWhen I left I traveled to New Jersey to have dinner with my parents, and was filled with impressions of the day. It seemed that once I was out of Warne's studio and alone in my car a voice in my mind echoed the drummer's comments during the session in that I had a hard time believing I had just played in a group with Warne Marsh. These experiences essentially started a new phase to our relationship, and in retrospect it was always difficult for me to play with Warne for various reasons. One was a sense that in some way I didn't really belong there, or put another way I didn't feel ready then to play with him. My strategy for managing those thoughts was to focus on the task at hand, and I did eventually become comfortable playing with him in that I came to believe that I was up to it. Acquiring that belief or confidence was a process that took some time though, and I didn't really become aware of it until a few years later when I visited him in California in February of 1986.\n\nAs I fell into somewhat of a regular schedule many of our lessons were on Thursday evenings, and occasionally I would then travel to New Jersey to visit my parents after the lesson. I had done this the week before the first session with Warne, and after having dinner I went to hear tenor saxophonist Zoot Sims leading a quartet at Gulliver's. I met my friend Bob Keller there, and also said hello to Amos, the owner of Gulliver's. During those years I tried to get there whenever I could, and had heard guitarist Harry Leahey a few weeks before on a Monday. I mentioned to Amos then that I was studying with Warne, and that he was available if Amos was interested. He was, so I gave him Warne's number, and this resulted in a weekend engagement in late July. I did not play there with him and had no expectation to, however this indirectly led to my first performance with him.\n\nThe Gramercy Park Hotel\n\nWhen I arrived at Bretton Hall for my lesson on Thursday July 22 Warne immediately asked if I was free on that Saturday. It turned out that I did have a gig, at that time I was playing a fair amount of wedding and commercial jobs on Long Island. I asked why and he said that there was going to be a party on that early evening where he had agreed to perform, but would be prior to playing later that night at Gulliver's. I started suggesting other guitarists he might contact, but his reply was \"think for you, not for me.\" It was clear from his tone that he wanted me to arrange for a substitute to cover my job so that I could do the performance with him, so I made a call from his studio and was able to find a replacement. Warne said that the gig was to be on the rooftop of the Gramercy Park Hotel in Manhattan, and that I would be part of a group that would play one set with him, and then the remainder of the evening for the party. After the details of the gig were taken care of we went on with the lesson, but it was fairly difficult to focus and contain my excitement. So, as happened a few weeks before when Warne invited me to the session with the Danish drummer, I left Bretton Hall that evening with my head spinning. This was a lesson with more than one surprise however, and once we settled down to going through my work Warne said that we needed to talk about what I was going to do for the next month. When I asked why he said that he was leaving for Europe early the next week to play some gigs, the primary one being a concert on August 12 at the North Sea Jazz Festival in a quartet with Sal Mosca. So we laid out the work I would do, and this was fairly easy as I had become grounded in the activities of slow improvising, singing and playing solos, working through the meter studies, and also composing.\n\nAfter much anticipation that Saturday I left for Manhattan in the late afternoon. I knew nothing about the gig other than that it was a wedding reception on the rooftop of the Gramercy Park, and the hours were from 7 to 11pm. When I got up to the roof I was somewhat amazed at the environment, it was a beautiful early summer evening, and we were surrounded by the skyscrapers of Manhattan.\n\nview from Gramercy Park Hotel – New York City\n\nI found out that the bride was one of Warne's students, and the other players in the band were trumpeter Simon Wettenhall, bassist George Kay, and drummer Tim Horner. I had not met any of these players before, and found out that Simon was an Australian who lived at Bretton Hall and had been a student of Warne's in Los Angeles. In the later 1970's he moved to New York in order to continue his studies and took up residence at Bretton Hall. George lived in Ossining, New York and was part of the group of younger players that I was starting to meet. Eventually we did quite a bit of playing together with Warne. Tim lived in Brooklyn and was working then with jazz vocalist Helen Merrill, and he was clearly a seasoned player. Regarding the gig, as Warne had described to me we were going to play one set with him as a quintet, and then he was leaving for Gulliver's. The rest of us would then perform until 11pm as a quartet. So the first set was a mini-concert, and on the rooftop of what seemed like quite a special place on that early summer evening in Manhattan. I don't recall all of what we played, however we began with \"It's You or No One,\" this was a standard practice with Warne (I found out later that he often opened with this tune for Lennie and also because Lennie would start many of his gigs with it). I do remember that we played Lennie's piece \"317 E. 32nd,\" and also the ballad \"Lover Man.\" There was great spirit and energy, and this continued for the rest of the evening after Warne had left.\n\nAugust 18, 1982\n\nThe phone rang early in the morning, and I was surprised to hear Warne's voice on the other end: \"Yeah, John!\" \"Warne? How are you man, when did you get back from Europe?\" The conversation went on from there, and he had called to invite me to a session that afternoon however I was unable to get to New York on short notice. He then asked if I could come in the next day, and I could, so he scheduled the session for 1:30 in the afternoon at Bretton Hall. Our conversation was brief, and I may have been woken up by the phone ringing so was not entirely awake. In contrast Warne sounded very awake, and I thought that he may have still been on European time, and in fact had returned to New York either the day before or on that Monday. He said the concert with Sal Mosca was fine and we would talk more the next day, but I mentioned that I had been to a session at Sonny's the night before and played with tenor saxophonist Jimmy Halperin for the first time. Warne knew him well as Jimmy had studied with Lennie as a teenager in the later 1970's and was currently studying with Sal.\n\nThe prior few weeks had been a positive natural pause in my studies and gave me a chance to reflect and digest what was happening, and also to rest a little from the intense work that I had done since the beginning of May. It was clear to me that I was experiencing an adventure and that I was still at the beginning stages of it. I had started lessons with Warne with the sole intention of learning whatever I could from him, and was aware that the work was progressing in a way that I could not have imagined. The other thing I could not have imagined was playing with him to the degree that had taken place before he left and what also seemed would be continuing. In retrospect, there were a few factors that characterized that initial period of lessons and interaction, and they were present in equal measure. There was first a gravity or seriousness about everything we discussed, as if we were doing the most important work that a musician could embark upon. There was also a palpable joy to the music we played, and finally, there was a timeless, almost other-worldly character or feeling that I strongly perceived. This character pervaded all of what I was doing with Warne, even if I sat alone at home late at night listening to music, but it was strongly perceptible to me when I was with him at Bretton Hall, and also when I was practicing. The feeling that I was accessing something hidden from regular perception was strong for me and impossible to shake.\n\nWhen I arrived at Bretton Hall for the session I found that the group of players included both Simon Wettenhall and George Kay, the trumpet and bass players from the gig at the Gramercy Park Hotel. The drummer however was Taro Okamoto, and Taro had been the drummer with Warne on the gigs at Gulliver's that took place on that same weekend in late July. We had not met before, and Taro was a friendly guy who I found out lived in Brooklyn. I remember having a conversation with him either that day or shortly thereafter, and we were talking about how he had met Warne and also his general perception of his playing. Taro said something like this: \"so many tenor players that I play with try to copy Coltrane – but Warne is … different.\" I nodded my head in agreement, and this reminded me very much of how Sonny would describe Warne when we had first met. So I was excited to be at the session, and we played for about two hours that afternoon. Warne and Simon were a formidable front line, and we played several of the jazz compositions (or \"lines\") of Lennie Tristano, and may also have played Charlie Parker's blues \"Billie's Bounce\" with Warne and Simon playing all of Bird's solo. Regarding Lennie's lines (and also those written by Warne and Lee), I had been going over my transcriptions of them with Warne in my lessons. When we performed at Gramercy Park though he asked me not to play the lines because he felt that it created a \"top-heavy\" sound. What he wanted me to do instead was play \"harmony.\" Warne used this term with me quite a bit, and I found that it had for him a broad reference, much the same as his use of the word \"melody.\" I think the first time I heard him bring this up was in response to a question I asked regarding his advice for me on \"comping.\" (\"Comping\" is a shortened version of the word \"accompanying,\" and refers to the underlying accompaniment, generally improvised, that a chordal player provides to a jazz soloist. )He said first that he strongly disliked the term, and much preferred the word \"harmony.\" I asked why and he said that it seemed to him that too many pianists and guitarists resorted to formulaic patterns that "
