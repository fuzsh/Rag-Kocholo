        "text": "COPENHAGEN, April 20 - Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen, the famed Danish jazz bassist who performed with legends like Oscar Peterson, Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie, died on Tuesday at his home in Ishoej, south of Copenhagen. He was 58.\n\nHis manager announced his death to the Danish news media.\n\nMr. Orsted Pedersen's career took off in 1962 when, at age 16, he played in Copenhagen's famous Montmartre jazz club, where American greats like Count Basie, the tenor sexophonist Dexter Gordon and the pianist Bud Powell performed. At 17, he turned down an invitation to join the Basie band. His international breakthrough came in 1973, when he joined the Oscar Peterson trio, which was produced by the jazz impresario Norman Granz.\n\nMr. Orsted Pedersen was heard on hundreds of records and played with Toots Thielemans, Chet Baker, Lee Konitz and Martial Solal, among many others.\n\nClaus Vittus, a leading jazz expert with Denmark's public radio, called him one of the greatest jazz bassists in the world. From 1964 to 1982, he was a member of the Danish Radio Big Band and he also performed with the trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg and the keyboard player Kenneth Knudsen, both Danes."
