        "text": "Some very sad news for jazz fans. Bassist extraordinaire Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen died Wednesday night at the age of 58. This guy was one of my all-time favorite acoustic bass players, and he was a perfect fit with the Oscar Peterson Trio. From the Jazz Times site:\n\nDanish Bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen Dies\n\nDanish bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen died Wednesday night at age 58.\n\nThe bassist had been playing professionally since he was 14 and Count Basie offered 17-year-old Pedersen a spot in his orchestra, which Pedersen had to turn down. Instead, he worked regularly as the house bassist at the Club Montmarte and was a member of the Danish Radio Orchestra.\n\nMusicians regularly asked for Pedersen when they passed through Denmark on international tours and, as a result, Pedersen has performed with artists including Sonny Rollins, Bill Evans, Roland Kirk, Dexter Gordon, Bud Powell and Albert Ayler. Pedersen was also a member of the Oscar Peterson Trio and recorded for SteepleChase and Pablo Records.\n\nNo further details surrounding Pedersenâ€™s death were available.\n\nCapt. Bacardi"
