        "text": "Tamara Obrovac Quartet: \"NUVOLA\"\n\nALR 1121 | Twenty-five years after the debut album Ulika and ten years after Ulika Revival Tamara Obrovac's new original album, the third one created by this outstanding musician and her Tamara Obrovac Quartet.\n\nARTISTS:\n\nTamara Obrovac - vocalist\n\nMatija Dedić - piano\n\niga Golob - double bass\n\nKrunoslav Levačić - drums\n\nTwenty-five years after the debut album Ulika, which presented the unique musical style of Tamara Obrovac, and ten years after Ulika Revival, we have before us Nuvola, Tamara Obrovac's new original album, the third one created by this outstanding musician and author and her Tamara Obrovac Quartet.\n\nSeven original compositions are featured on this album, from the opening Na nebu postelja, through La nuvola (Cloud) from which the album takes its name, Zatancaj, Dvi divojke and Niki drugi svit, to the closing Oče moj and Kovarskih litanija. Tamara Obrovac is the author of all the compositions and lyrics on Nuvola, with the exception of the lyrics of the compositions La nuvola and Kovarske litanije which were written by Daniel Načinović, an acclaimed Istrian poet and Tamara’s regular associate.\n\nLike the previous albums, this one was also recorded by the quartet lineup that has not changed since 1997: Tamara Obrovac (vocalist), Matija Dedić (piano), iga Golob (double bass) and Krunoslav Levačić (drums). Nuvola by the Tamara Obrovac Quartet marks the quartet’s 25th anniversary and their 25 years of playing music together.\n\nThe Quartet’s first concert promoting Nuvola before the largest musical audience will take place at the JazzHR Festival in the Tvornica culture on March 29, followed by the album presentation in Pula (April 6, Klub & knjiara Giardini 2), and concerts in Split (April 27, Hrvatski dom Split) and Zadar (April 28, Providurova palača).\n\nOur well-known jazz columnist Davor Hrvoj wrote the opening text of the CD, in which he highlights the new creative step that Tamara Obrovac took with Nuvola,\n\n“Just when you think there could be no major change or a new creative twist after her countless performances and albums, with which she surprises us again and again, Tamara manages to delight us with new creativity. While she still retains her distinctive approach, her new songs are completely different from everything she has done to date. They are more contemplative, more spiritual and more suggestive. The unveiling of the soul in these compositions is more noticeable than ever.”\n\nNuvola is Tamara’s 13th album, recorded at the Istrian National Theater in Pula late last year. This is what Tamara says about the album and her cooperation with the long-time quartet members,\n\n“Though the compositions are a bit more complex, they follow my existing expression. It is always a pleasure to play with Matija, Kruno and iga, with whom I have shared an uncompromising dedication to music for the past 26 years. This ensemble has shared tremendous understanding, communication and joy in playing music from the very beginning, and it continues to do so to this day.”\n\nIn fact, on this new album Tamara draws the listener into her inner world and engulfs them in her visions, and she shares these visions, as Hrvoj notes, with her musicians, who play “not only from the soul, but like the soul itself\",\n\n“Although she has played with the same associates for years, she has not attained such extraordinary harmony, such mutual insight with them up to now, which has resulted in coherent performances. It is as if there are no instruments, no musicians, just light slowly changing color as the musicians telepathically process the thoughts exchanged.”\n\nTamara dedicated the album to her father Ivan Obrovac, a renowned artist from Istria who died in 2019. His painting is featured on the album cover.\n\nThe album was released on the Cantus label in collaboration with the Croatian Composers’ Society and with the support of the Ministry of Culture and Media of the Republic of Croatia. Bernard Mihalić from the Podmornica Studio was the sound engineer and did mixing and mastering, while the music producers were Bernard Mihalić and Tamara Obrovac.\n\nEloá Gonçalves: \"SOBRE O QUE MOVE AS COISAS\"\n\nALR 1114 | “Sobre o que move as coisas” (About what moves things) is the second album of the Brazilian pianist and composer Eloá Gonçalves.\n\nARTISTS:\n\nEloá Gonçalves - piano\n\nMathilde Vendramin - cello, vocals\n\nTobias Steinrück - double bass\n\nLuis Oliveira - drums\n\nJakob Helling - flugelhorn\n\n“Sobre o que move as coisas” (About what moves things) is the second album of the Brazilian pianist and composer Eloá Gonçalves. The album was recorded in June 2022, at Sounddesign Studios (Hagenberg - Austria), in a partnership with the Austrian label Alessa Records.\n\nIt’s a collaboration between the composer/pianist and the musicians Luis Oliveira (drums - from Brazil), Mathilde Vendramin (cello, vocals - from France), Tobias Steinrück (double bass - from Austria), featuring the special guest Jakob Helling on flugelhorn (from Germany). The album was supported by AKM/Austro Mechana, and presents 11 tracks, varying between trio, quartet and quintet formations.\n\nAll the music was composed by the pianist, excepted “Alegre Menina” - an original arrangement signed by Eloá for a composition by Dori Caymmi. Unlike her debut album (“Casa”), which carried a feeling of freedom and discoveries, her second album is much more represented by introspection and reflection, as we can see in the tunes “Breathe”, “Inhale, Exhale” and “Once more, breathe”, a meditative theme composed during the 1st lockdown and recorded with a kind of free jazz taste.\n\nWith the same mood are all the pieces of “Over weird times suite”, a set of music inspired by different feelings experienced also during lockdown: hopefulness (“Hopefulness”), anger (“Impromptu over weird times”), sadness (“Breathe”), thoughts that never cease and the failed attempt to understand reality (“Thoughts”).\n\nWe can also see the Brazilian music references in her music, in tunes such as “Choro pra Tati” (a choro dedicated to the great Brazilian singer Tatiana Parra), and “Alegre Menina” (in which once more the pianist honors one of the most acclaimed Brazilian composers - Dori Caymmi - with an original arrangement for jazz trio).\n\nAbout Eloá Gonçalves: Brazilian pianist and composer, Eloá Gonçalves is graduated from Universität für Musik und darstellende Kunst Graz (Austria) in Jazz Piano, under the guidance of German pianist Olaf Polziehn (having completed the course with outstanding performance mention). She holds also a Bachelor and Master´s degree in Popular Music by UNICAMP (Brazil).Her debut album “Casa”, released in 2020, was mentioned by jazz critics in magazines such as Downbeat (USA), Kulturní Magazín (Czech Republic), Jazz 'Halo (Belgium) and Concerto (Austria).\n\nAs a pianist, she has performed and recorded with both instrumental and pop music names such as Sandy (Latin Grammy nominated, Brazil), Zalon Thompson (England), Vinicius Dorin (Brazil), Nailor Azevedo “Proveta\" (Brazil), Ivan Vilela (Brazil), Daniel Barry (USA), Marcelo Martins (Brazil), Marco Lobo (Brazil), Joe Fiedler (USA), Luis Bonilla (Latin Grammy winner, USA), Sigi Feigl (Austria), Emiliano Sampaio (Brazil - Austria), Vine St. Horns - Brad Cole & KUG Jazz Orchestra (USA/Austria), Kaya Meller Quartet (Poland), Jaka Arh Triptych (Slovenia), Experience of the North (Denmark/Austria), Iñaki Askunze (Spain), Cristina Miguel Martínez (Spain), Mario Campos and Orchestral Collective (Brazil), Rafael de Lima Quartet (Latin Grammy nominated, Brazil),\n\nUNICAMP Symphony Orchestra (Brazil), Indaiatuba Symphony Orchestra (Brazil), Campinas Jazz Big Band, and KUG Jazz Orchestra (Austria).\n\nIn Brazil, she was finalist at MIMO Instrumental Award 2015 with Trio Matiz. With Eloá Gonçalves TRIO, she was invited to begin the partnership of SAVASSI Jazz Festival (one of the most recognized festivals in Brazil, in Belo Horizonte) with the Women Creating Collective, performing on the stage \"Women Creating Music\" in 2017. After moving to Graz, the trio was invited to join festivals such as the Jazzwerkstatt Graz 2019, Steyr Jazz Festival 2020, Jazz im Generalihof 2021 and Austrian Soundcheck 2021.\n\nIn Europe, she has been performing in Austria, Croatia, Slovenia, Poland and Germany, at jazz clubs and festivals such as Unterfahrt Jazz Club (Munich), Stockwerk (Graz), Jazzwerkstatt Graz 2019, Warsaw Summer Jazz Festival 2019, All That Jazz Art Festival Malinska 2019, Graz Jazz Nacht, Kranj Jazz Camp, and Steyr Jazz Festival.\n\nIn September 2020 she was selected with her Trio as a finalist of the Central European Jazz Showcase, event organized in partnership with JazzFest Brno - Czech Republic.\n\nCurrently, she is living in Brazil, where she is touring with one of the most acclaimed Brazilian pop singers/songwriters, Sandy. She leads her trio with two of the most sought-after musicians from the Brazilian jazz scene (the drummer Paulinho Vicente and the bass player Iury Batista).In June 2023 she will be touring in Europe playing the music of her 2 albums (“Casa” and “Sobre o que move as coisas”) in Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic.\n\nFor learning more, please visit: www.eloagoncalves.com.br\n\nGerhard Graml: \"EVERYTHING\"\n\nALR 1113 | The versatile bassist and composer Gerhard Graml returns to recording his original music in prime form. He is joined by a group of Washington DCs finest and most respected jazz instrumentalists.\n\nARTISTS:\n\nGerhard Graml - bass, compositions\n\nJoe Herrera - trumpet\n\nBobby Muncy - tenor saxophone\n\nAbram Mamet - french horn\n\nChris Stiles - piano\n\nJulian Berkowitz - drums\n\nThe versatile bassist and composer Gerhard Graml returns to recording his original music in prime form. He is joined by a group of Washington DCs finest and most respected jazz instrumentalists: Joe Herrera on trumpet, Bobby Muncy on tenor saxophone, Abram Mamet on French horn, Chris Stiles on Piasno and Julian Berkowitz on drums.\n\n\"Years ago the late great pianist Paul Bley remarked to me that in the new realm of contemporary jazz players, many of whom either improvised freely or used that approach as an organizing or guiding force for improvisation, he could always tell the difference between those who were solidly grounded in the music – notably, he didn’t used the word tradition – and those who were (and these are my words, as the conversation was a long time ago) flailing around, trying to find a way into, with some difficulty, this art form that many of us still call jazz. The album you are holding, Everything, is a perfect illustration of what Paul was talking about. In a world where everyone and his brother and sister is recording, streaming, putting his/her work online, this is a refreshing reminder of everything that those who love jazz value in the music. Everything is heartfelt (not sentimental), technically accomplished (meaning, well executed but not slick), professional (but not stodgy or dull), emotionally satisfying and deep. I can usually tell from the first few minutes, on both recordings and in live performance, whether musicians care about what they are performing or are just going through the motions (just another payday? Well, this is jazz, but still there are many very workmanlike performances that indicate a certain jaded consistency; but you won’t find any of that on this album). Who was the philosopher – or comedian?- who said that half the battle in life was just showing up? Well, in jazz that’s particularly true, and sometimes the lack of certain things – recognition, work, money – leads to a certain consistent yet bored quality in the music produced. On the CD Everything the great bassist Gerhard Graml (who composed all tunes herein) has shown us how it can be done correctly, with a straightforward depth that is not just musical but artistically satisfying.\n\nThe pieces on this album are all compositions, in the truest and best sense of the term. The job of the jazz composer varies, but there are certain requirements that never really change, generation to generation (in my opinion). Writing for jazz ensemble is a challenge, given all that jazz has been through, how much material it has eaten up and spit out in its never-ending search for the new. Musicians need to be challenged without completely detaching themselves from their comfort zones, and it helps to give them something they won’t see or hear in their day-to-day professional lives. And so we have it all here – bluesy extrapolations of the jazz/gospel tradition; modality in the service of exploration; ballads and near-ballads, never exchanging virtuosity for feeling; a certain lightness of being with a Latin tinge; and it all swings.\n\nI have known Gerhard Graml since late 1980s, I think it was. We first played together in New York City on an old project I organized on a modern approach to the music of Louis Armstrong, and later recorded together as part of a series of blues and blue-like performances. He has everything I like and need in a bass player: good time, a great sound, and consistent rhythmic/harmonic definition. He has the kind of artistic consistency I admire; nothing is ever “phoned in,” as the saying goes. Everything he plays shows commitment and artistry, attention to musical detail. He leads a group, on Everything, that accomplishes same. Persistent arguments in jazz about old versus new, free versus structured, blues versus no-blues, are becoming, in light of music as good as this, less and less relevant, less and less important. What matters finally is whether the music created shows care and love for the itself, and has feeling. This album, if you will pardon the expression, has everything.\"\n\nAllen Lowe (Allen Lowe is a saxophonist and music historian who has recorded 20+ albums and written a number of highly acclaimed books on American music)\n\nEmiliano Sampaio Jazz Symphonic Orchestra: \"WE HAVE A DREAM\"\n\nALR 1105 | This music is a result of the four years of doctoral artistic research I did at the University of Music Graz. I investigated how one can establish communication between jazz and classical musicians by encouraging them to engage in more collaboration in the large ensemble context.\n\nARTISTS:\n\nWoodwinds:\n\nHeinrich von Kalnein - Flute/Alto Flute/Alto Sax\n\nJaka Arh - Tenor Sax/Clarinet\n\nMilosh Milojevic - Clarinet/Bass Clarinet\n\nStas Zhukovskyy - Oboe/Duduk\n\nGerald Preinfalk - Baritone Sax/Bass Clarinet\n\nBrass:\n\nMarc Osterer, Jakob Helling - Trumpet\n\nKarl-Heinz Tappler - French Horn\n\nÁdám Ladányi - Trombone\n\nJohannes Oppel - Bass Trombone\n\nRhythm Section:\n\nSandra Macher - Harp\n\nŠimun Matišić, Florian Pöttler - Percussion\n\nMichael Lagger - Piano\n\nIvar Krizic - Bass\n\nLuis Oliveira - Drums\n\nString Orchestra:\n\nViolin: Andreas Semlitch, Mikołaj Kostka, Kristina Wasik, Cozy Friedel, Daniel Allison, Anna Tropper, Albin Krieger, Pantea Moshfegh\n\nViola: Gregor Fussenegger, Jakob Suchentrunk, Álvaro Larre, Andreas Trenkwalder\n\nCello: Sigrid Narowetz, Kristijan Krajnčan, Katja Finsel, Urban Megusar, Eduardo Antiao\n\nThis music is a result of the four years of doctoral artistic research I did at the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz. I investigated how one can establish communication between jazz and classical musicians by encouraging them to engage in more collaboration in the large ensemble context. That investigation led my artistic work to examine, explore, and question the hierarchy that is still very present and has historically been reproduced in large jazz ensembles. As Christopher Small points out in his book Musicking, the relationships and traditions in making music are a “matter of choices and there is nothing inevitable about the arrangements we make, it is not ordained by nature but is a social arrangement” (1998: 36).\n\nAll pieces were initially composed and arranged by me, however, during the rehearsal process, the musicians had almost infinite freedom to change, erase, recompose, adapt, and improvise the music to fit their own musicality. By using this process, they experienced the feeling of playing in a small jazz band albeit with almost forty musicians… a concept that has been tried in the past by many musicians coming from classical, jazz, and other musical genres to different results. Our orchestra experience seemed to create new hierarchies between the musicians, composer, conductor, and the written music, in general. It strengthened the cooperation between everyone and opened up new ways for us to think about how to make large ensemble music where the barriers between composer, conductor, interpreter, and improviser can be liquid.\n\nOn a deeper and more universal level, I would like to dedicate this work to the fight against racism and poverty around the world. In May 2020, the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and other black Americans in the US sparked a series of protests against racism around the world and influenced my work directly because I was composing this music at the same time. As a Brazilian, I saw racism and poverty close up as a structural and social problem, however, coming from a white, middle-class family, I always held a privileged position. Now, with 37 years old, I would like to use my own life experiences and human responsibility to draw attention to this highly important topic, which is still present in the world today. Now is the time to make clear to society that basic human needs apply to all and must be met. Only through this clarification and social change can we speak of a world in which justice and equality prevail.\n\nDuring my musical research for this project, I realized that I knew almost nothing about black orchestra composers and started to discover beautiful music written by composers such as Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Florence Price, William Grant Still, Undine Smith Moore, Julius Eastman, and George Walker. These and many other black composers have long been denied a proper place in music history and I hope to help change this by highly recommending that you check out their music!\n\nAlong with my emotional motivation to write this music, my artistic research also resulted in a dissertation. It aims to help better understand the social arrangements established in Large Jazz Ensembles, to place the Jazz Symphonic Orchestra tradition in historical context, and to link it to the development of the Third Stream, showing aesthetic and social implications that this cultural establishment reproduces to the current day. I would like to recommend the listener (musician or not) to read my dissertation in order to better comprehend how this album was conceived and to learn more about the long journey that encompasses the initial concept through to the final composition of this music. The text can be reached here with this QR code:\n\nI am happily releasing this album after four years of challenges and discoveries about music, the world, and myself. Musicking in a large ensemble context deals intimately with hierarchy and is a powerful tool to help question the ways in which we relate to each other whether in the musical world or in our daily lives. It brings the possibility for new aesthetic experiences, and more importantly, it can improve the artists’ individual and/or group experiences by changing the relationships with each other. Furthermore, for the world as a whole, this kind of concept and experience can provide a way of existing that is based on trust, collaboration, and serenity.\n\nAn orchestra playing should be an inspiring example of people working together!\n\nLukas Gabric Quartet: \"DOUBLE STANDARD\"\n\nALR 1101 | Die Stücke auf dem Album Double Standard wurden während der COVID-19 Pandemie in NY geschrieben und sollen das kathartische Potenzial der Musik, welches während dieser schweren Zeit „lebenswichtig“ ist, durch ungehemmte Spielfreude entfachen.\n\nARTISTS:\n\nLukas Gabric - tenor saxophone\n\nRob Bargad - piano\n\nPhilipp Zarfl - bass\n\nPeter Primus Frosch - drums\n\nDer Title Track, „Double Standard” („Mit zweierlei Maß messen”), soll als Zweideutigkeit verstanden werden, die gesellschaftliche Missstände anspricht, aber auch als eine humorvolle Anspielung, da auf dem Album kein einziger Jazz Standard aufgenommen wurde. Viel eher war es meine Intention, die Stücke nach den archetypischen strukturellen Schemata des Great American Songbook aufzubauen. Die US-amerikanische Jazzikone Walt Weiskopf schreibt in den Liner Notes zum Album: „Lukas’ level of artistry does not come easy, it’s the product of raw talent combined with persistence, hard work, and the evident and apparent love for an artform. Lukas has mastered the tenor saxophone with seemingly flawless technique, a rich big warm sound, and great notes streaming out of the horn. All of Lukas’ compositions on this album make for excellent listening. Beautifully crafted and satisfying to the ear, Double Standard is a terrific collection”.\n\nSince I was lucky enough to mentor Lukas Gabric over ten years ago during his time at the New School in New York City he has accomplished many things in music. He has written excellent books on jazz improvisation, he is a distinguished musicologist, academic, and, best of all, a great player and composer from my admittedly narrow point of view. Double Standard, Lukas’ third album as a leader, features exclusively original compositions and is all about the exploration of the medium of the jazz quartet led by the quintessential saxophonist/leader in the tradition of other jazz greats who have traveled this path.\n\nThe musicians Lukas has assembled for this project are beautifully well-matched. Rob Bargad (piano), an alumnus of Nat Adderley’s and Jimmy Cobb’s bands, is well-known as a leader in his own right. He functions here perfectly as the consummate pianist with no other agenda than to compliment and contribute his great piano playing to Lukas’ music. The completion of the quartet with fellow Austrians Philipp Zarfl (bass) and Peter Primus Frosch (drums) reflects a preference for sidemen who can immediately bring all their talents to the table. They are both virtuosic, earthy, and above all: swinging.\n\n“Double Standard” is a perfect lead-off, showcasing the band’s essential love of this music in the shape of an original tune reflecting the tradition that has drawn so many jazz fans to the fold. It’s egoless and draws you right in.\n\n“At the Mercy” is a reference to the endless frustrations of the visa process from the standpoint of those who love life in the U.S. but are not citizens. The loping 12/8 feel of this tune is evocative of the constant uncertainty felt by those of our piers living here who feel their fate is in the hands of bureaucracy.\n\n“Road Trip Melody” is an up-tempo ride showcasing in the introduction and interlude a relatively uncommon linear device in jazz, the augmented scale. Without getting too technical – let’s just say it’s tricky; but the trickiest part of this display is how natural these musicians make it sound. A lay person will likely hear this tune as inspiration to “put the pedal to the metal,” which is the best thing about it.\n\nAfter the twisting and turning head in “Blue Zone” the band settles quickly into a swinging 12-bar blues; the foundational form of jazz that always endures.\n\nFollowing “Blue Zone” is another mainstay of the jazz tradition. “Mahalo” is a lovely original ballad inspired by the beauty of Hawaii where Lukas spent his honeymoon. Here is a chance to enjoy and admire the honest intensity of the sound Lukas gets on the tenor saxophone.\n\nOne hardly needs to mention the influence of the great John Coltrane on Lukas, on this project and virtually all jazz musicians, who are influenced by this great icon in our music. “Lockdown” is a “tip-of-the-hat” to Coltrane’s composition “Countdown,” which has inspired so many jazz musicians. On hearing “Lockdown” for the first time I had the same reaction as when I heard “Countdown” – better pick up that horn and practice! Importantly, “Lockdown” features a unique chord progression that is distinct from “Countdown,” and the title references the social distancing mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMy only clue about the driving and earnest standard-like “What You Are” was the title – an apparent reference to Jerome Kern’s “All the Things You Are.” I guess I’m not the only jazz musician obsessed by this enduring standard. Lukas has a theoretical basis to explain the structure of this tune but it’s not a “contrafact” (an original melody based on a pre-existing chord progression). A good way to compliment this tune is to observe that it’s an original composition that sounds like a great standard. A perfect conclusion to a great album.\n\nLukas’ level of artistry does not come easy, it’s the product of raw talent combined with persistence, hard work, and the evident and apparent love for an artform. Lukas has mastered the tenor saxophone with seemingly flawless technique, a rich big warm sound, and great notes streaming out of the horn. All of Lukas’ compositions on this album make for excellent listening. Beautifully crafted and satisfying to the ear, Double Standard is a terrific collection.\n\nWalt Weiskopf, September 2021\n\nMátyás Bartha Trío: \"SELF-REFLECTION\"\n\nALR 1099 | Mátyás has poured his heart, soul, and mind into his first recording as a leader. This project is a journey of self refl ection - as a pianist, as a musician, and as a person.\n\nARTISTS:\n\nMátyás Bartha - piano\n\nDanny Ziemann - bass\n\nChristian Salfellner - drums\n\nWelcome to the pianistic world of Mátyás Bartha. Mátyás has poured his heart, soul, and mind into his first recording as a leader. This project is a journey of self refl ection - a statement of who he is as a pianist, as a musician, and as a person.\n\nMátyás has impeccable technique. His hands are able to carry out the ideas his imagination offers, regardless of tempo or complexity.\n\nWhile he is able to color a song with lush voicings and subtle internal counterpoints, what one hears fi rst and foremost is his deep love of melody. Whether he is stating the main theme of a song or creating variations through chord changes, Mátyás sings through the piano with clear and direct rhythm. He transmits his emotions directly to our ears and hearts.\n\nIn the social media age, young musicians are often encouraged to seek immediate attention through dazzling technique and fi reworks, forsaking space, patience, and emotional connection. Although Mátyás can “play the hell out of the piano,” he prefers using sophistication and elegance to draw us into his music to hear his story. Putting aside visions of popularity, he focuses on offering listeners acoustic beauty.\n\nMátyás is both a wonderful composer and a great interpreter of the Great American Songbook. His clever and melodic compositions and arrangements are full of surprises, smiles, and love for the swing beat.\n\nThroughout the set, bassist Danny Ziemann and drummer Christian Salfellner accompany Mátyás selfl essly, always choosing to support the pianist rather than to show off personal abilities. However, when the moment comes for them to take the spotlight, Danny and Christian each play with fi re, imagination, and tenderness.\n\nAll three members of this relatively new yet cohesive group contributed to the direction of the songs, with each player giving his all to the music and the stories. While Mátyás has a strong connection to stride and other earlier piano styles, he felt a more modern approach suited this particular trio and recording project. As you listen, it is evident that rapport won over style – you will feel the connection between these three souls.\n\nWhat an auspicious start, both for Mátyás Bartha as a lead recording artist, and for this beautifully integrated trio! This maiden voyage is no small feat. The combination of expertise, sincerity and diligence will take Mátyás far and wide artistically. We listeners can look forward to enjoying his journey as it unfolds in the years to come.\n\n–MICHAEL KANAN–\n\nNew York Jazz Pianist\n\nTriple Ace: \"TRIPLE\"\n\nALR 1098 | Due to the pandemic lockdown 2020 we met in Dusan's Studio as often as possible.

I discovered it was much more fun to try to imitate their songs.\n\nA few years later, after some classical training on the upright bass and after having shifted my focus to jazz music, I discovered a pretty good jazz scene and musicians in Vienna. I got the opportunity to play a lot with the ,old cats' and enjoyed learning from them while honing my craft.\n\nThen I met Oliver Kent, who at the time was the up-and-coming pianist on the Austrian jazz-scene. We began working together in different formations. As a trio we regularly opened Jam sessions but also played concerts and at some gigs supplied the background music.\n\nAfter the amazing drummer Dusan Novakov moved from Graz to Vienna, he joined us playing in clubs and at festivals all across Europe and beyond. Dusan is not only an experienced drummer, open to all kind of styles but also the owner and sound engineer of the Dukatton Studio, where we began to record on a regular basis.\n\nWe released our first trio cd, \"Triple Ace Trio\" on the Montreal Jazz Label in 2012, our second, entitled \"Faces\" was released in 2016 on Alessa Records.\n\nWhen, due to the pandemic lockdown 2020, all our live performances were cancelled, we seized the opportunity and met in Dusan's Studio as often as possible. We recorded whatever came to our mind: Standards, Jazz tunes, Popsongs and our own compositions. Of course we then stood before a difficult task because there were ways over 30 tracks we liked.

Steve stayed for a week back then and was very kind and helpful with me, later on he settled in our city permanently. I was fortunate to establish a beautiful friendship with Steve, he taught me a lot and gave me the chance to play with him many times; being around him has been a great school and life experience for me and I will forever be grateful. We will always miss you, Steve!\n\nPiero Odorici\n\nI had the honor to play with Steve Grossman for many years since 1990, he took me around Europe to perform in important festivals and venues, giving me invaluable opportunities to grow as a jazz musician. He was one of the few musicians that didn’t accept any compromise about music, he liked to swing and to follow the music flow without trying to control it, a rare characteristic that only the masters have! Plus he was always very kind to me, pushing me to play at my best and beyond my limits, I miss him a lot as a friend and I miss his unique sound and swing.\n\nAndrea Pozza\n\nI first saw Steve in the 1980s as a guest of the Cedar Walton Trio. After a few years, in 1990 I played with him for the first time. I confess that I was tense and also a little intimidated; Steve was not an easy type. Instead, a beautiful musical and human relationship was born that lasted more than twenty years. I am happy and honored to be part of this quintet where the, so called by Steve, “Jazz-feeling” is fully represented.\n\nAldo Zunino\n\nI was very aware of Steve Grossman because of his work with my hero Elvin Jones, since then Steve was one of my favorite musicians, not only saxophone players. When I got called in 2010 to play with Steve’s quintet at Paul Zauner’s “Inntöne”-festival, I was very excited and yes, very nervous too! This was indeed an unforgettable experience, I was thrilled when I heard Steve’s warming up solo-performance of “In A Sentimental Mood”. Steve died last August, way too young and early, all five of us had the desire to honor him with a recording dedicated to his life and musical legacy! I am happy we could do this in February/March 2021 during the difficult lockdown-period which made it even more special and memorable, thanks a lot to everybody for the music, spirit and great vibe!\n\nBernd Reiter\n\nEloá Gonçalves Trio: “CASA”\n\nALR 1087 | “Casa” is the 1st album of the trio led by Brazilian pianist and composer Eloá Gonçalves, in collaboration with the musicians Luis Oliveira on drums (also from Brazil), and Tobias Steinrück on double bass (Austria).\n\nARTISTS:\n\nEloá Gonçalves - piano\n\nTobias Steinrück - double bass\n\nLuis Oliveira - drums\n\n“I think everyone has a way of feeling “at home”. That could be a place, someone’s company, a smell or a taste. For most of my life making music has been what makes me feel that way.

I hope that you, just like me, through the music you’ll listen to here, also feel at home.” (Eloá Gonçalves)\n\n“Casa” is the 1st album of the trio led by Brazilian pianist and composer Eloá Gonçalves, in collaboration with the musicians Luis Oliveira on drums (also from Brazil), and Tobias Steinrück on double bass (Austria).\n\nSupported by ...H (University of Music and Performing Arts Graz) and Stadt Graz, the album has 9 tracks, all of them original compositions (except one tune, which is an original arrangement for “Desenredo”, a composition from the Brazilian composer Dori Caymmi).The sound of the album carries a mix of jazz, Brazilian music, and sometimes a “classical taste”, especially in some compositions as “Elo” (inspired by the Hungarian classical composer Bela Bart—k and his Mikrokosmos series), “Choro de pai e mãe” (a traditional Brazilian genre reframed from a jazz perspective), and “Um, o que veio depois” (inspired by the Impressionism).\n\nThree of the nine tracks had the very special participation of talented musicians from the jazz scene in Graz nowadays: Jaka Arh (Slovenia/ tenor saxophone); Karel Eriksson (Sweden / trombone); Laura Zšschg (Italy / vocal) and Mathilde Vendramin (France / cello).\n\nIn collaboration with the musicians Luis Oliveira (drums) and Tobias Steinrück (double bass), the trio led by the Brazilian pianist and composer presents a blend of sonorities that walks between the freedom of jazz, some compositional references in classical music, and Brazilian music.\n\nLuis Oliveira is one of the most outstanding drummers in the jazz scene in Graz nowadays. He is graduated from University of Music and Performing Arts Graz, and has been recording and touring for 15 years with his trio “Meretrio” and also big band “Mereneu Project” (both led by Brazilian composer Emiliano Sampaio) around Europe (Austria, Germany, France, Croatia, Slovenia, among other countries), Brazil and Australia.\n\nTobias Steinrück is also graduated from University of Music and Performing Arts Graz, under the guidance of renowned Danish bassist Morten Ramsbøl, and is a very versatile and sensitive bass player.\n\nThe repertoire presented by the trio is full of elements found in Brazilian music, ranging from simple and lyrical melodies to traditional genres found in Brazilian music such as waltz, choro, and baião. In addition, there are traces of modal and contemporary jazz, always permeated by improvisation.\n\nThe pianist and composer is currently living in the city of Graz (Austria), where she is pursuing a master's degree in Jazz Performance from the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz, under the guidance of the German pianist Olaf Polziehn. As a pianist in her country of origin, she has performed and recorded in both jazz and pop scene, with names such as Sandy (Latin Grammy nominated), Vinicius Dorin, Nailor Azevedo \"Proveta\", Ivan Vilela, Daniel Barry (USA), Marcelo Martins, Rafael de Lima Quartet (Latin Grammy nominated composer), UNICAMP Symphony Orchestra, and Indaiatuba Symphony Orchestra, to mention some. After moving to Austria, she has been performing with ensembles and names such as Joe Fiedler (USA), Kaya Meller (Poland), Jaka Arh Triptych, Experience of the North, Iñaki Askunze (Spain), KUG Jazz Orchestra, Vine St. Horns (USA) and Luis Bonilla (USA, Latin Grammy awarded).\n\nIn Brazil, she was finalist at MIMO Instrumental Award 2015 with Trio Matiz, presenting some of her compositions. With Eloá Gonçalves TRIO, she was invited to begin the partnership of SAVASSI Jazz Festival (one of the most recognized festivals in Brazil, in Belo Horizonte) with the Women Creating Collective, performing on the stage \"Women Creating Music\" in 2017. After moving to Graz, the trio was invited to join the Jazzwerkstatt Graz 2019.\n\nIn Europe, she has been performing at jazz festivals such as Shortcuts (Jazzwerkstatt 2018); Jazzwerkstatt Graz 2019, Graz Jazz Nacht, Warsaw Summer Jazz Festival (Warsaw, Poland, 2019); and All That Jazz Art Festival Malinska 2019 (Croatia).\n\nTobias Hoffmann Nonet: “RETROSPECTIVE“\n\nALR 1076 | „Some great grooves and great melodies.

It is not always easy for me to unite both. With the Nonet, I have finally not only managed to merg e all my different musical influences of the past years but also to write and play music in which I find myself reflected both as a saxophone player and as a composer and arranger.\n\nWhen in 2017 I started to plan this project and write the music, I didn’t know yet in which direction the music would go, not to mention what was lying ahead of me, which ups and downs I would need to go through and if I would ever be able to realize this project on the level I was aiming for. Looking back, it feels almost surreal to hold the CD in my hands and being able to say that I am very satisfied with the result.\n\nI would to thank my incredible band. Each of them helped with their commitment, their musicality and their personality to bring this music alive.\n\nEnjoy listening to the recordings.\n\nTobias Hoffmann\n\nI first met Tobias Hoffmann when he contacted me while I was teaching in Graz and wanted to do some studying with me. When I first heard his writing I was impressed with his melodic and rhythmic ideas. Over a period of time we discussed on how to fine tune some of the musical questions he had asked. This CD is some of the results of our meetings and am very happy with the results. When you listen to the performances you cannot believe the wonderful fat sound he gets out of five horns and four rhythm. This has to do with his sense of orchestration, knowing how to put the right instruments on the right notes creating some interesting colors. Sometimes the music can be quite difficult but for the right reasons and the musicians he assembled to play his music play it superbly from beginning to end both in ensemble playing and the solos including Tobias himself on tenor and soprano saxophones. Some great grooves and great melodies. Please enjoy this recording of Tobias’ work as much I have.\n\nMichael Abene, Grammy winning Producer/Arranger/Educator, March 2019\n\nI first met saxophonist and composer/arranger Tobias Hoffmann in 2011 and since that time have delighted in watching him become the highly skilled, widely informed and musically adept composer and arranger that his latest recording shows him to be, not to mention a fine saxophonist and improvisor and a scholar of jazz arranging as well. As both my saxophone and composition student I know Tobi to be an amazingly hard-working, results-oriented and inspired musician willing to do what it takes to reach his goals. His honesty and personal integrity complete the package of a maturing young musician on the path to his own voice!\n\nAndy Middleton, February 2019\n\nGiuffre Zone: \"RELOADED\"\n\nALR 1069 | Like a newly discovered old love affair, a newly repaired one. It feels like a classic car, the “Giuffre Zone” formation again to start.\n\nARTISTS:\n\nChristoph Cech - piano\n\nGerald Preinfalk - sax, clarinet\n\nPer Mathisen - double bass\n\nThe American multi-woodwind and composer Jimmy Giuffre, born in 1921, stands for a number of artistic significant attempts to enrich the Improvisation practice. This includes the large orchestral and Chamber music connection of jazz with modern e-music and Anglo-American folklore. In front Giuffre was forty-five years old Austrian Jazz lovers especially as the initiator of the four saxophonists - Group, the Woody Herman „Second Herd“, the one Composition Giuffres the name „Four Brothers Section ”(1947) and as a member of various West Coast bands, such as the Lighthouse All Stars (1951/52). Later activities as a clarinetist or Giuffres Saxophonist with his trio, including with Bob Brookmeyer, Valve trombone, or Jim Hall, guitar, (Wiener Konzert im Spring 1959), were mainly legendary appearance in the film „Jazz on a summer evening“ The Train And The River (1958) perceived positively.

I believe that the pounding rhythm makes it impossible to get the real one Sound of wind instruments can be heard or on solo lines to concentrate“.\n\nGiuffre, who also has many teaching positions carried out various universities was due to this dissolution traditional jazz shape pattern also a significant one Preparer of free jazz.\n\nKlaus Schulz 2006\n\nLike a newly discovered old love affair, a newly repaired one. It feels like a classic car, the “Giuffre Zone” formation again to start. We have become more mature and more experienced.\n\nIt a lot has happened, a lot of music has happened the last time Christoph Cech, Per Mathisen and I surrendered to Giuffres music.\n\nIt is nice to note that there are fundamental. Do not change attitudes and passions.\n\nA Rolling Stone fan will always be Rolling Stone fan. It is similar with Giuffre‘s music, albeit that Comparison lagging a bit due to popularity. Next of pure music consumption comes from the executor Musicians to the existing passion still of creation and The spirit of research added to that in Giuffre’s music too is omnipresent. Because of the openness of the improvisations versus the beauty of the compositions is always useful never recreating these pieces repeatedly. So what‘s new how we think about it today.\n\nThe reflections, miniatures and Compositions that we create after the years of fermentation to lean, write and design Giuffre’s work definitely sound different than when it was sparkling youth.\n\nGerald Preinfalk\n\nAnna Lauvergnac & Claus Raible: \"FREE FALL\"\n\nALR 1060 | The music you hear on this album is the result of an incredibly courageous recording session. Italian singer Anna Lauvergnac and her musical soul mate, German pianist Claus Raible, entered the studio with a well-rehearsed program.\n\nARTISTS:\n\nAnna Lauvergnac - vocals\n\nClaus Raible - piano\n\nThe music you hear on this album is the result of an incredibly courageous recording session.\n\nItalian singer Anna Lauvergnac and her musical soul mate, German pianist Claus Raible, entered the studio with a well-rehearsed program, ready to start the complex metamorphosis that transforms music from an intangible vision to physical reality.\n\nFor her new release Anna has chosen the most intimate and demanding of any musical line up: the duo. The dim lighting in the studio created a candle-light setting that enhanced the closeness of “being just two”.\n\nWhen the recording engineer asked them to play something to set the sound levels, after a moment of silent contemplation Anna suggested “How about Angel Eyes”? The song was not on their pre-arranged recording set list, just a beautiful composition they both know and love. “OK, let’s try it in E-flat.” replied Claus.\n\nAfter the last note faded out, the sound engineer asked “Would you please come to the control room and listen? There’s something happening here…”\n\nThe whole song had been recorded and it possessed the magic that only a first take can have: a combination of intensity, spontaneity, honesty and intuition.\n\nThe two musicians decided to abandon most of the planned material and embark on an extraordinary adventure: a recording built on instinctive interpretation and real time\n\narrangements.\n\nIt was a challenge that required not only profound music mastery but extraordinary sensitivity, two elements that allowed Claus Raible to envision and create some astounding on the spot\n\narrangements.\n\nAnna’s interpretation of each song is instinctive and passionate and her dark and rich sound blends perfectly with the pianist’s harmony and rhythm.\n\nBreaking out of the common pattern of accompanying a soloist, Claus’s playing sounds like an orchestral work enhancing and surrounding Anna’s melody lines.\n\nThere is such a strong emotional connection between the two that you can feel and hear this bond in every breath, every word, every chord and every note.\n\nThe distinctive trait of this duo and this beautiful album is grounded in the awareness of the jazz idiom and the freshness of authenticity and individuality. Indeed this recording required -and reflects- “passion, intuition, freedom, faith and some madness”.\n\nClaus Raible\n\nGerman born Claus Raible got fascinated by Jazz as early as in his primary school days through listening to radio programs, in particular by the Voice Of America Jazz Hour hosted by legendary DJ Willis Conover. At the age of eleven he began studying trumpet, and three years later the piano became his second and eventually main instrument. By age sixteen, while still at high school, Claus had his first professional performing appearances, both as a sideman as well as a leader.\n\nStill in his early twenties he had the chance and honor to be performing with such stellar musicians as Art Farmer, Andy Bey, Mark Murphy to name a few.\n\nAfter graduating the Graz Music University with honor in 1992, Claus moved to New York City where he formed the Claus Raible Sextet which featured Brad Leali, Mike Karn, Shawn McGloin.\n\nAs a sideman he soon started appearing in many of the city jazz clubs with musicians such as Ben Dixon, Manny Duran, Jimmy Lovelace, Jon Faddis, and many others.\n\nIt was in New York that he met, and later took master classes from pianist Dr. Barry Harris who has been a great influence on his writing and arranging.\n\nIn 1998 Claus returned to Munich, Germany, and began splitting his time between the USA and Europe, touring extensively with his own projects as well as a sideman. Some of the greats that Claus has been\n\nworking with include: Jimmy Cobb, Keith Copeland, Charles Davis, Dennis Ervin, Herb Geller, Benny Golson, Alvin Queen, Ed Thigpen, etc.\n\nClaus has done numerous works on commission for small groups as well as for orchestra. He has made featured arrangements and compositions for The Brad Leali Jazz Orchestra (N.Y., USA), Gospel Meets\n\nJazz (Dallas, TX, USA, San Antonio, TX, USA), The Al Porcino Big Band (Munich, GER), Works for orchestra and choir for the Black History Month celebration (Denton, TX, USA), just to mention a few.\n\nHe is among those piano maestros who feel especially indebted to the musical heritage of bebop pioneers Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk. Directness can well be Raible’s secret as musical interpreter.\n\nHe never comes across as a musician who scoops things up second hand, slavishly copying and than regurgitating it back: rather, he lives what he plays.\n\nHis music has nothing to do with nostalgia – it is about identity and integrity- and it is vital, gripping, moving.\n\n“Claus Raible plays with a style that embodies vitality and authority, which is real, captivating and fresh, ....” Hans-Jürgen Schaal, Jazz Critic\n\n“Wherever he performs, the band members, other musicians in the audience, and last but not least the audience itself are amazed by his confidence in style, his fantasy of improvisation, and\n\nthe stupendous virtuosity of his performance” - Claus Regnault, Süddeutsche Zeitung\n\nUnter den vielen hervorragenden Jazzpianisten Europas nimmt Claus Raible eine Sonderstellung ein, weil er - wie kaum ein Zweiter, aus der ihm bestens vertrauter Tradition, heraus agiert. Also den Jazz der Blütezeit einerseits bestens bewahrt und ihn andererseits ins hier und jetzt transportiert, mit einem sehr persönlichen Touch. Jede einzelne Note von ihm ist purer Genuss, unverfälscht rauh und poetisch! Ganz im Sinne von “it don’t mean a thing, if it ain’t got that swing”. Magie statt Zeitgeist! - mathias rüegg\n\nAnna Lauvergnac\n\nAnna was born in Trieste, Italy, where short after starting singing jazz she started performing with some of the best jazz musicians of the North Italian jazz scene (Franco Vallisneri, Francesco Bearzatti, Renato Chicco, Glauco Venier, Bruno Cesselli and Paolo Conte’s guitarist Andrea Allione).\n\nShe started studying Jazz Singing in 1989 at the Berklee College Summer Clinics in Perugia - Italy, where she was offered a scholarship and received a special Artistic Mention. The same year she enrolled at the Art University for Music and Performing Arts of Graz - Austria, where she studied for four years with Jazz Greats Jay Clayton, Mark Murphy, Andy Bey and Sheila Jordan. In the same years she attended masterclasses with Reggie Workman in Croatia and with Barry Harris in New York during numerous stays in the States.\n\nIn 1994 she moved to Vienna where she soon was invited by star arranger-composer mathias rüegg to perform on different special events with Europe leading Big Band, the Vienna Art Orchestra. She started as well a serial of recordings for the ORF, the Austrian Radio, presenting each year a different project and performed with most of the great musicians of the Austrian Jazz scene (Upper Austria Jazz Orchestra, Wolfgang Puschnig, Bumi Fian, Oliver Kent, Hank Gradischnig, Karl Sayer, Christian Havel, Erwin Schmidt to name a few). She wrote songs and music for seven movies of Austrian director Xaver Schwarzenberger and she was featured on various radio shows and cultural events such as the opening to the Wiener Festwochen.\n\nIn 1999 she was again in New York starting to record her first solo album «Anna Lauvergnac» (which featured some of America and Europe top jazz musicians: Andy Bey, Pete Bernstein, John Di Martino, Boris Kozlov, Claus Raible, Fritz Pauer, Wolfgang Puschnig, Alegre Correa, Johannes Enders, Andy Scherrer) for the Swiss label TCB. When she returned to Europe mathias rüegg offered her to become the new singer of the Vienna Art Orchestra. In the following decade she appeared on hundreds of concerts with the band, performing at all the major European Jazz Festival as well as in China, Cuba, Canada and Russia. She recorded 12 CDs with the VAO, mostly for Universal Music.\n\nOn the side of her work with the orchestra she kept touring Europe with different groups collaborating with amazing artists such as Bojan Z, Alegre Corea, Fritz Pauer to name a few, and recorded the albums «You must believe in Spring» with the Till Martin quartet and «Come Closer» with the Julia Huelsmann trio.\n\nIn 2010 she formed her Pan-European quartet featuring Claus Raible, Giorgos Antoniou and Steve Brown. Since then the band performed in clubs and festivals in Europe and recorded two CDs, both nominated for the German Critic Prize. The second one won the award in 2014.\n\nHer voice is a velvety and smoky rich alto, her singing is direct, emotional and passionate. Her unique sense of phrasing and the unaffectedness of her interpretation reveal a profound music personality that while being deeply rooted in the Jazz idiom maintains a strong personal approach and marked individuality.\n\n“Praised by Sheila Jordan, Lauvergnac shares that veteran jazz artist’s willingness to risk unusual musical efforts” - Don Hackman, The Los Angeles Times\n\n“She’s all the expression you need and want from a beautiful singer“ - Mark Murphy, Jazz legend\n\n“Anna Lauvergnac sings, simply, as one should sing. Not only she sings perfectly in tune, but her voice is full of pathos, energy, poetry and emotion.” - Paolo Fresu, jazz trumpet player\n\nKarlheinz Miklin & Jazz Orchester Steiermark: \"NEXT PAGE\"\n\nALR 1055 | Listening to Karlheinz Miklin several times in small groups I got interested in his compositions, so the idea came up to arrange his music for big band (by Michael Abene).\n\nARTISTS:\n\nKarlheinz Miklin - saxesSigi Feigl - conductor\n\nMichael Abene - arrangements\n\nreed section:\n\nPatrick Dunst - alto, soprano, flute, clarinet\n\nLisi Stiger - alto, soprano, flute, clarinet\n\nTobias Pustelnik - tenor, soprano, clarinet\n\nWolfi Schiefer - tenor, soprano, clarinet\n\nGernot Strebl - baritone, bass-clarinet; (track 04, 05)\n\nOleksandr Ryndenko - baritone, bass-clarinet; (all except track 04, 05)\n\ntrumpet section:\n\nMario Stuhlhofer - lead\n\nGerhard Ornig\n\nDominic Pessl - ass. lead\n\nKarl Rossman\n\nMarkus Krofitsch\n\ntrombone section:\n\nReinhard Summerer - lead\n\nSascha Krobath\n\nMátyás Papp\n\nWolfgang Tischhart - b-trb.\n\nrhythm section:\n\nFabian Supancic - piano, el-piano\n\nThomas Wilding - double bass, el-bass\n\nKlaus Fürstner - drums\n\nThis is not my first CD entitled „Next page“. After having played mostly in trio format I started to work in quartet with Fritz Pauer, Ron McClure and the drummers Victor Lewis, Adam Nussbaum und Billy Hart in the nineties\n\n– defenitely opening a 'next page'. Later I came back to play mostly in trio again, besides my ongoing work with Argentine musicians for decades. That Michael Abene proposed to write arrangements of my compositions means an honour and another very important next page for me. It puts me in an unusual context but Michael – a true master - succeeded in keeping the meaning of my songs and enriched them with beautiful sounds and colors. I would not have started this project without the support of my dear friend Sigi Feigl. His knowledge and dedication were indespensable to make everything happen. I hope you enjoy!\n\nKarlheinz Miklin\n\nMy capacity for enthusiasm regarding big band music is unadulterated since my professional start in the early 1980’s. And almost since then an intense musical collaboration with Karlheinz Miklin had been along my way. Doing workshops with my first „big band baby“, the Big Band Süd, being my teacher and mentor at the Jazzdepartment in Graz and in the past years sharing the stage on bigbandish occasions once in a while. Therefore I’m extremly happy that it was possible – with the birth of another band - to bring this collaboration to another level. Performing and recording the music of Karlheinz Miklin with the handpicked and outstanding musicians of the brand-new „Jazz Orchester Steiermark“ is a wonderful piece of luck. The icing on this cake are the magnificant arrangements of great Michael Abene – who did an amazing job in putting „Charlie’s“ very personal music into a big band context. Happy and proud in having been a part of this project!\n\nSigi Feigl\n\nListening to Karlheinz Miklin several times in small groups I got interested in his compositions, so the idea came up to arrange his music for big band. Doing that I had second thoughts . Here was this wonderful musician who has composed some very interesting music over the years but has very rarely been associated with big bands. Various sizes of small groups yes. The challenge I faced is to try to write the arrangements in such a way as to leave Karlheinz free to play as he would in a small group. His compositions can vary from the craziness of a Joltz's Waltz, Monk-key to beautiful melodies such as Para Pochin and Palomar. Hopefully I have accomplished this. This was a fun and challenging recording to work on and hope you enjoy the finished project.\n\nMichael Abene, arrangements\n\nDon Menza Quartet: \"SONNY DAZE\"\n\nALR 1054 | This is the second release for Alessa Records, a double CD recorded live in May 2016 at the Jazzland in Vienna with Don Menza’s Austrian dreamteam, Oliver Kent - p, Hannes Strasser - db and Bernd Reiter - dr.\n\nARTISTS:\n\nDon Menza (USA) - tenorsax\n\nOliver Kent (A) - piano\n\nJohannes Strasser (A) - bass\n\nBernd Reiter (A) - drums\n\nSonny Rollins has always been a great inspiration for me and has shown me how important honesty in one’s music is...

Thank you guys for your enthusiastic performances!\n\nLooking forward to our next project ---- DON MENZA\n\nI was a student when I first met Don Menza in Graz about 10 years ago when he became the saxophone guest professor for two semesters. I could not really profit from Don’s incredible musicality and experience because I was just not good enough at that time, I was scared to even play one note with him…\n\nSome years later in 2011 I got the chance to do a brief tour with Don in Austria, Germany and Italy, hence meeting him “on stage”. This was truly a wonderful and special experience followed by many more through the last five years when we were touring Europe together with different projects and line-ups.\n\nDon himself is the best example for being 100% honest and strong in life and music, just being around him (and of course playing with him) is a special gift for me, as it is for any musician who he has worked with (and these are many including all the jazz greats).\n\nDon is a true giant, carrying on the jazz saxophone tradition of Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Sonny Rollins, Stan Getz etc. and showing younger musicians and audiences what “Real Jazz” is.\n\nThank you Don for all the musical and personal moments we shared through the years, I will never forget any of them and really learned a lot from you, as a musician and (even more important) as a human being!\n\nWe recorded this album for Don’s 80th birthday (unbelievable!!!), big thanks as well to Oliver and Hans for their great playing full of swing and spirit and their positive energy on and off the bandstand!\n\nLooking forward to many more ---- BERND REITER\n\nKristina Barta: \"EMA 29\"\n\nALR 1052 | Kristina Barta, whose real name is Kristýna Bártová, was born in Prague in the Czech Republic.

The tune “Baitina Scenery”, is dedicated to you.\n\nWolfgang Litterak and your whole family at the Weissenwolff hotel, Steyregg, Austria: “Yes come back and play concerts, yes come back anytime and stay as long as you need, yes, yes, yes”. “Never have I heard a no from anybody at Weissenwolff Hotel.”\n\nThe “bass” tune, “Floating fretless dreams” is dedicated to you, Wolfgang.\n\nYours sincerely, Per Mathisen.\n\nAnna Lauvergnac: \"COMING BACK HOME\"\n\nALR 1032| Anna Lauvergnac is an artist with a complex personality. In her many years with the Vienna Art Orchestra she used her voice as a horn in the sax section, duetted with A. Mears' didjeridoo and interpreted Ellington and Strayhorn ballads. But she never sounded so beautiful and fully expressive as with her own quartet, and \"Coming back home\", the 2nd recording of the band, is simply superb.\n\nTRACKLIST / SOUNDS\n\nLullaby of the Leaves / Be Still, My Soul / Get Out of Town / Soft Winds / Music Is / You`re My Thrill / Let`s Face the Music and Dance / I Know a Song / For Heaven's Sake / Nobody Else But Me / Coming Back Home\n\nHörbeispiele (MP3)\n\nHörbeispiele & Download auf ITunes\n\nARTISTS:\n\nAnna Lauvergnac - vocals\n\nClaus Raible - piano\n\nGiorgos Antoniou - bass\n\nSteve Brown - drums\n\nAnna Lauvergnac is an artist with a complex personality.\n\nIn her carreer she has been able to fit into many musical environments, keeping her distinct style and sound in every musical situation. In her many years with the Vienna Art Orchestra she used her voice as a horn in the saxophone section, duetted with Adrian Mears' didjeridoo and interpreted Ellington and Strayhorn ballads. She arranged and sang the opener for the Orchestra on the programs Nine Immortal Non Evergreens For Erich Doplhy ( for two voices and electronics, with the late Monica Trotz) and she appeared as a solo performer, both as actress and singer, in her humorous and poignant eight-minute introduction on the « A Centenary Journey » tour.\n\nIn her splendid first solo recording she courageously produced a full project of ballads, my favorites being her duets with jazz legend Andy Bey, she shone on Till Martin's spare arrangements and delighted audience and critics interpretating the compositions of Randy Newman with the Julia Huelsmann Trio.\n\nBut she never sounded so beautiful and fully expressive as with her own quartet, and \"Coming back home\", the second recording of the band, is simply superb.\n\nAnna Lauvergnac reaffirms her elegance in phrasing, excellence in rhythmic interpretation and uncommon sensitivity, the album is remarkable, a marriage of well-known and rarely-explored jazz standards, and four original songs. A pleasant peculiarity here is the judicious choice of extraordinarily modern-sounding compositions selected from the bursting jazz catalog of the 30's and 40's. It`s hard to believe that a song like \"You're My Thrill\" was written in 1934, not 2004.\n\nThe art of writing a song lies in the respect of a fragile balance between lyrics and melody, mood and sound, but most of all in the emotional and musical authenticity that a song needs to be expressive and sincere: the four original songs featured on this recording fulfill this task. They are a reverie of the four seasons: spring, light and fresh on \"I Know A Song\"; summer, hot and bright on \"Music Is\"; autumn, dusky and fragile on \"Coming Back Home\" and winter, contemplative and meditative on \"Be Still, My Soul\".\n\nThe quartet performs with flawless unity, yet each musician maintains a marked individuality that celebrates the strength and spirit of jazz. They transcend any lick or cliché and dive into the heart and essence of music.\n\nClaus Raible has something approaching telepathy with Anna Lauvergnac. Their synchronicity in unpredictable music movements is astounding as he breaks the rules of classic 'comping' to create a freer and fuller interdependence between melody, lyrics and harmony. As always, Raible proves to be able to draw power from the roots of modern jazz to flourish into his own personal musical language, delivering a serial of spectacular solos in which he takes risks and music phrases to the limits.\n\nLike an aerialist defying gravity, he creates unforeseen lines which soar with beauty and danger in a perfect balance between rhythmic urging and harmonic tension.\n\nFrom the first bar, bassist Giorgos Antoniou provides a platform for the music to glide with a warm depth and groove. His fabulous bass lines and distinctive harmonic sense melt elegance and a rootsy pulse. His solos are jewels.\n\nDrummer Steve Brown's dynamic drive is truly impressive. He swings on the cymbals, his beat is strong and he anticipates and supports the wide range of variations and moods. Brilliant on the up-tempos and intense on the ballads, he is a first-rate drummer - tasteful, imaginative and effective.\n\nLeroy Windwood\n\nQuotes & press\n\nAbout ANNA:\n\n\"Most appealing is her desire to cruise the cutting edges of jazz vocal performance.\" -Don Hackman, The Los Angeles Times\n\n\"She's all the expression you need a want from a beautiful singer\" Mark Murphy, Jazz Legend\n\n\"Anna Lauvergnacs elegantly simple and sometimes smoky vocals are at the center of the artistic creations, and gives them soul and mind.\" - Martin Laurentius, Jazzzeitung\n\n\"She puts the audience under the spell of her music, her voice, her charisma.\" - Christian Köpf, Donaukurier\n\nAbout CLAUS:\n\n\"Wherever he performs, the band members, other musicians in the audience, and last but not least the audience itself are amazed by his confidence in style, his fantasy of improvisation, and the stupendous virtuosity of his performance\" - Claus Regnault, Süddeutsche Zeitung\n\n\"Claus Raible plays with that style that embodies vitality and authority, which is real, captivating and fresh, yet without being nostalgic.\"- Hans-Jürgen Schaal, Jazz Critic\n\nAbout GIORGOS:\n\n\"Giorgos Antoniou weaves a subwoofing net in a wundrefully relaxed manner and with a \"conductive to the music\" attitude. In his solo work he doesn't just show off some skills but rather does scintilate by unobtrusiveness\". - Christian Köpf, Donaukurier\n\nAbout STEVE:\n\n\"On drums, Brown (a tall young man with an eager grin) is a delight. He has an urbane understatement and sidelong wit that adds zip and buoyancy to the sounds around him. Alert to every approaching detail, he fills out melodies with hissing hi-hat snaps and briefly jolting rolls, drops back to minimalist rimshots and erupts into fizzing cymbal swing with an effect like a door suddenly swung open to a busy street. An absolute\n\ntreasure.\" - John Fordham, The Guardian.\n\nAbout the band:\n\n\"Anna - together with her extraordinary traveling companions- has built up a complex architecture that in its apparent simplicity is directed toward music only.\" -Paolo Fresu\n\n\"Anna Lauvergnac with her excellent travel companions are a real band, able to reach such level of inspiration and communication that they turn a concert into an intense and unforgettable experience. And while even the most demanding Jazzpurist will be pampered, also Jazz newcomers will be introduced to what this music can be : not a mere show in which exposing abilities, but a real act of love.\" -Marcus A. Woelfle, Jazz Zeit\n\n\"Wonderful. Honest, and real, and soulful.\" - Sheila Jordan\n\nJohn B.

One could say the same of the jazz music of John B. Williams.\n\nMusic can relax, it can energize, it can arouse powerful emotions, and it can also take you on a cavation from the dreary, the dull, the dark and the small. In \"Arabesque\" John B. and his band of revelers instead take us to the lands of sun and surf and samba, where love is hot and the music hotter.\n\nJohn B. Willams\n\nThe world is getting smaller every day and musicians and music styles from all over the globe coming together in a fusion of sounds and rhythms, and amen to all !\n\nJohn B. Williams Band at studio And so you have Karen Asatrian (Bösendorfer acoustic piano and electric keyboards) from Armenia, Klemens Marktl (drums) and Robert Pockfuss (guitars) from Austria, Luis Ribeiro (percussions) from Brazil, Llew Matthews (keyboards on \"So You Say\") and John B. (basses) and his stunning wife (musically and otherwise!) Jessica (vocals) from the USA, each combing their passion, their heritage and their musical gifts to transport us to distant horizons.\n\nSo dive into the beats, swim far out into the warm ocean waters of tropical rhythms, have a mojito or a cold beer or a local caipirinha and a tall glass of caldinho de feijáo at the local hangout. Fall in love for the night with a dark-haired beauty (hombre or mujer!), sleep late and then dance the samba, rumba and mamba like your life depended on it. Because it does. That's what the music is for; it's what John B. and his amazing compadres have done here in \"Arabesque\": remind us all to live. (Bradley Rand Smith)\n\nJohn B. studierte Bass bei Ron Carter und war das erste Mal im Jahre 1968 mit dem Horace Silver Quintet in Österreich.
