His most common given year of birth is 1827-28 and his father was William Stanton. However I have a confusing choice of William Stantons and do not know how to resolve it.  \na) 1841 census cherry st, St Mary's Stafford. John Stanton (age 11) with Edward Stanton (G.father shoemaker 70), William Stanton (father shoemaker 45) Elizabeth",

        "text": "Ah it does look more like a different John Stanton. I looked at the record again and the Mary Lee marriage was 1883 possibly a bit early after the loss of Sarah and the children you mention do not appear on records. I have had a look around and there is a possible marriage to Mary Williams from Haverford west in Stafford 1890 which it looking more likely. Mind you he still ended up in West Derby by the look of things so no wonder things get confused.\n\nHurrah! Sucess at last! Well at least stronger leads than before. I have a work record now for John Stanton b. 1827 prison warder. However curiously his age is given as 23 and 7/12 and thus a birth year of around 1823/4 which contradicts other records. However a bit more investigating reveals a Mary Stanton ( a sister listed in the 1841 census where the family is transcribed as Stenton) and the Principle warder is..... Samuel Stanton b.1815 to William and Ellen Stanton. Which would make him John's older brother. I am wondering if it is possible that he fudged John's birth date to get him into the prison service or else it is a mistake as an old style 3 could look like an old style 7, without seeing the original I can only speculate. Anyway it moves John more over to the William and Ellen line."
