        "text": "Hitch Family Signatures\n\nLast Update: 08/19/2005 10:11 AM\n\nThis page provides scans of actual signatures of Hitch family members. They were scanned in GIF format for presentation here. If you have any old signatures you would like to contribute, send me an E-Mail. All that is needed is a good photocopy of the autograph. Then send it to me and I will scan it and post it here. Please remember to tell me where the signature originated (place and date, if known).\n\nE-Mail: mikehitch@mikehitch.com\n\nBack to the Hitch Genealogy page.\n\nThis is the signature of Gillis Hitch (1757/58-1847). He was born in Sussex Co., DE and died in Montgomery Co., IN. He served in the American Revolution as evidenced by Revolutionary War Pension File No. R5049. The signature comes from a letter in that file dated July 10, 1839.\n\nThis is the signature of Spencer Hitch (1796-1873). He was born in MD (probably Caroline Co.) and died in Greensboro, Caroline Co., MD where he is buried in the Old Methodist Churchyard. He was a banker in Greensboro and this signature comes from an old three-dollar note issued by the Farmers and Merchants Bank of \"Greensborough\" dated August 15, 1862.\n\nThis is the signature of John Oscar Whittington Hitch (1840-1862) from his Will dated April 30, 1861 in Vicksburg, MS. He was the son of Joshua Whittington and Mary Elizabeth (Dennis) Hitch. Joshua W. Hitch had moved from Worcester Co., MD to Vicksburg, Warren Co., MS in 1835. John O.W. Hitch wrote his will at such a young age because he was joining the 21st Mississippi Infantry in the Civil War. In the will, he states, \"Being about to depart to the wars and knowing the certainty of death at all times and that would be double more so in an engagement. . .\" J.O.W. Hitch was prophetic in that he was killed in the Battle for Malvern Hill, Virginia on July 1, 1862.\n\nThis is the signature of Mary Elizabeth (Dennis) Hitch, mother of J.O.W. Hitch above, as it appears on some probate documents with relation to her husband's death. This particular signature is from a document dated May 23, 1849. She was born on December 20, 1809 in MD, married Joshua Whittington Hitch in Worcester Co., MD on September 6, 1826, and died in Vicksburg, MS on April 28, 1857.\n\nThis is the signature of Melchisideck C. Hitch on a marriage bond from Edmonson Co., KY dated January 10, 1879. This bond was executed when he married his second wife, Millie Lancaster. Your guess is as good as mine as to how he got such an unusual given name. M.C. Hitch is believed to be the son of Clement G. and Elizabeth (Warder) Hitch who migrated to Barren Co., KY from Fauquier Co., VA in about 1811.\n\nThis is the \"mark\" of Sarah (Muir) Hitch, wife of Joseph Hitch (1765-1848). Sally Muir was born in MD (probably Somerset Co.) on April 20, 1782, married Joseph Hitch (son of Benjamin and Mary Pitts Hitch) on September 24, 1799, and died in Pendleton Co., KY on June 15, 1852. She and Joseph had moved to Pendleton County in April of 1807. This scan was taken from a letter she signed on March 6, 1848 acknowledging receipt of property she was left through the will of her husband.\n\nThis is the signature of Rebecca Jane Hitch, daughter of Joseph and Sarah (Muir) Hitch described above. She was born June 20, 1821 in Pendleton Co., KY and died there March 11, 1874. Rebecca married Alfred D. Moore (1819-1873) on June 20, 1847. This signature was taken from a letter she signed on March 6, 1848 acknowledging receipt of property she was left through the will of her father.\n\nThis is the signature of Rachel Shiles Hitch, daughter of Joseph and Sarah (Muir) Hitch described above. She was born March 13, 1828 in Pendleton Co., KY and died there August 18, 1861. Rachel married Cassius A. Wanderlohr on November 30, 1857. This signature was taken from a letter she signed on March 6, 1848 acknowledging receipt of property she was left through the will of her father.\n\nThis is the signature of Luther Muir Hitch, son of Joseph and Sarah (Muir) Hitch described above. He was born October 23, 1811 in Pendleton Co., KY and died there September 8, 1873. Luther married Mary A. Best (1821-1895) on December 17, 1837. This signature was taken from an eviction notice he sent to Mr. Jared Woodworth dated December 4, 1857.\n\nThis is the signature of Robert Hamilton Hitch, son of Joseph and Sarah (Muir) Hitch described above. He was born February 26, 1815 in Pendleton Co., KY and died there August 23, 1877. Robert H. married Abigail Charlotte Sherwin (1832-1923) on July 2, 1849. This signature was taken from a letter he wrote to his cousin Charlotte Vickers dated March 22, 1863. He was a well-respected and educated man who was a scholar of the Bible and the arts. He loved the works of William Shakespeare so much so that he named his first son William Shakespeare Hitch (1850-1927).\n\nThis is the signature of Rufus McClain Hitch, son of Lewis (Levin) (1808-1857) and Lucy (Fitch) (1816-??) Hitch of Adams Co., IL. Lewis Hitch had moved from MD to Illinois sometime before 1838. Rufus M. Hitch was born in Beverly, Adams Co., IL on April 4,, 1852 and died May 25, 1925. He married first Henrietta E. Spink (1852-1880) on September 11, 1873 in McLean Co., IL and second Emma Frances Baxter (1863-1936) on October 18, 1883 in Griggsville, Pike Co., IL. This signature was taken from a biography done of him in the Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois with Commemorative Biographies, Munsell Publishing Co., Chicago, 1926. Rufus was a prominent force in the Education community of Illinois throughout his life and even had a school named for him there that still exists today."
