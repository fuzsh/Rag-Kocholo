        "text": "Bardstown, Ky. (November 7, 2018) — Flaget Memorial Hospital has named its Daisy Award and Rose Award winners for the third quarter of 2018. Lauren Beavers, RN, Flaget Birth Center, received the Daisy Award. Gayle Sweeney, Office Coordinator, Bariatric Services, received the Rose Award.\n\nThe Daisy Award is a nationwide program that celebrates the extraordinary clinical skill and compassionate care given by nurses every day. Flaget Memorial Hospital is proud to be a Daisy Award Partner, recognizing a nurse with this special honor every quarter. This quarter, Beavers was nominated for the Daisy Award by a patient of the Flaget Birth Center.\n\n“All were great, but I had Lauren the most,” the patient said when describing the nursing team at Flaget Memorial Hospital. “Lauren made me more comfortable and less nervous about my entire experience.”\n\nSimilar to the Daisy Award, the Rose Award is a program that honors Flaget Memorial Hospital’s non-nursing personnel. The Rose Award, short for Recognition of Service Excellence, celebrates unsung heroes who work tirelessly to provide the best possible service. This quarter, Sweeney was nominated for the Rose Award by two patients at Flaget Memorial Hospital.\n\n“Speaking from my personal experience, Gayle always went above and beyond when dealing with me,” one patient said. “Anytime I had a question or concern, she would always be more than glad to assist me in a timely and friendly manner. She made a nervous time for me feel less hectic and for that I am grateful.”\n\nThe Daisy Award winner received a certificate, Daisy Award pin and a hand-carved stone sculpture. The Rose Award winner was honored with a certificate, Rose Award pin and a bouquet of roses to display in her department.\n\nDaisy Award photo information (from left to right): Amanda Carey, RN, House Manager; Kami Poole-Warder, CNO; Rick VanCise, Vice President, Operations; Lauren Beavers, RN, Award Recipient; Delisa Arnold, RN, Director, OB & SNU; Dawn Hill, RN; Jennifer Nolan, President; Michele Riley, RN, Risk Manager.\n\nRose Award photo information (from left to right): Jennifer Nolan, President; Rick VanCise, Vice President, Operations; Michelle Mattingly, Director, Pharmacy; Cassi Johnson, Appointment Scheduler; Kami Poole-Warder, CNO; Kacy Perkins, CMA; Gayle Sweeney, Office Coordinator, Award Recipient; Diane Edelen, Patient Account Representative; Tiffany Johnson, Scheduler/Surgery Coordinator; Krista Morris, CMA; Anna Culver, Bariatric RN Coordinator; Dr. Robert Farrell, Weight Loss & General Surgeon; Rhonda Johnson, Appointment Scheduler; Hannah Moore, PA-C; Tiffany Ellingsworth, Practice Manager.\n\nAbout Flaget Memorial Hospital\n\nFlaget Memorial Hospital is located in Bardstown, Ky.
