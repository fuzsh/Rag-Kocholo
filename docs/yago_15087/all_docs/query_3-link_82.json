Where I have any real doubt, the details are shown in red.\n\n1813-1824\n\nContact me\n\nShalfleet Parish Records\n\nShalfleet Sources\n\nNote: These pages are my transcriptions of original documents, they are accurate to the best of my ability but I do not take any responsibility for errors. This information is for personal use only. This is very much a solo effort, so if anybody is willing to further validate the records (which will involve visiting the Newport Records Office) please let me know."
