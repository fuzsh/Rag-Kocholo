        "text": "Susan Davis – behind the music and special events at FOA for 23 years\n\nBy DIANNE RUSSELL\n\nPhotos by Mary Hurlbut\n\nIf you’ve enjoyed the incredible concert series at Festival of the Arts (FOA), attended Family Day or been dazzled by the Festival Runway Fashion Show, you have Director of Special Events Susan Davis to thank. From award-winning musicians to Le PeTiT CiRqUe, during her 23-year career at FOA, Davis has delivered the best in music and magical happenings to attendees.\n\nAlthough she recently retired, Davis is still a presence at the Festival of Arts. “I booked the music for this summer, so I’m hanging out and saying hello to the musicians. I’ve dealt with so many of the bands for years,” she said. The number of musicians she schedules per summer is mind-boggling. During a Festival season – 55 nights with two performances a day on weekends – she books 60-70 concerts.\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nSusan Davis\n\nHowever, Davis – fueled by her passion for music and art – had an ulterior motive behind her creation of fabulous entertainment.\n\nWhen she started as director of events, “One of my goals was to bring some energy to the Festival of Arts grounds. My other goal was to bring in first-time visitors, who might come for the music, but while here they are exposed to all the other great things that the Festival is, namely our extraordinary art exhibit and our world-famous Pageant of the Masters.”\n\nDavis is well-versed in art history. She grew up on Long Island and graduated from Emmanuel College in Boston with a BA in Art History.\n\n“I was going to college in Boston in the early ‘70s,” she said. “A lot was happening; it was the time of the anti-war protests and hippie life and being in a college town was wild fun.”\n\nBefore moving to Southern California, Davis lived in New York, Boston, Chicago, Houston and Detroit.\n\n“When I arrived here in Laguna, I was a newly single mom with two daughters,” she said.\n\nFate leads Davis to the Festival of Arts\n\nA happenstance meeting sent her in the direction of the FOA.\n\n“I met the director of guest services, who learned I was looking for a job in my field,” she explained. “One thing led to another, and I took a job in the Pageant Box Office selling Pageant tickets to get a ‘foot in the door.’ Through a series of opportunities, I was made director of special events and member services.”\n\nThat was in 2001 and over the next 23 years, she developed a summer concert series that brings world-class musicians to their stage. Davis considers the concert series her favorite accomplishment while at FOA.\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nDavis on the night of a Santana tribute band\n\n“The success of the evening music performances didn’t happen overnight. It grew over years,” Davis said. “The level of musicians also grew with time and many nights we have grammy-winning performers on our stage.\n\n“With the encouragement of the Festival’s board of directors, things began to develop. We eventually got a world-class sound system with the guidance of Production Manager Sid Greenbaum. We also have a wonderful performance stage that we’ve had for the past seven years.”\n\nConsidering the number of musicians Davis has booked over the years, it’s surprising there’ve only been a few snafus – once when a band didn’t show up, she called pianist Scott Wilkie (a frequent wonderful FOA performer) who cut a Home Depot visit short and speeded over to play.\n\n“Pianist Tom Zink was stung by a bee before a performance. He was quickly treated, came back and finished his entire performance,” she said. “And Grammy Award singer Melissa Manchester broke her leg three days before the FOA Annual Gala, yet she appeared anyway.” That proves the adage – “the show must go on.”\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nIt all began in the Box Office\n\nOne of the most popular Festival events is the Runway Fashion Show – now in its 15th year – which was also Davis’ idea. “Dan Duling, the scriptwriter for the Pageant, suggested I go see a theater production in L.A. by the “99 Cent Production Company,” she explained. “Everything they did, the sets and costumes, were all made from things from the 99 Cents Store. I said to Festival board member Pat Kollenda, who attended the performance with me, ‘Exhibiting Festival artists can do this but instead of using 99 Cents Store items, we could use recycled materials, make a runway competition out of it’ and that’s how the Festival Runway Fashion Show was born.”\n\nClick open story button to continue reading…\n\nOpen story in new window…\n\nFair Game\n\nBy TOM JOHNSON\n\nKids return to school, the Fire Association endorses Hallie Jones for City Council and Village Laguna plans candidates’ forum\n\nThis Thursday the kids head back to school.\n\nI’ll be honest, as a kid I hated school. When summer started coming to a close I’d begin getting depressed. The night before that first day back, which was usually the Tuesday following Labor Day, I’d lie in bed, toss and turn all night, and think, “How far off is Christmas vacation?”\n\nBack then it seemed so far in the future that I’d think, “Well, we have a three-day weekend coming up with Columbus Day, then Veterans Day and finally in November we get four days for Thanksgiving. I can make this.”\n\nIt somehow got me through. But barely.\n\nAt the time, I would guess I had some level of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivty Disorder, today simply called ADHD. Back then, instead of some type of treatment, you’d have your parents yelling at you, “I know you can do better…you just have to apply yourself!” It really wasn’t their problem…they didn’t know. Restrictions and punishment usually followed.\n\nGo figure, heck, I’d hardly pay attention to even what they had to say.\n\nActually, in the 1950s and 1960s, ADHD was referred to as “Minimal Brain Dysfunction Syndrome.” That seemed right to me…“minimal brain!”\n\nSymptoms of ADHD were just beginning to be diagnosed and wouldn’t become mainstream for another decade or two.\n\nI remember back then being sent to a church counseling session one weekend in the next town over, probably around my early teens. Kids sat in a circle and shared their “failures” or “shortcomings” in life.\n\nA girl around me said something like, “I ran away from home, drank and did drugs, slept around…and I hate my parents.” Yikes!\n\nA teenage guy talked about nearly murdering someone in a fight, as a cigarette dangled from his lips.\n\nThe hour or so left an impression…or maybe better said, “A scar.”\n\nWhen the discussion came around to me, I had nothing to add. I cowered and said, “I once talked back to my folks.”\n\nI realized I was a woose, in the worst way!\n\nThe kid up for attempted murder basically looked at me thinking, “Who is this clown?” I just kept my head down at all costs avoiding eye contact, thinking he’d probably want to take me out at the bike racks after the meeting.\n\nI went home and begged my folks to never, ever send me back. In the moment, I promised I’d do better.\n\nStill, my efforts at school and at home didn’t change. The folks would try again, saying something to the effect of, “We know you’re as smart or smarter than your brother, you just have to try,” they pleaded.\n\nMy response would be something like, “What about better looking than him?”\n\nAnyway, it was always a struggle.\n\nMy senior year I was accepted to San Diego State, with one caveat. First, you have to remember, back in the early ‘70s, you didn’t need an SAT score of 1,100+. Times have changed! I chose it because it was the furthest place from home without paying out-of-state tuition.\n\nAnyway, the caveat was I needed a 3.5 GPA my final semester. With my back against the wall…I pulled a 4.0. And never looked back.\n\nStill, every year as the new school year approaches, I feel bad for the kids today for what lies ahead. Most will be fine…they love it and get excited to learn new things, meet their teachers and make friends.\n\nBut, for those like me, please, handle them with care…they’ll get there eventually…I promise.\n\nBTW, Christmas vacation starts on December 20…only 122 days or so away. You can make it!\n\n• • •\n\nThe Laguna Beach Firefighters Association, International Association of Firefighters Local 3684 has endorsed Hallie Jones for City Council, according to Association President Tom Padden.\n\n“Candidates all talk a good game around ‘public safety’ while campaigning for office, but Hallie Jones is the ‘real deal,’ with a substantial track record of helping the Fire Department mitigate our extreme wildfire hazard throughout Laguna Beach,” Padden noted.\n\n“During her 10 years as Executive Director of the Laguna Canyon Foundation, Hallie and her colleagues partnered with the Fire Department to develop and implement what the former Executive Director of the California Coastal Commission described as the most environmentally sensitive fuel modification program they had ever seen, worthy of being used as a model throughout California.\n\n“Having worked closely with her for many years, Laguna Beach firefighters know that Hallie is a strong supporter of fire safety and will be an effective advocate on Council for measures needed to protect this community,” Padden added.\n\n• • •\n\nVillage Laguna is hosting a City Council candidates’ forum Tuesday, Aug. 27 beginning at 6 p.m. at City Hall.

By this time, I’d be movin’ – in the meantime, here in our little piece of Paradise, it was sunny and 78 degrees with inviting ocean temps in the low 70s.\n\nHurricane Ernesto is finally out of the picture as it races to the NE at 22 mph after a direct hit on Bermuda, the 13th time since 1871 that’s happened. Bermuda is such a small target, a mere 21 miles long and 1.5 miles wide, so there have been more near misses than there have been direct hits. The peak season is rapidly approaching, and September 10 marks the pinnacle date of possible maximum potential for development of tropical systems.\n\nHere at 9 p.m. on Sunday, it looked like things were going to be fairly quiet for at least the upcoming week, which is a good thing. Stronger than normal upper-level shear winds are stumping upward. They are moving warm unstable air into the higher reaches of the atmosphere as the expansive dust plume from the Sahara is still pretty much running the show. The surrounding surface ocean temps are being moderated into slightly cooler temps as radiation from the sun is not running at full strength – so it’s a more hostile environment down there as we enter the fourth week of August.\n\nNormally by late August, the giant dust cloud from the Sahara has dissipated somewhat and is pretty much gone by early September. But this year has seen stronger than normal easterly winds which is actually a good thing. The NOAA and the NHC are still calling for a record number of tropical systems in the Atlantic and a record low number of tropical systems in the Eastern Pacific but there have been eight systems so far in the EPAC with two more waiting in the wings. As a result, it’s not acting like a normal La Niña at all up to this point. Local ocean temps were really up on Sunday evening with 73-74 degrees in town and 77 in San Clemente.\n\nLast week’s 4.4 shaker really rattled nerves around here. The epicenter was right under South Pasadena, and it seemed quite a bit stronger because the quake – at four miles deep – was so shallow. Seismically, it’s been pretty quiet as of late, so we were due. Over the decades I’ve been a part of some real shakers. In July 1952, there was a 7.5 up by Bakersfield. I was almost 5, but I remember all the violent shaking that shattered a couple of the windows in my folks’ little house in Hollywood where I was born. I was rudely awakened and shaken out of bed at 6 a.m. on February 9, 1971, by the 6.6 rock ‘n’ roller in Sylmar. That one lasted a whole minute, but it felt like an hour.\n\nAt 2:24 a.m. on July 9, 1986, there was a 6.0 at 2:20 a.m. at Windy Point near Palm Springs that woke me up quick, as it was a shallow five miles deep. Five days later at 7 a.m. a 5.5 shaker happened a few miles off Oceanside. I was riding my bike through town when the shaking started and watched that big front window at the Fingerhut Gallery get wrenched out, falling into a hundred pieces on the sidewalk on the corner of PCH and Forest Avenue. On October 1, 1987, a 6.0 struck near Whittier, about 40 miles up the road at 4 a.m., which rudely shook me out of my deep slumber. Seems like these shakers always happen way too early in the morning.\n\nMore on shakers next time, ALOHA!\n\nOpen story in new window…\n\nLOCA hits a home run with Angels at Boys & Girls Club\n\nLOCA Arts Education partnered with the Angels Baseball Foundation in presenting a children’s art workshop at Boys & Girls Club in Laguna Beach recently.\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nPhotos by Mike Tauber\n\n(L-R) President of Angels Baseball John Carpino and LOCA representative Rich Fair\n\nJohn Carpino, president of Angels Baseball came to meet the kids, answer questions and relive memories of the club. “My three kids came here, and I was a basketball coach here – this is a real special place,” he said. He mingled among LOCA representatives Rich Fair, KC Mechling and Mike Tauber, and LOCA art teachers Sherry Bullard, Allison Keefe, Lisa Rainey and Brittney Silva. Staff from Boys & Girls Club, on hand to support the capacity crowd included Cody Howell, Mar Stash and Steve Sliwoski who said, “It’s always great when LOCA is teaching here, they are fabulous as always, but bringing in the Angels brought this to the next level!”\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nBase bowling\n\nKids migrated between three workstations, each with an activity custom designed by LOCA for the event. One was a printmaking station, where kids dipped bats, balls and cleats in paint and created abstract designs on watercolor paper. “We did a lot of out-of-the-box thinking as we developed the projects,” said Allison Keefe. “It shows how you can use found objects in the creation of art.” Another project nicknamed “base bowling” involved one kid tossing a paint-dipped ball across a giant floor canvas, and another kid catching it. “We were lucky to have lots of space to do this,” said Lisa Rainey, “it was very hands-on, active, playful and messy!” she said. A student named Cody, on his fourth roll, said “I want to go again,” as the game erupted in laughter and cheers for each other. The Jackson Pollack-style finished art was disassembled, and each child took home a signed section.\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nA young attendee designs a “Thank You” card to be sent to Angels Baseball\n\nThe third project was the creation of thank you notes to be sent to Angels Baseball. Kids learned how to draw the iconic “A” logo, along with a baseball diamond and sports equipment. “Thank you notes are very important,” said student Penelope. The event concluded with a gathering of the kids singing happy birthday, on camera, to Arte Moreno, owner of the Los Angeles Angels. Hats and jerseys featuring Mike Trout #27, were distributed to each child, along with tickets to an upcoming game.\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\n“Thank You” cards\n\n“One of the pillars of the Angels Baseball Foundation is to nurture the artistic and creative potential of kids through art and education. We are excited to partner with these great organizations to make a positive impact in the community,” said Dennis Kuhl, president of the Angels Baseball Foundation.\n\nFor more information about the Angels Baseball Foundation, visit www.angels.com/community.\n\nTo join LOCA membership or subscribe to the eNewsletter, visit www.locaarts.org/.\n\nBuy angels tickets at www.mlb.com/angels/tickets.\n\nOpen story in new window…\n\nA glimpse at Crystal Cove in Summer\n\nCrystal Cove Conservancy has kicked off the 2024 summer season with extensive programming for all ages that span from the beach to the trails.

This collection marks a significant expansion of the museum’s permanent collection, focusing on pieces by influential California artists, works exploring the nexus of art and nature, and those by a diverse range of California-based artists with a particular effort to increase representation of women. Additionally, the exhibition aims to broaden contemporary themes by featuring artworks created after the year 2000.\n\nThe artworks, spanning over a century of creation, encompass a diverse array of mediums including sculpture, mixed media, film, painting and large-format color photography. Notably, a series of John Humble’s photographs titled Sunday Morning will be highlighted as a standalone mini-exhibition.\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nPhotos courtesy of LAM\n\nPatrick Wilson, “Inside Space,” 2020, promised gift of Bob and Ann Myers\n\nMore than simply displaying these new acquisitions, the exhibition serves as a gesture of gratitude to the generous individuals who donated these artworks to the Laguna Art Museum. Among the artists featured are Jay McCafferty, Woods Davy, Roger Kuntz, Astrid Preston, Millard Owen Sheets, Craig Stecyk and newcomers to the collection such as Mark Bennett, Sergei Bongart, Carole Caroompas, Jedediah Caesar, Rosson Crow, Fannie Eliza Duvall, John Frost, Jimi Gleason, Jennifer Gunlock, Grace Carpenter Hudson, Tom Lamb, Robert Landry, Malerie Marder, Carter Mull, Evan Nesbit, Deborah Oropallo, Phil Paradise, Rozeal, Richard Roth, Heidi Schwegler, Robert Standish, Jennifer West and Patrick Wilson.\n\nJohn Humble’s Sunday Afternoon series features images of industrial areas near the Port of Los Angeles. He took these photos when there were no cars, trucks, or work activities, revealing scenes that are remarkably quiet. Humble is interested in photographing these locations because they show what large parts of Los Angeles look like. These are places rarely visited or experienced by most people, and even less seen when businesses are closed for the weekend.\n\nHumble used a large format film camera to create detailed color photographs. He frequently set up his camera in the middle of abandoned streets, draped a black curtain over his head to block out light and adjusted the tripod to handle uneven surfaces, ensuring he captured the perfect shot. The stillness of these images helps viewers notice hyper-realistic and intricate details in the buildings and surroundings that are usually missed.\n\nHumble is a distinguished photographer who has made Los Angeles his home since 1974. His career has been shaped by his military service in Vietnam, his tenure as a photojournalist at the Washington Post and his advanced studies at the San Francisco Art Institute. His work is in the collection of institutions around the world, and he has exhibited in many prestigious museums including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Library of Congress, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and The J. Paul Getty Museum where he had a solo exhibition in 2007.\n\nNew Hours for August\n\nTo celebrate the final weeks of summer, Laguna Art Museum (LAM) is staying open one hour later every Friday in August, until 6 p.m. Enjoy their current exhibitions after work or school with an enhanced Laguna Art Museum experience, including music and refreshments.\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nPhotos courtesy of LAM\n\nBarbara MacGillivray at Neighborhood Nights\n\nLAM introduces Art Museum Neighborhood Nights\n\nAll summer long, locals can take advantage of a free night at the Laguna Art Museum (LAM) with a raffle, tours, local food and drinks (LAM is collaborating with local spots), and activities for the entire family.\n\nEach part of the Laguna community has their own night.\n\nFree nights (5-7 p.m.)\n\nThursday, Sept. 12 – Top of the World\n\nExhibitions:\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\n“Skyward” by Eric Theodore\n\nReflections of Resilience through August 25\n\nReflections of Resilience presents a sampling of the artwork from the 2024 Master of Fine Art graduates from Laguna College of Art + Design (LCAD).

He joined the James Harman’s band in 1980 and stayed playing his guitar until 1988, when he briefly helped with Roomful of Blues. In 2009, Ramos backed Bobby Jones at the Notodden Blues Festival. In 1999, 2000 and 2001, WC Handy nominated him for Best Blues Record of the Year, Best Blues Guitarist, Best Song Winner 2001, and recipient of the 2014 OC music Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nBrian Templeton is a vocalist, songwriter and harmonica player. Templeton has blues music in his DNA, as they say. He is probably best known for his work with The Radio Kings, and plying his trade with The Delta Generators who he still plays the harmonica with and provides lead vocals. Recently, he joined forces to form another band with a more eclectic take of the blues music genre.

For more arts stories as well as our arts calendars, visit www.stunewslaguna.com/arts.\n\nNever underestimate the impact adult recognition makes in a child’s life. For longtime Festival of Arts (FOA) exhibitor Kirsten Whalen, that moment arrived in kindergarten when her artwork received an honorable mention and appeared in the local newspaper. “I’ll never forget it,” she said. “When anybody tells you you’ve done something unique and interesting and valuable, it sticks in your head. You take it forward. It’s so meaningful.”\n\nWhalen’s experience came full circle this year when she served as one of the final judges of the FOA’s 77th Annual Junior Art Awards. “We have to honor students’ creative work,” she said. “It’s so exciting for the kids and inspiring [for the rest of us].”\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nKirsten Whalen (far right), of the FOA Foundation, presented the awards alongside fellow judge Nancy Darnall and sponsor Mark Porterfield. Kindergartner Matilda Martinez won the Director’s Award and the Kindergarten Postcard Award for “Cute Fury Yeti.”\n\nThe FOA Junior Art Exhibition is the culmination of a process that begins when the Orange County Department of Education solicits art submissions from all Orange County schools for the annual OCArts4All program. This year, the county received 1,500 submissions from 99 schools. A team of FOA jurors selected more than 300 of these submissions to showcase at the Junior Art Exhibit throughout the summer. Last Sunday, the Festival held their annual awards ceremony, honoring students at every grade level and across several mediums, ultimately awarding 69 medals to young artists.\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nThe 2024 Junior Art Exhibit Award winners, jurors, presenters, supporters and educators gathered to celebrate on Sunday, Aug. 11\n\nBut the picture of arts education isn’t entirely rosy, highlighting the need for programs like this. Whalen pointed to falling submission rates, which have been dropping over the past decade. Even prior to the pandemic, she witnessed a decline. “We used to have four rooms of tables piled high with artwork. It was down to two before COVID, and it’s shrunk dramatically since. That’s really disturbing to me,” she said.\n\nSubmissions dipped to an all-time low in 2021 (down to only 500). The program regained some momentum in 2022 and held steady from last year, but Whalen hopes for significant improvement. Some educators point to an increased emphasis on STEM programming, and a hyper-focus on test scores. Whalen notes the overwhelming workloads burdening teachers and some districts’ deemphasis on the arts. Laguna, she said, is extremely fortunate in its rich arts education program. Not all Orange County schools can compete.\n\nWhatever the cause, all this adds up to the increasing importance and relevance of programming like the FOA’s Junior Art Exhibition and the Junior Art Awards.\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nFamily, friends and teachers gathered at the FOA grounds last Sunday to celebrate their students’ accomplishments\n\nWendy Wu, an arts teacher in the La Habra City School District, was honored this year for her outstanding contributions to elementary arts education. After California voters passed Proposition 28 in 2022, and money was directed to local schools to fund arts education, Wu was finally offered a full-time position with benefits. Today she’s the only arts teacher for that district, teaching eight classes per day, grades TK (transitional kindergarten) through 6th, across six different Title 1 schools.\n\n“The district didn’t have a budget for elementary arts education,” Wu said, noting she’s been teaching part-time for years. “Students didn’t have exposure to art, especially the visual arts. Once I started, they were so excited. Many of them had no experience using a brush, paint or other basic supplies. They were just grateful I was there, and happy to be in an environment that was so open. Everything was new to them.”\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nArts Educator Wendy Wu appearing with award-winning work by 2nd grader Harvey Mayhall\n\nWu wheels her art cart from classroom to classroom, estimating she teaches between 1,800 and 2,400 students across the various grade levels and half-dozen schools. In some classrooms, she has less than 20 minutes to teach a lesson. Nonetheless, 17 of Wu’s students were chosen for this year’s show and 6th grader Alan Huizar was selected to have his work showcased at the Samueli Theater at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts this spring.\n\nClick open story button to continue reading…\n\nOpen story in new window…\n\nLAM presents the Directors Circle Dinner and Awards Night on September 26\n\nLaguna Art Museum (LAM) has announced the Directors Circle Dinner and Awards Night, an annual event that brings together an exclusive group of museum members whose philanthropic support allows the museum’s mission to flourish. This year’s event will take place on Thursday, Sept. 26 at Crystal Cove State Park, offering an evening of gratitude, exquisite dining and celebration.\n\nThe evening will commence with a cocktail reception followed by dinner overlooking the California coast. During the evening, the museum will present the Anna Hills Award to Betsy and Gary Jenkins for their exceptional generosity towards Laguna Art Museum.\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nCourtesy of LAM\n\nBetsy and Gary Jenkins, recipients of the Anna Hills Award\n\nThe Anna Hills Award is named after the brilliant early 20th century landscape and seascape painter, a founding member of Laguna Art Museum and Laguna Beach community leader, Anna Hills. This award honors those who have gone above and beyond in their service to the institution. Gary and Betsy Jenkins have been incredibly generous supporters of the museum – going well beyond the financial support they provide. They are passionate about the museum’s place in Laguna as the first and arguably the most important arts organization in a town, which has been inextricably connected to the arts from even before the city’s founding.\n\nThey are among the first to enthusiastically support the activities and programming the museum brings to the community. For those who have the pleasure of visiting their home, you’ll see a wonderful collection of artworks that were bought in contribution to the museum. In addition to championing the mission of the museum, they contribute to the cultural life in Laguna by serving at many organizations throughout the city.\n\n“Laguna Art Museum is the crown jewel in Laguna’s long and lustrous history as an art colony,” said Betsy Jenkins. “Founded in 1918 by artists, the museum is still today beloved and supported by artists everywhere as well as the general public. Gary and I first joined as members in 1980 and are proud to have remained passionate advocates for the museum throughout the decades. We are so very honored to be chosen as recipients of the Anna Hills Award.”\n\nThe Directors Circle is comprised of a diverse group of members from various backgrounds such as philanthropy, filmmaking, business, environmental and community development. They all share a profound love for the museum and are instrumental in the success of the museum. Last year, the Directors Circle enabled the museum to serve 4,000 Title 1 students, host history-making exhibitions and offer four times the number of programs for the community.\n\nThe Directors Circle Dinner and Awards Night is an annual event that brings together the museum members whose philanthropic support allows the museum’s mission to flourish. This year’s event will take place on Thursday, Sept. 26, at Crystal Cove’s Historic District, overlooking the dazzling coastline, and offering an evening of gratitude, exquisite dining and celebration. Beyond the annual Dinner and Awards Night, the Directors Circle gathers on several occasions throughout the year to deepen members’ relationships with the arts and with one another. These lively parties are often at private homes with collectors, curators and notable artists.\n\nIf you are looking to unite with others who are dedicated to making an impact in our community – while also having a great time – consider joining this unique group. Directors Circle Member engagement impacts and supports the museum in multiple ways, ensuring the mission to enlighten and engage people of all ages with art that embodies the California experience.\n\nJo Situ Allen, who is being honored as Artist of the Year, has provided visual inspiration for this year’s Directors Circle Dinner and Awards Night. Directors Circle members will receive an artwork designed by Situ Allen specially for the occasion.\n\nLaguna Art Museum is located at 307 Cliff Drive in Laguna Beach, on the corner of Coast Highway and Cliff Drive.\n\nFor more information, visit www.lagunaartmuseum.org.\n\nOpen story in new window…\n\nArt-A-Fair: Upcoming offerings at Laguna’s “Festival Without Borders” range from exhibits to workshops, music to puppies\n\nBy THERESA KEEGAN\n\nThis story is a part of our Arts section. For more arts stories as well as our arts calendars, visit www.stunewslaguna.com/arts.\n\nThis summer appreciation and admiration of both artists and visitors are flourishing under the canvas tarps of Art-A-Fair. “It’s changed a lot,” said participating artist Barbara Palmer-Davis. “The artists juried in keep getting better and better. This year is the best.”\n\nIndeed, a walk through the festival reveals an impressive array of booths, with colorful and impressive art in a variety of mediums, from traditional oil and pastels to woodworking, glass, beading and textile. Touted as a “Festival Without Borders” there is also a distinct international perspective. Palmer-Davis, who has been showing at the festival for 30 years, has a booth next to an artist from South Africa.\n\n“I really enjoy talking with him,” she said, adding that conversations extend well beyond artistic techniques and there’s been a deep camaraderie among the artists this summer.\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nPhoto by Theresa Keegan\n\nThe display areas at this year’s Art-A-Fair festival are opened up and flow into each other. Attendees can drift among the displays of 115 artists from throughout the world.\n\nIn addition to the diverse range of artists, the workshops at Art-A-Fair have also been popular this year.\n\n“We had more workshop signups online this year, before we even opened, than we completed last year,” said Emilee Reed, an exhibitor and instructor at Art-A-Fair.\n\nWith 19 different instructors, and topics ranging from jewelry making to art pour, watercolors and even gourd making, the diversity of the workshops is appealing. There is at least one, and sometimes two, workshops a day.\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nCourtesy of Laguna Art-A-Fair\n\nMany workshops are held at the central gazebo area of Laguna Art-A-Fair, where passersby can see classes in action\n\n“Even if they (visitors) don’t have workshops on their mind they see it (classes) happening when they visit, and then they want to sign up,” said Reed. “It’s just a fun experience to get to know a little about a particular thing you’re interested in.”\n\nArtist Sandra Morrison, who has been at Art-A-Fair for the past two years and is leading workshops this summer, said the reasons people attend the workshops are as diverse as the attendees.\n\n“Some people just love doing workshops and take all different things because they want to learn and have a good time, and others want to increase their skills,” she said. “I think everybody has different reasons for taking the workshops.”\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nCourtesy of Sandra Morrison\n\nArtist Sandra Morrison (left) is thrilled she can connect with people who visit her booth at Art-A-Fair\n\nLooking at the artwork is also an inspiration to many who visit the summer festivals and some sign up for the workshops after they’re on site, if space is available.\n\n“When someone walks into Art-A-Fair, they walk in and look around and say, ‘Wow!’ I think they are really inspired by everything they see,” said Morrison.\n\nHer workshop on discovering pastels has been well received. “In the workshops we’ve had a lot of happy people who are pleased in what they’re creating.”\n\nAnd she expects interest in the Festival will remain strong and even increase as the summer winds down. History supports her theory.\n\n“The last three weeks, it really picks up,” she said. “There’s that sense of urgency ‘If I don’t go now, it’s going to go away.’” Sales also pick up as people return for what she calls a “second touch” – an opportunity to revisit something they had seen earlier in the summer but weren’t ready to purchase at the time.\n\n“Art is a crapshoot,” she said. “You just never know when someone will buy something.”\n\nAlso, the upcoming special events at Art-A-fair should bring in people from throughout Orange County.\n\nPalmer-Davis can’t wait for the Ohio Trio to come to the festival. Their re-creation of music by The Platters is a favorite for many. “I can’t wait to go dance when they’re here,” she said.\n\nMorrison thinks the upcoming “Tails @Twilight” event on August 22 will be a big draw. Billed as “An Evening of Art, Tail-Wagging Fun and Puppy Kisses,” the event benefits local animal organizations. There will be a special happy hour menu offered by the venue’s restaurant, live music and a silent auction. It is bittersweet to already be thinking about the season closing, said Morrison.\n\nClick open story button to continue reading…\n\nOpen story in new window…\n\nBGCLB, also serving Saddleback Valley, hosts 9th Annual “Night Under the Stars” on October 12\n\nThe Boys & Girls Club of Laguna Beach’s 9th Annual Night Under the Stars event will take place on Saturday, Oct. 12 at 6 p.m. at The Lake Forest Community Center. This premier fundraising event is dedicated to supporting young people in the Saddleback Valley area. Guests will enjoy a delightful evening featuring a delicious dinner, wine and craft beer tastings, a silent auction and dancing the night away. This event is a must-attend, and the community is encouraged to join in supporting this incredible cause.\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nCourtesy of BGCLB\n\nLast year’s “Night Under the Stars”\n\nOne hundred percent of the proceeds raised at this event will directly support programs in the Saddleback Valley area, ensuring that every dollar goes towards creating brighter futures for local youth.\n\nThe Saddleback Valley area faces a significant need for accessible, affordable and high-quality after-school care. These programs prioritize serving children and families who need them most, with a commitment to never turning away a child due to financial circumstances.\n\nMore than 10 years ago, the Lake Forest Kiwanis Club joined forces with the Boys & Girls Club of Laguna Beach to establish a program serving young people initially in Lake Forest and now throughout the Saddleback Valley area. This remarkable partnership is built on a foundation of shared values and dedication to the community.\n\nOver the years, the number of Saddleback Valley youth benefiting from these programs has grown significantly. Programs are currently being provided at two Oxford Preparatory Academy campuses – at La Paz and Los Alisos Intermediate Schools – and at the Mountain View Affordable Housing Community. This year alone, more than 1,500 Saddleback children have thrived through mentoring and enrichment programs. The community has an opportunity to be a part of providing brighter futures for these children.\n\nSupporters are encouraged to help provide young people with a Club experience that features outstanding youth development programs, dedicated mentors and opportunities to explore new horizons. Sponsoring the Night Under the Stars event or donating is a meaningful way to contribute. The mission to help young people succeed relies on the generosity of individuals, foundations and corporations committed to making a difference.\n\nSee the Sponsorship Opportunities page for ways to get involved.

The secret lies in how you paint the details and the magical power of suggestion.”\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nPhoto by Jeff Rovner\n\nRina Palumbo\n\nRina Palumbo, one of the founders of Third Street Writers, added her thoughts.\n\n“Flash writing is a small container for big concepts. No other form of writing can show narrative’s true power to illuminate joy, sorrow and everything in between,” Palumbo noted.\n\nWhether you want to create something from imagination or your life experience, this class will provide examples and guidance on forms and approaches to short-form writing.\n\n“We’re going to help you generate story ideas, then guide you through critique and revision, and finally, give you advice on publication opportunities,” Stone added.\n\nIt’s going to be awesome.\n\n“Keep It Short: Writing stories in flash format” will be offered as an eight-week series on Thursdays, Sept.12 through Oct. 31 from 9:30-11:30 a.m. for a fee of $160.

Here’s what Phil Sieger, who has volunteered for 15 years, said: “In 2008. I left my high stress job and started looking for ways to improve my health. I discovered the Laguna Coast Wilderness. Their five trailheads are all close to my home and within minutes of starting a hike you are in nature,” Sieger said. “The hikes and the people I met were so enjoyable I decided to become a volunteer.”\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nCourtesy of LCF\n\nHiking at Aliso Woods\n\nVolunteer Kathy Panzl pointed out that hiking the trails isn’t just good for the body, but the mind, too.\n\n“Joining the hikes in Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park has been a great way to learn more about plants and animals. I learn something new every hike. And the cyclical nature of the different wildflowers is a great way to build memory and keep the brain sharp,” she noted.\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nCourtesy of LCF\n\nDeer spotted at Dilley\n\nJohn Hambuch helps monitor the wildlife cameras in the park.\n\n“Working on the Wildlife Camera project can be especially fun and rewarding,” Hambuch said. “I am frequently surprised by how much these areas are shared with wildlife both at night and during the day – often within minutes of hikers on the same trail. Lately we have been delighted to find pictures of deer in locations where we haven’t seen them in years.”\n\nFor more information, and to sign up for the presentation, register here or visit www.thesusiq.org and click on classes and registration.

Over the course of this event, these artists share something quite magical with our community. They follow in the footsteps of those chasing light and color since the early 19th century. This year as LPAPA celebrates the artists’ return for the 26th Invitational, they are asking the community to also embrace the storied tradition of welcoming accomplished artists.\n\nClick on photo for a larger image\n\nPhotos courtesy of LPAPA\n\n“Lunar Laguna” – 2023 Jean Stern Distinctive Merit Legacy Award – Mark Fehlman\n\nThis year, LPAPA is inviting 30 professional artists from across the United States along with their original Founding Members.
