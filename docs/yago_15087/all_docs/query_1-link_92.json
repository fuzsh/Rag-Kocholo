Austin, Hinderaker, and Hackett grew into one of the largest law firms in Eastern South Dakota. Irving practiced law for more than 50 years. He finally retired at age 80.\n\nIrving earned many accolades as a lawyer: he was a member of the South Dakota State Board of Bar Commissioners, the Chairman of the Real Property, Probate and Trust Law Section of the South Dakota State Bar, a Fellow of the American Bar Foundation and of the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel, and was repeatedly listed in Best Lawyers In America. But his clients valued him most for his wise counsel and integrity. For more than 50 years,\n\nIrving devoted himself to the well-being of his community. Among many other contributions, he was a member of the Board of Directors of Memorial Hospital, a Member of the South Dakota Commission on Higher Education Facilities, a President of the Watertown Area Chamber of Commerce, Chairman of the Board of the Watertown Community Foundation, an original member of the South Dakota Board of Economic Development, a member of the Board of Directors of the Lake Area Technical Institute Foundation, and a member of the Board of Directors of the South Dakota Community Foundation.

He felt a deep affinity for his alma mater, Augustana, where he served for many years as a member of the Board of Regents and as a Charter Member of the Fellows of Augustana College.\n\nChurch activities were even closer to Irving’s heart than civic organizations. His family and friends knew him as a man of deep and always tolerant faith. He was the first President of Lutheran Church of Our Redeemer in Watertown. He was active at the national and international levels of the American Lutheran Church, as a member of the Executive Committee of the South Dakota District of the ALC, a member of the Commission on Evangelism of the ALC, a member of the ALC Foundation Standing Committee, and a member of the committee that advised Lutheran World Ministries on two International Human Rights Covenants proposed by the U.S. Department of State.

In recognition of his civic contributions, Irving Hinderaker became a member of the Watertown Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nIrving was preceded in death by his wife Eula and daughter-in-law Carol. He is survived by his four sons, Paul, John (Loree), James (Susan), Eric (Carrie), nine grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren. All mourn his passing. To his family, he will always be remembered, not just for his life of service, but for his nurturing love, good humor, and integrity."
