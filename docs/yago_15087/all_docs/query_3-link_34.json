        "text": "Funeral Mass:\n\nSaturday\n\nDecember 2, 2023\n\n10 AM\n\nPlease Enter at the cathedral entrance located on 5th Ave Between E50th and E51st St\n\nand proceed to the Main Altar\n\nAfter the funeral Mass a reception will be held at\n\nCopinette\n\nat address\n\n891 1st Ave New York, NY 10022\n\nOdette Warder (1981-2023), actress, model and recovery advocate\n\nOdette Warder, 42, entered into God’s throne room on Sunday November 12, 2023. Odette, the most devoted and loving wife is survived by her husband Jean-Pierre; mother Odette; brother Barry; sisters Mandy, Samantha and Tanya; and her faithful dog Ash.\n\nOdette grew up on the South Africa's subtropical coast of KwaZulu-Natal. She was of Italian/Sicilian-\n\nDutch and English descent. Fluent in both English and Afrikaans.\n\nOdette's life was a fascinating one, a clear demonstration of strength and perseverance. She has\n\novercome many challenges throughout her life. The coma she was in at the age of 16 was the one\n\nwith the most lasting influence on her life. Odette was left handicapped and unable to speak when\n\nshe awoke. She started a long and strenuous recovery program of almost nineteen months. Many\n\ndoctors and people from around the world were stunned by her miraculous recovery.\n\nOdette wrote Poison Rose, an inspirational book of her key challenges in her life that she overcame\n\nwith the help and guidance of Almighty God. Her simple message “Each one of us experience our\n\nown personal struggles in our everyday life in one way, or the other. It is about your attitude towards\n\ncircumstances that matter the most. Remaining positive and making the best of what you have at\n\nthis present moment. No matter how great the situation is. How serious the medical problem is, or\n\nhow negative the medical facts are. Remember that miracles do happen and sometimes these\n\nmiracles are not quite understood by man.”\n\nOdette was creative and talented in many areas. Even the camera caught her eye, she developed a\n\nzeal for the camera growing up in South Africa with over 28 years modeling experience in United\n\nStates of America, England, New Zealand, and South Africa.\n\nThe TV & Film Industry approached her in 2009 and since been cast on various large budget and\n\nindependent projects. Odette also loved working behind the camera in film production, creating a\n\nmasterpiece…\n\nOdette was a Teetotaler and advocate for millions of people battling and recovering from alcohol\n\naddiction. She helped, motivated, and supported people in Recovery and was a pillar of hope,\n\nsupport, and encouragement for those battling addiction.\n\nOdette lived by the maxim \"Live as if you would die tomorrow; believe as if you were to live forever.\"\n\nHer energy and spirit will live on in us, and we will forever be grateful for her presence in our lives.\n\nOdette made the world a better place for her having been here.\n\nWhat did Odette teach us? That it's important forgive quickly and be kind, to others and ourselves;\n\nknow that we are all doing the best that we can. Cultivate gratitude; try to be of service and\n\ngenerous. Know that your death is real and coming at blinding speed, so stop struggling to hold onto\n\nthe intrinsically ephemeral and let go, relax, and remember to enjoy today.\n\nOdette will never be forgotten and she leaves behind a bunch of family and friends who are better off\n\nbecause of her influence."
