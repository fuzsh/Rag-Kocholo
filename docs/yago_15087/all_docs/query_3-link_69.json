        "text": "in advance of any former treatise and contained many curious particulars concerning the habits of bees as well as practical instructions for their management, went through nine editions, the last of which appeared in 1765 (London, 8vo). It remained the standard work on the subject until it was superseded by John Thorley's ‘Mελισσηλογία, or the Female Monarchy’ (London, 1744, 8vo). A portrait of Warder, engraved by Henry Hulsberg, was prefixed to his book on bees.\n\n[Warder's True Amazons; Noble's Continuation of Granger's Biogr. Hist. ii. 313; Mills's Full Answer to Mr. Pellonière's reply to Dr. Snape, 1718; A Vindication of Joseph Warder and Charles Bowen from Mr. Mills's Calumnies, 1718. These two pamphlets, which contain some personal particulars, were the products of a petty local squabble in which Warder was involved.]\n\nWARDLAW, ELIZABETH, Lady (1677–1727), the supposed authoress of the ballad of ‘Hardyknute,’ was the second daughter of Sir Charles Halket, bart., of Pitfirrane, Fifeshire. She was born in April 1677, and on 13 June 1696 she married Sir Henry Wardlaw, bart., of Pitcruivie. The ballad of ‘Hardyknute,’ which she was the first to make known to the world, was at first circulated by her as the fragment of an ancient ballad discovered in a vault in Dunfermline. But no original manuscript of this fragment is forthcoming; and while the ballad is manifestly in great part modern, several of her friends, professing to be intimately acquainted with the circumstances of its production, positively ascribe to her its authorship. It was nevertheless published in 1719, during her lifetime, as an ancient poem, at the expense of Lord-president Forbes and Sir Gilbert Eliot, and in 1724 Allan Ramsay included it as an ancient ballad in his ‘Evergreen.’ Lady Wardlaw is stated to have remodelled the ballad of ‘Gilderoy;’ and the ballad of ‘Sir Patrick Spens,’ published in Percy's ‘Reliques’ from two manuscripts sent from Scotland, has also been ascribed to her. This last hypothesis was first suggested by Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe [q. v.] in additional notes to Johnson's ‘Musical Museum,’ and the proposition was also supported, as regards other ballads, by Robert Chambers in his ‘Remarks on Scottish Ballads,’ 1859. A feasible reason for suggesting Lady Wardlaw as the writer of ‘Sir Patrick Spens’ is the reference to the king in Dunfermline; but it is so immensely superior to ‘Hardyknute’ that Lady Wardlaw's authorship of this last is rather presumptive evidence against than for her authorship of ‘Sir Patrick Spens.’ It is, however, by no means improbable that Lady Wardlaw amended ‘Sir Patrick Spens’ and other ballads.\n\n[Percy's Reliques; Johnson's Musical Museum, ed. Laing; Chambers's Remarks on Scottish Ballads; Professor Child's Ballads; Anderson's Scottish Nation.]\n\nWARDLAW, HENRY (d. 1440), bishop of St. Andrews and founder of the university in that city, was descended from an ancient Saxon family which came to Scotland with Edgar Atheling, and was hospitably received by Malcolm Canmore. His grandfather, Sir H. Wardlaw of Torry, Fifeshire, married a niece of Walter, the high steward, and had by her Andrew, his successor, and Walter Wardlaw [q. v.], the cardinal. Sir Andrew married the daughter and heiress of James de Valoniis, and had Walter and Henry, the bishop. In 1378 Cardinal Wardlaw petitioned the pope for a canonry of Glasgow with expectation of a prebend for his nephew, who must have been then a mere boy, as he lived for sixty-two years afterwards. He was educated at the universities of Oxford and of Paris. In the book of the procurators of the English nation in the latter university his name appears among the ‘determinantes’ of 1383. In a petition to the pope of 1388 he is described as ‘a licentiate in arts who has studied civil law for two years at Orleans.’ He afterwards studied the canon law, and took the degree of doctor. During the papal schism Scotland was on the side of the anti-popes, and, through the favour of Clement VII and Benedict XIII (Peter de Luna), Wardlaw held simultaneously canonries and prebends in Glasgow, Moray, and Aberdeen, the precentorships of Glasgow and Moray, and the church of Cavers. Having been sent on a mission to the papal court at Avignon, he remained there several years. During his stay the see of St. Andrews fell vacant, and he received the appointment from Benedict, and was consecrated by him in 1403. On his return to Scotland Robert III sent his son, the Earl of Carrick (afterwards James I), to the castle of St. Andrews, and placed him under the bishop's care and tuition. While there the youthful prince imbibed those literary tastes which afforded him so much solace during his long imprisonment in England.\n\nThe restoration of the cathedral of St. Andrews, after its partial destruction by fire, which had been begun by one of his predecessors, was completed by Wardlaw, and he greatly improved the interior and enriched it with encaustic tiles and stained-glass"
