“You’re in love with me?”

Back in the early 2000s, Natalie Buchanan ran away from Cristian Vega, who, at the time, was in a relationship with Jen Rappaport. Cris confronted Natalie, wondering why she was so upset. Not able to keep her feelings bottled up inside any longer, Natalie blurted out that she was in love with Cris. She was stunned to learn that Cris felt the same way, and the two went on to marry in 2003 and made many memories in Llanview – good and bad.
