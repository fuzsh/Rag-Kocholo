        "text": "Annette A. (Strong) Buchanan age 63, of Windsor (previously Deposit NY) passed from this earth on July 12th, 2021 at Wilson Regional Medical Center while holding her husband's hand. Annette was born to Leo (1917-1999) and Velma (Meyer) Strong (1921-1996) on May 8th 1958. She is a 1975 graduate of Deposit Central High School. Loving Wife, Mother, Grandmother, Great-grandmother, and Friend. She is survived in this life, by her husband of Todd C Buchanan whom they recently celebrated 35 years of marriage this past February of 2021. She spent many years raising 3 kids that miss her indescribably , daughters Darla Mason of Binghamton NY, Jessica (Lucas) Vandermark of Harpursville NY , and Dustin (Amy) Buchanan of Windsor NY. Many grandchildren that filled her heart: Brian Brown of Whitney Point NY , Donovan (Cheyenne) Brown Conklin NY, Brayden, Caleb, Owen, and Kaitlin Vandermark of Harpursville NY. Connor, Ellie, and Harley Buchanan of Windsor NY, Natalie Buchanan of Elmira NY, great grandchildren: Sofia and Grayson Brown of Conklin NY, Sister Darlene (Mike) Weidman of Conklin NY and Nephew, Michael (D’Anna) Weidman of Waco TX. As well as a very large extended family of aunts , uncles, and cousins .We would like to recognize her two dearest friends Deborah Neu and Penny (Gert) Rambus of Deposit.\n\nTo all that knew Annette she touched your soul in some way , rather that be a fond memory ,catch phrase, recipe, or just a lending ear. There will never be words to express how amazing she was and continues to be. She had a wonderful talent of drawing and painting that were passed on to her children and grandchildren without pause. Annette worked very diligently to obtain her certification as a Veterinary Technician to which she accomplished with such pride. . Annette was a simple woman, whom never asked for very much out life. Our hearts are broken and a large piece will forever be missing. Services will be at the convenience of the family. In lieu of flowers please send donations to the Animal Care Council of Broome County.\n\nI'm Still Here:\n\nI may be gone but please don't cry\n\nDeath is not the last goodbye\n\nDeath releases me of my pain\n\nHere will come a day we will meet again\n\nDon't be blue and don't be sad\n\nThink back to the times we had\n\nI am always here I hear you speak\n\nIn time of trouble it's me you seek\n\nYou don't see me but I see you\n\nI will do my best to pull you through\n\nSpeak to me and I will hear\n\nNever far I am always near\n\nBe brave my love do not cry\n\nSee you again it’s not goodbye"
