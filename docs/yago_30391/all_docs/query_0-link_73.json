        "text": "Friday, August 26, 2005\n\nJohn sat on the floor in his closet gazing at Cristian Vega’s file, and flashed back to the deal the two made months ago. Michael dropped by and reminded John that Cristian and Caitlin were dead and he and Natalie should move on. And if John believes that Natalie is still hung up on Cristian they should talk about it. Of course, John KNOWS CRISTIAN is not dead and that’s the problem.\n\nNatalie limped into the foyer and, SURPRISE, her entire family was there to welcome her home. For a brief moment, it appeared that Natalie was scanning the room for John (he wasn’t there, see above) but she did seem genuinely happy to be welcomed home. After a toast from Kevin, and some Buchanan versus Balsom rivalry, Viki commented to Kevin that Jessica had left a message on her machine and that was odd. She even had a few moments with Rex, who seemed somewhat ornery since Duke had told him to stay away from Adriana. He was a little snarky with Renee, and then, when he got Natalie alone, he immediately jumped on the “stay away from John” bandwagon. Kelly overhead Rex’s anti-love “love can kill you Natty” thoughts and immediately told Natalie about her personal journey back to love and urged her to follow her heart. Natalie took Kelly’s advice and followed her heart all the way to John’s apartment.\n\nBlair caught Bo up to speed on the Margaret/Todd situation and Asa’s involvement. Bo tried to calm Blair down and summoned Asa to the precinct. When Asa showed up he barked, “Whatever it is I didn’t do it,” and swore on Renee’s life he had no idea where Margaret was.\n\nTodd burst into Margaret’s doctor’s office only to hear a car speed away. He did see the sonogram and the nurse didn’t waste any time in tellling him it was his baby. She then went on about children being the only thing that’s important. Todd saw where she was going and decided to play nice and hinted that he wanted to convince the mother of his baby to reconcile. Unfortunately the nurse had no idea where Margaret was. Margaret, though, in her hurry, had dropped the keys to her motel room on the floor and that was all the info Todd needed. Margaret was in her room getting ready to pack up and she assumed Todd would be finding her soon.\n\nLayla and Evangeline continued their sisterly bonding (see yesterday’s episode). Evangeline made it clear that she wasn’t interested in what Layla might think was up with John. Layla humiliated Evangeline by suggesting to the assistant DA that he ask Evangeline to dance."
