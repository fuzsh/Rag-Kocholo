        "text": "Disclaimer: I own nothing; all OLTL characters are trademarks of their respective creators and ABC Daytime. The wonderful song is by Nickelback!\n\nFandom: One Life to Live\n\nCharacters: Natalie Vega, John McBain\n\nWord Count: 1, 959\n\nRating: PG at most\n\nSummary: John goes all out for Valentine's Day...\n\nAuthor’s Notes: I hate Valentine’s Day because I’m single and well it’s just a bitter reminder of that fact. But I decided in the end (or rather the muse decided for me) that Jolie was worth it.\n\nTitle: ( Far AwayCollapse )\n\nDisclaimer: I own nothing, don't sue.\n\nFandom: One Life to Live\n\nWord Count: 4, 192\n\nRating: NC-17\n\nSummary: Natalie makes a stupid mistake; can she and John get past it?\n\nAuthor’s Notes: There is nothing more fun than to hear Natalie’s voice in your head saying the last line of this chapter, and then get to create a story around it!\n\nTitle: Bad Decisions\n\n( Part OneCollapse )\n\n( Part TwoCollapse )\n\n( Part Three--NC17Collapse )\n\n( Part FourCollapse )\n\nOkay, so I really need to start updating this more often. These three were written/finished over the past two days... The first two are majorly angsty!\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nI own nothing, don’t sue. The song is the most beautiful country song ever IMO and can be found on Brad Paisley’s \"Waste My Time\" CD.\n\nFandom: One Life to Live\n\nCharacter(s): John McBain, heavy with Jolie flashbacks\n\nAuthor’s Notes: This is heavy on Jolie because although Hackley may have refused to show them John and Nat had to have some majorly cute exchanges off-screen right?\n\nWord Count: 1, 638\n\nTitle: Rainin’ You\n\n( Rainin' YouCollapse )</p>\n\nDisclaimer: I own nothing, don't sue.\n\nFandom: One Life to Live\n\nCharacters: John McBain, Natalie Vega, Roxanne Balsom, with other characters mentioned.\n\nAuthor's Notes: I started this the other night feeling exhausted and quite depressed... Finished it tonight thanks to Ashley's urging and the muse's cooperativeness. (Also I'm sure the numerous reviews for my other fics worked wonders )\n\nWARNINGS: ANGST. MAJOR angst.\n\nTitle: Bitter Ends\n\n( Bitter EndsCollapse )\n\nAnd now an uber-sweet one-shot to make up for the depressing ones...\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nI own nothing, don’t sue.\n\nFandom: One Life to Live\n\nCharacters: John McBain and Natalie Vega\n\nSpoilers/Timeline: A few months after the prison riot.\n\nChanges to Storyline: Evangeline did not tell Natalie, John did when he got out of the prison.\n\nAuthor’s Notes:\n\nI very seriously doubted I could do the dress justice with my description, here is a picture of it http://www.chinasilkroadonline.com/Files/UpFiles/womens_Silk_clothing/silk_dress/silk_dress_06.jpg\n\nSummary: John proves his love…\n\nTitle: You Shouldn’t Kiss Me Like This\n\n( You Shouldn't Kiss Me Like ThisCollapse )</p>\n\nReviews are very welcome, as they feed the muse--who is currently hard at work on the next chapter of \"Unforgiven.\" *wink wink*\n\n~~Manda\n\n</font>"
