        "text": "quote:\n\nOriginally posted by lynm:\n\nI really believe that Spencer is the one that actually killed Margaret because he wants Blair.\n\nlynm\n\nHmm interesting i never really thought of that. I am still not sure of what will happen next, but one of my guesses is that Tess is probably going to come out of Jessica, but who knows these soaps always leave you wondering until the next episode. Luckily its only a day wait until the next episode. If it was a week i would probably go crazy. I am just curious to see how Blair reacts when she finds out that Tod really did kill Margaret. I am also really anxious to see what happens with Christian Vega. I just hope that he makes it out of jail in one piece.\n\nLol . . . I need to check this thread more often! I like the way they have wove Dr. Spencer into the whole Margaret mess. I wonder how gun-ho Hugh Hughes will be to prosecute a \"baby killer\" if Dr. Spencer turns out to be his father.\n\nAnd what do you think the odds are that Jessica may be lost forever, and Llanview will end up with Tess?\n\nHillary B. Smith (Nora) only renewed her contract for 1 year. Do you think that spells the end for our DA in the coma? What if we find out that her divorce with Colson was never finalized and he comes along trying to \"pull the plug?\"\n\nI don't usually get too worked up over the romances on the show (seeing how they come and go so quickly), but I was actually holding my breath hoping Natalie would forgive Christian. Of course, its never that easy, but the writers could surprise us once (only then I would complain that they \"rushed\" the story). .\n\nAnd finally, Speaking of couples, don't y'all think Dorian and Clint make a better couple then Viki and Clint? <evil grin>\n\nquote:\n\nOriginally posted by pcolaspike:\n\nLol . . .

Or maybe Rex was not Roxanne's natural son either-- maybe he will get Bo as a step-father as they have been developing that relationship. I think Hugh would recuss himself from the case. Hopefully, Nora will have a miraculous recovery and be the one to prosecute Spencer and set Todd loose. (As I have experienced this in real life), I think it would be great for her to wake up and rejoin the living.\n\nI agree, I wish Natalie would forgive Christian and try to work out their relationship; but it would not make for an intriguing show if she did it without a lot of heart ache for everyone along the way. But I do think, they will reunite.\n\nBut I suppose I am just a romantic at heart: I would like for Marcie and Michael to get back together; Kevin and Kelly; John and Evangeline; Christian and Natalie; Antonio and Jessica; I want Rex to be with Adriana though. I think they make a better couple--they are always so comfortable with each other unless Adiana is deliberately pushing him away--and then I think \"though protests too much!\"\n\nClint with Dorian? hmmmm....He was a dog when he was with Carlotta--starting seeing someone behind her back didn't he? He tolerated a lot of Vicki/Nikki crap-- maybe he and Dorian deserve each other and can team up against Spencer to give him a badly needed lesson in life!\n\nHere is a thought: What if Spencer is Asa's or Clint's son and that is what his beef is with the Buchanans? Cordero showed up out of the blue as an unknown offspring to Clint many years ago. Asa had paid off the girl Clint had impregnated in his youth. Maybe this is the result of another \"sewing of the wild oates\". All I recall about Spencer and David is that they share a Mother and their father(s) was not in the picture. That would make both Spencer and (Rex? or Hugh?) Buchanan's!\n\nDon, glad you could grace this topic again.\n\nlynm"
