Recent studies in selected cancer types have suggested that chromothripsis may be more common than initially inferred from low-resolution copy-number data. Here, as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we analyze patterns of chromothripsis across 2,658 tumors from 38 cancer types using whole-genome sequencing data. We find that chromothripsis events are pervasive across cancers, with a frequency of more than 50% in several cancer types. Whereas canonical chromothripsis profiles display oscillations between two copy-number states, a considerable fraction of events involve multiple chromosomes and additional structural alterations. In addition to non-homologous end joining, we detect signatures of replication-associated processes and templated insertions. Chromothripsis contributes to oncogene amplification and to inactivation of genes such as mismatch-repair-related genes. These findings show that chromothripsis is a major process that drives genome evolution in human cancer. Analysis of whole-genome sequencing data across 2,658 tumors spanning 38 cancer types shows that chromothripsis is pervasive, with a frequency of more than 50% in several cancer types, contributing to oncogene amplification, gene inactivation and cancer genome evolution.",

        "text": "Prevalence of chromothripsis across cancer types\n\nWe first sought to formulate a set of criteria for identifying chromothripsis events with varying complexities (Fig. 1a). The acknowledged model of chromothripsis posits that some of the DNA fragments generated by the shattering of the DNA are lost; thus, CN oscillations between two or three states1,6 are an obvious first criterion (Fig. 1a). Such deletions also lead to interspersed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or altered haplotype ratios if there is only a single copy of the parental homolog of the fragmented chromatid. Although chromosome shattering and reassembly has been experimentally demonstrated to generate chromothripsis2, template-switching DNA-replication errors can generate a similar pattern21. Indeed, shattering and replication error models are not mutually exclusive and could co-occur2. Therefore, for the discussion below we will refer generally to ‘chromothripsis’ as encompassing both classes of models.\n\nTo detect chromothripsis in WGS data, we developed ShatterSeek (Methods and Supplementary Note). A key feature of our method is to identify clusters of breakpoints belonging to SVs that are interleaved—that is, the regions bridged by their breakpoints overlap instead of being nested (Fig. 1)—as is expected from random joining of genomic fragments. This encompasses the many cases that do not display simple oscillations (for example, partially oscillating CN profiles with interspersed amplifications) and oscillations that span multiple CN levels due to aneuploidy5,22. Rearrangements in chromothripsis should also follow a roughly even distribution for the different types of fragment joins (duplication-like, deletion-like, head-to-head and tail-to-tail inversions, which are shown in blue, orange, black and green, respectively, in Fig. 1a and throughout) and have breakpoints that are randomly distributed across the affected region1,2,3. Finally, we use interchromosomal SVs to identify chromothripsis events that involve multiple chromosomes. In the Supplementary Note, we have compiled the criteria that have been used in 27 major chromothripsis-related studies to date.\n\nAfter removing low-quality samples using stringent quality control, we applied ShatterSeek to 2,543 tumor–normal pairs of 37 cancer types (Methods and Supplementary Table 1). Of those 2,543 pairs, 2,428 cases had SVs and were analyzed further. To tune the parameters in our method, we used statistical thresholds and visual inspection. For the minimum number of oscillating CN segments, we used two thresholds: high-confidence calls display oscillations between two states in at least seven adjacent segments, whereas low-confidence calls involve between four and six segments (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Note). The analyses described in the subsequent sections were performed using the high-confidence call set unless noted otherwise.\n\nWe first focused on the 1,427 nearly diploid genomes (ploidy ≤ 2.1; Supplementary Table 1), in which detection of chromothripsis is more straightforward. We defined as ‘canonical’ those events in which more than 60% of the CN segments in the affected region oscillated between two states (canonical events in polyploid tumors are described later). The frequency of canonical chromothripsis events is more than 40% for multiple cancer types, such as glioblastomas (50%) and lung adenocarcinomas (40%). These frequencies are much higher than previous estimates17,18.\n\nWhen we extend our analysis to the entire cohort, we identify high-confidence events in 29% of the samples (734 out of 2,543), affecting 3.2% of all chromosomes (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Dataset 1). When low-confidence calls are included, the percentages increase to 40% and 5.3%, respectively (Supplementary Dataset 2).\n\nThe frequency varies markedly across cancer types. At the high end, we find that 100% of liposarcomas and 77% of osteosarcomas exhibit high-confidence chromothripsis (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). Although a higher susceptibility of these cancer types to chromothripsis has been described1,22, our estimated frequencies are substantially higher. Melanomas, glioblastomas and lung adenocarcinomas showed evidence of chromothripsis in more than 50% of cases (Fig. 1c). By contrast, the frequencies were lowest in thyroid adenocarcinomas (3.3%, n = 30), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (1.2%, n = 86) and pilocytic astrocytomas (0%, n = 78); in the other tumor types with low incidence, the sample sizes were too small to give meaningful estimates. Consistent with previous reports23,24, we find that chromothripsis is enriched in chromosomes 3 and 5 in kidney renal cell carcinomas and chromosome 12 in liposarcomas (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Overall, these results indicate a much greater prevalence of chromothripsis in a majority of human cancers than previously estimated10,17,18.\n\nUnderstanding the difference between our frequency estimates and previous ones\n\nOur estimates are in accordance with recent analyses in specific tumor types5,7; however, they are considerably higher than those described in previous pan-cancer studies that used array-based platforms. With higher resolution from sequencing data, improved SV algorithms and refined criteria, we are able to provide more-accurate estimates.\n\nTo better understand the discrepancy between WGS-based studies, we carried out a detailed comparison using previously analyzed datasets. For 109 previously described prostate adenocarcinomas25, the authors used ShatterProof26 and found chromothripsis in 21% (23 out of 109). When we applied the same algorithm (with the same parameters) but using our CN and SV calls, the percentage more than doubled to 45% (49 out of 109). This indicates that the lower sensitivity of previous SV-detection methods is one of the main reasons for the discrepancy. Accurate SV detection remains challenging, especially for low-purity tumors. The SV calls that we used were generated by the PCAWG Structural Variation Working Group of the ICGC; each variant was required to be called by at least two of the four algorithms used in this analysis27.\n\nUsing ShatterSeek, we identified 11 additional cases for a total of 55% (60 out of 109). Of the 23 previously reported cases25, we missed four. The missed events are focal events comprising fewer than six SVs, which is the lowest number allowed in our criteria; the detected regions appear to be hypermutated regions characterized by tandem duplications or deletions. For the cases that we detect but that were missed previously25, visual inspection reveals that the differences are mostly due to the lower sensitivity of their SV calls (Supplementary Note). ShatterSeek has increased sensitivity by incorporating more complex patterns of oscillations and interchromosomal SVs while keeping the specificity high by imposing additional criteria on breakpoint homology to remove tandem duplications and those arising from breakage–fusion–bridge (BFB) cycles. Furthermore, we also compared our method against ChromAL5 for 76 pancreatic tumors. Both ChromAL and ShatterSeek detect chromothripsis in the same 41 tumors (54%).\n\nTherefore, our estimates for the frequency of chromothripsis events are supported by the following: some tumor types such as thyroid adenocarcinoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and pilocytic astrocytomas have few or no events; diploid tumors, which have simpler configurations that are easier to reconstruct or verify visually, have high frequencies; the high-confidence cases were used for final estimates; more sensitive CN and SV calls result in higher frequencies for the same datasets; our estimates are in agreement with very recent analysis in specific tumor types; and our chromothripsis calls do not overlap with regions affected by chromoplexy (Supplementary Note).\n\nFrequent involvement of interchromosomal SVs\n\nAn important feature of our approach is the incorporation of interchromosomal SVs to detect those events that involve multiple chromosomes. Chromothripsis affects only a single chromosome in 40% of the tumors with chromothripsis (Fig. 2a–c and Supplementary Figs. 1–3). A large number of chromosomes is frequently affected in some tumor types, for example, at least five chromosomes are affected in 61% osteosarcomas (Supplementary Figs. 1–4). In one extreme case, we found a single chromothripsis event that affected six chromosomes (Fig. 2b), with only seven of the 110 SVs on chromosome 5 being intrachromosomal. In another example (Supplementary Fig. 4d), an approximately 5-Mb region on chromosome 12 did not display CN oscillations, but it could be linked by interchromosomal SVs to another region that does show a clear chromothripsis pattern, suggesting that the amplification of CCND2 on chromosome 12 may have originated from chromothripsis. Chromothripsis involving multiple chromosomes is likely to have arisen either from simultaneous fragmentation of multiple chromosomes (for example, in a micronucleus or in a chromosome bridge) or from fragmentation of a chromosome that had previously undergone a non-reciprocal translocation.\n\nSize and complexity of chromothripsis events are highly variable\n\nChromothripsis events span a wide range of genomic scale, with the number of breakpoints involved varying by two orders of magnitude within some tumor types (Supplementary Fig. 1c). We found that tumors had relatively focal chromothripsis events—usually a few megabases in size—that took place within an otherwise quiet genome (bottom-right quadrant in Fig. 2d). Although focal, these events can lead to the simultaneous amplification of multiple oncogenes located in different chromosomes (Supplementary Figs. 4c–e, 5a–c). Other focal events co-localize with other complex events in highly rearranged genomes (bottom-left quadrant in Fig. 2d). Overall, our analysis reveals that there is greater heterogeneity in chromothripsis patterns than previously appreciated, both in terms of the number of SVs and chromosomes involved.\n\nRelationship between chromothripsis and aneuploidy\n\nNewly established polyploid cells have high rates of mitotic errors that generate lagging chromosomes28,29, which have been linked to chromothripsis in medulloblastomas and in vitro2,12,14. However, a causal relationship or even the frequency of association between polyploidy and chromothripsis has not been assessed in detail. To examine the sequence of events clearly, we focused on the canonical cases, for which we can infer whether chromothripsis occurred before or after polyploidization30. For example, if the CN oscillates between two and four copies in a tetraploid tumor, we infer that polyploidization occurred after chromothripsis; on the other hand, if the oscillation occurs between three and four copies, we infer that polyploidization occurred first30 (Supplementary Figs. 1, 2, 5d, 6 and Supplementary Note). Of the 194 cases in which we can distinguish the sequence of events, 74% show chromothripsis after polyploidization. This suggests that a large fraction of the canonical chromothripsis events in polyploid tumors are late events.\n\nWe observed canonical chromothripsis events in 26% of diploid-ranged tumors (431 out of 1,648) and in 40% of polyploid-ranged tumors (298 out of 748). After correcting for tumor type using the logistic regression, we estimate that, on average, the odds of chromothripsis occurring in a polyploid tumor (cases with ploidy ≥ 2.5) is 1.5 times larger than that in a diploid tumor (95% confidence interval, 1.20–1.85; P < 10−3). This increase may be due to the presence of more genomic material in polyploids, although polyploidy also reduces the sensitivity of CN and SV detection (due to a lower sequence coverage per copy) and makes it easier for the cell to lose the highly rearranged copy when intact copies are present31.\n\nFrequent co-localization of chromothripsis with other complex events\n\nAbout half of the chromothripsis events co-localize with other genomic alterations (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figs. 1, 2). There is evidence across multiple tumor types that chromothripsis might occur before or after additional layers of rearrangements6,7,8,13,14,23. For instance, BFB cycles have been mechanistically linked to chromothripsis and telomere attrition—which results in the formation of BFB cycles, has been identified as a predisposing factor for chromothripsis6,13,32.\n\nCo-localization of APOBEC-mediated clustered hypermutation (kataegis) and rearrangements has been reported for multiple cancer types33,34, and has been linked to single-stranded DNA intermediates during break-induced replication35. To study the relationship between kataegis and chromothripsis, we examined the presence of clusters of APOBEC-induced mutations within the chromothripsis regions (Methods). Excluding melanoma samples (due to the overlap between the APOBEC and ultraviolet-light signatures36), we find that 28% of the 734 tumors with chromothripsis show at least five clustered APOBEC-induced mutations, and 9.3% display kataegis comprising more than 20 mutations. Previous analysis of liposarcomas has suggested that multiple BFB cycles on a derivative chromosome generated by chromothripsis underlie the formation of neochromosomes23. In agreement with this model, we observe variant allele fractions of 0.01–0.1 for APOBEC-induced mutations in chromothripsis regions that have high-level CN amplifications in soft-tissue liposarcomas, suggesting that they occurred at the late stages of tumor development, likely after chromothripsis (Supplementary Fig. 4e). Overall, although kataegis can co-occur with chromothripsis, this co-occurrence is not common. This is consistent with recent data that chromothriptic derivative chromosomes are mostly assembled by end-joining mechanisms that do not involve extensive DNA-end resection37.\n\nTP53 mutation status and chromothripsis\n\nInactivating TP53 mutations have been associated with chromothripsis in medulloblastomas8 and in pediatric cancers38,39, and TP53-deficient cells have been used as a model to generate chromothripsis in vitro2,14. Nevertheless, the relationship between deleterious TP53 mutations and chromothripsis has not been examined comprehensively. In our data, 38% of the samples with inactivating TP53 mutations show chromothripsis, whereas 24% of those with wild-type TP53 have chromothripsis (Fig. 2e). After correcting for cancer type, this translates to an odds ratio of 1.54 (95% confidence interval, 1.21–1.95, P < 10−3) for chromothripsis in those with TP53 mutations compared with TP53 wild-type cancers. However, we note that 60% of the chromothripsis cases show neither TP53 mutations nor MDM2 amplifications (a regulator of TP53 by ubiquitination40), including those with massive cases of chromothripsis in diploid genomes (for example, DO25622 in Fig. 2b). This indicates that, although p53 malfunction and polyploidy are predisposing factors for chromothripsis, it still occurs frequently in diploid tumors with proficient p53.\n\nSignatures of repair mechanisms in chromothripsis regions\n\nAlthough imprecise, it is possible to infer the predominant mechanisms responsible for the chromothripsis event based on the sequence homology at the breakpoints41,42. Previously, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) has been implicated in the reassembly of DNA fragments generated by chromothripsis2,37, whereas alternative end joining (alt-EJ) has been proposed in constitutional chromothripsis and in glioblastomas15,43. In addition, short templated insertions suggestive of microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR) or alt-EJ associated with polymerase theta have been detected in chromothripsis events that originated from DNA fragmentation in micronuclei2,44,45,46.\n\nWe analyzed the breakpoints involved in canonical chromothripsis events with interspersed LOH, as most SVs in such cases are related to chromothripsis (Fig. 1b). In 55% of these events, we only detected repair signatures that were concordant with NHEJ or alt-EJ (Supplementary Fig. 7). In 32%, we identified stretches of microhomology at two or more breakpoint junctions (mostly comprising 0–6 bp) and short insertions of 10–500 bp that map to distant locations within the affected region (Supplementary Fig. 7). For example, in the massive chromothripsis in Fig. 2a (1,394 SVs, hundreds of uninterrupted CN oscillations and interspersed LOH), we detect small nonrandom insertions of 10–379 bp at 60 breakpoints. Thus, NHEJ has a principal role in DNA repair, with partial contributions from MMBIR or alt-EJ.\n\nBy contrast, approximately 5% of the canonical events detected in diploid genomes show no evidence of LOH in part of the affected region or in the entire affected region, for example, oscillations between two and three CN, long stretches of microhomology and frequent evidence of template switching27 (Figs. 3, 4). For instance, in the case shown in Fig. 3b, both the size of the segments at CN 3 (mean of 45 kb) and the orientation of the breakpoints at their edges suggest that these are templated insertions27. In addition, multiple breakpoint junctions show features concordant with MMBIR. In this case, we could manually reconstruct part of the amplicon by following the polymerase trajectory across 42 template-switching events (Fig. 3c–f). This type of event might be more appropriately called chromoanasynthesis21, but systematically distinguishing chromoanasynthesis from chromothripsis is challenging due to their partially overlapping features (template switching events can generate LOH if the polymerase skips over segments of the template and LOH might not be present in chromothripsis events that occur in aneuploid genomes; Supplementary Note).\n\nWe also find features associated with replication-associated mechanisms in more-complex rearrangements involving multiple chromosomes. In an illustrative case (Fig. 4a), LOH is observed in some chromosomes (Fig. 4b) but absent in others, where the oscillations occur at higher CN states without LOH (Fig. 4c,d). There is evidence of templated insertions in chromosomes 5 and 13, which are linked to a chromothripsis event showing LOH in chromosome 1. Notably, the minor CN for the templated insertions in chromosome 13 is 1, whereas it is 0 for the rest of the chromosome. This suggests that one parental chromosome served as a template and was later lost.\n\nOverall, these results indicate the involvement of template-switching events in the generation or repair of complex rearrangements, consistent with the observations of replication-associated processes in the formation of clustered rearrangements in congenital disorders and cancer15,21,27,41,47. Although further experimental evidence will be necessary, we suggest that the involvement of replication-associated mechanisms in the assembly of derivative chromosomes in chromothripsis might be substantial.\n\nOncogene amplification and loss of tumor-suppressor genes in chromothripsis regions\n\nEvidence of oncogene amplification in extrachromosomal circular DNA elements, termed double-minutes, generated as a consequence of chromothripsis has been reported for selected cancer types1,2,8,43. However, the extent to which chromothripsis contributes to double-minute formation has not been examined on a pan-cancer scale. Although reconstruction of a double-minute structure with discordant reads would present clear evidence for its extrachromosomal nature, this proves to be too difficult in general. Therefore, we rely on CN to make our inferences. We find that 15 patients (2% of tumors with chromothripsis) show CN oscillations between one low (CN ≤ 4) and one very high (CN ≥ 10) state, consistent with the presence of a double minute8,43. We detect known cancer drivers in these putative double minutes, including MDM2 (four samples; Supplementary Figs. 4e, 5a and Supplementary Table 2) and CDK4 (four samples). These amplifications lead to increased mRNA levels of, for example, MDM2, NUP107 and CDK4 in a glioblastoma sample (DO14049) compared to other glioblastoma tumors. In chromothripsis regions subject to additional rearrangements, it is difficult to discern, using bulk-sequencing data, whether highly amplified segments are part of double minutes or correspond to intrachromosomal amplification48. Furthermore, once a double minute has formed, the derivative chromosome showing chromothripsis may be lost if it has no other tumor-promoting mutations. Therefore, the contribution of chromothripsis to the formation of extrachromosomal DNA bodies is likely to be higher than estimated here.\n\nFurther analysis of focal amplifications, defined as regions with CN ≥ 4 and smaller than 6 Mb (ref. 49), in 1,268 tumors and 162 normal tissue samples with RNA-sequencing data reveals that 6,310 focal amplifications encompassing oncogenes (11.1%; or 20.5% when including low-confidence calls) localize to chromothripsis regions, often leading to increased expression (Supplementary Table 2). These include well-known cancer-associated genes, such as CCND1 (25 tumors), CDK4 (25 tumors), MDM2 (23 tumors), SETDB1 (23 tumors), ERBB3 (11 tumors), ERBB2 (11 tumors), MYC (10 tumors) and MYCN (five tumors). Therefore, chromothripsis—perhaps together with associated replication-based CN gains22,50—may make a substantial contribution to small-scale focal amplifications."
