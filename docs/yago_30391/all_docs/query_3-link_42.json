Heat absorbed by refrigerant in the evaporator (refrigerant effect) and work done on the refrigerant by the compressor is exhausted to the outdoor environment by a condenser, typically a dry or wet heat exchange process. Work will design a magneto alternator (generator used in wind turbine). The rotating shaft is internal and eliminates the need for a feed-through using a mag coupling thereby improving the leak tightness while also minimizing frictional resistance because mechanical rotary seals are eliminated from the design. The magneto alternator has rotating neodymium rare-earth magnets with a three-phase stator, then a bridge rectifier to produce DC. The power is then either directly used, stored in batteries, or drives a mains inverter that can supply the grid for profit.

Simulations for curtain walls showed that thermal buffering could minimize heat losses in cold weather periods. A window attachment is therefore proposed that uses indoor conditioned air to block the loss of heat from a window during cold weather periods. Indoor conditioned air is preheated using waste heat from the condenser of the Hodges centrifugal chillers. Estimates of energy savings for the Hodges Library indicates a $37k per year savings reflecting a 3% drop in total power draw (operating plus demand charge).
