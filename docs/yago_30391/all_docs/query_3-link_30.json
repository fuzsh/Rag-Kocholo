The Joint Implementation Action Committee will host training sessions for the new Reserve Assignment System (RAS) and Electronic Communication System (ECS) via Zoom next week. These sessions will provide a detailed summary of each of these new systems, with questions taken live as able through the Zoom Q text-decoration: underline; background-color: transparent; transition: 0.2s; cursor: pointer; box-sizing: border-box;\"> townhall@alliedpilots.org . Click here to register for the RAS training from 1800 to 2000 Central on Aug. 27 . Click here to register for the ECS training from 1800 to 2000 Central on Aug. 28 . If your schedule permits, we strongly encourage you to make plans to join us for these training sessions. Because these training sessions will be visually oriented and include live demonstrations, we also encourage you to connect via a device with a screen that’s large enough for viewing a PowerPoint presentation and “drive-through” demonstrations of each system. For those unable to participate live, recordings will be uploaded to AlliedPilots.org/Videos . RAS and ECS to be Implemented on Aug. 31 This is a new message from the APA Contract Compliance Committee. The CBA’s Reserve Assignment System (RAS) and Electronic Communication System (ECS) will be implemented on Aug. 31. At launch, exactly two types of required messages will utilize ECS: Reassignments and RAS Awards and Assignments. While on duty, or upon the commencement of duty, pilots are responsible for these two types of ECS messages. During the On Duty pilot state, these messages will always be forwarded to your iPad via the ECS application. Many other forwarding options are also available. For additional information, please join the ECS training session scheduled for 1800 Central on Aug. 28 and review the ECS Implementation Communications on AA Pilots. Until full implementation of CBA Section 4.C – Recovery Obligation (RO), RO notifications will continue under Current Process . A phone call to a pilot’s listed H number is the contractual method of notification for RO. APA Contract Minute – Deadhead Pay This is a new message from the APA Contract Compliance Committee. CA Jason Saxer is back with a new APA Contract Minute . In this edition, he discusses Section 19.D, which governs pay for pilots deadheading on AA mainline flights as well as AA regional flights. Coming Soon to APA Pilot – Trips Marketplace This is a new message from the APA Information Technology Steering Committee. Trips Marketplace is the next major release in APA’s app lineup. It has been designed to streamline the pilot-to-pilot (P2P) trip-trading process while automating cumbersome FOS commands, making it easier for pilots to post and drop sequences to fellow pilots outside of TTS. APA IT is tentatively looking to make these features available as a beta version to all pilots next week. Pilots will be able to open their schedule in the Trips Marketplace through the APA Pilot app and quickly perform the following: Post or un-post sequences. Browse posted sequences. Conveniently text or call the pilot who posted a sequence. Ask a pilot to drop a sequence directly to you. Receive inbox alerts for requests and completed sequence drops to other pilots. Motivator entries. Note: Due to the inability to execute commands in FOS on a pilot’s behalf, the actual execution of dropping a sequence to another pilot must be executed in the app by the pilot who owns the posted sequence. Trips Marketplace streamlines the command to a one-button press and returns the FOS response. Successive updates over the next few weeks will include Shared Sequence, Last Live Leg, and Loaning Sequences Support. But first, the next feature to be released will be Shared Sequence Support, which includes: Advertise portions of a sequence you wish to share with other pilots. Quickly choose the portion of a sequence you wish to share. Select the pay and credit and, if applicable, the holiday pay if you want to keep it or share it. Finally, your continued feedback is desired. The IT Steering Committee has heard your requests for a more compact Trips sequence display, and this feature is in development. Please submit your ideas and suggestions via the Feedback option in the APA Pilot main menu. This email will go to the entire IT development and pilot volunteer team. These updates are brought to you jointly by the APA IT Department and the IT Steering, Scheduling, and Operational Analysis committees. Overage Hotels for September This is a new message from the APA Hotel Committee. In the Aug. 9 edition of the APA News Digest, we discussed reasons why you might be placed at a non-contracted hotel. One of those reasons would be an overage situation in a particular market. For your situational awareness, we are going to start publishing the list of overages for the next month after the company provides the list to us. Below is the list of overage hotels that will be utilized in September. If you are scheduled to stay at one of these properties, we recommend you review the Aug. 9 article .

For FDJ travelers who are checked in, but FDJ AA indicator is not present on the Priority List: Ticket counter/gate agents are not authorized to manually append FDJ AA. Request the agent to contact AA System Support Center (SSC) so the FDJ indicator can be added. SSC is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Their numbers are 800-741-0329 (inside the U.S.) and 480-693-6470 (abroad). In general, these numbers are for agent use, but a pilot could call if in need of assistance. Please send us a Jumpseat/Deadhead/Non-Rev Debrief if FDJ AA is not appended upon check-in. Be sure to include the method of check-in or device used (e.g., Android/iPad/agent). LIT is Coming to CLT This is a new message from the APA Safety Committee. Line pilot members of the AA/APA Learning and Improvement Team (LIT) will be at CLT on Aug. 26 and 27 to discuss how you, the line pilot, keep operations safe at CLT. LIT will be speaking with pilots transiting CLT on those days, asking safety-themed questions about CLT operations. LIT navigators will be in uniform with APA Safety lanyards in the A, B, C, and D concourses, C concourse crew room, main food court, and exit of KCM. Any pilot interaction with LIT is voluntary and de-identified. Your reply to a few questions helps AA and APA Safety better understand operational pressures and challenges AA pilots face within the system. Thank you for your participation, and we look forward to engaging with you. Pigs of the Week APA commends American Airlines’ hardworking aircraft maintenance technicians for their outstanding work. We believe they are the best in the business. When repetitive problems do arise, they’re often due to managerial decisions that fail to properly prioritize tasks and to management’s decision to outsource a significant portion of the airline’s maintenance to offshore, third-party repair stations. In the last 10 days, the cabin pressurization on B737 aircraft 3FL has been written up five times, has been on MEL once, and has been out of service four times. It was most recently signed off on Aug. 22 and is restricted to Class 1 or 2 maintenance stations. In the last three weeks, A321 aircraft 975 has been written up nine times and been out of service six times for NLG (nose landing gear) vibration/shimmy. It was recently operated under a special flight permit to a maintenance base for repairs. It was most recently signed off on Aug. 22 and is restricted to AA maintenance stations. APA Welcomes Leadership Class This is a new message from the APA Membership Committee. On Aug. 21, the APA Membership Committee hosted a casual dinner for the following pilots who were in Fort Worth for American Airlines’ Professionalism, Leadership, and Mentoring class: Ernesto Cintado, Joseph Elredy, Todd Fieser, Kyle Flynn, Kirby Gonyer, Benjamin Louden, Jeffrey Mathemeier, Gregory Moore, Jonathon Norman, Paul Peterson, Rochell Roache-Lanza, Kyle Salem-Roy, and Benjamin Wright. Hundreds of Pilots Enroll in APA Benefits Plans Aug. 1-15 was a special open enrollment period for two of APA’s benefits plans, Pilot Mutual Aid (PMA) and the Supplemental Medical Plan (SMP). Normally, enrollment in PMA is restricted to pilots with fewer than five years of service, and enrollment is SMP is restricted to pilots who are not yet 55 years old. But last April, the APA Board of Directors approved a pair of resolutions that temporarily waived those restrictions, which made the special open enrollment period possible. Here’s a look at how many pilots signed up for each plan during the special open enrollment period: PMA 440 pilots with at least five years of service 545 pilots with fewer than five years of service 91 pilots who were already enrolled and adjusted their benefit levels SMP 235 pilots who are at least 55 years old 185 pilots who are not yet 55 years old The APA Benefits Department fielded more than 5,000 phone calls during the special open enrollment period, which equates to about 455 calls per workday. For more information about APA’s benefits plans, review these videos featuring Director of Benefits Marcy Scott . APA Represented at OBAP Conference APA members CA Shanita Polk, FO Dominique Leonard-Curry, and CA Joshua Smith were among the attendees at the Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals’ annual conference in Memphis this week. APA’s booth at the conference was part of our continuing effort to reach current and future members during similar conferences hosted by the Latino Pilots Association, the National Gay Pilots Association, the Professional Asian Pilots Association, and Women in Aviation International. APA Medical Minute – Type 2 Diabetes In the latest edition of the APA Medical Minute , APA Medical Advisor Christopher Ryan addresses type 2 diabetes, including its diagnosis, medication, and the diabetes status report that must be submitted to the FAA. CLT Parking Lot Crimes Highlighted in TV Interview One our CLT-based members recently returned from a trip to find that his car’s wheels had been stolen. This was the latest in a string of thefts from the employee parking lot. “In aviation, safety is always the first priority,” CLT Domicile Vice Chair CA Erik DeWinne told WSOC-TV this week. “If we get you there on time, that’s great; that’s an added bonus. And frankly, the City of Charlotte and the airport are not putting safety first.” Click here to watch the full report .

One of the first questions a volunteer will ask you is: “Have you tried to resolve this issue yourself?” While resolving the issue between the two parties is truly resolution at the lowest possible level, many people are not comfortable with this scenario and utilize Professional Standards.

Pilot Couple Highlighted by Travel Blog Due to shifting schedules and standard operating procedures, there’s a good chance that the pilots on any given flight are meeting for the first time when they show up for work. On a recent flight documented by One Mile at a Time , that was definitely not the case. This one was operated by a married couple, CA Kale Gregory and FO Alan Gregory. Click the link above to read blogger Ben Schlappig’s account. APA Contract Minute – HEAT Delays This is a new message from the APA Contract Compliance Committee.

Be Sure to Check Your Travel Profile This is a new message from the APA Jumpseat/Non-Rev Committee. Be sure to check your Jetnet travel profile for accurate passport information before the next time you jumpseat. Several pilots have reported that their information was incorrect or deleted when they tried to jumpseat on Southwest flights. Southwest and other carriers use this information to clear pilots in CASS. Pigs of the Week APA commends American Airlines’ hardworking aircraft maintenance technicians for their outstanding work.

Seatbelts are Important, but Mandatory? Despite the changes in turbulence over the years, APA spokesman CA Dennis Tajer told Fox Business he doesn’t believe the FAA’s seat belt regulations need an update. But he said it’s vital that passengers wear seat belts while seated. “As basic as it is, the highest form of technology that can keep you from getting injured is having the seat belt on,” he said.

We create a webpage for a new hotel once AA has signed a contract with the hotel and an official CCI announcement has been made. If there is no webpage, then APA and AA, most likely, have not vetted this hotel. We see this often in our pop-up and overflow markets, in IROPs situations, and with off-schedule flights, as our contracted hotels may not have availability to accommodate additional rooms. We also see this during relocations, which can happen for a myriad of reasons. Can the company put you at a non-contracted hotel in these situations? Yes. Should you be concerned if you are at a non-contracted hotel? Not necessarily. Often these hotels are very good, but sometimes they are not. One of the concerns the Hotel Committee has with non-contracted hotels (and the source of many Hotel Debriefs on these properties) is that the hotel may not understand crew. When AA signs a contract with a hotel, the market specialist coaches the hotel on how to handle crew. Additionally, this occurs when we conduct a site review. There are many nuances for hotels to plan for when accommodating crew, like room placement and abnormal check-in/checkout times. When you check in to a non-contracted hotel, we recommend you take more caution. Is there a quieter side of the hotel you can request? Request a non-adjoining room if this is important to you. Do they have a late checkout annotated properly if your show time is after the hotel’s normal checkout? Please also understand that there will most likely not be a negotiated discount. Just like a layover at a contracted hotel, you can contact the Hotel/Limo Desk and/or the Duty Pilot to be relocated if you have issues. If you are unable to solve a problem, sometimes a quick call from the Hotel/Limo Desk to the hotel can help. Please debrief issues at non-contracted hotels so we can have AA look into the root cause of the issue or poor selection of the hotel. Sometimes we ask the company to move these hotels to a “do not use” list after receiving your debriefs. “The Safety Culture Needs a Lot of Work” The National Transportation Safety Board conducted a two-day hearing this week in Washington, D.C. regarding the Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines midflight door plug blowout and broader concerns about the state of Boeing’s manufacturing and quality control. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said “the safety culture needs a lot of work. It is not there from the evidence itself. There’s not a lot of trust.” In a News Nation interview, APA Communications Committee member CA Dennis Tajer — who attended the hearing — characterized the situation at Boeing as “a human factors nightmare.” National Aviation Week at the 9/11 Memorial During National Aviation Week from August 19-25, the 9/11 Memorial text-decoration: underline; background-color: transparent; transition: 0.2s; cursor: pointer; box-sizing: border-box;\">www.911memorial.org/aviationweek Please print your ticket before you visit.

In an effort to improve our members’ health, we have created a recommended reading list. Each month, we will highlight a book that has helped in the prevention of, treatment of, or recovery from an injury or illness, or has elevated a member’s education. Feel free to send your book recommendations to aeromed-committee@alliedpilots.org . The Sports Gene: Inside the Science of Extraordinary Athletic Performance The debate is as old as physical competition. Are stars like Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps, and Serena Williams genetic outliers put on Earth to dominate their respective sports? Or are they simply normal people who overcame their biological limits through sheer force of will and obsessive training? In this controversial and engaging exploration of athletic success and the so-called 10,000-hour rule, David Epstein tackles the great nature vs. nurture debate a how far science has come in solving it. Through on-the-ground reporting from below the equator and above the Arctic Circle, revealing conversations with leading scientists and Olympic champions, and interviews with athletes who have rare genetic mutations or physical traits, Epstein forces us to rethink the nature of athleticism.

We believe they are the best in the business. When repetitive problems do arise, they’re often due to managerial decisions that fail to properly prioritize tasks and to management’s decision to outsource a significant portion of the airline’s maintenance to offshore, third-party repair stations. Since July 7, A319 aircraft 738 has been written up for a right engine start fault 13 times and out of service eight times. It was last signed off on August 8 and is currently restricted to AA maintenance stations only. Since April 4, A319 aircraft 769 has been written up for vibration issues 19 times and out of service 17 times for a total OTS time of more than 1,400 hours (two months). During this time, it has operated under an SFP (Special Flight Permit) to maintenance bases three times and has accomplished six Functional Check Flights (FCFs). It remains out of service and is restricted to AA maintenance stations only. APA Welcomes Leadership Class This is a new message from the APA Membership Committee. Click the image for a closer look.

Professional Standards FAQ If You’re 50, Join The Grey Eagles Pilot Job Fairs and Future Pilot Seminars Thank You to Everyone at Oshkosh We thoroughly enjoyed meeting all of the pilots and their families who stopped by our hospitality area during EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, and we appreciate the efforts of the APA Family Awareness Committee, who made six evenings’ worth of dinners and happy hours possible. APA Medical Minute – Prostate Health In the latest edition of the APA Medical Minute , APA Medical Advisor Kathy Parr discusses prostate health, noting that it’s one of the most common topics members inquire about. APA Contract Minute – Reassignments This is a new message from the APA Contract Compliance Committee. CA Jason Saxer is back with a new APA Contract Minute . In this edition, he discusses Section 15.N, which provides for a pay, no credit removal from future flying for pilots reassigned over their Individual Monthly Maximum or the Company Limit on Voluntary Flying. Final Report on Governance and Reform This is a new message from the Governance and Reform Ad Hoc Committee. Last week, APA Vice President CA Chris Torres gave the Governance and Reform Ad Hoc Committee’s final brief to the Board of Directors. The committee, created last year in recognition of the APA membership’s desire for reforms, conducted extensive membership polling and interviewed former National Officers and Domicile Officers. Based on that feedback, the committee crafted a total of 57 proposals for Board consideration, with the Board approving 41 of them for action. The Board subsequently considered 24 related resolutions and voted to approve 22 of them. All members are welcome to read the committee’s final report . If Wait Times are Excessive, Help Yourself This is a new message from the APA Hotel Committee. Last week, we discussed “Booking in Progress.” What about when you arrive at a layover destination and realize you don’t have a room for the night, perhaps because you timed out? As many of you have experienced, wait times for Crew Tracking and the Hotel/Limo Desk have been lengthy lately. We do not recommend excessively delaying your rest because of these waits. If the wait time is excessive, and you know you will be laying over in the current city (Crew Tracking has repaired your sequence or you have timed out), you can book your own hotel room and ground transportation and expense them to the company. As a reminder, APA does not recommend using BizHero for company travel. To file an expense report for hotel and/or transportation reimbursement, you will need to use the SAP Concur app on your company iPad or use the link in AAPilots: Personal box-sizing: border-box;\">You will need to submit a photo of your receipt(s). All receipts for a particular trip may be included in the same Pilot Expense Report and must be submitted within 60 days of the incurred expense. Please contact your base flight office if you need help submitting a report. For more information, check out the recently updated QRH – Quick Reference Hotels document. This resource answers 99 percent of all hotel, transportation, and layover questions while providing helpful solutions. Suggestion: Download this QRH document to your AA iPad for easy access in the future. Join Us for YOUnion 401 on Aug. 14 This is a new message from the APA Compass Project Committee.

When repetitive problems do arise, they’re often due to managerial decisions that fail to properly prioritize tasks and to management’s decision to outsource a significant portion of the airline’s maintenance to offshore, third-party repair stations. Since July 13, the satellite communications on B787 aircraft 8LB has been written up eight times and been out of service three times. It was most recently written up on July 31 and remained out of service at the time of this writing.

Summer Statistics and Updates This is a new message from the APA Scheduling Committee. TTS enhancement continues to be a priority for the Scheduling Committee. Progress has been made even with the company’s commitment to Contract 2023 implementation. We continue to engage with our company counterparts on improvements and functionality. Notable stats from June: Highest number of TTS transactions ever. Highest number of PVDs used (facilitated by trading). Record low sick usage. (If pilots are trading, no need to use sick time.) July trading is following on the same trajectory. Our first three TTS runs for the August bid month have seen 2,900 awarded trades, with an average participation rate of 36% across all bid statuses. Please reach out to the Scheduling Committee with any questions on ballot building or run history. The Scheduling Committee is available to our pilots for help with anything that they can bid for: vacancy, vacation, TTS, DOTC, CQT, TDY, MBE, and PBS.

AAL Reports “Bronze Medal” Earnings This week, AAL management reported second quarter earnings that lived up – or lived down, rather – to this forecast from JP Morgan airlines analyst Jamie Baker: “The company (AAL) likely remains on the bronze medal podium when it comes to Big 3 margins.” During the earnings call, CEO Robert Isom disclosed that the failed sales and distribution strategy reduced revenue by $750M for the first half of the year, and management expects another $750M in lost revenue for the second half of the year, for a total 2024 impact of $1.5B. Here are some excerpts from the AAL filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission: “The company’s previous sales and distribution strategy will continue to impact its revenue performance and earnings through the remainder of the year.” “The company expects its third-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be approximately breakeven.” “The company now expects its full-year 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be between $0.70 and $1.30.” (~$460-$854M) “The company reduced total debt by approximately $680 million and is now more than $13 billion, or approximately 87%, toward its goal of reducing total debt by $15 billion by the end of 2025. The company ended the quarter with approximately $11.7 billion of total available liquidity.” Pre-Tax Profit (excluding special items) DAL: $2 billion UAL: $1.7 billion AAL: $1.04 billion Free Cash Flow (FCF) DAL: $1.3 billion UAL: $1.9 billion AAL: $850 million Margins 2Q24 Pre-Tax Op. Margin EBITDAR DAL 13.0% 14.7% 18.2% UAL 12.1% 13.1% 17.9% AAL 7.3% 9.7% 15.7% As for the $1.5B worth of lost revenue this year, Forbes reported that Delta and United have been coy in discussing whether American’s loss benefitted them. But APA spokesman CA Dennis Tajer said it clearly went to the rival carriers’ coffers. “We don’t need Nancy Drew to determine where the $1.5 billion went,” he said. Airline Analysts on AAL: “Disappointing,” “Discouraging,” and “Uninspiring” You can click here for an in-depth account of Wall Street analysts’ reactions to the AAL earnings call, but here are a few excerpts: Jamie Baker of J.P. Morgan: “We’d have to go back to the Arpey era (pre-dating both its merger and its bankruptcy filing) to identify an American earnings call as discouraging as Thursday’s. ... To paraphrase one investor, American’s call sounded disappointingly like ‘the old America West script but with meaningfully elevated costs,’ sentiment we can’t really push back on.” Thomas Fitzgerald of TD Cowen: “We expect the airline’s commercial challenges (overexposure to domestic and LatAm, challenges with corporate travel, underexposure to long-haul international) to weigh on margins. Driving significant changes in strategy will require years of elevated CAPEX investments and diminish the company’s prospects for generating consistent free cash flow.” Conor Cunningham of Melius: “American has been crystal clear that adjustments to the distribution strategy that cost them $750 mm in 1H are underway. But a further review of the business is needed as they lag Delta and United on margins. Investor patience is very thin at this point and additional adjustments are needed for a credible margin recovery story to return.” Look for an Updated Logbook in the Coming Months This is a new message from the APA IT Steering Committee. Thanks to the hard work of FO Ken Lambert, along with many others, an updated Logbook will be launched this fall with a revamped user interface and design, along with new features, integration, and attention to detail. New features will include: Convenient access to your flying Table and calendar view Sequence grouping of flying Running convenient totals Sequence- and flight-level detail of flying with integrated map overview Handy filters to search and display data Multiple export options Integrated statistics visualizations We are also diligently working to update and improve our previously released products and features and are excited to showcase them in the coming weeks. Here are just a few to look forward to: Trips Marketplace: Will include drops, shared sequences, last live leg. APA Calendar Sync: Supporting other calendars and an increase in the number of data items that can be synced. Sequence History: No more taking a snapshot of your HSS! EVERY update and change will be available to browse and access. Open Time Detected Log: A history of all open time to allow for further analysis of your MyOT alerts using the reasons report functions. Again, thank you to FO Lambert, CA Vince Trevarton, the other pilots on the IT Steering and Operational Analysis committees, and the staff in our APA IT Department for the hard work put in by all. As always, please keep your valuable feedback coming! It only helps to improve the services provided to our pilots. Check Out Our New Military Guidebook This is a new message from the Military Affairs Subcommittee. On Monday, the Military Affairs Subcommittee conducted a town hall via Zoom and briefed the Board of Directors in person. During the Board briefing, the subcommittee hosted FBI and Homeland Security agents to give a brief update on international travel concerns and the best paths to stay safe once you leave American soil. Most of the tips and pointers can be found on the DHS or FBI websites or the Security Committee’s page on AlliedPilots.org. Bottom line: Once you leave American soil, be prepared for anything, stay conservative in your actions, and be alert to your surroundings. The Zoom town hall began with FO Christine Simpson providing an overview of the new APA Military Guidebook . We believe the document is a one-stop shop for all military-related questions a pilot might have while serving our country and flying for AAL. The Guidebook can now be found on the Military Affairs page on AlliedPilots.org (Documents > General). The town hall also covered the high points we have seen over the past year in a PowerPoint presentation that will be posted on our webpage. Due to a technical issue with Zoom, we were unable to record the session. We will host another town hall next spring to highlight ongoing issues our pilots face. Stay safe flying, and reach out to us with any concerns at militaryaffairs@alliedpilots.org . “Booking in Progress” Guidance Has Not Changed This is a new message from the APA Hotel Committee. The last week has been rough! No doubt, many of you have felt the weight of putting our operation back together on your shoulders. Many crews have had difficulty getting hotels assigned due to lengthy waits getting their sequences repaired by Crew Tracking and lengthy waits on hold with the Hotel/Limo Desk. APA’s position has not changed. We recommend that you DO NOT DEPART on your last leg to a layover when “Booking in Progress” shows in your CCI Hotel/Limo information, unless you receive confirmation that you have lodging, or you are directed to depart by a Chief Pilot. “Booking in Progress” is a placeholder when no reservation exists. It does not necessarily indicate someone is actively working on booking you a room. Multiple crews have not followed this guidance lately and written to us to tell us it was a mistake. Crews who have waited to secure lodging have experienced lengthy waits after their last leg of the day. Some crews had the misfortune of arriving at a sold-out market only to learn that they were stuck with no hotel options. Had they insisted a room be booked prior to departure, this would not have happened. Although it’s not required, you may want to advise the Company of the reason why you aren’t departing and advise that you will be prepared to depart as soon as lodging is confirmed. If you can’t get through to the Hotel/Limo Desk, try the Duty Pilot, or consider sending an ACARS or HISEND message. Do not let the issue distract you from your preflight duties. Take care of yourself; take care of your crew. For more information, check out the recently updated QRH – Quick Reference Hotels document. This resource answers 99 percent of all hotel, transportation, and layover questions while providing helpful solutions. Suggestion: Download this QRH document to your AA iPad for easy access in the future. Concourse Conversations at DFW on July 31 This is a new message from the National Communications Network.

These events provide an opportunity for members at large to deliver feedback directly to union volunteers. We will be collecting feedback to send to the Board of Directors and National Officers. If your schedule allows, please stop by to chat. Pigs of the Week APA commends American Airlines’ hardworking aircraft maintenance technicians for their outstanding work. We believe they are the best in the business. When repetitive problems do arise, they’re often due to managerial decisions that fail to properly prioritize tasks and to management’s decision to outsource a significant portion of the airline’s maintenance to offshore, third-party repair stations. Since July 7, the Digital Flight Data Recorder on A321 aircraft 799 has been written up 11 times, been on MEL three times, and been out of service seven times. It was most recently signed off on July 25.

Good News for CDG Layovers This is a new message from the APA Hotel Committee. CDG layovers will continue at three airport properties through Sept. 8 due to the excessive drive times because of the Olympic-only lanes into the city. As a result of these relocations, the company has offered to reimburse pilots and flight attendants for one round-trip coach train ticket to downtown Paris. You can submit your receipt via Concur for reimbursement. Please note that this offer, which is good through Sept. 8, applies to only one round-trip coach ticket per layover. Each of our CDG airport properties have crafted an informative welcome letter for AA crews that includes this information. Please exercise heightened situational awareness if you choose to go into the city, as there is increased risk of crime during the Olympics.

Feel free to send your book recommendations to aeromed-committee@alliedpilots.org . Curable The United States is fast becoming the sickest nation in the Western world. Cancer rates continue to rise. There is an epidemic of chronic disease in children. Even with all the money and modern innovations in science, the country’s health care system is beyond broken. Clearly there is a glitch in the system. But what if the solution has been here all along, and we’ve just been too blind to see it? In Curable , journalist and health care advocate Travis Christofferson looks at medicine through a magnifying glass and asks an important question: What if the roots of the crisis are psychological and systemic, perpetuated not just by corporate influence and the powers that be, but by you and me? It is now known that human perception is based on deeply entrenched patterns of irrational thought, which we attach ourselves to religiously. So how does this implicate the very scientific research and data that doctors rely on to successfully treat their patients? Disclaimer: This recommendation is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine or other professional health care services. Always consult with your medical provider when making health care decisions. Pigs of the Week APA commends American Airlines’ hardworking aircraft maintenance technicians for their outstanding work.

During its upcoming regularly scheduled summer meeting, the Board of Directors will likely deliberate on The Line’s future and potential changes to related policy. Positive Rate Episode 26: Strategic Planning Committee In the latest episode of our “ Positive Rate ” podcast, Communications Committee Deputy Chair FO Melissa Monahan talks with Strategic Planning Committee Chair FO Scott Yancy, who details how the committee’s planning efforts have centered around eliminating silos and encouraging greater collaboration among the elected leadership, committees, and staff.

APA spokesman CA Dennis Tajer told senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave that he’s “more ready than I’ve ever been” to fly the company’s planes. “I have absolutely no hesitation in flying the aircraft based on what I know about it,” he said. “The unnerving part – particularly on the MAX – is that I don’t know what you put on it that you decided not to tell me.” Last month, CA Tajer was also featured in a 60 Minutes Australia report on the issues surrounding Boeing. In both interviews, he highlighted an FAA airworthiness directive that references “off-airport” landings. “What the heck does that mean? That’s a cornfield or the Hudson River.” Join Us for YOUnion 301 on July 17 This is a new message from the APA Compass Project Committee. The Compass Project and APA Vice President CA Chris Torres will host a “YOUnion 301” meeting via Zoom at 1100 Central on July 17. This “Captains’ Development Seminar” is intended to help new captains and soon-to-be captains understand their authorities, APA support, and safety trends within our airline. Click here to register for the July 17 meeting . Retiring Pilots Honored Via Fini Flight This is an updated message from the APA Family Awareness Committee. CA Tom Force was honored on June 5 at DFW. Fini Flight is an APA program designed to honor our retiring members. If a pilot chooses to participate, we meet them at the gate after (or sometimes before) their final flight as an American Airlines pilot. We include friends and family, play some music, bring a cake (or donuts), and make their last flight memorable! You can see more photos from our June celebrations on Facebook . For more information on how to get involved, as an honoree or as a volunteer, email finiflight@alliedpilots.org . Incidentals Charges This is an updated message from the APA Hotel Committee. This is a reminder to please remember to pay all incidentals you have charged to your room before you depart the hotel. Every month, the AA Hotel Contracts team has to contact crew members through their base Flight Offices to remind them to pay their incidentals. Additionally, these oversights can sour a relationship between a good hotel and the company. A good practice is to never charge to your room unless you already have a credit card on file, and make sure you have no unpaid charges at checkout. We have also seen an uptick in pilots being charged for their room at non-contracted hotels when they put their credit card on file for incidentals. We recommend that you ask for a zeroed-out bill before you depart any hotel if you choose to put a card on file. As a reminder, you should never be required to place a credit card on file by a hotel. If a hotel says they require you to do so, and you do not plan to put incidental charges on the room, please reach out to the Hotel-Limo Desk for resolution.

This resource answers 99 percent of all hotel, transportation, and layover questions while providing helpful solutions.
