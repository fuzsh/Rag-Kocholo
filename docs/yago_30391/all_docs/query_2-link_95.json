        "text": "CHARLESTON — The Eastern Illinois football and volleyball teams are coming off successful seasons and hoping for even more this year.\n\nHere's a quick look at both teams as they prepare for the 2024 season:\n\nFOOTBALL\n\nEastern Illinois is just a few weeks away from opening the season on August 29 at Illinois.\n\nThe Panthers have been listed among the preseason Top 25 in several preseason polls, and were one of the first teams receiving votes on the STATS Perform FCS Top 25 poll.\n\nEIU was the third team also receiving votes (No. 28) just behind Big South/OVC member UT Martin listed at No. 27. UT Martin was selected first in the preseason Big South/OVC Football poll released at the conference media day in July with Eastern Illinois selected second.\n\nEIU is coming off an 8-3 season and was one of the first four teams left out of last year's FCS playoffs. EIU finished the year ranked No. 24 in the final FCS Coaches Poll (which will be released closer to the start of the season).\n\nThe Panthers had four players named to the Phil Steele Preseason Big South/OVC Football first team. In total 13 Panthers were named to the publication's three preseason teams.\n\nRunning back MJ Flowers, wide receiver Eli Mirza, offensive lineman Sebastian Pares and linebacker Elijawah Tolbert were named to the preseason first team.\n\nLeading the second team selections were offensive linemen Drew Wilder and Nic DiSanto along with defensive lineman Joel Barrows, linebacker Anthony Shockey, defensive back Kaleb Lyons and kick returner Mark Aitken.\n\nQuarterback Pierce Holley was listed on the preseason third team with defensive lineman Nicholas Oliveira-Chace and long snapper Jack Valente.\n\nEarlier this week, Holley was named to the preseason watch list for the Walter Payton Award while Tolbert was named to the preseason watch list for the Buck Buchanan Award.\n\nHolley was also named the Big South/OVC Preseason Offensive Player of the Year as voted on by the league's head coaches and released on Big South/OVC Football Media Day.\n\nVOLLEYBALL\n\nOn the heels of an OVC Championship season which culminated in an NCAA Tournament appearance, Eastern Illinois volleyball has reloaded for the 2024 season with addition of eight new players.\n\nHead coach Sara Thomas has added a mixture of veteran and new players adding to the depth of the Panthers roster at several positions. Included in the mix of players are several with international playing experience including freshman Destiny Walker, who has played this summer with the Puerto Rican National Team.\n\nThe Panthers open the regular season on August 30 hosting Marquette — the team EIU lost to in last year's NCAA Tournament.\n\nThough EIU lost one of the top players in program history in Giovana Larregui Lopez along with Natalie Mitchem, Christina Martinez Mundo and Kate Dean (transferred to Virginia), the Panthers return outside hitter Kaitlyn Flynn, setter Catalina Rochaix, middle blocker Julia Stanev and defensive specialist Laura Paniagua.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHere's a look at the newcomers:\n\nAriadna Pereles is a 5-5 libero/defensive specialist from Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, who led her high school team to the national championship tournament during both her sophomore and senior years.\n\nDestiny Walker is a 5-10 outside hitter from Rio Grande, Puerto Rico, who played for the Puerto Rico Junior and Senior National Teams and has been part of Puerto Rico National Team U19, U21 and Senior National Team since 2022. She has international experience playing at the World Championships, Pan American Cup, Pan American Games, Continental Championship, Challenger Cup and the Olympics\n\nKatie Kopshever, a 5-11 outside hitter from Newburgh, Indiana, led Castle High to four straight conference championships and Indiana Class 4A State Runners-Up during her sophomore and senior years. She was an All-State selection as a junior and senior, and finished her high school career with more than 1,000 kills.\n\nMatilda Dahlstrom, a 6-1 middle blocker from Malmo, Sweden, is a transfer from Hillsborough College in Florida, where she led the NJCAA in kills per set (4.72) and points per set while ranking fourth in the nation in total kills with 515 as a sophomore to earn honorable mention All-American.\n\nKarli Mann is a 5-10 outside hitter from Herrin helped lead her team to regional championships as a freshman and as a senior.. She registered more than 1,000 kills in high school.\n\nManon Braunsteffer, a 6-2 middle blocker from Paris, France, is a transfer from Monroe College in New York, where she led the NJCAA in attack percentage finishing the season with a .397 hitting clip with 220 kills (2.22).\n\nJulia Udell, a 5-4 libero/defensive specialist from Fullerton, Calif., is a transfer from Iowa Western who began her collegiate career at Cal Baptist. Last year for Iowa Western she was an All-Region selection, ranking sevnenth in the NJCAA in total digs at 657 with a 5.02 digs per set average.\n\nEmma Schroeder is a 6-2 middle blocker from Rockton who is transfering from Kent State, where she appeared in 18 matches over two seasons. She was a multi-time all-conference at Rockton Hononegah.\n\nMEN'S BASKETBALL\n\nEIU announced more games\n\nEastern Illinois has announced three additional games to its 2024-25 non-conference schedule. The Panthers will play in the four-team DePaul Classic MTE at the end of November.\n\nThe event includes road games for EIU at DePaul (Nov. 19), at Valparaiso (Nov. 24) and hosting Northern Illinois (Nov. 29).\n\nThe games are the latest non-conference contests announced for EIU which has previous road games at Indiana (Nov. 10), Northwestern (Nov. 15) and Butler (Dec. 3) publicized by those host schools.\n\nThe Ohio Valley Conference released its slate of league games in late July with EIU opening OVC play on Dec. 19 at Southeast Missouri. The home OVC opener for EIU will be just after the new year hosting Lindenwood on Jan. 2.\n\nThe 2024-25 complete basketball schedule will be released when complete in the coming weeks.\n\nGOLF\n\nToler hired as new coach\n\nEastern Illinois Athletics has hired Craig Toler as the Panthers new head coach for men's and women's golf.\n\nToler joins the EIU staff replacing Mike Moncel, who retired on August 1 after leading the programs for 25 years.\n\nToler played collegiate golf at both Parkland College and Southern Indiana. He began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Eastern Illinois and then served as an assistant coach with Moncel for 10 years. During that time EIU produced several All-Ohio Valley Conference performers and top ten performances on the course.\n\nFollowing his time as an assistant coach at EIU, Toler worked at the high school and junior high levels at both Teutopolis and Sullivan, coaching a number of sports including boys basketball and girls golf. He earned his degree from EIU in 2007.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
