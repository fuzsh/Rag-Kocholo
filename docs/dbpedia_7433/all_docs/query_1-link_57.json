        "text": "Modern scholarship has accumulated profound information about the role of various Muslim powers and nations in the history of the Empire of Trebizond. The only significant gap in the general picture of the Grand Komnenian politics in the Orient is represented by the Golden Horde. Sources preserve almost nothing about the links between Trebizond and the Juchid Ulus. The objective of this paper is to discuss all known evidence concerning the role of the Golden Horde in the Pontos and to give a hypothetical reconstruction of the links between the Juchid Mongols and the Grand Komnenoi.\n\nIn late 1437, after a long journey across the Mediterranean, Castilian traveller Pero Tafur reached Constantinople. Once inside the city, he gained access to the imperial court of John VIII Palaeologos, claiming ancestry ties with the emperor himself. According to Tafur, he was descended from an exiled Byzantine prince“don Pedro”, who supposedly found refuge in Spain during the 11th century. This unlikely forefather, however, was much more than just a tale fabricated by Tafur. Most notably, it constituted an integral part of the genealogy of the noble family of Álvarez de Toledo, better known as the holders of the Duchy of Alba from 1472 onwards. Firstly, this paper will seek to examine the role of Byzantine prince “don Pedro” in the construction of the genealogical narratives pertaining to the Álvarez de Toledo. Secondly, it will examine the socio-political changes in Castile which favoured such use of perceived familiar connection with Byzantium to build group identity and bolster familiar prestige. Furthermore, the present paper will aim to offer for the first time a comprehensive record of late medieval primary sources which mention the “Byzantine genealogy” of the Álvarez de Toledo.\n\nIt has often been said it would be impossible to write the history of the empire of Trebizond (1204-1461) without the terse and often frustratingly laconic chronicle of the Grand Komnenoi by the protonotarios of Alexios III (1349-1390), Michael Panaretos. While recent scholarship has infinitely enhanced our knowledge of the world in which Panaretos lived, it has been approximately seventy years since a scholar dedicated a historiographical study to the text. This study examines the world that Panaretos wanted posterity to see, examining how his post as imperial secretary and his use of sources shaped his representation of reality, whether that reality was Trebizond’s experience of foreigners, the reign of Alexios III, or a narrative that showed the superiority of Trebizond on the international stage. Finally by scrutinizing Panaretos in this way, this paper also illuminates how modern historians of Trebizond have been led astray by the chronicler, unaware of how Panaretos selected material for inclusion for the narratives of his chronicle."
