        "text": "Byzantine Coins, 1204-1453\n\n(Go to the first page and Table of Contents of this introduction to Byzantine coins.)\n\nWhat's new? (March 3, 2020) Theodore I, from the Empire of Thessalonica.\n\nAfter the crusaders of the Fourth Crusade conquered Constantinople in 1204 they ruled the cities of Constantinople and Thessalonica, but not the rest of the empire. Byzantines from important families set up rival states--the Empire of Nicaea, The Empire of Trebizond (on the south east Black Sea coast), and The Despotate of Epirus, and when Thessalonica was recovered in 1224, The Empire of Thessalonica. Coins of the Empire of Trebizond are found in its neighborhood and easy to distinguish from Byzantine coins, but coins of the Latin rulers of Constantinople, the three other Byzantine states, and the Bulgarians are quite similar and were not clearly distinguished until 1969 when Hendy published Coinage and Money in the Byzantine Empire, 1081-1261. Even so, it is hard for a collector to distinguish them unless he or she has a comprehensive illustrated reference book for the period.\n\nLatin Rulers of Constantinople\n\n1204-1261\n\n24-17 mm. 2.10 grams. Trachy.\n\nBust of Christ\n\nArchangel Michael, winged, XM to right\n\nSear 2036. DOC 4.2 Plate L, 16.4.\n\nCoins of the Latin rulers are not yet dated more precisely than their entire control over Constantinople, from 1204 to 1261. Maybe some day hoard evidence will help put them in chronological order. It is certainly the case that a great deal of research has been published in this millennium about these previously understudied coins.\n\nAs you can see, there is no identifying legend other than the enigmatic \"XM\" to the right. How can we know whether this is Latin, Nicaean, or Bulgarian? See Hendy's book and his Dumbarton Oaks volume IV for the evidence. It is not easy to distinguish this coin from other Byzantine-era coins. Sear has a virtually complete list of types, but they are difficult to identify without pictures and Sear has photos of only a fraction of the types. Fortunately, a few well-illustrated references have been published recently.\n\nBulgarian imitative.\n\n22 mm. 1.91 grams. Trachy.\n\nBust of Christ\n\nKing standing facing\n\nThis is very much like a Byzantine coin, but has been attributed to the Bulgarian King Constantine Asen Tich, 1257-1277.\n\nDimnik & Dobrinic MSCB 3.1.5, page 220.\n\nTrebizond. When Constantinople fell to the Crusaders in 1204 parts of the empire were retained by locally-important families. Trebizond was founded along the southeast shore of the Black Sea by a Comnenus, Alexius I Comnenus, grandson of Androncius I. The Empire of Trebizond on the south east Black Sea coast was not contiguous with the other Byzantine states. It was surrounded by and paid tribute to the Seljuk Turks and later the Mongols and Ottomans, who ended it in 1461, eight years after the fall of the restored empire. Trebizond had silver mines and most of their coins are good silver.\n\nManuel I of Trebizond. 1238-1263.\n\nSilver. 22 mm. An \"asper.\"\n\nManuel I standing\n\nSt. Eugenius standing. ÐVΓÐNIO\n\nSear 2601.\n\nThe great majority of coins of Trebizond are silver. Otto Retowski illustrates about 250 coins on 15 page plates in Die Münzen der Komnenen von Trapezunt.\n\nTheodore I, Empire of Nicaea, 1208-1221.\n\nSilver. 33-30 mm. Trachy.\n\nChrist enthroned\n\nFull-length figures of the emperor and St. Theodore\n\nSear 2064. Mint of Magnesia.\n\nGold was not issued by Theodore I, but was reinstituted by his successor, John III. This \"silver\" coin may have a bit of gold in it, but not enough to see by its color.\n\nTheodore I, Empire of Nicaea, 1208-1221\n\n28-26 mm. 3.55 grams. Trachy.\n\nChrist standing\n\nEmperor standing, ΔÐ to left\n\nKOM for Comnenus to the right.\n\nOverstruck on a brockage. You can see the incuse head and cross of a reverse at 7:00-8:00 on the obverse.\n\nSear -- but would be just before 2067.\n\nThe quality of this coin is low, but typical. Trachy are usually double struck and often the key letters intended to identify the emperor on the left and right of the reverse are slurred or not stuck up. This one is badly double struck on the reverse. The second strike of the single figure put him off-center to the left and allowed \"KOM\" to the right to appear clearly. Usually those letters are obscure. This time they help pin down the identification. Some reference books use line drawings so that all the details from several examples can be shown with one image. It is extremely rare for a single coin to show all the details present on the dies.\n\nJohn III, Ducas, called Vatatzes, 1221-1254.\n\nJohn III, 1221-1254. Empire of Nicaea.\n\n29 mm. 3.26 grams. Trachy.\n\nFull length figure of St. George, right hand holds spear resting over his shoulder\n\nEmperor enthroned\n\nSear 2108. DOC IV part II John III 54.\n\nMagnesia mint.\n\nJohn III, 1221-1257, Empire of Nicaea\n\n19 mm. 2.07 grams.

Grierson 1188.\n\nAgain, the general design and (non-existent) legends are not very distinctive, but the lis is. With a reference books with many coins of this era illustrated, this coin can be identified.\n\nEmpire of Thessaloncia (The tan-colored area on the map from wikipedia). Theodore Angelus Comnenus Ducas, 1225-1230. In 1215 the Crusaders (\"Latins\") were in charge of Constantinople, a region around it, and some of Greece (the tan-colored area on the map from wikipedia) including Thessalonica, the second-largest city after Constantinople. The Despotate of Epirus occupied the west coast of Greece. The Bulgarians occupied much of the rest of the Balkins. The Empire of Nicaea occupied Asia Minor outside the Latin territory. Theodore became ruler of the Despotate of Epirus in 1215 upon the death of his half-brother Michael Angelus. (There is a different Theodore, Theodore I Lascaris, who was Emperor of Nicaea.) He was a relative of three of the most promient Byzantine families, which explains all those names. In 1224 Theodore reconquered Thessalonica from the Latins and founded \"The Empire of Thessalonica\". In 1230 he invaded Bulgarian territory and lost his army and was captured by Ivan (a.k.a. John) II Asen, the Bulgarian Tsar. Initially treated well, he was blinded after plotting against Ivan. Amazingly, that was not the end of his political involvement. After many more complicated events, Ivan's first wife died during an epidemic and Theodore managed to persuade Ivan to take his, Theodore's, daughter, Irene (who then was renamed Anna) as his new wife. As father-in-law of the Tsar, he was released, went back to Thessalonica in disguise, and deposed his brother, Manuel Comnenus-Ducas, in 1237 and installed his son, John Comnenus-Ducas, who was \"emperor\" only until 1242 and then was obliged to accept the lessor title of \"despot\" and acknowledge John III Comnenus-Dukas, emperor of Nicaea, as overlord. John III of Nicaea took full control in 1246, bringing the \"Empire of Thessalonica\" to an end. (This is only one of many sequences of events where the history is truly \"Byzantine.\")\n\nTheodore of Thessalonica, Comnenus-Ducas\n\n31 mm.

Mother of God)\n\nSear 2167\n\nDO IV.II Theodore 9\n\nMichael VIII, Palaeologus, the restored empire, 1261-1282. Michael VIII founded the Palaeologid dynasty which lasted until the end of the empire in 1453. In 1258 he became regent for the the last Nicaean emperor and in 1261 he reconquered Constantinople and \"restored\" the Byzantine empire.\n\nMost Palaeologid types were rare and barely studied until the 1980's. The first edition of Sear did not even attempt to list them all, but, with the help of Simon Bendall, the great expert on late Byzantine types (who, unfortunately, died in 2019), the second edition is nearly complete. You would need some other reference work for photographic coverage, but such books exist now and they didn't in 1980.\n\nMichael VIII, Palaeologus. 1259-1282.\n\n25-22 mm. 1.49 grams.\n\nBust of Christ, K to left\n\nThree figures. Michael kneeling below seated Christ on right, supported by St. Michael.\n\nXMΔÐCΠ\n\nSear 2259. DOC V.II plate 4, 46-51.\n\nPalaeologid coins usually have serious flan cracks, irregular flans, and poor strikes. Many types were unknown in the west until after the Iron Curtain came down. It is easy to see why scholars avoided this area of study until the corpus filled out and hoards were recorded. Who wouldn't rather work with attractive Greek and Roman coins?\n\nHere is an off-site map of Europe in AD 1300. (The Byzantine Empire is in pink. The empire includes only parts of Greece, the Balkans, and western Asia Minor.)\n\nAndronicus II, 1282-1328.\n\nAndroncius II, 1282-1328, as sole ruler 1282-1295.\n\n23-22 mm. 1.82 grams.\n\nfacing bust of Christ\n\nFull-length figure of emperor with large fleur-de-lis in each hand.\n\nSear 2372\n\nSome coins are cup-shaped, but during the Palaeologid dynasty the diameters are reduced and the cup-shape less pronounced. Also, many flat coins are issued.\n\nAndronicus II, 1282-1328, struck 1303 or 1318, as indiction year 1 of a fifteen-year cycle.\n\n19 mm. 1.54 grams. Flat.\n\nAndronicus II and Michael IX\n\nNA for year 1, with a curved line above the N\n\nSear 2432. Grierson 1481.\n\nAn indiction was a fifteen-year period of time which was used for fiscal planning. When a reign lasts more than 15 years some indiction years appear twice--fifteen years apart, which is why the date of this coin is given as \"1303 or 1318\". There are rare coins of Justin dated by the indiction year, but the practice lapsed until resumed very under Andronicus II.\n\nComment for Collectors: Palaeologid coins generally have extremely low quality. Ragged flans, poor strikes, crude designs, and lack of identifying lettering are all more common than not. Before the 1990s (when the Iron Curtain came down) they were rare in the West and high priced because of their rarity, although there were very few coins offered and very few collectors interested in them. Now we know they exist in large numbers, but their terrible quality still entices few collectors. Prices are now below Sear's values. Some dealers still price them high as if Sear's values were relevant (hoping you have not read this), but they are not. If a Palaeologid coin has good quality (almost unheard of) it can command much more, but coins of typical quality like most of these should be under $50. There are very many types (unlike for emperors in the 8th-10th centuries) and individually many are rare or very rare, but demand is equally rare. I doubt many collectors are attempting to assemble complete sets, so even rarities can go low. On the other hand, any piece of high quality is immediately noticeable and will not go low.\n\nAndronicus II, 1282-1328.\n\n22-20 mm. 1.66 grams.\n\nlarge six-pointed star\n\nEmperor standing facing between large B on right and large backward B on the left.\n\nThis arrangement of B's is associated with the Palaeologid dynasty.\n\nSear 2393\n\nAndroncius II, 1282-1328, and Michael VIII, 1295-1320\n\n21-19 mm. 2.52 grams.\n\nChrist ith his hands on the heads of by 3/4-length figures of Androncius and Michael and either side.\n\nArchangel, holding sword or scepter over his right shoulder\n\nSear 2435. LPC page 88 #36.\n\nThis coin, even though it is not great, has higher quality than most and is probably worth twice what most others are.\n\nSilver returned to fashion under Andronicus II.\n\nAndronicus III, 1328-1341, Grandson of Androncius II.\n\nAndronicus III, 1328-1341\n\n22-20 mm. Very ragged flan.\n\nSt. Demetrius, half-length (very weak).\n\nEmperor standing with two patriarchal crosses.\n\nPatriarchal crosses are common on Palaeologid coins.\n\nSear 2486. LPC Andronicus III page 236-7 #6\n\nAndronicus III, 1328-1341\n\n21-20 mm. 1.61 grams. The type is flat, but this piece has a slight bend.\n\nCross fleury\n\nStanding figure of Androncus III holding cross-scepter\n\nPωMAIO AVTOKPAT (of the Romans, emperor)\n\nSear 2481.\n\nAfter Andronicus III. From the next emperor, John V, 1341-1391, to the end of the empire in 1453, all copper coins are very rare. It seems the Byzantine state was too busy with external threats to bother with providing small change for the everyday needs of the citizens. However, gold and silver were still being produced and are quite available today. Their quality is low which deters many collectors, so examples are not expensive.\n\nJohn VII, 1399-1402\n\n20 mm. 3.76 grams.\n\nSilver half-stavraton (the names of the denominations are not certain and reported variously)\n\nBust of Christ facing, holding book of gospels\n\nBust of John facing.\n\nThe name John is written from 1:00 to 2:00 and only \"AN\" is legible.\n\nSear 2562.\n\nHere is an off-site map of Europe in AD 1400. (The Byzantine Empire is in pink. You can see there is almost no territory left except the city of Constantinople itself.)\n\nJohn VIII, 1423-1448, the Second-Last Byzantine emperor."
