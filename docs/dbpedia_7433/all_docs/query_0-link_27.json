        "text": "THE SOUTHERN SHORE of the Black Sea is a narrow strip of fertile land–famed for excellent hazelnuts–between the sea and the rugged Anatolian plateau. The coastal fortress of Trebizond (“Trapezus” to the ancient Greeks and Romans, now Trabzon, Turkey) was the capital of a small, but remarkably durable medieval empire, remembered as the last independent outpost of Byzantine Civilization. We know something about the coinage of this lost empire thanks to diligent research by a handful of scholars and collectors during the past century, notably the great British numismatist Simon Bendall (1937-2019).\n\nThe aim of this paper is to present for the first time the \"A Group of Trebizond Empire Coins\", which is accommodated in the Coin Cabinet of the İzmir Archaeology Museum. \"A Group of Trebizond Empire Coins\" from the İzmir Archaeology Museum contains 74 silver coins and dates to the 13th and 14th centuries. In this study, a comparative evaluation will be made with other finds of the 13th and 14th centuries in Anatolia. The paper will explore the geographical location and the political context of the find, describe its composition, compare it with published hoards and finds of similar content and provenance, and place it in its historical and economic setting. This presentation is also expected to contribute to the very few studies on the coins of the Empire of Trebizond. https://akmed.ku.edu.tr/en/events/akmed-numismatics-congress/\n\nThe nature of settlements in the sixth-century Balkans is a matter of current debate. Amphorae and hoards of iron implements and weapons have been discussed in relation to this controversy. A key problem is that of the use of coins in an economic environment without any large-scale agricultural production. While hoards of coins have been analyzed in relation to the presence of the military in the Balkans, single finds of coins remain a category of archaeological evidence commonly neglected in discussions of the sixth-century economy. The article offers an explanation connected with the quaestura exercitus implemented in 536, and its conclusion is that the small copper denominations discovered on hilltop sites in the Balkans were not obtained on the market (none existed in any of the many hilltop sites known so far), but piggybacked on transports of annona."
