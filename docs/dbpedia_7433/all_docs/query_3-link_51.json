He canceled Venetian trading privileges granted by his father but was forced to restore them after the Venetians launched a fleet against him. He thwarted Pecheneg, Hungarian, and Serbian threats during the 1120s, and in 1130 he allied himself with the German emperor Lothar II (III) against the Norman king Roger II of Sicily.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz"
