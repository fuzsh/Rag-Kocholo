        "text": "Map courtesy of the University of Texas Libraries, The University of Texas at Austin\n\nThe Empire of Trebizond (Gr: Βασίλειον τής Τραπεζούντας) was a Byzantine Greek successor state of the Byzantine Empire founded in 1204 after the capture of Constantinople following the Fourth Crusade. The empire was formed with the help of Queen Tamar of Georgia who provided troups to her nephews Alexios I and his brother David who conquered the Pontic Greek city of Trebizond, Sinope and Paphlagonia. It is often known as \"the last Greek Empire\".\n\nWhen Constantinople fell in 1204 to the western European and Venetian Crusaders, the Empire of Trebizond was one of the three smaller Greek states that emerged from the wreckage along with the Empire of Nicaea and the Despotate of Epirus. Alexios, a grandson of Byzantine emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, made Trebizond his capital and asserted a claim to be the legitimate successor of the Byzantine Empire. The empire waged an unending economic, political and military war against other interests along the Black Sea coastline from 1204 until they were finally annexed by the Ottomans in 1461.\n\nOne significant reason that western historians have given Trapezuntine Byzantium little scrutiny is that the nation's rulers were very willing to reach an accommodation with Islamic dynasties and states in order to preserve that independence. The Mongols were particular patrons of Trebizond, as they chose to pass all the trade coming west along the silk road through the ports and towns of northern Anatolia. Trebizond was therefore an immensely wealthy state at times, and used its economic strength to hire professional soldiers from all around the region.\n\nThe Emperors of Trebizond\n\nAlexius I Komnenos, 1204-1222\n\n(grandson of Andronicus I Komnenos of Byzantium)\n\nAndronicus I Gido 1222-1235\n\nJohn I Komnenos 1235-1238\n\nManuel I Komnenos, 1238-1263\n\nAndronicus II Komnenos 1263-1266\n\nGeorge Komnenos 1266-1280\n\nJohn II Komnenos 1280-1284\n\nTheodora Komnenos 1284-1287\n\nAlexius II Komnenos 1287-1330\n\nAndronicus III Komnenos 1330-1332\n\nManuel II Komnenos, 1332-1333\n\nBasilieos Megas Komnenos 1332-1340\n\nIrene Paleologos 1340-1341\n\nAnna Anachoutlou 1341\n\nMichael Komnenos 1341-1342 (first rule)\n\nJohn III Komnenos 1342-1344\n\nMichael Komnenos 1344 ñ 1349 (restoration)\n\nAlexius III Komnenos 1349-1390\n\nManuel III Komnenos 1390-1416\n\nAlexius IV Komnenos 1416-1429\n\nJohn IV Komnenos 1429-1459\n\nDavid Komnenos 1459-1461"
