        "text": "Greetings,\n\nGiven the recent controversy over certain incorrect descents from the\n\nSeljukid Sultans I thought it might be of some interest to present a\n\nvalid line from Kilic Arslan II to the Renaissance Venetian nobility:\n\n1. Kilic Arslan II, Sultan of Ikonion. b. ca. 1115. d. 1192. (ODB\n\nII: 1128; Rudt-Collenberg, tab. XIII [Q]).\n\n2. Toghril Shah, Emir of Erzerum. r. 1201-1225. He is omitted in\n\nRudt-Collenberg's version of this descent. (Toumanoff, 453;\n\nRudt-Collenberg, tab. XIII [Q]).\n\n3. Moughir-ed-Din, Emir of Erzerum. m. 1224 (Toumanoff) or 1228\n\n(Rudt-Collenberg) to Rusudan I, Queen of Georgia, b. 1195, d. 1245.\n\n(Toumanoff, 124, 453; Rudt-Collenberg, tab. XIII [Q]).\n\n4. David IV Narin, co-King of Georgia & King of Imeret'i. d. 1293.\n\nHe may have m. and illegitimate daughter of Emperor Michael VIII\n\nPalaiologos. (Toumanoff, 453).\n\n5. Constantine I, King of Imeret'i. r. 1293-1326. (Toumanoff, 453).\n\n6. Bagrat I the Little, Eristavi (Duke) of Imeret'i. r. 1330-1372.\n\nm. 1358 to a daughter of Qwarqware II, Eristavi of Samtskhe.\n\n(Toumanoff, 453).\n\n7. Alexander I, Eristavi & King of Imeret'i. r. 1372-1389. m. to\n\nAnna. (Toumanoff, 454).\n\n8. T'amar, Princess of Imeret'i. d. after 1441. m. 1414/15 to\n\nAlexander I the Great, King of Georgia. b. 1390. d. 1446.\n\n(Toumanoff, 126, 454).\n\n9. [daughter], Princess of Georgia. b. ca. 1412. d. before 1438. m.\n\n1425 to Ioannes IV Komnenos, Emperor of Trebizond. r. 1429-1458.\n\n(Toumanoff, 127; Sturdza, 281).\n\n10. Valenza Komnene. See below. m. to Niccolo Crispo, Lord of\n\nSantorini, Regent of the Duhcy of the Archipelago, 1447-1450. d.\n\n1450. (Sturdza, 281, 512).\n\n11a.

Lucrezia Crispo. m. to Leone Malipiero.\n\n11e. Petronella Crispo. m. 1437 to Jacopo di Nicolo Priuli.\n\n11f. Maria Crispo. m. 1442 to Nicolo di Marino Balbi.\n\n11g. Fiorenza Crispo. m. 1444 to Marco di Giorgio Cornaro.\n\n11h. Valenza Crispo. m. 1446 to Giovanni di Luigi Loredano, Lord of\n\nAntiparos.\n\n11i. Marco Crispo, Knight of the Order of St. John.\n\n11j. Violanta Crispo. m. 1453 to Caterino di Dragone Zeno.\n\n11k. Antonio Crispo, Lord of Syra. d. 1476. m. a dau. of Pietro\n\nPaterio, co-Lord of Chios.\n\n(All the above is from Sturdza, 512).\n\nThis numerous brood left descendants throughout the Venetian nobility\n\nand the Italian rulers of the Greek Archipelago. Although I haven't\n\nattempted to trace any lines down to the present day I imagine there\n\nmust be many.\n\nSo far as I am aware the only possible weak link in the above\n\ngenealogy is Valenza Komnene whose existence has been questioned but\n\nit apparently is nonetheless well-proven by Venetian sources.

Firstly, the ascendancy of Valenza is debatable:\n\n> see M.

Allegedly he was born 1429 3 years after he got married.\n\nHis wife was born about 1410 and all his/her children were born before 1426,\n\nthe day they got married and before he was born.\n\nI do not understand why there are so many versions about John, his marriage\n\nand his children.\n\nAnother problem is that Niccolo Crispo had a daughter also called \"Valenza\".\n\nThis daughter married Giovanni Loredan in 1446.\n\nI think that indicates that his wife may have had another name or was not of\n\nGreek decent or died when the daughter was born.\n\nI do not know another \"Byzantine\" lady with the first name \"Valenza\".\n\nDr. George Tsambourakis\n\n10 Mills Crescent\n\nToormina, NSW-2452, Australia\n\neachw...@bigpond.com.au\n\nwww.users.bigpond.com/eachwaynet\n\n\"Pierre Aronax\" <pierre...@hotmail.com> wrote in message\n\nnews:408a332a$0$7904$79c1...@nan-newsreader-03.noos.net...\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Kelsey J.

To have a Balentza [? strange name for a Byzantine princess]\n\nKomnènè mother of the children you give to her, you need her to be born at\n\nleast in 1400 or before (since her first supposed daughter married in 1429).\n\nBig problem since her supposed father John IV Komnènos is born after 1395...\n\n> but the marriage dates of Niccolo & Valenza's\n\n> daughters seem to present a serious problem.

If you want to\n\nretain the data he gave for them, you will have serious chronological (or\n\nphysiological) difficulties anyway. See that: if your Georgian princess who\n\nmarried John IV was indeed born in 1412 (notwithstanding the date you gave\n\nfor her parents' marriage), then she can not have given him a daughter\n\nbefore, at the best, 1428. This daughter herself can not have married before\n\n1440 and can not have had a first child before ca 1445. But her supposed\n\nhusband died in 1450 and you say they had eleven children, which makes a\n\nratio of more than two children by year!\n\n> I don't have access to _Archéion Pontou_.

Nothing, absolutely nothing is known for sure\n\nabout the wife of Dèmètrios Palaiologos, and you, you have not only\n\nher name but also the name of her father and even the name of her\n\nmother! Could you be so kind to provide a source for such novelties or\n\nis it below you to go into that kind of trivialities? Incidently, that\n\nis simply impossible: you make of Théodôra the wife of her second\n\ncousin, a marriage strictly forbiden by the Orthodox Church. There\n\nwould be also a problem to make of Théodôra the daughter of an other\n\nThéodôra, but that is not really an objection since you invented the\n\nname of David's wife, which is not given by the sources. I don't even\n\nspeak of the chronological problems that would imply...\n\nAs I already explained, Dèmètrios' wife MIGHT have been a Théodôra\n\nKomnènè. Of course, even if such is indeed the case, that does not\n\nmake her a daughter of an emperor of Trebizond for that. And I see\n\nreally absolutely NO reason to make her the daughter of a King of\n\nGeorgia.\n\n> 12.

The only\n\nsource we have on this lady (which does not give her name actually) says she\n\nwas a daughter of John IV. Or 1) the source is correct, and the so was she,\n\nor 2) the source is wrong, and then she did not exist, or 3) we can, using\n\nother evidences, give her an other parentage but keep the other informations\n\ngiven by this source.

We have not a source which says\n\nonly that she was \"from Trebizond\", but one which gives much more precise\n\ndetails.\n\nAccording to Massarelli, Alexios IV had an other daughter who became the\n\nwife of the \"emperor of Iberia\". In a previous discussion, I have suggested\n\nthat she must be indentified with the wife of Mamia of Gouria, since Mamia\n\nis known from Chalkokandylès to have been David II's \"gambros\".\n\nConsequently, he was generally considered as his son-in-law, but as we know\n\n\"gambros\" can mean many things, including brother-in-law, and that would fit\n\nrather well with Massarelli's indication.\n\nPierre\n\nComments interspersed:\n\nPierre Aronax wrote:\n\n> \"Peter Stewart\" <p_m_s...@msn.com> a écrit dans le message de\n\n> news:88abeaa.04042...@posting.google.com...\n\n<snip>\n\n>>Other supposed daughters of Alexios IV were briefly argued out of\n\n>>existence, including Valenza who had been sometimes accredited to him\n\n>>instead of his son Ioannes IV.\n\n>>In this paper Kursanskis suggested that\n\n>>rather than being a princess from Trebizond (possibly an aunt or even\n\n>>great-aunt and not sister of Theodora khatun, as postulated in his\n\n>>earlier article about her cited in this thread)\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> This hypothesis mentionned by Kursanskis are very feeble IMHO.

If \"Balentza\" was not a daughter of John IV, there is no way to find\n\n> her an other precise place between his relatives.\n\nI agree, Kursanskis didn't make a strong case the first time round, in\n\nhis paper 'Une alliance problématique au XVe siècle: le mariage de\n\nValenza Comnena, fille d'un empereur de Trébizonde, à Niccolò Crispo,\n\nseigneur de Santorin', _Archeion Pontou_ 30 (1970-71), but his later\n\nsuggestion of an Italian origin is strange. No wonder George\n\nTsambourakis took the brief summary as applying to Valenza's name rather\n\nthan nationality.\n\nThe source for Valenza's relationship to Theodora isn't apparently a\n\nsolid one, yet the criticism by Kursanskis glances off from this on one\n\ntangent only. It is clear from Ramusio's account that Theodora treated\n\nCaterino Zeno as her kinsman, and she is reported to have called him\n\n\"nephew\" - but then this is given as a reason he was chosen for the\n\nembassy in the first place (when we are also told elsewhere that he was\n\nonly the third choice), it is _not_ given as any part of the reason for\n\nUsun Hasan allowing Zeno access to Theodora, and the nature of the\n\nconnection is never specified. Even if Ramusio wasn't fantasising from\n\nscratch, for all we know Valenza could have been related to Theodora\n\nthrough her mother rather than as a Komnene.\n\n>\n\n>>Valenza might have\n\n>>originated from an Italian town with a similar name, such as\n\n>>Trebisacce in Calabria or Trebbia on the Ligurian coast.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> But this new hypothesis of Kursanski could not explain why the source call\n\n> her a daughter of Kaloiannès, or why Théodôra Komnènè recognized the\n\n> descendants of \"Balentza\" as her relatives.

Since this passage is in the narrative of\n\nZeno's travel, one can speculate that it comes from Zeno's own accounts, and\n\nso is more reliable than what Ramusio says in an other part of his vast\n\nwork, and which is more suspect to be his own assemblage from different\n\nsources.\n\n> I suspect Caterino Zeno had only reported that Theodora treated him\n\n> \"like\" a nephew, using a simile that Ramusio (like Douglas Richardson)\n\n> failed to distinguish from a statement of fact.\n\nIndeed, that is a possibility. Anyway, one can not trust a late 16th century\n\nsource which is so obviously in contradiction with chronology. That's a pity\n\nthat the original account of Zeno is lost. This Trapezuntan connection must\n\nbe considered as more than suspect, although it has probably some base in\n\nreality.\n\nPierre\n\n\"david hughes\" <hugh...@aol.com> a écrit dans le message de\n\nnews:484756c1.04051...@posting.google.com...\n\n<...>\n\n> 40.

There is\n\nabsolutely no source which says that Dèmètrios married a daughter of Alexios\n\nII, neither it is any source which can point to such a conclusion. That is\n\npure invention, simply. But this connection is not only unproven and without\n\nany documentary basis, it is also patently impossible. To be the mother of\n\nEirènè, who married Matthaios Kantakouzènos in 1341 and so was born at least\n\nbefore 1329 (and most probably earlier since she plays already a political\n\nrole in 1341), Dèmètrios' wife must be born at least before 1313, and more\n\nprobably ca 1305: she obviously CAN NOT be a daughter of Emperor Basileios\n\nand so a grand daughter of Alexios II, who was born in 1283! Moreover,\n\nAlexios married the daughter of Bekha Jaqeli in 1299 and that is this\n\nmarriage which is supposed to give the \"Seljukid Descent\". The genealogy\n\npresented here implies that Eirènè Palaiologina married Matthaios\n\nPalaiologos when her grandfather Basiléios would have been (if he had not\n\ndie the previous year), at the most, 40 years old! (And in fact he was\n\nprobably younger). So, her own mother would have been born from a child of,\n\nat the most, 12 years old... But that's obviously not an objection for Mr\n\nHughes, which doesn't care about dates, facts and this kind of trivialities.\n\nMoreover, here we have a new confusion: the hypothetical wife of Dèmètrios\n\nPalaiologos is confused with a real daughter of Emperor Basileios of\n\nTrebizond, a Théodôra Komnènè who married in 1358 with a Muslim prince. Of\n\ncourse, there is no basis for such identification, not likeliness that a\n\nMuslim prince would have taken a Trapezuntan princess of around 50 years as\n\nhis wife.\n\n<...>\n\n> [note: Demetrius [I], Despot of Mordea (d1385/1420), & wife Eirene\n\n> [dau of Constantine Hypselantes & Eirene [\"Palaiologina\"], dau of\n\n> Demetrius Palaeologus], were the parents of one son & three daus,\n\n> namely, [son] Andronicus, called the last \"Grand-Domestic\" of the\n\n> empire (d1453)\n\nAndronikos was a son of Théodôros Palaiologos Kantakouzènos (+ 1410) and not\n\nof Dèmètrios.

For the benefit of\n\neverybody, I ask you here again, for the third time, some simple questions,\n\nto which I hope you will consent to answer as clearly as you can. If you do\n\nso, then perhaps somebody will take your affirmations into consideration.\n\nOtherwise, they will appeared as what they are: pure fictions.\n\n1. You pretend that Dèmètrios Palaiologos married a granddaughter of Alexios\n\nII Komnènos of Trebizond, daughter of Emperor Basileios Komnènos. What is\n\nyour source or argument for that claim? By source, I intend a contemporary\n\ndocument, not the allegations of a modern author, whatever are the initials\n\nhe puts after his name or how \"impressive\" is his bibliography (a lengthy\n\nbibliography can contain nothing of substantial). By argument, I intend a\n\nlogical reasoning (yours or the one of a modern author) which comes to the\n\nconclusion that, view the existing evidences, there is reasons to believe,\n\nor at least there is a possibility that such woman existed and married as\n\nyou suggest she did.\n\n2. You assert that this wife, who you pretend to have been Dèmètrios' wife\n\n(see 1) was the mother of Dèmètrios' daughter, Eirènè. But Eirènè married in\n\n1341, and so must be born at least before 1329, certainly even earlier\n\n(rather around 1325). How can you handle that with the fact that Alexios II,\n\nwho you claim to have been her great grandfather, was born in 1283, and with\n\nthe fact he married the women you pretend to have been her great grandmother\n\nin 1299? That is a very simple question, so please give a very simple answer\n\nand don't elude again the problem by claiming that you have findthat in a\n\nbook written by somebody who has read an \"impressive\" bibliography.\n\n3. You pretend that the same woman who was Dèmètrios' wife was, at least 30\n\nif not 35 years latter, married to the Emir Ibrahim Haji. When did she come\n\nback to Trebizond, and how do you explain that this Muslim prince would have\n\nasked as wife a woman of 50 years or more rather than a younger princess?\n\nPierre"
