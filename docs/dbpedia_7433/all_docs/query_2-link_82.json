In this study, a comparative evaluation will be made with other finds of the 13th and 14th centuries in Anatolia. The paper will explore the geographical location and the political context of the find, describe its composition, compare it with published hoards and finds of similar content and provenance, and place it in its historical and economic setting. This presentation is also expected to contribute to the very few studies on the coins of the Empire of Trebizond. https://akmed.ku.edu.tr/en/events/akmed-numismatics-congress/"
