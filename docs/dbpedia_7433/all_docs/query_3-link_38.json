        "text": "George of Trebizond (1396–c. 1474) – Greek émigré; Byzantine scholar and polemist; translator of Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek works; and renowned teacher of rhetoric and Latin eloquence – was one of the most enigmatic and controversial humanists of the fifteenth century. In the intellectual history of Western culture, George of Trebizond is best known as one of the major protagonists of the Plato-Aristotle quarrel through his Comparatio philosophorum Aristotelis et Platonis (1458), a work written against Platonism and its revival at that time. In particular, George was a severe opponent of Gemistus Pletho and – consequently – his student, Cardinal Bessarion. His scholarly interests included rhetoric and logic; and his handbooks in these two disciplines (Rhetoricorum libri V and Isagoge dialectica) circulated widely in Europe."
