        "text": "I donât want to put anyone off, but I think that readers will miss some of the humour in The Towers of Trebizond if they donât have enough background knowledge. Let me try to explain, with the help of Wikipedia (lightly edited as usual to remove unnecessary links).\n\nDame Emilie Rose Macaulay, (1 August 1881 â 30 October 1958) was an English writer, most noted for her award-winning novel The Towers of Trebizond, about a small Anglo-Catholic group crossing Turkey by camel. The story is seen as a spiritual autobiography, reflecting her own changing and conflicting beliefs.\n\nWell, yes it is, but that description (apart from the camel) makes it sound earnest and boring. The truth is that most of the time Macaulay is poking fun at religion in general and at hers in particular. It is often laugh-out-loud funny, but as I can see from reviews at Goodreads not everyone gets the joke.\n\nSome will be put off by the beginning. It starts with her faux-naÃ¯ve narratorâs drollery about how her family navigated centuries of the fraught history of the church in England â and that relies on having some knowledge of British kings and queens and their hangers on and how they bumped each other off to suit the religious beliefs prevailing in their era; and on knowing something about church politics. Hilary Mantelâs Wolf Hall Trilogy would help with some but not all of this.\n\nI knew about enough about English church politics because I have read Trollopeâs Chronicles of Barsetshire (1855-1867)â¦\n\nâ¦ and I have also read Susan Howatchâs Starbridge series (1987-1994) which is a family saga that traces the history of the Church of Englandâ¦ but itâs also (more interestingly) about the same kind of ambitious shenanigans and scandals and human greed and theological argy-bargy that you find in Trollope. Both of these series are excellent reading, butâ¦ well, not a lot of people read the classics these days and my guess is that the appeal of the once best-selling Howatch series has faded. Itâs described by one reader at Goodreads as âlike romance novels for Anglicansâ where âthe narrative place of sex in a romance novel is taken by spiritual directionâ). Oh dear.\n\nAs for British history, my broad grasp of that was formed by reading H.E. Marshallâs Kings and Things (1937) which is a light-hearted romp through British history written for children, (see my review at Goodreads.) I also did British History at school (but though the philanthropists and reformers were interesting, it was mostly about roads and steam engines and rather boring, so I switched to Music Appreciation in Term 2). In English Lit we did Robert Boltâs A Man For All Seasons (1954), which is about the travails of St. Thomas More v. Henry VIII â who, thanks to the film industry, is well-known in popular culture for bumping off his wives, but I suspect less well-known for his persecution of religious malcontents.\n\nReaders of The Towers of Trebizond also need to know that Ataturk was the early C20th founding president of Turkey and a secular moderniser. (But, though Wikipedia scampers over it, probably because of zealous Turkish editing, he was also implicated in the genocide of the remnant Armenian population).\n\nYou donât really need to know where Trebizond is, but thanks to Carol, Sheâs So Novel at Goodreads, (who rated the book with 5-stars!) hereâs an old map of the region during the Byzantine Empire.\n\nOk, enough. You can see that I was reasonably well-armed for The Towers of Trebizond but I am not surprised that not everyone finds it such great reading. Some books have a time and a place and a readership that fades with time, and I think this, sadly, is one of them. I will be only too pleased to be wrong about this, but I will only recant if objectors are from generations younger than mine.\n\nThe three main characters are the narrator Laurie; her eccentric Aunt Dot (more formally known as Dorothea ffoulkes-Corbett); and a High Anglican clergyman called Father Hugh Chantry-Pigg. Laurie just wants to travel and is delighted by the proposal to visit Turkey, but the other two are on a mission. Literally. They want to convert The Turks to their (differing) versions of Christianity. On the trip, they meet up with travel writers David and Charles, and also a feminist doctor called Halide who (like Aunt Dot) is interested in the emancipation of rural Turkish women still under the veil despite Ataturk. Halide converted to Christianity while at university in Britain but has now fallen in love with a Muslim man. And she feels that she could not be a Moslem wife and bring up children to all that.\n\nThe jocular tone shifts then, to a sense of personal anguishâ¦\n\nI thought about how sad it was, all this progress and patriotism and marching on and conquering the realms of culture, yet love rising up to spoil all and hold one back, and what was the Christian Church and what was Islam against this that submerged the human race and always had? It had submerged Anthony and Cleopatra, and Abelard and Heloise, and Lancelot and Guinevere, and Paolo and Francesca, and Romeo and Juliet, and Charles Parnell and Faust, and Oscar Wilde and me, and Halide and her Moslem man, and countless millions more. It kept me outside the Church, and might drive Halide out of it, it was the great force, and drove like a hurricane, shattering everything in its way, no one had a chance against it, the only thing was to go with it, because it always won. (p.102)\n\nThe church from which Laura is estranged says that her long-standing affair with Vere, is a sin. Macaulay herself, as you might remember from my review of Lara Feigelâs The Love-charm of Bombs, Restless Lives in the Second World War (2013), had a long-term affair which ended in the death of her lover from cancer in 1942. Macaulay knew to her great cost, the grief and pain of being The Other Woman.\n\nLaura does not want to be saved from her sins, not for the time being, it would make things too difficult and too sad.\n\nI was getting into a stage when I was not quite sure what sin was, I was in a kind of fog, drifting about without clues, and this is liable to happen when you go on and on doing something, it makes a confused sort of twilight in which everything is blurred, and the next thing you know you might be stealing or anything, because right and wrong have become things you do not look at, you are afraid to, and it seems better to live in a blur. (p.150)\n\nI have often thought that it is a most strange thing that this important part of human life, the struggle that almost everyone has about good and evil, cannot now be talked of without embarrassment, unless of course one is in church. (p.151).\n\nI think itâs a distortion of the ethics that Macaulay is challenging in this book, to characterise it as âa spiritual autobiographyâ.\n\nMacaulay also satirises travel writing and the preoccupations of the Cold War. Her narrator is peeved that the enthusiasm for travel and writing travel books makes it difficult to find anywhere that hasnât already been written about, and I suspect that Charles (who plagiarises Davidâs writing after David comes to a sticky end) was probably based on someone she knew. (Macaulay was writing near the end of her long life, so she may have felt that, in fiction, she could deal with it and her part in making it known. Why not? It was blatant plagiarism.)\n\nThere are also the hilarious escapades of Aunt Dot and Father Chantry-Pigg, who disappear over the (tense) border to the USSR because Chantry-Pigg wants to convert some âfanaticsâ and Aunt Dot yearns to see the (Soviet) Armenian scenery. As an aside, Macaulay, dripping with sarcasm, mentions some travel writers who the Turks thought had a morbid interest in Armenia and shown too much sympathy for the recently massacred Armenians. It is beyond bizarre that in our own time Turkey has made it a crime to acknowledge the Armenian genocide; I will lose all of my wavering respect for the EU if ever they admit Turkey while this genocide remains unacknowledged. Macaulay has no hesitation in bringing it to her readersâ attention.\n\nThe narrator slyly notes the consulâs warning about the sensitivities of the imams towards Aunt Dotâs crass plans for proselytising (and her wilful disregard of local mores by bathing in the sea), but she writes that while Aunt Dot liked the consul and his wife who had been most kind and civil,â¦\n\nâ¦ she did not want to make trouble for them, [but] actually that is what consuls expect and are there for. (p.81)\n\nThroughout their travels in Turkey their group has been thought to be a group of spies and in the wake of Aunt Dot and Father Chantry-Piggâs disappearance, the newspapers go into overdrive. There is speculation that they have eloped, but also that they are in league with the real life British defectors Burgess and Maclean.\n\nI dined that night with Halide. We talked about aunt Dot and Father Chantry-Pigg, who were now, it seemed, news in three continents, on account of being spies. The continents were Europe, America and Asia-Minor.\n\nâThey have been seen,â said Halide. âEverywhere in Russia they have been seen. In the Caucasus, in Tiflis, in Siberia, in Stalingrad, in Moscow, in the Crimea. They have been seen in cafÃ©s with your Burgess and Maclean.â\n\nâWhat were they doing?â I asked, hoping that they had been having a good time.\n\nâHow should I know?â said Halide, who was not hoping this at all. âDrinking vodka, playing tric-trac, talking, telling secrets, spying. Then too, Father Pigg has been seen in churches, hob-nobbing with priests.â (p.209)\n\nIn their absence, Laurie goes back to England, taking with her the camel and an ape, which she teaches to play chess, to drive and to behave in church. I could quote the hilarious account of this âcivilisationâ of the ape, but I have written far too much already.\n\nAli at HeavenAli read and reviewed a beautiful first edition for the 1956 Club, and Simon at Stuck in a Book reviewed the NYRB reissue so the book is still easy to source."
