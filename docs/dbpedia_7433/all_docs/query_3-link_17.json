        "text": "I read that Mehmed II had claimed descent from John Tzelepes Komnenos. I read that after the siege of Neocaesarea he converted to Islam and married with Seljuk Sultan's, Mesud's daughter. He has made some alliances with Turkish Beys and had good relations with them and Turkish term \"Çelebi\" comes from his name. Does anyone knows how Mehmed II was related to him, is there a bloodline or some kind of alliance? Or is it part of a political plan to take the Roman Crown?\n\ni can not help to this research, as both parties , muslims and christians for different reasons perchaps did not found 'attractive' this, regardless if the story is true.\n\nBut i can clear this : in Roman empire/Byzantium the system does not respond to a specific dynasty, as in Ottoman state.\n\nAs also to the west, kings , emperors, became from aristocracy, in Roman empire/Byzantium even Fokas, a low-level officer in the Roman army (centurion) seized power after a mutiny in the ranks of the army, and became emperor. [ame=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocas]Phocas - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia[/ame]\n\nFrom the other the name of Komnenos was a very well known, and having a lot of recognition inside and outside of the Roman empire/Byzantium.\n\nThough Mehmed II did not need a story, as to the Roman empire/Byzantium system not needed this specific became.\n\nAs also he had exterminate alot of Roman/Byzantine elites, like Notaras and many Palaiologan princes, so he did not need a story for nagotiate or to show/excuse his power.\n\nIf someone read the speech of his father against Venetians of Thesaloniki, there Murad II said to Venetians, : this city belongs to me, as we have previous conquered and only the Romans could have rights to it , not you[Venetians], that means Ottomans recognise only the rights of Romans/Byzantines, and of themselves, so when Mehmed II took Constantinople, he did not needed any recognise with a story, ofcourse that does not mean that we know how the story that conects him with Comnenos is correct.\n\nAssuming that the story was real, Mehmed II should need to have more christian army [support] than muslim, but this would be a highest risk transformation, he never did, regardless if the story is true.\n\nOfcourse the Jianissaries foundation perchaps have a status and connected similar with the story, a previous christian subject become protects a previous christian leader, but this is just an hypothesis, in action he was a muslim ruler who flirts with the emperor axiom, but never became, even if he could.\n\nsorry because i did not help to clear this more, but i have not the origin refer of Mehmed II to this, which perchaps should help some.\n\n=====================================\n\nNotable Muslims of partial Greek descent (non-conversions)\n\nAhmed I - (1590–1617), Ottoman sultan, Greek mother Handan Sultan (originally named Helena (Eleni)) - wife of Ottoman Sultan Mehmed III\n\nAhmed III - (1673–1736), Ottoman sultan, Greek mother (Emetullah Rabia Gülnûş Sultan), originally named Evemia, who was the daughter of a Greek Cretan priest\n\nBayezid I - (1354–1403), Ottoman sultan, Greek mother (Gulcicek Hatun or Gülçiçek Hatun) wife of Murad I\n\nBayezid II - (1447–1512), Ottoman sultan, Greek mother (Amina Gul-Bahar or Gulbahār Khātun, tr:I.

The Sultan's claim of third Rome is strengthened by his connection to the Komnenid/Komnenos dynasty, even after this dynasty stopped ruling the Byzantine Empire they ruled the Empire of Trebizond which ended in Siege of Trebizond (1461)\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/ROct8lL\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ROct8lL.jpg\" title=\"Hosted by imgur.com\"/></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/9Q9KEd1\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/9Q9KEd1.jpg\" title=\"Hosted by imgur.com\"/></a>\n\nI'm not sure if my images will be uploaded but I will give a shot.\n\nI just had a problem there is TWO Suleiman (spelling may vary) anyway Osman I 's father is Ertu&#287;rul and his father is Suleyman Shah who is descended from John Tzelepes Komnenos, but in Wikipedia they claim he is descendant from Qutalmish a Seljuk. Here you can find out yourself.\n\n[ame=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_family_tree]Ottoman family tree - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia[/ame]\n\nClick on Suleyman Shah (they always call him Suleyman SHAH) and read his story\n\non another page open this\n\n[ame=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultanate_of_Rum]Sultanate of Rum - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia[/ame]\n\nand another page open this (Anatolian Seljuks are the rulers of the Sultanate of Rum)\n\n[ame=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_Seljuks_family_tree]Anatolian Seljuks family tree - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia[/ame]\n\nClick on Suleyman and read about him\n\nNow say with me WHAT THE ****. The new Suleyman sounds more \"credible\" while the other father of Ertu&#287;rul doesn't. I think it is a mistake on Wikipedia.\n\nTranslate this website http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioannes_Comnenus_(tzelepes)\n\nif you have Chrome it will take a second, anyway this one caught my eye written in Latin.\n\nFun Facts I learned:Sultan Muhammad's great grandfather Emperor Alexios triggered the first Crusade, the Seljuks's ancestor SELJUK SON TAQOQ was a commander in the Kingdom of Khazaria's army like his father, there is strong evidence that he was Jewish or Nestorian Christian especially naming his sons Israel, Moses, Michael and Yunus (Jonas). Khazarians are Turkic people who followed Judaism. Very Weird seeing non-Semitic people embrace Judaism, I need to read about them, after I'm done with this Seljuk.\n\nThe statement that Mehmed II claimed descent from the Komnenos dynasty may be based on Theodore Spandounes, On the Origin of the Ottoman Emperors translated and edited Donald M. Nichol (Cambridge, New York, 1997) page 11. Originally published in 1509.\n\n8 One unique claim about Mehmed II&#8217;s genealogy\n\nmerits mention: Spandugnino, a member of a noble Byzantine\n\nrefugee family that settled in Venice after the Ottoman conquest of\n\nConstantinople, wrote in his De la origine deli Imperatori Ottomani (1509)\n\nthat Mehmed II believed he was descended from Komnenian lineage.\n\nThe Komnenian dynasty was traditionally considered nobler\n\nthan the last Byzantine ruling family, the Palaeologoi, which was\n\noverthrown by Mehmed.19\n\nhttps://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/ottomanturkish/files/2011/01/LEGITIMIZING-THE-OTTOMAN-SULTANATE.pdf\n\n\"I do not think that either the editor of the Herald and Genealogist or the author of The Pursuivant of Arms, who have \"done so much toward placing the study of armorial antiquities (and of genealogy) on a rational basis\", would put any faith in the assumed descent of the Ottoman dynasty [as promulgated by the crafty Mahomet II, and obsequiously accepted by Turkish historians] from John Comnenus, nephew of the emperor John II (1118-1143 A.D.), who, on turning renegade, settled at Iconium, the then Turkish capital; and by his wife Camiro, daughter of the Sultan, left issue Soliman Shah, paternal grandfather of Othman, founder of the dynasty now reigning at Constantinople.\n\nI myself can only see a complete failure of the link between the supposititius son, Soliman, and the renegade father John Comnenus: chronology and the historical facts alike discredit it.\"\n\nNotes and Queries Fourth Series, Volume VIII, September 9, 1871, page 213.\n\nhttps://archive.org/stream/s4notesqueries08londuoft#page/212/mode/2up\n\nSince Ertugrul, father of Osman I and alleged son of Suleyman Shah, supposedly died about 1280, and since John Tzelepes Komnenos defected to the Turks and married the daughter of Sultan Mesud I in 1140, Ertugrul would have died about 139 years or less after his father Suleyman Shah would have been born according to that genealogy.\n\nIt is normal for men who live to old age to die about 95 or 100 years after their fathers are born. I myself have a relative who died 139 years after his father was born, and his grandfather in turn died 127 years after his father's birth.\n\nAnd King Casimir IV of Poland died in 1492, 130 to 140 years after his father King Wladyslaw II Jagiello was born about 1352 to 1362. King Wladyslaw II Jagiello died in 1434, about 138 years after his father Grand Duke Algirdas was born about 1296.\n\nSo it was possible for a medieval man to die 139 years or less after his father was born, but it would have been very unusual.\n\nSee also:\n\n\"The myth of the Byzantine Origins of the Osmanlis: an essay in interpretation\" Konstantinos Moustakas, Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies Volume 39, Issue 1, Janury 2015, pages 85-97.\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/byzantine-and-modern-greek-studies/article/div-classtitlethe-myth-of-the-byzantine-origins-of-the-osmanlis-an-essay-in-interpretationa-hreffn01-ref-typefn1adiv/EBECCED13457B3163D998AB798B34B65"
