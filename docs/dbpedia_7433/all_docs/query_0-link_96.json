        "text": "Within 250 years, a largely homogeneous, if engineered, Roman Empire that controls south of the Danube, up to Istria, across Anatolia and the Caucuses, bits of the Crimea, the Levant and Egypt - with the Egyptians being the most recognizable different culture.\n\nSome really interesting ideas in this post. Just a quick comment - you're suggesting the Laskarids would restore the Eastern Roman Empire as it was at 476AD?\n\nThis seems waaaay too optimistic. If the Byzantines couldn't even conquer central Anatolia in the 12th century, they were even less likely to do so in the 13th century with far less manpower, territory and resources available to them - let alone restore the whole of the ancient Eastern Roman Empire.\n\nThe Empire of Nicaea is a small Anatolian state whose territories don't extend that far inland from the Aegean. It is quite powerful and well organised compared to the nearby mini-states, but it certainly isn't anywhere near as powerful as the Mameluke Sultanate in Egypt, for example.\n\nRealistically, Nicaea could probably just about hold the territories it already had, as long as the Turks don't unify into a major power. With luck, it might retake a few cities and possibly secure itself as a power around the Aegean. But it was never going to retake the whole of Anatolia, let alone the entire Roman Empire. Absolute best-case scenario, in my opinion, is to rebuild the Byzantine Empire as it was immediately before 1204. That essentially means the Komnenian Empire, minus Bulgaria and Serbia.\n\nSome really interesting ideas in this post. Just a quick comment - you're suggesting the Laskarids would restore the Eastern Roman Empire as it was at 476AD?\n\nThis seems waaaay too optimistic.\n\nIt is militarily optimistic, yeah. This would probably rely on there being fragmentation in the Muslim world that is exploited for the second phase, and seriously exploiting the disunity of the Latin states, then the Turks as the Seljuks fall apart (butterflies permitting). Combined with a brutally pragmatic approach of displacing populations and colonizing, and racially controlling who fights who, exploiting old hatreds/new bigotries to the Empires advantage. I put my hands up there, but one of my main points for it is a direct social engineering program by the Romans - involving encouraging population growth. Most of the difficulty in expansion from my perspective is assimilating the conquests, and taking advantage of the resources.\n\nIdeally part of this is taking almost every fighting age male with a family and conscripting them, in exchange for their pay and a safe home for their families, who are relocated into the heart of the Empire, but scattered. 5+ years away from home, and their family has had to assimilate. Morally ambiguous, but unless I'm mistaken, it creates a loyal army. Might be worth taking some of the families with skills and relocating them for economic reasons, but you get my drift. Keep the families well looked after, but culturally isolated, and the armies stay flush with manpower, and loyal, with children that are being told about church with their new christian friends. Perhaps I'm bats**t, but, there you go.\n\nIf the Byzantines couldn't even conquer central Anatolia in the 12th century, they were even less likely to do so in the 13th century with far less manpower, territory and resources available to them - let alone restore the whole of the ancient Eastern Roman Empire.\n\nI take issue with this, because they did get the Turks on the plateaus to pay tribute and as vassal ~1161. It just wasn't a complete victory with assimilation, but rather overlordship. Not great, but not too bad, replace the tribute with soldiers and settlers(?). So the 12th century from my perspective did see a conquest, it just was squandered, and lead to Myriokephalon when the Seljuks wouldn't grant territory. If Manuel had focused on the Anatolian turks, and taken the Danishmends himself, establishing his strength around the Seljuks whilst they tried to centralise, then they'd have been able to hold the interior. At least, that is my opinion.\n\nThe Empire of Nicaea is a small Anatolian state whose territories don't extend that far inland from the Aegean. It is quite powerful and well organised compared to the nearby mini-states, but it certainly isn't anywhere near as powerful as the Mameluke Sultanate in Egypt, for example.\n\nRealistically, Nicaea could probably just about hold the territories it already had, as long as the Turks don't unify into a major power.

That essentially means the Komnenian Empire, minus Bulgaria and Serbia.\n\nWell, I disagree here, as stated above, nominally the Komenids did. With a victory in Greece, and in small battles with fragmented Emirs, then the Laskarids can too. That is the first 100 years. Perhaps a more realistic is 180 years, with another 180 to repeat in the Levant, Caucuses and Egypt, when they have a much larger pool of resources, crucially, the same pool of resources, especially in manpower and skills, that had been so successfully levied against them in the past.\n\nPlus, the Ottomans made those conquests, from a similar position, in ~250 years. Why not the Romans? (I'm counting this from Osman I to the conquest of Egypt)\n\nEDIT : I think I best add, I'm going with realistic, not likely/almost certain."
