        "text": "The Nicaean Empire was one of the three Byzantine successor states that emerged after the sack of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204. It was founded by Theodore I Laskaris, who established his capital at Nicaea (modern Iznik) in Asia Minor. The Nicaeans fought against the Latin Empire, which occupied Constantinople, and the other rival states of Epirus and Trebizond, for the restoration of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nThe Nicaean Empire reached its peak under John III Doukas Vatatzes, who ruled from 1222 to 1254. He expanded the Nicaean territory, reformed the administration and the army, promoted the economy and the culture, and supported the Orthodox Church. He was succeeded by his son Theodore II Laskaris, who died after a short reign of four years, leaving behind two sons: John IV and Constantine.\n\nJohn IV Doukas Laskaris was only eight years old when he became the emperor of Nicaea in 1258. He was under the regency of his father’s friend, George Mouzalon, who was unpopular among the aristocracy. A conspiracy led by Michael Palaiologos, a powerful and ambitious general, resulted in the assassination of Mouzalon and his brothers, and the elevation of Palaiologos as the co-emperor and guardian of John IV.\n\nPalaiologos soon proved to be a capable and ruthless ruler, who managed to defeat the invading Mongols, the Seljuk Turks, and the Epirotes. He also negotiated with the Latins and the Papacy, and secured the support of the Genoese fleet. In 1261, he sent his general Alexios Strategopoulos to reconquer Constantinople, which was achieved with a surprise attack. Palaiologos entered the city in triumph, and restored the Byzantine Empire after 57 years of Latin occupation.\n\nHowever, Palaiologos did not honor his promise to share the imperial power with John IV, who remained in Nicaea. Instead, he had him deposed and blinded, and declared his own son Andronikos II as his co-emperor. John IV was exiled to a monastery in Bithynia, where he died in 1305. He was the last emperor of the Nicaean Empire, which was absorbed by the Palaiologan Byzantine Empire. He was also the last emperor to be crowned by a patriarch in Nicaea, following the tradition of the first ecumenical council of 325.\n\nJohn IV Doukas Laskaris was a tragic figure in Byzantine history, who never had a chance to rule his own empire. He was a victim of the ambitions and intrigues of his co-emperor, who restored the Byzantine Empire at the expense of the Nicaean Empire. He was also a symbol of the Orthodox faith, which resisted the union with the Catholic Church that Palaiologos agreed to in order to secure his throne. He was venerated as a saint by the Orthodox Church, and his memory was preserved by the historians and chroniclers of his time."
