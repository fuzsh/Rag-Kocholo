        "text": "In earlier blogs we have seen how the ruling elites from aristocratic Byzantine Greek families managed to carve out chunks of the vast Byzantine Empire and establish their own imperial dynasties in the early 13th century. The three rump states of Trebizond, Nicaea and Epirus all came into being at the expense of the Latin Empire. Their action was a reaction to the Crusade leaders from Catholic Europe who had deposed the old regime in Constantinople (the Angelos dynasty) and proceeded to divvy up the imperial Byzantine lands among themselves and their financial backers. The latter, representing the political and commercial interests of Venice, a key player in the whole enterprise, did very well, netting three-eighths of the old empire‚Äôs strategic possessions including Crete) and innumerable war spoils from Byzantium. The crusader hierarchy elected from their leaders, Baldwin, Count of Flanders and Hainaut, as the first Latin emperor of Constantinople.\n\nNomenclature: the term ‚ÄúLatin Empire‚Äù was not contemporary to the period, and was only applied by historians in the 16th century to distinguish the Crusader feudal state from the classical Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire (both of which called itself ‚ÄúRoman‚Äù). The term ‚ÄúLatin‚Äù was chosen because the crusaders‚ÄîFranks, Venetians, and other Westerners‚Äîwere Roman Catholic and used Latin as their liturgical and scholarly language in contrast to the Eastern Orthodox locals who used Greek in both liturgy and common speech. The Byzantines referred to the Latin Empire as the Frankokratia (‚Äúrule of the Franks‚Äù) or the Latinokratia (‚Äúrule of the Latins‚Äù). The crusaders themselves in documents tended to use the expression ‚ÄúEmpire of Constantinople‚Äù or more commonly referred to the empire as ‚ÄúRomania‚Äù and themselves as ‚ÄúRomans‚Äù [Jacobi, David (1999), ‚ÄúThe Latin empire of Constantinople and the Frankish states in Greece‚Äù, in Abulafia, David (ed.), The New Cambridge Medieval History, Vol. V: c. 1198‚Äìc. 1300, (Cambridge University Press), pp. 525‚Äì542].\n\nAttempts by the Crusader state to expand its imperial boundaries was hampered by constant conflict with its neighbours, the Bulgarian Empire to the north and the three Byzantine successor states. Baldwin I didn‚Äôt last long as Latin emperor, his army was crushed by Tsar Kaloyan‚Äôs Bulgarian troops at the Battle of Adrianople, with Baldwin captured and dying in prison later in 1205. Latin fortunes improved for a while with his successor, Henry of Flanders (for competence, the pick of the Latin emperors by a wide margin), who won back most of the lost territory in Thrace and concluded a successful peace treaty with the Bulgarian enemies after marrying Kaloyan‚Äôs daughter.\n\nAfter Henry‚Äôs death there was a swift turnover of Latin regentsüÑ∞ and the Despotate of Epirus stepped up its campaign to wrest the Kingdom of Thessalonica from the Latin Empire, finally capturing it in 1224. The threat from Epirus receded however after the Epirotes were badly beaten by the Bulgarians under Tsar John Asen (Battle of Klokotnitsa, 1230)‚Ä¶around this time the burgeoning power of the Empire of Nicaea replaced Epirus as the principal Byzantine threat to the Latin state.\n\nThe Latin empire, now led by Baldwin II (known as Porphyrogenitus ‚Äì ‚Äúborn to the purple‚Äù), was economically diminished and reduced in area to little beyond the city of Constantinople itself. Baldwin spent much of his long reign as emperor scurrying round the courts of Western Europe cap-in-hand in a largely fruitless quest for aid for Constantinople‚Äôs impoverished state. Nicaea meanwhile was tightening the screws on Constantinople. In 1259 the Nicaeans defeated the Principality of Achaea, a vassal state of the Latin Empire (Battle of Pelagonia). The loss of Achaea, the strongest of the Frankish states in Greece, was a decisive blow for the Latins in the defence of their imperial capital.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to take Constantinople in 1260 the Niceans were ultimately successful in the endeavour the following year, without planning to do so. A small force of Nicaea on a scouting mission in the proximity of Constantinople‚Äôs walls fortuitously discovered that virtually the entire garrison and the Venetian fleet had temporarily vacated the city, leaving it defenceless. Seizing the opportunity the Nicaeans located an unguarded entry point and stormed the city, capturing it in the name of Nicaea‚Äôs emperor, Michael VIII Palaiologos. The Latins had lost, irrevocably, their Byzantine empire, with their remaining possessions reduced to a few enclaves in southern Greece, the title of emperor was nonetheless retained, in name only, by a succession of claimants up until 1383.\n\nComposition of the Latin Empire: The empire was a feudalistic polity, comprising numerous vassal states or fiefdoms, including the Duchy of Philippopolis (northern Thrace); Lemnos (island in the Aegean); the Kingdom of Thessalonica (Macedonia and Thessaly)üÑ±; the County of Salona (modern Amfissa in central Greece); the Marquisate of Bodonitsa (central Greece)üÑ≤; the Principality of Achaea (encompassing the Morea or Peloponnese peninsulaüÑ≥; the Duchy of Athens (encompassing Attica, Boeotia and parts of southern Thessaly); the Duchy of Naxos (or of the Archipelago) (encompassing most of the Cyclades islands); the Triarchy of Negroponte (island of Negroponte (modern Euboea); the Principality of Adrianople (modern Edirne, eastern Thrace)üÑ¥; the County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos (several Ionian islands)üÑµ. All of these entities and regions within the Byzantine world were ultimately absorbed by the Ottoman Empire.\n\nEncumbrances to empire: The Latin Empire was intended to recreate the Roman Empire in an eastern setting (Byzantium) with a Catholic monarchy, but as a political entity it only lasted a mere 57 years (cf. the preceding Byzantine Empire which, established by Constantine in 330 CE, was in its 874th year when Constantinople was sacked). The Latin Empire failed abjectly to establish itself as an enduring power, the seeds of which were present from the onset. The Crusade leaders started dividing up who gets what part of the Byzantine ‚Äúpie‚Äù before they had started the process of conquest in some of the regions (in fact the conquest of the former Byzantine imperial space was never completed). The approach to the whole task lacked cohesion. Moreover, the ‚Äúindividual expeditions undertaken by various Latin knights and commoners, as well as by the Venetian state, prevented systematic implementation of the partition plan‚Äù. The territories the Latins occcupied in the European part of ‚ÄúRomania‚Äú and the Aegean, as a consequence, became ‚Äúa mosaic of (mainly small) political entities‚Äù[David Jacoby, ‚ÄòAfter the fourth crusade: The Latin empire of constantinople and the Frankish states‚Äô, (Jan. 2009) DOI:10.1017/CHOL9780521832311.028 in The Cambridge History of the Byzantine Empire c.500‚Äì1492 (pp.759-778)]. These separate smaller ‚Äúprincipalities and regions were in principle dependent on the Latin emperor‚Äôs suzerainty ‚Äú but were in ‚Äúde facto (terms) practically independent entities‚Äù [Filip Van Tricht, The Latin Renovatio of Byzantium: The Empire of Constantinople (1204‚Äì1228) (2011)]. All of this worked against the task of making the empire centrally unified and coherent. Allied to this, Venice‚Äôs singular pursuit of its self-interest by its nature worked to the detriment of crusader goals. Another factor weighing down the Latin Empire was its economic decline, heavily in debt to the Venetians, Latin emperors were forced to resort to hocking their royal jewels to meet their costs. A succession of wars with the Bulgarian Empire and the Byzantine claimants proved costly. By the time of the last Latin emperor, Baldwin II, the population of the once-great metropolis Constantinople had plummeted alarmingly.\n\nüÑ∞ this period was the Latinokrakaria\n\nüÑ± Thessalonica‚Äôs short history as an quasi-independent entity was characterised by ongoing warfare, principally with the Bulgarian Empire before being conquered by Epirus (1224)\n\nüÑ≤ both Salona and Bodonitsa originally were vassal states of the Kingdom of Thessalonica\n\nüÑ≥ Achaea, the strongest of the Crusader states, exercising suzerainty over the Lordship of Argos and Nauplia. Achaea continued to prosper even after the eclipse of the Latin Empire. Its main rival was the Byzantine Despotate of the Morea which eventually succeeded in conquering the principality\n\nüÑ¥ the Principality of Adrianople committed itself to a course of fluidity in regard to the dominant powers venturing into its orbit, shifting allegiances readily from Constantinople to Epirus to Bulgaria to Nicaea during the 1220s for the quid pro qua of retaining its local autonomy [Filip Van Tricht, ‚ÄòThe Byzantino-Latin Principality of Adrianople and the Challenge of Feudalism (1204/6‚Äìca. 1227/28)‚Äô, www.core.ac.uk]\n\nüÑµ in addition to these both the Genoese and Venetians possessed colonies in the Greek islands and in mainland Greece at one time or other (Genoa: including Lesbos, Lemnos, Thasos, Samothrace, Ainos, Lordship of Chios and port of Phocaea; Venice: including Crete, Corfu, Lefkas, Tinos and Mykonos)\n\nThe turmoil and political upheaval in the wake of the sacking of Constantinople by crusaders in 1204 fragmented the unity of the vast Byzantine Empire into a patch-quilt of separate parts. Epirus¬´ùïí¬ª, a region which encompassed parts of modern Greece, Albania, Bulgaria and northern Macedonia, formed itself into one of these independent states, known by modern historiographic convention as the Despotate of Epirus‚ú¥Ô∏é. Its founder and first despot was Michael I Komnenos Doukas (a member of the deposed Byzantine imperial house of Angelos) with the state‚Äôs capital initially (and mainly) situated at √Årta in N.W. Greece. Michael‚Äôs reign saw some expansion by conquest into neighbouring Thessaly at the expense of the Lombard lords and for a brief time, control over the Lordship of Salona. Michael‚Äôs realm also became a refuge and centre of resistance for Greeks opposed to the intrusions of the Latin Crusaders [‚ÄòMichael I Komnenos Doukas‚Äô, Wikipedia, en.m.wikipedia.org].\n\n‚ú¥Ô∏é for accounts of the history of other Byzantine successor states see also the earlier articles on this site:Byzantine-Lite: The Empire of Trebizond under the Komnenos Dynasty andThe 13th Century Empire of Nicaea: An Empire in Exile and the Restoration of Imperial Byzantine\n\nEpirus imperial dreams ‚Äì the Empire of Thessalonica: The Epirote State rulers soon found themselves embroiled in conflict with several of the other regional players, namely the other successor states, the Bulgarians (their former allies) and the Latins (Franks, Italians, etc). Michael I was assassinated in 1218 and replaced by his half-brother, Theodore Doukas, who extended the ‚Äúempire‚Äù eastward, capturing Thessalonica from the Latins in 1224. Theodore duly established the ‚ÄúEmpire of Thessalonica‚Äù and had himself crowned as emperor.\n\nBattle of Klokotnitsa and aftermath: Theodore‚Äôs dream of ensconcing himself in Constantinople at the head of a greater Epirus-centred empire came crashing down at the Battle of Klokotnitsa in 1230. Theodore‚Äôs forces were attacked by both Bulgaria (under Tsar John Asen II) and the Nicene Empire (under John II Vatatzes) and comprehensively beaten. Theodore was captured, Bulgarian troops poured into Epirus and the despotate‚Äìcum‚Äìempire was reduced to vassal status vis-a-v√≠s the Bulgarians. With Theodore imprisoned for seven years, the Epirote imperial leadership passed to his brother Manuel Komnenos Doukas, under whose reign the downslide continued, much of the earlier conquests in Macedonia and Thrace were lost. Meanwhile, in Epirus, Michael II, illegitimate son of the founder of Epirus Michael I, assumed control of a diminished Epirus and was recognised as despot (1230‚Äìca.1267/1271). During Michael II‚Äôs rule the Epirote state was progressively reduced in size and power‚Ä¶in 1264 Michael was forced to recognise the suzerainty of Michael VIII Palaeologus whose rival successor state had ousted the Latins from Constantinople and restored the Byzantine Empire under the Nicene emperors.\n\nDeposed Theodore returns as king-maker: In 1237 Theodore returned to Thessaloniki and deposed Manuel and installed his son John as emperor of Thessalonica. However, under pressure from the Nicaean Empire John was forced to abdicate in 1242 in favour of John III Vatatzes, the Nicaean emperor. In 1246 Thessalonica was lost to Nicaea for keeps. Over in Epirus Michael II was succeeded by his son Nikephoros I whose sovereign power was challenged by Charles I of Anjou and Sicily with whom he eventually entered into an alliance (Nikephoros acknowledged himself as Charles‚Äô vassal). Later, Nikephoros allied himself with Charles‚Äô son and successor Charles II, which led to conflict with the Byzantines.\n\nEpirus‚Äô fragile autonomy: Thomas I followed the same perilous path as his father Nikephoros after succeeding him in ca. 1297. Thomas clung precariously to power as Epirus lunged from alliance to conflict with both the Angevins and the Byzantines. Ultimately, Thomas was assassinated by his Italian-Greek nephew Nicholas Orsini, Count of Cephalonia (Ionian islands) in 1318. Nicholas, in control of southern Epirus, conspired with the Republic of Venice to retake the north including the city of Ioannina but was unsuccessful. In 1323 he was in turn usurped by his brother John II Orsini. The pattern of instability persisted‚Ä¶Epirus lost its independence to the Byzantine Empire in 1338 before briefly winning it back (with the assistance of Catherine I, Latin empress), only to lose it yet again to Byzantium, all within the space of two years. In 1348 it was the turn of the Serbs under (King) Stefan Du≈°an who incorporated Epirus and Thessaly into the Serbian Empire. After the Serbs came the Albanians‚Ä¶in 1367 the Despotate of √Årta, an Albanian clan led by Pjet√´r Losha, attacked and besieged the Despotate of Epirus‚Äô capital Ioannina.\n\nNeapolitan ambitions for the Hellenes: √Årta as a mainly autonomous despotate and then lordship persisted until 1416 when the incumbent despot‚Äôs rule was terminated by another Italian incursion. Neapolitan count, Carlo I Tocco (hereditary count palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos) took Arta as part of a systematic territorial expansion in Greece¬´ùïì¬ª. Carlo reached the limit of his expansion in the 1420s when the Byzantine emperor John VIII Palaiologos‚Äô army cut short Carlo‚Äôs attempts to expand his influence into the Despotate of the Morea (the Peloponnese).\n\nEpirus, the final chapter: Under Carlo I‚Äôs successor, Carlo II, the Tocco dynasty lost Ioannina in 1430 to the encroaching Ottoman conquest of Byzantine lands, as well as almost all of their possessions in Eripus by ca.1448¬´ùïî¬ª. At this time the fate of Epirus and the other post-1204 successor states of the Byzantine Empire had been well and truly sealed by an ongoing preoccupation with civil wars, conflict between themselves and religious disputes to the neglect of the greater threat posed by their common enemy from Asia Minor¬´ùïï¬ª.\n\nEpirus, manoeuvring between east and west: Epirus, perched centrally between the east (Byzantium and Anatolia) and the west (western Europe), was in a special position, trying to carve its own niche in the region while competing for advantage and influence against the vested interests of more powerful players (namely Anjou, Venice, Sicily, Bulgaria, Serbia, Nicaea, Ottomans). The Epirote state‚Äôs despots through this era pursued two strategies for survival: it sought to protect its power base from its Latin enemies, while at the same time maintaining its independence from the rest of the Byzantine states. In a Byzantine world in which loyalty was a fluid commodity, Eripus found itself compelled by the power imbalances it faced to constantly swap its allegiances between the Latins and the Byzantines [Evangelos Zarkadas, ‚ÄòThe Despotate of Epirus: A Brief Overview‚Äô, Mapping Eastern Europe, Eds: M.A. Rossi and A.I. Sullivan (accessed October 14, 2023), http://mappingeasterneurope.princeton.edu].\n\nPostscript: Paucity of sources on Epirus Historians have long lamented the scarcity of surviving sources on Epirus, especially from the depostate itself. Probing this medieval Byzantine-Greek chapter has been hampered by an absence of historical narratives and biographies of the despots. The chronicles that do survive are those of Byzantine historians from Constantinople such as George Pachymeres (13‚Äì14th centuries) [Donald M Nichol, in Zarkadas].\n\n¬´ùïí¬ª or in the form some prefer, ‚ÄúEpiros‚Äù\n\n¬´ùïì¬ª adding it to Corinth and Megara captured by him earlier\n\n¬´ùïî¬ª Carlo II‚Äôs son Leonardo III ruled as the last Despotate of Eripus up to Epirus‚Äô ultimate coup d‚Äôgr√¢ce by the Ottoman Empire\n\n¬´ùïï¬ª the last remnant of Epirus, Vonitsa, fell to the advancing Ottomans in 1479\n\nAfter crusaders from the Fourth Crusade sacked Constantinople in 1204‚Äîinstead of attacking and subduing Egypt as the original plan was meant to be‚Äîthe vast Byzantine Empire splintered into four main, distinct entities, comprising a Latin successor state in the Balkans and Constantinople itself, and three Byzantine Greek rump states. One of these in north-eastern Anatolia became the small Empire of Trebizond, which I looked at in a recent blog (08-May-2024), ‚ÄòByzantine-Lite: The Empire of Trebizond under the Komnenos Dynasty‚Äô.\n\nThe largest and most powerful of the Greek successor states to emerge was Nicaea (then the name of a city-state in north-western Anatolia). Styling itself under the cognomen Empire of Nicaea, the dominant Laskaris family of nobles, proclaimed Theodore (I) Lakaris emperor (basileus) in 1205. The Laskarii staked a claim on the Byzantine throne as well but had plenty of competition, the other two Greek Byzantine successor states, Trebizond and (the Despotate of) Epirus, both advanced claims to be the rightful heirs to the Byzantine crown.\n\nProceeding by conquest, alliance and intermarriage: While Theodore I and his successors within the Lakaris dynasty were eyeing off Byzantium, the Nicene Empire had plenty of more immediate challenges to face. The territorial boundaries of the empire was surrounded by hostile states, so it had to deal constantly with multiple conflicts and crisis points. Ongoing wars were waged against the Latin Empireùï¨ (Henry of Flanders, Robert of Courtenay) to the north; against the Seljuk Turks of Iconium (Asia Minor); and against its rival successor states, Trebizond and Epirusùï≠. Aside from waging war Theodore deflected some of the threats to Nicaea by the stratagem of alliances and arranged royal marriages.\n\nLess Roman, more Hellenistic: Theodore‚Äôs successor as emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes (his son-in-law) continued the strategy, allying with Bulgaria against the Latins and to help neutralise any threats from EpirusùïÆ. John failed in a combined Nicaean-Bulgarian siege of Constantinople in 1235 but his reign did achieve military victories and diplomacy which resulted in an enlargement of Nicaea‚Äôs imperial territories‚Ä¶eg, Battle of Poemanenum, 1224, John decisively defeated the Latin army, giving Nicaea a foothold on the Balkans littoral; military campaigning against Epirus led to new Nicene gains in Macedonia and Thrace (Thessalonica fell to John in 1246). John‚Äôs successful rule also benefitted from his domestic policy, the economy was reformed, agriculture boomed, taxes were reduced and prosperity in Nicaea thrived. Emperor Theodore II, a man of letters, succeeeded John III, marking a cultural renaissance for the empire ‚Äì Hellenistic learning flourished with Nicaea forging a more distinctly overt Greek identity, throwing off the shadow of its Roman past. At the same time Theodore undertook a military restructuring, the creation of a formidable army of native Greek troops, ending the state‚Äôs reliance on foreign mercenaries [‚ÄòThe Rise of the Empire of Nicaea: How the Byzantines Reclaimed the Throne‚Äô, Timeless Treasure, (video, You Tube) Nov. 2023].\n\nPalaiologos‚Äô palace coup: Theodore II‚Äôs reign unfortunately was too brief, he died in 1258 after only four years at the helm, with the throne falling to his eight-year-old son, John IV, creating a situation ripe for instability and opportunism. The power vacuum was quickly filled by the grand constable (megas konostaulos) Michael Palaiologos who launched a coup, making himself co-emperor with John IV. Within a short period Michael had deposed the infant John (and had him blinded). Taking the throne as sole emperor (basileus), Michael VIII Palaiologos‚Äô dynastic line continued to rule the empire right up to the Ottoman takeover of Constantinople in 1453. Meantime, Michael consolidated his position and that of Nicaea by defeating the alliance of William of Villehardouin, Prince of Achaea and Michael II Komnenos Doukas of Epirus at the Battle of Pelagonia in 1259.\n\nCapturing Constantinople by accident: Pelagonia elevated Michael‚Äôs prestige at home, however with the stigma of the ‚Äúemperor-usurper‚Äù still figuring prominently in many Nicaean minds, for genuine legitimacy Michael needed to secure the ultimate goal, the prize of Constantinople [‚ÄòMichael VIII Palaiologos‚Äô, Wikipedia, http://en.m.wikipedia.org]. First attempts at conquest in 1260 saw Michael personally leading a failed siege attempted on the city. While Michael was doing a deal with the Republic of Genoa to secure naval support for a new assault on the Latin capital, the unexpected happened. Nicaean general, Alexios Strategopolous and a small force were on a reconnaissance mission which took them close to the city of Constantinople, when it stumbled on a virtually unguarded city/citadel (most of the Latin garrison and the naval fleet were away conducting a raid on the Nicene island of Daphnousia). Alexios seized the opportunity and his force surreptitiously found its way inside the fortified walls where it easily overcame feeble resistance. Baldwin II the Latin emperor, panicked and fled the city, leaving the Nicaeans in complete control of Constantinople.\n\nA hollow prize: Michael VIII by a stroke of good fortune had regained Byzantium for Nicaea, but the city and the empire was a shell of its former glory. Constantinople was in a very impoverished and diminished state, ravaged by war, most of its treasure either destroyed or shipped off to Western Europe (much of it ended up in Venice). Michael did what he could to fortify and strengthen the restored empire including a massive building project, but Constantinople as a trading port declined and Byzantium would never again hold the military and economic sway it commanded before the 1204 sacking by the Crusaders. After Charles I of Anjou triumphed over Manfred, king of Sicily (Battle of Benevento, 1266), Michael‚Äôs foreign policy became preoccupied with the rivalry with Charles. This proved a catastrophic blunder, long-term, as Michael withdrew troops from their posts in Asia Minor to bolster his army in confronting the Latins in the Aegean littoral, thus weakening his Anatolian defences against the burgeoning threat posed by the Seljuks to his east.\n\nByzantine post-Michael VIII, the inevitable decline and fall: After Emperor Michael‚Äôs death in 1282, his dynastic successors managed merely to squander the restored empire‚Äôs ‚Äúremaining resources in several bloody civil wars‚Äù [‚ÄòThe Accidental Reconquest of Constantinople‚Äô, Krystian Gajdzis, Medium, 28‚ÄìAug-2022, www.medium.com]. The cost of looking inward was ill-fated neglect of the growing menace of the tribe of Osman and their descendants‚Äô piecemeal capture of Byzantine cities across northern Anatolia, taking them inexorably closer and closer to Constantinople, something succeeding Byzantine emperors were increasingly powerless to prevent [Roger Crowley, 1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West, (2005)].\n\nùï¨ the Latins were regularly bankrolled by the affluent Republic of Venice\n\nùï≠ Nicaea got some respite from Seljuk border raids with the appearance of the all-conquering Mongol horde in Anatolia, forcing the Sultanate of Rum to focus its energies on repelling the Mongol advance\n\nùïÆ John continued the practice, marrying off his son (Theodore) to a Bulgarian princess\n\nWe all know of the great empires of history, the names roll off the tongue easily‚ÄîRoman, Byzantine, British, Spanish, Chinese, Mongol, Persian, Alexander the Great, Ottoman, etc‚Äîwe‚Äôve read the history texts at school and seen countless historically bastardised film interpretations, but what of the myriad of little and little known and often ephemeral (small ‚Äúe‚Äù) empires of the distant past? Not so familiar. I‚Äôve always marvelled at the idea of these lesser, obscure imperial entities and been intrigued by how they managed to exist (and persist) at all side by side with the aforementioned ‚Äúbig boys‚Äù, the powerful and by definition expansive empiresüÑ∞.\n\nByzantine‚Äôs successor states: Take for instance the Trapezuntine Empire, more commonly called the Empire of Trebizond‚Ä¶who outside of the learned medievalist has ever heard of it, let alone be confident of pinpointing its location on any world atlas? Time to fill in a few gaps in the general knowledge caper. Imperial Trebizond consisted mainly of several small portions of land in the region known as the Pontus on the southern shores of the Black SeaüÑ±. The ‚Äúempire‚Äù had its origins in the sack of Constantinople and dissolution of the Byzantine Empire by crusaders of the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Byzantine‚Äôs eclipse provided the opportunity for the creation of five new rump states from its existing territory ‚Äì what became the empires of Trebizond, Nicaea and Thessalonica and the despotates of Morea and Epirus.\n\nThis didn‚Äôt happen by osmosis, in the case of Trebizond the empire came about when the Komnenos brothers (Alexios and David), descended royally from Komnenian Byzantine emperors, seized Trebizond and the surrounding province of Chaldia with the military support of their formidible relative, Queen Tamar of Georgia. The elder brother had himself crowned emperor of Trebizond (Alexios I)üÑ≤. Emperor Alexios, styling himself Megas KomnenosüÑ≥, also laid claim to the Byzantine throne however the Trebizond rulers lost out to the more militarily accomplished Nicene Empire in that contest. Michael VIII Palaiologos of Nicaea became emperor of the restored Byzantine Empire (aka Latin Empire) in 1261 and the Palaiologan Dynasty ran the empire right up to Constantinople‚Äô fall to the Ottomans in 1453.\n\nA nominal ‚Äúempire‚Äù: Trebizond was something of an outlier when it comes to classic empire material‚Ä¶for a start, aside from acquiring Erzurum to its south in the early 14th century and the coastal enclave of Sinope in eastern AnatoliaüÑ¥, there was no expansive growth as we saw with ancient Rome and Great Britain, the Pontus-based ‚Äúempire‚Äù failed abjectly to expand its borders in any lasting way. Nor was it an empire with a conglomerate structure (or if you like, the necessary political configuration), ie, a situation where a dominant central power controls peripheral (outer) client states or colonies, Trebizond acquired no vassal states to speak of subordinate to its power [‚ÄúA Glossary of Political Economy Terms: Empire‚Äù, (Auburn University), www.auburn.edu/]. It lacked the military force to realise these goals by conquest. In short the Trapezuntine Empire was an empire in name onlyüÑµ.\n\nLast Greek empire standing: The only really stand-out achievement of the Trebizond Empire was its staying power. Despite its disadvantages ‚Äîpositioned within the sphere of influence of more powerful states such as the Seljuk Turks; the destabilising roles of Genoa and Venice; the decimation of the Black Death; the instability of civil war (which allowed the Genoese and Turks to further encroach territorially on a weakened Trebizond)‚Äîthe empire survived for so long, from its founding in 1204 to its ultimate conquest by the Ottomans under Sultan Mehmet II in 1461‚Äî257 years, 22 emperors (including two empresses)‚Äîeven outlasting the supposedly impregnable Constantinople which fell in 1453, as well as outliving the other Byzantine successor states in the regionüÑ∂. For this reason imperial Trebizond is sometimes called the last ‚ÄúGreek empire‚Äù.\n\nScholars point to a number of factors contributing to the empire‚Äôs surprising longevity. One is a favourable geographical location, the Pontiac Mountains behind Trebizond provide an advantageous natural barrier to invaders with designs on the mini-state. The capital city of Trebizond, built to resemble a kind of ‚Äúmini-Constantinople‚Äù complete with imitation Hagia Sophia church, was further protected by the erection of impressively strong walls and fortifications [‚ÄòTrebizond‚Äô, The Byzantine Legacy, www.thebyzantinelegacy.com].\n\nThe inestimable value of Mongol patronage and strategic alliances: But above all else what permitted Trezibond to continue to survive in such a turbulent world was its commercial importance, and what permitted its commerce to thrive was the expansion west and southwards of the all-conquering Mongol Empire. The Mongols‚Äô capture of Baghdad and the eclipse of the Abbasid Caliphate in 1258 resulted in the terminus of the lucrative Silk Road being diverted to Trebizond, making the city-state a funnel between east and west trade and enriching the small empire [Michael Goodyear, ‚ÄòEmpire of Trebizond‚Äô, 21-May-2019, World History Encyclopedia, www.worldhistory.org]. The other critical practice to preserve Trebizond‚Äôs independence was marriage diplomacy, of which the Komnenian rulers were very adept. Trebizond rulers formed alliances with rivals, defusing potential threats to the empire by arranging the marriage of many of its (beautiful) princesses to the Byzantine royalty and to Black Sheep and White Sheep Turkomen (nomadic Turkish confederations) (Goodyear).\n\nTrebizond continued to pay tribute to the Mongols as a vassal state which guaranteed its continued protection under the all-powerful Turco-Mongol warlord Tamerlane (or Timur), but once he departed the scene (beginning of the 15th century) and Mongol power waned, the Ottoman Turks re-emerged as the greatest danger to the tiny empire‚Äôs survival.\n\nEndgame for Megas Komnenos: The tipping point for the Ottomans to decisively move on Trebizond seems to be Emperor David Komnenos‚Äô intrigues with European powers with the purpose of launching a new crusade against the Ottoman Empire. Mehmet II laid seize to Trebizond in 1461 and after a concerted sea and land blockage, it compelled David, bereft of any sign of relief from his Christian allies, to surrender the citadel-city almost without a single sword needing to be drawn in anger. The fall of Trebizond, the final Greek outpost, as one historian noted, also extinguished the last vestiges of the Roman Empire, nearly 1,500 years after its beginnings [Donald M. Nicol, The Last Centuries of Byzantium, 1261‚Äì1453, (1993, 2nd edition].\n\nPostscript: Trebizond under the Ottomans became the modern city of Trabzon, which during WWI was captured by the Russians. Interestingly, following the war a proposition was made at the Paris Peace Conference for an independent Pontiac Greek state (the would-be ‚ÄúRepublic of Pontus‚Äù) including Trabzon and most of the post-Trebizond space. While the key figure at the talks US President Wilson supported its creation, the Greek prime minster didn‚Äôt, fearing the mini-state would be too vulnerable to withstand any Turkish attempt to absorb it, and the proposition was lost.\n\nüÑ∞ of course the reality was that most of them didn‚Äôt persist for long\n\nüÑ± plus several even smaller enclaves on the Crimean Peninsula\n\nüÑ≤ his brother, David, became commander of the state‚Äôs imperial army\n\nüÑ≥ Megas means ‚Äúgreat‚Äù or ‚Äúgrand‚Äù. After 1282 Komnenian emperors added basileus and autokrator to their list of royal titles\n\nüÑ¥ the Komnenos emperors managed to lose Sinope twice, the first time to the Nicene Empire and the second time for keeps, to the Sultanate of Rum\n\nüÑµ although it did meet some of the criteria for an empire, it had a flourishing commerce and wealth (mainly from its silver mines) and it possessed an entrenched ruling class\n\nüÑ∂ the fate of Theodoro (it‚Äôs Crimean enclaves) managed to be postponed even longer than that of Trebizond, they were not absorbed into the Ottoman Empire until 1475"
