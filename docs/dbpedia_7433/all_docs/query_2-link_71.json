Wear the badge proudly.\n\nI don't know of anyone else in my state that collects them and I've been looking since'83. The only one I knew of was and still is a dealer and he has stopped collecting what he sells. The price for fame and glory.\n\nI have attached two of my most recent acquisitions purchased at a local show for peanuts I'm proud to say...shame on me; I have confessed my many sins.\n\nThe Justin II half follis was struck by a military mint in Italy. I have just started investigating this very interesting series that a chap from Great Britain has written about and has collected for a long time.\n\nThe 1/2 tet is a beauty and for this series is about as good as one can get. I might have posted these earlier on a different thread, possibly the \"show me your newest acquisitions.\" Both were purchased for under $50. I would have paid more.\n\nSorry about the over sharpening of the images.\n\nHappy New Year to all.\n\nAttached Files:\n\nS 365 Justin II Military obv.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n914.1 KB\n\nViews:\n\n128\n\nS 365 Justin II Military rev.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n1.2 MB\n\nViews:\n\n142\n\ns 1980 Manuel I half tet obv.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n1,023.3 KB\n\nViews:\n\n161\n\ns 1980 Manuel I half tet rev.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n1.1 MB\n\nViews:\n\n123\n\nI purchased 2 Byzantine coins at the Winter Baltimore Whitman show. Both from Harlan J. Berk's \"junk pile\". One was a fairly easy to identify Maurice Tiberius. The other was a trachy, my first, and was incredibly hard to ID. I wouldn't have been able to do it without @Quant.Geek 's help. I am looking forward to hopefully adding some new ones in 2020."
