Plaid Cymru's values of peace, social equality, environmental sustainability, and socialism are reflected in its motto, 'Making a difference.'

Plaid Cymru's emblem, featuring a green 'triban' and Welsh dragon, was enhanced in 2006 with the addition of the Welsh Poppy as part of a rebranding effort

Plaid Cymru is distinct in its commitment to pacifism, opposing the UK's nuclear arsenal and military interventions

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Plaid Cymru demonstrated its focus on local welfare through initiatives such as supporting Welsh farmers and distributing food aid

Plaid Cymru proposes the creation of a nationalized healthcare service for Wales, separate from the UK's National Health Service

Plaid Cymru's central governing bodies include the National Executive Committee and the National Council, responsible for formulating strategies, managing finances, and overseeing membership
