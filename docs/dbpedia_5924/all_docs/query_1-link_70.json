        "text": "The Labour-run government in Wales was thrown into crisis on Friday after Plaid Cymru pulled out of a cooperation agreement with the party.\n\nThe Welsh nationalists said they had decided to go following the campaign finance scandal of Vaughan Gething, the recently elected First Minister.\n\nThey said they were also angry about a string of policy reversals, as well as Mr Gething’s decision to sack a minister for leaking.\n\nThe agreement was established following the Welsh assembly elections in 2021 in which Labour gained 30 out of the 60 seats, one below a majority.\n\nIt ensured that Plaid would vote with Labour on a series of policy areas to ensure a majority in the Senedd, and was due to last until December.\n\nWithout Plaid Cymru to support it, Labour finds itself as a minority administration in Cardiff Bay, which may prove troublesome when it seeks to pass new laws.\n\nMr Gething has already been in office for eight weeks - a week longer than Liz Truss managed as prime minister in 2022.\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth, the leader of Plaid, said he remained “deeply concerned” over a donation made to the First Minister’s leadership campaign and was worried about Mr Gething’s decision to sack Hannah Blythyn, his minister for social partnership, following the leak of a phone message to the media which she insisted she was not behind.\n\n“I am worried by the circumstances around the decision to sack a member of the Government this week relating to matters that should be in the public domain already,” he said.\n\nMr Gething said: “The cooperation agreement was about mature politics, working together on areas where we agree. While it was always a time-limited agreement, we are disappointed Plaid Cymru has decided to walk away from their opportunity to deliver for the people of Wales.”\n\nThe First Minister thanked Sian Gwenllian and Cefin Campbell, Plaid’s two designated members for the agreement.\n\n“By working together we have achieved a great deal, including free school meals for all pupils in primary schools, providing more free childcare, introducing a radical package of measures to create thriving local communities, helping people to live locally and addressing high numbers of second homes in many areas of Wales,” he said.\n\n“We will now look closely at how we can progress the outstanding co-operation agreement commitments, including the Welsh Language Education Bill and the White Paper on Right to Adequate Housing and Fair Rents.”\n\nOn Thursday, the First Minister said he had “no alternative” but to ask Ms Blythyn, Labour member for Delyn, to leave his government.\n\nShe insisted she was “clear and have been clear that I did not, nor have I ever leaked anything” and was “deeply shocked” at her dismissal.\n\nIt followed news reports which featured a message posted to a ministerial group chat in August 2020 by Mr Gething, stating that he was “deleting the messages in this group”.\n\nMr Gething previously told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry that lost WhatsApp messages were not deleted by him, but by the Welsh Parliament’s IT team during a security rebuild.\n\nSustained pressure\n\nThe Welsh Labour leader has come under sustained pressure in recent weeks, with repeated calls for an investigation into donations he received while running to be Welsh Labour leader.\n\nEarlier this month, he survived a Senedd vote calling for an independent inquiry into a donation from a company run by a man twice convicted for environmental offences.\n\nOn Thursday, the BBC reported that more than £31,600 from Mr Gething’s leadership campaign would go to the Labour Party.\n\nAndrew RT Davies, the Welsh Tory leader, told the broadcaster it is “odds on” there will be a no confidence vote in Mr Gething, following his turbulent time as First Minister since taking up the office on March 20.\n\nPlaid Cymru’s withdrawal from the co-operation agreement could lead it to move against him in such a vote, but Tory leader Mr Davies was not forgiving of the Welsh nationalist party either.\n\n“Together, Labour and Plaid have worked together to divert resources away from the people’s priorities and towards vanity projects like putting more Senedd Members in Cardiff Bay, and have been hand in glove on policies like the destructive sustainable farming scheme and 20mph.\n\n“This move from Plaid means nothing and the Welsh public won’t be fooled,” he said."
