        "meta_description": "Devolution has characterised Welsh political life for about a quarter of a century now. While it has undoubtedly embedded itself in Wales and been strengthened over time, Welsh society is nevertheless still wrestling with a series of entrenched problems, such as child poverty or high unemployment. To many, this is the sign that devolution is not working, and, to an increasing minority, that it can in fact never work. The latter are therefore calling for independence from the United Kingdom (where the gap between rich and poor is thought to be wider than it has been for a century) in an attempt to turn Wales around for good. The logic undergirding their criticisms and policy proposals, however, does not always seem unassailable. For example, they often hold up Ireland as an example although its economy is as liberalised as that of the UK, while their constant focus on London and the British state may well divert attention from far more worrying difficulties.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\n2However, despite the fact that the Senedd gained the power to write its own laws in twenty devolved areas in the early 2010s (see “From strength to strength” below), the UK Poverty 2022 report (published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in January 2022) makes grim reading for Wales:\n\n2 See p. 23 of the report.\n\nWales has the highest poverty rate among the four nations, with almost 1 in 4 (23%) people in poverty. This is driven by the relatively high proportions of working-age adults out of work (25%), working typically lower-paid ‘routine’ jobs (32% of in-work adults) or in receipt of Universal Credit or equivalent (legacy) benefits (20%).\n\n5Interestingly, however, questions arise out of the criticisms and platforms of all those who believe in Welsh independence. How united are these movements over the ends they advocate? How progressive can Wales become while remaining surrounded by avowedly pro-market countries (i.e. – in the event of Wales becoming independent – Ireland and the rest of the former UK)? Last but not least, what do the pro-independence narratives tell us from the point of view of the perception of the Wales-England relationship in the early 21st century?\n\nThe “Welsh Way”?\n\nFrom strength to strength\n\n6The Welsh Assembly (known as the “Senedd” since May 2020) started under a system of executive devolution (1999-2007), i.e. with power only over secondary legislation in specified areas (e.g. agriculture, education or housing). It then developed its powers in three phases:\n\n2007-11: the Assembly could now pass primary legislation over matters conferred within 20 fields of responsibility;\n\n2011-7: in the wake of a referendum in March 2011, the Assembly was given full law-making powers in the 20 areas already mentioned, while in 2014, further powers were transferred (e.g. devolution of stamp duty, business rates or the right to propose new taxes);\n\n5 Ibid., pp. 32-42.\n\n2017-20: following the passing of the Wales Act 2017, the Assembly could now make laws in any area, except those reserved to the UK Parliament (e.g. the Constitution, defence, foreign affairs or justice).\n\nA relatively poor record\n\n8The Report of the Independence Commission points towards serious structural problems:\n\n7 Towards an Independent Wales, op. cit., p. 83.\n\nFor all that it has bright spots, the Welsh economy has chronic structural weaknesses that have proved hard to overcome for a long time. They include industry structure, external ownership and management, low productivity, a missing middle of medium-sized companies, vulnerability to takeover, a low export propensity, and educational and skills shortcomings. All have combined with poor road, rail and telecommunications infrastructure to leave Wales among the poorest UK economic regions and stymied attempts to raise its relative position.\n\n13 Dan Evans, “Standardising Wales: Divergence and Convergence in Welsh Education Policy”, in Ibid., p (...)\n\nin literacy, numeracy and science, Welsh children have often scored the lowest in the UK over the last 15 years;\n\n14 Steffan Evans (who works at the Bevan Foundation, a non-political charity), “The Housing Crisis”, i (...)\n\nthe private rental sector in Wales doubled in size over the first two decades of the 21st century at the expense of the social rented sector. Consequently, there are now fewer social homes than there were forty years ago, due to the Right to Buy scheme introduced in the 1980s, while increasing the number of social homes has been a slow process;\n\n15 Hayward, op. cit., p. 257.\n\nbesides, in February 2021, the median waiting time for NHS hospital treatment was 24.5 weeks in Wales, but only 12.6 in England, with spending per head being slightly higher in the former.\n\n11And, to an array of intellectuals and activists alike, all these stumbling blocks seem to fit into a well-known pattern.\n\nNeoliberal Wales\n\n15Joe Healy (a specialist of social movements in Wales and beyond) has put it all in a nutshell: he sees the marketisation of higher education in Wales and casual employment contracts as evidence that:\n\n20 Joe Healy, “The Neoliberal University in Wales”, in Evans, Smith & Williams (eds), The Welsh Way, o (...)\n\n[T]he reluctance to take up any of these fights demonstrates complicity in the neoliberalisation of Welsh public institutions. Caught between alleged radicalism and deeply held unionism, the Welsh Government rocks the boat as gently as it possibly can, and in so doing flattens any possibility of an alternative.\n\nWales’s share of the blame\n\n16Bearing in mind what has been said about the strengthening of devolution over the 2000s and 2010s, the Welsh Government and Senedd themselves must of course bear at least part of the responsibility for some of the above-mentioned shortcomings.\n\n19But of course, there is more.\n\nThe major culprit\n\n21Typically, Towards an Independent Wales sees the UK economy as serving only the interests of (the City of) London and the south east of England, hence the long-standing imbalance from which they insist, Wales is suffering. One of the answers to the problem being:\n\n28 See pp. 85-6 & 185 of the report, and p. 92 for the quote.\n\n[r]eversing more than 40 years of a largely laissez-faire approach to regional policy that has seen financial services become the dominant sector supporting the UK economy and allowing other sectors to grow more quickly in future.\n\n22And the reporters have a point. As financial journalist Nicholas Shaxson, author of The Finance Curse: How Global Finance Is Making Us All Poorer (2018) has explained,\n\n29 By sucking the best-educated men and women out of other economic sectors, government, etc., by incr (...)\n\n30 Nicholas Shaxson, “The finance curse: how the outsized power of the City of London makes Britain po (...)\n\nTo argue that the City hurts Britain’s economy might seem crazy. But research increasingly shows that all the money swirling around our oversized financial sector may actually be making us collectively poorer. [] As Britain’s economy has steadily become re-engineered towards serving finance, other parts of the economy have struggled to survive in its shadow, like seedlings starved of light and water under the canopy of a giant, deep-rooted and invasive tree. […] Newly published research [...] by the University of Sheffield, [shows that] an oversized City of London has inflicted a cumulative £4.5tn hit on the British economy from 1995-2015. That is worth around two-and-a-half years’ economic output, or £170,000 per British household.\n\nGenerations of leaders from Margaret Thatcher to Tony Blair to Theresa May have believed that the City is the goose that lays Britain’s golden eggs, to be prioritised, pampered and protected.\n\n24Their fear, indeed, has always been that holding back the City would make it and the rest of the UK economy uncompetitive.\n\n26As their website makes clear,\n\n33 See https://www.yes.cymru/ -consulted 28 May 2023.\n\nYesCymru is a movement dedicated to the goal of an independent Wales. Only a Wales, with its own government and institutions, elected and created by the people of Wales can truly be trusted to govern in the best interests of its people.\n\nFor Wales, …\n\n… see Ireland\n\nThere are lessons to be learned from Ireland, formerly one of the most peripheral and poorest parts of the UK. It is now a confident, self-assured independent nation, one of the richest parts of these Isles, with a seat at the United Nations.\n\n32If truth be told, there are other plans afoot that sound even more radical.\n\n… see socialism\n\n46 See p. 5 for both quotes.\n\nMelin Drafod wants to see financial choices made by applying socialist and progressive values, in keeping with the various left-radical traditions that are deeply rooted in communities throughout the country. Central to our vision are these progressive principles, including common ownership, co-operation, workers’ control and fairness for all, as well as re-imagining our decision-making structures.\n\n37There is no denying that, on the face of it at least, those who believe in either a confederation of the British Isles, or full-blown independence (whether within the EU or not) have a strong case. Nevertheless, as we are now going to see, things, as always, are more complicated.\n\nProblems\n\nIreland?\n\n38It is a well-known fact that for rather a long time now Ireland’s economy has been open to the winds of the economic forces that have also been welcomed by successive UK governments, thereby becoming more liberalised and globalised, a situation that is nonetheless fully acknowledged by the authors of Towards an Independent Wales. On page 122, the report says that:\n\nThe Welsh-Irish relationship should go well beyond collaboration on specific economic and cultural projects. […] For us in Wales, Ireland serves as a model of a successful small nation, a significant player within the EU and on the world stage.\n\n39More specifically, as spelled out on page 124, two of the four “claws” of the “Celtic Tiger” (mid-1990s – late 2000s) seem to be particularly attractive: strong inward investment and pacts between the Government and the employers and trade unions.\n\n49 See Department of Entreprise, Trade and Employment (https://dbei.gov.ie/ga/A-nDeanaimid/Tradail-Inf (...)\n\nIreland’s ability to attract and retain FDI is the result of a number of factors and consistent policy-making by the Government over many decades. At the heart of this approach has been openness to global markets, competitive taxation rates, investment in education and membership of the European Union, a competitive, consistent and transparent corporate tax regime […].\n\nParadoxes\n\n53 See p. 95.\n\nHigher tax rates on corporates could cause capital flight. Lower taxes, while potentially reducing revenue, could, however, lead to the attraction of companies (as Ireland has successfully demonstrated).\n\n44This line of thinking, indeed, echoes that of M. Thatcher, T. Blair et altri, whose watchword precisely was, and has been, as we have seen in the first section above: competitiveness.\n\n[I]t should be recognised that there is a valid intellectual argument that the budget deficit should not receive undue prominence when evaluating the various opinions, while at the same time acknowledging that there is an alternative view that it is necessary to demonstrate the financial sustainability of an independent Wales to markets and international organisations [especially in the case of Wales intending to rejoin the EU].\n\n46But most of all, and stunningly too, it could be argued that the various strands of the Welsh independence movement seem to have misunderstood the basic nature of the current economic system. Each time, their focus is either on the UK (or England)-Wales opposition, as if the UK was sui generis, as if the rampant marketisation of everything (from the NHS to education) was specific to the UK.\n\nA system\n\n48Indeed, laissez-faire economics (at home) and free trade (abroad) are fundamentally the brainchildren of:\n\n59 Mattei, op. cit., Chapters 5 and 10.\n\neconomists from France, Italy, Sweden, Holland, Great Britain, etc., who met at two international conferences (in Brussels and Genoa) in the early 1920s, and were eventually instrumental in convincing governments (including that of the USA) that production for profit was to be given pride of place over production for use, an agenda to be achieved through privatisation, public spending cuts, and so on;\n\n60 Jones, op. cit., pp. 19-21.\n\nnearly forty historians, philosophers and economists (Friedrich Hayek prominent among them) from the USA, Britain, Austria, etc., who convened in a Swiss village overlooking Lake Geneva in April 1947 and founded the so-called Mont Pèlerin Society, in an attempt to safeguard what they saw as the “central values of civilization” through the promotion of private property and the competitive market in the West as a whole, where millions of workers were demanding wide-ranging social reforms instead.\n\n49Over the years, though a high proportion of its members still hailed from the English-speaking world, the Society became an international think-tank movement joined by politicians, academics and journalists from Italy, Uruguay, Spain, Australia, Germany, Sweden, the Czech Republic, and so on.\n\n50Ultimately, the internationalisation of this specific economic model is the reason why, characteristically, plenty of other countries have the same problems as the UK, e.g. France, with its endemic unemployment, its reduced public spending, its dwindling number of civil servants, etc.\n\n51One may of course argue that austerity in the UK is to be traced back instead to the decisions made by an English Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, from 1979. However, that would be only partially true. First, implementing austerity measures was a largely British affair, in the sense that Mrs Thatcher (who never won a majority of votes even in England) had two right-hand men in the persons of William Whitelaw, her very loyal, Edinburgh-born Deputy Prime Minister, and Port Talbot, Wales-born Geoffrey Howe, her very liberal Chancellor of the Exchequer (famous for having liberalised the economy, reduced inflation and abolished exchange controls, all key instruments in the liberal tool-box); secondly, while she took austerity to new heights, she never started it.\n\n52To prove the point, we need to go further back in time. The notion of a “post-war consensus” in Britain from 1945 to the 1970s was based on the idea of a coherent package of policies implemented by all Labour and Conservative governments. They were focused on a mixed economy, an acceptance of strong trade unions, and a broad welfare state. This situation was a consequence of the years of coalition government during World War 2 and upon the 1930s crisis during which there had been so much social deprivation.\n\n53But even then, the idea of a consensus did not necessarily command universal support. In the 1950s and early 1960s, some within the Conservative party expressed their reservations about it. Even within Labour, there was little agreement as to the logic and necessity of the consensus. Famously, The Future of Socialism, written in 1956 by Anthony Crosland (Labour MP and Foreign Secretary 1976-77), outlined the need for traditional socialism to adapt to modern circumstances.\n\n55Which leads me to my next considerations.\n\nHaunted by England and the colonial paradigm\n\nThe mother of all evils?\n\n56As already pointed out, in pro-independence rhetoric, Wales is casually understood as being a country subservient not to a system with world-wide ramifications, but rather to England/London. For example, in addition to already-mentioned declarations (e.g. by Melin Drafod members – see “For Wales, … see socialism” above), one comes across the colonial prism at least twice in The Welsh Way: Essays on Neoliberalism and Devolution.\n\n60More generally, Prof. Johnes is not convinced by the Fanon parallel:\n\n71 Ibid., p. 108.\n\n[It] is, ultimately, a speculative idea. But it does seem to take agency away from ordinary Welshmen and women. It suggests that the people who thought themselves British, who were happy to accept the political status quo and the assimilation of Wales, were somehow duped, experiencing what could be called a false consciousness. It certainly overlooks how for many of the Welsh, Britishness was not something imposed on them by the English […]. It was a real feeling and a national inheritance even.\n\n62Failing to see the marked and long-lasting permeability between Wales and England/the UK from the above perspectives blinds pro-independence activists and voters (including anti-capitalist ones) to certain basic current English (or otherwise) realities.\n\nOurselves alone?\n\n65Thus, at this stage, the question must inevitably become: why is it that those with a genuine left-wing agenda in Wales cannot see this, or, maybe, choose to ignore it?\n\n84 Hayward, op. cit., p. 244.\n\nThe process of transferring more power from Westminster has actually created a ‘little UK’ in Cymru. With Cardiff, we have a capital in the south-east of the country which is economically, culturally and politically dominant as it sucks in resources, talent and funding.\n\nConclusion"
