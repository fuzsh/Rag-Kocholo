        "text": "Who Can Vote?\n\nIn the UK, you can vote in a general election if you:\n\nAre 18 years old or older.\n\nAre a British citizen, a citizen of the Republic of Ireland, or a qualifying Commonwealth citizen.\n\nAre registered to vote.\n\nThe people who aren’t allowed to vote are those under 18 years old, people in prison, and members of the House of Lords.\n\nVoting Rights for 16-Year-Olds\n\nIn the UK, the general voting age is 18. However, there are some important exceptions:\n\nScottish Parliament\n\nThe Welsh Senedd\n\nLocal Elections\n\nIn Scotland and Wales, 16- and 17-year-olds are allowed to vote in elections for the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Senedd, as well as in local council elections. This means that young people in these parts of the UK have a say in many important decisions that affect their daily lives.\n\nThere are ongoing campaigns to lower the voting age to 16 for all elections across the UK. Supporters argue that young people are engaged, informed, and deserve a say in their future. The Green Party, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru all support lowering the voting age for all elections to 16.\n\nDevolved Powers\n\nWales has its own government, the Welsh Government, which has powers over certain areas like health, education, and local government. This government operates separately from the UK Government and is based in Cardiff. The Welsh Parliament, known as Senedd Cymru (the Senedd), provides the main democratic scrutiny of Welsh Government, including when passing new laws for Wales within devolved powers.\n\nKey Issues for Wales\n\nWales has specific issues that often come up in elections, such as:\n\nThe future of the Welsh language and culture.\n\nInvestment in infrastructure and public services.\n\nHealth services, particularly in rural areas.\n\nEconomic development and employment opportunities.\n\nThe Role of the Prime Minister\n\nThe Prime Minister is the head of the UK government. After a general election, the leader of the political party that can command a majority of votes amongst MPs elected to the House of Commons is invited by the monarch to become the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister leads the government and makes key decisions about running the country.\n\nPolitical Parties\n\nPolitical parties are groups of people who share similar ideas about how the country should be governed. Here are some of the parties in the UK that you may have heard of:\n\nThe Conservative Party\n\nThe Labour Party\n\nThe Liberal Democrats\n\nThe Scottish National Party (SNP)\n\nThe Green Party\n\nPlaid Cymru\n\nReform UK\n\nEach party creates a manifesto, which is a document outlining their plans and promises if they win the election.\n\nYou do not have to be a member of a political party to be a candidate in a constituency, but in practice most people who get elected are.\n\nPolicies That Affect Children\n\nPolitical parties often have specific policies aimed at improving the lives of children and young people. Here are some of the policies each party would look to implement that would affect the lives of children and young people:\n\nConservative Party:\n\nBanning the use of mobile phones during the school day.\n\nMandate two hours of PE every week in primary and secondary schools.\n\nEstablish clear age-limits on what children can be taught on Relationships, Sex and Health Education\n\nNational Service will be compulsory\n\nCreate more places in children’s homes\n\nConsult on introducing further parental controls over access to social media\n\nLabour Party:\n\nIntroduce a new offence of criminal exploitation of children, to go after the gangs who are luring young people into violence and crime\n\nIntroduce new legal safeguards around strip-searching children and young people\n\nBan vapes from being branded and advertised\n\nEvery young person caught in possession of a knife will be referred to a Youth Offending Team and will receive a mandatory plan to prevent reoffending, with penalties including curfews, tagging, and custody for the most serious cases\n\nEnsure schools address misogyny and teach young people about healthy relationships and consent\n\nEnsure that young people presenting to the NHS with gender dysphoria are receiving appropriate and high-quality care\n\nGive 16- and 17-year-olds the right to vote in all elections\n\nImprove careers advice in schools and colleges\n\nLiberal Democrats\n\nIntroducing an emergency scheme to guarantee access to free NHS dental check-ups for children\n\nOpening walk-in hubs for children and young people in every community to improve access to mental health services\n\nProviding supervised toothbrushing training for children in nurseries and schools\n\nIntroducing regulations to halt the dangerous use of vapes by children\n\nSupport children in kinship care and their family carers by introducing a statutory definition of kinship care and building on the existing pilot to develop a weekly allowance for all kinship carers\n\nMake care experience a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010 to strengthen the rights of people who are in or have been in care.\n\nGreen Party:\n\nReform of the UK’s counterproductive drug laws to allow the UK to move towards a legally regulated market that stops criminal supply and profiteering, and that reduces harm including by preventing children from accessing drugs\n\nCampaign for funding to allow community hubs and primary care to provide a roll-out of free dental nursing for children\n\nMore accessible and prompt mental health needs assessments for children and adolescents\n\nSchools to involve children in growing, preparing and cooking food, as part of the core curriculum, so that they recognise and understand how to use basic fresh produce\n\nChildren and young people are never strip-searched without an appropriate adult present, and only in very exceptional circumstances.\n\nFostered young people can choose to stay with foster parents until they are 21\n\nPlaid Cymru:\n\nIncrease child benefit by £20 per week for all children\n\nEnsure that all children have access to quality Welsh language teaching to enable them to achieve fluency through their school life\n\nIncrease the availability of degree apprenticeships in the healthcare sector to provide greater opportunities for young people to enter the profession and remain in Wales to work\n\nThe school curriculum should equip young people with an understanding of climate challenges and encourage a philosophy of engaging with climate change and the natural world.\n\nInvestigate a scheme for Young Peoples bus passes, encouraging them to get used to using public transport, wherever they are in Wales\n\nReform UK\n\nMake child grooming an aggravating offence.\n\nBan Transgender Ideology in Primary and Secondary Schools\n\nDouble the number of Pupil Referral Units (PRUs) to allow for permanent exclusions for violent and disruptive students\n\nPromote Child Friendly App Restricted Smartphones\n\nReopen High Intensity Training Camps for young offenders to tackle youth crime.\n\nThese are just a few short snippets from each of the above parties’ manifestos. It is also worth remembering that the parties may have views about devolved issues, so what they want to happen in the UK might not necessarily happen in Wales. If you’re interested in seeing what each political party has to say about your lives, and your future, all the manifestos are available to view online.\n\nThe Electoral System\n\nThe UK uses a system called First Past the Post. In this system, the candidate with the most votes in each constituency wins a seat in parliament. This system is simple but can sometimes lead to debates about fairness and representation. For example, a party may get a lot of votes, but not win the majority vote in their individual constituencies meaning that they are not represented in parliament.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnderstanding the general election is essential for anyone interested in how the UK is governed. It’s a fundamental part of democracy, allowing citizens to influence their leaders and the direction of the country. Whether you’re close to voting age or just curious, knowing how elections work helps you appreciate the importance of participation and informed decision-making.\n\nRemember, each vote is a voice in the future of the country. One day, you might be casting your vote or even running to become a Member of Parliament yourself! And for those in Wales, your vote is crucial in shaping the local and national future of Wales. So, get informed, stay engaged, and make your voice heard!"
