        "meta_description": "Ever since the result of the 2016 Brexit Referendum and the majority vote to leave the EU registered in Wales, commentators have been keen to offer an analysis of the result. One of the aftermaths, in the form of a loosely-structured, youth-driven movement in support of Welsh independence, caught many off their guard. Closer inspection, however, might suggest that satisfaction levels with devolution in Wales could well explain both events: that the Welsh ‘Leave’ vote was an expression of anger at the inability of the Welsh Assembly government to offset the worst effects of Tory-imposed austerity; and that, for those in favour of breaking away from Westminster, this very fact is proof that the devolution settlement is no longer in the best interests of the people of Wales. The present paper seeks to focus on the role of social media in the structuring of the Welsh independence movement. A brief overview of the main online sites and Twitter accounts will be given as well as the salient events that have taken place in Wales since 2016 in support of the independence movement. The paper will endeavour to examine questions of identity in a digital age, by investigating whether the nascent Welsh independence movement is reflective of an “imagined community” or whether, in the words of Charles Taylor, the “expressive individualism” inherent to the culture of social media can be seen as a way to find and live out a new Welsh identity that leaving the EU will inevitably trigger.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\n1For the past few years, the political scene in Wales has been reeling from the fallout of the 2016 Brexit referendum and, more recently, from the effects of the Covid pandemic. Precious truths have been learnt along the way from both events: firstly, that Brexit, seemingly a “done deal”, could have life-changing repercussions on the devolution settlement in Wales; and, that the devolved Senedd and its government have proven that they are more than able to manage the worst national health crisis of modern times.\n\n3Nowhere has this been discussed more effusively than in the echo chambers of social media. The frenetic activity around politics on social media in Wales has been incessant in recent years. And more precisely, the question of Welsh independence, that had so far been a niche in Welsh politics, has broken into new territory in terms of outreach and visibility.\n\n4This paper will therefore attempt to focus on how social media has fed the political debate in Wales since Brexit by examining the most salient elements of the debate though a series of questions: Who are the main players on the field? What have they contributed? Why is there such a flurry of activity and is this likely to continue? And, finally, how has social media generated a new framing of Welsh identity and political discourse in Wales, an analysis that will be greatly aided by the theories of Charles Taylor on expressivism and spaces of mutual display?\n\nThe sudden surge in interest in Welsh independence\n\n12So how has the question of Welsh independence been presented to the population of Wales? And more importantly, can the percentage of those in favour or against be measured? A Yougov poll of June 2017, shortly before Theresa May’s snap election, asked 1,000 Welsh voters their views on Welsh independence. Voters were asked to respond on a scale from 0-10 where 0 was strongly against, to 10 strongly in favour. The results were interesting: some one quarter of the electorate stated they were in favour (7-10), a little under a half against (0-3) and 27% in what one might term the “indycurious” bracket between 4 and 6. An average score of 3.8 emerged. When the results were broken down according to people’s party political vote, Plaid Cymru voters turned out to be the most positive about independence at 5.9, followed by Labour at 4.1, and the Conservatives, most hostile at 2.2.\n\nThe major players on Welsh social media\n\nhttps://twitter.com/​FieryWelshMemes 1 June 2020\n\nCalling all 16/17 Year olds of Wales! Today is officially the day you are recognised as voters to our Senedd! The next election is less than a year away! And were excited to see your turn out, here's a meme I've due this milestone of our Senedd's Democracy! - Iwan yr Olaf\n\n20Similarly, Hansh, a Welsh-language Youtube channel for young people developed by Welsh-language broadcaster S4C and whose videos receive up to 70,000 views on a regular basis, is very active both on Twitter and Facebook. The content is in Welsh, but a very relaxed, youth Welsh, in which authenticity of expression overrides questions of “correct” Welsh, one of the main reproaches that Welsh learners are confronted with and that many of them give as one of the reasons that put them off learning the language. There is also a conscious attempt to feature the youth of North and South Wales, often in playful banter between “Gogs” (north Walians) and “Hwntw” (south Walians): the regular video feature Bwrdd Twristiaeth Hansh (Hansh Tourist Board) in which young people all over Wales give a tongue-in-cheek tour of their home town or village, is one great way to give an all-encompassing Welsh identity to the youth of Wales. Whilst not endorsing a pro-independence platform, Hansh reflects what young people in Wales are debating, whether it be gender, BLM, mental health, violence against women or the environmental questions of the final of the Miss Wales contest! The mot d’ordre that transpires is that young people can achieve the same objectives since they have the same preoccupations as other youngsters in the UK, so that activism could very well be used to great effect in the promotion of a Wales in which these preoccupations are decided upon by young Welsh people.\n\n23Labour4IndyWales has had a Twitter account since 2017 and, as its name suggests, is made up of Welsh Labour members or supporters who are also in favour of Welsh independence. In a reaction to the CommRes opinion poll of March 2021, that showed that 39% of those polled support Welsh independence, Labour4IndyWales had this to say:\n\n25 See https://nation.cymru/news/poll-shows-highest-support-for-welsh-independence-ever-recorded/. Con (...)\n\nThe Labour Party has a duty to actively listen to this groundswell of popular opinion and to seriously consider how best we achieve a socialist Wales. Through engaging with the movement as it is, rather than how they imagine it to be, our party will find it has potentially more in common with the 39% than it may think.\n\n24The technical factors in play should also be recognized since they can explain the rise in interest in certain types of social media. Whereas on Twitter and Instagram, a person’s location plays no part in the algorithms determining the content that person is most likely to see, the same is not true of a relatively new player on the scene, namely TikTok. This recent social media channel is able to take the user’s specific location into account, to the point of even directing videos in which people with a certain regional accent interact. The following situation is the result:\n\n26 See “How TikTok Helped The Welsh Independence Movement”, March 23, 2021, http://www.styleofthecitym (...)\n\nWith TikTok, a distinct Welsh identity now exists online, with those in favour of Welsh Independence picked up by the algorithm’s location tracking and able to attract new people to the movement. Welsh TikTok creators tend not to post exclusively about Welsh Independence; and are primarily just visibly Welsh, occasionally creating Welsh-specific content. This increases a sense of solidarity and distinct culture independent from that of Britain as a whole, making the idea of an Independent Wales appear somewhat less intimidating. With this groundwork laid, some decide to publicly support YesCymru on the platform, as the algorithm picks this content up for Welsh users.\n\n28It is interesting to note that the peaks in mentions coincided with certain events making the news in the whole of the UK. The Dominic Cummings Bernard Castle incident provided a first flurry of activity in May 2020, followed by the Westminster vote on free school meals for children in England on October 21 – with the Conservative party voting against – to end in the highest peak of mentions on October 31st when UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak decided on generous furlough payments for England when a new lockdown was announced, although he had denied the same measure for Wales when a new lockdown was announced in Wales a few weeks earlier. This goes to show that paradoxically the Welsh Twittosphere shows an interest in the political decisions taken in Westminster applicable to England, when decision-making in those fields is devolved to Wales. The fact that YesCymru registers high social media activity at these times would seem to suggest that the Welsh Twitter accounts view Westminster decision-making as unfair to Wales, thus fuelling aspirations of independence. The Rishi Sunak episode resulted in 2,000 new YesCymru members over the 2 days following the more generous furlough provision for England.\n\n29So how has YesCymru impacted the Welsh political scene? Its use of digital media demonstrates a more tech-savvy, inclusive, apolitical approach to political activism. As mentioned previously, YesCymru’s local group network has enabled the organization to share national information, which has proved crucial in a time of lockdowns. Thirdly, the attractive iconography it produces is fast creating a collective Welsh identity on social media. Fourthly, its use of social media broadens the appeal of independence beyond the traditional political base. It is reaching out to young people, ethnic minorities and LGBTQ communities, something that traditional political parties are not always able to do. Finally, what more proof is there of YesCymru’s constant pressure on the Welsh political scene than to see the question of independence being debated in the Welsh Senedd for the first time on July 15, 2020?\n\n32For social media is nothing without expression. And its mantra is most definitely sentio, ergo sum.\n\n36 Ibid, p. 473. My italics.\n\n… the understanding of life which emerges with the Romantic expressionism of the late 18th century, [is] that each one of us has his/her own way of realizing our humanity, and that it is important to find and live out one’s own, as against surrendering to conformity with a model imposed on us from outside, by society, or the previous generation, or religious or political authority.\n\n34This would seem to apply aptly to most activity on social media, where most people are busy finding and living out their own humanity.\n\n35Taylor goes on to claim that the drive to realize one’s humanity can generate certain contradictions in self-expression, leading to a turn in social imaginary, thus causing trivialization. Once again, social media activity would seem to correspond to this observation.\n\n37It is tempting to see the use of social media by the movement for Welsh independence in this light: Twitter and TikTok provide spaces of mutual display, they are busy producing their own kind of synergy, but there is no real individual autonomy that could lead to any lasting adhesion to achieving a collective ideal.\n\nConclusion\n\n38Wales has for several generations produced movements of dissent and the subject of this article is merely the latest in a long line dedicated to instituting change for the Welsh. The channels by which various protest movements have expressed themselves may vary in their technology, but ultimately that expression throws up some common features. Like the Parliament for Wales campaign of the 1950s and the language protestors on Trefechan Bridge, Aberystwyth in 1963, the contemporary movement for Welsh independence, more especially its vociferous representations on social media, are nothing new in the Welsh sphere of dissent, something that might aptly be summed up in the words of T. Robin Chapman as he points out four common features to protest in Wales:\n\n38 Chapman T. Robin (editor), The Idiom of Dissent: Protest and Propaganda in Wales, Gomer, 2006, p. x\n\nThe first is that protest throws culture into relief: it challenges consensus and calls what was acceptable suddenly into question. It obliges culture to explain itself. Second, the discourse of protest, because of the context in which it inevitably occurs or the reaction which it inexorably provokes, is unnatural language for unnatural times; it is language in extremis, vulnerable, accusatorial, savage, simultaneously mannered and emotional. Third, protest takes a brass-rubbing of culture: it can make clear on paper what cannot always be seen clearly in the fabric of culture itself, by highlighting the raised letters on its surface. And fourth, protest itself makes cultural choices. When a protestor uses the discourse of health and sickness, encroachment, or battle, he or she does so, consciously or unconsciously, in the same way that a writer uses language. Protest is never just an act, in either sense of the word."
