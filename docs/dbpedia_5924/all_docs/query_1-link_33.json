        "text": "Kellas begins by making a distinction between ‘western’ and ‘eastern’ forms of nationalism. His ‘western’ form of nationalism is essentially the same as what we have referred to as ‘civic’ nationalism, an inclusive social movement with national ‘belonging’ based in citizenship. Both Plaid Cymru and Cymdeithas yr Iaith advocate this type of nationalism. ‘Civic’ nationalism can be contrasted with ethnic nationalism [Tip: hold Ctrl and click a link to open it in a new tab. (Hide tip)] , where ‘belonging’ is understood in terms of some form of common descent, which may be genetic or may simply mean a shared history. Cymuned is usually taken to advocate a form of ‘ethnic’ nationalism.\n\nAs with all typologies, there is often a degree of overlap between categories. For example, shared culture is important for both civic and ethnic nationalism but is treated differently by them. For Cymuned, the Welsh language is the defining characteristic of the Welsh nation, to the extent that if the Welsh-speaking communities were to disappear, so too would the Welsh people ‘cease to exist’, an outcome Cymuned regards as ‘ethnocide’ (Cymuned, 2003, p. 5). Cymuned has rejected charges of racism and welcomed in-migrants, ‘who learn Cymraeg [Welsh] and become part of the community ... from all nations (including England) and all races’, seeing them as ‘enriching a multi-racial Welsh-speaking society’ (Cymuned, 2003, p. 7). Nevertheless, there is an exclusivist element in the suggestion that only Welsh speakers can truly claim Welsh identity, and this underlies much of Plaid Cymru’s disavowal of the group’s position.\n\nIn the previous extract you saw that Kellas characterises Welsh nationalism as being a type of ‘national secession’ movement, an inclusive movement in that ‘the existing citizens of a territory were acceptable as members of the nation’ (Kellas, 1991, p. 73) and one example of many such movements that have arisen within a liberal democratic tradition. However, other types of nationalism – and in particular what Kellas calls ‘integral nationalism’ – have different characteristics: illiberal; autocratic; intolerant; racist. Thus, Welsh nationalists have had to face accusations from political opponents of ‘narrow nationalism’, and even ‘racism’ and ‘fascism’, which largely stem from a failure to acknowledge the very broad range of movements coming under the nationalist label.\n\nWe now turn to an examination of some aspects of Plaid Cymru’s political philosophy and policies in order to characterise more fully the nationalist movement in Wales.\n\nNationalism and internationalism\n\nWelsh nationalism was a product of the radical politics and socialist ideals that developed in Wales during the early decades of the twentieth century. The political importance of Welsh identity was an integral part of this context – Keir Hardie, the first independent Labour member of parliament from Wales, was a supporter of Welsh national identity and campaigned for Welsh home rule. In the years just prior to the First World War, several prominent members of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) tried to create a separate Welsh ILP, and although unsuccessful, continued to advocate a union of nationalist and decentralist socialist ideals (Davies, 1983). Some of them would become members of the Welsh Nationalist Party after its establishment in 1925.\n\nThe distinctiveness of the Welsh Nationalist Party lay in its emphasis on the Welsh language and culture, and in its independence from any British political party. But the party could not be accused of being ‘narrow nationalist’ in outlook. At the first of their annual summer schools in 1926, party president Saunders Lewis addressed directly the issue of nationalism versus internationalism. In his lecture entitled ‘Egwyddorion Cenedlaetholdeb’ he maintained that ‘the thing that destroyed the civilization of Wales and ruined Welsh culture, that brought about the dire plight of Wales today, was – nationalism’ (Lewis, 1975, p. 5). His argument was that the concept of nationalism that arose during the period of European state formation was materialist and based entirely on force. He advocated that Welsh nationalism should be inspired by an earlier principle, when an acceptance of an international authority, that of the Christian Church, across Europe was combined with respect for a diversity of cultures. Lewis then proceeded to argue that the recently established League of Nations was ‘an attempt to loosen the hard chains of material nationalism’ (Lewis, 1975, p. 9) and advocated that one of the conditions of Welsh self-government be a seat in the League of Nations."
