        "text": "Greetings!\n\nD-day 80\n\nThis week was particularly poignant as we paid tribute to our brave soldiers who paid the ultimate sacrifice during the D-day landings in 1944. It has been 80 years since this history-making event and is the most likely the last opportunity the soldiers who took part in the operation will attend such an event. We will remember them!\n\nGeneral Election 2024\n\nThis week saw the high-profile parties publish their manifestos with promises to the electorate on the economy, environment, education, crime and foreign policy. Grant Shapps MP has already conceded the Conservatives will lose with Labour possibly getting a ‘supermajority’, which is bad for democracy and decision making. Both Plaid Cymru and the Greens have published their manifestos, Independents will tailor their own manifestos for the seats they are standing in. However, one thing we as Independents have in common is that we are free of party ideology and able to think for ourselves! Please do get in touch with your party or the Independent Network if you would like further help and support with any aspect of your campaign.\n\nStanding as a candidate\n\nWe have a staggering number of candidates from our group, more than ever before! Five hundred and twenty Independents, including 27 Yorkshire Independents, Green party candidates in every seat, UK reform and more. Thank you to everyone for getting in touch with the office and letting us know if you are standing. If you have not already done so, please get in contact as soon as possible so we can keep our records up-to-date and know where support is needed. The Democracy Club has published candidates, polling stations and maps, which you may find useful. The LGA White Paper is the cross-party call for better local services which makes a useful resource for you in interviews.\n\nBe a Councillor Programme 2024-25\n\nWe held an information session last Friday promoting our flagship ‘Be a Councillor’ programme, aimed at attracting individuals interested in standing for public office. Once again, the LGA Independent Group has been allocated funds from the Government to promote the initiative. I am very grateful to our lead member peers who will be supporting the Group office in promoting the campaign within their regions, alongside some of our larger support networks. We know abuse and intimidation can play a factor in not running for election, but this programme will reassure individuals that support is available and becoming a councillor is one of the best jobs you’ll ever do!\n\nLaunch of the Local Government White Paper\n\nThis week saw the official launch of our local government white paper, which I encourage you to read and sets out the demands from local government to national government for a better relationship through our five main priorities to drive change.\n\nThese include:\n\nAn equal, respectful partnership between local and national government\n\nSufficient and sustainable funding\n\nBacking local government as place leaders\n\nA new focus on prevention and services for the wider community\n\nInnovation and freedom from bureaucracy\n\nThe paper also reveals a funding gap of a hefty £6.2 billion faced by councils in England over the next two years and calls on all parties to commit to ‘significantly increased funding in the next Spending Review. We need multi-year funding settlements and reform of the local government finance system’. Already 51 per cent of councils have warned they are likely to issue a section 114 notice in the next five years, and 9 per cent have said they are likely to issue one within the next financial year according to the Local Government Information Unit. The LGA continues to warn as well of the record amounts councils are spending on temporary accommodation from their core budgets.\n\nPlease do take a read of this detailed and informative document which will inform and hopefully influence, the next government about what is most needed from our local authorities.\n\nLGA General Assembly\n\nAs you already know with the General Election being called, the LGA Annual Conference has been postponed. We will confirm a new date as soon as possible. The shorter version of the LGA Annual Assembly will still be taking place online from 11.45am on Tuesday 2 July. The agenda for the meeting will be available two weeks before the meeting. All member authorities will now have been invited to appoint their representatives to the General Assembly for 2024/25.\n\nLGA National new councillors welcome event\n\nA new date has now been confirmed for new councillors, Tuesday 16 July from 5.00pm to 7.00pm online. If you are a new councillor, please attend this information session which will introduce you to the LGA and the ongoing support it can give you. The Independent Group will be holding its own session immediately afterwards for new Independent, Green and Plaid Cymru Councillors to meet and network online.\n\nCouncillors Hub\n\nThere is a dedicated page on our LGA website ‘Councillors Hub’ which hosts a range of useful resources to help you in your role and also various training sessions covering every aspect of being a local Councillor.\n\nAnd finally, we will be announcing dates for our very popular “Next Generation” leadership course shortly opening up applications, running over three weekends this winter.. Stay tuned!\n\nHave a great weekend everyone!\n\nNews from the LGA\n\nPlanning Leadership Essentials\n\nThe Planning Advisory Service (PAS) are delivering one of our LGA Leadership Essentials councillor training residential sessions at Warwick Conferences on 20 and 21 July 2024 which will help councillors who are chairs of planning committee understand the key characteristics of a good committee and develop their skills as a chair.
