        "text": "On a sunny afternoon in Cardiff Bay, Leanne Wood is railing against artificial flowers. “I don’t even like sitting at pub tables with them,” she says. Her aversion comes not out of snobbery, nor did she chance upon some in her dressing room backstage at last week’s ITV leaders’ debates. No; the reason for her distaste is because they remind her of how, having left school at 16, she spent a summer working long hours in a sweltering artificial flower factory with a plastic corrugated roof. “The fumes from the glue gave me constant headaches,” she says. “But you know how it is. I just wanted to move out of my parents’ house, so I got a job.”\n\nIt was short-lived. Surrounded by women whose only respite consisted of legally mandated 15-minute breaks whenever it got too hot, she quickly went back to school and then to university in Pontypridd, where she revived an interest in leftwing politics that had been born amid the deprivation of post-industrial Rhondda. And now she’s the leader of Plaid Cymru.\n\nWhen we meet, Wood, who is Plaid’s first female leader, is riding high from her success at the televised debate, which saw her party catapulted on to a UK-wide media stage for arguably the first time since its founders, Saunders Lewis, Lewis Valentine and DJ Williams, were tried at the Old Bailey for setting fire to an RAF bombing school at Penyberth in 1936. As a Welsh person, you become used to a distinct lack of prominent coverage of the country’s politics in the British media, particularly when it comes to Plaid, so it was bemusing to suddenly witness a raft of “Who is Leanne Wood?” features in the newspapers. More heartening still was her widely praised dressing-down of Nigel Farage over his comments about so-called “health tourists” with HIV.\n\n“This kind of scaremongering is dangerous. It’s dangerous, it divides communities and it creates stigma to people who are ill, and I think you ought to be ashamed of yourself,” she told him, prompting the first applause of the evening. When she reflects on Farage’s remarks now, she seems to relish the chance they gave her to nail her colours to the mast. “Like many people, you hear things that he and others with those kind of politics come out with, and normally you just have to shout at the television or the radio”, she says. “So to be in the position to be able to directly challenge that kind of debate, I felt like it was an opportunity I couldn’t miss really, and I’m very glad that I took it and that there was somebody there to call him out on such a prejudicial position.”\n\nThe response to her performance has been positive, not just because of the Farage moment, but because of what’s been perceived as her refreshing stance on other issues, such as tuition fees and the health service. “Feedback that I have had following the debate has been staggering,” she says. “People [have been] coming up and sending messages from England wishing they had a party like Plaid Cymru to vote for in England.” She’s just visited Beaumaris in North Wales, and was touched to have been approached on the street by people saying that they were voting for Plaid Cymru for the first time. “There was also a bus full of pensioners from the Midlands who wanted to have pictures taken, so it was quite surreal.” She laughs, then becomes suddenly passionate: “It tells me that people are interested in a different type of politics, and that’s what’s most encouraging.”\n\nI notice this oscillation between policy talk and passionate politics a lot when speaking with Wood. One moment she’ll be in full campaign mode, telling you with firm conviction that parity with Scotland is needed, meaning an extra £1.2bn would go into the Welsh block grant (she’s playing a long game, insisting that “people need to have a sense that our economic position is improving” before there can be a discussion about full independence), and the next there’ll be a hint of anger or sadness in her voice. “I’ve always been motivated by a sense of injustice,” she says at one point, “and that continues to this day. I just see so much, and I hope I can make a contribution to ending some of it.”\n\nBorn in 1971 in the Rhondda, Wood says her politics were shaped by the tight-knit community she grew up in. “It gives you a certain set of values that are around co-operation and concern for your neighbours,” she says. She is very much a collectivist in the way she speaks, too – at one point I ask her whether she’s up to the task of leading a more influential Plaid, and she replies from the perspective of the party, not herself. She still lives in the village of Penygraig with her partner, on the same street as her parents, because she wanted her 10-year-old daughter, Cerys, to grow up valuing the same cherished community whose deprivation she witnessed during the miners’ strike.\n\n“It had a profound effect on me, to be honest. When you live through a historical period, you don’t realise it, but looking back now, I can see that. My father was made redundant. He wasn’t working in the mining industry, but he was working in a builder’s supply yard. The disposable income of people just disappeared. Lots of businesses closed and lots of people lost their jobs, and there was nothing to replace the jobs.”\n\nThough her old school is much changed now, at the time she found being on free school meals difficult. “We had to stand in a separate queue to the other children and hold a pink ticket visibly, so the stigma attached to ‘those over there, the poor kids’ was a problem,” she says. I tell her that at my school we had to go to a different canteen. “That’s terrible. What were they thinking?”\n\nShe has always been interested in politics, first CND, then joining Plaid aged 20, after falling in with a crowd of supporters at university, and ruling Labour out on account of the “rightwing, reactionary” views on display in the party in the Rhondda. Does she mean sexist attitudes? “Sexist, homophobic – just generally old-fashioned dinosaur politics, which in my view had no place in my life.”\n\nIt’s one of several points during the interview at which it occurs me that you wouldn’t want to mess with her. Her answers are peppered with declamatory statements: “I have no truck with that position”; “I have no time for that”. She refers to the men in the leaders’ debate as “the four shades of Westminster grey,” adding that a four-way debate would have been boring, and looks noticeably unimpressed when I ask how Plaid can claim to represent Wales when it is the country’s third party: “We are designed as a party to speak for Wales. That is our raison d’être, so I make no apology for making that claim.” On this she is firm. On the question of whether she’d rather go for a drink with Cameron or Farage, she is even more so: “Neither, thanks,” she shoots back, drily, before bursting out laughing. She met the male leaders for the first time backstage at the debate, but only briefly.\n\nShe may meet them more often in future. And now that, in the event of a hung parliament, Plaid could end up shaping politics on a UK level, I wonder where Wood’s red line is. She insists that she’s “had no dealings with Labour” (although she is in regular contact with Nicola Sturgeon and Natalie Bennett), but such is Plaid’s anti-austerity platform that you wonder how they could ever work together. “I don’t want to talk in terms of red lines, because to go into talks in terms of where you won’t negotiate is generally not helpful,” she says. “We have a number of priorities, and they include ending austerity, rebalancing power and wealth, and bringing an end to this Conservative government, which is pursuing these cuts for ideological reasons.\n\n“But I can’t see a situation whereby we would go into coalition government with Labour, particularly if they weren’t willing to reconsider their position on austerity and on matters like Trident replacement.” Indeed, Wood’s views on Trident were well-established when she was arrested in 2007 for blockading Faslane naval base in Scotland, and, though she says she wouldn’t do it now that she’s party leader, “my position on Trident is as it was”.\n\nIt’s clear from speaking with Wood that hers is a different kind of nationalism from that with which Plaid has been traditionally associated, and it’s been going that way for some time. She won’t really be drawn on whether the focus on the Welsh language has hampered Plaid’s success in the Valleys (“Certainly the Welsh language has been used as a stick to beat Plaid Cymru with by our opponents, in a very dangerous way, actually, and an irresponsible way. I don’t think that’s acceptable”), nor on anti-English sentiment within the party. She is adamant that it doesn’t exist, while I am privately convinced that it still does in some places. I’m thinking particularly of the “Go Home You English Twat” graffiti I used to pass on the bus to school every day. Does vehemence like that die out in a generation?\n\nFrom reading the party’s manifesto , in which Welsh language policy doesn’t appear until page 52, it’s clear that Plaid is less focused on cultural nationalism than it is on economics, job creation, community wellbeing and social equality. “I’ve been really clear about our project being a civic-based project for everybody who lives in Wales. All people have a stake here, if they live here, and nationality, identity – those kinds of questions – they’re not really important from a political perspective.”\n\nIt’s difficult to explain how much of a departure those words constitute when you have grown up in a Welsh-language community, as I have, though that’s not to say that they are not welcome. Does it matter, I wonder, that Wood is not a native Welsh speaker? She is the first leader in the party’s history not to be, though she is learning the language.\n\n“I don’t think it does [matter], really. It matters to me because I feel like I miss out on things” – she speaks ruefully of the literature she feels she cannot yet appreciate – “but in terms of building Wales, my attitude towards the Welsh language is that the decline needs to be reversed and we need to grow it, and I think that the political position you take is more important, actually, than whether or not you can speak fluently.”\n\nI would find it difficult to argue. She knows her party’s manifesto inside-out, and at moments like this her convictions seem as solid as month-old Bara Brith – something I hadn’t anticipated when, before the interview, we were having a friendly chat about my recent trip to Cuba. “Did you get one of those red Che T-shirts?” she asks. “Be careful with those. The red runs out in the wash.”\n\nShe has always questioned authority, and continues to be ambivalent towards Westminster politics. During a Radio 4 profile of Wood last week, Don Cox described the experience of being interviewed as a candidate by “a young woman with a punk haircut who asked me very seriously that I wouldn’t sell out like all the other politicians”. I pose this same question to her now, and she laughs. “Minds can be changed over time and positions can change, but I’ve got certain political positions that I have held steadfast on since I was a teenager. And if I’ve managed to keep hold of those until now, I can’t imagine getting to the end of my life without them.”\n\nFor instance? “Things like … the idea of equality, the idea that people should have equal opportunities for all jobs, the idea that the hereditary principle shouldn’t apply … ”\n\n“Mrs Windsor?” I interject, thinking of the time in 2003 when Wood was ejected from the assembly chamber in 2003 for this reference to the Queen. “And the aristocracy.”\n\nWill she stay true to her radical beginnings if Plaid gains more power and visibility? I have a feeling that she will. After all, not all red comes out in the wash."
