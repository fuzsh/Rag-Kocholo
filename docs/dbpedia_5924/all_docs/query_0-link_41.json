        "text": "The United Kingdom is heading to the polls on July 4 after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced snap elections on May 22.\n\nParties vying for the 650 seats in the House of Commons, the lower house of the UK Parliament, have all released manifestos detailing where they stand on issues including the economy, the National Health Service (NHS), immigration and the UK’s relationship with the European Union.\n\nThe last general election in the UK was in December 2019 when Boris Johnson led the ruling Conservative Party back to power. After Sunak’s announcement, parliament was dissolved on May 30 and the country entered a period known as “purdah”, during which time civil servants and local governments must refrain from making any announcements about new initiatives or plans that might be seen as advantageous for one particular political party. Purdah does not restrict political candidates from canvassing for votes, however.\n\nThese are the main political parties – and the promises they are making – in the lead-up to the general election:\n\nConservatives\n\nAlso known as the Conservative and Unionist Party or, informally, the Tories or Tory Party\n\nPolitical alignment: centre-right to right\n\nFormed in: 1834\n\nManifesto: Reduce borrowing and debt, cut taxes by 17.2 billion pounds ($22bn) annually by 2029-2030.

Bring railway, water and energy companies under state control. Increase the NHS budget. Cancel Trident, the UK’s nuclear deterrent programme. Help migrants “put down roots” and end minimum income requirement for spouses of work visa holders. Rejoin the EU. Stop all new fossil fuel extraction, and rely on wind and solar power. Scrap university undergraduate fees\n\nCurrent leaders: Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay\n\nSeats in House of Commons in outgoing parliament: one\n\nSupport in latest polls: 7 percent — a historic high.
