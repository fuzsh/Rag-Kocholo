        "text": "Anwen Elias looks at the Independent Commission on the Constitutional Future of Wales, exploring what comes next and the wider lessons for debate about constitutional change.\n\nOn 18 January 2024, the Independent Commission on the Constitutional Future of Wales published its final report on different options for the governance of Wales. Whether the report will lead to changes in the Welsh devolution settlement depends on securing agreement from the UK government and other devolved administrations. But there are also broader lessons to be learnt from the Commission’s work: it provides a model for having a different kind of debate about constitutional change.\n\nWelsh devolution under pressure\n\nThe Commission was established by the Welsh Labour government (with the support of Plaid Cymru through their Co-operation Agreement) in November 2021, with two objectives:\n\nto consider and develop options for fundamental reform of the constitutional structures of the UK; and\n\nto consider and develop all progressive options to strengthen Welsh democracy and deliver improvements for the people of Wales.\n\nThe Commission was established in a context where there was felt to be unprecedented pressures on the operation of Welsh devolution. Intergovernmental relations between central and devolved governments had long been problematic, but these became increasingly strained during the Brexit negotiations and the Covid pandemic. Brexit had also shown the willingness of the UK government to legislate in areas of devolved competencies without the agreement of devolved institutions – contrary to convention.\n\nA different kind of debate about Wales’s constitutional future\n\nWales has a history of convening commissions to explore reform of the devolved settlement. This one was different in two respects, reflecting a desire to have a different kind of debate about how Wales is governed.\n\nFirstly, its 11 members included representatives nominated by the four political parties represented in the Senedd (Welsh Labour, Welsh Conservatives, Plaid Cymru and Welsh liberal Democrats). These worked alongside experts from academia, civil society, the media and civil service. These parties have very different ideological positions on constitutional questions, so it’s significant that the Commission’s eventual conclusions were unanimous. This was by no means guaranteed.\n\nSecondly, the Commission was tasked with having a ‘national conversation’ that included citizens from across Wales. This was achieved through a mix of approaches, including an online consultation, deliberative citizens panels in different parts of Wales, a Community Engagement Fund to reach people who wouldn’t typically contribute to public consultations, pop-up events, and representative surveys across Wales and the UK.\n\nOver two years, almost 10,000 people engaged in person with the commission’s work, with a further 15,000 sharing their views through online platforms. The Commission’s findings draw on these views, alongside evidence received from political parties and civil servants, academic experts, think tanks and civil society organisations.\n\nOptions for governing Wales in the long and short-term\n\nThe Commission’s final report sets out three different constitutional options for Wales in the long term: enhanced devolution, Wales as part of a federal UK, and an independent Wales. Each one is found to be viable.\n\nHowever, when evaluated against different criteria – principles of good governance, how they would be implemented, and their implications for policy-making – each option presents different opportunities and challenges. Some options perform better against some of the criteria than others, and there are trade-offs between the different criteria. It’s ultimately for the people of Wales to decide – on the basis of these strengths and weaknesses – what constitutional option they prefer.\n\nThe Commission also makes specific recommendations for more immediate changes to protect Welsh devolution from the pressures set out to above. There’s a call to legislate to strengthen intergovernmental relations, and to require the UK government to gain the consent of the devolved institutions for any changes to their powers.\n\nOther recommendations focus on improving the efficiency and value-for-money of decision-making in Wales. They include improving budgetary flexibility, giving Wales a stronger voice in the areas of broadcasting and energy policy, and devolving responsibility to Wales for rail infrastructure, and justice and policing.\n\nFinally, there are recommendations about strengthening democracy in Wales. Reforms to the Senedd’s size and electoral system that are currently being considered should – if implemented – be properly reviewed, and new capacity for democratic innovations should be created.\n\nWhat next for Wales’s constitutional future?\n\nThe Welsh government has accepted the Commission’s conclusions, and has committed to implementing the recommendations for strengthening Welsh democracy. But other recommendations can only be delivered with the agreement of the UK government and the other devolved administrations.\n\nA lot depends on which political party is in government in Westminster after the UK general election. The UK Conservative Party considers constitutional reform to be a distraction from more immediate policy challenges.\n\nThere has been a similarly unenthusiastic response from the UK Labour Party. Within days of the publication of its final report, Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens rejected the call for justice and policing to be fully devolved to Wales, arguing that her party would be focusing on ‘the things that matter’ at the next general election. There has been little said about the other recommendations for protecting Welsh devolution.\n\nThis sets up a clear challenge for Welsh Labour’s new leader, Vaughan Gething. The Welsh government are already working on plans for devolving justice and policing; if Labour wins the general election he’s going to have to lobby hard to change minds and deliver this.\n\nThere’s also a more fundamental challenge: convincing his UK Labour colleagues that constitutional issues are not separate from (and therefore less important than) other policy priorities. Take the Commission’s call to devolve rail infrastructure: the case is made that this could provide Wales with a significant lever for achieving wider objectives including economic growth; improving access to education, employment and services; and tackling climate change.\n\nThe constitutional future of the UK: lessons from Wales?\n\nThe Commission’s work has modelled a different way of talking about constitutional issues. It has demonstrated that citizens care about how they’re governed and want to have their say. It has also shown that it’s possible to have an inclusive and constructive debate, underpinned by rigorous evidence-gathering and objective analysis.\n\nThere are lessons, therefore, for the wider UK in how to have a different kind of conversation about its constitutional future."
