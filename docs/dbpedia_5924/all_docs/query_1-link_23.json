        "text": "As set out in last year’s joint paper, since the start of the Co-operation Agreement in December 2021, there has been regular and constructive engagement between the Minister for Finance and Local Government (MFLG) and the Lead Designated Member. This has continued throughout the past year with 4 formal Co-operation Agreement Finance Committees held between March 2023 and February 2024, covering Draft, Final and Supplementary Budgets and associated issues such as the in-year savings exercise. In addition to these, there have also been 12 bilateral meetings between the MFLG and Lead Designated Member in this period, including regular briefings associated with UK government fiscal events.\n\nOverall, the Welsh Government’s budget is worth £1.3 billion less in real terms than when it was set in 2021. This has made the 2024-2025 Budget the hardest one since devolution, forcing Welsh Ministers to make very difficult choices.\n\nAt the Draft Budget, the approach taken resulted in allocations in areas where the Welsh Government recognises that Plaid Cymru has an interest, including:\n\nMaintaining the Housing Support Grant\n\nProtecting Basic Payment Scheme payment levels for 2024-2025\n\nConfirming additional funding for local government (Revenue Support Grant).\n\nThis engagement represents the Welsh Government’s commitment to consultation and collaboration with Plaid Cymru throughout the development and scrutiny of all stages of the annual budget process. As set out in the Co-operation Agreement mechanisms, on the basis that this commitment results in appropriate funding for the shared policy programme and influence on other budgetary matters, Plaid Cymru agrees to facilitate the passing of Annual and Supplementary Budgets for the duration of this Agreement. The relevant section of the mechanisms document is at Annex A.\n\nIn preparation for the 2024-2025 Final Budget, ministers and the Lead Designated Member have reached agreement on the areas below:\n\nAn allocation of up to £20 million will be made to the Climate Change MEG for the purpose of progressing housing proposals in 2024-2025. This will continue to support additional social housing to help tackle homelessness, and the associated indirect costs including poorer health, employment and educational outcomes. Work to consider affordability of housing in areas affected by second homes is also underway locally and this allocation will help develop and fund preferred local approaches, building on work to explore local mortgages and Help to Stay.\n\nThe Community Asset Loan Fund is a £5 million fund operated by the Wales Council for Voluntary Action (WCVA) on behalf of the Welsh Government. It provides loans of up to £300,000 to help community and voluntary sector organisations to purchase or improve community assets, including buildings and green spaces. The Fund can offer loans to incorporated third sector organisations including Community Benefit Societies and other social enterprises for a period of up to 25 years.\n\nThe fund is currently oversubscribed, with clear demand for additional funding. It has been agreed that this Fund will be expanded by an additional £5 million of FTC in 2023-2024.\n\nThe Co-operation Agreement was underpinned by a 3-year budget cycle with funding allocations agreed for specific commitments. Some aspects of the Agreement will continue to be delivered beyond the conclusion of the 2024-2025 financial year.\n\nDuring Budget discussions it was agreed that allocations for Building Safety, Ynni Cymru and the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol and National Centre for Learning Welsh will be reprofiled beyond the term of the Agreement as a pragmatic approach to manage the in-year position.\n\nMinisters will prioritise these allocations within their 2025-2026 MEGs. This will be set out in settlement letters from the Minister for Finance and a written update provided to the Leader of Plaid Cymru to confirm the allocation is being upheld. Any re-prioritisation of these allocations will need to be discussed for agreement with Plaid Cymru. A further note updating the Leader of Plaid Cymru on the spend will be shared before the end of the 2025-2026 financial year.\n\nThis agreement is between the Welsh Government and Plaid Cymru and has been agreed by ministers, ensuring that it will remain unaffected by any subsequent changes in ministerial portfolios.\n\nThe Co-operation Agreement signed on 1 December 2021 included the following paragraphs on the budget in the mechanisms document:\n\nThe Co-operation Agreement will be resourced as agreed and oversight of the delivery and budget allocations for it will be jointly monitored through a Finance Committee whose membership shall include the Welsh Minister responsible for Finance and the relevant Plaid Cymru designated member. The frequency of the meetings shall be determined but they will be regularly convened in the period leading up the Senedd’s annual Budget procedures, and any discussions on supplementary budgets and on end of year underspends / adjustments.\n\nA three-year budget cycle underpins this Agreement. Any additional resources would be jointly identified and considered on a year-by-year basis by Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Government around the issues in the Co-operation Agreement.\n\nThe Welsh Government commits to consultation and collaboration with Plaid Cymru throughout the development and scrutiny of all stages of the annual budget process.\n\nOn the basis that the above commitment will result in appropriate funding for the shared policy programme and influence on other budgetary matters, Plaid Cymru agrees to facilitate the passing of Annual and Supplementary Budgets for the duration of this agreement.\n\nThe Welsh Government has well established procedures for monitoring and reporting the use of funds allocated through the budget process. These procedures will apply equally to funds allocated under this agreement. The responsibilities of the Permanent Secretary as Principal Accounting Officer will continue to extend to the entirety of Welsh Government expenditure."
