        "text": "Pledges and promises come in thick and fast from every party during an election campaign - but it can feel like an overload of information.\n\nIf you've struggled to keep up with who is saying what or you're still undecided, here is a summary of where the main parties stand on major issues.\n\nFor a more in-depth look at what each party has pledged, scour our manifesto checker.\n\nTax\n\nConservatives - They have promised to knock another 2p off national insurance, so by 2027 workers would pay 6% of their earnings between £12,570 and £50,270.\n\nThe party says its ambition is to get rid of national insurance completely, which they have pledged to do for self-employed workers by the end of the next parliament.\n\nThey have also promised a \"triple lock plus\" for pensioners, meaning they would raise the tax-free pension allowance every year, so pensioners do not end up having to pay income tax on their state pension.\n\nLabour - It has pledged not to raise taxes \"for working people\", with no increase in the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, national insurance, or VAT.\n\nIt will cap corporation tax at the current level of 25%. This is the main tax paid by businesses on profits - it was raised by the Conservatives from 19% to 25% in April 2023 after the party had steadily cut it down from 28% in 2010.\n\nLiberal Democrats - It plans to reform capital gains tax, increasing the tax-free allowance, introducing three rates of tax and making the rate you pay based solely on your captial gains, rather than gains plus income.\n\nIt also wants to reverse the Conservatives' tax cuts for banks, impose a one-off windfall tax on the \"super-profits\" of oil and gas producers, and increase taxes on social media giants and companies like Amazon and Google.\n\nGreens - It would introduce a wealth tax of 1% on individuals' assets above £10m and 2% above £1bn.\n\nReform - It would raise the income tax threshold from £12,570 to £20,000, reduce the tax on buying property and abolish Inheritance Tax on all estates under £2m. It would also reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 20%.\n\nSNP - It demands full devolution of decisions on taxation.\n\nPlaid Cymru - It would put capital gains tax, imposed on the sale of assets, in line with income tax levels.\n\nNHS and social care\n\nConservatives - They have committed to increasing NHS funding above inflation every year and recruiting 92,000 more nurses and 28,000 more doctors.\n\nThey have promised to build or modernise 250 GP surgeries and \"unlock\" 2.5 million NHS dentist appointments by incentivising private dentists to take on NHS patients.\n\nLabour - The party says it will cut waiting times by adding 40,000 more appointments every week. It will also double the number of cancer scanners and add 8,500 new NHS mental health staff.\n\nIt has promised 100,000 extra dental appointments for children.\n\nLib Dems - They have pledged £1.1bn on hospitals and other NHS infrastructure and promised 8,000 more GPs.\n\nThey say they want to introduce free personal care for those that need it, increase carers' minimum wage and boost carers' allowance by £20 a week.\n\nGreens - The party says it wants to increase the NHS budget by £8bn in the first year, rising to £28bn by 2030.\n\nIt wants to provide guaranteed access to an NHS dentist, legalise assisted dying and increase carers' pay.\n\nReform - It would cut tax for frontline healthcare staff for three years, offer tax relief on private healthcare, and provide some NHS patients with vouchers for private treatment.\n\nSNP - It is against NHS privatisation and wants to scrap the sick pay threshold.\n\nThe party would also increase the NHS and social care budget by at least £10bn a year.\n\nPlaid Cymru - It would pay all social care workers at least £1 above the real living wage.\n\nThe party would also increase health spending to 8.7% of the overall budget, as well as creating 500 new GP surgeries and a new dental school.\n\nDefence\n\nConservatives - The party wants to boost defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030.\n\nLabour - It will set out a path to the same 2.5% target.\n\nLib Dems - They would raise defence spending every year of the parliament, also with an ambition to spend at least 2.5%.\n\nGreens - The party would cancel Britain's nuclear deterrent.\n\nReform - It would increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by year three, and then 3% within six years. It would recruit 30,000 army staff.\n\nSNP - It would raise the military recruitment age from 16 to 18, demand a ceasefire in Gaza, and end the Trident nuclear deterrent programme.\n\nPlaid Cymru - It supports the withdrawal of arms contracts with countries that have poor human rights records and opposes the UK's renewal of Trident.\n\nImmigration\n\nConservatives - They have promised legal migration will fall every year by putting a cap on the number of people who can move to the UK.\n\nThe party wants to move forward with its Rwanda plan, putting people who arrive on small boats across the Channel on monthly flights to the African nation.\n\nLabour - The party wants to ban employers from recruiting from overseas as default and make sure more UK workers are trained. It would reform the points-based immigration system and bring in more restrictions on visas.\n\nOn illegal migration, it has said it will scrap the government's Rwanda plan, and focus on stopping people-smuggling gangs and beefing up border security.\n\nLib Dems - It will tackle people-smuggling, lift the ban on asylum seekers working and scrap the government's Rwanda scheme.\n\nGreens - It wants to help migrants \"put down roots\". It would end the minimum income requirement for spouses of work visa holders and provide safe routes for those fleeing persecution.\n\nReform - It would freeze non-essential immigration and bar international students from bringing dependants.

It has also promised to end no-fault evcitions and stop developers selling new flats as leasehold.\n\nLib Dems - They also want to ban no-fault evictions and make three-year tenancies the default. They want to build 380,000 new homes, including 150,000 social houses.\n\nGreens - 150,000 new social houses are also on the Greens' agenda, along with ending Right to Buy, controlling rents and ending no-fault evictions.\n\nReform - It wants to go further than the Tories on stamp duty, abolishing it for houses under £750k. It would fast-track new housing on brownfield sites.\n\nSNP - It would scrap the so-called 'bedroom tax', which reduces benefits for council tenants with spare rooms.\n\nPlaid Cymru - It would ensure Welsh companies are contracted to build new homes and expand the social housing supply.\n\nThe party would also crack down on illegal holiday lets.\n\nEducation\n\nConservatives - The party has pledged to protect day-to-day spending per pupil, ban mobile phones during the school day and introduce 30 hours' free childcare from nine months old.\n\nFor 18-year-olds, national service will become compulsory, with a choice between military or civic duties.\n\nLabour - It will recruit 6,500 new teachers in key subjects, establish 3,000 new nurseries, and introduce free breakfast clubs in every primary school. It will also charge private schools VAT.\n\nLib Dems - The party will put a mental health professional in every school, increase funding and create life-long skills grants to spend on education and training.\n\nGreens - The party wants a £2bn pay uplift for teachers. It would scrap university undergraduate fees, which are currently £9,250 per year.\n\nReform - It wants children to be taught about their heritage, and plans to ban \"transgender ideology\" in schools.

It will be \"pro-business and pro-worker\" and introduce a new industrial strategy, which will end short-term economic policy.\n\nLib Dems - It wants a better relationship with the European Union and an industrial strategy focused on renewables and other sectors.\n\nGreens - It wants to raise taxes for the wealthy, invest more in health, and bring railways, energy companies and water providers back under state control.\n\nReform - It would reform the planning system, speed up house building and infrastructure projects and cut red tape, including employment laws in order to make it easier to hire and fire workers.\n\nSNP - It would call an emergency budget to reverse all recent spending cuts, as well as giving Scotland its \"rightful share\" of marine funding.\n\nPlaid Cymru - It would devolve all economic decisions.\n\nEuropean Union\n\nConservatives - The party says it will \"build\" on its post-Brexit relationships in Europe, including through new defence treaties.\n\nLabour - The party wants to reset, deepen and improve its relationship with Europe.\n\nLib Dems - It has promised to \"fix the UK's broken relationship\", ultimately resulting in seeking to join the single market.

It pledged to treble offshore wind, scale up nuclear, partly through using new Small Modular Reactors, and promised no new green levies or charges.\n\nLabour - It will aim for clean power by 2030 by doubling onshore wind, tripling solar power and quadrupling offshore wind. It will establish state-owned Great British Energy, backed by £8.3bn, and it will not issue new licences for oil and gas fields in the North Sea.\n\nLib Dems - It has committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2045 at the latest.\n\nGreens - The party wants to stop all new fossil fuel extraction in Britain, phase out nuclear power, and rely increasingly on wind power plus solar.\n\nReform - It plans to ditch the net zero target and related subsidies and fast-track licences of North Sea gas and oil.
