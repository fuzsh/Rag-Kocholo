Paul Pierce netted 22 of his 29 points in the second half, and Shaun Livingston made a game-saving deflection to end the game on Wednesday, as the visiting Brooklyn Nets clipped the two-time defending NBA Champs, 96-95.

With the Nets in the midst of a playoff push, Pierce was up for the challenge and the 15-year veteran delivered big-time.

“This is the class of the league. This is the two-time defending champions and we’re coming down the stretch,” Pierce said. “These games are big.” Livingston praised Pierce’s leadership. “He’s our heart and soul of the team,” Livingston said. “Everybody know he shows up in big games.

The Heat trailed by one and had the final possession following a timeout with 3.5 seconds remaining.

Chris Bosh threw an inbound pass intended for LeBron James but Livingston knocked it away. Brooklyn’s Joe Johnson kept the ball in play and the clock ran out as the Nets improved to 3-0 against the Heat, with their first win in Miami since February 1, 2008.

Mirza Teletovic netted 17 points off the bench, while Livingston finished with 13 points, seven rebounds, four assists and three steals in the Nets’ seventh win in the last eight outings to move into the fifth spot in the Eastern Conference playoff race.

Bosh had 24 points, Dwyane Wade had 22 points and James added 19 but just two in the fourth quarter for Miami, losers in four of its last five games.
