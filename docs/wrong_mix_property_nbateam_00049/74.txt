Shaun Livingston is "Papa Dot" to two children now.

The Golden State Warriors guard/Peoria High School graduate and his wife, Joanna, have become parents again, according to Livingston's father, Reggie Livingston.

Joanna Livingston gave birth to Jonah Jazmine Livingston, a post Friday morning on Reggie Livingston's Facebook page stated.

It isn't clear when Jonah was born. A message was left for Reggie Livingston. The privacy controls on his Facebook post were changed later Friday.

Shaun Livingston didn't play in the Warriors' 125-123 victory Thursday night against Sacramento. He was tending to a personal matter, according to reports.

Jonah's birth came a few days after the second birthday of Shaun and Joanna Livingston's first daughter, Tyler Marie. After she was born, Shaun Livingston said "'Papa Dot' is in effect," a reference to his nickname, "S. Dot."

The 33-year-old Livingston has been averaging almost 4.5 points, two assists and two rebounds in 15.3 minutes per game this season for the Warriors, who have won three of the past four NBA titles.

Livingston has been on the team for all of them, as a key reserve.

Currently, the Warriors are first in the Western Conference.

Before he was on an NBA champion, Livingston led Peoria High to Class AA state championships in 2003 and 2004. He went straight from high school to the NBA.
