        "text": "There was that moment in the third quarter when you thought maybe it could happen again, that maybe the Golden State Warriors would drop Game 1 in Oakland on Thursday night and sacrifice home-court advantage in the NBA Finals the same way they had against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Finals. That same nervous pall overcame the crowd at Oracle Arena as the Cleveland Cavaliers erased an 11-point deficit, fueled by the notion that both Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson had somehow transformed from two of the best shooters in NBA history to a pair of intoxicated bar patrons attempting to conquer a Pop-a-Shot machine.\n\nAnd then, just like that, in the midst of a 15-0 run that propelled the Warriors to a 104-89 victory over Cleveland in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, the moment was gone. Because here is perhaps the most underrated thing about the Warriors: They go extremely deep, and they always have, as evidenced by the run, which was fueled almost entirely by Golden State’s bench. All the talk heading into this Finals was that the Cavaliers were at full strength, unlike last year, when they were down a pair of superstars in Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. But the truth is, that may not matter at all if the Warriors can go 10 deep like they did last night; it may not matter if the Warriors can still win a game by 15 points when Thompson and Curry combine to put up one of their lowest point totals of the season.\n\n“This was a strange game for us,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said afterward, and if anything, that was probably an understatement. Here was Curry, putting up an airball from the corner on a 3-point attempt, and here was Thompson, bricking the pull-up 3’s he usually nails with reckless abandon, particularly at home. But it didn’t matter, because Curry’s backup, Shaun Livingston – the same Shaun Livingston who, it should be mentioned any time he does something like this, nearly lost a leg following a gruesome knee injury – put up 20 points in 26 minutes on a series of the mid-range jumpers that have come to define his game the past couple of years. And it didn’t matter because Leandro Barbosa, who barely played in the Western Conference Finals against the Thunder, put up 11 points on 5-of-5 shooting; and it didn’t matter because the Warriors put up 45 bench points in all, compared to the Cavaliers’ 10.\n\nEditor’s picks"
