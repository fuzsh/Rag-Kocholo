        "text": "As is now a strong tradition for this mailbag, I received so many good questions about the Warriors that it’s only logical to split this into two columns, starting with today’s all-Warriors Part 1. In a day or so, we’ll follow that up with questions and answers about the A’s stadium fiddle-diddle, the Giants, the 49ers and everything else.\n\nI thought about waiting until the Warriors name a new general manager to replace Bob Myers, but we don’t know when that will be, and at this point, I can and will move through questions about the team’s new front office mostly presuming that Mike Dunleavy Jr. will soon get the job. If that breaks another way, we can deal with it then.\n\nI also wanted to get to the Warriors’ issues while fans and observers were still a bit inflamed/intrigued by Steve Kerr’s comments earlier this week on Draymond Green’s podcast, when Kerr gushed about the way the Miami Heat’s role players embrace the situation in the playoffs (and notably in Miami’s Game 2 finals victory over Denver) and don’t complain about sporadic playing time.\n\nHey, wait, was that an indirect critique of a few Warriors players, maybe Jordan Poole and Jonathan Kuminga most pointedly, who maybe struggled with this during the postseason?\n\nMy answer before any of your questions: Yes, there probably was a bit of that in Kerr’s words. And it isn’t shocking if you realize that Kerr and some of the Warriors’ veterans have been saying and hinting some similar things for a while now. This was a strained season and that continued through the postseason. Why else would Stephen Curry feel the need to give a rare speech to the team on the day before Game 7 against Sacramento? So maybe Kerr was sending a not-so-subliminal signal to Poole, Kuminga or anybody else by praising the Heat players. Maybe it wasn’t so subliminal. It certainly wasn’t the first one he’s sent.\n\nAlso, it’s important to note that Kerr was saying this to Draymond, who clearly was a receptive audience, specific to the finals and generally to more than that. They want more commitment and composure from the young players. They need more. They saw it from the Heat, and Kerr and Draymond weren’t too worried about possibly hurting anybody’s feelings by pointing it out.\n\nOK, let’s get to the questions and answers. I tried to pick at least one question on topics that were frequently raised or questions that were “liked” the most. Questions have been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nKerr on Dray’s podcast made it seem like Poole and Kuminga are on the trade block. Assuming those two are the core of an outgoing trade, what could the Warriors reasonably expect to get back and who are the obvious (and semi-obvious) dance partners? — Jack W.\n\nThat’s a little bit of a leap to make from a Kerr comment that didn’t mention Poole, Kuminga or even the Warriors at all, but I get that people can read into it however they want. The idea that Poole and Kuminga might be discussed in trade talk is not a new one given the Warriors’ financial situation, Poole’s exploding salary starting next season and Kuminga’s wobbly second season.\n\nBut I don’t think Kerr was announcing anything like that. It’s not even his decision, which he often emphasizes. The open question is: Whose decision is it ultimately going to be and what factors will determine the answers?\n\nI’ll just say that every indication I’ve gotten from the Warriors, before and after Myers’ decision to leave, has been that they aren’t dying to start tearing this apart, and I presume that Dunleavy has much the same opinion. If somebody wants to call them about Poole, I’m sure they’d listen. But I don’t foresee Joe Lacob ordering a salary purge just to make the books look better. If they trade Poole, they’d want to make it at least partly a basketball decision. And if that’s the case, I’ve been pointing to Toronto as an interesting potential partner because of all the talented tall wings on that roster. And if the decisions are all about basketball, I don’t think the Warriors are going to trade Kuminga at all.\n\nNow if Lacob and Peter Guber are determined to drop their financial commitment below $340 million or so, anything’s possible, and that’s where Kuminga might have to be attached just to entice a team to take some of the Warriors’ big contracts. But again, I don’t see that as a prime Warriors motivation right now. They’ve got Curry. They’re likely to bring Draymond back. They’ve got Klay Thompson under contract for one more year. The strong lean will be to keep most of this together.\n\nThere’s been so much press on the impact of Draymond Green punching Jordan Poole but not a peep on why Draymond did it. Shouldn’t that be answered? Why did he do it? — Steven B.\n\nWe can all guess at the inciting emotions, and I already have done as much speculation as I’m comfortable doing. Nobody has told me I was wrong to point out that it’s probably not random that Poole was the source of a lot of exasperation this season, from Curry to Kerr and obviously to this punch. But that’s just a wide-focus guess.\n\nThe only people who have first-hand knowledge of what got Draymond so angry are Draymond, Poole and anybody who was present when Draymond threw the punch. And nobody in that group has had any interest in explaining any of what led up to the incident.\n\nIf Poole wanted everybody to know, he’d have every right to tell the story. But he’s barely even addressed even the general sense of what occurred or how it affected him and the team. And if Draymond wanted everybody to understand what led him to it, he’d have every right to say so. But Draymond hasn’t come close, other than saying he was going through some personal issues and was in a bad mood that day. Lacob, Myers, Kerr … anybody else in power could’ve decided to open up. But none of them did. The Warriors closed ranks on this and that’s entirely their call.\n\nBeyond that, the Warriors dealt with it. The entire season was disrupted, clearly. But they’re the ones who were dealing with it, and if they didn’t want to describe how it happened, that’s how it goes. At least until the documentary comes out in four or five years.\n\nShould Kerr’s unwillingness to invest minutes in young guys’ development be considered a fatal flaw in his coaching philosophy? — Terry C.\n\nI’ll nod to the Kerr/Draymond conversation again and repeat something I’ve been saying for a while: It’s not just Kerr who can be wary of giving away minutes to error-prone young players. Draymond and Curry (with occasional chime-ins by Klay and Andre Iguodala) aren’t shy about offering their opinions on the roster and the rotations. Why wouldn’t they speak their opinions? And why wouldn’t Kerr listen?\n\nKerr has a way he wants guys to play, no doubt. He can be demanding of young players. It’s not always easy playing with Curry and Draymond. But one Warriors player emphasized this to me early this season while James Wiseman was struggling badly: Earning minutes is how this has to work on a team filled with so many great veterans. You can’t just give guys scholarships here. And it’s not like any of the young players who couldn’t make it with the Warriors have really flourished anywhere else.\n\nI think Kerr could’ve played Kuminga more this season, for sure. But Kerr’s belief is that giving Kuminga prime minutes while he was still making mistakes would’ve just made things worse for the Warriors and Kuminga. And Curry and Draymond agree that young players have to earn their minutes. Fact: I’m not arguing against all three of those guys.\n\nWhen are the Warriors going to announce the new GM? The draft and free agency is just around the corner. It seems to me that Dunleavy will not be the GM for whatever reason? — Daniel Y.\n\nIf Lacob has a strong sense that it’s going to be Dunleavy, and I believe he does, there’s no rush on this. Dunleavy’s been doing the day-to-day work already, he’s got Larry Harris, Shaun Livingston, Kirk and Kent Lacob and others to help out. Heck, Myers is still under contract for a few more weeks and can do some work, as Lacob pointed out last week.\n\nSo the longer this goes, the likelier it is that Dunleavy will be eventually named GM. I mean, if it was going to be somebody from the outside, the Warriors would already be incredibly behind the eight-ball in prep work for the June 22 draft. They sure aren’t acting like that.\n\nWhen will the announcement happen? Maybe Lacob will make it official by next week.\n\nI will point out, though, that when I asked Myers about Dunleavy ascending to the GM spot, Myers repeatedly said Dunleavy will be great in the job “if he wants it.” So I wonder if there might still be some negotiating left to do.\n\nHave you any sense at all that Bob Myers’ departure could influence Steve Kerr’s thinking about his own future with the Warriors? — Barry S.\n\nThough they’ve been close and trusted partners through this run, I don’t think Kerr’s fate is tied directly to Myers. As Kerr outlined on my podcast a few weeks ago, he knows his fate is much more closely tied to somebody even more important — Curry. As long as No. 30 is playing well and wants Kerr to be the coach, I think Kerr will be the coach. Which very much is the state of play for 2023-24 and probably for longer than that. Of course, if the new GM starts clashing with Kerr, that could change a lot of dynamics. But I just don’t see that happening, whoever the GM is. And especially not if it’s Dunleavy.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nThompson: A toast to the Bay Area's own, Bob Myers\n\nThe Bob Myers drama was surprising given the Warriors’ buttoned-up approach. Was there friction between Joe Lacob and Bob Myers that led to Myers leaving? — Tim S.\n\nWorking for a guy as demanding as Lacob isn’t always fun, and everybody saw a sampling of this at the goodbye presser. But you also usually win a lot more with a hard-charging boss than you do with a no-show owner. And I know that Myers always understood that. I don’t think Lacob and Myers ever really had major friction. In my opinion, they agreed on many more things than they ever disagreed on. I mean, Myers is very hard-charging in his own subtle way. He’s the guy who dreamed up the Kevin Durant signing, after all.\n\nIt’s just all these incredibly long postseasons plus four thousand days of phone calls and unceasing pressure from the top can wear anybody down.\n\nThere’s been much talk about trading Poole, Andrew Wiggins, and/or Kuminga for another aging star for one last title push. However, it seems Joe Lacob and his new GM could just as easily go in the other direction and jettison Draymond and Klay in a move to keep the team more viable over a longer period. What do you think is the likely direction the team goes? — Gregg O.\n\nI think the most likely scenario is that the Warriors keep most of this together for at least one more season. That’s what Curry wants. His opinion sort of matters.\n\nAnd I’m not even sure what “aging star” is worth acquiring at this point. I guess there was the LeBron James-to-the-Warriors burble a little while ago; I don’t completely rule that out just because I know Lacob is capable of trying to do anything. But that one is almost impossible.\n\nThe playing-time opening for Kuminga is as a third big. How can the coaching staff prepare JK to switch and help as a third big, and will he accept that assignment? — Drew R.\n\nKuminga’s going to accept any role that gets him onto the floor regularly. And I absolutely believe his best shot is as Draymond’s backup. If you think about it, the Warriors have almost never had a full-time backup for Draymond during the dynasty. They made do by switching a small forward — Harrison Barnes, Iguodala, Durant — into the 4 spot when Draymond rested or when they went small. Last season, it was mainly Anthony Lamb. Those can be Kuminga’s minutes, pretty easily. They should be an upgrade.\n\nAll Kerr wants is to see Kuminga get some rebounds, run the floor hard and figure out how to cut to the basket consistently. And if he starts hitting 3s efficiently, Kuminga will be hard to take off the court next season.\n\nCan you tell me the viability of this trade scenario: Trade Wiggins to Toronto for Pascal Siakam (bench strength) and then start Kuminga. Trade Poole to the Nets for more defense and bench strength. — Jay N.\n\nThese are not terrible proposals except that I don’t think any of these teams would agree to any side of this.\n\nWhat does the league think of Poole? Does he have value with the big contract and no desire to play defense? — Jeff T.\n\nCreative scorers who haven’t turned 24 yet have value in this league. Yes, I think the Warriors can get something solid for Poole. Would that player be the right fit? I have no idea. But I don’t think the Warriors would have to do a straight money dump if they want to move Poole.\n\nIs there any information on Mike Dunleavy Jr.’s opinion/relationship with Jordan Poole? — Ivan D.\n\nThat’s a good question. An important question if you’re wondering about the direction the Warriors might take this offseason. All I can say is that Dunleavy was part of the front office when the Warriors selected Poole in 2019, and I’m assuming that Dunleavy, like Myers, is still a pretty big believer in Poole’s future.\n\nThe window for the Warriors winning another NBA championship with Curry and the gang is winding down. If you were the next GM and asked to sign a true center to the Warrior roster, who would you pick? — Richard D.\n\nVictor Wembanyama. Other than that …? Andrew Bogut convinced me a while ago that you can’t just grab a random decent center and expect him to do well with the Warriors. It takes a very specific skill set and brain to blend in with Curry and Draymond. Some guys pick it up fast, like Bogut, Nemanja Bjelica or JaVale McGee. Others, like Wiseman, Willie Cauley-Stein or JaMychal Green, really don’t.\n\nIt can be a waste of time and resources to try too hard for a center. The Warriors won the 2022 title with Kevon Looney, Bjelica and Draymond, and that was going up against Nikola Jokić, Jaren Jackson Jr., Al Horford and Rob Williams in that postseason. So if I’m the GM, I do what the Warriors normally do and don’t stress out too much about adding another center.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nKawakami: Bob Myers' genius, Joe Lacob's urgency and the end of a glorious partnership\n\nWhat college player fits the Warriors’ profile? — Shaun S.\n\nWas it a coincidence that Anthony Slater and I almost literally ran into UCLA’s Jaime Jaquez right after Myers’ goodbye presser, when Jaquez was headed into the Warriors’ facility for a pre-draft workout? I’m not sure what position he’ll play in the NBA, but Jaquez can do some things that I think the Warriors can use. He’s a 6-foot-7 scrapper who can create space on his own and make some tough 2s; at UCLA, he often was the guy who had to go make a play when the offense bogged down.\n\nA Jaquez pick at 19 also could be a tribute to Myers, who didn’t do badly when he took Kevon Looney from his alma mater.\n\nAnother few names to toss out: Duke center Dereck Lively II and Indiana guard Jalen Hood-Schifino. Both are talented and seem a bit more ready-for-play in the NBA than most of the Warriors’ previous first-round picks.\n\nFrankly, the Warriors need more than another project here. They likely will lose Donte DiVincenzo to free agency, may or may not trade Poole and there are extreme limits on what they can do with the new CBA as a high-spending team. They’ve got GP2 and Moses Moody as sure-thing rotation backups. Maybe Kuminga. After that … maybe Patrick Baldwin Jr.? Yes, they could use a ready-to-play guy with the 19th pick.\n\nHow can the Warriors possibly get under the salary cap within the CBA and remain competitive? Will they do a reset on the roster? — Billy F.\n\nAs long as Curry, Klay, Draymond, Wiggins and Poole remain on the cap, the Warriors will not be close to getting under any cap line. But Poole could be traded and Klay only has one year left on his deal. There could be some major financial relief coming … but not until 2024-25.\n\nHow do you see Steph Curry’s career ending? Will he quit while on top or will he accept being a role player or playing on a non-contending team? — Greg A.\n\nWe’ve never seen a great point guard stay this good for this long, so I’m going to use some bigger players as potential career comps. Tim Duncan tailed off into his late 30s but was still a plus for his team up until he retired at 40 in 2016. Dirk Nowitzki had a longer, steeper drop, but still had his moments all the way til the end, then retired at 40 in 2019.\n\nI think as long as Curry feels like he’s a plus player, he’ll want to keep playing. He’s 35 now and obviously still one of the best players in the world. Why couldn’t he have one or two more seasons close to this level and then a few more as a Duncan-Nowitzki-type old head who can still summon some greatness maybe twice a month? Curry could play until he’s 39 or 40. I could see that.\n\nAnd I’m not saying it’s a guarantee that he’ll never play for another team, but I know that he sees how special it was for Kobe Bryant, Nowitzki, Duncan, Magic Johnson and a few other elite players to play for one team their entire careers. I think Curry would really like that … if the Warriors just remain in plausible contention.\n\nThe TK Show: Go to Tim Kawakami’s podcast page on Apple, Spotify and The Athletic app.\n\n(Top photo of Steve Kerr and Stephen Curry: Ezra Shaw / Getty Images)"
