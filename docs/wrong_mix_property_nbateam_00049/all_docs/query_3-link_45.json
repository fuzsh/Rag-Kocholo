        "text": "30.01.2008\n\nThose who criticised the team for 'over-celebrating' the 5-1 win over Arsenal simply don't understand football. Since 1999, we have had to suffer the ignominy of being beaten by our arch-rivals year in, year out. There were times when we were desperately unlucky and there were times when we were comfortably outplayed. However, the constancy of the results were stomach churning. Even if we went a goal up, I'd be sceptical of the team's ability to win the match. We appeared to suffer a debilitating inferiority complex (admittedly justified, when you compare league positions), which seemed to prevent us from ever claiming the win that we craved. I've lost count of the games in which we \"deserved to win\". It seems to me that when you are consistently unlucky, there is probably another explanation. Mentally, we seem to have always believed ourselves incapable of beating Arsenal.\n\nSo, having ended that hoodoo in some style, with our best performance of the season, I think the players were entitled to drink in the moment. In an age when players are slammed for not showing enough 'passion', it seems wildly unfair to pillory them for showing how much they care. The joy that radiated from Robbie Keane was, well, a joy to watch, and it would have been rather an anti-climax to have seen the players shake hands, give a wave to the fans and then saunter off the pitch.\n\nI can see where people are coming from when they point to the fact that we haven't actually won anything as a result of the game, and I do have uncomfortable memories of the pathetic collapse against Blackburn in the League Cup Final six years ago, which, of course, came off the back of a 5-1 triumph against Chelsea in the semi-final. In this sense, we have 'previous'. This win against Arsenal will mean little if we do not do the business against the Pensioners, a demanding task.\n\nHowever, there was nothing wrong with savouring that moment. The players had earned the right to celebrate, and the fans deserved something to cheer about, having had to endure a terribly disappointing season so far. When that opportunity came, we were never going to turn it down.\n\nThere is also the argument that Arsenal did not play their strongest side. This is true, but you can only beat the side that is put out in front of you, and one wonders if Arsene Wenger will regret having treated the Carling Cup as a sideshow if Arsenal end the season without a trophy. I would also contend that they way we performed that night, a full-strength (and they did have Gallas, Sagna, Hleb and Fabregas for most of the match), Arsenal would still have succumbed to a majestic display. Interestingly, if Wenger really did not care about the Carling Cup, then why did he bring on Fabregas, Adebayor and Da Silva for his fringe players ?\n\nWhatever the naysayers say (and I'd imagine they'd be saying things like 'nay'), this was a fabulous result, which will have given the team a whole lot of confidence, and puts us in a final. Qualifying for Europe via the league, despite a vast improvement under Ramos, still represents an uphill struggle, so it is important that we now have an opportunity to secure European football through the Carling Cup final. Certainly beating Chelsea will be some achievement, but our first team, on form, is capable of mixing it with the best sides in England. Perhaps not consistently, but in this one-off occasion, I'd expect us to give a great account of ourselves.\n\nIn other cup news, the loss against Manchester United was disappointing, but expected. I was initially outraged at Dawson's sending-off before replays showed in fact that he had temporarily taken on the role of goalkeeper, and thus fully deserved to concede a penalty and be dismissed. For long periods, we were equal to our opponents, but their home advantage and superb attacking prowess finally took its toll. The performance of O'Hara against Ronaldo was hugely encouraging.\n\nOn the transfer front, the signings of Woodgate and Hutton are very pleasing. Woodgate has always been one of the best defenders in England, but, of course, our ideal centre-back pairing of Woodgate and King may well remain a distant dream. It is a great shame that these two are so injury-prone, as both players, fit, would be strong contenders for a starting place for England. I would imagine that Woodgate underwent a thorough medical before the transfer went through, and although there was a strong sense of the inevitable when it transpired that he has already picked up an injury, if he manages to get a run of games under his belt, we will have a superb player marshalling our defence.\n\nWith Chimbonda reverting to moody-Frenchman type, and demanding more money and complaining about life at Spurs in general, it will be a relief to not only get rid of him, but to sign an even more capable, and younger player in his place. I am intrigued as to what made Hutton change his mind and decide to leave Rangers for Spurs (if I were a betting man, though, I'd suggest that the lack of a concrete offer from Manchester United helped clear Hutton's mind a little...), but whatever his reasons, we have got ourselves one of the best young players in Britain. His transfer fee is not to be sniffed at, but the consensus in Scotland seems to be that Hutton has the potential to become a world-class player.\n\nAdded to these two coups, the news that the \"Gilberto\" we are looking at is in fact, a left-back playing for Hertha Berlin, and not the static lump trying miserably to impersonate a footballer at the Emirates, is very welcome. If we do secure this transfer, then perhaps Bale, when he is back, will be moved permanently onto the wing, where he excelled for us earlier in the season. Our defence is looking a lot stronger than it did a couple of weeks ago, although our centre-backs are worryingly fragile. Nevertheless, Ramos is making things happen, and there is little doubt that Tottenham Hotspur are making steady progress.\n\nIf you agree or disagree with anything I have touched upon in this article, you can email me at Just_shaun@hotmail.com\n\n05.04.2008\n\nAfter the euphoria of our superb Carling Cup triumph, the team appears to have lost its way somewhat. March has not been a good month. Admittedly, we have nothing to play for in the league, but that doesn't mean that 4-1 defeats to Birmingham and Newcastle are acceptable. This despite the fact that Ramos will be looking to stamp his authority on the team in the summer and that means getting rid of the passengers. Chimbonda and Robinson are both almost definitely out and neither can have any complaints, although I suspect the former will be doing so vehemently, as sulking seems to be a vital part of his personality. I don't think anyone will be missing this happy-go-lucky ray of sunshine, despite his penchant for the memorable quip: 'It's all about the money. I don't care about the Carling Cup Final'. He will leave a sparkling legacy, including his pathetic penalty miss against PSV, his petulant trudge off the pitch in the Carling Cup Final that he desperately wanted to prove he didn't care about and his undying love of the dollar.\n\nRobinson, although rather a more amiable chap than his fellow dispensable team-mate, will be unsurprised to find himself being sold. His shaky performances have been unacceptable and he has been spared the ignominy of being permanently relegated to number two this season by the even worse displays of Cerny. He has been displaced in the England squad by a bloke with the nickname 'Calamity James' and in some wisecracking quarters, he has earned himself a cruel moniker of his very own, 'Misses' Robinson\n\nWith those two definitely out, the only players who we'll be keeping are Berbatov, Keane, King, the new signings (although I've seen enough of Gilberto not to shed a tear if he was prematurely sold) and Bale. Other than that, every player should be fearing for his future. This should be enough to prevent the crushing defeats suffered at Birmingham and at home to Newcastle. In light of this form, I'd wager that a fair few members of the first team squad are going to get offloaded, whilst many will find that they're still at the club simply because it is unfeasible to buy a whole new team in the summer. Our midfield consists mainly of decent players, but none have the quality required to sustain a push for the Champions League spots. Everton have Cahill and Arteta, Liverpool have Gerrard and Mascherano - Jenas, Malbranque and Zakora are all good players, but pale in comparison to the midfielders playing for 4th and 5th in the league. However, it is unlikely that all four of Jenas, Malbranque, Zakora and Lennon will be leaving this summer. It is fiendishly difficult to find available top players, and there is no point getting rid of personnel unless we can find better players to replace them. Still, if Ramos can give the midfield the same makeover that he's given to the defence, we'll look a lot stronger in the middle of the park next year. It is frequently suggested that it is the spine of a team that makes it formidable - central defenders and central midfielders. A central defence of King and Woodgate is undoubtedly a force, but we badly need dominant central midfielders.\n\nIt's been a strange season. A season of 'transition', which was supposed to be the season that, following our previous two seasons of bridesmaid to Arsenal's 4th placed bride, would see us finally make the step up to 4th place ourself. These expectations have been exposed as unrealistic, particularly as teams like Aston Villa, Everton and Portsmouth had actually identified problem areas and strengthened them, rather than adopting a somewhat scattergun transfer policy. Although I'd still like to see him given a chance next year, I think we can all safely say that £16m on Darren Bent was an unwise decision when we still had such a lightweight midfield. However, having come through this difficult season, we have Europe for the third time running to look forward to; we have a great manager; we have Jonathan Woodgate; it looks like we'll still have Berbatov next season and the money is available to improve next season.\n\nI hope that we will have revised our Champions League spot expectations for 2008/09, but I'd be surprised if we weren't considerably more competitive in the league next year.\n\nIf you agree or disagree with anything I have touched upon in this article, you can email me at Just_shaun@hotmail.com\n\n18.05.2008\n\nAt the risk of sounding like the jilted boyfriend claiming that his ex was crap in bed anyway, I'm finding it difficult to get distraught about Berbatov's impending departure. Undeniably a player of sublime skill, his attitude can be shocking and he does seem to prefer the spectacular when a simpler option would be more effective.\n\nRegarding the first criticism, I simply don't buy the 'But that's just how he plays !' crap. I'm not really referring to the way that he swans uninterestedly around the pitch (although, for God's sake man, give us a smile!), but rather his tendency to stay on the ground when he tumbles, for far too long. He may be good, but he's not going to be at his most effective when he's on the floor. Similarly, he seems to get more excited at the opportunity to berate team-mates, regardless of whether the ball is still in play, than at the opportunity to get the bloody ball himself.\n\nRegarding the second, it's true enough that most things he tries come off effortlessly, but there's always those times when he does not need to try the deft flick or back-heel, and would be better off providing a simple, direct pass. I think that this makes him less effective than the likes of Torres, Drogba and, perhaps controversially, Rooney.\n\nHowever, Berbatov remains our most talented player, and given the option, I would prefer him to stay. But what is really making this bitter pill somewhat easer to swallow is the transfer fee we will get for him. £30 million is a lot of money, and it is no secret that other areas of the team badly needs strengthening, particularly the midfield. Even with Berbatov gone, a strike-force of Keane and Bent would be formidable and if we do pull of an unlikely coup in signing Eto'o for around half the price of Berbatov's outgoing transfer fee, we will have done some admirable business.\n\nWhat would irritate me, though, would be to see Berbatov stay in the Premiership. I would find it hard to stomach seeing our formerly best player tormenting our defence along with Cristiano Ronaldo, whereas I would be able to appreciate Berbatov's silky skills if he was displaying them for Milan or Barcelona. Worst of all (excluding Arsenal, but they'd only come in for him if his contract was up ...) would be if he ended up at Chelsea. You do not want to see a talent like Dimitar playing at the most hateful club in the league. They simply don't deserve him.\n\nShockingly enough though, Spurs do exist as a fully formed football club, independent from Berbatov, and so moving on, the signing of Modric looks to be an inspired one. Given that he has had two blinders against the hapless England, his adaptation to the English game should be a smooth one (although it's not really as simple as that, it may take some time) and the acquisition of an effective playmaker was a priority.\n\nThe team's post Carling Cup malaise was unacceptable and will have left Ramos in no doubt that he must shake things up dramatically. I have wondered, for the past few weeks, if we would be in with a cheeky chance of snapping up Xabi Alonso, unsettled at Liverpool but undoubtedly a player of considerable pedigree. His range of passing would make him a great signing, and would give the whole club a lift, given that he is interesting a host of top European clubs. Of course, this would make his signature somewhat difficult to obtain, but there would be no harm in seeing if he would be interested in staying in England and playing for an ambitious club who have qualified for Europe and of course, boast one of the best Spanish managers in the game.\n\nAt left-back, I think it would be worth going on for Nicky Shorey, who is fairly certain to leave relegated Reading and would surely jump at the chance to join Spurs, given that his current destination looks like West Ham. Shorey has not had a great season, but has clearly gone stale; this move could revitalise him and encourage him to show the form that once had him playing for England.\n\nI know that Ramos is looking abroad for a goalkeeper, but Bolton's Jussi Jaaskelainen could be available at a reasonable price (free), as his contract is up at the end of the season. He is comfortable in the Premiership and would welcome the chance to seek a new challenge higher up the table. He's been one of the best goalkeepers in the league for some time now; his arrival for free would solve our goalkeeping problems and leave money to spend on other areas of the team.\n\nWhether Ramos takes my advice or not, I am looking forward to a close season filled with twists and turns in the transfer market, and hopeful for more concrete signings and less 'nearly' signings than we have been subjected to in the past !\n\nIf you agree or disagree with Shaun's views on the transfer targets, you can email him at Just_shaun@hotmail.com\n\n24.08.2008\n\nAt last, Dimitar Berbatov looks to be on his way. The more enthusiastic readers of my column (my mother and at least two other people), will note that I began my last article, in the middle of May, with much the same announcement.\n\nThe summer-long transfer sagas have been coming thick, fast and tediously this close season, and although I will be disappointed to see our best player leave, his departure will also provide an immense sense of relief as the Bulgarian, true to his unhurried nature to the end, finally withdraws from the tiresome will-he-wont-he-I-JUST-DON'T-care clique, led this summer by Cristiano Ronaldo (and founded by Patrick Vieira some time ago) and boasting members such as Gareth Barry, the ever-lovable Emmanuel Adebayor, Xabi Alonso and Didier Drogba.\n\nCan we cope without him ? Yes.\n\nWithout Keane as well ?\n\nSuddenly we have more of a problem. Although it has been mooted that Ramos will only play with one striker, it simply can't be Darren Bent. He's a good player, but asking him to lead the line next year after such a rotten season this year would be ridiculous. And in fairness, I doubt it is going to happen; Bent himself seems to be the subject of transfer talk, and Ramos does not seem overly keen to keep him.\n\nSo that's our first choice pair gone and quite possibly his backup. If we just take Keane and Berbatov out, that will probably amount to a cool £45m, although dependent on whether we decide to teach Manchester United a lesson and flog Berbatov to Spain or Italy for a few million quid less. I'd be all for doing this with Keane as well, although foreign bids for someone who took to Italy like a fish to a motorbike are an unlikely prospect !\n\nAnyway, this is a tidy sum, and if we add the £23m for Malbranque, Kaboul, Tainio and Chimbonda, that is a £68m war-chest (what a ridiculous word, but the alternative, 'kitty' is perhaps worse). Incidentally, a generous valuation for these four players would go something like this:\n\nMalbranque - £6m\n\nKaboul - £5m\n\nTainio - £3m\n\nChimbonda - £5m\n\nwhich is £4m short of the £23m that Roy Keane seems willing to hand over to us, and as stated, my valuations are somewhat optimistic. Obviously ,never look a gift horse in the mouth, and Keane has done well with Sunderland, but Niall Quinn surely has to question at some point his manager's transfer dealing. £9m for Craig Gordon! £3.5m for Greg Halford !\n\nAnyway, with £68m in the bank, we would be ready to do some serious buying. But I highly doubt that we will manage to find even one player of the same calibre as Keane or Berbatov, let alone two. Eto'o has already expressed indifference to our interest (although if he's anything like Younes 'earthquake' Kaboul, he may yet change his mind. Incidentally, do players generally treat earthquakes as incentives to transfer clubs ?) and I'd imagine David Villa remains a pipe dream which bears a disturbing resemblance to unsurprisingly futile attempts over the years to sign Shevchenko (when he was good) and Morientes (when he was good).\n\nAdded to our impending problems upfront, the team still looks shaky all over the pitch. A central defence of King and Woodgate remains the dream, but realistically will never happen on a consistent basis and after that our backup seems to amount to Michael 'I only play well with King' Dawson, Ricardo 'I don't play well with anyone' Rocha, and a handful of reserves. With this in mind, I do wonder if we should be selling Kaboul, who I think has more potential than Dawson and with the right coaching could become a good player.\n\nThe midfield still looks a bit of a mess. The quality of Modric is undeniable, but it may take him time to adjust to the pace of the Premiership and it is hard to predict how effective the teenage Dos Santos will be in his first season at the club. Jenas and Huddlestone remain decent options and maybe Lennon will finally pull his finger out and become the player we all hoped he would (you too, Zokora), but I am afraid to say that this midfield does not inspire confidence when our aspirations are Top Four. The imminent acquisition of Bentley (who has been signing 'tomorrow' for Spurs for a good few weeks now ... who was it that said tomorrow never actually comes) is welcome, but the central midfield needs strengthening in my opinion, particularly with squad players Malbranque and Tainio leaving and reducing our options.\n\nAll of a sudden, it looks like we're going to need all of that £68m if we're going to temper the departures with a host of quality signings. Ramos really needs to earn his spurs (sorry) in the next couple of weeks in the transfer market or I cannot genuinely see the club making much progress this year. The one ray of hope is that rivals have not been particularly busy either, with Everton having signed a grand total of zero players, Aston Villa only a Chelsea reserve and Portsmouth a Liverpool reserve. The difference is, however, that Everton get to keep Yakubu and Arteta, Villa get to keep Young and Agbonlahor and Portsmouth get to keep Krancjar and Defoe. All these clubs finished above us last year anyway; a depleted Spurs squad is not going to compete this year.\n\nRamos obviously knows this, but that £68m is going to have to be used wisely.\n\nIf you agree or disagree with anything I have touched upon in this article, you can email me at Just_shaun@hotmail.com\n\n21.09.2008\n\nI was not particularly optimistic for the start of this season. When a club sells its first-choice strike-force, it's going to have problems. When its first-choice strike-force happens to be the most effective part of the team, it's going to have real problems.\n\nBut even with this in mind, the team's performances this season have been absolutely shocking. Our new midfield has looked lightweight, and frustratingly, bereft of ideas. I am struggling with the logic of signing a top class creative central midfielder, and then shunting him out on the left. Modric will have enough on his plate to adapt to without having to contend with a new position on the field. He is not a winger; the reason we are putting him there seems to be that we don't actually have a left-footed winger on our books.\n\nWhy don't we ? And why don't we have decent backup to Woodgate and King, who we have to \"rest\" for important Premiership games ? Surely a decent holding midfielder would have helped take some pressure off an overworked defence ? And why have we replaced two brilliant strikers with a Man United reserve and a Russian with no Premiership experience ? We are now lumbered with three strikers, only one of whom actually has Premiership experience, but is in no way fit to lead the line, given his disastrous previous season. He has shown no real signs of stepping up to the plate yet. He has scored goals, but has looked average. His first touch is enough to make a grown man cry when you think about the players we have lost. Pavlyuchenko is going to have to find his feet fast; the pressure on him to do so will be intense, and I do worry that, along with his price tag and the fact that he is in a totally different culture, both geographically and 'footballistically', this will condemn him to a slow start. Another distressing omen: I've always thought of Pavlyuchenko as the \"shit half\" of the Arshavin-Pavlyuchenko Russian pairing. Having failed to get Arshavin, we have settled for his partner. The last time we signed the 'shit half' of an Eastern European partnership, we ended up with a Mr. Sergei Rebrov. Superstition ? Maybe. But I can't seem to shake the feeling that Pavlyuchenko's transfer fee is vastly inflated, and based on a couple of good performances at the Euros. Bizarrely, Rebrov has popped up to give Pavlyuchenko some dubious advice about living in Tottenham, which amounts to \"Don't walk anywhere, drive, the crime rate is higher there, because there are so many black people living there.\" Does anyone else miss him ? Thought not.\n\nFrazier Campbell looks like a decent player, but I really don't think we can rely on him as a first-choice striker. His acquisition (on loan), was clearly a panic buy, when it emerged that Mr Comolli had failed to get any of the strikers we wanted. Thus, with Berbatov on his way, we demanded of Man United that they \"give us someone.\" Understandably unwilling to part with Rooney or Tevez, they chucked Frazier Campbell our way, and probably chuckled at our desperation. Campbell's debut against Krakow was promising, but I cannot see him spearheading a challenge for the top four this season.\n\nSo that's our strike department in ruins. What about our midfield ? Certainly, in terms of talent, it is far better than last season's team, but it is hard to run an eye over the new signings in the squad without the word \"scattergun\" creeping into the mind. Having failed to sign a genuine left-winger, we've had to resort to putting Lennon or Modric there, and although Lennon has done well, we are not going to get results by deploying a right footed player, who has to constantly cut inside to make anything of note happen: defences will wise up !\n\nAnd watching teams plough through our midfield with ease does make you wonder why no one thought to put plans into place to sign a defensive midfielder. There was talk about Veloso, but it amounted to just that and the transfer window passed without a solution. Similarly, we have the most injury-prone first choice defence in the league. Our talisman can hardly manage two games in a row and Michael Dawson, his understudy, has deteriorated to the extent that I watch him play and actually find myself pining for Chris Perry.\n\nIf Comolli is really responsible for our transfer dealings, then I cannot see any argument for not getting rid of him. He has ballsed up pretty much in every way that he could, and as a result, we're going to have another season of \"transition\", unless Ramos proves himself to be a miracle worker, the new signings gel imminently, and/or we get players we actually need in January. For now, I think we need to focus on a transfer out: Comolli. Out.\n\nIf you agree or disagree with anything I have touched upon in this article, you can email me at Just_shaun@hotmail.com\n\n27.12.2008\n\nSo, really, what happened this season, and for the most part of last season, is that we got found out. That's OK, but I think we probably need to throw our hands up and admit, \"we got found out\". The charade that we were and have been, contenders for the top four, in recent seasons, has been finally blown out of the water. When we narrowly finished fifth to Arsenal in 'LasagneGate', we did so with a goal difference of 15. Arsenal's was 37. When we somehow managed to retain that position the next season, we did so with a goal difference of 3 !\n\nWe all knew, really, that players like Michael Dawson, Jermaine Jenas, Tom Huddlestone, Paul Robinson and Teemu Tainio were not players of the highest quality. They're all good players, and on their day, Jenas and Dawson look like England players, but said days are few and far between.\n\nWe're not the first team to have been found out. Remember when Ipswich finished fifth in their debut season in the Premiership ? Then the next season, they crashed to 18th ? Reading did well to get to eighth in their first season in the Premiership, but was it really that surprising that they finished 18th last season ? Teams get found out. It's happening to Hull now, as well, in recent weeks.\n\nWhen we finished fifth twice in two seasons, I think it was very much a case of being a bit better than the rest, but the competition was not particularly stiff. Aston Villa were managed by David O'Leary, Everton had James Beattie leading the line and Portsmouth were lumbered with Alain Perrin, until 'Arry came back and took his time to work his magic.\n\nI don't want to denigrate the achievements of the team, but we were never really imbued with quality throughout the side, as Aston Villa look to be now. The quality we did have was our strike-force - we will not have a better trio than Defoe, Berbatov and Keane, for a long long time and the latter two were ruthlessly picked off by better clubs, whilst Defoe was, in what now looks to be a rather short-sighted move, flogged to Portsmouth.\n\nPeople suspected, people knew, that we were a decent team with a extraordinarily good strike-force. I can't profess to know what happened last season, when we still had Keane and Berbatov, but staggered drunkenly towards 11th place (although Michael Dawson, Ricardo Rocha and the absence of Ledley King, and the failure to replace Michael Carrick, AGAIN, might go some way to providing an explanation), but we were found out.\n\nThis sobering realisation does mean that we're probably going to have to rebuild all over again. All areas, (except, and surprisingly so, the goalkeeper), need a makeover. It has been the midfield's lack of creativity that has stood out for some time, although the addition of Modric and resurgence of Lennon has certainly helped. At the moment, with the side having scored 20 goals in 19 games, it does not take a genius to work out that we need a striker. Darren Bent's finishing is superb, but never have I seen him make a chance on his own; his first touch puts paid to any chance of that happening, as it generally does the work the opposing defender is expected to do. There is simply nothing inspirational about Pavlyuchenko and Fraizer Campbell looks like he's on a training course every time he steps out on the pitch. United are on to a winner with this one. Send him to Spurs, they have no strikers, they'll have to play him and he'll learn on the job. If he becomes an accomplished striker (don't hold your breath, Sir Alex), we'll take him back later. Otherwise, I believe Hull are waiting in the wings with a ridiculous £7 million bid ! The problem is that we're sending a trainee out to do a professional's job ... and it shows.\n\nWe do remain a good cup side, somehow, and I am hoping that we can retain the Carling Cup. I'm concerned at the prospect of facing Aston Villa in the UEFA Cup, if we do overcome Shakthar Donetsk, but at least if we win the League Cup, we will have the attraction of European football next year to attract a better breed of player.\n\nFor now, I think 'Arry's going to have to pull something out of the bag, (Owen ? Defoe ? Please not Bellamy), so that we can at least claw our way to a respectable position and score some bloody goals ! I really don't think we're in danger of relegation this year, but it might be nice to at least challenge for the top 10.\n\nTruly, we've been found out.\n\nIf you agree or disagree with anything I have touched upon in this article, you can email me at Just_shaun@hotmail.com\n\n17.01.2009\n\nIf there's a clearer sign that we're going backwards, I certainly don't know what it is.\n\nJermain Defoe couldn't get in our team a year ago. We sold him for £9m. Now he can, so we've bought him back for £15m. We paid Portsmouth £6m to take him on loan for a year.\n\nDefoe hasn't become a better player in that year, he's as good as he was a year ago. Good, but not great.\n\nTo all the misty-eyed Spurs fans who are now proclaiming the return of the Messiah. The same fans who idiotically sang his name when he was still at Portsmouth, doing wonders for Darren Bent's self-belief.\n\nJermain Defoe relies on confidence to a ridiculous level. This means if he misses a chance, his confidence drops, and he goes missing for the rest of the game. And probably for the next couple of games too.\n\nJermain Defoe is selfish. This is, to an extent, a virtue, because it means he scores goals by going alone, when the opposition expect him to pass. However, it also means that he wastes chances by often making the wrong decision at times, failing to make the killer pass, and shooting from a ridiculous angle instead.\n\nJermain Defoe is small. He gets bundled off the ball with alarming regularity. He won't score any headers for you.\n\nJermain Defoe is not a big game player. He has looked ordinary whenever he has played for England.\n\nHaving said this, he's not bad at all. He'll get us goals, but I just want to clarify that he is the next level down from the likes of Berbatov and Keane. personally can't help wondering why we didn't pay the additional £5m for Arshavin, a proven world-class performer who will also get the best out of Pavlyuchenko. If he ends up going to Arsenal, I, for one, will be somewhat miffed.\n\nEqually, we could have tried going for Michael Owen, a more predatory player than Defoe, who would have cost a fraction of the price.\n\nBut then again, transfer policy has never really been our strong point. We're offering £14.5m (£14.5m !!!!) for the left-footed Bentley, Stewart Downing. Charles N'Zogbia would cost about £8m. Joe Ledley would cost about £6m. But no, we're going for the inconsistent one trick pony, Stewart Downing. We may have got rid of Comolli, but we had a terrible transfer policy before he came, and have continued it since he left, with gusto. So desperate are we to acquire Stewart Downing that, if reports are to believed, we are willing to hand over Gareth Bale, a player of enormous potential, who will most probably be better than Stewart Downing in a couple of years.\n\nThe way Giovani Dos Santos has been treated has left a lot of fans scratching their heads too. When we've seen him, he's looked like a player with a touch of class. Raw, but certainly a player with potential. Yet, if there's something we're not seeing, that really makes him worthy of the scrapheap, then surely this defect should have been spotted before we spent £7m on him ?\n\nOur scatter-gun transfer policy is holding us back. We splashed out £17m on a right-winger, without giving a thought to the fact that we actually needed a left-winger. We spent £16m on Darren Bent when we had Berbatov, Keane and Defoe. We let Defoe go when we pretty much knew Berbatov was going to be on his way in the summer. We are reportedly looking at Shay Given when Gomes is now looking like one of our best players.\n\nMeanwhile, teams all around us are identifying weak spots, and strengthening those areas. Until we sit down, and revise the way we recruit our new personnel, we are going to be also-rans.\n\nEvery time I see Jermain Defoe trot out for us, his ears ringing with disproportionate praise, I will be reminded of just how badly we have planned our recruitment process in the last few years. He's a good player (and a Yiddo, as the song goes), but to me, is symbolic of the shambolic way the club's been run for the last decade.\n\nIf you agree or disagree with anything I have touched upon in this article, you can email me at Just_shaun@hotmail.com"
