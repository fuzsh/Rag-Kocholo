        "text": "Standing in the Milwaukee Bucks locker room after a 97-93 victory over the high flying Philadelphia 76ers was the quiet figure of Shaun Livingston. I watched as he entered the room by himself, sat at his locker completely uninterrupted by the pack of media stationed in the middle of the floor and set about getting dressed.\n\nMoments later, the same door opened and this time a towel covered Brandon Jennings, the Milwaukee Bucks star starting point guard, strutted in. The contrast between two players who share the same position and are locker room neighbours, could not have been more stark.\n\nOne was engulfed by the media with questions machine-gunned at him about the win and his personal performance of 33 and 7, while barely two feet away the other sat in silence, completely unaffected by the party nearby.\n\nFor the quiet Shaun Livingston, it appeared to be a case of 'new toy-old toy' with Livingston playing the role of Woody to Jennings' Buzz Lightyear.\n\nAt one stage though, it was the former fourth pick in the 2004 draft, Shaun Livingston, who was the object of the media's desire having grown into the game at NBA level by his third year.\n\nBut THAT devastating knee injury robbed him of the opportunity to fulfil his potential and now all he can do is stand back and watch as Jennings enjoys an NBA career that could so easily have been Livingston's.\n\nBut if you thought that such a scenario would create jealousy in the 6'7 Livingston, you would be mistaken.\n\n\"I'm so happy for Brandon,\" Livingston told me as he talked about Jennings enjoying what he had missed out on.\n\n\"I never feel frustrated or disappointed based off of someone else's success.\"\n\n\"You can live your life with that attitude or you'll always be searching for more. I'm definitely thankful for being able to play again and the life that I have. I'm definitely blessed.\"\n\nThere was an overwhelming sense of gratitude on Livingston's behalf when he spoke, which is hard to imagine him feeling when you remember that he was once touted as being 'the next Magic Johnson'. But I guess when you endure what he has, it gives you a different perspective on life.\n\n\"It feels good (to be back) man, just an opportunity to get back in the NBA and play, just to showcase my skills in front of teams and fans, family every night is a dream come true. It's my passion and I'm definitely blessed and thankful.\"\n\nIn much the same way as a recovering alcoholic takes one day at a time - a deliberate choice made to prevent them from becoming complacent during their rehabilitation, knowing that a slip on their behalf could lead them back into the world of pain they came from - Livingston ensures he punctuates every sentence with gratitude and thanks.\n\n\"I feel healthy, the knee's holding up, I'm definitely thankful for that. Really, I'm just continuing to stay healthy.\"\n\nWhether he fills in at shooting guard (\"I'm a point guard at heart\") or continues to give support from the bench, he isn't concerned. Because for Livingston, each day healthy is another day won."
