        "text": "Heat top Brooklyn Nets on late run, lead series 2-0\n\nMIAMI – Strange as it sounds, missing shots worked wonders for the Miami Heat.\n\nAnd after the Brooklyn Nets went nearly 2 minutes — a basketball eternity — without the ball down the stretch, the two-time defending NBA champions soon found themselves two wins from another trip to the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nLeBron James scored 22 points, Chris Bosh added 18 and the Heat pulled away late to beat the Nets 94-82 on Thursday night, taking a 2-0 lead in the East semifinals.\n\n\"To be able to get some stops like that at the end, and then execute, it's something that's critical in this series,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.\n\nDwyane Wade had 14 and Ray Allen scored 13 for the Heat, who tied a franchise record with their eighth straight playoff victory. They'll go for No. 9 on Saturday night, when the best-of-seven series shifts to Brooklyn for Game 3.\n\nFor the second straight game, Miami had five players in double figures.\n\n\"That's what our team is all about,\" James said. \"We don't really care who scores.\"\n\nMirza Teletovic set a Nets playoff record with six 3-pointers, on his way to a 20-point night off the bench. Shaun Livingston scored 15, and Paul Pierce and Joe Johnson each added 13 more for the Nets. Deron Williams was 0 for 9 from the field, the worst shooting night of his career.\n\n\"That one hurt,\" Nets coach Jason Kidd said. \"We were right there. We gave ourselves, on the road, an opportunity against the world champs. We let the game slip away. That one possession when they got four offensive rebounds, it didn't lose the game for us.\"\n\nIt was three rebounds, but no matter. It was still a backbreaker for the Nets.\n\nTeletovic scored inside with 3:39 left to get Brooklyn within eight. For the next 100 seconds, Miami kept possession.\n\nJames missed a 3-pointer, and Allen — who led Miami with eight rebounds — maneuvered his way around four Nets to grab the rebound. James missed again, and Wade grabbed that board. James missed a layup, but Bosh controlled that board. And finally, almost mercifully, Wade found James for a layup with 1:59 remaining. The lead was 10, the outcome decided.\n\n\"That was a killer,\" Johnson said.\n\nWade had just six points in the first 37 minutes, then eight more in the next three, setting the tone for a grind-it-out fourth quarter from Miami.\n\n\"You've got to do the little things until you get your opportunity,\" said Wade, who finished with seven rebounds and seven assists. \"That's what I was able to do.\"\n\nClippers: The estranged wife of owner Donald Sterling will fight to retain her 50 percent ownership stake in the team, her lawyer said Thursday, adding an unwanted twist to the NBA's plan to force new ownership on the franchise. Shelly Sterling's attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, said his client \"will not agree to a forced or involuntary seizure of her interest.\" O'Donnell said Shelly Sterling has no interest in managing the Clippers and wants a new investor group to come in with a professional management team.\n\nSixth Man: Jamal Crawford won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award Thursday, becoming the oldest recipient and the first to do so with different teams. He led the NBA's reserve players in scoring this season, averaging 18.6 points, and set the single-season franchise record for 3-pointers made with 161.\n\nThe 34-year-old guard also was honored as the league's best player off the bench while with the Atlanta Hawks in 2009-10. He joins Kevin McHale, Ricky Pierce and Detlef Schrempf as two-time winners. Crawford received 57 first-place votes from a panel of 125 sportswriters and broadcasters. Taj Gibson of Chicago finished second, and San Antonio's Manu Ginobili was third."
