        "text": "Steve Kerr’s wife Margot Kerr seems like a cool lady.Stephen Douglas Kerr, the old sharpshooter, winner of rings, loser of nothing. You can tell by her twitter account that she’s got a sense of humor and seems happy with life. She wears aviators and hails from Arizona. Chances are she’s laid back and fun, right? Steve Kerr’s wife came into the picture during their sophomore year of college at Arizona. They married in 1990. Ah…\n\nSteph Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry has to be at the top of any list of the coolest wives in the NBA. The Curry’s took to YouTube to spin their own version of 0 to 100/The Catch Up, by Drake. The original just happens to have a shoutout to Steph, saying “I been Steph Curry with the shot. Been cookin’ with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy,” While it’s definitely the most viewed video on…\n\nWhen you’re Klay Thompson, life is good. And Klay Thompson’s girlfriend history shows that life can be as good off the court as it is on the floor. Thompson is lucky to come from an NBA pedigree. His father, Mychal Thompson, helps him navigate the pitfalls that being an NBA star brings. And while Klay has had his share of female attractors, it’s never devolved into scandal. Something to be said for that. Without further…\n\nDraymond Green’s wife and Draymond Green’s girlfriend are popular searches that land people on this site. Since his rise to stardom as the muscle on Golden State, folks want to know. But, there’s some confusion on how we got here, so let’s figure it all out. What’s up with Draymond Green’s girlfriend in 2018-2019? Well folks, maybe that wife tag was never officially official. Because, Draymond Green’s is now dating Hazel Renee. For those…\n\nJoe Lacob’s girlfriend Nicole Curran is on the brink of becoming Joe Lacob’s wife. That’s right folks. Joe Lacob put a ring on it. This is the second time, too. Joe Lacob’s ex-wife Laurie is the mother of their four children; two boys and two girls. Their son, Kirk Lacob is the Warriors Assistant GM. Back to Joe Lacob’s girlfriend. Nicole recently gave an interview to a wine website in which she talks at considerable length…\n\nJavale McGee’s girlfriend Giselle Ramirez formerly worked in Los Angeles as a realtor. Now, I don’t think she works any more. It helps to be incredibly hot if you want to sell high-priced apartments. In fact, Giselle introduced Javale to his current home. He fell in love with both fairly rapidly. The home belonged to Marc Anthony, the singer, before Javale took it off his hands. He paid 2.42 million dollars. Honestly, it seems like a steal to…\n\nShaun Livingston’s wife Joanna Livingston modeled professionally for over 12 years, according to a profile Melting Pot Beauty posted. They mention Joanna’s business partner at the time, and since she also modeled, they might mean twelve years combined. She married Shaun in early August of 2017. Joanna also already gave birth to their daughter in February, 2017. They named the kid Tyler Marie. Seems like a somewhat bold move to name a girl Tyler. However, I prefer…"
