        "text": "Reaction Saturday on the audio recording of a man identified as Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling telling his girlfriend not to bring black people to games:\n\n___\n\n\"There is no room for Donald Sterling in our league. There is no room for him.\" — LeBron James, Miami Heat forward.\n\n___\n\n\"The reported comments made by Clippers owner Donald Sterling are reprehensible and unacceptable. The National Basketball Players Association must and will play a very active role in determining how this issue is addressed. There needs to be an immediate investigation and if the reports are true, there needs to be strong and swift action taken.\" — Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, a former NBA player.\n\n___\n\n\"This is the first test for Adam Silver, because you can't have this guy making statements like that ... (if it's Sterling on the recording), he has to suspend and fine him immediately.\" — Charles Barkley, TNT analyst.\n\n___\n\n\"These statements are offensive and despicable and have no place in Los Angeles. I urge the NBA to act swiftly. L.A. fans deserve and demand better.\" — Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti.\n\n___\n\n\"I would say it's probably disappointing to a lot of people, you know what I mean? But you look at what's kind of gone on in the past, it's very unfortunate, but I think it kind of tells the same story as what's been told if you pull up the record.\" — Shaun Livingston, Nets and former Clippers guard.\n\n___\n\n\"I'm so angry that I just don't want to say anything. I don't want to add validity to anything that he said by being out of character. But the NBA owners need to handle their own. They need to take him out to the shed and handle him. Not only is being a jerk not good, but it's not good for the business of basketball.\" — Chris Webber, TNT analyst.\n\n___\n\n\"(Wife Cookie) and I will never go to a Clippers game again as long as Donald Sterling is the owner.\" — Magic Johnson, Hall of Famer who was mentioned in the recording.\n\n___\n\n\"The NBA must investigate L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling's recent racial comments that were caught on tape and discipline him. No one should be allowed to own a team if they have in fact engaged in this kind of racial language. We are prepared at National Action Network to rally in front of the NBA headquarters if this matter is not immediately dealt with.\" — Rev. Al Sharpton.\n\n___\n\n\"The comments are obviously disgusting.\" — Gregg Popovich, San Antonio Spurs coach."
