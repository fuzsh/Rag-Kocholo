        "text": "Born on September 11 and in 1985, Shaun Livingston’s basketball accomplishments left his father who started coaching him to be a sportsman when he was still a boy, a super fulfilled and happy man.\n\nWith more than twelve years of experience as a professional basketball player, the American is currently climbing the point guard spot for the NBA’s Golden State Warriors.\n\nPrior to joining the Warriors after his stint with the Brooklyn Nets, Shaun Patrick Livingston played for a handful of other famous teams, including the Cleveland Cavaliers, Washington Wizards, Milwaukee Bucks, Charlotte Bobcats, Oklahoma City Thunder, Tulsa 66ers, Miami Heat and of course, the Los Angeles Clippers which was the genesis of his NBA career.\n\nShaun Livingston’s Parents\n\nThe dude’s parents are Reggie Livingston (father) and Ann Wyman (mother). Can’t say they raised Shaun alongside his sisters – Sarah Aupperle-Livingston and Blair Wyman as Reggie and Ann separated when Shaun was just 2 years old.\n\nHer parents meet at a nightclub in Peoria, Illinois. They danced and ignited a fondness for each other that saw them united in marriage two years later. They welcomed Shaun soon after, but the marriage was not to last until a year and a half. The Reggie-Ann union collapsed just after 15 months and Ann was awarded custody of their son. But since it was difficult for him to stay for his child, Reggie regained custody.\n\nAs such, the B-baller was raised by his father, who worked with his own father (Shaun’s grandfather) Frank to prepare Shaun for what he is now known for. Nonetheless, the NBA star would agree that he got his passion for basketball from his mother’s side. He once revealed that all of his brothers play basketball.\n\nWife or girlfriend Shaun Livingston is married?\n\nAmong the many speculations about the NBA star are the facts surrounding his romantic affairs. You may come across various sources online claiming that the basketball player has dated multiple women, but we can only authenticate his affair with Joanna Williams.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the love life of the man revolves around the woman who would be of Puerto Rican, Italian and African descent. Raised in Las Vegas, Nevada, Joanna, affectionately known as Joey, has been a model for over 15 years. From what we’ve gathered, she’s one of the founders of Las Vegas-based Chung Marie Group, which prides itself on describing itself as a full-service creative production company.\n\nFor reasons best known to Mr. Livingston, he always tried to keep his relationship with Joey private. While it’s hard for anyone to say exactly when the two first fell in love, many also don’t know that the lovers are now life partners – they tied the knot in August 2017.\n\nIt was a very discreet wedding; even some of his NBA buddies couldn’t attend the union. In fact, he said those who didn’t know they were attending a wedding, they thought it was just a party and, a party was until the couple announced they were getting together. marry right away, there and then. Since then, they lived and lived together in their Oakland home.\n\nLivingston and Joanna have much more in common than their love and admiration for each other that has kept them together. The couple have a daughter they named Tyler Marie, she was born in February 2017 before her parents tied the knot. Although Shaun has been careful to make his private life public, he shares photos of his wife and daughter on his Instagram page. Apparently they mean the world to him.\n\nHis salary\n\nYou don’t have to speculate on Shaun Livingston’s salary, the last three-year contract he signed with the Golden State Warriors in July 2017, is worth $24 million. This will see him pocket no less than $7,692,308 from the 2017-18 to 2019-20 season. The deal is secured for $2 million.\n\nShaun has indeed come a long way since his earnings were on average, about half of the amount he currently earns when he was with the Los Angeles Clippers (2004-2008).\n\nHeight and other facts about Shaun\n\n1. As you would expect from a basketball player, Shaun is a tall man. He is 7 inches taller than 6 feet (2.01 m) and weighs 87 kg (192 lb).\n\n2. He made his NBA debut in November 2004 after being drafted as the 4th pick in the 1st round by the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\n3. Shaun won the NBA championship twice with the Golden State Warriors. His first was in 2015 and then in 2017.\n\n4. He donated $1 million in 2016 to Concordia Lutheran School, where he was educated from kindergarten through eighth grade.\n\n5. Shaun received the Illinois Mr. Basketball honor in 2004 as the top high school basketball player in the US state."
