        "text": "Paul Pierce netted 22 of his 29 points in the second half, and Shaun Livingston made a game-saving deflection to end the game on Wednesday, as the visiting Brooklyn Nets clipped the two-time defending NBA Champs, 96-95.\n\nWith the Nets in the midst of a playoff push, Pierce was up for the challenge and the 15-year veteran delivered big-time.\n\n“This is the class of the league. This is the two-time defending champions and we’re coming down the stretch,” Pierce said. “These games are big.” Livingston praised Pierce’s leadership. “He’s our heart and soul of the team,” Livingston said. “Everybody know he shows up in big games.\n\nThe Heat trailed by one and had the final possession following a timeout with 3.5 seconds remaining.\n\nChris Bosh threw an inbound pass intended for LeBron James but Livingston knocked it away. Brooklyn’s Joe Johnson kept the ball in play and the clock ran out as the Nets improved to 3-0 against the Heat, with their first win in Miami since February 1, 2008.\n\nMirza Teletovic netted 17 points off the bench, while Livingston finished with 13 points, seven rebounds, four assists and three steals in the Nets’ seventh win in the last eight outings to move into the fifth spot in the Eastern Conference playoff race.\n\nBosh had 24 points, Dwyane Wade had 22 points and James added 19 but just two in the fourth quarter for Miami, losers in four of its last five games.\n\nOther Results\n\nSan Antonio Spurs 103 - 90 Portland Trail Blazers\n\nLA Clippers 111 - 98 Golden State Warriors\n\nDallas Mavericks 108 - 101 Utah Jazz\n\nNew York Knicks 116 – 92 Boston Celtics\n\nSacramento Kings 115 - 98 Philadelphia 76ers\n\nToronto Raptors 101 - 87 Detroit Pistons\n\nMemphis Grizzlies 90 - 88 New Orleans Pelicans\n\nCharlotte Bobcats 98 - 85 Washington Wizards\n\nDenver Nuggets 120 - 112 Orlando Magic\n\nCleveland Cavaliers 110 – 101 Phoenix Suns"
