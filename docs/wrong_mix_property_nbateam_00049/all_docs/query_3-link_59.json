With a background that includes working with industry leaders such as Wells Fargo Bank and CBRE Capital Markets, Adam has focused on building strong relationships with clients and industry partners and utilizing his expertise to help them achieve their goals.\n\nAdam began his career in banking, having formerly worked with Wells Fargo Bank and CBRE Capital Markets. During this time he was focused on financing commercial real estate as well as structured and financed business acquisitions for businesses all over the nation. His efforts earned him state-wide and national recognition for loan volume.\n\nHe also developed a passion for franchised concepts and in 2008 Adam purchased his first franchise. He quickly grew a niche, membership-model barbershop concept to several locations and increased revenues enough to provide a profitable exit strategy for his investors within four years.\n\nIn 2014 Adam purchased Atrium Management Company, in which he saw near limitless potential. Atrium currently manages over 5 million square feet of property across three states and has a growing development pipeline set to deliver millions of square feet of multifamily and commercial space. The company has received “Best Places to Work” honors from the Orlando Business Journal multiple consecutive years, and Adam has received its “Community Impact Award” in addition to being named to “Orlando’s 40 Under 40” and “Fast 50” lists.\n\nWith a deep understanding of the industry and a commitment to excellence, Adam continues to leverage his skills and experience to help clients succeed in the ever-changing world of real estate.\n\nCongratulations to Adam for being a 2017 40 Under 40 Honoree!\n\nCheck Adam out on Linkedin!\n\nIn his 16 years in property management Michael Krause has managed over 15,000 units across 22 different states.

He worked his way up from an entry level position to property manager of the largest property that AIMCO owned in Columbus, Ohio at the time. In 2008 the property he was managing was acquired by JRK Residential, a young and extremely profitable private equity firm out of Los Angeles, California. In 2011 Michael took a promotion to Area Manger of Central Florida, covering Orlando, Tampa, and eventually Jacksonville. In 2012 Michael was promoted to Regional Manager covering Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville, Sarasota, and eventually Philadelphia, PA and Savannah, GA.\n\nIn 2014 Michael moved to Boston to cover a large territory consisting of crucial new takeover properties in Boston, MA, Hartford, CT, Stamford, CT, Long Island, NY, and Philadelphia, PA. After he and his business partner Adam purchased Atrium Management at the end of 2014 Michael moved back to help run the company in January of 2015.\n\nDuring his time in property management Michael has hired 120+ employees and managed 250+ employees.
