Then check out this list of the best Golden State Warriors point guards. It includes almost every point guard from throughout Golden State Warriors history, including current point guards and past ones. Featuring some of the greatest NBA point guards of all time, the best Warriors PGs include Steph Curry, Tim Hardaway, Baron Davis, Sleepy Floyd, and Ron Williams.\n\nIn the 2021-22 NBA season, the current Golden State Warriors starting PGs and backup PGs are Stephen Curry, Gary Payton II, and Chris Chiozza.\n\nWho are the best point guards in Golden State Warriors history? Here is every player who has ever held the position of Golden State Warriors point guard.\n\nBirthplace : Akron, Ohio\n\nNationality : American\n\nTeam : Golden State Warriors\n\nPosition : Point guard\n\nGolden State Warriors: 2009–2022\n\nArguably the greatest shooter in NBA history, Steph Curry was drafted by the Golden State Warriors in 2009 and quickly made a name for himself with his phenomenal shooting ability. His quick release, deep range, and unparalleled accuracy revolutionized the game, paving the way for the modern NBA's emphasis on three-point shooting. A two-time MVP (in 2015 and 2016) and four-time NBA champion (2015, 2017, 2018,2022), Curry has been the centerpiece of the Warriors' recent dynasty, ushering in an era of excellence for the franchise.\n\nBirthplace : Chicago, Illinois, USA\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : United States of America\n\nPosition : Point guard\n\nGolden State Warriors: 1989–1996\n\nKnown for his killer crossover dribble, Tim Hardaway was drafted by the Warriors in 1989 and formed the dynamic \"Run TMC\" trio alongside Mitch Richmond and Chris Mullin. With a combination of speed, ball-handling skills, and scoring prowess, Hardaway was integral in making Golden State one of the most exciting teams in the league during the early 1990s. A five-time NBA All-Star, Hardaway's legacy with the Warriors is cemented as one of the best point guards to ever don the blue and gold.\n\nBirthplace : Los Angeles, California, USA\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : New York Knicks\n\nPosition : Point guard\n\nGolden State Warriors: 2004–2008\n\nArriving in Golden State via a trade in 2005, Baron Davis instantly injected life into the franchise with his awe-inspiring athleticism and playmaking ability. Known for his ferocious dunks and crafty passes, Davis helped lead the eighth-seeded Warriors to a historic upset over the top-seeded Dallas Mavericks in the 2007 playoffs. Although he didn't garner many individual accolades during his time with the team, Davis' impact on the organization remains unforgettable for fans who reveled in the brief, yet thrilling \"We Believe\" era.\n\nBirthplace : Gastonia, North Carolina\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Point guard\n\nGolden State Warriors: 1982–1988\n\nDrafted by the New Jersey Nets in 1982, Sleepy Floyd was traded to the Warriors in 1983 and quickly established himself as a dynamic scorer and playmaker during his tenure in the Bay Area. Showcasing his signature hesitation dribble, Floyd consistently kept defenders on their heels while creating opportunities for both himself and his teammates. Perhaps best remembered for his historic 29-point fourth quarter in the 1987 playoffs against the Los Angeles Lakers, Floyd remains a beloved figure among Warriors fans.\n\nBirthplace : Tampa, Florida\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Golden State Warriors\n\nPosition : Point guard\n\nGolden State Warriors: 2001–2003\n\nBefore gaining fame as a Washington Wizard, Gilbert Arenas began his NBA journey as a second-round pick for the Golden State Warriors in 2001. Known for his scoring ability and unique playing style, Arenas quickly made an impact during his two seasons with the team. Winning the NBA's Most Improved Player Award after the 2002-2003 season, Arenas' time with the Warriors was brief but impactful, highlighting his potential as one of the league's most exciting players.\n\nBirthplace : Baltimore, USA, Maryland\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Point guard\n\nGolden State Warriors: 1997–1999\n\nStanding at a mere 5'3\", Muggsy Bogues was the shortest player in NBA history, but his size did not deter him from making an impact on the court. Acquired by the Warriors in a trade during the 1997-1998 season, Bogues' speed, vision, and relentless energy made him a fan favorite in Golden State. His time with the team was short-lived, but Bogues' larger-than-life presence on the court defied his small stature and continues to inspire undersized players to this day."
