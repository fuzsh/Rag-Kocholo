        "text": "This column was originally published on March 1, 2004.\n\nACT I\n\n\"The Pistol\"\n\nA wide-eyed little boy sits on the floor, mesmerized by images on a television screen. He cradles a basketball. The boy's lower jaw points toward the floor, the corners of his mouth turn toward his raised eyebrows. He is a snapshot of pure joy as he watches the movie scene unfold.\n\nOff camera, a man's voice is heard: \"Shaun! Time for bed!\"\n\nFade to black, as the muted cadence of a basketball whacking pavement on the video grows louder and real. . . .\n\nScene 1\n\nLittle Shaun Livingston hangs out the passenger window of his father's car, re-enacting a scene from his favorite video, about the late basketball superstar \"Pistol\" Pete Maravich.\n\nAs Reggie Livingston drives slowly through the Peoria High School parking lot, Shaun dribbles his ball out the window. The faster the car rolls, Shaun learns, the further ahead he must push the ball for it to meet his hand for the next dribble.\n\nIt is but one of dozens of drills the boy will execute thousands of times in his life. Visions of them unfold:\n\nAs a toddler, he shoots a miniature Duke University logo basketball through a kiddie hoop in the back yard of his Great-Grandma Crooks' home on Fifth Street. A little older, he dribbles two balls simultaneously. By age 7, Shaun dribbles between his legs - back and forth, back and forth - as he walks with his father to the store. On the way home, he carries groceries in one hand and dribbles with the other, switching up every block or so.\n\nOne night, Reggie wakes up, as parents sometimes do, and checks Shaun's room. The kid is gone. He looks downstairs by the TV, no Shaun. Looks in the back yard, no Shaun. Walks to the front of the house and peers down the street. Cutting in and out of the shadows is a small figure, dribbling a basketball. The stacatto of ball on sidewalk punctuates the predawn silence.\n\n\"Shaun,\" father says to his smiling son. \"Get back to bed!\"\n\nScene 2\n\nIt's 1991. Frank Livingston, ex-Marine and Korean War veteran, keeps a tidy brick home on Orange Street. His son Reggie and only grandson, Shaun, are living with him, now that Frank's mother, Marie Crooks, has passed.\n\nFrank is unapologetically old school. His own father had died of tuberculosis when Frank was 2, leaving him and his infant sister to be raised by a single mother during the Depression. Opportunities were sparse, especially so for blacks in an era of segregation. But the children grew up loved and learned right from wrong. They learned life is what you make of it.\n\nIn his bright, effusive grandson, Frank sees a scholar. Education is important. It's the route to a better life. So Shaun is enrolled at Concordia Lutheran School, in north Peoria. Shaun's kindergarten teacher is Ruth Ruppert, and the boy takes an immediate liking to her. They talk often. It's not long before she introduces Shaun, his father and grandfather to her husband, Tom. A bond forms. Shaun is baptized, and the Rupperts stand as his godparents.\n\nMeanwhile, Ruth notices Shaun and his male classmates are extraordinarily into sports; talking them, playing them, living them. She tells her husband, who is the school athletics director and varsity basketball coach: \"When these boys get to eighth grade, you're going to have a great team.\"\n\nScene 3\n\nShaun is 10 years old. He's hanging out at the Concordia gym, where his dad and other adults are warming up for their weekly Sunday night pickup run. At starting time, only nine men are on hand, so they ask Shaun to fill in.\n\nNot wanting to muscle a little kid, the men let him roam the perimeter - until he starts swishing 3-pointers. So they start to step up on him - and he breaks their ankles with preposterously precocious crossovers before dishing to open teammates.\n\nSuddenly, Shaun starts to strut.\n\n\"Nice shot, Tom!\" he calls out, and immediately Reggie grabs the ball. Play stops. The father's face goes hard, his voice cold.\n\n\"Shaun!\" he scolds. \"What did you call him?\"\n\nShaun bows his head, then looks up, message received.\n\n\"Sorry, Mr. Ruppert,\" he says.\n\nScene 4\n\nShaun is a happy kid and unfailingly polite. Every request is accompanied by a \"please,\" every helping hand by a \"thank you.\" His grades are good. He sings in choirs. He plays basketball at the YMCA, then in the Biddy program; baseball in the Richwoods little league. He also enjoys soccer and football.\n\nBut Reggie is unhappy, because Concordia won't allow his son to play on a school basketball team until sixth grade. He also expresses concern to friends about the school's nearly all-white enrollment and the diversity education his mixed-race son is missing. So he transfers Shaun to Roosevelt, a South Side magnet school in Peoria's public District 150.\n\nRoosevelt is a perennial grade-school powerhouse in basketball, and Shaun makes the lightweight roster in fourth grade. His game grows under the tutelage of coach Lee Powers.\n\nHis personality also sprouts an edge. Shaun is accustomed to challenges on the basketball court, where he has learned to protect his dribble and stay on his game. That's fun. But now he faces challenges off the court, and they're not fun. Shaun has never given a thought to being a bi-racial child, but to some of his new classmates, it appears to be an issue. Frank is not happy with what he sees.\n\nFrank: \"Color doesn't have a damn thing to do with who a person is. It's stupid.\"\n\nSo is the perception that Shaun, coming from a private school, is a child of privilege. But the daily challenges he faces are very real, and he must learn to deal with them. The experience changes him, some for better, some for worse.\n\nShaun: \"Roosevelt was a lot different from Concordia. It was a lot more survival. On the good side, it makes you tougher, makes you appreciate the little things you have: family, home, love. A lot of the kids at Roosevelt didn't have that. Coming to the South End like I did, they look at you as the preppie kid, and they want to take that from you. You have to be strong. On the bad side, you can get caught up in that stuff, where you're not focusing on the right things.\"\n\nShaun loses focus on his schoolwork. His grades slip, and in the Livingston household, that's unacceptable. For sixth grade, Shaun returns to Concordia.\n\nMeanwhile, Manual High School is coming off a record run of four state basketball championships. The Rams' senior point guard, Frank Williams, is about to be named 1998 Illinois Mr. Basketball.\n\nAround town, Shaun already is being hyped as Peoria's next great player. At the high schools, where he hangs out and watches practices. At open gyms in the summertime. At Gus Macker 3-on-3 events. On the playgrounds.\n\nAt Carver Community Center, he plays regularly against boys several years older. Though he's tall for his age, nobody mistakes him for one of the high schoolers with whom he hangs. They call him \"Shorty,\" but it doesn't take long for an addendum:\n\n\"Shorty got game.\"\n\nShaun struggles to shoot over the taller boys, but since third grade, his ball-handling and passing skills have surpassed what anyone has seen from a kid so young.\n\nScene 5\n\nImages of Shaun slashing past hapless defenders, dribbling between his legs and theirs, dropping dimes behind his back to teammates, laughing with friends, endearing himself to adults.\n\nTom Ruppert: \"I never saw him put down another kid, and it would have been so easy for him to do that. His manners, demeanor and behavior to teachers was ingrained in him from early on.\"\n\nPeoria High coach Chuck Buescher: \"A lot of times, you look at kids who are 9 or 10 who dominate, and it's because they're more physically developed. This kid was not. He was long, and he was just so much better.\"\n\nACT II\n\n\"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\"\n\nA man sits in front of his television, intent on more than the plotline in the classic 1960s movie starring Debbie Reynolds. Frank Livingston loves movies, and this is one of his favorites.\n\nFrank: \"It shows what money can do to you, and what happens when you forget who you are and try to be somebody you're not.\"\n\nScene 1\n\nShaun is still in grade school, but there's no keeping his abundant basketball talent a secret.\n\nEvery high school coach in Peoria knows him. Reggie takes him to their practices, open gyms and camps. When Shaun isn't studying the games of players like Mike Robinson, Frank Williams and A.J. Guyton, he's mesmerizing the coaches with his own skills. They try not to make a big deal of what they see in him, but the things he can do with a basketball quickens their pulse.\n\nUnfortunately, so does Reggie. The father calls the coaches, pesters them; always asking what they think of his son. The coaches believe Shaun is being shopped. They privately articulate their disdain for how the father handles his kid, but they give the process credence by making regular appearances at Shaun's games.\n\nReggie insists he simply wants to expose Shaun to different coaching systems and provide him playing opportunities that will make him better. Bottom line: Reggie is motivated, first and foremost, by a desire to provide his son the best education, the best coaching, the best route to becoming a good person and a good player. But he never seems secure, and he constantly seeks affirmation of the boy's talent as he asks friends, \"What do you think? Where should he go to high school?\"\n\nScene 2\n\nEnter Verdell Jones, a boyhood friend of Reggie's who had remained close through the time Shaun was born. Verdell had moved out of the area for several years, but he's back, and he becomes a fixture wherever Shaun plays.\n\nVerdell has charisma and connections. Talent evaluator Clark Francis is tipped off about Shaun's ball-handling magic and suddenly, the young Peorian is ranked in \"Hoop Scoop\" as the second-best seventh-grade basketball player in the United States.\n\nTom Ruppert: \"How do they do that? And why rank kids in grade school? What a tremendous amount of pressure to put a kid under.\"\n\nThe word is out. Shaun is exposed. From coast to coast, hoops junkies know his name and talk about his game, even if they can't pick him out of a school lunch line.\n\nA videotape winds up in the hands of journalists Dan Wetzel and Don Yaeger, as they research their book, \"Sole Influence,\" an investigation of the corporate war between shoe kings adidas and Nike to identify and seduce tomorrow's superstar endorsers at as young an age as possible. The authors devote a page attesting to Shaun's skill and the competition among promoters to secure his commitment to their showcase camps.\n\nScene 3\n\nAt Concordia, Ruth Ruppert's kindergarten prediction is coming true.\n\nAll the kids on the team know Shaun is \"the bomb,\" but the rest are excellent athletes and solid ballers, too. The roster includes future Richwoods quarterback Greg Knapp, IVC baseball standout Danny Schroeder, Brimfield sharpshooter Ryan Stewart and Peoria High football/baseball centerpiece Nick Storm.\n\nThough Shaun is tall for his age - he grows from 5-feet-6 in sixth grade to an even 6 feet in eighth - he is not the tallest on the team, and certainly not physically imposing. With every inch he grows upward, he seems to get skinnier. By eighth grade, he's no longer pencil-thin; he's more like the lead inside the pencil.\n\nBut his game is in another universe. Whether he scores or not, he's a lockdown MVP in every tournament as the Cougars win back-to-back Lutheran Sports Association state championships. His attitude is every bit as praiseworthy.\n\nNation's best player in their grade? To his classmates, he is just their friend Shaun.\n\nTom Ruppert: \"He enjoys seeing others score, as much as scoring himself. He was so tickled when (teammate) Mitch Burmeister made a steal and scored the points that put us ahead in the state championship game in seventh grade; that Mitch got the glory. I'll never forget that.\"\n\nScene 4\n\nAlleged shopping aside, Shaun wants to go to Richwoods.\n\nShaun: \"That's where most of my friends from Concordia were going. And I had played with Kedric (Meredith) and Landon (Humbles) and those guys.\"\n\nPlus, the Knights have supplanted Manual as the hot program in Peoria. They placed fourth at state last season, and have a lot of talent returning.\n\nSo Reggie and Shaun move out of Grandpa's house, a short walk from Peoria High, and into an apartment in the Richwoods district.\n\nAlmost immediately, problems surface. Shaun is now 6-feet-3, but - though it hardly seems possible - even skinnier. He looks as if a spring breeze could carry him to Oz. He struggles under the control of coach Bobby Darling, and he rebels. His playing time rises, then falls. His practice effort decreases. He breaks a hand, then a foot. When he recovers, the Knights are back in the state quarterfinals, but his role is limited.\n\nShaun: \"I wasn't physically strong enough, or mentally ready for that level, and when that happens, (rivals) eat you alive.\"\n\nThe buzz is in full saw now: Shaun ain't all that. He's a washout. Another overhyped phenom. Next Frank Williams? Better than Howard Nathan? A joke.\n\nShaun plays the summer AAU circuit with the St. Louis Eagles, but he spends most of his down time in Urbana, living with Verdell, whom he calls his godfather. Rumors surface that he'll move there permanently, get his dad to relinquish guardianship.\n\n\"Don't believe the hype,\" Shaun says, and he returns to Richwoods.\n\nBut a surly edge builds inside of him, and coaches, family and friends start to worry about the new company he keeps. It's turning into an entourage.\n\nShaun's sophomore season is a bust, complicated by a series of ankle injuries and a bout with pneumonia. Off the court, people are whispering. Everybody has a theory. He's fragile. He's a slacker. People tell Reggie that Coach Darling is ruining Shaun. The relationship between coach and player dissolves.\n\nReggie and Verdell meet with Coach Darling, who is struck by the fact that Verdell does all the talking. Frustrated, the coach tells Reggie: \"You're Shaun's father; not Verdell.\"\n\nIn the spring, Coach Darling suggests it might be best for everyone if Shaun were to leave Richwoods and start somewhere else with a clean slate. Shaun wants to stay and prove his detractors wrong, but the bridges have been destroyed and appear irreparable.\n\nShaun: \"My freshman and sophomore years, I thought I couldn't play under this guy. We just butted heads. But a big part of it was the immaturity of me.\"\n\nHe transfers to Peoria High before the spring semester ends and ultimately returns to his grandfather's home on Orange Street.\n\nScene 5\n\nIn the summer, Shaun rebuilds his playing rep on the national scene, leading Verdell's Ft. Sooy AAU team. But the questions persist: Is he coachable? Can he perform at a high level in a structured team system?\n\nCoach Buescher: \"When he came to us, as a junior, his back was to the wall, and his reputation was not very good. He was not an easy kid to like, or an easy kid to coach. I finally told him: 'Son, the next step in your progression as a player has to be that you've got to be easier to coach.' \"\n\nShaun's presence elevates the Lions immediately. Disciplined and well-schooled in fundamentals, always hard-nosed, Buescher's Peoria High teams are notorious over-achievers. The additions of Shaun and Manual transfer Brandon Lee, joining all-state guard Daniel Ruffin, changes that. The Lions are tabbed a favorite to contend for the state championship, and their actual performance turns the predictions into reality.\n\nBefore a sellout crowd at Carver Arena and a statewide television audience, Shaun drives to the basket and scores the winning points with three seconds left in a 45-43 title-game victory over South Holland Thornwood.\n\nThe ensuing celebration shocks people who have known him since childhood and provides further grist for his detractors. Shaun sprints to his fellow PHS students and starts to scream profanities. One after another, they fly from his mouth, with live TV cameras providing viewers at home a class in lip-reading.\n\nShaun: \"TV made it look like I was disrespecting the opposing team, but that wasn't it at all. Everything just came out of me: 'All you haters, all you people who stopped believing in me . . .' I was trying to prove a point, that I can play and I'm not an attitude problem. I'm not saying you have to be a jerk off the court. I wasn't raised that way. At Concordia, we were taught to be great kids. But you get in the real world, and sometimes people take advantage of that kindness.\"\n\nACT III\n\n\"On the Waterfront\"\n\nFrank Livingston stares intently at the tormented soul of ex-prize fighter Terry Malloy, being portrayed by Marlon Brando. Malloy laments the payoffs he got to take dives in the ring.\n\n\"You don't understand, Charley,\" Malloy cries to the brother who made sure he got paid. \"I coulda had class and been somebody.\"\n\nScene 1\n\nDaniel Ruffin: \"Shaun tries so hard to please everybody that he takes away from himself.\"\n\nThe people who love Shaun most - immediate family, longtime friends, teachers, coaches, ministers - are worried.\n\nThe 2003 summer basketball season is in full gear, and Shaun is dominant everywhere he plays. Now pushing 6-feet-7, he is considered the premier point-guard prospect in America. The recruiting battle between Arizona, Duke, Illinois and North Carolina is hot. But that's the least of his real people's concerns.\n\nThey're worried about his conduct off the basketball courts. Sometimes, it seems, Shaun has forgotten everything they taught him. He'll turn 18 on Sept. 11, and he faces the same pressures as his peers - but magnified to the 10th power because of his celebrity and the earning potential posed by his talent. His will to please others, the endearing trait that makes him the consummate team player on the court, threatens to betray him off of it. Suspicious people have worked themselves into Shaun's life. \"Leeches\" is a favorite word. Temptations increase.\n\nFrank: \"Why would you want to be like everybody else, when everybody else wants to be like you?\"\n\nReggie: \"Every time I hear a police siren, I worry about Shaun. I don't want to go to bed worrying about my son. There are wolves out there.\"\n\nBut they're afraid Shaun isn't listening.\n\nFrank and Reggie decide to call a meeting. Close to 20 people attend, to try to impart some tough love to the young star, to make him realize how much is at stake, how one mistake could destroy his dream just as it is coming to reality. A notable invitee is Howard Nathan, former Manual star who briefly made it to the NBA.\n\nBesides being Illinois Mr. Basketball 1991, Nathan is a two-time college dropout with a criminal record. He long ago squandered his personal reputation in his hometown, but he is trying to build a new one.\n\nHoward Nathan: \"I told Shaun, 'You've got to have people around you who don't mind telling you the hard stuff. They're not your yes-boys. You need people to tell you, 'No.' Listen to them. Don't make the mistakes I made.' \"\n\nFamily and friends pray Shaun takes the message to heart.\n\nScene 2\n\nLong ago, Shaun mapped his own recruiting process. He would establish five or six finalists, visit each in the fall of his senior year, then make a decision only after taking time to fully weigh his options.\n\nOf course, no high-profile recruits actually follow through on such plans. They cancel visits, commit early, yield to pressure from the college coaches. So it's nothing short of stunning to watch Shaun refuse to deviate from his plan.\n\nEven more stunning is his ability to guard the final decision until he is ready to announce it. In an age when the media report news before the principals have a chance to commit it, there is no publication of his choice, no television or radio news flash, until a few seconds after Shaun himself ends the suspense at a news conference in the Peoria High library: \"I feel . . . Duke University is the best situation for me and my long-term goals.\"\n\nScene 3\n\nAs the Lions start practice to defend their state title, skeptics of Shaun's game remain abundant.\n\nMaybe it's because he's so fundamentally sound. Yes, he can perform all the flash: behind the back, between the legs, no-look, double-pump, sleight-of-hand stuff. But every trick emanates from the thousands of basic ball drills he performed as a child.\n\nAnd tucked into every pass and dribble is a surreal understanding of what's happening on the court and exactly what is required for his team to score. Bringing the ball up the court on a break, he surveys the positions and movements of every other player. By the time he crosses the center line, he has processed that vision and determined who's most likely to score, what pass and subsequent movements are most efficient to get the job done and where each player will be when the ball passes through the net.\n\nCoach Buescher: \"Some of that is God-given. It has to be. He has unbelievable feel for the game.\"\n\nThen Shaun executes with deft precision. The skeptics should play with him sometime. They would become quick converts.\n\nDaniel Ruffin: \"Most passers throw the ball so hard. The way Shaun throws it, he always has the defense going one way and the ball going the other. You expect it to be hard, but he gets it through traffic so soft. And it's very rare that you have to go out of your way to catch it.\"\n\nBrandon Lee: \"You have no choice but to be in awe of him. I actually have to ask myself sometimes, 'How did he do that?' \"\n\nScene 4\n\nThis could be jolting. Ann and Reggie Livingston divorced before Shaun was 2 years old. Reggie was awarded custody. Ann remarried and for nearly 15 years has had little or nothing to do with her son's life. Now Ann is back.\n\nReggie is skeptical, but Shaun is curious and open to establishing a relationship with his mom. He handles questions about her as easily as he schools an overmatched defender trying to steal the ball from him.\n\nShaun: \"It's going OK. I'm just trying to keep it steady. She understands I'm very, very busy right now. She's been great.\"\n\nScene 5\n\nNBA scouts attend Peoria High games to watch Shaun play.\n\nFor all his careful orchestration of his college recruitment, and despite the trend of NBA teams to draft and sign potential stars right out of high school, Shaun insists this is not something he fully anticipated. Maybe because playing in \"The League\" has always been his ultimate dream, he finds it difficult to fathom that a multimillion-dollar contract with his name on it might be less than four months in the future.\n\nShaun: \"The funny thing is, six months ago nobody was talking seriously about me going to the NBA. I wasn't planning for this.\"\n\nNow he is.\n\nHe tells everyone the most important item on his agenda is helping Peoria High defend its state championship this month. When the season is over, he'll play in a couple of all-star games. Then he'll sit down with the people he most trusts, seek their advice, and decide: Duke or the draft?\n\nHis inner circle is small, though not all of the members are on the best terms with each other at any given moment: Frank, Reggie, Verdell and his brother Artie, Coach Buescher, and Shaun's girlfriend, Amber Godfrey, a freshman at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nNo scout worth his evaluation notepad questions Shaun's handles. His dribble, his passes, his ability to see the floor and deliver the goods have been compared to Magic Johnson. Some scouts question his shot. Every scout knows he needs to put on weight and get stronger.\n\nIf Shaun decides to skip college and enter the draft, he will be selected in the first round. The only question is how early. A top-five pick, projected for Shaun by some Internet mock drafts, is guaranteed at least $7 million over three years; by the 15th position, the money is cut in half.\n\nA reporter asks Shaun how he'll decide.\n\nShaun: \"I've always dreamed of playing in the NBA, but I want to go when I'm ready, unless it's an unusual circumstance. If I see something in my game that can easily be improved, no question, I'll be at Duke. But it might be a bigger risk to go to college and try to play my way into a higher draft position.\n\n\"I'd be lying if I said it's not mostly about the money, but there are other benefits of going pro now, too. Day in and day out, I'd be working on my game at the best facilities in the world. At Duke, I'd have to manage my time with classes and things like that.\"\n\nHe smiles.\n\nScene 6\n\nShaun adores his grandfather and thoroughly trusts him. Frank is the one person in the world Shaun can be absolutely sure wants nothing from him.\n\nWhen Shaun announces to the nation he will sign with Duke, Frank stays home. When Shaun asks Frank to accompany him and Reggie onto the Peoria High basketball floor during introductions on Senior Night, Frank declines.\n\nFrank: \"Those moments are for Shaun and his dad.\"\n\nFrank never told Shaun which college to choose, but he also made no secret that his preference was Duke. Frank is just as blunt now.\n\nFrank: \"I'm 74 years old. Shaun wants me to see him play in the NBA. That gives me concern.\n\n\"I firmly believe that to make a better athlete, you have to make a better person. It's like baking a cake. You've got to have all the ingredients, but you've got to put them in at the right time. People like to say, 'Go pro, then you can still go to college later.' But it doesn't work that way.\n\n\"People seem to think money is the answer to all their troubles. I saw Anthony Quinn in a movie - what was it? I can't recall. But he said, 'I didn't have these problems when I didn't have any money.' You don't make a decision based on money. Forget the material things. Make a decision that's going to make you happy.\"\n\nEpilogue\n\nA wide-eyed little boy sits in front of a television, his arms cradling a ball. On the screen, \"Pistol\" Pete Maravich is performing basketball magic. Shaun Livingston's face is unadulterated joy.\n\nFade away."
