        "text": "Click HERE if you’re unable to view the gallery on your mobile device.\n\nOAKLAND — The Golden State Warriors announced Monday they won’t stick around to practice in their downtown Oakland basketball facility next season as they make their move to the under-construction Chase Center in San Francisco’s Mission Bay neighborhood a complete one.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean the Warriors are totally abandoning the city that’s been their physical home — if not their namesake — for almost half a century.\n\nThe team will still retain ownership of the facility and office space at 1011 Broadway, which is to be used for the team’s youth camps and to house nonprofits supported by the team’s community foundation, Warriors president Rick Welts said during a news conference. The Warriors will start using the facility for those purposes as early as the start of 2020, Welts said.\n\n“It’s an amazing opportunity to keep our footprint here in Oakland, to do amazing things for the next generation of kids that look up to us and what we do on the court,” Warriors superstar point guard Steph Curry said at the same news conference.\n\nThe Warriors also are teaming up with Kaiser Permanente to launch Generation Thrive, an initiative that will serve as an incubator for nonprofits focused on educational equity, college and career readiness, and health and wellness for underserved children, according to a news release from the team and health organization.\n\nKaiser Permanente is donating $5 million to kick off the initiative, and both it and the Warriors have agreed to a 20-year partnership on the project. Welts told this news organization that means the Warriors will keep the facility for at least the next 20 years.\n\n“You heard it here first. The Warriors are not leaving Oakland,” Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said at the press conference. “They may have built a place for them to play their games, but what is a team, who are champions? They’re not just people who win games on the court, they’re people who give back to their community.”\n\nFor Oakland-based Kaiser Permanente, Generation Thrive is the second big investment in the community in less than three months. In mid-January, Kaiser said it will spend $5.2 million to buy a 41-unit apartment building in East Oakland, a first step in an aggressive effort to shelter the homeless and improve health care for the poor.\n\nThis is the 48th season the Warriors have played at Oracle Arena, which has seen several name changes at the Oakland Coliseum Complex site. Despite its long run there, the team has been chided over the years for calling itself Golden State instead of Oakland.\n\nAnd its pending move to a shiny new high-priced center in San Francisco, a Willie May’s throw from the Giants ballpark, has drawn additional criticism for ditching a fan base that some say is one of the most loyal in the sports world.\n\nOakland Councilwoman Rebecca Kaplan said although she’s in favor of the Warriors supporting nonprofits, she doesn’t think it’s fair to “pretend that this means they aren’t really moving the team out of Oakland.”\n\n“They are abandoning fans who were passionately dedicated to them for years, who showed up and cheered even when they were not winning,” Kaplan told this news organization. “They are giving up the ‘Roaracle’ crowds, and they are taking the jobs, the tax revenue, and the profits away from Oakland, to move to an expensive and harder-to-access facility in San Francisco.”\n\nSince announcing the departure from Oracle, team officials and players have stressed that the team is leaving “a building, not a city.” The Chase Center — which cost more than $1 billion to build — will include a practice facility and office space.\n\n“The way we’ve described our move is we’re a building, we’re not leaving a city … now we’re putting some real actions behind those words,” Welts said."
