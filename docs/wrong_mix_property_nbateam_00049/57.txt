Kerith Burke of NBC Sports Authentic reported by tweet: “The Livingstons had their baby.” The one-sentence message was followed by a blue-heart emoji, signaling Warriors guard Shaun Livingston and wife Joanna (who goes by Joey), welcomed a baby boy into their family.

An utterly precious photo on Livingston’s Instagram confirms the birth of Jonah Jazmine Livingston, the couple’s second child.

Shaun Livingston and Joanna Williams were married in August 2017. They are also parents to Tyler Williams, who turned two just this week, which Livingston celebrated with the hashtag #terrifictwos.
