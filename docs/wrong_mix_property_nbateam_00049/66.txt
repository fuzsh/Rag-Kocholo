ORLANDO — The front end of a Florida back-to-back for the Warriors tips off at noon local time in Orlando on Sunday.

“Feels like 9 a.m.,” Kerr said, referring to the time it’ll tip back in the Bay Area. “Maybe 10.”

The early start at least gives the team a jumpstart on its travel down to Miami for the back end of this back-to-back on Monday night. But Kerr is still taking precautionary measures with a couple of his veterans.

Shaun Livingston will rest against the Magic on Sunday and Andre Iguodala will “possibly” rest against the Heat on Monday, Kerr said. Livingston joins David West on the inactive list. West is out with a fractured thumb.
