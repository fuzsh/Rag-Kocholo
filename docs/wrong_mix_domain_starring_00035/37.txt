Honor Society, “Camp Rock” actress Meaghan Jette Martin and R&B singer Mateo will reward students at Rio Vista Elementary School in Anaheim on Tuesday for working hard to improve their reading skills.

Reuben Skipper, a parent volunteer at the school, said students who met the incentive program goals were promised a good prize, though it wasn’t until Friday that plans for the event finally came together.

“I’ve been checking aroudn with all the different publicists and agents,” he says. “And I got in touch with the Jonas Brothers (management group) and they liked the idea and put together the idea of getting a few people to come over.”
