She began her career in the theatre and then moved on to French cinema. Between 1951 and 1958 she appeared in about twenty, mainly French films, but she also acted in a few Italian and American films.\n\nChristiane Èlisabeth Jeanne Marie Pelleterat de Borde, known as Christine Carrère or Christine Carère was born in Dijon in 1930. She began acting in the theatre, then moved on to French cinema. In 1951, she had a small role in Olivia/The Pit of Loneliness (Jacqueline Audry, 1951), starring Edwige Feuillère and Simone Simon. The film, based on the 1950 semi-autobiographical novel of the same name by Dorothy Bussy, is a landmark of lesbian representation. Between 1951 and 1958 Carère appeared in about twenty films.

In Italy, she acted between 1953 and 1954, in the coming-of-age comedy-drama Terza liceo/High School (Luciano Emmer, 1954), and the melodrama Una donna libera/A Free Woman (Vittorio Cottafavi, 1954) starring Françoise Christophe. Back in France, she played the female lead in the musical comedy Tout chante autour de moi/Everything sings around me (Pierre Gout, 1954) which was the debut film vehicle for the pop star Mouloudji. She also co-starred with the French singer Georges Guétary in the French-German romantic comedy Le chemin du paradis/The Road to Paradise (Willi Forst, Hans Wolff, 1956), the French version of the German film Die Drei von der Tankstelle/The Three from the Filling Station (Hans Wolff, 1955), which was itself a remake of a 1930 film.

In 1957 she married French actor and singer Philippe Nicaud and two years after her marriage she left the cinema. Her final film was the American musical comedy A Private's Affair (Raoul Walsh, 1959), starring Sal Mineo. In the 1960s she acted mainly in television serials. In the US, she starred with Robert Goulet in the spy series Blue Light (1966) about the adventures of an American double agent in Nazi Germany during World War II.

AX 4213. Photo: 20th Century Fox. Pat Boone in Journey to the Center of the Earth (Henri Levin, 1959).\n\nPat Boone (1934) is an American singer and actor who was the second-biggest charting artist of the late 1950s, behind only Elvis Presley. Initially, he performed Rock and Roll, but later in his career, he switched to gospel music. Over the years he has had many hit songs including 'Moody River', 'Speedy Gonzales', and 'Bernardine. He sold more than 45 million records, had 38 Top 40 hits, and appeared in more than 12 Hollywood films.\n\nCharles Eugene Patrick (Pat) Boone was born in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1934. His father, Archie Altman Boone, was a building contractor and his mother, Margaret Virginia (née Pritchard), was a nurse. His younger brother, Nick Boone, also had a popular music career under the name Nick Todd. Pat grew up in Nashville, Tennessee, and attended David Lipscombe College, North Texas State College and Columbia University from which he received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1958. Boone began his career by performing in Nashville's Centennial Park and started recording for Republic Records in 1954. In 1955 he released a cover of the single 'Ain't That a Shame' by Fats Domino, and significantly broke the sales records of the original version. A number-one single in 1956 by Boone was a second cover and a revival of a then seven-year-old song 'I Almost Lost My Mind', by Ivory Joe Hunter, which was originally covered by another black star, Nat King Cole. It is representative of the early period of Boone's career, which mainly focused on polishing rhythm-and-blues hits into more accessible versions, allowing the Rock and Roll tunes to reach a much wider audience. Boone was also criticised for his homogenised, sanitized versions. He succeeded in removing all of the more suggestive lyrics from his cover of Little Richard's 'Long Tall Sally'. He changed the original's, \"I saw Uncle John with Long Tall Sally,/He saw Aunt Mary comin' and he ducked back in the alley\" to, \"Long Tall Sally's got a lot on the ball,/And nobody cares if she's long and tall.\" However, Little Richard himself once said: \"It was Pat Boone who made me a millionaire\". Boone had the image of a fresh-faced smooth guy, who appealed to both teenagers and their parents. His singing style, a full baritone, followed in the footsteps of his idol Bing Crosby. Soon he switched more and more to singing ballads. At the end of the 1950s, Pat Boone was only surpassed in popularity by Elvis Presley. And just like Elvis, he made an attempt at some acting. Although he made considerably fewer films than Elvis, it is said that his films were of considerably higher quality. Several film studios pursued him and he decided to go with 20th Century Fox, which had made Elvis Presley's first film. Fox reworked the play 'Bernardine' into a vehicle for Boone. The resulting film, Bernardine (Henry Levin, 1957), with Terry Moore and Janet Gaynor, was a solid hit, earning $3.75 million in the US. His recording for the title song of his second film, April Love (Henry Levin, 1957), in which he co-starred with Shirley Jones, was nominated for an Oscar. At the age of 23, he began hosting a half-hour ABC variety television series, The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom, which aired for 115 episodes (1957–1960). His recording of 'A Wonderful Time Up There' in 1958 became the first million-selling record with religious lyrics. Seeing himself as a devout born-again Christian, he refused music and film roles that went against his moral standards, including roles with the then-sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. In each of his film contracts, there was a term specifying that kissing his partner could not be forced on him by the director due to his religious convictions. Less popular was the musical comedy Mardi Gras (Edmund Goulding, 1958) with Christine Carère. However, the Science-Fiction adventure, Journey to the Center of the Earth (Henri Levin, 1959), with James Mason and Arlene Dahl, was a huge hit.\n\nPat Boone wrote the lyrics for the title song for the film Exodus (Otto Preminger, 1960), which he titled 'This Land Is Mine'. He produced and starred in a documentary, Salute to the Teenagers (1960), but did not make a film for a while, studying acting with Sanford Meisner. He returned with a military comedy, All Hands on Deck (Norman Taurog, 1961), a mild hit. He starred opposite Bobby Darin and Ann-Margret in another remake, State Fair (José Ferrer, 1962), but it was another box office disappointment. Musicals were becoming less fashionable in Hollywood. An invasion of British pop groups such as The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, and The Kinks ended Pat Boone's career as a hit machine, although he continued to make records in the 1960s. During the early 1960s, Boone starred in a handful of British films, produced by his own Cooga Mooga productions. In one of these, The Yellow Canary (1963), he attempted to shake up his established image by portraying a nasty, ill-tempered rock star. In the 1960s, he also began writing self-help books for adolescents, including the best-seller 'Twixt Twelve and Twenty'. In the 1970s, he switched to gospel music and country and continued to perform in other media, especially radio. Later, he was a disc jockey for a popular American old-time radio station and runs his own record company, which re-releases records from the 1950s that no longer have a place on major record labels. Boone married Shirley Lee Foley, daughter of Red Foley, in 1953 and they had four daughters: Cherry, Lindy, Debby and Laury. In the 1960s and 1970s, the family toured as gospel artists and made gospel albums such as 'The Pat Boone Family' and 'The Family Who Prays'. In 1997, Boone released an album entitled 'No More Mr. Nice Guy', which featured a collection of heavy metal covers polished to fit the Pat Boone style. To advertise the album, he appeared at the American Music Awards ceremony in black leather. He lost his respectable image in one fell swoop, at least among large sections of his following among conservative Christians. Because of this action, he was fired from Gospel America, a television programme of the Trinity Broadcasting Network. However, the music from this CD was often used during the intermission of hard rock and heavy metal concerts, and the CD was appreciated by the somewhat older guard of hard rockers who saw the humour in it and could appreciate the performance of the songs, which included a choir and a full orchestra. In 2003, his gospel recordings were recognised by Nashville's Gospel Music Association and added to the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. Boone lived in Los Angeles for many years with his wife Shirley Foley. They were influential members of the 'Church on the Road', the Inglewood Church of Christ in San Fernando Valley. Shirley (84) passed away in January 2019, they had been married for 65 years.\n\nSources: Hal Erickson (AllMovie), Wikipedia (Dutch and English), and IMDb.\n\nAnd, please check out our blog European Film Star Postcards.\n\nFrench postcard by Ste.

The gorgeous actress appeared in a surprisingly large amount of films from the mid-1950’s to the mid 1980’s.\n\nDominique Boschero was born in Paris, France in 1934. She is the sister of actor-producer Martial Boschero. Their parents were Italian and when World War II broke out, the 5-year old Dominique was trusted in the hands of her grandparents in Frassino, a small Italian mountain village with a few hundred of inhabitants. There she grew up. At 15, she returned to Paris and started to work as a janitor in a hospital and later as a seamstress. With her tall length and her dark beauty she found work as a model. Soon her beautiful face was on the covers of Paris’ premiere fashion magazines. At the age of 18, she made her stage debut as a showgirl at the Paris music-hall La Nouvelle Eve (The New Eve). She also played small or uncredited roles in French films, such as Club de Femmes/Club of Women (1956, Ralph Habib) with Nicole Courcel and Dany Carrel, but a year later she had a bigger part in Printemps a Paris/Springtime in Paris (1957, Jean-Claude Roy) with Christine Carère and Philippe Nicaud. She got another bigger role in Delannoy's Le baron de l'ecluse/The Baron of the Locks (1960, Jean Delannoy) starring Jean Gabin and Micheline Presle. Following an interview with the Italian magazine Epoca she was noticed by an Italian producer, who invited her to come to the capital of the European cinema at the time, Rome.\n\nDominique Boschero headed off to Italy, beginning her Italian career with the western comedy Un dollaro di fifa/A Dollar of Funk (1960, Giorgio Simonelli), a spoof of Rio Bravo (1959, Howard Hawks), which also starred Ugo Tognazzi and Walter Chiari. She then appeared in a few peplums (sword and sandal films). Most notably was her winning performance as 'Queen of the Bird Men' in Ulisse contro Ercole/Ulysses Against Hercules (1962, Mario Caiano) starring Georges Marchal. Then she made a major impact as femme fatale in several spy films. She appeared in early German/Italian examples of the genre such as Heißer Hafen Hong Kong/Hong Kong Hot Harbor (1962, Jürgen Roland) with Marianne Koch, and Das geheimnis der chinesischen Nelke/The Secret of the Chinese Carnation (1964, Rudolf Zehetgruber) starring Paul Dahlke. In the latter she appeared as a voluptuous vamp in a deadly plot of three different groups of plotting agents. They all chase after a microfilm with a secret formula for a new rocket fuel. Then, she appeared opposite Giancarlo Giannini in his film debut, the interesting thriller Libido (1965, Ernesto Gastaldi, Vittorio Salerno). Boschero played another leading role in Furia in Marakech/Fury at Marrakesh (1966, Mino Loy, Luciano Martino). According to Tom Lisanti and Louis Paul, authors of the study Film Fatales, her ‘ultimate screen appearance’, was “her screen-stealing turn in the bizarre uninhibited wacky, wild and completely unbelievable secret agent-super hero hybrid” Come Rubare la Corona d’Inghilterra/Argoman the Fantastic Superman (1967, Sergio Grieco). Boschero at first appears as a seemingly lost and helpless woman who seduces Argoman (Roger Browne) and then turns out to be a mastermind villain. At the climax of the film, she sadistically tortures Argoman and tries to remove his magic powers permanently. At IMDb, reviewer Gulaq-2 writes: “A CAMP classic of maximum proportions, which ruled the world in the late sixties, conquering all the known B-movies markets”.\n\nIn the 1970’s, Dominique Boschero continued popping up in a few giallos, e.g. Chi l'ha vista morire?/Who Saw Her Die (1972, Aldo Lado) starring former James Bond George Lazenby, and Tutti i colori del buio/All the Colors of the Dark (1972, Sergio Martino) with George Hilton and Edwige Fenech. She also appeared in the spaghetti western Los buitres cavarán tu fosa/And the Crows Will Dig Your Grave (1972, Juan Bosch), the Italian-Belgian sex comedy Je suis une call-girl/I am a call-girl (1973, Jack Guy), and the horror film Il prato macchiato di rosso/The Bloodstained Lawn (1973, Riccardo Ghione) with Nino Castelnuovo. IMDb reviewer Babycarrot67 calls this horror film a guilty pleasure: “An obvious commentary on the rich and powerful exploiting the more unfortunate members of society, this film does not take itself very seriously, and most of the cast, especially Marina Malfatti as one of the aristocrats, appears to be having a good time. The film's claustrophobic atmosphere gives it just enough feeling of unease to make it a credible horror film, and the film's overall weirdness and eccentricity help it cross over the finish line of viewer satisfaction. This film could be the definition of a motion picture \"guilty pleasure\" although one should not feel guilty during the viewing.” . Boschero had a romance with Claudio Camaso (Claudio Volonté), the brother of actor Gianmaria Volonté. Camaso was involved with an alleged bomb in the Vatican. This scandal and her cursed relationship with the actor who eventually committed suicide in jail in 1977, slowed down her career. In 1974 Boschero retired from the cinema and withdrew to Frassino. She later would have a relation with the singer Franco Califano. In 1986 she returned on television in the soap series Passioni/Passions (1986, Riccardo Donna). Dominique Boschero lives in Frassino, North-West Italy, where she is involved in the investigation and preservation of the occitan language. From the end of the 1960’s she is interested in this subject after meeting François Fontan, founder of the Parti nationaliste occitan, and the poet Antonio Bodrero (Barba Toni Baudrier).\n\nSources: Tom Lisanti and Louis Paul (Film Fatales: women in espionage films and television, 1962-1973), European Film Review, Wikipedia (French and Italian) and IMDb.\n\nFrench postcard by Editions P.I., Paris, presented by Les Carboines Korès \"Carboplane\", no. 940.

Between 1951 and 1958 she appeared in about twenty, mainly French films, but she also acted in a few Italian and American films.\n\nChristiane Èlisabeth Jeanne Marie Pelleterat de Borde, known as Christine Carrère or Christine Carère was born in Dijon in 1930. She began acting in the theatre, then moved on to French cinema. In 1951, she had a small role in Olivia/The Pit of Loneliness (Jacqueline Audry, 1951), starring Edwige Feuillère and Simone Simon. The film, based on the 1950 semi-autobiographical novel of the same name by Dorothy Bussy, is a landmark of lesbian representation. Between 1951 and 1958 Carère appeared in about twenty films. She had a supporting part in the French historical comedy Un caprice de Caroline chérie/A Caprice of Darling Caroline (Jean Devaivre, 1953) starring Martine Carol. In Italy, she acted between 1953 and 1954, in the coming-of-age comedy-drama Terza liceo/High School (Luciano Emmer, 1954), and the melodrama Una donna libera/A Free Woman (Vittorio Cottafavi, 1954) starring Françoise Christophe. Back in France, she played the female lead in the musical comedy Tout chante autour de moi/Everything sings around me (Pierre Gout, 1954) which was the debut film vehicle for the pop star Mouloudji. She also co-starred with the French singer Georges Guétary in the French-German romantic comedy Le chemin du paradis/The Road to Paradise (Willi Forst, Hans Wolff, 1956), the French version of the German film Die Drei von der Tankstelle/The Three from the Filling Station (Hans Wolff, 1955), which was itself a remake of a 1930 film. She then appeared with Fernandel and Carmen Sevilla in the historical comedy Don Juan (John Berry, 1956), a co-production between France, Italy, and Spain, based on the legend of Don Juan.\n\nChristine Carère was brought to Hollywood to appear in A Certain Smile (Jean Negulesco, 1958), starring Rossano Brazzi and Joan Fontaine. She then starred opposite singer Pat Boone in the American musical comedy Mardi Gras (Edmund Goulding, 1958). But her American career was brief. In 1957 she married French actor and singer Philippe Nicaud and two years after her marriage she left the cinema. Her final film was the American musical comedy A Private's Affair (Raoul Walsh, 1959), starring Sal Mineo. In the 1960s she acted mainly in television serials. In the US, she starred with Robert Goulet in the spy series Blue Light (1966) about the adventures of an American double agent in Nazi Germany during World War II. It was credited for its gritty depiction of espionage in World War II and for the difficult moral choices it posed. A theatrical movie, I Deal in Danger, was created by editing Blue Light's first four episodes together into a continuous story, and was released in 1966 after Blue Light's cancellation. In 1985, Carère's name reappeared, when she and her husband were among the screenwriters of the comedy La cage aux folles 3 - 'Elles' se marient/La Cage aux Folles 3: The Wedding (Georges Lautner, 1985), the third and final installment in the La Cage aux Folles series with Michel Serrault and Ugo Tognazzi.

Photo: Margit Saad in Der Zigeunerbaron/The Gypsy Baron (Arthur Maria Rabenalt, 1954).\n\nGerman actress Margit Saad (1929) was a mysterious, exotic beauty, who worked largely in German film and television. During the 1960s, she also made occasional English-language appearances.\n\nMargit Daisy Saad was born in Munich, Bavaria in 1929. She is the daughter of the Lebanese language professor Fuad Jabbour Saad and German language teacher Agnes Saad, born Diepgen. Margit studied acting at the Otto-Falckenberg-Schule in Munich. To finance her studies, she worked as a model. She had her first stage engagement in Düsseldorf and made her screen debut in the Austrian comedy Eva erbt das Paradies... ein Abenteuer im Salzkammergut/Eva Inherits Paradise (Franz Antel, 1951), starring Maria Andergast. She also appeared as a nun in the West German drama Hinter Klostermauern/The Unholy Intruders (Harald Reinl, 1952) starring Olga Tschechowa, Frits van Dongen (a.k.a.k Philp Dorn) and Katharina Mayberg. She played leading roles in the romantic musical Südliche Nächte/Southern Nights (Robert A. Stemmle, 1953), the operetta Baron Tzigane/Gypsy Baron (Arthur Maria Rabenalt, 1954) with Georges Guétary, and the romantic comedy Drei Mädels vom Rhein (Ernst Jacoby, 1955). In the Swedish-German coproduction Sommarflickan (Håkan Bergström, Thomas Engel, 1955), she had a part opposite Maj-Britt Nilsson and Karlheinz Böhm. A popular success was the West German crime-comedy Peter Voss, der Millionendieb/Peter Voss, Thief of Millions (Wolfgang Becker, 1958) featuring O.W. Fischer. It was based on the 1913 novel Peter Voss, Thief of Millions by Ewald Gerhard Seeliger, which had been previously adapted into three films. In France, she appeared in Les dragueurs/The Dredgers (Jean-Pierre Mocky, 1959). Other films that year were Heiße Ware/Hot goods (Paul May, 1959) with Ivan Desny, and the teen musical Melodie und Rhythmus/ Melody and Rhythms (John Olden, 1959) with teen idol Peter Kraus.\n\nIn 1960 Margit Saad starred in the British drama The Criminal (Joseph Losey, 1960) with Stanley Baker and Sam Wanamaker. Mario Gauci at IMDb: “While essentially character-driven, the film's seedy milieu and sadistic streak allows for a number of vivid sequences (though the race-track robbery itself is rather thrown away!) including the wild party held at Baker's flat on being released from prison (highlighting sexy Margit Saad who subsequently replaces Jill Bennett as Baker's moll), the equally chaotic prison riot, Baker's escape from the penitentiary (having been betrayed after the robbery and recaptured) and the inevitable showdown with the ruthless Wanamaker.” She followed it up with appearances in other British films such as The Rebel (Robert Day, 1961) with Tony Hancock and George Sanders, and the low budget thriller Playback (Quentin Lawrence, 1962). The latter was one of a series of British films based on Edgar Wallace novels, released between 1960 and 1965. On TV she appeared opposite Roger Moore in an episode of The Saint, The Saint Sees It Through (Robert S. Baker, 1964). And in the cinema, she supported TV comedians Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise in The Magnificent Two (Cliff Owen, 1967). In Germany, she co-starred with Stewart Granger in the Edgar Wallace crime film Das Geheimnis der drei Dschunken/Code Name Alpha (Ernst Hofbauer, 1965). In 1966, Saad appeared in an episode of the American television espionage series Blue Light, starring Robert Goulet and Christine Carere. It was edited together with three other episodes into the feature film I Deal in Danger (Walter Grauman, 1966), which includes her appearance. Later she also appeared in Grauman’s war film The Last Escape (Walter Grauman, 1969) starring Stuart Whitman. It was her last film, but she continued to appear incidentally on German TV. Saad also started to direct TV films, including the drama Die Geschichte vom guten alten Herrn und dem schonen Madchen/The story of the good old gentleman and the beautiful girl (1986) with Peter Pasetti. From 1957 till his death in 1988, Margit Saad was married to noted French opera director Jean-Pierre Ponnelle. They had one son, conductor Pierre-Dominique Ponnelle.\n\nSources: British Film Institute, Wikipedia (English and German) and IMDb.\n\nAnd, please check out our blog European Film Star Postcards.\n\nDutch postcard by Uitgeverij Takken, Utrecht, no. AX 4211. Photo: 20th Century Fox.\n\nPat Boone (1934) is an American singer and actor who was the second-biggest charting artist of the late 1950s, behind only Elvis Presley. Initially, he performed Rock and Roll, but later in his career, he switched to gospel music. Over the years he has had many hit songs including 'Moody River', 'Speedy Gonzales', and 'Bernardine. He sold more than 45 million records, had 38 Top 40 hits, and appeared in more than 12 Hollywood films.\n\nCharles Eugene Patrick (Pat) Boone was born in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1934. His father, Archie Altman Boone, was a building contractor and his mother, Margaret Virginia (née Pritchard), was a nurse. His younger brother, Nick Boone, also had a popular music career under the name Nick Todd. Pat grew up in Nashville, Tennessee, and attended David Lipscombe College, North Texas State College and Columbia University from which he received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1958. Boone began his career by performing in Nashville's Centennial Park and started recording for Republic Records in 1954. In 1955 he released a cover of the single 'Ain't That a Shame' by Fats Domino, and significantly broke the sales records of the original version. A number-one single in 1956 by Boone was a second cover and a revival of a then seven-year-old song 'I Almost Lost My Mind', by Ivory Joe Hunter, which was originally covered by another black star, Nat King Cole. It is representative of the early period of Boone's career, which mainly focused on polishing rhythm-and-blues hits into more accessible versions, allowing the Rock and Roll tunes to reach a much wider audience. Boone was also criticised for his homogenised, sanitized versions. He succeeded in removing all of the more suggestive lyrics from his cover of Little Richard's 'Long Tall Sally'. He changed the original's, \"I saw Uncle John with Long Tall Sally,/He saw Aunt Mary comin' and he ducked back in the alley\" to, \"Long Tall Sally's got a lot on the ball,/And nobody cares if she's long and tall.\" However, Little Richard himself once said: \"It was Pat Boone who made me a millionaire\". Boone had the image of a fresh-faced smooth guy, who appealed to both teenagers and their parents. His singing style, a full baritone, followed in the footsteps of his idol Bing Crosby. Soon he switched more and more to singing ballads. At the end of the 1950s, Pat Boone was only surpassed in popularity by Elvis Presley. And just like Elvis, he made an attempt at some acting. Although he made considerably fewer films than Elvis, it is said that his films were of considerably higher quality. Several film studios pursued him and he decided to go with 20th Century Fox, which had made Elvis Presley's first film. Fox reworked the play 'Bernardine' into a vehicle for Boone. The resulting film, Bernardine (Henry Levin, 1957), with Terry Moore and Janet Gaynor, was a solid hit, earning $3.75 million in the US. His recording for the title song of his second film, April Love (Henry Levin, 1957), in which he co-starred with Shirley Jones, was nominated for an Oscar. At the age of 23, he began hosting a half-hour ABC variety television series, The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom, which aired for 115 episodes (1957–1960). His recording of 'A Wonderful Time Up There' in 1958 became the first million-selling record with religious lyrics. Seeing himself as a devout born-again Christian, he refused music and film roles that went against his moral standards, including roles with the then-sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. In each of his film contracts, there was a term specifying that kissing his partner could not be forced on him by the director due to his religious convictions. Less popular was the musical comedy Mardi Gras (Edmund Goulding, 1958) with Christine Carère. However, the Science-Fiction adventure, Journey to the Center of the Earth (Henri Levin, 1959), with James Mason and Arlene Dahl, was a huge hit.\n\nPat Boone wrote the lyrics for the title song for the film Exodus (Otto Preminger, 1960), which he titled 'This Land Is Mine'. He produced and starred in a documentary, Salute to the Teenagers (1960), but did not make a film for a while, studying acting with Sanford Meisner. He returned with a military comedy, All Hands on Deck (Norman Taurog, 1961), a mild hit. He starred opposite Bobby Darin and Ann-Margret in another remake, State Fair (José Ferrer, 1962), but it was another box office disappointment. Musicals were becoming less fashionable in Hollywood. An invasion of British pop groups such as The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, and The Kinks ended Pat Boone's career as a hit machine, although he continued to make records in the 1960s. During the early 1960s, Boone starred in a handful of British films, produced by his own Cooga Mooga productions. In one of these, The Yellow Canary (1963), he attempted to shake up his established image by portraying a nasty, ill-tempered rock star. In the 1960s, he also began writing self-help books for adolescents, including the best-seller 'Twixt Twelve and Twenty'. In the 1970s, he switched to gospel music and country and continued to perform in other media, especially radio. Later, he was a disc jockey for a popular American old-time radio station and runs his own record company, which re-releases records from the 1950s that no longer have a place on major record labels. Boone married Shirley Lee Foley, daughter of Red Foley, in 1953 and they had four daughters: Cherry, Lindy, Debby and Laury. In the 1960s and 1970s, the family toured as gospel artists and made gospel albums such as 'The Pat Boone Family' and 'The Family Who Prays'. In 1997, Boone released an album entitled 'No More Mr. Nice Guy', which featured a collection of heavy metal covers polished to fit the Pat Boone style. To advertise the album, he appeared at the American Music Awards ceremony in black leather. He lost his respectable image in one fell swoop, at least among large sections of his following among conservative Christians. Because of this action, he was fired from Gospel America, a television programme of the Trinity Broadcasting Network. However, the music from this CD was often used during the intermission of hard rock and heavy metal concerts, and the CD was appreciated by the somewhat older guard of hard rockers who saw the humour in it and could appreciate the performance of the songs, which included a choir and a full orchestra. In 2003, his gospel recordings were recognised by Nashville's Gospel Music Association and added to the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. Boone lived in Los Angeles for many years with his wife Shirley Foley. They were influential members of the 'Church on the Road', the Inglewood Church of Christ in San Fernando Valley. Shirley (84) passed away in January 2019, they had been married for 65 years.\n\nSources: Hal Erickson (AllMovie), Wikipedia (Dutch and English), and IMDb.\n\nAnd, please check out our blog European Film Star Postcards.\n\nDutch postcard by Gebr.

She began acting in the theatre, then moved on to French cinema. In 1951, she had a small role in Olivia/The Pit of Loneliness (Jacqueline Audry, 1951), starring Edwige Feuillère and Simone Simon. The film, based on the 1950 semi-autobiographical novel of the same name by Dorothy Bussy, is a landmark of lesbian representation. Between 1951 and 1958 Carère appeared in about twenty films. She had a supporting part in the French historical comedy Un caprice de Caroline chérie/A Caprice of Darling Caroline (Jean Devaivre, 1953) starring Martine Carol. In Italy, she acted between 1953 and 1954, in the coming-of-age comedy-drama Terza liceo/High School (Luciano Emmer, 1954), and the melodrama Una donna libera/A Free Woman (Vittorio Cottafavi, 1954) starring Françoise Christophe. Back in France, she played the female lead in the musical comedy Tout chante autour de moi/Everything sings around me (Pierre Gout, 1954) which was the debut film vehicle for the pop star Mouloudji. She also co-starred with the French singer Georges Guétary in the French-German romantic comedy Le chemin du paradis/The Road to Paradise (Willi Forst, Hans Wolff, 1956), the French version of the German film Die Drei von der Tankstelle/The Three from the Filling Station (Hans Wolff, 1955), which was itself a remake of a 1930 film. She then appeared with Fernandel and Carmen Sevilla in the historical comedy Don Juan (John Berry, 1956), a co-production between France, Italy, and Spain, based on the legend of Don Juan.\n\nChristine Carère was brought to Hollywood to appear in A Certain Smile (Jean Negulesco, 1958), starring Rossano Brazzi and Joan Fontaine. She then starred opposite singer Pat Boone in the American musical comedy Mardi Gras (Edmund Goulding, 1958). But her American career was brief. In 1957 she married French actor and singer Philippe Nicaud and two years after her marriage she left the cinema. Her final film was the American musical comedy A Private's Affair (Raoul Walsh, 1959), starring Sal Mineo. In the 1960s she acted mainly in television serials. In the US, she starred with Robert Goulet in the spy series Blue Light (1966) about the adventures of an American double agent in Nazi Germany during World War II. It was credited for its gritty depiction of espionage in World War II and for the difficult moral choices it posed. A theatrical movie, I Deal in Danger, was created by editing Blue Light's first four episodes together into a continuous story, and was released in 1966 after Blue Light's cancellation. In 1985, Carère's name reappeared, when she and her husband were among the screenwriters of the comedy La cage aux folles 3 - 'Elles' se marient/La Cage aux Folles 3: The Wedding (Georges Lautner, 1985), the third and final installment in the La Cage aux Folles series with Michel Serrault and Ugo Tognazzi. Christine Carère died in 2008 in Fréjus, France, at the age of 78. With Philippe Nicaud, she had two children.\n\nSources: Wikipedia (French, Italian, and English) and IMDb.\n\nAnd, please check out our blog European Film Star Postcards.\n\nDutch postcard. Sent by mail in 1964.\n\nPat Boone (1934) is an American singer and actor who was the second-biggest charting artist of the late 1950s, behind only Elvis Presley. Initially, he performed Rock and Roll, but later in his career, he switched to gospel music. Over the years he has had many hit songs including 'Moody River', 'Speedy Gonzales', and 'Bernardine. He sold more than 45 million records, had 38 Top 40 hits, and appeared in more than 12 Hollywood films.\n\nCharles Eugene Patrick (Pat) Boone was born in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1934. His father, Archie Altman Boone, was a building contractor and his mother, Margaret Virginia (née Pritchard), was a nurse. His younger brother, Nick Boone, also had a popular music career under the name Nick Todd. Pat grew up in Nashville, Tennessee, and attended David Lipscombe College, North Texas State College, and Columbia University from which he received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1958. Boone began his career by performing in Nashville's Centennial Park and started recording for Republic Records in 1954. In 1955 he released a cover of the single 'Ain't That a Shame' by Fats Domino, and significantly broke the sales records of the original version. A number-one single in 1956 by Boone was a second cover and a revival of a then seven-year-old song 'I Almost Lost My Mind', by Ivory Joe Hunter, which was originally covered by another black star, Nat King Cole. It is representative of the early period of Boone's career, which mainly focused on polishing rhythm-and-blues hits into more accessible versions, allowing the Rock and Roll tunes to reach a much wider audience. Boone was also criticised for his homogenised, sanitized versions. He succeeded in removing all of the more suggestive lyrics from his cover of Little Richard's 'Long Tall Sally'. He changed the original's, \"I saw Uncle John with Long Tall Sally,/He saw Aunt Mary comin' and he ducked back in the alley\" to, \"Long Tall Sally's got a lot on the ball,/And nobody cares if she's long and tall.\" However, Little Richard himself once said: \"It was Pat Boone who made me a millionaire\". Boone had the image of a fresh-faced smooth guy, who appealed to both teenagers and their parents. His singing style, a full baritone, followed in the footsteps of his idol Bing Crosby. Soon he switched more and more to singing ballads. At the end of the 1950s, Pat Boone was only surpassed in popularity by Elvis Presley. And just like Elvis, he made an attempt at some acting. Although he made considerably fewer films than Elvis, it is said that his films were of considerably higher quality. Several film studios pursued him and he decided to go with 20th Century Fox, which had made Elvis Presley's first film. Fox reworked the play 'Bernardine' into a vehicle for Boone. The resulting film, Bernardine (Henry Levin, 1957), with Terry Moore and Janet Gaynor, was a solid hit, earning $3.75 million in the US. His recording for the title song of his second film, April Love (Henry Levin, 1957), in which he co-starred with Shirley Jones, was nominated for an Oscar. At the age of 23, he began hosting a half-hour ABC variety television series, The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom, which aired for 115 episodes (1957–1960). His recording of 'A Wonderful Time Up There' in 1958 became the first million-selling record with religious lyrics. Seeing himself as a devout born-again Christian, he refused music and film roles that went against his moral standards, including roles with the then-sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. In each of his film contracts, there was a term specifying that kissing his partner could not be forced on him by the director due to his religious convictions. Less popular was the musical comedy Mardi Gras (Edmund Goulding, 1958) with Christine Carère. However, the Science-Fiction adventure, Journey to the Center of the Earth (Henri Levin, 1959), with James Mason and Arlene Dahl, was a huge hit.\n\nPat Boone wrote the lyrics for the title song for the film Exodus (Otto Preminger, 1960), which he titled 'This Land Is Mine'. He produced and starred in a documentary, Salute to the Teenagers (1960), but did not make a film for a while, studying acting with Sanford Meisner. He returned with a military comedy, All Hands on Deck (Norman Taurog, 1961), a mild hit. He starred opposite Bobby Darin and Ann-Margret in another remake, State Fair (José Ferrer, 1962), but it was another box office disappointment. Musicals were becoming less fashionable in Hollywood. An invasion of British pop groups such as The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, and The Kinks ended Pat Boone's career as a hit machine, although he continued to make records in the 1960s. During the early 1960s, Boone starred in a handful of British films, produced by his own Cooga Mooga productions. In one of these, The Yellow Canary (1963), he attempted to shake up his established image by portraying a nasty, ill-tempered rock star. In the 1960s, he also began writing self-help books for adolescents, including the best-seller 'Twixt Twelve and Twenty'. In the 1970s, he switched to gospel music and country and continued to perform in other media, especially radio. Later, he was a disc jockey for a popular American old-time radio station and runs his own record company, which re-releases records from the 1950s that no longer have a place on major record labels. Boone married Shirley Lee Foley, daughter of Red Foley, in 1953 and they had four daughters: Cherry, Lindy, Debby and Laury. In the 1960s and 1970s, the family toured as gospel artists and made gospel albums such as 'The Pat Boone Family' and 'The Family Who Prays'. In 1997, Boone released an album entitled 'No More Mr. Nice Guy', which featured a collection of heavy metal covers polished to fit the Pat Boone style. To advertise the album, he appeared at the American Music Awards ceremony in black leather. He lost his respectable image in one fell swoop, at least among large sections of his following among conservative Christians. Because of this action, he was fired from Gospel America, a television programme of the Trinity Broadcasting Network. However, the music from this CD was often used during the intermission of hard rock and heavy metal concerts, and the CD was appreciated by the somewhat older guard of hard rockers who saw the humour in it and could appreciate the performance of the songs, which included a choir and a full orchestra. In 2003, his gospel recordings were recognised by Nashville's Gospel Music Association and added to the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. Boone lived in Los Angeles for many years with his wife Shirley Foley. They were influential members of the 'Church on the Road', the Inglewood Church of Christ in San Fernando Valley. Shirley (84) passed away in January 2019, they had been married for 65 years.\n\nSources: Hal Erickson (AllMovie), Wikipedia (Dutch and English), and IMDb.\n\nAnd, please check out our blog European Film Star Postcards.\n\nDutch postcard by Uitgeverij Takken, Utrecht, no.

The reasons are complex.\" NPR / Weekend Edition. Washington DC, USA (25/02/2023).\n\nROME — Cinema Troisi is an art movie house in central Rome. Its stark, white, minimalist façade contrasts with the ornate 19th-century buildings nearby.\n\nIt was built in the 1930s as the headquarters of the Fascist Youth Organization — the GIL.\n\nBut there is no plaque explaining its link to the dictatorship.\n\nItalian rap music plays in the background as young people mill around the lobby café.\n\nThey seem indifferent to the building's fascist origins, including 20-year-old Christian Carere, who works here.\n\n\"It's evolution,\" he says. \"A building is born as a structure. But inside, its purpose can change. For example, first it's a butcher shop and two years later it becomes a discotheque.\"\n\nAcross town, a fascist-era sports center has become a skate-boarder's paradise.\n\nThe sound of young men swooshing and twirling echoes on long slabs of marble and mosaic pavement that glorify the fascist regime. The intricate designs spell out late dictator Benito Mussolini's slogan, \"many enemies, much honor,\" and include large Ms for his name.\n\nLooming over the mosaics is a 57-foot-tall obelisk. Built in 1932 to mark the regime's 10th anniversary, the inscription is \"Mussolini Dux\" — Latin for Leader Mussolini.\n\nNelly Porcu, an athlete from the island of Sardinia who has been training for a marathon in the sports center, seems annoyed more by the obelisk's design than its historical meaning.\n\n\"I think it's really tacky, so kitsch, cheesy,\" she laughs.\n\nIn fact, most Italians ignore the history of the obelisk, the mosaics and the bigger-than-life male nude statues encircling the sports center, says historian Lucia Ceci.\n\n\"It's as if they've become part of the landscape, while they're very shocking — and rightly so — for foreigners, tourists, journalists and diplomats,\" she says.\n\nItaly never fully reckoned with its fascist past.\n\nAfter World War II, prompted by the Allies, Germany underwent an intense de-Nazification program.\n\nNot so Italy — there was no equivalent de-fascistization. The country is still filled with buildings and street names that evoke its 20-year dictatorship.\n\nA century after Mussolini took power with the March on Rome, there finally is a new website that maps monuments and plaques commemorating the regime.\n\nHistorian Ceci, one of the website's coordinators, says the project started seven years ago. It is backed by the Ferruccio Parri National Institute in Milan, named after an anti-fascist partisan who went on to become the first prime minister of postwar, newly democratic Italy in 1945.\n\nCeci says the mapping project was inspired by debates in other countries —including the United States — over how to treat monuments glorifying colonialism and slave owners.\n\nCeci and her fellow researchers do not call for the destruction of fascist-era monuments. But they want to add explanatory plaques that contextualize their origins. The aim is to promote a reckoning of the legacy of the regime.\n\n\"Otherwise,\" she says, \"the message continues to be that fascism brought modernity to the city, hiding the dictatorship, the persecutions, the discriminations and the war.\"\n\nFascist buildings are still in use, their origins little noticed\n\nIn 1935, standing before a crowd of thousands, his jaw jutting forward, Mussolini announced the invasion of Ethiopia and heralded Italians as a nation of \"heroes, saints, poets, artists, navigators, colonizers and travelers.\"\n\nNearly 90 years later, those words remain inscribed on a building halfway between Rome and the sea.\n\nAt the top of a long flight of steps, stands what was once known as the Palace of Italian Civilization. It was built to celebrate Italy's conquest of Ethiopia, says historian of fascism Marla Stone.\n\n\"It's very much a celebration of war, conquest and empire,\" says Stone, \"and the idea that fascism was going to expand and spread its message of nationalism, of strength, of masculinity. It's a very heavy, masculine building.\"\n\nWith 416 arches and statues celebrating heroism, philosophy and political genius, today it's known as the Square Colosseum and, since 2015, it's been global headquarters of the Fendi fashion house.\n\nThis is EUR, the neighborhood Mussolini had built from scratch in imitation of ancient Roman urban planning — an attempt to link his regime directly to the Roman Empire. A few blocks from the Square Colosseum is Palazzo degli Uffici, completed in 1939.\n\nIts main entrance is flanked by a gigantic bas-relief in travertine marble. It starts at the top with the Romulus and Remus founding myth of Rome, winds down from the ancient empire and the Renaissance to Giuseppe Garibaldi and the creation of the Italian state, ending at the bottom with Mussolini, standing like a Roman general on a horse, surrounded by his legionnaires and supplicating women.\n\nHistorian Stone points out that the head of the dictator had been chopped off after World War II. But at some point it was put back, restored or replaced by a new one.\n\nIn front of the building there's a statue of a young man giving the fascist salute, left in place after the war. Rather, bronze straps were added to his hands, turning him into a boxer ostensibly hailing a victory. The original name, Genius of Fascism, was changed to Genius of Sport.\n\nStone laments that by not challenging the history of these monuments, the memory of fascism has been smoothly integrated into the Italian present.\n\n\"They're now seen as part of the Italian heritage,\" Stone says. \"There are the ancient Roman monuments, there are the Renaissance monuments, the Baroque palaces. And then we have the heritage of fascism.\"\n\nThe victorious Allies chose not to confront Italy over its fascist legacy.\n\nOne reason why post-fascist Italy did not remove its monuments of the dictatorship might be there were simply too many buildings and the country too poor to rebuild them.\n\nIn 2017, American historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat wrote a piece for The New Yorker asking, \"Why are so many fascist monuments still standing in Italy?\"\n\nShe received sacks of hate mail from Italians accusing her of ignorance — unable to appreciate what they claimed was the aesthetic value of fascist architecture —and which many now call rationalist architecture.\n\nMany Italians feel disconnected to fascism, says Ben-Ghiat, and the Allies — the United States and Britain mainly — are the reason.\n\n\"They were very worried about social unrest if they pursued very harsh amnesties or purges,\" she says.\n\nBen-Ghiat says the Allies sometimes covered up fascist paintings with cloth rather than destroy them.\n\nMany Italians had joined the anti-fascist resistance during the war, and the postwar Communist Party was one of the strongest in Europe.\n\n\"It was the Cold War,\" she says, \"and they decided to treat Italians as a good people who were led astray by a bad man.\"\n\nWhile it was widely criticized in Italy, Ben-Ghiat's article also inspired historian Ceci and her fellow researchers to pursue the project of mapping fascist monuments.\n\nWhen the website went public in November, it had identified 1,400 of them.\n\nCeci believes that's about half the monuments existing throughout the country.\n\nIn fact, visitors to the website are asked to suggest additional listings.\n\nFonte / source:\n\n--- EUROPE - Sylvia Poggioli, \"Italy has kept its fascist monuments and buildings.

Its stark, white, minimalist façade contrasts with the ornate 19th-century buildings nearby.\n\nIt was built in the 1930s as the headquarters of the Fascist Youth Organization — the GIL.\n\nBut there is no plaque explaining its link to the dictatorship.\n\nItalian rap music plays in the background as young people mill around the lobby café.\n\nThey seem indifferent to the building's fascist origins, including 20-year-old Christian Carere, who works here.\n\n\"It's evolution,\" he says. \"A building is born as a structure. But inside, its purpose can change. For example, first it's a butcher shop and two years later it becomes a discotheque.\"\n\nAcross town, a fascist-era sports center has become a skate-boarder's paradise.\n\nThe sound of young men swooshing and twirling echoes on long slabs of marble and mosaic pavement that glorify the fascist regime. The intricate designs spell out late dictator Benito Mussolini's slogan, \"many enemies, much honor,\" and include large Ms for his name.\n\nLooming over the mosaics is a 57-foot-tall obelisk. Built in 1932 to mark the regime's 10th anniversary, the inscription is \"Mussolini Dux\" — Latin for Leader Mussolini.\n\nNelly Porcu, an athlete from the island of Sardinia who has been training for a marathon in the sports center, seems annoyed more by the obelisk's design than its historical meaning.\n\n\"I think it's really tacky, so kitsch, cheesy,\" she laughs.\n\nIn fact, most Italians ignore the history of the obelisk, the mosaics and the bigger-than-life male nude statues encircling the sports center, says historian Lucia Ceci.\n\n\"It's as if they've become part of the landscape, while they're very shocking — and rightly so — for foreigners, tourists, journalists and diplomats,\" she says.\n\nItaly never fully reckoned with its fascist past.\n\nAfter World War"
