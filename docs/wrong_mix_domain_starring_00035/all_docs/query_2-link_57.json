        "text": "Kindergarten through 3rd Grade Summer Kids Theatre\n\nAuditions:\n\nMonday, June 26, 2023 from 5:30pm – 7:00pm\n\nDownload Audition Form\n\nLocation: The HFV Wilson Center at 625 E. Main Street\n\nPerformances:\n\nJuly 26 & 27, 2023 at 6:30pm\n\n(Wednesday & Thursday)\n\nDirectors: Doobie Potter and Al Bostick\n\nSynopsis:\n\nBased on the beloved Disney animated film, and featuring a jazzy, upbeat score, Disney’s The Aristocats KIDS is a non-stop thrill ride of feline fun, complete with unbelievable twists and turns.\n\nIn the heart of Paris, a kind and eccentric millionairess wills her entire estate to Duchess, her high-society cat, and her three little kittens. Laughs and adventure ensue as the greedy, bumbling butler pulls off the ultimate catnap caper. Now it’s up to the rough-and-tumble alley cat, Thomas O’Malley, and his band of swingin’ jazz cats to save the day.\n\nAbout Auditions:\n\nThe HFV Wilson Center and Ardmore Little Theatre will team up to produce this production of Aristocats Kids. The two guest artist directing this production are Doobie Potter and Al Bostick. Both are Artist in Residence for the State and reside in Oklahoma City.\n\nAuditions for the musical production of “Aristocats Kids” will take place at the HFV Wilson Center located at 625 E. Main Street. The auditions will be on Monday June 26th, from 5:30 – 7:00pm. Please sign up with the button above. If necessary, there may be a call back audition for some of the more major roles on Tuesday the 27th. Those kids would be notified by text or email.\n\nThe following is a handy list of how parents can help their children prepare for auditions.\n\n1. They should be able to sing any favorite song of their choice. If they want they can sing Happy Birthday in a group.\n\n2. They can recite anything by memory. A poem, a story they make up or have read.\n\nThey should be as animated as possible and can make up movements for their song, story or poem.\n\nWhat we are looking for is imagination, spontaneity and ability to move on stage. All of the kids need to be able to be heard from the audience. There will be no microphones used. They need to use their, “outside”, voices.\n\nWe will be giving them simple directions and movements to see if they can follow them.\n\nThis production will be very fun. A combination of Ms. Potter’s and Mr. B’s creativity mixed in with what the kids will bring to the table.\n\nThe most important thing for parents to realize is the commitment. If your child is in the show they must be there everyday for the creative process. We will be learning our lines, blocking movement, learning songs and choreography. Also making props and costume pieces. They will all be part of the process, the puzzle, and when someone is missing, it throw the whole thing off.\n\nThere will be two performances at 6:30 on July 26th and 27th. The ticket price will be $5.00."
