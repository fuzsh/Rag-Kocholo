Laughs and adventure ensue as the greedy, bumbling butler pulls off the ultimate catnap caper. Now it’s up to the rough-and-tumble alley cat, Thomas O’Malley, and his band of swingin’ jazz cats to save the day.\n\n“I just wanted to say a HUGE thank you to everyone involved with the production of Winnie the Pooh last week. My daughter had an absolutely fabulous time and enjoyed every minute. The performance was wonderful! The programmes, photography, costumes, sound and stage management were so professional. The whole production was such a great experience for the children and so enjoyable to watch.“\n\nA cast member’s parent from our 2021 show\n\nAll staff are DBS checked and led by experienced youth theatre practitioners.
