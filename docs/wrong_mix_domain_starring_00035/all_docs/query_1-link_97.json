        "text": "Meaghan is taking over the role that made Lindsay famous. Will a similar fate befall her?\n\nShould we offer you our congratulations or our condolences, Meaghan Jette Martin? You ARE the next Lindsay Lohan!\n\nThe 18-year-old starlet is playing Jo, the lead role in Mean Girls 2, a made-for-TV follow-up to the 2004 film that made Lindsay a household name; the sequel began filming in Atlanta, Georgia July 7.\n\nThe similarities between the two girls are eerie: Lindsay, now 24, was also 18 when she shot the original flick. Both girls are also former Disney darlings: Lilo starred in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen and Herbie: Fully Loaded, while Las Vegas native Meaghan starred in Camp Rock 1 & 2 and the recently canceled (and utterly awesome) ABC Family series 10 Things I Hate About You.\n\nLindsay’s Mean Girls cast members included some pretty huge names – including Amanda Seyfried and Rachel McAdams – while Meaghan’s co-stars Jennifer Stone and Nicole Anderson are also established Disney stars themselves. Both girls also have barely-there careers as pop stars.\n\nUnfortunately Mean Girls 2 isn’t going to the movie theater – it will only air on TV (but at least it’s saved from its anticipated straight-to-DVD fate) so maybe the lack of notoriety will keep Meaghan on the straight and narrow. We don’t want another hard-partying, SCRAM-wearing jailbird on our hands, now do we?\n\nLaura Schreffler & Russ Weakland"
