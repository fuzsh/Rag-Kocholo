        "text": "The Aristocats is a 1970 animated film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released on December 24, 1970. The 20th animated feature in the Disney Animated Canon, the film is based on a story by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe, and revolves around a family of aristocratic cats, and how an alley cat acquaintance helps them after their butler, Edgar, catnaps them to gain his mistress' fortune, which was meant to go to them. The title is a pun on the word aristocrats. The film's basic idea — an animated romantic musical comedy about talking cats in France — had previously been used in the UPA animated feature Gay Purr-ee.\n\nDisney began production of a sequel, The Aristocats II, in December 2005, set to release in 2007, but production was cancelled in early 2006.\n\nThe film is noted for being along with The Jungle Book (1967) the last film project to be approved by Walt Disney himself, as he died in late 1966, ten months before the film was released. While the film gained overall favorable reviews and a solid box office performance, it did not match the earlier success of 101 Dalmatians or The Jungle Book. Today, while the film is very iconic, it is seen as a modest success by the Disney company.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe year is 1910. On an autumn day in Paris, a mother cat named Duchess and her three kittens ― Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse ― live in the mansion of retired opera singer Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, along with her butler, Edgar. She early on settles her will with her lawyer, Georges Hautcourt - an aged, eccentric old friend of hers - stating that she wishes the \"faithful\" Edgar to look after her beloved cats until they die. Only then will he inherit the fortune himself. Edgar hears this from his own room and believes he will be dead before he inherits Madame Adelaide's fortune, and so plots to remove the cats from a position of inheritance (clearly not thinking about how he would be essentially in control of the fortune, despite having to take good care of them).\n\nEdgar sedates the cats by putting an entire bottle of sleeping pills into their food and then heads out into the French countryside to dispose of them. However, two hound dogs named Napoleon and Lafayette attack him. After the conflict, Edgar escapes, leaving behind his umbrella, hat, the cats' bed basket, and the sidecar of his motorcycle in the process. The cats are left alone and afraid in the countryside, while Madame Adelaide, Roquefort the Mouse, and Frou Frou the horse discover their absence. In the morning, Duchess meets an alley cat named Thomas O'Malley, who offers to guide her and the kittens to Paris.\n\nThey have a struggle returning to the city, briefly hitchhiking on the back of a milk cart before being unfortunately chased off by the driver. Marie subsequently falls into a river after a train roars down the tracks and is saved by O'Malley. They then meet a pair of British white geese, Abigail and Amelia Gabble, who are traveling to Paris. The group heads off leaving the countryside, marching like geese, until they reach Paris and come across the girls' drunken Uncle Waldo. Abigail and Amelia then depart to take Waldo home. Traveling across the rooftops of the city, the cats meet Scat Cat and his band, close friends to O'Malley, who perform the song \"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat\". After the band has departed and the kittens lie in bed, O'Malley and Duchess spend the evening on a nearby rooftop and talk, while the kittens listen at a windowsill. The subject of their conversation is the question of whether Duchess can stay and be with Thomas.\n\nReluctantly, Duchess sadly turns him down, largely out of loyalty to Madame Adelaide, pointing out that Madame really does love her and her kittens - some cuts to Madame Adelaide show that she truly is very unhappy without her cats and feeling very much alone. The listening kittens are disappointed, although they too wish to go home, but are very sad that they've got to say goodbye to Thomas (even Berlioz goes as far as to say that they almost had a father). Edgar, meanwhile, retrieves his sidecar, umbrella, and hat from Napoleon and Lafayette with some difficulty.\n\nThe cats make it back to the mansion, after which O'Malley departs sadly after he and Duchess have a heartfelt farewell moment. Edgar sees Duchess and Kittens coming and suddenly captures them, places them in a sack, and briefly hides them in the oven. The cats tell Roquefort to pursue O'Malley and get help. He does so, at which point O'Malley races back to the mansion, ordering Roquefort to find Scat Cat and his gang. Edgar places the cats in a trunk which he plans to send to Timbuktu, Africa, so they can never come back. O'Malley, Scat Cat and his gang, and Frou-Frou all fight Edgar, while Roquefort frees Duchess and kittens. In the end, Edgar is tipped into the trunk, locked inside, and is sent to Timbuktu himself. Madame Adelaide's will is rewritten to exclude Edgar and include O'Malley. She starts a charity foundation providing a home for all of Paris' stray cats. To which most of the major characters come, the grand opening thereof features Scat Cat's band, who perform a reprise of \"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat\". Napoleon and Lafayette join in the party but realize it sounds like the end; the words \"The End\" hit Napoleon on the head, then he ducks down saying the line while it shows itself on-screen, the cats finish their song with a happy ending while the \"The End\" title card dances, then Toulouse says his final line \"Oh Yeah\" from earlier on just as the movie officially ends fading black showing \"Walt Disney Productions\" under \"The End\".\n\nProduction[]\n\nStory development[]\n\nOn December 9, 1961, Walt Disney suggested that Harry Tytle and Tom McGowan find some animal stories to adapt as a two-part live-action episode for the Wonderful World of Color television program. By New Year's 1962, McGowan had found several stories including a children's book about a mother cat and her kittens set in New York City. However, Tytle felt that a London location had added a significant element to One Hundred and One Dalmatians and suggested setting the story of the cats in Paris. Following a rough storyline, the story became about two servants—a butler and a maid—who were in line to inherit a fortune of an eccentric mistress after the pet cats died and focused on their feeble and foolish attempts to eliminate the felines. Boris Karloff and Francoise Rosay were in mind to portray the butler and the distressed Madame. A subplot centered around a mother cat hiding her kittens to keep them out of danger in a variety of different homes and locales around Paris, France. During the filming of Escapade in Florence, McGowan brought him the story that had been written by Tom Rowe, an American writer who was living in Paris.\n\nBy August 1962, they sent the completed script to Burbank, where it was returned as \"rejected\" by an unknown executive at the Disney studios. Nevertheless, Tytle brought the script to Walt staying at the Connaught in London. Disney approved for the draft, but recommended additional cuts which were made by February 1963. Before filming was to commence Paris, Rowe wrote a letter to Disney addressing his displeasure of the script revisions, in which Tytle responded to Rowe that the changes Walt approved of would be kept. However, by summer 1963, the project was shelved, where Tytle, in a discussion with Walt, recommended to produce The Aristocats as an animated feature. For that reason, Walt temporarily shelved the project as the animation department was occupied with The Jungle Book. Meanwhile, director Wolfgang Reitherman learned of the project and suggested it as a follow-up project to Jungle Book. Because of the production delays, Tytle was advised to centralize his efforts on live action projects and was replaced by Winston Hibler.\n\nIn 1966, Disney assigned Ken Anderson to determine whether Aristocats would be suitable for an animated feature. With occasional guidance from Reitherman, Anderson worked from scratch and simplified the two stories into a story that focused more on the cats. Walt saw the preliminary sketches and approved the project shortly before his death. After The Jungle Book was completed, Walt and his team began work on Aristocats, which was still on after Walt's death. Hibler was eventually replaced by Reitherman, who would abandon the more emotional story of Duchess's obsession to find adopters befitting of her kittens' talents initially favored by Walt suggesting instead the film be conceived as an adventure comedy in the vein of One Hundred and One Dalmatians. Furthermore, the character Elvira, the maid, who was intended to be voiced by Elsa Lanchester, was removed from the story placing Edgar as the central antagonist in order to better simplify the storyline.\n\nCasting[]\n\nAs with The Jungle Book, the characters were patterned on the personalities of the voice actors. In 1966, Walt Disney contacted Phil Harris to improvise the script, and shortly after, he was cast to voice Thomas O'Malley. To differentiate the character from Baloo, Reitherman noted O'Malley was \"more based on Clark Gable than Wallace Beery, who was partly the model for Baloo.\" Reitherman furthermore cast Eva Gabor as Duchess, remarking she had \"the freshest femme voice we've ever had\", and Sterling Holloway as Roquefort. Louis Armstrong was initially reported to voice Scat Cat, but he backed out of the project in 1969 for unknown reasons. Out of desperation, Scatman Crothers was hired to voice the character under the direction to imitate Armstrong. Pat Buttram and George Lindsey were cast as the farm dogs, which proved so popular with the filmmakers that another scene was included to have the dogs when Edgar returns to the farm to retrieve his displaced hat and umbrella. Dal McKennon was considered to voice Roquefort, but he declined.\n\nAnimation[]\n\nKen Anderson spent eighteen months developing the design of the characters. Five of Disney's legendary \"Nine Old Men\" worked on it, including the Disney crew that had been working 25 years on average.\n\nCast[]\n\nEva Gabor as Duchess\n\nPhil Harris as Thomas O'Malley\n\nRoddy Maude-Roxby as Edgar\n\nGary Dubin as Toulouse\n\nLiz English as Marie\n\nDean Clark as Berlioz\n\nSterling Holloway as Roquefort the Mouse\n\nScatman Crothers as Scat Cat\n\nPaul Winchell as Shun Gon\n\nLord Tim Hudson as Hit Cat\n\nVito Scotti as Peppo\n\nThurl Ravenscroft as Billy Boss\n\nPat Buttram as Napoleon\n\nGeorge Lindsey as Lafayette\n\nHermione Baddeley as Madame Adelaide Bonfamille\n\nCharles Lane as Georges Hautcourt\n\nNancy Kulp as Frou Frou\n\nMonica Evans and Carole Shelley as Abigail and Amelia Gabble\n\nBill Thompson as Uncle Waldo\n\nUncredited[]\n\nRobie Lester as Duchess's singing voice\n\nPeter Renaday as French Milkman/Le Petit Cafe Cook/Truck Movers\n\nRuth Buzzi as Frou Frou's singing voice\n\nGoofs[]\n\nWhen the Alley Cats fight Edgar, Roquefort orders everyone to be quiet while he works on cracking the padlock. Even Edgar stops. This is strange since Madame Adelaide Bonfamille and the other humans can't understand animals. It's especially strange since Edgar can't understand his horse.\n\nIn a few scenes, Roquefort has five fingers instead of four.\n\nAfter Edgar is kicked into the box that he was planning to use to send the cats to Timbuktu, it is shown with the padlock once again locked and sealed on the front, despite the fact that Roquefort had removed the padlock and there had been no time for anyone to put it back on before it was kicked outside.\n\nIn the scene where Edgar is ironing his clothes, he is seen wearing a pair of red-and-white striped boxer shorts. However, since this movie is set in 1910, boxer shorts weren't really invented until 1925 (15 years later).\n\nWhile Roquefort reports to Scat Cat and the gang that O'Malley, Duchess, and the kittens are in trouble, Peppo (the Italian Cat) changes two different locations too quickly.\n\nEdgar refers to the money that he would inherit as \"dollars\" and the American dollar sign flashes in his eyes; however, the film takes place in France.\n\nWhen Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse race each other to their little cat door, they fight over who will go first through the door. When Marie mentions that she's a lady and should go first, it can be seen through the door that it is nighttime. After Toulouse comments she's not a lady, and Berlioz pulling her tail saying she's nothing but a sister, it is once again daytime as seen through the door.\n\nThroughout the film, Hit Cat (guitar) and Billy Boss (bass) play their instruments left and right-handed.\n\nThe basket with Duchess and her kittens Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse falls out from the motorcycle, rolling down the hill while the dogs Napoleon and Lafayette are chasing Edgar, the cats aren't seen falling out from the basket themselves when it does, and it doesn't land under the bridge when the chase is going on, but after the fight ends with Edgar driving away and the rainstorm approaching, the basket is suddenly under the bridge, and Duchess sleeping in the tall grass.\n\nBerlioz rides on Frou-Frou's head during the carriage ride, but when they all get home, he thanks her for riding on her back, but he never rode on her back, he rode on her head, so he should've meant to thank her for riding on her head.\n\nWhen the kittens play their train game on the train tracks, they line up in a straight line, Toulouse is the leader in the game Berlioz is the passenger, they all line up together and she lines up standing behind Berlioz in the game. Toulouse says that Marie is the caboose which makes her not so interested and she's suddenly seen standing behind Toulouse in line, as Berlioz briefly disappears in the shot, but as their playing and walking along the train tracks, she's behind Berlioz again.\n\nWhen Thomas O'Malley is singing to Duchess, in one shot her collar is completely blue.\n\nRelease and reception[]\n\nMain article: The Aristocats (video)\n\nThe Aristocats premiered on December 11, 1970 and released in theaters on December 24 that same year. The film was then re-released to theaters on December 19, 1980, and April 10, 1987. Overall, The Aristocats made over $55 million on a budget of $4 million, making it a box office success.\n\nBased on 33 reviews, the film has a 64% rating at Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 5.9/10 \"fresh\", relatively low for a Disney animated feature, with a consensus of \"Though The Aristocats is mostly a middling effort for Disney, it is redeemed by terrific work from its voice cast and some jazzy tunes.\" Of the reviews, 19 gave it \"fresh\" and 10 gave it \"rotten\".\n\nThe film was nominated for AFI's 10 Top 10 in the \"Animation\" genre.\n\nIt was first released on VHS in the UK in 1995. It was first released on VHS in North America in the Masterpiece Collection series on April 24, 1996, and DVD on April 4, 2000, in the Gold Classic Collection line. The Aristocats had its Gold Collection disc quietly discontinued in 2006. A new single-disc Special Edition DVD (previously announced as a 2-Disc set) was released on February 5, 2008, with the original matted aspect ratio of 1.75:1. The film debuted on Blu-ray on August 7, 2012, this time with a 1.66:1 transfer.\n\nSoundtrack[]\n\n\"The Aristocats\" - Maurice Chevalier \"The Aristocats\" is the title song from the film. It was written by Robert and Richard Sherman at the end of the eight-year tenure working for Walt Disney Productions. Actor and singer Maurice Chevalier came out of retirement to sing this song for the motion picture's soundtrack. He recorded it in English as well as in French translation (\"Naturellement - les Aristocats!\"). It would be his last work before his death in 1972.\n\n\"Scales and Arpeggios\" - Liz English, Gary Dubin, Dean Clark, Robie Lester\n\n\"Thomas O'Malley Cat (song)\" - Phil Harris\n\n\"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat\" - Phil Harris, Scatman Crothers, Thurl Ravenscroft, Vito Scotti, Paul Winchell This song is sung by Scatman Crothers as Scat Cat, Phil Harris as Thomas O'Malley Cat, and Thurl Ravenscroft as Billy Boss the Russian Cat. It was also released as a now rare 45 rpm single, in a version sung only by Phil Harris, which lacks the cartoon voices of the common release. The soundtrack CD released in 1996 contains an edited version of the song. The lines sung by \"Chinese Cat\" voiced by Paul Winchell, now seen as politically incorrect, are removed.\n\n\"She Never Felt Alone\" - Robie Lester\n\n\"Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat (reprise)\" - Phil Harris, Scatman Crothers, Thurl Ravenscroft, Vito Scotti, Paul Winchell, Ruth Buzzi, Bill Thompson\n\nOn Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic, this includes \"Thomas O'Malley Cat\" on the purple disc and \"Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat\" on the orange disc. On Disney's Greatest Hits, this includes \"Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat\" on the red disc.\n\nCancelled sequel[]\n\nThe Aristocats II was supposed to be a direct-to-video sequel to this film. It was scheduled to be released in 2007, but the production was canceled in early 2006 after Disney acquired Pixar and canceled all other planned direct-to-video sequels.\n\nGallery[]\n\nVideos[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nA copyright renewal for the film was registered on June 29, 1998.[1]\n\nThe title \"Aristocats\" is a play on words, combining \"aristocrats\" and \"cats\".\n\nThis is the last movie to end with \"A Walt Disney Production\", and the first of the Walt Disney Animated Classics to open with \"Walt Disney Productions Presents\". This would continue up until The Fox and the Hound in 1981.\n\nRobie Lester, who had done Duchess's singing voice in the film, would also later narrate the Read-Along version of the film.\n\nThe Aristocats, more specifically \"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat\", was later briefly shown in the live-action remake of 101 Dalmatians, which the puppies ended up watching before switching to Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey.\n\nA deleted scene shows that when the train comes on the bridge, the train derails, and with Marie nearly drowning.\n\nScat Cat was originally written with Louie Armstrong in mind, with his original name being Satchmo Cat. Unfortunately, illness kept Armstrong from being able to play the character and the character was recast with Scatman Crothers and given the song \"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat\" replacing the one the Sherman Brothers wrote for Armstrong, \"Le Jazz Hot\".\n\nThe car that Georges drives resembles a 1913 Mercer 35J Raceabout.\n\nShun Gon the Siamese Cat has caused some controversy in recent years due to his appearance as a Chinese racial stereotype.\n\nThe number of sleeping pills Edgar put in the milk for the cats would likely have killed them in real life.\n\nMarie, Berlioz, and Toulouse have an Uncle Antoine that only appears in the books, but not in the movie.\n\nAlmost all the characters from this film appear in House of Mouse, except for Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse.\n\nThere are no end credits at the end of the movie, but there are opening credits at the start of the movie.\n\nRoquefort narrates the Disneyland Records adaptation of the film.\n\nIn Disneyland Records, some of the main characters namely Roquefort, Napoleon and Lafayette, Abigail and Amelia Gabble are voiced by their original voice actors and voice actresses, but Duchess and her kittens are not.\n\nToulouse was originally named \"Dopey\" (almost named after one of the dwarves from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) seen on one of the early storyboards until his name was changed.\n\nMarie is named after Marie Antoinette, Berlioz is named after Hector Berlioz, Toulouse is named after Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and the French city Toulouse.\n\nAn ongoing graphic novel series revolving around the kittens Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse, called The Aristokittens begun publication during Spring 2022 with the first two books \"Welcome to the Creature Cafe\" and \"The Great Biscuit Bake-Off\" released on April 19, 2022, with the third book \"The Fantastic Rabbit Race\" releasing October of that same year .\n\nDuring the train scene, the whistle sound was originally used in the 1948 short film Desert Empire and it is in fact a Star Brass 5 chime whistle.\n\nA live-action remake of the same film is planned for the future, but its release date is currently unknown. However, in January 2022, development for the remake has started.[2]\n\n[]\n\nThe Aristocats on Wikipedia\n\nReferences[]\n\nMedia The Aristocats (soundtrack/video/books) • Live-action remake • The Lost Chords: The Aristocats\n\nCancelled projects: The Aristocats II • The Aristocats: The Animated Series\n\nDisney Parks It's a Small World • PLAY!\n\nEntertainment: Big Band Beat • Fantasy Festival • One Man's Dream • The Adventure of Rhythm\n\nRestaurants: Center Street Coffeehouse\n\nParades: Disney Adventure Friends Cavalcade • Disney Harmony in Color!
