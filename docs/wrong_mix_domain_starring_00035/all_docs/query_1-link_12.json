        "text": "Before she was a Disney channel starlet, Meagen Jette Martin's first professional job was a model in a Disney fashion show when she was only five years old. Now, as the star Disney's \"Camp Rock\" movies, Martin is given a chance to do the two things she likes best: acting and singing. This book traces the young star's life from her childhood love of community theater to performing with the Jonas Brothers. The accessible volume features photographs of the teen actress as well as information on the hobbies and causes that she promotes in her downtime."
