Members of the Corsicana Police Department, Navarro County Sheriff's Office, Texas Department of Public Safety troopers, Corsicana ISD police and Navarro College Police gathered for the 11th Annual Police Memorial Day service, on the northeast lawn of the Navarro County Courthouse Friday afternoon to remember fellow officer's whose lives were cut short in the line of duty.

Joining them were representatives of Mexia Police Department, Limestone County Sheriff's Office, Panola County Constable and Ennis Independent School District Police.

CPD Chief G.M. Cox opened the ceremonies at approximately 5:15 p.m.

Officer of the day was Capt. Kenneth Kirkwood from CPD.

After Ron Holden of Ennis ISD Police sang the national anthem, Chief Cox announced legislation was passed in 1963 to honor the fallen police officers. He said it was one of the last pieces of legislature President John F. Kennedy passed before his assassination.

A wreath donated by Magic Gardens was to be placed next to the Peace Officer's Memorial.

Guest speaker State Rep. Byron Cook said in part of his speech the chosen profession is very significant.

"I appreciate everything you do," Cook said.

CPD chaplain B.F. Risinger gave the invocation and prayer, and closing remarks and prayer.

Sheriff Leslie Cotten read the roll of officers killed in the line of duty, which include CPD, NCSO, Limestone and Freestone County peace officers.

A 21-gun salute was sounded in honor of those officers.
