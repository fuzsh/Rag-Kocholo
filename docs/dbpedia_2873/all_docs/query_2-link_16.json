        "text": "Because of Chairman Byron Cook (R-Corsicana) and the House State Affairs Committee, numerous pro-life bills made it to the in the Texas House floor for consideration. The Committee voted out 12 pro-life bills, two of which he was the author.\n\nByron Cook is a recipient of Texas Alliance for Life’s Courageous Defense of Life award and is considered to be a champion for life by most pro-life leaders.\n\nEach bill represents a significant advance in the pro-life movement, and all are able to withstand a challenge in state or federal court. They put Texas on track to have another sensational legislative session.\n\nOf the several bills that were referred to this committee and were not voted out, they were either duplicative of one or more of the bills that were voted out, were drafted in a way that they would not withstand a federal court challenge, or the bill’s author did not request a hearing.\n\nHB 35 (Cook) – Requires humane disposition of the bodies of babies who die from abortion or miscarriage. Bans inhumane methods that are currently legal including grinding and flushing into a municipal sewer system and burying in a landfill the ashes of the babies after incineration.\n\nHB 200 (Burkett) – Shuts down Planned Parenthood’s trafficking of baby body parts in Texas:\n\nBans partial-birth abortion (a preferred method for harvesting organs),\n\nBans the sale or donation of tissues or organs harvested from babies who die from elective abortion, and\n\nBans research on tissues and organs obtained from babies who die from elective abortion.\n\nHB 434 (Simmons) – Bans wrongful birth lawsuits, in which doctors are sued by the parents of a child born with a disability because they claim they were not informed of the disability in time to abort the child.\n\nHB 1936 (Springer) – Stops subsidies of Planned Parenthood by prohibiting state and local governments from entering into contracts with abortion providers or affiliates.\n\nHB 2063 (Greg Bonnen) – Bans DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) orders without the consent of the patient or surrogate.\n\nHB 2858 (Burns) – Protects women and girls from forced abortions, especially in the course of sex trafficking:\n\nRequires sex trafficking signage at any place abortions are performed.\n\nCreates a first degree felony offense for causing the death of an unborn child of a minor girl who is a victim of sex trafficking.\n\nIncreases penalties for assaulting a woman or girl to force her to have an abortion.\n\nHB 2962 (Capriglione) – Improves reporting of abortion complications by providers of follow-up care, including licensed abortion facilities, hospitals, and stand alone ERs.\n\nHB 3771 (Cook) – Ensures treatment for ectopic pregnancies is not reported as abortion.\n\nHB 3859 (Frank) – Allows foster care providers to follow their sincerely held religious beliefs to not provide or refer for abortion.\n\nSB 8 (Schwertner/Burkett) – companion to HB 200.\n\nSB 25 (Creighton/Simmons) – companion to HB 434.\n\nSB 20 (Larry Taylor/Smittee) — Removes mandatory abortion coverage from health insurance plans.\n\nLeg.
