        "text": "On Wednesday, House State Affairs Chairman Byron Cook is giving a hearing to House Bill 439, authored by Democrat State Representative Nicole Collier. If passed, HB 439 would allow the removal of life-sustaining treatments from a pregnant woman who has previously signed a Living Will or Do-Not-Rescusitate Order.\n\nHB 439 Is Pro-Death\n\n“A person may not withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment under this subchapter from a pregnant patient.” Tex. Health & Safety Code § 166.049.\n\nUnder HB 439, however, both of these laws would be repealed. Repealing these laws would allow for causing the slow death of the preborn child by removing life-sustaining treatment from the mother. If such treatment is removed from the mother, even a perfectly healthy and developing baby will die.\n\nSo-Called Pro-Life “Champion” Championing a Pro-Death Bill\n\nByron Cook claims to be a pro-life “Champion,” but he is giving this pro-death bill a hearing while refusing to give a hearing to HB 948, the Abolition of Abortion in Texas Act. Byron Cook claims to be a Republican, but he refuses to follow the Legislative Priority of his own party:\n\nWe, the delegates of the 2016 Republican Party of Texas State Convention, call upon the 85th Texas Legislature to Abolish abortion by enacting legislation to stop the murder of unborn children; And to ignore and refuse to enforce any and all federal statutes, regulations, executive orders, and court rulings which would deprive an unborn child of the right to life.\n\nByron Cook has refused to give a Republican-authored bill with ten Republican co-authors a hearing, but tomorrow he is giving a hearing to a pro-death bill authored by a lone Democrat representative.\n\nWhat You Can Do\n\nPlease call Chairman Byron Cook’s office right now and strongly urge him to act like the Christian, pro-life Republican he claims to be. Urge him to vote against HB 439 and give a hearing to HB 948 so that abortion may be completely abolished in Texas. You can reach his office at 512-463-0730 and at the House Committee on State Affairs at 512-463-0814."
