        "text": "Harry was born June 24, 1942 in Tacoma, WA to Harry and Anabel Field.\n\nHe attended schools in Tacoma, then entered University of Washington where he met his wife Linda. He graduated in August 1964 and got married the same week.\n\nHarry’s first job was as editor of the Whidbey News Times in Oak Harbor, WA. He loved being in charge of a small town weekly paper, but the military draft was to end that job. The young couple couldn’t live on a draftee’s pay so he decided to enlist in the Army and attend Officer Candidate school, completing it successfully and becoming a 2nd Lieutenant.\n\nHarry’s next assignment was Fort Gordon, GA to train and become a civil affairs platoon leader. He was then sent to Vietnam. He and his platoon did many projects to help the Vietnamese civilians. Harry’s favorite was the “med cap” where they visited remote villages accompanied by a doctor and dentist who provided much needed medical care while Harry and his men gave candy and T-shirts to the village children. These were dangerous missions because as soon as Americans arrived, someone would put out word to the Vietcong. Another danger was exposure to Agent Orange, which was used to exfoliate the jungle where the Vietcong hid. This exposure would bring Harry major health problems later in life.\n\nAfter his military service ended, Harry left the Army and returned to the Seattle area. He became assistant to the president at Seattle Community College and eventually owner of his own successful market research company, The Field Company.\n\nHe and Linda had 2 children (Todd and Kendra) and together they made family a priority and made sure the kids felt loved every day. He worked hard to make sure his family taken care of and also had fun together. There were many family trips to the Oregon Coast, camping and a cruise to Mexico. Harry and Linda also traveled together and took cruises to Alaska and through the Panama Canal.\n\nHarry loved music, playing cribbage and working in his yard. He also found a lot of joy in his 5 grandchildren.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Linda, son Todd (Monica), and daughter Kendra (Dee), sister Sharon (Alan) and niece Alanna. Also his grandsons Levi, Luca, Carlos and Trey and his granddaughter Erin."
