        "text": "The Texas Legislature is considering multiple bills that would make it easier to transfer water from one area to another. In practical terms, this means taking water from rural areas to supply urban centers.\n\nWhile some water transfers may be needed, all too often these rural-to-urban transfers are being used to avoid real conservation measures. In fact, the current state Water Plan assumes that municipal demand will increase almost directly proportionally to the projected increase in our population over the next 50 years.\n\nIn other words, the plan assumes that people will continue to use (and waste) water at the same rates as today, without any significant additional conservation efforts. Yet average residential water usage ranges from 60 gallons to over 300 gallons per person per day in different parts of Texas. Many Texans could easily cut their water usage in half – or even lower – without any real hardship.\n\nWater transfers just postpone the day of reckoning. At some point, Texans will need to take serious steps to conserve water. Shouldn’t we do it before our aquifers have been drained and our rural communities destroyed?\n\nSan Antonio’s recent actions provide a clear vision of what this means. San Antonio is building a 140-mile pipeline to transfer large amounts of groundwater from some of the best farmland in our state, draining the aquifer under Burleson and Milam Counties. At the same time, the city is negotiating a deal to have some of the water bottled for sale!\n\nWe must conserve first, transfer later!\n\nTAKE ACTION\n\nCall or email your State Representative and your State Senator, and urge them to oppose SB 1907/ HB 3298\n\nTo find out who your State legislators are:\n\ngo to www.fyi.legis.state.tx.us, or\n\ncall the Capitol Switchboard at 512-463-4630.\n\nIf you call after hours, you can simply leave a message:\n\nMy name is ____, and I am a constituent. I urge Senator/ Representative _________ to oppose SB 1907/ HB 3298_____.\n\nWe should not be spending money on a study about how to transfer water without ensuring that conservation and preservation of our water resources is placed first. And it is vital that the future of ALL Texans â€” including those that live in areas where water would be taken away from â€” be considered.\n\nIf your are a constituent of Senator Charles Perry or Representative Lyle Larson, the authors of this bill, please urge them politely to accept amendments to address these problems.\n\nIf you prefer email to phone calls, you can email your legislators once you know their names:\n\nRepresentatives: Firstname.Lastname@house.state.tx.us\n\nSenators: Firstname.Lastname@senate.state.tx.us\n\nBONUS ACTION – Contact the Calendars Committee Members\n\nThe Calendars Committee has the power to set HB 3298 for a vote by the full House â€” or stop it completely. If you live in one of these districts, PLEASE make an extra effort to call, and get as many of your friends and neighbors to call and email as possible!\n\nChairman Todd Hunter\n\nPart of Nueces County – Zip Codes 78343, 78373, 78401, 78404, 78407, 78411, 78412, 78413, 78414, 78415, 78417, 78418, 78419\n\nPhone: 512-463-0672\n\nEmail Todd.Hunter@house.state.tx.us\n\nRoberto Alonzo\n\nPart of Dallas County – Zip Codes 75050, 75051, 75052, 75060, 75203, 75208, 75211, 75212, 75216, 75224, 75233\n\nPhone: 512-463-0408\n\nEmail: Roberto.Alonzo@house.state.tx.us\n\nByron Cook\n\nAnderson, Freestone, Hill, and Navarro Counties\n\nPhone: 512-463-0730\n\nEmail: Byron.Cook@house.state.tx.us\n\nSarah Davis\n\nPart of Harris County – Zip Codes 77002, 004, 005, 006, 007, 008, 019, 024, 025, 027, 030, 046, 056, 057, 081, 096, 098, 401\n\nPhone: 512-463-0389\n\nEmail: Sarah.Davis@house.state.tx.us\n\nCharlie Geren\n\nPart of Tarrant County – Zip Codes 76020, 76052, 76071, 76107, 76108, 76114, 76116, 76127, 76131, 76135, 76179\n\nPhone: 512-463-0610\n\nEmail: Charlie.Geren@house.state.tx.us\n\nHelen Giddings\n\nPart of Dallas County – Zip Codes 75104, 75115, 75125, 75134, 75141, 75146, 75154, 75159, 75172, 75180, 75216, 75217, 75232, 75241, 75249, 75253\n\nPhone: 512-463-0953\n\nEmail: Helen.Giddings@house.state.tx.us\n\nPatricia Harless\n\nPart of Harris County – Zip Codes 77014, 77064, 77066, 77067, 77068, 77069, 77070, 77086, 77375, 77379\n\nPhone: 512-463-0496\n\nEmail: Patricia.Harless@house.state.tx.us\n\nDan Huberty\n\nPart of Harris County – Zip Code 77044, 77336, 77338, 77339, 77345, 77346, 77357, 77365, 77373, 77386, 77532\n\nPhone: 512-463-0520\n\nEmail: Dan.Huberty@house.state.tx.us\n\nEric Johnson\n\nPart of Dallas County – Zip Codes 75149, 75150, 75201, 75203, 75207, 75210, 75212, 75214, 75215, 75216, 75218, 75223, 75224, 75226, 75227, 75228\n\nPhone: 512-463-0586\n\nEmail: Eric.Johnson @house.state.tx.us\n\nKen King\n\nArmstrong, Bailey, Briscoe, Castro, Cochran, Donley, Gray, Hale, Hansford, Hemphill, Hockley, Lamb, Lipscomb, Ochiltree, Roberts, Swisher, Yoakum counties\n\nPhone: 512-463-0736\n\nEmail: Ken.King @house.state.tx.us\n\nFour Price\n\nCarson, Hutchinson, Moore, Potter, Sherman counties\n\nPhone: 512-463-0470\n\nEmail: Four.Price@house.state.tx.us\n\nDebbie Riddle\n\nPart of Harris County – zip codes 77068, 77073, 77090, 77338, 77354, 77365, 77373, 77375, 77379, 77380, 77388, 77389\n\nPhone:512-463-0572\n\nEmail: Debbie.Riddle@house.state.tx.us\n\nSpread the word about this critical issue!
