        "text": "Hundreds of Texas pastors and faith leaders rallied at the state Capitol Thursday morning in support of legislation to keep men out of little girls’ showers, restrooms, and changing areas.\n\nThough many of the attendees were successfully able to arrange an in-person hearing with their Representatives in support of the Texas Privacy Act, the group as a whole was unable to meet with Texas House State Affairs Committee Chairman Byron Cook, whose office door was locked.\n\nVIDEO: Pastors chant “Let the House vote” outside Rep. Byron Cook’s locked office door:\n\nThe group presented a letter to Texas House members who would listen, signed by more than 1,000 pastors across Texas, urging the House to allow the Texas Privacy Act to be heard on the floor.\n\nLETTER SIGNED BY 1,000+ PASTORS IN SUPPORT OF PRIVACY\n\n“I’m grateful for Texas faith leaders who value the privacy and dignity of Texas women and girls, and are standing up for us,” said Nicole Hudgens, Texas Values Policy Analyst and a speaker at a rally preceding the visits. “We can no longer allow political correctness or the bullying of big business to diminish the worth of our girls. It is time for the Texas House to find their courage and bring this legislation to the House floor for a vote.”\n\nSpeakers at the rally, held on the South Steps of the Texas Capitol this morning, also included: Privacy bill authors Sen. Lois Kolkhorst and Rep. Ron Simmons; Hernan Castano, one of the “Houston Five” pastors whose sermons were subpoenaed after taking a stand against the Houston mayor’s “bathroom ordinance;” Randy Wilson, national field director of Family Research Council; Rev. William Owens of the Council of African American Pastors; and other prominent pastors and statewide advocacy group leaders.\n\nThe event was co-sponsored by Texas Values Action, the Texas Pastor Council, Vision America, and Texas Right to Life.\n\nSome noteworthy supporters of the Texas Privacy Act include: Cindy Asmussen, Ethics and Religious Liberty Advisor (Southern Baptist of Texas Convention); Superintendent David Thweat, Harrold ISD (Texas); Trayce Bradford, Texas Eagle Forum; Sunny Cardenas, Nikki Kelton (parents in the Dripping Springs ISD); Kaeley Triller Haver, Co-Founder (Hands Across the Aisle Women’s Coalition); Dana Hodges, State Director (Concerned Women for America of Texas); Trey Holcomb, State Republican Executive Committee, SD3 (Republican Party of Texas); Jonathan Saenz, Nicole Hudgens (Texas Values Action); Jeremy Newman (Texas Home School Coalition); Dave Robbins (Concerned Christian Citizens); Gary Rodenbaugh, Business Owner (Rodenbaugh’s Flooring America and Appliances); Susan Rodriguez (Center for Preservation of American Ideals); Pastor Rick Scarborough (Vision America); Angela Smith (Fredericksburg Tea Party); Dave Welch (Texas Pastor Council Action); Coalition of African American Pastors; Family Research Council; Family Policy Alliance; and the American Family Association.\n\nMore information on the Texas Privacy Act, including videos, testimonies, press releases, and fact sheets, may be found at http://www.txvalues.org/protectprivacy\n\nAbout Texas Values"
