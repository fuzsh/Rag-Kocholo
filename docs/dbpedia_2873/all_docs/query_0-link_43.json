He graduated from Corsicana High School and spent the rest of his life serving almost 20 years in the Army National Guard, and later working in industrial mechanics.\n\nFrankie Don was a man with many hats...and if you knew him, you remember they were always cocked to one side. He was strong, stubborn and unquestionably opinionated, which he mainly attributed to his Italian roots. He was honest almost to a fault, but would give the shirt off his back to a stranger without a moment's hesitation. He was characterized by a true grit that was evident as he outlived an 18-month cancer prognosis by almost six years. He maintained this spirited personality and a tender and warm heart right up to the very last beat.\n\nFamily was everything to Frankie Don. He especially adored being \"Grumps\" to his two grandsons, picking on his daughter and waiting for her reaction of \"Oh, DAAAAD,\" and being lifelong and very best friends with his devoted sister. However, you didn't have to be blood related to be considered family with him. With arms wide open, he formed countless meaningful relationships and extended the definition of family well beyond its traditional limits.\n\nFrankie Don loved riding his motorcycle and playing golf whenever the opportunity presented itself, but mostly he enjoyed quiet time and a simple routine with his dog, Oscar, by his side.\n\nFrankie Don was a very proud Catholic and a member of Immaculate Conception Church in Corsicana. He was also a member of the Knights of Columbus and served as Grand Knight in 2013-2014.\n\nVisitation with the family will be held from 6 to 7 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 9, 2019 at Corley Funeral Home.
