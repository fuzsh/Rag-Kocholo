On Friday, Oct. 9, 2009, Dr. David Edwards went to be with the Lord and hear His words, \"Well done, good and faithful servant.\" David poured himself into the lives of thousands around the world; his greatest desire was to reach out to the lost with the life-changing message of Jesus Christ. His legacy will live on through the people whose lives have been transformed because of the outpouring of Christ through David. Born in Clovis, N.M., on Dec. 15, 1957, to Glenn and Joan Edwards, David became a lifelong follower of Jesus Christ at age 17 at Glorieta, N.M. David graduated from Clovis High School in 1976, and then attended Wayland Baptist University in Plainview where he met his lifelong sweetheart, Lyndy Dawson, daughter of Dr. George and Dorothy Dawson. Lyndy and David married on Sept. 6, 1980. Lyndy was David's greatest treasure and supporter. In 1980, he took on his first ministry position at First Baptist Church in Lyndon, Kan. During this time, David earned his Master of Divinity degree from Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. His father-in-law then encouraged him to pursue his Ph.D. degree at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth. During this time, David and Lyndy ministered at First Baptist Church in Hennipen, Okla. They were blessed to give birth to two daughters while in seminary: Kathryn Elisabeth was born in 1985, followed by Emily Grace in 1987.While writing his dissertation, David ministered at a little neighborhood church, Stadium Drive Baptist, which provided a place of service and growth for many seminary students. Dr. David Edwards accepted the call to Main Street Baptist Church in Georgetown after receiving the highest degree in ministry, a Ph.D. degree in theology, in 1992. They moved to Georgetown in January 1994, and their son, Evan James Dawson, was born the following month. David's greatest joy in life was his family. He baptized each of his children into the family of God, and they look forward to all being reunited one day in God's kingdom. He desired to give his children the gift of missions and a heart for ministry, so the Edwards family did mission work in Uganda and Brazil. David also did mission work in Madagascar, Nigeria and Ethiopia. In 2004, the family went to a conference at Focus on the Family. There, they signed a family \"Be There\" covenant, in which they all promised to meet each other at the Eastern Gate of Heaven. This document is framed and displayed in the family's living room as a constant reminder to this promise. After 12 years of dedicated service, David, Lyndy and Evan moved to Corsicana where David accepted the position of senior pastor at First Baptist Church. David was a brilliant writer and scholar, his works are published in the Biblical Illustrator, newspapers, and online. David valued education highly, and was proud to become an honorary Baylor University alumni, and delighted that both of his daughters received degrees from Baylor. He sought to teach the word of God in a manner that would challenge and prepare the people of God and particularly those preparing for a life in ministry. David Edwards lives on in the lives of his family: wife of 29 years, Lyndy, and son, Evan Edwards, of Corsicana; daughter, Emily Edwards of Pennsylvania; daughter, Kathryn Mullaney and her husband, Brian, of Georgetown; and Molly and Mason in Taiwan. Preceded in death by his father, the Rev. Glenn Edwards, David is also survived by his mother, Joan Edwards of Clovis, N.M., and brothers, Jim and Taylor Edwards. He spoke fondly of his brothers and sisters in Christ, all over the world, who are imprinted by his legacy. We will all remember that his life is not defined by death, but by his favorite verse:\"In all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" (Romans 8:37-39)Memorial services will be held at 2 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 13, at First Baptist Church in Corsicana with Dr. Milton Cunningham and Dr. Logan Cummings officiating. Interment will be in the I.O.O.F. Cemetery in Georgetown.

Honorary pallbearers will be the deacons of First Baptist Church of Corsicana. Memorials may be made to either the building fund or the missions fund at First Baptist Church, 510 W.

The car then went into a side skid into the south median, striking a fence and tree with the driver's side of the vehicle. Clemens was wearing a seat belt, the report said.\n\nThe accident was investigated by Trooper Chris Williamson, assisted by DPS Sgt. Kenneth Authier, the Blooming Grove Volunteer Fire Department and the Navarro County Sheriff's office.\n\nIn preparation for students returning to school Monday following the accident, Kari Ivey, counselor at Blooming Grove High School, contacted area church staff members. Danny Quim Miles of Central Baptist Church in Blooming Grove was one of the youth ministers contacted.\n\nWe had an assembly at 8 a.m. Monday in the auditorium, and the principal told the kids that teachers and staff members from churches were available if they wanted to talk,\n\nMiles said. He gave them the information about Cameron's death, then left it open. It was complete silence for about 15 minutes. We prayed with two or three kids, then he dismissed them to go to their classes. Miles said the accident took place Saturday night, and most people in the town of Blooming Grove knew about it on Sunday. He said it was discussed in his youth group during Sunday School that morning, and he suspected the same happened at other churches with youth.\n\nI spoke to Cameron's elder brother, Caleb, Miles said. He said several churches were helping the family. I didnt know Cameron very well, but he had been to the Lion's Den for Fifth Quarter several times ...\n\nThe kids handled it well this morning. There were tears. It is a tragic thing.\n\nFuneral arrangements for Clemens were finalized Monday.\n\nVisitation will be 6 to 8 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 20, at Griffin-Roughton Funeral Home.\n\nServices will be at 6 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 22, at Griffin-Roughton Funeral Home\n\nNotes:\n\nCorsicana Daily Sun - Oct 19, 2009, 11:50 PM CDT\n\nJoe Blanton Fogg\n\nOct 21, 1919 - Oct 18, 2009\n\nJoe B.
