        "text": "Ziggy Marley’s real estate portfolio just expanded — in a very zen way. The musician, who is the son of reggae icon Bob Marley, recently paid $5.5 million for a Toluca Lake mansion that is the epitome of calm and repose, adding to a collection of homes that also include a $3.1 million Beverly Hills house and a condo in West Hollywood. The Spanish-style home features six bedrooms and seven bathrooms, as well as a handful of idyllic outdoor spaces: a covered loggia, an outdoor kitchen, a meditation garden (complete with a giant Buddha statue) and a streaming courtyard fountain. A swimming pool, spa and a basketball court round out the cannabis entrepreneur’s very green property.\n\nIn the home itself, the property features a circular two-story foyer with a dome ceiling that has natural elements like wood and stone to create a natural, earthy vibe. The home’s kitchen and family room also feature walls of glass that open out onto the backyard, with plenty of natural light for sunny mornings and afternoons. And for evenings, the mansion will likely keep Marley warm since it has six fireplaces throughout, including two in the master suite. A wine cellar, screening room, library and bar area will be perfect for entertaining for Bob Marley's offspring.\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nInside LeBron James’s Houses: A Peek Into His Sizable Real Estate Portfolio\n\nThe NBA star owns properties in his home state of Ohio, in Florida, and in California\n\nAD Pro\n\n100 AD-Approved Interior Photographers to Book for Your Next Shoot\n\nCount on one of these vetted talents to capture your design project in its best light\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nElon Musk Now Lives in a $50,000 Prefab Tiny House in Texas\n\nAfter selling most of his real estate portfolio, the multibillionaire is now living in a 400-square-foot unit on his SpaceX Texas site\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nCiara and Russell Wilson’s Homes: Inside the Power Couple’s Real Estate Portfolio\n\nThe R&B superstar and NFL champion have owned property all over the country"
