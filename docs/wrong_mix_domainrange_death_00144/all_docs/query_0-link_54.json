        "text": "HOLLYWOOD, CA â€“ Bob Marley's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been vandalized, and it will cost $3,000 to repair it. The vandalism was discovered Monday, according to Ana Martinez of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe star appears to have been pounded on by something heavy like a sledgehammer, totally destroying it, Martinez said.\n\n\"This is considered vandalism to a State Historic Landmark,\" she said. \"It will be repaired by the Hollywood Historic Trust and will cost nearly $3,000 to repair it.\"\n\nMartinez tweeted a photo of the damaged star, along with the message: \"Why would anyone do this to Bob Marley's star? Help me understand. The Walk of Fame is a State registered Historic landmark! Disrespectful.\"\n\nThe reggae artist died in 1981. He was posthumously awarded the star, located at 7080 Hollywood Blvd., in 2001."
