        "text": "David Corio/Redferns/Getty Tyrone Downie And Bob Marley\n\nTyrone Downie, a Jamaican-born keyboardist known for his work in Bob Marley and the Wailers, has died. He was 66.\n\nThe musician died on Saturday at a hospital in Jamaica after \"feeling ill,\" his partner Bernadine Simpson reportedly told The Jamaica Gleaner. His exact cause of death is currently unknown.\n\nBorn on May 20, 1956 in Kingston, Jamaica, Downie studied at Kingston College and performed in the school's chapel choir, according to Billboard, before playing in the group Impact All Stars.\n\nThe Wailers was formed by Peter Tosh, Bunny Wailer and Marley in 1963 and became known as Bob Marley and the Wailers in 1974. Downie joined the group around that time and first contributed to 1976's Rastaman Vibration, their highest-charting album and only to reach the top 10 of the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nRELATED: Kate Middleton and Prince William Play the Drums During Visit to Bob Marley's Home in Jamaica\n\nManfred Schmid/Redferns via Getty The Wailers\n\nDownie played with the band on their subsequent five studio albums — 1977's Exodus, 1978's Kaya, 1979's Survival, 1980's Uprising and 1983's Confrontation — as well as including \"Redemption Song\" and \"Three Little Birds.\" Released two years after Marley's death at age 36 in 1981, Confrontation was the group's final album. Members of the Wailers have since reunited for several performances.\n\nIn addition to Bob Marley and the Wailers, Downie also performed with the Caribs, The Abyssinians, Beenie Man, Black Uhuru, Buju Banton, Peter Tosh, Junior Reid, Tom Tom Club, Ian Dury, Burning Spear, Steel Pulse, Alpha Blondy, Tiken Jah Fakoly and Sly & Robbie.\n\nUnbeknownst to him, the keyboardist was also the subject of Grace Jones' 1983 single \"My Jamaican Guy.\" In 2010, she revealed the song's inspiration to The Guardian. \"I couldn't have him because he was with somebody else. He was a beautiful guy. He doesn't even know I wrote it about him,\" she said at the time. \"Well, he'll know now.\"\n\nIn 2001, Downie released his first and only solo album, Organ-D.\n\nRoberto Ricciuti/Redferns/Getty Tyrone Downie\n\nRELATED: Bunny Wailer, Reggae Icon and Founder of The Wailers, Dead at 73\n\nAccording to The Gleaner, he is survived by nine children, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.\n\nFollowing the news of Downie's death, Marley's official Twitter account (run by his estate) shared a tribute to his late collaborator. \"Reflecting on brother Tyrone Downie, Bob's keyboardist, who made his transition yesterday. Rest in peace brother,\" read the post."
