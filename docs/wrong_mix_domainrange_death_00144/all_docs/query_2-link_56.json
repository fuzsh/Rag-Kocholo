        "meta_description": "Considered the hub of Reggae music, the Bob Marley Mausoleum located in the heart of St Annâ€™s Parish's Nine Mile is not only credited as the resting place but also the birthplace of the legendary Bob Marley. This humble cottage was where the Jamaican great spent thirteen years of his childhood and the place still manages to maintain its original look and feel even after refurbishment. The folks who maintain the house have done a commendable job of preserving the furniture and its position in the layout, offering a truly authentic touring experience for its guests. The mausoleum is a small white house where the tomb is located 1.83 meters (6 feet) above the ground, a peaceful place of reverence for the world famous Robert Nesta Marley. The site also features attractions like his iconic 'Rock Pillow' which inspired him to write so many of his songs.",
