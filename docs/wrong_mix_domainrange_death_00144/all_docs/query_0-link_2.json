        "text": "By the time Marley finished recording the tracks for Uprising and Confrontation in 1979, day to day was all he had left, though nobody seemed to know it. In 1980, he began a lengthy tour, with the goal of reaching the American black audience that had proved so elusive to him. At New York’s Madison Square Garden on Saturday, September 20th, Marley almost passed out onstage. He woke up the next day feeling confused, unable to remember clearly what had happened the night before. That morning, while jogging in Central Park with a friend, his body froze up and he fell forward, unable to help himself. Later, he saw a doctor who told him the news he had long been afraid to hear: His blackout had been due to a brain tumor. Later tests revealed that the cancer had spread through his lungs, liver and brain, and was untreatable. He probably had another ten weeks to live.\n\nNobody had informed Rita Marley about her husband’s fall in Central Park or about the diagnosis of his tumor. She was touring with Marley in her customary role as the leader of his harmony group, the I-Threes, but she was traveling separately. She didn’t see him until two days later, before the next scheduled show in Pittsburgh; he looked astonishingly older and thinner than a few nights earlier. When Marley gave her the news, Rita insisted that the tour be canceled immediately, but, according to Timothy White’s account, she was told by one handler that since Marley was going to die anyway, they should simply continue with the tour. Marley went onstage that night in Pittsburgh and played his full show, but that was as far as he could go. The tour ended there. He visited cancer clinics in New York, Miami and Mexico, then traveled to Bavaria, in Germany, to submit to the care of Dr. Josef Issels, who practiced controversial approaches to cancer therapy. Marley would live another eight months — much longer than anybody had predicted.\n\nRita Marley stayed close to her husband throughout this time. Their marriage had been neither simple nor painless for her. Marley had grown distant from his wife as his career began to ascend in the early 1970s. He saw other women, and he fathered at least seven children outside his marriage. (Marley and Rita had four children of their own.) Even so, he could be intensely possessive of his wife, and on one occasion, wrote Rita, her husband almost raped her when she tried to refuse him sex. She thought about divorcing him, but she believed the bond of their partnership ran too deep and that Marley still needed her protection. As Marley’s life was closing, the disease had drained him so much that he cried out, “God, take me, please.” Rita writes that she held him and sang to him until she began to cry. Marley looked up at her, and with what voice he had left, he said, “Don’t cry. Keep singing.”\n\nBob Marley died in Miami on May 11th, 1981. He was thirty-six. His body was flown to Jamaica, where the new prime minister, Edward Seaga — who had bestowed Jamaica’s Order of Merit, one of the country’s highest honors, on Marley a month before his death — ordered a state funeral. It was a belated gesture from a government that had never really respected the man, his concerns or his music. But anything less would have been unthinkable.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nOn May 20th, a national day of mourning, 12,000 people viewed Marley’s body as it lay in state at the Kingston National Arena, and another 10,000 waited outside. The next day, the arena was filled to capacity for his funeral. As a pickup truck bore his coffin back to his birthplace, Nine Miles, hundreds of cars followed. Thousands of Jamaicans — not just Rastas — lined the roads all the way to glimpse the cortege. According to a 1982 account in the Village Voice, Marley’s coffin was placed inside a mausoleum atop a hill at Nine Miles, and a sacred seal was affixed. A wire grill and boards and wet cement were applied to the front of the burial place to protect the body’s sanctity. Ten thousand voices cried, “Hail him! Praise him!” over and over. Darkness fell and a sound blared through a speaker, ringing off the surrounding hills to the valley below. It was the sound of Marley singing “Redemption Song,” and it played as a tribute to the land and people that Marley had tried to speak for.\n\nIn the years since Marley’s death, his legacy has only grown, though it’s also been the object of numerous troubles. In the past twenty-four years, it has seemed that everybody who was ever close to him has sued one another, or said unkind things. In her book, Rita Marley tells her side of an incident in which former Wailers Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer — who didn’t attend Marley’s funeral — refused her offer to participate in their late partner’s legacy, telling her that the wages of Marley’s sins had brought on his own death. In 1987, Tosh was murdered during a robbery at his home. He was forty-two.\n\nRelated"
