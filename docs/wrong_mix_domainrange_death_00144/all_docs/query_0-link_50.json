        "text": "In 2017, The Voice alum John Legend was selected to perform at one of the world's most honorable events: the Nobel Peace Prize Award ceremony. There, he fittingly covered a powerful and moving tune: \"Redemption Song\" by a pioneer for peace, Bob Marley.\n\nA recap of his performance: Legend began to play some intricate piano notes before singing the track's lyrics with full-force vibrato. He performed the deep lyrics with gusto, riffing gently at times. Legend fully immersed himself in the music in the best way, paying respect to those making the greatest strides for progress in society.\n\nWatch the performance here.\n\nAbout \"Redemption Song\" by Bob Marley\n\nReleased in 1980, \"Redemption Song\" is distinct from Marley's previous songs â€” it's a ballad accompanied by an acoustic guitar only. The deeply personal lyrics revolve around making peace with one's place in life despite hardships. It's considered to be one of Marley's greatest works.\n\nRELATED: This Video Shows Just How Many Hit Songs John Legend Helped Make"
