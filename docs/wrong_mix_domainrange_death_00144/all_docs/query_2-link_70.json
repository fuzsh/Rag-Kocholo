        "text": "Bob Marley House Tour in Kingston, Jamaica\n\nThe Bob Marley Museum is the former home of the reggae legend. Bob’s home is filled with rich memories and treasured mementos, which seek to preserve the life and accomplishment of this great Jamaican and outstanding musician.\n\nEnter the Museum and allow us to envelop you with the sights and sounds of Bob, as you take a guided tour of this Jamaican Heritage Site. Our friendly, charming and knowledgeable guides will escort you through the grounds, which include the main house, exhibition hall, theatre, gift shops and the One Love Café.\n\nAll the original rooms have been kept as they were when Bob lived here to ensure authenticity. The displays include a life size 3-dimensional hologram of Bob from the One Love Peace Concert in 1978, his Grammy Lifetime Achievement award, his personal recording studio, his bedroom, favourite clothing, a vast array of gold and platinum records received from all around the world, as well as the costumes of his back-up singers, the I-Threes.\n\nThe air-conditioned theatre boasts modern state-of-the-art projection equipment, where live performances of Bob are showcased to each guided tour. The One Love Café serves Marley inspired recipes and juices, and you will find a variety of Bob Marley souvenir items available at the Bob Marley Gift Shop.\n\nTour Accessibility and Activity Level\n\nThis 75-minute cultural excursion is a leisurely walk and is partially handicap accessible for guests with collapsible wheelchairs and walkers. Please be mindful, however, that the house itself is a two-storey building with narrow stairs. Three restrooms are available to patrons along the tour pathway. We suggest international guests wear comfortable clothing including walking shoes. As with all tropical climes, insect repellent, sunscreen and attention to hydration are encouraged.\n\n1 hour and 15 minutes (including a 20-minute video presentation)"
