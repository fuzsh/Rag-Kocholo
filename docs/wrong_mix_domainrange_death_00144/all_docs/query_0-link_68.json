        "text": "A village in Serbia has unveiled what officials are saying is Europe's first statue of late reggae legend Bob Marley, as a symbol of tolerance in the region, which is still recovering from civil war.\n\n\"Bob Marley promoted peace and tolerance in his music,\" said Mirko Miljus, one of the organizers, at the unveiling at midnight local time on Saturday.\n\nTwo musicians — one from Croatia and another from Serbia — presented the monument in the village of Banatski Sokolac. The ceremony came during a gathering of rock bands from the Balkans.\n\nFollowing the breakup of the former Yugoslavia and the vicious civil war that erupted in the 1990s, people from the different ethnic groups have struggled to come together.\n\nThis latest monument seems to follow a new Balkan tradition of honouring celebrities that have little to do with the region. Bosnians have erected a monument to Bruce Lee in the town of Mostar and Serbs have put up a statue to Rocky Balboa in northern Serbia.\n\nMarley, of Jamaica, died in 1981 at age 36.\n\nHis famous tunes include No Woman, No Cry, Could You Be Loved, Stir It Up, I Shot the Sheriff, One Love, Redemption Song and Buffalo Soldier."
