        "text": "Doherty starred in a number of hit 90s TV shows including Charmed\n\nShannen Doherty, star of 90s hit TV shows Beverly Hills 90210 and Charmed, has died at the age of 53.\n\nIn a statement released by People magazine, Shannen's publicist Leslie Sloane said: \"It is with a heavy heart that I confirm the passing of actress Shannen Doherty.\n\n\"On Saturday, July 13, she lost her battle with cancer after many years of fighting the disease. The devoted daughter, sister, aunt and friend was surrounded by her loved ones as well as her dog, Bowie. The family asks for their privacy at this time so they can grieve in peace.\"\n\nDoherty had been battling breast cancer since she was first diagnosed with the disease in 2015. Since December 2016, Doherty had been receiving chemotherapy for the condition, and described the experience as \"frightening\".\n\nAs well as her breast cancer, she revealed that she had a brain tumour removed last year in an attempt to halt the spread of her disease.\n\nHowever, last year she announced that her cancer has spread to other parts of her body, including her bones.\n\nDoherty's acting career first began in 1989 when she played the role of Heather Duke in the teen comedy film Heathers.\n\nBut it was not until 1990 when she took on the role of Brenda in Beverly Hills 90210 that her career began to take off.\n\nDoherty received praise across her time on the show for her portrayal of Brenda, who was a student who had moved from Minnesota to Los Angeles, and struggled to adapt to the new lifestyle.\n\nSome of Shannen's 90210 co-stars have paid tribute including Jennie Garth who played Kelly Taylor: 'I am still processing my tremendous grief over the loss of my long time friend Shannen, the woman I have often described as one of the strongest people I have ever known. Our connection was real and honest. We were so often pitted against each other but none of that reflected the truth of our real relationship which was one built on mutual respect and admiration.\n\n'She was courageous, passionate, determined and very loving and generous. I will miss her and will always honor her deeply in my heart and in my memories. My heart breaks for her family and Bowie and all the people who loved her. ðŸ’”'\n\nJason Priestly, who played Brandon, the twin to Brenda, wrote: \"Shocked and saddened to hear about the passing of my friend Shannen. She was a force of nature and I will miss her. Sending love and light to her family in this dark time..\"\n\nBrian Austin Green and Tori Spelling both paid tribute on Instagram stories, with Brian writing: 'Shan. My sister. You loved me through everything. You were a big part of my understanding of love. I'll miss you more than I know how to process right now. Thank you for the gift of you' and Tori writing: 'I don't have outward words yet, but WE knew and that's what matters.'\n\nShannen's Charmed co-stars also paid tribute, with Bryan Krause who played Leo writing:\n\nAlyssa Milano, who played Phoebe, acknowledged her 'complicated' relationship with Shannen in a statement to Entertainment Weekly: 'It's no secret that Shannen and I had a complicated relationship, but at its core was someone I deeply respected and was in awe of. She was a talented actress, beloved by many, and the world is less without her. My condolences to all who loved her.\"\n\nCelebrities who have passed away in 2024\n\nHear all the latest news from across the UK on the hour, every hour, on Greatest Hits Radio on DAB, at greatesthitsradio.co.uk, and on the Greatest Hits Radio app."
