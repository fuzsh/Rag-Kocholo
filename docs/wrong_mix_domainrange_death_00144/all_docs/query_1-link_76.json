        "text": "When was Bob Marley born and who were his parents?\n\nBob Marley & The Wailers - Jamming (Official Music Video)\n\nBob Marley was born on February 6, 1945, on the farm of his maternal grandfather in Nine Mile, Jamaica, to Norval Sinclair Marley (1885–1955) and Cedella Booker (1926–2008).\n\nNorval was a white Jamaican originally from Sussex, England. Bob Marley's full name is Robert Nesta Marley.\n\nIn 1955, when Bob was 10, his father died of a heart attack at the age of 70. His mother went on to marry Edward Booker, an American civil servant, giving Bob two American brothers.\n\nHow did he get his start in music?\n\nMarley Official Trailer\n\nBob Marley and Neville Livingston (later Bunny Wailer) had been childhood friends in Nine Mile.\n\nThey had started to play music together while at Stepney Primary and Junior High School.\n\nSoon after, he was in a vocal group with Wailer, Peter Tosh, Beverley Kelso and Junior Braithwaite. Singer Joe Higgs took Marley under his wing, teaching him how to play the guitar.\n\nWho was Bob Marley's wife and how many children did he have?\n\nBob Marley married Alpharita Constantia 'Rita' Anderson in Kingston, Jamaica, on February 10, 1966.\n\nWho is Bob Marley's wife Rita Marley? Singer's age, family, children and career explained\n\nMarley had many children: four with wife Rita, two adopted from Rita's previous relationships, and several others with different women.\n\nHis official website acknowledges 11 children.\n\nHis most famous children include singer Ziggy Marley (pictured, who recorded the theme tune to kids' TV show 'Arthur'), musician Stephen Marley, footballer Rohan Marley, singer Julian Marley and reggae artist Damian Marley.\n\nHis children are:\n\nSharon, born 1964, daughter of Rita from a previous relationship but then adopted by Marley\n\nCedella, born 1967, to Rita\n\nDavid 'Ziggy', born 1968, to Rita\n\nStephen, born 1972, to Rita\n\nRobert 'Robbie', born 1972, to Pat Williams\n\nRohan, born 1972, to Janet Hunt\n\nKaren, born 1973 to Janet Bowen\n\nStephanie, born 1974; according to Cedella Booker, she was the daughter of Rita and a man called Ital, but was acknowledged as Bob's daughter\n\nJulian, born 1975, to Lucy Pounder\n\nKy-Mani, born 1976, to Anita Belnavis\n\nDamian, born 1978, to Cindy Breakspeare\n\nWhen and how did Bob Marley die?\n\nIn July 1977, Marley was diagnosed with a malignant melanoma under the nail of a toe.\n\nHow did Bob Marley die? The Wailers icon's untimely death explained 40 years on\n\nMarley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated due to his religious beliefs, and the nail and nail bed were removed and a skin graft taken from his thigh as a cover.\n\nIn 1980, the cancer had spread throughout his body. While he was flying from Germany to Jamaica, his condition worsened. After landing in Miami, he died on May 11, 1981, at the age of 36.\n\nWas Bob Marley shot?\n\nOn December 3, 1976, two days before a free concert organised by Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley to ease tension between two fighting political groups, Marley, his wife, and manager Don Taylor were wounded by unknown gunmen inside Marley's home.\n\nTaylor and Marley's wife had serious injuries, but made full recoveries. Bob Marley received minor wounds in the chest and arm. The attempt on his life was thought to have been political, as many felt the concert was supporting Manley.\n\nWhat was Bob Marley's religion?\n\nBob Marley was a member of the Rastafari movement, whose culture was a key element in the growth of reggae.\n\nHe became a proponent of Rastafari, taking its music out of the socially deprived areas of Jamaica, and onto an international audience.\n\nArchbishop Abuna Yesehaq baptised Marley into the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, giving him the name Berhane Selassie, on November 4, 1980, soon before his death."
