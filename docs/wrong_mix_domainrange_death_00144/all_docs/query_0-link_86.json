        "text": "Outdoor movies combine two things we love about L.A.: an appreciation of movie-making and spending as much time as possible outside. Alfresco screenings usually start to pop up across the city in the early spring and continue into the fall and holiday season, be it atop rooftop bars, at L.A.â€™s best parks or even at a Hollywood cemetery.\n\nMost of our favorite outdoor series fall into two formats: Alfresco screenings where moviegoers bring their own chair or blanket and can pack together some picnic food, and rooftop ones where youâ€™ll be offered a seat and some on-site snacks as you catch films both old and new. (If youâ€™re looking for a fun date idea, this one takes the cake.) Be sure to check back all year long for updates on the list, as new screenings are always being added.\n\nLooking to see a new movie any night of the week? Check out the best movie theaters in L.A. or the few remaining old-school drive-in movie theaters. And for some at-home inspiration, you can always catch up on the best L.A. movies of all time.\n\nFor screenings with multiple movies on a single night, each film is separately ticketed unless otherwise noted. Also, movie selections tend to change, but weâ€™ll do our best to keep the list below updated on a weekly basis.\n\nA month-by-month calendar of L.A.â€™s outdoor movies\n\nJuly\n\nJuly 1\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents Grease at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nJuly 2\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents White Chicks at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nJuly 3\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents Drive Me Crazy at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nJuly 4\n\nCinespia presents Rocky + Fireworks at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents Independence Day + A Nightmare on Elm Street at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nTropicana Movie Nights presents Jaws at the Hollywood Roosevelt.\n\nJuly 5\n\nCinespia presents Charlieâ€™s Angels + Fireworks at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.\n\nMovies at the Steps presents Little Giants at the Culver Steps.\n\nMovies on the Roof presents Independence Day at Westfield Fashion Square.\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents Dirty Dancing + Independence Day at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nJuly 6\n\nCinespia presents Shrek 2 + Fireworks at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.\n\nMovies on the Roof presents Top Gun at Westfield Fashion Square.\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents The Sandlot + The Blackening at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nStreet Food Cinema presents National Treasure at the Autry.\n\nStreet Food Cinema presents The Devil Wears Prada at Grand Hope Park.\n\nJuly 7\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents 10 Things I Hate About You at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nSummer Poolside Cinema presents Independence Day at the Fairmont Miramar Hotel & Bungalows Santa Monica.\n\nJuly 8\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents La La Land at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nJuly 9\n\nMoonlight Movies on the Beach presents The Meg at Granada Beach.\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents Bob Marley: One Love at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nJuly 10\n\nCinespia presents Sausage Party: Foodtopia at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.\n\nJuly 11\n\nFilms in the Forest presents Selena at TreePeople.\n\nMoonlight Movies on the Beach presents Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 at Long Beach City College, Liberal Arts Campus.\n\nNight Flix Series presents Migration at Plaza West Covina.\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy + Juice at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nTropicana Movie Nights presents Moana at the Hollywood Roosevelt.\n\nJuly 12\n\nMovies at the Steps presents Stuart Little at the Culver Steps.\n\nMovies on the Roof presents West Side Story at Westfield Fashion Square.\n\nOC Parks Sunset Cinema presents Trolls Band Together at Mason Regional Park (Irvine).\n\nOutdoor Movies at the Skirball presents Panâ€™s Labyrinth at the Skirball.\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents American Pie + Goodfellas at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nThe LA Phil presents Maestro of the Movies: The Music of John Williams and More at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nJuly 13\n\nCinespia presents Midsommar at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.\n\nClassic Films Under the Stars presents Crime Wave at Brand Park (Glendale).\n\nMovies on the Roof presents Moulin Rouge! at Westfield Fashion Square.\n\nMovies Under the Stars presents Pitch Perfect at One Colorado (Pasadena).\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents White Chicks + Scream at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nStreet Food Cinema presents Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles at the Autry.\n\nStreet Food Cinema presents The Princess Diaries at Will Rogers State Historic Park.\n\nThe LA Phil presents Maestro of the Movies: The Music of John Williams and More at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nJuly 14\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents The Greatest Showman at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nSummer Poolside Cinema presents Sideways at the Fairmont Miramar Hotel & Bungalows Santa Monica.\n\nThe LA Phil presents Maestro of the Movies: The Music of John Williams and More at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nJuly 15\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents The Notebook at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nJuly 16\n\nMoonlight Movies on the Beach presents The Princess Bride at Granada Beach.\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents Almost Famous at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nJuly 17\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents 500 Days of Summer at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nJuly 18\n\nTropicana Movie Nights presents Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl at the Hollywood Roosevelt.\n\nJuly 19\n\nMovies & Moonlight presents Barbie at 2nd & PCH (Long Beach).\n\nMovies at the Steps presents Honey, I Shrunk the Kids at the Culver Steps.\n\nMovies on the Roof presents Clueless at Westfield Fashion Square.\n\nOC Parks Sunset Cinema presents Barbie at Yorba Regional Park (Anaheim).\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents The Wood + The Blair Witch Project at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nSummer Movie Nights presents The Little Mermaid at Hart Park (Santa Clarita).\n\nThe LA Phil presents Disney â€™80s-â€™90s Celebration in Concert at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nJuly 20\n\nCinespia presents Empire Records at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.\n\nFilms in the Forest presents FernGully: The Last Rainforest at TreePeople.\n\nMovies on the Roof presents Romeo + Juliet at Westfield Fashion Square.\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents La La Land at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nStreet Food Cinema presents Jurassic Park at L.A.
