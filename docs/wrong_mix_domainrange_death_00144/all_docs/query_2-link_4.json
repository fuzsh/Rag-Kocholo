        "text": "Village in Saint Ann, Jamaica\n\nNine Mile (Jamaican Creole: Nain Mail or Nain Mailz) is a district in Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica, a few miles south of Brown's Town. The population was about 300 in 2009. On February 6, 1945, reggae musician Bob Marley was born in Nine Mile, and he was later buried there. The house in which Marley resided and the mausoleum in which his body and that of his mother Cedella Booker lies, is also located in Nine Mile.\n\nNine Mile is where Bob Marley's musical career began and also influenced many of his songs.[1]\n\nThe Bob Marley Mausoleum in Nine Mile is a tourist attraction managed by members of Bob Marley's living family. It features many of Marley's historical artifacts, including guitars, awards, and photographs.\n\nThere is a Rasta-colored ‘rock pillow’ on which Marley laid his head when seeking inspiration. His body lies buried along with his guitar in a 2.5 m-tall (8.2 ft) oblong marble mausoleum inside a small church of traditional Ethiopia design. [2]\n\nThere are two mausoleums on the property. The first is that of Marley's mother, Cedella Booker, known as Mama Marley. The second contains Bob Marley's remains."
