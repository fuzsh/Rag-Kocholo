        "text": "The Cooper Family\n\nYes, those Coopers – the ones who had the famous CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. For those who don’t know, Cooper comes from a long line of celebrities. His father was famed American author and screenwriter Wyatt Emory Cooper and his mother was socialite heiress Gloria Vanderbilt.\n\nAbove we see them in a beautiful family portrait while lounging on their sofa at their luxurious Southampton, Long Island home. The photo was taken in 1972, although some of the décor seems to be from the 1900s. We love the kids’ pristine white suits, Gloria’s gorgeous navy style outfit, and Wyatt’s funky striped suit, but the purple plaid sofa we’re not so sure about. We would love to know where Gloria got those ceramic lettuce ornaments.\n\nJohn Lennon and Yoko Ono\n\nIt was the summer of 1971 and the Beatles had recently released their legendary album “Let it Be.” The band’s lead singer John Lennon and his girl Yoko Ono were one of the most famous couples in the world at the time, and here we see them hanging out in their home. In what seems to be their furniture-less living room in their gorgeous country house in Tittenhurst Park, UK, the couple sits for an interview.\n\nJohn is of course wearing his signature little round shades, and some groovy pants. But Yoko takes the fashion award, with those black pantyhose and the caramel-colored pumps. Not to mention that long-sleeved flowered blouse.\n\nMick Jagger\n\nNo one embodies rock’n’roll – and especially old school rock n’ roll - like Rolling Stones’ frontman Mick Jagger. His iconic moves, outfits, and facial expressions have influenced generations, and continue to do so to this day. Here is good old Mick Jagger as a young man hanging out in the kitchen of his London apartment.\n\nAs it turns out, this photo was taken while Jagger was spending one short day in London between leaving for Indonesia for a holiday and then to the U.S. We love everything about this photo – his hair, his black jacket, the rotary phone, and the wooden furniture. Oh, the good old 1970s.\n\nRip Torn and Terry Southern\n\nYou might remember Rip Torn as the talented actor that played Artie, on the famous “The Larry Sanders Show” sitcom. Torn would be the one sitting on the medieval-looking wooden throne, and to this right is famed screenwriter, author, and satirist Terry Southern, holding a drink and wearing some really groovy glasses.\n\nThe photo was taken in 1973, in Rip Torn’s Chelsea apartment. The two had become friends because some years back, Southern worked on the script for the legendary cult film “Easy Rider,” and Torn was meant to play Jack Nicholson’s role, but ultimately lost out to the actor.\n\nJack Nicholson\n\nLeave it to the legendary Jack Nicholson to look like a boss in this stylish black and white photo. It was taken on May 25, 1974, while Nicholson struck a pose next to his pool, smoking a Cuban cigar and wearing a robe. Pretty classy!\n\nThe “Chinatown” star was in France for the Cannes International Film Festival of that year. And this photo truly embodies Nicholson’s playful spirit – a talented icon that knew how to enjoy life in style. Nicholson went on to star in some of cinema history’s most iconic films. And we truly miss seeing him on screen.\n\nDebbie Harry and Chris Stein\n\nA true ode to the 70s – rockstar queen Debbie Harry, lead singer of Blondie, and her partner and guitarist Chris Stein cook in their New York apartment kitchen. Harry and Stein were together for 16 years, and for much of that time they shared a very typical, stylish, boho apartment in New York.\n\nThis photo was taken in 1975, and there you have the Elvis calendar and weird-looking ornament on top to prove it. But even more interesting than this adorable couple throwing salt on something, or the gorgeous Debbie, are those oven mitts. They seem to be some kind of cow with red pompoms for ears, and we want them!\n\nWarren Beatty\n\nHere we see famous American actor and 70s heartthrob Warren Beatty in all his glory (and amazing hair!) sitting in his living room in 1975. This phenomenal actor dominated the films of the 60s, 70s, 80s and even 90s, starring in classics like “Bonnie and Clyde,” “Bugsy,” “Dick and Tracy,” “Bulworth,” and of course, who could forget “Shampoo,” alongside Goldie Hawn and Julie Christie.\n\nBeatty was one of the most coveted actors, and men, of the 70s. But ultimately, it was fellow actress Anette Bening who stole his heart – the two have been married since 1992 and have four children. They met on the set of the classic film “Bugsy,” released in 1991.\n\nTruman Capote\n\nOne of the most famous authors and playwrights in American history, Truman Capote produced some of the world’s most important works of literature. With his classics like “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” and “In Cold Blood,” he became a true crime master and icon of the literary world. Not surprisingly, he was also a wildly interesting and flashy man, with a very unique sense of style and high-profile celebrity friends.\n\nAbove we see the master Capote in his United Nations Plaza home in 1980, sitting beside that magnificent vintage lamp and what seems to be a drawing of a cartoon pig. But his wine-colored fedora hat takes it all.\n\nElton John\n\nThe “Rocket Man” singer is perhaps one of the most influential and famous musicians of all time, with a career spanning over five decades. John has not only produced music masterpieces but has also been a fierce advocate of LGBTQ and HIV founding a number of charities and donating to a number of organizations.\n\nHere we can see him playfully sitting on a small motorbike in front of his four astonishing cars, amongst them a Rolls Royce and a Mercedes. As always, John is the king of style – wearing some shiny pumps, a very 70s-looking striped vest, and groovy sunglasses.\n\nLiberace\n\nIf anyone told us this bathroom belonged to anyone other than piano prodigy Liberace, we wouldn’t have believed them. Here is the famous singer, musician, and actor with an illustrious career spanning over 40 years. Liberace being Liberace, decided to pose in his home while taking a luxurious bubble bath during a TV special called “A Day in the Life of Liberace.”\n\nApart from the $55,000 marble bathtub (and that’s just the bathtub, please note the entire bathroom is made of marble!), we have the golden cherub statue that works as a towel holder, the opulent swan faucet, and basically every single detail in this room screams…Liberace!\n\nChristopher Knight\n\nBefore they made countless movies and show remakes of “The Brady Bunch,” there was the original sitcom that aired in 1969. And Christopher Knight played Peter Brady throughout the show’s famous five seasons. Here is Knight as a young man sitting in his home in San Fernando Valley, California.\n\nThe year was 1977, so the brown, flared pants and the puffy haircut are more than justified – and that dog seems to be quite a character. Even though his peak fame came from his star role in “The Brady Bunch,” Knight went on to become a successful businessman and did some minor cameos on several TV shows later in life.\n\nThe Osmonds\n\nJust like The Jackson 5, the Osmonds were a famous family music group from the 1970s that skyrocketed to fame in the early years of the decade. This photo, taken in 1974, shows the Osmond family sitting at their dinner table at home; from left to right we have Marie, Merrill, Wayne, Alan, Jay, Donny, and Jimmy.\n\nThe musical group started out as a quintet in 1970, featuring only Merrill, Wayne, Alan, Jay, and Donny, but as the years went by, Marie and Jimmy joined in. Active for over 10 years, the Osmonds released some of the era’s most famous pop and country songs, including “Double Lovin',” “One Bad Apple,” and “Crazy Horses.”\n\nClint Eastwood\n\nMasterful actor and director Clint Eastwood has had an incredible career since the 1950s. Eastwood has starred in cinema history’s most famous Western films, directed award-winning movies, and even served as mayor for a beach city in California. This man is a legend for a reason, and it’s not just his cool style and demeanor, which are evident in the photo below.\n\nTaken in 1978, a year before he went on to star in the classic film “Escape from Alcatraz,” this photo shows Eastwood sitting at his Pebble Beach, Carmel, California home. Just like the roles he plays, Eastwood looks stoic and handsome as he glares over at the camera with that trademark look of his.\n\nPattie Boyd\n\nOne of the most telling things about the 60s and 70s was fashion, especially when it came to women. And as the cradle of the ‘swingin’ sixties’, London set the standard for the typical British female look of the decade – and model Pattie Boyd was one of the leading ladies.\n\nApart from being a gorgeous international model, Boyd was also a very talented photographer with a thing for musicians. She was married to the famous Beatle George Harrison for over 10 years, and then to Eric Clapton. Above we see a beautiful, young Boyd in 1969 about to leave her home in the U.K., that she shared with Harrison.\n\nFreddie Mercury\n\nFreddie Mercury will forever be remembered as one of the greatest singers in rock music history. With his rare four-octave vocal range, his unique personality, and his boldness when it came to experimenting with never-before-heard sounds, Mercury changed the world of rock forever. As the lead singer of Queen, one of the world’s greatest rock bands to this day, he led an incredible life and career.\n\nAbove we see a young Mercury 1969 playing his guitar in at his apartment in Shepherds Bush, London. He was sitting in his living room doing an interview with the Daily Express, in case you were curious.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger\n\nThis man needs no introduction, as we all know and love the famous bodybuilder, actor, and ex-governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger. Born in Austria, Schwarzenegger started his career as a bodybuilder from a young age, and then skyrocketed to fame in the 80s when he starred in the epic film saga “The Terminator.”\n\nFrom then on, he went on to act in several classic films, including “Total Recall,” “Conan the Barbarian,” and “Predator.” Above we see a young Arnie pouring some champagne in his home in Los Angeles back in 1977. Apart from that cute haircut, our favorite thing about this old-school photo is those champagne glasses.\n\nHerve Villechaize\n\nYou might not recognize this famous actor at first glance but take a closer look and you’ll realize it’s none other than Tattoo, Mr. Roarke’s assistant in the hit 870s series “Fantasy Island.” Villechaize made his acting debut in 1974’s “The Man with the Golden Gun,” as the villain Nick Nack, and then starred in “Fantasy Island” from 1977 to 1983. His signature phrase announcing newcomers on the island, “Da plane! Da plane!,” became the series’ most famous line.\n\nAbove we see a young Villechaize posing in his Paris apartment in 1973, dressed as Sherlock Holmes. The man with tiny stature but a huge personality and talent made waves in the entertainment world during the 70s. Unfortunately, deteriorating health conditions led him to take his own life in 1993.\n\nChuck Norris\n\nIn true 70s style and swagger, legendary martial artist and actor Chuck Norris enjoys a cup of coffee in his garden, next to his then-wife Dianne Holechek. The “Walker, Texas Ranger” star made his fame as a master in martial arts and then went on to become the default leading man of action movies in the 70s and 80s.\n\nHis acting debut, however, was made in the epic 1972 film alongside Bruce Lee, “The Way of the Dragon.” The photo above was taken in 1978, in Norris’s home in Palos Verdes, California. In the same year, he starred in the classic action film “Good Guys Wear Black.”\n\nJane Seymour\n\nIn this gorgeous photo, we see British actress Jane Seymour at her Hollywood Hills home in California, in 1979. Enjoying some downtime in her hot tub, Seymour glances back at the camera with her signature, piercing look. Seymour made her fame after starring in the 1973 James Bond film “Live or Let Die,” and then went on to play the role of Dr. Quinn, in the hit sitcom from the 90s, “Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.”\n\nSeymour continues to act to this day, having been in supporting roles in several films through the last two decades, including “Wedding Crashers,” “The War with Grandpa,” “Harry Wild,” and more.\n\nJane Fonda\n\nActress, rights activist, Academy-award winner, and TV fitness queen Jane Fonda has led an amazing life and an impressive career. Born to celebrity royalty, her dad Henry Fonda was a brilliant actor of the 40s and 50s, and Jane and her brother Peter became A-list actors in their own right. Perhaps her most famous role was as the sexy space adventurer “Barbarella,” in 1968.\n\nBut above we see a much more intimate glimpse into the life of an icon, in this photo taken in 1975 of Jane, her husband Tom Hayden, and her children, Troy and Vanessa. Sitting in their garden at their Santa Monica home in California, it seems the couple were discussing some important matters. At the time, Hayden was running for U.S. State Senate.\n\nJoan Jett\n\nUltimate rocker girl Joan Jett is seen in this nostalgic photo taken in 1977. You can tell it’s a 19-year-old’s bedroom – a 19-year-old with great taste in music, that is. Jet is practicing on her guitar while she poses for a photo in her room at her family’s home in Los Angeles, California. The record player, the vinyl records, the vintage curtains, everything about this photo is giving us intense retro vibes.\n\nJett rose to fame as the guitarist of the rock band “The Runaways,” formed in 1975. A year later, the band released their famous song “Cherry Bomb,” which topped music charts all over the world. Jett went on to become the lead singer and frontwoman of her own band, “Joan Jett and the Blackhearts,” which she started in 1980.\n\nDavid Hasselhoff\n\nWe all know him as Mitch Buchannon from the popular 90s shows “Baywatch,” but David Hasselhoff was a regular on television long before that. The actor, TV persona, and singer made his acting debut as Dr. Snapper Foster, in the hit show from the 70s, “The Young and The Restless,” and then made waves as the star of “Knight Rider,” in the 80s.\n\nHasselhoff poses for the photo above in 1979, as a young 27-year-old, while listening and singing to a Ted Nugent record. The photo was taken in his Hollywood home, and can we just say, we really miss that hairdo, Dave!\n\nStewart Copeland\n\nIn a true rock star’s room, the photo below shows a young Stewart Copeland making music in his studio at home, in 1979. Copeland is best known for being the drummer of “The Police” for over a decade, during the band’s peak years. Apart from being an incredible drummer, Copeland is also a reputed composer who has been writing songs and recording his own music for over 30 years.\n\nCopeland started out drumming for an English rock band called “Curved Air,” before meeting Sting and founding “The Police.” This photo says it all - a true musician, wearing sunglasses indoors, holding his black hat, playing one of his four electric guitars, and surrounded by amazing music posters.\n\nHarrison Ford and Mark Hamill\n\nHere we have Han Solo and Luke Skywalker sitting in a living room back in 1980, just three years after the release of the first-ever “Star Wars” film, “Episode IV- A New Hope.” Mark Hamill appears to be reading from a script, which we can assume was for the third “Star Wars” film, “Return of the Jedi.”\n\nThis is because the photo was taken on May 1st, 1980, just a few weeks before the release of the second film in the original trilogy, “The Empire Strikes Back”. Harrison Ford, on the other hand, seems to be reading something else entirely, and whatever it is, he’s quite focused on it.\n\nJoan Didion\n\nThe brilliant American writer Joan Didion was an icon of the counterculture movement of the 60s and 70s. Didion wrote about social and political realities of the times, the Hollywood lifestyle, and her dear hometown of California, and this Pulitzer Prize nominee and award-winning writer’s career began with an essay she wrote for “Vogue Magazine” in the 50s.\n\nAbove we see Joan Didion in 1976, at her home in Malibu, California, sitting on her living room couch with her daughter Quintana Roo, which she shared with writer John Gregory Dunne. This beautiful living room looks exactly what we would expect Didion’s house to look like – understated elegance and style.\n\nRobert Wagner and Natalie Wood\n\nBelow we see the gorgeous actress Natalie Wood posing at the bar in her home next to her husband, fellow actor Robert Wagner. The photo was taken in 1979, three years after her famous performance in the classic film “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.”\n\nWood made her acting debut when she was four years old and became a known face in Hollywood at age eight, when she co-starred in the 1947 film “Miracle on 34th Street.” She went on to star in classic 50s films, like “Rebel Without a Cause” and “The Searchers,” but perhaps her most famous role was playing Maria in 1961’s “West Side Story.”\n\nDonna Summer\n\nDonna Summer rose to fame in the 1970s after her music earned her the nickname of the “Queen of Disco.” Summer was a natural-born musician, who was influenced by the 60s counterculture and started singing for a rock band called “Crow.” In 1968, she was living in Munich, and she met famous music producer Giorgio Moroder, who went on to record some of Summer’s most famous songs – “I Feel Love” and “Love to Love You, Baby.”\n\nAbove we see the legendary disco queen enjoying a cozy afternoon by her fireplace at her home in Los Angeles, California, in 1976. Summer returned to the U.S. in the summer of this same year and went on to record some of music history’s most famous disco albums to date.\n\nThe Three Degrees\n\nAnyone who lived through the disco era of the 70s will remember the American female vocal trio “The Three Degrees.” Originally formed by singers Fayette Pinkney, Shirley Porter, and Linda Turner, in Philadelphia, in 1963, “The Three Degrees” are still active to this day. Although the group has had a total of 16 different female members over the years, it always remained a trio.\n\nIn 1975, the three singers were Fayette Pinkney, Valerie Holiday, and Sheila Ferguson, who are posing in the photo above. It was January 1st, and so the beautiful singers were posing for a very 70s-style New Year’s photo session, dressed in their very best gowns.\n\nKarl Lagerfeld\n\nFamous German designer Karl Lagerfeld is still being honored for his revolutionary fashion vision to this day. Lagerfeld started designing in the early 1950s, working for top designer labels like Chloe and Balmain. But it was in 1983 that he made the famous move of becoming the creative director for Chanel, where he went on to earn his place as one of the centuries' most revered fashion designers.\n\nAbove we see a young Lagerfeld at his Paris home, in 1976. A perfect black and white photo of a very minimalist living room with beautiful Calla lilies and an impeccably dressed Lagerfeld.\n\nMartha Stewart\n\nNowadays, she is known for being the ultimate cooking guru, and business mogul, and for having an oddly hilarious partnership with rapper Snoop Dogg. But back in the day, Martha Stewart started cooking in her kitchen and sharing DIY tips for housewives across the country.\n\nHere we have the famous Stewart in all her glory, back in 1976, laying out homemade pasta on a wooden board I the beautiful rustic kitchen of her Connecticut house. This photo is absolutely wonderful – a smiling Martha Stewart doing what she loves, a 70s-style stripped apron, the layers of pasta hanging on a rack in the background, and that wooden kitchen that looks straight out of a homestyle magazine.\n\nMiles Davis\n\nIt would be impossible to name the number of music styles and famous musicians that Miles Davis influenced throughout his life. The famous American trumpeter and composer started making music in the early 40s and became one of the most brilliant, acclaimed, and influential jazz and bebop musicians in history.\n\nIn the photo above we see the great Miles Davis holding his trumpet as he lounges in his curvilinear living room, in the summer of 1970. Much like the icon himself, this living room is a work of art – from the mural painting on the wall, and the table sculpture, to the framed art pieces in the background.\n\nPaul and Linda McCartney\n\nIt was the summer of 1974, and Paul McCartney and his wife, photographer, and musician Linda, were enjoying the country life on a farm in Tennessee. The couple spent over a month on the farm playing with their band “Wings” and jamming with other musicians in the area. It was a glorious time.\n\nThis photo shows the happy couple toasting with two cups of tea on their farmhouse porch. Both barefoot enjoying the good weather with their dogs and looking like true 70s hippies. “Wings” was active until 1981, and Paul and Linda enjoyed a happy marriage until Linda’s passing in 1998.\n\nGeorge Bush Sr.\n\nThe Bush family have been political royalty since the 50s – first with Prescott Bush working as a State Senate in 1952, then with his son George H.W. Bush serving as the 41st U.S. President, and lastly with his grandson George W. Bush being appointed the 43 rd President of the United States.\n\nIn the photo above we see a young George H.W. Bush in 1974, as the newly appointed liaison between the United States and China. Bush was enjoying some days off in his summer home, the famous Walker’s Point Estate, in Maine. The estate has become known as the “Bush Compound” since the family has been vacationing there for generations.\n\nFrank Zappa\n\nAmerican musician Frank Zappa is considered one of the most brilliant musicians of his time. His music improvisation and experimental styles created a sound that only he could produce. He was a musical virtuoso who became famous for mocking American culture and had a very successful career as a solo artist after his band, “The Mothers of Invention,” dissolved in 1969.\n\nAbove we see a young Frank Zappa, with his characteristic goatee and mustache, and his beautiful wife Gail sitting on him as they pose for a photo. The picture was taken in 1971, at an apartment in London, U.K.\n\nAndre Previn\n\nThe reputed pianist and composer Andre Previn made his fame by playing classical music and later arranging scores for Hollywood films. He specialized in jazz and classical music and was responsible for the music behind many classic films, including “Valley of the Dolls,” “My Fair Lady,” and “Long Day’s Journey Into Night.”\n\nPrevin also became famous for being actress Mia Farrow’s husband from 1970 to 1979. In the photo above, Previn is photographed with three of his children with Farrow, in 1975. We don’t know if it’s the vintage leather couch, the stunning fireplace, the beautiful Persian rug, or the kids’ adorable outfits, but this has to be one of the cutest and coziest photos we’ve ever seen.\n\nElliott Gould\n\nYounger generations might know him for his role as brilliant thief Reuben Tishkoff, from the “Ocean’s 11” film and its two sequels. However, Elliot Gould started acting way back in the 1960s and played several starring roles in classic Hollywood films. He rose to fame with his portrayal of Ted, in “Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice,” in 1969.\n\nGould is also known for his role in the famous TV show “MASH.” Here is the amazing actor having a cigar in true movie star style, in his living room in the 1970s. We just hope he didn’t ash all over that pristine, leather couch!\n\nBilly Crystal\n\nIn this photo we see a very young Billy Crystal in 1977, admiring his miniature collection at his home in West Hollywood, California. Crystal rose to fame during the 70s and 80s, first with his role in the popular show “Soap,” and then as a regular on the show “Saturday Night Live.” This brilliant actor, comedian, and filmmaker starred in some of the '80s most beloved classics.\n\nThese included “When Harry Met Sally,” “The Princess Bride,” and “Running Scared.” He also dominated the 90s comedy scene, with hit films like “City Slickers,” “Father’s Day,” “Analyze This,” alongside Robert DeNiro, and dozens more.\n\nMarc Bolan\n\nHere is singer, guitarist, and songwriter Marc Bolan winning the 70s style game, posing for a photo in fabulous blue velvet pants, a sparkling purple jacket, and black and white checkered shoes. The photo was taken in 1975, in his apartment in the U.K., and it was a true testament to a time when Bolan pioneered the glam rock movement of the 70s.\n\nBolan rose to fame with his band “T. Rex,” formed in 1967. Bolan became a member of the ‘Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’ in 2020, 43 years after his tragic passing from a fatal car crash.\n\nDesi Arnaz Jr.\n\nOne of the most famous TV couples of all time was Lucille Ball and her husband Desi Arnaz. They dominated the screens back in the 50s and 60s, and their lives, both as individuals and as a married couple, were so extraordinary that they spawned several film and TV shows. Desi and Lucille had a son in 1953, named Desi Jr., who also became an actor and musician.\n\nAbove we see a young Desi Arnaz Jr. playing the drums on his Los Angeles home terrace, back in 1979. That terrace truly looks like a perfect place to play and get artistic inspiration, and regardless, it seems young Desi inherited artist genes from both his parents.\n\nGerald and Betty Ford\n\nIn the very classic black and white photo below we see the 38th President of the United States, Gerald Ford, with wife Betty and son Steven about to say grace before dinner. That beautiful dining room was on the second floor of the White House, where Ford and his family lived from 1974 to 1977. In fact, this photo was taken weeks after Ford was sworn into the presidency.\n\nWe wonder who the fourth plate was for – perhaps they were waiting on one of their other four children. In any case, we can’t imagine what the rest of the house looks like if the dining room alone looks straight out of a magazine.\n\nJohn Cleese\n\nThe irreverent actor and comedian John Cleese is a master of his craft, and he’s been doing it since the early 1960s. Cleese has always been a man of many talents, often doing his own scriptwriting, producing, and acting for his films – including the quirky comedy sitcom from the 70s, “Fawlty Towers.” He rose to fame when he starred in the first “Monty Python” film series, in 1979.\n\nAbove we see the comedian in a very “John Cleese” photo, meaning he is sitting beneath a tree in his garden, wearing a tall Mexican hat, and playing the guitar for an audience that includes his cats and an array of stuffed animals – among them a ferret, a rhino, a mouse, and a turtle.\n\nDavid Cassidy\n\nAmerican actor David Cassidy rose to fame with his role in the popular 70s musical sitcom, “The Partridge Family.” For the rest of the decade, Cassidy became a teen heartthrob and music superstar, and you really just need to look at the photo below to prove it.\n\nCassidy is seen striking a pose in his colorful, laid-back shirt, brown leather pants, and a brown fedora hat, all with a background of his groovy Los Angeles home kitchen. This handsome young man had beauty and talent, and we can definitely see why he became the crush of every teenage girl back in the 70s.\n\nBilly Joel\n\nThe iconic ‘Piano Man,’ Billy Joel poses at his home in New York, in 1978. Of course, we see all of his gold records framed in the background, and Joel looking as smug as he should in his vintage brown jacket and fantastic 70s haircut.\n\nJoel rose to fame with his hit song “Piano Man” in 1973 and went on to write some of the most famous songs of the 70s and 80s. He is considered to be one of the great pianists, singers, and songwriters of his time, a reputation that is well-deserved. The man is in his 70s and he’s still filling up arenas and giving astonishing concerts.\n\nGregg Allman and Cher\n\nBelow is a great photo of “Goddess of Pop” Cher and her husband, Gregg Allman, in the fall of 1977. Allman was a singer and songwriter and one of the members of the famous rock, jazz, and country band, the “Allman Brothers Band.” And of course, you probably know who Cher is.\n\nEverything about this photo screams vintage – even the plaid hammock! Cher and her husband Gregg pose in their hammock while they hang out in their garden at their Beverly Hills, California home. Unfortunately, they divorced four years later, after having a son together, and Gregg got married three more times. Cher never remarried.\n\nTommy Moore\n\nOnly true fans of the Beatles will know this name, but for those who don’t know, Tommy Moore was one of the band’s first drummers. For a short month in 1960, Moore played with The Beatles in local gigs in Liverpool. Below we see Moore, also from Liverpool, photographed at home with his wife and children in 1970.\n\nWe love that his drumsticks were caught in the frame, as well as that hanging guitar in the background. Moore’s true passion was the drums, but he could only be a part-time musician, as the money was hard to come by. He worked as a forklift truck driver during the day.\n\nOlivia Newton-John\n\nFour-time Grammy Award winner Olivia Newton-John had a wildly successful music career that started in the early 70s. She released two chart-topping albums in 1974 and 1975, but it was in 1978, after the release of the hit musical film “Grease” that Newton-John skyrocketed to fame. “Grease” still remains the highest-grossing musical film in history.\n\nAnd its soundtrack is one of the best-selling albums in the world. Above we see a beautiful young Olivia before the chaos of stardom. She shares a moment with her beloved pup in the singer’s rose garden at her home in the U.K., in 1970.\n\nPeter O’Toole\n\nJust by looking at this close-up portrait, it’s easy to understand what made stage and film actor Peter O’Toole so charismatic. O’Toole started his acting career in the mid-50s and went on to star in some of Hollywood’s most classic films during the 60s and 70s. But without a doubt, his most acclaimed role was that of T.E. Lawrence in “Lawrence of Arabia.”\n\nAbove we see an elegant portrait of O’Toole at his home in England, in 1980. This brilliant actor kept at his craft until the end, starring in his last film just a year before his passing in 2013.\n\nDavid Bowie\n\nRegarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, David Bowie heralded a new era of rock with his unique sound. From the moment his self-titled, first studio album came out in 1967, when he was barely 20 years old, Bowie went on to lead an incredible life and career until the moment he passed in 2016.\n\nAbove we see a young ‘Ziggy Stardust’ sitting in his living room at his home in Kent, England. The year was 1971 and it had been little less than a year after releasing his classic album “The Man Who Sold the World.” If only we knew where he got that lamp…\n\nJoan Baez\n\nBeautiful inside and out, folk singer and activist Joan Baez was the face of the 60s counterculture and one of the pioneers of the American ‘roots revival’ movement. In fact, she introduced Bob Dylan, whom she dated, to the world when he was still an unknown singer. Baez also dated Steve Jobs when he was a young man.\n\nAbove we see the one and only Joan in her and her mother’s house in Woodside, California. Baez is painting her nails while enjoying some time in her beautiful dining room with her cat. She’s often said in interviews that this house was her ‘haven’ since it had a garden with a tree house where she would always go to meditate and write.\n\nJames Brolin\n\nHollywood actor James Brolin is the spitting image of his son, Josh Brolin, in this photo of his younger years. Taken in 1970 at his Appytime ranch in California, James enjoys some sun next to his Great Dane. Like his son, James is a brilliant actor with a career that started in the 60s, starring in popular TV shows like “Hotel,” “Marcus Welby, M.D.,” and in classic films like 1973’s “Westworld.”\n\nHe is a two-time Golden Globe winner and also won an Emmy for his role as Ronald Reagan in “Marcus Welby, M.D.” He’s also appeared in “Traffic” and “Catch Me If You Can” and has been married to Barbra Streisand since 1998.\n\nJohn Travolta\n\nBefore playing villains in classics like “Pulp Fiction,” “Face/Off,” and “Swordfish,” the legendary John Travolta made a name for himself in Hollywood by playing Vinnie Barbarino in the popular 70s sitcom, “Welcome Back, Kotter.”\n\nIn the photo above we see a handsome young Travolta sitting on his vintage shag carpet wearing a T-shirt that reads ‘Vinnie Barbarino’ and typical 70s flare pants. The year was 1976, and Travolta was about to skyrocket to fame with “Saturday Night Fever,” “Grease” and “Urban Cowboy.” About to enter his 70s, Travolta is still acting to this day, and the talent remains the same.\n\nPierre Cardin\n\nThe Italian French fashion designer Pierre Cardin revolutionized the fashion industry from the moment he opened his first design house in 1950. Cardin was a particular man, inspired by space travel and fascinated by anything to do with the topic, and so he incorporated it into his designs. Cardin created some of the most avant-garde and unique designs in fashion history, often based on geometry and shapes.\n\nAbove we see the brilliant creative mind at his home in France, in 1972. And of course, just a small glimpse into his home can tell us about the sense of style Cardin had – his silk, patterned robe, his space-inspired white chair, and the art framed in the background are absolute works of art.\n\nBarbra Streisand\n\nThe one and only Barbra Streisand has had perhaps one of the most successful careers in history. Since the 1960s, Streisand has achieved incomparable success as a singer and actor, being one of the few entertainers in the world to have received an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony.\n\nAbove we see the iconic Streisand fixing her makeup in 1970, while she hosts a party for 60s lawyer, activist, and woman’s movement leader, Bella Abzug. The party was thrown by Streisand at her gorgeous New York City townhouse. It’s no secret that apart from being a uniquely talented performer, Streisand was a fierce advocate for human rights, social causes, and the women’s movement.\n\nFred Astaire\n\nIn the photo below, an elegant Fred Astaire poses for a photo in his Beverly Hills, California home living room, in 1979. Astaire is considered by many to have been the “greatest popular-music dancer of all time,” as his iconic films with Ginger Roberts conquered audiences’ hearts. From the 1930s until the 1970s, Astaire wowed the world with his dancing, singing, acting, and choreographies.\n\nA multiple award-winning entertainers, Astaire received a Grammy, two Golden Globes, three Emmys, and an Honorary Academy Award. His classic films, “Swing Time,” “Funny Face,” “Shall We Dance,” and dozens more remain some of Hollywood’s most incredible music films.\n\nAli MacGraw\n\nAmerican actress Ali MacGraw rose to fame after her role in the 1969 film “Goodbye, Columbus,” for which she won a Golden Globe. But without a doubt, her most famous role was that of Jenny Cavilleri, in the 1970s classic, “Love Story.”\n\nAbove we see a photo of young Ali in 1971, sitting in her living room in a fabulous, 70s-style outfit. The photo was taken a year before the actress’s leading role in the famous 1972 action film “The Getaway,” where she co-starred alongside the iconic Steve McQueen, whom she married in 1973. MacGraw went on to have a very successful career with leading roles in movies and TV shows and still makes appearances to this day.\n\nJohnny Hallyday\n\nApart from being incredibly handsome, French musician Johnny Hallyday was a very talented singer that is credited with bringing rock and roll to France. Starting his career in the 1960s, Hallyday had been greatly influenced by Elvis Presley and the rock n’ roll revolution taking place in America in the 50s. His debut song, “Laisse les filled,” was released in 1960 to great acclaim.\n\nAbove we see a young Johnny speaking on the phone in his living room at his beautiful home in Paris, France. The year was 1976, and Hallyday was at the peak of his career, as you can see from his very opulent home.\n\nBob Hope\n\nIn one of the cutest photos on this list, we see famous comedian and actor Bob Hope sharing a nose-to-nose moment with his dog. Taken in 1973, Hope gets ready for an NBC TV special while spending a few minutes in his marigold garden, at his home in Toluca Lake, California.\n\nHope had a stellar career that lasted close to eight decades, appearing in over 70 films and TV shows. The beloved Hope passed away in 2003, at 100 years of age, and left behind a legacy of work that will forever be remembered. There has never been a comedian quite like him.\n\nBob Marley\n\nThe pioneer of reggae Bob Marley started writing and singing his own music in the early 60s and slowly became an icon of freedom and a global symbol of Jamaican culture and music. Below we see the “King of Reggae” hanging out with his friends on the porch of his house in Kingston, Jamaica. At the time the photo was taken, in 1979, Marley was living at 56 Hope Road.\n\nIt was here that he had moved to after leaving his hometown of Nine Mile, Jamaica. Marley’s mixing of reggae, rocksteady, and ska revolutionized music history, and his one-of-a-kind vocals and lyrics were unlike anything anybody had ever seen.\n\nNina Simone\n\nBelow we see the iconic Miss Simone smiling while taking a night off at the penthouse of the Portman Hotel in London, in 1979. Few singers in the history of music could do what jazz and soul singer Nina Simone did – since the early 50s, Simone dedicated every moment to singing, playing the piano, and writing her own music, which people soon realized was a work of art.\n\nSimone fused jazz, soul, R&B, blues, folk, gospel, and pop, and created a new sound of her own. She was also a renowned civil rights activist who endured an incredibly difficult life.\n\nLouis Armstrong\n\nWorld-famous vocalist and trumpeter Louis Armstrong is one of jazz history’s most influential musicians. With a career of over 50 years, that hit all the most important eras in the history of jazz, the New Orleans trumpeter wrote and performed some of the most famous musical masterpieces of the 20th century.\n\nAbove we see a smiling Louis Armstrong holding his iconic trumpet in his New York home. The photo was taken in his den, in July of 1970, the same month Armstrong turned 70 years old. Sadly, almost exactly a year later, Armstrong died of a heart attack in this same home.\n\nJoni Mitchell\n\nThere were many musicians that shaped the 60s counterculture movement and the folk scene in America, but perhaps one of the most influential was Canadian singer-songwriter, Joni Mitchell. This brilliant musician started her career in the early 60s and made some of history’s most beautiful albums, such as “Blue,” “Clouds,” “Ladies of the Canyon,” and dozens more.\n\nAbove we see a lovely photo of Joni in 1970, playing her guitar in her Los Angeles home. This was a year before her seminal album “Blue” came out, and Mitchell was at the height of her music career. Her one-of-a-kind musical arrangements and deeply moving lyrics will forever be one of the greatest things the 60s gave us.\n\nJackson 5\n\nIn this great, very vintage photo from 1972, we see the Jackson brothers playing basketball together in their home in Hollywood Hills, California. Five of the six Jackson brothers became the legendary R&B and soul quintet, “The Jackson 5.” Formed in 1964, they became one of the world’s most popular bands and were managed by their father, Joe Jackson.\n\nIn the photo above we see, from left to right, Michael, Randy, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon Jackson. Even though the group eventually disbanded, it enjoyed nearly two decades of amazing success. Needless to say, Michael Jackson went on to pursue a solo career in 1971 and became one of the most important cultural figures of the entire 20th century.\n\nJane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg\n\nThis gorgeous photo from 1972 shows French musician, singer, actor, and filmmaker Serge Gainsbourg with the astonishingly beautiful singer and actress Jane Birkin. With them are Kate Barry, Jane’s daughter from her first marriage, and newborn Charlotte Gainsbourg, Serge and Jane’s daughter together, who became a famous actress as an adult.\n\nEven though they never married, Serge and Jane were together for over a decade, both as romantic partners and musical collaborators. The beautiful family poses for a loving photo in their home in Paris, on a lovely Sunday afternoon. And can we just say we love Jane and Charlotte’s matching white sweaters?\n\nDon Johnson and Melanie Griffith\n\nBelow, a young and beautiful 18-year-old Melanie Griffith sits next to her boyfriend Don Johnson at the Deauville Film Festival in France, in 1975. A year later, Don would propose to Melanie, and they would have a marriage that lasted one year. They did, however, get remarried in 1989 and lasted seven years, before divorcing and going on to remarry other people.\n\nBut at least they gave us the beautiful and talented actress Dakota Johnson before they split. Melanie achieved mainstream success during the 80s, particularly after her starring role in the 1988 film, “Working Girl.” Don Johnson made his fame by playing James Crockett in 1980s “Miami Vice.” They acted in several 90s films together, including “Paradise” and “Born Yesterday.”\n\nJulio Iglesias\n\nSpanish singer and songwriter Julio Iglesias poses for a beautiful family photo below. The photo was taken in 1974, in the musician’s home in Cadiz, Spain, and next to him, we see his young wife Isabel, his daughter Chabeli, and his son Julio Jose. Many new generations might only know his son, music star Enrique Iglesias, but Julio Iglesias started his career in the mid-60s, reaching the peak of his career during the 70s, 80s, and 90s.\n\nThe songwriter was also a former professional footballer and is still to this date regarded as one of the most successful Spanish singers in the world. Back in the day, Iglesias sold over 100 million records worldwide in 14 different languages.\n\nJeremy Irons and Sinead Cusack\n\nBritish actor Jeremy Irons has had a stellar career, starting out as a theater actor in the late 60s, he got his big television screen break in the 1981 TV series, “Brideshead Revisited.” But it wasn’t until later that year that he landed his first role in a major feature film, alongside Meryl Streep, the classic “The French Lieutenant’s Woman.” Since then, Irons has become one of the world’s most sought-after actors, starring in some of the last decade’s most iconic films, including “The House of the Spirits,” “The Mission,” “Lolita,” and dozens of others.\n\nAbove we see an endearing photo of Irons together with his wife, actress Sinead Cusack, in their beautiful London home garden, while examining a Hydrangea plant. This photo was taken in 1974, four years before the couple got married; they are still together to this day.\n\nTwiggy\n\nBefore Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss, there was Lesley Lawson, aka “Twiggy.” This very unique-looking model, actress, and singer was the face of the ‘swinging sixties’ in London. She became a cultural icon in the U.K., and eventually across the world, as she graced the covers of “Vogue,” “The Tatler,” and dozens of other major publications of the decade. “Twiggy” became known for her signature thin build and her big eyes, long eyelashes, and very short hair.\n\nAbove we see an intimate moment of the model’s life while she loads her belongings into a moving truck, as she gets ready to move houses in the U.K. The photo was taken in 1968, at the height of the model’s career, and apparently, she had a thing for stuffed animals.\n\nJoe Frazier\n\nThe legendary American boxer Joe Frazier was an icon in the sports world from 1965 to 1981. Frazier is considered one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time and has been praised worldwide for his fighting style and technique. He also rose to undisputed fame after becoming the first boxer to ever defeat the great Muhammad Ali.\n\nAbove we see “Smokin’ Joe” working out at his home in Yemassee, South Carolina. From 1970 to 1973, Frazier was the ultimate heavyweight champion of the world, and he already had a gold medal under his belt from the 1964 Summer Olympics.\n\nFrank Sinatra and Barbara Marx\n\nIt was the summer of 1976, and the famous American crooner Frank Sinatra was celebrating his marriage to his fourth wife, model Barbara Marx. We see the newlyweds in the photo below cutting their beautiful four-tiered wedding cake at the home of Walter Annenberg, former US Ambassador. Sinatra had just given Barbara a $100,000 Rolls Royce as a wedding present.\n\nFrank Sinatra was one of the most famous and iconic entertainers of the 50s, 50s, and 60s, and his music is still being heard today. Whether in private homes or as the soundtrack to iconic Hollywood films, Sinatra’s songs live on.\n\nKirk Douglas\n\nThe beloved American actor and director Kirk Douglas got his first film role in “The Strange Love of Martha Ivers,” in 1946, alongside Barbara Stanwyck. Soon after, Douglas went on to star in some of the most iconic films of the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s. His performance in classic dramas, westerns, and war films like “Paths of Glory,” “Spartacus,” “The Bad and the Beautiful,” “Ace in the Hole,” “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,” and dozens of others, made him a leading cinema star worldwide.\n\nIn the photo above we see a 60-year-old Kirk Douglas sitting in his living room at his home in Beverly Hills, California, in 1976. This living room is exactly what we would expect a Hollywood legend’s home to look like – flowered sofas, exotic plants and small sculptures, a geometric-shaped carpet, and beautiful wooden furniture.\n\nJoan Collins\n\nThe beautiful English actress Joan Collins is one of the last surviving stars of Hollywood’s Golden Age. Collins has won several awards for her stellar performances throughout the years, including two Soap Opera Digest Awards, one People’s Choice Award, a Golden Globe, and more.\n\nShe is mostly known for her starring role in classic films like “Land of the Pharaohs,” “Seven Thieves,” and “The Wayward Bus.\" Joan Collins is captured in the photo above in 1972, sitting in her garden at her home in Hampstead Heath, U.K. You can tell just by looking at her that Collins had always had glamour and style.\n\nAl Pacino\n\nOne of the most influential and acclaimed actors of the 20th century needs no introduction. Al Pacino has changed the history of cinema with his performances and roles ever since his debut film in 1969, “Me, Natalie.” In 1972, Al Pacino landed perhaps the most iconic role of his career as Michael Corleone in “The Godfather.”\n\nThe photo above was taken in 1973, only a year after his worldwide success with Coppola’s masterpiece. A young Pacino started growing his beard while getting ready for his next role as a policeman in “Serpico,” and a year after that he would star in “The Godfather II.” Pacino has won an Academy Award, two Emmys, two Tonys, and dozens of other accolades.\n\nLynda Carter\n\nCan we just say this is some of the most amazing wallpaper we’ve ever seen? This groovy bedroom belongs to singer and actress Lynda Carter, who won Miss World USA in 1972. But of course, most people know her as the star of “Wonder Woman,” the hit 70s TV show that ran from 1976 to 1979.\n\nAbove we see a young Lynda in 1979, with her partner at the time enjoying a lazy afternoon at her beautiful home. Lynda has continued acting and still appears on screen to this day, with her most recent performance being in the 2018 sequel, “Super Troopers 2.”\n\nHelen Mirren\n\nA beautiful, young Helen Mirren poses for a photo while in her bedroom at her home in the trendy Fulham neighborhood of London. Taken in 1975, Mirren had already made a name for herself with her roles in 1969’s “Midsummer Night’s Dream,” and “Age of Consent.” Her next films, however, skyrocketed her to fame, including “Caligula,” “Teaching Mrs. Tingle,” “Gosford Park,” “Calendar Girls. \"\n\nNot to mention her award-winning performance in “The Queen,” in her role as Queen Elizabeth II. Mirren has continued to appear in major Hollywood films to this day, including roles in “The Fast and the Furious” saga, “Catherine the Great,” “The Good Liar,” “Red,” and dozens of others.\n\nSuzanne Somers\n\nThe late blonde bombshell actress Suzanne Somers rose to fame after getting cast as Chrissy Snow in the 1977 sitcom “Three’s Company.” But before that, the beautiful Sommers had appeared in several small and guest roles in big films like 1973’s “American Graffiti,” “Magnum Force,\" and “The Six Million Dollar Man.” In the 90s, she was also an A-list celebrity after getting the part of Carol Lambert in the popular show “Step by Step.”\n\nAbove we see a young and gorgeous Sommers in 1979, posing at her home in Marina Del Rey, Los Angeles, California. In her later years, Sommers continued acting and was a successful businesswoman and health spokesperson until her passing in 2023.\n\nSally Field\n\nLong before she played the mom in “Forrest Gump,” or Lincoln’s wife in “Lincoln,” Sally Field had been acting in major shows and movies since the mid-60s. Filed made her acting debut in 1965, in the sitcom “Gidget,” and then rose to fame with her 1967 ABC show, “The Flying Nun,” which ran for three seasons.\n\nBut perhaps some of her most memorable performances were in the 70s and 80s, with her role in “Smokey and the Bandit,” “Norma Rae,” “Heroes,” “Sybil,” “Steel Magnolias,” and others. Above we see a young Sally Field taking some time off in her hotel room in New York, in 1977. Everything from her plaid skirt to her stunning leather, high-heel boots scream 70s style.\n\nSylvester Stallone\n\nSylvester Stallone is one of the most legendary stars Hollywood has ever seen. With a career that started in the early 70s, Stallone made his break in the 1974 film “The Lords of Flatbush,” and two years later, he landed his most famous role to date, that of Rocky Balboa, in 1976.\n\nAbove we have a priceless photo of Sylvester caught going out for a stroll in his underwear near his home in Malibu, California. He was probably practicing lines for “Rocky II,” which came out in 1979, the same year this picture was taken. To this day, Stallone continues to act, lengthening his already wildly impressive career of over six decades.\n\nPriscilla Presley\n\nWhen you marry the “King of Rock n’ Roll,” you’re bound to become a celebrity in your own right. This is what happened when Priscilla married Elvis Presley in 1967, and even though they divorced in 1973, Priscilla continued to be one of the most sought-after celebrities. Below we see Priscilla posing for a photo shoot in her Beverly Hills home in 1975, accompanied by her loyal pet dog.\n\nPriscilla went on to become a successful actress and businesswoman and is the one responsible for turning Graceland into one of the top attractions in the U.S. Judging by her home study, the woman clearly has a lot of styles.\n\nMichael Douglas and Brenda Vaccaro\n\nBefore he got married for the first time to film producer Diandra Luker, award-winning actor Michael Douglas dated actress Brenda Vaccaro in the 60s and 70s. Below we see the couple posing for a photo in their shared home in Beverly Hills California, in 1973.\n\nMichael Douglas reached the peak of his career in the 80s and 90s, starring in classic films like “Wall Street,” “Fatal Attraction,” “Basic Instinct,” “Falling Down,” “Romancing the Stone,” and dozens of others. In 2000, Douglas landed a lead role in the hit film “Traffic,” where he met and started dating his future wife, actress Catherine Zeta-Jones.\n\nBarry Manilow\n\nWith a career of more than seventy years, Barry Manilow has certainly earned his place as one of the most iconic American singer-songwriters. Starting in 1964, Manilow went on to write some of the decade’s most popular songs, like “Mandy,” “Can’t Smile Without You,” “Copacabana,” and “Could It Be Magic.”\n\nThe photo above shows a young Manilow talking on the phone in his New York City home in 1975. Manilow is sitting with his beagle, whom he named Bagel, and who accompanied the singer everywhere he went. Barry Manilow is still recording and performing to this day, well into his 70s.\n\nCarly Simon and James Taylor\n\nThe writer of the famous 1972 song “You’re So Vain,\" Carly Simon was one of the most famous musicians of the 60s, 70s, and 80s. Simon’s soft rock and folk songs were regarded as works of art, with the singer writing and composing all her tunes.\n\nAbove we see Carly Simon with her husband, fellow musician James Taylor, as they pose for a photo session in their New York City home in 1971. Simon became a prominent writer and children’s books author in her later years and still remains one of the most influential folk singers of the 60s and 70s.\n\nIan McKellen\n\nCultural British icon Ian McKellen started his acting career in the late 50s, first as a theater actor and then transitioning to the screen. With an incredible career spanning over 60 years, McKellen has starred in some of cinema history’s most iconic movies, including “Richard III,” the “X-Men” saga, “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy, “The Hobbit,” and hundreds of others.\n\nMcKellen has won six Olivier Awards, one Golden Globe, and one Tony Award, and has been nominated for two Oscars, five BAFTAs, and five Emmys. Taken in the fall of 1969, the photo above shows a young Ian McKellen relaxing in his West London apartment.\n\nPatrick Stewart\n\nThe iconic Patrick Stewart has had a career spanning over 70 years; starting out as a theater actor, his first rise to international stardom came with his role as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in the “Star Trek” franchise. Even though his most famous role came after the late 80s, Stewart had been acting since 1960, in English theaters and Broadway, and even in minor screen roles.\n\nAbove we see a photo of young Patrick Stewart in 1970 alongside a stray dog he adopted and named Crab. They are both enjoying a sunny day at Stewart’s home in Church Cottage, Alveston, Warwickshire, England. His dog went on to become a star in some plays at the Royal Theater in England.\n\nIggy Pop\n\nThe one and only “Godfather of Punk,” Iggy Pop started his incredible music career as the vocalist and songwriter for the iconic band “The Stooges,” formed in 1967. The band broke up and got together several times over the years, but Iggy Pop continued to have a stellar career as a solo artist, singer, songwriter, actor, and radio broadcaster.\n\nAbove we see a very young Iggy Pop sitting on a windowsill in 1976, at Arturo Vega’s apartment in the East Village, New York. Vega was a Mexican-American graphic designer responsible for “The Ramones” legendary logo and almost every single album artwork."
