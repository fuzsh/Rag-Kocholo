        "text": "Released on Valentine’s Day 2024, the movie One Love received mixed reviews from critics. But, on its opening day in the U.S., the film about Bob Marley’s life broke records by earning more than $14 million at the box office. The film follows the making, release and tour of Marley’s ninth studio album produced with his Jamaican reggae band the Wailers.\n\nThe movie’s title was taken from a popular song “One Love” written by Bob Marley and recorded by his group in 1965 for their eponymous debut studio album “The Wailing Wailers.” A reworked version titled “One Love/People Get Ready” was included on the group’s historic 1977 album Exodus and became Marley’s anthem calling for universal love, respect and unity.\n\nTime Magazine later declared Exodus to be “the Best Album of the 20th century” and a masterpiece of spiritual exploration. The revamped medley included Curtis Mayfield’s legendary lyrics about social awareness. Forty years after Marley’s death from a rare form of melanoma skin cancer, the king of reggae is still widely regarded as one of the most influential and iconic musicians of all time.\n\nPrior to his diagnosis of skin cancer...\n\nOn December 3, 1976, just days before a concert was planned in support to help quell local violence, seven armed-men raided Marley’s Kingston residence in a botched assassination attempt. Although there were no fatalities, the politically-progressive musician was shot in the chest and arm while his wife, his manager and a band employee were also injured by gunfire.\n\nSix months after Bob Marley came within inches of losing his life to the politically-motivated gunmen, he was surprised by a doctor’s diagnosis of a rare form of melanoma skin cancer. Unfortunately, a dark lesion under a toenail on his right foot was initially misdiagnosed as a bruise from a soccer injury. Bob Marley died four years later at age 36 from acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM).\n\nHidden Dangers of ALM\n\n“Bob Marley’s premature death should serve as a reminder of the deadly nature of this indiscriminate skin disease,” says Dr. Michael Steppie Orlando Mohs cancer surgeon and medical director of Associates in Dermatology. “While it is true that most melanomas are caused by UV exposure from sunlight or tanning beds, ALM develops on hairless skin like under the nails, on the soles of the feet, or on the palms of your hands.”\n\nAlthough subungual melanoma is rare overall, ALM is the leading cause of melanoma in patients of color. According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, Bob Marley refused the recommended treatment, which would have included the surgical remove of his toe and opted instead to remove the nail bed and cancerous tissue below. Nonetheless, the melanoma metastasized to other areas of his body (brain, liver and lungs) tragically ending the musician’s life much too soon.\n\nHow to Protect Skin of Color\n\nIf you have skin of any color, you can develop skin cancer. Although skin cancers are less prevalent in non-white ethnic groups, it is most often diagnosed at a later stage with a worse prognosis. The overall lack of awareness of skin cancer facts among individuals of color highlights the necessity to have routine full-body skin exams. Moreover, it is important people learn more about their skin type and how to protect it from both obvious and hidden dangers.\n\nIt is not clear as to why skin cancer incidence has grown dramatically in recent years, but any delay in detection in skin of color could be fatal. Here’s some tips on how to spot concerning skin conditions:\n\nSquamous Cell Carcinoma – In skin of color, squamous cell carcinoma is most common in African Americans and Asian Indians. It often develops from a scar or burn and is a rapid-growing. LOOK FOR: a scaly red patch, open sore that can crust or bleed, or an elevated wart-like growth. In people of color, it is often seen in a non-sun-exposed area like lower body parts.\n\nBasal Cell Carcinoma – In skin of color, basal cell carcinoma presents as a black pearly translucent bump or skin growth. It is most common in Hispanics and then Black people of color. Due to pigmentation, it may not be as apparent in dark skin types. LOOK FOR: Basal cell carcinomas are normally linked to UV exposure and seen on sun-exposed areas of skin. On skin of color, 90% of basal cell carcinoma lesions occur on the head or neck.\n\nMelanoma – In skin of color, melanoma is not that common but can be fatal if not discovered and treated early before it is allowed to metastasize. Malignant melanoma begins in the cells that produce skin color (melanin). Due to its difficulty to detect, more African Americans, Asians and Latino people die of melanoma than whites. LOOK FOR: Any new or unusual black or brown spot (or changes to an existing mole) with irregular edges that are notched, ragged or blurred. In people of African descent, it is crucial to routinely check the palms, bottom of the feet, and under or around the nails for acral lentiginous melanoma.\n\nPeople of African, Asian, Latino, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and Native American descent need to understand the subtleties of skin cancer warning signs and what to look for on darker skin tones. Generally speaking, should you notice something new, changing or unusual anywhere on your skin, it’s time to contact a dermatologists. Remember, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma often hide on your extremities, eyes, ears, nose, or scalp.\n\nPrevention Is the Best Approach to Skin Cancer\n\nSkin cancer is indeed color blind. Although people of color are less likely to develop skin cancer, they are much more likely to die from skin cancer. This is primarily due to the delay in detection and treatment that is related to a lack of routine skin checks and annual skin care exams. Moreover, there is a lack of awareness about recommended sun protection strategies among those with skin of darker color.\n\n“While skin cancer is less common in people of color,” says Dr. Steppie, “it is often more dangerous as people with darker skin may not catch it in the early stages when the disease is most treatable. Plus, patients may not recognize cancers on darker skin.” Since skin cancer is often painless, you may not notice it unless you look for it. This means a monthly self-check is an important and potentially life-saving exam for people of any skin tone.\n\nThe most important step for preventing skin cancer is protecting skin from damaging ultraviolet sources of light, including both the sun and tanning beds. If you’re going to be outside or otherwise exposed to sunlight, know your skin type and protect it from damage. Performing monthly self-care skin checks and noticing anything new, changing or unusual on sun-exposed and unexposed areas of your skin can keep you and your loved ones safe.\n\nAssociates in Dermatology provides skin exams, clinical dermatology, and cosmetic procedures designed to meet your skin care needs.
