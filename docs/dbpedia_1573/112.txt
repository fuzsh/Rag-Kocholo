Tomorrow to be Brave – A Memoir of the Only Woman Ever to Serve in the French Foreign Legion by Susan Travers with Wendy Holden

My interest in this book was due to having interviewed Wendy Holden on MeetingtheAuthors.com. I really enjoyed meeting Wendy and getting to know her, so went in search of any books my local library had authored by Wendy. They have several that I’m making my way through. I’ve also requested the library purchase her newest book!

A gripping true story that left me in awe of this courageous woman. An up close and intimate tale of what was endured by those who fought World War II, told through Susan Travers’ eyes about what she experienced.
