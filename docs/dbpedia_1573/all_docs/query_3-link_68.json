        "text": "Ugh, it’s so hard, isn’t it?\n\nYou pour your heart into the page and then you receive repeated “no thank you” emails from editors and agents who clearly must have not missed your beautiful and lyrical words. Is it you? Is your breath bad? Does your manuscript have BO?\n\nIt might be your first page.\n\nAnd we’ve all been there — we’ve all opened a book that seemed boring or lackluster in the opening chapter. Usually the thing that keeps us reading might be the buzz from the literary world or maybe a friend who pressed the book into your hands and said “You’re going to love this, trust me.” But a fresh submission doesn’t have that street team whispering into the agent’s ear. Your first page has to seduce, woo, tantalize and show the reader what the rest of your book is about.\n\nEditors and agents are busy people and they receive submissions in the THOUSANDS. Just simple math shows that they physically have no time to read to the end of each and every one of those hopeful submissions. When I read submissions, I can usually tell by the fourth page that I’m going to keep reading until the end, and if something hasn’t hooked me by the end of page two, it’s unlikely that I’ll keep going.\n\nUnfair? Maybe. Realistic? Definitely.\n\nThere’s got to be something special to keep them on your submission. Not just your hopeful expression and your open heart. If they’re not making it beyond page 1, they’ll never get to your character’s amazing sense of humor nor your compelling plot twist.\n\nThe first page is generally where we start drafting — but sometimes it’s not where your story actually starts, and that’s a problem. Occasionally we start building in back story that’s going to be crucial for the reader to understand for future elements.\n\nConsider the nursery rhyme of Jack and Jill. It’s a pretty simple tale — two people went up a hill to get water (why? We don’t know — they just did), one was terribly injured in a fall (what caused the fall? Dunno. Was it Jack’s fault? Jill’s fault? Dunno) and the other “came tumbling after” (what does that mean — was Jill hurt as well? Was she upset? Was she doing gymnastics? Dunno). One writer might draft this story beginning with Jack and Jill’s relationship — are they married? Are they siblings? Coworkers on the water reclamation project? What’s the story there? Perhaps it makes sense to tell the story of Jack and Jill meeting for the first time? Maybe it’s a meet cute. Another writer might start the story entirely differently. Perhaps we must explain why Jack and Jill’s father asked them to climb up a hill to fetch a pail of water. Perhaps he’s ill and can’t do it himself. Still another writer might choose to begin the story at the bottom of the hill after they’ve fallen, with Jack suffering his traumatic brain injury and Jill looking to stop the bleeding.\n\nWhile all of these stories would be essentially the same tale, the first pages have varying degrees of urgency and conflict. If we start with their father, the reader will assume the father is the main character — that it’s his story. If we start with Jack and Jill meeting for the first time, the reader understands that this is the story of their relationship. If we start with the bloody aftermath of the fall, the story is entirely different and entirely focused on Jill responding to a victim’s emergency while their relationship, the need for water, the hill and everything else will take a backseat.\n\nOne of the most elemental parts of writing is that the first draft exists to for the writer to tell themself the story. All subsequent drafts are for the writer to tell the reader the story. What exists on page one (or more reasonably, pages one through twenty or more) is very likely going to look FAR DIFFERENT in the first draft than the final draft. This is not to say that those first draft first pages are useless — they performed a very necessary task in that they helped the writer find their way to the story they are trying to tell. Much like a brick layer constructs a wooden form to support masonry while the mortar cures, the writer needs those pages for a time until they aren’t needed anymore.\n\nAnd that’s the rub. Identifying what isn’t needed anymore. Because you’ve read and reread your story so many times that it becomes difficult to see that the mortar has firmed up and the wooden supports aren’t necessary. In fact, they’re getting in the way.\n\nYour first page must be directly relevant to the story — the bucket of water is the least interesting thing in the story of Jack and Jill, unless it is the last bucket of water in a village that is dying of thirst, at which point, Jack breaking his crown is actually fairly low stakes in comparison to the greater need. The hill is a physical obstacle — it COULD be an interesting element to the story if that’s the thing that causes the fall. But if the story begins with the day Jill is born and given her name, we have a very different value proposition than Jill trying to carry Jack’s bloody corpse down the hill. Most editors will not make it past page two of the childbirth story.\n\nAdditionally, the first page must have a hint of conflict. If we opened with a four page description of all the people who lived in Jack and Jill’s quaint village, a description of the clock tower and the gazebo and the farmer’s market, our editor is going to give up before they ever turn the page. So what, they’ll think, and they’d be right.\n\nI’m teaching a free workshop on the tricks of writing a winning first page. It’s hosted by the Friends of the Brown County Library’s UntitledTown and it’s open to everyone. We’ll go through first pages from literature as well as real stories I’ve accepted during my tenure as fiction editor at Witness Magazine — and a few examples that don’t work. We’ll also talk about the common first page mistakes that writers of every ability frequently make — and why they’re incredibly difficult to pull off well.\n\nRegister here.\n\nHey, it’s my birthday. Let’s buy presents for readers who need books.\n\nHappy summer! So, it’s my birthday this month. And while I’m struggling to age gracefully, I’ve been thinking a lot about the power of legacy and the marks we make on our communities and this planet.\n\nIf you know me at all, you know how much I value the power of a good story. Stories help us see the people we are destined to become. When I think about the way my personality has been shaped throughout the years, I know much of it was due to my friends Charlotte the spider, two rabbits who lived on Watership Down named Hazel and Fiver, pioneer girls like Caddie Woodlawn and Laura Ingalls, a motorcycle-riding mouse named Ralph, and a British girl named Lucy who hid inside a wardrobe and returned a queen. Stories teach us how to imagine and identify with people who aren’t like us, and they also teach us how to recognize and appreciate and accept our strengths and ourselves.\n\nWhat I’d like most of all is to put a story someone needs most into their hands, so for my birthday, my biggest wish is to give books to people who need them. I’m asking you to send me books that I’ll then place in the Little Free Libraries throughout Northeastern Wisconsin. I’ll target boxes in areas that are far from libraries or in communities where children historically don’t have as much access to their own books.\n\nMy goal is simple — put amazing books in places where kids and young adults can access and read them with no barriers to the books. It’s been a tough 16 months — let’s spread some stories to help everyone feel like they’re not alone. Let’s plant some seeds of empathy, of compassion, of understanding. Let’s fill the summer and their lives with stories.\n\nI’ve curated a list of books appealing to all ages and themes. I’ve prioritized books that look like my community, including BIPOC characters, LGTBQ authors and themes, strong girls and non-traditional or chosen families and non-English language translations. To do the heavy lifting (literally) I’ve partnered with my friends at northeastern Wisconsin’s book store and community gem Lion’s Mouth Books who will hold the books at the store for me to pick up. The link to the list of suggested books is here, but also, feel free to add books you love too. Please notate your order with Wendy’s Nifty 50 Book Drive in your order so the staff knows to hold them.\n\nIf you have your own books, you can also help support my initiative by filling the Little Free Libraries in communities that need diverse books near your home, or you can IM me for an address to send books to, and I’ll do the distribution here in Northeastern Wisconsin. You can even include your wishes of encouragement and donation inside the books you send.\n\nMy goal is to collect 50 books and I need your help. I know this is a big ask and a big exciting initiative. I hope you’ll join me and make something awesome happen this summer and book it to the Little Free Libraries!\n\nI am now more than half way through my PhD.\n\nI also did not pass my first attempt at testing out of the “language reading proficiency” requirement. Half way might be longer than it seems.\n\nIn other news, in 2016, I started a thing, along with a co-founder friend. We asked some other friends to join us, and then asked a few people who weren’t friends yet. It was pretty good. Then in 2017, we did it again. Right after that, I realized that there was no way I could continue to coordinate a book festival for 4000 people when I was a mere 1850 miles away. Something had to go, and it was going to be my sanity if I stayed. So I exited, as did my co-founder. I’d like to think we left that baby in good hands.\n\nThis year, all I have to think about is my school work. Or that was the plan. Then one parent got sick. Then another parent got sick. Then an ankle broken. Then my landlord decided he wanted to sell the house and oh, hey, can you move out in 35 days even though your lease isn’t up until July, k thnx bai.\n\nIn about two weeks, I’m heading to Portland for AWP, where I have a reading on Wednesday with the good people from Zoetic Press, and I am organizing a panel to talk about how my co-founder and I pulled off a major literary festival in less than six months (hint: we had a lot of help), which will be on Thursday at 10:30 am in the Conference Center Level 1. I hope you can make it. I’ll also be at the Witness table, pulling my time as Fiction Editor of that fantastic literary journal, generally on Friday and Saturday morning. I’ll also be at the Witness/ALR co-sponsored reading on Friday night at Paddy’s. I also will be at the Believer party at 4:30 on Thursday although I don’t have specifics for that, so I guess ask around or ask at the Believer table if you want to get in on that action. After that, I’ll be presenting at the Las Vegas Writers Conference in early May (there’s still lots of tickets available and this is going to be a REALLY good time). At that conference I have two sessions: One is how to submit to literary journals on Saturday, and then the other is held twice: once on Friday and again on Saturday called “The Magic Pill for Writer’s Block”. This is an encore for the class I taught at Barrelhouse’s Conversations and Connections in Pittsburgh this fall — it was standing room only, which kind of blew me away, but it looked like we had a lot of people who enjoyed what they produced, so hopefully magic happens in reliable increments!\n\nAll this to say, thank GOD I am not also trying to organize a literary and book festival at the same time! Phew!\n\nI updated the publications page, with new work published at Barrelhouse and Waxwing, as well as a reprint at Evansville Review. I also instituted an Events thing so you can track my movements, much like a tagged shark in the clear waters off the coast of Baja. Only not as streamlined or as interested in eating seals, but otherwise just like that.\n\nI spent my summer vacation with a bunch of really amazing people named Evee the Pokemon and Super Fantastic Bubble Plastic and Scrounge and Lady Lazuli in the Hudson Valley region of New York. We ate a lot of hippy food, drew until our hands hurt and then laughed and read aloud and laughed some more and then took a nap. It was a good time.\n\nI was there because Dan Chaon and Lynda Barry let me come along and be their classroom assistant. Or, as Lynda called us, a classroom pixie. Basically it’s the best part of teaching — picking up class work and making dozens upon dozens of tape circles and then whispering about how much we were craving beef, because at this camp, there was no beef. As it turned out, that’s actually totally livable — although I did miss coffee an awful lot until I found out that they sold decent coffee in the cafe, and then, well, dear reader, I could have lived there forever, in my 10×12 little private room with zero air conditioning and wifi that really was more of a whisperfi and the groundhog who lived under the front porch whom I named Mister Tubbins. Writer camp was the best. This was so so so a million times better than the last time I went to Writer Camp. And kind of silly that Lynda and I live in the same state and end up going to these other states to be writer camping. Or glamping, as the case was at Writer Camp. Again, best vacation ever.\n\nAs with all things, if Lynda Barry asks you to do her a favor, you do it. Whatever it is. Give me a kidney? Sure, Lynda Barry, here’s a kidney. You want a matched set? I’ll be over here in this tub of ice, happy as can be.\n\nWhile there, I was alerted to the acceptance of the short story that I wrote the last time I was in Dan’s workshop — and the story I workshopped the time before that just found a home in Zoetic Press’ Non-Binary review — so clearly I need to hook my wagon to the Chaon/Barry party and be content to follow wherever they may lead because it’s working for me.\n\nWork continues on the novel. Still. The same novel. Okay, I wrote two other ones right now too, but I need to get this asshole out the door already. It has overstayed its welcome. Out the door, you! Unfortunately, I’m in the weeds of the final quarter, basically rewriting the entire shit and works. Which I should just do rather than continuing to putz with the first half until it is just so. It will never be just so. This is the problem with writing on computers, Lynda Barry says. This is why you write by hand. Using ink. For real. A Flair pen is where it’s at, according to Lynda Barry. She is wise.\n\nAnd now school has started up again — I’m teaching, again, even though I swore that I’d spend fall working on my novel and my terribly busy day job that continues to consume my every waking thought but keeps a roof over our head and allows me to say “Fuck it all” and buy a fifth row seat for Hamilton while in New York. Because who needs to make rent? Not this kid. (I’m joking. We don’t rent.) However, it sounds very much like the company I work at for my day job is currently in the end stages of life, the musicians pulling up deck chairs to play while the boat sinks. My plan: Like Leo and Kate, I’m going to stay on this boat for as long as I can. And also teach this fall because if I end up not having a job all fall, I’m going to be mad, plus it’s my favorite class to teach. And also, maybe sign up to take the GRE to finish my PhD. Or just finish the damn novel and get it published because really. Really.\n\nI finally put a publications page up — it was about 85% complete when I got frustrated with the formatting and just hit publish. This is why Lynda Barry is right — I should really just use a Flair pen.\n\nBut then I couldn’t talk to you, fair reader. Hello. Are you there? I enjoy you, just as you are.\n\nI have a funny little OCD problem: I can’t concentrate if resources are being wasted. For instance, if the light is left on in the bathroom, I’m incensed. I will think of nothing else until I can turn it off. Similarly, the dishwasher can drive me to distraction. We live in an old house, the kind with a kitchen that can fit on the head of a pin, and as such, our dishwasher is the kind that you roll over to the sink and hook up through a long hose and an elaborate series of janky blocades that we then install so that the leaky faucet won’t cause water to flow Niagara-style down onto our hardwood floors. Once you hook it up, you physically turn on the water full blast on hot, where it then stays “on” until someone turns it off. In theory, there’s some kind of mechanism inside the dishwasher that stops the water from flowing freely, except that doesn’t stop the water from dripping at the hose/faucet connection NOR does it stop the water from flowing, Victoria Falls-style from the point at which the faucet connects to the sink. Yes, there are more problems at play here than our microscopic kitchen, but basically it just means that the dishwasher must be babysat like an incontinent bulldog and the instant that the dishwasher moves from the rinse cycle into the heated dry cycle, the faucet must be turned off, lest all havoc ensue.\n\nMy entire life, I suspect, is spent in avoidance of ensuing havoc. I firmly believe that havoc is waiting for all of us, just around the next corner.\n\nAnd yet, with all of my attention to the wasted utilities, I think nothing of days and weeks and months passing by, with my little creative projects languishing. I have a friend named Jen Larsen who published a real book last month. A real and honest book! I am possibly mentioned in that book. In fact, this friend of mine was in shit-you-not People Magazine, along with a photograph that was taken by yours truly (but not credited, thus alas I am not ultra-famous by association, my backwards name was not pressed up against Jennifer Aniston on the very next page). It is a very very good book. You should go buy three copies at the very least (you need one for yourself and two to pass along to friends who you absolutely will realize must read that book.) In fact, buy it from your independent bookstore and if they don’t have it on the shelves, ask them why the hell not and explain that you want to buy at least three copies and you intend to tell your neighbors to do the very same immediately.\n\nIt’s a little intimidating having fancy writer friends, who do things like write books, who actually know how to write books without crying in a closet.\n\nI had a bit of a meltdown, dear reader, I confess. It happened a few months ago. I declared to the dear boy that I wasn’t meant to be a writer, not the fancy kind of writer anyway, and that maybe being a tech journalist was Good Enough. It certainly pays better than being a fancy writer, so why do I get all of these inflated ideas about being a fancy fiction writer anyway? Maybe I’d just learn to play golf better instead. And he took me by the shoulders and said “Cut it out.” And then I said I would cut it out, and at some point, I started cutting it out and finished the first draft of my novel.\n\nThen I took a month off from thinking about it, took a short story workshop with the awesome guys at Barrelhouse (which you should also do, immediately. Look, you come here to read a blog post for free, you’re going to get a few homework assignments. I think that’s a fair trade) and then Christmas and New Year’s happened and then I went on the world’s longest press junket and then I sat back down, opened up my novel and thought “Well, fuck.”\n\nIt turns out that the second verse is very much not like the first. Second drafting? That’s apparently where the hard work happens. Man, I conveniently forget about that all the time. Thus, this is what I’m working on now. I realized that my life is too busy for novelizing. I realized that when things get in the way, I tend to push my creative work aside and let the rest of it wash over me. Something drastic was called for.\n\nSo I took a drastic step: I evaluated everything that was Not Writing time and decided what was essential and what wasn’t. I stepped out of all but the most crucial social engagements. I chose to quit a writer’s group that would have required attention to one short story a week. I stopped doing pottery. That one hurt the most, actually. I really enjoy doing pottery, even though it’s such a predictable middle-aged woman thing to do. It takes a lot of time, though: It eats up at least one night a week and most of the time, an entire Saturday. Two entire chunks of personal time that weren’t being spent maintaining crucial relationships, keeping my clothes clean or any other of the crucial time sucks that writers fight with on a daily basis.\n\nThe first 8000 words of my novel went out to three trusted readers for a sanity check/organizational questions first read. They gave feedback (well, two of them did) and now I’m onto the second draft. If you don’t hear from me for awhile, that’s where I am. Drafting like a motherfucker.\n\nUntil then, my short story “Where She Went” is now live at the fantastic Per Contra for your reading enjoyment.\n\nThis summer, I have been awash in the fiction world. At least, as awash as I ever get, which is probably a bit more like a Wet Nap dabbed lightly over my brow.\n\nIn June, I attended Writer Camp in Indiana once more. Last year’s was so magical that I couldn’t resist applying, especially when Lynda Barry and Dan Chaon were up for return appearances. Also, Jean Thompson! Whose writing is near and dear to my heart and whose sharp prose I admire immensely. It was touch and go, however, with scheduling because the small conference had the annoying reality of scheduling Lynda Barry’s workshop at the same time as Jean Thompson’s workshop. I mean, I’ve worked with Lynda Barry before and she is amazing and seriously, up there next to Mr. Rogers in my sacred shrine of human deities, but Jean Thompson? How could anyone decide between these two fantastic writers? Unpossible!\n\nI made a rash decision when I applied, deciding that it would be foolish to forsake a new experience just to bask in the magic that is Lynda Barry once more. It’s a bit like feasting in front of starving people, after all, to soak up all the Lynda Barry awesome for myself and leaving none for others. I put the X in the box for Jean Thompson’s workshop, with Lynda Barry’s workshop as my second choice, and then put no further thought into the matter. I think perhaps I was hoping they would change the conference schedule to fit my mental anguish and offer the Barry workshop during a more convenient time. For me, of course.\n\nThey didn’t. And while it was painful to see those people hunched over their spirals in Lynda’s workshop (including Mr. Chaon himself) while I passed by and turned into our cramped little conference room, I do not regret this decision.\n\nI do, however, regret that there was a time slot of the Writer Camp agenda given soley to the purpose of crafting journals. Not writing journals, dear reader, making them. With glue. By folding papers. I mean, I know I jokingly call it Writer Camp but arts and crafts? Really? With all due respect to the organizers and the leader of that class, it was heartbreaking that journal making had the luxury of a time period all to itself while Lynda Barry and Jean Thompson were fighting it out, gladiator-style, on the agenda. And I’m sure that there was some grand master plan of evil genius (because again, I am greedy and I recognize this), but still. Gluing stuff. I fled that class in the middle of the first meeting, I’m afraid. While I found it interesting on a Martha Stewart level, I had taken an entire week’s vacation from my day job to focus on writing fiction and I decided not to spend precious minutes of that time gluing shit to cardboard.\n\nIn the Thompson workshop, my story (“Where She Went”) was the first on deck for Day One. I got fantastic feedback from Jean and helpful comments from the class, specifically from a few individuals who turned out to have enjoyable treats for workshop themselves. It’s so funny how that always happens, but I guess it makes sense.\n\nAs things always happen, I had submitted the story to a few places when I was getting it cleaned up to send with my application for Thompson’s workshop. And last week, that older version of the story was chosen by the fantastic Per Contra. I have since sent them the tweaked post-Thompson version, which I think is tighter and more agreeable.\n\nWhich reminds me: I need to update my BASS database, as well as run some new numbers on the Top BASS Markets and whatnot. I just got the new BASS last week (Shout out to the rock star Roxane Gay! Can’t wait to read your story! Congratulations on hitting the big show!) That will be forthcoming, although admittedly it’s on the backseat until I come to a procrastination point in the novels that I’m working on. I’m also cleaning up my published and unpublished short stories for publication in a collection, sort of a one-two punch with the novel. And it’s already the end of July, which is distressing, as I’d like to have everything set by the end of the year. Oh plans, plans, they are such attractive things.\n\nWhich reminds me (part two): the enchanting Paper Darts (see my AWP blog post) has selected my first ever flash fiction story “Lower Midnight”. I was able to read about a paragraph and a half during one of the many Writer Camp readings and gave a plug for Paper Darts to the conference attendees, sight unseen, but seeing it published is even better than I expected. I am in love with the illustrations. Gorgeous work. I bow at the feet of the illusionists behind Paper Darts and moan “I’m not worthy!” and then scuttle off to the corner to stroke the curly smoke pictures when no one is looking."
