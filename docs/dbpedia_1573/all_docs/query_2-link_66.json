There is so much more to it. Nobody truly knew the depths of Wendy’s reality so we hope that what our cameras captured can help shine a light on what she is facing now.”\n\nWilliams, her son Kevin Hunter Jr. and manager Will Selby are all listed as executive producers for the upcoming two-part documentary.\n\nOn Feb. 22, three days before the documentary premiered, Williams’ court-appointed guardian filed a sealed lawsuit against A&E Television Networks, Lifetime’s parent company.\n\nIn a statement given to TODAY, the network confirmed the documentary would air as planned.\n\nRead on for everything to know about Williams' upcoming documentary\n\nHow to watch Wendy Williams' new documentary 'Where is Wendy Williams?'\n\n\"Where is Wendy Williams?\" will air on Lifetime over two nights.\n\nThe first part will debut on Lifetime on Saturday, Feb. 24, at 8 p.m. ET.
