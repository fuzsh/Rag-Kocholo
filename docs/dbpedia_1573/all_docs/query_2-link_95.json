        "text": "A quick note before tomorrow’s Vitamin K session\n\nAbout Bear, and about what he is to me on the journeys. I’ve described him as my dire wolf, my guide and my companion. He plays all of those roles.\n\nBut wait, there’s more (the direct marketer in me apparently never quits.)\n\nHe reminds me of Aslan the lion from the Chronicles of Narnia. A few notes about that:\n\nI never saw the movie (or movies, are there multiple?)\n\nI devoured the books as a kid, reading them the way I read most books I loved — over and over, till much of the text was memorized (I did the same thing with just about every modern American and British play, plus Brave New World and 1984 — I have a soft spot for dystopian literature. Go ahead — AMA.)\n\nI didn’t know — until college — that CS Lewis, author of Narnia was a devout Christian and that the whole series was meant as Christian allegory. It kind of blew me away when I learned that. I literally had no idea but I enjoyed them as fantasy. Exquisitely written and deeply textured fantasy. That’s still how I see the books.\n\nAnd there are a few Aslan quotes that stand out; two apply to Bear and his role in my journeys, the others are just great.\n\n1. “You would not have called to me unless I had been calling to you.*” — Aslan/Bear\n\n2. “All get what they want; they do not always like it.” — Aslan**\n\n3. “Courage, dear heart.” — Aslan/Bear***\n\n4. “You doubt your value. Don’t run from who you are.” — Aslan****\n\nSo I go into tomorrow’s session with Bear, who I know will be with me. Right now my dire wolf/Aslan has his head in a cardboard box (his favorite toy) but as soon as he’s done I’ll work on getting him focused for tomorrow. And after we clean up the detritus from his activities, that’ll take a moment.\n\nMore to come — the post about my writing process is, well, written. Needs a sprinkling of sea salt and then it should be ready to publish.\n\n*yes, there’s reciprocity involved\n\n**two references here, the obvious Stones lyric about you can’t always get what you want, and the Peleton instruction that divides what you want from what you need\n\n***nod to Baudelaire\n\n***as we say on social media: Truth\n\nThanks for reading Concussed CMO!
