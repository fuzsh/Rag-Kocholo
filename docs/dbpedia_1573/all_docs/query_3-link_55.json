        "text": "A writing community is very important to have, especially if you’re starting as a self-publishing author. You need to find a tribe that thinks like you. Join Ella Barnard as she talks to historical romance author, Wendy Vella about finding a community. Wendy is a Kindle Unlimited all-star and is also part of the SPA Girls Podcast. Learn how she found her community in the SPA Girls and in her family. Find out why historical romance of all things and why her book covers look so beautiful. Discover all that and more in today’s episode of the Author Like a Boss podcast.\n\n—\n\nListen to the podcast here\n\nFinding Your Community As A Self-Publishing Author With Wendy Vella\n\nWe are here with the lovely and beautiful Wendy Vella. She is a Kindle Unlimited All-Star and USA Today bestselling author of historical romances. She is known for compelling and uplifting stories laced with witty humor, sensuality, and intrigue. Wendy has hit the bestseller ranks many times with reader favorites, The Sinclair & Raven series, The Deville Brothers, and The Langley Sisters series. She also writes small-town, contemporary romances under the name Lani Blake.\n\n—\n\nWendy, thank you for coming to this show.\n\nThank you for having me.\n\nWhat she did not have in her bio is that she is also one of the beautiful SPA Girls. If you have not checked out the SPA Girls Podcast and want to hang out and listen to some lovely accents, fun times, and good advice, check out the podcast or YouTube. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your author journey?\n\nI have been reading romance for years. I am a huge romantic, always have been. I started reading stories very young. I love stories that touch me emotionally. That is huge for me. I moved from Julia Quinn straight into historical things like Georgette Heyer. I also started reading Nelson Burns because my mom was reading them, and she would throw them at me. I have always loved reading. I then started to write in my late teens. I always dabbled as a kid but I did not start romance until my late teens. I pinned my first novel, which is horrific, full of angst, and very bad.\n\nI then joined RWNZ when my kids were young, which is Romance Writers of New Zealand. When I joined that, I found my community. There were all these people that were talking about romance and things to do with romance so I started writing. I got some books written, got into some competitions, and did quite well. After that, I thought, “Maybe I can get something published.” I then pitched it to an editor. She accepted. I was published with Random House through the Loveswept and Flirt. I then got an agent, and they did not want any more books.\n\nEvery time I pitched them one, they did not like the concept. I was getting more and more disheartened because I was already paying my crews that I was going to take and all these things with all the proceeds that did not happen. I then got together with my friends who are the SPA Girls, believe it or not. They said to me, “Come on. Let’s self-publish.” I started the self-publishing journey and the learning journey. That is where it all started. I published traditionally and my first self-publish was in 2013, and then I started writing full-time in 2014. It was a quick journey. I was lucky that the first book went well.\n\nI was talking with somebody about starting writing. You have been writing for a long time, but you did not start making money with it for a while because you are like, “I grew up and then did Georgette Heyer.” I have read some, but I had to go back and read them because it was a little bit before my time.\n\nI come from an English family. I loved everything to do with Georgette Heyer because it was something growing up with the buildings and life. Previous to when I was published, I was someone who did not do anything unless I knew it was good enough. For me, it was almost an apprenticeship learning to write.\n\nWhen it comes to modern traditional romance, characters are everything and the rest follows.\n\nWhat I did was I entered these competitions to get validation. When I started winning the competitions, I was like, “I am there. I am ready.” That is what it took.\n\nAfter that, you are like, “I got it.” What type of books do you write for everybody who is reading?\n\nI write historical romances mainly in the Regency era. Sometimes a little bit lighter series. I write family. I am very big family-orientated because I am a family person. There are a lot of family books. All of my books have suspense in them. I have one series, which is my best-selling one, which has got a slight paranormal historical tinge to it. I also write as Lani Blake. She does the small town in the US, contemporary romance. It is also family.\n\nI was glancing at your website before we hopped. The book covers are gorgeous. It is beautiful. I do not love all historical romance book covers. It is hard sometimes to make historical romance book covers look modern. They do not look modern because they are all wearing period outfits and stuff. Yours have that beautiful line like they are on-brand. They are period wearing these pretty outfit but still look modern. They are beautiful.\n\nThat is color to a degree, to be honest with you. There is that fine line between being a traditional historical writer and someone who writes historical romance set in that era who writes modern flow to it. I am in the latter. I make sure that if I am writing about something that happens within that time, it is factually correct, but I use a lot of liberty and license around everything else.\n\nI wanted my colors to reflect that. I went for quite bold colors, which was not necessarily what the dresses were like in those days, but I am working with the same cover designer from the start. She creates designs. She was amazing. I have an issue with models so I always make sure that I choose my models. I sit with the models, and she chooses the rest.\n\nYou are interactive in this process. Me too. I have a friend who is like, “You are very picky with the covers.” I am like, “I am. I want them to look the way I want them to.” Not everybody is like that. I have some questions. Some of these are my own personal curiosities. I love reading historical romance. I have follow-up questions about Regency and things.\n\nI have read Julia Quinn and Lisa Kleypas. I own all of her books, but I do not know how to pronounce it and they are some of my favorites. I have always wondered about it as a writer, but now I wonder more because I am a writer myself. How do you do that line with the modern plus the historical facts when you are writing? Tell us a little more about that.\n\nI am a massive series writer. The characters are the case. For me, characters are everything. I need to have the character, what they are, and how they work. I need to have their name and that thing, and then the rest follows. It is almost modern set in a historical time. My books are all my belief. I do not have anything that is factually accurate with regards to streets, buildings, events, and stuff like that. They are things I have made up. I bring an element of fun and games to events that may not have happened within that time.\n\nWithin the boundaries of that time, I can have them. I like to push outside the square a little bit. I have had the same editor for years, and she will come back. She will say, “That is not going to work. We are not having that.” I am like, “Why? I love it.” She said, “That is too modern.” There is a fine line, especially when you write both to adjust to both. She will come back to me quite often and say, “You can’t have that in there because that is historical. You can’t have that in there. That is contemporary.” For me, it is about the setting and the fun. It is about evoking the passion and the excitement within the book. That is how I write. I like to write what I like to read. Julia Quinn, Eloisa James, and Lisa Kleypas are all people who I like and would love to write next to them.\n\nBridgerton came out in 2021. The second one just came, and this will air in the future. It is timely to talk about the modern and the Regency. I love how they have combined the modern and the Regency in the series. It sounds like that is something that, maybe not in the same way, you have been doing for a while. Has it impacted at all?\n\nI love Bridgerton. There are a lot of people that do not, and there are a lot of people that do because it has crossed over the line. The thing is, when you go into watching Bridgerton, you have to understand that it is nothing like the book. You have to treat them as two separate things completely. I love both of them. I love the books. The books were the first I read, and I read them every year. What she is done with the actual Bridgerton Netflix series has been amazing.\n\nI love the modernizing of it and the way she is brought it in. I do not have a problem with it because still parts of it are very true to that time, like the buildings, the way they are dressed, and the characters. I love all of it. I try to do that with my books. I try to push out the square a little bit. I do a lot of research and make sure that whatever I am doing is going to fit in that mold. Who is to say it did not happen? No one is alive from back then, so we have got quite a license for that.\n\nI agree. If you have whatever disclaimer at the beginning, you play with it. If you and your readers like it, who was it hurting? I have not read the series every year, but I have my favorites. I am like, “What are they going to do with Francesca?” The thing I love about that series, and that sounds like what you are doing, is a family. With the success of that show, have you seen any impact on yourself?\n\nThere is more interest than it was the last time. There was an uptick, and a lot of people were changing their covers to look more similar to the Bridgerton cover because she is changed all covers. There was a bigger interest in historical romance after that. I had some friends who never read historical romance, but once that started, they were right into it like, “I watched this. I am reading the book now.” The history of that is very different.\n\nWe might be at the beginning of the surge. I remember when I was younger. There was a native American romance period when now, I am a little bit embarrassed to say. To be fair, I was fifteen. I read a lot of things like pirates and then Regency, and you have these waves. I maybe read the beginning of a new wave of interest. It might not be everybody is clicking now, but an awareness of, “There are these books that are out there.”\n\nThanks to Bridgerton, there’s a much bigger audience for historical romance.\n\nI do not think it can hurt us. It can only enhance bringing that awareness to historical romance fiction.\n\nI also want to talk about one of the things that you mentioned about finding the writing community. I am shifting slightly on topics. After having interviewed a lot of authors, one of the key things that people mentioned that comes up over and over is the writing community. That does not happen to be one of the things that typically when an author, or who is trying to be an author, looks at courses, how-to videos, and stuff like this, they are ads, blurbs, covers, or all these concrete things that are good and important.\n\nOne thing that comes up with every successful author that I have talked to is community. That is a key part of it. When you think about it, everybody at the back of their books, nobody is saying, “I thank myself. I did it all by myself.” They have a community. Even though, in our minds, we think of it as a solitary thing. You have said you started with the Romance Writers of New Zealand, and then now you have your SPA Girls. What are some of the things that you do that are beneficial and concrete?\n\nWriting is so solitary. I spent a lot of time on my own. You can also become very insular as a writer. I do not think that is always a good thing. When you first start, this is a game that there is a lot of learning. For me, it was about going to the people that I respected and knew would give me good advice. When I met with the SPA Girls, we were not SPA Girls. We are just getting together as a critique group. We were all pretty much at the same stage of our writing journey. The thing is finding a community of people that all offer something. The four of us, from the start, offered something different.\n\nA couple of them were good at learning. Some of us are good at writing. For me, it was a real knowledge bank being a part of this and that gave me the courage. I had come from a job where I was working in real estate. I had written a few books, but it was only a hobby. I knew nothing about this game, and this game is one of those that no one tells you about. If you are going to be a doctor, you know a million doctors that are going to be doctors. If you are going to be an accountant, you will know someone who is going to be an accountant, but how many writers do we know outside of our writing sphere?\n\nIt was important that I had this group to help me grow, learn, and understand going through the same process and what we needed to do. My tribes are vital to me. There was probably not a day goes by where I do not text and message them on our lope and go, “I am struggling with this. How is this working out?” That was huge for me starting out. I also talk about the plot with them occasionally. They will tell me if they think I am doing something wrong or right. I will send covers to them.\n\nI liked people, but I can be very insular, so this was a way for me to incorporate both my writing and have friends. A tribe is huge and we always say that. Even if it is one person, find that person you trust because there are so many people out there willing to offer advice and information. Find people that you get and get you. If you can hit it off, get it right. It is massive.\n\nYou are saying that we both have our own podcasts. Find somebody you trust, us. We mean it. It is the truth. I now co-write primarily, and it is a close relationship. I love being able to have somebody even when we are not writing. It is hard to say. I could not do it by myself. I do not even want to because I have done it now with somebody else, even if we were not co-writing. We were writing friends or individually. I do not want to do it by myself.\n\nWe can get together and set even on Zoom and write together. We will spend a few hours together in silence, writing. I love it. It is important to me. Did you meet them through the Romance Writers of New Zealand?I did.\n\nI have talked to other authors here in the US. There are chapters, meetups, and places you can find people. Finding people with similar intentions and goals are also important. That can be harder to find because you have a lot of writers who are interested in writing, but not necessarily interested in finishing their book or self-publishing.\n\nIt has got to be beneficial in positive and the interaction. You do not want someone to be banging or putting you down. It has got to be a mutual interaction and that you are benefiting everyone involved.\n\nI went, looked, and saw that you have audiobooks. I have not talked with enough people about audiobooks because I have not done them yet. It is on my bucket list that I wanted to, but it is a big project, and I have not had time for them. There is so much to do, and it has not made it to the top of my to-do list yet. I want to know more and you have a few. Can we talk about what benefits you have seen from having audiobooks and then go a little deeper?\n\nI only listen to audiobooks at the moment because I am too busy. If I am driving, exercising, or whatever, that is my reading time. I do not get a lot of time to read, so that was the first thing. The second thing was only 6% in the US use audio at the moment, but it is growing. If you think of the US, 6% is a lot of people. For me, I just wanted the books. It is about the product. I can’t keep tuning out and tuning in. There comes a time when you have to take that product and grow it. What else can I do with that product to send it out there in more ways?\n\nI have had three contemporaries out for a while now. With the historicals, I wanted to go down another route. I did not go through and find a way for the reason I found myself for the Sinclair & Raven series. Alex has been great. I have done the first three, and they have gone well. As I say, it is about making that product from 1 into 3, or 2, more income streams, things like that.\n\nIt is slow growth. Like anything in this business, if you are in it for the quick bucks, it is possibly not going to happen. For me, it was getting things out there and seeing how they went. So far, so good. They are doing well. The process for me was finding the narrator, and then I would load separately to Kobo and find a way because we are in New Zealand. We can’t do anything with ACX and things like that.\n\nThat is okay. I think they have some of their terms. You might not want to go with ACX but you might if you want to. No shame. Sometimes, it is just getting it done. I keep on saying, “I am going to do it at some point.” They have seven years or something where they did last time I looked. Getting it done might be worth it to do it because I am in year 2 or 3, and I still have not done it.\n\nWriting is a game no one tells you about. So find a community that can help you understand, navigate, and learn the game.\n\nI started writing full-time in 2014, and I have only last couple of years started looking at going further. There are plenty of things you can do without audio, like getting your books into print, Kindle, and eBooks. There are so many different options with it before you go down that route.\n\nI like the idea of audiobooks because I know a lot of people who only consume books through audio. That is the way they read because you can do it while you are doing the dishes, driving, or at the grocery store. You do not want to miss out on your reading your spicy books just because you have to do laundry.\n\nThere is something about hearing your book come back in life. That is pretty special too.\n\nI want to ask about that. You went to find your narrator. How did you find your narrator? Did you listen to your favorite books?\n\nI have had my assistant start doing some serious research on voices. She went in, narrowed it down, and sent me a few. She said, “What about this?” I then went and listened to them. The narrator is everything. Some people love women. Some people love men. Some people love both. I love both, but it is very costly having both. This guy has got the best English accent. I was like, “What do you do?“\n\nWhere do you even look for narrators? I have no idea.\n\nIt is a Findaway Voices. It has a whole list. You decide on what you are after. You give them a sample, and they will send you voices. That is what I did. Last time, I picked an amazing narrator. This time, I went to BeeAudio. They represent Alex and I went through that way. Quite often, with a narrator, you can go into Amazon or wherever you read. Put in their name and all their books will come up. That is a handy way of doing it.\n\nYou are like, “How do they sound?” “It is good.” It is like, “I do not want to listen to this while grocery shopping. Maybe not in public, but while I am doing laundry, yes.” You then send them your text?\n\nThey send you the files. They will do a sample. You pick a sample you want in the book. I went for the first chapter. After the chapter title, then you do some research on the pricing. There is a sliding scale of where you should price for how many hours. I then went into Findaway and loaded each of the files. They will come in a separate file, and you drag them in. I published separately with Kobo and did the same. It is a lot easier than you think.\n\nThat is what I am understanding as you were talking. In my mind, it is a ginormous project, and it does not sound as ginormous as I thought.\n\nDo you know what takes time? It is how long it takes them to load to the platforms. It can take a month. People say, “Why do not you put a pre-order up?” I would not do that because of the timing. I put three books up at once, and books 1 and 3 got published, but book 2 did not. Amazon took quite a while. That seems to be the slowest path.\n\nHow long did it take or have you yet gotten your investment back?\n\nThey have only just been fully published. It will be a little while. I will check back on that. You also need to change the cover dimensions too. That is another thing.\n\nYou have to reach back out to your artists and be like, “Can you make this a square? It was not that hard.”\n\nUntil you try, you do not know. I am in the process of trying a German translation. That was a lot of research, but if you are not doing it yourself. It is fine. Someone has to do it.\n\nYou did mention you have an assistant.\n\nFind an assistant that can see your books in a different light, whereas you’re looking at it as the author.\n\nI have got a couple. I run some marketing. The other one is my business manager. They are my daughter and my daughter-in-law. My daughter is a Financing degree, and my daughter-in-law is a Marketing degree. It was very handy. All of us are home with the kids as well, so it worked well. I did it all myself up until the beginning of 2021. I had an assistant for a long time, and she was amazing. She was moving on, and I decided to find someone else. I found an assistant or someone who is outside the genre for them, and these two young girls have a different perspective on what I have always known.\n\nThey came in new and said, “How about we try this? How about we try that?” I was like, “I do not know about that.” That is what worked for me. They can see things in a bright, shiny different light, whereas I am looking at it as the author, this is my product, and this is the way it has always been done. Marketing and other ways of doing things have been good and beneficial.\n\nWhat kind of things do they do for you? Marketing is so broad, especially here. It could be the topics you are writing about, the titles you pick, and Facebook ads. What things do they help you with?\n\nMy daughter runs the finances. She books all my edits. I have got a couple of editors at the process the book goes through. She keeps me on track. Because I am a creative brain, staying on track for me is not easy. Writing is my main focus, and they allow me to do that. She does all of that side of things, books, all the edits, and follows up on things. She does the Amazon ads, and the other one does the Facebook ads. She prepares an email newsletter. I do the content. All or lots of little things they go through and check. All my A-plus content has been done on Amazon.\n\nThey check all the blurbs and make sure that they are sharp. They look at all the reviews to make sure there are no dramas with any of those because I hate reviews. I love reviews, but you do not want to read the ones that are not good. They check trends and make sure reviews that there is not a trend in one of my books that needs adjusting. There is so much work that they could be working 48 hours, and it still would not be enough.\n\nThank you for sharing because I realized that I took the StrengthsFinder test, which I do not know if you have taken it. One of the categories is execution or executing, which is somebody who has the strength to complete things and get little tasks done quickly. I have zero. I realized like, “My strengths are in something else.”\n\nI hired somebody for five hours a week, not even a ton of time, but to do some of the things that take me three hours and drain me what she can do in one hour and feel fine. To me, it is worth it at this point. I maybe should have done it earlier, which I have heard people say many times. I am like, “No.” Now that I can focus on the stuff that I love, I get to put my attention on the stuff that I love and am good at.\n\nI tend to forget things I do not want to do. Even if it is written in my diary, I will cross it out and move it to the next week. Whereas having my daughter is different from me. She is very focused. That helps me because she will go, “You are meant to be doing this. I need you to do this. I will do this.” My daughter-in-law is the same. She is like, “The email newsletter, what is happening?”\n\nBecause they know me so well, we work well together. I can understand where they are coming from and understand where I am coming from. They are protective of me and my writing time. That is huge. They are aware of burnout and stuff like that. I am lucky that we work well in this. They are both smart cookies. I am lucky to have both of them, which has worked in my favor.\n\nTalk about a writing community, you have got your writers, the SPA Girls, and team of assistants. Speaking about something that is been a theme in my life, I do not know how much I have talked about on the show. Part of why I like helping women around this, and I have had a couple of mind shifts, like awareness around this topic, is designing my life to work for me instead of adjusting my life to work for somebody else.\n\nA lot of women spend a good amount of their life flexing, bending, and trying to fit into somebody else’s priorities. It takes time to realize it, I am like, “I do not have to bend to everybody else. Just because society or whoever expects me to do all the laundry, dishes, and whatever does not mean I have to. I could send out my laundry or hire somebody to clean my house.” It is different for different people. You know about yourself that you forget things that you do not want to do, so you can design your life to work for you.\n\nIf you are a people pleaser, it is hard being out there in the world. I am a people pleaser. You give so much of yourself to everyone and everything. This works for me because I have to be self-motivated and do it myself and everything. No one is interfering with what I do, and I do not have to please anyone to do what I do. That works well for me. That is the way I see it. I have never been happier than when I am self-employed and doing what I love.\n\nIt is a lot of work to be self-employed, but the freedom that comes with it is worth it for me.\n\nThe thing is you are effectively running your own publishing house. That is a lot of hats to wear. That is why sometimes you need help.\n\nAfter a certain point, everybody should hire help. As soon as you can, get some help. You do not have to do it by yourself. I want to talk a little bit more about the idea of having one product. Talk about the business mind. When you author, it is a business. Your book is your product. How can you repurpose it, so you do not have to keep on having all your income only come from the eBook or whatever it is? You mentioned print books, translations, and audiobooks. I hadn’t even thought about translations until I went to a workshop and somebody mentioned it. Have you done some, or are you in the middle of them now?\n\nI am in the process of doing it. One of my series, which, funnily enough, is the series that the editor did not want all those years ago, is far and above surpassed all the others. People love it. That one is the one I put into audio usually. I am now putting it into German translation. I am doing the first two books straight up to see how they go. I love writing. I was writing seven books a year or whatever I was doing. You get to this stage where you are like, “That is not working for me.” It was about trying to make those products work the best I could.\n\nBeing self-published means not being on a schedule. The schedule is your schedule. Live your best life.\n\nI will check-in and go back to this show in months or a year and see how that all turned out for you.\n\nYou have got to understand that you are not going to get the money back straight away for them. When you go to Amazon and see a book that has got an eBook, print, or audio, it looks amazing. I am not saying everyone can do that, and not everyone should. For me, I am at the stage in my writing that I am in which is trying to look to something else.\n\nThat is what I was about to say. I would not say if you are barely starting out to make sure that you have your first book in German as well. I want to point out that you had a good neener moment with the people who rejected you. You are like, “This was my bestselling one, actually.”\n\nThe rejection is quite hard. I remember I can still feel it. I was going to be traditionally published, and that was it. That was my goal. I got an editor, and everything was going well. It is a real kicker. You have to be able to pivot, but it is not this game. Pivoting is massive. It is always changing.\n\nI would love to know some of the benefits. I talked a little about the writing, strategies, and things you can do. I want to spend a little time right at this moment talking about some of the benefits and the freedoms in your life outside of the writing that you get from the writing. I wish sometimes I could show people.\n\nA few years ago here in North America, there was a solar eclipse. It was about an hour and a half away drive for me to see it. It was on a Monday. I did not have to ask anybody or get my time off from work. I could go and it was amazing. I would love to inspire people because it is a lot of work. What is it to live on the other side? What does the other side look like? We have talked about the assistance and things.\n\nThe benefits are massive because I have four grandchildren. I get to spend a lot of time with those grandchildren. I get to spend a lot of time with my kids. The real benefit over these last years is that we have moved down to where our children live. I was able to retire my husband after however many years he had been working in a hard job since he was nineteen. It is to be able to say to him, “When we move, you do not need to go back to work.”\n\nHe is home with me, but he is off doing his thing. He is out mountain biking with the grandchildren. It is the freedom of being able to go down and pick up the grandkids. It is for me to go and see my parents, who live a couple of hours away. I am not on a schedule. The schedule is my schedule. If I do not get my writing done during the day because I am doing something else, I will do it at night or put it off tomorrow. It is the freedom to live your best life.\n\nI love that. If I were not doing this interview now, I would be taking a moment with this kitty who clearly wants my attention at the moment. When I am not recording something or if I am in the middle of working, I stop and take a half-hour break to cuddle with my kitty.\n\nThat is exactly what I did. Sometimes I am like, “I can’t be doing this.” I will get up. I like to get out and walk, ride my bike, go mountain biking, or whatever. I am like, “Let’s go.” I had my husband pick up the bikes and like, “Let’s go.” For me, it is a great lifestyle. That is what I love. I was lucky enough to find something that I was quite good at. That was a plus.\n\nI am grateful for self-publishing, and I am grateful that traditional publishers did not do it because they might have said, “We do not like that. It is out of some of the stories that you have created.” I have said this before too. I love self-publishing because if you can find an audience who likes what you like, you can make a living. You do not have somebody somewhere saying, “That is not good enough.”\n\nI have got a reader’s group on Facebook, and they were amazing. They have been with me. Some of them have been with me from the start. They are the coolest people. I get to interact with them, and they love me. It is so neat. I love that side of it.\n\nNobody gets to tell you that you can’t create your joy. Your editor might be like, “No,” and you are like, “Okay.” It is not smooth sailing all the time. There is a lot of work and things to do. You are writing the stories. You have people marketing for you, doing ads, newsletters, translations, and audio. It is a lot if you think about all the things. That is a ton, but you also get a lot. Sometimes, I forget to focus on that. It is not just the money, although the money helps and makes it easier. That is the thought I was going to have.\n\nThat is the thought that I lost a long time ago. Money is motivating. I do not remember what it went with, but that was the thought that I lost. It was something effective. What is very motivating is money helps. We have been a little bit all over, but it has been a lovely conversation. What would be the best advice you would give authors at the beginning of their author journey?\n\nWith writing, it would be to write the book if you are struggling to get to the end. When I was first writing, I struggled massively to finish the book. I met Anne Gracie and she told me, “When you are blocked, write in capital letters what it is and carry on.” That is the one track that got me to finish my first book. That would be writing-wise. What I would suggest with everything else is it would be to find your tribe. There is a lot of noise and voices out there.\n\nThere are a lot of people wanting you to pay money for things. Make wise decisions. Sometimes you will make mistakes, but find that one person who gets you and you get them, the one person you can ring and go, “I cannot get this plot to work. What do you think of this? Should I do that?” It is that one person to bolster to say, “Keep going. You are doing a good job.” Sometimes you need that. That is my one piece of advice.\n\nI will say to your finding courses and things and people you respect. I have purchased a lot of courses, but the one thing I got out of it was I met somebody else who was taking the course. They became that one person. It was not the person who sold me the course. It was somebody else, like how you met your ladies at the RWNZ. Sometimes, the course might be a mistake, but the people you met in the course were not.\n\nYou have to invest in this business, and spending money on courses can be that too, but make sure you know what you are getting into.\n\nWhere is the best place for people to find you?\n\nFor historicals, it is everywhere on Wendy Vella.
