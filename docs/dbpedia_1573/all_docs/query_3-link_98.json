        "text": "Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Before we dive into the main focus of our interview, our readers would love to “get to know you” a bit better. Can you share a story about what motivated you to become an expert in the particular area that you are writing about?\n\nMy husband always claimed I became a health writer ’cause being a reporter (my initial area) was the only way to force a doctor to answer my questions! I’ve lived with a chronic condition since I was a kid and every time I questioned the doc I got patted on the head and told, “There, there, sweetheart. Don’t worry.” Ugh!\n\nBut once you’re calling for news….boy, does that win respect!\n\nThen, because Y2K was looming at the end of the 90s, I got dragged into covering technology, especially in healthcare (aka HIT). You could almost say I first ghosted for hubby. He was one of NYC’s early Mac consultants, at a time when you had to create user manuals for custom databases (his area of IT). Guess who had to write his manuals…and make sure the info was truly easy to understand?\n\nIn fact, “Turning the Complex into the Comprehensible©” has been my company motto since I started. So whether it’s clinical topics like neurology and diabetes, or business issues (including law), or tech, my emphasis has always been plain language.\n\nCan you share a pivotal story that shaped the course of your career?\n\nI think it was because of dollar issues. PR (public relations) paid better than journalism and so after several years as a reporter I crossed (as one colleague put it) “to the dark side of marketing.” But coming out of journalism I knew that pitching alone wasn’t going to grab attention. You had to create real story topics and solid news that would truly interest journalists’ coverage.\n\nFirst, I fell into working with a small agency and one of their projects was launching the first Vision Expo, a new optical trade show. About two weeks before the event, we’re at the last Board meeting and one leader suggests we get the word out in the general media, not just in the trade press we’d targeted for nearly a year. But we had no budget left. I look at all the guys (I was the only female at the meeting) and ask, “What if I sent out your choices for the ‘Best Dressed Eyes in America’? The companies around the table had so many celebs endorsing their eyewear it was supposed to be TEN Best Dressed, but we ended up with 11…hence the more generic name.\n\nIt took about one hour to write, one board member reviewed, and I sent it out to the AP (Associated Press) wire. It got picked up (and trust me, it’s amazing to be chosen!) and exploded across U.S. news outlets.\n\nIn my next job, at a bigger agency, the staffers (all experienced in PR) had put together a gorgeous luncheon to promote a new electronic diabetes monitor. But while that product was new, these monitors overall weren’t really news at that point. My supervisor, whose media alert had only brought two reporters (from fairly minor pubs) to sign on, dumped the follow-up on me.\n\nI HATE pitching! Like many writers, I’m not a salesperson by nature. So I had to find a story to fascinate my fellow journalists. We were at a point in time when many women were already giving birth later in life. I found that on our panel, one of the doctors was an expert in gestational diabetes, a form of diabetes that is more prevalent in later pregnancies. So first I called women’s mags, like Family Circle, (which I’d written for earlier in my career) and then women reporters at other major pubs, telling them about this late-in-life pregnancy risk. I gleaned 26 more attendees for a total of 28 out of the 30 we had room for. And they came from well-known places like Time and Woman’s Day and others. The bosses were thrilled. (Not that my supervisor gave me credit.)\n\nHaving BOTH the journalism and the marketing backgrounds has meant always having great tools not only for marketing my own books, but helping others.\n\nWhat are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now? Are you working on any new writing projects?\n\nI’ve had four new clients that came on in 2020, some of whom are still going — others got knocked out by the pandemic. Interestingly, they all needed reporting expertise. I’ve written for GetMeGiddy.com, which provides insights on sexual health; AthletechNews.com, the only business news for the fitness industry, and late last year a piece for Radiant Life magazine. The latter’s an online pub that offers great ways to bring a more positive outlook to our lives and that story runs this March. I also write both business features and marketing advice for Legal Management magazine, the publication of the Association of Legal Administrators. My next story for them, on diversity issues, is also scheduled for March.\n\nI’m also starting a ghosting role with a holistic RD (dietitian)…but I can’t tell you more about her yet.\n\nThank you for all of that. Let’s now shift to the core focus of our interview. Can you please tell us a bit about your book? Can you please share a specific passage or story that illustrates the main theme of your book?\n\nMy two most recent books were actually eBooks…which are marketing options many authors don’t know about. The first, in 2018, was written for the Editorial Freelancers Association’s (EFA) library and it’s Web 1.0: Content and Design Pointers That Produce Profits. More recently, I wrote the first in my Small Biz Savvy series, subtitled “Marketing Your Business on a Shoestring.” I actually did a three-year podcast that inspired this — it was “Piggy Bank Promotions.” So this starts small biz off with solid, affordable, marketing basics. I’ll have others coming up next year, with more specific topics like Blogging Your Business, and Don’t Forget Radio!\n\nYou are a successful author and thought leader. Which three character traits do you feel were most instrumental to your success when launching your book? Can you please share a story or example for each?\n\nThe first is Focus: Who was I trying to reach? Most authors only think of themselves; “This is what I want to tell!” Well, that’s great…but who do you figure wants to hear what you’re telling?\n\nThe second is Staying Positive. I admit it’s still a challenge for me. Many writers are actually very insecure. We KNOW we’re writing the next great diet…or self-help…or biz success book, etc….but many authors still wonder, “Have I done this right? Who’s going to read this? What was I thinking?” and so on. You have to find a way to not see these as obstacles, but interesting challenges. I learned to do that and to spin it even further to: “And I have the insights for meeting these challenges!”\n\nThe third is Broadening Horizons. Those of us who ghostwrite are used to authors THINKING they know everything! But who in life does? Even if you’ve launched what became a Fortune 500 company, no one does everything. At Apple, Wozniak was the true tech guru, but it was Jobs that spun the equipment and message into things that exploded interest.\n\nLast year I was actually the ghostwriter for one of the world’s leading ghostwriters, Claudia Suzanne. I wrote her blogs, which became enewsletters. I remember her teaching you can try to guide an author — be it about changing copy or offering new ideas and opportunities — by repeating your suggestion up to three times. But if that author keeps insisting, “No…THIS is the best way to do XXX!” then after your third suggestion you follow your client. Of course, as the author, all final decisions are theirs…but so are all the responsibilities.\n\nIn my work, I have found that writing a book can be a great way to grow a brand. Can you share some stories or examples from your own experience about how you helped your own business or brand grow by writing a book? What was the “before and after picture?” What were things like before, and how did things change after the book?\n\nWriting made me focus on different niches to reach, at different points in time. I love helping fellow writers and editors and have actually taught EFA classes almost since I started over 20 years ago. It’s provided great opportunities for being interviewed and also gave me classes I could offer to others.\n\nThe 2nd book, Smart Biz Savvy, is actually a series. And working on this area and the podcast I mentioned earlier has really helped me be seen as a great small biz advisor.\n\nOf course, writing one’s own material is always the hardest. I learned one key aid for almost all my work is finding a great transcriptionist. I did that ’cause of my work interviewing so many of Claudia’s grads. It saves me SO much time to just copy and paste great quotes into whatever I’m writing.\n\nIt’s also critical to generate solid time management skills. Since I added software that helps me (LessAnnoyCRM), I stay better on track.\n\nIf a friend came to you and said “I’m considering writing a book but I’m on the fence if it is worth the effort and expense” what would you answer? Can you explain how writing a book in particular, and thought leadership in general, can create lucrative opportunities and help a business or brand grow?\n\nNowadays, I ask them two key questions first:\n\nWhy do they think a book is going to help their recognition?\n\nDo they really need a trad’l book, or have they heard about eBooks?\n\nAnswers to those two questions of course lead to better insights and advice in my free 30-minute chats.\n\nAs for leading to lucrative opportunities, yes it gives one extra panache to be the author of the book about _____________ (fill in the blank). It helps get you onto podcasts and trad’l broadcast outlets. Or when one becomes a speaker at local, even nat’l events, it’s nice when the intro says, “Jane (John) Smith is TITLE (like the head of ABC Company)…and the author of XYZ Book.”\n\nWhat are the things that you wish you knew about promoting a book before you started? What did you learn the hard way? Can you share some stories about that which other aspiring writers can learn from?\n\nMost important is that, like all of marketing…it ain’t easy. You don’t just put the book on Amazon (or your website) and figure it’ll go flying into high end sales.\n\nI spent time pitching in PR…and I hated it. I only succeeded ‘cause — as I said earlier — I always crafted a good story, one that fascinated those covering the topic.\n\nI know from experience that authors THINK they can handle their own marketing, but the smart ones admit which parts (and there are different aspects) they really can/can’t handle. See my five pointers for an example.\n\nBased on your experience, which promotional elements would you recommend to an author to cover on their own and when would you recommend engaging an expert?\n\nI don’t think there’s one rule of thumb. Maybe — because they’re writers — most authors could develop blogs regularly. But are they good Tweeters? Or maybe someone’s a millennial who could Tweet all day, but doesn’t feel they have time to blog. Or they love YouTube…but can’t figure out how to provide a savvy insight in two minutes or less.\n\nAnd authors need to remember: a ghostwriter is their book developer. That doesn’t mean we’re a marketing consultant too. Most deliver your manuscript and are done. But there are some like me who provide additional services — like self-publishing, PR, blogging, etc. — but those are separate fees and timelines.\n\nWonderful. Here is the main question of our interview. Based on your own experience and success, what are the “five things an author needs to know to successfully promote and market a book?” If you can, please share a story or example for each.\n\nWhat is their real message and targets? You really need to know these, otherwise you can’t write, let alone market, any book. If it’s more than one target, why? With more than one, would it really be better as a series of eBooks? I just had this discussion with a major older celeb who has tons of fascinating memories to share. It could be one huge book, but as shorter eBooks with themes, he could be increasingly thought about…and keep bringing in extra dollars.\n\nHow long are they figuring ’til it’s ready? Do they already have a manuscript? Is it just a brilliant idea? How are they figuring on moving that idea into reality? Some ghostwriting colleagues tell stories about getting emails or phone calls from some big muck-a-muck, like an internationally renowned doctor or some Fortune 500 exec, and these folks say, “OK, so I know XYZ is a brilliant idea. You research it and write it for me!”\n\nHow do they figure on getting the word out? — As I mentioned earlier, do they understand what it takes to market a book? I did a 2020 website for an author who started her books late in life. I asked if she’d like a blogging tab and she said “Yes,” figuring that blogging would be easy. It’s just writing stories, right? Well, I wrote her first blog and she wrote one more…and nothing since. “It’s just not really going to sell anything,” seems to be her reasoning. Well of course not, because she’s a) got to produce regular blogs…and b) then has to let folks know her latest brilliance is out there.\n\nHow open are they to new options? — I know that neither Pinterest nor Instagram were tools for promoting my books. But that doesn’t mean one or both won’t help other authors. And who knows what’ll be out there tomorrow? The author I just mentioned? Yes, the pandemic hit, and she couldn’t present live at B&Ns or libraries…but in many ways she had even more opps for reaching prospective readers! I attended a Zoom hosted by my local library and others, featuring one of my favorite romance writers, Debbie Macomber. This lady’s been famous for years. Why should she bother with promotional tours of any kind? And if SHE still markets, why shouldn’t authors like the one I just mentioned?\n\nWhat can they really do themselves? — You MUST be honest. Are you a brilliant Tweeter, but would never want to be on any vid, be it trad’l TV or today’s YouTube? Do you THINK, like my author in point #3, you can write regular blogs….but it turns out it’s not your cup of tea? So what is your back-up plan?\n\nThere are actually two more questions that authors always have to answer: what sort of timeline are they willing to factor…and what is their budget? If they’re not realistic about both of these…especially after we’ve mapped out the rest…then their book’s not getting done. Especially without any professional help.\n\nWe are very blessed that some of the biggest names in Business, VC funding, Sports, and Entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US, with whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch, and why? He or she might just see this, especially if we both tag them :-)\n\nWhy not add insights from another prez to my portfolio? I interviewed Bush ’43 when the Part D drug bill passed, and\n\nI would love to chat with the current Prez and beg him to get the word around to each member of Congress to produce localized ads — maybe even for holidays like Martin Luther King Day, Valentine’s, etc. — telling their at-home constituents how, “The new Infrastructure dollars are going to help Smallville, USA, thanks to new [low-income housing, or roads, or whatever] we’ll be building with those dollars!” or “We need to make sure all Americans have a right to vote. THAT’S the way we get Infrastructure dollars, education funds for your kids and grandkids and more!”\n\nAnd there’s still time to be doing this kind of outreach!\n\nI’d also like to interview one of the leaders at Apple Health — I don’t care which one’s reading this! ☺ My first PR work was actually volunteer, with the NY MacUsers Group. I was the only non-techie in the leadership and yet I got them in the NY Times, and got my hubby — as one of their leaders — in the NY Daily News and on CNBC. But Apple was just creating desktops back then. As a health writer, it’s been especially fascinating to watch this whole other area of Apple grow.\n\nThere’s also the lady on Shark Tank, Lori Greiner. She’s the one who’s gotten tons of stuff on QVC and frankly I’d just love to know how she found the time!\n\nHow can our readers further follow your work online?\n\nWatch out for me on LinkedIn and also my own blogs, though I admit it’s hard to get my own stuff up as often as I should! A better way to get my regular, bi-monthly, insights is to sign on to one of my newsletters. One is for those in health communications, one for those reaching seniors, and one in B2B.\n\nI’m also teaching new classes this year. The first is scheduled for January 19: “Succeeding as a Magazine Writer…and more.” It’s about making money (and/or gaining visibility) by writing stories in magazines, newsletters, for blogs, etc.\n\nThe next one starts in February: “Marketing Your Biz in a Shoestring.” Just as it says, I teach key marketing tools that even small businesses on tight budgets can use to enhance visibility.\n\nMarch and April classes are also scheduled. The latter two will be available with a two-fer discount option. Otherwise each class (including February’s) can be paid separately.\n\nJust email me at wjmeyeroff@gmail.com and tell me about a class and/or email list you’d like, and/or ask for the free 30-minute chat I mentioned."
