This is a song about Wendy by a friend of ours named Andy Prieboy Of all the voodoo This is a song about a woman with AIDS, Which someone in this room has, A few of these people in this room has. And you'll go through it and you'll know and we should stop it This is for Wendy\" It is complete now 2 ends of time are neatly tied A one way street She's walking to the end of the line And there she meets Faces she see's in her heart and mind They say, Good Try Tomorrow Wendy is going to die. Tomorrow Wendy is going to die. Underneath the chilly gray November sky We can make believe that Kennedy is Still alive and We're shooting for the moon and Smiling Jackies drivin' by They say, Good Try Tomorrow Wendy is going to die. Tomorrow Wendy is going to die. I told the priest Don't count on any second coming God got his ass kicked the first time He came down here slumming. He had the balls to come The gall to die and then forgive us No I don't wonder why I wonder what He thought it would get us Yeah, goodbye tomorrow Wendy is going to die. Only God says jump But I set the time 'cause if he ever saw it It was through these eyes of mine And if he ever suffered It was me who did his crying Yeah goodbye Tomorrow Wendy is going to die.\n\nWatch: New Singing Lesson Videos Can Make Anyone A Great Singer"
