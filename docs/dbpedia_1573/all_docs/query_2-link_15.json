        "text": "It is complete now the two ends of time are neatly tied\n\nA one-way street, she′s walking to end of the line\n\nAnd there she meets the faces she keeps in her heart and mind\n\nThey say 'good bye′ Tomorrow, Wendy, is going to die,\n\nThey say 'good bye' Tomorrow, Wendy, is going to die,\n\nUnderneath the chilly gray November sky\n\nWe can make believe that Kennedy is still alive and\n\nWere shooting for the moon and smiling Jackie′s driving by and\n\nThey say ′good try'\n\nTomorrow Wendy is going to die\n\nTomorrow Wendy is going to die\n\nI told the priest, Don′t count on any second coming\n\nGod got his ass kicked the first time he came down here slumming\n\nHe had the balls to come, the gall to die and then forgive us\n\nNo, I don't wonder why, I wonder what he thought it would get us\n\nHey, hey, good bye\n\nTomorrow Wendy′s going to die\n\nHey, hey, good bye\n\nTomorrow Wendy's going to die\n\nTomorrow Wendy′s going to die\n\nOnly God says jump\n\nSo I set the time\n\n'Cause if he ever saw her\n\nIt was through these eyes of mine!\n\nAnd if he ever suffered it was me who did his crying\n\nHey hey, good bye\n\nTomorrow Wendy's going to die\n\n(Tomorrow Wendy′s going to die)\n\nTomorrow Wendy′s going to die\n\n(Tomorrow Wendy's going to die)\n\nTomorrow Wendy′d going to die\n\nHey, hey, good bye\n\nTomorrow Wendy's going to die\n\nHey, hey, good bye\n\nTomorrow Wendy′s going to die\n\nTomorrow Wendy's going to die\n\nTomorrow Wendys going to die\n\nWriter(s): Andrew Joseph Prieboy<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
