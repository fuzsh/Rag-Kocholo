Well, I hope!\n\nQUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT\n\nThings are getting busier and busier as I move toward the release date of QUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT on May 1st!\n\nFirstly, let me tell you that I have approved the test pressings for QUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT. I have 5 of them (10 discs, it’s a double vinyl of course) and I’ve spent the last 3 days going through all of them to be certain that all the music, the levels, the spacing, the tracking listing is correct.\n\nIt truly sounds wonderful! I knew this anyway but seeing it revolve on a turn-table is another landmark in the progress of this record!\n\nPlease do preorder your copies here: https://thewendyjames.com/store\n\nIf you want to own one of 5 Test Pressing packages they are an incredible artifact, a collectors item, then please do, I’ve made them available here:\n\nThe deadline for being on the Certificate Of Contributors is looming, artwork has been sent off to the manufacturers and soon they will have to print, I’d say there are about 3 weeks left… the Certificate of Contributors comes with either the Deluxe Vinyl here: or the Deluxe CD here:\n\nOf course the lyrics/mix notes from my recording sessions are still available here.\n\nThe official Queen High Straight poster here.\n\nThe official Queen High Straight black t-shirts here.\n\nThe official Queen High Straight white t-shirts here.\n\n– and of course the Kurt Shirt, The Face Magazine and Every Song Is Dope t-shirts are constantly available!\n\n– and my picture disc for The Price Of The Ticket is here.\n\nSo…. get whatever you like!!\n\nTHE WENDY JAMES BAND May 2020 QUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT Album Launch TOUR!\n\nYes!

Completing QUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT with not a single note out of place or a single thing forgotten or overlooked in the recording, mixing and mastering. I am so, so pleased with this album, in fact ‘pleased’ is a polite understatement! I am thrilled and joyous! It is the best thing I’ve done in my life and I cannot wait for you all to have it and hear it!\n\nI’ve set the release date for MAY 1!\n\nPre-Order here\n\nI went on tour, opening for The Psychedelic Furs in October with my official band THE WENDY JAMES BAND. This band are the best band I’ve had. I love these guys! They are so talented, so hard working, so nimble with whatever happens, they are funny and honest and humble and they make me feel so effortlessly in top form on stage!\n\nI have some gigs already confirmed for May to support the launch of the album and by the time May rolls around there will be plenty. I am also going to do instore signings on the days of the gigs, wherever possible, and I hope some live performances on regional and national radio too.\n\nKeep an eye on my social media and the live page: https://thewendyjames.com/live for tickets and gig announcements and of course get your V.I.P. from my store!\n\nFor the remaining month of December there continues to be a 15% discount on everything at the web store: simply input the code seasonsgreetings15 at checkout!\n\nI hope you are pleased with the work I’ve done this year! The artwork is beautiful, don’t you think? And the music will thrill you in 2020. I hope you enjoyed the gigs you came to and that I see you all and more out on the road next year.\n\nI thank YOU for every single way you have given me care, love, support, enthusiasm and steadfast friendships and loyalty. I hope I met as many of you as wanted at the after show merch table experiences out on the road and signed as many of your items as I could and had many hugs and words with you all.\n\nI wish you all the best time, the best of health, the best of life and the happiest of New Years. See you in 2020!\n\nMy love\n\nWendy xxx\n\nSo! It is done!

My best! And I know you and I love all my records, but this one’s the best! I cannot wait for you to hear it!\n\nSo! Revel in the artwork! Pre-order your choices (and/or pre-existing items) and roll on 2020!\n\nMuch Love\n\nWendy xoxo\n\n– and THANK YOU!\n\nTO SEE FULL ARTWORK, PRE-ORDER OR BUY – CLICK HERE\n\n15.10.19\n\nHello Everyone!!\n\nSo boy, oh boy…\n\nThe last two months =\n\nMIX COMPLETE!\n\nTOUR COMPLETE!\n\nFor those of you who came out to the shows around UK with us, The Wendy James Band, opening for The Psychedelic Furs: Thank you SO much! We had the best time, I know for sure we played great gigs and when I met you all after the show it seemed to me that every single one of us was happy and thrilled by it all!\n\nI absolutely love the opportunity at each show to say Hi to as many of you as possible, reacquaint with old friends/fans who are repeat attendees! It’s such a great thing we all share between us.\n\nSo…\n\nWhat Next?!\n\nI am spending this week finishing the artwork and listening on my home stereo to the mix of the record. Then I will send the files off to NYC to be mastered for manufacturing and finally: templates/art and music will go off to be pressed and printed! Yikes! It is in the pipeline!\n\nTentatively working to a February 21, 2020 release and proposed new UK tour beginning on 23rd Feb, 2020. Neither of these things are written in stone but that’s my focus!\n\nWe certainly are planning far more touring for 2020 and further afield than simply UK, with EU, USA and AUS/JP being looked into.\n\nAs soon as the artwork is finished I will reveal, incrementally, the VINYL package, the CD packages, the Poster, the T-Shirts and the Contributors Certificate!\n\nYou will have access to buy one of the proofs of the artwork, which is a lovely thing to own and frame, and any of you wanting to be on the certificate, please do hurry because it’s going to have to end very soon so it can go off to the printers!\n\nAnd FYI – I have re-stocked the KURT SHIRT, THE FACE MAG and EVERY SONG IS DOPE so if you didn’t get one on tour, then you can get one now!\n\nAnd of course: Pre-Order QUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT!\n\nMy band are truly perfect! James Sclavunos on Drums, Leo Kurunis on Bass, Alex J. Ward on Rhythm Guitar and Keyboards, Rupert Greaves on Rhythm Guitar, Keyboards and Backing Vocals and Pip Stakem on Lead Guitar. They make all the songs, old and new, sound as urgent, thundering and sexy as they should and could be!\n\nOnce again: TO YOU ALL. I am here because you want me to be and I thank you so much and I am so pleased you love my music and all it entails!\n\nLove\n\nWendy xoxo\n\n“what is extraordinary about this album is it proceeds in many contrasting styles; hard, sexy, street smart and threatening yet romantic, whimsical, wistful and dreamy”\n\n17.09.19\n\nQUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT IS FINISHED!\n\nOfficially I have finished mixing my record!\n\nWhat started off sitting on my bed, staring out of the window, picking up my guitar and beginning this epic journey of 20 songs is now concluded, in North West London!\n\nIt started with one year and 2 months writing time, then to Lincolnshire, UK for a residential time recording the drums, bass, scratch guitar and scratch vocals.\n\nDRUMS: JAMES SCLAVUNOS\n\nBASS: HARRY BOHAY\n\nSCRATCH GUITAR AND VOCALS: WENDY JAMES\n\nEngineered by Ian Dowling\n\nThen it continued with me returning to the same residential studio and spending three weeks recording my rhythm guitar and my major vocals.\n\nEngineered by Joe Sage\n\nAsst. Engineer Pieter Riekerk\n\nThen came pianos and rhythm and lead guitar with myself and\n\nGUITARIST: JAMES SEDWARDS\n\n– recorded in East London in the Borough of Hackney and moving studio to West London to record additional guitar, backing vocals, accordion and the horn sections.\n\nTRUMPETS AND SAX: TERRY EDWARDS & ALEX J. WARD\n\nACCORDION: LOUIS VAUSE\n\nEngineer: Al Lawson\n\nThen finally the mix in NW London.\n\nMix Engineer Tim Morris\n\n– with the additional musical wisdom of James Sclavunos!\n\nSo, it’s a WRAP.\n\nDuring which time: Pledge went bust and I launched my own online store and made it to the finishing line!\n\nGIGS\n\nNow I am about to start rehearsals for the upcoming gigs opening for the Psychedelic Furs and my own show in Blackburn:\n\nDATES AS FOLLOWS:\n\nOctober\n\n1st.

Well, I hope!\n\nTHE MIX\n\nSo! the time is here! I leave for London on Tuesday 27th and begin mixing QUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT the very next morning on 28th.\n\nI have been listening to the album reference mixes, making notes and preparing myself to remember every single thing I want in each song. So many beautiful parts have been played by the musicians! James Sclavunos on Drums and Percussion, Harry Bohay on Bass, James Sedwards on Rhythm and Lead Guitar, Alex J. Ward on Alto Sax, Terry Edwards on Tenor and Baritone Sax, Flugelhorn, Cornet and Trumpet! and myself, of course, on Rhythm Guitar, Vocals, Backing Vocals, Piano and Keys and a Melodica on Track 18 ‘Cancel It… I’ll See Him On Monday’.\n\nWe (myself and the mix engineer) have allowed ourselves three weeks, 21 days to mix 20 songs. This may sound like a lot, or a comfortable schedule, but it’s not! That’s a real tall order to make 20 songs perfect in 21 days, usually one does recalls a few times to tweak and make perfect, but we will have to clear more than one song a day in order to be able to fit in that tweak time too!!\n\nThis is literally the last chance for a studio visit so if you want to come then click here.\n\n(and let me know which day suits you!) (the studio is up in N.W London, I’ll give you full address etc)\n\nI’m running out of the mix notes and lyric sheets from the session, but there are some and I can and will personalize them over to you!\n\nFive of the reference mixes from QUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT are now in a playlist on soundcloud here.\n\nand on my website here: it’s going to be SO good!!\n\nTHE ARTWORK\n\nMeantime the artwork for QUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT is coming together and boy oh boy it’s a doozy! To begin with, all the new photos I took with David Leigh Dodd are incredible! After years of working with Ricardo Gomes, (who has now been taken by Madonna full time to document her every move!) I feel very lucky to have fallen into the extremely talented Mr. Dodd’s lens! Alongside the photos, the actual design of the artwork is heaven, it’s labor intensive! but very rewarding, I’m working with a graphic designer at night and around the hours of his day job as the lead graphic designer at the merchandise company who make my T-Shirts!\n\nI’ll be able to do a big reveal very soon! and within that reveal will be the multiple formats! The Deluxe Gatefold Vinyl Package, the Deluxe Gatefold CD Package, the Regular CD, the Contributors Certificate, the Official T-Shirt and the Official Poster! (Single 7” releases and other formats to be decided!)\n\nPRE-ORDER your choice of format or associated official poster/t-shirt for WENDY JAMES QUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT here\n\nHere are a couple of photographs I’ve already teased on social media from the shoot!\n\nTHE NEW T-SHIRTS!\n\nYes!!!! The Kurt Shirt!! OMG…. we did it! With my graphic designer we found the original art for the Transvision Vamp T-Shirt, derived of the 12” Vinyl single release of ‘(I Just Wanna) B with U’. I put out a public appeal for everyone to send me photos of their original ‘Kurt Shirt’ t-shirt, if they still owned one, so I could make sure everything was authentic and correct, it turns out that the one Kurt Cobain wore was the American version of the tour t-shirt, because I’ve now seen different iterations from the European leg of Transvision Vamp’s 1991 world tour, I’ve seen an Australian and NZ version and I’ve seen the American and UK version.\n\nSo! if you didn’t have one then, or if you did and it’s been lost or disintegrated since then, now you can replace it! or have one for the first time! It’s a classic T-Shirt and made all the more precious because it’s just super cool that Kurt wore it!\n\nTHE KURT SHIRT here\n\nand… THE FACE MAGAZINE. I found a pristine copy of The Face Magazine which had me on the cover and we went to great lengths to scan it in the highest resolution possible so we’d get a great T-Shirt out of it and so it is! Classic! Photography by Jurgen Teller and I believe the highest selling edition of the iconic Face Magazine ever.\n\nWENDY JAMES/FACE MAGAZINE T-Shirt here\n\nEVERY SONG IS DOPE T-Shirt here\n\nI am definitely wearing mine on the upcoming tour opening for the Psychedelic Furs around the UK!\n\nTHE GIGS\n\nRemember to get your tickets for The Wendy James Band opening for The Psychedelic Furs:\n\nTickets here: http://po.st/WendyJamesFurs19\n\nVIP gig pass here: https://thewendyjames.com/store\n\nI have the pleasure of announcing my own show on October 2nd in Blackburn at King Georges Hall!\n\nTickets here: https://www.kinggeorgeshall.com/whats-on/wendy-james/\n\nVIP gig pass here: https://thewendyjames.com/store\n\nOctober\n\n1st.

I will be mixing in North West London from August 28th until September 17th. If you want to come and hear and see the final stage of the LP in process and meet me then get the VIP STUDIO VISIT here and specify which date suits you! The album already sounds wonderful in rough mix form so this final stage is going to send it rocketing to the sonic mountain top!\n\n*To this end:\n\nMix Notes and Lyric Sheets from the sessions are something that I’m signing over and personalizing to whomever wants this little bit of history.\n\n*To this end:\n\nI have uploaded TRK 2 ‘PERILOUS BEAUTY’ (ref mix) and TRK 17 ‘I’LL BE HERE WHEN THE MORNING COMES’ (ref mix) to the iplayer here: https://thewendyjames.com/queen-high-straight/ and on soundcloud here: https://soundcloud.com/the-wendy-james\n\nARTWORK!\n\nYou know I was shooting the main photographs for the album art the other week and now it’s all being laid out by a graphic designer. The artwork and the album will go off to be manufactured while I’m out on the road! I will have the record mastered shortly after the mix is finished and then everything goes off (parts, as they are called) the parts all go off to different manufacturing plants. So! If you want your name on the ‘Certificate Of Contributors’ (sized for the Vinyl or the Deluxe CD) then I would have to say end of September is the deadline for that particular choice.\n\nI’ll do a ‘reveal’ of some of the artwork soon and of course the proofs will go on sale at the store as well here.\n\nA handful of large proofs sent to me from the manufacturer to approve going into mass production. Much like a test pressing for vinyl! (Which are also available at the store!) here.\n\nMy main tasks for August are to make all my final mix notes, learn my set list for the gigs! and oversee the artwork… if all that happens, (and it must!) then we are full speed ahead for a complete album and delivery set for 3rd Week Feb 2020 (I hope!!!) Preorder QUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT here: https://thewendyjames.com/store\n\nAnd btw – My agent is booking February 2020 for a QUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT UK/EU tour so… that will all be coming along soon. As soon as I know, you will know!\n\nMuch Love,\n\nEnjoy the now 5 ref mixes I’ve posted from QUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT!\n\nWendy xoxo\n\nNews!\n\nThe final mix of QUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT is now scheduled for AUGUST 27TH through until SEPTEMBER 17TH in North West London – if you want to come on a studio visit for this momentous last part of the recording then please do! via my web store thewendyjames.com/store and just let me know which date you think suits you and it can be arranged!\n\nThe mix now being set I have begun the organize the design for the cover art! I have to put together a gatefold Vinyl, a gatefold CD, a regular CD, a download plus the liner notes, the inner sleeves, the booklet and of course the contributors certificate! I have a very good idea for the art and I’m talking to layout graphic designers at the moment to see who might do the job! To this end, I did four days of shooting new photographs for the album cover and for new press shots and there are some truly amazing photographs, I cannot wait to share them with you. I added into my web store the offer to own one of the proofs the production company will send me to sign off on the finished layout for cover art: there are only ever going to be a few proofs so it’s a collectors item and I will happily sign it over to you!\n\nDitto – I’ve added some new I CAME HERE TO BLOW MINDS on Vinyl and CD into the store, so for those of you who didn’t ever have a copy of that, then now you can!!\n\nI’m about to announce an additional gig I’ve booked for OCT 2 up in Blackburn UK, sandwiched in-between the Psychedelic Furs tour I’m opening for and if you want VIP for that then as always: go to thewendyjames.com/store\n\nIt’s really exciting and as each stage completes then it brings enormous satisfaction with the results and of course gratitude to everyone that partakes and helps me! Whether it’s simply the supportive messages on FB and INSTA and Twitter which you know I enjoy and answer to, through to every single purchase which literally helps pay for the album to be finished, right through to the artists, photographers and musicians who are co-working with me on this!\n\nHere are four short little insta story video clips!\n\n1. I CAME HERE TO BLOW MINDS #ROMA:\n\n2. YOU’RE SO GREAT #ROMA:\n\n3. AMERICANO #ROMA:\n\nAnd FYI – I’ve overhauled the web store so now there is a credit card option, an apple pay option and still PayPal plus we’ve input a postage algorithm which measures the weight and distance of your package and charges accordingly!\n\nPhew!\n\nOk, I literally have to write out the chord charts now for THE WENDY JAMES BAND set list for all the musicians!\n\nTo hear 3 reference mixes from QUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT use the iplayer on the website:\n\nhttps://thewendyjames.com/queen-high-straight/\n\nor soundcloud:\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/the-wendy-james\n\nMuch Love\n\nWendy xoxo\n\nFor all THE WENDY JAMES items here: thewendyjames.com/store\n\nSubscribe to THE WENDY JAMES News Letters here:\n\nYes! I have finished recording my new double album, 20 songs strong, ‘Queen High Straight’. You all know it took me a year and two months to write and now another year to record. It’s been a long process because simply so many variables have to fall into time together: the engineers schedule, the recording studio availability and schedule, the musicians schedule, in this case I have had to raise the budget myself and that is not always readily available! but I have to say, having recorded in increments: bass, drums and scratch vocals/guitar to begin with, then my real singing and my real guitar playing, then the additional rhythm guitar and piano, then the horn section, accordion and lead guitar overdubs, then the percussion and finally the backing vocals, sung by me. Because each recording session had a few weeks in-between each of them I had the very necessary time to maintain objectivity each time and thus make all the correct and clear-headed/clear-eared decisions for production ideas and requirements! My musicians are some of the very best musicians alive today! James Sclavunos on Drums and Percussion, Harry Bohay Nowell on Bass (he is now replaced by Leo Kurunis), James Sedwards on Rhythm Guitar (along side me) and on Lead Guitar, Alex J. Ward on Alto Sax, Terry Edwards on Tenor & Baritone Sax, Trumpet, Cornet and Flugelhorn and Louis Vause on Accordion. I’ve been enabled along the way by the engineering skills of Ian Dowling, Joe Sage and Al Lawson and it’s been an intense body of work to complete! But complete it is and now my attention turns to THE MIX. I am looking, once again, at engineers, schedules, studios and prices! I aim to do the final mix in July/August ending with the mastering of the record… so I am into the last two stages now!\n\nYou may now hear a small selection of preview reference mixes on the Queen High Straight page real-player: click here:\n\n(or alternatively at my soundcloud page: click here)\n\nAnd please go ahead and pre-order your copy of QUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT from my web store www.thewendyjames.com/store click here\n\nThank you so much for all your love, solidarity, enthusiasm and encouragement!\n\nAlways\n\nWendy James 03/06/19\n\nWell!\n\n– I’ve announced the fact that my band THE WENDY JAMES BAND are opening for The Psychedelic Furs in October and I THINK I’ll be able to announce further shows in the next week or so!\n\n– Going out with the P. Furs is so exciting and makes me so happy… I know Richard Butler a little and see him at his painting exhibitions in NYC and as an audience member when The Psychedelic Furs play the East Coast of USA! Richard is a very good artist and decent chap too! As a teenager, I remember, like tons of us, singing along to Pretty In Pink imagining I was Molly Ringwald, from the wrong side of the tracks, in the movie Pretty In Pink and early on I owned The Psychedelic Furs LP ‘Talk Talk Talk’.\n\nThere are some good gig times ahead in 2019!\n\nTickets go on sale tomorrow here: http://po.st/WendyJamesFurs19\n\nMy band THE WENDY JAMES BAND are as great a line-up of musicians a person dare wish for! James Sedwards and Alex J. Ward on guitar (and other instruments)! I met both of these men through the recording of my new double LP QUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT and they are heaven, their instinct and intuition for rhythm, feel, melody and style is perfect, I am happy and exhilarated in their company! Leo Kurunis is taking over bass playing from Harry Bohay-Nowell! He roomed with James Sedwards and he’s played with James Sclavunos and he is dynamite bass player! so that’s a win/win… and of course darling, most beloved genius drummer James Sclavunos who’s been drumming with me, percussioning with me, helping, advising and inspiring me for 7 years or so now… since the James Williamson/Jesse Nichols sessions out in California. I love James! James rules! and JAMES is phenomenal! So… it’s a bloody good line up and I’ve told Richard Butler (The Psychedelic Furs) that we’re gonna come ‘packing heat’ ! ha ha…\n\nFor THE WENDY JAMES GIG VIP Pass here: thewendyjames.com/store\n\nQUEEN HIGH STRAIGHT! 20 SONGS DOUBLE LP!\n\nYes… the end is in sight, I feel bound to apologize for it taking so long! However when it’s 20 songs, multiple musicians, multiple studios, multiple schedules AND self-funded these things are perhaps more of a juggling act than the good-old, bad-old days when a major record label had an open expense account for studio hire… and may I add I absolutely believe the calendar delays have worked in my favor in as much that they’ve enabled me to keep objectivity over the content of the recording and make all the right choices and decisions critical to arrangement and production of the album. It is the most divine piece of work and I am completely proud of it! I head back into the studio on May 8th through until 18th for the last recording session: my backing vocals and the final reference mixes, before then heading off to do THE MIX. The Mix will take a month?! 20 songs, 20 days plus 10 for recalls and fixes… this is the luxurious estimate, it may be I only have enough money for half that time!! We’ll see! BUT whatever it is: I will not compromise and I will not skimp and I will leave the studio with nothing less than perfect!\n\nFOR STUDIO VISIT VIP here:thewendyjames.com/store\n\nPLEDGE MUSIC transitioning into THE WENDY JAMES STORE\n\nthewendyjames.com/store\n\nI am waiting, like everyone else, for definitive news on the future of Pledge Music. I can fulfill all purchases made here at my store and in the meantime Pledge’s official statement is that they WILL honor all pre-existing Pledge pre-orders. Some people have had success in getting refunds, not through Pledge but through their credit card providers so hopefully this is a relief and an avenue for those of you who are concerned. The least I could do was immediately transition into my own online store which, thanks to my web manager, looks extremely good and functions effortlessly and practically. I can receive your pre-orders for all QHS items just as you used to through Pledge Music and I have all of my previous LPs and their merchandise on hand to ship immediately.

It took me a year and two months to write! The natural curve, perhaps, when writing new songs, is to have an outpouring of about 10 or 11 songs, but I found, this time, the more I pushed myself to write from scratch, i.e having exhausted all the little notes I write down to refresh my mind to a place or feeling that would inspire a direction, but instead to have to find the idea, find the melody, find the chords, to find the rhythm from scratch, I started coming up with pure melodies that evoke some of my favorite vibes from the decades of rock n roll and pop history running through my consciousness! There was no plan, no motive just pure music. I surprised myself and it has made me yet more confident in my ability to write a good song!\n\nYou’ve heard and seen little clips I’ve shared on social media, buzzing on a song, but I promise you when you finally unpack this new LP you’re going to think it’s my best so far! I hope so, one wouldn’t want to go backwards!\n\nSo, I am starting to add the math up, get everyone’s schedules and start to fit the next bit together!\n\nTHE RECORDING!!!!!!!\n\nJames Sclavunos once again is my trusty companion in this and we are talking to Jesse Nichols who engineered on The Price Of The Ticket. We are considering the geography of where everyone lives as well as their work commitments and we are looking at various studios across London, Paris, New York and Berkeley CA.\n\nTHE ART!!!!!!!\n\nYou now can see the main image that all the art campaign will derive from… I think it’s heaven and oh how good is it going to look on a T-shirt!!!\n\nOn my Pledge Music site I can now move full speed ahead with T-shirt and Poster sales because we have the graphic we’ll use and you can start deciding which other extras you might want to take part in or buy as the full compliment of items available becomes that much closer to realization!\n\nTo Pre-order and Buy click here\n\nAs soon as I have the musician line-up and the recording schedule and locations I will announce them and then of course once we’re in the studio I will update you with little musical and video nuggets and we can organize the invitations to visit!\n\nBuy Studio Visit Pledge click here\n\nYou can see just a glimpse of how much and how many details go toward recording an album and I am so happy and excited to share it with you!!!\n\nAs always\n\nMuch love and thank you\n\nWendy xoxoxo\n\nCLICK HERE TO PLEDGE\n\nI’m half way through writing my next LP and this time, unlike ’The Price Of The Ticket’ where the record was already finished, this time my pledge campaign will take part in all the stages of making this record: From the writing, to the recording, to the mixing, to the mastering to the artwork and videos and finally a finished album! I will announce the title, the track listing, the band members and other all-important details! Along the way there will be the opportunity for studio visits, playback listening parties, live shows playing the new material, test pressings, original artwork, q&a live broadcasts and a certificate of contributors for those who would like their name included in the credits! The album is going come out on Regular CD, Deluxe CD with outtakes and bonus tracks, a Double Gatefold Vinyl containing all tracks and of course a Digital Download and I am certain there will be additional things I haven’t even anticipated yet! So… there is a lot of work to do! but it is all possible!\n\nAll the items that were still available from ‘The Price Of The Ticket’ campaign have moved onto this site, including the Picture Disc Vinyl individually numbered and signed within the vinyl itself. ‘The Price Of The Ticket’ continues to grow in reputation and I think there are even a few copies of my previous album ‘I Came Here To Blow Minds’ on CD and Vinyl too!\n\nThere is a lot here! So!\n\n– As it has been said:\n\n“Danceable art punk rhythm and blues, full of breathless New Wave rush. Razor sharp lyrics. Bare soul with beautiful harmony. An adrenaline fueled sound reminiscent of the Velvets or even a young Bobby D. The perfect cocktail of dirty blues and punk attitude. Sweet soul, arousing the lowdown groove that sparks the impressive and sensual sensation of Wendy James. Riffing garage pop/rock sliding. Seductive New Wave serenading. Quality boom and bap. Essential underground for your ears. Wendy James is for dancing like a jive-assed motherfucker. Every Song Is Dope”\n\n“This is where it Counts. More Rock ‘N’ Roll, not one ounce of Fat or Bullshit on It!”\n\nThank you! and Much Love, Wendy\n\nCLICK HERE TO PLEDGE\n\nRecollection and onwards…\n\nA year ago today (19th February 2016) THE PRICE OF THE TICKET was released and entered the UK charts at No.15! THANK YOU to ALL of you who supported and loved this album! It was such a trip this album took!\n\nFrom my bedroom in NYC writing the songs, demoing them up, meeting with James Williamson (The Stooges guitarist – Raw Power) and deciding to start recording with him and getting the wonderful James Sclavunos (Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds) on drums. Jim (in his finest three-piece suit!) and I flew to Berkeley, CA and checked into a hookers roadside motel with nothing but a 4 channel TV screwed into the mustard wall, a plastic cup for a toothbrush, an ancient shower and an ice-machine in the forecourt! We rendezvous’d with James Williamson in the parking lot and made our way to Fantasy Recording Studios where we were joined by the legendary saxophonist from Fun House by The Stooges Steve Mackay (R.I.P.) and our great engineer Jesse Nichols. After this, back in NYC, the album progressed yet further and Lenny Kaye (The Patti Smith Group) came on board as the guitarist for the body of the album and of course my dear friend Glen Matlock (Sex Pistols) on bass.\n\nHow wonderful we all felt as we recorded! It was the depths of winter in New York City and distinctly I remember being up and out on Broadway at 8am each morning, through feets-high snow making my way to the East Village and, in part, Brooklyn to record with Ivan Julian (Richard Hell & The Voidoids) engineering… it was freezing! sub-zero icy blasts tearing through the grid system of New York streets, I was bundled with my guitar, bags full of pedals and leads and mix notes and lyrics! Head down against the freezing air. Dressed in the studio in sweaters, two coats, a hat, gloves and holding onto an old portable iron radiator to try and unfreeze my hands! We worked long hours and inspired each other from start to finish. It was a wonderful musical time… I am so grateful to all these musicians for this experience in my life! I am also so grateful to my friends who helped me get through times when reaching the finishing line seemed nearly impossible! but I got there and much in part to their support and help. I am lucky!\n\nI flew back to Berkeley to mix with Jesse and once again my routine turned the clock inside out, up at 7am for coffee, walking to the studio through the pretty, sleepy streets of Berkeley with the pastel painted houses and front garden flower beds, starting to mix at 10am and finishing at midnight, getting a couple of beers from the 24 hour deli and back to the house I was staying in to make notes for the next day. As always in the studio, no matter how much time you have you never have enough and in the end Jesse and I pulled mammoth hours, we mixed two songs through the night on one occasion with Jesse going for a walk around the block at 3am to clear his ears and me just lying on the floor staring at the ceiling! We felt we were on a mission and we saw that mission completed and to success!\n\nThen!!! Pledge Music came into my life and we started this adventure that has proven so perfect for my music, for me, for you! I work closely with a team at Pledge, helped by so many people within this empire that Malcom Dunbar is building, in particular Barney, Luke, Paula and now Anna… my team! Thank you! I must also mention and thank Randy Boyd out there in California who has distributed my music across the world for quite a few years now, he is such a constant figure of reliability in my life and honest as the day is long and Ian J. Taylor with whom I built my website and who works tirelessly on keeping it up to the moment. I did the photograph for the album cover in Paris on a Sunday morning with my friend Kym Ellery, I’d just flown in from NYC and caught a taxi direct from Charles de Gaulle to Kym’s apartment on the Rue de Rivoli and we had coffee, caught up and then I lay down on her sofa and she got the snap! The rest is history… THE PRICE OF THE TICKET came out and you all embraced it! We gigged, the live band incorporating James Meynell, Jared Fisher, Louis Elliot, Bob Wilson and Richey Rose with James Sclavunos and myself. I met a lot of you, we all bonded I think and we made a firm foundation for 2017 and beyond! It continues! I’ve rounded out the 2016 campaign by commissioning a picture disc of TPOTT, signed and numbered individually, a proper collectors item.\n\nIn a few days time I will be drawing a line under THE PRICE OF THE TICKET Pledge Campaign and re-opening THE WENDY JAMES NEW ALBUM 2017 campaign! Everything from TPOTT will carry over into the new campaign but it’s coming back bigger and better and more to find than ever and this time the campaign will follow through the whole process of the new album. I am on song 6 in my writing and I hope to have an album’s worth by April, then… gather musicians, book recording studios, and we’re off to the races again! I love you all! THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU GIVE ME. It is love, it is friendship, it is generosity and it is loyalty. I hope I prove myself worthy of you all…\n\nLove and my best regards to you all, Wendy xxxx\n\nPLEDGE UPDATE READ HERE:\n\nTHE PRICE OF THE TICKET BUY HERE:\n\nIt’s been an amazing year for Wendy’s new LP ‘THE PRICE OF THE TICKET’.

Detailing a time when she lived in the then broken down Gramercy Park Hotel in Lower Manhattan and lived wide-eyed every moment, seeking out the sites of Andy Warhol’s Factory, Max’s Kansas City, The Bowery, CBGB, mixing with denizens of Lower Manhattan, Graffiti Artists, Downtown Musicians, Painters, Writers and imagining one of her all time female icon Edie Sedgwick, Andy Warhol’s delectable superstar, walking the same streets… through to a more philosophical third verse whereupon she quotes notable moments in history and the great American author Mark Twain, she suggests the force of energy to create and make progress is innate within us, whatever period of time you are born into and whatever mode of communication you choose: music, science, art, letters, politics and it is an unstoppable and wondrous energy.\n\nWendy has said of her time: “I went to NYC and walked down 5th Avenue and 57th street, onto Madison, onto Lexington, down to Union Square, down to The Bowery, down to Chinatown, down to Wall Street, I knew I’d be back to live. I wanted the wide avenues, I wanted the tall skyscrapers, I wanted the neon signs, I wanted Times Square, I wanted the Brooklyn Bridge and the Williamsburg Bridge and the Mid-Town Tunnel, I wanted the Gramercy Park Hotel, I wanted the Chelsea Hotel, I wanted CBGB, I wanted Max’s Kansas City, I wanted The Factory, I wanted the 5 Points, I wanted Canal Street, I wanted Washington Square Park, I wanted Greenwich Village, I wanted the East Village, I wanted Chelsea, I wanted Hells Kitchen, I wanted Chinatown, I wanted it all!!! I wanted the subways, I wanted the 24 hour deli’s, I wanted the yellow taxis, I wanted the Puerto Ricans, I wanted the Koreans, I wanted the Upper East Side, I wanted the Frick, I wanted The Met, The Guggenheim, I wanted Central Park, I wanted the Robber Barons, I wanted the dive bars, I wanted the cop cars, I wanted the sirens, I wanted the West-Side Highway, I wanted the East River, I wanted the elevators, I wanted Gloria Steinem, I wanted Doris Kearns Goodwin, I wanted Joan Didion, I wanted Abraham Lincoln, I wanted civil rights, I wanted black power, I wanted female liberation, I wanted cable tv, I wanted the movies, I wanted the delivery guys, I wanted the cable guys, I wanted the superintendents, I wanted it ALL. I wanted Hank Williams and Gene Vincent and Buddy Holly and The Killer, I wanted Bob Dylan, I wanted Altamont, I wanted Woodstock, I wanted Chess and Checker Records, I wanted the Sunset Strip, I wanted the Holiday Inn, I wanted the Four Seasons, I wanted it ALL. I wanted Robert Rauschenberg, I wanted Jackson Pollock, I wanted Frank Stella, I wanted Andy Warhol, I wanted Keith Haring, I wanted Graffiti. I wanted Mark Twain, I wanted Hunter Thompson, I wanted Elia Kazan, I wanted Arthur Miller, I wanted Marlon Brando, I wanted On The Waterfront, I wanted Martin Scorsese, I wanted Francis Ford Coppola, I wanted Peter Bogdanovich, I wanted John Ford, I wanted Nicholas Ray, I wanted Robert Frank’s The Americans and Robert Frank’s Cocksucker Blues, I wanted Grey Gardens, I wanted JFK and La Guardia, I wanted it ALL!”\n\nThe title is in honor of the legendary rock journalist for Creem and Rolling Stone Magazine, author LESTER BANGS (Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung).\n\nLYRICS:\n\nI was lying on my bed\n\nI just lay there\n\nWith New Wave rockers and Graffiti\n\nAnd music and kicks in Gramercy\n\nIt was a scene, those endless nights\n\nI traced my melancholy\n\nI saw it was a trap\n\nI just wanted to play music\n\nIt was a magic thing, that thrill that I got\n\nI was very happy\n\nTrue love and anguish\n\nI don’t know quite what it is\n\nHe said “Darlin’, I just don’t get ya”\n\nI said “You’re a Dirtbomb, Lester”\n\nThat love was there\n\nWhen the foundations of Rome were laid\n\nWhen Christ was crucified\n\nWhen the Conquerer created the British Isles\n\nWhen Columbus sailed\n\nWhen the massacre at Lexington was news\n\n(Credit M. Twain)\n\nTrue love and anguish\n\nI don’t know quite what it is\n\nHe said “Darlin’, I just don’t get ya”\n\nI said “You’re a Dirtbomb, Lester”\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nWendy James – Vocals/Rhythm Guitar/Piano & Keys\n\nLenny Kaye – Rhythm and Lead Guitar\n\nGlen Matlock – Bass Guitar\n\nJames Sclavunos – Drums\n\nProduced by Wendy James\n\nMixed by Wendy James and Jesse Nichols at Fantasy Recording Studios, Berkeley, CA.

Unauthorized Duplication is a violation of all applicable laws.\n\nTrack Time: 6’.38”\n\nAA side:\n\nFAREWELL TO LOVE\n\nWendy’s end-of-the-line cowboy ballad for the finish of a love affair, so delicately and beautifully presented! She says: “I’m a harmony and backing vocal girl. I love harmonies and backing vocals and I love when my voice sings to my voice: the texture blends and becomes very full, very pure. Whether it’s Bacharach and David (all their wonderful songs with Dionne Warwick) especially so their original soundtrack for the movie ‘Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid’, in particular ‘South American Getaway’ or Keith Richards in his song ‘All About You’ on The Rolling Stones album ‘Emotional Rescue’ and on my song ‘Farewell To Love’, the harmonies evoke June Carter Cash and The Carter Family, Loretta Lynn, and Patsy Cline. Lenny Kaye plays the most wonderful (chorus echo) guitar melody in answer to my rhythm guitar, weaving in and out with simplicity and precision, he has the perfect touch. I’ve mixed Glen Matlock’s bass up loud on this song, it sounds like he’s in his own skin, so easy, so effortless, it sounds like he’s enjoying every note! I watched him across the live room as we tracked it and he was just bobbing along, eyes closed, really in a good place! James Sclavunos drumming, as always, he conducts us and makes the song groove and soar high. I overdubbed a delicate Wurlitzer piano part echoing Lenny’s guitar melody line. That’s all it is, it doesn’t need a single thing more. Lyrically it’s “get-out-of-town!”. The waste of time listening to someone go round in circles under the impression they’re saying something different to every time they’ve said the same thing before. When it’s done, it’s done and you can’t buy back character at the end.”\n\nLYRICS:\n\nTake your belongings\n\nAnd get out before dark\n\nI guess you can’t help\n\nBeing what you are\n\nYou just hang on\n\nTo what you got\n\nBut you can say\n\nFarewell To Love\n\nYou came here\n\nFor absolution\n\nYou’d like to be set free\n\nFor what you’ve done\n\nYou think punishment\n\nWill set you free\n\nThat’s why you’ve come\n\nFarewell To Love\n\nGood Luck, Fool\n\nNothing’s true\n\nIn your cock-eyed world\n\nYou can’t buy back your life when it’s finished\n\nYou wanna know something honey\n\nI’m gonna busy myself elsewhere\n\nWhen you’re belly-empty, hollow-hungry\n\nDon’t come see me all dreamy with temperature\n\nAin’t no in-between\n\nListenin’ to you come clean\n\nThat time is done\n\nFarewell To Love\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nWendy James – Vocals/Rhythm Guitar/Piano & Keys\n\nLenny Kaye – Rhythm and Lead Guitar\n\nGlen Matlock – Bass Guitar\n\nJames Sclavunos – Drums\n\nProduced by Wendy James\n\nMixed by Wendy James and Jesse Nichols at Fantasy Recording Studios, Berkeley, CA.
