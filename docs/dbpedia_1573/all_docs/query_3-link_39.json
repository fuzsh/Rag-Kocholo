You'll see how to tap into specific hopes that help you take effective action when you can, and help you wait when there's nothing more you can do. Your focus on healing hope helps you get good care and live as fully as possible today, tomorrow and every day.\n\nHappiness in a Storm Practical philosophy and science-based knowledge help you get good care and find some happiness while dealing with a medical challenge. You’ll learn how to set the stage for the miracle of physical healing by (1) obtaining sound knowledge, (2) nourishing realistic hope and (3) taking effective action.\n\nWhen a Parent Has Cancer with Becky and the Worry Cup Awarded the 2006 Consumer Book Award by the American Journal of Nursing, this book set combines a book for adults with an illustrated children's book. Together, they offer information, advice and inspiration for dealing with the many issues that arise when a parent (or other important adult in the life of a child) is ill.\n\nAfter Cancer This reader-friendly guide helps you through the medical, emotional and practical issues that arise during the months and years following completion of cancer treatment. Written in a clear and concise question-and-answer format, After Cancer guides you to good follow-up care and helps you create a \"new normal\" that is the best it can be—in certain ways, even better than before.\n\nDiagnosis: Cancer This classic work has helped tens of thousands of cancer patients and their families through the challenges of diagnosis, evaluation and treatment. The third edition includes “Harpham’s Decision Tool,” a unique chart for helping you decide on your best course of treatment. This book educates and inspires people who are dealing with a new diagnosis—a first-time cancer diagnosis or a recurrence, as well as those who are in the middle of treatment.\n\nOnly 10 Seconds to Care Engaging and inspiring short stories encourage you to think and talk about everyday problems in patient care. Patients benefit from a rare view of the challenges that their healthcare team faces when providing expert and compassionate care. Clinicians benefit from an inside view of the struggles of their patients.\n\nMY KIND - SELF TALK\n\nONCOLOGY TIMES\n\nSince 2005, Dr. Harpham has been writing the popular column, “View from the Other Side of the Stethoscope,” for Oncology Times. Her column received a 2024 Award of Excellence from APEX (Awards for Publishing Excellence). It was the winner of the coveted 2016 Eddie award for a regular column. In 2007 and 2015 the \"View\" column received the Silver Medal from American Society of Healthcare Publications for “Regular Column-contributed.”\n\nIn most columns, Dr. Harpham grapples with one common dilemma of patient care, offering insight into the dynamics behind the problems and concluding with healing words for patients. Occasional columns are devoted to patient handouts.\n\nFor select titles and links, click here. For a complete listing, click here.\n\nOTHER ARTICLES\n\nHope Springs Eternal—Or Does It?
