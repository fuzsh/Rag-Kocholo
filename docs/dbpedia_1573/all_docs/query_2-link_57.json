        "text": "Wendy Holden was a respected journalist and war correspondent for eighteen years covering news stories around the world, including the Middle East, the USA, and Eastern Europe. She is the author of three novels and more than thirty non-fiction titles, most of which feature inspirational people and many of them international bestsellers. They include Born Survivors, the story of three mothers who hid their pregnancies from the Nazis; Tomorrow to Be Brave about the only woman in the French Foreign Legion, soon to be a film; One Hundred Miracles about a musical prodigy who survived three concentration camps, and Behind Enemy Lines featuring a French Jewish spy, now an award-winning documentary.\n\nWendy’s first novel The Sense of Paper was published by Random House, New York. Her second, The Cruelty of Beauty, is published in Europe and is to be made into a TV film. She also wrote Mr Scraps, a novella about the first search and rescue dog in the London Blitz. She lives on a small farm in Suffolk, England, with her husband and two dogs.\n\nwww.wendyholden.com"
