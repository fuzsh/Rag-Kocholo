        "text": "I read this one on holiday and had to write up my review quickly as Matthew wanted to read the book without the post-it tabs so apologies for posting a review of a book that is neither a novella nor a nonfiction book in November! This is another book that everyone else seems to have read, both bloggers (like with “Legends and Lattes“) and non-bloggers. I’ve seen near-universal liking, with a few meh reviews, and I have to say I join the ranks of liking very much indeed. I bought this in August when I spotted it in The Works and I have actually now read and reviewed four of the seven print books I bought that month!\n\nGabrielle Zevin – “Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow”\n\n(25 August 2023, The Works)\n\nHe was tired of having to move so carefully, of having to be so careful. He wanted to be able to skip, for God’s sake. He wanted to be Ichigo [the character in the game they’ve built]. He wanted to surf, and ski, and parasail, and fly, and scale mountains and buildings. He wanted to die a million deaths like Ichigo, and no matter what damage was inflicted on his body during the day, he’d wake up tomorrow, new and whole. He wanted Ichigo’s life, a lifetime of endless, immaculate tomorrows, free of mistakes and the evidence of having lived. (p, 143)\n\nWhile I have never been much of a gamer, I’ve been in circles that do game and I really like a tech book, fiction or non-fiction, so I was fairly confident I’d cope OK with this novel about two childhood friends who re-encounter one another at college and write a game together. It’s a novel about love and friendship where friendship is more important than love, or a strong form of love, and I really liked that the central and best game coder is a woman, Sadie, although we are given more background information on and the author seems to love the character of Sam/Mazer best (I had other allegiances).\n\nWe start with Sadie and Sam re-meeting at college then get the story of their meeting and initial friendship, then we proceed fairly conventionally through their setting up a company and trying to write more games alongside another collegemate and input from a creepy older academic (when Sam sees them through his eyes, oh, goodness!), with steps back into Sam’s past and a very interesting long chapter near the end spent in an actual game (I was confused by then loved this bit).\n\nIt’s such a clever book – characters are seen through other characters’ eyes, metafictional quotations and interviews are used to good effect, There’s a chapter structured to reflect something they are working on at the time, and there are clever plot moments and intelligent twists and comments – but also an emotional one – I literally laughed out loud at a couple of points and actually cried (in a hotel snack bar one warm afternoon). The last time a book made me cry was only a month or so ago but I did have Covid then. I also loved the diversity of the characters, in terms of backgrounds and sexualities, very nicely done and integral but not clunky.\n\nThere is one odd bit where Sam thinks a triangle of dots with the single one at the bottom means “Therefore” but later Sadie knows it means “Because” – can anyone shed any light on that?\n\nI know I’m primed to see my favourite author in all other books but it doesn’t happen very often. I can’t find anything with Zevin saying she was influenced by Iris Murdoch, but there are so many Murdochian features in the book – college friends followed down the years, the facilitator and the active characters, doublings and triplings of motifs, a couple with almost the names of a Murdoch couple who are strong and remain strong, the discovery and frequent use of a peculiar word (bloviating recalling IM’s use of rebarbative in “The Bell”), the referencing back to Shakespeare, including Hamlet, through the book and the title. Maybe I am inventing this, but it seemed to jump out at me.\n\nAnyway, a wonderful book that is staying with me and that I think will be one of my top books of the year."
