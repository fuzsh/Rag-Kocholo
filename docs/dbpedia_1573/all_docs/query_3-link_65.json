        "text": "April 13, 2021\n\nInteresting story\n\nParts of this story were quite interesting but there was too much description of the daily chores. It became repetitious and lowered the tone. The dialogue was often quite good. There was a bit too much telling and not showing. Apart from the mother, all of the other characters were one-dimensional. Even Maggie came across as dull and self-effacing, always trying to be a \"good girl\" and avoid providing fodder for the gossipers.\n\nThe ending was too rushed and needed more time spent with Tom helping Maggie to understand her growing feelings for him. Instead the ending was quite choppy. Maggie seemed at times intelligent, then at others incredibly naive. In such a small town, with so much gossip, she should have clued in to all of Victor and Ben's shenanigans. This book is set in the Depression era so the attitude to indigenous people was probably accurately portrayed, as well as the town's callous disregard for starving children in their midst. I could have wished for more of a story line about those little girls, as opposed to the endless repetition of all of Maggie's plans for cleaning, washing and cooking, which came across as mindless filler. Why spend so much time revisiting chores when the author could have fleshed out all the other characters in this story - especially those two young children?\n\nThat said, I did want to finish to the end, so I was invested in Tom and Maggie's relationship. I'm not even marking this as a spoiler because it was obvious from the first chapter where this was going to end.\n\nApril 13, 2022\n\nI'm slowly getting caught up with writing reviews. Hopefully I will have one posted for this book in the next week or so.\n\nJanuary 18, 2018\n\nWow! It is not often I am left reeling at the humbling beauty that is the ending of this book. I am still living in that ending and quite frankly I never want it to leave me.\n\nI will however just briefly return to the start of the book. I was surprised at the use of commas and even semicolons. A recent bugbear of mine is the never ending supply of poorly written books, with grammar so bad I have given up reading before the end because it is too much of a struggle to work out what the sentences mean so I applaud Wendy Fraser on using full grammar. Despite the grammar the prologue resonated with me as something that was written with literary techniques in mind yet by chapter two I could feel the author relax and enjoy the writing experience. This relaxed natural writing continued throughout the book and kept me enthralled.\n\nThere are a couple of big moments throughout the story but for me it was touching on Native children and how they lived alongside but were viewed negatively by some of the townspeople. Personally I would love to see more of the Natives lives in books but am thrilled they got a mention in Beside the River.\n\nTom as a protagonist had me intrigued from the start and I was longing for more information on his background, which just made me read more (it's okay I should be used to books replacing sleep, yet I fear the worst book hangover of my life tomorrow after finishing this book).\n\nI feared for the happy ending I longed for happened in a humbly down to earth yet deeply fairy-tale esque manner. The beautiful serendipitous ending left my heart bursting with pride in Maggie but also buoying my soul with hope and a sense of peace that there are people both male and female who see a person for who they are with no boundaries instead of the difficulties of a disability .\n\nThis book reaches across the divide of social class, of perfection and imperfection, extending the hand of kinship, friendship, love and pervades the body and soul making it a first class feel good novel that you won't ever want to put down. As tempting as it is to start re-reading this book I am going to settle on searching online to see if the author has written anything else because this is an author to watch and return to like an old favourite comfort blanket...a good easy to read style writing that makes me happy.\n\nOctober 6, 2019\n\nThis was a heart felt tale tale about a girl in her late teens living in the 1930s in a small town. I purchased it as a diversion from life and it isn’t really my genre although it delivers an interesting story of financial struggles,love and loss. The characters development was good and the story rang true. I was very happy I came across this jam and would definitely recommend it.\n\nNovember 16, 2019\n\nI absolutely loved reading your book Wendy!!\n\nI haven't read a book in over seven years, and you brought the characters to life for me, I felt a real connection to Maggie, the book was set in Mission BC in the 1930's, She mentions Abbotsford and the Harrison hotel, so close to home. I recommend this book and I sincerely hope there is one to follow this with the same characters and perhaps new ones. Thank you for getting me into Books again Wendy. You're a great writer.\n\nOctober 16, 2019\n\nThis is a great novel! Very entertaining with a satisfying ending. I loved the gritty 1930's vibe along with the interesting characters. Both Victor and Louisa were nasty, and the kind you love to hate. I looked around for another Wendy Fraser novel and didn't find any, but will keep my eyes open.\n\nJuly 21, 2018\n\nUnique 1930 period read in a small town of gossips. I liked the time travel and all of the characters and wanted to go to Mission BC and hav a look around after reading this. I loved the descriptions the characters and their quirks. And the 3 men show interest in Maggie Hanson. The story had an unusual and wonderful outcome that satisfied. I couldn’t put it down once I’d started it and feel I may read it again.\n\nJanuary 3, 2018\n\nGreat read! Explicit writing. Some very naughty and naive characters made this book so fun the read. Loved the description of the town, felt like i was there watching all that was going on. thank you Author Wendy!\n\nOctober 23, 2019\n\nWhat a joy it was to read this book. A great one to take on a trip where you’ll have time to kick back and immerse yourself in it. The colourful characters feel like friends so it’s hard to say goodbye at the end. Watching and waiting for the sequel!\n\nOctober 21, 2019\n\nCongratulations on publishing your first novel, Wendy! This is a fictional story Wendy wrote about small town life along the Fraser River during the 1930's.\n\nJune 20, 2021\n\nGreat book, and a real page Turner. I highly recommend this book\n\nRead\n\nJanuary 8, 2023\n\nWendy Fraser's book was a joy to read. Richly developed characters in a small British Columbia town. Mrs. Fraser is a wonderful story teller. I would recommend this book to anyone.\n\nDecember 8, 2019\n\nI read this book a little while ago but I'm new to good reads so just getting to this now. This historical fiction is a charming read. I really loved the setting and the character descriptions, especially Victor Robertson! Just looking through the other reviews here I see this is a Debut novel by Wendy Fraser and it couldn't have been a more enjoyable read. Five stars\n\nOctober 16, 2019\n\nI really liked this small town historical romance. It had a great story and characters and there were a few spicy love scenes that made me blush. I liked Maggie’s cheeky mum and the setting. The ending was my favourite and I would never have guessed which man she would have chosen near he beginning. I would say 4 and a half stars.\n\nOctober 19, 2019\n\nWhat an intriguing book! I loved this 1930s story and all the characters, they were so unique. I liked the little town too but I hated nasty Louisa and her nasty ways.\n\nI don’t want to give the story away, but Maggie was a nice sort of girl next door and certainly didn’t know her way around young men. The story had a fantastic ending and I thought about this book long after I read it.\n\nOctober 23, 2019\n\nA friend recommended this book and I am so glad she did. The author has a great imagination and this is well worth reading for its strong characters and magnificent descriptions, this book is hard to put down, I’m looking forward to more!\n\nApril 9, 2021\n\nI loved every page of this novel, and felt I was right there with the colourful characters.\n\nGood story, good characters and interesting era. I look forward to your next novel! Wanted to give 4.5 ⭐️\n\nOctober 27, 2019\n\nThis book was a lovely surprise. I didnt know what to expect from a new local author of Beside The River, but it was good. The storyline was interesting with a little of everything and the characters were well rounded, so that I could literally see them.\n\nIt was written with alternating points of view, which I like. As a fictional story steeped with facts and history it was a satisfying novel with a great ending.\n\nWaiting for another book from this author, a sequel possibly.\n\nOctober 6, 2019\n\nWhat an engaging small town story! I loved the characters, Victor I could literally see. And Tom with his magnetism and charisma too. Poor Maggie such a wholesome and innocent young thing, on the edge of becoming a woman. The post war story with was very entertaining and I will watch for your name and hope you write more. I couldn’t help but give 5 stars.\n\nDecember 22, 2022\n\nWendy Fraser truly has a way of writing that takes you from reality directly into her books. Beautifully written. Highly recommended.\n\nDecember 19, 2022\n\nI really enjoyed this book and can't wait to read the sequel.\n\nNovember 10, 2019\n\nThis was one of the best books I read this year. It had a great setting, a sort of small town USA feeling. And I enjoyed the references to that time during the dirty thirties with WW2 around the corner. with good characters with authentic voices.\n\nIt’s a plesant character driver read with all the human emotions, love, jealousy,shame, lust,,,\n\nThis is a wonderful story and especially as a debut.\n\nNovember 16, 2019\n\nI have noticed that other authors review their books and then this is my debut review\n\n...The story takes place during the Great Depression ( dirty thirties ) pre WW2, and the small Canadian riverside town is struggling.\n\nMaggie resides with her English mum, and they do what they can to get by.\n\nThere are 3 men who have intentions where Maggie is concerned, one of them her boyfriend who is away at medical school. The other two have intentions she isn’t aware of until later.\n\nThis story is gritty, and scandalous and the town enjoys airing others dirty laundry.\n\n#Historical romance #coming of age #Canadian Author #1930s novel\n\nMarch 3, 2022\n\nI didn’t realize that that I had read the sequel to this story.\n\nI mistakenly read All Of The Colourful Seasons first, it’s a perfect stand alone as advertised.\n\nAfter reading this I understand the back ground for the second novel better.\n\nBeside The River is a wonderful story of a young girl living alone with her mum in a gossipy backwater town, where dreams are all the people have. Maggi and Ben are going steady but as life goes on changes come. Each story seems to have a villain or two and Victor and Louisa are the ones that we love to hate in this story.\n\nI fell in love with Tom but also loved Maggie’s funny English mum I enjoyed all the historic mentions, and live across the river and 5 miles from this town, not that’s its anything like it may have been back in the 1930s, yet I can definitely see the old character when I look around on Main Street."
