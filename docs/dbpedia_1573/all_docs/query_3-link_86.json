        "text": "Book Reviews (8)\n\nAdd a Rating\n\n4 years ago\n\nThis is a book written by the author Wendy Mass. This book is really different than any other book you may have read, becuase the format is very different. In this book, it follows Josie, a girl who is about to turn 16... well really 4, since she was born on Leap Day and her birthday only rolls around every 4 years.This book follows her through her 16th birthday, but also tells different parts of the story from all different perspectives. Read the book to find out more! Happy Reading!\n\n6 years ago\n\nThis book is amazing! I would really recomend this book because it has great details and all amazing things. This book is about a girl and her friend. They were born on the same day. Their was a lady there that made a spell to make them become friends and always celebrate their birthday together. If they didnt celebrate their birthday together, then they woul be trapped in a universe where the day starts over and over again. The only way to have their life back to normal, is to celebrate their birthday with each other again. will their life go back to normal? will everything be ok? find out in the book, \"11 Birthdays\"\n\n10 years ago\n\nReally great! Not for younger kids though, kind of a tween book.\n\n11 years ago\n\nDefinitely for ages 13 and over, was good though\n\n11 years ago\n\nWant to read it\n\n11 years ago\n\nI also read it in a day. Very good, just not my favorite.\n\n11 years ago\n\nLove Wendy Mass to pieces. She writes with such heart that you feel like you are in the book. I absolutely adore her and you should DEFINATLY read it."
