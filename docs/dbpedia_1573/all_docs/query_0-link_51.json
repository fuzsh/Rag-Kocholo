Although Masako, her daughter Kikuko, and her two sons managed to survive, her soldier husband was not so fortunate. For fifty years, Masako never spoke of the horrors she had witnessed; then at last, she began to open up about her experiences. Kikuko has transformed Masako's words into unforgettable verse. Masako's Story vividly conveys the gut-wrenching impact of indescribable tragedy and horror suffering in the wake of an atomic bomb attack. \"The blood clung to your hair / Pasting it to your skulls and streaking your faces, / So that you, daughter, looked like Oiwa-san. [a Japanese ghost woman] / The white dress you wore was filthy and tattered, / And dyed ghastly red by the blood. // I searched for more bandages. / But there were no more... / I could do nothing... but watch my children bleed.\" A handful of black-and-white photographs illustrate this elegy of grief, suffering, and speaking out against the horrors of nuclear weapons. Masako's Story is an impassioned call to remember the immense suffering such weapons bring, exhorting that readers never forget the devastation wreaked on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and never allow another use of these weapons of death.

Kelly\n\nRiver's Edge Press\n\nc/o Amazon Digital Publishing\n\n0780615644066 $2.99 www.authorjckelly.com\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Oil-Slave-ebook/dp/B008Q53RZG/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1343481500&sr=1-1&keywords=Oil+Slave\n\nWhat happens when the world runs out of cheap oil?\n\nThis question has been reviewed in many nonfiction titles that construct \"what if\" scenarios and many a fiction apocalyptic novel; but few are as powerfully rendered as OIL SLAVE, which begins with a bang and proves impossible to put down: \"Last night, the sun went down on our way of life. It sank into the hills, and the scorched hills whimpered as the thieves came out to loot.\"\n\nThe protagonist immersed in chaos is one Valerie Pushem, who has been drafted into a new military unit and is protected by her government status as she travels around a changed America on assignments that eventually lead her to realize her government's real intentions during the crisis.\n\nResource shortages are changing the nation with prolonged blackouts leading to chaos and disruption and increasing government involvement in regulating and protecting citizen lives. Valerie enjoys the return to simplicity and likes being forced out of routines - but is one of the first to be called into federal service as a Special Charge Police officer; there to represent the government and help keep peace and enforce security.\n\nIn the course of her duties she uncovers a deeper threat: one to the values of equality and liberty that once made America strong, and which have eroded along with the oil reserves that once powered a free nation. As she reveals thinning lines between slavery and work and fair treatment and forced labor for a greater good, Valerie finds her initial ideals and appreciation of a simpler life are unfounded, and becomes even more uneasy with her role working for the government's SCPO unit.\n\nHer search for rebel hideouts bears fruit, but also reveals an underlying reality to the energy crisis that threatens the entire democratic system she holds dear.\n\nUltimately her attraction to the military, to government purposes and perspectives, and to her own sense of loyalty and duty are called into question: \"If the lights were to go out permanently, I would not be erased from existence. These old-fashioned practices of the military continued to appeal to me as I liked the simplicity of papers and pens and the reek of history...Joe and I were made to be soldiers. In order to fulfill our roles we had to set aside compassion and focus on our missions. But then they changed the rules of the game and redefined what it was to be a worthy human.\"\n\nIn striking contrast to other apocalyptic novels about the end of resources, OIL SLAVE is largely about changes and challenges to freedom, social change, morals and ethics, and government versus personal interests. Any looking for more than a simple survival account will find OIL SLAVE a solid pick: vivid, exciting, and packed with moral and political reflection lacking in most competing apocalyptic novels.\n\nFive Versus Five\n\nJodie Sankey\n\nCreateSpace\n\n100 Enterprise Way, Suite A200\n\nScotts Valley, CA 95066\n\nwww.createspace.com\n\n9781477465899 $9.99 www.amazon.com\n\nIn 1990 a government experiment with a clandestine drug fails, and all participants are eliminated. Except for one. Amy is sixteen and a normal teen in most respects; but when she enters a competition with one million pounds going to the winner, a latent power is uncovered that will change her life and test the boundaries of friendship, ethics, morality and survival.\n\nFive Versus Five is reminiscent of The Hunger Games, in that competition becomes linked to survival. It's also about a girl's blossoming powers, stormy emotions, and how these feelings tie in to a more insidious underlying ability that is blossoming within her.\n\nThe first chapters are replete with typical teen angst: Amy has a bone to pick with just about everyone, is prone to flying off the handle, and experiences the usual emotional problems with just about everyone in her life - with a difference. A dark voice within her is prompting her to violence, and is winning. As Amy begins to respond to confrontation with an almost inhuman strength and innate fighting instinct, she slowly comes to acknowledge that her blackouts, the voices in her head, and her impossible reactions to fighting are beyond the norm.\n\nSoon Amy finds her own father and close associates are involved in a truly dangerous game: a secret group of assassins have made Amy into a killer - and want her to join their purpose. Love, hate and warfare begin to mix as Amy's key relationships, from her father to Jesse, Jake, Cot, and others, all reveal underlying secrets and purposes. And a training program will either help her to control her powers or will hone them so that she becomes something dangerous and deadly.\n\nChapters packed with drama and action follow Amy into a dark world as she enters the game of her life: a game that will determine her future interests and where her latent talents will develop.\n\nRomance and violence entwine as Amy faces some of the hardest decisions of her life: decisions that will determine the course of her existence or end it.\n\nRiveting and fast-paced, FIVE VERSUS FIVE is a recommended read for young adult and adult readers alike - with the note that there are periods of graphic violence throughout, making it a pick for mature readers.\n\nOut of the Shadow\n\nJ.S. Winn\n\nAmazon Digital Publishing\n\n9781467540063 $2.99\n\nwww.authorjswinn.wordpress.com\n\nwww.amazon.com/dp/B008PYM59C\n\nAny reader interested in compelling mysteries will find OUT OF THE SHADOW a powerful read, telling of one Becca Rosen, who survives a rape and just wants to move on with life. The only trouble is: she's being stalked by a psychopath who has a different agenda for her, and the police are convinced she's faking the rape to get away with her husband's murder.\n\nDesperate, Becca hires a psychotherapist to help her handle the flashbacks and nightmares that are plaguing her - only to find that hypnotherapy is peeling back some dangerous layers of memory even as three men, new in her life, may not be as they seem.\n\nHer search for support and understanding from her mother falls short, her involvements with men seem confused and filled with possible danger, and as Becca faces her innermost fears, outward threats and perils rise to haunt her anew.\n\nBecca's realization of her childhood traumas and their affect on her adult perceptions and choices makes for a moving account that gently weaves within it a concurrent mystery revolving around Becca's husband's death and her own experiences of violence.\n\nWhen Becca's best friend Angela is threatened, Becca must pull out all stops to help her; even confronting her own repressed memories to get to the bottom of why she's become involved in a deadly game.\n\nFirst- and third-person perspectives alternate in a series of twists and turns that offer a stunning conclusion to a story replete with intrigue and deceptions.\n\nLike the layers of an onion, OUT OF THE SHADOW peels away personalities, motivations, underlying motives, and dark, long-hidden secrets that immerse a circle of people in a web of dangerous associations.\n\nThe conclusion is riveting, unexpected, and as satisfying as the rising psychological suspense which begins from the first page and ends with a bang.\n\nThe Devil Dancers\n\nT. Thurai\n\nHot Monkey Publishing\n\nASIN: B005KDFWP0 $4.90\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Devil-Dancers-ebook/dp/B005KDFWP0/ref=sr_1_1_title_1_kin?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1346552790&sr=1-1&keywords=Devil+Dancers\n\nCeylon in the mid-1950s was a pivotal time, with forces erupting that would challenge and change the country's direction, ultimately creating a 25-year civil war that would become a way of life for many. While The Devil Dancers is a historical novel about these events, it's replete with cultural and political observations grounded in fact, and will prove a rich read for any interested in complex, detailed historical accounts.\n\nBut the entire 25-year period of civil war isn't the focus: it's just the background, here. At the heart of The Devil Dancers are six main protagonists and a host of tertiary figures who move deftly in and out of each others' lives over a four-year period.\n\nFrom a Prime Minister indebted to a powerful Buddhist abbot for his political position to a former monk and revolutionary's encounter with a woman who could help him forget his past, this novel is packed with insights into the violence and conflict that are imbedded in social and political change.\n\nThe involvement and evolution of romance, spirituality, and family dynamics in the fabric of a society that is unraveling makes The Devil Dancers a multi-faceted and complex read that will demand of readers the ability to appreciate both historical setting and the mingled and changing fortunes of peoples from very different social strata.\n\nOne might anticipate from all this that The Devil Dancers would be ponderous and difficult to read: not so! From the first paragraph readers (even those unfamiliar with Ceylon history and politics) will be drawn into the landscape and flavors of the country: \"9 a.m. The sun is already at its height, the air humid and thick. In the street below, morning has erupted, an explosion of noise, colour and heat. Watched by a crowd of eager customers, a man on the pavement is cooking hoppers on a charcoal stove. The aroma of food wafts under the noses of passers-by, a humble reminder of life's pleasures. A pedlar lurches past, strings of clashing saucepans strapped to his back like fish scales. Shoppers haggle shrilly with traders; neighbours shout greetings from doorways; bicycle bells trill urgently as riders dodge pedestrians and animals. Like dragonflies, women in jewel-coloured saris dart through the crowd, hovering around market stalls before disappearing in a flash of blue or green.\"\n\nFictional characters interact freely with figures from historical record, the motivations and failings of a range of protagonists are included in descriptions filled with psychological and social insights, and T. Thurai's writing imparts information deftly in a manner that assumes no prior familiarity with Ceylonese culture or history: \"\"There are plenty of other parasites in this country: people in positions of authority, who will resist change, who want power only for themselves. That is bad for Ceylon.\"\"\n\nThe theme of a nation being slowly reborn is carried through each protagonist, who finds himself or herself reborn in the transformative process of a nation inching towards new options.\n\nEspecially notable are moment-by-moment descriptions of two ethnic groups dividing the nation, which move from political to personal circles as the Tamils and Sinhalese destroy neighbors and former friends, creating barriers of violence and uncertainty through which new relationships and friendships navigate like ships gone awry. Individuals with no political connections find even family relationships move from uncertain to dangerous: \"Using her stick as a scythe, Manju swipes at a tall arum lily, severing its head from the stem. She does not have the luxury of choosing between her children, indulging her whims as to which she finds acceptable and which not, abandoning one and favouring another. By her efforts alone, the family has stayed together. Until now.\"\n\nHow such deep wounds heal and how such deep rifts eventually result in the reunification of individuals, community and country lends to a powerful saga of love, violence, and perseverance, recommended for any lending library strong in historical fiction.\n\nInside the Beijing Olympics\n\nJeff Ruffolo\n\neBookIt.com\n\n9781456609429 $7.99\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Inside-the-Beijing-Olympics-ebook/dp/B008O7W0V8/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1346597937&sr=1-1&keywords=inside+the+beijing+olympics\n\nAuthor Jeff Ruffolo isn't just another reporter coming from 'the outside' reporting the events surrounding the Beijing Olympics: he was the only American in the senior management team of the 2008 Summer Olympics, and here provides a first-person account of his experiences and how he arrived at his unique position with the Beijing Olympic Organizing Committee from his job as an Olympic broadcaster.\n\nThere were no predecessors to follow in his journey to Beijing - and plenty of political, social and cultural barriers to field single-handedly. In fact, as explained in the introduction, Ruffolo never wanted to write this book, either. It took looming unemployment to force him to put pen to paper to write about his Beijing experiences; and once he did, the book blossomed to what you see here.\n\nThis isn't your usual scandal sheet about the Chinese, not a critical survey of their policies and politics, and not intended as a light leisure expose or read: those seeking such elements will be disappointed.\n\nInstead, it's so much more: an open, honest assessment of experiences at the Beijing Olympics and the hard-working action taking place behind the scenes, exposing routines and decisions the general public seldom hears about, even with all the front-line reporting about China and the Olympics teams.\n\nRuffolo's assessment of the Chinese people as a whole is enthusiastic, candid, and captivating: \"As the sole American given the title and position of Senior Expert for the Beijing Olympic Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad, I personally saw the greatness of the Chinese people which was clearly evident during the most majestic Olympic Games ever.\" It's also in honest, refreshing contrast to those who don't even think about China without pre-conceived notions and a critical perspective.\n\nUnlike others who have journeyed to China and then wrote about it, Ruffolo actually moved there and gave his heart and soul to interacting with the country. His enthusiasm and admiration for the Chinese people is unbridled and refreshing: \"Having first travelled here in 1999 and then moving here full time in the Spring of 2007 to work for BOCOG, I have focused my life (and this book) on the positive rather than the negative. To have this \"once in a lifetime\" position at BOCOG, I left everything behind in America to come to China and work for these Olympic Games.\"\n\nSo what events encouraged a card-carrying Republican to accept a job in China? Unemployment and opportunity led Ruffolo on an unexpected journey: \"...today through books, magazine articles or TV networks (including today's 24-hour cable news networks) the media elite in the United States constantly hammer out either an ambivalent or generally negative posture about the People's Republic. And when it came for me to make a personal decision to say either yes or no to working for the Chinese government and its largest airline, China Southern, it was an easy decision for this card-carrying Republican. I said yes in a heartbeat. I was starving.\"\n\nChapters are explicit about the process of journeying to China, preconceptions and surprises encountered once there, and provide insights on Chinese etiquette and business which will prove essential to any business reader new to interactions with the Chinese: \"Let's say that you are at a formal dinner. The Chinese always conduct business at dinner because they feel they can speak freely and relaxed away from the office. This is why the Chinese always take a walk during lunch. It is not necessarily because they want the exercise. By taking a walk outside the office, they feel free from prying eyes. That makes it nearly impossible for anyone else to listen to what someone walking down a busy city street might say. This gives the boss the freedom to talk about any subject without possible future recrimination. So, at dinner it is critical where you are seated. The boss will always take the prime seat at the table. When you approach the table, the boss will ALWAYS tell you where to sit.\"\n\nThe focus is as much on understanding the Chinese point of view as it is about the Beijing Olympics, which are the focus of explaining and celebrating China's achievements and approaches.\n\nFrom ongoing issues with security and clearance to Ruffolo's navigation of barriers to participating in the Beijing Olympics' management, this is packed with eye-opening insights, rare interactions and encounters, and accounts of journalism challenges along the way.\n\nIn short, ANY reader who would understand not just Olympics management but the cultural, media and business world processes that make up China MUST read this eye-opening account, which is as lively and engrossing as it is educational and insightful.\n\nThe Accidental Caregiver: How I Met, Loved, and Lost Legendary Holocaust Refugee Maria Altmann\n\nGregor Collins\n\nBloch-Bauer Books\n\nwww.TheAccidentalCaregiver.com\n\n9780985865405 $14.99 pbk.\n\n9780985865412 $2.99 Kindle www.amazon.com\n\nwww.TheAccidentalCaregiver.com (please be advised there is a special 'bonus video' section on site where people who buy the book will be sent free video of Maria and Gregor Collins about town.)\n\nGregor Collins spent years in reality TV and as an actor, appearing on E! Entertainment, and saw successes in his career until everything came to a sudden standstill and unemployment reared its ugly head. An acting class taken during the lull jump-started his career back up, and led him to new and unexpected adventures - especially the one recounted in his memoir THE ACCIDENTAL CAREGIVER.\n\nWhen he moved back into acting, becoming a caregiver for an old woman was the furthest thing from his mind. It was his acting friend Tom who answered a Craigslist ad to become a caregiver to an elderly European woman - and who leaned on Gregor to meet his new charge.\n\nIn January 2008 he's beginning to solidify his disillusionment with the acting industry: \"There's an emptiness inside me, a fear that nothing will ever work out and that I'll be a loser the rest of my life. The glamor in this business is a myth.\"\n\nHis friend Tom is urging him to become a part-time caregiver to his charge Maria - and so he gives in and finds himself instantly infatuated with her - and accepting the position of caregiver despite having absolutely no experience.\n\nCollins provides candid, lovely assessments that ring with honesty and vivid color: \"Her inflection and choice of words are a blend of Julia Child and Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz. When she speaks it's like a rollercoaster whipping around a track - up and down and side to side - and then her sentences always ends on this impossibly delightful up note. She's a human songbird.\"\n\nAs he gets to know his new charge he discovers this woman in her nineties holds a vivid and unparalleled account of Nazi Germany - and his caregiving duties become a journey of discovery as he delves into her life and experiences and comes up with more life meaning and insights than all his struggles with Hollywood have given him.\n\nRomance, passion, historical insights, acting world conflicts - all meld into a story of caregiving and discovery which is riveting and hard to put down: \"Ernest Hemingway said, \"Nothing good gets away.\" But how do I know if what I haven't yet achieved is what I should still be fighting for? So many questions, so little answers. But the truth is always in the now. And the now includes Maria. And that's all that matters.\"\n\nCollins' journey will take him to Europe where he will explore Maria's past and walk in her footsteps through her old haunts, it will take him to the present, with his own struggles with identity, acting, and self, and it ultimately brings the reader along on a journey to inspect life's meaning and the impact two very different individuals from very different worlds will have upon one another.\n\nPerhaps best of all, THE ACCIDENTAL CAREGIVER shows that age has no boundaries when it comes to love and meaningful influences in life; ultimately celebrating not only Maria's life, but the possibilities of and magic inherent in saying 'yes' to something different and unexpected.\n\nIt's a celebration of life - and is a joyful read recommended for a wide audience.\n\nDiane Donovan\n\nSenior Reviewer\n\nDunford's Bookshelf\n\nHow to Forgive\n\nShlomit Yona Oz\n\nBalboa Press\n\n1663 Liberty Drive, Suite 200\n\nBloomington, IN 47403-5161\n\n9781452548319, $8.99, www.balboapress.com\n\nForgiveness is often difficult to do. \"How to Forgive: The Path from Resistance to Acceptance to Forgiveness to Love\" is a self-improvement guide about learning how to embrace of forgiveness.

His descendants are vultures greedily competing for who owns and sells whatever is found.\n\nWhile Commissario Guido Brunetti takes a respite, Donna Leon introduces readers to another interesting Venusian Dr. Caterina Pellegrini who in her thirties struggles with what she wants out of life. The storyline is filled with plenty of fascinating historical tidbits about Agostino Steffani and the Baroque music era that is fun to read but distracts from the ownership mystery. Although there is too much late seventeenth century-early eighteenth century information and contains an improbable climax, The Jewels Of Paradise remains overall an intriguing thriller.\n\nThe Eyes of Lira Kazan\n\nEva Joly and Judith Perrignon\n\nBitter Lemon Press\n\n37 Arundel Gardens\n\nLondon, W11 2LW, United Kingdom\n\nwww.bitterlemonpress.com\n\n9781908524003, $14.95, www.amazon.com\n\nIn Abuja, Nigeria, following the assassination of his friend and colleague Uche, fraud squad investigator Nwanko needs to get his wife and children out of the country. The British government offer to take him and his family safely away if Nwanko agrees to say nothing about the corrupt Nigerian government he has been investigating for the last few years. Realizing his choice is death for his loved ones and himself or keeping quiet, he agrees to leave Lagos pretending he knows nothing.\n\nIn Nice, the wife of an affluent Faroese banker drowns. The police insist an accident occurred but junior prosecutor Felix thinks otherwise. In St. Petersburg, Lira the investigative journalist understands the hazards of her pursuits and especially fears for the safety of her child. However she diligently probes the business dealings of wealthy Russian Louchsky. These three dedicated individuals will converge in London as Nigerian oil and undercover operatives target them for elimination.\n\nThe Eyes of Lira Kazan is a powerful satire that mocks the marriage between dirty money and \"values\" spouting politicians. Using hyperbole, Eva Joly and Judith Perrignon insist the affluent silence the crusaders by threatening innocent family members. However the keys to this engaging crime thriller is how haunted Nwanko, Felix and Lira feel about the potential assaults on their loved ones from mercenaries and untruth spins about each of them by the dirty money crowd.\n\nThe Geneva Trap\n\nStella Rimington\n\nBloomsbury Press\n\n175 Fifth Avenue, Suite 315\n\nNew York, NY 10010\n\nwww.bloomsbury.com\n\n9781608198726, $25.00, www.amazon.com\n\nAt a Swiss tennis club Russian agent Alexander Petrov states to British operative Russell White he needs to speak with \"Lees Carlisle.\" The Russian also says no one else before leaving. Russell tells what happened to Terry Castle at the M16 station in the British Embassy in Geneva. They agree that Petrov, once listed as Second Secretary, Soviet Trade Delegation, wants to make contact. In Vauxhall Geoffrey Fane knows the Russian wants to speak with Liz Carlisle of MI5.\n\nLiz recalls meeting Petrov years ago; she agrees to see him in Geneva. Fearing Cold War II, he warns her of a cyber-attack on software controlling unmanned drones. He further insists his country is not behind the assault but is unaware who is. Since the drones are a joint venture with the Americans, the British Intel warns London based CIA chief Andy Bokus.\n\nThe latest Liz Carlyle espionage thriller (see Rip Tide) is a great action-packed tale as the protagonist and her unit search for a traitor within and the enemy without in order to prevent a new Cold War that could turn hot rather quickly. Although a personal scenario adds depth to Liz' personal side, this also detracts from what spy aficionados want: an otherwise fantastic thrilling international espionage saga.\n\nThe Aden Effect\n\nClaude Berube\n\nNaval Institute Press\n\n291 Wood Road, Annapolis, MD 21402\n\nwww.navalinstitute.org\n\n9781612511092, $27.95, www.amazon.com\n\nNewly appointed American Ambassador to Yemen, C.J. Sumner understands she has two objectives besides watching for al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. First she to negotiate with the Yemeni authorities to allow American companies to drill for oil off Socotra Island. Second she needs to establish a cooperative team to include the local government and other interested nations to end piracy off on the Aden Sea south of Yemen and north of the Horn of Africa. Madame Ambassador's efforts on both fronts prove futile. Sumner hires former US navy officer Connor Stark, who knows the area as a mercenary, as her defense attache.\n\nStark arranges a meeting between Yemeni shipping company CEO and the ruling family. At the same time, American diplomatic security operative Damien Golzari investigates a death of a State Department employee's son when he finds evidence of illegal khat drug sales in the states that tie to a shipping company in Yemen. Sumner sanctions a humanitarian aid mission on Socotra, but pirates attack while Stark leads a counter attack. Golzari and Stark soon realize there is a more powerful adversary behind the troubled Aden Sea.\n\nThis is an exciting naval thriller that showcases how difficult it is for USA to help the local nations bordering on the Aden Sea with their myriad of problems while also furthering American interests on the region. The storyline is action-packed throughout, but goes hyperspeed when Golzari and Stark meet. Although the key support cast lacks depth, fans will relish this deep look at Yemen.\n\nThe Rendition\n\nAlbert Ashforth\n\nOceanview Publishing\n\n595 Bay Isles Road, 120-G\n\nLongboat Key, FL 34228\n\nwww.oceanviewpub.com\n\n9781608090594, $25.95, www.amazon.com\n\nIn 2007 in the Baltics, war between Serbia and Kosovo is heating up. American intelligence officer Alex Klear enters Kosovo to abduct Ramush Nadaj; as the plan is to rendition the leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army. The mission proves not fully planned as everything goes wrong ending with Klear captured and tortured by the KLA for two days before his partner Buck Romero retrieves him.\n\nWhile Klear physically heals in Germany at an American military hospital, he decides his covert field days are over as he lost something during the hours of torture especially since his superiors who sent him in hastily hold him culpable. Colonel Sylvia Frost recruits Klear with a do-over mission that will enable him to strike back at the KLA who haunt him and rendition Nadaj. However, once again Klear faces lies as the KLA want him dead and the German police want him arrested for an alleged murder.\n\nThis is a great espionage thriller starring a terrific spy whose perseverance and diligence lead him to uncover a diabolical plot as Kosovo Independence Day nears. Fast-paced from the opening failed rendition and never slowing down; fans will appreciate Klear's escapades as he knows he is the pasty if the mission fails.\n\nThe Ragnarök Conspiracy\n\nErec Stebbins\n\nSeventh Street Books\n\nc/o Prometheus Books\n\n59 John Glenn Drive, Amherst, NY 14228-2197\n\nwww.prometheusbooks.com\n\n9781616147129, $15.95, www.amazon.com\n\nFBI agent \"Mad John\" Savas is still grieving though over a decade has passed since his son died in the 9/11 terrorist mass murders. John believes he will always be angry and in mourning until the day he dies. However the Fed takes some solace in his job as a counterterrorism unit Intel 1 agent. Divorced John also feels his romance with FBI agent Rebecca Cohen gives him a sense of normalcy in his troubled mind\n\nAn unknown cabal using runes of Norse code to communicate is assassinating and bombing Muslims around the world. John has an affinity with the unknown anti-Muslim killers who take the war on terrorism back to the source. Still he tries to do his job right as he keeps reminding himself terrorism is terrorism. When Muslim-American agent Husaam Jordan joins the unit, Savas and others resent him initially until he proves himself worthy of their respect and support.\n\nThis is an entertaining thriller in which the protagonist must overcome his prejudice to not just work with a Muslim-American, but to end the assaults on innocent Muslims. The fast-paced storyline strongly pushes tolerance though he recognizes how difficult that can be to someone who lost a loved one due to intolerance. Although some of the key life changing events lack depth to persuade readers of their authenticity, fans will enjoy this unique global war on terrorism thriller as we get inside the head of an emotionally hurting counter agent.\n\nThe Bookseller\n\nMark Pryor\n\nSeventh Street Books\n\nc/o Prometheus Books\n\n59 John Glenn Drive, Amherst, NY 14228-2197\n\nwww.prometheusbooks.com\n\n9781616147082, $15.95, www.amazon.com\n\nIn Paris, former FBI profiler Hugo Marston enjoys the City of Lights while working as the head of security at the American embassy. However, while touring the city, his idyllic time ends when he watches in horror as someone with a gun abducts elderly book dealer Max Koche from the victim's Seine bouquiniste. Hugo becomes frustrated with the local gendarme who seems disinterested in attempting to rescue the kidnapped Max.\n\nNot one to sit idly on the sidelines, the Texan expatriate investigates. He obtains help from sort of retired CIA agent Tom Green and soon learns Max is not the first bookstall owner kidnapped. Evidence mounts that the bouquinistes are victims of gang warfare as they become Seine floaters. Hugo and journalist Claudia de Roussillon begin a romance that is in peril when he learns Max was a Nazi hunter with a stunning tie to Claudia's father.\n\nThis is enjoyable French investigation in which Paris as seen through Hugo's eyes comes to life. Hugo is a solid hero though his inquiry may make him persona non grata and expelled from France. Although the violent abductions and homicides are somewhat muted, the storyline is fast-paced from start to Hugo and Tom confronting their adversary who expects their visit.\n\nDead Peasants\n\nLarry D. Thompson\n\nThomas Dunne Books\n\nc/o St. Martin's Press\n\n175 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10010\n\nwww.stmartins.com\n\n9781250009494, $25.99, www.amazon.com\n\nIn Beaumont, Texas, after winning an enormous wrongful death civil suit for three families of dead refinery workers, attorney Jack Bryant retires. He plans to spend time with his son J.D. an ex-marine who is a walk-on trying to make the nationally ranked TCU football team, and to do pro bona legal services for the poor in Fort Worth.\n\nThe \"Boss\" hires a hit man to kill several former employees, but make it look like accidents. Meanwhile Widow June Davis shows Jack an exorbitant insurance check made out to her late husband's employer. She explains that the payoff is exponentially greater than what her spouse could have made at the auto dealership in a booming economy. Jack accepts June as a client as he files in civil court for her to collect the life insurance money.\n\nThe murder for insurance money of \"Dead Peasant\" is an engaging legal thriller with a powerful underlying concept. The fast-paced storyline is at its best when the focuses are on insurance practices or in the courtroom. However, Jack spends too much time as a detective, which detracts from an otherwise intriguing tale.\n\nLittle Star\n\nJohn Ajvide Lindqvist, author\n\nMarlaine Delargy, translator\n\nDunne\n\n9780312620516, $26.99\n\nIn 1992 failed rocker Lennart Cederstom seeks mushrooms in the woods when a BMW comes driving at high speed past him. He soon finds a bag, a grave and a howling baby with a perfect E pitch. Lennart brings the abandoned infant home where he and his wife Laila discuss what to do with the child. They agree to raise the child they name Theres as their own.\n\nYears later languid teen Theres murders her adoptive parents. She moves in with her older adoptive brother ex-con Jerry in Stockholm. Also recognizing the quality of her voice, Jerry enters Theres in a national singing competition on TV. Another adolescent outsider sees Theres on the show and recognizes a kindred spirit. Teresa goes to meet Theres and when they do, they turn Sweden into their personal battleground.\n\nThis is a well written violent satire that mocks pop music, pop teens, pop websites and pop bullies. The two females come across as real amoral soulless individuals. They chillingly kill anyone in their path in a sort of bloodier Bonnie and Bonnie (no Clyde need apply) as they make Thelma and Louise look like nuns. Fast-paced, readers who enjoy something different (and gory) will appreciate the tea for two.\n\nThe Accomplice\n\nCharles Robbins\n\nDunne\n\n9781250010513, $24.99\n\nHenry Hatten was press secretary for Tyler when the latter lost the race for Governor of Iowa probably because the former failed to finish an unethical but needed assault. The only moderate Republican running for the presidential nomination in a field of conservatives, Nebraska Senator Tom Peele hires Henry who knows Iowa, the first key state in the process. Though spending time in Iowa is not enticing as Henry recalls someone telling him that if you have six months to live stay in Iowa as it will feel like ten years; still he thinks the charismatic Peele has a strong chance of winning.\n\nHowever, Henry soon learns of married Peele's potentially fatal flaw: beautiful women. On top of that Henry finds the candidate who allegedly adheres to his values and their election chairman act like many politicians corrupt and avaricious. Soon all hell breaks out when a murder occurs with Henry stuck either holding the bag or covering the bag.\n\nTimely with condemnation, the Accomplice is a delightful political thriller that enables the audience to observe what goes on behind the curtain on a major run for the White House. Ethical politician seems like an oxymoron as even knowing to keep oneself clean fails to prevent scandalous, illegal and in this case murderous behavior from happening. Purist Henry is superb as a sort of Forty Year Old Virgin surrounded by hedonist devils who ask not what they can do for their country - ask what their country can do for them.\n\nBlood Sacrifice\n\nMichael Lister\n\nPulpwood Press\n\nwww.PulpwoodPress.com\n\n9781888146967, $16.99, www.amazon.com\n\nAfter several bloody cases (see The Body and the Blood, Flesh and Blood, Power in the Blood and Blood of the Lamb) and the destruction of his marriage, prison chaplain John Jordan needs a breather. The former cop is staying at St. Ann's Abbey retreat center in Bridgeport, Florida Panhandle. He sees police lights nearby and goes to help Chief Steve Taylor, a former deputy to John's dad Potter County chief. As everyone waits for Taylor, John interferes with the body proving the victim who he knew as Tommy Boy was not a floater. Taylor lectures him and Jordon knows he erred. Sister Abigail who has been counseling Jordon lectures him too.\n\nSomeone brutally murders Gulf Coast Paper Company heiress Tammy Taylor who was undergoing an exorcism conducted by the retreat's Father Thomas Scott. Increasingly Father Thomas looks guilty of the savage murder in which he insists demons inside the victim killed her. Sister Abigail, believing he is innocent, asks John to investigate. John assumes earthly matters involving the Gulf Coast Paper Company's selling its property to developers is more likely the motive rather than demonic possession.\n\nThe latest John Jordon whodunit is a great investigative tale with several viable suspects including Father Thomas and Chief Taylor among others. The storyline focuses on the conflict between hard core religious beliefs in demonic possession and hard core economic credo in developing one of the last pristine natural Florida areas. Readers will appreciate Chaplin Jordan's inquiry as the hero wonders whether Tammy is a Blood Sacrifice to the Christian God or capitalist god.\n\nHemingway's Girl\n\nErika Robuck\n\nNew American Library (NAL)\n\nc/o Penguin Group USA\n\n375 Hudson Street, New York, NY 10014\n\nwww.newamericanlibrary.com\n\n9780451237880, $16.00, www.amazon.com\n\nIn 1935 Florida, the Bennet family American patriarch dies leaving behind a Cuban widow, three young daughters and no money. The oldest child nineteen years old Mariella Bennet bets on a boxing match in which Ernest Hemingway referees. She loses but meets the famous writer, who, accompanied by his second wife Pauline and their two sons, recently moved to Key West.\n\nHemingway hires Mariella as a housemaid. He takes the teen to a fight where she meets pugilist WWI veteran Gavin Murray who is working on the Overseas Highway. He is attracted to the spunky young lady as is Hemingway. As the thirtyish males vie for the attention of the much younger maid, she likes both of them but Papa is married as a Labor Day Hurricane batters the Keys.\n\nThe key to this engaging historical drama is Hemingway seems real as he transitions into \"Papa\" while the rest of the key players come across as genuine too. Although the enjoyable storyline starts slow while the characters, relationships (including unneeded ones) and the setting are introduced, the plot accelerates once the two overlapping triangles form. Fans will enjoy Depression Era Papa Hemingway's Girl.\n\nThree and a Half Virgins\n\nJohn Blumenthal\n\nFarmer Street Press\n\nhttp://db.com/d/publisher/farmer_street_press.html\n\n9780967944418, $8.99\n\nAs her husband turns forty with the middle age bulge beginning to show, Deirdre wishes her spouse Jimmy Hendricks (\"No relation\") a happy birthday by informing him she is divorcing him. Stunned as if he is trapped in a Purple Haze and feeling almost as alone as he felt when he and Deirdre were allegedly happy over the last few years, Jimmy recognizes that he is a recovering idiot. He muses about what could have been if he was not an idiot when he attended high school and college and dreams of a reunion with any or all of his ex-girlfriends.\n\nHe decides to visit them to ask them to forgive his stupid troglodyte behavior though he also hopes for a heated tryst or three too. His best friend Morris the Orthodox Jew accompanies Jimmy on his redemption tour. Jimmy starts with the minister's daughter Laura Beasley of Rimbaldi High School. Next up is Samantha Jane Conrad at Fryman College. Third at bat is Molly Martinez also at Fryman College. Then there was Christine while Molly was away at a family funeral.\n\nWith a nod to Denis Leary's Bad Boy movie, Three and a Half Virgins is an amusing character study of a man looking back at his transgressions towards women. Each female owns a chapter so that the audience knows how they felt about Jimmy during and after. Although the storyline is thin, readers will enjoy Jimmy Hendricks' forty years old idiot gig.\n\nThe Barcelona Brothers\n\nCarlos Zanon, author\n\nJohn Cullen, translator\n\nOther Press\n\n2 Park Avenue, 24th Floor, New York, NY 10016\n\nwww.otherpress.com\n\n9781590515181, $15.95, www.amazon.com\n\nIn Barcelona, Epi and Alex Dalmau enter a dive where one can buy drinks as well as whores and drugs.

Meanwhile Epi remains obsessed with his ex-squeeze Tiffany Brisette, who was stepping out with Tanveer.\n\nThis is a dark Spanish thriller that uses flashbacks to purvey to readers how Epi, Tanveer and Tiffany got to that deadly assault. The storyline pulls no punches when it comes to racial profiling, fatherless children as adults perpetuating the fatherlessness, and life in the sewers of the slums. Carlos Zanon provides a tense stark warning that Spain better beware and deal with the brutal undercurrent that threatens society.\n\nFrame Up\n\nJames Phoenix\n\nGrey Swan Press\n\n9780983490036, $27.95, www.greyswanpress.com\n\nPrivate eye Fenway Burke has not gone to his office in six months while living on board a rusted houseboat in Marblehead Harbor north of Boston.

Shawn Corbett, a son of a friend of Tiny's mom, resides in Walpole; sentenced for life for killing a man. Three witnesses testified that he pulled the trigger and other evidence points to Shawn who insists he is innocent. As Fenway chats with the uncooperative detective and the cooperative public defender, bodies are everywhere starting with the murders of the three witnesses. Realizing he will have no seventh inning rest during the investigation, Fenway must end the killing spree of a hit man before he becomes the victim of a walk off homer while also seeking the affluent and influential employer who hired the hit man.\n\nFans of Parker's Spencer will enjoy James Phoenix's take on the mean streets of Boston even though the protagonist can only name two players and lacks the sardonic wit of the Red Sox nation PI centerfold. With a pleasant supporting romance enhancing the top rate investigation, readers anticipate the Green Monster showdown between the professional killer and Burke with the odds on the other guy.\n\nKilling the Emperors\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\nPoisoned Pen Press\n\n6962 E.

He begins his vendetta with a string of abductions of those he holds culpable for his mistakes to include kidnapping Baroness Ida \"Jack\" Troutbeck, Tate galleries director Sir Nicholas Serota, teacher Dr. Hortense Wilde, and artists Anastasia Holliday, Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin.\n\nThe art world panics out of fear of being the next snatched or worse not being the next victim. While the culprit is silent on his or her demands except for the business of the kidnappings, the realization by the impacted shallow community is that those abducted all defended the conceptual art school. Meanwhile mystery writer Robert Amiss investigates the kidnappings with the goal of rescuing Jack.\n\nThe latest Baroness Jack Troutbeck and Robert Amiss Series (see Ten Lords A-Leaping) is a super satire that mocks conceptual art as \"rubbish\" and its defenders as \"nihilistic\" con artists. Using real persona alongside fictional characters enhances a fabulous lampooning of the world of art.\n\nMixed Signals\n\nJane Tesh\n\nPoisoned Pen Press\n\n9781464200618, $24.95\n\nIn Parkland, North Carolina, the two house mates, private investigator David Randall and psychic Camden, come home when the latter goes over to say hello to their neighbor Jared Hunter.

David learns that Jared and Bert Galvan the son of the Parkland Herald editor, were involved in a break-in at the Parkland Museum of History. Meanwhile the Parkland Avenger is a failing fool in which the Super Hero Society of Parkland insists this bumbler is not one of them.\n\nThe latest entertaining Grace Street investigation (see Stolen Hearts) is an engaging cozy that has too many eccentric characters making it difficult to keep track of the several subplots. The narrator Randall is a fascinating protagonist as he works the whodunit and sees Kary while fearing his mom's interrogation over the death of his daughter. Fans will enjoy this zany regional cozy as Christmas arrives in Parkland.\n\nFace of the Enemy\n\nJoanne Dobson and Beverle Graves Myers\n\nPoisoned Pen Press\n\n9781464200328, $24.95\n\nAmerica changed on December 7, 1941 when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Throughout the country, patriotism and fear intensified to stratospheric levels. Several thousand miles away from the sight of the deadly assault, New York City, like all of the United States, begins to mobilize.\n\nThe FBI invades a Brooklyn boarding house to take away Japanese- American artist Masako Fumi Oakley, wife of an ailing professor. Stunned by the legal abduction is Nurse Louise Hunter who is tending to the professor's health needs; she vows to get Masako freed from Ellis Island and back with her spouse. When someone murders Masako's art dealer while he closed down her show, the police suspect her as the killer mostly because of her ethnicity. Louise investigates; helped by boarding house resident Cabby Ward the reporter and Police Lieutenant Michael McKenna who wants the real killer caught instead of a Japanese scapegoat that the Feds prefer.\n\nThe parallels between the aftermath reactions to 12/7 and 9/11 are uncanny as Joanne Dobson and Beverle Graves Myers captures the targeted reactions by \"patriots\" acting out of ambition or fear. The investigation is enjoyable although the G-men are stereotyped as ambitious and uncaring re the truth. Still this is an engaging entity as America prepares for war after Pearl Harbor which seems so similar to America preparing for war after the Towers, the pentagon and Pennsylvania.\n\nBleeding Through\n\nSandra Parshall\n\nPoisoned Pen Press\n\n9781464200298, $24.95\n\nIn Mason County, Virginia, veterinarian Rachel Goddard and Deputy Sheriff Tom Bridger live together in an old farmhouse.

One of the students seventeen year old Megan Beecher realizes the victim is her missing sister in law school student Shelley.\n\nTom investigates the murder of Shelley, which he thinks ties back to her legal efforts to free convicted murderer Vince Lankford for beating to death Brian Hadley. Meanwhile, Rachel's frightened sister Michelle the psychiatrist has fled her Maryland home and DC office to hide from a persistent stalker in her sibling's Virginia farmhouse. Michelle's husband Kevin says there is no one after his wife; knowing her sister's phobic dependencies and trepidations Rachel agrees with her brother-in-law until the stalking turns on her affirms even the paranoid can sometimes be right.\n\nThe latest Rachel Goddard mystery (see Under the Dog Star) is a strong thriller with two fabulous cases. Tom works the law student murder with his assumption being either Hadley's family killed Shelley or her premise that Lankford is innocent is right and the real murderer silenced her. At the same time Rachel tries to keep her sister safe starting with Michelle's mental state to the realization there really is a stalker. Both scenarios are super as Sandra Parshall provides a fabulous mystery.\n\nMore than Sorrow\n\nVicki Delany\n\nPoisoned Pen Press\n\n9781590589878, $24.95\n\nWar correspondent Hannah Manning slowly recovers from a brain injury caused by an IED in Afghanistan at her sister Joanne's farmhouse in Prince Edward County, Ontario.

During the American Revolution, Maggie's Loyalist husband was killed and she fell into abject poverty.\n\nHannah takes walks with Afghani expatriate Hila Popalzai, who cannot discuss her past with anyone as the memories are too nightmarish. When someone murders Hila, the police question Hannah who offers nothing of usefulness in solving the homicide though the cops believe the reporter hides information. As Hannah tries to remember anything her friend said and whether her brain trauma is leading to hallucinations, a viable threat towards her beloved ten year old niece Lily surfaces to get at the journalist.\n\nThough the two subplots loosely merge in an exciting climax, the past and present feel like two different stories that never fully come together; as the modern day mystery is filled with suspense that grips the reader while the historical feels intrusive. Still overall fans will enjoy this thriller as the Canadian farmhouse ties two wars over two centuries apart.\n\nTwo Destinies\n\nElizabeth Musser\n\nDavid C.
