        "text": "The Dawn Chorus zoom writing group returns tomorrow morning, this time with a new offering – the Dusk Chorus for those who are not early birds.\n\nCome and join me for an hour of writing in this friendly, no pressure zoom room. In each session we’ll look at a poem or creative non fiction extract, followed by an optional prompt. There is time to write in this quiet, peaceful room room and you are not expected to share anything with the group. There are no ice breakers, no pressure, you do not even have to have your camera on. Thee will be five minutes at the end of each session to share your work if you want to, but the purpose of the sessions are about you finding time to prioritise your writing.\n\nCome and join me for the Dawn Chorus or the Dusk Chorus, or both. Come for one day or all five days, your £15 (plus eventbrite booking fee) covers all five days of whichever session you choose and I’m offering a £5 discount to those who book both."
