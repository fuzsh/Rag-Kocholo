        "text": "All products and services featured are independently chosen by editors. However, Billboard may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.\n\nPart two of the highly anticipated Lifetime documentary, Where Is Wendy Williams?, premieres on Sunday (Feb. 25).\n\nAccording to a press release from Lifetime, the two-part documentary offers “unparalleled access” to the former talk-show maven. For nearly two years, cameras filmed Williams moving into “the next phase of her life” following the cancellation of her talk show.\n\n“I have no money. If it happened to me, it could happen to you,” Williams says in the trailer, which shows footage of the now-59-year-old media personality inside her New York City apartment.\n\nThe Lifetime documentary was filmed in 2022 after Williams was placed under financial conservatorship.\n\nAccording to People, Williams moved out of the apartment and has been in a treatment facility since sometime last year.\n\n“Wendy has been part of the Lifetime family for over a decade and during that time, we partnered with Wendy for her revealing biopic and doc,” Elaine Frontain Bryant, EVP and head of programming, A&E, Lifetime and LMN said in a press release. “But her story is not finished. There is so much more to it. Nobody truly knew the depths of Wendy’s reality so we hope that what our cameras captured can help shine a light on what she is facing now.”\n\nIn 2023, Williams was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia and primary progressive aphasia, according to a press announcement released Thursday. Aphasia is a brain disorder that affects the brain’s frontal lobe impacting memory, comprehension and mobility. Aphasia typically occurs after a stroke or brain injury but can also be progressive, according to the National Association of Aphasia.\n\nThe documentary is produced by Entertainment One and Creature Films for Lifetime. Williams is an executive producer on the documentary along with her son, Kevin Hunter Jr.\n\nAdditional executive producers include Williams’ manager, Will Selby, who appears in the documentary, Tara Long, Mark Ford, Pat Lambert, Brie Miranda Bryant and Erica Hanson, who also serves as showrunner.\n\nRead on for details on how to watch the documentary from anywhere.\n\nHow to Watch Where Is Wendy Williams? for Free\n\nThe first two episodes of Lifetime’s Where Is Wendy Williams? premiered on Saturday at 8 p.m. ET/PT. The documentary series comes to a close with two, back-to-back episodes premiering on Sunday at 8 p.m. ET/PT.\n\nIf you have access to Lifetime through cable or satellite, be sure to check your local listings for channel information. You can also stream the documentary on mylifetime.com, a day after it airs, but you’ll likely need a provider log-in to it watch live.\n\nTo watch Lifetime without cable, subscribe to a steamer such as DirecTV, Philo, Fubo, or Hulu + Live TV. Most streaming platforms offer a free trial to new subscribers.\n\nLifetime is one of more than 70 channels available on Philo for just $25/month (after a free trial for a week). The streaming plan gives you access to Lifetime, LMN, Logo, MTV, BET, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., OWN, CMT, Paramount Network, Pop TV, and other channels.\n\nPhilo also allows subscribers to add Starz and MGM+ for an additional monthly fee.\n\nSubscribe to DirecTV and watch Lifetime and other channels for free for the first five days. The streaming platform offers 75+ channels, including Bravo, TLC, A&E, HGTV, ESPN, FS1, CNN, AMC, BET, VH1, Cartoon Network, ID Network, ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and more.\n\nFubo is another affordable streamer, that offers a free trial when you join. You can stream over 100 channels with Fubo Pro ($79.99/month), plus a free trial for the first week.\n\nUnfortunately, Hulu + Live TV doesn’t offer a free trial, but you’ll get access to over 90 channels (Lifetime included) along with Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+.\n\nWhere Is Wendy Williams? is also available to purchase on Prime Video and Apple TV for $1.99 per episode, or $2.99 to stream the episode in HD.\n\nAnd if you want to watch the documentary internationally, ExpressVPN and NordVPN unlocks access to multiple streaming platforms.\n\nFollowing announcement of her diagnosis, Williams thanked fans for “the love and kinds words” in a statement released to People on Friday. “I want to say I have immense gratitude for the love and kind words I have received after sharing my diagnosis of Aphasia and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD),” the statement reads. “Let me say, wow! Your response has been overwhelming. The messages shared with me have touched me, reminding me of the power of unity and the need for compassion.”\n\nThe statement continues, “I hope that others with FTD may benefit from my story. I want to also thank the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration for their kind words of support and their extraordinary efforts to raise awareness of FTD. I continue to need personal space and peace to thrive. Please just know that your positivity and encouragement are deeply appreciated.”\n\nTo start the weekend, Lifetime aired the 2021 biopic Wendy Williams: The Movie and the documentary Wendy Williams: What a Mess on Friday. Lifetime also rebroadcast the first two episodes of Where Is Wendy Williams? on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nOn Thursday, Williams’ court-appointed guardian filed a lawsuit against A&E Television Networks, Lifetime’s parent company, in an attempt to stop the documentary from airing. The judge sided with the cable network, Lifetime confirmed in a statement released to CNN on Friday. “Lifetime appeared in court today, and the documentary Where Is Wendy Williams? will air this weekend, as planned.”\n\nWatch the trailer for Where Is Wendy Williams? below."
