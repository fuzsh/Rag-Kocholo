        "text": "To celebrate National Stroke Week we are fortunate enough to have Wendy Lyons celebrating the release of her book, Left of Tomorrow: A journey of stroke recovery.\n\nEach year in Australia, over sixty thousand people suffer from stroke. Within the first few weeks over one third of those affected die. For the survivors there is an uphill battle of physical and emotional rehabilitation. In August 2000, Wendy Lyons suffered and survived a devastating stroke. The small bleed in the left thalamus of the mid-brain caused a permanent shift in her innate ability to interpret and process sensory perceptions on the right side of her body. Eight years on, Wendy shares her daily struggle to decipher these conflicting messages with a lifetime of remembered truths. A beautifully written account of the personal journey through stroke recovery which enlightens, encourages and uplifts the soul.\n\nFree, no need to book."
