        "text": "I am excited to welcome James Houston Turner to Book’d Out today. The Identity Factor is a fast paced, international thriller. Abu Nazer is the world’s most elusive terrorist. His identity is unknown, his list of crimes unimaginable. But Abu Nazer knows the CIA is closing in. Which is why he must change identities. He devises a scheme involving an ancient stone tablet discovered in the Sinai Peninsula in 1919. The tablet makes a stunning declaration about Jerusalem that has the CIA running scared. They fear he will use it to ignite Armageddon. And Abu Nazer has been using that fear against them because someone at the Agency has been leaking him information. Analyst Zoe Gustaves stumbles onto the leak and begins digging for answers. But all she finds are more questions. Seeking answers can be deadly when everyone has secrets. Today the author discusses how his experiences gave him the idea for the novel and is offering readers the opportunity to win a copy of both The Identity Factor and his latest novel, Department Thirteen.\n\nWho Are You?\n\nWho are you? Who, who, who, who? Most of us know this haunting chorus — written originally in 1978 by Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey of the musical group, The Who — from the TV crime drama, CSI. It’s an interesting question around which to build a novel, which is precisely what ended up happening to me. Layered identities is something I lived for many years while operating as a smuggler and courier behind the old Iron Curtain. I recall sitting around a table in Berlin with a bunch of “friends” — all of us used false identities when we traveled — and I began to wonder: what if one of us works for the other side? We’re all supposed to be friends, but what if one of us isn’t?\n\nThat’s the kind of situation I created for rookie profiler Zoe Gustaves in The Identity Factor (published originally in Australia in 2007; US edition by Comfort Publishing, 2011). Zoe is young and impetuous — her own worst enemy — as she tries unraveling the identity of a terrorist no one has ever identified. Enter Tyler, a charming Texas journalist with a deeper agenda of his own, which arouses Zoe’s suspicions in spite of the attraction she feels toward him. She then discovers her boss at the CIA is hiding something, and soon, everyone around her is not who they seem.\n\nIt’s an old adage to write what you know, and in my case, this has included a costly battle against cancer where I survived against all odds, being on a KGB watchlist, organizing secret midnight meetings with informants, discovering secret mountain bunkers, and researching forgotten tunnels beneath the cobblestones and bricks of some of Central Europe’s most venerated cathedrals. I’ve been beaten up by a man karate legend Bruce Lee called one of the most dangerous men in America. I’ve attended two National Prayer Breakfasts with the President of the United States, but at other times been so poor I had to live on jars of peanut butter given to me by a church. I’ve experienced failed relationships and untimely family deaths, yet was able to marry the woman of my dreams. Life has been anything but predictable and boring.\n\nSo when characters in my books feel pain, I’ve been there. When characters die, I’ve almost been there. When love triumphs against the odds — and when it doesn’t — I’ve been there. From the heights of exhilaration to the depths of despair, I’ve been blessed with a spectrum of experiences that add richness to my writing.\n\nThe Identity Factor was privileged to scoop finalist awards in four US book competitions, including the National Best Books Awards and The Eric Hoffer Award. Why? I think part of the reason was Zoe, whose headstrong behavior landed her in a fair bit of trouble, just as it enabled her to triumph in the end. She illustrated the flaws and strengths many of us have as she struggled to ferret out who she could trust, who she could love, and who she may have to shoot. She persevered against the odds and reacted to situations impulsively, often at great risk to herself and those around her. When she was suspended from work for again mouthing off to her boss, for example, she hastily decided to follow Tyler to Cairo, whom she believed was the key to locating and identifying the terrorist. On the way, she carelessly allowed her carry-on bag full of documents to be stolen in an airport bar. She then ran down and tackled the thief in the crowded concourse and held him at gunpoint until airport security arrived and threatened to haul her to jail for drawing a loaded weapon.\n\nAnd yet while Zoe wrestled with the identities of those around her, she was also coming to grips with herself. How well we know or don’t know ourselves is one of the subtexts of the book. Personality strengths and weaknesses, the struggles of life seasoned, the triumph and humor — to me these are what make stories come to life. It’s what I’ve lived. It’s who I am. It’s what I write. Which I guess serves to illustrate one thing: the only truly fictitious part of a novel is found in the disclaimer that says the characters contained herein are fictitious, and that any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.\n\n——————————\n\nAbout The Author\n\nJames Houston Turner loves writing international suspense thrillers with a good love story at heart.

When she’s accused of murdering her fiance, however, the small town is anything but heavenly for Megan Connors. With her fingerprints on the murder weapon, it looks like an open-and-shut case, and Sheriff Fox, running for reelection and anxious to get credit for ‘solving’ a murder case, intends on ramming through charges and getting a conviction. Megan’s only champions are her aging aunts. They don’t believe she’s guilty, but what can two senior citizens do against the powers of the state and the evidence against Megan? Isabel and Alma Trumbo may be aging, even worried about memory loss, but they’ve read just about every mystery published in the past half-century. They’re sure they’ve picked up the skills and knowledge they need to prove Megan’s innocence. Starting with the town’s gossips and loafers, then scaling up when the sexy ex-girlfriend of one of the Sheriff’s deputies joins them, they search for alternate suspects, possible motives, and any evidence that might exonerate their niece.\n\nStatus: Read from August 25 to 26, 2011 — I own a copy {Courtesy the author}\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nQuiet Anchorage is a debut cozy mystery for Ed Lynskey in the tradition of Anne George’s Southern Sisters series. In the small American town of Quiet Anchorage, sisters Isabel and Alma Trumbo enjoy sipping iced tea, reading mystery novels, watching ‘stories’ and completing the odd crossword or two but these two spry septuagenarians are incensed when their niece, Megan, is accused of the murder of her fiance and set out to prove Sheriff Fox wrong and unmask the real killer.\n\nWith just enough misdirection to keep the reader off balance, this mystery is well thought out and engaging. Through a combination of clever investigation and a little luck, the sisters identify several possible suspects including the arrogant Sheriff seeking reelection and his rival deputy.\n\nAlma and Isabel bicker good naturedly and have a cynical wisdom afforded by age. The pair are very likable protagonists being forthright and slightly eccentric. Sammi Jo is a good foil for the two, the brawn behind the brains almost. The book is also populated by the quintessential small town characters like the ‘Benchwarmers’ that add to the appeal of the story by grounding it firmly in a community.\n\nThe novel’s gentle momentum and sense of humor has an undeniable charm. I noticed that Lynskey often misused prepositions and punctuation was a bit hit and miss but these were minor issues.\n\nQuiet Anchorage is a delightful cozy mystery that I enjoyed. Lynskey is planning on creating a series based on the lively Alma and Isabel Trumbo and their newly incorporated investigation agency so keep an eye out for more titles.\n\nRead the first chapter online\n\n———————————–\n\nAbout the Author\n\nEd Lynskey is a crime fiction writer living with his family in a Virginia suburb near Washington, D.C. He has authored the P.I. Frank Johnson series, the latest out this year, The Zinc Zoo. His standalone Appalachian noir Lake Charles will be out in June. Taking a break from the noir and hardboiled mode, his first small town cozy mystery, Quiet Anchorage, went on sale in March 2011.\n\nGoodreads I Twitter\n\n———————————–\n\nAvailable to Purchase\n\n@ Amazon {kindle & print}\n\nTitle: Birthday Pie\n\nAuthor: Arthur Wooten\n\nPublished: iUniverse April 2011\n\nSynopsis: When Lex Martindale, a New York City writer, goes home to celebrate his birthday and say goodbye to his dying father, he struggles with whether or not to share with his eccentric Southern family news of his own life-threatening situation. As we travel through seventy years of the Martindales’ rich and colorful history, unearthing forbidden loves, shattered hopes and tenacious dreams, we realize that this reunion is a volatile turning point in all of their lives. But as anger, resentments and jealousies erupt to the surface, it’s their laughter and irreverent sense of humor that prevails allowing for a quiet healing in this bittersweet, moving portrait, of the all-American family.\n\nStatus: Read from August 22 to 23, 2011 {Courtesy the author}\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nBirthday Pie is both hilarious and poignant as it explores the dynamics of the dysfunctional Martindale family. Their patriarch is dying and the family is gathering to say their goodbyes. The reunion raises old slights, stunted dreams and buried secrets but also reminds them of the laughter and love that binds them.\n\nI was quickly absorbed into the fabric of this story. From the sharp, witty dialogue to the genuine emotion, Birthday Pie is wonderfully told. Wooten skilfully combines humour and drama and I found myself alternately giggling and near tears.\n\nFirst produced as a play, the bones are still evident in Birthday Pie’s larger than life characters. The idiosyncratic cast are saved from becoming caricatures because of the depth Wooten injects them with. Beneath the veneer of eccentricity are individuals with genuine personality. Each member of the family is vividly brought to life through a patchwork of memories that informs the person they have become. Their relationship with each other reveals that the truth of these characters lies somewhere in the middle. The interaction between such strong personalities is naturally contentious but despite the frustrated banter and facade of ambivalence, there is a genuine sense of love and affection between them.\n\nA heartwarming story despite the tragedy that is waiting to unfold, Birthday Pie is a wonderfully entertaining read and I am happy to recommend it.\n\n___________________\n\nAbout the Author\n\nArthur Wooten is the author of the critically acclaimed novels On Picking Fruit and Fruit Cocktail. He’s also written for television, theatre and film.\n\nWebsite I Facebook I Twitter I Goodreads\n\n___________________\n\nAvailable to Purchase\n\n@ Amazon (Kindle and Print)\n\nTitle: The Egyptian {Dominic Grey #2}\n\nAuthor: Layton Green\n\nPublished: August 27th 2011\n\nSynopsis: At a mausoleum in Cairo’s most notorious cemetery, a mercenary receives a package containing a silver test tube suspended in hydraulic stasis. An investigative reporter tracking rogue biomedical companies is terrified by the appearance of a mummified man outside her Manhattan apartment. A Bulgarian scientist who dabbles in the occult makes a startling discovery in his underground laboratory. These seemingly separate events collide when Dominic Grey and Viktor Radek, private investigators of cults, are hired by the CEO of an Egyptian biomedical firm to locate stolen research integral to the company’s new life extension product. However, after witnessing the slaughter of a team of scientists by the remnants of a dangerous cult thought long abandoned, Grey and Viktor turn from pursuers to pursued. From the gleaming corridors of visionary laboratories to the cobblestone alleys of Eastern Europe to a lost oasis in the Sahara, Grey and Viktor must sift through science and myth to uncover the truth behind the Egyptian and his sinister biotech – before that truth kills them.\n\nStatus: Read August 18-19, 2011 – I own a copy {Courtesy the author}\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nLayton Green debuted his Dominic Grey series with The Summoner, an terrific thriller that I was impressed by (read my review). The Egyptian picks up where The Summoner left off, as Dominic begins his first case in the employ of academic cult expert, Viktor Radek.\n\nLayton Green’s detailed research is complimented by his creativity resulting in an intriguing premise that embraces biotech development and Egyptian cult worship. The Egyptian is a fast paced story as Grey\n\ntravels from the US to a tiny village in Bulgaria and an oasis in the middle of the Sahara Desert in pursuit of the truth about the contents of a stolen vial that Grey and Radek were hired to find. Yet this story is more than an action packed thriller, its also an intelligent and tightly plotted mystery.\n\nWhile Radek remains elusive on a seperate case for most of the story, Grey is paired with investigative journalist, Veronica Brown and scientist, Stefan Dimitrov. Veronica follows Dominic to Bulgaria sensing\n\na story that will help boost her career and the two become involved during the course of events. Stefan is initially the target of Grey’s investigation but circumstances result in him joining Dominic and\n\nVeronica after an assassination attempt.\n\nThe author continues to develop Grey’s character making much of his internal conflict between the violence he is capable of and his reluctance to resort to it, even when his choices are limited. Grey\n\nis also struggling with the collapse of his relationship with Nya and his attraction to Veronica. I was hoping to learn more about Radek but apart from glimpses here and there he remains a mysterious figure.\n\nIf I was to be picky, I don’t think the writing isn’t quite as sophisticated as in The Summoner, sentences seem shorter and sharper and it’s not quite as descriptive. However Green has put more thought into his character development and the plot remains strong and exciting.\n\nAs a successor to The Summoner, The Egyptian proves that Layton Green is a talented storyteller who has created an exciting and orginal series. I am already looking forward to Dominic Grey’s next adventure.\n\n——————————-\n\nAvailable to Purchase\n\nOn Sale for $.99 Through Release Weekend Only (August 27 and 28)!\n\n@ Amazon (kindle)\n\n@ B&N (nook)\n\nTitle: Wayward {The Witch Wars Saga # 1}\n\nAuthor: Ashley Girardi\n\nPublished: March 2011\n\nSynopsis: Born without magic, seventeen-year-old Helena “Hex” Wayward is an embarrassment to her power-hungry relatives. As the weakest member of the world’s most deadly magical family, Hex learns early how to avoid confrontation. There’s no defending herself against an errant curse or the pit-demon that her cousins like to summon during family reunions. When the dark magic inside of her — magic that she never dreamt even existed — erupts in a violent display, it kills a member of a rival family. Now, Hex’s family hopes to use her magic for their own sinister purposes and their enemies just want her dead. Abandoning her magic will leave Hex defenseless but she’s seen how quickly power corrupts even the best intentions. Caught between the seductive sorcerer who wants her power for his own and the forbidden love of a human boy, Hex has to make a choice: Save her life or save her soul.\n\nStatus: Read from August 20 to 22, 2011 – I own a copy {Courtesy the author}\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nWayward is the first in a young adult paranormal series self published by Ashley Girardi. I’m hesitant to accept YA for review usually but my interest was piqued by the synopsis and excerpt and fortunately I found Wayward an easy read with an engaging story.\n\nHelena ‘Hex’ Wayward is an outcast amongst her powerful family. As the seventh child of parents who themselves were the seventh children, she was expected to wield great magic and was treated badly when it seemed she would not live up to her potential. When her ability finally reveals itself she is seduced by it’s strength but eventually recognises the danger it presents and flee’s the corrupting influence of her lover and her family. Eventually she is found and forced to return home, coerced into a deal that compromises her spirit, and threatens her life.\n\nI liked the bones of the premise and there are some really interesting concepts at play yet the story has the appropriate simplicity for a mature young adult audience. There are some dark undertones but also some positive messages and Hex faces issues teenagers can easily relate to. Hex’s world is well imagined, the witches exist hidden within human society with a distinct hierarchy that Girardi develops well though some background detail is lacking. I hope the author exploits the potential of this network in further installments.\n\nHex is likeable, with an admirable determination and inner strength. Despite the intense pressure and bullying she has experienced she is determined to hold onto her own core values. She defends her friends even at great risk to herself.\n\nHex’s human friends, Sam and Zach, are fairly standard constructs but amiable enough. Her relationship with both evolves quite naturally and Zach provides the touch of forbidden romance that is de riguer in a YA novel. Cynthie is the mean girl whose hatred of Hex is twisted by unacknowledged jealousy and I thought she she was probably the best actualised character with the strongest motivation for her actions. I would have liked Hex’s relationship with Valentine to be a little more defined – he serves as a catalyst for the plot but remains fairly one dimensional.\n\nWayward has some weaknesses but overall it is a promising first effort from a young writer and I believe the series has the potential to improve as the author gains experience in the craft. If you are a fan of paranormal YA then Wayward, available at the bargain price of 99c, is a risk worth taking.\n\n______________\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAshley Girardi is 26 years old and plans to stay that way for the better part of the next decade.

He is found dead on his consulting-room floor, his skull crushed with a crystal ball and, all, around him, his office in chaos. Meanwhile, Ma Rafferty is sure she can predict Detective Inspector Joe Rafferty’s future – by the simple expedient of organizing it herself. She is still engaged on her crusade to get Rafferty married off to a good Catholic girl with child-bearing hips. But Rafferty has a cunning plan to sabotage her machinations. Only trouble is, he needs Sergeant Llewellyn’s cooperation and he isn’t sure he’s going to get it. During their murder investigations, Inspector Rafferty and Sergeant Llewellyn discover a highly incriminating video concealed in Moon’s flat, a video which, if made public, could wreck more than one life. Was the famous astrologer really a vicious sexual predator? Gradually, connections begin to emerge between Moon and others in the small Essex town of Elmhurst. But how is Rafferty to solve the case when all of his suspects have seemingly unbreakable alibis?\n\nStatus: Read from August 19 to 20, 2011 — I own a copy {courtesy the author}\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nGeraldine Evans has recently re-released her Rafferty and Llewellyn Mystery series in ebook format after it has enjoyed a fourteen book publication run with Macmillan and Severn House in the UK in the early 2000’s.\n\nDeath Line is the third in the British police procedural series that teams the dynamic DI Joe Rafferty with the straight laced Sergeant Dafyd Llewellyn who are investigating the murder of Jasper Moon, a celebrity ‘seer to the stars’. Found dead in his office with a crushed skull, the flamboyant man has his share of admirers and enemies and the pair must determine who is responsible for his violent death.\n\nThis is a skillfully plotted mystery with no shortage of suspects. Evans creates a cast of authentic characters whose flaws put them each in the frame as suspects. Rafferty and Llewellyn investigate the leads methodically, but even as they eliminate a suspect doubt lingers, and it is not until the very end that the murderer is identified. There are surprising twists that keep the reader guessing every step of the way.\n\nRafferty is a likeable character, intelligent and committed to his job he has an irreverent sense of humour and enjoys sparring lightly with the sedate Llewellyn. Their partnership works well, though in this book at least, Rafferty is definitely in control.\n\nThere is an added depth to the story as prejudice is explored and confronted. Rafferty has to reconsider his preconceived notions of Moon as an egocentric, eccentric homosexual as he investigates the man’s past. He is very nearly diverted by his bias and it’s satisfying to have Rafferty recognise his flaws.\n\nFrom the first page I found Evan’s writing style comfortable and engaging. Death Line is a clever and entertaining police procedural mystery that I really enjoyed. A quick search of my local library revealed several of the Rafferty and Llewellyn mysteries on the shelves and I plan to pick up a few on my next visit.\n\n———————–\n\nAbout the Author\n\nGeraldine Evans has been writing since her twenties, though only began to actually finish some when she hit the milestone age of thirty.

Drawing on contemporary news reports and compelling legal cases, Frederick S. Lane drives home the seriousness of the civil and criminal penalties children face for their online behavior, while providing an essential framework for parents, teachers, and school administrators to educate children about the importance of responsible technology use\n\nStatus: Read on August 20, 2011 -I own {Courtesy Smith Publicity/NetGalley}\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nAs a relatively cyber savvy parent I have made every effort to ensure my teenage daughter is educated about the pitfalls of online communication. We discussed the issues regarding privacy, the dangers of online predators, viruses, and many of the other traps that Lane outlines in this book. Initially we monitored her use of her mobile phone, computer and the internet but as she grew older it was more difficult to insist on access as she naturally became more independent and electronic communication became a feature of her social life. Despite our efforts, and with the disregard for consequences that plague adolescence, she made a stupid mistake, all the more shocking to me because I sincerely never thought it was likely to happen for any number of reasons – not the least being she had been educated about the risks of making poor choices. Luckily it was something we were able to reverse but I quickly realised just how easy it is for an otherwise sensible teenager to give into an impulse and potentially derail their future.\n\nIn Cybertraps for the Young, Lane examines the issues that children face online with regard to the legal ramifications of careless communication. Covering topics such as cyber bullying, identity theft, online gambling, fraud and sexting, he uses examples from the headlines to illustrate cases that have resulted in criminal and civil liability for the teenage perpetrators. The law is slowly but surely catching up with new technologies and online users are increasingly being held accountable for their virtual actions.\n\nLane emphasises the need for the digital native generation to be educated about the responsible use of technology. Few consider the ease and scale in which sensitive information can be used against them both immediately and in the future. Fewer still are aware that they are not as invisible as they may think they are when they navigate the net with fake usernames. In this age of information, anonymity on the internet is a myth that children fail to appreciate.\n\nLane’s specific interpretation of the American legal statutes had only peripheral relevance to me, but I expect that the laws would be similar in most first world countries, including my own. I do think the information is valuable in that it provides parents with an example of concrete consequences to share with their child. Children need to be aware that their virtual behaviour has the same potential for implications as their real world behaviour, and they have the same, if not better chance of being caught.\n\nLane also offers some practical suggestions for parents wishing to better monitor electronic usage and has established a companion website for additional resources and latest information.\n\nIn order to protect our children from both themselves and others, adults need to be aware of the issues they face in the digital age. While the text can be a bit dry in places, Cybertraps for the Young is an informative resource for parents and educators who are concerned about their child’s online participation.\n\nCybertraps For the Young on Facebook\n\nAvailable to Purchase\n\n@ Amazon\n\n@ BookDepository\n\nTitle: Body of Sin {Otherkin #4}\n\nAuthor: Eve Silver\n\nPublished: HQN August 2011\n\nSynopsis: The ultimate fall from Grace… Once the favorite son of the Lord of the Underworld, Lokan Krayl held enviable privileges and powers. Powers that led to a devastating betrayal—murder. Resurrected by his immortal brothers, Lokan is still trapped in purgatory. He has no way to contact his family. He has no answers. In order to find the truth about his death, and who killed him, he must escape his prison. And there’s only one way out: through the twelve gates of his eternal enemy, Osiris. But Lokan has help. Bryn Carr, the woman who duped him once before, is his beautiful yet unwanted guide. She’s been sent by his brothers to aid him. She’s his last hope. Lokan must place his fate—and that of the mortal and immortal worlds—in the hands of the one woman he can never trust.\n\nStatus: Read from June 05 to 06, 2011 — I own a copy {Courtesy HQN/NetGalley}\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nHaving enjoyed Sins of the Flesh, the third book in the Otherkin series, I was looking forward to the release of Body of Sin and was thrilled to get my hands on an ARC (courtesy NetGalley). While the third book worked as a stand alone, I think this one works best with some knowledge of the series. Lokan’s story had remained untold except through the prism of his brothers search for his murderer and the scattered pieces of his body and soul. Body of Sin gives the series closure that would not have been accomplished if it had only been published as a trilogy as was originally planned.\n\nAs in the previous books, the relationship between the two protagonists, in this case Lokan and Bryn, is the focus of the story but Silver doesn’t neglect the plot that is well balanced between action and the development of the romance. I liked Lokan and Bryn’s story which is quite different from the standard. The pair have a history together which involves a daughter but have never been a couple, and both have kept secrets from each other. The well being of their daughter motivates both characters which adds a layer of poignancy.\n\nThe Egyptian mythology of the series remains a strength and is more heavily in play here as Lokan and Bryn travel through the void of the underworld in order to effect Lokan’s escape. Silver’s detailed world building shines through the entire series.\n\nBody of Sin is an engaging and satisfying ending to the Otherkin paranormal romance series (though there are rumours that it may continue focusing on Bryns brothers). Fans won’t want to miss it’s release.\n\nAvailable to Purchase\n\n@ Amazon\n\n@ Book Depository\n\nThe Otherkin Series"
