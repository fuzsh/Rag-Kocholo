        "text": "The Condensed Guide to Running Meetings\n\nAmy Gallo\n\nWe love to hate meetings. And with good reason — they clog up our days, making it hard to get work done in the gaps, and so many feel like a waste of time.\n\nHave We Already Been Visited by Aliens?\n\nElizabeth Kolbert\n\nOn October 19, 2017, a Canadian astronomer named Robert Weryk was reviewing images captured by a telescope known as Pan-STARRS1 when he noticed something strange.\n\nThe Black Bartenders That Created the Dive Bar\n\nDavid Wondrich\n\nPart of writing history is finding a path around the load of stories and “facts” that have been handed down to us so that you can see the real people standing behind them.\n\nWarren Buffett’s “2 List” Strategy: How to Maximize Your Focus and Master Your Priorities\n\nJames Clear\n\nWith well over 50 billion dollars to his name, Warren Buffett is consistently ranked among the wealthiest people in the world. Out of all the investors in the 20th century, Buffett was the most successful.\n\nArchaeologists May Have Finally Solved The Mystery Of What Happened To Roanoke\n\nMarco Margaritoff\n\nIn 1590, every settler in the colony of Roanoke suddenly vanished without a trace. An archaeological study has turned up thousands of artifacts that may prove what happened to them. The mystery of what happened to Roanoke has puzzled historians for centuries.\n\nPersonal Leverage: How to Truly 10x Your Productivity\n\nNat Eliason\n\nOur days are fixed. You have no less time than Musk or Bezos. You can only do it through personal leverage.\n\nNotes on technology in the 2020s\n\nfascinating write-up\n\nAs we start a new decade, it’s a good time to reflect on expectations for the next 10 years. Tyler thinks the Great Stagnation could be ending. Caleb sees cracks. Noah expresses techno-optimism. In this post, my aim is not to predict an end or non-end to stagnation.\n\nThe Very Real, Totally Bizarre Bucatini Shortage of 2020\n\nRachel Handler\n\nThe very real, totally bizarre bucatini shortage of 2020. Part I: The Mystery Things first began to feel off in March. While this sentiment applies to everything in the known and unknown universe, I mean it specifically in regard to America’s supply of dry, store-bought bucatini.\n\nYou’re Only As Good As Your Worst Day\n\nWe tend to measure performance by what happens when things are going well. Yet how people, organizations, companies, leaders, and other things do on their best day isn’t all that instructive. To find the truth, we need to look at what happens on the worst day.\n\nThe Fall of Armie Hammer: A Family Saga of Sex, Money, Drugs, and Betrayal\n\nJulie Miller\n\nArmie Hammer already needed crisis therapy. The world was under lockdown last summer, and Hammer had been quarantining at a luxury villa in the Cayman Islands with his father, Michael, his stepmother, Misty, his two young children, and his wife of a decade, Elizabeth.\n\nThe Last Children of Down Syndrome\n\nSarah Zhang\n\nPrenatal testing is changing who gets born and who doesn’t. This is just the beginning. Every few weeks or so, Grete Fält-Hansen gets a call from a stranger asking a question for the first time: What is it like to raise a child with Down syndrome?\n\nWhy We Slouch\n\nVenkatesh Rao\n\nAll physical structures can sag, but only sentient beings like you and me can slouch. To slouch is to adopt a degenerate behavioral posture. One that is aware of the potential for less degeneracy, and retains within itself a seed of an ability to actualize it, but consciously takes it out of play.\n\nThe Most Powerful Learning Tool (That Doesn’t Involve Studying)\n\nA couple hours of studying isn’t nearly as impactful as eight hours of memorizing.\n\nCan You Die From a Broken Heart?\n\nKirsten Weir\n\nWhat happens to our bodies when the bonds of love are breached. Ruth and Harold “Doc” Knapke met in elementary school. They exchanged letters during the war, when Doc was stationed in Germany. After he returned their romance began in earnest.\n\nThe Glorious, Almost-Disconnected Boredom of My Walk in Japan\n\nCraig Mod\n\nThe jazz cafe was tiny, with a few polished wood tables, a record collection on display, and two beautiful speakers. The owner, in his 70s, wore a porkpie hat and a sleeve garter. I’d stumbled into this place during a long walk through a stretch of rural Japan.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Getting Things Done\n\nCal Newport\n\nIn the early two-thousands, Merlin Mann, a Web designer and avowed Macintosh enthusiast, was working as a freelance project manager for software companies.\n\nWhat Is It Like to Be a Man?\n\nPhil Christman\n\nAt the time my wife and I were beginning to date, I owned a broken bed. The box spring had a biggish crack on one side, which caused you to feel like you were being gradually swallowed in the night—an effect seriously exacerbated by the presence of a second person.\n\nMaybe Just Don't Drink Coffee\n\nMatt Buchanan\n\nIt's eight in the morning and you can barely keep your eyes open, much less engage in the activities that constitute productive participation in the glorious neoliberal machinery of our economy.\n\nLessons on Success and Deliberate Practice from Mozart, Picasso, and Kobe Bryant\n\nJames Clear\n\nHow long does it take to become elite at your craft? And what do the people who master their goals do differently than the rest of us? That's what John Hayes, a cognitive psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon University, wanted to know.\n\nThe garden of forking memes: how digital media distorts our sense of time\n\npoints out\n\nMy Dad first gave me The Talk when I was 12 or 13. We were driving down the freeway, and he asked me if I’d ever been judged or harassed for being black. I remember this conversation vividly because my family doesn’t talk too much about their personal experiences with racial discrimination.\n\nNot So Simple\n\nFacebook\n\nAround eleven p.m. the night before the winter solstice of 2016 I unplugged my laptop and turned off my phone for what I hoped would be forever. I had just put the finishing touches to a straw-bale cabin that I’d spent the summer building on the three-acre, half-wild smallholding where I live.\n\nHow to write good prompts: using spaced repetition to create understanding\n\nMatuschak, Andy\n\nThis guide and its embedded spaced repetition system were made possible by a crowd-funded research grant from my Patreon community. If you find my work interesting, you can become a member to get ongoing behind-the-scenes updates and early access to new work.\n\nHow Exercise Shapes You, Far Beyond the Gym\n\nBrad Stulberg\n\nWhen I first started training for marathons a little over ten years ago, my coach told me something I’ve never forgotten: that I would need to learn how to be comfortable with being uncomfortable.\n\nSignaling as a Service\n\nPaid membership\n\nOne of the best books I have read in the last few years is The Elephant in the Brain by Robin Hanson and Kevin Simler. So we think and say that we do something for a specific reason, but in reality, there’s a hidden, selfish motive: to show off and increase our social status.\n\nHorizontal History\n\nTim Urban\n\nMost of us have a pretty terrible understanding of history. Our knowledge is spotty, with large gaps all over the place, and the parts of history we do end up knowing a lot about usually depend on the particular teachers, parents, books, articles, and movies we happen to come across in our lives.\n\nThe Pandemic Has Erased Entire Categories of Friendship\n\nAmanda Mull\n\nA few months ago, when millions of Americans were watching the Netflix series Emily in Paris because it was what we had been given that week, I cued up the first episode and was beset almost immediately by an intense longing.\n\nIs It Really Too Late to Learn New Skills?\n\nMargaret Talbot\n\nAmong the things I have not missed since entering middle age is the sensation of being an absolute beginner.\n\nThe fruits of anger\n\nBrian Wong\n\nAt her speech at the United Nations summit on the impending climate crisis, 16-year-old Greta Thunberg spoke with passion and anger, calling out those who have been apathetic towards bringing about global warming.\n\nRadical Candor — The Surprising Secret to Being a Good Boss\n\nRadical Candor — The Surprising Secret to Being a Good Boss\n\nKim Scott, co-founder of Candor, Inc., has built her career around a simple goal: Creating bullshit-free zones where people love their work and working together.
