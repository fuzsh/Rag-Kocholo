        "text": "Jason Biggs net worth is\n\n$12 Million\n\nJason Biggs Wiki Biography\n\nJason Matthew Biggs was born on 12 May 1978, in Pompton Plains, New Jersey USA of Italian( Sicilian) and English ancestry. He is a famous comic actor, producer, musician and voice actor, possibly most well recognized for his role in the comedy film “American Pie” and its sequels.\n\nJason Biggs Net Worth $22 Million\n\nSo how rich is Jason Biggs really? Sources estimate his current net worth to have reached an impressive amount of $22 million. Most of it has been accumulated from his successful work as an actor and producer.\n\nJason started his acting career at the age of five and appeared in the TV series “Drexell’s Class”. Another significant factor in his growing success as a young actor was his appearance in the Broadway show “Conversations with My Father” at the age of twelve. In the same year, he appeared in the daytime TV series “As the World Turns”, for which he won his first award – Daytime Emmy for Best Younger Actor.\n\nAfter receiving such recognition, Jason decided to take a break from acting and attended New York University in 1996. However, he returned to acting a year later in the independent comedy film “Camp Stories”. In 1999, Jason secured a role in the movie comedy “American Pie”, which was a great breakthrough for his career as the movie gained immense worldwide popularity. For this role, Jason won a Young Hollywood Award and was nominated for two Teen Choice awards and two MTV Movie Awards. The three sequels – “American Pie 2” (2001), “American Wedding” (2003) and “American Reunion” (2012) were not as successful as the first movie, but have definitely contributed to raising Jason’s net worth. During his career, Jason has appeared in several popular TV shows, such as “Will & Grace” in 2005, “Mad Love” in 2011 and “Orange is the New Black” between 2013 and 2014.\n\nJason Biggs also tried to produce his own TV series in 2009, entitled “Happiness isn’t Everything” which unfortunately didn’t take off. Besides being a star of “The American Pie” movies, Jason has appeared in some internet and parody short films over the years, but they did not have a significant influence on his popularity or net worth. Between 2012 and 2014, Jason became the voice of one of the seven ninja turtles, Leonardo in “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” by Nickelodeon, which also might have added to his overall impressive net worth.\n\nJason hasn’t had any film roles since 2012, and in 2014 he decided to return to the Broadway stage. He appeared in “The Heidi Chronicles” as Scoop Rosenbaum in 2015.\n\nIn his personal life, Jason Biggs is married to actress Jenny Mollen. The couple met on the set of the 2008 romantic comedy “My Best Friend’s Girl” and became engaged in the same year. Together they raise a son Sid Biggs who was born in 2014. Jason is known for making controversial jokes concerning some of the most sensitive subjects, which have received differing opinions from the public."
