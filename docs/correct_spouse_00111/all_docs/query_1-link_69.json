        "text": "Introduction:\n\nFor those of you who recently attended public schools, here's what this issue is all about: The uproar over same-sex marriage, criticism of homosexual behavior being treated as hate speech, and transgender people (real or imaginary) using the restroom of their choice, is not primarily about the rights and privileges of homosexuals. It is about the incremental and systematic destruction of all traditions and moral guidelines. This in turn will lead to the abolition of our freedom of religion. If you stand in the way, you will be destroyed. Politicians won't help you. The Left won't, because this is their idea, and the Right won't because they're afraid of what the Left might say about them.\n\nThe most recent controversy in this category is the dispute about whether or not to allow anyone at all to enter the public restroom of his or her choice. Normal people are usually too polite to object when a misguided freak makes a statement by going to a restroom where he or she is not expected to go. But the tiny minority of activists who specialize in this cause are not subtle, and they're not concerned with politeness, because (as mentioned above) simple courtesy and common sense are two of the things they are attempting to break down. Personally, I don't think there are but a few individuals nationwide who have had themselves surgically altered to function as the opposite sex. There are thousands more who, for whatever demonic reason, pretend to be that which they are not. The bathroom flap is about whether or not a man can \"identify\" as a woman, even temporarily, and then go where he wants, and stay there all day if he likes.\n\nSince this page was initiated in September, 2015, the issues at hand have expanded. Now we see not only men in women's restrooms, but merchants being compelled to participate in homosexual weddings, teachers being forced to use bizarre pronouns when addressing mentally-ill students, homosexuals and transvestites demanding to be treated like normal people, and innumerable contortions of the English language to accomodate perverse thinking. And all this weirdness increasingly carries the endorsement of the federal government.\n\nRelated topic: Target boycott\n\nPride Month Recap: What, Exactly, Are You Proud Of? Another Pride Month has come and gone. I'll admit that it was more subdued than it has been in recent years. The specter of Israeli neo-Nazi homophobes throwing Gazan gays off rooftops undoubtedly dampened the festivities. But I'm old enough to remember when Pride was just a parade in the big cities. Then it became a day. Then a week. Now it's a month. Now it's in schools, department stores, fast food chains, and library reading rooms. And if you think it's all going just a tad overboard, you're worse than Hitler. If aliens observed Pride Month from space, one could forgive them for assuming that gays in contemporary America must be the most oppressed group in the history of mankind, hence the necessity of an ever-increasing display of awareness and recognition. But an unfortunate and entirely predictable, phenomenon has occurred in the years since Obergefell and the advent of gays in the military. The oppressed has become the oppressor and gleefully so.\n\nFlorida teen charged with felony for leaving 'donut burnout' skid marks on LGBT pride mural. A Florida teenager was arrested and charged with a felony on Monday after leaving skid marks with his car on a street pride mural. Christian Maier, 18, was charged with felony mischief and racing on a street after surveillance footage caught him doing \"donut burnouts\" with his car on St. Petersburg's \"Progressive Pride Street Mural\" at 3:45 a.m. on May 22, according to the St. Petersburg Police Department. Police said the video showed Maier \"recklessly maneuvering his car in a way to leave several tire marks across the mural and causing significant damage.\"\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nIf you paint a mural in the street, you should expect \"significant damage\" sooner or later. If you don't want your sacred symbols desecrated, don't paint them in the street!\n\nWoman And Her Toddler Are Booted Off A United Airlines Flight For Using The Wrong Pronouns Of A Flight Attendant. A mom has claimed she was booted off a United Airlines flight with her distressed 16-month-old son over using the wrong pronoun for a flight attendant. Jenna Longoria was expecting to fly to Austin from San Francisco on Wednesday with her mom and son when United stopped them from traveling. She alleges she was denied boarding after an 'accidental' mix-up when addressing a United staff member, who she says refused to accept her apology. [Video clip]\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nThis is what civil litigation is for.\n\nThe trans superiority narrative. There is no right to ogle females in locker room and showers, nor is there a right for males to use the same bathrooms as females. There is no right to pretend to be the opposite sex, nor is there a right to force others to share in and praise trans delusions, yet these are among the \"trans rights\" demanded by the narrative. Anyone identifying as trans has no fewer constitutional rights than anyone else, but because they and their enablers think them somehow more evolved, intellectually and morally superior over those of normal sex, their whims, their \"trans rights,\" must take precedence over the rights of others. Their superiority demands society cater to their whims, further trapping them in their delusions, making it more difficult for them, and their enablers, to recognize reality.\n\nWe Can't Do the Work For You. Well, it's better late than never, I suppose. After nearly 60 years of allowing the homosexual agenda to move forward, claiming they just wanted \"equal rights,\" claiming this was a legitimate civil rights issue, people are just now starting to wake up to what's really happening, and I've been getting phone calls, emails and letters from people who are outraged and panicked. You see, \"pride\" parades and festivals, and \"transgender\" \"drag\" events — which not so long ago only happened in the big cities — are now invading small town America, like waves of locusts. The outrage is justifiable, especially considering the targets of all this stuff are our children, and they're no longer even trying to hide that fact. But my question is, \"where have you been all this time?\"\n\nBehold the Monster You Created. [Scroll down] Well, my friends. You miscalculated. You supported the LBGTQ agenda without question when it was being shoved in the noses of uppity Christians. But you have since discovered that what \"love is love\" really means is that mediocre males are allowed to dominate women's sports (and invade their locker rooms) and that you are expected to applaud along.\n\nVIDEO: You can burn an American flag, but if you deface the gay flag, the regime will put you in prison. In America, you can spit on Vietnam veterans, defecate on the US flag, threaten the lives of US Supreme Court Justices, mock Christianity, and burn entire cities to the ground in the name of a career felon. But if you dare to trample on the rainbow flag, oh, there will be serious hell to pay, mister. That's what three teenagers in Washington are finding out the unjust, immoral, and hard way, as they face felony charges for disrespecting the national homo religion. [Advertisement] On Wednesday night, just a few hours after Spokane had given its LGBTQ+++ Pride Mural a fresh coat of paint, three teens made their mark — literally. Ruslan Turko, 19, along with two other underage teenagers, left scooter marks on it. For this most heinous crime against humanity, they were arrested and charged with 1st degree \"malicious mischief,\" a felony that could land them up to 10 years in jail.\n\n16-Year-Old Girl Speaks Out About Having to Share School Restrooms, Locker Rooms With Males. A 16-year-old Minnesota girl forced to share private spaces with males under a public school transgender policy says that girls deserve privacy in their restrooms and locker rooms. \"It's really uncomfortable, because I was in gym class, and I was just about to change, but then I heard this voice, and I was, like, 'That does not sound right.' So, I look, and it's a male,\" said the rising junior at Stewartville High School, who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely on the controversial issue. In 2017, the Minnesota Department of Education issued a toolkit telling school districts to provide transgender students facilities, including bathrooms, locker rooms, and hotel rooms on overnight trips, that are \"consistent with their gender identity.\"\n\nEvery single conservative fear about gay marriage came true. [Thread reader] [#1] Gay marriage is a slippery slope. For years, when conservatives worried that gay marriage could lead to things like polyamory or polygamy, the Left scoffed. [...] [#2] Religious liberty will be harmed. In 2015, Marco Rubio warned that \"we are at the water's edge of the argument that mainstream Christian teaching is hate speech.\" He was roundly mocked by liberals. [...] The Daily Beast accused him of a \"pathetic persecution complex.\" But Rubio was obviously correct. Almost immediately after the Left won on gay marriage, they launched a coordinated campaign to persecute religious Americans who still believed in the traditional definition of marriage. And in many cases, the courts... just let them do it. The victims of this campaign are real people, with real names and faces. Jack Phillips, a Christian baker in Colorado, politely refused to custom-bake a cake endorsing gay marriage. As a result, he's been in court for more than a decade, and has lost 40% of his business. [#3] Christian institutions will be persecuted for their beliefs. [...]\n\nFederal court rules conservative kids have no free speech rights. In a ruling that completely contradicts long standing court rulings that had insisted the first amendment allowed students to wear T-shirts and armbands with whatever political statements they wished, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit on June 9, 2024 ruled that a Massachusetts middle school had the right to censor and ban a 12-year-old boy wearing a shirt that said \"There are only two genders.\" This story is a follow-up of a blacklist story from May 2023. At that time 12-year-old Liam Morrison was forced to leave Nichols Middle School when he refused to remove his T-shirt that said \"There are only two genders.\" He later came to class with the T-shirt shown in the picture to the right, with the words \"only two\" covered with the word \"censored.\" He was once again sent home, and subsequently his parents sued.\n\nDon't Paint Your Religious Symbols on the Street. We live in the weirdest times. Times when you can get arrested for driving in the street but not for trashing schools, libraries, national monuments, or even attacking the police. [Tweet] Over the past few years, cities across America have been painting flags, slogans, symbols, and suchlike on their streets in order to declare their allegiance to various causes, declaring them sacred spaces that cannot be defiled. These sacred spaces have nothing to do with the history of our country, our shared heritage, or anything so tied to America or our culture. In fact, they are usually intended to be in-your-face rejections of the majority culture and to enforce leftist pieties. [Tweet] Painting the streets seems to be an odd flex. On the one hand, streets are very public and thus perfect for offending anybody who disagrees; on the other, streets are streets, which naturally get beat us by multi-ton vehicles with rubber tires and are subject to abuse.\n\nTrans athletes dehumanised by term 'biological male', says Olympics. The International Olympic Committee has been accused by Martina Navratilova of waging a \"1984 version of war on women\" after asking journalists attending this summer's Paris Games not to use terms such as \"born male\" or \"biologically male\" to describe transgender athletes. It argued that such labels were \"dehumanising\" and constituted \"problematic language\". In a 33-page \"Portrayal Guidelines\" document, the IOC have told the 20,000-strong media contingent that \"a person's sex category is not assigned based on genetics alone\" and \"it is always preferable to emphasise a person's actual gender rather than potentially calling their identity into question by referring to the sex category that was registered on their original birth certificate\". Navratilova, the nine-time Wimbledon champion and a consistent voice in upholding the integrity of women's sport, responded witheringly to these statements, saying: \"The IOC has been captured. This is 1984 version of war on women. Total erasure.\"\n\nBiden's Justice Dept prosecutes doctor who blew the whistle on child mutilation at hospital. They're coming for you next: This story provides possibly the best illustratration of the barbarism of the Democratic Party and the Biden administration. Rather than celebrate the courage of Ethan Haim, the doctor who in 2023 blew the whistle on the continuing secret sex change operations being performed on children as young as 11 at Texas Children's Hospital, the Biden Justice Department this week indicted that doctor on four felony charges.\n\nIndictment Of Texas Doctor Who Exposed Kids' [Sex Change Operations] Proves No One Is Safe From Biden's Weaponized DOJ. A Texas-based general surgeon who exposed his Houston children's hospital for secretly continuing a child transgender mutilation program faces four felony counts from President Joe Biden's Department of Justice for speaking out. Shortly after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered his state's Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate the transing of children as abuse in 2022, Texas Children's Hospital — the largest children's hospital in the U.S. — claimed that it would no longer offer chemical castration and other body-butchering services to pediatric patients. As 33-year-old whistleblower Dr. Eithan Haim soon discovered, however, at least three Texas Children's physicians continued to castrate children as young as 11 years old after the program was allegedly halted. The hospital also promoted procedures to cut off the breasts and genitals of physically healthy people. A report, which Haim claims to have sourced, from the City Journal's Christopher Rufo detailed these findings. Around that same time in May 2023, the Texas legislature passed a law banning gender experimentation on minors.\n\nA Dude Has Just Been Crowned Miss Maryland USA. A man has been crowned Miss Maryland USA. Transgender male Bailey Anne has beaten dozens of women to win the prestigious women's pageant title. [Video clip]\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nNobody dares to object.\n\nNHS chiefs face legal action after 26 female nurses protested being forced to share women's changing room with a transgender colleague. NHS chiefs are facing landmark legal action after 26 female hospital nurses protested about being forced to share a women's changing room with a transgender colleague who is biologically male. The women complained that the transgender nurse — who has not had gender reassignment surgery — had taken a 'keen interest' in female staff when they were getting undressed. They say they have found the situation 'intimidating and upsetting'. In a formal complaint, the nurses say they were stunned after the 'sexually active' trans nurse admitted to trying for a baby with a female partner and had stopped taking female hormones. But a human resources manager at the hospital trust allegedly said that the female nurses need to 'be more inclusive', 'broaden their mindset' and 'be educated and attend training'.\n\nNurses Suing NHS Trust After Being Forced to Share Women's Changing Room With Biological Male. NHS chiefs are facing landmark legal action after 26 female hospital nurses protested about being forced to share a women's changing room with a transgender colleague who is biologically male.\n\nScottish Green Party expels members for stating biological truth. The Scottish Green Party recently expelled 13 members for asserting that \"sex is a biological reality.\" The 13 now ex-greenies had the temerity, the gall, shall we say the chutzpah, to sign a declaration stating that biological women were entitled to sex-based rights and protections, and expressing concern that gender critical views were being \"silenced.\" Well, I never! They are lucky they didn't receive the death penalty! The unlucky 13 were ejected because their fellow party members decided that they somehow posed a risk to the \"safety of all trans and non-binary members.\" What about the risk trans and non-binary members demonstrably pose to non-trans and binary members, especially females?\n\nRed State Gov Signs Bill Banning Men From Women's Bathrooms. Men are now barred from using women's public restrooms in Mississippi, the state's governor announced Monday. Republican Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves announced on social media he signed the SAFER Act into law on Monday morning. The law prohibits people in Mississippi from entering restrooms and other sex-exclusive areas in public buildings that do not align with their biological sex, according to the legislative text. \"Today is a win for girls and women across our state, and I was proud to sign SB2753 into law,\" Reeves said. \"You have my word that as long as I'm governor, our state will do everything in its power to keep Mississippi's daughters safe.\" Individuals who enter a bathroom or other sex-exclusive area that does not align with their sex and refuse to leave will be charged with misdemeanor trespassing, according to the law.\n\nMayo Clinic Apologizes For Allowing Professor to Say There Are Only 2 Sexes. It doesn't get much more absurd than this. No, scratch that. It is 2024. We live in a simulation scripted by the Babylon Bee, and those guys are geniuses. It will get more absurd every day. [Advertisement] Dr. Mary O'Connor is so respected by her colleagues that they invited her to speak as the keynote speaker at a Mayo event on the Florida campus. [Tweet] Her work as an orthopedic surgeon and limb reconstructionist helps people every day, and one of her research foci is identifying the differences between male and female responses to disease and treatment. We have been assured for years, and I believe this to be true, that sex differences have been understudied in medicine. For instance, we now know that the presentations of heart disease in men and women can be very different. Apparently this can also be true in orthopedic matters. Who knew?\n\nWhat has Biden accomplished in his presidency? Devastation. Biden and his sycophants in the media sing his praises on a daily basis, pretending he has been an effective president. In fact, all he has accomplished is desecration on every level. [...] The Biden regime also, for reasons that defy understanding, has relentlessly pushed transgenderism and all that that particularly pathetic form of mental illness entails — the mutilation of humans, many of them children. They promulgate this illness as actively as possible, subjecting the majority of traditional Americans, especially female students, to biological males in gyms, bathrooms and competitive sports. These \"mandates,\" which few states are fighting, have destroyed women's sports programs; they have virtually erased female athletes. Women cannot beat biological males in any athletic endeavor. Soon, there will be no girls' sports, only teams of trans men pretending to be female.\n\nScottish Green Party Expels 13 Members for Saying 'Sex Is a Biological Reality'. This is what comes when you close down insane asylums, I suppose. The former inhabitants become world leaders, like Joe Biden, Klaus Schwab, the United Nations, the Scottish Greens, and the Scottish National Party. Oh, and the Democrats. I can't forget them. [...] In today's world, you are on the wrong side of the civil rights issue of our time. A segregationist. A hater. A transphobe. Even a promoter of the genocide of an entire people, bigot! We now live in a world where doctors will give men hormones for the purpose of helping them \"chestfeed\" infants, and write papers seriously arguing that this is right and healthy. People of supposedly sound mind will piously declare that it is medically necessary to surgically remove healthy breasts and castrate children in the name of civil rights. In other words, we are surrounded by criminally insane people, and they are running the asylum. Except there are no asylums anymore, so they run the world instead.\n\nScottish Greens expel 13 members over 'biological sex' declaration. The Scottish Greens have expelled 13 members for signing a declaration which said \"sex is a biological reality\" and called for trans women to be banned from women's changing rooms. The party said those who signed the Scottish Green Women's Declaration were in breach of the party's code of conduct. The declaration states: \"Sex should not be confused with gender. Sex is a biological reality and is both the site of and the excuse for women's oppression.\" It also said that women had the right to \"female-only spaces such as changing rooms, hospital wards, sanitary and sleeping accommodation, refuges, hostels and prisons\".\n\n18 States Fight Federal Trans Agenda on Pronouns, Bathrooms. In response to new federal rules on pronouns and bathrooms based on gender identity, 18 state attorneys general are suing the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The lawsuit, led by Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, a Republican, was filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. \"This end-run around our constitutional institutions misuses federal power to eliminate women's private spaces and punish the use of biologically accurate pronouns, all at the expense of Tennessee employers,\" Skrmetti said in a public statement. The Daily Signal first reported last month that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission published guidance determining that an employer would be guilty of harassment for requiring someone to use a restroom that comports with his or her biological sex, or for referring to someone by a personal pronoun that the person doesn't want used.\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nThe poorly-educated millenial snowflakes don't want specific pronouns used in their presence, but they don't mind hurling the F-bombs and other profanity in your direction.\n\nEducation Secretary Falls Apart When Asked Whether He Would Force His Daughter to Undress in Front of Men. The Biden administration last month announced a revamping of Title IX rules ostensibly intended to protect transgender college students. The move was met with condemnation and lawsuits challenging the new rules. Now, White House officials are in the hot seat, being forced to explain and defend this decision. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona recently gave testimony before the Senate. Sen. Burgess Owens (R-UT) grilled Cardona, asking him whether he would allow his daughter to be forced to deal with biological men in women's space. Naturally, the secretary had trouble answering.\n\nEducation secretary defends policy allowing biological males to use women's bathrooms, locker rooms. Insisting that transgender students have been \"under attack in our country,\" Education Secretary Miguel Cardona defended the newly instituted Team Biden policy which allows biological males to the use women's bathrooms and locker rooms. During a Senate appropriations subcommittee hearing on Tuesday to review the FY2025 budget request for the Department of Education, Cardona presented no evidence that transgender students are actually under attack, but accused those critical of the Biden team's re-writing of Title IX as \"trying to create division.\" The Title IX change, which could take effect Aug. 1, redefines the word \"sex\" to include gender identity. Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith said that curtailing girls' safe spaces could push many of them to give up on athletics. \"Do you agree that they're eliminating those safe spaces when they allow transgenders to choose the bathroom and the locker room that they want to go in?\" Hyde-Smith asked Cardona. \"Senator, we cannot pick and choose which students we want to protect,\" Cardona replied.\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nThe school most certainly DOES \"pick and choose which students [it] want[s] to protect.\" If some kid comes to school with a gun, the school protects every student except the one with the gun. Likewise if a teenager brings a rattlesnake to school, or a bottle of LSD. The school, and the government as a whole, has the duty to protect students from disgusting transvestite perverts. Until about ten years ago, we all agreed on this as a fact.\n\nFeds Demand Employers Use Workers' Preferred Pronouns or Face Punishment. The federal government warned employers that if they don't use workers' preferred pronouns or stop them from using bathrooms that align with their 'gender identity' they will face punishment. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on Monday updated its guidance on workplace harassment to cover transgender, non-binary and other LGBTQ workers. The Democrat-led EEOC voted 2-3 on Friday to update its guidance. Employers can find themselves in court if they do not follow the new anti-bias laws and fail to adhere to the EEOC guidelines.\n\nWe Won't Live By Your Wokeness. A young woman who came to the pregnancy center where I work shared this story with me. She had a pediatrician appointment for her baby girl last week. She brought her infant, dressed all in pink, into the doctor's office. After stating the baby's female name, the doctor asked, \"So, have you decided what gender you're assigning to this child?\" She was stunned. She said she just stood there until the word \"female\" came out of her mouth. This wasn't the first time I've heard this line of questioning in a pediatrician's office. A friend told me her daughter was asked the same thing on her first visit to the doctor's office with their infant son. The question, \"gender assigned at birth\" is now on many medical forms. A man I know was at a new doctors' office and the paperwork included an entire page on \"gender identity.\"\n\nGermany will now fine you $10,000 for \"misgendering\" and allow parents to pick their children's sex at birth. They're really writing it into law that you can choose your baby's sex at birth. And of course this has nothing to do with normal sane people who assign their children the correct sex at birth. It's the crazies who want to immediately throw their boy in a dress, or their girl in a \"chick magnet\" shirt as some sort of sick and twisted science experiment. This law is literally written to protect insane people who are hell bent on creating sociopath children.\n\nPlanet Fitness Founder Admits the Truth: Company Has Pretty Much Been Destroyed. You let perverts go into any locker room they want, and it will destroy your company. The Alaska Planet Fitness isn't the only one that's been having problems with mentally ill individuals going into the locker room of their choice, regardless of their biological gender. North Carolina and other states are seeing the same shit. Now, the founder of Planet Fitness is admitting defeat. [...] You pander to the communist \"woke\" left, and this is what happens. They will happen to any company that bends their knee to the communist Democrat agenda.\n\nColorado's Civil Rights Commission gets schooled on the First Amendment in the wedding website case. Remember the wedding website case that came out of Colorado and went all the way to the Supreme Court? It's finally over, and it ended beautifully. [...] The Colorado Civil Rights Commission decided that Smith's exercise of her First Amendment right to decline to perform services in violation of her religious beliefs, and that her words so stating, were, ironically, in violation of the First Amendment. The Commission said (1) Smith was required to design websites celebrating marriages other than between a man and a woman, and (2) she was prohibited from stating that she wouldn't. Smith sued the Commission in Federal Court. It was a smart move to go to Federal Court because state court would have ensnarled her for years in the swamp of the Democrat-controlled Colorado state judiciary — the one where the state supreme court tossed Donald Trump from the 2024 ballot only to be unanimously overturned by the Supreme Court last winter. The district court dismissed her case on procedural grounds. She appealed to the federal appellate court. They overturned the dismissal on procedural grounds, but, worse, dismissed her case on substantive grounds.\n\nChristian woman says Starbucks fired her for refusing to use transgender people's pronouns: 'It is against my faith to lie'. A Christian woman has come forward to say Starbucks fired her for refusing to use transgender people's pronouns. The woman in question — Taylor Marie Trice of North Carolina — spoke to Sarah Fields of the Publica about her ordeal, which occurred in 2022. Earlier this week, Trice uploaded a video to TikTok discussing what happened: \"June came around, and as we all know, June is the month of 'tasting the rainbow.' And I had been working at Starbucks for about two years at that point. So I was used to Starbucks putting up their [Pride] decorations and stuff during the month of June. And throughout that time, no one had ever made a complaint about me being homophobic, transphobic, whatever.\" Trice added in the clip that she's \"not judging\" her fellow employees but that her stance was, \"I'm just not about to go along with everything you want to do if it doesn't go along with God's word.\"\n\nJoe Biden's winners. The radical wing of the LGBT and pro-abortion communities has seen its deviant ideas forced upon the American public. It is not enough that some (the vast majority of) Americans don't support abortion — up to birth — or children being coerced into gender transition surgeries, or sexual deviancy being presented to children through books advanced in our, ahem, education institutions. These groups are marching forward with their agendas. You and I don't have an opposing view. We're hateful bigots, who must be silenced, fired, or jailed.\n\nThe FBI's Otherwise Illegal Activity. How deeply is law enforcement interfering in the daily lives of American citizens? For example, it was recently reported that the FBI labeled Americans who \"support the biological basis for sex and gender distinction as potential domestic terrorists.\" Then what? What does the FBI, and those who cooperate with the FBI, do to such Americans? Does the FBI label FBI employees who support biology as potential terrorists? Or, is the FBI saying that no FBI employees support the biological basis for sex and gender distinction? The FBI and local police keep their specific actions, methods, and technologies mostly secret; thus, one cannot say with certainty what occurs after the FBI labels a person as a potential domestic terrorist. Americans might study the history of the FBI and local police cooperating with the FBI for hints about what might occur after being labeled as a potential domestic terrorist.\n\nPlanet Fitness stands by decision to allow men in women's locker rooms and warns. Planet Fitness has refused to walk back its decision to ban a member who exposed a 'trans woman' shaving in the female locker room. The statement, which was shared by the Libs of TikTok Twitter account, said although some members may feel uncomfortable sharing facilities, 'This discomfort is not a reason to deny access to the transgender member.' The comments come after Patricia Silva detailed at incident at her Alaska gym where she saw a transgender woman shaving in her locker room.\n\nI won't sacrifice my safety just so a trans woman feels validated. A few years ago I used to go to a small women-only gym. It had a pool, a sauna and a steam room in which all kinds of women used to huddle and chat. Sometimes we would sit in silence, but very often the Jewish Haredi women would like to socialise, asking everyone lots of questions. There were Muslim women too. This was a place they were allowed to come because it was women only. I live in a part of London where mosques are literally next door to synagogues. It is not all perfect and now, of course, social cohesion is currently being tested but there — in the steam, a bunch of us half-naked women, some of whom for reasons of faith meant they could not have gone to the local swimming pool, would have a natter. I often think of that time when wondering how so-called 'progressives', who are intent on ending single-sex spaces, can square that with their valorisation of multiculturalism. If you take away single-sex spaces, you stop some women from some communities being able to participate. It's that simple. All of this is ignored in the arguments about whether trans women — men who identify as women whether they have medically or surgically transitioned or not — can enter women's spaces. This argument grows ever more ludicrous. There is no women's space or activity, from bathrooms to prisons to rape refuges to sports, that some male-bodied people are not lobbying to enter.\n\nTeacher Reportedly Forced To Resign For Not Letting Boy Use Girls' Bathroom. A New York teacher was reportedly forced into early retirement after not allowing a boy to use the girls' bathroom. The beloved educator, known as Mr. C, had been a gym teacher and tennis coach for 37 years. But he resigned from the Elmira Heights Central School District last week after receiving backlash for not allowing a trans-identifying male kindergartner to use the girls' restroom, according to WENY News. When asked if the school board could confirm or deny the incident, Superintendent Michael F. Gill said, \"We do not make comments about any students or staff circumstances.\" However, at a school board meeting Wednesday, Feb. 28, Mr. C was the main topic of conversation. During the meeting, more than a dozen people signed up to speak during the comment portion — some defending Mr. C and others condemning him.\n\nMS Society defends staff who sacked 90-year-old volunteer because she 'asked what pronouns meant' despite furious backlash. The National MS Society has defended firing a 90-year-old volunteer for breaching its diversity and inclusion policy after she asked what pronouns were. Fran Itkoff had served the non-profit for multiple sclerosis patients for 60 years, with her late husband running the Long Beach Lakewood chapter prior to his death. She was left stunned when her bosses forced her to step down on January 19 following an exchange with a colleague who asked her to use her pronouns in an email signatures.\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nHere's how to fix this problem: Never give the National MS Society another dime. Name one charity that was established for the purpose of eradicating a specific disease, that successfully eliminated that disease and then disbanded.\n\nPrivacy Is a Fundamental Value. The administrative class delights in imposing its views on the rest of us, especially when it involves our private lives. Small businesses are made to prepare wedding cakes for gays; young children are forced to study sexual practices from which they ought to be shielded; workers are made to attend classes on DIE in which, if they are white, they are accused of racism and exploitation, even as they are the ones being exploited by racism. We live in a world turned upside-down, and it can only end in chaos. For the woke class that now governs our country, it's not enough that gays and transgenders, now treated as minorities and thus victims, are granted complete equality and full human rights. What they seem to want, and what the administrative class imposes on the rest of us, is superiority and oppression of others who are straight. Everything gays and transgenders demand is granted by administrators, judges, corporate leaders, and politicians who are afraid to refuse them because of the stigma of seeming to be \"anti\"-minority. Even when it imposes harm on the rest of society, the wishes of gays and transgenders come first.\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans Attack Republican Lt. Governor For Defending Women's Bathrooms. For vowing to defend women in North Carolina from men who infiltrate female-designated spaces, something a majority of voters support, North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson was criticized by two Republican gubernatorial candidates in his state. Robinson is also campaigning for governor. Robinson told attendees at a campaign event in the beginning of February that he is committed to keeping men out of women's sports and bathrooms. \"We've already passed a law,\" Robinson said, alluding to the Republican General Assembly's overrides of several vetoes in 2023, \"and if we need to pass another one, we will. We're going to defend women's sports in this state, period.\" The 55-year-old Republican said his commitment to \"defend women in this state\" extends to protecting their bathrooms from anyone of the opposite sex who tries to use them. \"That means if you're a man on Friday night and all of the sudden on Saturday, you feel like a woman and you want to go in the women's bathroom in the mall, you will be arrested — or whatever we got to do to you,\" Robinson said. His pledge was met with a round of cheers.\n\nFormer Kentucky Clerk Ordered to Pay $260,000 in Legal Fees after Refusing to Issue Marriage License to Same-Sex Couples. A former county clerk in Kentucky, Kim Davis, must pay a total of $260,104 in legal fees and expenses to a same-sex couple whom Davis denied a marriage license because of her religious beliefs. The new sum is in addition to the $100,000 in damages a jury ruled Davis must pay to the couple who sued, David Ermold and David Moore. The Davis case gained international notoriety in 2015 when she was jailed for refusing to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple. Davis maintained that she had been faced with a \"seemingly impossible choice\" between following her conscience and losing her freedom. A Democrat and a Christian who was elected to the post of Rowan county clerk in 2014, Davis surged into the spotlight when she refused to issue licenses after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage. After defying a federal court order and losing a string of appeals, she was jailed for five days in 2015.\n\nEast Lansing to pay 6-figure settlement in Country Mill farmers market lawsuit. The city will pay about $42,000 in damages and another $783,800 to cover the legal costs of a vendor who sued the city for excluding him from the city's farmers market because of his religious beliefs. The terms of the settlement in favor of Country Mill Farms and its owner, Stephen Tennes, were disclosed in a final judgement entered Friday in U.S. District Court. The order, signed by Judge Paul Maloney, includes a permanent injunction preventing the city from finding Tennes in violation of its vendor guidelines for declining to host same-sex weddings.\n\nVA Supreme Court Revives Lawsuit by Teacher Fired for Not Using Trans Student's Pronouns. Virginia's Supreme Court has revived a lawsuit filed by a high school teacher who was fired for refusing to use a transgender student's preferred pronouns. The court's action happened on Thursday [12/14/2023], according to the Washington Post. [...] In a social media post on Thursday evening, the Babylon Bee's Seth Dillon shared his thoughts on the issue, writing, \"Cases like these prove that they aren't just 'preferred' pronouns. They're mandatory.\"\n\nThe Obnoxiously Gay Come for Abilene Christian University. [T]his is precisely the same play we've seen run again and again by the obnoxiously gay. This is the same pressure campaign they bring against the Christian bakers, florists, wedding planners, and others who refuse to service gay weddings and trans \"gender reveals\" out of allegiance to their faith. Finding a florist willing to decorate a gay wedding is painfully easy to do, and yet the obnoxiously gay will seek out those conscientious objectors in the culture war and demand they be conscripted for frontline action. With a penalty of millions of dollars in legal defense fees for those who stand against the obnoxiously gay. We can all agree this is obnoxiously gay, can we not?\n\nGlobalists Fear the Unconquerable. State-controlled news media blare continuous warnings that citizens should fear racism, \"white supremacy,\" misogyny, imperialism, colonialism, paternalism, Christianity, Israel, hydrocarbon energy, heterosexuality, capitalism, exercise, Karens, Chads, Western civilization, personal liberty, country music, Southern states, suburban moms, political speech, scientific debate, masculinity, democratic elections that don't elect Democrats, Donald Trump, limited government, nuclear families, gun-toting Americans, psychologically healthy adults, Christmas decorations, assimilation, accurate history, cultural appropriation, national borders, due process for conservatives, misinformation, malinformation, disinformation, and stable marriages. On the flip-side, the atheistic priests of the \"woke\" church insist that opposition to either gay pseudo-marriage or the new fad of \"transgenderism\" represents some kind of irrational \"phobia\" that must be overcome immediately. In other words, the new world order demands that Westerners fear almost everything except bearded men crushing women half their size in competitive sports. Talk about lunacy!\n\nWe must be free to call this man a man. Even if someone looks like a man, talks like a man and actually is a man, you can now get yourself in trouble if you refer to him as a man. That's the take-home message of last week's social-media bust-up over Melissa Poulton, previously known as Matthew Viner. Poulton is a transwoman who has been selected as the Green Party's candidate for Bromsgrove in the next UK General Election. He describes himself as a 'proud lesbian'. Last week, Rachel Maclean, the MP for Redditch and deputy chair of the Conservative Party, shared a post on X that referred to Poulton as a 'man who wears a wig'. 'While the Greens don't know what a woman is, my Worcestershire neighbours, the people of Bromsgrove, certainly do', Maclean added. Poulton was then invited on to BBC News Midlands to respond to Maclean's comments. He called them 'transphobic', 'dog-whistling' and 'gaslighting'. During the interview, Poulton insisted on describing himself as a 'queer woman... with transgender experience'.\n\nCalifornia Will Soon Fine Stores That Don't Have A 'Gender Neutral' Kids Toy Section. A new California law slated to go into effect on January 1, 2024, will mandate stores that sell children's items to have a gender neutral section, according to a state government website. The law applies to stores that sell \"childcare items\" or toys and employs a minimum of 500 employees across store locations, and it requires that they offer a section where \"a reasonable selection of the items and toys for children that it sells shall be displayed, regardless of whether they have been traditionally marketed for either girls or for boys,\" according to its text. Stores that do not comply with the law could face a civil penalty and charged $250 after the first offense or $500 for later offenses.\n\nOntario Museum Scrubs Female Powerlifter From Exhibit Following Her Calls For Fairness In Women's Sports. A museum in London, Ontario, has removed a female powerlifter from an exhibit on resilience in apparent retaliation for her vocal opposition to males participating in women's sports. April Hutchinson said the move quickly followed her suspension from the Canadian Powerlifting Union. Launched in October at the Museum London, the exhibition, titled \"Resilient London: Meet Your Neighbours,\" was intended to be an inspiration for the community and featured a diverse panel of locals alongside obstacles they had overcome. Hutchinson was featured not just as a local athlete, but also as a survivor of addiction.\n\nMy Journey from Frustration to Outrage to Seething Anger. I have seething anger about the takeover of K-12 education by leftist teacher unions and school boards that indoctrinate children during their formative years in racism, victimhood, and LGBTQ++ matters, denounce mainstream culture and religion, and tear down the family structure, all while blocking parents from knowing. I have moved from frustration to outrage about so-called \"trans\" movement's overtaking society (although fewer than 3 in 1,000 even meet the traditional psychiatric definition for gender dysphoria) under the LGBTQ++ rainbow banner, requiring us to pretend along with the lie under penalty of social ostracism. I am outraged at forcing women to open their private spaces to men and the unequal physical competition in women's sports that occurs, all while everyone is expected to act as if it is normal. This is kangaroo court territory, where we are forced to repeat, under penalty of punishment, an obvious lie that there are more than two genders and that a man who announces he is a woman is, in fact, a woman.\n\nMaternity hospital downgraded over use of term 'mother'. A maternity hospital received a low grade on a diversity assessment because staff only use the term \"mother\" when discussing maternity leave, The Telegraph can disclose. The Cambridge University Hospital Trust, which manages a maternity hospital called the Rosie, lost points because staff use the term \"mother\" when referring to the policies it had in place regarding paid leave, instead of broadening it to include gender-neutral alternatives. The report was carried out by the NHS' \"Rainbow Badge\" scheme, which assesses hospitals based on how they treat LGBT patients. The trust also lost points for not providing staff with guidance on what trans and non-binary employees should wear, pointing out how the trust's \"trans inclusion policy\" did not provide \"guidance on the dress code for trans employees, including non-binary employees.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court won't allow Florida to enforce its new law targeting drag shows during appeal. The Supreme Court said Thursday it will not allow Florida to enforce its new law targeting drag shows, while a court case proceeds. The justices refused to narrow a lower-court order that has prohibited the law from being enforced statewide. Florida had asked the court to allow its anti-drag show law to be enforced everywhere except at the Hamburger Mary's restaurant in Orlando, which challenged the law's constitutionality. Three justices, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, said they would have granted the state's request. Last month, a panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's order stopping the law from being enforced. The district court found that the law likely restricted free speech and couldn't be enforced anywhere in the state.\n\nNew 'Orwellian' HHS pronoun mandate forces employees to 'deny reality,' violate law: legal expert. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has rolled out a new gender pronoun policy that one Heritage Foundation expert and former HHS official says violates employee rights and will result in firings for \"misgendering.\" \"HHS and the federal government is requiring its employees to speak falsehoods,\" Roger Severino, the Heritage Foundation's vice president for domestic policy and the former head of civil rights at HHS during the Trump administration, told Fox News Digital. Severino first broke the story on X, formerly Twitter, last week. He wrote that HHS \"imposed a transgender pronoun mandate on its employees who will now be forced to deny biological realities with their own words or face firing\" and he included a screenshot of an email sent to employees at the department.\n\nIt is a miracle: Hawaiian court has determined that boys and girls are different. ...and it has absolutely nothing to do with idiotically forcing girls to compete with boys in sports and forcing them to be exposed to penises in the locker room. [...] So females were forced to train for water polo in the dangerous ocean instead of a pool. Somehow, it appears they recognized girls aren't as strong as boys. And they also forced girls to go to a Burger King to change clothes or go to the bathroom, or go under the bleachers to change while boys had their own locker room. Why didn't they just share the space since we are told that essentially there is no difference? After all, your sex, according to Democrats, is determined by how you feel and not by your body parts. Now, when will all states in the country stop forcing women and girls to compete with biological males? Democrats claim they are the party for women but every day they show it is not true by forcing them to compete and share spaces with men who only pretend they are women. Democrats claim they believe women should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies but they forced them to take a vaccine or get fired, too. Now maybe the nonsense of all these positions will be clearer in public minds with this court ruling.\n\nTrump-Appointed Federal Judge Rules Colorado Can't Exclude Preschool From Funding Program Over Religious Stances. A federal judge ruled Saturday [10/21/2023] that Colorado can't exclude a Christian school from the state's universal preschool program based on its religious beliefs. Darren Patterson Christian Academy filed a lawsuit in June after state officials said participation in the universal preschool program required hiring employees who are not Christians and changing a school policy requiring the use of bathrooms and pronouns that correspond with biological sex. U.S. District Judge Daniel Domenico issued a preliminary injunction Saturday blocking the state from excluding the school from the program, which provides four-year-olds and some other children in the state with a minimum of 15 free hours of free preschool a week, based on \"protected beliefs.\" \"Indeed, exclusion of a preschool is inherently anti-universal, and denying participation based on one's protected beliefs or speech is not equitable,\" Domenico, a Trump appointee, wrote.\n\nHHS employees who resist Biden's transgender pronoun mandate will be fired. After alerting the public last week to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) newly issued transgender pronoun mandate, Roger Severino, the former director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights during the Trump administration, has published the document online after HHS failed to make it public, refusing even to disclose the policy to Congress. The \"Gender Identity Non-Discrimination and Inclusion Policy for Employees and Applicants\" requires HHS' 80,000 employees to affirm transgender and non-binary coworkers' self-proclaimed \"identity,\" no matter what his or her conscience might dictate.\n\nSchool Directs Trans-Averse Teens to Private Restroom, Charges Them With 'Harassment' When They Line Up. These days, harassment isn't hard to commit. One quick ticket to Tormenter Town may await in a lavatory line. Such is illustrated by a story out of Illinois. The Waterloo Community Unit School District Five (WCUSD5) doesn't deal in sexual absolutes; penises and vaginas may belong to women and men, respectively. Therefore, on May 15th, the system invited enrollees to the restroom of their choice. Per the \"Use of Restroom Facilities and Other Gender Identities\" policy, students can use the opposite-sex facility if they meet a crop of criteria: [...] Why is a school district involving itself in such issues? The answer, it would seem, is that education has evolved. Government schools aim toward social goals in lieu of merely academic ones. But make no mistake — WCUSD5 has made space for those so old-fashioned as to prefer sex-specific latrines. Or, at least, it had.\n\nLoudoun County sexual assault victim files $30 million lawsuit against school board. The Loudoun County student who was sexually assaulted in a high school restroom filed a $30 million federal lawsuit against the school district. The girl, who is a minor and used a pseudonym in the filing, was 15 years old when a male student in a skirt sexually abused her in a bathroom at Stone Bridge High School on May 28, 2021. Loudoun County Public Schools is accused of failing to take the warnings about the male student seriously and covering up the assault. The lawsuit is filed as a breach of Title IX. \"It's been a very long two and a half years for my family to get here. We have put together a very strong Title IX lawsuit that we hope sets precedence across the nation to protect children and hold school districts accountable,\" Scott Smith, the girl's father who is also a plaintiff in the case, told WJLA.\n\nAnglican Deacon Calvin Robinson Wins Legal Settlement After Getting Fired For Opposing Drag Queen Story Hour Session. Calvin Robinson, an Anglican deacon and British political commentator, won a legal settlement against the Royal Academy of Dance (RAD) after they removed him from their education sub-committee over his opposition to a drag queen story hour session, according to the Daily Mail. Robinson filed a lawsuit that alleged harassment and discrimination by RAD over his Christian beliefs, the Daily Mail reported. \"I am pleased that the bullies did not win and that they have learnt you cannot push people out for holding traditional views — Christian views,\" Robinson told the outlet Sunday.\n\nPennsylvania high school students organize walkout to protest trans bathroom rule. Hundreds of students from Pennsylvania's Perkiomen Valley School District walked out of class Friday after the local school board failed to enact a policy requiring transgender students to use the restroom corresponding with their biological sex. \"Kids were upset. Girls... we wanted to protect them. They were upset. They didn't want men in their bathroom,\" John Ott, who organized the walkout, told FOX News on Monday. His mother Stephanie accused the district of only protecting transgender students and not looking at the \"whole picture.\"\n\nWhat the Left Did to Our Country. Suddenly, there are three genders, not two. Women's sports have been wrecked by biological men competing as women, destroying a half-century of female athletic achievement. Young girls in locker rooms, co-eds in sororities, and women in prison must dress and shower with biological men transitioning to women by assertion.\n\nRetired social worker, 73, is quizzed in her own home by hate-crime police for taking a photo of a STICKER. Police officers quizzed a pensioner in her home on suspicion of a hate crime after she stopped in the street to take a photo of a sticker which said: 'Keep males out of women-only spaces.' The sticker had been placed on to a LGBT+ pride poster which had the slogan Stand By Your Trans. Officers told the 73-year-old retired social worker that she had been identified from CCTV footage. The woman told The Mail on Sunday she was 'in a state of shock' when officers arrived at her door. The incident [...] comes after fury over police forces failing to send officers to investigate burglaries and other serious crimes.\n\nJudge Refuses to Define 'Woman,' Dismisses Lawsuit by Sorority Sisters Who Sought to Block Man from Joining. A judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by six University of Wyoming Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority sisters seeking to block a trans-identifying male from joining. The sorority sisters will now be forced to accommodate Artemis Langford (whose given name is Dallin), a 6'2\", 260-pound man who believes he is a woman. Wyoming U.S. District Court Judge Alan Johnson, after hearing allegations of sexual deviancy on Langford's part, ultimately dismissed the case on Friday and stated that redefining \"woman\" to include males was \"Kappa Kappa Gamma's bedrock right as a private, voluntary organization — and one this Court may not invade.\" Johnson notably used Langford's preferred she/her pronouns in his decision and repeatedly referred to Langford as a \"transgender woman.\"\n\n[The] Colorado Supreme Court [has been] Asked To Find for Christian Baker After SCOTUS Ruling. The Alliance Defending Freedom has asked the Colorado Supreme Court to find in favor of a Christian baker who refused to make \"a custom-designed cake, pink on the inside and blue on the outside, to reflect and celebrate a gender transition.\" The dispute before the Colorado Supreme Court is whether the state can, under the guise of combatting discrimination, compel the baker to create custom artistic messages with which he disagrees. Legal Insurrection has extensively covered this dispute, which recently saw the baker lose an appeal over his refusal to bake the gender transition celebration cake. The bakery, Masterpiece Cakeshop, has been embroiled in a decade-long dispute with Colorado officials who accuse baker Jack Phillips of violating the state's anti-discrimination law by refusing to make custom cakes celebrating LGBT activity.\n\nWhy Jordan Peterson matters. Unwavering free speech heroes are hard to come by when the Left is silencing their messages on social media, in entertainment, in the news, on campuses and even on the streets. But Dr. Jordan Peterson is willing to go to jail before he will allow his speech to be interfered with, especially as it pertains to pronoun use and trans \"misgendering.\" He will not refer to a man in drag as \"she\" and he refuses to use the \"proper\" pronouns for a woman who claims to be a man. [...] Peterson lost his tenured job at the University of Toronto because he dared to swim across the deadly current of political correctness regarding pronouns. It is to his credit that he is now reaching millions more people online with his cultural, political, theological, and environmental opinions than he could ever have hoped to reach in the classroom.\n\nCourage Is A Christian's Only Path Forward From The Legal Hell The 'Winsome' Gospel Wrought. 303 Creative has finally been decided, and Christians — and all Americans — won. In a 6-3 landmark decision on Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that graphic designer Lorie Smith can't be compelled to affirm values that conflict with her deeply held religious beliefs about marriage by designing wedding websites for same-sex couples. As we celebrate this victory — and we all should because, as the majority rightly stated, \"The First Amendment's protections belong to all, not just to speakers whose motives the government finds worthy\" — it's worth reflecting on how we got here. Smith isn't the only one to have fought this battle, and she won't be the last. Life-destroying left-wing lawfare came for cake artist Jack Phillips and florist Barronelle Stutzman all the same.\n\nFour Ways the Deep State Betrays Americans. A federal judge ruled that a student's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights were not violated when school administrators ordered him to remove a shirt with printed text saying, \"There are only two genders.\" The Obama judge concluded that \"the shirt invades the rights of others.\" The freethinking boy was later ordered to remove another t-shirt that read, \"There are censored genders.\" [...] While the (in)justice system punished the young rebel for possessing a working brain, the seventh-grader pointed out that his school allows posters covered in rainbow flags and encouraging students to \"rise up to protect\" the trans agenda — messages that target his personal beliefs. Sorry, son, free speech protections in America exist only for special people.\n\nCatholic employee fired after putting 'assigned by God' as his 'pronouns' in company profile. A Catholic software engineer was fired by his former employer for putting \"Assigned by God\" as his \"preferred pronouns,\" an act which was precedented by pressure from the company to display \"gender identity\" in the name of \"inclusion.\" Chad Scharf, who used to work as the Vice President for Software Engineering at the password management company Bitwarden, lost his job for refusing to violate his religious beliefs by endorsing gender ideology, according to a lawsuit filed at the end of May.\n\nSupreme Court rejects appeal from religious college disputing transgender dorm rooms. The Supreme Court rejected an appeal on Tuesday from a Christian college in Missouri that sued the Biden administration over a requirement to open dorm rooms and shared shower spaces to members of the opposite sex. The College of the Ozarks asked the justices to block the Department of Housing and Urban Development directive that added \"gender identity\" to the definition of \"sex\" in the 1968 Fair Housing Act.\n\nFemale-Only Spa With Compulsory Nudity Must Admit 'Transgender Women' With Penises: Judge. A spa that for years has only served women must admit men with penises if they claim to be women, a judge has ruled. The constitutional rights of the owners, employees, and patrons of the Olympus Spa in Washington state were not infringed when officials in the state ordered the facility to provide services to \"transgender women\" with male genitalia, Washington District Court Judge Barbara Jacobs Rothstein said in a June 5 ruling. The spa was described by its owners, who are Christian, as being designed based on the belief that \"a male and a female should not ordinarily be in each other's presence while in the nude unless married to each other,\" according to a complaint filed by the owners. Many services provided by the spa require patrons to be fully naked, and the employees who work on-site are all female.\n\nReporter Confronts KJP On Men In Women's Locker Rooms Possibly Driving Up Suicide Rates. A White House reporter confronted White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre about suicide rates increasing among young girls as school administrators allow males in women's locker rooms. Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley suggested school administrators allowing males into women's locker rooms drives up suicide rates during a Sunday CNN town hall with Jake Tapper. Haley said, \"My daughter ran track in high school. I don't even know how I would have that conversation with her. How are we supposed to get our girls used to the fact that biological boys are in their locker rooms? And then we wonder why a third of our teenage girls seriously contemplated suicide last year. We should be growing strong girls, confident girls.\"\n\n[An] Oklahoma Mother Files [a] Lawsuit Against [a] School District After [her] Daughter [was] \"Severely Beaten\" by [a] Transgender Student. A mother in Oklahoma has filed a lawsuit against Edmond Public Schools after her teenage daughter was allegedly severely beaten by a transgender student in the girls' bathroom. The incident, which took place at Edmond Memorial High School on October 26, 2022, allegedly involved a 15-year-old girl, referred to as \"E.G.,\" being severely beaten by a 17-year-old transgender student. The lawsuit, filed last Thursday by Theresa Gooden, claims that the accused attacker, assigned male at birth, used the girls' restroom in violation of a state law signed in May 2022. The law stipulates that public school students must use restrooms corresponding to the sex stated on their birth certificates.\n\nKansas Legislature Passes Sex-Segregated Bathroom Bill, Overriding Democratic Governor's Veto. Republicans in the Kansas Legislature obtained the necessary two-thirds supermajority needed to overturn Democratic Governor Laura Kelly's veto of a bill that requires Kansans to use public restrooms that correspond to their sex. The law will reinforce that \"distinctions between the sexes\" in such spaces advances \"the important governmental objectives of protecting the health, safety and privacy,\" the bill reads. \"We want to have safety,\" Republican state representative Brenda Landwehr, told the Associated Press. Last Thursday, Governor Kelly vetoed a raft of bills passed by the Republican-controlled legislature concerning the transgender community, including legislation requiring that people use locker rooms and public facilities that correspond to their sex.\n\nJudge Forces Sorority Girls To Disclose Identities To Stop Disturbing 'Trans' Male From Moving Into Their House. A U.S. district court judge ordered University of Wyoming sorority sister plaintiffs to reveal their names in a lawsuit against Kappa Kappa Gamma's University of Wyoming chapter for allowing a transgender-identifying man to be inducted. According to local news, \"The six sorority sisters sued the Kappa Kappa Gamma's parent organization, its president and the school's first transgender sorority member late last month in a closely watched case. They alleged that the sorority did not follow its bylaws and rules, failed to uphold its mission, breached its housing contract with members, and misled them by admitting a transgender student.\" The plaintiffs filed the suit anonymously as \"Jane Does\" and assigned the pseudonym \"Terry Smith\" to the trans-identifying sorority member.\n\nStreet preacher threatened with jail time after citing Bible verses against local Oklahoma LGBTQ organization. An outspoken street preacher is appealing to the Oklahoma Supreme Court after he was slapped with a five-year restraining order that threatened him with jail time if he speaks out in opposition against a local LGBTQ advocacy group. Rich Penkoski, a pastor who heads up the online organization Warriors for Christ and has protested drag shows for children nationwide, told Fox News Digital that he believes the restraining order is unconstitutional and could herald a legal precedent that could chill the speech of Christians and others. \"I've been preaching against this kind of stuff for years when it first started in libraries,\" he said of drag queen story time for children. \"We've been telling people it's going to get worse if we don't do anything, and that's where we are.\" Penkoski said he was invited by a church in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, to preach outside a local Pride event last fall after other local churches failed to speak out against it.\n\nCanadian Bill Seeks to Criminalize Protests of LGBTQ+ Activities, Impose $25K Fine. A bill introduced in the Ontario, Canada, legislature this week would ban protests and criticism of LGBT activities within a designated 100-meter \"safety zone.\" Bill 94, titled the \"Keeping 2SLGBTQI+ Communities Safe Act,\" indicates it would establish \"community safety zones\" designated by the Attorney General prohibiting \"persons from performing an act of intimidation\" within 100 meters of said zone. According to the bill, such \"acts of intimidation\" include \"causing a disturbance,\" \"distributing hate propaganda,\" \"uttering threats or making offensive remarks, either verbally or in writing with respect to matters of social orientation or gender roles,\" and \"engaging in a protest or demonstration for the purpose of furthering the objectives of homophobia and transphobia.\"\n\nChaplain awarded £10k after NHS Trust said diversity 'takes precedence' over religious belief. A Catholic chaplain who lost his job has been awarded £10,000 after the NHS Trust he worked for claimed that equality and diversity \"take precedence over religious belief\". Rev. Dr Patrick Pullicino, 73, launched legal action against an NHS trust after claiming that he was ousted for answering a hospital patient's questions about the Church's teaching on marriage. Rev Pullicino was pursuing a claim against the Trust for harassment, religious discrimination and victimisation. A trial was set to take place in July at Croydon Employment Tribunal. However, the London NHS Trust, which denies that it has discriminated against him, settled the case by awarding him £10,000 in compensation \"for perceived injury to feelings\". The figure falls within the middle band of guidelines for \"serious\" cases of discrimination.\n\nGoalie declines to wear jersey celebrating LGBTQ community on Pride Night, takes heat. The San Jose Sharks recently hosted a Pride Night celebration, as nearly all professional sports teams have done. Moreover, they tweeted pride-themed information throughout the game. Yet this was not enough to please the ungrateful mob that constitutes the hard-core activists in the LGBTQ community. You see, one player, Sharks goalie James Reimer, declined to don a rainbow-colored jersey, citing his \"religious beliefs.\" [...] Why should a professional athlete be mandated to wear a jersey celebrating any group other than the team for which he or she plays? Yet, Reimer — and a handful of other NHL players who have chosen not to wear pride-themed jerseys this season — have been the victims of vitriolic attacks from many of those who otherwise routinely plead for \"acceptance,\" \"tolerance,\" and \"inclusion.\" Transgender activists, in particular, can be brutal to those who have the audacity to believe in the existence or primacy of just two sexes or genders.\n\nHotel sexual assaults skyrocket as predators given access to women's rooms in horrifying trend: law firm. Horrifying cases of women being raped in their rooms at top hotel chains are taking place because staff are allegedly handing over keys to sexual predators unchecked, The [New York] Post can reveal. Two separate cases in Texas claim men broke into women's rooms after lying to staff to obtain keycards. In an even more shocking incident, one man was allegedly able to convince police and hotel staff to deliver his victim to his own room at a Hilton-owned property. One alleged unwanted entry was only foiled when a quick thinking woman slammed a door on an intruder's hand — severing his finger clean off in the process.\n\nJiggery-Pokery Wokery. The woke love to destroy whatever they touch — culture, infrastructure, social cohesion, rational thought. To be woke is to embrace chaos and injury as a philosophy. From an anthropological perspective, wokeism is fascinating because its practitioners believe they are creative freethinkers while they act as lobotomized sheep. Whatever the woke wizards posing as priests tell their needy followers, the woke herds accept as truth. [...] If deception, violence, and obedience are all part of the woke creed, then contradiction is its life-force. [...] We must believe all women unless those women are speaking out against men pretending to be women — in which case, we must first believe all men pretending to be women, no matter how much they do not appear to be women at all. Biological sex is nothing more than a social construct, yet a man who wears a dress and wig and demands society treat him as he desires is somehow a demonstration of objective reality. Women's and men's sports divisions and the separation of their locker rooms recognize the reality that women and men are physically different, yet physically different men who mentally pretend to be women are miraculously physically indistinguishable from women and should be allowed to compete against them. Furthermore, any woman who objects to the imposition of men competing in her sport or undressing in her locker room is bigoted for acknowledging a fact out loud that can no longer be acknowledged as politically correct. Science demands that reality be based on emotion.\n\nChristian cop, 19, says he was pressured into resigning from Georgia PD after writing on Facebook that 'there's no such thing as homosexual marriage'. A now former police officer in Georgia believes he was pressured into quitting his job because of warnings from his superiors over his views on gay marriage. Jacob Kersey, 19, resigned from the department in Port Wentworth, just a few miles outside Savannah, after refusing to remove a post on Facebook regarding gay marriage and his Christian faith. Kersey - who joined the department at a young age in part because he was inspired by how they would 'bring peace' to his 'broken home' growing up - wrote in the post: 'God designed marriage. Marriage refers to Christ and the church. That's why there's no such thing as homosexual marriage.'\n\nGeorgia Police Officer Put on Leave Over Social Media Post Defending Natural Marriage. [Scroll down] [A] lot of women today are backing constraints and controls on conservative men like Kersey. They wave around rainbow-colored signs and chant about tolerance and diversity. I want to say something to these women. Do you understand that marriage-minded men are not liberal men? Liberal men support abortion, which means they think that killing babies is a good way to keep the good times rolling for the selfish adults. This attitude is not marriage-ready. Liberal men want to redefine marriage and support surrogacy, which means they don't understand that children need their mom AND their Dad. You can't marry someone who thinks that children are just accessories for adult happiness. So, if young women want to persecute and intimidate men with character, they should not be surprised when they find themselves single and alone in their old age. Liberal men are filth. And you can't marry them.\n\nFlashers, Peeping Toms, and the Men Invading Women's Locker Rooms. In 2020, 54-year-old Michigander Steven Pastoor was finally nabbed. He had been dubbed the \"Cascade Flasher,\" confessing to having exposed his genitals to unsuspecting victims for decades. He eventually targeted one woman in particular, who set up a camera to catch him in the act. The police made a hasty arrest. \"We take this crime very seriously,\" the police said. Indeed, the law certainly allowed a serious penalty for the extent of his crimes, which could range from one day in prison to life in prison, the Detroit News reported. But in the end, a seemingly repentant Pastoor pleaded guilty to just three counts of aggravated indecent exposure, which is a \"two-year high court misdemeanor.\" He claimed to have been sexually abused as a teenager by an older family friend (suffering that went curiously undisclosed until he faced the prospect of a long prison stint), and that this was the root of his sexual deviancy.\n\nAppeals Court Upholds Florida High School \"Separating School Bathrooms Based on Biological Sex\". The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting en banc (all judges on the court) has upheld Florida's St. John'a County school policy of separating bathrooms based on biological sex, rejecting a challenge by a \"transgender male\" who was denied the opportunity to use the boy's bathroom. The district provided sex-based (boys and girls) bathrooms as well as single-user gender neutral bathrooms. While the headlines about the decision refer to a \"transgender bathroom policy,\" in fact it's much simpler than that, what the court referred to as the \"nearly universal practice of separating school bathrooms based on biological sex.\"\n\nThis Is What's Following Your Daughters Into The Women's Bathroom. Thanks to the satanic trans laws whacko liberal states like Washinton and California, freaks like this guy who claim to be a woman can use the lady's room and there is nothing anyone can do about it. You'll even be deemed a hater and transphobe if you try to protect your wife or daughter from this creep.

Refusing to respect the Constitution; the Church Amendment, which protects the conscience rights of doctors; or a 2016 court case brought by a religious hospital and more than 20,000 health care professionals, the Biden administration maintains it has sufficient authority to punish groups that don't perform gender \"transition\" surgery and abortions. Following a pathway blazed by President Obama's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 2016, rejecting conscience objections, the Biden administration breathed new life into the left's open season on religious hospitals and physicians. Open season was initially closed because the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty stepped in to swiftly secure a preliminary injunction against the original rule in 2016. After all, the original HHS rule violated the Administrative Procedures Act and likely violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Confirming this analysis, on January 21, 2021, a district court ruled in favor of Catholic groups contesting the HHS rule. Hence, the transgender rule was blocked from taking effect. This decision was upheld on appeal to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals on December 10, 2022. Additional litigation is possible because HHS refuses to take no for an answer.\n\nGay-friendly restaurant refuses to serve Christians — What happened to \"bake the cake, bigot\"? In the recent oral arguments of 303 Creative v. Elenis, our newest Supreme Court justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, concocted a hypothetical situation as she grilled lawyers representing a Christian website owner that doesn't build websites for same-sex marriages. In Jackson's make-believe scenario, an old Christian lady named Helen started a business called \"Grandma Helen's Protestant Provisions\" and, as the name implies, catered only to Protestant Christians. Jackson pressed attorney Kristen Waggoner whether Helen could deny non-Protestants her food. Waggoner did an honorable job explaining to the esteemed justice that she was comparing apples and oranges. In Jackson's scenario, Helen isn't engaging in speech, and compelling her to serve everyone isn't government-compelled speech. In the case of the website company, it is clearly an example of compelled speech if the government forces a Christian to create something that celebrates a sinful act.\n\nFederal Court Blocks Biden Rule That Forces Christian Doctors To Perform Sex Change Surgeries. A federal appeals court has permanently blocked a rule coming from the Biden administration's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) which demanded that religious doctors perform sex change surgeries in violation of their beliefs. The eighth circuit's decision comes months after the fifth circuit issued an opinion in August 2022 in Texas that struck down a reading of the Affordable Care Act which would require every doctor to provide sex change surgeries regardless of religious conviction. Friday's decision affirmed this August opinion.\n\nTom Cotton Confronts Kroger CEO Over Employees Fired For Refusing To Wear LGBT Pride Symbols. Republican Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton confronted Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen on Nov. 29 after he suggested Republicans help save businesses while Democrats impose heavy regulations. Cotton spoke during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the proposed merger between the Kroger and Albertsons grocery chains, and said companies shouldn't inject themselves into cultural issues only to ask conservatives for help later on. \"I've cautioned [Big Tech companies] for years, that if they silence conservatives and center-right voters ... if they discriminate against them in their company, they probably shouldn't come and ask Republican senators to carry the water for them whenever our Democratic friends want to regulate them or block their mergers,\" Cotton said during the hearing.\n\nJustice Gorsuch Accuses Colorado of Forcing Christian Baker to Undergo 'Reeducation Program'. Justice Gorsuch slammed the State of Colorado on Monday for forcing a Christian baker to undergo a \"reeducation program\" after he refused to create a custom cake celebrating a same-sex marriage on the grounds that it violated his religious convictions. The comment came during opening arguments before the Supreme Court on a case involving a Christian web designer who said she would refuse to produce a personalized website advertising a same-sex wedding if a client came to her seeking such a site. In 2018, the Court handed a narrow victory to cake artist Jack Phillips in Masterpiece Cakeshop, ruling that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission acted with unusual religious animus in 2012 when it ordered Phillips and his staff to receive anti-discrimination training. However, the decision did not make a major judgment on the compelled speech issue at the heart of the case, which the Court is finally expected to address in the 303 Creative case currently before it.\n\nSupreme Court weighs web designer's refusal to work on same-sex weddings. Conservative Supreme Court justices on Monday appeared sympathetic toward an evangelical Christian web designer's bid to avoid working on same-sex weddings as they weighed the latest clash between religious conservatives and LGBTQ rights. But after two-and-a-half hours of arguments that included a broad array of tough hypothetical questions directed at both sides, involving far-fetched scenarios like a \"Black Santa\" at a shopping mall refusing to serve children dressed in Ku Klux Klan outfits, it is unclear how exactly the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, will rule. Lorie Smith, who opposes same-sex marriage on religious grounds and runs a business in Colorado designing websites, is seeking an exemption from a state law that outlaws discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in public accommodations.\n\nCatholic Bishops Gave Biden A Pass In 2020 And Now Christians Are Paying For It. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) meets this week to elect a new president. Relations with Washington top the agenda. Stalking those relations is the reality that the USCCB compromised itself two years ago to facilitate the presidential candidacy of Joe Biden. Now it is caught in the repercussions of its own priorities in 2020. Biden's appointees in the Department of Health and Human Services would eliminate freedom of conscience in the name of health care. They propose to revise Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act to add mandates about abortion, \"gender identity,\" and sexual orientation to existing protections against \"discrimination on the basis of sex.\" Revision will subvert the right of hospitals and medical practitioners to claim exemption from participating in procedures that violate their religious convictions.\n\nNBC News: Strict Voter ID Laws Disproportionately Impact Trans Voters. Wednesday, NBC reporters Joe Fryer, Savannah Sellers and Jo Yurcaba discussed the impact of voter ID laws on transgender people on NBC News' free streaming service show \"Morning News Now.\" Fryer said, \"As Gen Z gears up to hit the polls, transgender voters are concerned they might be blocked from casting their ballots.\" Sellers said, \"That is because a growing number of states are enforcing stricter voter identification laws that disproportionally impact the community.\"\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nIf you habitually pretend to be something you're not, you should not be surprised if your identification is challenged. If you live your life as a transvestite, you shouldn't be surprised if you encounter self-imposed obstacles that normal people don't encounter.\n\nStudent suspended, coach father fired after complaining 'a man shouldn't be in the women's locker room'. A 14-year-old high school student has been suspended from her Vermont school and her father, the coach of the girls soccer team, was fired without pay after the duo complained about biological males being allowed into the girls' locker room — and now, the father-daughter duo is suing the school district, alleging they are being punished for expressing their discomfort. [Video clip] Blake Allen made headlines recently after officials at Randolph Union High School (RUHS) banned the entire girls volleyball team from using its own locker room because they dared to voice their discomfort with a transgender student — a biological male — who was allegedly making inappropriate comments as the young women were changing.\n\nChristian baker WINS in California over gay wedding cake lawsuit. In a surprising ruling, a Christian baker has won in the state of California after being sued by the state for discrimination against a gay couple. Cathy Miller, owner of Tastries Bakery in Bakersfield, refused to make a cake for a gay couple's wedding and a judge in California's Superior has ruled that the Constitution protects Miller's freedom of religion.\n\nCourt Rules on Rights of Christian Baker in Same-Sex Wedding Case. A Christian baker has won a legal victory in her battle for religious freedom in California. This week, attorneys from the Thomas More Society secured a First Amendment win in their defense of Cathy Miller, owner of Tastries Bakery in Bakersfield, CA. Miller was exonerated on charges that followed her religious objection to creating a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, Eileen and Mireya Rodriguez-Del Rio, due to her Christian beliefs. Judge J. Eric Bradshaw of the Superior Court of California ruled, \"The evidence affirmatively showed that Miller's only intent, her only motivation, was fidelity to her sincere Christian beliefs.\"\n\nFlorida schools ordered to provide bathrooms separated by biological sex. The Florida Board of Education unanimously passed new rules requiring all public and charter schools to provide bathrooms and locker rooms separated by biological sex after a divided public hearing Wednesday. The move comes months after the passing of a Gov. Ron DeSantis backed bill spearheading legislation that banned discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity for kids in kindergarten through the third grade in the state. The new bathroom regulations also mandate schools notify parents if they offer bathrooms and locker rooms that are not sorted by biological sex and outline their supervision procedures for them. Backers contended Wednesday that the measures ensure parental transparency while allowing schools to provide a variety of bathroom options for kids.\n\nVermont School District Retaliates Against Father Who Spoke out Against Allowing Biological Male to Use Girl's Locker Room. Remember earlier this month when the news broke about a Vermont high school allowing a biologically male student to use the girl's locker room? Well, there has been a new and disturbing development in this saga. A father who works at the school was suspended for speaking out against the policy after his daughter was made uncomfortable by the male student. The situation began when the Daily Signal reported that two girls who are members of the Randolph High School's volleyball team asked the boy, who identifies as a girl, to leave the locker room after he made an inappropriate comment. The school responded by essentially banning girls from the girl's locker room to cater to the male student's delusion about his gender identity as it launched an investigation into the matter. But they were not investigating the conflict. Instead, they are \"launching a harassment investigation\" into the girls who complained rather than the 14-year-old boy who chose to use their locker room.\n\nVirginia Lawmaker Introduces Bill That Would Allow The State To Remove Children From Parents If They Don't Affirm Their Pretend Gender. As the battle over parental rights and protections for LGBT students heats up in Virginia, one state delegate said she will introduce a bill in the legislature's next session that would make it a crime for a parent or guardian not to affirm their child's sexual orientation or gender identity. The move is in response to Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin's updated \"model policies\" on transgender students, which require students to use bathrooms and join sports teams based on their sex at birth, as opposed to their gender identity. Democratic Virginia Delegate Elizabeth Guzman told WJLA on Thursday she will introduce a bill that will expand the state's definition of child abuse and neglect to include parents and guardian [sic] who do not affirm their LGBT children.\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nLittle kids have stupid ideas and they are almost always wrong when their ideas are non-conformist in any way. \"Affirming\" their stupidity is just plain nuts.\n\nStudents Want Professor Removed for Saying There Are Only Two Sexes. The University of Southern Maine's Christy Hammer, who could fairly be described as a \"woke\" professor herself, is the target of an effort by students to remove her from teaching a class because she answered a student's question honestly. Hammer, an associate professor of Teacher Education at the public (taxpayer-supported) university, was teaching a graduate course last month, entitled \"Creating a Positive Learning Environment,\" when a student asked her how many sexes there were. Hammer responded, \"Two.\" That upset the student who asked the question, Elizabeth Leibiger, who identifies herself as \"nonbinary,\" or neither male nor female. Leibiger told the media, \"I felt under personal attack.\" \"I let her know,\" Leibiger said, \"I didn't think she was qualified to teach a class about positive learning environments. It's the ultimate irony.\" Actually, the \"ultimate irony\" is that Dr. Hammer's response is somehow considered \"controversial.\" Throughout human history, it has been widely understood that human beings are either male or female.\n\nFederal Judge Declares Mandated Workplace Pronouns, Unisex Bathrooms Unlawful. A federal judge in Texas has issued a ruling that prevents federal mandates from imposing pronouns and unisex bathrooms on employers. [...] \"Title VII as interpreted in Bostock does not require such accommodations,\" wrote Judge Kacsmaryk in his Oct. 1 decision. \"The same is true of the March 2nd guidance. It exceeds Section 1557's requirement and is not justified by Bostock and contrary to Defendant's claims, the guidance binds agency staff failing to genuinely leave the agencies and their decision makers free to exercise discretion.\" Bostock v Clayton County is a 2020 Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) ruling that protects gay or transgender employees from workplace discrimination under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which was initially enacted to end racial discrimination and segregation against blacks in public accommodations, public education, and federally assisted programs.\n\nThe Never-Ending Persecution Of Jack Phillips. By the time I visited Masterpiece Cakeshop in 2016, Jack Phillips, the man who had famously refused to bake a specialty cake celebrating the wedding of a gay couple, had been the victim of a four-year campaign of harassment by the authoritarians at the Colorado Civil Rights Commission intent on punishing him for a thought crime. Now Phillips is back in the news, as his lawyers attempt to get new charges against him dismissed on appeal from a Colorado judge's decision last year. For the past decade, the media and lawyers and judges and leftists have misrepresented Phillips' position. No, the baker never turned a gay couple away from his shop. Or a transgender person. Or anyone else. No, he never refused to sell anyone a wedding cake (ceremonial, in the case that made him famous, as the request predated both Obergefell and Colorado's recognition of gay marriage). Philips refuses to create any specialty item from scratch that features any message that conflicts with his long-held religious beliefs. He will refuse to create such cakes for any customer, gay or straight or black or white.\n\nPersecuting Christians who refuse to do work for same-sex weddings is nothing less than bigotry. Emilee Carpenter is a gifted photographer whose lavish images celebrate all kinds of people — Christian, Jewish, black, white, straight, gay and everything in between. She aims her lens at clients without fear or prejudice — with one notable exception. She refuses to take pictures of same-sex weddings. That's non-negotiable. And it could cost her — big time. [...] Carpenter has declined requests by same-sex couples to document their weddings. So she researched potential penalties — hefty fines, revocation of her business license, even up to a year behind bars — and freaked out. In April 2021, she sued New York, claiming its human-rights law forcing her to shoot same-sex marriages ran afoul of her First Amendment rights to free speech, free association and free religious expression, and violated the establishment clause and her right to due process.\n\nVermont girls' high school volleyball team are barred from their OWN locker room after complaining about transgender student. Members of a Vermont girls high school volleyball team have been banned from using their own locker room and now have to change in a single bathroom stall after they complained about a transgender teammate. Some teammates allege that the transgender player at Randolph Union High School made an 'inappropriate remark' to some of them while they were changing in the locker room. They now want the school to relocate the transgender player, who hasn't been named.\n\nIs Montana's Defiance of 'Illegal' Court Order a Model That Other Conservative States Should Follow? As radical federal judges across America continue to undo conservative programs and initiatives, including much of the work of the Trump administration, the state of Montana has defied a court order on transgender birth certificates. Could this be a model for other conservative states? Maybe so. The left is fond of its \"Resist\" slogan. It's past time for conservatives to resist, as well — in earnest. Just hours after a Montana judge blocked health officials from enforcing a state rule that would prevent transgender people from changing the gender on their birth certificate, as reported by AP, the Republican-run state on Thursday said it would defy the order.\n\nJudge Removes Democratic Prosecutor from Case of Loudoun Father Whose Daughter Was Raped in School. A Circuit Court judge removed a Loudoun County prosecutor from a case citing \"concerns\" about \"impartiality\" after an appeal from father Scott Smith, whose daughter was raped at Stone Bridge High School in Virginia by a teen who went on to grope a student at a different school. Last year, Smith went to a school board meeting to get answers about his daughter's assault in the girls' bathroom at the hands of a male student, and was \"arrested and convicted in District Court of two misdemeanors — disorderly conduct and obstruction of justice,\" according to WTOP news. He has since appealed the charges, and Circuit Court Judge James Plowman has dismissed the count of obstruction of justice after determining that a lower court judge filled out the requisite charging paperwork incorrectly[.]\n\nChristian bakers fined for gay 'wedding' cake refusal take case back to US Supreme Court. The Christian bakers who were slammed with fines and ultimately lost their business after they refused to bake a cake for a gay \"wedding\" are once more bringing their case before the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing the state violated their due process and First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court had previously reviewed the case in 2019 before remanding it to a lower court. Attorneys with the public interest law firm First Liberty Institute announced Wednesday that they submitted a petition for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. In the petition, the attorneys asked the Court to review Melissa and Aaron Klein's case stemming from a 2013 discrimination lawsuit.\n\nDismantling the Transgender Establishment. The kids may be back in school, but this year parents are more fearful thanks in part to the courageous parents in Loudoun County Virginia who nearly two years ago brought to national attention the transgender policy, pro-LGBT Sex Ed, and divisive CRT indoctrination in public schools. Although their exercise of free speech earned them threats from Biden's increasingly militarized DoJ, more parents nationwide learned that their kids, from K-12 and college, are likely to be indoctrinated with radical leftist woke ideology, including the absurd idea that sexual identity is a personal choice. In Virginia, the top issue remains transgender bathroom policy. A clear majority of parents showing up at school board meetings the last two years don't want biological males who identify as female in girl's private areas and vice-versa. All legislators should take heed of the lesson learned by Clinton crony Terry McAuliffe (D Va.) who lost a seemingly shoo-in governor's race to novice politician Glenn Youngkin (R) after telling concerned parents they have no say in their kid's education!\n\nChristian baker in Oregon returns to Supreme Court over refusal to bake same-sex wedding cake. A Christian baker is back at the Supreme Court, asking the justices once again to take up her challenge to Oregon's public accommodations law after the state put her out of business for refusing to create a custom wedding cake for a same-sex couple. Melissa Klein and her husband Aaron owned \"Sweet Cakes by Melissa.\" They served all customers without discrimination until 2013 when they were approached by repeat customers for a custom cake — but this time it was to celebrate the same-sex marriage of a lesbian couple. They refused to participate, citing the Bible's teaching against homosexuality and their faith. As a result, the couple filed a complaint with the state, which fined them $135,000.\n\nCan the United States Stop the March to Self-Destruction? Then, the radical left, again using the Civil Rights Movement as the backdrop, decided to create the latest incarnation of a so-called civil rights crusade: the mainstreaming of a phenomenon hitherto regarded as a mental disorder, gender dysphoria. And sticking with the overwhelmingly effective blueprint, another intimidation epithet to go along with racism and homophobia was devised: transphobia. There was no initial redeeming aspect of the transgender movement, as it was concocted to draw in another gullible generation seeking relevance and meaning in their vapid lives. Beyond producing another group of credulous halfwits, it further advances the destruction of the family and the Judeo-Christian underpinning of the nation while dismantling what was once a cohesive American society. Its adherents promulgate the mutilation of willfully confused children on the altar of Marxism. If the United States is to stop the march to self-destruction, then the vast majority of Americans who do not identify with the left need to wake up and understand that the American left is not an unstoppable monolithic leviathan crushing everyone in its path.\n\nBiden's DOJ embraces bias and anti-religious bigotry. Do you believe a baker has the right not to bake cakes for same-sex weddings? Do you believe church daycare programs have just as much of a right as other such programs to apply for state grants? Do you think pregnancy centers should not be forced by the government to tell pregnant women where to get an abortion? If you support the First Amendment rights of any of these entities, then President Joe Biden's Department of Justice believes you're a bigot unworthy of associating with — or at least that is the message the department sends by protecting a senior DOJ official who attacked the nation's leading legal advocate of religious liberty. The DOJ Civil Division's assistant director of commercial litigation is Eric Bruskin. Last week, Bruskin labeled a reputable organization, the Alliance Defending Freedom, a \"hate group\" and told a former colleague online, \"Are these beliefs you hold? If so then it's time we end our professional association.\"\n\nTitle IX Comes for Christian Schools. Sometimes, scrolling through the news, you come across a story so ludicrous, so extreme, it seems like someone must have made it up to prove a point. Take, for example, the recent situation at Grant Park Christian Academy in Tampa, where the federal government was threatening to take away school lunches for underprivileged children unless the school allowed, among other things, male students to share lockers, showers, and bathrooms with female students. For Grant Park and other Christian schools and universities that have chosen to uphold their deeply held beliefs, reality is proving crazier than fiction. The Biden administration has proposed changes to the language of Title IX, a civil rights law designed to prevent sex-based discrimination. The administratio"
