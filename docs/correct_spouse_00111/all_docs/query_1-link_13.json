        "text": "IT looks like it’s all over for Steven Tyler and wife No. 2, Teresa Barrick.\n\nThe pair, who have been married since 1988, are talking about a split, says a source. Tyler and his wife have two children together, 16-year-old Chelsea and 13-year-old Taj. The family lives in Boston, Tyler’s hometown.They are handling the separation in the same style in which they wed: quietly. They were married in a tiny ceremony in Barrick’s hometown of Tulsa, Okla. Tyler only told friends this week that he and Barrick were considering breaking up, according to the source.Barrick, a fashion designer, is responsible for much of Tyler’s distinctive rocker wardrobe.\n\nTyler is also the father of Liv, with model Bebe Buell, and Mia, with his first wife, Cyrinda Foxe.\n\n“He is difficult, there isn’t just one thing that led to this,” said the source. “It’s been coming for a while.”\n\nIn contrast to his flamboyant stage personality, Tyler has been so discrete about his marital woes that even his management was taken by surprise. “We haven’t heard anything about this,” said a rep for the rocker.\n\nON THE MOVE\n\nTara Subkoff, the pixie-ish designer of Imitation of Christ and sometime actress, is through with “Life Aquatic” director Wes Anderson after nearly two years together – and she’s already moved on, to fellow thespian Liev Schrieber.\n\n“Tara broke up with Wes a few weeks ago,” said one friend. “She won’t admit that she’s dating Liev, but they are together.”\n\nSubkoff surprised organizers at the Natural History Museum Winter Dance when she asked for a ticket to the gala dinner just two days before the Thursday night benefit, said a source.\n\nSchreiber was expected to attend as well, but didn’t show. When asked about him at the event, Subkoff quickly snapped, “We are just friends. Just friends!”\n\nSimilarly press-shy was Ashley Olsen, who insisted that she not be named and be listed only as boyfriend Scott Sartiano’s unidentified guest on the check-in list, the source said.\n\nMeanwhile, “Saturday Night Live” star Amy Poehler, not a regular on the social circuit, was unimpressed with the young crowd in the Rose Planetarium.\n\n“This is like the singles scene from hell! Everyone is just scoping each other out,” she observed to one guest, surveying the crush of bejeweled young socialites.\n\nIn the mix were Moby, Chloe-clad co-chairs Ivanka Trump, Claire Bernard, Lauren Davis and Tinsley Mortimer, as well as actress Tarajia Morrell, Alexis Bryant (daughter of Shelby), Charles Rockefeller and Teddy Roosevelt V.\n\nGALS NO SMALL POTATOES\n\nGuess it makes sense that notorious womanizer Colin Farrell is a proponent of having women run Hollywood.\n\nWhen Glamour magazine hosted its “Power Women Under 40” party at the Chateau Marmont Thursday night, the actor, drawn in by a pretty staffer at the door, first asked if there were any cute girls inside, then asked why the mag was hosting the event. When told it was to honor women in Hollywood, Farrell exclaimed, “Well, it’s about f—ing time someone did!”\n\nBut instead of going in to join the likes of Mischa Barton and Robert Downey Jr. (with producer fiancee Susan Levin), he headed off to meet fellow Irishman, director Jim Sheridan, for what he said would be a dinner of “meat and taters.”\n\nINSTANT MESSAGES\n\nJustin Timberlake and Cameron Diaz skipped last week’s Grammys to celebrate being together for one year with a party in Las Vegas on Sunday. The two hosted a gathering for 20 friends – including Timberlake’s ever-present mother, of course – at the Hard Rock Hotel. The couple took over the $10,000-a-night penthouse at the resort, and chowed on a Nobu-catered feast before gambling in the Peacock Lounge into the wee hours. Then they moved the party to their room, which was set up with a bowling alley and oversize hot tub.\n\nOur favorite porn-star heiress, Paris Hilton, celebrated her 24th birthday in Los Angeles Thursday – but only spent 20 minutes at her own party. Hilton first hosted a Barbie-themed dinner at Geisha House, joined by sister Nicky Hilton, actor Kevin Connelly and House of Wax co-star Elisha Cuthbert. Then she headed to the party at nightclub El Centro with her boyfriend, the handily named Paris Latsis. She arrived at midnight and took off soon after, CBS’s “The Insider” reports, only staying long enough to dance on a platform.\n\nSometimes it’s tough work to be the boyfriend. Adam Dell, the on-again, off-again beau of new reality- TV star Brittny Gastineau, tried to attend the premiere of her E! show, “Gastineau Girls,” but discovered he had arrived too late.\n\nDell attempted to explain to the security staff that he was an invited guest of the Gastineaus, but they were having none of it.\n\nFinally, a girl’s voice piped up from the back of the line. “Let him in! He’s the boyfriend!” she said.\n\nThat did the trick, and Dell went in to join his sweetie. The makers of Suave shampoo are donating $10,000 in my name to my favorite charity, I Have A Dream, a tutoring program. All I have to do is get my hair done by celebrity stylist Harry Josh – in a store window. So if you want to laugh, come watch him try to beautify me on Tuesday at 5 p.m. at 12 E. 42nd St.\n\nIf you want to book your own appointment at the temporary Suave “Can You Tell” Studio for a free haircut, manicure, or skin consultation with dermatologist Dr. Francesca Fusco, call (877) SUAVE-05 today. For every beauty treatment you have done, Sauve will donate $40 to the charity Gilda’s Club.\n\nThe Studio is only open this Tuesday-Saturday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m., so hurry up and call!\n\nFYI: Soho House is moving to Los Angeles for Oscar week, offering celebrities pampering treatments like a massage with $6 million worth of colored diamonds from Diamond Aquifer … Jason Biggs swept his girlfriend, actress Lindsay Zir, off to Puerto Rico for a romantic Valentine’s Day trip – so Zir, who’s currently starring in “Pieces of Ass,” had to miss a day of work on Monday … Here’s how Hollywood works: If you’re Harvey Keitel, you command enough power to get an omelet made for your lunch – even though staff insisted to the infuriated civilian diners at Axe restaurant in Los Angeles that there were no eggs on the noontime menu … Naomi Wolitzky, the granddaughter of the late Laurance Rockefeller, rocked the Whitney Contemporaries party Thursday in Chelsea as her stage alter-ego: Muffy Nixon … MUST GO IN: Brett Ratner and girlfriend Serena Williams were so desperate to get to Miami to party at nightclub Prive after Sean Comb’s bash celebrating the opening of the Hotel Victor that they were willing to take coach seats from Las Vegas, just like normal people."
