Older buildings were designed in a traditional style common to other major U.S. universities. University architects insist classic materials such as brick, concrete and tile roofing be incorporated in newer buildings. ON SOLID GROUND Title Page 1 STANDING FIRM Los Angeles fertile ground for our social and academic growth TRADITION - a word that exemplifies our proud phi­ losophy. In keeping with tradition, for the past 114 years we have carried out our founders' vision to make Los Angeles the educational center of the Pacific Coast. We are rooted on the original eight acres of land since our founding in 1880, but have grown to occupy 150 acres of Los Angeles. Despite social and geographic chal­ lenges - the spring 1992 Los Angeles riots, the 1993 Malibu fires, the January 1994 Northridge earthquake - we have rejected opportunites to relocate and remain firmly committed to our area. 2 Opening Larry Ho Doheny Memorial Library was redesigned and now houses an expanded cinema-television library, Doheny remains the center of our library system, holding over 3 million volumes. Completed in 1932, it consists of 168,150 square feet. The Von KleinSmid Center's globe details and identifies our skyline. The center, comprised of the Schools of International Relations and Public Administration, em­ phasizes an international approach to education. VKC is named after Rufus von KleinSmid, university president and chancellor Tommy Trojan has stood at the southeast corner of Bovard Auditorium since June 6,1930. He manifests the Trojan name and spirit associated with USC since we were dubbed Trojans by a Los Angeles Times writer. On his pedestal are inscribed the qualities of an ideal Trojan: faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous and ambitious. Inside Bovard Administration Building are not only the offices of the president and provost, but also the oldest stage facilities still operating in the Los Angeles area. The Kenneth Norris, Jr. Auditorium is our largest and oldest auditorium. The building was constructed in 1921 and is named for our fourth president George Finley Bovard. \"USC is commited to improving the quality of life in our region, and, particularly, in the neighborhoods sur­ rounding our two campuses.\" - President Steven B. Sample \"You can be a part of history here in Los Angeles because there's always something going on, }) - Nicole Willis, junior psychology major \"I liked the programs and opportunities offered here. I wanted to go to school in a big city since I grew up in one. » - Hamilton Lancaster, freshman environmental studies major O N SOLID GROUND Jennifer Browning Opening 3 COMMUNITY TIES Fostering services to enrich South Central development In 1991 President Sample said he wanted to expand our local public service programs. The direction of his programs have become quite focused in replant­ ing the university. The Office of Civic and Commu­ nity Relations said 60 percent of stu­ dents volunteer service to the com­ munity at least once a year. The Good Neighbors Campaign asked staff and faculty to contrib= ute to the area. Donations went to further child development and safer neighborhood initiatives. By embracing challenges rather than running from problems, the part­ nership of town and gown will con­ tinue to progress on solid ground. 4 Opening Richard Kim President Steven B. Sample spoke at a dedica­ tion ceremony for Founders Day on October 6. Some 200 people gathered in Founders Park for services. Students Laurie Hill and Adam Strachan, both descendents of founders, unveiled a plaque tracing the origins of campus. University Park Campus is just minutes away from Down­ town Los Angeles. The city was a frontier town when the university opened its doors in 1880. University-Exposi­ tion Park has grown into a major cultural/entertainment area that includes five museums, three galleries and three theatres. Local residents staff many of the dining services on campus. The university is the largest private employer of Los Angeles with 17, 000 full- and part-time employees on both campuses. It also generates some 40,000 jobs out­ side the university. The reference center is Doheny's main reading room. It accommodates 400 students, measures 131 feet long and is two and a half stories high. Marks of 14 printers important in the history of bookmaking are carved in the woodwork and form a frieze around the room. \"USC is one of the very few things going for this community - job oppor­ tunities, enrichment pro­ grams for youth. It makes a big difference.\" - Therese Gacad, junior nursing major \"We can no longer depend on corporate philanthropy or govern­ ment to 'fix' our neighborhoods.\" - Jane Pisano, director of Neigh­ borhood Outreach and chair of USC Good Neighbors Campaign \"The whole Latino floor of Fluor Tower decided to join the Joint Educational Project as a group. I found this was so impres­ sive because a lot of them are giving back to the community they grew up in.\" - Jody Kaufman, senior business admin­ istration, marketing and communications emphasis O N SOLI D GROUND James Su Opening 5 6 Student Life fc HARMONIZING DIVERSITY I n the fast-paced metropolis, our beau­ tiful campus is a haven for eyes beleagured STUDEN T LIFE with smog, The fountain at the intersection of Trousdale Parkway and Childs Way is a favorite place for students to eat lunch, study or just relax.

Student Life 7 Displaying some Trojan history, the university gift shop tells a story about John Robinson at USC. Sweatshirts represented one of the biggest sellers at the bookstore with numerous cat­ egories to select from. TROJAN GEAR All who enter the ground level of the bookstore will quickly see where all the Trojan spirit is. They will also see there is a new look. There are wall to wall para­ phernalia and there are life size posters of football coach John Robinson and women's basketball coach Cheryl Miller, along with former basketball player Harold Miner. One can find anything from USC book bags to Tro­ jan toiletry. All of the ar­ ticles sold are official prod­ ucts of Nike, Russell and Jos tens . During the week many students browse the bookstore for the hottest clothing for the sporting events, \"but on the week­ end the alumni are the big­ gest consumer especially during Trojan Family weekends and rivalry games like UCLA and Notre Dame,\" said Mr. Bowman, manager of the gift shop at the bookstore. According to Mr. Bowman, \"the big­ gest selling articles this year are the sunflower products including: sweat shirts, t-shirts, book bags and coffee mugs.\" For all the USC fans who did not have time to buy all their clothes for the sport­ ing events during the week, there was an official USC booth at the Coliseum. At every home game, one could purchase everything they needed for the game. With this service, there was no reason that everyone could not be showing their Trojan spirit everywhere they go! Article by Monica Ellis. 8 Student Life THE SWOOSH The new hats and jackets that infiltrated this campus all had one thing in common, the Nike swoosh. This famous symbol has come to represent the drive and ability to succeed and has been worn by athletes like Michael Jordan and Gabrielle Reece. Something as simple as this trademark stands for all the hours of prac­ tice, sweat, determination, bravery and heart that go into everything one does. This sym­ bol has now come to represent the excellence that USC in­ stills in its athletes and acade­ micians. Walking in the center of campus a student shows her USC spirit on a back pack. The sunflower products have become one of the biggest selling items at the bookstore according to Mr. Bow­ man, the manager. \"Go directly to jail, do not pass go!\" USCopoly is one of the unique Trojan items that the bookstore carries. The various places represented on the board include the 901 Club and the Los Ange­ les Coliseum. Finding the perfect shirt or jacket for one's personal USC needs is no prob­ lem at the bookstore. The number and variety of items at the bookstore has increased since Nike has become the official sponsor of the University of Southern California.

One of the Yell Leader traditions is after each score they do as many push-ups as the team has points. 0 I Kayo Goto TROJAN MAN Who is that mysterious man who leads the Trojan March­ ing band on to the field every game? The man behind the armor is Sean Jenkins, drum major for the band. Sean achieved this honor after be­ ing voted in by the band mem­ bers last spring. His official responsibilities are to run the pre-game and halftime shows. When asked what it was like to face a crowd of screaming USC students he said, \"I get the biggest lump in my stomach. I take a quick look at the crowd, take a deep breath and then just go into my zone.\" Kayo Goto Blasting away from the back of the band section, the tuba players provide volume for the USC marching band.

The Silks provide visual entertainment during halftime with their innovative flag rou­ tines. Kayo Goto SC SPIRIT IJVES ON \"Fight on for old 'SC! Fight on to victory!\" Thousands of screaming devoted fans exhibit their support in a mass of frenzy, chaos and most importantly spirit. Here at the University of Southern California, spirit takes on new meaning. It is a way of life, a part of your soul and identity. Spirit sets USC apart from any other school in the nation. \"It's jus t different,\" claims Emily Parker, a sophomore majoring in critical stud­ ies. \"No one else waves two fingers in the air for hours on end to show support. It makes us unique and spe­ cial.\" . Those two fingers cap­ ture everything USC is about in one small gesture. It unites students from all walks of life, complete strangers who have one common bond. The \"V\" does not only pertain to athletics, but it defines our goals, hopes and dreams as well. So many people contrib­ ute to keeping spirit alive and well. For example, the sight of the world famous Trojan Marching band sends any devoted USC fan into hysterics. When asked what it felt like to be stand­ ing on the field watching the crazed fans go wild, Nicole Willis, a squad leader for the band who plays alto saxophone, replied simply, \"It's intense.\" The Yell Leaders and Song Leaders also generate spirit, especially at games and pep rallies. With their contagious smiles and crisp, clean uniforms this small bunch knows exactly how to get a crowd on its feet and cheering hard. How does one develop this pride and dedication? \"I think they brainwash us with the food,\" says Megan Outcalt, an exercise science major. \"I always knew there was something weird tast­ ing in the food at Cafe 84.\" The more believable rea­ son is that it is infectious. Generations of Trojans have passed on their pride to their young, as will the students of today do the same. Article by Michelle Ovalle.

Larry Ho A NEW LOOK The refurbished Commons area was one of the most wel­ come additions to the campus in 1994. The renovated din­ ing room and newly designed market area were opened up to give the appearance of more space and the furnishings were decorated with light colors as opposed to the dark brown that was present before. The products offered in the refur­ bished Commons allowed stu­ dents to enjoy a greater vari­ ety of items. Sophia Molinaro, a junior art history major en­ joys one of the food stuffs at Commons, a soup bar. Larry Ho 1 2 Student Life A MOVEAB L E F EAST Cafeteria food at most universities is not some­ thing that people usually look forward to, but at USC we have the privilege of di­ verse choices of good food. Commons Cafeteria is one of the most visited spots because of its location in the center of campus. People have their choice from a variety of breakfast and lunch items as well as specialty items like min­ eral waters and sushi. Over the summer, Commons was remodeled and the main dining room's brightly painted walls and new car­ pets welcomed people to sit down and enjoy their food. When students walked into the refurbished area they were greeted by baskets of candy and shelves layered with fresh pastries and fruit. If students were in the mood for a sit down lunch with table side service they needed only to go to the Upstairs Commons for their meal. This restaurant of­ fered pastas, hot sand­ wiches, appetizers and de­ licious desserts. Complimenting these ser­ vices were more specialized dining establishments like Wolfgang Puck's California Pizza. This world famous pizzeria opened on campus in 1993 and provided an­ other place to eat. The Ground Zero Coffee House, another recent ad­ dition to the USC campus, provided an environment for students to meet each other and get a cup of good coffee. Ground Zero offered poetry and play readings and every Thursday there were jazz performances. Local bands also came to perform and special events like Casino Night took place there as well. Ground Zero also underwent renovation recently with the addition of a new stage, new cur­ tains and ceiling fans. These restaurants, along with Carl's Junior, Cafe 84 and the Grill comprised a dining program that was unique to this campus and which gave a wide variety of choices for both students and faculty to enjoy.

The Trojans humili­ ated the Golden Bears 61 -0 for the first shut-out of the season. TROJAN TRADITIONS This university has been founded upon tradition and a legacy of success. This feeling of tradition has been passed from generation to generation of students at USC and has helped create the idea of a Trojan family. With the continuation of this spirit throughout the years there have been cer­ tain actions and words that have become part of the Trojan tradition. \"I came to USC because of the tradition, nowhere else is there the feeling of a Trojan family and USC has some of the best alumni support in the nation,\" said Jennifer Jackson, a fresh­ man majoring in history. The University of South­ ern California did not al­ ways have the Trojan as its mascot. The name origi­ nated from a 1912 article in the Los Angeles Times in which Owen Bird, describ­ ing the USC athletes at a track meet, said they, \"fought like Trojans.\" Since that time the name has be­ come a part of the USC tra­ dition. The USC slogan \"Fight On!\" is derived from the fight song written by USC studentMilo Sweet in 1922. Those words have come to embody the spirit and dedi­ cation that USC has for its athletics and academics. The formal traditions at USC are accompanied by many actions that cannot be traced to any single event. The two fingers thrust into the air is a com­ mon signal that has been adapted to represent Tro­ jan victory and pride in USC. One of the more obscure traditions is the kicking of the flag poles as students and alumni walk to the Coliseum for football games. The bottom of the flag poles are kicked before the game for good luck and after a winning game to cel­ ebrate the victory. No one is really sure where this came from but nonetheless it has become of the Trojan tradition. It is the combi­ nation of formal traditions with those everyday activi­ ties which keep the spirit and tradition of the Univer­ sity of Southern California alive and well.

This dedicated fan can be seen run­ ning up and down the bleach­ ers urging students to do a SoCal spellout. With the ring­ ing of his bell and his over­ whelming enthusiasm stu­ dents cannot help but comply with his requests and start the famous, \"S-o-u...\" With every letter the spirit in the crowd builds until the final scream of the school's name and the \"bell man\" moves on to another part of the crowd, his task accom­ plished. Taking a piece out of the flag pole, an alumnus participates in the pregame tradition. The kicking of the flag pole is done both before and after the game to bring luck and to celebrate a victory.

He explained that his tattoos are a way of expressing himself and that he plans on getting more in the future. Showing off her lion tattoo, Melissa Mandrgoc also has a pierced belly but­ ton. Mandrgoc \"thought about it a lot\" before proceeding to get her tattoo. \"This is something permanent, and I wanted to make sure.\" Showing off his ankle tattoo is Cory Bunyard, a sophomore who is unde­ clared. He claimed that the tattoo hurt less than he had expected. 16 Student Life MAKING A CHANGE Some people wear eccen­ tric shoes, some don out­ landish hats, and others put on colored contacts. These are a few of the diversified manners that students at USC present daily. How­ ever, a few students took a further daring step - body alteration. \"Lots of people did not expect this of me. I did it as a shocker, I guess. And it worked,\" explained Soniya Deshpande, who decided to go ahead with a nose ring during spring break in her freshman year. The motives for body al­ terations differed for each person. To some students it was a display of individu­ ality. For others, the alter­ ation itself may hold spe­ cial meaning. Melissa Mandrgoc chose Leo, her astrological sign, to be her tattoo. \"It (astrology) is the only thing I believe in,\" she explained. In addition, one has to think about cost and safety when considering a body alteration. The price range varies greatly from $15 for nose rings to over $100 for tattoos. Body alterations often involve working with needles. Thus, the major health concern is that clean, sterile needles are used to minimize transmit­ ting disease. Furthermore, great care must be taken to clean the altered area to prevent infection. Shoes, hats, and contacts can be removed at the end of the day. Body alterations such as tattoos, colored hair, and nose rings, how­ ever, are here to stay. For this reason, the decision to undertake such a drastic change requires careful consideration. Mandrgoc \"thought about it a lot\" be­ fore proceeding to get her tattoo. \"This is something permanent, and I wanted to make sure.\" For some students, how­ ever, the alteration is tem­ porary rather than perma­ nent. Deshpande ruefully anticipates that her nose ring probably will have to close after college. \"I am pre-med. How would you like a doctor with a nose ring to come up to you?\" Article by Jing Chen. IT'S PERSONAL The extent to which body piercing has become a part of certain people's lives amazes some. The recent explosion of body piercing has some claim­ ing that it is simply a fad and will soon pass from the cul­ tural scene. However, Kristin Ruger, a theatre major, claims that getting her tongue, nose, eyebrows and various parts of her body pierced has nothing to do with a trend but rather a form of self-expression. What­ ever the personal reason for body piercing it remains one of the most interesting forms of body alteration. Basking in the sun is one of USC's premier volleyball players, Meika Wagner, who is a senior majoring in political science. She claimed getting her ears pierced hurt more than when she got her belly button pierced. Body Alteration 17 Standing imposingly, the Leavey Library was completed priorto the beginning of the school year with the landscaping added as the year progressed. The final cost of the library was over 27 million. WAVE OF THE FUTURE The final cost of the new teaching library on the Uni­ versity of Southern Califor­ nia campus is $2 7.5 million The primary role Leavey Library serves is to act as an internal center for un­ dergraduates. The theory that the library is built upon says that students who have skill in print and electronic information have a com­ petitive edge in our infor­ mation based economy. The library also acts as a method through which in­ formation technology can be brought into the class­ room. Dr. Christopher Fergusen, director of Leavey Library says that the \"instructional research support for undergradu­ ates\" promotes excellence in education, and he be­ lieves that this can be found at Leavey Library. Dr. Fergusen says that workshops and classes are offered throughout the se­ mester. These classes are published in the class schedule, and are offered 10 to 20 times a week. These workshops teach students how to use computers, USC info, and much more. The workshops were created to aid those students who have little or no experience deal­ ing with the different com­ ponents that Leavey library has to offer. The library has eight li­ brarians, eight library as­ sistants, several computer consultants, and many stu­ dent employees. The librar­ ians' main focus is to con­ tribute to the instruction, research, consultation and collection that goes on within the library. The li­ brary assistants contribute to the operation of the ser­ vice desk and the naviga­ tion assistance program in the Information Commons. Future plans for the li­ brary include access to 350 magazines and journals as well as an electronic reserve service which is scanned and made available elec­ tronically by audio or by images. As technology ad­ vances and changes, major changes will occur through­ out the library. Says Dr. Chris Fergusen, \"we are prepared to take full advan­ tage of all that.\" Article by Samantha Kerdman. 18 Student Life I I pit i ! 7 7 Laurie Drew NEW IDEAS The students pictured here are part of a new wave of li­ braries. Peter Lyman, the ex­ ecutive director of the Center for Scholarly Technology at USC, wrote an article entitled \"The Library of the (Not-So- Distant) Future.\" He believes the library system needs to be recreated because of the rising cost of printed materials, the volume of information avail­ able and new technology that cannot be printed on paper. These ideas led to the new structures that form the Tho­ mas and Dorothy Leavey Li­ brary. Welcoming students to the recently finished library, an archway covers the entrance. The landscaping in front of the library was not completed until af­ ter it had already opened its doors. I Asking for assistance, a student gets help from the front desk.

Dewayne transfered from from East Carolina University be­ cause, \"I lived on the East coast all my life and I wanted to come out to the West coast.\" Julie Gargan BREAKING THE MOLD The University of South­ ern California is a college that is based upon tradi­ tion. A historic devotion to academic and athletic ex­ cellence are the founda­ tions upon which these tra­ ditions are laid. The tradi­ tional students were single 18-22 year male and fe­ males who started school here and will finish it here. However, there were sev­ eral groups of students on campus that were non-tra­ ditional. Single parents, re­ turning students and trans­ fer students were just a few of the non-traditional types of people that attended this university. Single parents represent a population that has risen in number over the last few years, and presence of a student parenting group on campus acknowledges this fact. Returning students range in age anywhere from 25 to 70 years old and come back to go to graduate school or to earn a degree that they never had a chance to get. Transfer students repre­ sented an extremely unique population on campus. These students were usu­ ally older than the average incoming freshmen but with the same questions that a new student would have. The difficulties that arise from this situation often leave most students feeling confused and intimi­ dated. There were several other groups that faced chal­ lenges on campus as well including disabled stu­ dents, international stu­ dents and minority stu­ dents. Each of these groups had their own type of orga­ nizations to provide advice and offer support. The obstacles that many non-traditional students faced were lessened by the presence of many organi­ zations on campus and the personal strength that these students possess al­ lowed them to overcome the boundaries that tradi­ tion sometimes creates.

Oh, to direct. To put faces and images on film and have them be an expression of an original vision is the dream of many students. The Cinema- television school is considered one of, if not, the finest in the nation and students come to Los Angeles and Hollywood to fulfill their dreams of making it in show business. \"I came to USC because of the film school. Its location and support by the industry make it the best place to begin a career in film,\" said Lee Farber, a junior majoring in cinema-television. ,#t H 2 2 Student Life FAMILIAR PLACES You're watching \"90210,\" enjoying the Beverly Hills gang's ridiculous attempts to play a prank on their rival school in honor of the big homecoming game. Suddenly you stop laugh­ ing—something about that rival school looks familiar. The network cuts to a com­ mercial break. One of the \"Got Milk?\" ads comes on. As you smile at the frus­ trated priest who kicks and pounds on a vending ma­ chine in a deserted corri­ dor, you can't help bu t won­ der where you've seen that hallway before. You shrug and slide your copy of \"Forrest Gump\" into the VGR. Wait a minute. Are you imagining things or does Jenny's dorm look a lot like Marks Hall? Relax, you're not due for a padded cell, and, no, you haven't overdosed on Tro­ jan pride. Chances are, if it looks like USG on the screen, it probably is. \"This campus has been featured in everything from movies to television shows to commercials and photo layouts,\" said Victoria Daves, the filming coordi­ nator for the USG Commu­ nications Office. The university's film credits included \"The Graduate,\" \"Marathon Man,\" \"Gross Anatomy,\" \"The Paper Chase,\" \"City Slickers 2,\" \"The Mighty Ducks 2,\" and \"Blue Chips.\" USG was also featured in episodes of \"Party of Five,\" \"Sweet Justice,\" and \"Tales From the Crypt,\" and photo layouts for Speedo, Nike, \"Shape\" magazine, and the Broadway fall catalogue. \"I think production crews like our campus because the buildings are old and interesting to look at. They have that East Coast look,\" said location liaison David Giannovario. \"Plus, our proximity to the studios makes us an appealing choice.\" The communications of­ fice, with its staff of three, fielded constant requests for on-campus sites from location scouts every day and made arrangements to accommodate an average of one film crew per week, Daves said.

Andrew Pupius Filming on Campus 23 LOOKING FOR GOD You are walking across campus, heading to your next class or on your way home and you hear some­ one speaking through a microphone. You casually listen to the person's pow­ erful story of how they have found the Lord and how their life has been for­ ever changed. Scenes like these are not uncommon on campus. There are over 20 officially recognized religious orga­ nizations at USG; some of the more visible ones are the Campus Crusade for Christ and the Trojan Vic­ tory Fellowship. These or­ ganizations serve many spiritual purposes on cam­ pus. Dennis Tuma, direc­ tor of the Campus Crusade for Christ said, \"our goal is to show students and fac­ ulty God's purpose for our lives and to help them think through the person of Jesus Christ.\" His group held many activities on campus including study groups, Thursday night meetings and forums interacting with students. Tuma said these various activities serve to \"give the Christian perspec­ tive and to demonstrate how Jesus Christ has chang­ ed our lives.\" Organizations like the Campus Crusade for Christ genuinely try to help stu­ dents and provide them with a valuable service. However, there are organi­ zations that students be­ come involved in that do not serve their best inter­ ests. In recent years there has been a rise in the amount of activity from these unsanctioned groups. They prey upon the disori­ entation and hopelessness that many students face in college. The university has instituted several policies to deal with these groups and students should be aware of the existence of these types of organiza­ tions. Article by Joseph Garmona. Illustrating his points with examples from the bible, speaker Brian Burchell speaks to members of the Campus Cru­ sade for Christ. The group held numer­ ous activities including Bible studies and forums. 24 Student Life Sharing a Bible, these two students follow along as speaker Brian Burchell reads a passage. The Campus Crusade for Christ held various forums over the year to teach students about Jesus Christ. Speaking to members of the Korean American Campus Mission, guest speaker Jim Jung consults the Bible. The KACM is one of the many organiza­ tions that students can join to fulfill their spiritual needs. SOME SUPPORT For students with a strong religious background the tran­ sition to college can be a diffi­ cult one. These students may face harassment by their peers and feel displaced. One of the most common ways students find religious support are through Bible and study groups. These informal gath­ erings provide students with a chance to meet with people who have similar ideas and to learn more about the Bible. Monica Ontiveros, Karin Brown and Betty Jo-Kalman enjoy some time together read­ ing the Book of Psalms. Listening to speaker Jim Jung, mem­ bers of the Korean American Campus Mission take notice of his point. The KACM was run by president Fred Lie who was responsible for bringing in speakers like Jung.

Escort service begins at 5 p.m and the last call is taken at 2:45 a.m. FIGHTING THE FEAR The \"fear factor\" is a prominent concern among all USG students; this is the cold reality that we must face as residents of South Central Los Angeles. The University of Southern Cali­ fornia attempted to com­ bat the issue of violence on campus through the Office of Women's Issues, The De­ partment of Public Safety, and the Escort service. The Office of Women's Issues deals with any type of sexual assault crime. Rape and sexual assault perpetrated by strangers are rare at USC; statistics show that 84 percent of vic­ tims knew their assailants. Students were encouraged to minimize their personal risk by taking a self-defense training class. There were many opportunities avail­ able on campus including various martial arts classes, Rape Aggression Defense Training, pepper spray cer­ tification, tear gas sprayer, stun guns and alarms. Eliza­ beth Davenport, Director of the Office of Women's Is­ sues stated, \"if you are tak­ ing a self-defense class, make sure it is one that teaches how to rebuff a friend as well as how to defend yourself on the street.\" The Department of Pub­ lic Safety addresses vari­ ous aspects of personal safety and confronting dan­ ger. Automatic teller ma­ chine safety, carjacking, being confronted by tran­ sients, personal safety tips when walking, book bag thefts, office thefts and bi­ cycle security were all im­ portant issues that DPS dealt with. Officer Marthel Jacobs said that no matter how many times she warns people \"violence is every­ where, stay aware and alert to what is going on around you.\" Escort is a service that provides transportation in and around the USG area. Students could call Escort fifteen to thirty minutes prior to the time they needed to leave and they had a free and safe way to get around.

The introduction of this precaution allows for more crimes to be reported and for a quicker response from secu­ rity. These phones are part of the university plan to deal with emergencies. This plan is de­ signed to deal with earth­ quakes, civil disturbances and other disasters. Becoming a poster for graffiti, a power box serves as a symbol of the problems associated with combatting campus crime.

Ev­ erywhere one looked there were people picnicing, booths selling things, giving things away, students, parents and alumni jammed the streets of the campus. This was Home­ coming, a time for generations of students to gather together and share a similar experi­ ence. The booths that filled campus offered a glimpse of the present, while the alumni walking around provided a piece of the past. Current stu­ dents lent a friendly hand to those youngsters still waiting to become Trojans themselves.

The band performed several songs to a small yet enthralled audience. \"These guys are great,\" said Jeff Haber, a freshman majoring in ar­ chitecture, who was present at the performance. Saumya Meattle COMING HOME With the theme, \"A Sa­ lute to the Trojan Family\", the events of Homecoming Week 1994 were high­ lighted by the rally on Thursday night and the pre- game festivities on Satur­ day. Students and faculty gathered together in front of Tommy Trojan for the rally where the Trojan Marching Band performed as well as the Yell and Song Leaders. Mr. and Miss USC, Jason Lupei and Regan Hentz, were presented with the traditional bouquet of roses, and former USG foot­ ball star and 1974 All- American Anthony Davis spoke to the crowds, boost­ ing their spirit for the much anticipated Homecoming game against California that Saturday. The true spirit of Home­ coming was captured dur­ ing the pre-game festivities on Saturday as alumni, cur­ rent students, and families gathered together on cam­ pus to reunite with old friends and associates. Walking through campus, packed with booths and pic­ nickers, was nearly impos­ sible because of the enor­ mity of the crowds. Booths varied from sorority and fraternity chapters, alumni groups, corporate sponsors, athletic groups, and others selling Homecoming souve­ nirs. As kick-off time ap­ proached, the crowds stopped traffic as they made their way across Exposition Park to the Coliseum, kick­ ing the posts with the tradi­ tional SC fighting spirit be­ fore leaving the campus. With the spirit and com- raderie of that morning and the excitement at the Thursday night rally, the 61-0 victory over Califor­ nia that afternoon didn't seem quite so surprising, but rather appropriate with the old SC pride of the days before us, brought back that Saturday in a warm and victorious Homecoming.

LONG DISTANCE Having a significant other at a college different than your own can present many ob­ stacles, but most importantly, distance. Some students' prob­ lems are solved by the fact that the two colleges are near each other. This is true for Danny Lee, a student at Cy­ press College, and Janice Kim, a USC student who enjoy a candlelight dinner. However, most find the distance an ob­ stacle to happiness and often end these relationships before they become too serious or before they leave for their col­ lege destination. v : - 3 0 Student Life LOOKING FOR LOVE The ultimate goal for many college students is to find that perfect someone with whom they will want to spend the rest of their lives. The process of find­ ing that person is one of the more popular aspects of a college experience-dating. At USG, students had a wide variety of places to go to meet people. Whether it was on the Row, in the li­ brary, or at local hot spots frequented by students such as Snooker's or 29th Street Cafe, the dating scene was bustling with ac­ tivity. If students had access to cars, their options for a per­ fect date were even greater. Many students liked to take their dates to Santa Monica, for a day on the beach or an evening on the 3rd Street Promenade. Others headed towards Beverly Hills to the Cheesecake Factory, the Spaghetti Factory, or Mezzaluna's for a quiet din­ ner while others hit the club scene in Hollywood or CityWalk at Universal Stu­ dios. Students have many var­ ied opinions on dating as well as places to go on those dates. According to one enthusiastic freshman, Susannah Clifton, \"When you go from a high school to an university with 2 5,000 people, it really opens your eyes to all the options.\" Another student, Peter Vaughan, remarked that he has noticed that most guys in college want short term relationships, \"after all, why waste our time and energy with the same person? Fm having too much fun get­ ting to know lots of differ­ ent girls here.\" Other students may dis­ agree, because for them they would rather spend time finding someone to be with for along time. \"High school was our opportunity to date different people without seriously consid­ ering the future,\" says jun­ ior Carlos Gutierrez, \"but the popularity contest is over now, and it's time to settle down with one per­ son.\" Article by Christie Russell. ; Watching the sun go down, Edrick Burt and Nicole Willis embrace on Venice Beach.

James Su Dating on Campus 31 TRYING TO IMPROVE No one thought that it was possible to make our illustrious campus even better, but somehow they managed. Several improve­ ments have occurred re­ cently other than the build­ ing of Leavey Library. For example, serious changes were made within Escort Service, which is a safe transportation option for students at night. There had been several com­ plaints of Escort taking too long to arrive and some­ times actually missing ap­ pointments. But recently, \"the escort services struck a deal with Saturn - if USC Waiting for some passengers, a tram stops on Trousdale Parkway. The tram service planned to make many changes, including the addition of new buses and longer scheduled hours. leases 20 cars from them, they will give five extra cars for free,\" said Imaad Zuberi, chair of security affairs for the Student Senate. In ad­ dition, Saturn donated $75,000 which would go to uniforms, training, and in­ creased salaries for the driv­ ers. Plans were also being made to change the Tram Service, the buses that run from the center of campus to surrounding northern areas. The Tram Task Force wanted to change the routes and have four trams run during the day and two at night so that students were not waiting so long to get to their destinations. \"A lot of people feel that by the time they reach their destina­ tion, they could have just walked there,\" said Senate Vice President Sarah Zuercher, a student repre­ sentative to the Task Force. The new central drop-off point would have been Leavey Library instead of Trousdale, as the univer­ sity is trying to rid the cen­ ter of campus of motor ve­ hicles. Another major change on campus this year was the reorganization of food ser­ vices. The Commons has been redesigned into a gour­ met snack shop, while hot food is served at the Grill and Carl's Jr. One thing that students have been disap­ pointed with, though, is the fact that Commons no longer serves breakfast. One must go downstairs or to Carl's Jr., which has a very limited selection. Also, the food carts have been eliminated, in accordance with the university's at­ tempt to keep all vehicles off campus. Article by Michelle Ovalle. 32 Student Life Littered with tools, the Commons Caf­ eteria underwent major renovation this summer. The refurbished dining area was only one of many efforts to beau­ tify the campus. In an effort to transform USC into a pedestrian campus many steps have been taken. One of the most visible of these was the placement of several gates throughout the campus. These gates were only acces­ sible to the tram service and official USC vehicles. The most noticeable change took place at Gate 5 near Jefferson Boulevard, where in previous years it was a hazard to one's health to cross the street. These unimposing gates were simply the beginning of a program to reclaim the campus for pedes­ trians. Chris Emigh Waiting for removal, this old couch from a Cardinal Gardens apartment has seen its last days at USC. Many of the resi­ dence halls and apartment complexes underwent renovation, which included the replacement of furniture and the painting of the walls. Catharina Go Campus Improvements 33 Torching the Bruin, members of the Trojan Knights set ablaze the stuffed carcass of a bear. The annual burning of the bear is a festive time on campus. Unfortunately this feeling did not last long because of the Trojan loss to UCLA. LIVING THE HYPE Troy Week is a tradition that has lived at USC since the rivalry between the two schools of Los Angeles be­ gan. Troy Week was full of festivities with vendors sell­ ing their wares and the car­ casses of abused bears lit­ tering the campus. Troy Week has taken on several traditions over the years. One of the most amusing of these is the small bears that students drag around, hanging from their backpacks or clothes. These small stuffed animals suffer the most abuse of any Bruin. \"I ran mine over with my bike, a maintenance guy ran it over with his cart, I dragged it through the dirt, gutter, everywhere. I have trashed the thing,\" said freshman Erik Geise. This aggression for Bruins was also seen in the large bear that was hung from the Stu­ dent Union building and whose eventual fate was a funeral pyre in the middle of Trousdale Parkway. The crescendo to Troy Week was the rally. The Trojan Marching Band made a spectacular en­ trance to begin the rally and they were followed by a mob of students to the cen­ ter of campus. Several se­ nior football players spoke at the rally, firing up the crowd and verbally abusing the Bruin football team. As the crowd expected the lighting of the bear, a frenzied feeling hung over the crowd like the thick night air. Everyone turned toward the fenced-in area and waited for the fire to begin. The scene took on a cultish atmosphere as the Trojan Knights gesticulated around the symbolic bear while the crowd chanted. The flames quickly over­ took the synthetic Bruin and excitement waned as people began to leave the scene. The rally was fol­ lowed by a musical perfor­ mance that included the band X and was attended by a small but energetic group of students. Unfortunately, the spirit and fervor of the rally was not transmitted to the game as the team lost for the fourth year in a row. How­ ever, Troy Week will con­ tinue and there is always next year.

The Spirit of Troy celebrated its 25th year under the direction of Dr. Arthur C. Bartner with the re­ lease of a silver anniversary CD and special performances at each of the football games. The band is a vital part of life at this university, performing at various sporting events, ral­ lies and alumni functions. The band espouses the spirit of Troy Week by showing end­ less enthusiasm for Trojan tra­ ditions while ridiculing those of that other school.

Mudd Hall is one of the classically designed buildings on campus and the library within is one of the most spectacular in the university. James Su THE FIRST ONE The structure that began the USC legacy was Widney Hall. First constructed in 1880, the building has changed locations three times and underwent extensive renovation in 1976. The building was renamed the Widney Alumni House after the restoration was complete. At 114 years old it is the sec­ ond oldest school structure in California and has served many functions during its ex­ istence. It began as the sole campus building and has housed the School of Archi­ tecture, School of Music and the Civil Engineering School. Providing a place for research and study, the Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center plays a valuable role on cam­ pus. The center, located in the south­ west region of campus, houses its own library.

James Su A PIACE TO START The University of South­ ern California is a campus whose buildings are monu­ ments not only to the people they are named for but to the strength of the college as a whole. The University of South­ ern California opened its doors to 53 students on October 6, 1880. The uni­ versity has continued to grow and expand since that time. The university has over 160 buildings includ­ ing the North University park area, the Row and the Health Sciences campus. USC has gone through several stages of extensive expansion during its his­ tory. The decades of the 20s and 30s saw the arrival of such important buildings as Bovard Auditorium, Doheny Library, Mudd Hall of Philosophy, the Physical Education Building and the Student Union Building. The 60s and 70s were another expansive time in the university's existence. The Von Kleinsmid Center and Heritage Hall became part of the campus scene adding their impressive ar­ chitecture to the college. The seventies alone saw the construction of six build­ ings of major academic im­ portance. The Elvon and Mabel Musick Law build­ ing, the Frank R. Seaver Science Center, the Mont­ gomery Ross Fischer Build­ ing, Ray and Nadine Watt Hall of Architecture and Fine Arts, the Eileen Norris Cinema Theatre and the Annenberg School of Com­ munication all became part of the university campus and were reflections of the prosperity and continued growth of USG. The red brick and worn stone that compose the buildings that are visited every day all lend them­ selves to this university's rich history. Each building has provided a foundation for the Trojan family to grow upon and to continue its legacy of success. Article by Joseph Carmona.

Students can also obtain information about drug and substance from the Health Center. The center provides anonymous HIV test­ ing and also provides health education programs. 3 8 Student Life BARE NECESSITIES Aside from the bare ne­ cessities for survival the university provided stu­ dents with a myriad of dif­ ferent services, ensuring a solid foundation for a posi­ tive college experience. With just a phone call or a walk across campus, stu­ dents had access to educa­ tional, counseling, safety and health services. \"All these services make it convenient for us as stu­ dents,\" Sheree Shen, a sophomore majoring in bi­ ology, said. \"They are all there to make us feel more at home.\" Aside from pro­ viding a \"home away from home atmosphere,\" many services offered students different opportunities for university involvement. Departments such as the Office for Residential and Greek Life and Topping Student Center were just two, where students could find many various clubs and organizations to suit their needs. Judi Biggs-Garbuio, direc­ tor of activities at Topping, said the purpose of the cen­ ter was to provide students with an outlet with which they could utilize the skills they learn in school. \"Hope­ fully what we are doing here will help supplement what the students are learning in their classes,\" she said. The USG Counseling Cen­ ter also provided students with a variety of assistance, including one-on-one coun­ seling, group counseling, and community outreach. \"There are a variety of cri­ ses happening at the uni­ versity,\" said psychologist Dr. Mark Stevens, director and coordinator of intern­ ship training at the Coun­ seling Center. \"At times, emotional and personal problems can get in the way (of academics). Our goal is to do anything we can do for students to ensure they have a positive experience, we feel we do a good job.\" The wide spectrum of ser­ vices offered this year pro­ vided, for many students, an insurance of safety, uni­ versity involvement, good health, and academic exellence.

Student Services 39 Yearbook covers have not changed that much over the years. Most staffs ad­ here to atraditional style because of the school's conservative disposition. The most radical cover designs were pro­ duced in the 1970s. EE RODEO : A 90 YEAR El Rodeo (pronounced EL-RO-DAY-OH) has been the university's official yearbook since 1898, when the junior class published a 7 1/2 x 10 inch annual as a gift for the senior class of 1898. The book has been produced regularly every year since 1908. Its predecessor was the Sibyl, an even smaller book at 6 3/4 x 10 inches. The Sibyl was printed only once in June 1889 with a paper cover. \"The yearbook was not the first publication to carry the El Rodeo name,\" said Susan Hikida, assistant uni­ versity archivist. Students put out what was probably al6-page newsletter in 1891 called El Rodeo. But from where did the 1898 staff of five obtain the name? No one really knows, said Hikida. Two stories have circulated over the years: the common one says the title referred to the ru­ ral area on which the uni­ versity was built, while an­ other says it was named to commemorate a campus celebration that was called El Rodeo. The first of the full-sized versions was produced in 1925 with 560 pages. That year two editions were available - one reflected the popularl920s Oriental theme, the other was de­ signed around a Spanish theme, which was probably inspired by the El Rodeo name. Contests promoted the \"complete contemporane­ ous history of the current university year,\" and ads proclaiming u El Rod is here\" ran in the Daily Tro­ jan. Past books have been awarded All-American and first-class ratings by the National Scholastic Press Association. The 1990 edi­ tion won the Pacemaker Award, college media's highest honor. The yearbook's staff has 40 Student Life A staff of five was large enough to put outthefirstE/ftodeo. They were CE.D. Ballou, editor, Bertha Green and F.G.H.S.

Staff members follow a section format that has been used since the book's inception. Editors spend as many as 30 hours per week in the yearbook offices, juggling classes and work. They, along with student writers, layout artists and photog­ raphers assemble the book with the assistance of full- time staff. Limited funding, produc­ tion difficulties, and lack of student interest have plagu­ ed yearbook production at major campuses through­ out the nation in recent years. Many institutions have opted for quarterly magazines instead of a single yearbook. But this staff hopes El Rod will en­ dure another 90 years.

Academics 43 Structural Changes In LAS With Appointment Of New Dean HAPIRO REORGANIZES As the university and community at large reorga­ nized themselves on more solid ground, so also did the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences with the an­ nouncement of a new dean, Dr. Morton Shapiro, who implemented organizational changes during the sum­ mer break. In an in-depth interview printed in the September 12 edition of the USC Chronicle, Shapiro outlined many of the changes which took effect. Chief among these changes was a move from a divisional dean structure to one of functional deans. The result was the dissemination of many departments with special inter­ est deans to a more cohesive single college. According to Shapiro, this was a sign of faith in the ability of the departments to handle their own day to day opera­ tions. \"My feeling is that our departments are at a level now that we can really step back and give them greater autonomy. If the direction they're going is not consis­ tent with the direction we want them to go, we have all kinds of options. But my general philosophy is much more hands-off. Let the faculty and department chairs make the decisions. I think people should make the decisions at the level where they have the most knowl­ edge/' The office of deans is broken into three areas of supervision. The dean of the faculty, Joseph Aoun, supervises salaries, hiring and promotions. The dean of research, Maria Pellegrini, interfaces with research donors and supervises unsponsored research as well. The third area, which entails the supervision of cur­ riculum and instruction, is handled by Dean Nancy Vickers. According to Shapiro, the move to Bovard has had numerous positive effects. \"We're all in one office. We used to have four suites, now we're all together. It's worked out beautifully for a number of reasons. It makes it much easier to interact, and it's conducive to an atmosphere that I really want to foster - one of cooperation, not of people controlling different fiefdoms and arguing against each other. We're all looking out for the greater good of the college. We don't always agree perfectly on everything, but it's not set up at all in an adversarial way, which often happens in a divisional structure.\" Article by Ann Reyes- Schroeder. 4 4 Academics ; ililiiii Dr. Morton Shapiro begins his position as Dean of the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences from a remodeled set of office suites in Bovard Administration Building. Prior to the move, the College was separated into four different sites on campus. Dean Shapiro had these offices consolidated in an attempt to establish a more cohesive working environment. The advisement offices moved back into the newly renovated LAS Building on Trousdale Parkway over the summer. Advisement for some students was hindered at the beginning of the semester. Seismic renovations caused the original split of the advisement offices between the LAS Building and Grace Ford Salvatori Hall of Letters, Arts and Sciences. Richard Kim Richard Kim Dean Maria Pellegrini serves as the new dean of research for the College of Letterts, Arts and Sciences. Her role entailed supervising research projects and acting as a liaison with donors. Previously, Pellegrini served as chair of the biological sciences department. LAS Reorganization 45 Plans Launched To Expand Annenberg School OMBINING RESOURCES Though all students were not aware of the changes that were happening within the USC Department of Communications Arts and Sciences (CAAS) and the School of Journalism, plans made by university ad­ ministration have been underway all year to reveal an outstanding program for the future. The newly-named Annenberg School of Communi­ cations, a merger of the School of Journalism and CAAS, have been in the planning stages throughout the year to create an ideal program for students studying communications. \"I look forward to journalism courses being better than they are now,\" said Gerald Davison, psychology professor and interim dean of the Annenberg School. The merger will allow new ideas for combined re­ search in communication studies, such as analyzing the possibilities in print media and internet. A group of professors and administrators were formed this year to talk about these possibilities, called \"Project Initiative.\" \"We've been generating several research ideas that could be of the next century,\" Davison said. Though plans have been made to create a single undergraduate and doctoral program for the new Annenberg School, Davison confirmed that the two separate schools will each maintain their individual programs. The Annenberg Center for Communications, an augmentation of the Engineering School an d the School of Cinema-Television to the new Annenberg School, has also been discussed and is expected to be estab­ lished next year. The Center will b e a source of funding directed toward new research that could be beneficial to the three schools combined, as a united project. \"It will combine resources that have been dissipated across the campus,\" Thomas Hollihan, associate pro­ fessor and chair of the existing CAAS, said. \"The merger will bring these resources together in a way that should help attract the very best students and faeultv in the country.\" Article bv Victoria Manley. r .*?l 4 6 Academics Annenberg School for Communications is the building housing the current communications program.

Annenberg Expansion 47 CNTV Students and Alumni Dominate Film Industry Since 1929 ES T IN THE BUSINESS The School of Cinema-Television celebrated its 65 th anniversary in 1994. From its beginning in 1929, CNTV has remained an important force in the education of filmmakers. Every year since 1950 at least one USC graduate has received an Academy Award nomination, proving the great impact the USC Cinema-Television School has had on the film industry 7 . Out of the 12 highest grossing films in history, 10 have had cinema school alumni as part of the creative and production teams. \"USC alumni have created a remarkable legacy, and have had an indelible impact on the art of the moving image,\" wrote Dean Elizabeth M. Daley in the premier edition of the school's newletter, \"In Motion,\" last spring. \"It is impossible to imagine what the Hollywood film and television industry would be like today without the contributions of USC alumni.\" Several activities have taken place to celebrate the school's 65th anniversary. First of all, the school initi­ ated the USC Award for Leadership in the Entertain­ ment Industry. In a mid-May ceremony, alumnus direc­ tor-writer George Lucas was honored among others as the first recipient. This star-studded event \"paid tribute not only to George Lucas' genius, but the impact and importance of the film school,\" said Alexis Rodriguez, a CNTV student who attended the gala event. Tickets were sold at $ 10,00 0 each, and proceeds went to ben­ efit the School of Cinema-Television. On November 10, actress Lauren Bacall spoke at a luncheon to discuss her new autobiography \"Now\" at Town and Gown. Admission to the luncheon was $40, but the interview that followed, conducted by Victoria Steele, head of Special Collections at the USC Libraries, was free and open to the public. This visit marked the re-opening of the Cinema-Television Library, which moved to the ground floor of the Doheny Memorial Library. Both events boasted a high attendance by alumni, students, and faculty. The School of Cinema-Television continues to lead the nation today. It has been consistently ranked as one of the top film schools hi the nation. Article bv Michelle Ovalle. \"77V7 7'' 4 8 Academics • 77.

Cinema-Television School*s 65th Anniversary 49 5 0 Academics Exceptional Professors Dedicated to Advancing Education ISTINGUISHING IMPRESSIONS The University of Southern California boasts some of the most renown and distinguished professors in the world. Many of these professors have left positive impressions on their students as well as others in the international scholarly community. They continually strive to position LISC as an institution for academic excellence and a leader in private research. Of the many outstanding professors at USC, there are three who are noted for their dedication to research and their quest for educating others. Dr. Warren Bennis is recognized as a Distinguished Professor of Business Administration. His contribu­ tions include two best-selling books, Leaders and On Becoming a Leader. In addition to teaching, Dr. Bennis is currently one of the most popular lecturers on the corporate consulting circuit. He has also re­ ceived eight honorary degrees and has been recog­ nized with two prestigious national awards. Dr. Bennis has created a life full of power and prestige for himself and is known as one of the foremost business leaders in the nation. Al Gore even quotes him and had Bennis conduct a day-long seminar for his Washington staff. Dr. Adrian Raine is a Professor of Psychology and has been studying the biological bases of antisocial behavior for the past seventeen years. Dr. Raine re­ cently published a book comprehensively summariz­ ing his findings entitled The Psyehopathology of Crime. His studies are of great value, for they suggest that better health care at birth may prevent some children from becoming violent criminals. Dr. Leonard Adleman is a Professor of Computer Science whose main research activities are in theoreti­ cal computer science. Dr. Adleman is well-known for his work on cryptography and as one of the discoverers of the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) coding system. His experiments on adapting DNA molecules to pro­ cess information have attracted international attention and praise. His studies show that molecular computers might be as much as a billion times more energy 7 efficient than current electronic computers. Students have the opportunities of taking classes from such distinguished professors and learning from their experiences.

And they even pay me to do these things.\" With his humble disposition, Olah could easily be perceived as an average man content with his life and his work, and not as the man whose 40-year passion for science won him the 1994 Nobel Prize in Chemisty. Olah was the sole recipient of the award, which honored his research in the use of superacids, a trillion times more acidic than sulfuric acid, in effectively freezing chemical reactions, said G. K. Surya Prakash, associate professor of chemistry and one of Olah's associates. His research allowed scientists to study the intermmediate stages and products of the reactions. \"I am very proud that USC may be remembered also for science, and not just for football. I admire college athletics, but there must be balance in a school,\" he said. \"I think we have a fine school here; USC is becoming a world class major university. Maybe my recognition also adds a little to USC's well deserved recognition.\" Most of his research had been conducted at the Donald P. and Katherine B. Loker Hydrocarbon Re­ search Institute.

Thousands of people across the world, and USC, had discovered a new 7 highway that could take them anywhere they wanted to go in a matter of seconds: the information superhighway. A term coined by vice-president Al Gore, the informa­ tion superhighway described a national information infrastructure that, when completed, would allow high­ speed transmission of digitized video, sound, graphics and text via computer to every home an d business in the United States. USC students got a chance to ride this new wave of technology through the Internet. Access to the net was free to all students onee they signed on for an e-mail account. For newbies, those unfamiliar with the Internet system, University Computing Services provided courses designed to show new users how to avoid becoming superhighway roadkill. The School of Journalism offered \"Navigating the Information Superhighway,\" a course that served as an introduction to using on-line computer services to gather and disseminate information. Course instructor Dr. Carolyn Cline said she hoped that the new class would become a permanent part of the journalism curriculum. \"For journalists, the highway is the future,\" Cline said. \"Even if the online media fail, and some will, the net has changed research forever, making much more information available to journalists even in small cities miles from decent libraries. It's also making informa­ tion available much faster than ever before.\" Despite the many obvious advantages of the net, there were a few drawbacks to the system, \"It can be intensely frustrating to try to navigate, especially when you realize that certain areas are not well covered on the net yet,\" said Cline, who pointed out that as the public's knowledge of online services expanded, so did the need for information providers on the net. \"Like a crowded highway, there are sometimes vir­ tual traffic jams,\" Cline sighed. \"They call it netlag.\" Article by Nne Ebong. 5 4 Academics Dan Jurichich, is taking advantage of the national information infrastructure that allows the speedy retrieval of information.

Information Superhighway 55 Jennifer Browning Field Trips Are A Vehicle For Learning At USC EYOND LECTURES Learning by doing, so the motto goes. To expand students' learning experience beyond the walls of the classrooms, many courses integrated field trips into their curriculum. Students were offered the opportu­ nity to apply their newly gained knowledge to the real world. In Geology 109, Professor Lund led his students to the shore lines of San Pedro. Here students observed firsthand the many rock formations they studied in class. In addition, they examined the many earthquake fault lines around the area. Professor Anderson and his students from the fresh­ man seminar \"Only One Earth\" headed for the Mohave Desert for a weekend excursion in November. Along the way, students stopped by a few of the countless fault lines in the desert area, including the San Andreas and the Cueamonga faults. The trip included a short hike in the desert and the opportunity 7 to scale a sand dune. In addition, the students visited a few of the dead volcanoes. For most students, this was their first time visiting the Mohave Desert. \"I never knew that we had volcanoes near the desert!\" said Michelle Rodriguez. \"I was sick and was thinking of not going. But I am glad that I went. It was fun.\" Students from Biology 106 and 116 were introduced to marine life forms in tide pools on their trip to the San Pedro beach. Under the guidance of graduate students, students discovered a myriad of sea creatures such as clams, periwinkles, sea anemones, and sea stars along the rocky shores. Many students found the trip educational as well as enjoyable. Freshman Lillian Co thought the trip was \"much more fun and a better learning experience\" than the weeldy biology labs. \"It was neat to see them [sea creatures] in their natural environment and to see them moving.\" Article by Jing Chen, ^ 5 6 Academics : Students enrolled in Geology 109 explore the caves and rock formations of Palos Verdes.

The field trip was a part of his Geology 109 class. The earth science class was offered during the fall semester. Classes with Field Trips 57 Practical Classes Give Stu­ dents Hands On Experience KILLS FOR LIFE Classes at the University of Southern California were not just traditional lectures. Midterms and final exams did not simply ask the student to regurgitate informa­ tion. In fact, in spring of 1995 some students helped build a hom e for their final exams. The School of Urban and Regional Planning offered a unique course which combined the traditional concept of schooling with hands on experience. The students learned about vol­ unteer work, finance, construction, management and business all in one semester. The class was taught by Associate Professor James Moore and the Director of the Construction, Engineering and Management Pro­ gram in Civil Engineering, Henry Koffman. Tuition from the class went toward the project, alleviating the immense pressure of fundraising. In \"The Chronicle,\" Koffman said \"Ideally, the class will begin with the start of construction and finish with the end of construction, so they (the students) will have a chance to see the whole cycle.\" Introduction to Para-Professional Counseling (EDCO) and Edeo 440 were two other classes that provided opportunities for the students to get deeply involved in the concepts they learned. Many students who liked the class became orientation advisors or resident advisors. According to Daniel Stallings, area coordinator and EDCO instructor, the \"curriculum is designed to sup­ port personal development, not a job search.\" There­ fore, the students came out of these classes with knowl­ edge that they could apply to various leadership posi­ tions on campus, or simply within their own lives. Stallings emphasized the \"expansion of different per­ spectives on human relationships . . . success in these classes are personal development and growth.\" Business Communication, PPMT 220 and Social Psy­ chology are other examples of the many different classes on campus that gave students interactive roles in the academic experience.

Once again this reputation prevailed as roughly 60% of the 13,500 undergraduate students declared a major from among the 14 professional schools open to them. One of the advantages of attending a university with such a diverse array of choices was that undergraduates were not limited to selecting a major from within the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences in order to participate in honors programs. An Honors Research program is open to students in all disciplines. In the past, engineering students have obtained grants of $2,000 to conduct research under the guidance of faculty mentors. Thematic Option is another program which boasts a national reputation and has produced several of USC's Rhodes, Marshall, Luce, and Fulbright Scholars. This interdisciplinary core curriculum is dedicated to deconstructing the artificial walls established between history, literature, philosophy, and science. Honors Admission is available to a select group of freshmen pre-business candidates as well. These stu­ dents have the opportunity to attend guest lectures and symposia, as well as obtain special academic advise­ ment Of course there are several other opportunities avail­ able for students to participate in academically chal­ lenging programs besides the honors options already mentioned. A few ambitious people opted for double major programs or added a minor to their degree. Although the reasons for choosing this option varied greatly, many students believed that in order to adapt to a rapidly changing global society it is necessary to develop many skills. As senior Jose Flores, an international relations and business major put it, \"In order to look ahead to a dynamic and challenging future an individual needs more than one degree. \"My business and international relations degree will give me the opportunity to meet those challenges and succeed.\" Article bv Ann Reyes-Schroeder.

Popular Professional School Majors & Multiple Majors 61 CAS Program Designed To Help Students ETTING HELP In August of 1994 LAS Advisement and LAS Aca­ demic Relations merged to form the College Academic Services. CAS assisted students in a variety of ways. Some of their services included advisement on class scheduling, help choosing a major or minor and informing students about graduate and professional school application options. Interviewing workshops and seminars on a broad range of scholarship oppor­ tunities were also available. Advisement was directed at recent transfer students to the University, those on academic probation, and students with mandatory advisement holds on their registrations Most students sought help in course selection. The staff advisors were experts in general education re­ quirements and very helpful in designing challenging schedules. Freshman Sarah Kern had trouble choos­ ing a major. After CAS counseling, she tentatively chose environmental studies. Sarah said, \"the aca­ demic advisors at CAS helped me decide what major to declare. They guided me by counseling me and inform­ ing me about workshops that are geared toward people who don't have a clue as to what they want to do!\" Students who were dissatisfied with their majors used Academic Services to explore new disciplines. Sophomore Jodie Boytos said, \"I was a psychology major, but I wasn't happy with where it was taking me. I spoke to an advisor who helped me design a schedule that touched on many different subjects and I found that exercise science suited me best.\" Executive Director of College Academic Services, Diane MacGillivray, felt the advisement program was very successful and continued to grow in popularity. She said, \"We measure success by how much we have assisted or enriched the students at USC. By looking at the rate of retention and graduation, we know we are doing something right. In the future Academic Services plans to make the information-seeking and advising process easier and more accessible to the student body. College Aca­ demic Services hopes to go on-line to expand their outreach. This is all a part of the challenge to assist students in finding successful careers. Article by Reva Shakkottai.

Created in 1993, the Baccalaureate M.D. program accepted no more than 35 high school seniors per year based on applicants' GPAs and SAT scores. Students who maintained a 3.2 GPA throughout their under­ graduate studies and scored an eight or higher on the MCA T were automatically admitted into the USC med school, one of the top 20 medical schools in the nation. \"I read about the program in the USC application and I knew that I wanted to go to med school anyway, so I decided to try it,\" said Loren Geller, a freshman majoring in biology. \"It sounded like a really good opportunity.\" Formerly known as the B.A.M.D., the program's name was changed to the Baccalaureate M.D. to allow students to pursue either a B.A. or B.S. degree in their undergraduate coursework. \"This way they don't have to major in a science if they don't want to,\" said program assistant Gina Zavala. \"They can pursue a broader education.\" In addition to their pre-med course requirements, freshmen and sophomores in the program were re­ quired to take \"Intro to Health Professions,\" a course that provided them the opportunity to meet with guest speakers from different areas in the health care profes­ sion. Craig Rohan, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering, considered the additional course a bo­ nus. \"The admission guarantee is nice, but obviously, being able to take a med school-type class as an undergrad is a great advantage,\" Rohan said. Students in the course were also allowed to shadow a different clinical physician twice each semester and meet with patients. \"The students love it,\" said Zavala. \"That, in my opinion, is the best part of the class.\" Article by Nne Ebong. 6 4 Academics Sophomore Craig Rohan relaxes in front of the USC University Hospital. His guaranteed admission through the BAMD program provided him with the oppor­ tunity to shadow clinical physicians and meet patients twice a year. The program also required a course that allowed the students to interact with speakers from different areas of the medical field. As undergraduates in the BAMD program, Craig Rohan and Loren Geller, are already wearing the lab coats of USC's Medical School. The two were accepted into the program according to their high school GPAs and SAT scores. They maintained a 3.2 GPA and scored at least an eight on the MCAT to guarantee their admission to USC Medical School. Jennifer Browning Loren Geller is afreshman majoring in biology. As one of the few students admitted into the Baccalaureate M.D. program, Geller made visits to USC's Health Sciences Campus and the Norris Medical Library. Geller considered the program a great opportunity. BAMD 65 Jennifer Browning Students Complete Final Year Of High School At USC ARLY ARRIVALS Among the thousands of freshmen that entered USC this year, about fifty of them had not yet completed their senior year of high school. These students were part of the Residential Housing Program. Through RHP exceptional high school students were admitted to the university one year early. These students then completed their senior year of high school and fresh­ man year of college simultaneously here at USC. The students in the RHP program were comprised of diverse individuals. They came from many parts of the nation to pursue various fields such as english, engi­ neering, international relations, and the natural sci­ ences. All RHP students were recipients of either the Dean's Scholarship or the Trustee Scholarship. They were required, for the first year, to stay in either Marks Hall or Trojan Hall, the designated dean's halls. In addition, the students participated in the rigorous Thematic Option program. Many of the RHP students had demanding high school schedules far more challenging than those taken by their classmates. By the end of their junior years in high school, these students had outgrown their high schools. Juliane Roffers, who took many honors courses and BC calculus last year at her high school in Wisconsin, explained, \"most of my courses this year would have been at college level anyway, like Calculus III and AP courses.\" Like most of their older freshmen counterparts, the RHP students found college to be a place very different from high school. The obvious change was the increas­ ing sense of freedom in their daily lives. \"People here don't care if you don't come to class. But if you go, they pay more attention to you,\" commented Roffers. Many students enjoyed the wide variety of classes offered here and the liberty in scheduling them. Most RHPs described their first year experience to be challenging and enjoyable. They found that college courses demanded more effort than those in high school. However, there was also time for new friend­ ships to develop and to explore new places. Looking back upon her decision to attend USC a year in advance, junior Alice Flory declared her choice to be \"positively\" right for her.
