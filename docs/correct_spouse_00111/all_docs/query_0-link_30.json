        "text": "Review\n\nWedding Daze\n\nDirector: Michael Ian Black\n\nCast: Isla Fisher, Jason Biggs, Joe Pantoliano, Edward Hermann\n\nIn the opening scene of writer- director Michael Black's debut feature, we get a good whiff of what this film is going to be like as we find the film's protagonist Anderson (Jason Biggs — American Pie) in nothing short of an embarrassing situation as he attempts to propose to his long- term partner.\n\nIn the aftermath of the proposal, Anderson, struggling to come to terms with how his last relationship ended, locks himself away for almost a year… until he decides to go out and propose to the first girl he meets.\n\nLucky for him, beautiful waitress Katie (Isla Fisher) is not one to shy away from a challenge. When she accepts, the couple find themselves in an amusingly twisted chain of events which involves everything from meeting the parents to setting up an unlikely wedding, and most of all, flouting all those sacred rules of dating as they try to find their own love at first sight.\n\nFunnyman Jason Biggs demonstrates his flair for physical comedy and Fisher her spirited acting in this romantic comedy, which however, suffers from a director who is unable to make any ends meet here as the film loses focus by being too offbeat and bringing in a host of overly-wacky characters — to the point of being annoying.\n\n60-Second Profile:\n\nJason Biggs\n\nBorn: May 12, 1978\n\nBackground: Biggs was raised and schooled in New Jersey, but because of his early start at acting (at only age 5), he decided to discontinue his education so he left New York University in 1997, to return to acting.\n\nFirst Seen: In 1991 Biggs debuted on Broadway in Conversations with My Father, which helped land him the role in the daytime soap opera, As The World Turns, a role that earned him a nomination for the award of Best Younger Actor at the daytime Emmy awards.\n\nLucky Break: In 1997, Biggs was offered the lead as Jim Levenstein in the American Pie series of teen films, which turned him into an international hit.\n\nReal Claim to Fame: Biggs starred in Prozac Nation (2001) and just last year, his stint on MTV Reality Show Blowin' Up made him an instant celebrity icon in the reality show culture. His latest film, Wedding Daze, opposite Isla Fisher has been doing well.\n\nCareer Flops: Loser (2000) which he starred in opposite Mena Suvari and Greg Kinner, wasn't quite the same caliber as American Pie, as was his role in Boys and Girls that same year alongside Freddie Prinze, Jr. More recently, he starred in the box office flop Jersey Girl with Ben Affleck.\n\nFuture Plans: Biggs will be starring as Dan in the comedy How I Met My Boyfriend's Dead Fiancée.\n\nPrivate Life: Rumour has it that Biggs has been in a relationship with actress Lindsay Zir since 2004, although he has stated in articles and interviews that he was recently single.\n\n30 Days of Night\n\nDirector: by David Slade\n\nCast: Josh Hartnett, Melissa George, Ben Foster, Craig Hall\n\nBased on the horror comic book series of the same title, this film takes us to Barrow, Alaska, which suffers one month of constant nightfall during its winter… and very soon falls prey to a group of bloodthirsty vampires out to do some hunting.\n\nIt is up to the local sheriff Eben (Josh Hartnett) and his estranged wife Stella (Melissa George) to decide between saving themselves or rallying a group of surviving townspeople to fight it out against the superhuman creatures for a whole 30 days.\n\nFar from any award-winning material, but everybody loves a good vampire movie, especially one with the character design of the vampire done so superbly and scarily. This is a nice break from serious movies if you're a fan of frightening horror that will plunge you into a good 90 minutes of darkness and relentless, brutal killing.\n\nThe writer is a movie mad 19-year-old"
