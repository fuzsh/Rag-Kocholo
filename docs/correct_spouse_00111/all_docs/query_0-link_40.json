        "text": "NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 08: Lindsay Lohan attends the \"Mean Girls\" New York premiere at AMC Lincoln Square Theater on January 08, 2024 in New York City. (Photo by John Lamparski/WireImage)\n\nLindsay Lohan looked so fetch when she stepped foot on the red carpet of the premiere of the musical movie version of Mean Girls.\n\nThe new mom made a surprise appearance at the AMC Lincoln Square Theater in New York City on Jan. 08, 2024, the crowd going wild as stepped out from around a dark SUV and waved during her first red carpet since giving birth to her son, 5-month-old Luai.\n\nShe was absolutely glowing as she posed for photos before sitting down for the viewing, draped in an elegant black gown that featured a knee-high center slit and large symmetrical cutouts at each side of the waist that morphed into an open back. A silver, sparkling belt circled around her bare skin, cinching the center of the dress in an hourglass shape.\n\nHer long hair fell down to her waist in waves and she accessorized with a black clutch with an ornate silver applique and a pair of matching drop earrings.\n\nLohan reunited with former costar Tina Fey while there, which follows her previous reunion with Lacey Chabert (Gretchen Wieners), Amanda Seyfried (Karen Smith), Daniel Franzese (Damian) and Rajiv Surendra (Kevin Gnapoor) for a nostalgia-filled Black Friday commercial for Walmart, giving fans a taste of their characters as adults.\n\nShe posed with other new cast members, too, including Reneé Rapp, who plays Regina George, Angourie Rice, who plays Lohan's character, Cady Heron, Avantika Vandanapu, who portrays Karen Shetty, Bebe Wood, who plays Gretchen Weiners, and Christopher Briney, who plays Aaron Samuels.\n\nThe new film is based on Broadway's Mean Girls: The Musical, and also stars Tim Meadows and Fey reprising their roles of Principal Duvall and Ms. Norbury, Auli’i Cravalho as Janice, Jaquel Spivey as Damian, Jenna Fischer as Cady's mother, Busy Philipps as Regina George's \"cool mom,\" and Jon Hamm as Coach Carr."
