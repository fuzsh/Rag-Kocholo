Description :

Kirari Tsukishima is a beautiful yet gluttonous 14-year-old girl. While those around her are worshipping the popular idol duo, SHIPS, she only devotes herself to food. One day, however, Kirari, who is dense when it comes to the matters of the heart, encounters Seiji Hiwatari of SHIPS and falls in love with him at first sight. In order to be with him, she aspires to become an idol herself. With the help of SHIPS - the gentle and slightly air-headed Seiji and the bad-mouth tsundre Hiroto Kazama – and her pet cat best friend Naa-san, Kirari pursues the entertainment world, where she discovers that being an idol is not all fun and games. Kirari strives to understand how to be a good idol, and makes lots of friends along the way. She learns that being an idol is about making the fans smile!
