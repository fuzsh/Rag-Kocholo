        "text": "Back home from school at 4:30 PM. Just trolling in YouTube and at a sudden, a video of Kirarin Revolution shows up. The title says Kirarin Revolution- Anataboshi and it hypnotize me to open the video LOL. Before I open the video, I‚Äôm expecting a really cute techno song like ‚ÄúHare Hare Yukai‚Äù and I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúYay‚Ä¶cute techno song with cute 3 anime girls‚Äù. But then, when I‚Äôm open it, I‚Äôm like,‚ÄúHOLY CRAP! IT‚ÄôS DIFFERENT THAN I EXPECTED!‚Äù üòÄ\n\nAbout the video, this music and dance was all based on Milky Way, a Japanese band that consisting 3 girls, and they were wearing flashy clothes with stars as decoration and holding a star-shaped tambourine. The lead singer (Koharu Kusumi) wearing the pink clothes, and the back-up singers (Sayaka Kitabara and Yuu Kikkawa) are the yellow and blue.\n\nThe music are J-POP type of music combined with some Scottish/Irish bagpipes and dances at the beginning. Funny how all of those combine into one hit wonder, while their costumes are like flashy and holding a star tambourines. My impression to the dance and music is like ‚ÄúPretty Amazing‚Äù because I‚Äôm speechless right now!!! ^ v ^\n\nFacts about this PV, Anataboshi is the first single by Milky Way and it was released by the Zetima label on April 30, 2008 on both limited and regular edition. This song known as the sixth opening theme of Kirarin Revolution and it was peaked at #3 in Japan."
