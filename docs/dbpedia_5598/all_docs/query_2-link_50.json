Though she cannot contact him, they made a promise to fulfill their respective dreams: Mitsuki wants to become a professional singer, and Eichi an astronomer.

        "text": "Both have idol and singing themes, both are really cute. ^^\n\nreport Recommended by roseice\n\nBoth revolve around singing.. and both have main characters that sing for the person they love (who is blonde in both shows!) and then yet there is a dark haired, angry \"rival\" who doesnt seem like a rival at first. Both shows have evil rivals (who have evil pets), and the list goes on. Overall, they're a fairly similar setup and if you enjoyed one, you may enjoy the other! However, Kirarin Revolution contains a lot more filler than Fullmoon.\n\nreport Recommended by katsup\n\nA young girl rises to be #1 idol. Music theme. A touch of humor. Similarity: 3*\n\nreport Recommended by yomu\n\nThe main character of each show is a young girl who dreams of becoming an idol. Both girls want to become an idol because of a boy, but along the way, their feelings change. Both also feature a lot of singing, as both Mitsuki and Kirari hold concerts, and the songs are generally fun j-pop songs. Also, both feature quite a bit of anime-original material to pad out the manga.\n\nreport Recommended by kaleidoruby\n\nsimilar because they both are a romance and there is singing in both of them\n\nreport Recommended by lily_003\n\nIn both these shows the girls wish to become idols to get closer to the guy that they love n_n\n\nreport Recommended by CuteAnimeJunkie\n\nSimilar on how a girl does her best to fulfil a dream in the show business including romance and comedy.\n\nreport Recommended by kyokyo_x\n\nIn both Kirarin Revolution and Full Moon WO Sagashite the main characters become Idols for guys that they like. In both anime the main character slowly figure out that they don't really like the boy that they think that they like but the one that has been with them from the start and that had helped them out the most. The differences in these anime are that Mistki has only a year left to live and transforms into the 16 year old body she uses to be an idol (Full Moon) while Kirari does not have a 'time limit' on life and does not transform but does more close work with the guy she likes (the one she think she likes and the one she actually likes) as well as getting partners. I recommend both anime as they are both lots of fun and have lots of comedy. &nbspread more\n\nreport Recommended by AnimePikaRumple\n\nBoth heroines are cute girls who wants to be idol for person they love. Both stories have love triangle where female protagonist at start of the series loved blonde hair boy, but end up with black haired.\n\nreport Recommended by AmaTenshi\n\nthese series have a girl who changes magically for the sake of the boy she is in love with. but in contrast to other similar anime revolving around this theme Tutu & Fullmoon have really wonderful stories & unforgetable characters. at the beginning there is comedy and romance, later drama. plus the music is a focus point (Fullmoon=singing; Tutu=dancing to classic). in short: watch 'em both.\n\nreport Recommended by DarkLaila\n\nBoth series are series where music plays a big part. In Princess Tutu the classical ballet music sets the stage for many of the series themes and in Full Moon the music is a backdrop for Mitsuki's desire to sing.They both have fantastical elements in them.In Full Moon, Mitsuki changes into a 16 year old version of herself with a healthy voice so that she can sing in order to meet the boy she loves and in Princess Tutu, Ahiru magically changes into the ballerina Tutu in order to help her love get his heart back. Both have beautiful stories with great depth in the and both are both lighthearted and sad at times. Both these series may seem like they don't have much depth in them at first, but give them a few episodes and you'll see that there really is more under the surface.&nbspread more\n\nreport Recommended by Telnari\n\nBoth are cute animes :] Female characters that have talent, as to where one is a beautiful singer and the other is a dancer. Both characters are fighting for something that they believe is the right thing to do/ or what makes them happy. And they never give up!!\n\nreport Recommended by LenDrizzle\n\nI think both of these anime are pretty long T.V. series about girls who want to encounter the ones they love. Although, I don't think Princess Tutu is about a girl who is in love with a guy from a far away land, but they both want to put a shine on them.\n\nreport Recommended by Pitrocks14\n\nFull Moon and Princess Tutu are notably similar because of their appearance as typical Magical Girl anime, but then break the rules and present us with something darker and reflective of the genre itself. If you liked the fact that Full Moon was a children's series, but with deeper concepts, you'll like Princess Tutu.\n\nreport Recommended by Kamio-chan\n\nboth are romance themed stories that focuses on girls with a special talent as well as having a focus on music as well too.\n\nreport Recommended by Disapeared_Ghost\n\nFull Moon wo Sagashite and Princess Tutu are both magical girl anime released in 2002. The story is quite dramatic even with the amount of comedy present in many episodes. Music is a key element in both series, as Full Moon has the main character transforms into an idol and is even voiced by a singer, while Princess Tutu has the main character transform into a ballerina princess and features classical music from real-life classical composers in its soundtrack.\n\nreport Recommended by Fario-P\n\n- Magical girl anime with a darker twist - Both feature heavy themes of music, although Full Moon is more about singing while Tutu focuses on dancing - Both main girls have fallen in love, but cannot confess to said boy (for different reasons, but still) - Both main girls have to hide their other identities from their friends, leading to various awkward and complicated situations\n\nreport Recommended by Atsunome\n\nThe story is alike, both shoujo and are sometimes funny and sometimes sad.. both drama's\n\nreport Recommended by Jelly_Spaghetti\n\nboth about reaching your dreams. Kaleido star is nowhere near as poignant and its romance isn't developed nearly as far as full moon but you can honestly enjoy every episode unlike full moon in which it starts off really boring/light and gets really dark and interesting.\n\nreport Recommended by midori-\n\nThey love to perform and a dream to become better. With help from spirits, they pass challenges. The main characters are optimistic so they befriend their rivals even though they show hostility. Full moon is more romantic but kaleido star can give you a good laugh and also at times it gives a slice of life feeling.\n\nreport Recommended by Lang\n\nFull Moon and Kaleido Star are both about a girl who has a dream of proforming. In both series they have to overcome hardships and have great firends that help them out. If you liked one then I'm sure that you'll like the other.\n\nreport Recommended by TR_Purin\n\nBoth involve a girl striving to make their dream (which involves presenting themselves to a large audience) come true - in Full Moon wo Sagashite Mitsuki wants to be a singer; in Kaleido Star Sora wants to be part of a Circus. The worlds they find themselves into can be harsh, but they love it nevertheless, and keep trying to get better. Through all that, they're supported by a spirit-like figure, who is always there to help/give advice.\n\nreport Recommended by MaahHeim\n\nBoth stories are about a girl who wishes to realize her lifelong dream, no matter what the cost may be.\n\nreport Recommended by Chaosutopia\n\nYou will find a similar concept of a dreamy girl trying to accomplish her childhood dream of acting in the entertainment business. Both protagonists are aided by supernatural entities that somehow relate to them and play a major role in the story and have mysterious motivations later explained. Additionally, at some point, the rivalry between Mitsuki and Madoka reminded me of the rivalry between Sora and the other girls. Definitely recommend watching both if you're into motivational anime with drama and bits of comedy. Romance also takes a major part of Full Moon wo Sagashite unlike Kaleido Star.\n\nreport Recommended by INU4SH4\n\nboth stories are focused on female mcs trying to achieve their dreams no matter what life throws at them as well as having help from certain supernatural type beings as well too.\n\nreport Recommended by Disapeared_Ghost\n\nIt's both about reaching out to your dreams/goals, though one is about singing and the other about ice dancing. Both involve death, but Full Moon Wo Sagashite develops a more serious tone in this aspect, which is quite logical considering that Ginban Kaleidoscope only covers 12 episodes, while full Moon Wo Sagashite has 52 episodes. Most important of all, both have great characters that won't give up!!\n\nreport Recommended by SonnyGoten\n\nThe atmosphere in these two great stories is very similar and so are the themes of love, death, pursuing your dreams and so on. The girls in both shows are trying to accomplish something big with the help of ghosts. You'll definitely love, laugh and cry with both shows.\n\nreport Recommended by as3\n\nGirl tries to achive dream of being figure skater, possesed by ghost, fall for eachother.\n\nreport Recommended by Binxbasilisk\n\nA romance between a human and a \"once human\"...Both heroines pursues her dreams with unexpected help from an unexpected entity. Of course, comedy is a given. Both these anime's have really great drama with their unexpected turn of events and conflicts of the hearts.\n\nreport Recommended by yUuRi_03\n\nThe main characters both want to achieve a big goal that takes more then just words said alone to accomplish. Mitsuki, 14 year-old with a beautiful voice, wants to become a singer and Tazusa, skilled figure skater, wants to qualify in the olympics. At the same time they both have a relationship with someone who isn't real (or once was). Mitsuki has her Shinigami and Tazusa has Pete Pumps. -These guys help out the main character by making sure they achieve their goal in life.\n\nreport Recommended by LenDrizzle\n\nThis is similar because both anime's have death in them. Full moon wo is a better choice for romance people. Ginban kaleidoscope is also romantic except the endings are way different . full moon wo had a more romantic ending. Kaleidoscope's ending was sort of sad but they were both really good anime.\n\nreport Recommended by animeinfatuation\n\n- Both feature teenage (well, technically Mitsuki is 12) female leads balancing school/home life with their dreams - Both incorporate themes of death/ghosts, although using different elements - Both sets of supernatural events have a known time limit effectively counting down from episode 1 - Both have a similar art style (that classic early-mid 2000s look) - Both have moments of comedy mixed in with heavy drama - Both have a bittersweet love story going on behind the main plot line\n\nreport Recommended by Atsunome\n\nBoth are magical girl series with drama and comedy and, of course, romance. Mitsuki (Full Moon wo Sagashite) and Sakura (Cardcaptor Sakura) are main characters with great character development, working very hard for their goals (even though their goals are quite different from each other), and for a time are confused with who they are in love with.\n\nreport Recommended by storygirlash\n\nBoth are cute anime about a girl who is in love with a man too old for them. They both have cute designs and characters that you will love to death. They both have special abilities and magical powers and are both fantastic anime about a girl who needs to serve her purpose.\n\nreport Recommended by Pitrocks14\n\nBoth have to do with magic, cute girls, and love. They are both aimed at the younger crowd of girls (9-14 guesstimated) and both are quite innocent. Though they have different plot lines, they have to do with love among family, friends, humans, and themselves. Oh, and they both have a small group of friends cheering them on\n\nreport Recommended by Aeowina\n\nCardcaptor Sakura is also a really nice anime but for me full moon is better. Takuto and Syoran are alike because they both love the main character and there is an annoying girl who loves them. Meroko is like Meilin. They both like someone who finds them annoying and loves someone else.\n\nreport Recommended by ayase_mitsuki\n\nBoth are based on the story of a magical girl. Full moon wo sagashite is less action based but people liking the \"CLAMP philosophy of life\" from CCS will like it. Once you start one you absolutely want to see the end.\n\nreport Recommended by Suppi\n\nboth stories are magical themed as well as also a mix of comedy and drama and also both have supernatural beings accompanying the characters on their goals as well too.\n\nreport Recommended by Disapeared_Ghost\n\nFull Moon wo Sagashite and Cardcaptor Sakura are two magical girl anime featuring a young girl who likes someone quite older than her as the protagonist. She is accompanied by a magical animal-themed mascot(s) whose appearance changes her life forever, though in Full Moon these mascots are temporary forms of other humanoid characters. The characters can be quite loveable and there is some decent comedy, though it must be mentioned that Full Moon is more dramatic.\n\nreport Recommended by Fario-P\n\nIn both anime the main character changes to older girl by magic and becomes singer/actress/photo model/..\n\nreport Recommended by Jelly_Spaghetti\n\nThese two shows are very similar. Both are about a young girl pursuing her dream of becoming a singer and doing it by transforming her body into an older version. The main difference is that Fancy Lala is very lighthearted compaired to Full Moon. In Full Moon wo Sagashite the plot is much more complex and deals with fighting against death and other things, while Fancy Lala just talks about becoming a singer. I'm not saying that Full Moon is depressing... it's incredibly interesting and if you can survive the filler episodes you'll find an awesome anime. Fancy Lala is the typical \"little girl's dream of becoming a singer\", while Full Moon is inspiring... it's about never giving up on your dreams or your life.&nbspread more\n\nreport Recommended by algelic\n\nThey are both girls who transform into an adult.\n\nreport Recommended by Riyuma\n\nBoth series have similar concepts- they both involve a girl who makes herself older to become a singer. They both also have cute 'mascots' that cheer them on, and both involve the girl becoming a model(at some point.) Of course, there's a lot of differences between the two, but I'm nearly 100% positive that anyone who likes Fancy Lala will also like Full Moon, or vice versa. :)\n\nreport Recommended by Elise_Grimwald\n\nWhen you watch this series you'll notice a lot of similarities besides they are of the Mahou Shoujo genre, in fact I have the idea the author of Full Moon based his own series in Fancy Lala the differences may be in the lenght of series that has more episodes to be told in Full Moon allowing more in depth development, and in Fancy Lala the story isn't ominous like Full Moon wo Sagashite with Mitsuki. Similarities are the protagonists thansform in a teenage version of themselves, they get their magic transformation from a pair of magical mascots, and both become famous and popular idols.\n\nreport Recommended by SourcererZ\n\nit's about a young girl that transforms herself into her older self and becomes a successful idol while dealing with hiding her identity from others with the help of two companions that are usually in stuffed animal form. The plot and feel of the shows are very similar. Full Moon wo Sagashite has more romance and other topics like the possibility death involved, while fancy lala is more about the job.\n\nreport Recommended by CherryJohnson\n\nI think the art looks the same. The voice from Luchia reminds me of Mitsuki and both animes have singing main characters altough the plot is different. They also have the same amount of episodes. They gave me the same feeling and I enjoyed those two animes. I'm sure you will like this anime if you've watched this.\n\nreport Recommended by Sisseltong\n\nwell, both of the animes revolve around girls falling in love. while in full moon, the main character isn't able to find the one she loves, in mermaid melody, luchia suffers from not being able to tell kaito who she really is. both of the main characters love to sing. and both of them have reliable friends. overall, i'm sure that anybody who enjoyed full moon will like this anime. and i apologise for ot being able to express myself very well.\n\nreport Recommended by LeMONadEice\n\nThey both have similar art (big eyes feature) and are very cute. They both involve singing, with transformations that are similar, and personalities that are almost exactly the same. Mitsuki and Lucia both like someone and make their magic mostly for them.\n\nreport Recommended by Touyariki\n\nBoth have fantasy elements like mermaids and spirits and involve romance, music, and are just cute in general.\n\nreport Recommended by KanakoMimura\n\nBoth are idol shows from the early '00s with rather similar art styles and overall feel. You don't even need to have nostalgia for these series to get that warm feeling of childlike wonder and joy, and that's partially what makes them so great and fun to watch! Mermaid Melody is generally a bit more lighthearted than Full Moon, although; both still have plenty of character drama. Watch Mermaid Melody if you're in the mood for something sunny and silly, and watch Full Moon if you wanna go on an emotional rollercoaster.\n\nreport Recommended by haydenluvsanime\n\nboth stories are magical girl romance related and also has a focus on singing as well too and has a large amounts of cute in it as well.\n\nreport Recommended by Disapeared_Ghost\n\nThe story nearly totally different but both of the series based on music and dreams. So Oosaki Nana and Mitsuki's goal is the same to be a singer, but they doing it in different way and style. Nana is for adults rather, in my opinion, especially for females.\n\nreport Recommended by boomkin\n\nThe style is very different, but both have music, love and a lot of drama.\n\nreport Recommended by Dixy\n\nBoth series revolves around a female protagonist following her dream and trying to make a name in the music industry. Nana has more mature themes while Full Moon has more comedy. However, both series contains drama that deals with many of the events that brings their dream closer but also with tragedy and sorrow. Both series has comedy, drama, and romance themes with misunderstandings, trials, and emotions.\n\nreport Recommended by Stark700\n\nLike Nana, the protagonist, Misaki wants more than anything to become a singer if it is the last thing she does. Although Nana is a much more mature anime, I found them both really enjoyable and emotionally moving.\n\nreport Recommended by Animelover820\n\nBoth are romance themed stories that focusing around an aspiring musician and the friendships she makes along the way and both have a sad and downbeat kind of feel to the story tone in it as well too.\n\nreport Recommended by Disapeared_Ghost\n\nFull moon is gentler/sweeter than Skip Beat, but both are really great stories! If you like show-biz anime with humor and romance, watch these two!\n\nreport Recommended by as3\n\nSkip Beat and Full Moon wo Sagashite both are about the idol world, romance, comedy, and are both a shoujo anime. Skip Beat is not as lengthy and doesn't have fillers like Full Moon wo Sagashite, which is a plus. Full Moon wo Sagashite is directed toward children, but Skip Beat is more for the young adult. Another similarity is that the main characters both have love issues.\n\nreport Recommended by Chidashi\n\nI loved both animes very much, and they have some similar themes. Both girls want to become famous so that they can reach out to someone they love/loved. In Skip Beat, Kyoko (the main female character) wants to get famous so that she can get revenge on the guy she formally loved. Still, both Full Moon wo Sagishite and Skip Beat have very interesting, different storylines from the typical shoujo. Even the characters are very unique and spunky.\n\nreport Recommended by Redvines32\n\nBoth of these animes have to do with a girl trying to reach their goals in show biz. They both made me laugh and kept me in tune with the characters very well. I love the fact that they were driven by their emotions and kept competing when things might have seem down. Full Moon has a very innocent and sweet approach, while Skip Beat has a more funny and eccentric way to look at it. If magic-girl animes aren't your cup of tea, Skip beat will definitely please you with a more realistic trip. (Oh, and don't forget both had awesome songs)\n\nreport Recommended by Aeowina\n\nboth stories are focused around the entertainment industry and has a female mc going through no matter what the cost they go through as well as also a focus on romance in it as well too.\n\nreport Recommended by Disapeared_Ghost\n\nThese two anime feature a young girl who can transform into an older, beautiful idol with the help of two magical creatures. The girls in both have certain restrictions on their powers. The style of the anime has a happy feel, but Full Moon includes a touch of tragedy.\n\nreport Recommended by Valkyrie_Wings\n\nBoth series has the young girl, who by magic transforms into beautiful teen who eventually becomes an idol sensation. Full Moon is a little darker and more tragic than Creamy Mami, amd Creamy Mami is more of a magic girl than Full Moon, who never performed any magic. Creamy Mami is fun and lighthearted, with some dramatic moments.\n\nreport Recommended by PeppermintHearts\n\nThe background of the protagonists is pretty much different, but in some ways, the heroines are quite similar. Both are young girls, who change into older forms to become idols. Both have a somewhat chaotic manager. Both have a rival in their idol form, who is on good terms with the younger incarnation (more extreme in Full Moon, where Madoka regards the protagonist as both best friend and biggest enemy) Both have 2 magic companions, male and female (animals in Creamy Mami, with animal features in Full Moon) So if you watched Full Moon and you are looking for a similar hero in a more light hearted setting, you may go for Creamy Mami. Or, coming from Creamy Mami, you can go for Full Moon, for a more melancholic story.&nbspread more\n\nreport Recommended by Estefan\n\nFull Moon wo Sagashite and Magical Angel Creamy Mami are both magical girl anime that are part of the magical girl idol subgenre (in fact, the latter actually CREATED the subgenre)—as expected from something with that classification, good songs are abound. The main character can transform into an older girl who sings really well and eventually becomes a superstar in the idol industry. Full Moon wo Sagashite is quite dramatic and sad though.\n\nreport Recommended by Fario-P\n\nBoth have bright color themes. Full moon has shinigami's which are good in this one, Takuto and Meroko. They make the series quite Magical girlish. Also, Mitsuki transforms into a older version of her to sing, so they both have transformations.\n\nreport Recommended by NyaNatsuki\n\nNow how are these anime similar? - Takuto and Meroko have, just like the main characters in Tokyo Mew Mew, magical powers with some sort of animal theme. - Both series have a romantic relationship developing along the way. - These series will give you the same kind of feelings. Mitsuki's character is similar to Ichigo's. - FMwS is a bit darker than TMM. Mitsuki is sick, which has some consequences in her life. Ichigo does enter dangerous situations but isn't limited because of any sort of health issue. Chances are pretty big that if you like one, you'll like the other one as well.\n\nreport Recommended by SweetSerenadexX\n\nBoth focus around a magical girl dual identity concept, and also both series have a character, that’s also involved in the entertainment industry as well to note and both also have lots of friendship and romance related elements in it as well too.\n\nreport Recommended by Disapeared_Ghost\n\nBoth start as comedies with a lot of fun until an unexpected turn of events which leads to drama and near the end somehow it becomes darker. Both have a naive goody goody protagonist that ends up befriending people who are in a supernatural situation[shinigami/cursed family]. Both have extremely cliche situations but extremely well executed. Amazing ost and voice actors. Both have a lovely character that can turn into a bunny[Meroko/Momiji] and another one who can turn into an impulsive cat[Takuto/Kyo]. Both animes try to give you life lessons (the power of love, friendship, family, bonds etc).\n\nreport Recommended by Orulyon\n\nSupernatural shoujo drama comedy. Both have a story which is light and funny in the beginning, but still with a kinda dark feeling, and then takes a much deeper and dramatic turn. The series are both about a girl who's living a quite normal life until they meet with some strange people (who can turn into animals) and their whole lives abruptly changes. The art is quite alike too, very cute. Tohru reminds me of Mitsuki in many ways. They don't have any parents but are still really happy persons who thinks that life is great, and they're both trying to enjoy it to the fullest. They are both extremely kind (maybe a bit too kind for their own best) and both have keep a great secret, Tohru about the Sohma curse and Mitsuki about her secret life as a singer. They even pretty much look alike. Kyo and Takuto are very alike too. Both are trying to be a cool and tough guy, but in the reality they are really sensitive and caring. They both care very much for the main character and are completely in love with her, although they're trying to deny it. And both can turn into a cat. xD Both series also give away the same, wonderful feeling that makes you scream for more.&nbspread more\n\nreport Recommended by Michi-chan\n\nLikewise, Full Moon is a similarity of Cowboy Bebop. Both protagonist are assisted by a group of unknown people. Faye is like Meroko because Faye has an attitude, Jet I guess could be like Takuto. Since he likes to assists others and likes Spike. Can't recommend any other characters except for Spike who is like Mitsuki. I'd say that Full Moon is like this movie because they both have protogaonist going around the world like a rolling stone to things that they haven't been to before and are glad to be there. Full Moon is more happy, Cowboy Bebop is violent so let the children watch Full Moon and if they like violence, then they should like CB. As it does have a similarity of people helping other people and other kiddish things.&nbspread more\n\nreport Recommended by Pitrocks14\n\nBoth feature melancholic story themes as well as also nice art to look at and character designs and a young female character as well too and also lots of good music.\n\nreport Recommended by Disapeared_Ghost"
