But from my edit message there, if in the future. For any names that may change. Would I add in the |RTitle= or leave it be? As some names are different at crunchyroll and when adult swim shows it, some named episode titles are from funimation. Or both names are from the two. like the first episode, but not the second one and so on. Tainted-wingsz (talk)\n\nYou need to decide what titles you are presenting on the table and what will be footnoted. The main could be \"Adult Swim English title\" as the show as broadcast on Adult Swim has airdates listed and the episode's DVRs would refer to this title. Or the main could be Funimation English title since home media ultimately gets to pick the official title. Or it could be the Japanese translated title. You can see List of Suzuka episodes or List of Initial D episodes or List of Glitter Force episodes as examples of the listings as used with the Japanese translated title. The current footnote is confusing. You should either list \"Guardians\" / \"Those Who Protect\"(footnote: title from X version) or \"Those Who Protect\" / \"Guardians\"(footnote: title from X version). AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nah ok. And for some past episode titles should I add that too? other than the three changed episode names. Tainted-wingsz (talk)\n\nOnly if there are chances it would be referred to as such by reliable sources, not if they are unofficial translations. Sometimes Funimation or Crunchyroll will attempt to translate the original Japanese title, so those efforts can be recognized. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nAs before there was three edit attempts where an ip added funimation's episode title over crunchyroll's spelling to the episode titles. On the first try was before it was moved from \"move to new page.\" When the other two was on the \"list of; page/ article.\" Then I saw what episodes had different titles from seeing it on a comcast t.v. and looking at funimation's and crunchyroll's web-site too. Like for episode 2 it goes \"A Young Man's Vow\" (adult swim/ Funimation) \"The Boys' Promise\" (Crunchyroll) While both versions; the scene with the opening song is about to end, it tells the episode title. and I went ahead and did that. Tainted-wingsz (talk)\n\n(Somewhat related question) there was someone asking about the black clover airdates, as the asked person had viewed. On its talk page too. \"If Funimation is ahead a few episodes, from Adult Swim's airdates.\" Unblue box (talk)\n\nThere has been an editor in particular @Splouge: who insists on keeping the \"Setlists\" on the article. I addressed the issue on my talkpage a few months back and my same concerns linger on the notability of them, or if they are needed at all. Any thoughts? - Knowledgekid87 (talk)\n\nI have come across others, not just on the talk page of @Knowledgekid87: who find the setlists useful, bringing together information on the live performances onto a single page that can easily be browsed and searched.\n\nSplouge (talk)\n\nI'm not arguing about their usefulness, this may not be the proper place for them is all. There are WP:OR and WP:V concerns to think about. - Knowledgekid87 (talk)\n\nIt's too detailed for the festival article. Usually setlists are provided to indicate recurring songs for concert tours as they can then be backed up with news article reviews. But the set list shown is for a specific date and it isn't notable on its own unless it's something like List of performances and events at Woodstock Festival. It should better be left as wikia or setlist.fm material, the latter could be added as external link. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nI'd appreciate more specific information about retaining the setlists (I have never used wikia or setlist.fm and am lacking experience of them being referenced from Wikipedia). The media (CD and video releases) are also lacking some details and I wouldn't want to add them only to have them removed again. Splouge (talk)\n\nThe media is easier to source and is more notable in the context of the event. Keep in mind that Animelo Summer Live also has the setlists viewable on their website. I feel bad that you rely on them to get your info as I have been in this position, but there are some thing that are just not encyclopedic for Wikipedia. This doesn't mean the world has to end though, I am sure fan sites exist out there that this info can be copied over to. - Knowledgekid87 (talk)\n\nPer WP:ANRFC #1, closing RFC since a clear consensus has emerged. There is a clear consensus that both licensees can be listed provided it can be referenced to both companies or are under the joint announcement. MizukaS (talk)\n\nThe following discussion is closed. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page. No further edits should be made to this discussion.\n\nThere's a lot of anime that are dubbed by Funimation's in house studio, and listed on Crunchyroll at the same time. That tends to be the case with simuldubs, taking their partnership into consideration. So, what is the point of this topic, really? Currently, there is a user that goes by The Farix that is arguing that if there is no \"license acquisition announcement\", then no licensee shall be listed. Except, it's common knowledge that a company would not be granted legal dubbing rights UNLESS they bought a license in the first place. I'm not sure why he is struggling to understand such a simple fact, to be honest. MizukaS (talk)\n\nWhy is this an RFC and not a dispute resolution WP:DR? Can you provide the licensing references for the show? I wouldn't list it in the infobox if it isn't clearly stated in a reference. If there's a detailed explanation on how it works it can go to a \"Licensing\" section. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nThis is part of a larger issue with the Crunchyroll/Funimation partnership. Primary and reliable secondary sources don't sufficiently explain who who holds the \"master license,\" all we usually get is a vague \"Crunchyroll is streaming it and Funimation is dubbing it,\" announcement from AnimeNewsNetwork. Because of this, we end up in this silly \"Coke vs. Pepsi\" brand rivalry situation, where editors run around changing who's listed in the infobox without any kind of consensus. Given the current circumstances I think the only options are to either list both companies as the licensee, or to list neither, as TheFarix is suggesting. Personally I prefer the former option, but regardless of which one we choose, this consensus should apply to ALL shows under the Crunchyroll/Funimation partnership. CurlyWi (talk)\n\nI'm glad that this is being acknowledged as an issue. That's the point of RFCs, right? To resolve disputes like these. I've started a subsection below, so go ahead and tell me what your perspective is. For the record, I am in agreement with Curly. MizukaS (talk)\n\nShould we list Funimation AND Crunchyroll as the licensees, just Funimation because they're dubbing the series, or neither?\n\nNote: This only applies to shows that are licensed under the Funimation/Crunchyroll partnership.\n\nList both: Taking their partnership into consideration, both companies have bought their own license for the anime. Crunchyroll has the subbing rights, while Funimation has the dubbing rights. It is erroneous to list neither licensee and it would give off a heavy implication that no company has licensed the series at all. MizukaS (talk)\n\nList both: Since reliable sources don't make any kind of distinction, we should list shows in the Crunchyroll/Funimation partnership as being licensed by both companies. CurlyWi (talk)\n\nTheFarix is right that we can't list one or the other, as that is just speculation at this point. MizukaS is also right that we do know the show is licensed, or it wouldn't be being streamed at all. Of course, I don't think the show is actually licensed by both companies like MizukaS says, as that would be ridiculous. One of them has the license and has sublicensed it to the other (in most of the cases of contention, I'm pretty sure Crunchyroll owns the license and is sublicensing it to Funimation). However, as previous threads on the topic have pointed out, there's no way to really know until the home video release comes out, or until one of the companies puts out a press release, like Crunchyroll did for winter 2017. So for now, we should either list both (with an {{efn}} note explaining the situation), or list neither. G S Palmer (talk • contribs)\n\nI agree that a note should be included to prevent confusion. MizukaS (talk)\n\nside question, home video is the dvd/ blue ray? Like this. The picture to the right in the ref/ source. I noticed that it listed three shows from the bottom up, that were shown during the spring season or just 'spring 2017'. Unblue box (talk)\n\nHome video refers to DVDs and Blurays, yes. MizukaS (talk)\n\nAround the time I was new here. I used to live by some rural areas. Right after leaving school (A 'k to eighth grade' but then the town I lived at, placed a high school a street away and somehow changed it from k to twelfth grade. When it was done being built.) Which since then they used vhs. The school was really slow on shifting from vhs and move on to the cd or dvd. Unblue box (talk)\n\nWho was the one that wrote the VHS comment again? Please sign your post. MizukaS (talk)\n\nThe box cover pictures in that article do not show the companies (perhaps it's on the back cover?) so it's mainly going by the verbiage from the article itself which discusses the joint production for the three shows. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nIt depends - Theoretically, Funimation tends to be the licensee while Crunchyroll is just a streaming site where the licensors stream their content (though CR does have some series that they themselves have licensed). For licensing information, it's generally a good idea to mention what the licensor is based on what the sources say. So if ANN or Crunchyroll or some other site says that Funimation and Crunchyroll have licensed the series, then mention both. If only Funimation is mentioned, then mention Funimation alone, maybe at best noting that the series streams on Crunchyroll. If there's no licensing information, maybe at best note that it has been licensed for streaming, but leaving the licensing information as a footnote or something. Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew\n\nDepends it would apply to the joint announcements as with the one Unblue box referenced, but not retroactively to old titles prior to their partnership. It would have to be something in which both companies were involved in the production of the English content. I would go by Narutolovehinata5's suggestions and back it up by the references in the infobox. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nThe ref/ source I used was to tell what did a home video looks like. And the info popped up and that was the closest example I thought of. Which only may apply to the three listed names. Unblue box (talk)\n\nDepends per Narutolovehinata5's reasonings. Lord Sjones23 (talk - contributions)\n\nList both as long as it concerns titles that fall under the joint announcement, like Narutolovehinata5 and AngusWOOF described above. Provided this only applies to those titles, I think it best to provide what information there is (with an additional note) to avoid confusion and dispute.--FacultiesIntact (talk)\n\nThe discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page. No further edits should be made to this discussion.\n\nMizukaS, please modify your conclusion. The consensus is that both can be listed provided it can be referenced to both companies or are under the joint announcement. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nIt has come to my attention that this hasn't been updated in almost a year. Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew\n\nI've posted about it before on Meta. The discussion ended up on the project banner's talk page. I don't remember it going anywhere from there, but there's a small update at the bottom of the discussion. Opencooper (talk)\n\nTo get this page to work, it should be listed here. ~Mable (chat)\n\nToday I noticed that Blackgaia02 has changed the infobox images for Ace Attorney (anime) and Darling in the Franxx – two articles specifically about anime series – from anime key art to manga adaptation cover art. I reverted it for Ace Attorney as \"the primary subject here is the animated series, and the infobox image's main purpose is visual identification, so it makes no sense to use the cover of the manga\". Blackgaia02 re-reverted this with the reasoning that \"anime posters always falls into grey area. Usually gets replaced once better media representations of the series (DVDs, BluRays and Mangas) were released\".\n\nIs this really right? I don't understand what is even meant by \"falls into a grey area\". To me it is very clear that the best representation of an anime is artwork for the anime – not artwork for a related piece of media, drawn by a different artist in a different artstyle.--Alexandra IDVtalk\n\nI understand that one may want to replace such posters with video covers, but using manga covers for such articles indeed seems odd to me. At the very least, this change is not an improvement at all. ~Mable (chat)\n\nIt depends. For adaptations, it's best to go present the original source material in the infobox, but for articles about original anime or articles on individual anime, using the anime art is perfectly acceptable in the infobox. In this particular case, the Darling in the Franxx anime is the primary media and the manga is just an adaptation, so the anime poster should be the infobox images. This is not a gray area at all, it's standard practice. In any case, I've reverted the Franxx edit. Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew\n\nNote that Ace Attorney is not an anime adaptation of a manga, either - it is an anime adaptation of a video game series. The manga is not the source material, it was just released alongside the anime as promotion for it.--Alexandra IDVtalk\n\nI think that the manga image is fine for now for Ace Attorney as the anime one is just promotional art, is there an anime image that goes with the Blu-ray or DVD cover? - Knowledgekid87 (talk)\n\nFrom my experienced, anime series always use their first series while mangas use the first tankobon cover. Still, there are also multimedia franchises like Hamatora and Devil Survivor 2: The Animation that use whatever came first.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nYeah, I feel there is a general consensus to go with whatever media came first for a given work unless specified otherwise on a case by case basis (ex: free versus non free content). - Knowledgekid87 (talk)\n\nI would go with the anime in this case. The poster has been up since December 2015 and the manga image was uploaded today. Also when looking at the article while the manga technically came out first (March 2016) the anime was originally announced at the 2015 Tokyo Game Show which occurred in September of that year.--67.68.210.105 (talk)\n\nConsidering the subject that takes precedence in the anime's article is, well, the anime, that should be reason enough to keep the key visual. Of course, I managed to find the DVD box art on the official Aniplex Blu-ray/DVD page, but it's very bare-bones, not even showing the title. Still, the poster seems like the best choice. User:SubZeroSilver (talk)\n\nHad written Draft:Iroduku Sekai no Ashita kara and Draft:Blackbox (anime), and another user has since created Iroduku Sekai no Ashita kara and Blackbox (anime); could someone merge the history of the pages? Thanks. Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew !\n\nHistory merges are only for attribution related to copyright - such as in the case of copy-paste moves. Since I didn't use any of your text (I didn't even see your drafts), doing a histmerge would be misleading and unnecessary. G S Palmer (talk • contribs)\n\nAlso, the article is Blackfox, not Blackbox (anime). G S Palmer (talk • contribs)\n\nNoted. Since articles already exist and the Draft text wasn't used, I'll just G7 my drafts. Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew\n\nPlease see my question at Talk:Granblue_Fantasy_The_Animation#Episode_14?_Pumpkin_Lantern. Tnx, --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nThis is just a notice to the WikiProject that MizukaS has been blocked indefinitely by TonyBallioni as a sockpuppet of Sk8erPrince, the details are at Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Sk8erPrince. Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew\n\nWow, just sad to see is all as he couldn't even last 2 months. - Knowledgekid87 (talk)\n\nIt looks like it's been reopened with the account Yoashai. DragonZero (Talk · Contribs)\n\nThe articles chibi (term), super deformed and Q-version are essentially about the same thing, and I think they should be merged together. While chibi can mean other things in Japan, the article is clearly about the artstyle and not \"small\" characters in general. I am leaning towards chibi (term) being the main title, because it's the most commonly used term in sources, but if anyone objects, let me know.ZXCVBNM (TALK)\n\nThe word \"Chibi\" is the WP:COMMONNAME here so I would definitely go with that one. - Knowledgekid87 (talk)\n\nI would go with Chibi (slang) as with Moe (slang). AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nSince there are no objections, I will merge the pages together. - Knowledgekid87 (talk)\n\nThe merge has been completed. If you want to help improve the article than take a look at the sources present at Talk:Chibi (slang)#Reference dump. - Knowledgekid87 (talk)\n\nI'm working on Draft:List of Resident Evil media. The comics section is pretty small but I have a feeling there is more manga related to this old series than what I can find. I'm not good at looking up Japanese sources and translating yet. If someone knows any manga for this series, could you help me add it to the list?Blue Pumpkin Pie (talk)\n\nUm, how will that work with the Resident Evil media franchise article? AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nI saw that Final Fantasy had List of Final Fantasy media and thought Resident Evil needed one too. Others in WP:VG agreed. I don't know where the link will go once its a real list and not a draft but I assume the link it will go in the \"Media\" section.Blue Pumpkin Pie (talk)\n\nOkay, that would work. I just didn't want to see detailed video game tables on both pages. WP:CFORK AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nOnce the list is made, I think the current list in the main page will be shortened to the main series. I haven't discussed it that far ahead so I can't guarantee it.Blue Pumpkin Pie (talk)\n\nCould someone who reads Japanese take a look at this source from Natalie and tell me whether it says that the Arifureta manga launched in that issue, or merely switched there from somewhere else? Thanks. G S Palmer (talk • contribs)\n\n@G S Palmer: It says that the manga by RoGa started in Comic Gardo, and that that online magazine began on December 22, 2016. It also says the first volume was released a couple days later, but it doesn't look like those chapters had been serialized anywhere else beforehand. The website's archive indicates that manga was there at launch date.--十八\n\nOK, thanks. G S Palmer (talk • contribs)\n\nHello,\n\nI have created this draft for the live action film. This ok? Artix Kreiger (talk)\n\nCan you check WP:NFF and whether principal photography has begun on the film? Also it might have to be further specified like Naruto (2018 film) as there are a bunch of animated films in Naruto#Films. Has the title been confirmed? AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nShould the episode lists of D.Gray-man: List of D.Gray-man episodes (season 1), List of D.Gray-man episodes (season 2) and List of D.Gray-man Hallow episodes be moved to be similar to the ones from the Naruto series that don't use \"List of\"? Also, season 1 and season 2 are divided based on their Japanese home media release while Funimation's release instead made 4 seasons. Cheers.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nI say it would be ok to change the name for Season 1 and 2 but I'm not familiar with Hallow. is that sequel or an actual season of the original?Blue Pumpkin Pie (talk)\n\nSure, that would fit the naming conventions for television seasons WP:TVSEASON. You can see List of Fairy Tail episodes (season 2) for how they have home media for Collection 3 in the Funimation release. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nHallow is a direct sequel but the number starts from \"episode 1\" instead. Still, I'm not an expert in wiki episode tables so I have no idea how to rearrange it.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nI'm not an expert either. But I think it makes more sense to rename it season 1 if its an official sequel to the original anime.Blue Pumpkin Pie (talk)\n\n@DragonZero: Pinging DragonZero considering how experienced he is with episode lists.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nWell season 1 and season 2 clearly have a continuity in numbering in the overall episode season. [1] Hallow is kind of far away, almost like a reboot or like what Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card, almost 16 years away (Hallow is 8 years away) is compared to the original series. If they renamed it season 3, as with Tenchi Muyo Ryo-Ohki OAVs, then you could add the continuity in numbering. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nI agree with Angus about Hallow. I think it's safe to say the first D.Gray-Man series can be reorganized to its American division, and can drop the \"list of\". For Hallow, I would probably keep the \"list of\" unless it has season divisions. DragonZero (Talk · Contribs)\n\nI see. The thing is that both Aniplex and Funimation did different splits within the original anime. In Aniplex's release there are two seasons, while in Funimation there are four.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nI moved season 1 but I don't have the permission to move season 2.Tintor2 (talk)\n\n@DragonZero: If you are interested change to Funimation's organization of the series if you want since that would make lists easier to edit. I'm not that good at episode lists.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nUpdate: managed to move season 2 thanks apparently to the users from WP:Requested moves.Tintor2 (talk)\n\n@DragonZero: Help: I've just done the splits but there are apparently some technical issues within season 3 and season 4 tables based on the execution.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nI tried fixing the episodes' tables but there are still issues with them, to the point of collapsing with the main list.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nJust a heads up that Wikipedia:WikiProject Anime and manga/Popular pages is working again. Oornery (talk)\n\nLooks like Zamasu fails WP:Notability. He is one arc character so I wonder if his article should be merged. Also, I would gladly try to bring Rurouni Kenshin to GA if somebody wants to help me.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nRecently, I finished editing the heck out of the page List of Durarara!!×2 episodes, mostly the episode list section, which had incomplete tables and missing summaries. Due to the amount of information presented, and just like List of Durarara!! episodes, summaries are only able to be written in 350 words or less (not the desired 200 words or less). This is just a post to show you all a mass edition of a page that needed fixing that I mostly fixed.... for now. AnimeEditor (communicator • database)\n\nFrom the first episode \"By partially transforming her motorcycle Shooter back into a horse, Celty goes up the side of a building\" & \"with Mikado noting how the city of Ikebukuro has not changed at all. \" I can see this being under 200 words. Episode summaries should contain the points that move the plot forward instead of play by plays. DragonZero (Talk · Contribs)\n\nBefore I started working on this page, the first five episodes were well over 600, 700, 800 words long.... Most of the other summaries were blank or incomplete. The summaries I edited/added aren't a play-by-play exactly, because that would result in summaries lasting 600, 700, or 800 words long! Many details are left out. If you saw the original summary compared to the edited summary, you would see the big difference! I truncated, condensed, shortened, cut out all the detail of the first five episode summaries, which was very difficult to begin with. Then from that point on, I was on my own, seeing that 200 words or less was not achievable. But I also compared with the first season (List of Durarara!! episodes), and the episode summaries I helped edited are still there, many of which are still over 200 anyways, so I told myself that \"350 words or less is what I should promise\". Also, I had added the English air dates to each table, as well as numbered the episodes by season and cour, since there are three cours in this season and each cour has twelve episodes. AnimeEditor (communicator • database)\n\nI want to be more specific. I didn't want to aim for 350 words. I just wanted 350 words to be the limit. The only episode that came very close to 350 words was the very last episode, even with rearranging the flow of events (since they tend to go back and forth), cutting out as much detail as possible, and not mentioning unimportant scenes or actions. AnimeEditor (communicator • database)\n\nAh, I'm not downplaying your contributions or anything. Just noting what the next step would be if you want to improve it further. DragonZero (Talk · Contribs)\n\nI think that is the best I am able to do on that page. Ryōgo Narita intended for Durarara!! and Durarara!!×2 to be laid out in a fashion where bits and pieces of the puzzle are placed, while the plot is being told (in my opinion). I tried to create the \"Oh!\" moments throughout the series. But again, I didn't mention every single detail and scene. Just the ones that felt needed in the summaries to flow better. I hope that clears up the confusion. AnimeEditor (communicator • database)\n\nPerhaps an \"Oh!\" moment could be when Mikado accepted an unknown object as a gift from Ran without hesitation (episode 30), and you are wondering what is this object. When Masaomi and Mikado reunite for the last time, Masaomi tries to reason with Mikado during their confrontation, and when Masaomi gets on top of Mikado to punch him, Mikado retaliates with a pistol glove to Masaomi's left leg (episode 35). The pistol glove is the unknown object. I did leave out a scene when Akabayashi talked with Aozaki about messing with Mikado (which was happening at the same time when Mikado and Masaomi were fighting), but I was self-debating if that scene was worth mentioning in the summary of episode 35, which would tie in more about the pistol glove's existence. But instead, I left it out, hoping that the pistol glove's existence and the unknown object as a gift would connect to the reader. AnimeEditor (communicator • database)\n\nI have been tweaking the summaries a bit, but they are still presented in a \"puzzle layout\" while the plot is being told. There are implications and assumptions figured out based on how they are written such as \"At night in a park, Egor attacks a zombie\" (episode 2) and \"Hollywood is conflicted with mixed emotions about her monstrous crimes and is revealed to be dressed as a zombie.\" (episode 3). Of course, that means Egor was attacking Hollywood (later recognized as Ruri), who was dressed as a zombie. Anyways, I hope that I improved the page enough. AnimeEditor (communicator • database)\n\nIs there a better infobox that can be made for franchises like Cyborg 009? That's a really long infobox, I don't think it would be that useful being that long. For series like this, would it be better to use the template:infobox media franchise instead?Blue Pumpkin Pie (talk)\n\nSince both of these publishers just reformatted their websites/changed their domain names (Square Enix's book pages moved from http://www.jp.square-enix.com/magazine/top/introduction/detail/[ISBN].html to https://magazine.jp.square-enix.com/top/comics/detail/[ISBN]/, and MF Bunko J moved from http://www.mediafactory.co.jp/bunkoj/book_detail/[ID] to https://mfbunkoj.jp/product/[Title]/[ID].html), it seems like there's going to have to be a concerted effort to go through and update all the pages that reference them (i.e. in volume lists). Is there a way to automate the process, or does it need to be done by hand? And if it can be automated, maybe we could also use it to fix any remaining broken Yen Press links.

Please see the discussion here. --NaBUru38 (talk)\n\nI decided to give a look at the Captain Tsubasa articles but I'm confused in how we should call the sport: football or soccer?

Cheers.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nAlso, if possible, could anybody help me to find a source that confirms Nozomu Sasaki voiced Tsubasa Oozora? I'm trying to expand and reference the character article.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nProbably not the expert on this one, but soccer has less confusion than football in my humble opinion. Everyone knows what soccer is, but there will always be that troll who says \"this isn't football, its soccer!\"Blue Pumpkin Pie (talk)\n\nWP:FOOTY might be able to offer an opinion on this. Generally I would go with football unless its known in a given topic to be referred to as soccer. Note the article Football in Japan. -- ferret (talk)\n\nWhy not call it association football? The only reason it would use soccer is if its particular English manga/anime version uses that term everywhere. Then it doesn't get confused with Eyeshield 21 which covers American football. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nYeah I meant association football, was just typing quickly. -- ferret (talk)\n\nWhat does the English dub use? Soccer or football?Blue Pumpkin Pie (talk)\n\nI'm not familiar with this series in particular but quickly read the leads on the articles. The main character's hopes to compete in the FIFA World Cup though kinda seals the deal. When the context is FIFA, always use association football, per WP:FOOTY. I'd just go with that. Soccer should only be used in clear American contexts. -- ferret (talk)\n\nSee Talk:Pokémon Adventures#Shonen?.

Already left my impressions there. Regards.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nA fellow anon and me are trying to expand the article Captain Tsubasa by updating every section and adding references. Its Japanese article has become a FA featuring hundreds of references by the way. A help from other users might be welcome. Cheers.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nI managed to tackle most games and mangas. However, I can't find anything about the 80s and 90s anime adaptations (alongside the films and OVAs). The Japanese article has everything sourced but I have no idea what to use due to my lack of knowledge regarding Japanese. Could an experienced user check it? Cheers.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nFrom some shows I come across, doesn't usually the character listing have 1 to 7. As a ref/ sources may list it that way, when I came upon at Devils' Line. But once in a while, it might have character 1, character 4, character 2, character 3, etc. Then sometimes an ip wanted to rearrange it. Like to this on Heaven's Memo Pad.\n\nThen if I come across other pages/ articles where someone switched it. So, do I change it back how to it was before. Tainted-wingsz (talk)\n\nUgh, is this going to be another Dream Eater Merry situation? You might want to go with the manga order of first appearance, so everyone who is a main character in chapter 1 of the manga is listed first, and within chapter 1, you can order by anime or manga character list sequence on a website.

Enigma (manga) wasn't released in English but it was released in France and Spain.Blue Pumpkin Pie (talk)\n\nArticles written in languages other than English or Japanese can be used, provided they are reliable sources. They can especially be used to beef up the distribution and reception sections. What wouldn't be useful are tables for Spanish release dates for the manga, list of Spanish voice actors for the anime, or translations of the titles and character names. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nThanks for clarifying. I'm sure I can find a few sources in different languages.Blue Pumpkin Pie (talk)\n\nDoes anyone know any examples besides xxxHolic where we intervene to lowercase the letter to contra-act the autocapitalization?\n\nI would like to keep track of them somewhere. Perhaps a hidden category. ScratchMarshall (talk)\n\nHere they all are:\n\nS-CRY-ed\n\nXxxHolic\n\nGímik\n\nAngela (band)\n\nÉX-Driver\n\nÂge\n\nD/visual\n\nXxxHolic: A Midsummer Night's Dream\n\nIXIT Corporation\n\nBertemu\n\nMarhy\n\nEst em\n\nDaily-daily Dream\n\nGood! Afternoon\n\nGdgd Fairies\n\nSweet ARMS\n\nĒlDLIVE\n\nTemplate:Lowercase title has a SQL query that I ran on https://quarry.wmflabs.org/ to get a list of all pages using lowercase titles. I then manually copied that list into https://petscan.wmflabs.org/ to filter it by pages in this WikiProject. Opencooper (talk)\n\nDoes Enigma (manga) count as one beginning with lowercase?Blue Pumpkin Pie (talk)\n\nI would check MOS:TMCAPS and MOS:LCITEMS and those third-party sources as some of those titles don't need to be lower-case like Good! Afternoon, or Sweet Arms, or Angela (band). xxxHolic and the Eldive / Ex-Driver is more like eBay in its lower-casing. Enigma sounds more like Adidas as a stylization. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\n@Opencooper: so when you did that SQLquery it even returns xxxHolic itself even though it doesn't use template:lowercase title and instead uses the DISPLAYTITLE function directly, bypassing it? I can't say I understand how it works but I'm glad if it does give a complete list.\n\nIn this case, what do you guys think about a hidden category for these pages so we could easily keep track of them and any future ones? ScratchMarshall (talk)\n\n{{Lowercase title}} is just a wrapper around the DISPLAYTITLE magic word and the query just works on the latter. Opencooper (talk)\n\nThis is an all call for any willing editors who would like to help cleanup Major (manga). Main areas of focus are reducing the size of the plot section, filling in details about the various media releases, add details about the production and development of the manga, and determine whether the film and sequel Major 2nd should have their own articles. I've already split the large episode list section back into List of Major episodes because I viewed the original merge as ill informed and only exacerbated the problems with the main article. —Farix (t | c)\n\nI've been working on the article Digimon Fusion and I can't seem to find many reviews despite the fact that Western countries got DVDs of the series. If anybody knows of a site that has reviews, I would appreciate if you left in the talk page or just added them to the article. Cheers.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nAfter seeing AngusWOOF adding Category:Manga-themed anime and manga to a number of article, I took a look at the naming scheme for the rest of our categories by theme. The names of these subcategoreis are all over the place. Some are \"X in anime and manga\" (ex. \"Pirates in anime and manga‎\"). Other categories are named \"X-themed anime and manga\" (ex. \"Manga-themed anime and manga\"). And then there are some categories that are named as if they are genre categories, such as \"School anime and manga\", \"Ecchi anime and manga\", and \"Ninja anime and manga\".\n\nFirst, I see that Category:Anime and manga by topic may need to be divided into two separate groups: \"X in anime and manga\" and \"X-themed anime and manga\". Second all \"X anime and manga\" should be renamed to one of the two other naming schemes for clarity that they are themes and not genres. —Farix (t | c)\n\nI see. So you want to differentiate between genres and themes? I mean, for example the author of D.Gray-man said in one guidebook that the series' main theme is \"tragedy\" but Viz Media does not use those when describing the manga volumes.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nI think it is necessary to differentiate between themes and genres. For example, what is Category:Feminist anime and manga? Is it a theme category? A genre category? And what reliable sources backs up the inclusion of any of the articles in that category? Other examples are Category:Cooking anime and manga‎, Category:Japanese idol anime and manga‎, Category:School anime and manga‎ and Category:War anime and manga. —Farix (t | c)\n\n@TheFarix: Anything that is an official genre like Harem/Horror/Romance/Sci-fi can be \"X Anime and Manga\" but something more specific like Cooking, we rename it to \"X-theme anime and manga\". I have no idea what feminist anime and manga is. How do you determine that?Blue Pumpkin Pie (talk)\n\nI'll say that \"Manga-themed\" is there because \"Manga anime and manga\" would be confusing. But it could be renamed to \"Manga making in anime and manga\" or \"Manga artists in anime and manga\". AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nHow about \"Manga creation in anime and manga\"?Blue Pumpkin Pie (talk)\n\nHi everyone. I've recently had a bout of edit-warring with a fellow contributor on the navigation template Template:Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, who prefers to have it organized by main character instead of just by medium. I have presented my counterarguments to their new design on the talk page, but they haven't replied in three days, and their most recent revert reason, to me, sounds like they haven't even read my first point. This is the first time I have encountered this sort of behavior in years, so I am not sure how to handle such a situation. :-( So maybe we could have a third opinion or two from more experienced editors? Thanks!\n\nAlso, I haven't found is a guideline for how to organize navigation boxes for anime and manga franchises, except by extrapolating from a cursory look through the category, so I'd appreciated if anyone could link me to such a guideline. --Koveras ☭\n\nI've been working on making a list of Japanese chapter titles for the Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest manga, and I've gotten all of them except for the title of the extra chapter/epilogue-thingy in volume 3.

On May 12th, the RfC was closed with the result to keep portals, by a margin of about 2 to 1 in favor of keeping portals.\n\nThere's an article in the current edition of the Signpost interviewing project members about the RfC and the Portals WikiProject.\n\nSince the reboot, the Portals WikiProject has been busy building tools and components to upgrade portals.\n\nSo far, 84 editors have joined.\n\nIf you would like to keep abreast of what is happening with portals, see the newsletter archive.\n\nIf you have any questions about what is happening with portals or the Portals WikiProject, please post them on the WikiProject's talk page.\n\nThank you. — The Transhumanist\n\nI think it's high time to restore an encyclopedic version of the MyAnimeList article per the increase in traffic and the media coverage. I've started a draft at Draft:MyAnimeList. R9tgokunks ⯃\n\nCan anyone fluent in Japanese translate Japanese Wikipedia's ja:ポプテピピック article at a draft page? Let's see if I can turn it in the style of the English Wikipedia to expand Pop Team Epic article. JSH-alive/talk/cont/mail\n\nThere is an ongoing dispute at Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma over whether the article should include an anime television series by year category for each season or only for the year the series begins. My position is that only the category for the year the series began should be included and not for each season. Including a category for every season creates an WP:Overcategorization especially for articles such as Naruto (26 seasons), Bleach (16 seasons), and One Piece (19 seasons). —Farix (t | c)\n\nIn the page of Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma article, I've noticed that only the first season of the anime uses the category tag Category:2015 anime television series. Why the second and third season do not use the category tag Category:2016 anime television series and Category:2017 anime television series respectively? It is obvious that Food Wars is an seasonal animation (only serializing for a quarter of a year, half a year or a whole year) like Sword Art Online, High School DxD, A Certain Magical Index, etc. If you have a look at their pages, they all have their independent category tags for their repective seasons. For example, Sword Art Online have: Category:2012 anime television series, Category:2014 anime television series and Category:2018 anime television series. Accordingly, the Food Wars series should have multiple year tag.\n\n@TheFarix, you mentioned Bleach, Naruto, and One Piece. However, they are all longlasting. They just like Detective Conan--Serializing for decades consistently. Accordingly, they are not seasonal. I think that is probrably the reason why these animes only use the first year of the series to target.—Unnamelessness (talk)\n\n@TheFarix and Unnamelessness: What about only including the first year of release in the main article, then different year categories for each season article? Like SAO S1 could have the 2012 category, and SAO S2 could have the 2015 category. Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew\n\n@TheFarix and Narutolovehinata5: That is great. However, there is a question. In some anime pages, all season articles are in one page. For example, High School DxD only have one season page--List of High School DxD episodes. Does it mean we have to seperate them? That will be definitely a huge work.—Unnamelessness (talk)\n\nIt should only have series debuts and series endings. See Friends article where the main article only has 1994 American television series debuts and 2004 American television series endings as the categories. The list of episodes has none of the year specific categories. The individual season 1 has the specific 1994 American television seasons and 1995 American television seasons. I suggest adding redirects for Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma (season 1), Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma (season 2), Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma (season 3) and add the seasonal categories to those redirects. Then the episode listings can stay where they are, and year categories show up per season. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nIt seems more like the TV wikiproject made something simple into something more complicated. I don't think that's a good idea if they have their own names already.Blue Pumpkin Pie (talk)\n\nSince the article Tsubasa Oozora recently became GA, I wonder if its importance should be mid. I mean the reception section shows a lot of the character's impact in real association football players as well as its impact in Japan. Some months ago, I requested a check but it still wasn't checked. Feel free to be bold. Cheers.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nI am thinking of creating Derek Wildstar and others for Star Blazers as there sources in the Japanese version of Wikipedia. What do others think. Dwanyewest (talk)\n\nAre they primary sources, in-universe information, or actual third-party sources that discuss the characters from a real-world perspective? Because for articles on characters, a lot of the latter is needed. Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew\n\nNarutolovehinata5 most of the information I have found is on Derek Wildstar is from reprints of Starlog and the Japanese version of the character Susumu Kodai in Japanese. If anyone finds the article unsatisfactory feel free to redirect it to Star Blazers. Dwanyewest (talk)\n\n@Dwanyewest: I would take a look at WP:A&M/CHARACTER. - Knowledgekid87 (talk)\n\nIs there enough out of universe coverage beyond what has already been listed in List of Space Battleship Yamato characters? And would it include the Japanese character Susumu Kodai? AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nSee \"Category:Situation comedy anime and manga\". Seems like a rushed creation.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nI've reverted the inclusion of the two articles in that category along with all articles in Category:Black comedy anime and manga as unsourced. The creator has already received a lvl 4 warning over adding or changing genres to anime and manga articles without citing any sources. The fact that anyone would label Fullmetal Alchemist as a sitcom is extreamly dubious. —Farix (t | c)\n\nAgreed with reverting these. No news sources that indicate \"sitcom anime\" as a category. I'd also watch out for Comedy-drama anime and manga categories. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nThe great anime and manga by topic renaming has become. (Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2018 June 16#Topic based anime and manga categories) —Farix (t | c)\n\nAfter a decade of having no sources and struggling with getting this article to stay afloat, I can finally say the article has been approved from a draft. If anyone has any time extra sources in mind, please add them. R9tgokunks ⯃\n\nWhen I skim anime articles, I often run across the term “circle name” (as in “it was published under the circle name XXX”). I’m a complete stranger to manga and anime, and this term puzzles me. There are hints of an explanation at Dōjin, but I wonder if it would merit an article of its own. Just a thought. — Gorthian (talk)\n\nNah, it is already explained over at Dojin, but phrases like \"circle name\" are jargon and should be rewritten to something like manga group with a link to dojin. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nI find some little problem about Crunchyroll, Funimation and Anime Limited.\n\nIn the page of Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World, I find that Crunchyroll and Anime Limited were mentioned in \"Licensed by\" section, but not Funimation, so I tried to put Funimation in the section. It is because Crunchyroll have the anime's master license in both US and UK, and Crunchyroll arranged Funimation and Anime Limited to release the anime on home video; even Anime Limited admitted that they acquired the anime through Crunchyroll x Funimation partnership. [1] It would be irony if the \"Licensed by\" section only displays Anime Limited and not Funimation.\n\nI found some other animes' pages have similar problem. For example, in the page of The Testament of Sister New Devil, both Crunchyroll and Anime Limited are mentioned in \"Licensed by\" section, but not Funimation. In fact, Crunchyroll have the anime's master license in both US and UK, and Crunchyroll arranged Funimation and Anime Limited to release the anime on home video; even Anime Limited stated that they \"distributing for Crunchyroll in the United Kingdom\".[2] It would be irony if the \"Licensed by\" section only displays Anime Limited and not Funimation.\n\nSo we may need to set the rule about it to avoid future editing war. For the similar situations, should \"Licensed by\" section mentions both Anime Limited and Funimation, or not mentioned both companies at all? I think it would be good to show both Anime Limited and Funimation (to let people understand the distribution situation of the anime). -- Marychan41 (talk • contrib)\n\nPer previous discussions, if we know who holds the master liscense they should be listed as the liscensee. In situations where it's unclear who has the master liscense, as sources often don't explicitly state it, it's fine to list multiple liscensees. So if Anime Limited is just sub liscensing it from crunchyroll I probably wouldn't put them in the infobox, but mentioning them in prose is fine. CurlyWi (talk)\n\nI agree with CurlyWi: if reliable sources can confirm that Anime Limited is merely sublicensing the series, then they shouldn't be in the infobox any more than Funimation is. I also agree that it's perfectly fine to include them in the article text. Also, @Marychan41:, I didn't see this thread until after I had reverted your edit. If you wanted me to see it, you should have pinged me. G S Palmer (talk • contribs)\n\nReferences\n\nThank you. I also agree with it. -- Marychan41 (talk • contrib)\n\nSo I noticed that Alexandra IDV split Golden Kamuy into Golden Kamuy and Golden Kamuy (TV series). Wouldn't it be better to merge the two back together, since a) it's common practice to have anime adaptations covered in the same article as their manga, and b) both articles are rather short on their own? The list of episodes could be split off into its own article, but otherwise I don't see any reason to keep them separate, plus it just makes it harder for readers to find information on the series. Thoughts? G S Palmer (talk • contribs)\n\nI split them up because the anime portion was absolutely dominating the manga article, and because both the anime and the manga are independently notable. It is only common for anime adaptations to be covered in the manga article because people don't expand the anime portions enough for a separate article to be viable - there is nothing saying that them being covered in the same article is the way it has to be or should be.--Alexandra IDVtalk\n\nIt was only \"dominating\" the article because nobody had bothered to write anything about the manga, as far as I can tell. G S Palmer (talk • contribs)\n\nIf you exclude the episode list, there really isn't that much about the anime, at least nothing that would \"dominate\" the main article. —Farix (t | c)\n\nI agree that merging the articles is sensible and common practice, but keeping the Episodes on a separate page is fine. Ozflashman (talk)\n\nRename the TV series to List of Golden Kamuy episodes, and remove the cast listing which can be accommodated by the main page's characters list. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\n@AngusWOOF: the episode list can/should stay separate from main article, but I think the production section should get merged back in. G S Palmer (talk • contribs)\n\nYes, turn the anime page into an episode list and then merge the pertinent info (cast and production) back into the main article. — Kawnhr (talk)\n\nGantz has had a tag on its top because \"manga and anime plot differ\" since (October 2013). I used Google news as well as the custom Google search for this project, and can't find any reliable sources talking about the differences. Since it was a popular enough anime, surely there is coverage somewhere about how the last 5 episodes were different from the manga and why. Was it because the manga didn't keep up with the anime, so they had to make something up on their own, or was it because they creator wanted to do something different? Dream Focus\n\n@Dream Focus: I'm pretty sure the site \"Fandompost.com\" has information about it within its review of the anime. Besides I don't think we need citations for the plot.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nEarlier in the info box at Katana Maidens, I saw something there and its by Ubisoft, with Square Enix. Then I edited it out as only from refs/ sources says its by square enix not ubisoft. So when I did there was other categories added too and rid out some of them, like \"games set in UK\" and another about a spy, etc. But since I don't really play or use mobile games, are some of them WP:TRIVIALCAT? As after I did that, I don't know if someone else will re-added those categories back. Later on. Tainted-wingsz (talk)\n\nI've reverted the excessive amount of categories. However, I have noticed that there have been a lot of shenanigans going on with categories recently, namely in the form of adding Category:Disney franchises to several articles that don't even mention any Disney involvement. (example) Not sure if what is going on with Katana Maidens is anyway related. —Farix (t | c)\n\nOh. I hope this isn't back when, someone kept adding random \"see also\" links. And now expanded to adding categories instead. Tainted-wingsz (talk)\n\nGames set in the UK sounds like the game features the UK as its setting, like Films set in the UK. I don't think that's the same as games made by companies that have an office in the UK. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nWhat made me first wonder was, if the info box shows Ubisoft by there? Why, did they went into a mobile game and assisted in the Katana Maidens: mobile game, I don't know, but that feels its all fake and wasn't even mention at all if they produced it, as only square enix is the sole producer/ developer. Then at the same time there was that bunch of categories. It just seems off, as one use to have [[Category:Superhero video games]] and what does that have to do with the game or show? If the show mostly has sword fighting/ fencing. As to Princess Principal having something about child superheroes or it has some other categories for?\n\nThen the only thing that came to mind; where a company like ubisoft and square enix did. Was some cross game promo. In one of the Final Fantasy games, they showed some Assassin's Creed thing as a dlc for a few weeks. And vice versa with assassin's creed having something from final fantasy, a few months later on. Tainted-wingsz (talk)\n\nI founded one at a movie/ film by here. Saying it is based off of Just Dance.

Something that isn't as big as a franchise like One Piece or Naruto but easy to find info on.Blue Pumpkin Pie (talk)\n\n@Blue Pumpkin Pie: I've been thinking Princess Principal has some potential for a good expansion. There's a bunch of sources archived on the talk page (interviews, etc.) that could be used as the basis for a production section. And the reception section could be expanded as well.

Right now a lot of them are basically credits dumps; it would be nice to at least expand them to be actual biographies too.

Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew\n\nI can try voice actors too. i'm not familiar with which are the more famous ones. Do you have one in mind that needs work?Blue Pumpkin Pie (talk)\n\n@Blue Pumpkin Pie: A cursory search through Category:Japanese voice actors is a start. I'd advise you to start with the male ones since a lot of them are just lists of roles and are short on biographical content, while the ones on females are somewhat better. Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew\n\nEnglish dub voice actors could use some love too. Basic questions like where they grew up, how they got into the industry, and a walk through their most notable works is more interesting than a rehash of their filmography in prose.

Should these distributors be listed as \"Licensed by\" in the infobox, or should Funimation be listed only without Sony at all, or should both be listed?\n\nI'm bringing this up because articles seem to be inconsistent with one another. Currently on the articles that are distributed/licensed by this: My Hero Academia lists only the distributors; Attack on Titan (UK) lists only distributors (though I did try to change it to list Funimation but it was removed); Yuri on Ice and Black Clover are listed with both Funimation and Sony.\n\nFurther note on Attack on Titan: it seems that Funimation has rights to the series in USA, Canada, UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Should Funimation also be listed in Australia and New Zealand as well? source: \"As part of its agreement with Kodansha, Funimation has secured the international rights to home entertainment, video on demand and broadcast distribution of the series in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.\"\n\nFurther note on Black Clover: this source states that \"The license is part of Crunchyroll & Funimation’s partnership so this is looking to be the first Crunchyroll release under Sony’s belt.\", but Funimation and Sony are the ones handling the release. So should Black Clover be listed as Funimation, Crunchyroll, Sony Pictures UK, or all 3?\n\nFurther note with Yuri on Ice: this source also has the same situation with Black Clover above, so again, should all three be listed? - Alex Tenshi (talk)\n\nI think the general consensus was to only list the company with the \"master license\" in the infobox. So if Funimation licenses a show, but then lets Sony Pictures UK do a DVD release, or lets Netflix stream it, I would still only put Funimation in the infobox. Where it gets tricky is when we aren't actually sure who has the master license since the sources don't usually explicitly state it. So if Black Clover is part of the vague partnership but we don't know who has the master liscense, I would list both Crunchyroll and Funimation, but not sony pictures, cuz again they're just sub-licensing. Yuri on Ice is one of the shows where Crunchyroll explicitly confirmed they have the master license though, so there should be zero debate on that one, they should be the only one in the infobox.\n\nTLDR:\n\nAttack on Titan: Funimation only\n\nBlack Clover: Crunchyroll and Funimation\n\nYuri on Ice: Crunchyroll only\n\nCurlyWi (talk)\n\nI don't see any reason why Funimation would let Crunchyroll put their name/logo on a release which Funimation holds the master license to, so it's probably a safe bet to say if the home video release credits Crunchyroll, then they are the licensee. G S Palmer (talk • contribs)\n\nYeah, I believe someone brought that up in one of the past discussions (I don't remember who), that the physical releases are labeled differently depending on if Crunchyroll/Funimation have the master license. Assuming that's accurate, that would be one way to potentially solve the cases like Black Clover where we aren't sure who licensed it. CurlyWi (talk)\n\nI was the one who brought up the physical packaging, with Crunchyroll titles having the Crunchyroll logo alongside the Funimation logo. I also recently noticed that titles licensed by Funimation usually have a line in their copyright information saying \"Licensed by Funimation® Productions, Ltd. All Rights Reserved.\", so we could also use the copyright information to determine if it's a Funimation licensed title. - Alex Tenshi (talk)\n\nFor Black Clover the home releases, I added the table to that, but I can change it to NA; region 1. Or is this just for the info box? Tainted-wingsz (talk)\n\nIt was the infobox that was what I was mainly concerned about since that was inconsistent between articles. - Alex Tenshi (talk)\n\nSince this is becoming more and more complicated because reliable sources are increasingly not clearly specifying the license holder and it is not something that can be fully summarized in the infobox, perhaps it is time to remove all English-language related fields from the infobox. This also goes for English networks because there have been disputes over whether only the first run networks should be listed or all rebroadcasts should be listed. For Japanese networks, we limit it to just the first run networks. There has also been plenty of cases where the English licensee or publisher has changed or expired and editors have removed the previous licensee or publisher from the infobox. —Farix (t | c)\n\nIn theory it should be simple, we should only be listing the original company that \"produced\" the English version of the show (wrote subs/recorded dubs), and then companies that are simply redistributing that existing content either via streaming or dvd shouldn't be listed. But you do have a fair point, in practice it's not always easy to tell. Looking at a non Crunchyroll/Funimation example, Toradora! was picked up by NIS America, but then was also released by 2 other companies in the UK and AUS respectively. Should they be in the infobox? I can't tell from the sources if they are simply re-releasing the NIS version or if they actually created unique/original translations. CurlyWi (talk)\n\nMany sources use the words \"acquired\" or \"announced\" or \"will be streaming\", all of which are vague and should not be used to mean licensed, since these words do not always mean that a company has licensed the series. So it's very unclear whether they should be listed or not, since the sources have always been very unclear and ambiguous on the words they use when publishing articles about acquiring a title for release. For example, this article says \"Anime Limited announced the following further acquisitions\" and then lists Attack on Titan: Junior High, which on its product page says \"This is a Funimation title being distributed by Anime Limited in the UK.\". The same article then also lists Claymore, which is licensed by Anime Limited themselves (physical packaging says \"Licensed to Anime Ltd.\"), so a single news article is inconsistent and unclear on what the word \"acquisition\" means. - Alex Tenshi (talk)\n\nSince My Hero Academia is half way in the third season. I just made a few newer pages/ articles by season, but after I do that, could someone over look it. And see what I tried to do at List of My Hero Academia episodes?

I'm revisitingWikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Anime_and_manga/Archive_65#THEM_reliability and also posted on WP:RSN for discussion, but it seems to me that T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews seems to be run by hobbyists with no established credentials. Also, the key people who have appeared in press segments like Carlos Ross is no longer with the website or affiliated with them. Maybe at the time of review, it could be considered a reliable source for reviews, but not by today's standards, especially when more industry-related material is available. In other words, the key people of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews can be considered valid sources, but the website and its current contributors don't seem like they would be. Please advise. lullabying (talk)\n\nCorrection: Ross is still with the website and continues to serve a role with them (he did leave for several years but came back some time ago), and they do have a list of credits on their website. From what I can tell, they do appear to have some vetting for their current staff and they appear to meet vetting requirements, so there's that. Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew\n\nHello. There was a discussion between LTPofficial (talk · contribs) and Andrzejbanas (talk · contribs) regarding the film production companies in the infobox for certain anime films. The latter found some reliable sources on some of the Pokemon film pages and removed the animation company, which is OLM (the main animation studio for Pokémon), as they weren't mentioned in the sources that user put in. However, I'm growing concerned about this because it seems to disagree with this project’s current consensus, which is to list only the animation studios in the infobox. I think we may need to ask other project members on here and WP:FILM for input regarding this.\n\nEven if all of the production companies are sourced and listed in the infobox, should we still keep the consensus on listing only the animation studios? Thanks. Lord Sjones23 (talk - contributions)\n\nI'm leaning towards not listing the animation studios, because this counters what we have been doing for films. It won't be clear to a reader if we have a discrepancy here, especially as this has potential to be something obvious for us, the some-what experienced editors, but not so much for the readers. I understand the value of mentioning in animation studio for anime films, but if its not accurately following the suit of other films, it shouldn't be in the infobox like that. I'd say leave that information for the prose with sources. Andrzejbanas (talk)\n\nSome of the animation studios are actually members of a production committee in certain films. If we list every single production company involved, it might end up cluttering the infobox. Lord Sjones23 (talk - contributions)\n\nIts just a matter of finding reliable sources and applying it appropriately. Like with any infobox if the information is too difficult to appropriately display there, leave it for prose or weigh in how important it is to really get in there. If the animation studio is a production studio for the film, then by all means include it, but just be able to back it up. Andrzejbanas (talk)\n\nStill, closing credits to films also count as a reliable source. Like I’ve said, I’ve asked others around, even at WT:FILM, to see what can be done about this matter. Lord Sjones23 (talk - contributions)\n\nWhat about the opening credits? Many Anime films list the main members of the production committee, like with Spirited Away the companies featured are Tokuma Shoten, Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Disney (Buena Vista Home Entertainment in English translations), Tohokushinsha Film and Mitsubishi, while some films just list the companies as \"Film Name Film Partners\" or something like that.\n\nHere's a edit I just did on the Mary and the Witch's Flower page, as in the posters the other companies involved apart from Nippon TV (who's logo is featured) and Altitude Film Distribution (didn't add in as they own non-Japanese rights to the film) are just credited as \"Mary and the Witch's Flower Film Partners\". Luigitehplumber (talk)\n\nI wouldn't just use the companies logos that involved from a poster as they aren't high quality sources. For example, the current article on The Red Turtle lists countless production countries with no source. One site I like using for French films for example is Unifrance.org, which goes into details of what company's responsibility was what. But even this site doesn't make it clear as it states the production companies were just Wild Bunch and Why Not Productions. It lists Ghibli as being a foriegn company involved, but also only officially states it as a French and Belgian production. So just looking at company logos in the credits is not the simple solution I'm afraid. And believe me, I wish it was! Andrzejbanas (talk)\n\nI think in anime the animation studio needs to be mentioned in the infobox, as it's what most people care about. The production companies may be more important in non-anime films, but the animation studio will be what readers are looking for on these articles. And we need to provide the information that the reader needs/wants. G S Palmer (talk • contribs)\n\nI mostly agree with this notion - it’s really as simple as the fact that the animation company is pretty important when the subject is “animation”. I’d say both production and animation companies are worth mentioning, in the same way developers and publishers are both mentioned in video game articles. Just my two cents though, I don’t usually work much in TV/Film/Animation content areas very much, I can only speak from the video games and music article approach. Sergecross73 msg me\n\nI'm not saying its no important, but its not quite the same thing as a production company. Listing them side-by-side does not really tell the user who did what. I would leave them in the prose to suggest who did what reflecting a proper source and not original research. Like, as neither of us seem to have an insight into the industry on the how and why these are seperated, I don't think we should make assumptions other than its not as simple as we once looked at as before. Andrzejbanas (talk)\n\nI think setting a limit on the number that can be included in the infobox is a good idea. If there are more, only list the top 3-4 in the infobox (according to credit seniority) and then list all of them somewhere else in the article. Everything in the infobox should be in the article somewhere, anyway. ···日本穣 · 投稿 · Talk to Nihonjoe · Join WP Japan!\n\nI think it would be best to set some sort of limit, but it might be better to just leave it blank if it's too excessive for the infobox to handle. I'd rather not confuse a reader to thinking we only had four production companies when in reality there was 13 or something! Kind of miss the old days of films and anime productions where it wasn't handled by a dozen studios. :) Andrzejbanas (talk)\n\nAs someone who doesn't really deal with anime films, I haven't really seen a good argument as to why we shouldn't mention the animation studio in the infobox. Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew\n\nIt's because they aren't film production companies. It would be like including the special effects studio in regular film articles. Andrzejbanas (talk)\n\nThey do the animation though, right? Animation is different from what I recall. Leaving them out would be like not mentioning Pixar or Dreamworks in the infobox. Narutolovehinata5 tccsdnew\n\nThe purpose of the \"production company\" parameter is to list the company that principally produced the film, as identified by secondary reliable sources. let's take Princess Mononoke for example: the British Film Institute lists \"Studio Ghibli\" as the production company, so that is what goes in the field.In the case of Mary and the Witch's Flower the BFI lists the name of the partnership (Mary and the Witch's Flower Film Partners) and then lists the partners; in a case like this where you have a shell company representing a group of companies it would make more sense to list the actual film partners rather than the shell name. There are two points I want to finish off with though: 1) Editors picking out companies from the film credits is original research because we don't know their precise role, so we should use secondary sources to identify the production companies. 2) The production company field in the infobox is for the production companies, not whichever company you think is worthy of going in the infobox. If you think this is a flaw in the infobox then raise the issue at the template talk page but don't label animation studios as the \"production company\" if it is not actually the production company.

Discussion seemed to favour such a merger but I don't know if it's at the level of consensus. Is there any further discussion— or should there just be action? — Kawnhr (talk)\n\nI'm for a merger. The production section in Golden Kamuy (TV series) can easily be incorporated into the main article's anime section, and then you can reform Golden Kamuy (TV series) into List of Golden Kamuy episodes. And then just incorporate the cast into the character list with {{voiced by}}.--十八\n\nI agree to the merger proposition, this is normal practice.

I think it's time to get another revisit.\n\nPikachu Project is a production committee consisting of eight to nine companies that produced the Pokémon films since 1998 (which currently includes The Pokémon Company, Shogakukan, TV Tokyo, Tomy/Takara Tomy, East Japan Marketing & Communications, Inc., OLM, Inc., Toho and Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions; Media Factory, Creatures and Game Freak were once members of the committee). According to the opening and ending credits of all of these films, OLM and their teams (Team Koitabashi, Team Kamei, and now Team Kato) has an Animation Production (アニメーション制作) credit and Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions has a Production (制作) credit. However, Pikachu Project itself has another Production (製作) credit.\n\nWhat is the appropriate way to list these? Lord Sjones23 (talk - contributions)\n\nI still believe it should go by sources. My source is a published source which lists the proper production company. Animation studios should be discussed, but they are not actual and technical production companies (i.e: where the funding is). Which is what should be placed.

G S Palmer (talk • contribs)\n\nBut that goes against infobox standards for films, which states to only list production companies. When those are sourced in major sources (books, Variety, Hollywood Reporter, and Screen Daily) these are not considered production companies. Its a more complicated matter that doesn't require opinions, but basic facts and industry standards. Not our own personal whims. Andrzejbanas (talk)\n\nNo, Wikipedia's purpose is to provide useful, relevant information. The companies that funded an anime's production are nowhere near as notable as the companies that animated it, which can be seen by any simple perusal of news articles/reviews/etc. G S Palmer (talk • contribs)\n\nOnly list the animation studio that produced the anime. Not companies that financed the film/series. Not the companies that were involved with in-between animation. Not the company that distributes the film/series. —Farix (t | c)\n\nOnly list the main animation studio. For anime, usually only the animation studio is prominently listed in reliable sources, and not who actually paid for the work. Also, anime will often list the copyright as belonging to a production committee, which is usually formed just for that work and named in some way after that work. Because the production committee is just something created for one work, listing it is rather pointless. Calathan (talk)\n\nOnly the main animation studio.

Betty Logan (talk)\n\nUse sources I am just going to re-post my response from the earlier discussion since I still hold the same view:\n\nThe purpose of the \"production company\" parameter is to list the company that principally produced the film, as identified by secondary reliable sources. let's take Princess Mononoke for example: the British Film Institute lists \"Studio Ghibli\" as the production company, so that is what goes in the field.In the case of Mary and the Witch's Flower the BFI lists the name of the partnership (Mary and the Witch's Flower Film Partners) and then lists the partners; in a case like this where you have a shell company representing a group of companies it would make more sense to list the actual film partners rather than the shell name.

If you think this is a flaw in the infobox then raise the issue at the template talk page but don't label animation studios as the \"production company\" if it is not actually the production company.\n\nThis approach is advocated by the guidelines at {{Infobox_film}} which instructs \"this should be cited to reliable secondary sources that explicitly identify the production companies.\" If the credits explicitly identify a company as the \"production company\" this should be sufficient, but if production companies are not explicitly identified then editors should not be interpreting the credits themselves, and should use a secondary source that explicitly identifies a company as the \"production company\". A respected catalog such as the British Film Institute is a good place to start in these types of disputes. Betty Logan (talk)\n\nList \"the company or companies that produced the film\" as the documentation at {{Infobox film}} says. As Betty Logan above says, infobox parameters are for what the documentation prescribes, not what you want to put on a pedestal. If an infobox only has a parameter for apples but you want to put oranges there, you either don't or you seek to reform the infobox.

It is defiantly salvageable I think. The issue I think is where the game came first and the anime is the spin-off of the game which is why the article is \"a video game with an anime\". The anime is notable but the game is not from what I can tell. ♪♫Alucard 16♫♪\n\nIndeed, I can see how it's an issue. But the anime is clearly the primary topic. If the game was notable, it would be fine to have two articles, one for the anime, and one for the video game, but it's not a notable video game. Lee Vilenski (talk • contribs)\n\nIt's a media franchise of which the game and anime are merely a part. Though the game came first so it gets top billing, it has nothing to do with primary topic as it's all the same topic. What could possibly need rewriting when the article is a stub that consists of five sentences? —Xezbeth (talk)\n\nThere is currently a discussion at Talk:List of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations episodes#Splitting up Seasons in regards to the fact if the episodes should be divided based on their DVDs. Please join because I'm not exactly sure what method we should follow. Cheers.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nI am looking for a convention/guideline for the translation of Japanese long vowels \"ō\" vs \"ou\" (and other use of macrons) in articles in Wikipedia. They appear to be used interchangeably, even within articles. The closest to a convention/guideline I can see is that \"ō\" is used in direct translations from Japanese, but \"ou\" is used in the text for Plot, Characters and Episode Summaries. See example at List of Basilisk characters. There is Help:Japanese#Vowels, but this is not a guideline.\n\nCan anyone clarify this issue, or point to where a decision has been made, so that it can be consistently applied in anime and manga articles? Thanks. Ozflashman (talk)\n\nThe default guideline is WP:MOS-JP#General guidelines point 1. However, this can be superseded if there is an official English romanization of a name/term that uses \"ou\" instead of \"ō\", which is almost always in licensed series. That's why the Basilisk characters use \"ou\" (except in the third field of {{Nihongo}} of course).--十八\n\nThanks. Ozflashman (talk)\n\nReferring to this image: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Anime_eye.svg\n\nThe same eye vector has been in place for 12 years now, however I feel it does not adequately represent the media, being the work of - at the time - a complete amateur. The drawing is a typical representation of a complete misunderstanding of manga as an artform. That being the case, I'd like to discuss the possibility a replacement image; I personally recommend using an image from the 1968 Astroboy comic, due to it's historical significance and unquestionably Japanese style.\n\nInLucidReverie 19:36, 13 October 2018\n\nAnything like that that has a copyright isn't in the public domain and therefore we couldn't use it. Also, I don't have a problem with the current (free use) image.--十八\n\n(edit conflict) Well for starters, you cannot use an image from a copyrighted work and the Astroboy manga would definitely fall under copyright. Second, how is the current eye not representative? Eye styles will differ from artist to artist, studio to studio, and character designer to character designer, and are constantly evolve over time. So there is no definitive style for eyes other than their general size and shape compared to the rest of the face. And even that isn't always the same either (ex. Mirio Togata eyes from My Hero Academia). There are a few other styles of eyes, but I wouldn't say that any of them are any better that the current image. Of course, the image doesn't have to be an eye either, but it should be something that is simple and easily identifies the topic area. —Farix (t | c)\n\nI just did a spot check of three recently added episode summaries[7] and confirm ed that they are word-for-word same as summaries on multiple other websites, a direct violation Wikipedia's copyright policy. Looking at the edit history of the list, this same IP range has added several other summaries that are very likely to be copyright violations as well. I have started a discussion at Talk:List of One Piece episodes (season 19)#Copyright violations about how to remedy the situation. —Farix (t | c)\n\nDiscussion is here: Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard#Ex.org and Furinkan.com. - Knowledgekid87 (talk)\n\nIf there are no objections raised, I want to remove the two sources from WP:A&M/RS per WP:SILENCE and WP:N/WP:V issues. - Knowledgekid87 (talk)\n\nCan a clarification be made on whom on this site is considered to be reliable, or is this a case of fans writing material? If there is an editor who is a contributor to the site from Neo (as [8] suggests) than who would it be? Should we treat this source as \"situational\"? What bothers me most is the \"write for us\" page (here) which says: \"The UK Anime Network is not run for profit, nor is it a professional publication. It's a website run by fans with contributions by other passionate fans of the genre.\" Right now this source is listed as a WP:RS under WP:A&M/RS, this status really needs a second look. - Knowledgekid87 (talk)\n\nNow that an English dub has been announced, I propose we expand the Real Girl article up to a C or B-class article. This article currently lacks a reception section and production section and I'm thinking that we need to write some summaries for the episodes and volumes. I'm also thinking about proposing to spin-off a list of episodes; I'm working on this in my sandbox. Thoughts? Lord Sjones23 (talk - contributions)\n\nGotta research creation and reception information. It is the hardest part but the most important one. Maybe the books contain information from the artist.Tintor2 (talk)\n\nAnd also her Twitter feed and official blog would count as sources. Lord Sjones23 (talk - contributions)\n\nRecently, Amazon and Netflix have been acquiring titles for exclusive streaming worldwide on their platforms, but they are also listed as licensees in infoboxes of anime series. I thought that only licensees should be listed and not streaming companies, unless the streaming company"
