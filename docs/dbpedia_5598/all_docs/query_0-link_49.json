        "text": "She went inside and breathe in the aroma of the newly baked pastries that lingers around the cafe.\n\n\"Ohayo\" Her soft voice filled the cafe as her co-workers greeted back.\n\n•••••\n\nIn Midorima High, a few guys with one holding a love letter, can be seen outside a certain classroom.\n\nThey seem to be watching a girl with light brown hair having lunch with two other girls.\n\nThe guy with the love letter approached her and called out her name.\n\nYet when she looked back at him, the guy let out a shriek and seems terrified for some reason and backed away.\n\nThe said girl's name is Kirari Tsukishima, 14 years old and has a very huge appetite for her age. She seems more of a glutton and yet, she has a natural charm that most adores, as they say, Kirari is pretty.\n\n\"Kirari, if you are an idol, it's really strange to act like that.\" One of the girl with greyish black short hair voiced out as she saw how terrified the boy was when he saw Kirari's glutton face. It seems that the guy's image of Kirari changed.\n\n\"Eh? Idol?\" Kirari and her pet, nā-san was confused about what her friend said.\n\nThe eyes of another girl with red-ish brown hair that they're having lunch with seems to twinkle as she spoke about being an idol.\n\n\"Doesn't it sound good to be an idol? You will be surrounded by people everyday.\"\n\n\"Yeah, its just like SHIPS in the television show.\"\n\nMiku, the greyish black short haired girl and Sayaka, the latter one, were diehard fans of SHIPS so they were absolutely shocked about what Kirari said next.\n\n\"SHIPS? Sounds delicious.\" she was drooling while her eyes twinkled.\n\n\"What?! You don't know about SHIPS?\"\n\n\"That's unbelievable!\"\n\nSayaka and Miku looked at Kirari with such unbelieving eyes.\n\n\"Ehh\" Kirari just looked at them with wonder.\n\n\"They're two junior high students, just like us.\"\n\n\"They have become a great idol group.\"\n\n\"In any case they are so cool~~~.\"\n\n\"Isn't that right?\" The tag team commentator fans sweat dropped at the sight of Kirari shoving takoyakis in her mouth.\n\n\"Sorry! I never watched them\" Kirari apologized after swallowing all the takoyaki.\n\n\"Anyways, what are you interested in?\" Sayaka asked.\n\n\"Hmm, I just want to fall in love normally, meet a kind and nice man and then fall in love in him.\" Kirari answered with a light blush on her face and it looked like she was imagining something.\n\n•••••\n\nMeanwhile, back at the cafe, Yumi's shift was done. As she was about to go, their manager, Rika-san stopped her.\n\n\"Do you need something else Rika-san?\" Yumi asked with a thoughtful look on her face.\n\nRika smiled at this and took something from her bag.\n\n\"I just wanted to give you this. I didn't manage to give you anything on your last birthday so consider this as a late birthday gift from me.\" She handed Yumi an envelope and gave her a tight hug.\n\nRika just adore Yumi so much. She treats the girl like a little sister she never had. She loves how kind hearted and yet fragile-looking the girl was. Though, she worries a lot as a few guys seems to have an interest on Yumi that's why she allowed her to bring Snow everyday.\n\nWhen the hugging fest were done, Yumi opened the envelope and she was overjoyed to see that it was a concert ticket! SHIPS concert ticket!\n\n\"Yumi thanks you so much Rika-san!\" Yumi gave Rika-san another big hug and kissed her cheek before bowing and going out.\n\nRika chuckled at the excited girl she saw. She observed that whatever Yumi do, she looks graceful. Honestly, she would've thought that Yumi was an angel that was sent to them.\n\nEver since Yumi came at the cafe, wonderful blessings rained on each and everyone that was working and came by.\n\n\"I should be the one thanking you Yumi.\"\n\n~~~~~\n\n\"Ooooh, Yumi and Snow are going at the SHIPS concert.\"\n\nAlong side Aoi Kirisawa, she's also a fan of SHIPS.\n\nSHIPS is a two-man idol group.\n\nThe members are Hiroto Kazama and Seiji Hiwatari. Both are 15 years old and it says that they also aced at their school.\n\nYumi admires the friendship between the two and their individual skills.\n\n\"But first, Yumi needs to head home to ask permission for Snow and Yumi to go.\" She smiled at Snow, feeling excited for the concert.\n\n[To be continued]\n\nPSKY:\n\nI only made up the name of Kirari's school.\n\nThe photos that I used aren't mine."
