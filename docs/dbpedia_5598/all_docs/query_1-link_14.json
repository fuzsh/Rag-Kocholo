        "text": "April 27, 2009 animehalf\n\nYeah well almost none of you little chipmunks out there really know what anime Kirarin Revolution is. Why?\n\nItâ€™s simple: This anime isnâ€™t easy to find subbed. But in case you want to know, this is what it looks like:\n\nSomething like that. I know, creepy. Not really. Because itâ€™s about a cute but gluttonous 14 year old idol named Kirari Tsukishima. There are three seasons, or â€˜Stagesâ€™ as the anime calls them.\n\nThis anime was at first brilliant! I was always like OMFG while watching it because it got me really hookedâ€¦ until the third stage. ðŸ˜¡\n\nThe first two stages are in wonderful, perfectly cute animation. They arenâ€™t as bad as youâ€™d think, though the eyes are scarily huge. But the Stage 3 animation is HORRIBLE!!! Itâ€™s in 3D!! In freaking 3D!!!!\n\nNow, I donâ€™t know about you, but that was the major drawback of Kirarin Revolution. The perfectly cute drawings ruined by big ugly 3D images. Well, now hereâ€™s the point where youâ€™re going to say that Iâ€™m not being fair. Donâ€™t give me that crap. Iâ€™m perfectly fair: Thereâ€™s waaay more drawbacks to Stage 3 than that! They COMPLETELY change the scenery, and COMPLETELY change Hiroto and Seijiâ€™s voices! Itâ€™s HORRIFYING, Iâ€™m telling you. HORRIFYING!! *smacks head down on table*\n\nLOOK AT THIS INSANELY CUTE ANIMATION!!!\n\nâ€¦.Now look at this insanely UGLY animation. Ugh! I canâ€™t even look at it anymore! Itâ€™s soâ€¦ fake! Ugh!\n\n*End of post\n\nEntry Filed under: Uncategorized"
