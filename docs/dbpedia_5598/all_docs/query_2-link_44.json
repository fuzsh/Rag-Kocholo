        "text": "Revolves around Futaba, a girl who was in love with a boy named Ko Tanaka in middle school. However, it did not work because he transferred but in high school, her world is turned around once again when she meets him again.\n\nMisora has the power to reset time backwards by up to three days, and Kei has as photographic memory that allows him to remember everything, despite the reset. Together, they try to correct the mistakes of the past.\n\nMomokuri starts of with a girl who sends a letter co fearing her love to Momo-kun. Momo says yes seeing that see is a beautiful girl. But what he doesn't realize is that he is dating a stalking/pervert.\n\nside from her deep passion for eating cakes, the clumsy Ichigo Amano has never been successful at anything. After an encounter with Henri Lucas, a famous patissier, Ichigo's amazing tasting abilities-although unbeknownst to her-are discovered. Recognizing her talent, Henri offers her the chance to attend St. Marie Academy, a prestigious culinary school which specializes in desserts. In spite of the fact that she is a beginner lacking skills, thanks to Henri's recommendation, Ichigo is placed in the topmost group with the \"Sweets Princes.\" The princes, famous throughout the school for their magical treats, are Sennosuke Andou, an expert in traditional Japanese sweets; Satsuki Hanabusa, with a flair for candied flowers; and Makoto Kashino, a gifted chocolatier. Ichigo and the Sweets Princes, each accompanied by their \"Sweets Spirits\"-fairies who make patissiers' dreams come true-all work towards their goals in the competitive world of sweets.\n\nTwelve-year-old Mitsuki loves to sing and she dreams of becoming a famous singer to fulfill a promise she made to Eichi, a close friend who moved away to American two years previously. Unfortunatly, she suffers from a tumor in her throat which makes singing difficult for her. One day Takuto and Meroko, two shinigami (gods of death), suddenly appear and inform her that she will die in one year. With this in mind, Mitsuki becomes more determined than ever to realize her dreams of becoming a famous singer and to reunite with Eichi. Asking for help, Takuto transforms her into a 16 year old to aid Mitsuki in following her dreams in the one year she has left to live.\n\nThe story of super hyper child star Sana Kurata. Her mother is an award winning writer who has strange hairstyles and hats in which lives the family pet, Maro-chan the squirrel. Her manager is, as she describes him, Sana's boyfriend and pimp (though Sana doesn't know what a pimp is). At school, her class is in chaos as the boys, under the leadership of the unemotional Akito Hayama, terrorize the teacher who is unable to do anything against them as Hayama is blackmailing her. As the series goes on, Sana and Akito resolve some of their differences and we follow the unlikely pair as they deal with their own pasts along with such issues as divorce, love triangles, child abandonment, and many others. However, this series hardly goes a minute without breaking into truly hilarious verbal and slapstick comedy.\n\nSawako's one wish in life is to make friends. That's a difficult proposition due to her resemblance to Sadako from The Ring. Her life starts to change after she befriends her classmate, Kazehaya, an easygoing guy who is nice even with her."
