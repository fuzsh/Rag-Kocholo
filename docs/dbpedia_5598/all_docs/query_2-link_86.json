        "text": "THE iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls Starlight Stage (アイドルマスター シンデレラガールズ スターライトステージ, Aidorumasutaa Shinderera Gaaruzu Sutaaraito Suteeji) or \"Deresute\" (デレステ) for short, is a spin-off free-to-play rhythm game based on THE iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls.\n\nIt was first released for Android devices on September 3rd, 2015, and then for iOS devices seven days later. A PC version of the game (via DMM Games client) was released on September 3rd, 2021, six years after the game's Android release.\n\nGameplay\n\nTHE iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls Starlight Stage is a game in a similar genre as THE iDOLM@STER SHINY FESTA (and to an extent, Love Live! School Idol Festival) gameplay-wise, a game which its gameplay mechanics are based on. It is a rhythm game that revolves around tapping notes, known as Rhythm Icons, in the rhythm of the background song.\n\nRhythm Game Elements\n\nAt the start of a song, the game starts with the unit life at 100%, score at 0, and combo at 0. During gameplay, there will be different kinds of notes appearing from the top of the screen to show how each of them must be tapped. The methods of tapping them include simply tapping the notes, holding down the notes, tapping two notes simultaneously, flicking notes in a certain direction (PRO, MASTER, MASTER+, WITCH, GRAND, and SMART only), and sliding notes to a certain direction (MASTER+, WITCH, GRAND, and SMART only). In the DMM Games PC version, some modes can be played with a mouse, keyboard, or gamepad, and some types of notes in WIDE LIVE mode will be replaced to compensate the lack of a touch screen.\n\nThe player will get a note judgment based on the accuracy of taps and flicks; these are PERFECT, GREAT, NICE, BAD, and MISS (from best to worst). Getting a PERFECT or a GREAT will increase the current combo by 1, while NICE, BAD, and MISS will reset the current combo to 0 (BAD and MISS will also decrease life). If the life bar reaches 0%, the song ends in a failure. If the player plays through the end of a song, and when the life bar is not completely depleted, the song is cleared.\n\nCards have a skill and center effect that can do things like increase appeals, prevent life from decreasing, boost currently active skills, etc. with their own conditions.\n\nAfter clearing a song, a results screen appears, showing the player's statistics such as their maximum combo, number of tap ratings, and score. The player will also get rewards based on their score and song level.\n\nThis rhythm game element would eventually carry over to fellow brands’ rhythm game spinoffs: Million Live! Theater Days, SideM GROWING STARS, and Shiny Colors Song for Prism.\n\nAuto Live is available with an Auto Live ticket that is replenished daily (10 tickets per day, 5 additional tickets purchasable with coins, maximum 15 or 20 if paid Cinderella Pass is used), with caveats: players will be given lesser rewards, and Clears/Combos/Scores/PRPs won't count if Auto Live is used. Rewards will be multiplied if multiple auto tickets are used. Auto Live play on MASTER+ (if Extra Live ticket mode is toggled) or WITCH charts consumes Extra Live ticket instead.\n\nGame Types\n\nThere are three rhythm game types (WIDE, GRAND, and SMART), with five different rhythm game modes in this game:\n\nWIDE LIVE: A normal rhythm game type, with five-note lanes. In the PC version, this mode is playable with keyboard or gamepad inputs.\n\nBASIC: A regular WIDE mode consisting of four difficulties: DEBUT, REGULAR, PRO, and MASTER. Requires Stamina to play.\n\nMASTER+: A separate WIDE mode with the hardest difficulty of this type. Requires either an Extra Live Ticket or Stamina to play. MASTER+ clears do not count towards events if an Extra Live Ticket is used instead of Stamina. Before the July 30th 2022 update of the game, MASTER+ charts were divided into three separate albums (namely A, B, and C) that rotated every two weeks. Charts are added to the folder monthly.\n\nWITCH: A WIDE mode that features exclusive gimmicks such as disappearing notes, fake notes, BPM changes, variable size notes, damage notes, and various distracting effects. Tapping damage notes will result in an ACCIDENT judgment; like BAD or MISS, it also decreases life. New WITCH charts for existing songs are added sporadically, usually one chart per month. Requires an Extra Live Ticket to play, and a WITCH run won't count towards events. Due to the nature of damage notes, this is the only WIDE mode that is not playable in the PC version and can only be played in Auto Live.\n\nGRAND LIVE: A rhythm game type that plays almost the same as WIDE LIVE with MASTER+ mechanics except that now it has 15 small total lanes divided by three sub-lanes. Note sizes may vary and the way they scroll is the same as WIDE LIVEs. This mode's gameplay mechanics are similar to BanG Dream! Girls Band Party!, Project SEKAI COLORFUL STAGE! feat. Hatsune Miku, and Shiny Colors Song for Prism. Requires Stamina to play. While not playable in the PC version, playing in Auto Live is possible and MV Mode for Grand Live is available. Songs available in this mode are either group songs performed by at least six to fifteen members, or quintet unit songs with additional idols as back dancers.\n\nSMART LIVE: A simpler rhythm game type/mode, plays in portrait position and is intended to be played with one finger in the mobile versions, or a mouse in the PC version. Its rhythm elements are also similar to MASTER+/GRAND LIVE, except that only one note appears. Requires Stamina to play.\n\nSongs\n\nSongs in the game are grouped into fourteen types:\n\nGeneral Group Songs: Group songs from existing albums such as CINDERELLA MASTER General Election songs.\n\nCINDERELLA MASTER jewelries! Songs: Group songs from the jewelries! line of albums.\n\nMASTER SEASONS! Songs: Consisting of triplet-unit songs from said series, all revolving around seasonal themes.\n\nCINDERELLA MASTER 3chord Songs: Consisting of songs from the 3chord series with three different genres based on Special 3chord♪ concerts.\n\nEvent Original Group Songs: Original songs made exclusively for the in-game events. Almost all of these would appear later in a STARLIGHT MASTER album, with exceptions being Special 3chord♪’s theme songs and two manga songs (from WILD WIND GIRL and U149 respectively).\n\nStory/Extra Commu Solo Songs: Each solo song comes with a story commu centering around its performer. Solos are mostly from CINDERELLA MASTER solo CDs with some exceptions such as anime solos and manga solos. Solos coming from Cinderella Girls Theater EXTRA STAGE have shorter promotional commus.\n\nSTARLIGHT MASTER Solo Songs: Accompanying second solos from each STARLIGHT MASTER album, purchaseable at Sound Booth for 5000 money. No commus are added for these songs.\n\nANIMATION PROJECT Songs: Songs from the 2015 anime.\n\n346Pro IDOL selection series Songs: Songs from the 2015 anime’s Blu-ray releases.\n\nLITTLE STARS! Songs: Songs from Theater anime series.\n\nU149 ANIMATION MASTER Songs: Songs from the U149 anime adaptation.\n\nRearrange and Remix Songs: Remixes of existing songs. Also contains medleys.\n\nCover and Collaboration Songs: Popular songs covered by Cinderella Girls idols.\n\nGame Center Exclusive Song: A playable April Fools’ song.\n\nOverview\n\nIn the old song selection UI, the song list is divided into four tabs: regular tab, limited tab, event tab, and MASTER+ tab. The regular tab consists of songs that are playable every day, while the limited tab consists of jewelries! songs and an early-rewarded event song. Meanwhile, the event tab only contains one song and that is an in-progress token event song. Finally, the MASTER + tab is a separate tab for songs that have MASTER+ difficulty.\n\nAfter the new song selection UI update on 3/19/18, all songs from the limited and event tab are unified with the regular song list, while MASTER+ tab is still a separate mode that can be switched during LIVE mode song selection.\n\nBefore the update on September 3, 2019, the jewelries! series five-unit group songs, 15-unit group songs (Susume☆Otome ～jewel parade～, Gokigen Party Night, and Near to You) and its respective attribute-only five-unit versions were playable only on a certain day: Cute jewelries! songs on Wednesdays, Cool jewelries! songs on Thursdays, Passion jewelries! songs on Fridays, and all jewelries! songs (except for single-attribute-only, five-unit versions of 15-unit group songs) on Saturdays to Tuesdays.\n\nThese songs could only be found in the limited tab of the LIVE mode song selection (only affected when the old song selection UI was applied; the new song selection UI ditches the limited tab in favor of bringing jewelries! songs on the default song list, but the limited day restrictions were also brought up). Every group song in the jewelries series is now available every day since September 3, 2019.\n\nLive Groove and Live Parade event songs are available earlier in the limited tab the day after the event ends by reaching 5000 points in one of the two events mentioned, and then a month later they would be available for everyone else. Token event songs, while don't have advance play reward after the event ends, are also available a month after the event ends.\n\nStarting from Trust me (Token), Palette (Live Groove) and Giyuu Ninkyou Hanafubuki (Live Parade), event songs are now available for everyone the day after the event ends, regardless of reaching 5000 points (in the case of Groove or Parade) or not.\n\nCertain songs such as STARLIGHT MASTER Solos, the majority of ANIMATION PROJECT songs, rearranges and remixes, and most cover songs are available for purchase at the Sound Booth room item, which can be accessed in the room mode. Each song in the Sound Booth costs 5000 Money.\n\nThree songs, all from the anime series, were exclusively available through download codes, such as Shine!!, which was available through the purchase of THE IDOLM@STER CINDERELLA GIRLS ANIMATION PROJECT 2nd Season 01 Shine!!. However, these songs were later made available to all players and since then this practice has been discontinued.\n\nSongs that require chain unlocking with reading Story Commus and playing task song are now lifted as of the 27th April 2022 update; by just reading a respective story commu for a song, the song can be unlocked immediately, dropping the prerequisites of playing previous story commu song and PLv restrictions (especially those at level 50 and higher).\n\nSome songs such as Gokigen Party Night, Take me☆Take you, and Yes! Party Time!! can be toggled to their event or alternate versions before the LIVE starts.\n\nEach song has its own MV Mode, unlockable by clearing it on any difficulty at least once.

Events usually last from six up to ten days.\n\nA total of eight event types are currently available: LIVE Groove, LIVE Parade, LIVE Carnival, Cinderella Caravan, Susume! Cinderella Road, Token (or Atapon), LIVE Infinity, and Idol Produce.\n\nFor Live Groove and Token events, there are usually a points-based award and a ranking award card, the latter of which is awarded to players who do well in game-wide rankings (usually the top ranking 100,000 players). As of May 2020, tiers have now been extended to 200,000, which allows more people to receive the ranking SR, and as a result, both of the reward idols have become ranking award cards, meaning that players that rank higher will receive both cards. Besides that, their total stats are a bit equally high with each other. Currently, players can now get the first copies of ranking SR cards at 10,000 points for the first featured idol and 15,000 for the second one.\n\nClick here for more information on these events, as well as the list of event songs.\n\nElections\n\nEvery year, a voting event is held for the Cinderella Girls series. Click one of the two links below for more information:\n\nTHE iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls General Election\n\nStage for Cinderella\n\nLIVE PARTY!! Mode\n\nThis mode allows you to play with four other players. Up to five players play a song together and gain an amount of Star Emblems depending on how well they do individually (affected by rarity, stats, card skill level, potentials, and type attribute), which can be exchanged for previous event idols, room items, consumables, star jewels, memory keys, etc. These rewards reset monthly.\n\nThe total score does not only include the song score but also takes the idol's skill, combo length, and other factors into consideration. Players can set 4 different units pertaining to each song attribute (Cute, Cool, Passion, and All Types).\n\nIn each unit, there are five different roles that give different stat bonuses:\n\nPerformer (Visual)\n\nVocalist (Vocal)\n\nCenter (All)\n\nDancer (Dance)\n\nLeader (Life)\n\nWhen put into a match, the game will randomly pick what role you will represent and the idol you picked to represent that role will be used. Here, players can also set and show stickers that greet, communicate with, and say goodbye to players before and after the match. During events, players can either gain Live Groove/Token event points, Caravan medals, attendance boosting items, or Susume Tickets from clearing lives. Players who don't have unlockable songs (such as Story Commu Solos) can also get to play these songs randomly.\n\nLive Party mode used to be called \"Co-Op Live\" while in beta testing. This mode was also originally a bi-monthly event until the 2017-08-12 Live Party event before its event schedule slot was replaced by Susume! Cinderella Road.\n\nGacha\n\nThe gacha is used to scout for new idols and to obtain cards using star jewels and friendship points as currency. All rarities of cards unlock memorial stories and idol episodes once a card is changed into its \"+\" (awakened) form. SSR cards unlock special outfits that can be viewed through the 3D mode in lives.\n\nPlatinum Gacha\n\nThe Platinum Gacha allows players to pull for Rare, Super Rare, and Super Super Rare cards using Star Jewels as currency. It costs 250 star jewels for 1 roll and 2,500 star jewels for 10 rolls. Players can also roll once per day with 60 paid jewels. In a 10-roll gacha, the tenth card in the roll is a guaranteed SR card. All cards featured and in the gacha are permanent. A new Platinum Gacha appears three times a month usually featuring at least one new permanent SSR card and an SR card with the featured cards having a higher appearance rate than other cards in the gacha. All permanent Platinum Gacha cards are also available to roll for in Limited, Cinderella Festival, and Type Select Gacha, with an exception for Memorial Gacha.\n\nLimited Gacha\n\nLimited Gacha is a type of Platinum Gacha that happens at the beginning of each month usually revolving around a special theme. The featured cards are two limited SSRs, one permanent SR, and one limited SR. Starting from \"SUN 3 Summer Gacha\" limited gacha (July 31st, 2019) onwards, the featured limited SSRs have been increased to three, but at the same time has stopped featuring new permanent SR in a limited pool. Limited cards are not available in any other Platinum, Cinderella Festival, or Limited Gacha but their own. Some of the earlier Limited Gacha reappeared at the end of every month there isn't a Cinderella Festival Gacha.\n\nCinderella Festival Noir Gacha\n\nStarting on January 15th, 2021, this special type of Platinum Gacha is much like the Cinderella Festival Blanc Gacha, where the SSR card appearance rate is doubled from 3.0% to 6.0% and features Cinfes-exclusive SSR cards. This time, the Cinderella Festival Noir Gacha happens after that month's first regular Platinum Gacha and has its own separate pool of Cinfes-exclusive SSR cards. Cinfes Blanc cards won't appear in this gacha. As of January 19th, 2024, there will be no new Noir SSR releases.\n\nType Select/Theme/Limited Skill Pick-Up Gacha\n\nThis gacha happens for three consecutive days every month (one day per attribute), formerly after that month's first regular Platinum Gacha until the introduction of Cinderella Festival Noir where this gacha now appears after it. The cards a player can scout for are limited to one attribute (Cute, Cool, or Passion). Unlike past Type Select Gacha, all rarities are affected by the attribute constraint, not just SSR cards. Starting in April 2020, the Type Select Gacha is replaced with Theme Gacha. Instead of being limited by attributes, Theme Gacha is limited to a certain theme regardless of attributes. Only cards that fit that theme can be scouted. As of September 2020, Limited cards from the Memorial Gacha are included as well. Starting in March 2022, a new type of gacha appears - Limited Skill Pick-Up Gacha. In this gacha, only limited-time idols with specific skills (ex. Alternate, Combo Boost, and Life Recovery) will show up. As of January 19th, 2024, the Limited Skill Pick-Up Gacha will now be held simultaneously with Cinderella Festival Noir Gacha with 6.0% SSR rates.\n\nThe player can also spend 2,500 paid jewels on a special premium gacha for at least one guaranteed SSR idol with a premium cut (one day per attribute).\n\nDominant Gacha\n\nStarting on September 23rd, 2023, this special type of Platinum Gacha features a limited-time, dual-attribute typed SSR card called Dominant Idol, whose effects greatly boost bonuses depending on the idols' and songs' attribute type as well as the number of idols in an unit (including guest idol). Limited idols from the Memorial Gacha can also be pulled from this gacha. The attribute type of this pool of limited idols depends on the featured Dominant Idol's sub attribute.\n\nCinderella Festival Blanc Gacha\n\nIn this special type of Platinum Gacha that appears at the end of each month, the SSR card appearance rate is doubled from 3.0% to 6.0%. Cinderella Festival Gacha features Cinfes-exclusive SSR cards that are primarily designed around All-Type teams. Unlike Limited Gacha, Cinfes-exclusive SSR cards are available in every Cinderella Festival Gacha after the one they were featured in at a lower appearance rate unless they shared the same stat-focus as the featured Cinfes-exclusive SSR(s). Starting on January 15th, 2021, this gacha is now rebranded as Cinderella Festival Blanc.\n\nStar Shine Scout\n\nEach pull from Platinum, Limited, Type Select, or Cinderella Festival Gacha rewards players one Star Shine Scout. After 300 Star Shines (equivalent to 300 total rolls), players can pick up one of the idols that are featured in Platinum/Limited/Type Select/Fes gachas, alongside other random idols (in the case of Platinum, Limited, or Reprint Limited gachas). After the ongoing gacha ends, any left over Star Shines will be converted into Star Pieces.\n\nMemorial Gacha and Luna Shine Scout\n\nMemorial Gacha can be accessed in the Gacha menu and unlike permanent/limited/CinFes gacha pools, Memorial Gacha pool doesn't have an end date. Memorial Gacha pool consists of then-limited SSRs and SRs separated by years (September 2015 to August 2016 and September 2016 to August 2017). Each roll in the Memorial Gacha rewards players one Luna Shine, which after 300 Luna Shines (equivalent to 300 total rolls) can be exchanged for one of the idols appearing in the Memorial Gacha pool. Unlike Star Shines, Luna Shines are kept even after the Memorial Gacha changes.\n\nRarity Appearance Rates\n\nRarity Appearance Rates SSR SR R Platinum Gacha 3.000% 12.000% 85.000% Type Select Gacha Limited Gacha Memorial Gacha Dominant Gacha Fes Noir/Blanc Gacha 6.000% 12.000% 82.000% Limited Skill Pick-Up Gacha\n\nLocal Audition\n\nIn the Local Audition Gacha, players can spend friendship points in exchange for primarily Normal cards and Rookie through Master trainer tickets. It is also possible to get Rare and Super Rare cards through the gacha, but SR cards are rare. It costs 200 friendship points for one scout and 2000 friendship points for a 10 scout.\n\nCharacters\n\nThere are 190 playable idols, both in the 3D and Puchi 2D versions of the LIVE modes, as well as in Business mode.\n\nClick here to see character list.\n\nUnits\n\nThe following below is the list of units that appear in group songs, mainly appearing in event-original songs.\n\nCinderella Girls Starlight Stage Units Unit Name (Romaji) Unit Name (Jp) Type Members Image Song(s) Debut * (Asterisk) * (Asterisk) Mixed Miku Maekawa and Riina Tada ØωØver!!
