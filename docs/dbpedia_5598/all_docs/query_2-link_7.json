Seiji knows that Hiroto and Kirari like each other, and has tried to get them together, even though he may like Kirari, as well. In the final episode of the anime, episode 153, Seiji pushes Hiroto to Kirari so he can comfort her about going on stage. The two somewhat confess to each other before Kirari goes on stage.\n\nProducer Muranishi (村西 社長) is the manager of SHIPS, thus he gets along great with both of them.\n\nAmakawa Izumi (天川 いずみ) was Hiroto's childhood friend.
