This episode was just as good as episode 42 and 43.\n\nIn case you couldn’t tell, that’s me being very sarcastic and is directed at certain people who have been hassling me or just whining because all of us aren’t all raburabu for fillers like them. Yeah. The rest of us are all raburabu for good characters. You morons can enjoy your fillers with ugly filler guys and Amu’s fanboy. Let opinions be.\n\nPersonally, I’ll just look forward to next week and the week after that. I’m pretending this week never happened.\n\nRight now, I have to say it. I’m starting a no-nonsense blogging policy. I’ll allow all comments from my regular readers, but anything I find stupid from someone new (which are the only stupid comments I get anyway) never see the light of day. That includes pointless flames (it’s called an opinion you idiots), “OMG! Shugo Chara! is awesome!”, spoilers for no reason, and…too much else to list.\n\nThis only applies to my Shugo Chara posts, because everywhere else seems to be idiot-free. I’m going to enjoy this series…no matter what!\n\nI mean it’s fun laughing at these idiots, but I find no need to encourage their stupidity. Especially when it’s on my blog. And I’d rather just not deal with seeing their stupid comments either.\n\n———-\n\nSummary\n\nThere’s going to be a concert at Seiyo Elementary with the kids singing. Amu ends up with the solo, but she’s really nervous about it. A girl named Hatanaka Marimo (please correct me if I’m wrong on the spelling) gets to play the piano instead of that annoying girl Saaya. Seiichiro (Amu’s fanboy) turns out to be rreally bad at singing and Marimo helps him practice by playing the piano with him. She tells him her dream about wanting to play the piano forever (along with some other stuff).\n\nAt practice later, she makes a mistake, Saaya comes in and says some bitch things that gets everyone all worked up. Marimo leaves really upset, Amu tries to talk to her, but it doesn’t work. On the day of the concert, Marimo doesn’t appear and because of what Saaya said, her egg gets x-ed. After Amu’s charas sense it, the Guardians decide to go after the egg, but Seiichiro leaves first. Seiichiro loses his glasses so he can’t see the x-egg and tries to talk to Marimo and with both his help and Amu’s once she arrives, Amu’s able to heal the egg with open heart. Some randomness follows when Seiichiro sees Amu as Amulet Heart. Then the concert goes off successfully.\n\nAmu guesses (correctly) after the concert that Seiichiro likes Marimo, but it doesn’t seem to be stopping him from being Amu’s fanboy.\n\n-Full Summary Added Later-\n\nI’m going out with a friend today (because I have a life off the computer), so the full summary will come out tomorrow…hopefully. Honestly, I think this is enough, but the readers who rely on the summaries can tell me if they really want more (I don’t think you’re missing much though).\n\n———-\n\nThoughts\n\nFiller episode is boring. What can I say? It was mostly just Amu and her stupid fanboy. Amu is great, but one great character does not mean an entertaining episode. More Rima and Utau please. I’d wish for more Ikuto, but I know it’s hopeless at this point.\n\nBut to be fair, maybe if I paid more attention I’d find it more enjoyable. Meh…I don’t know.\n\nAmi giving Amu lessons for singing. Absolutely priceless. More Ami being adorable please.\n\nSo…because Tadase isn’t as bad as he used to be, we have to fill the gay void? Well…at least if I call this fanboy gay no one’s going to cause a fuss and take me all seriously.\n\nSheesh…all this time he’s never really introduced himself to Amu and he expects her to know his name anyway. But he pretty much wet himself with excitement when she recognized him with glasses on anyway.\n\nSatelight…I have to say it. I know that the people you have working on Shugo Chara! like to get all fancy with their transitions, but this was just freaking distracting.\n\n…that aside. Thanks. I actually had trouble finding some good plaid for random graphics (trying to make it from scratch sucks…)\n\nWell, again they do a decent job on a girl, though you can still tell that they barely put any detail in her character design.\n\nAlso…her forehead is big. Everytime a filler character doesn’t have bangs they end up with a huge forehead. Stop that Satelight or just give them all bangs.\n\nIs it just me or do these fanboys look awfully familiar? I’m reminded very much of a certain other guardian’s set of fanboys…\n\nTadase really is more tolerable when he’s part of a group. When he turned around to encourage Amu I was ready for the urge to smack Tadase for acting like a girl. But that didn’t happen so I was all ready to get annoyed at Amu for swooning over Tadase just encouraging her…but that didn’t happen either.\n\nTadase as a friend was already approved, even more so in a group. So…keep it up Satelight. I like this set of Guardians as a group! Now let’s just get Nadehiko in there too. We can’t have Tadase looking like the gay boy hanging out with all the girls (not if the Tadase fangirls want everyone to stop calling him gay or girly). But if I think about it…the only other guy that gets to be in the Guardians is a trap.\n\nWe have three girls, a girly-looking boy, and…a trap. Wow. I…never noticed that before.\n\nConductor Tadase! I found this much more amusing than I probably should have.\n\nI guess Satelight is taking advantage of his secret past with the Tsukiyomi’s. It’s a very musical family after all.\n\nObligatory friendship cuteness screencap. Rima saw right through you Amu~!\n\nYou know, I’m sure all of this was very cute to some people. Me? Not so much. They’re both undeveloped characters that really aren’t important at all. I mean the chances we’ll see any hint of this story line again? 10%\n\nI’ll say it again. I don’t mind fillers. I just don’t see the point in messing with characters like this if you’re never going to make them appear again.\n\nWhy not just add glasses on the husband so we can be all, “lol obvious” like we were back when we were all looking at that certain Shugo Chara flow card of Amu the bride and her blue-haired groom.\n\nAnother thing…what the heck is up with this? Making Saaya the big ominous bad guy. She’s just an annoying stupid ojou-sama. Leave it at that Satelight.\n\nAmu with cute little pigtails…cute~! It’s been a while since we’ve seen her with that hairstyle. More hairstyles for Amu again please.\n\nYou know what’s the stupidest part of them making Saaya the big bad guy this episode? She goes back to just being annoying again right after. It feels so unnatural.\n\nOh and…the girl that’s second from the left looks like a boy. She’s definitely a crossdressing boy. I mean I know it’s common for boys to look like girls in anime, but you have to really screw up a character’s design to make them look like a boy.\n\nI do have to admit, this episode made me feel a little nostalgic for the first 13 episodes of the anime. Now, those fillers were still pretty boring, but they were good mahou shoujo fillers. I didn’t see them as a total waste like a lot of the fillers afterwards. I could see how Shugo Chara’s target audience of younger girls would enjoy episodes like that and everything.\n\nI mean, it’s been quite a while since we’ve seen just one regular egg get x-ed because of the kid being emo. Amu’s adult cousin doesn’t count. That whole filler was a complete waste.\n\nAmulet Heart…so we meet again. Agh! There really is no excuse for this. Amulet Heart appears the most and it’s annoying every time she appears, but a lot of the time…it makes sense for her to appear. It’s like this:\n\nAmulet Heart appears when athletics or a lot of flying is necessary. A lot of fights would naturally be like that, so it makes sense for Amulet Heart to appear.\n\nAmulet Clover appears when the egg hasn’t hatched, when something else requires healing too, or when it just randomly involves cooking.\n\nAmulet Spade appears when there’s a lot of enemies (because Colorful Canvas can be useful for that) or when it involves something artistic.\n\nAmulet Spade appears the least out of Amu’s three original chara-nari’s. This situation didn’t need a lot of fighting and it involved a girl who plays the piano. Music popped up a lot in the episode overall too. We should have finally been able to see Amulet Spade again. But no. Amulet Heart for no good reason.\n\nThis is why the fillers suck. They get boring because we just see the same stuff (Amulet Heart) all the time. Not fun.\n\nThe chara’s cuter than most. Just one thing that always bothers me with the non-shugo charas. Why do they always have some random clip attachment like that note? It seems so unnecessary.\n\nWas the only reason for having it be Amulet Heart so they could make a cosplay joke? That sucks. I wouldn’t have even found that funny when I was five (even if I knew what cosplay was).\n\nAh. I could barely even hear what I was sitting through the whole episode to hear. But it’s just a chorus thing, so I didn’t expect much anyway. It was just Kanae Ito singing in Amu’s regular tone like a sixth-grader would.\n\nSo…I want character songs. I want to hear Kanae Ito sing. She’s the only seiyuu I’m following who I haven’t heard sing. I especially want a song for Dia! The voice Kanae-san uses for Dia is so cute.\n\nWell…until then. Let’s just hope we get to hear Kanae-san sing the next time we see Ikuto appear. I want my Amuto from the manga. That’s one of the cutest scenes in the whole series!!!\n\n———-\n\nPreview\n\nJokes are serious business!\n\nAh…I should have known. Rima’s filler involves a filler character. I’m still looking forward to it for cutely serious Rima, but meh…I’m still disappointed by the filler character.\n\nIt seems like a really annoying filler character too. I’m reminded of Misaki…what if this girl doesn’t leave either!?\n\nNande ane! Nande ane!\n\nHowever, I look forward to Amu’s tsukkomi training."
