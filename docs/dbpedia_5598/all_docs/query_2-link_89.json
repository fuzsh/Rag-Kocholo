        "text": "Yosh! I’m back to bring you this season’s watchlist! :3\n\nHere it is!!\n\nI have a little time on my hands so i can make some commentaries 😀 Yay!\n\nLet’s get on with it~\n\nBoku no Hero Academia Season 2\n\nI was really thrilled with all the sequels coming out this season^^ and that includes this one, of course ❤\n\nI’m so happy i’ll be seeing more of my precious baby Izuku and his Hero course classmates 😀 I can’t wait to see more of Tadoroki hehe 😉\n\nAlso, the UA sports fest seems exciting! x) uwaaaa! how will Izuku deal with all these and still become “the greatest hero”? I’m so intrigued! 😀\n\nBusou Shoujo Machiavellianism\n\nThis title, i watched on a whim hehe … I only read the synopsis and tried it out^^\n\nthe first episode was fine 🙂 i’m not really interested in martial arts and sword arts and male-targeted fanservice but i though it was ok 😀\n\nI decided to keep this in my list because i’m kinda curious what the connection is between Nomura and the “Empress” x) hehe\n\nFukumenkei Noise\n\nI was waiting for this anime since it was announced last year! xD Geeez! was the wait agonizing! haha!\n\ni read the manga and im really glad i get to see the story in animation, especially the songs! ❤\n\n#TeamYuzu all the way!! ❤ kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!! x)\n\nKenka Bancho Otome\n\nTo me, this is kind of an “over-used” genre … you know, the cross-dressing as my twin brother to attend an all-boy’s school and whatnot …\n\nbut i figured meh! its only 8 minutes per episode and its shoujo sowhat could go wrong? hehe\n\nKyoukai no Rinne Season 3\n\nI can honestly say that I wasn’t expecting this to release this season xD I was surprised when i saw in the list of releases hahaha!\n\nbut well~ i’ve watched and enjoyed the previous two season so i’d gladly have more 🙂\n\nOushitsu Kyoshi Haine\n\nThis anime definitely goes in my top this season! ❤\n\nI love the immensely cute Heine-sensei so much and i cant wait to see how he progress with his adorable prince students! x)\n\nthe first episode had me laughing up a storm and i just want moooooarrrr!!! xD\n\nSakurada Reset / Sagrada Reset\n\nThis season’s mystery anime 🙂\n\nI dont know anything about this anime prior to watching it and all the questions arising with each episode so far has left me wanting more 🙂\n\nJust what is Kei? and Misora? do they have a past? a future?\n\nWhy did that suddenly happen to Soma Sumire?\n\nDoes the bureau have a major part in this series?\n\nWHY DID MISORA HAVE TO CUT HER HAIR?!?!! UGHHHHHHH!!! lol\n\nSakura Quest\n\nI thought i’d lay low on slice of life titles but this one really got me for some reason^^\n\nnot only is the art style really pretty but i find it entertaining to see how the new “queen” of Manoyama will be able to bring in more tourists to the town^^\n\nits really quaint and light-hearted, i like it 🙂\n\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 2\n\nthe anime that waited for their hype to die down before they finally decide to release the sequel geeez! xD\n\nBut oh well! i really, really liked this series and the 1st season so this was really a treat!^^ I DID MY YEARS OF WAITING, OKAY?! haha! xD\n\nThat first episode tho … T^T\n\nStarmyu~ High School Star Musical Season 2\n\nMore of my adorable and handsome musical boys ❤\n\nIt’s exciting to see who will get the part in the graduation performance^^ I am not liking Ageha so much tho 😛 the boy needs a lesson on respect and humility geez! xD\n\nthat said, i’m really looking forward to seeing how all the characters will grow in this second season ❤\n\nso many ikemen boys … ahhhhhh~ ❤\n\nAnd there we go!\n\nI hope you check out these titles, friends 🙂\n\nthey’re all 100% GShMe recommended! 😉\n\nSee you on my next post~ ❤\n\nI’m back again, dear friends!^^\n\nmy my time just flew by since my last post … lol its already time to present my Spring 2016 watchlist!! 😀 yay!\n\nwell, getting right in to it, ladies and gentlemen, here are my personal recommendations for this anime season! 🙂\n\nQuite the list, huh?\n\nthe amount of anime they air per season increases tenfold isweartogod!! ;A;\n\nthat aside, let’s go into a little detail for each! 😀\n\nBoku no Hero Academia\n\nThe hype for this anime was INSANE!! the winter season hadn’t even ended yet and my fb newsfeed was brimming with info on this one!\n\nBasically, its a story about a young hero fanboy who gets a chance encounter with his ultimate idol and is given a chance to become a hero himself by entering a hero academy 😀 I won’t go into spoiler mode but i WILL say that this one is definitely a good one to consider^^ if i have to compare, it’s kinda like One Punch Man but with a more “child-like” approach … that was probably a bad analogy but whatever. This anime. Watch this anime.\n\nBungou Stray Dogs\n\nAnother really good release this season! 😀 not much has been revealed thus far and that just adds to its charm^^ I really can’t guess what’s gonna happen next! The characters are good, story pacing is fair and the surprises just keep piling up^^\n\nFrom what I’ve read, this anime features characters with names of famous Japanese authors, though I’m not sure if any of their literary works have any relation to the anime itself (I haven’t looked into it that far). But still! its fun to watch cute Atsushi’s adventure as he joins the Armed Detective Agency while he looks for a place to belong to 🙂\n\nHaifuri / High School Fleet\n\nPersonally, this anime was probably the most surprising this season! 😀\n\nFrom the promotion visuals, I thought that it was just another moe moe anime featuring cute high school girls but MAAAN was i wrong! xD\n\nI was delightfully surprised that it turned out to be deeper that I thought! The show actually features high school girls manning battleships BY THEMSELVES as part of training and education to become Blue Mermaids, maidens who live in the sea and protect the sea.\n\nThe setting is a Japan turned into a marine nation because most of the landmass has been submerged in the sea. Apparently, to ensure that wars don’t erupt anymore, naval forces were replaced by women and women ONLY. And so, the story of Misaki who has been assigned as captain of her own battleship as soon as she started high school begins 🙂 The slice-of-life tagged to this series gives me the impression that we’re coming on their adventures as they face the challenges that come with become a Blue mermaid^^ This anime is one of my most recommended for this season 🙂 If you like Kancolle, definitely check this out! it won’t disappoint, I promise 😀\n\nJoker Game\n\nAhh… Joker game, the pilot episode that blew my mind away into oblivion lol xD\n\nBut seriously, I didn’t expect that I’d like this anime as much as I do now. To be honest, I only watched the 1st episode out of curiosity alone. The hype was quite substantial so I figured I’d check it out, not really expecting anything and not knowing anything (didn’t look at synopses or tags) … then BOOM! my mind exploded after the first episode haha! I loved every second of it and was just left craving for more after every episode.\n\nTime is the world war era, place: Japan. A special spy agency has produced 8 promising graduates who will all be scattered around the world to blend in the background and perform their duties for their country in the war-ridden world. I explain it so bad but please check this one out! I swear its a treat for thriller, mystery, and psychological lovers everywhere! 😀\n\nKiznaiver\n\nThe story follows a group of students who, out of the blue, became Kiznaivers. They became connected to each other through wounds. LITERALLY. They share each other’s pain: when one of them gets hurt, everyone else feels the same pain. The Kiznaiver system was created by their city to “make a better life”. Other than that, nothing has been revealed as of late. It’s interesting to see where this anime is going, tbh. A lot is still in the shadows rn so I’m looking forward to what every episode reveals^^ This anime is one of the good releases this season, for sure 🙂\n\nKoutetsujou no Kabaneri / Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress\n\nAnother surprise of the season^^ I knew absolutely NOTHING of this anime before it aired. I didn’t see any hype prior and just watched it because it shared a production team with Shingeki no Kyojin, tbh. I was just curious.\n\nI’m not really a fan of the zombie genre. The sheer number of shows with zombies has just gotten overwhelming that I grew tired of it all.\n\nBut I DID like this one^^ Obvious similarities with SnK but I’m not really looking to compare. Basically, the world is now crawling with Kabane, the term they use for the zombies. Humanity is now confined in areas called stations for protection from these Kabane. The protagonist is a nerdy guy who helps out the people responsible for transporting supplies to stations. He was secretly developing a weapon to fight Kabane and by the end of the pilot episode, after almost being turned into a Kabane himself, completed it. Give this one a try! Zombie and SnK fans alike 😀\n\nMayoiga\n\nThe psychological thriller of the season 🙂 Personally, I think this one gives off the same vibe as the anime Another. I think the art style is the same as well, idk.\n\nAnyway, the story follows a group of people who join a bus tour “to start their lives over” in a mysterious village. Each passenger has left their individual lives. When they arrived in the village, it wasn’t exactly what they expected. Questions and mysteries pile up one by one added to a possible bear threat, the story will basically follow this group of unique youngsters in this village. Like I said, since I sense a resemblance to Another, there’s probably gonna be a LOT of death in this anime.\n\nKyoukai no Rinne Season 2\n\nThis one was a no-brainer. I watched the 1st season so DUH…\n\nIf you watched the 1st season, watch this. Watch it.\n\nIf you didn’t, watch that one then watch this too xD\n\nSailor Moon Crystal Season III\n\nThe remake of the legendary anime continues with the introduction of the three remaining Sailor Guardians. Nothing much to say about it, really xD Sailor Moon fans, you know what to do.\n\nSakamoto desu ga\n\nI won’t explain this. I CAN’T explain this!! xD\n\nEveryone, drop what you’re doing and WATCH THIS ANIME!!\n\nWitness the cooler than the coolest, Sakamoto-kun! 😀 hahaha!\n\nThis season’s awesome gag anime 🙂 Always nice to have a pinch of comedy in a watchlist that’s riddled with heavy, dark series^^ hehe\n\nRe:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu\n\nWhat a title! xD\n\nIf you liked last season’s Boku Dake ga Inai Machi and Konosuba, this one is definitely a must-watch! 🙂\n\nBasically, we follow Subaru, who was suddenly transported to a different world. An RPG-ish world. His excitement is short-lived when he meets a silver-haired bishoujo and gets killed by the first half of the pilot episode. Yup, killed.\n\nWatch the anime to know what happens next 😉 I swear, you’re gonna be wanting for more after each episode. I have brain farts every episode xD this anime will play with your brain like a bouncy ball is2g xD Watch it! Watch it!\n\nSousei no Onmyouji / Twin Star Exorcists\n\nThe story is about two 14-year-olds given the title of “Sousei no Onmyouji or Twin Star Exorcists”. Their destiny? to one day marry and then birth the greatest exorcist of all time: the Miko.\n\nYou know, no pressure, Rokuro and Benio xD\n\nIf you like an action-packed anime with elements of Japanese spirit magic, this one’s for you^^ the possible love story of the two protagonists will definitely be a treat to shoujo lovers like myself 😉\n\nTanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge\n\nI have never seen an anime character whom I relate to as much as Tanaka xD LOL\n\nThis boy is my spirit animal, ISWEARTOGOD!! xD\n\nAnywhale, the story is about listless Tanaka who wants nothing in the world but to become a secondary character. Never wanting to be the center of attention and prefers an uneventful everyday life.\n\nI love this anime because its very refreshing to watch^^ Its pure delight to watch Tanaka struggle with his slowly-turning eventful life. Bestfriend Ohta is also charming to watch because of his support^^ the additional characters have been a pleasure as well 😀\n\nOverall just a light-hearted slice-of-life series that, as mentioned earlier, balances out this watchlist perfectly 🙂\n\nAnd there you have it, everyone! 😀\n\nAgain, everything written here is my personal opinion and knowledge. The series included are my personal preference as well. I’ve dropped around 3 series this season and these ones are the anime that passed my screening. If you decide to watch any of the above, just know we’re watching together 😀\n\nThank you for reading~ I hope you liked this post! ❤\n\nHi again! 🙂\n\nSo i’ve decided to post my anime watchlists on this blog just so I can share and recommend the titles that I’ll be watching during that particular season :3\n\nwithout further ado, lets start with my WINTER 2016 watch list!\n\nhere it is:\n\nOk, so to go into a little detail, let’s briefly discuss each, shall we? 😉\n\nAkagami no Shirayukihime Second Season\n\nThis is a no-brainer tbh. I’ve been reading the manga since highschool and just … DUH!\n\nAnyway, this series is all about love, friendships, and life all wrapped up in beautiful visuals. Definitely a treat for the shoujo fan anywhere^^\n\nAnsatsu Kyoushitsu Second Season\n\nI freaking LOVED the first season of this and the wait for the second one was just agonizing! ;A;\n\nSo yeah … basically, the story of the class tasked to assassinate their mach5running-octopus-like-alien-ish teacher continues! Will they be able to complete their mission in the second term? Class E, fighting!\n\nAo no Kanata no Four Rhythm\n\nOk now this one surprised me. At first, I thought it would be a typical harem anime (based on the promotional pictures) but its actually a sports anime! and get this! it involves FLYING!! 😀 I swear! the mere concept of flying with just a pair of shoes had me adding this one to my list in the speed of light! lol. I’m looking forward to how the story will progress.\n\nBoku Dake ga Inai Machi\n\nThis one is probably the buzzy-est anime this season… and I’m not complaining! it’s really cool! I had goosebumps after watching the first episode and am just CRAVING for more after each one! I really cant wait to see how this story unfolds and I’m crossing my fingers that Hinazuki and Satoru’s mom don’t die a second time (>M<)\n\nDagashi Kashi\n\nAnother favorite of this season^^ but on a completely different spectrum. This one is a comedic slice of life that come in small bits per episode. it’s really refreshing 🙂 Looking forward to how Hotaru will be able to convince Kokonotsu to take over the snack shop^^ (if she succeeds) plus, learning about different japanese snacks is definitely an interesting experience. makes me want to fly to japan and try them all! haha xD\n\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar\n\nNow THIS one was a big delight! 😀 I originally didn’t plan on watching this one and it was the last one to be added to this list tbh. My fb newsfeed was just incessantly buzzing about this anime and I just HAD to see what it was about..\n\nand WOW! i was blown away by the fact that I almost missed this. So far, not much has been revealed except that the characters are modern people who woke up in a RPG-like world to fend for themselves the way RPG players normally would: killing monsters, earning money to buy equips and skills, etc.\n\nThe part on their first goblin kill really left an impression on me. I mean, sure, “its just a game” but maaaan! killing monsters for your own personal profit isn’t as simple and one-sided as I thought. geez! it still gives me slight goosebumps whenever i remember it.\n\nSo anyway! this anime is like a darker version of the SAO concept. You know, the “living in the game world in real life” thing but this one focuses on the actual hardships that could happen should such a thing actually happen; like being weaker than the weakest monsters, not earning money for basic needs, etc.\n\nHaruchika\n\nThe visuals and music concept are what drew me to this anime. I’m a sucker for the music genre 😉 hehe. So anyway, the story centers on Haruta and Chika who are childhood friends and are reunited in their high school’s brass band club. Their goal is to form a complete brass band to be able to compete in actual competitions while solving different mysteries provided by the individual prospective members. Also, apparently, both Haru and Chika have a crush on their club adviser and are vying for his attention as all this is going on. Being a non-fan of shounen ai, i am crossing my fingers REEEEEEALLY HARD that Haru is just joking or is just using it as an excuse or something for whatever reason. just please! ;A;\n\nKono Subarashii Sekai ni Sukufuku Wo! (or konosuba)\n\nWhat a mouthful of a title! haha! xD\n\nOk now this one is kinda like a lighter, more comedic version of SAO and Hai to Gensou no Grimgar. It features the same concept of living in a RPG-like world and having difficulties therein but is more focused on the crazy things that can happen; like having a goddess in your party yet having to save her from being eaten by a giant toad. lol xD\n\nAll in all, I like the light-hearted silliness of this series as it balances out the serious title that predominantly make up this list hehe\n\nNijiro Days\n\nA series really good slice-of-life shorts that portray ye olde high school dilemmas and dramas haha xD I’m a huge fan of Kimi to Boku so this one was a no brainer as well.\n\nAlso … BISHIE alert! ;D\n\nNorn9: Norn+Nonet\n\nAhhh … and OF COURSE I need my regular dose of eyecandy bishies, DUH! xD\n\nhaha but seriously, with every episode, this anime proves to be deeper and a little more serious than it appears to be. I’m intrigued at how the character’s lives aboard the huge ship Norn will turn out as more and more secrets and characters add up to the pile. hmmm…\n\nPrince of Stride: Alternative\n\nWeeeeeeee! Eyecandy Bishie Sports anime FTW! 😀\n\nhehehe *ehem ehem* well, I love the concept of this new sport their introducing^^ a little on the high-tech side if ever attempted irl with all the needed equipment but its definitely a pleasant experience this one 🙂 Looking forward on how the Honan Stride Club will rebuild itself to its former glory^^ fighting!\n\nP.S this list is based on my personal preferences. its listed alphabetically so no ranking whatsoever\n\nif you decide to watch any, just know that i’m watching with you^^\n\nSo there you go! 🙂\n\nI hope this list was even a little bit helpful with your decision on which titles to pick up this season^^ there are some other titles that came out that are not on this list so please make sure to check some other sources (I personally recommend AniChart) for the complete list of releases for Winter 2016. Have fun! Thanks for reading! ❤\n\nNote: The following post is based completely on my personal opinion. It may or may not coincide with your views and I will not be held responsible whatsoever for that ;P\n\nSo just recently, I have immersed myself in the anime genre that has eluded my interests my entire Otaku life thus far: Idol anime.\n\nNo, it’s not that I hated idol anime before or anything like that, its just that … they never really caught my attention enough for me to watch them. I did watch Kirarin Revolution but meh … it didn’t really strike me that much to be remembered. Plus, I never got to finish the series (._.) man, that series is hard to find!\n\nAnyway, what I didn’t like when it came to this genre was repetitive performance scenes. THAT was what i couldn’t stand! I watched some episodes of Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch and always got disappointed when repeat scenes would come on (r_r) I never got to finish that series either …\n\nI mean, sure these were fairly old anime and animating said scenes must be such a pain that the studios just leave them out but COME.ON. its an IDOL anime! its basically what the anime would be overflowing with! err … “stereotypically” speaking.\n\nSo yes, that was how I avoided the genre altogether for years and years. I know now though, that that was probably mostly because of my personal expectations and point of view on what idol anime should be.\n\nBUT!\n\nLo and behold! The idol anime genre got another chance with me when I found Wake Up, Girls! one day. My bestfriend had been pestering me to check it out but I never really glanced at it until I was reeeeally desperate for something to watch LOL. So I did! and was pleasantly surprised at it!\n\nONE scene. The movie had ONE full performance scene that was animated beautifully and amazingly. THAT was all it took to draw me in. I marathon-ed the series in one go and I’m now on the edge of my seat for encoded and subbed version of the movies yay!\n\nThe songs were stuck in my brain for days and I just had to see more. WUG had me craving for more. I took to the internet for some recommendations and found a few titles to look into to scratch my itches. The most notable ones I found were AKB0048, The Idolm@ster, and Love Live! School Idol Project.\n\nI really LOVED AKB0048. No matter what discussions and reactions go on around it because of its affiliation with a certain super popular idol group in Japan, I freaking ADORED it! It’s definitely a really good fusion of idol, sci-fi, and shoujo genres. I marathon-ed both seasons like I was gonna die the next day and I regret nothing! xD Too bad there were very few scenes of “Aitakatta” which was my favorite song in the entire series.\n\npuuuuu! (>3<)\n\nThen I moved on to Love Live. Oh God. Where do I even BEGIN with Robu Raibu?\n\nMy Goodness! The animation, the songs, the costumes, the plotline, it was just BOOM! a feast for my senses all through out my watch. It’s no surprise that now, its so big that its kinda getting annoying haha. It deserves it though, for the quality they deliver.\n\nI was kinda hesitant when I got to The Idolm@ster despite its many good reviews because it just, to me, appeared bland when I compared it to the ones I just discussed (This was kinda my last resort after finishing all the flashy titles). But then again, I went for it and liked it as well^^ It was simple and down to earth. I finished the series up until the last movie of the first installation. When Cinderella Girls came out, however, I stopped after the first season. I don’t know, maybe I just got tired of it. Plus the sheer number of girls to get accustomed to was overwhelming enough in the first series. I couldn’t take dozens and dozens more (-__-)\n\nSo then! Thanks to all that, I transitioned into adding Idol anime to my seasonal watchlist whenever new ones came out. I’ve watched titles such as Uta no Prince-sama, PriPara, and The Idolm@ster Cinderella girls (as mentioned earlier), to name a few and without a doubt, I can say that I’m now always looking forward to Idol anime that entertains me with awesome songs, amazingly animated performance scenes and endearing eye candy characters 😉\n\nI’m so happy at how much the Idol anime genre has come when compared to how it was years back. I’m glad they ultimately decided to focus a lot more on the music and dances than just the costumes and love stories. As a simple otaku, I salute the animators, studios, writers and composers who continuously give us a whole lot more than what we crave.\n\nBanzai!\n\nIdol anime, Banzai!\n\nPS. The photos of the anime do not belong to me. I placed them there for reference purposes only. Full credits go to their respective creators.\n\nSo there it is 🙂\n\nMy little backstory on how I got into idol anime. I wanted to make a more detailed review of each of the anime mentioned but I figured it would make the post too long. Maybe I can make separate posts for individual anime reviews, we’ll see.\n\nI hope you liked and enjoyed it. Thank you for reading! ❤"
