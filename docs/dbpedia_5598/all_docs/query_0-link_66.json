        "text": "Livres Groupe is a publisher of books whose content comes exclusively from Wikipedia articles in French. The publisher is the French branch of the American publisher Books LLC which publishes books consisting of Wikipedia articles in English. The publisher Livres Groupe was mainly active in 2010 (year of its launch) where the house published more than 60,000 books in just a few months, then became discreet by stopping completely the edition of new books from 2013.\n\nVirulent criticisms were made against the publishing house Livres Books, which sold for more than 10 euros (or up to almost 50 euros) books whose contents could be freely available via the Internet. Although the publishing house did nothing illegal (the content of the original articles was free and the pseudonyms of their authors were cited), there was no indication at first sight that the books were just a compilation of Wikipedia articles, which could mislead buyers on online sales sites. The editor believed meanwhile that the books were \"bought by people who prefer to read on paper than on a screen,\" and defended misleading the consumer.\n\nStarting in mid-2010, books published by Livres Groupe flooded online sales sites such as Amazon or PriceMinister , on which a \"Livres Groupe\" search resulted in more than 60,000 results. Amazon and PriceMinister have subsequently responded to this problem by removing from their search engine all books published by this controversial publisher."
