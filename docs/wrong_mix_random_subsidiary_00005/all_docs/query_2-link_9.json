        "text": "In interviews, Frank Herbert often explained he’d conceived the original Dune trilogy — Dune (1965, USA), Dune Messiah (1969, USA) and Children of Dune (1976, USA) — as one story, charting the creation, and subsequent fall, of a messianic leader. God Emperor of Dune (1981, USA) followed five years after the third book and, while clearly not a part of the original story, was very much an extension of its themes and the history of its universe.\n\nAnd, after God Emperor of Dune, a new trilogy, set 1,500 years after the downfall of the God Emperor, Leto II, in a universe very much changed but still bearing traces both of the time of Dune and the effects of Leto II’s 3,500 years of “Golden Path”. The first of this new trilogy was Heretics of Dune (1984, USA). It was followed by Chapterhouse: Dune (1985, USA), but Herbert’s death in 1986 meant no concluding volume ever appeared. At least, not until twenty years later — written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson, and based on Frank Herbert’s notes.\n\nCommon wisdom has it the Dune books decrease in quality as the series progresses. I’d always found the books actually increase in quality of prose, but the stories grow less interesting. It’s hardly unexpected Herbert’s writing would improve the more books he wrote, and Dune did a lot of heavy lifting in terms of world-building, casting a long shadow over its sequels. To be fair to Herbert, he rang plenty of changes on his universe in God Emperor of Dune, and in Heretics of Dune and its sequel. Sadly, not all of the changes entirely succeeded in suspending disbelief…\n\nWhen Leto II died and his empire collapsed, most of humanity fled out “into the universe”. It’s not entirely clear how many worlds were ruled by, first, the Padishah Emperor, then Paul Atreides, and finally Leto II, although there are hints it was was more than a million, possibly several million. Humanity thrived out in the “Scattering”, so much so when some of them returned a century or so before the story of Heretics of Dune begins, they outnumber those who stayed behind by an order of magnitude or more.\n\nMany of the institutions which survived Leto II’s reign are still around — the Bene Gesserit, the Guild, the Tleilaxu, Ix... but the Great Houses have gone, and Arrakis, now known as Rakis, is once again a desert planet. Melange is still hugely important and valuable, but is now manufactured by the Tleilaxu in their “axolotl tanks”. The Guild also uses Ixian navigation machines more so than they rely on melange-dependent Navigators. And theTleilaxu have bred a new generation of improved Face Dancers, who can copy a person’s memories with a touch, and so better impersonate people.\n\nBut it’s the technology derived from the “no-field” which has had the greatest impact. Ships are now invisible to all sensors (as are “no-rooms”, chambers and outposts shielded by no-fields). People descended from Siona Atreides (see God Emperor of Dune) are also “invisible” to prescience.\n\nThe humans who have returned from the Scattering are out to conquer the old Imperial worlds. They’re led by the Honoured Matres, who seem to be Bene Gesserit without the ancestral memories, but with added sexual powers and fighting ability. And, without the slightest trace of self-awareness, they’re repeatedly described as insufferably arrogant by various Bene Gesserit characters.\n\nIt’s the conflict between the Bene Gesserit (BG) and the Honoured Matres which drives one element of the plot of this second Dune trilogy. The BG have a plan, which involves yet another Duncan Idaho “ghola” (like Paul Atreides in Dune, a lad in his mid-teens as the story opens). The ghola is being trained by the BG for an undisclosed purpose, and protected by Bashar Miles Teg, the retired supreme commander of the BG forces (yes, they have an army of their own now). When the Honoured Matres attack the BG keep on Gammu (once known as Giedi Prime), Idaho and Teg a handful of others manage to escape, and hide out until they can gain passage to Rakis…\n\nWhere a Fremen girl has appeared who can apparently control the sandworms. She is quickly taken up by the Rakian priests and installed as a figurehead. But she has a mind of her own.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tleilaxu have a learnt a few things about the Honoured Matres from those Tleliaxu who went out on the Scattering and have now returned. They’re also keen to progress their own plan. Because, it transpires, all along they’ve been Muslims — well, another “sort of Muslim” to the Fremen — and for thousands of generations, since more or less they were founded, they’ve been working to convert the entire universe to their religion. If readers failed to spot this in earlier books, it’s probably because there was nothing in them to even remotely suggest it. Heretics of Dune also reveals a couple of closely-guarded Tleilaxu secrets — that the axolotl tanks are in fact living female torsos (and possibly the only female form of the Tleilaxu; an idea first floated by Herbert in Hellstrom’s Hive (1973, USA), as a post on a forum I read somewhere pointed out), and that the Tleilaxu Masters are effectively immortal as they are reborn as serial gholas.\n\nI think it’s in one of the epigraphs which head chapters in Dune that states a tripod is the most stable form of government. I can find no other reference to this and suspect it was invented by Herbert. In Heretics of Dune, he seems to have decided a tripod, so to speak, is the most stable form of narrative. He has the BG plot, especially the events on Gammu, then the Tleilaxu plotting, and, third, Sheeana and her control over the sandworms, and the priests unsuccessful attempts to control her, on Rakis. It is a carefully engineered plot, and its parts slot together with impressive precision.\n\nUnfortunately…\n\nUnfortunately, the plot can only progress because of events which are neither adequately explained in the story or world-building nor maintain suspension of disbelief, which has itself already been somewhat unstable since Dune. Teg develops superpowers, allowing him escape the Honoured Matres’ clutches and so progress the BG plot. The Honoured Matres’ power comes chiefly from wealth, but we’re not told what form that wealth takes. It’s not melange, which is still the most valuable commodity in the universe, despite its ready availability from the Tleilaxu axolotl tanks (much like cut diamonds and De Beers, I suppose, but the novel doesn’t propose any alternatives).\n\nThen there’s the no-fields, no-ships and no-rooms, and the Atreides genes which make people invisible to prescience. The Golden Path came into existence because Paul Atreides, and then Leto II, could see the future of humanity. Leto II, in God Emperor of Dune, had visions of an enemy wiping out humanity, which could track it using prescience. That novel suggested the enemy was some sort of machine race — and it was machines who proved to be this future scourge in the two sequels to Chapterhouse: Dune, written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson, Hunters of Dune (2006, USA) and Sandworms of Dune (2007, USA). Fans were disappointed — but based on a reading of God Emperor of Dune and Heretics of Dune, what Herbert and Amderson wrote is likely what Frank Herbert’s notes for “Dune 7” outlined.\n\nEven so, none of it quite adds up. The no-ships are treated like stealth spaceships, and the invisibility to prescience imparted by the Atreides genes is only mentioned on the odd occasions when Herbert seems to remember it exists. Otherwise, Herbert is too busy building up the characters of his central tripod (there’s that word again) of characters — Duncan Idaho, Sheeana, and BG sister Darwi Odrade.\n\nThere’s an exciting story with some interesting things to say in Heretics of Dune. It unfortunately gets derailed by elements which simply do not fit the universe as laid out in the previous four books. Herbert always had a bad habit of trying for philosophical depth through gnomic dialogue, and he’s actually worse at that here than he is in, say, God Emperor of Dune. In Heretics of Dune it feels like… posturing, like he’s trying for philosophical depth in a story which neither requires nor deserves it. This makes sense given his career — I’ve always considered him the most thoughtful among his generation of US science fiction writers, and I can understand why he felt the desire to maintain his thoughtfulness in these new books, when they were clearly a commercial sf property… Did he do the same in The White Plague (1982, USA), a straight-up techno-thriller? It’s been too many years since I last read it to remember.\n\nHeretics of Dune, despite the title, might as well be an instalment in a new science fiction series. It shares some world-building with Dune, but it’s too different in other areas to be a true sequel. I would dearly love to have seen a concluding volume by Frank Herbert, but that never happened — and I’ve yet to be convinced the two sequels written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson did not in some form meet what Herbert had intended when he began this second trilogy.\n\nSo, does my original position on the Dune series still hold true — so far? I think it does, but this reread of Heretics of Dune has shown me the second trilogy is less rigorously constructed than I’d remembered. It has its moments, and its ideas, but it doesn’t hold together especially well.\n\nAnd I’m not convinced it, or the trilogy it opened, added anything useful or important to the universe Herbert had built in Dune."
