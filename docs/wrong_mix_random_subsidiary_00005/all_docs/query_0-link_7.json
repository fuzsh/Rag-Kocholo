        "text": "From a distant star shining above the deserts, people came here long ago. […] What will he look like? Will his eyes be blue? […] And when he opens his mouth, young and purple, what voice will fall out of it? What will be his call? What blessing will he say? He will go through the lunar mountains and valleys, to the last edges of all worlds, from the desert to the sea…\n\nJerzy Żuławski, The Conqueror, 1910\n\nwe are a people that lost its land; and he who loses his land loses his life – for land is the source of life.\n\nLeila Khaled, My People Shall Live, 1973\n\nThe release of Denis Villeneuve’s second installment to Dune, based on the novel by Frank Herbert, was delayed in an ironic fashion comparable to that of the first, specifically a conflict between labor and capital within the American film industry, part of which was due to workers’ concern that they would be replaced or at least compromised by artificial intelligence. The film continues the story of a civilization that exists some 22,000 years from now, where an oligarchical society has spread across hundreds of planets, and where computers and artificial intelligence have been outlawed in favor of advanced cognitive development. This irony is strangely appropriate in that it provides one with a multipartite template to view the conflict taking place on Arrakis in the final act.\n\nIn his introduction to Heretics of Dune, Frank Herbert described his intention with writing the first novel with a statement that seems prescient to Villeneuve’s 2021-2024 adaptation: It was to be a story exploring the myth of the Messiah. It was to produce another view of a human-occupied planet as an energy machine. It was to penetrate the interlocked workings of politics and economics. While the two films are tonally different -the first having the mythic quality of a raconteur reciting a legend or folktale, and the second embracing the conventions of historical epics and action films- there is a sense across both of the film-as-palimpsest, one that seems to echo thematic concerns of a novel in lieu of traditional storytelling. In a review of Villeneuve’s Enemy from 2015, critic Amy Rich was asked “Is Villeneuve a good director?” Her response was apt: “I don’t think he’s a good storyteller.” Her statement indirectly addresses how one’s desire for auteurist spectacle or thematics will so often be at odds with one’s desire for narrative cinema. In my essay on Part One I argued that Villeneuve’s film created a palimpsest of the novel, one that pares down narrative elements, physical settings, and design. If the first film proved that Villeneuve had the chops to distill Herbert’s novel into such, turning a relatively “un-cinematic” book into a relatively-conventional studio narrative that abides by genre rules, the second does Herbert the favor of taking certain thematic arcs of his novel seriously. Villeneuve brings the “post-human” vision of a distant future he established in the first film -where complex individual thoughts and feelings are tempered by corrupt institutions- to its logical end by delivering an ambitious spectacle that disregards individual thoughts and feelings almost entirely. It does this particularly in its depiction of the weaponization of religion, and how seemingly easy it is to mobilize populations by doing so. This is set against the backdrop of the Part Two’s other major extrapolation from the novel: the institutional violence wrought by colonization.\n\nIn Part Two, Paul Atreides and his mother Jessica (Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson) arrive at Sietch Tabr on Arrakis with the succor of the indigenous Fremen. Paul learns how to survive in a desert environment from Chani (Zendaya), while Jessica quickly ascends to a high priestess role among the Fremen and convinces them that Paul is a messiah figure deliberately sent to Arrakis to lead them in taking back control of the planet. Meanwhile, members of House Harkonnen -who have ousted the Atreides clan and retaken control of the manufacture of the spice, an economically-vital substance- experience an administrative crisis after Rabban (Dave Bautista) has failed to find and kill Muad’Dib, who unbeknownst to anyone is actually a pseudonym for Paul after he emerges as a formidable warrior among the Fremen. This prompts the Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård) to appoint his nephew, the sadistic Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), as the de facto ruler of Arrakis. The story comes to a head when the extant members of House Atreides are able to wrangle the Fremen and their elite warrior class -the Feydakin- into reclaiming the planet from the Harkonnens through violent revolt, using the planet’s ecological and religious landscapes as weapons.\n\nMoreso than Part One, Part Two abides by marketable narrative codes, and also like the first film in doing so circumvents the inherently un-cinematic nature of the novel, providing the viewer with information without seeming to. Kaitain is not depicted or described in any of the books, and Villeneuve’s film uses scenes taking place there between the Emperor Shaddam (Christopher Walken) and his daughter the Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) as a device to move the immediate narrative forward. At the same time, it disregards much of the connective narrative tissue between the two films. While Jessica had misgivings about the motivations of the Bene Gesserit in Part One, Villeneuve awkwardly portrays her in Part Two as an active proponent of the messiah narrative implanted by the Bene Gesserit among the Fremen, delivering sermons to the population of Arrakis. Thufir Hawat from the 2021 film has vanished through the film’s final edit. Much of this truncation gives way to spectacle on a much larger scale relative to what the viewer experiences in Part One, specifically the film’s centerpiece in the sandworm ride. The sequence evokes midcentury biblical or historical epics such as The Ten Commandments (1956) or Lawrence of Arabia (1962), the latter whose subject was Herbert’s impetus for writing the novel.\n\n“It was to be a story exploring the myth of the Messiah.”\n\nVilleneuve brings the nature of storytelling to the fore in Part Two, opening with Irulan’s dictation to a journal -a narrative device taken from the novel, in turn based on Scheherazade’s narration in The Arabian Nights- regarding the Siege of Arrakis. It’s perhaps not a coincidence that the role of a raconteur in both films -oral histories, prophecies, myths, and so on- falls largely under the purview of women -being the sex that exists closer to the semiotic “meaning” of events- and not men -being the sex that codifies a paternal order to events through symbolic “language.” Part Two is unique if one views it through this lens of a “paternal order” -and the casting off of oneself from that order- established by Julia Kristeva in Révolution du langage poétique (1974). The physical absence and general aloofness of fathers and father figures (Leto, Shaddam, Vladimir, et al), which for Kristeva represent “the mainstay of the law,” clears the way for the imposition of mothers and maternal figures as the “prototype of the object,” or the first object of their offspring’s desire. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood functions figuratively as the maternal-semiotic -being the Missionaria Protectiva (referred to in the novels, implied in the films)- in a world predicated on the paternal-symbolic, being the aristocratic titles of the Great Houses of the Landsraad.\n\nIn that regard, one can consider the entrance of the film’s male characters -particularly Paul and Feyd-Rautha- into their own subjecthood and apartness from the mother figure, eventually registering as resentment of the mother and misogynistic tendency. Such resentments appear in the two as psychic violence. Paul has spice-induced visions of following a lithe woman’s figure through a desert -ostensibly his mother- into a holy war that spreads across hundreds of planets and kills billions of people. The scene where Paul shouts at Jessica, defying and implicitly undermining her parental authority (which functions as an analog for a diffuse and corrupt ideological program), indicates a rejection of this figure.\n\nSimilarly, Feyd-Rautha’s introduction takes place at the film’s other major set piece on the planet Giedi Prime, which serves as a theater of the novel’s implied oedipal conflicts. Margot Fenring (Léa Seydoux) is a peripheral figure in the novels but appears in Villeneuve’s film as a kind of 220th-century Mata-Hari or femme fatale in what is arguably the film’s best sequence, where she is sent by the Bene Gesserit to Giedi Prime in order initiate a dalliance with Feyd. Margot appeals to Feyd at first in a breathless cadence that recalls Marilyn Monroe, then invokes a maternal authority through The Voice -a subtle form of hypnosis developed by the Bene Gesserit- in order to lure Feyd into her guest room. The female voice as a device of sexual seduction in this scene can be understood in this sense as Margot’s appeal to Feyd’s unconscious and incestuous desire for his mother, since, according to Kaja Silverman, the development of a male narrative-symbolic “voice” depends upon projecting “all that is unassimilable to the paternal voice” onto the voice of the mother figure. The scene progresses into a BDSM-adjacent scenario where Margot administers a pain amplifier box to Feyd under the threat of a gom jabbar as Helen did to Paul in Part One, while at the same time the analog of figuratively returning to the womb appears to the viewer in the innuendo of Margot’s command that he “put his hand in the box.”\n\nIt is fitting, then, that Margot reveals to the Bene Gesserit sisters in the following scene that Feyd murdered his mother. Whereas the first film passes the “Bechdel Test” (by having a scene where two women with names have a conversation about something that doesn’t involve a man, ie the exchange between Jessica and Shadout), practically any scene in the second that features two or more women portrays them discussing the failings and weaknesses of men. Part Two is perhaps at its best in these scenes in that they indicate the Bene Gesserit’s “jettisoning the symbolic system,” as Kristeva would have it, established and carried out through the whims, indulgences, and political plotting of men.\n\nThis jettison is taken further with the portrayal of Bene Gesserit rituals, specifically the consumption of the Water of Life, a narcotic distilled from an infant sandworm and “changed” in the body of a Bene Gesserit. This is not dissimilar to the Catholic ritual of transubstantiation, where the Eucharistic wine consumed is miraculously transformed into the blood of Jesus. Villeneuve stated that an inspiration for Part Two was Martin Scorsese’s The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), a controversial film based on an equally controversial novel by Nikos Kazantzakis that addresses one of the core mysteries of Christianity, specifically how Jesus could have possibly been both God and human at the same time. Paul successfully transmuting the Water of Life -a process that has killed every man who has consumed it before- becomes a flashpoint of the Fremen religion. The narrative never explains how this was possible, allowing the prophecy of a savior figure to unfold in the minds of the Fremen population.\n\n“It was to produce another view of a human-occupied planet as an energy machine.”\n\nPart Two maintains the first film’s midcentury design, drawing again upon John Schoenherr’s renderings from The Illustrated Dune (1978), various film aesthetics that emerged from the Eastern Bloc (specifically cinematography of the Polish variety) and the fantastique graphic arts of South America: Juan Giménez, from Argentina, and Alejandro Jodorowsky, from Chile (who of course infamously attempted to film a version of Dune in the 1970s that would have supposedly starred the likes of Orson Welles and Mick Jagger). The gladiatorial games and sexual espionage on Giedi Prime take place in environs and monumental structures that seem inspired by Giménez’s illustrations for Jodorowsky’s La Caste des Méta-Barons (1992-2003), which in turn recall the vistas created in the bandes dessinées tradition by Jean-Claude Mézières in Valérian et Laureline and Jean Giraud -alias Moebius- in The Incal. The black-and-white photography used in the “daytime” scenes on Giedi Prime, filmed in infrared and meant as a reflection of the planet’s “low active-photosynthesis range,” takes the desaturated, “dystopian” look of so-called Soviet sci-fi -codified in Andrzej Jaroszewicz’s photography in On The Silver Globe (1977) and popularized in the west by Janusz Kaminski in Minority Report (2002)- to a colorblind extreme.\n\nThe setting of a cemetery across both films -the imagined Atreides plots on Caladan, and a literal mausoleum of an Italian family on Kaitain- fittingly serves as a kind of stage where characters iterate the novel’s motif of “plans within plans” that reach further than any one character’s lifetime. Part One sees Leto emphasize the symbolic nature of the ducal signet ring, foreshadowing that Paul will eventually ascend to higher stations than those held by his father. The Emperor’s palace on Kaitain in Part Two is “played” by the corridors of the Brion Tomb outside of Treviso, designed by Carlo Scarpa in 1969. That a mausoleum serves as the setting for conspiratorial designs between the Imperium and the Bene Gesserit -which ultimately result in a collapse of the intentions of both parties- becomes a source of narrative irony for the second film.\n\nProduction and costume design project ideology to a much greater extent than Part One. Because the second film expands the view of both Fremen and Harkonnen society, the contrast between the improvised ornament of the former and the oppressive minimalism of the latter emerges. One may consider this contrast in light of the argument put forth in Adolf Loos’s 1910 essay Ornament und Verbrechen, which characterized ornament and the ornate in dress and architecture as a low-class, undesirable pursuit, associating it -and by extension, indigenous and marginalized populations who typically pursue it- with otherness and criminality. Loos’s treatise would eventually become one of the fundamental texts of fascist aesthetics and architecture, and his characterizing of ornament as undesirable informs the Imperium’s view of the culture of Arrakis vis-a-vis that of Giedi Prime. The blue monochrome and staid beams of the audience hall and military parade on Giedi Prime reflect not just the facelessness and uniformity of a militarized society, but also capital’s general hostility to labor, which favors the repetitive and accelerated use of prefabricated material produced on a massive scale. Compare this with the sacred basin of Sietch Tabr and locations elsewhere on Arrakis, where the use of the desert landscape suggests not only the handmade adobe architecture of Latin America but the collective building effort of a community that is meant to keep architecture alive, and vice versa (the production returned to Jordan for many of its location shoots).\n\nAs well, the prevalence of baldness, monochrome armor, and solid lines of black body paint among the the population of Giedi Prime suggest not just a militarized society that values sameness and symmetry, but a deliberately synthetic society that did not develop organically. By contrast, Jessica’s filigree, headdress, and facial tattooing after taking on the role of a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother are derived from the breadth of women’s dress across the Maghreb and Arabia -the variations of which emerge from specific nomadic populations that not only do not adhere to any single uniform aesthetic, but can be read as eschewing western capitalist displays of wealth or political power. From this, one can distill the implicit economic divide between the Harkonnens and the Fremen through the visual culture of each, as “minimalism” has historically come to be synonymous with the praxis of the ruling class, whose spaces are designed not so much to be lived in, but merely displayed and admired for their “sleekness,” “modernness,” etc.\n\nIf we are to perceive Villeneuve’s films as such an analog, then we should in fairness address the admittedly flawed premises upon which much contemporary criticism subjects cinema of this kind. Several have criticized Dune for being “problematic” in that it doesn’t address casting the films with MENA (Middle Eastern/North African) performers, given that Herbert based much of the Fremen culture and language on MENA populations. This is a fundamentally flawed argument, given that while the Fremen are based somewhat on Bedouin tribes who historically have lived in the Arabian Peninsula (and to a lesser extent Muslim populations in the Caucasus and the Saan people of Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa), the characters are neither Muslims nor Arabs, and should be taken by readers of the novels or viewers of the films instead as cyphers for any and all displaced, colonized, or marginalized people throughout history: Shemot-Exodus, Palestinians, Native Americans, Tibetans, Taiwanese, and so on. By that rationale, there has conversely been little criticism of Herbert’s questionable views on eugenics and homosexuals (that he had implied in the novels and explicated in various interviews), which Villeneuve’s adaptation has smartly omitted for the most part.\n\nNevertheless, elements of Muslim Arab visual culture -which of course is not exclusive to the Middle East or North Africa- appear throughout the films as a signifier of greater institutional structures, primarily in women’s costume. The face coverings worn by Jessica and Irulan recall a battuolah, a mask typically made of metal and often featuring a veil made from beads, plates or chain, and worn by women throughout the Persian Gulf region. The masks are thought to originate in the eighteenth century, where they were developed by militaries to disguise the sex of the wearer in order to the confuse enemies from a distance. That the aristocratic women of Dune wear such masks -together with the uniform appearance of the Fremen warrior class across both sexes- suggests an androgyne future that has in some respects eschewed visual signifiers of sex and gender, and by extension certain western capitalist notions of feminine beauty, coding the subjects as equals (as an aside, one should note that the popular notion in the West from the last two decades of the head or face covering in Islam as a tool of “oppression” in predominantly Muslim countries is in part the result of American propaganda movements during the War in Afghanistan in order to justify U.S. economic and political interests in the Middle East; further, numerous reputable studies maintain that oppressive or misogynistic behavior in Muslim society is in large part the result of the patriarchal culture of medieval Christianity that was widespread in the Arab world prior to the emergence of Islam).\n\nWomen’s costume in Part Two will often collapse what registers as typically masculine or feminine, though it also parlays this into symbolic social roles. Irulan’s head covering suggests at once a maphorion -a veil that historically signified nobility in Ancient Greece and is still today associated with Eastern Orthodox images of the Virgin Mary- and the maille armor from late-medieval images of Joan of Arc. Irulan appears in extreme closeup in such a garment in an exchange between herself and Helen (Charlotte Rampling), who reveals the inner mechanizations of the Bene Gesserit to her, and it is here where she realizes that despite her standing as an heir to an imperial throne, she is powerless to stop larger political forces at work. Irulan’s costume, then, becomes a reflection of the kind of institutional “veils” one must accept in order to govern.\n\n“It was to penetrate the interlocked workings of politics and economics.”\n\nMichael Baxandall’s notion of artistic “intention” -that a work is the deposit of a social relationship that is the product of a specific time and place- is tempered by Roland Barthes’s notion of the Death of the Author -that once the work is out in the world to be consumed, the consumer is free to interpret the work as they may. At the height of Dune’s popularity across the late 1960s and early 1970s, a reader could have easily drawn a parallel between the Feydakin and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). The word Feydakin is an analog for fedayeen (فدائيون, literally “one who sacrifices himself”), a term used in both Iran since 1946 (Fedayeen e-Islam) and Palestine since 1948 that has come to be synonymous with a freedom fighter. By 1979, one could have read the events in the novel as synonymous with those taking place in Afghanistan, where U.S. military forces (House Atreides) armed the mujahideen (Feydakin) in order to combat the occupying Soviet Union (House Harkonnen). The analogs could change after September 2001, where the U.S. invaded and occupied the country that it had previously armed. Part Two’s prologue features images of the occupying Harkonnen army burning the bodies of defeated Atreides soldiers. Cremation of the dead is forbidden in Islam, and in that light the prologue’s images recall the October 2005 psyops incident in Gumbad, Afghanistan, where U.S. soldiers burned the bodies of two men in an effort to demoralize Taliban fighters.\n\nVilleneuve’s film arrives in the spring of 2024, some five months after Israel -which has occupied Palestine since 1945 with the aid of the United States’ military industrial complex- has systemically carried out a genocidal siege of the Gaza Strip, killing tens of thousands of Palestinians and displacing and starving millions more, and has taken unprovoked military action against Lebanon and Syria. Part One made the occasional allusion to settler-colonialism, through Chani’s opening narration (“They ravage our lands in front of our eyes. Their cruelty to my people is all I’ve known.” […] “who will our next oppressors be?”) and Paul’s consumption of ostensibly “authoritative” sources -the contents of which have likely been produced by colonizing entities- describing the indigenous population in highly-subjective terms (“…little else is known about the Fremen, except that they are dangerous and unreliable.”). Consider how Part Two extrapolates the following story elements, and the comparisons the viewer may draw to recent events: The Feydakin, who have limited access to weapons and aircraft, rely on guerrilla tactics to disrupt the Harkonnen-controlled spice economy. The Harkonnen fleet bombard and completely destroy Sietch Tabr and its sacred basin in response, with the viewer seeing subsequent images of displaced Fremen. The Emperor’s Sardukar serve as a silent partner and benefactor to House Harkonnen, not unlike the ongoing American support of the Israeli Defense Force in the form of billions of dollars in tax revenue funneled to military contractors. The Harkonnens refer to the Fremen in dehumanizing terms -specifically as “rats”- alluding to propagandistic western news media characterizations of “uncivilized” Arabic peoples throughout the Levant region. Feyd-Rautha’s practice of harvesting organs from slaves and feeding them to three cannibalistic harpies reminds one of multiple accusations of the Israeli military’s trafficking of the internal organs of killed Palestinians. Paul encourages a Feydakin warrior to remember the name of the planet that the native Fremen have used for thousands of years before the Great Houses dubbed it Arrakis: Dune. Bear in mind that none of these story elements appear in Herbert’s novel and are an invention of the script.\n\nThe enterprise of spice mining necessitates endless expansion, and as an analog for contemporary events, economics and “conflict” remain interlocked. Just as the role of the U.S. military in the Gulf War in 1990-1991 was not to “liberate Kuwait from Iraq” but to protect western corporate interests in the oil under its land, the forthcoming construction -financed by the U.S.- of a marine port to supposedly allow humanitarian aid to enter Palestine only reveals the U.S. intention of further colonizing the region by proxy, since the shores of the Gaza Strip contain billions of dollars in oil, the drilling licenses for which have been pre-sold to western oil companies, while Israeli real estate companies have since early 2024 advertised the presale of beachfront property on the Gaza Strip. Villeneuve’s conception of the Harkonnens at first seems almost satirical or cartoonish in its portrayal of them as ruthless capitalists, though through the narrative tropes of the modern action film in Part Two he reveals them indirectly as a moniker of the fallout of cryptofascist affairs of state in the dying days of capitalism in the west. Consider an early scene between Jessica and Stilgar as they stand by the sacred basin of Sietch Tabr: Villeneuve establishes the Fremen as a communal society where resources exist to serve populations, and to free Arrakis from its colonizers. Compare this to a later scene where the Baron speaks to Feyd-Rautha in distinctly corporate capitalist language: “Free the spice,” connoting that populations exist only to serve an economy. The Harkonnens’ systematic oppression of the Fremen, then, has nothing to do with “defending” or “preserving” a way of life and everything to do with the ideology of war crimes, being perpetual expansion into new markets through violence.\n\nTo interpret the final act of the film in this way is not such a far cry from one of Herbert’s intended caustic themes of the novel, which was that populations should be wary of charismatic leaders who inevitably rule through cults of personality (Villeneuve’s film makes several changes to the novel’s final act in order to foreshadow the Cult of Alia). Herbert pursued this idea upon consuming the popular image of, of all people, John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Consider however that Kennedy was the only U.S. President to have ever visited Palestine prior to the Israeli occupation, and attempted to have the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) designated as a foreign entity, which, had he been successful, would have greatly diminished AIPAC’s lobbying power and altered the course of history that has instead led to the shameful state of affairs in Palestine today. It wouldn’t be much of a stretch of the imagination to view Herbert’s (and to some extent Villeneuve’s) characterization of Duke Leto as an analog for Kennedy: sympathetic toward the Fremen but unable to form meaningful alliances due to being caught in a corrupt political process.\n\nThe film deliberately has no ending, which registers as a cliffhanger in a modern studio sense, and the changes to the novel -particularly those in the final act- make it clear that Villeneuve intends to produce Dune Messiah (which, given that book’s narrative, is more likely to take its genre cue more from canonical gangster films such as The Godfather than from science fiction). In doing so, the filmmakers have created an underlying sense of causal inevitability with regard to the film’s critique of the savior myth. As a result, Chani emerges as a foil of sorts to the forthcoming “holy war” led by Paul (Villeneuve’s film avoids using “jihad,” perhaps for the better given that the term has historically been misunderstood and misrepresented by the west and its media, including Herbert himself).The two films are bookended with images of Chani, who played by Zendaya bears a vague resemblance both in appearance and ideology to the Palestinian militant Leila Khaled: she wants only to free her people from occupation, and in some ways signifies the place of women historically in resistance movements at large. To that effect, Villeneuve’s adaptation of Dune reveals an admiration for women as foils to so many of the symbolic codes to which narrative fiction abides. After the final confrontation between Paul and Feyd, for instance, everyone including the Emperor kneels before Paul in a symbolic political gesture with the exception of three people, who at this point in the story seem to understand the farcical nature of the institutional structures with which they’ve been presented: Chani and Irulan remain standing, while Jessica is seated.\n\nIs it a stretch to read so much into an expensive genre film? Maybe, but it is certainly part and parcel with the reductive “critical” templates applied to a lot of popular cinema today -a cinema that seems designed to be easily deconstructed. This is perhaps moreso the case given the time that the source material was published. A thing to remember about Herbert’s 1965 novel as it pertains to cinema is that up until the codification of the American blockbuster in the 1970s -specifically Jaws from 1975 and Star Wars from 1977, the former based on a Peter Benchley bestseller and the latter a variation of Alex Raymond’s Flash Gordon (and Dune)- genre novels and short stories in the United States were for the most part a form of entertainment distinct from genre films. Authors of Herbert’s generation such as Ursula K. Le Guin, Damon Knight, or Kate Wilhelm would not necessarily have been seen as “source material” for a Hollywood event movie. It is also doubtful that that generation could have imagined the kind of digital spectacle that is possible in cinema today, hence the potency of its genre fiction, written under the presumption that no film or television show could ever possibly render what was happening -at least in a competently mimetic sense. This mentality changed with the advent of New Hollywood in the 1970s, and ever since then the writing-publishing process of most popular fiction -horror, sci-fi, thriller, mystery, legal, noir, et al- is carried out with a film adaptation in mind at both the creative and contractual levels (for better or worse, film adaptations of previously published works or existing properties will on the average generate twice as much revenue than films based on original screenplays). Part Two capitalizes on this formula as well, since a renewed built-in audience has now emerged 35 years after Herbert’s death. I publish film writing under a pseudonym because it allows me to address taboo subject matter untethered, but also because part of my actual job involves visiting people’s houses on a routine basis, and in the two and a half years since the release of Part One, there has been a renewed interest in Herbert’s novel with its appearance on countless nightstands and coffee tables. Whereas cinema is bound by the limitations of the physical world -costumes, sets, stunts, computer technology, etc- fiction is bound by nothing but the reader’s imagination.\n\nA special thanks to Amna, Kephran, and Turk.\n\nFor Aunt Karin, who loved Dune more than anyone.\n\n“The pleasure I took in all that was new and strange.” —The Arabian Nights\n\n“It’s clean.” —Major Lawrence\n\nA film version of Dune seems to have the aura of a celestial phenomenon that occurs once every few decades, and with all of the mythic qualities, superstition, and anticipation that surrounds such a thing. A lot can happen in a few decades: children born in 1979 know what life was like before the internet, for instance, and see the world in a fundamentally different way than children born in 1999. How different will the human épistémè be in another 20,000 years? One of the distinctions of Frank Herbert’s novel, first published in 1965, is that the reader is treated to a vision of an interplanetary empire several millennia into the future, where humanity finds itself bound by social conventions and ritual almost completely divorced from our own. The book’s film adaptations (and abandoned and would-be adaptations) have their own storied history, and to his credit, the French-Canadian Denis Villeneuve, whose film version was intended for a 2020 release but was ironically postponed due to a planetary crisis, has accomplished what numerous directors over the last half century—including Alejandro Jodorowsky, Ridley Scott, and Peter Berg—for one reason or another could not. However, in doing so he has accrued a debt to certain aesthetic conventions that have developed in the American studio system—particularly as they pertain to multimillion-dollar productions of what are essentially B-movie genre scripts—over the last twenty years.\n\nHerbert’s novel was one of my favorites as a teenager. My father gave me the Putnam hardcover—its title printed in the signature “Orthodox Herbertarian” typeface—for my fifteenth birthday many moons ago, and it was probably not a coincidence that at the time I had turned the same age as that of the book’s protagonist, Paul Atreides. The story is set in what in our calendar would be the 24th millenium, where feuding aristocratic houses clash over the control of an interplanetary trade in spice, a substance that serves as both a narcotic and a vital fuel source for space travel, and is found in only one place throughout the universe, the desert planet Arrakis. Paul (Timothée Chalamet) is the issue of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), who has been appointed the new ruler of Arrakis by a decree issued by Emperor Shaddam IV, supplanting its previous rulers, the Atreides’ rivals House Harkonnen, led by its patriarch, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). Paul’s mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is the former student of Gaius (Charlotte Rampling) in the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood—a school that trains women in powers of hypnosis and observation—and is conflicted between her loyalties to the Sisterhood and House Atreides. After being installed on the planet, House Atreides is sabotaged and uprooted by the Harkonnens, who, conspiring with the Sardaukar—the Emperor’s elite military force—hope to gain a foothold on spice production while eliminating the increasingly popular Atreides family. The conspirators kill the Duke, while Paul and Jessica manage to escape to the open desert. It is there that they befriend the Fremen, native to the planet.\n\nThis synopsis describes “Book One” comprising about the first half of the novel, which forms the basis of Villeneuve’s film. Herbert’s saga of the Atreides family incorporates much from narratives established in antiquity—specifically the stories of Medea, Oedipus, Moses, and Muhammad. As in Exodus, though Paul was born into wealth he eventually finds his calling as the leader of a displaced people with a long history of exile, and Herbert’s description of Paul’s physical characteristics is not unlike those of the Prophet in various Persian hadiths from the 9th Century (“…he was neither tall nor short, his skin neither very white nor very brown, his hair neither lank nor curly […] his eyes were dark”). Since the book’s publication, Paul story arc—a subject who has removed himself or been forcibly removed from the “civilized” world and who becomes immersed in a more “primitive” or “elemental” culture, finding himself more comfortable in the latter—has been so influential on countless films, from Avatar to Dances with Wolves to even Joe Versus the Volcano, audiences take it for granted as a narrative trope. It follows that the book—together with works by Herbert’s contemporary Ursula Krober LeGuin—had a tangible effect on late-1960s counterculture and its early-1970s fallout in the Anglophone world—comparable to the effect of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s The Gulag Archipelago (1973) on young leftists in western Europe at about the same time—as many members of the Baby Boomer generation came from social circumstances not unlike those of Paul: reared in a culture of privilege and ostensibly “rejecting” that culture as young adults for something more “real” and vicariously questioning various structures of political power, if only for a time.\n\nLikewise, the book has always had a particular appeal to adolescent and teenage boys of subsequent generations, echoing Sabina Spielrein’s analogous conception of a boy’s infancy and adolescence as a heroic adventure: a child growing apart from his parents and entering selfhood coinciding with that child’s internal “fantasy world” of being an explorer or discoverer who eventually becomes the conqueror and ruler of a new land. This imagined scenario surrounding the development of a young person—particularly a young man—forms the primary narrative arc of Herbert’s tale: the boy can be taught only so much by his parents and mentors but is eventually obliged to strike out on his own, and ultimately become a different person. Further, the dynamic Herbert established between Paul and Jessica is perhaps one of the earliest modern instances of the ambivalent relationship between a young man and his mother used as an underlying theme of genre fiction that follows this narrative arc. It is perhaps not a coincidence, then, that since the emergence of New Hollywood the two strongest filmgoing demographics in the West for genre cinema—being science fiction, fantasy, horror, and the like—are teenaged boys and middle-aged women.\n\nThis might account in part for the legacy of Herbert’s novel, but there is more. A common criticism that readers and viewers have historically leveled at both the books and its film adaptations has been that, narratively, they seem to fail on a “human” level—“human” meaning that a work of fiction presents subjects to whom one can “relate” or situations with which one can “identify.” Yet the story takes place in a very distant future that is fundamentally different from our present. It is also anathema to most contemporary science fiction, exemplars of which are so often meant as “cautionary tales” set “in the not-too-distant future.” One thing to keep in mind however is that while Herbert’s subjects are ostensibly human beings, they are human beings that are the product of thousands of years of accelerated, almost steroidal evolution, informed by the manipulation of bloodlines and by regiments of harsh mental conditioning (to say nothing about Herbert—who died in 1986—not knowing that, half a century after he would write the book, genetic engineering would reach a point where human beings could essentially control their own evolution). Humans in Herbert’s world have achieved powers of telepathy, hypnosis and mind control, but also technology that can shield a person or thing from telepathic detection, savant-like abilities to perform complex math equations without the use of computers, the acute manipulation of hand and facial features, and even the reanimation of corpses. At the same time, humanity has backslid culturally into a state resembling feudal Japan, the waring monarchies of seventeenth-century Europe, and cryptofascism: court intrigue, poison and contraceptives as methods of assassination and sabotage, ritualistic violence between armies sent to their deaths by rival aristocrats, clandestine political power wielded by religious organizations, widespread eugenic programming, few reservations regarding honor killing and incest, and women relegated to the roles of concubines and soothsayers. The first scene in Villeneuve’s film—where Jessica and Paul share breakfast (not in the book and an invention of the screenplay)—encapsulates Herbert’s vision of an oppressive future: “Why do we have to go through all this [ceremony/formality/etc],” Paul asks, “when it’s already been decided?” Jessica’s only response is: “Ceremony.” This allusion to institutional structure is almost negated by the use of the Voice—the manipulation of vocal chords by the speaker in order to immediately influence the listener—in the same scene. The mother, in an almost Oedipal act toward her son, says regarding a glass of water: “If you want it, make me give it to you.” Jessica has trained Paul in the use of the Voice, forbidden among men according to Bene Gesserit teaching. The scene suggests the extent to which institutions have affected populations, and what those populations might do to subvert them.\n\nDune is, in this regard, about the extent to which human beings are at once the products and servants of various institutions—cultural, political, or otherwise—and perhaps one thing accounting for the “un-relatability” of characters and events in Villeneuve’s film is his fidelity to the source novel when it comes to social divisions: like a melodrama from early modern Europe, despite its scope, the world of Dune is insular, confined to a handful of aristocratic families competing with each other for political power. These are divisions drawn largely along socially-constructed cultural and ethnic lines, which are meant to hide actual social divisions based on economics. The film addresses this, in its way, by turning the Harkonnen family into conventional villains meant to register under late capitalism in North America—specifically an analog for both greedy corporate capitalists and the politicians they buy.\n\nWhere does this leave a conventional film hero in the 2020s? The installation of the Atreides family as ostensibly benevolent overseers of spice mining operations on Arrakis—and the imagined optimism that accompanies it—brings to mind Joseph Biden reassuring millionaire campaign donors in June 2019 that “…nothing will fundamentally change.” If one were to “update” or “modernize” Herbert’s story, all of the film’s competing houses would be a villainous monolith, while one would root for the Fremen and spice miners as displaced and disenfranchised guerrilla heroes. Watching the film, I imagined what someone like Pier Paolo Pasolini (who loved contemporary variations of mythical narratives set in desolate, totalitarian landscapes more than anyone) might have thought of the implicit conflict between its social strata. Pasolini and Herbert both flourished around the same time—the mid-1960s through the mid-1970s—and their works were, by varying degrees, responses to Foucaultian power structures present throughout the West at the time. Would Pasolini have wanted the Fremen and spice miners to form a coalition with the Atreides army and the Sardukar in a revolt against the regime that has pitted them all against each other (since even the enforcers of law, in Pasolini’s view, are as much the victims of those structures as the enforced)? Further, one might also see Herbert’s world—where ritualized violence seems to be the only means settling disputes—as being predicated on the male subject’s estrangement from the maternal, as with the perceived “witchcraft” and duplicity of Medea and the Bene Gesserit and the similarity between the fates of Oedipus and Paul.\n\nOedipal conflict abounds moreso in Villeneuve’s adaptation of Herbert than in any other. In a sequence after the attack on Arrakis’s capital, Arrakeen, where Paul and Jessica have come to realize that Leto is dead, Jessica, having lost her sexual partner, moves psychically closer to her son. She shudders at his touching her, if it is only to fasten her stillsuit. It is at this point in the narrative where the two are searching for the Fremen in the open desert, and where “closeness” between the mater figure and offspring takes on both elements of the transitive (“closer” to their destination) and the intransitive (“closer” to each other). That the film acknowledges in the following scenes that Jessica is pregnant with her and Leto’s daughter Alia adds another dimension to this, given that Paul—in his heightened awareness after his first exposure to the spice—knows that Jessica is pregnant, and in knowing what no one else would know by necessity, stands in for Leto in a paternal role.\n\nConsider also an exchange early in the film between the mother and the son, where Jessica confesses the objectives of the Bene Gesserit organization to Paul, extrapolating the divide between her obligations to her biological and “institutional” families. The scene takes place in a dense fog, not unlike that in a similar sequence in Michelangelo Antonioni’s Red Desert (1964). It is in this scene in both films where the subject is confronted by a conflict between her loyalties and her desires, and on a longer timeline, where the “postmodern” existence popularized by Antonioni in mid-century intersects with Herbert’s subjects conflicted by the imperialist influence on what even after countless millennia remain “human” thoughts and feelings.\n\nA film that did nothing else but address the political or sexual themes in Herbert in the manner comparable to Pasolini or Antonioni, however, would be a remake of Jaws told from the point of view of the shark. Thus, with any large-scale studio epic (or political apparatus or sexual landscape), Villeneuve must abide by marketable narrative codes. The audience is meant to privilege the “good” aristocratic house over the “evil” one, lest there not be an “identifiable” narrative conflict. To seasoned readers of Herbert’s books, however, this is moot relative to what eventually happens to the Atreides family, and if Warner Brothers and Legendary Pictures hope to establish a franchise “tentpole” with Villeneuve’s film, they are in for a surprise with Dune Messiah, set after a twelve-year crusade led by Paul across hundreds of planets that kills several billions of people, and ending with him abandoning his infant offspring. Paul is not a typical “hero.”\n\nNevertheless, Villeneuve’s Dune is distinguished in its intended and perhaps unavoidable subtext of colonialism, and the response of the colonized. Just as Pasolini had attempted to combine ancient texts with ethnography in works shot in Africa, India, and the Arabian peninsula, Villeneuve approaches the fictional Arrakis with a similar sensibility, shooting largely in Abu Dhabi and Jordan. Consider Villeneuve’s short film Terre des hommes from 1990, made as an episode for the Quebec television show La course destination monde, which would send student filmmakers abroad to film ethnographic footage of peoples encountered, the premise of which was to raise an awareness of impoverished and displaced populations (Villeneuve’s episode incidentally uses music from David Lynch’s Dune on its soundtrack). As early as this, one sees Villeneuve’s conflation of the displaced in Herbert’s novel with those throughout the world. The 2021 film recreates Terre des hommes’s image of a family’s tent shelter in the guise of an ornithopter tarp.\n\nThe casting for the Fremen follows suit, as almost all of the speaking roles are occupied by actors of either Black African or Hispanophone descent. Villeneuve’s film eschews issues of “representation” to acknowledges all displaced populations as a grassroots force to be reckoned with, the Fremen being an analog for the downtrodden left out to dry by sociopolitical (ie capitalist, imperialist, colonialist, et al) forces throughout the world, who, having exhausted all “proper” diplomatic channels, are left with no recourse but violent revolution. In Herbert’s vision, colonization and its foils were predicated not on humans’ ability to mobilize machines and weapons, but to weaponize religion and disrupt economies in the process. It may come as no surprise, then, that Dune was infamously the favorite book of Osama bin Laden as a college student. In the wake of the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001, Bin Laden had been quoted as saying that al-Qaida’s objective with the attack was to slowly exhaust the United States’ economy by spurring its government to funnel more and more money—over $8 trillion in the last two decades—into overseas wars and away from nearly everything else. The West’s efforts to exploit foreign populations under the guise of “civilizing” them typically result in those populations eventually fighting back—their way.\n\nThis is peripheral to the filmmakers’ longterm objective with Dune, however, being getting a relatively difficult and “un-filmable” book to register in film language. Josh Brolin revealed in a press conference after the premiere at the Venice Film Festival that the cast and crew had been advised to “speak away from the fandom” that surrounds Herbert’s novels in their publicity, likely in an effort to get a global audience unfamiliar with a nearly sixty-year-old book interested or at least intrigued (the morass of studio “making of” featurettes that preceded its release in the United States and China was intended as an “orientation” or “introduction” to its story). The campaign had more to do with tapping into a market of filmgoers inured to the comic book spectacle that has monopolized studio filmmaking over the last decade (which necessarily must cater first to Asian markets, then to domestic markets) rather than a “silent majority” of Herbert devotees around the world (Dune is the best-selling science fiction novel of all time).\n\nWith that in mind, Villeneuve almost by necessity plays along with the monolithic system put before him, and as a result, his Dune has a workmanlike sensibility—in its production design, cinematography, and visual effects—that resembles the state of prestige genre filmmaking today, approaching Herbert in the same way that Christopher Nolan approached the eponymous subject in Batman Begins (2005). Nolan’s film, for better or worse, codified the approach within the American studio system to the “re-imagining” (and the renewal of rights and licensing) of pop culture properties: sleeker, darker, more serious, and more self-important. At the same time, one should acknowledge the influential reach of various illustrators for the covers of science fiction paperbacks published throughout the 1960s and 1970s—particularly John Schoenherr, whose paintings and drawings appeared in The Illustrated Dune in 1978—on Villeneuve’s images, as well as the aesthetic standards first put forth by studios with Steven Spielberg’s Minority Report (2002). Upon its release, Minority Report was praised for its overall slick, “clean” appearance, with critics associating that quality with an “optimistic” vision of the future relative to its default comparative film also based on a Philip K. Dick story, Ridley Scott’s grimy and “pessimistic” (though far more colorful) Blade Runner (1982). The look was later codified by Nolan’s Inception (2010) and Scott’s Prometheus (2012): minimalist, quasi-Brutalist, moderne environments, rendered in a clinical palette with a limited color range. The cinematography by Greig Fraser for Dune falls in with that palette.\n\nIt behooves the viewer to know, however, that this is not a distinctly “American” or even “Western” aesthetic, as it was established by Polish-born cinematographers working in the American studio system since the early 1990s—specifically Janusz Kamiński, who shot Minority Report and Dariusz Wolski, who shot Prometheus. Kamiński—born in Katowice but educated in the United States—and Wolski—an alum of the revered Łódź film school—are both of the generation exposed early on to the Wolfen ORWO film stock procured in the Eastern Bloc after the 1960s—often branded as Sovkolor or Polkolor—which tended to accentuate “cold” or sterile colors as blue, silver, gray, teal, green, turquoise, etc. The look came to be synonymous with “Soviet” or “Eastern European” (and, implicitly, “dystopian”) science fiction, notably Andrei Tarkovsky’s Solaris (1972), Andrzej Żuławski’s On the Silver Globe (1977), and Piotr Szulkin’s O-Bi, O-Ba: The End of Civilization (1985).\n\nThis look ran contrary to that of American film stocks, which historically had always based their color palettes on southern California (ironic, then, that George Lucas’s Star Wars (1977) appropriated so much of the anti-utopia imagery of Frank Herbert, Stanislaw Lem, Robert Heinlein, and the rest, using the visual conventions established by the USC Film School). The vestiges of the “Soviet” look emerged in American cinema after the collapse of the Eastern Bloc in 1989, when cinematographers, mostly Polish and of the “Łódź School,” found work in Hollywood: Andrzej Bartkowiak, for instance, managed to make southern California look “cold” and “sterile” with Speed (1994) and Species (1995).\n\nVilleneuve’s film takes its place, in that regard, among a group of perverse, surface-level Hollywood versions of Soviet science fiction that have absorbed the latter’s appearance and style without entirely understanding the purpose of either. One also sees this in the overall production design that has stripped film objects down to geometric forms: space- and aircraft, which at times bear a strong resemblance to monumental war memorials throughout Eastern Europe, and the city and keep of Arrakeen, which draws both from Brut building design and the ancient structures of Giza and Teotihuacán. This is not necessarily the “fault” of the filmmakers either, but merely a part of the épistémè inhabited by genre films made in the last decade.\n\nHans Zimmer’s film music has followed the same program. Since the early 2000s, Zimmer’s works have become more about instilling a sense of urgency or immediacy (“incidental” music that accompanies onscreen action) in the viewer, rather than establishing a mood or tone for a particular scene. The romantic and tragic themes of The Lion King (1994) and Crimson Tide (1995) have been supplanted by stings, brays, and percussionist pounces that seem better suited to film trailers than to actual films. We know from a 2003 encounter between Zimmer and John Carpenter on the German television show Durch die Nacht mit… that Zimmer admitted to having “borrowed” several of Carpenter’s themes, beginning with the score for his Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), revealing that the composer has in recent years adopted a “rock music” structure based on percussion and distorted modality rather than on melody. The music in Dune—while featuring the occasional striking duduk solo or industrial drone—contains the vestiges of Carpenter and Alan Howarth’s chorals from Prince of Darkness (1987), as well as a variation of Maurice Jarre’s theme from Lawrence of Arabia (1962), and (again returning to Eastern Europe) the percussion and vespers by avant-garde composers György Ligeti and Krzysztof Penderecki.\n\nYet, the aesthetic distance established by Fraser’s quasi-dystopian photography and Zimmer’s atonal music in its way succors a vision shared by Herbert and Villeneuve alike—that of a “post-human” science fiction more interested in behavior and social ritual than in spaceships and sword fights. In fairness, this is a theme that has preoccupied Villeneuve in one form or another over the last decade. His films Enemy (2013)—where a college instructor meets a man who looks exactly like him—and Blade Runner 2049 (2017)—where androids are ostensibly capable of sexual reproduction—both cast one’s notion of biological identity into question. Dune depicts a practically alien civilization populated by human beings bound by social structures that force their behavior into rigid performative theater. Villeneuve’s film arrives at a less-than-fortunate time when “identifying” with a fictional subject is privileged more than ever over the perverse pleasure of merely regarding the étrangete of a fictional subject, the former arguably not being conducive to viewing a filmic variation on Herbert’s novel. This paradigm favoring identity and identifying pushes the scalpel straight to the marrow of what “speculative fiction” is all about: why must viewers always “see themselves” in the subjects and narrative conventions put forth by genre, when they could merely regard as phenomena a strange world put forth by genre?\n\nDespite this, one cannot by necessity discourage a Hollywood workmanlike sensibility with a novel such as Herbert’s. The opening credits to Jean-Jacques Annaud’s film adaptation of The Name of the Rose (1986) feature a title card reading “A Palimpsest of Umberto Eco’s Novel,” implying that the film will provide only an impression of of a much denser literary source. Villeneuve’s film is a palimpsest as well, working in a similar fashion to pare down scenes to their essential courses of action while filling the margins with Brutalist architectural forms and admittedly grand location footage that follow function (again, Pasolini would have admired the landscapes shot across the Persian Gulf region). In the same key, both films render the notion of “fidelity” in film adaptation of written fiction as being moot altogether, since that notion neglects fundamental differences between the two media. Aside from the occasional description of a landscape (“…it could be a hideous place”), facial feature (“elfin”), or article of clothing (yellow the color of mourning), there is almost nothing “cinematic” about Herbert’s novel cycle, the great expanse and breadth of its world left mostly to the reader’s imagination. There is relatively little dialogue, large portions of the narrative are spent inside characters heads (“…s/he thought”), and as in ancient Greek drama, the “spectacle” of war violence is often referred to after the fact.\n\nThis, for the most, runs contrary to the mechanics of narrative cinema. To compare Villeneuve’s film with Lynch’s 1984 version, one finds that the latter is fundamentally different from the book in many ways, particularly the ending and certain liberties taken in order to exploit the use of sound (“weirding modules”), yet better resembles the book’s “literary” aspects as they pertain to characters’ thoughts and motivations. Consider the narration by Irulan, based on literary quotes at the top each chapter of the book (a narrative structure Herbert in turn appropriated from Scheherazade’s storytelling device in The Arabian Nights). On the other hand, Villeneuve’s film often sidesteps awkward internal monologue and expositional dialogue by incorporating the books’ various encrypted “battle languages”—both spoken and signed—conveying plot points and characters’ thoughts so that the viewer may see/hear them while the film’s characters do not.\n\nWhat emerges is not so much a question of value judgments but what “moments” or “themes” a filmmaker extrapolates. To ask if Don Siegel’s film version of Ernest Hemingway’s The Killers from 1964 is “better” than Robert Siodmak’s from 1946 (or Andrei Tarkovsky’s from 1956) is arguably the wrong question. Is one also asking the wrong question in considering if Villeneuve’s film will have the same “shelf life” as Lynch’s film. Despite the majority opinion of the latter, audiences still ponder it nearly forty years later, if only as a curio, being one of the most bizarre productions ever financed by a major Hollywood studio. Whether or not audiences will feel compelled to return to Villeneuve’s film four decades from now is difficult to say, yet its place in an intertextual network of a seemingly endless supply of soft sci-fi/fantasy and comic book properties—all blanketed by a lowest-common-denominator sameness in photography, design, and visual effects—doesn’t suggest as much. William Friedkin said in 2008: “If we remade The Exorcist now, it [the visual effects] would be a piece of cake…and it would be boring as hell.” If the history of visual culture teaches one anything, it is that a cultural product—a film, painting, piece of furniture, building, article of clothing, etc.—will ultimately reveal less about the artist who made it and more about the culture in which the artist worked in the first place, as the “deposit of a social relationship,” according to Michael Baxandall, owing its posterity largely to the market forces that allowed such production to happen at all. Just as Lynch’s film was a product of its time—Dino de Laurentiis’s “ambitious” productions, the desperate scramble throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s to capitalize on the success of Star Wars—so is Villeneuve’s in how it fills the mould cast by studios over the last two decades: the ubiquitousness of digital film and near-total dependency on CGI, the efforts to establish franchise tentpoles, and an overly self-conscious insistence on its own NPR-friendly allegorical importance.\n\nThe viewer is left, then —not just with Villeneuve’s adaptation but also with those that came before it—with a singularity of sorts: an anomalous picture window revealing an alien world that almost stubbornly resists any reasonable semiotic or contemporaneous interpretation. This in part naturally lends itself to genre fiction, and is not necessarily limited to fiction set an imagined future. One doesn’t watch a Kurosawa epic set three centuries ago, for example, to necessarily find an intellectual common ground with the cultural institutions of feudal Japan. Sergio Leone once said regarding his film Once Upon a Time in America (1984): “I wanted to create a world, a plausible world, but one that allows the myth to exist. The myth is everything.” Villeneuve has approximated that myth for devotees of Herbert, if merely inside the aesthetic limits that institutional forces have placed before him at this particular time.\n\nA special thanks to Kephran, Hiram, and Amna.\n\nDespite his reputation as an outlier in the history of Polish cinema, the filmography of writer-director Andrzej Żuławski contains vestigial traces of the literary, political and artistic movement known in his homeland as romantyzm, commonly referred to in English as Polish Romanticism. Żuławski’s early cinema not only has a partial basis in the literary conventions of that movement, but as film texts in themselves can be interpreted as Romantic works -particularly in their coded depiction of the Polish state. To view his early filmography as such, we might predicate our understanding of it on what Fredric Jameson called the socially symbolic act -“the data of one narrative line [being rewritten] according to the paradigm of another narrative,” in his words. While Żuławski once stated that “…cinema isn’t there to illuminate political or even ethical forms,” Jameson’s notion that any text will inevitably be the product of the culture that produced it while at once being, according to Simone Weil, subject to the mechanics of conflict, political or otherwise -even when that text proffers a self-reflexive critique of that culture. This is very much the case with the subject and its portrayal in two films by the director’s hand: the allegorical in Diabeł (The Devil, 1972), and the nostalgic in La note bleue (The Blue Note, 1991). Both films are woven through with what Maria Janion called the “romantic paradigm,” being the specific “romantic mode of feeling” for interpreting reality.\n\nTo understand what one means by “Romanticism” in terms of the Polish text will be propitious in such an approach to Żuławski’s cinema. The definitions of (capital-R) “Romantic” and “Romanticism” over time are in themselves something of an exercise in descriptive semantics. Each instance of Romanticism is of course provisional and contextual, and in most cases the distinction is made by way of nationality -Polish romantyzm vis-a-vis French romantisme or Anglophone romanticism- rather than something else (“the Romantic movement in Germany differs from that in France or England in this or that way”). Much of this operates inside the notion of “cultural Zeitgeist” that had emerged alongside the concept of a “nation” in social and cultural criticism in the late nineteenth century, as it was only by the 1880s that the modern notion of a “nation” defined chiefly by its language and political structure developed. Up until that time, definitions of a “nation” were predicated on either Johann Heinrich Zedler’s 1740s definition -a group of Bürger with commonly-shared beliefs, customs and laws- and/or more commonly a mere geographical boundary. Żuławski’s cinema and its relationship to romantyzm emerges as a combination of both nascent nationalist sentiment predicated on language and geographical boundary -the latter being a point of dispute for Poland for much of its modern history.\n\nŻuławski himself was largely indifferent to the Romantic tradition in Poland, once stating that he did not intend his cinema to either promote or negate it, calling it “the tree he grew on,” meaning that it was merely one part of the country’s social fabric -which was and is informed by its national literature. In that regard, the romantyzm strain appears in nearly all of the director’s films. Consider one of the closing shots in Na srebrnym globie (On the Silver Globe, 1977), based on a nineteenth-century novel cycle his great-uncle Jerzy Żuławski: Moving northwest up Krakowskie Przedmieście in Warsaw, one sees centuries of Polish history literally in its margins. The single shot begins roughly at the Rondo Charles de Gaulle, at the time the location of the headquarters of the Communist Party of Poland, and passes the eighteenth-century Pałac Kossakowskich, where in 1893 Władysław Podkowiński painted the famed Szał Uniesień (Frenzy of Exultations); Pałac Zamoyski, a seventeenth-century house looted by the Russian Imperial Army in 1863; the seventeenth-century Pałac Staszica, originally a burial chapel for Russians captured in the Polish-Muscovite War of 1605-1618 that was later bought by philosopher Stansław Staszic, who in 1830 placed a statue of Toruń-born Copernicus outside; the fictional residence of Stanislaw Wokulski, the protagonist of Bolesław Prus’ 1880s serial novel Lalka (The Doll) who made his fortune as a profiteer in the Russo-Turkish War in the 1870s; the seventeenth-century Bazylika Świętego Krzyża, where the literal heart of Frederic Chopin has remained since 1882; and finally the nineteenth-century Pałac Czetwertyńskich-Uruskich, which had been destroyed in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 and rebuilt three years later as part of the University of Warsaw.\n\nKrakowskie Przedmieście in On the Silver Globe, c.1987\n\nThis shot was not intended to appear in the original film, and is one of several pieces of improvised footage used to fill in narrative portions that were never filmed due to the Polish authorities’ halting of the production in 1977 (the improvised footage also offsets the city’s most recognizable work of communist architecture, the Pałac Kultury i Nauki, with interiors of churches and theater venues). One can also understand this shot as allegorical in that, to paraphrase Jameson, it is rhizomatic, functioning to reveal a structure of multiple meanings, and implies the need with modern allegory to include the problem of representation in its own structure.\n\nŻuławski explored romantyzm indirectly as a film subject in The Blue Note, set in 1847 at the remote Nohant château owned by George Sand (Marie-France Pisier), and featuring an ensemble of artists, authors, composers, politicians, and so on, including composer Frédéric Chopin (Janusz Olejniczak), Sand’s children Solange and Maurice (Sophie Marceau and Benoît Lepecq), her cousin Augustine Brault, sculptor Auguste Clésinger, Warsaw noblewoman and socialite Laura Czosnowska, painter Eugène Delacroix, authors Alexandre Dumas the Younger and Ivan Turgenev, soldier and political advisor Wojciech Grzymała, soprano Pauline Garcia-Viardot, and art historian and critic Louis Viardot, her husband. The director would later even reminisce of the production in romantic terms: The film was shot in the summer of 1990 at the remote Château de Puyval in the south of France, which was owned by the relative of a Polish immigrant who occupied it at the time of Poland’s November Uprising of 1830, and which contained a letter from composer Ignacy Paderewski describing how Chopin had once performed there. Prior to shooting, the crew allegedly discovered three Pleyel et Cie pianos -the kind Chopin himself played- covered in cobwebs inside the château. It was also at a similarly remote villa outside of Warsaw in 1956 where a fifteen-year-old Żuławski in his words fell in love with a girl named Ewa Tuwim, who introduced him to the music of Chopin.\n\nThe academic division of Romantic movements by nationality also implies civic pride, but more relevantly harbors an implicit political conflict. One thing that distinguished the Romantic movement in Poland was explicit political conflict, specifically that between the Grand Duchy of Poland-Lithuania and the Russian Empire in the early nineteenth century. Since the last decade of the eighteenth century, when the Grand Duchy had been partitioned across Russia, Prussia, and Austria, the resulting loss of country and feeling of rootlessness and isolation have often been viewed as being at the center of Polish Romantic thought. In this sense, Żuławski’s so-called ‘Polish Trio’ -comprised of The Devil, On the Silver Globe, and Trzecia część nocy (The Third Part of the Night, 1971)- indirectly depicts misgivings about a Polish government complicit with occupying forces, what Leszek Kolakowski called “self-exile.”\n\nSuch changes in subjectivity inevitably accompany historical changes in social conditions brought about by the partitions, and the literature produced in the 1830s represents a response to them -an unconscious cognitive mapping of the subject’s response to the collective social structure with which the subject is presented. Poland, once the largest territorial state in Europe, was by 1795 divided by three empires. The historical narrative that developed in Poland throughout the nineteenth century maintains that the partitions were a blow to the national consciousness, and reinforced the national resolve to retain a ‘Polish’ identity. The nation thus looked to its so-called trzej wieszcze (literally “three prophets,” commonly referred to in English as the “three bards”) -Adam Mickiewicz, Julius Słowacki, and Zygmunt Krasiński- not solely for the preservation of literary tradition and language, but also political guidance. The preservation or erasure of “Polish” national identity vis-a-vis that of another nationality manifests itself in Kolakowski’s exiled settings, such as Sand’s château at Nohant. While scouting the château to film The Blue Note, the filmmakers found that the site, now the George Sand Museum, had eliminated nearly all of the content indicating that Chopin had lived and worked there in the 1840s, despite being at his most productive at the time, and stated that the production could not portray Sand in a negative light (which Żuławski’s film does on a routine basis). This was, according to Żuławski, an ideological maneuver on the part of the French. From these, the notion of an artistic summa of one’s experience of exile and occupation -through the Romantic template- emerges.\n\nIn that regard, the premise of this article is not necessarily new, nor it is the first to view Zuławski’s cinema through a Romanticist lens. Writing in 2012, Boczkowska connected Chopin’s psyche with physical alienation through the portrayal of puppetry in The Blue Note, citing events in the film as an instance of Chopin’s emigre-psychology having been appropriated by contemporary culture “…as a means for Poles to mourn their nation’s painful history.” Marcin’s 2016 study of The Devil explored the film’s presentation of contemporary history though deliberate references to the Romantics’ preoccupation with gnosticism in the late eighteenth century. Further, the notion of romantyzm may not be conducive to an understanding of Żuławski’s oeuvre by necessity, given that a hallmark of the director’s output, particularly that in Western Europe, was his privileging of woman protagonists, notably those of L’important c’est d’aimer (That Most Important Thing: Love, 1975), Possession (1981), La femme publique (The Public Woman, 1984), and L’amour braque (1985). Unlike the majority of films in Żuławski’s oeuvre, the “Polish Trio” tends to focus on the plights of men -Michal in The Third Part of the Night, Jakub in The Devil, and Marek in On the Silver Globe– and largely render women as peripheral and in some instances apparitions. This is in keeping with the Romantic tradition in Poland, and as Ostrowska described in 2012, the appearance of a doppelgänger in The Third Part of the Night -wherein Michal sees his murdered wife’s double- alludes to the male protagonist’s solipsism by undermining the reality of his wife’s existence and death. Thus, to contextualize Żuławski’s cinema as a whole in this way is not without its limitations.\n\nNevertheless, The Devil presents the viewer with what is arguably Żulawski’s most Romantic of protagonists. Set in the Prussian Partition of Poland in the fall of 1793, Żuławski’s film follows Jakub (Leszek Teleszynski), who has been imprisoned in a mental asylum for attempting to “assassinate the Tsar.” Though the monarch of the Russian Empire throughout the partitions was Catherine II of Russia, Żuławski’s film refers to a nameless “Tsar” in the same manner as Słowacki’s Kordian (1834), which refer to Catherine II by name but not Nicholas I, who was Tsar at the time of the play’s writing. In its way, the film picks up where Kordian left off -with the protagonist attempting to assassinate the Tsar- but also takes its cue from the third part of Mickiewicz’s Dziady (Forefathers Eve, 1822), set in a monastery that has been converted into a prison where incarcerated characters -one of them coincidentally named Jakub- talk of Tsarist spies among them. Enter an unnamed figure (Wojciech Pszoniak), who identifies himself as a cleric but who the film implies is the titular devil and later reveals to be a Prussian spy. The man frees Jakub, who, accompanied by an unnamed nun (Monika Niemczyk), subsequently encounters his former fiancée (Malgorzata Braunek) now engaged to a count (Maciej Englert), both also unnamed, revisits his childhood home, and kills several people -all perhaps under the proxy control of the cleric- while traveling through the Polish countryside somewhere between the towns of Gdansk, Poznań, and Toruń.\n\nThe Devil originates in a short story of the same name written by Żuławski sometime around 1968-1969, which was only subsequently published in 1994 in a collection, Piekielnicy, together with his Casanova (1972), Sinobrody (Bluebeard, 1974) and Moliwda (1979). In most cases the stories have metonymic titles in that they refer to a minor character who manipulates the protagonist: the cleric in The Devil or the Polish prince in Casanova -and one is left, in Jakub, with a protagonist largely subject to greater sociopolitical forces. Due in part to this, the semiotic or allegorical function of the film’s subject is one of a vector of nearly two centuries of Polish history and historiography. Modern instances of romantyzm since the early twentieth century (coinciding with the arrival of popular cinema in Poland) were conceptions of the country’s own history, which took shape in no small part as a history of its “great authors.” That same history is as well in part a history of the gradual dissolution of that state from the tail end of the eighteenth century (the partitions of the 1790s) to the middle twentieth century (through World War II). For centuries before, Poland had been a multinational state (Poles, Ruhenes, Jews, Lithuanians, and others) and by the end of the second World War was considered a monoethnic country: historical conceptions of ‘Poland’ followed suit, shifting from a ‘chronicle’ of a relatively diverse nation to one of a ‘teachable’ (and exploitable) subject meant to coincide with mid-twentieth-century political thinking.\n\nThe teaching of “great” Polish literature was a part of this program. Codified readings of Mickiewicz and Słowacki became commonplace in school curricula for instance, the heroic figures in their Pan Tadeusz (1834) and Kordian, respectively, became ubiquitous and immediately recognizable by the Polish public, and descriptors such as pantadeuszowych or kordianowskich became colloquial in the literary tradition. Thus the premise of Żuławski having read Pan Tadeusz or Kordian (he had in fact read the latter several times) ostensibly considering them classics alongside the works of Goethe or Dante, and alluding to them in his films is neither farfetched in his Polish productions nor necessarily unique when applied to much of Polish cinema at large. Likewise, Chopin was endorsed by the communist regime in Poland as a national hero (as part of the education of the Polish public) for having introduced Polish peasant music into classical music. One must also bear in mind that the development of allegory itself as a pedagogical tool in teaching literature coincides with the arrival of that literature into school curricula. This was in essence a platform for establishing Jameson’s political unconscious among Polish students of letters. In their allusions to ancient kings of Lithuania, French and Polish military leaders, historical events past and contemporary relating to the liberation of the Grand Duchy from foreign occupation, the works of Mickiewicz and Słowacki function as socially symbolic acts.\n\nFrederic Chopin reading Mickiewicz’s Oda do młodości (Ode to Youth, 1820) in Młodość Chopina (Young Chopin, Aleksandr Ford, 1952)\n\nNor was that implicit political content lost on nineteenth-century audiences. During performances of Słowacki’s Balladyna -about the rise to power of a Slavic queen through deceit and murder- for instance, audiences were certainly aware of the play’s political undertones -through its portrayal of the diminished state of the kingdom of Poland under partitions- and it was for this reason that the play was banned in the Russian partition. Żuławski’s fiction follows a similar analogical line. Moliwda is set in the eighteenth century and follows fictionalized versions of historical figures Jakub Frank and Anton Kossakowski, and has been interpreted as both semi-autobiographical of Żuławski’s experience of his own time and an analog between the sociopolitical milieux of the late eighteenth and twentieth centuries. Moliwda also contains narrative conceits similar to that of The Devil, the most glaring being that the title of Żuławski’s Moliwda refers to Kossakowski, known colloquially as Moliwda, though he is a minor character relative to Jakub, a religious charlatan portrayed as a precursor to numerous twentieth-century leaders.\n\nThis also coincides with the emergence of theater in Poland after the first cultural “thaw” throughout the Soviet Union and its satellite states beginning in 1956, as it was assumed by most Poles throughout the early 1960s that one couldn’t adequately consume theater in their country without a thorough knowledge of its “great authors” -classic (Mickiewicz, Słowacki, et al) and contemporary (Wyspianski, Witkiewicz, et al). The works of the Romantics were also subject to avant-garde productions, and were often used as a cypher for contemporary ideas, as contemporary Poles of all political persuasions at various times superimposed their ideas on these texts. This was especially true of Tadeusz Kantor’s production of Słowacki’s Balladyna in the 1940s, and Grotowski’s 1965 production of Kordian in Wroclaw. Kazimierz Dejmek’s 1968 production of Forefathers’ Eve in Warsaw presented such a criticism of the Russian influence on Polish life that the government closed the production after two months, running from November 1968 to January 1969 and presaging what would eventually happen to The Devil in 1972.\n\nRomantyzm is also distinguished in that it was centered partially around religious imagination, both in terms of organized religion as an institution and of a ‘religious feeling’ as it might appear in Mickiewicz, Słowacki, or others. This will often coincide with the notion of political resistance -and by extension, nationalist sensibility- in Żuławski’s cinema as it pertains to the portrayal of religion. Romantic works in Poland from after 1830 were considered vatic literature -often referred to as “Polish Messianism” as elaborated by philosopher and mystic Andrzej Towiański- which portrayed Poland as the “Christ of Europe” that would eventually “resurrect” itself to freedom. Vestigal traces of Catholic imagery are seen throughout Żuławski’s cinema, which like Mickiewicz’s and Słowacki’s own religiosity was often at odds with Catholicism: it is in the second act of Forefathers Eve where a guslarz performs the pagan ritual of Dziady, known also in Polish as Uczta kozła (“Feast of the Goat”), where by eating, drinking, and performing music, one is thought to bring relief to souls in purgatory. This portion of the play is thought to reference the sect of Towiański in its depiction of the eponymous ritual. Though Żuławski remained ambivalent about religion, one might align his spiritual affiliation in part with the theater of Jerzy Grotowski. Relevant to the strain of romantyzm in Żuławski’s cinema is the theme of the action or deed, which was codified by Catholicism and appears in both Mickiewicz and Grotowski.\n\nEye of Providence (Daniel Niklaus Chodowiecki, 1787)\n\nEye of Providence in The Third Part of the Night (1971)\n\nEye of Providence in Cosmos (2015)\n\nVarious descriptions of Grotowski’s theater liken it to a Romantic return to a state of nature and/or describe it in romanticized terms, largely due to how the process is not necessarily an ‘intellectual’ or articulable one. One of Grotowski’s first students, Eugenio Barba, described the use of a fictional character as a vector to address his or her own self: “…the tool to reach secret layers of his personality and strip himself of what hurts most and lies deepest in his secret heart.” A possible motivation (again thinking of ‘motivation’ in the Jamesonian sense of an artist and his/her text as both the products of and response to social, political, and economic circumstances) for Żuławski to instill this particular strain into his early films is perhaps rooted in the plight of Grotowski. A passage from a 1962 review of Grotowski’s production of Wyspianski’s Akropolis alludes to such a response to those circumstances: “Like all the great classical tragedies, Mickiewicz, Slowacki, Wyspianski have expressed the secret torment of their people and of their times. But their poetic works were created within very specific historical conditions which act as a shell, which eventually destroy the freshness and vitality of their words. By placing these dramas in the past we forget that they are the summation of collective ancestral experiences. These experiences are precisely what we want to put to the test.” By the end of Kordian, the protagonist attempts an assassination but is deemed sane by the state and executed. In Grotowski’s 1965 production of the play at Wroclaw, Kordian is insane, while audience and performers alike are placed together in a mental asylum. The Devil takes its cue from both: Żuławski’s film opens with Andrzej Jaroszewicz’s camera following the cleric, who is able to enter a mental asylum and fetch Jakub unnoticed due to the mayhem of Prussian troops storming through.\n\nJerzy Grotowski’s production of Kordian (1965)\n\nThe asylum in The Devil (1972)\n\nOne might also notice several superficial similarities between the biographies of the Romantics and Żuławski. Mickiewicz’s father was a member of the szlachta, the nobility under the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, while Słowacki was born in Krzemieniec, a cultural center that at the time rivaled Vilnius. Żuławski was born in Lwow to a prominent line of Polish artists and intellectuals. All three men were well-traveled (under various circumstances) and all lived in Paris for a time. Mickiewicz traveled to Berlin, Weimar, Prague, Rome, and Geneva, meeting both Hegel and Goethe. An admirer of Lord Byron, Słowacki followed in his footsteps by traveling to Greece, Egypt, and Palestine. Prior to leaving Poland in the 1970s, Żuławski’s father Mirosław, a diplomat, moved the family between Paris, Prague, and Warsaw, while the production of On the Silver Globe led the director to the Gobi Desert and the Caucasus Mountains. These travels are in the tradition of the “Grand Tour” carried out by members of European aristocracy, yet are inverted by their homeland’s subjugation by a foreign power and self-exile. A poetic aside by Chopin in The Blue Note alludes to as much: “I’m heading towards death, and I’m still full of music. I can’t remember any Polish landscapes.” Chopin’s homeland, which at this point exists only in his memory, is fading figuratively and literally. There is also parity of course between Żuławski’s life after the 1970s and that of Chopin after 1830: both born in Poland, and both immigrated to France due to political circumstances.\n\nIn a strictly narrative sense, the similarities between The Devil and the works of Mickiewicz and Słowacki are numerous. The protagonists of Mickiewicz, Słowacki, and Żuławski are often wanderers, inert and directionless, and their adventures suit them. The narrative structure of The Devil is by definition a phantasmagoria: like Mickiewicz’s Tadeusz, Jakub wanders through the countryside encountering different characters and grotesques: from the asylum, to the theater troupe in the woods, to the wedding, to his father’s house, to the brothel, and so on. Kordian particularly at once longs to ‘conquer’ or control the world and is aware of his own smallness and insignificance relative to it. Several commonalities exist between Żuławski’s dialogue and the prose of Mickiewicz or Słowacki in that their characters prefer figurative meanings to literal ones. Consider an exchange between Chopin and Pauline towards the top of The Blue Note (“Is it true that I smell?”/“You smell of grace.”) or an exchange between Delacroix and Chopin toward the end (“What do you play for us now?”/“The prayer of a distraught Pole.”).\n\nDialogues such as these appear of course across all of Żuławski’s filmography, and will typically function in a similar way -the statements’ connotations being more important than their denotations. Jakub’s speech in The Devil suggests a regression into childhood and youth, while Solange’s body language in The Blue Note suggests that of a small girl rather than an adult woman. One sees similar returns to youth in both Pan Tadeusz and The Devil with the protagonist literally returning to his childhood home. This by implication might suggest the longing for a past political state, now reduced to walls and ruins:\n\nDawno domu nie widział, bo w dalekiem mieście\n\nKończył nauki, końca doczekał nareszcie.\n\nWbiega i okiem chciwie ściany starodawne\n\nOglada czule, jako swe znajome dawne.\n\nHe had not seen his home in a long time, since in a distant city\n\nhe had finished his studies, lived to see the end.\n\nHe runs inside and looks at the ancient walls\n\nas fondly he would old friends.\n\nJakub returning to the castle ruins in The Devil\n\nThe theater troupe depicted in The Devil performs Act 3, Scene 4 from Hamlet, where the ghost visits Hamlet and Gertrude, delivering a speech pertaining to how easy it is to deceive the feeble-minded (“Conceit in the weakest bodies strongest works”). This sends Jakub to the castle to reclaim his former fiancée, and upon seeing this, the count attempts to execute Jakub -literally on a cross- but in the end cannot do it. It is in this scene where the film reveals the count as a former co-conspirator against the Tsar and his complacency with the new government. The parallels between the character of Jakub and the titular heroes of William Shakespeare’s tragedies Hamlet and Macbeth are immediately noticeable. The film arguably draws these parallels, however, by proxy -specifically through Kordian and Balladyna. Żuławski has referenced Kordian while talking about The Devil, describing how in the film, the titular subject dismantles a conspiracy with the help of a mentally weak man “…who fainted, like Kordian, on the doorstep.” Further, Balladyna borrows heavily from Macbeth in its depiction of the death of a king by a woman and a conspirator, and the later appearance of the victim’s ghost. The image of a subject pondering a gravesite appears in Kordian and Słowacki’s poem Na szczycie piramid (On the Top of the Pyramids, 1836) -the latter taking place from atop a hill. Jakub and his brother Ezekiel carry their dead father up a hill to bury him in The Devil. Unlike those in Hamlet, however, these scenes are politically charged -the pondering of ones own demise equated with the political demise of one’s homeland. During this scene, Ezekiel describes the military exploits of their father: “He rose under banners depicting the Holy Virgin to expel foreign troops from Poland, rout them and eliminate all that wasn’t Polish.” Ezekiel was raised to be a “patriot,” Jakub to not engage in conflict.\n\nGhosts also seem to appear in The Blue Note. The inexplicable arrival of brightly colored apparitions in the château’s library, in the trees by the river, and elsewhere -unseen by the characters- suggests the presence of ghosts, which Chopin claimed to have seen prior to Nohant. These figures’ physical appearance -humanoid, draped in maroon and white, some walking on stilts- are based on paintings by Maurice Sand, who in turn based them on various legends of the Berry region of France. With the appearance in the film’s final moments of a minotaur-like figure credited as espirit de feu, the apparitions take on a mythological quality, which was commonplace in Mickiewicz and Słowacki, as Pan Tadeusz often recalls medieval Lithuanian mythology. The appearance of Demogorgon -presenting as a Greek satyr- and of Corambé, a sexless mythological figure of George Sand’s design, also suggest the divine interventions at the beginning of Kordian and encounters with anthropomorphic birds and the spirits of children in the second act of Forefathers Eve. Likewise, in the original script for The Devil, the titular character at first did not appear human, but had a grotesque face (at one point in production they attempted to construct a mask) and was later revealed to be a man.\n\nDemogorgon and Corambé in The Blue Note (1991)\n\nIdeologically, The Devil follows the same allegorical template used by the Polish Romantics. Consider Słowacki’s unfinished Horsztyński (1835), which is set in Lithuania during the Kosciuszko Uprising of 1794. Szczęsny, the liberal Jacobin son of the titular character, is at odds with his father, who is a spy for Catherine II. Just as a espionage was the impetus for Horsztyński, so was the case for The Devil. It has been well-documented previously that what takes place in The Devil functions as an analog for then-recent events in Poland -specifically the March 1968 university student demonstrations in Warsaw and Krakow. One could describe Żuławski’s film in allegorical terms as an amplification -a primary narrative that correlates with a secondary narrative that the viewer is meant to construe as the first’s “meaning.” The film thus represents, in Żuławski’s words, a form of resistance to the state, employing allegory and inferring political struggle when seen through the prism of the Romantic strain. This also establishes an intertextual relationship to the nineteenth-century texts: The film’s depiction of invasion and partition is taken to mirror the supposedly “Anti-Zionist” policies introduced by Secretary Władysław Gomułka, which was a cover for state-sponsored Anti-Semitism resulting in the displacement of approximately 13,000 Poles with Jewish lineage. The political setting in Poland in the mid-twentieth century lays part of the groundwork for how one might parlay a political statement in fiction to the nation’s Romantic literary tradition, vis-a-vis the emergence of “counter-culture” literature in the United States, for example. Prussian spycraft among Poles in The Devil similarly mirrors the movements of informants within the student population in 1968 (coincidentally, there were rumors of Wojciech Pszoniak having been a Party informant during these demonstrations).\n\nThe notion of the sublime, famously proposed by Edmund Burke in 1757 -being an experience of simultaneous joy and terror at the natural world (by way of an “image” of the natural world viewed from a safe distance), and becoming a collapse of one’s perception of reality and one’s imagination- has become something of a hallmark of the Romantic mode of feeling. However, one of the distinguishing characteristics of romantzym, according to Stanisz, is an explicit divide between perception and imagination -the image of the world observed “entering” the mind of the subject and alienating him further from it once he has realized that the observed world does not live up to the one imagined. In a letter from 1836, Słowacki describes being underwhelmed at the first sight of the Pyramids at Giza:\n\n…piramidy nie tak mnie zachwycily ogromem…Widzialem…piramidy, ale za to stracilem obraz, który sobie moja imaginacja o nich tworzyla.\n\n…I saw the pyramids but at once lost the picture of them that I had had in my imagination.\n\nIn their longer works, Mickiewicz and Słowacki often expressed this divide through the analogical use of plant and fruit imagery -the idea of something never “bearing fruit” due to the literal and figurative damage done to the “soil.” Pan Tadeusz contains a passage equating wild mushrooms with soldiers being led to war, a reminiscence by the protagonist of the forests and botanic garden of Vilnius, and a description of foliage and berries in the “glorious Lithuanian wood.” Both Mickiewicz and Słowacki develop analogies between imagery of flowers and food and the state of the land. A passage from Pan Tadeusz reads:\n\nZbudził Hrabiego szelest na plecach i skroni;\n\nBył to bernardyn, kwestarz Robak, a miał w dłoni\n\nPodniesione do góry węzłowate sznurki;\n\n<<Ogórków chcesz Waść? krzyknał, oto masz ogórki.\n\nWara, Panie, od szkody, na tutejszej grzędzie\n\nNie dla Waszeci owoc, nic z tego nie będzie>>.\n\nThe Count awoke to a rustling on his back and temples\n\nIt was the Bernardine, Robak, and in his hand\n\nWere knotted cords, raised up;\n\n“Do you want to grow cucumbers?” he cried. “Here you have cucumbers.\n\nBeware, my lord, of the damage to the roost here\n\nNo fruit for you, nothing will come of it.”\n\nLikewise, a passage from Kordian’s opening monologue reads:\n\nIdą trzody po trawie chrzęszczącéj od szronu,\n\nI obracają głowy na niebo pobladłe,\n\nJakby pytały nieba: gdzie kwiaty opadłe?\n\nGdzie są kwitnące maki po wstęgach zagonu?\n\nThe flock treads the grass brittle with snow\n\nAnd turns its head towards the pale white sky,\n\nAs if to ask the heavens: Where have the flowers fallen?\n\nWhere are the blooming poppies from the flowerbed?\n\nVestiges of this appear late in The Devil, when Jakub has been reunited with the nun after snow has begun to fall. The nun delivers a monologue, almost with a poet’s cadence and pentameter: “It’s blackberries. So many blackberries. Are you not hungry?” Jakub responds: “There are no blackberries here. It is winter.” While the exchange has religious connotations -the blackberry bush that broke Satan’s fall after being cast out of heaven- an allusion to a displaced nation comes through via a relatively simple analogy. The change of seasons’ effect on the landscape’s flora being analogous to the change of regimes on a nation’s spiritual state. This is followed by a kind of soliloquy suggesting that fate brought her and Jakub together, explicating the analogy of blackberries, given that he could not bring himself to kill the Tsar: “Now we are together…for the murderers, the insane, for those filled with rage…who want to rid themselves of the burden of injustice…for the proud, the humiliated, for those who cause bloodshed, for the weak, downtrodden, and helpless…for the murderers and the criminals.” Speech in Kordian -highly associative and suggesting more the characters’ attitudes toward reality or the nature of the world in their mind- such as a dialogue between its protagonist and the devil (disguised as a doctor) reads like a typical exchange between any two Żuławski’s characters:\n\nDoktor: Mały kryształ powietrza, w którym pluszczesz skrzelą, / Jest wszystkiém, a świat cały nicości topielą.\n\nKordian: Myślę.\n\nDoktor: Więc świat jest myślą twoją.\n\nKordian: Cierpię.\n\nDoktor: Nie myśl.\n\nKordian: Nie mogę…\n\nDoktor: Możesz, sposób niemyślenia przemyśl[…]\n\nDoctor: This crystal sphere of air in which you play, / The entire world drowns in nothingness.\n\nKordian: I think.\n\nDoctor: Thus the world is your thought.\n\nKordian: I suffer.\n\nDoctor: Then don’t think!\n\nKordian: But I can’t…\n\nDoctor: You can, think of no longer thinking […]\n\nThe nun in The Devil\n\nFinally, Żuławski’s associative use of color through visual language operates in a manner similar to Mickiewicz’s prose. In the final scenes of The Blue Note, Chopin and Solange recite the opening stanza, truncated, of Pan Tadeusz, first in Polish, then in French:\n\nLitwo! Ojczyzno moja! ty jestés jak zdrowie;\n\nIle cię trzeba cenić, ten tylko się dowie,\n\nKto cię stracił.\n\n[…]\n\nTak nas powrócisz cudem na Ojczyny łono.\n\nTymczasem przenoś moję duszę utęskniona\n\nDo tych pagórków leśnych, do tych lak zielonych,\n\nSzeroko nad błękitnym Niemnem rozciagnionych;\n\nDo tych pól malowanych zbożem rozmaitem,\n\nWyzłacanych pszenica, posrebrzanych żytem;\n\nGdzie bursztynowy świerzop, gryka jak śnieg biała,\n\nGdzie panieńskim rumieńcem dzięcielina pała,\n\nThe closing scenes of The Blue Note employ color in the same manner as the opening of Mickiewicz’s poem. Pan Tadeusz describes the Lithuanian landscape as literal fields “painted” with grains -green meadows, the blue of the Nemunas River, silver rye, buckwheat that is “white as snow”- while a gratuitous array of color appears throughout the final act of The Blue Note. Colors in Żuławski’s film exist primarily as figurative color fields, however, with entire scenes lit by an unnatural tinted light: the red wallpaper and haze in the parlor at Nohant, and the green and blue tint of its corridors.\n\nThis is not to suggest a closed system in which colors ‘signify’ something else by necessity, aside perhaps from what the characters imply through dialogue: George Sand equates a “blue note” with a “final” note arriving at a narrative end, suggesting Chopin’s lifetime as a linear narrative that will end with his demise. One could interpret the color blue then as a rare instance of a visual metaphor -which in film texts do not arguably exist- as opposed to a metonymy, the color indicating an arbitrary association between itself and a finishing point. Reconsider then the color red. The red-tinted light outside the château, by contrast, literally signifies a fire, perhaps allegorical for military conflict, as Grzymała refers to the color figuratively as “la guerre,” and finally the appearance of the esprit de feu. The Blue Note was to originally end with Nohant burning to the ground in a fire, as the narrative arcs between the protagonist and his father end in The Third Part of the Night and The Devil. This ending was never filmed due to production costs, and thus the color red becomes elusive, suggesting the destruction of the walls that create the protagonist’s exile. But what is implied and unrealized in The Blue Note is explicated in The Devil, with the fire carrying a distinct political charge. The viewer sees Jakub torching the house with a burning banner of the Marszałkowie Polski (“Marshal of Poland”), which was the country’s highest military rank from 1920 to 1963 and anachronistic for a film set in 1793.\n\nRed-tinted light in The Blue Note\n\nBurning the house with the flag in The Devil\n\nThe subjects of The Devil and The Blue Note are portrayed, then, as the permutational subjects of various institutions, the former operating in the ‘coded’ creative language under a communist government and the latter operating in an open market that had historically welcomed emigre directors. This is anathema to the notion of a singular artist working inside an insular system of his own design, which is in itself a western Romantic notion that developed out of the fir"
