        "text": "Eric San Juan was the editor-in-chief for a family of weekly newspapers in New Jersey for more than a decade and was cohost of the Year of Hitchcock podcast. He is the author of Stuff Every Husband Should Know (2011) and the coauthor of A Year of Hitchcock: 52 Weeks with the Master of Suspense (Scarecrow, 2011) and Hitchcock’s Villains: Murderers, Mothers, and Maniac Issues (Scarecrow, 2013).\n\nAkira Kurosawa’s films are examined in detail in this enjoyable overview of the renowned director’s career from San Juan (Hitchcock’s Villains). Focusing on Kurosawa’s themes rather than his techniques, San Juan readily succeeds in his goal of creating an accessible appreciation of Kurosawa’s work. . . . Many of the tales from Kurosawa’s life, particularly regarding his relationships with his actors—including his master-pupil relationship with star Toshiro Mifune and long marriage to actress Yoko Yaguchi—are so intriguing that readers will wish this were a full biography. . . . This guide to a master filmmaker’s work has appeal for cinephiles and casual movie viewers alike.\n\n— Publishers Weekly\n\nThe book is easy and pleasant to read, covers a lot of ground, and gives the reader an excellent foundation from which to better understand Kurosawa’s works. You need neither a film studies degree nor an understanding of Japanese culture to understand what is being said. The book should work very well for its intended audience. . . . Akira Kurosawa: A Viewer’s Guide is a very well written, welcome book that fills a space that has existed for a while in English language Kurosawa bibliography. Get the book if you are new to Kurosawa, or get it as a gift for someone who you think would be into Kurosawa if pushed a little into that direction.\n\n— Akirakurosawa.info"
