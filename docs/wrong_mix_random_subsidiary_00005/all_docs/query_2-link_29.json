And as these factions vie for control over the remnants of the Empire, a girl named Sheeana rises to prominence in the wastelands of Rakis, sending religious fervor throughout the galaxy. For she possesses the abilities of the Fremen sandriders—fulfilling a prophecy foretold by the late God Emperor....\n\nAuthor: Frank Herbert\n\nSeries: Dune Book 5\n\nPublisher: Ace Books\n\nMASS MARKET PAPERBACK\n\nPages: 688pp\n\nSize: 4.25 x 7.5 x 1\n\nRelease Date: June 4, 2019\n\nISBN: 978-0593098264"
