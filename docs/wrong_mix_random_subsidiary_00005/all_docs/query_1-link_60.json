        "text": "\"This is an informative, intelligent and carefully considered study of one of the greatest actor-director teams in the history of cinema, a creative partnership that equaled Ford and Wayne or Léaud and Truffaut. If you have any interest whatsoever in the work of Kurosawa in particular or Japanese cinema in general, The Emperor and the Wolf is a must read.\" --Martin Scorsese\n\n\"This fascinating chronicle of two intertwined lives, filled with new information and informed enthusiasm, is by far the best popular account of an important director and his finest actor.\" --Donald Richie, author of The Films of Akira Kurosawa\n\n\"The Emperor and the Wolf is a terrific book, and long overdue: a well-researched study of how a great director and a great actor fired each other up; an informative history of how high profile Japanese films were received at home and abroad; a surprising genealogy of the modern action hero; and a fresh look at sixteen Kurosawa movies-at least six of them all-time classics. I've seen the ronin trilogy Seven Samurai, Yojimbo and Sanjuro more often than is probably good for me. But this double biography has revealed new layers of meaning in them. So I suppose I'll just have to see them all over again . . .\" --Christopher Frayling, author of Sergio Leone: Something to do with Death"
