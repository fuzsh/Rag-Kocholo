        "text": "Mino Raiola is possibly the most famous ‘super-agent’ in football, and could be involved in three of the biggest transfers in the world next summer.\n\nHaving overseen and even arranged the careers of some of football’s biggest superstars such as Paul Pogba, Erling Haaland, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and many more, he is one of the most influential men in global football.\n\nThe Swedish agent is often regarded as being one of the toughest negotiators in the whole of sport, as he has a history of being able to make or break any potential transfer deal.\n\nHe is the one who convinced Borussia Dortmund to insert the £68m release clause into Erling Haaland’s contract, which will more than likely see the Norwegian depart the club.\n\nThe mercurial forward is possibly the hottest property in football, having scored a mind-blowing 68 goals in 67 appearances for the German giants in all competitions.\n\nClubs were even queuing up around the door to sign him this summer, with Chelsea expressing the biggest interest in him despite the fact he would have cost almost three times as much as his buy-out clause.\n\nHowever, Dortmund were adamant he would stay and he continues to thrill and pummel the opposition’s goal at the Signal Iduna Park.\n\nThe release clause has also appeared to be one of Raiola’s specialities.\n\nThe future of Matthijs De Ligt has also been thrust into the transfer spotlight with knowledge of his release clause at Juventus becoming prominent.\n\nStanding at a humongous £128m, the 22-year-old will be able to walk away from the Allianz Arena if a club pays the fee to break him out of his contract, according to Fabrizio Romano.\n\nWho will Pogba, Haaland, and De Ligt be playing for next season? Comment below\n\nIt will be enacted at the start of next season, and Massimiliano Allegri’s side may have to start bracing themselves for offers and phone calls from the game’s biggest teams.\n\nRaiola will also be front and centre of contract negotiations with Manchester United if they decide to offer midfield general Pogba a new deal.\n\nThe Frenchman will be free to walk away from the club for free next summer when his current contract with the club expires, unless the Red Devils negotiate a new contract with Raiola and Pogba.\n\nBut, it will likely come at an enormous price with reports from The Sun stating he would need to be paid around £400,000 per week if he was to pen his future to the club.\n\nHowever, the imperious Haaland, the dynamic De Ligt, and the classy Pogba are just three of Raiola’s 73 competing players he looks after.\n\nRaiola also has two managers and coaches under his guidance, with former Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur manager Martin Jol, and current Feyenoord manager Arne Slot.\n\nMany of Raiola’s clients are promising youngsters, he feels could soon become global superstars within the next few seasons.\n\nHe is very strategic in who he decides to work with and look after, often choosing to approach players while they are still in their early stages.\n\nHere’s a complete list of every Raiola client currently playing.\n\n1.
