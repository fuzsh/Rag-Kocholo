        "text": "Hellas Verona came from behind to stun Napoli with a 3-1 home win on Sunday despite Hirving Lozano having scored the visitors’ fastest-ever Serie A goal after nine seconds.\n\nThe Mexican winger pounced on a missed clearance by Federico Dimarco to fire into the net moments after kick-off.\n\nClocked at 8.95 seconds, it was the third-fastest goal in Serie A history after Rafael Leao’s strike for AC Milan against Sassuolo in 2020 (6.8 seconds) and former Piacenza striker Paolo Poggi’s goal versus Fiorentina in 2001 (8.9).\n\nALSO READ | FA Cup: Chelsea, Leicester beat second-tier clubs\n\nHowever, Napoli could not make its early advantage count and Dimarco made up for his earlier error by tucking in a Davide Faraoni cross to equalise in the 34th minute.\n\nVerona completed the turnaround with an Antonin Barak strike after 62 minutes and Mattia Zaccagni header 11 minutes from time to secure a victory that compounded Napoli’s misery following its midweek Italian Super Cup defeat by Juventus.\n\nNapoli is sixth with 34 points from 18 matches, nine behind league leaders AC Milan but with a game in hand, while Verona are 10th on 30 points from 19 matches."
