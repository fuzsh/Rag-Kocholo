The current list of awarded certificates is (click on the badges to see the papers with the certification):\n\nFeatured This certification may be awarded to papers that are very high quality. These papers present significant contributions which are novel, clearly explained, and well supported with evidence, theory, or analysis. If this paper was submitted to a top-tier conference, it would likely be presented as an oral/spotlight.\n\nReproducibility This is awarded to papers whose primary purpose is reproduction of other published work. Beyond simple verification, the paper must contribute significant added value through additional baselines, analysis, ablations, or insights.\n\nSurvey The Survey Certificate is awarded to papers that not only meet the criteria for acceptance but also provide an exceptionally thorough or insightful survey of the topic or approach may be awarded this certification.\n\nExpert The Expert Reviewer Certificate is awarded to papers whose authors include at least one TMLR Expert Reviewer.\n\nOutstanding The editorial board of TMLR jointly awards this certification to papers which are deemed to be exceptionally high quality and broadly significant for the field. The certification may be given well after the paper's initial publication in TMLR (a year or more), and is equivalent to a best paper award at a top-tier conference.\n\nEvent TMLR papers that are presented at other conferences."
