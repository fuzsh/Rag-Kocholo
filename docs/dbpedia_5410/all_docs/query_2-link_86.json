One of the more interesting developments is the signing of Paolo Di Canio as the new manager, who has filled in the role vacated by ex Luton Town player Danny Wilson ( I never met brief manager Paul Hart ).\n\nThe results from the day can be see in the current issue of FourFourTwo, most of it was about behind the scene fitness tests and pre season training, I was asked however to get 20 minutes with Paolo to get some portraits. Once I was asked how much time I needed to photograph Ian Wright, and then half it."
