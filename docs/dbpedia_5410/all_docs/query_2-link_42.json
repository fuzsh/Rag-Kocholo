        "text": "In our first review of the statistics which made the 2011/12 season, Ron Smith takes aim at Town goalkeepers Wes Foderingham, Phil Smith and Mattia Lanzano.\n\nIf the 2011/12 season has taught us something we always knew would be true, it’s that quality goalkeepers are actually in short supply. After many years of Talia, Gremink, Lucas and the rest, it seems we’ve found one in Wes Foderingham.\n\nIt took Di Canio until early October to finally admit defeat in his trusted no.1 shirt holder Mattia Lanzano. The unsure, homesick and flapable Italian never looked deserving of the shirt even before his rushed clearance at Burton Albion lead to the Brewer’s second goal. He followed that up with feeble stature, pathetic jumping and poor positioning in his final outing and 3 goals conceded against Hereford United, which gave Paolo enough cause to banish Lanzano from the side.\n\nWith long servant Phil Smith injured and also hardly a universally favoured first choice, the loan signing of Foderingham – for an initial period of 3 months – was a gamble seeing that the youngster had never played a Football League match and his only recent experience was with Bromley, Boreham Wood and Histon in the non-leagues. However Wes was certainly a gamble which paid off, leading Town to convince Palace to part with their ‘keeper in January and the rest is history.\n\nYou don’t really need me to show you the statistics (for all competitions) to prove Foderingham’s superiority, but here you go anyway…\n\nKEY STATS\n\nGames Played\n\nMinutes\n\nConceded\n\nWes Foderingham\n\n41\n\n3690\n\n22\n\nMattia Lanzano\n\n7\n\n578\n\n10\n\nPhil Smith\n\n11\n\n952\n\n13\n\nWith Mattia slowly adjusting to life in England, Phil Smith started the season in goal which culminated with our poor start to the season. Without wishing to single out Smith, he was clearly one of many factors that cost us points, culminating in Phil losing 63.6% of games he featured.\n\nWin %\n\nDraw %\n\nLose %\n\nWes Foderingham\n\n70.8%\n\n14.6%\n\n14.6%\n\nMattia Lanzano\n\n57.1%\n\n14.3%\n\n28.6%\n\nPhil Smith\n\n27.3%\n\n9.1%\n\n63.6%\n\nWes conceded 22 goals in his 41 games, which equates to a goal conceded for every 168 minutes which is nearly two full ninety minutes.\n\nLanzano was the most likely to concede. The Italian ‘stopper’ – using ‘stopper in it’s loosest possible terms – conceded ever 1.4 games / every 58 minutes.\n\nAll three ‘keepers kept clean sheet, including notable shut outs for Lanzano against Southend United and away at Crawley, which culminated in our club and league record clean sheets in the League of 26 in total and 18 as hosts. However, it was ‘Super’ Wes Foderingham who kept the opposition at bay for more than half of his matches, making a total of 24 and a club record six successive clean sheets in the League.\n\nConceded\n\nConceded Per Game\n\nGoal Conceded Every…\n\nClean Sheets\n\nClean Sheet Every…\n\nWes Foderingham\n\n22\n\n0.56\n\n167.7 minutes\n\n24\n\n0.59 games\n\nMattia Lanzano\n\n10\n\n1.43\n\n57.8 minutes\n\n2\n\n0.29 games\n\nPhil Smith\n\n13\n\n1.18\n\n73.2 minutes\n\n3\n\n0.27 games\n\nTurning to the number of shots on target faced by each ‘keeper, Foderingham was the busiest of all three ‘keepers, facing a shot to save every 23 minutes.\n\nIf there’s proof that our defence can take massive credit for the success of Foderingham, allowing him to make so many clean sheets, is the low frequency of shots against compared to last season when Lucas and Smith was called into saving every 19 minutes of football.\n\nMattia Lanzano had the worst save rate of 50% despite being called to face a shot every 29 minutes, meaning Lanzano would actually make a save nearly every 60 minutes of his time on the pitch.\n\nTotal Shots on Target Faced\n\nTotal Saves\n\nShot Faced Every…\n\nSave Every…\n\n% Save Rate\n\nWes Foderingham\n\n158\n\n136\n\n23.4 minutes\n\n27.1 minutes\n\n86.1%\n\nMattia Lanzano\n\n20\n\n10\n\n28.9 minutes\n\n57.8 minutes\n\n50%\n\nPhil Smith\n\n38\n\n25\n\n25.1 minutes\n\n38.1 minutes\n\n65.8%\n\nPhil Smith’s save rate of 65.8% is a marginal improvement over 2010/11 when he kept out 64.9% of the opponent’s shots.\n\nFoderingham’s contribute was immense. His save rate at 86.1% is phenomenal. As a comparison, Shrewsbury had the best percentage save rate in League Two at 82.9%. Town’s in League Two was 81.2%. Foderingham’s save rate in the league only was a massive 89.3%.\n\nFinally, we’ve found a goalkeeper!"
