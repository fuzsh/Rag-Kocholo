        "text": "Sad to announce that I will be leaving Real Madrid C.F. in the upcoming weeks. In these more than 4 years, I have met incredible people and lived unimaginable moments. It has been an honor to be part of the best team in the world in its most glorious stage in history. In these almost 5 seasons, I have experienced the achievement of 3 Champions Leagues and 2 Euroleagues; done 3 Summer Tours traveling with the 1st team all over the world, from China to the USA; been lucky to meet stars like Beckham or Cristiano Ronaldo; visited the HQs of all the social platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter...) and signed groundbreaking deals with them; built the largest brand and sport entity in social media in the world; found innovative ways to incorporate social media throughout the club’s wide array of business units, and helped partners and sponsors (Emirates, adidas...) maximize social media value and opportunities; among many... My next challenge is to pursue an MBA at Columbia Business School in NY during the next 2 years. I leave with the hope of returning back someday and the motivation of being the first ever Real Madrid employee accepted in an M7 Business School MBA directly from the club. I will be eternally grateful to this institution and to my dear digital team. Thank you"
