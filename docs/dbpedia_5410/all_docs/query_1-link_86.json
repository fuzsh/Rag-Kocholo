It is the most balanced game we have played.\"\n\nNapoli, looking for their first win in four league games, moved back into the top four in style with a thrashing of Cagliari.\n\nZielinski gave his side the lead with an arrowing, left-footed strike, before Joao Pedro equalised on the hour mark.\n\nHowever, Zielinski was not done there, and he danced through the home backline two minutes later to put Napoli back in front, with a goal by Hirving Lozano and a penalty from Lorenzo Insigne making the victory more comfortable.\n\nLAZIO STUTTER AGAIN\n\nLazio, having endured a miserable start to the season, had held high hopes of victory at Genoa, who were languishing in the relegation zone at the start of the day.\n\nAfter Ciro Immobile had given this side the lead from the penalty spot in the 15th minute -- his 14th goal in his last 14 games -- Lazio looked set to earn only their second win in six matches in all competitions.\n\nThey could not build on their lead, however, mustering just two further shots on target as Mattia Destro earned Genoa a point in the 58th minute, leaving Lazio ninth in the standings.\n\n\"We had an excellent first half,\" Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi said. \"Unfortunately, we only scored one goal and then we suffered at the start of the second half. We leave here with a lot of disappointment.\"\n\nSerie A surprise package Sassuolo got a rude awakening at Atalanta, who rained in 23 shots in their rampant win, climbing to within a point of their rivals in sixth place in the standings, having played one game fewer.\n\nTorino were another side to win convincingly, 3-0 at Parma, while Fiorentina were held to a disappointing 0-0 draw at home to Bologna.\n\nIn the day's late matches, AC Milan climbed back to the top of the table after a 2-0 win at Benevento, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Juventus beat Udinese 4-1 in Turin.\n\n(Reporting by Peter Hall; editing by Clare Fallon)"
