They are 4th division for a reason. West Ham have had a good look at Powell and so have Bristol City. {Ed003's Note - Good prospect,Powell }\n\n16 Jan 2012 22:02:33\n\nBurton albion have had a 30k bid rejected by Hereford for midfielder Harry Pell\n\n16 Jan 2012 18:08:43\n\nAny Burton Rumours ?\n\nHeard that harry pell of hereford said on twitter he was on his way to burton then removed it\n\n12 Jan 2012 15:18:29\n\nJames McQuilkin to Kidderminster on loan from Hereford with a\n\nview to permanent deal in the summer.\n\n12 Jan 2012 01:41:24\n\nCrawley Town want to sign 4 players this January.\n\nReds boss Steve Evans is looking to conclude deals for ex-loan winger Andy Drury from Ipswich, Grimsby Town forward Liam Hearn, utility man Bilel Mohsni from Southend and finally Leyton Orient wideman Dean Cox.

The rest is a load of rubbish. Only one of two of Evans's signing has ever got out either with Boston or Crawley. Him and Raynor keep things very close to their chest.\n\nDo your trolling somewhere else.\n\n10 Jan 2012 12:25:15\n\nPaul Ince has agreed a deal to become Bristol Rovers Boss .\n\nThe deal is till the end of the season with a 2 year available if Ince keeps Rovers in the Football League\n\nThe Deal Will be Announced tomorrow morning and Ince will be a spectator at tonights relegation clash with Hereford at Edgar St\n\nFormer notts manager is rubbish you will go down with his links in football you would think he could get some good players in to a club but just dos not seem to happen for him\n\nGood Luck - get ready for the conference\n\nBye Bye Rovers,this Joker will wipe you off\n\nthe coupon,scraping the barrel with Ince,\n\nyou,re better than that.\n\nOh dear.....bad luck\n\n10 Jan 2012 09:09:04\n\nOli Johnson to join Swindon - Kerrouche, Bodin, Clarke and Magera to leave this week for Wycombe, Torquay, Chesterfield and Hereford respectively.\n\nDont think Magera will be going agree with the others but Clarke has already gone to Charlton\n\n10 Jan 2012 02:33:27\n\nTarmo Kink is set to join league one side Walsall on loan from Middlesbrough\n\nAndy Halliday is also being sent onto back on loan to league two side Hereford on loan until the end of the season\n\n05 Jan 2012 17:32:32\n\nPortsmouth boss Michael Appleton is keen on bringing three players into Fratton Park as the ambitious former West Brom number two looks towards the top six.\n\nHe is set to raid his old club and bring two faces in. Chilean international defender come midfielder Gonzalo Jara, is in talks over a possible loan move to the South coast after recently being transfer listed by the Premier League outfit.\n\nAnother expected to join is former Celtic striker Marc Antoine Fortune. The striker has recently been on loan at Doncaster and has stated he would like a move to the Championship but not to South Yorkshire.\n\nAppleton is expected to bring in a goalkeeper. It is expected to be experienced stopper Russell Hoult. The Hereford goalkeeper is into his coaching nowadays but Appleton is keen to sign him on a one month rolling contract as well as some time coaching.\n\nWe don't need a keeper or coach!\n\nJara is worth a punt, but dont expect too much from Fortune.\n\n03 Jan 2012 14:29:11\n\nBirmingham City Ins:\n\nPhil Airey-Loan-Newcastle\n\nVince Grella-Loan-Blackburn\n\nJason Koumas-Free Transfer\n\nJimmy Bullard-Loan-Ipswich\n\nBenik Afobe-Loan-Arsenal\n\nOuts:\n\nLiam Ridgewell-£3.2m-Newcastle\n\nNikola Zigic-£4.5m-Santander\n\nFraser Kerr-Loan-Hereford\n\nLuke Hubbins-Loan-Walsall\n\n03 Jan 2012 10:56:04\n\nSwindon set to complete the signing of Cystal Palace goalkeeper Wes Foderingham today for £100,000 + a 40% sell on clause, Wes will sign a 2 and a half year deal today. Di Canio also set to bid for Pikeys winger Luke Rooney and Ipswich Midfielder Andy Drury. Billy Bodin could join Torquay on a 18 month contract for £75,000 as paolo can't guarantee him football with Alan Connell, Ronan Murray, Lukas Magera, Paul Benson and even Mehdi Kerrouche ahead of him in the pecking order. Matt Ritchie will leave as long as someone offers the right money. Alberto Comazzi could be released after struggling to make an impact at the club, the 32 year old is behind Aden Flint, Alan McCormack, Joe Devera and Oliver Risser for a centre back spot, Also expect Nathan Thompson, Mark Scott and Abdul Said to go out on loan, this is all after the sales of Michael Timlin and Elliot Benyon to Southend, Leon Clarke to Charltonand Will Evans to Hereford as well as releasing Matt Clark and soon to release Jordan Pavett and Mattia Lanzano, as well as Liam Ridehalgh and Jake Jervis loan spells ending, busy January for Swindon Town\n\nRitchie wont be leaving as we value him too high for what other teams want to pay for him, he is happy and doesn't want to leave, he could win a promotion medal and a JPT medal....\n\n01 Jan 2012 16:42:50\n\nPaolo di Canio is still after 4 players and now has the funds to get them thanks to the sales of Leon Clarke, Michael Timlin, Elliot Benyon and Will Evans, and due to loan returns of Jake Jervis and Liam Ridehalgh, and the impending releases of Mattia Lanzano, Jordan Pavett and Matt Clark. He wants to sign a goalkeeper, a winger a central midfielder and another striker. The keeper he wants is Wes Foderingham who is currently on loan to the club from Crystal Palace, and is understood to be close to a permanent deal, if the deal falls through he will go for either Mikkel Andersen of reading, or attempt to bring Big Peter Brezovan back to the club from Brighton. The wingers he is interested in are Luke Rooney from Gillingham and Nick Powell from Crewe, although he could use Billy Bodin on the wings after his return from Torquay. There are several central midfielders he is interested in as he only has Simon Ferry, Jonathan Smith and Oliver Risser in that position as he now sees Alan McCormack as a Centre Half, he is interested in Harry Pell of Hereford, Michael Jacobs of Northampton, Andy Drury of Ipswich or Medy Elito of Dagenham and Redbridge. on the striker front it really depends on whether Mehdi Kerrouche is staying or going and on the form of Billy Bodin when he returns, if he stays we will not sign another striker but if it's decided that Bodin is to go on loan again then he will go for either Izale McLeod of Barnet, Joe Kuffour of Bristol Rovers or Ross Allen of Guernsey FC\n\nYou guys can have brezovan, fans dont like him anymore however i do and still think he should be playing for us. Does look a likely signing for you but weve just sent a keeper out on loan so not sure if we'd let our back up keeper leave\n\nThink you'll find Nick Powell isn't a winger, nor will he be joining Swindon.\n\n1. Michael Jacobs, Luke Rooney, Nick Powell WON'T GO TO SWINDON because higher league clubs are interested in them.\n\n2. Same again with most of the central midfielders that Swindon are 'INTERESTED' in.\n\n3. This is clearly wrong because Medi Elito IS NOT a central midfielder.\n\n4. Joe Kuffour is off to Gillingham.\n\n5. Mcleod is already set to join a league 1 club.\n\nProof that this is CLEARLY MADE UP.\n\nEpic storytelling .had to lie down arter that novel\n\n19 Dec 2011 22:19:02\n\nhereford united looking at former swansea city player dan sheehan\n\n16 Dec 2011 16:28:12\n\nSwindon have approached Crystal Palace about the possibility of signing keeper' Wes Foderingham on a permanent deal. He is expected to cost them around 200K.\n\nAlso, Swindon are set to sign Left Back Liam Ridehalgh on loan for the rest of the season.\n\nPaolo Di Canio has a also expressed a desire to trim the squad in recents weeks, with many of his foreign summer signings on their way out. Comazzi, Gabilondo, Kerrouche, Esajas, Lanzano and Magera have all been told they can find new clubs. Along with the likes of Clarke, Timlin and Evans.\n\nDi Canio is eyeing up around 5 other players to help replace these. Amongst his wish list are; Luke Rooney (Gillingham) James Constable (Oxford) Paul Benson (Charlton) Kane Hemmings (Rangers - Loan) and Harry Pell (Hereford)\n\nSource: The Usual Guy\n\n....................................................................................................................\n\nMy source has now informed me that a permanent deal for Wes Foderingham has been agreed and he will become an STFC player in early january after the end of his loan period.\n\nSource: The Usual Guy\n\nNot true, he wants to stay at palace and he wants to be number one in a few seasons. for now he will join swindon until the end of the season and then will see what happens next season\n\n15 Dec 2011 19:39:24\n\nSwindon have approached Crystal Palace about the possibility of signing keeper' Wes Foderingham on a permanent deal. He is expected to cost them around 200K.\n\nAlso, Swindon are set to sign Left Back Liam Ridehalgh on loan for the rest of the season.\n\nPaolo Di Canio has a also expressed a desire to trim the squad in recents weeks, with many of his foreign summer signings on their way out.

Amongst his wish list are; Luke Rooney (Gillingham) James Constable (Oxford) Paul Benson (Charlton) Kane Hemmings (Rangers - Loan) and Harry Pell (Hereford)\n\nSource: The Usual Guy\n\nThere is a bit of truth to some of this, Foderingham will stay till end of the season or, we will buy him if palace will consider selling, Ridehalgh, will be loaned till end of the season. Magera, Comazzi, esejas and Cibboci will be on their way with Lanzano being released in Jan, common knowledge Clarke wont be here neither will Timlin, however Wycombe want to send Benyon back early as he is flopping for them... Also Murray will be extended and Benson will sign first week of Jan, PDC is very Keen on Kee and has started talks with Burton on the possibility of a Connell + Cash deal... Luke Rooney could also sign an agreement as he is out of contract in the summer.\n\nOh and Ritchie is on his way to Burnley\n\nI’m a Charlton supporter and know little of the players being mentioned. It seems to me that Swindon are going to get an awful lot of rumours as they rebuild. You might loose some good players and get some better in. Dont be down because people are looking jealously at your players take it as a complement and a stepping stone back up. I'm sure PDC will do a good job for you if given the time and patience he needs.\n\n15 Dec 2011 08:02:16\n\nSwindon Town are set for a massive overhaul after manager Paolo Di Canio declared the club could go bankrupt if certain players don't leave in the transfer window.\n\nGoalkeeper Phil Smith is subject of a undisclosed bid from Championship side Brighton.

Caddis is rumoured to be wanting a move back to Scotland to play back in the SPL and sees a deal to 'Hibs' as something he wouldn't be able to turn down.\n\n22 year old defender Callum Kennedy, who has rumoured to be in talks over the last few weeks with a number of League 1 and Championship sides, is in talks with Bury. Bury boss Richie Barker is keen on bringing the defender to the North West and could see a deal signed even before the 1st of January on a pre contract.\n\n18 year old forward Jordan Pavett, who was known for signing a contract with Town after a sucessful trial in January this year, is in talks with League 2 riuvals Aldershot. Dean Holdsworth is keen on signing the former Ipswich youngster after Pavett was told he can leave Swindon for free during the transfer window.\n\nWill Evans, who is currently on loan at Hereford, is subject of a loan bid from rivals Bristol Rovers.\n\nAnother player set to leave the club, who is currently out on loan is Billy Bodin. Bodin is on loan at Torquay and is interesting a number of clubs, including Championship side Peterborough. Manager Darren Ferguson is interested in the potential of the Wales under 21 striker and could see a deal of around £200,000 accepted.\n\nThe last player set to leavel Town is Italian defender Alessandro Cibocchi.

Utter bullocks if you ask me. League 1 for the Town!\n\nDo your homework my Yellow friends if you look at the owners of STFC you will see theur wealth.\n\nHard luck try another ficticious story.\n\nFirst part of this rumour is laughable, Smith , ferry Caddis and Kennedy going nowhere....Pavett , evans , Cibocchi yes , Bodin probably not\n\nLeague 1? Can't see you making the play offs personally\n\n23 Nov 2011 23:13:14\n\nCrwaley Town boss Steve Evans is set to be given funds in the January transfer window to put together his final squad for his League 2 promotion battle.\n\nSouthend United winger Ryan Hall, who is wanted by a number of Championship sides, is in talks with Town after Evans had a £120,000 bid accepted. Hall is currently wanting to stay at United but might not have the will power to turn down a 100% rise in wages.\n\nFormer Hereford loanee Sam Winnall could join on loan from Wolves. Winnall, who scored 2 goals in 8 starts for the struggling League 2 club, impressed Evans earlier in the season. Winnall will join on loan until the end of the season.\n\nEvans is keen on recruiting a midfielder and has already seen a bid for Monaco midfielder Aadil Assana accepted. The 18 year old is keen on a loan move away from the French second division side to gain some first team experience and Evans is keen on signing the player until the end of the season.\n\nNorwich striker come midfielder Aaron Wilbraham could join Town tomorrow before the loan deadline after the former Hull City player told City boss Paul Lambert that he would like to be farmed out on loan to get some first team football.\n\nGavin Tomlin is another target of Evans and could join from struggling League 2 side Dag & Red for a nominal fee.\n\nSouthend accepting �120,000 for Hall. Yeah then stick another �180,000 on that plus add-ons. �120,000 really. Who on earth told you that?\n\nAbsolute tripe again regarding the Ryan Hall story. This poster has an inferiority complex about Southend.\n\nBehave. Seriously, have you got nothing better to do. Ryan Hall is going nowhere. Desperate Crawley.\n\nRyan hall will not be joining creepy crawley full stop\n\n21 Nov 2011 18:06:19\n\nPlymouth boss Carl Fletcher is set to target a number of new faces as he prepares to turn the fortunes of the struggling League 2 side. Wolves young striker Sam Winnall will be the first to join in January after the former Hereford loanee held talks over the weekend. Winnall will join in January until the end of the season with a view to him signing a three year contract at Home Park when his deal at Molineux runs out. Brentford striker Kirk Hudson could join this week until January. Fletcher is keen on strenghthening his defence and could go in for Shrewsbury centre half Shane Cansdell-Sherriff. The former Leeds player has told Graham Turner he would like to leave Town after an arguement with a number of players and Fletcher could be set to snap up the experienced defender. Another striker interesting Fletcher is young Exeter forward Tom Nichols. The 18 year old has impressed at reserve level and was noticed by a Plymouth scout. Argyle are keen to bring in Nichols before the window on loan but it lokos like he won't join until the window with the deal expected to run until the summer. Young Southend defender Teddy Nesbitt could join on loan in the coming days as Argyle look to bolster options in defence.\n\n20 Oct 2011 01:31:19\n\nSouthed United will let Luke Prosser go out on loan to hereford.\n\nNot hearing anything about Sturrock going, so anything on here about him going is rubbish.\n\nWe take no responsibility for the accuracy or otherwise of published Hereford United rumours"
