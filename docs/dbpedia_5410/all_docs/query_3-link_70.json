        "text": "It must be something about the 12th game of the season – it was the 12th game of last term when the Bulls gained their remarkable 4-3 win at Northampton after a 3-0 half-time deficit.\n\nThis time it was only a point from a 2-0 half-time scoreline but the effect on morale, against one of the division’s better sides, should be similar.\n\nWith goalkeeper Dave Cornell and Delroy Facey called up for international duty, Bulls boss Jamie Pitman found his hand forced for the trip to the County Ground.\n\nRussell Hoult replaced Cornell in goal with Nathan Elder given his debut in attack in place of Facey.\n\nThere were two other changes with on-loan Steve Leslie and Simon Clist included as Pitman and director of football Gary Peters appeared to have opted for a 4-5-1 set-up.\n\nHereford had an early scare when former loanee Jake Jervis outpaced Michael Townsend as both chased a through ball.\n\nBut the former Cheltenham Town defender did enough to ensure that Jervis could only finish with a weak shot which was easily fielded by Hoult.\n\nHereford, who were playing with two ranks in midfield – Clist and Kenny Lunt in behind Tom Barkhuizen, Nicky Featherstone and Leslie – pushed forward and both Barkhuizen and Leslie had good early runs.\n\nA foul by Townsend on Jervis brought the first goal on seven minutes.\n\nThe free-kick was swung was swung in by Mehdi Kerrouche for Raffaele De Vita to head past the helpless Hoult.\n\nJervis threatened again on 14 minutes, finding space on the edge of the area to drive a shot inches wide.\n\nOn 29 minutes, a brilliant run by Paul Caddis turned the Hereford defence inside-out and his cross was flicked just wide by Kerrouche.\n\nThen only some good defending by Purdie prevented a second goal after Jervis had side-stepped Townsend.\n\nWith Swindon doing most of the pressing, Kerrouche headed just over on 37 minutes.\n\nHereford earned a free-kick on 39 minutes from a similar position to the one from where Swindon had scored, but Clist’s delivery was poor and the ball drifted behind.\n\nThe inevitable second goal arrived five minutes before the break when Kerrouche received a ball from Matt Ritchie and neatly sidestepped Stefan Stam to fire past Hoult.\n\nHereford brought on Harry Pell at the interval in place of the ineffectual Lunt.\n\nAnd United sparked a little with Barkhuizen crashing a cross through the six-yard box and wide.\n\nBut Swindon quickly moved back on to the attack and Hoult had to dive to push away a shot from Jervis.\n\nAnd Simon Ferry volleyed over from a great position after the Bulls defence had struggled to make an authentic clearance.\n\nBut Hereford showed some resilience and Pell’s header from the edge of the area was only inches over.\n\nHereford introduced Sam Winnall and Yoann Arquin and within seconds had pulled a goal back.\n\nWinnall found Barkhuizen on the edge of the area and the Blackpool youngster’s cross-shot screamed into the corner of the net.\n\nBut Hoult had to fist away a fierce shot from Matt Ritchie as Swindon went back on the attack.\n\nHereford were now looking more dangerous, however, and a good move ended with Leslie rifling a drive just over the bar.\n\nAnd, amazingly, the Bulls picked out an equaliser on 76 minutes.\n\nJoe Heath produced an exquisite cross from the left and Arquin flicked his header beyond Mattia Lanzano.\n\nBut, Swindon unlocked the Hereford defence again just three minutes later and Simon Ferry was in the clear as he smashed a shot past Hoult.\n\nHereford were not finished and Arquin headed just over when he just unable to leap high enough to control Leslie’s cross.\n\nAnd Pell popped up a minute from time to head a dramatic equaliser.\n\nHereford: 4-5-1: Hoult; Purdie, Stam, Townsend, Heath; Barkhuizen, Clist (Winnall 66), Lunt (Pell 46), Featherstone, Leslie; Elder (Arquin 66). Subs not used: Dalibard, McQuilkin.\n\nSwindon: 4-4-2: Lanzano; Caddis, Devera, McCormack, Cibocchi (Ridehalgh 70); Ritchie, Smith (Abdulla 54), Ferry, De Vita; Jervis, Kerrouche (Magera 70). Subs not used: Bedwell, Connell.\n\nReferee: Jock Waugh (South Yorkshire).\n\nAttendance: 7,456 (including 251 from Hereford).\n\nGoals: De Vita, 7 min, 1-0; Kerrouche, 40 min, 2-0; Barkhuizen, 67 min, 2-1; Arquin, 76 min, 2-2; Ferry, 79 min, 3-2; Pell, 89 min, 3-3.\n\nYellow cards:Pell, goal celebration, 89 min."
