        "text": "City manager Keith Millen expects to make a few changes for the re-arranged visit of Swindon.\n\nSome changes will be enforced, with several unnamed players nursing knocks following the goalless home draw against Portsmouth on Saturday. However, defensive trio Louis Carey (illness), Liam Fontaine and Damion Stewart (both ankle) returned to training on Monday following their recent absences.\n\n“I have a few knocks in the squad and a few missing on the training ground,” Millen told the club’s official website. “We have to play Wednesday-Saturday again this week so we have to be aware of that when selecting the teams to play in each game.\n\n“There will be a few forced changes but I have a strong squad and I am more than confident I will have the strongest possible line-up out there to give Swindon a challenge.”\n\nFormer England goalkeeper David James, midfielders Martyn Woolford and Kalifa Cisse and strikers Ryan Taylor and Brett Pitman were all substitutes at the weekend and are options for Millen.\n\nThe tie was postponed earlier this month following rioting in Bristol.\n\nSwindon boss Paolo Di Canio is set to make changes.\n\nStriker Alan Connell should make his first start for the club, while goalkeeper Mattia Lanzano, a substitute in Sunday’s home defeat to Oxford, may also play.\n\nNew arrival Lukas Magera penned a two-year deal at the club on Monday and could make his debut providing his international clearance arrives in time.\n\nStriker Mehdi Kerrouche was substituted on Sunday after receiving a knock on the hip. He has received treatment this week but is rated as doubtful.\n\nCentre-back Alberto Comazzi will again be missing because of a hamstring injury, as will Alessandro Cibocchi, who remains sidelined with an ankle problem."
