        "text": "We all know Paolo Di Canio’s colourful past – from pushing over referee’s to giving fascist salutes he has dominated both front and back pages of newspapers for many years. He also provided some wonderful moments of pure skill and professionalism – some of you may remember the match when the opposition’s goalkeeper went down injured in the box and with West Ham on the attack Di Canio screamed for the ball to be crossed into him, which he then proceeded to catch it in order to force a break in play and allow treatment for the crocked keeper. This still remains one of the most famous sporting gestures in Premier League history.\n\nObviously the man has many facets to his personality. And now after hanging up his boots and having a stint as a commentator in Italy he has now entered management – but how will the enigmatic Italian fair in this new venture?\n\nThe 42 year old took over at Swindon Town at the end of May. The previous season Swindon were hoping for another promotion push but after loosing top scorer Billy Paynter and other key players the season ended in disaster with relegation to League 2. Manager Paul Hart paid the price and was sacked, paving the way for Di Canio to take up his first job in management. He fought off competition from George Burley and Dietmar Hamann after impressing Chairman Jeremy Wray.\n\nA few days earlier Di Canio had told the press he was confident he would be stepping into management ‘I believe my future will be in England. In the next few days something will happen, perhaps in an inferior division’. Some journalists had expected Di Canio to start his career higher up the footballing pyramid, but like many others he is having to start at the bottom and make his way up. Although referring to League 2 as an ‘inferior division’ might put a few noses out of joint – fans of League 2 clubs know they are in a rubbish league but don’t like having it rubbed in their faces.\n\nThat prompts the question of just how much respect does Di Canio have for the team and the league they are in? Many managers have fallen foul of their own egos and underestimating the opposition. Di Canio is aiming for promotion at the first attempt and the board will expect nothing less.\n\nIt is an eye opening appointment and some will claim that Swindon just want the publicity. The website is full of opportunities to meet with the great man, such as a sponsor offering a free meal at their restaurant with him for a lucky competition winner. The club shop is selling Swindon shirts with ‘Di Canio’ and ‘10’ on the back and is well stocked with Di Canio’s book.\n\nWhilst the club is going publicity crazy it has not all been good. Sponsors GMB Union have cut ties with the club due to Di Canio’s appointment. Being a trade union the firm has a strict anti-fascism policy and has decided they want nothing more to with the club whilst Di Canio is in charge. GMB contributed around £4,000 to the club in the deal, but Swindon will be hopeful other sponsors can be found to replace them.\n\nNo doubt the supporters will be excited to have Di Canio in the dugout, but they won’t be pleased with the match day prices going up. Supporters who pay on the day will now pay more to watch the side compete in a lower division. Could the hikes be to pay Di Canio’s wage or provide him with a competitive transfer budget?\n\nAnd what has Di Canio done so far in terms of being a manager? Apart from all the publicity he is giving the club he hasn’t achieved much. The club would have hoped that by putting him in charge they could convince some of their players to stay and others to sign up for next seasons promotion push. After all, playing for a club who is aiming for promotion and having Di Canio as your boss, what League 2 player wouldn’t want to join up? This, however, doesn’t seem to be the case. Swindon lost out on striker Mark Birchill to Gillingham despite having a bid accepted by Dover. And midfielder Jonathan Douglas turned down a contract offer to move to Brentford, stating a large part of the decision was working with Bee’s boss Uwe Rosler.\n\nDouglas later said that after 10 minutes of talking to Rosler he knew he wanted to work for him and that no-one else gave him that self-belief. So the Di Canio effect doesn’t seem to be working so far. Fair enough Brentford are a league higher up but its hard to think of someone who could be more passionate than Di Canio – obviously Douglas didn’t see it that way.\n\nWhat about his signings so far? He has picked up a few players from Italy – 20 year old goalkeeper Mattia Lanzano from USD Gavorrana 1930 and Estonia international Taijo Teniste is on trail, whilst Christian Cesaretti has joined them at their Italian training camp. Its fair to say that there is probably very little League 2 experience in those players.\n\nDi Canio may be setting himself up for a very large fall. He has his coaching badges but many star players have proved themselves to be clueless managers. Take Captain Marvel Bryan Robson, who failed miserably at both club and international level as a manager. And will he be ready to deal with players who have nowhere near the talent he had? And the pressure of being a manager is totally different from that of a player. Its very hard to tell how it will go for him, but with the start of the season less than four weeks away it will be worth looking out for Swindon’s results.\n\nJoin Forza Italian Football on Twitter and Facebook."
