        "text": "In June 1968, when the North of England's chicken-in-the-basket/cabaret circuit was at its height, hosting some of the biggest names in entertainment, Louis Armstrong played the Batley Variety Club, and is reported to have said, on arrival in the Yorkshire mill town: \"Man, we done hit the bottom.\" I wonder if Paolo Di Canio reacted similarly when he fetched up in Swindon.\n\nI only ask because the great man took to the pitch for the home match against Rotherham on Saturday clutching a bottle of San Pellegrino mineral water like a comfort blanket, a reminder of classier days maybe. For a man who never travelled particularly well when he was at West Ham United, League Two could prove something of an education, requiring visits to places that time forgot, like Hereford and Accrington.\n\nPaolo was clearly the reason Sky's cameras were at Swindon. League Two barely features in Sky's Football League title sequence, which comprises mostly Championship action, and cutaways of well-known characters like Sven, Sam Allardyce, and Gus Poyet, without a sniff of Paolo's League Two managerial peers. We can assume, therefore, it was the Italian's colourful CV rather than Rotherham's position at the top of the table that had Sky's vans setting the sat nav for SN1 2ED.\n\nCertainly, by five minutes into the programme, we had already seen Paolo's award-winning volley for West Ham against Wimbledon twice, plus a rerun of his midweek contretemps with his striker Leon Clarke in the players' tunnel. Lest there be any lingering doubt who the star of the show was, the on‑pitch preview was interrupted by the PA system playing out that extract from Verdi's Rigoletto which shall henceforth be known in Wiltshire as the Paolo Di Canio tune.\n\nOne does not wish to trade in racial stereotypes too much, but as we saw Paolo stride towards the dugout, fashionably sun-glassed, in his sharp suit, with the distinctive green mineral water bottle, with its delightfully retro label, tucked under his arm, the thought occurred that no one can carry off a suit quite like an Italian. This is not to say Rotherham's manager, Andy Scott, was not smartly suited and booted for the telly, but less to the manner born, more a man from Epsom doing his best.\n\nPaolo has had a run of poor results at the start of his managerial career, which he ascribed in his pre-match interview to the fact that he was, in the style of Noel Gallagher – with whom he has much in common – in the song Don't Look Back In Anger, trying to start a revolution. \"All revolutions take time,\" said Paolo, \"The French Revolution, the American; five years, 10 years, 20 years.\" Revolution may be pitching it a little strong – not something Paolo has ever found noticeably inhibiting – but he has brought in 16 new players, including a couple of lower league Italians who may take time to adjust. Mattia Lanzano, for instance, was described as getting \"his first taste of English football, having swapped Tuscany for Wiltshire\", interestingly the reverse journey recently enjoyed by many of the middle classes living round about, whose footballing sympathies, one suspects, are more likely to veer towards Stamford Bridge than the County Ground.\n\nIf anybody can engender some enthusiasm for the local team, though, it is Paolo. I worked in Swindon in the 1970s, when it still clung to the vestiges of former glories as a centre of Britain's railway industry, but even then, apart from on odd occasions, you never sensed huge identification with the football team.\n\nIn no sense are Swindon a sleeping giant like Nottingham Forest or Sheffield Wednesday. Just sleeping, really. But there were signs on Saturday that Paolo may be waking the place up. The wild celebrations after Matt Ritchie's deflected goal put Swindon back in the match, and at the final whistle, are promising signs, as was some of the football Paolo's side played – although he may have to change the habits of a lifetime and pay some attention to defence.\n\nWhen Paolo was appointed, it seemed to me as it did to most people, as if some sharp-suited fly-by-night had taken a rather plain bride and I was inclined to join the multitude in folding my arms and tutting, \"It'll never last,\" but now I am not so sure.\n\nI would not go quite as far as goalscorer Alan Connell, who said, \"When the County Ground's buzzing like that, I don't think there is any better place to be,\" (Really? The San Siro? Camp Nou? Sinatra at the Sands?), but I expect Swindon under their charismatic manager to make a quick return to League One (warning to betting people: the value of investments can go down as well as up).\n\nThere remains the problem of the manager's professed admiration for Benito Mussolini which has not gone down well, although I believe Il Duce did get the trains running on time and, in a railway town like Swindon, that at least might be appreciated."
