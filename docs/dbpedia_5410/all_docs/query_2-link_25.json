        "text": "Mattia Donato studied at the Department of Physics, University of Genoa (Italy) and he obtained the physics bachelor degree (2010) with a thesis about the tests and the characterization of a prototype of compact gamma-camera for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT).\n\nHe studied as exchange student at the Uppsala University (Sweden) and there he did an internship at the Fusion Diagnostics Group of Applied Nuclear Physics, Department Of Physics And Astronomy, where he prepared his thesis. In the 2013, at University of Genoa, he obtained the master degree with a thesis about the characterization of a neutron detector designed for the nuclear fusion experiment Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST).\n\nHe worked four years at the Detector Development Group of the institute European XFEL (Hamburg, Germany) as doctoral candidate. In the 2018, he obtained the doctoral degree in Physics from Hamburg University with a thesis about the commissioning and the characterization of a 4.5 MHz single photon soft X-ray camera (DSSC ladder) designed for European XFEL."
