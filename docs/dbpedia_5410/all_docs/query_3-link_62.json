This prestigious tournament will see 24 of Europe’s best national teams competing for glory. Germany is hosting the Euros for the first time since reunification, adding historical significance to the event. The tournament will feature coaches from 17 different nationalities, with Italian coaches notably popular among national teams.\n\nThe upcoming Cup will feature five national coaches from Italy. No other nation accounts for more than two coaches.\n\nA glance at the nationalities of the coaches reveals that all but one at the European Championship are from Europe. The sole exception is Brazilian coach Sylvinho, who currently heads the Albania national team. Notably, Sylvinho was granted Albanian citizenship in December 2023.\n\nDefending champions Italy will compete under the guidance of Luciano Spalletti. Additionally, Francesco Calzona (Slovakia), Vincenzo Montella (Turkey), Domenico Tedesco (Belgium), and Marco Rossi (Hungary) will also represent Italy.\n\nFollowing Italy, Spain, Germany, and France each have two coaches leading national teams in the month-long tournament.\n\nJulian Nagelsmann (Germany) and Ralf Rangnick (Austria) will showcase Germany’s coaching talent. Luis de la Fuente (Spain) and Roberto Martinez (Portugal) will represent Spain, while Didier Deschamps (France) and Willy Sagnol (Georgia) will represent France.\n\nThere will be one coach each from Brazil, England, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Scotland, Serbia, Slovenia, Switzerland, and Ukraine. As mentioned earlier, Brazilian Sylvinho will lead the Albania national team. The remaining national sides will each be coached by individuals of the same nationality as their respective teams.\n\nWho are the coaching watching when looking at Italy? Who is playing for Italy? Luciano Spalletti has finalized his roster for the 2024 games. With three players Ivan Provedel, Riccardo Orsolini and Samuele Ricci cut from the roster, here are the chosen 26-man squad to hit the pitch.\n\nEuro 2024 Roster for Italy:\n\nGoalkeepers: Gianluigi Donnarumma (Captain, PSG), Alex Meret (Napoli), Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham).\n\nDefenders: Alessandro Bastoni (Inter), Raoul Bellanova (Torino), Alessandro Buongiorno (Torino), Riccardo Calafiori (Bologna), Andrea Cambiaso (Juventus), Matteo Darmian (Inter), Giovanni Di Lorenzo (Napoli), Federico Dimarco (Inter), Federico Gatti (Juventus), Gianluca Mancini (Roma).\n\nMidfielders: Nicolò Barella (Inter), Bryan Cristante (Roma), Nicolò Fagioli (Juventus), Michael Folorunsho (Hellas Verona), Davide Frattesi (Inter), Jorginho (Arsenal), Lorenzo Pellegrini (Roma)."
