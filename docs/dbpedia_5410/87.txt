Swindon Town will not be cancelling the contract of goalkeeper Mattia Lanzano until at least January.

The Italian, 20, asked to be released from his two-year deal so he could return to his homeland but he has now decided against a move.

Lanzano has told the Robins that if he finds a new club then he will leave without any compensation.

"The problem was he gave his word to his agent, and then changed his word," boss Paolo di Canio told BBC Wiltshire.

"It's not the behaviour of a good professional, this is my opinion."

Lanzano joined the League Two outfit in the summer, external and has made seven appearances but he is now third-choice keeper behind Wes Foderingham and Phil Smith.

"He's a part of the squad, he's training with the club, but I'm not stupid, the club is not stupid," added di Canio.

"He wants to stay now until he can find a club in Italy. He promises that if he has a club in Italy, genuinely he will leave this club without asking for any money.

"That is public, it's not my opinion, there are witnesses. If there is one club, from Italy, that could be his former club Gavorrano. At the moment they say maybe they will call him back in January.

"During this period he will train with us because he is a part of the team, we will treat him as a player and he is a good keeper."
