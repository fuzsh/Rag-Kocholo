Goalkeeper Mattia Lanzano has agreed to leave Swindon in January without a pay-out, according to manager Paolo Di Canio.

Di Canio revealed Lanzano had originally agreed to have his contract with the League Two Robins cancelled, before doubling back on the decision and stating his intent to stay until January. At that point, the Swindon boss said, the young stopper promised he would not ask for a penny from the Wiltshire outfit should an Italian club come in for him. "Now he has decided to stay until he finds a club in Italy," said Di Canio. "He has promised that if he has a club in Italy in January then he will leave this club without asking for any money. That is public, it is not my opinion and there are witnesses. "If one club in Italy come, and that could be his former club Gavorrano, he promised to his agent and to the club that he will leave without asking for one pound. "Until this time he will train with us because he is part of the team. We will treat him as a player, at the moment he is the third goalkeeper, and we will treat him as a member of the squad."
