Swindon Town have completed the signing of Italian goalkeeper Mattia Lanzano.

The 20-year-old, who was with Italian side US Gavorrana 1930 last season, joins the Robins on a two-year deal.

"He's a clever boy," manager Paolo di Canio told BBC Wiltshire. "He doesn't speak English but already [on Thursday] in five-a-side he spoke too much.

"He has enthusiasm and if you look at him he looks older than his age and also he looks older in the way he behaves in the goal."

Di Canio added: "He's a big fella with no fear so I like him already."

The Robins boss also revealed he is close to handing Namibian international Oliver Risser a full-time contract, after the defender impressed on trial.

"He's very happy and excited and has showed me a big enthusiasm," said Di Canio.

"He would like to join us straight away, for a few years and he wants to make history in the club and that is the way to think."
