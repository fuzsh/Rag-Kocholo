Swindon goalkeeper Mattia Lanzano is relieved to have finally made his Robins debut two months after his USD Gavorrana trade.

Lanazano, who has recently recovered from a rib injury, played in the 3-2 victory over League Two high-flyers Rotherham on Saturday. The Italian hopes the result will kick-start his new club's season after a slow start. "I was very nervous because it was my first match in three months and it was the first time (in English football) for me. I am very, very happy," he said. "I am very happy because after five matches we found a win and that is very important in our minds. "I have to work hard now because I hope this victory is the first of a long series. We are a very strong team and I hope we can keep going."
