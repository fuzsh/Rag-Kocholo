Missy Elliott launched her music career in an R&B group called Fayze. Her childhood friend, Timbaland, became the group’s producer. After Fayze was signed to Elektra Records, Elliott, Timbaland, and others including Ginuine, moved into New York and began to write and rap for other artists. Elliott continued to work with her pal Timbaland to produce tracks for the late star Aaliyah, Destiny’s Child, and P. Diddy, amongst others. In 1997, Missy Elliott released her debut album Supa Dupa Fly, and it was nominated for the Grammy for Best Rap Album in 1998. Missy’s third album, Miss E…So Addictive catapulted her to mainstream recognition with the hits “One Minute Man”, “Get Ur Freak On”, and “4 My People.”

In all, Missy Elliott has achieved widespread success as a writer, producer, and rapper. In addition to writing and producing for global superstars including Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Whitney Houston, and Janet Jackson, Missy Elliott is the only female rapper with five platinum albums to accompany her five Grammys. As a response to her rough childhood, Elliott has become a crusader in the fight against domestic violence and continues to advocate for the eradication of domestic violence and AIDS.
