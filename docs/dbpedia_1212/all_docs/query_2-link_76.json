        "text": "Magoo, a rapper who was a foundational member of a groundbreaking hip-hop scene that emerged in Virginia in the 1990s, collaborating with up-and-coming stars like Timbaland, Missy Elliott and Pharrell Williams, died over the weekend in Williamsburg, Va. He was 50.\n\nThe death was confirmed on Monday by his former wife, Meco Barcliff, who said that the coroner’s office was investigating the cause.\n\nMagoo, whose birth name was Melvin Barcliff, was a child when rap music was first heard on the radio, and he credited it with helping save him from a difficult early childhood.\n\nAt first he thought hip-hop was made only by people in the Northeast, he said in a 2013 interview for the hip-hop oral history collection at the College of William & Mary. But as rap music began to drift from the coasts and Atlanta to record stores in Virginia, Magoo, then 14, realized that it was an art form he could practice, too.\n\nAt Deep Creek High School in Chesapeake, he made friends with other teenagers who were interested in the genre, including Timothy Mosley, also known as Timbaland, who would go on to become a renowned producer.\n\nMagoo and others in the Virginia Beach area, including Pharrell Williams and Missy Elliott, exerted a heavy influence on hip-hop in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Magoo and Timbaland formed a duo and, between 1997 and 2003, put out three albums. “Welcome to Our World,” their first collaboration, included the track “Up Jumps da’ Boogie,” featuring Ms. Elliott and Aaliyah, which reached No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. It would be their highest-charting effort.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
