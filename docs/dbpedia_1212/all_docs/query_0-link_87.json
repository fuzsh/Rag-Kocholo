        "text": "Snapchat has suddenly become music’s hottest venue for premiering new music.\n\nDays after Madonna became the first artist to release a music video on the app for self-deleting messages, DJ-producer Diplo previewed a new track on the platform late Tuesday — and it features contributions from Missy Elliott.\n\nMissy hasn’t released an album in 10 years, but her appearance during Katy Perry’s Super Bowl halftime show has made fans’ hunger for new material more intense than ever. (Outside of guest appearances and a few one-off songs, she’s mostly stayed behind-the-scenes.) Thankfully, Diplo and fellow DJ-producer Skrillex, who collaborate under the name Jack Ü, have recruited the singer-rapper to hop on a remix of their Kiesza collaboration, “Take Ü There.” Listen to Diplo’s Snapchat previews of the track below, via Your EDM."
