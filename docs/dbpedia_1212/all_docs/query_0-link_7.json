        "text": "More than three decades into her storied career, Missy “Misdemeanor” Elliott is gearing up for her first-ever headlining tour. On Monday morning (April 8) the “Work It” rapper announced the dates for her Out of This World – The Missy Elliott Experience 2024 North American arena tour, which is slated to kick off on on July 4 in Vancouver at Rogers Arena, and include stops in Seattle, Oakland, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Denver, Houston, Tampa, Atlanta, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Boston, Brooklyn and Detroit before winding down on August 22 at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont, IL.\n\nThe summer outing will feature support from Busta Rhymes, Ciara and Elliott’s longtime musical partner producer Timbaland. The poster for the tour features Missy, Busta and Ciara dressed in Mad Max-style futuristic leather outfits standing in front of a giant space ship.\n\n“This is an incredible time in my life as I am experiencing so many milestone ‘firsts.’ Being the FIRST female Hip Hop artist to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and now going out on my FIRST headline tour,” Elliott said in a statement about the 24-city tour co-produced by Live Nation and Elliott’s longtime manager Mona Scott-Young. “Fans have been asking me to tour forever but I wanted to wait until I felt the time was right because I knew if I was ever going to do it, I had to do it big, and I had to do it with family! So get ready to be taken OUT OF THIS WORLD with me, Busta Rhymes, Ciara, and Timbaland! We can’t wait to share this experience with the fans!”\n\nIn keeping with Elliott’s legendarily out-there music videos, the tour announce was accompanied by a short teaser video helmed by another one of Missy’s frequent collaborators, director Dave Meyers. “In 2024, these three icons come together to show you something you’ve never seen before,” Elliott says in voiceover in the clip in which she, Busta and Ciara emerge from the spacecraft.\n\n“Something not right,” Elliott says at one point as the shoot is interrupted by confusion. “This is not Earth!” That leads to Busta busting out a paper celestial map only to discover that he took a “wrong turn” at Mars, a revelation that makes Ciara short of breath. Missy then calls Timbaland on her old school brick cell phone to complain about Busta’s terrible sense of space direction.\n\nIn an additional statement about her client’s first-ever headlining tour, Scott-Young said, “Missy has always been an iconic groundbreaker and continuously pushes herself to be bolder and go where she has never been before – and surprisingly, one of those places is headlining her own tour! For decades, fans and peers worldwide have clamored for Missy to tour and they’re finally going to get what they’ve been asking for as she teams up with Ciara, Busta, and longtime partner-in-rhyme Timbaland, to deliver a start-to-finish, nonstop, high-octane, OUT OF THIS WORLD concert experience. This will be one for the books, so trust me, you don’t want to miss it!”\n\nTickets for the tour will go on sale first through a Verizon presale that kicks off on Tuesday (April 9) beginning at 10 a.m. local time through Thursday (April 11) at 10 p.m. local time; click here for more details.
