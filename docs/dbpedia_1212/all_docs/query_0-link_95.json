        "text": "“This is an incredible time in my life as I am experiencing so many milestone ‘firsts,'” Elliott said in a press release. “Being the FIRST female hip-hop artist to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and now going out on my FIRST headline tour,. Fans have been asking me to tour forever but I wanted to wait until I felt the time was right because I knew if I was ever going to do it, I had to do it big, and I had to do it with family!”\n\nThe 24-city tour will begin in Vancouver, Canada on July 4. Their trek will continue in the U.S. where they'll hit up numerous major cities until they wrap up in Rosemont, Ill on August 22. This will be Missy Elliott's first headlining in her 30+ years in the music industry. Her longtime manager Mona Scott-Young told Variety that Elliott was inspired to go on tour shortly after she was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame last year.\n\n\"I think that was a seismic moment for her as well, where she realized that this was a goal and a dream that she had been working so hard to attain,\" she said. \"And now that she felt that she had achieved that pinnacle, she wanted to really do this thing that she put off for so long, which was go out on the road. It certainly wasn’t for lack of opportunity or offers. I think it was the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame of it.”\n\nThe announcement comes months after Missy, Ciara and Busta all released new music. Missy and Timbaland are currently working on a new album together, which might arrive just in time for her birthday and the tour's kick-off in July. Since Timbo revealed the news last year, Missy has hopped on several collaborations with Anitta, Brent Faiyaz, Chloe and others. Meanwhile, Busta recently dropped his Blockbusta album featuring songs like \"Beach Ball\" with BIA and \"Luxury Life\" featuring Coi Leray. Ciara is also fresh off the release of her recent EP CiCi which holds hits like \"How We Roll\" with Chris Brown and \"Forever\" featuring Lil Baby.\n\nPre-sale tickets begin Tuesday, April 9, before general sales kick-off on Friday, April 12.
