        "text": "After a several year silence, Missy Elliott has finally returned, and she’s back in phenomenal style.\n\nEarlier today, the hip-hop star released her new single “WTF (Where They From)”, complete with a video treatment. The song is typical Missy, with frantic, sometimes random lyrics, a killer beat, hooks for days, and some odd noises thrown in for good measure. While several other female rappers have made a name for themselves in the years since Missy last appeared on the charts, she proves with this new single that there is simply nobody that can do it like she does.\n\nThe track features a rap verse from Pharrell, which shows that the man is one of many talents. The video is colorful and bounces from scene to scene, each with its own theme and a new highly-stylized Missy, including a few glimpses at her and Pharrell as puppets.\n\n“WTF” is Missy’s first proper single in seven years or so, following a handful of cuts she sent to the Hot 100 back in 2008 that were available on the soundtrack to the movie Step Up 2. Since then, there has been relative radio silence from Missy’s camp, and just recently she revealed that she has been suffering from Graves’ disease, which has kept her from working.\n\nMissy has been working on a new album for some time now, and though no formal announcement has been made, the release of a new single is likely a sign that it might not be too long until it sees the light of day. In addition to Pharrell's guest vocals, he and Timbaland are helping out on production duties. Missy’s last album, The Cookbook, debuted at number two over a decade ago."
