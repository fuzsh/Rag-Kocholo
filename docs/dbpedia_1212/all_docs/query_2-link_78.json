So I probably have at least six albums worth of music at this point.\n\n\"Yeah. And (long-time collaborator and producer Timbaland) is always saying that to me, 'What you waiting for? So what you waiting for then?' I be like, I don't know.\"\n\nShe added, \"But yeah, I believe that it'll be a day that everybody's going on about their way, and then you just look online and see an album date from me. So yeah, I think that'll happen sooner than later.\""
