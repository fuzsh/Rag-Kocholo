        "text": "Grammy-winning hip-hop and R&B artist Missy Elliott has been tapped for a role in director Michel Gondry and producer Pharrell Williams‘ new, untitled feature for Universal Pictures.\n\nDetails as to her role are under wraps, as are all roles so far. Set in Virginia Beach in the summer of 1977, the film is described as a coming-of-age musical inspired by the city’s Atlantis Apartments and the neighborhood where Williams grew up.\n\nAs previously announced, Kelvin Harrison Jr. leads an ensemble that also includes The Holdovers Oscar winner Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Halle Bailey, and Oscar nominee Brian Tyree Henry. Written by Martin Hynes and Steven Levenson, the film will be produced by Williams and Mimi Valdés for i am OTHER, as well as Gil Netter for Gil Netter Productions. Universal’s Senior Vice President of Production Development Ryan Jones and Director of Production Development Christine Sun are overseeing the project for the studio.\n\nLast year becoming the first female hip-hop artist to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Elliott is one of the only female rappers ever to put out six studio albums certified platinum or better. While she’s not worked that often in film and television over the course of her decades-long career, she has been seen on Fox’s Star and in the dance-themed feature Honey opposite Jessica Alba. Additionally, she’s featured in docs including Fade to Black, looking at Jay-Z’s farewell concert at Madison Square Garden, and the sneaker culture-focused Just for Kicks.\n\nOn July 4, Elliott hits the road with Out Of This World – The Missy Elliott Experience, her first-ever headlining tour, which will see her perform in 24 cities alongside the likes of Busta Rhymes, Ciara and Timbaland. The artist is repped by Mona Scott-Young of Monami Management and Singh, Singh & Trauben."
