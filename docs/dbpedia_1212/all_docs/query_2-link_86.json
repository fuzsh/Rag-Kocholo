        "text": "New York, NY) – Five-time Grammy Award winner Missy Elliott is giving fans the opportunity to name her new album, due out on Goldmind/Atlantic late Spring 2008. Fans can enter immediately via Missy’s website, missy-elliott.com. The contest closes on February 20th and the winner will be announced on March 2nd. The winner will receive credit on Missy’s new album and a $500 “Respect Me” adidas gift card.\n\nFans have already gotten a sneak peek of what Elliott has been up to with “Ching-A-Ling,” a new song which, along with Elliott’s “Shake Your Pom Pom,” will appear on both the “STEP UP 2 THE STREETS – ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE SOUNDTRACK” (due out today, February 5th) as well as on Elliott’s forthcoming 7th studio album (due out Spring 2008). “STEP UP 2 THE STREETS – ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE SOUNDTRACK” is the musical companion to the upcoming Touchstone Pictures dance film of the same name. The film is slated for a 5 day – Valentine’s to President’s Day – opening weekend beginning in theaters nationwide on Thursday, February 14th.\n\nThe radio response to “Ching-A-Ling” has been instantaneous and reactionary, and the song, which just received a 4-star review in Rolling Stone magazine, has garnered over 15 million in audience after just a few short weeks of airplay.\n\nIn addition, Elliot has teamed up with longtime visual collaborator Dave Meyers and the Walt Disney Company’s Touchstone Pictures to make history by creating the first ever 3D music video for “Ching-A-Ling.”\n\nMissy made live appearances on both MTV’s TRL and BET’s 106th & Park yesterday to premiere the video. The glasses needed to view the 3D effects are available via FYE stores nationwide, at select adidas stores, and via radio giveaways in various cities hosting STEP UP 2 movie screenings. For more 3D glasses distribution locations, please visit www.missy-elliott.com or www.myspace.com/missyelliott.\n\nElliott enjoyed a wide variety of successes in 2007: from writing and producing songs for Fantasia and Keyshia Cole, including Cole’s Grammy-nominated “Let It Go;” to being paid tribute at VH-1’s Hip Hop Honors and receiving the “Creative Visionary Award” at the 2nd Annual Black Girls Rock Awards Show at Lincoln Center; to remixing country with hip hop for the national television advertising campaign for Doritos Collisions. And yes, that was Missy Elliott in the Pepsi Superbowl commercial!"
