        "text": "(born 1971). American rapper and music producer Missy Elliott made a mark on the male-dominated hip-hop world with her talents for writing, rapping, singing, and music production. Her music videos earned her accolades as well as a regular presence on MTV.\n\nMelissa Arnette Elliott (also known as Missy Misdemeanor) was born on July 1, 1971, in Portsmouth, Virginia. Her big break came in 1991 when DeVante Swing from the band Jodeci signed Elliott’s group, Sista, to his Swing Mob Records label. Sista’s debut album, however, was never released because of a lack of funds, and the group broke up. Elliott subsequently teamed up with childhood friend Timbaland to cowrite and coproduce songs for the American rhythm-and-blues artists Jodeci and Aaliyah. Soon the head of the Elektra Entertainment Group offered her a deal that would enable her to write, produce, and record music under her own Gold Mind record label.\n\nElliott’s first album, Supa Dupa Fly (1997), went platinum and was nominated for a Grammy Award. Her follow-up album, Da Real World (1999), spent almost a year on the Billboard rhythm-and-blues chart. Miss E…So Addictive (2001) featured the crossover dance track “Get Ur Freak On,” and the album won Elliott her first two Grammy Awards. She won a third Grammy for “Work It,” a single from her 2002 album Under Construction. Her 2005 album, The Cookbook, contained the Grammy-winning single “Lose Control.” In addition to her Grammy wins, Elliott collected the Black Entertainment Television (BET) Award for best female hip-hop artist numerous times."
