        "text": "I love a movie. The music, the camera angles, the performances, the way it makes you feel. Everything about them just makes the world better. I fell in love with movies at a young age. First one I can remember watching regularly was Aladdin.\n\nMy mom says after that I was running around the house calling her ‘Jafar’ whenever she would tell me to do something. A clearly opinionated 3 year old everyone. I was always intrigued by the movies and the process. It didn’t matter what kind. I would watch my old video tapes of all kinds of Disney movies and also watch the extra stuff some included and it was normal for my family to see a movie in the theaters.\n\nThe Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers Movie came out just before my 6th birthday. It was a whole event.\n\nI remember first seeing the poster promoting the movie at the old movie theater that used to be at the mall and then they were promoting the movie on commercials for the tv show. I even got to stay up late on a school night (8PM WHAT!) to see the first real trailer. I will tell you my whole world changed seeing something I absolutely loved on day one. We even later ordered it on Pay Per View. Rented the tape from Blockbuster. I owned it on DVD. It’s not on digital which is a travesty but even if HBO randomly shows it or it comes on I catch myself watching it. I could probably play it in my head and remember every line.\n\nMovies have a special effect on all of us. It takes you back to an exact moment in time. An age or time of your life that you forget after the years so I’m glad to still have these small connections in time. We put it out to our listeners on the 107.7 The Bounce Facebook Page and were not disappointed. We were looking for your comfort movie or specifically movies you have seen more than 5 times. So this is a list of some of those very rewatchable films/"
