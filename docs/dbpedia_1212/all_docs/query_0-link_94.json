        "text": "Missy Elliott, the groundbreaking icon of hip-hop/R&B, has unveiled plans for her historic debut headline tour, “OUT OF THIS WORLD: The Missy Elliott Experience,” overshadowing today’s solar phenomenon with a supernova announcement. Joining her on this cosmic journey are hip-hop legend Busta Rhymes, multi-platinum selling superstar Ciara, and mega-producer Timbaland.\n\n“This is an incredible time in my life as I am experiencing so many milestone ‘firsts,'” Elliott shared. “Being the FIRST female hip-hop artist to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and now going out on my FIRST headline tour.”\n\nElliott expressed her anticipation for the tour, stating, “Fans have been asking me to tour forever, but I wanted to wait until I felt the time was right because I knew if I was ever going to do it, I had to do it big, and I had to do it with family! So get ready to be taken OUT OF THIS WORLD with me, Busta Rhymes, Ciara, and Timbaland! We can’t wait to share this experience with the fans!”\n\nProduced by Live Nation in association with Mona Scott-Young, Elliott’s longtime manager and CEO of Monami Entertainment, and represented by Seth Shomes through Day After Day Productions (DADP), the tour will embark on a 24-city journey starting July 4 at Rogers Arena in Vancouver. Stops across North America include Los Angeles, Atlanta, Brooklyn, and more, before concluding on August 22 at Allstate Arena in Rosemont.\n\nScott-Young expressed her excitement, stating, “Missy has always been an iconic groundbreaker and continuously pushes herself to be bolder and go where she has never been before—and surprisingly, one of those places is headlining her own tour!”\n\nShe continued, “For decades, fans and peers worldwide have clamored for Missy to tour, and they’re finally going to get what they’ve been asking for as she teams up with Ciara, Busta, and longtime partner-in-rhyme Timbaland, to deliver a start-to-finish, nonstop, high-octane, OUT OF THIS WORLD concert experience.”\n\nElliott’s forward-thinking vision extended to the tour’s visual concept, as she reunited with longtime collaborators, including director Dave Meyers, celebrity stylist June Ambrose, and creative director Hi-Hat, to bring her intergalactic vision to life.\n\nTICKETS: Tickets will be available starting with Verizon presale (details below) beginning tomorrow, April 9.
