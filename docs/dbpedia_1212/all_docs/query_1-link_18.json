        "text": "In 2019, Missy Elliott made history. The five-time Grammy-winning singer, songwriter, and producer was the first female rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nEven before debuting with Supa Dupa Fly in 1997, Elliott was already writing for and producing other artists. Credited by her real name Melissa A. Elliott, the rapper has written and produced songs for Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, Aaliyah, Destiny’s Child, Mariah Carey, Fantasia, and Monica, from the mid-’90s to the 2010s.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nHere are seven songs Missy Elliott has written for other artists for nearly 30 years.\n\n1. “One In A Million,” Aaliyah (1996)\n\nWritten by Missy Elliott and Timothy Z. Mosley (Timbaland); Produced by Timbaland\n\nComing off the major success of her 1994 debut, Age Ain’t Nothing But a Number, produced by R. Kelly, then newcomers, Missy Elliott and Timbaland, were brought on board to write one song for her second album, which turned into eight tracks, including the hit single “One In a Million.”\n\nIntro’d by Missy Elliott’s sultry refrain of Love it babe, Love it babe, Love it babe, “One In A Million,” written by Elliott and Timbaland and released on Aaliyah’s album of the same name, centers around the excitement of finding real, true love.\n\nBaby, you don’t know what you do to me\n\nBetween me and you I feel a chemistry\n\nI won’t let no one\n\nCome and take your place\n\n‘Cause the love you give, it can’t be replaced\n\nSo, no one else love me like you do\n\nThat’s why I don’t mind to spend my life with you\n\nI want to please you in any way I can\n\nI want to share my world, don’t you understand?\n\nRecorded between August 1995 and July 1996, One In a Million features collaborations with Jermaine Dupri, Darryl Simmons, Carl-So-Lowe, J. Dibbs, Darren Lighty, Kay Gee, Vincent Herbert, Rodney Jerkins, and Craig King with guest appearances from Elliott, Timbaland, Slick Rick, and Treach.\n\nTimbaland and Elliott formed a tight bond with Aaliyah after working on the album and ended up co-writing “Are You Feelin’ Me?” one of several tracks performed by Aaliyah for the soundtrack of the 2000 martial arts action film Romeo Must Die, which featured the late actress in her film debut and first starring role, alongside Jet Li.\n\nThe pair also wrote and composed tracks on Aaliyah’s third and final self-titled album, which was released more than a month before the R&B singer’s untimely death on Aug. 25, 2001, at the age of 22.\n\n2. “Babydoll,” Mariah Carey (1997)\n\nWritten by Missy Elliott and Mariah Carey\n\nReleased on her sixth album Butterfly, “Babydoll,” which was never released as a single, showcases Carey’s buttery vocals dripping over tantalizing lyrics:\n\nZonin’ out thinkin’ about\n\nYou and me between the sheets\n\nI wanna get intimate\n\nBut you’re not within my reach\n\nSo I’ll have a little more wine\n\nAnd I’ll try to drink you out of my head\n\nThe album also features songs written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, tracks produced by Sean “Puff Daddy” Combs, and more, along with a cover of Prince’s Purple Rain track “The Beautiful Ones,” featuring R&B group Dru Hill.\n\n3. “In My Business,” Whitney Houston, featuring Missy Elliott (1998)\n\nWritten and produced by Missy Elliott, Kelvin “K.B.” Bradshaw, and Lloyd “Spec” Turner\n\nOff Whitney Houston’s fourth album, My Love Is Your Love features songs written by everyone from Wyclef Jean, David Foster, Lauryn Hill, and Babyface. Missy Elliott produced and co-wrote “In My Business,” along with Kelvin “K.B.” Bradshaw and Lloyd “Spec” Turner, a song examining some of the outside noise and external jealousies surrounding a relationship.\n\nBaby why I get so many people telling me\n\nThey seen you up in the mall\n\nAre they mistaking\n\nAll up on some chick\n\nAs though I don’t exist\n\nWhat is this\n\nWhy they all in my business\n\nIt’s just too ridiculous\n\nI can’t get no sleep\n\nThey just keep warning me\n\nShould I believe it\n\nThey say I don’t need it\n\nDon’t they know I made up my mind, my mind\n\nThe trio also co-wrote and produced a second track on Houston’s album called “Oh Yes.”\n\n4. “Confessions,” Destiny’s Child, featuring Missy Elliott (1999)\n\nWritten and produced by Missy Elliott, Donald Holmes, and Gerard Thomas\n\nMissy Elliott co-wrote and produced “Confessions” for Destiny’s Child’s second album, The Writing’s on the Wall. The album debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 in 1999, earned Destiny’s Child six Grammy nominations, and was certified platinum eight times, selling more than 6.4 million copies in the U.S. alone. For the Japanese edition of the album, Elliott also penned the track “Get on the Bus” with Timbaland, who is also featured on the track.\n\nHe put his arms around my waist\n\nKnowin’ I need lovin’ then he\n\nGently grabbed my face\n\nHe kissed me like a guy could never\n\nKiss a girl before\n\nSo you know what happened baby\n\nI need to say no more\n\n5. “Where My Girls At?” 702 (1999)\n\nWritten and produced by Missy Ellott, Eric L. Seats, and Rapture D. Stewart\n\nOriginally written for TLC’s third album, FanMail, Missy Elliott ended up producing “Where My Girls At?” with Keybeats for the R&B group 702 as the first single off the group’s self-titled album. Elliott also co-wrote and produced the 702 track “Gotta Leave” with Eric Seats and Rapture Stewart.\n\nNow of these other chicks don’t even come close to you\n\nAnythin’ less than a dime, ain’t negotiable\n\nThere holla Fabolous when I swing the Testarossa through\n\nMaybe cause I’m close to Clue, I be in posters too\n\nI rock so much ice, you need shades for a closer view\n\nI beep the horn, that’s the most I do\n\nLike what this player supposed to do\n\nFuck it, pack your bags, let’s spend the weekend in Costa boo\n\nYou feelin’ that?\n\n6. “Signs,” Beyoncé, featuring Missy Elliott (2003)\n\nWritten and produced by Missy Elliott, Nisan Stewart, and Craig Brockman\n\nMissy returned to work with former Destiny’s Child singer Beyoncé for her 2003 debut, Dangerously in Love, writing the track “Signs.” Though the song was never released as a single, the album earned Beyoncé five Grammy awards in 2004, including Best Contemporary R&B Album.\n\nIn December every sign has it’s own mode\n\nI was in love with a Sagittarius\n\nSee the emotions he put me through\n\nFrom Capricorns to Aquarius\n\nThey all got their different minds\n\nThe affection of a Virgo\n\nWhich sign matches good with mine\n\nI was in love with a Sagittarius he blew my mind\n\nHe also had a flip side too much like a Gemini\n\nHe was freaky like a Taurus the way he handled me yeah\n\nFlirtatious like and Aries\n\nWhich sign is best for me?\n\n7. “Burn It Up!” Janet Jackson, featuring Missy Elliott (2015)\n\nWritten and produced by Missy Elliott, Janet Jackson, Dwayne Allen Abernathy, James Samuel III Harris, and Terry Steven Lewis\n\nMostly a personal collection of songs, Janet Jackson’s 11th album, Unbreakable, explored some subjects close to the artist’s life, including the death of her brother Michael in 2009 and aspects of her childhood. “Burn It Up” is a more uptempo synthesized track that makes a break for the dance floor.\n\nWhen the DJ play this we gon’ dance like no one’s watching\n\nHey Mr DJ, drop that track and won’t you turn it up\n\nI’ma dance all night and I don’t care who’s out there watching us\n\nJust give me that fire and I’ma show you how to burn it up\n\nWhen the DJ play this we gon’ dance like no one’s watching\n\nHey Mr DJ, drop that track and won’t you turn it up\n\nI’ma dance all night and I don’t care who’s out there watching us\n\nJust give me that fire and I’ma show you how to burn it up (come on)\n\n“Burn It Up!” also marked the fourth time Jackson and Elliott collaborated. The two first became friends while working on Jackson’s 1998 hit “Son of a Gun”—off Jackson’s seventh album, All For You—which also featured Carly Simon, who also helped co-write the track.\n\nPhoto: Atlantic Records"
