        "text": "Missy Elliott is an icon, and there’s no doubt about it. Born in Virginia, the 52-year-old cemented her legacy as one of Hip-Hop and R&B’s most innovative creators as an artist, producer, and songwriter. With decades in the game, the all-star performer has put in the work and is heralded among past, present, and future musicians who reference her work in song and style.\n\n“For me, it’s always going to be first, Missy Elliott,” Lil Wayne explained when asked about his personal Hip-Hop heroes. “She’s a huge influence on everything I’ve ever done.”\n\nBeyond Weezy F Baby, the 4-time Grammy Award winner’s influence can be seen, heard, and felt through a new generation, including work from artists including Bree Runway, Chlöe, LAYA, Baby Tate, Rico Nasty, Flyana Boss, Lizzo, Leikeli47, CHIKA, Kari Faux, Tyler, the Creator, Flo Milli, and more.\n\nThe most recent artist to sample the Supa Dupa Fly queen is Cardi B who laid her own confident rhymes over a modern take on Missy Elliott’s iconic 1999 single “She’s a B***h” with “Like What (Freestyle).”\n\nWhile rap fans have added fuel to otherwise feeble flames between the two artists, calling out the Bronx chart-topper for the sample which was recently used by Boston hitmaker BIA last year. Missy Elliott herself showed love to both Millenial rappers per HipHopDX, appreciating both unique takes on her record.\n\nThe simple truth is, when paying homage to Missy Elliott however, it is nearly impossible to avoid crossover. In fact, according to the online database WhoSampled, there are over 400 songs that lend credit to the first woman rapper to be inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nTake a look below for eight tracks released in the past five years that pay homage to Missy Elliott’s legacy through sampling."
