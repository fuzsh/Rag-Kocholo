        "text": "\"When watching my film tonight, know that I am human,\" Shipp said. \"Know that your words and your opinions are your own and that you may think you know, but until we speak face 2 face, you'll never truly know who I am. That's ok. I can't wait to meet each and every one of my fans one day. Because I'm a fan of them too! I work hard, I put all my effort into whatever I do. At the end of the day I'm just a normal girl who got the opportunity of a lifetime and wouldn't let that go for anything or anyone.\"\n\n\"Because that's what dreams are: they're YOURS,\" she said \"I'm following mine. I encourage and support EVERYONE in doing that for themselves. Because God put this role in my lap, I believe that, and I wasn't going to throw a gift like that away. Y'all can hate, y'all can debate, but one thing the critics won't do is win. God bless and please watch my movie.\"\n\nAaliyah began her singing career as a teenager. Her 1994 debut album was titled Age Ain't Nothing but a Number. Over the next decade, she released hits such as \"Back & Forth,\" \"Try Again,\" \"One in a Million\" and \"Miss You\" and collaborations with fellow artists and producers Timbaland, Missy Elliot and R. Kelly, who are depicted in the movie. The latter star has not commented about the film.\n\nAaliyah and R. Kelly secretly wed when she was 15 and he was 28. The marriage was later annulled. The controversy is addressed in Aaliyah: The Princess of R&B. Her death is as well, at the end, and the crash is not shown.\n\nAaliyah: The Princess of R&B aired several times on Lifetime on Saturday and spurred #AaliyahthePrincessofRandB and #AaliyahMovie to trend on Twitter all night. Also trending: Wendy Williams and Zendaya, who was the first actress to be given the title role and left the production following criticism over her casting, saying it \"wasn't the right\" movie for her and that the project felt \"rushed.\"\n\nCheck out five key moments and Twitter users' reactions to them below.\n\n1. Aaliyah finds her signature look...but it's a little inconsistent\n\nHer mother, a vocalist and her manager, played by Rachael Crawford, suggests to the singer to change her look by covering one eye with her hair to showcase mystery, taking a page from late '40s film noir femme fatale Veronica Lake."
