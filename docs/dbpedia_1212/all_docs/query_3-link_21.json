        "text": "We’ve been saying Missy Elliott’s talent is otherworldly for years. Now, that statement is officially true.\n\nAccording to Billboard, on Friday, the music legend’s classic track, “The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly),” was transmitted to deep space. It’s the first hip-hop song to get this honor, and it seems very fitting that it is bestowed upon Missy. Using its Deep Space Network, the transmission originated from NASA‘s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California and was sent all the way to Venus.\n\nThe hip-hop pioneer marveled at the moment on social media, writing on X, “YOOO this is crazy! We just went #OutOfThisWorld with NASA and sent the FIRST hip hop song into space through the Deep Space Network. My song ‘The Rain’ has officially been transmitted all the way to Venus, the planet that symbolizes strength, beauty, and empowerment. The sky is not the limit, it’s just the beginning.”\n\nFans had a lot of fun celebrating Missy’s latest groundbreaking accomplishment. There were a lot of dancing alien memes going around, with one fan writing on X, “Miss Missy, you’ve always been a trend setter. I can’t wait to see the aliens jamming to your music!”\n\nAnother person appreciated the synergy of the moment, posting, “This is SO EPIC ! Literally #OutOfThisWorld ! “The Rain” is finally being played for its native people lol.”\n\nSomeone else wants aliens to reenact the famous video, writing on X, “This is sooo dope Miss. We gotta get the aliens some trash bags so they can have the full effect. Keep pushing the needle forward! This is Hip Hop history!”\n\nWhen Missy released “The Rain” in 1997 it was heralded as a new sound in hip-hop. The way she and Timbaland combined her melodic flow with sharp beats felt futuristic — it was a stark contrast to the masculine, overly boastful rap music that dominated the genre at the time.\n\nNASA could’ve chosen any hip-hop legend for this honor, but they specifically went with a woman. This may not seem like a big deal, but in a genre where female artists haven’t always been given their due, it’s pretty badass that the first transmission in deep space is by a woman."
