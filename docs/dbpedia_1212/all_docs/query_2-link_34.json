        "text": "They are both so deserving!\n\nIcons Regina King and Missy Elliott are both honored on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame, Essence reports.\n\nOn Thursday veteran actress Regina King cemented herself on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Los Angeles native started at just 14 years old, playing an iconic role on the hit ‘80s sitcom 227. She continued portraying classic characters and snagged her first film, the 1991 hit movie Boyz in the Hood. King became a cultural staple in many homes, starring in films and TV shows like Poetic Justice, Higher Learning, This Christmas, If Beale Street Could Talk, The Boondocks, where she voiced both Huey & Riley, American Crime, and HBO’s Watchmen.\n\nKing has received an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and multiple Emmys for her work. Last year she made her directorial debut with her film, One Night in Miami. The 50-year-old actress was joined outside the TCL Chinese Theatre IMAX in Hollywood by Ava DuVernay, Logan Browning, and close family and friends. When it was time for her to cement her hand imprint, King chose to put both her bare hands and feet in her star along with a personalized message that read, “there’s no place like home,” a homage to “227” and her Los Angeles upbringing.\n\n“A lot of people are gonna see this and they’re going to think it comes from ‘The Wizard of Oz,’ but it comes from my beginning ‘227,’ where the theme song started off ‘no place like home’ ‘cuz this is home,” King said. “And I’m gonna be home forever and ever and ever and ever!”\n\nShe told reporters that she was amazed when she first saw the landmark as a young girl.\n\n“I remember that I was looking for Bette Davis’s hand and footprints. That’s all I wanted to see. But the thing that struck me was why it took me so long to find her footprints is because I kept getting hit with someone else’s,” King said.\n\nHer new film, The Harder They Fall, co-starring Idris Elba, Jonathan Majors, and Zazie Beats, premiers on Netflix this November 3rd.\n\nGrammy award-winning rapper, singer, songwriter, and producer Missy Elliott is also set to get her star on the Walk of Fame. For three decades in the industry, Elliott has set and raised the bar for creativity and innovation, earning five Grammy awards and making history as the first female hip-hop artist to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nElliott will be joined alongside artists Ciara and Lizzo and manager Mona Scott-Young. The multi-faceted creative is also the first female hip-hop artist to receive an honorary doctorate of music from Berklee College of Music.\n\n“Missy Elliott has broken through the barriers of the male-dominated Hip Hop world and music industry as a whole, as she has led the way for many women who have followed in her footsteps. She continues to break barriers year after year, and we’re thrilled to be able to honor her on the Walk of Fame,” Ana Martinez, Hollywood Walk of Fame producer, said.\n\nElliott will receive her star in an official ceremony on Monday, November 8th at 11:30 am PST, Essence reports.\n\nCongratulations, Regina and Missy! Because of you both, we can!\n\nPhotos Courtesy of Getty Images"
