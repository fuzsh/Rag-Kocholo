        "text": "Why does Marty Stuart wear those neck scarfs around his neck?\n\nOne of his band members got drunk and went to get a tattoo in Clarksville. Marty went to talk the fella out of it. An altercation ensued and Marty was knocked unconscious in the parking lot. His band member (former) dragged him into the tattoo parlor and had a large Duroc hog tattooed across the front of Marty's neck. Both the band member and tattoo artist soon realized the error of their act and fled to Belize never to be heard from again. Marty, unfortunately, was left with the permanent decoration. He's worn the scarf ever since.\n\nWho pays a record label for artist sales?\n\nFor the sale of physical records (i.e. CDs, tapes, mini-discs, etc...) labels are paid through a distributor who is responsible for the manufacture and distribution of the physical product. These distributors sell the records to retailers such as Tower Records or f.y.e who in turn sell them to consumers. Major labels handle their own distribution. The artists are entitled to a negotiated royalty payment from the sale of each record. For sales through download services such as eMusic, Rhapsody, or iTunes the record labels have individual agreements that allow for a certain percentage of the sales of their music to be paid by the online retailer. For public performance royalties, that is royalties paid for song performances on the internet, TV, clubs, restaurants, or concert venues for example, performance rights organizations (PROs) such as SoundExchange, ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC are responsible for the collection and distribution of royalty payments to member artists. Virtually every artist is a member of most if not all of these organizations."
