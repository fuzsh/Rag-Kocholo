        "text": "Melissa Arnette \"Missy\" Elliott (born July 1, 1971), also known as Misdemeanor, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. She has widely been referred to as the \"Queen of Rap\" by the media and has received numerous accolades, including four Grammy Awards. Her overall discography has sold 40 million records worldwide, making her the best-selling woman rapper in Nielsen Music history according to Billboard. She was the first woman rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and received the MTV VMAs Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award for her impact on the music video landscape. In 2023, she became the first woman rapper to be nominated and inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2023, she was featured on the track \"Told Ya\" from Chlöe's debut studio album, In Pieces. Bailey told Rolling Stone of this collaboration, \"Missy has been one of my biggest inspirations for a very, very, very, very, very long time. I was just happy and honored that I got to have her voice grace my debut album. When I received her vocals, I cried on the floor for 20 minutes. On a record that I wrote to tell everyone who's underestimated me, 'I told you I'd make it' even though I fully didn't believe it myself—for her to be on that record specifically, it really meant a lot. It's almost like proving to myself that, hey Chlöe, you are doing it. You're on the right path\".[1] The two also happen to share the same birthday.\n\nCollaborations[]\n\nTitle Year Artist(s) Contribution Album \"Told Ya\" 2023 Chlöe Vocals, co-writer In Pieces"
