        "text": "Coming on the back of a stellar debut year in 2021, garnering strong support from the likes of BBC 1Xtra, KISS Fresh, Earmilk GRM Daily and Mixtape Madness, Up and coming Birmingham’s rapper WOHDEE returns with the catchy and infectious drill offering ‘Wauww’,the first single from her upcoming debut EP that arrives later this year.\n\nProduced by Jacques Charles, who has also worked with Nadia Rose, Wretch 32 and Jammer, ‘Wauww’ sees Wohdee flexing her braggadocios lyrics, confident flow and intricate wordplay over the catchy drill soundscape, which shows a different layer to her artistry. For the accompanying music video, Wohdee has linked up with Leon Matthews (Stefflon Don, Fredo, Tion Wayne) for a fun visual that shows off her personality and future star power.\n\nSpeaking about the inspiration behind ‘Wauww’, Wohdee says, “I had never made a drill song before, and I wanted to make one, but change the narrative a bit, since I’m not involved in the drill type of lifestyle lol. I remember being at my job thinking of double entendres for drill slang like ‘splash’, ‘dip’, ‘run man down’ etc… When I finished my shift, I wrote it all down and got in the studio. The video is basically just me, having fun with my mates; a good vibe zone”.\n\nWhile her early freestyles caused quite the stir and highlighted her immense talent, Wohdee only started recording original music during the first lockdown – music that has since found acclaim from the likes of BBC 1Xtra, KISS Fresh and Capital Xtra. With influences from the likes of Chip, Lauryn Hill, Missy Elliot and Movado, a strong penchant for rap music, and the skill and fluidity to dip between genres, Wohdee is already showing that she is one to watch for 2022.\n\nCheck out the video below…\n\nBrooklyn bred/Los Angeles based R&B artist PUNK ADAMS just released his new single and visuals for ‘Boo.’ Exploring a new love and taking a bold approach with someone he’s interested in, Punk put his feelings on the table, singing: ”I done had a few but there ain’t none like you.”\n\nPunk confides, “I wrote ‘Boo’ to showcase more confidence in self. I wasn’t always confident in my size and appearance, so it made it difficult to talk to people out of fear of rejection. This time I wanted to put myself out there in a more flirtatious way, seeing someone I like and taking a chance.”\n\nDuring his writing camp, Punk Adams worked with producer “Titus E Johnson“ to create a fun and flirtatious song inspired by the 90s hip hop & RnB songs he grew up on, such as the innovative sounds of Pharrell and Missy Elliot. With its playful melodies, catchy lyrics, and vibrant sound, ‘Boo’ comes just in time for cuffing season.\n\nPunk Adams has received acclaim from the likes of Billboard, Afropunk, Earmilk, BBC Radio 1, Slay and added to Spotify’s “Fresh Finds” playlist. Check him out below…\n\nBrooklyn-based record producer THE 83rd gets ready to drop a stirring remix of Eryn Allen Kane’s soulful yet minimalist track Have Mercy next month.\n\nThe rework opens with beautifully layered vocals which echo hauntingly into the resonant soundscapes and as with the original track, Eryn’s soulful vocals take centre stage. In its focused minimalism it drips with sonic emotion, bringing a new depth to an already striking track.\n\nThe accomplished producer, real name Will McNair, has produced for Cheryl Cole as well as produced, engineered and mixed Angel Haze’s hugely influential New York’ which received praise from The Guardian, Pitchfork, and VICE. He has been commissioned to make remixes for Missy Elliott and Mariah Carey, whilst his rework of Tinashe’s ‘Boss’ featured on a collaborative remix EP with Giraffage and Ryan Hemsworth.\n\nAs one half of electronic production duo Chopstix with Ski Beatz, who has worked with international stars including hip-hop heavyweights Mos Def, Wiz Khalifa and Jay Z, THE 83rd has also produced and remixed tracks by Nicole Wray, Cam’ron and Locksmith.\n\nThe remix Eryn’s Have Mercy is out on 12th February….for now, have a sample – it would be a crying shame to pass up on this epic track!\n\nDay’s song is You’re the One by JENNIE B.\n\nHailing from Ireland, this hip-hop princess is no stranger to the stage – from the age of 11, she performed at the Westend and Disneyland Paris. By the late teens, she decided to take care her career to another level by taking singing lessons.\n\nJENNIE B had itchy feet and moved to the Big Apple to pursue her career as a recording artist…and she meant business! As well as working along with choreographers who trained up JANET JACKSON, RIHANNA and MISSY ELLIOT, she fine-tuned her vocals with singing coach Norma Garbo who also perfected the vocals of TAYLOR SWIFT – and went on tour with SCISSORS SISTERS as their voice coach.\n\nShe took a liking to the underground hip-hop scene and released a video to her track, All The Boys. Produced by the all-rounder artist, the video received over 60,000 views on YouTube. Despite having with minimal promotion, the video found its way to EMI and Ultra Records and generated interest amongst renowned DJs and rappers.\n\nSo let’s see if You’re the One will push her right to the top. This track perfectly sums up JENNIE B – fun with twist of Rnb, pop, hip-hop and dance – have a listen! If you’re feeling this track, head over to her on Twitter and show your appreciation @JennieBmusic."
