        "text": "Synopsis\n\nMissy Elliott, a famous female rapper, is about to achieve something big by getting into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. In an interview with Robin Roberts on \"Good Morning America,\" Missy talks about her journey and how she got her unique nickname, \"Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliott.\" She also shares her childhood dream of becoming a superstar and how grateful she is for this honor. Queen Latifah will introduce her at the ceremony. Missy talks about her shyness, her struggles with anxiety, and her health issues, giving us a glimpse into her extraordinary life and career.\n\nWell-known rapper, Missy Elliott is all set to etch her name into the esteemed Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as the very first female rapper. During an exclusive interview with Robin Roberts on \"Good Morning America\", the four-time Grammy Award winner offered a peek into her life, in anticipation of the monumental career milestone.\n\nUnder her iconic alias, Missy \"Misdemeanor\" Elliott, she playfully unveiled the story behind her distinctive moniker, a moniker bequeathed to her by none other than Magoo of Timbaland & Magoo. Missy humorously recounted, \"He named me that. He said, 'It was a crime to have as many talents as I had.'\"\n\nSince her early days, the \"Work It\" sensation harbored an unwavering aspiration to ascend to stardom, firmly asserting, \"I never wavered. I never changed. I said it every time.\"\n\nGazing back upon her storied career in the music industry, the 52-year-old virtuoso candidly expressed her deep-seated honor at being chosen as an inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, especially considering her roots in the world of hip-hop, where such recognition might once have appeared elusive.\n\nDuring the forthcoming induction ceremony, the illustrious Queen Latifah will have the distinct privilege of introducing Missy Elliott. Missy underscored the pivotal role Queen Latifah has played in paving the way, noting, \"And I owe so many flowers, bouquets. It's not enough bouquets for those women that came before me. And she's one of those women.\"\n\nA particularly poignant moment will transpire with the presence of Missy Elliott's mother, who has never before had the chance to witness her daughter's live performances. Missy revealed with heartfelt sincerity, \"She's never been to a show because, you know, I had some little words I didn't ever want her to hear.\" This forthcoming event holds profound significance for both mother and daughter.\n\nRenowned for her reticence, Missy Elliott unveiled that nobody has ever had the privilege of hearing her record music. She explained, \"I was always, like, too shy to do it in front of anybody… Ya'll would be lookin' at me crazy… so I've never recorded in front of anybody. Nobody.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Missy Elliott also delved into her experiences with anxiety, recounting a poignant moment when she joined Katy Perry onstage at the 2015 Super Bowl and found herself in the emergency room just hours before the performance. She expressed her appreciation for the increasing societal openness to discussing anxiety, recognizing the widespread prevalence of this condition.\n\nMissy Elliott also spoke about her health condition, after getting diagnosed with Graves' disease in 2008. The Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder which affects the thyroid gland. She talked about the profound impact the disease on her nervous system and mental well-being. Missy has since dedicated herself to self-care and mentoring the emerging generation of creative talents, particularly through platforms like TikTok.\n\nWhen contemplating her journey, Missy Elliott had some heartfelt advice for her younger self, asserting, \"I would tell her, 'You know what? There is a bright future for you, and keep going.'\" She acknowledged the distinctiveness of her talents and the enduring influence she has wielded within the music industry.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
