        "text": "First it was induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as the inaugural female hip-hop artist.\n\nThen, the announcement that after a 25-plus year career a first-ever headlining tour would be unveiled this summer.\n\nAdd to that a prominent role in Pharrell Williams’ currently untitled movie project about his life and clearly, it’s a Missy Elliott-palooza.\n\nOn July 4, a few days after she turns 53, Elliott will embark on the Out of This World tour with co-stars Busta Rhymes and Ciara, as well as Timbaland, who has known Elliott since high school and helped innovate smashes including “The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly),” “Hit Em Wit Da Hee,” “Get Ur Freak On” and “Work It.”\n\nThe 30-date run, which kicks off in Vancouver, will wind through Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Houston, Tampa, Atlanta, Baltimore, Brooklyn and Philadelphia among its stops.\n\nElliott, who lives in Atlanta, is also filming the Williams movie in Richmond, Virginia – both hail from the Virginia Beach area – while prepping for her tour. She'll star alongside Oscar winner Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Oscar nominee Brian Tyree Henry and fellow music luminary Janelle Monáe.\n\nHere is what Elliott had to say about this fulfilling period in her life.\n\nMore: 50 essential hip-hop songs to celebrate 50 years: Grandmaster Flash, Jay-Z, Outkast, more\n\nQuestion: Your performance at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame ceremony in November was electrifying. What was going through your mind that night after being inducted as the first female rapper?\n\nAnswer: Whenever I go into any performance it’s a lot of thought process, from the clothes to what songs you’re going to perform to the dances. I think most of the time I’m engulfed in everything. But this time I felt like I was floating because I was in the room and watching many artists that had been around for way longer than I have just getting into the Rock Hall. It’s still a pinch-me moment, like \"Wow, I’m here.\" … Until stuff like that happens, like (being inducted into) the Songwriters Hall of Fame, those things felt like they were so out of reach until I was on that stage.\n\nWith you, Eminem, LL Cool J and several other hip-hop artists getting into the Rock Hall, do you think they’ve improved their acknowledgement of the genre?\n\nIt’s a good thing, an amazing thing, and hopefully me being the first female, it opens the door for other females and hip-hop artists in general because it has had such an impact on so many genres of music. I go to Japan and all of the stores are playing nothing but hip-hop.\n\nIt’s hard to believe this is your first headlining tour, so why now?\n\nMy first tour was Lilith Fair (in 1998). Then I did Rock the Mic with Jay-Z and 50 Cent (in 2003), and my last tour (in 2004) was me, Beyoncé, Alicia (Keys) and Tamia. I had the opportunities to tour alone, but because I was so engulfed in writing and producing for myself and other artists, I never felt like I wanted to be out that long without being able to continue doing that. But then one day I was like, \"I want to go out.\" My management, they didn’t believe me. But my manager called me the next day and said, “Are you serious?” and I said, \"Yeah, I want to go out.\" I believe God aligned it. Mentally, I was ready. Physically, I was ready.\n\nWhy is it called the Out of This World tour?\n\nThe first thing I thought of is anything that I have done sonically, musically, visually has been kind of out of this world. I felt even Busta, who I’ve watched before I even came along, has been that way, too. And Ciara and Tim(baland), his music has been futuristic. So that title was fitting for all of us. I believe we all embody being out of this world.\n\nWhat can you share about the show or production?\n\nIt’s going to be a little bit of everything. I’m biting my nails wanting to tell what will happen, but I want everybody to come and see it. I can tell you the energy is going to be through the roof. I tell people bring your slides, no heels, no shoes, because you’re gonna dance the whole night.\n\nSince touring isn’t typical, how are you preparing?\n\nIt’s most definitely a grind. You have to be in a good mental space. I have Busta and Ciara and Timba out there so it’s going to feel like family and not, I’m going to work. On top of that, I have a physical therapist I’m starting with and they put these big things on my legs to loosen everything up. And I have to start eating right. I am most definitely putting down any sweets, and that is hardest thing for me. I’m gonna eat my last cupcake in a week. But I hike the mountains every day.\n\nMore: Hip-Hop legends Big Daddy Kane, Melle Mel celebrate the genre's 50th anniversary\n\nIs there anything you have to bring with you on the road?\n\nMy (Yorkie) dog, Fendi. I lost one of my dogs in November and that crushed me, so she’s like my best friend. She calms my anxiety. She’s living her best life. She’s in a couple of Instagram photos (on my page), and she has her own page and her own fans.\n\nAs you get ready for a headlining tour and look back at what you’ve accomplished, do you feel you’ve become a pioneer for women in hip-hop?"
