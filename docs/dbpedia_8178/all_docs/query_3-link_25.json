He was appointed Professor of Physics and Director of the Quantum Institute at UCSB in 1991, and served as Chair of Physics, 2000-05. In 2009 he became emeritus and was appointed Research Professor of Physics until 2018. Prior to that, he was a member of technical staff at Bell Labs, recognized as a “Distinguished Member of Technical Staff”, availed himself of a Bell Labs supported leave at the Royal School of Mines , Imperial College London and later joined Bellcore, as District Research Manager of Solid State Physics Research. He has also been an adjunct professor at Northeastern University and at Princeton University. Professional service included election as Member at Large of the Executive Committee of the Division of Condensed Matter Physics of the A.P.S. where he served on the Strategic Planning Committee and on the Nominating Committee. He has also served on the Editorial Board of Physical Review. In 1995 he won a Humboldt Science Award, is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science."
