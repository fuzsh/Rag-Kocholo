        "text": "Written by Reverend Jac D. Perrin, Ph.D. ‘86\n\nWalking on the North Central University campus, at the corner of 14th Street and Elliot Avenue, a beautifully designed bell tower is visible as part of the Trask Word and Worship Center building. Scores of students pass by this monument to Dr. James Allen daily, but very few know who Dr. Allen was or how well he served the school as Chairman of the Pastoral Studies Department for almost 30 years.\n\nDr. Allen and his wife, Fran, were hired by the school in 1981 at a time of major transition. The current Department Chair, John Phillipps, was planning for retirement in 1982 and NCU was in need of a Godly leader to replace him. Dr. Jim Allen was a pastor from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, who had a sterling reputation as a strong pastoral leader, a South Dakota district official, and a beloved community leader. He also had something very rare in that day and age; he had an earned Ph.D. from a theological institution. Before North Central became fully accredited, many faculty were teaching full-time while earning their terminal degrees, making Dr. Allen an anomaly.\n\nIn the early 1980’s, North Central was still North Central Bible College (not yet University), and with the imminent departure of John Phillipps, the largest department in the college, Pastoral Studies, needed a new leader who could provide superior leadership. Dr. Jim Allen was just the person NCBC required. He was extremely well-connected with pastors from all over the country, as well as missionaries posted throughout the globe. He was not only well respected by everyone, but he was also trusted and loved.\n\nDr. Allen was a natural builder. He knew instinctively how to manage a department full of young academics who each had diverse views on life, ministry, and theology. Dr. Allen was an expert at handling the every day conflicts which arose inevitably as part of regular business amongst young and ambitious leaders.\n\nTemperamentally, he was perhaps more introverted than many people realized, even to a level of occasional shyness, especially when it came to receiving praise and accolades. He was simply modest and slightly uncomfortable whenever the spotlight was upon him. Dr. Allen was most comfortable being the bestower of encouragement rather than the recipient of it. In fact, encouragement of others was one of his strongest spiritual gifts. It was not at all uncommon to leave his office feeling so optimistic and hopeful because he had just managed to vanquish worries and fears common to an undergraduate student.\n\nPhysically, Dr. Allen was a large man with a great and loud laugh which made him fun to be near. Most students just loved to hang out near his office door, which was open almost constantly. He had a prodigious memory for names. Because of this, he related well to students. Often, we would discover that he knew someone’s parents or other people back home in our lives. This was another reason students simply enjoyed being around him.\n\nDr. Allen was popular as a teacher because of his penchant for illustrating biblical truths with personal stories and anecdotes. His stories were gems to be valued and applied throughout a life of ministry. He was wise, but in a very self-effacing way. He was only comfortable with glory being given to God. His genuine humility made it difficult for him to receive a personal compliment.\n\nHe was laconic and stoic about most things that tended to get others worked up easily. I often recall him dismissing a slightly morose lamentation and proclamation of imminent disaster with a casual reminder that God still has everything under control. Dr. Allen knew how to provide an antidote to the typical negativity so common amongst first year students. He knew the sky was not falling and he was kind in how he declared it thus.\n\nFinally, Dr. Allen was funny. He possessed a dry and sardonic wit. He could leave a crowd bellowing with laughter and delighting in the humor which he so easily dispensed as a brief aside or a well-timed irony.\n\nHis success in life spread to whatever he put his hand. He had God’s blessing. Under his leadership, Pastoral and Youth Ministry majors grew substantially.\n\nToday Dr. Jim Allen still has friends all over the world. As of last Friday, about midnight, he moved from his home in Texas, to his new place in Heaven. All of us remaining behind will be so happy to see him again in Eternity. Let us look up every time we pass by the Allen tower on campus in anticipation of the day when our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ returns to take us to live in His presence forever. It will be good to see Dr. Allen again too!"
