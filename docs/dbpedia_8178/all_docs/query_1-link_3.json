Having lost touch with his family in Weatherfield not long after leaving the country, the elder Tom asks his grandson to find Ena and persuade her to come and stay at his log cabin between Omaha and Sioux City, Nebraska, putting up the air fare himself, when the latter is due in the UK for work purposes. The younger Tom works for a travel agent in Omaha, who does package tours of Europe and he has been dispatched to the UK to check out the hotels.\n\nIn order to trace Ena, Tom uses a firm of solicitors who put an ad in a local Weatherfield paper asking her to contact them, using her maiden name and last known address of 65 Inkerman Street. Ena, now a widow and living in the vestry of the Glad Tidings Mission Hall, sees the ad and gets in touch. She is informed only that someone would soon contact her and has no idea who is behind the ad until Tom turns up at her door.\n\nEna is very happy to learn that her brother is alive and well and still thinks about her. Tom acquaints her with the Schofield line going back to her brother and reads a letter from him in which he talks about his childhood memories of her, which moves her to tears. Startled to receive the invitation to visit him, Ena wavers on accepting as she is set in her ways and is fearful about flying for the first time. It is only when Annie Walker scoffs at the very idea of her going to America that she announces she is taking up her brother's offer.\n\nTom is in the area a little while longer before flying home with Ena. In that time he samples Ena's Lancashire hotpot, and defends her when Lionel Petty confronts her over a neighbourhood boycott of the Corner Shop she's enacted. He also has a minor spat with Len Fairclough when Elsie Tanner accepts a drink from Tom causing a jealous Len to walk out of the Rovers Return Inn.\n\nOver the next eight years, Tom marries Faye-Marie and settles in Manchester, Connecticut. In 1973, Tom and Faye-Marie plan a visit to the UK to see the Manchester Festival. A week before they leave, Ena's brother Tom dies in his sleep; Tom and Faye-Marie deliver this news to Ena in person upon their arrival in Weatherfield. Ena takes the news well, finding comfort in the fact that he hadn't suffered.\n\nTom is not interested in sight-seeing and spends most of the three-week stay in Coronation Street, socialising with Ena's friends and neighbours. He also helps out at the Community Centre's Manchester Festival day by serving at the juice counter. On most of these occasions, he is not accompanied by his wife. A notable exception is the Street outing to Woburn Abbey. Tom makes the most of the visit by bringing along his camera and taking photographs of the animals at Woburn Safari Park. He and Faye-Marie are delighted when Ena introduces them to The Duke of Bedford.\n\nUnlike her husband, Faye-Marie loves to visit new places and wants to experience as much British culture and history as she can. She fancies herself an intellectual and seeks out others for the type of stimulating conversation she does not get from Tom. Despite this, their marriage is a happy one. While in Weatherfield, she latches onto Ken Barlow, a fellow liberal-minded teacher. Their attachment worries Ena, who asks Tom and Faye-Marie why they hardly spend any time together. Tom explains to her that they had an open marriage, which concerns her all the more. Faye-Marie and Ken convince Ena that they are only friends and when Tom demonstrates faith in his wife, Ena accepts that their marriage works for them, even if she does not understand it. The Schofields later return home.\n\nArthur WalkerCoronation Street characterPortrayed byJack AllenDuration1965, 1969First appearance30 June 1965\n\nEpisode 475Last appearance5 November 1969\n\nEpisode 925ClassificationFormer; recurringCreated byHoward BakerIntroduced byH.V.
