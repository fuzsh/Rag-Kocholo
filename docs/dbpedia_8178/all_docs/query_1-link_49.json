        "text": "Coronation Street fans claim to have spotted Kelly Neelan's return to the soap - thanks to her 'double'. The character, played by Millie Gibson, was last seen in Weatherfield back in 2022.\n\nDuring actress Millie's time on the ITV soap, she wasn't short of challenging, dramatic, and emotional storylines. She was part of the shocking hate crime storyline, inspired by the tragic story of Sophie Lancaster who was killed in 2007. It saw Kelly find herself charged with a murder she didn't commit after Seb Franklin died from his injuries when Corey Brent and his mates set upon him and his girlfriend Nina Lucas.\n\nThanks to Nina, played by Mollie Gallagher, Tanisha Gorey's character Asha Alahan, and Stu Carpenter, played by Bill Fellows, Kelly was eventually cleared as Corey finally got his comeuppance. But the teen ended up homeless upon her release after a stay in sheltered accommodation ended with her being targeted.\n\nREAD MORE: Coronation Street's Sally Dynevor appears ageless with lookalike daughter after co-star's 'gorgeous' response\n\nREAD MORE: Read more of our Coronation Street stories here\n\nBut before her exit, the character found out about her dad's death days before her mum Laura Neelan - played by Kel Allen - also died from cancer, in tragic scenes, after taking the rap for her husband Rick's murder so that the real culprit, Gary Windass, could be her guardian with wife Maria.\n\nAnd the drama didn't stop right up until her exit as Corrie viewers saw Kelly's attempts to right her dad's wrongs - by giving money back to the people he ripped off over the years - go drastically wrong, finding herself panic-stricken and a prisoner in a darkened cellar after meeting one of her dad’s evil old clients, Kieron.\n\nAfter eventually being set free, she later called on those who kidnapped her as when she was set to marry Aadi Alahan, she discovered that Gary had in fact killed her dad, Rick. After taking out an aborted hit on Gary, Kelly later called a truce with him and left Weatherfield for a life free of her troubled past.\n\nBut it seems Corrie fans have spotted a likeness in one of Weatherfield's latest newcomers, simply credited for now as 'Sabrina's mate'. During Monday night's (June 24) episode of Corrie, viewers saw evil solicitor Joel Deering conveniently bump into Sabrina in the precinct, where they both had a coffee. Joel then tempted Sabrina with alcohol as he poured some into her coffee and pretended to pour some into his cup but he didn't.\n\nSeemingly trying to impress Sabrina, who was a bit of love rival to his victim Lauren Bolton when she first arrived in Weatherfield, Joel told her she reminded him of an ex, adding that he was \"punching\" with his former partner, leaving the teen flattered.\n\nHowever, later on, Sabrina's mate headed over and pointed out Joel was a creep, warning she should steer clear. She took his card and pretended to chuck it in the bin, only to keep it for herself. And later, viewers seemingly saw why as the currently unknown newcomer confronted Joel and tried to blackmail him, warning she has a \"big gob\" and would expose his creepy behaviour.\n\nAnd it seems Corrie fans couldn't help but point out the character's likeness to Kelly. @StuartBeckMP said: \"Sabrina's mate is reminding me a bit of Kelly Neelan. #corrie.\" @fansvfavourites commented: \"kelly neelan 3.0! #Corrie.\" @tomphillips1999 wrote: \"Thought that was Kelly.\" @trouserboi1 echoed: \"Thought that was Kelly lol.\" @soaps_editzz added: \"She’s the double of Kelly Neelan!\"\n\nMeanwhile, others think they have worked out her identity. @Wee_Westie29 said: \"Just a thought, what if Sabrina’s mystery unnamed friend (the one who is blackmailing Joel) is Betsy - DS Swain’s daughter? #Corrie #CoronationStreet.\" @CitizenC88 commented: \"Sabrina’s mate looks a lot like DS Swain, is this her daughter? It’s gonna go down for Joel in #Corrie!\"\n\n@thesatspage2007 posted: \"She’s a cute girl. Maybe Swains daughter!\" @liam_craig_evans wrote: \"As a guess DS Swains daughter as she is supposed to be appearing.\" @isladepee shared: \"Swains daughter 100%\" @liam_craig_evans added: \"As a guess DS swains daughter as she is supposed to be appearing.\""
