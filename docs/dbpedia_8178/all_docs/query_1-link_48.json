        "text": "Former Coronation Street star James Craven has been spotted in a completely different look on House of the Dragon.\n\nJames, who is known for his role as Aaron Sandford on the ITV soap, was Summer Spellman's (played by Harriet Bibby) partner and left Weatherfield last year after a dark storyline involving the harrowing rape of his friend Amy Barlow (Elle Mulvaney).\n\nOver a year since he left the cobbles, James made an appearance in the first episode of the second season of the Game of Thrones prequel, House of the Dragon which aired on Monday, 17 June. He played a Stark family member who joined the Night's Watch.\n\nViewers were taken aback to see him in the episode, looking quite different from his time on Corrie. His character on the HBO series sports a 'bowl-cut' hairstyle and wears an outfit that's a far cry from what Aaron used to wear.\n\nFans took to Reddit to share their reactions to James' new role. One user commented this week: \"Look's like Aaron's off to join the Night's Watch.\"\n\nAnother chimed in: \"Good catch. It's nice seeing the younger actors get work after leaving [Corrie].\"\n\nAnother viewer who recognised him said: \"I knew I recognised him from something, it was bugging me! \" Similarly, another fan added: \"I noticed him but couldn't place where I'd seen him.\"\n\nA fifth person in the thread confirmed: \"I was SURE that was him.\"\n\nAside from his role in the HBO series, James has also made appearances in the Netflix comedy series Geek Girl after leaving Corrie. He's believed to have played the character Ollie in six episodes of the streaming giant's show.\n\nHe's not the only Corrie star to make an appearance on House of the Dragon though. Jamie Kenna, who portrayed Phill Whittaker, Fiz Brown's (Jennie McAlpine) ex-husband, has taken on the role of Ser Alfred Broome on the show.\n\nThere are other links between the two shows as well, including former Corrie actor Michael Condron, who played Griff Reynolds, starring as Bowen Marsh in Game of Thrones. He was part of the show from 2015 to 2016.\n\nOther former soap stars featuring in House of the Dragon include ex-Emmerdale cast member Luke Tittensor, who portrayed Daz Eden from 2003 until 2009. The actor now plays Ser Arryk Cargyll on the HBO fantasy series.\n\nThis follows James opening up about how \"hard\" the Amy abuse storyline was, telling the Daily Star: \"I think the hard part for me when we got this story was to sort of justify why he reacts in the way that he does because obviously me as James knows that it's wrong. But to sort of find a way for the character to justify his actions was quite a hard thing.\"\n\nHe further added: \"The most important thing for me was to make sure Elle was comfortable at all times. You know if there was anything she wasn't happy with, we changed that immediately.\""
