Sanjeev Bhaskar’s DI Sunil ‘Sunny’ Khan.\n\nAnd, like previous years, there’s an amazing guest cast too.\n\nThe series 5 cast includes a long-standing Casualty actress, a Game of Thrones legend, and a Hollyoaks hunk.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the cast of Unforgotten series 5.\n\nUnforgotten series 5 cast: Sanjeev Bhaskar plays DI Sunil ‘Sunny’ Khan\n\nSanjeev Bhaskar, 59, portrays

series The Real McCoy, Captain Butler, We Know Where You Live and Small Potatoes.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2015, he starred in Goodness Gracious Me, often recognised as the series that made him famous.\n\nSanjeev went on to star and write in the sitcom The Kumars at No. 42.\n\nHis more dramatic acting roles include the lead role of Dr Prem Sharma in The Indian Doctor and a main role as DI Sunny Khan in Unforgotten.\n\nIn January 2021, he was cast as Cain in the Netflix adaptation of The Sandman.\n\nMost recently, he’s portrayed Les Vegas in Sandylands.\n\nWho plays DCI Cassie Stuart replacement DCI Jess James?\n\nSinéad Keenan replaces Nicola Walker as the female lead, alongside Sanjeev Bhaskar’s DI Sunil ‘Sunny’ Khan.\n\nThe Irish actress, 45, plays DCI Jess James.\n\nDublin-born Sinéad began filming her new role earlier in 2022.\n\nShe’s best known for her BAFTA-nominated role as Melanie Jones in ITV’s Little Boy Blue.\n\nBeing Human fans will recognise her as Nina.\n\nBut she’s also played Addams in Doctor Who, Patricia in My Left Nut, Roz in Deep Water, and Dr. Bartholomew in Porters.\n\nShe says: “I have long been an admirer of [writer] Chris Lang’s work so I am absolutely delighted to be joining the Unforgotten team.\n\n“I’m very much looking forward to working with the extraordinary cast led by the brilliant and incredibly lovely, Sanjeev Bhaskar.\n\n“And I’m hoping that if I play my cards right I might even get to take a peek in Sunny’s backpack!”\n\nWriter Chris Lang added: “And so it begins, a new Unforgotten journey – and it’s scary, for Sunny and the Bishop Street team, for the audience, for all of us.\n\n“But it’s also very, very, exciting, and I cannot wait for you to meet DCI Jessica ‘Jessie’ James, played by the always brilliant, Sinéad Keenan.”\n\nRecently, Sinéad popped up as Aideen O’Shea in Derry Girls, DI Paula Cassidy in Showtrial, and Theresa Ryan in Three Families.\n\nUnforgotten series 5 cast:

episodes of Skins, and even played a taxi driver in Downton Abbey!\n\nBetween 2013 and 2014, he played Len in The Wrong Mans, but it was his role as DS Paul Lawrence in Prime Suspect 1973 that saw him really get noticed.\n\nIn 2015, he joined the cast of Unforgotten series 1, and has been in every series so far.\n\nHis film roles include a debt collector in Netflix’s recent adaptation of Persuasion, Watkins in The Reckoning, and a barman in The Gentlemen.\n\nUnforgotten series 5 cast: Pippa Nixon as DC Karen Willets\n\nPippa Nixon, 43, returns as DC Karen Willets in the cast of

portrayed Iain Jarrett in Silent Witness.\n\nOf course, soap fans will recognise Mark Frost right away.\n\nMark played villain Ray Crosby in Coronation Street.\n\nRay Crosby was the sleazy, corrupt businessman who arrived on the cobbles determined to bulldoze Weatherfield to build a luxury hotel.\n\nThe character is now in prison.\n\nSo actor Mark is free to take on new roles!\n\nBefore the ITV
