Smith, cleveland.com\n\nCleveland's Top 100 Celebrities\n\nCleveland area has established itself as a home for talented entertainers and celebrities in all art forms for more than a century.\n\nRanking the top 100 celebrities to come out of the area wasn't an easy task. The list includes actors, musicians, visual artists, writers, directors, producers and comedians.\n\nThe other qualifications were simple: Dead or alive, worked during the 20th and 21st Centuries, and spent an important part of their life residing in Northeast Ohio. We did not count athletes UNLESS they had significant entertainment credentials (only two qualified).\n\nThe list was originally compiled and written by The Plain Dealer staff in 2013. We've updated it here with new information, adding a few new celebrities, and moving others up and down in the rankings, based on achievements since 2013.\n\nWhat we've ended up with is a list of famous and award-winning artists who have represented Cleveland and its surrounding area very well.\n\nTroy L.
