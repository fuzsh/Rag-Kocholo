        "text": "Katie McGlynn is best known for playing Sinead Tinker over seven years in ITV's Coronation Street, for which she won Best Serial Drama Performance at the 2020 National Television Awards.\n\nShe will be joining the cast of Peter James's Wish You Were Dead just in time for her to appear at Shrewsbury's Theatre Severn in May.\n\nKatie has also played the regular role as Jodie 'Scout' Allen in Waterloo Road, and, more recently, Becky Quentin in Hollyoaks.\n\nShe has also appeared in Moving On, Leonardo and The Syndicate.\n\nIn 2021 she competed for the coveted glitterball trophy in series 19 of Strictly Come Dancing with dance partner Gorka Marquez.\n\nBut the appearance on stage will be her first experience of treading the boards.\n\nShe will be taking over the role of Cleo Morey from Giovanna Fletcher, who will be performing the role on tour from February 16 through to April 29. She will start off her run at the Leeds: Grand Theatre.\n\nThen she will be heading to Shrewsbury's Theatre Severn from May 8 to 13 as part of a national tour.\n\nKatie said: “I can’t think of a better way to make my stage play debut than with this brilliant and thrilling Peter James masterpiece and am so excited to be performing alongside such an incredibly talented cast.\n\n\"I’m really looking forward to visiting theatres all over the country, witnessing the audience reaction to the many twists, turns and edge-of-your-seat moments in the show.”\n\nShe will be joining other star cast members, George Rainsford (Casualty, Holby City, Call The Midwife) as DSI Roy Grace and Clive Mantle (Game of Thrones, The Vicar of Dibley, Sherlock, Casualty) as Curtis.\n\nOther cast members include Rebecca McKinnis, Callum Sheridan-Lee, Alex Stedman and Gemma Stroyan and Leon Stewart will reprise his role as DS Glenn Branson, having previously starred in another Peter James stage adaptation, Looking Good Dead. The understudies are Lizzie Grace, Jayda Kariuki and Christopher Killik.\n\nWish You Were Dead follows five successful stage plays and the critically acclaimed smash-hit primetime ITV series 'Grace', which are all based on the best-selling novels by the UK's number one crime author Peter James. This will be the sixth stage adaptation of James’ novels - making it the most successful crime thriller stage franchise since Agatha Christie.\n\nPeter James is a number one bestselling author of crime and thriller novels and the creator of the much loved Detective Superintendent Roy Grace.\n\nHe has topped the Sunday Times bestseller list 19 times and has achieved global book sales of over 21 million copies which have been translated into 37 languages.\n\nWish You Were Dead starts its run at Bromley's Churchill Theatre on Thursday (February 16)."
