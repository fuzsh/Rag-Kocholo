        "text": "Former Coronation Street star Katie McGlynn is proving there is life after the cobbles.\n\nThe TV star is now set to show off her moves on the dancefloor on Strictly 2021. She’ll compete against the likes of AJ Odudu, Sara Davies, John Whaite and more, but does she have what it takes to lift the Glitterball trophy?\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about Katie McGlynn.\n\nWho is Katie McGlynn?\n\nKatie is an actress from Littleborough in Rochdale, Greater Manchester.\n\nAfter beginning drama school at the age of ten, she studied Drama, English and Media Studies at A-level.\n\nShe bagged roles in BBC drama Moving On as well as minor parts in The Well, Paradox and Leonardo.\n\nBut her breakthrough role was in BBC school-set soap Waterloo Road in which she played Jodi \"Scout\" Allen.\n\nHow old is Katie?\n\nThe TV star is 28-years-old and was born on July 16, 1993 to Trevor and Ruth McGlynn.\n\nShe is the younger sister of triplet brothers Daniel, Michael and Trevor.\n\nFor her 26th birthday, a pal of hers organised a surprise birthday for her including two huge inflatable balloons with the number two and six.\n\nCelebrating the special day with her were her Coronation Street co-stars Rob Mallard, Alexandra Mardell and Daniel Brocklebank.\n\nWho is Katie McGlynn dating?\n\nKatie McGlynn is believed to be single after splitting from her boyfriend Benji Roberts.\n\nShe started dating the holiday park and lodge salesman in the summer of 2017, but they reportedly split at the end of 2018.\n\nKatie often shares posts on Instagram with her BFF Lee Bennett.\n\nLee accompanies Katie to most of her work events.\n\nWhen did Katie leave Coronation Street?\n\nKatie was on Corrie from 2013 until 2020 playing Sinead Tinker.\n\nAfter she left the show she revealed she grieved after watching the death of her character.\n\nShe said that watching her character die had a profound effect on her mental health.\n\nShe was nominated for a BAFTA and won a National Television Award for Best Serial Drama Performance for her role in Corrie and currently stars in Hollyoaks as mysterious newcomer Becky Quentin.\n\nKatie and Strictly\n\nKatie can’t wait to get into some sequins, saying in a statement: “It’s been so hard keeping it a secret, but I can finally say that I’m getting ready to shake my shimmy and become part of the Strictly family! I’m really not a dancer, but I’m so excited to learn a new skill on this crazy journey and cannot wait to slip into some sequins along the way.”\n\nShe added: “Although I do get to have so much fun as an actress, a lot of my roles have involved quite serious and challenging storylines, so I’m fully ready to let my hair down and do something different, even if it is completely outside of my comfort zone. I can’t promise that I’ll be the best, but I’m going to give it 110 per cent on the dance floor! As long as I don’t fall over I’ll be happy.”"
