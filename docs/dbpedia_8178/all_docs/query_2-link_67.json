        "text": "Ann Hathaway, 41, will no longer be feeling 'Les Miserables' because of a hangover. In April 2024, she told the New York Times that she had been sober for five years.\n\nShe said:'There are so many other things I identify as milestones. I don’t normally talk about it, but I am over five years sober.\n\n'That feels like a milestone to me. Forty feels like a gift. The fact of the matter is I hesitate at calling things \"middle age\" simply because I can be a semantic stickler and I could get hit by a car later today.\n\n‘We don’t know if this is middle age. We don’t know anything.’\n\nThis wasn’t the first time that the actress spoke about her relationship with alcohol. In 2019, during an appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres show, she said she wanted to stop drinking until her son, who was then nearly 3, had turned eighteen.\n\nLast summer supermodel Bella Hadid revealed on her Instagram that she had been 10 months sober.\n\n‘I’m so proud of anyone pushing through Dry July,’ she wrote, before giving fans a brief update on her wellness journey. ‘With Kin and lots of self-love, I am almost 10 months no alcohol! I’m so proud of anyone discovering their sobriety. Or anyone who has had the courage to open their mind to Dry July!’\n\nIn a previous interview with In Style she said: ‘I have done my fair share of drinking. I loved alcohol and it got to the point where even I started to, you know, cancel nights out that I felt like I wouldn’t be able to control myself.’\n\nShe discussed realising that drinking didn't really do much for her. ‘There's just this never-ending effect of, essentially, you know, pain and stress over those few drinks that didn't really do much, you know?’ she said.\n\nBella said that her doctor gave her scans that showed how alcohol impacted her brain, which made it a lot harder to pick up the glass'.\n\nShe's even co-founded her own no-alcohol drinks line, Kin Euphorics, which feature adaptogenic herbs, nootropics, and botanicals, after finding that it helped with her anxiety, the brain fog from her Lyme disease, and the burnout from constant work and travel.\n\nRead what happened when one WH editor tried Bella's booze-free brand\n\nLast October, at her Las Vegas residency show, Adele revealed she quit drinking after being a ‘borderline alcoholic’.\n\n‘I stopped drinking quite a long time ago now... it feels like forever... maybe like three and a half months ago. It’s boring. Oh my god, it’s boring. I mean, I was literally borderline alcoholic for quite a lot of my 20s, but I miss it so much,’ she admitted, after seeing an audience member drinking a pint of whiskey sour during her show at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace.\n\nShe jokingly told the fan: ‘So enjoy your whiskey sour. I’m very, very jealous.’\n\nA once-notorious noughties party girl, mum-of-two Lily Allen has embarked on a healthy lifestyle over the past few years – a key cornerstone of which has been going sober.\n\nIn an interview with Glamour, she admitted that sobriety has given her a new perspective on her old life.\n\n‘I certainly look at things that I’ve done and I go, “God, that’s cringe,” or, “I wish I hadn’t behaved like that on that night.” But it’s not really about singular events, it’s more about how it made me feel in general about myself. Sometimes, I look back and I see pictures of myself in a certain period of time and I’ll think, “God, I remember looking at the mirror at that time, thinking I looked completely different, and I clearly looked ill, sad and unhealthy.” You couldn’t have told me that I was those things at that time because I was just numbing it all. I was just numbing the pain. I look back at it sometimes with sadness for that person, but that soon changes into gratitude for what I have now. Thankfully, I found a different way.’\n\nDavina has previously opened up about how she hasn’t had an alcoholic drink in more than 30 years, following her addiction to alcohol and drugs.\n\nPer The Metro Davina said she won't 'ever stop' attending Alcoholics Anonymous. ‘I'll definitely never be recovered. I love going to my AA meetings and don't think I will ever stop.’\n\nDavina opened up about her struggles with addiction while speaking to Dragon's Den star Steven Bartlett for his Diary of a CEO podcast, the TV presenter spoke candidly about her story, including that she began smoking weed age 12 during visits to Paris to see her mother, who was an alcoholic.\n\nShe also shared that she took cocaine with her sister age 14, and with her mum age 15. In the interview, Davina elaborated on how, from the age of 3, she was raised by her grandmother in Surrey with her father coming to see her at the weekend - following her parents' split.\n\nBig up to Davina for being open about her past history with addiction. And, in her present, being a positive, daily reminder of the power of recovery.\n\nMiley revealed that she had been sober for six months in June 2020 after undergoing vocal surgery in November 2019.\n\n‘I’ve been sober sober for the past six months. At the beginning, it was just about this vocal surgery … But I had been thinking a lot about my mother. My mom was adopted, and I inherited some of the feelings she had, the abandonment feelings and wanting to prove that you’re wanted and valuable,’ she told Variety at the time.\n\n‘My dad’s parents divorced when he was 3, so my dad raised himself. I did a lot of family history, which has a lot of addiction and mental health challenges. So just going through that and asking, “Why am I the way that I am?” By understanding the past, we understand the present and the future much more clearly. I think therapy is great.’\n\nMonths after her initial disclosure, Miley revealed that she ‘fell off’ her sobriety journey amid the pandemic and has since opened up about struggling with her sobriety.\n\nLast November, the singer Jessica Simpson celebrated six years of sobriety by re-sharing an intimate photo on Instagram from the beginning of her alcohol-free journey.\n\nIn the original post, which was posted in November 2021, she captioned the image: ‘This person in the early morning of Nov 1, 2017 is an unrecognisable version of myself. I had so much self-discovery to unlock and explore. I knew in this very moment I would allow myself to take back my light, show victory over my internal battle of self respect, and brave this world with piercing clarity.’\n\n‘Personally, to do this I needed to stop drinking alcohol because it kept my mind and heart circling in the same direction and quite honestly I was exhausted,’ Simpson continued. ‘I wanted to feel the pain so I could carry it like a badge of honour.’\n\nMegan Fox revealed enough was enough when it came to drinking after a ‘belligerent’ Golden Globes incident.\n\nSpeaking to Who What Wear about the awards ceremony, the Transformers actor recalled how she was seated at a table with Blake Lively and the Jonas Brothers, and remembers that there were large bottles of Moet champagne on the table in front of them.\n\n‘I went through multiple glasses of that and now I don't drink and this is why,’ she said.\n\n‘I was belligerent and said a bunch of sh*t on the red carpet that I shouldn't have said after that. I think I got into a lot of trouble for whatever I said on the red carpet at that event, I don't remember why but I know I did and you can look that up.’\n\nThe former WH cover star and fitness sensation shared a snap to Instagram, in which she detailed her reasons for not drinking. ‘I feel like people are really surprised when I say I haven't had alcohol since I was 19,’ the trainer wrote.\n\n‘I've tried alcohol before, but I've just never liked it.

I feel like I'm a role model for lots of women and young girls, and I'm proud that I can spread this message and let you know that you don't NEED to feel pressured to drink alcohol if you don't want to. Please don't feel weird if you don't enjoy alcohol, because you are not the only one!’\n\nOur favourite Gossip Girl star revealed in her cover story back in 2012 that not only does she not drink alcohol, but she's also never touched drugs.

Speaking on Lorraine, the star said: ‘So far it's only been true for half a year. I have 17 and a half years to go.’\n\n‘The time I have with (Jonathan) is really precious. And I do leave a lot for work and I found my time with was getting impacted, not necessary by the drinking, as I never went out of control around him. But I hate to say it – as you get older, the hangovers get really bad. I had to make a choice and I chose mornings. Isn't that annoying? Isn't that horrible? I'm really irritated by how well it's going.’\n\nSpeaking more recently of her sobriety journey, Hathaway told People: ‘In my 30s, I had to give up alcohol. I couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't lead the life that I wanted while drinking. And in my 40s I'm finding I have to support myself differently nutritionally. I want to go back and talk to my 25-year-old self who felt like she didn't have to do anything and just be like, “Oh honey, honey, there's a whole other world out there and it tastes like an avocado”.’\n\nThis Sex and the City star Kristin Davis has previously admitted that drinking was ‘enough of a problem’ for her to quit alcohol in her 20s.\n\nShe told The Daily Telegraph that alcohol was ‘enough of a problem for me to go, “This is something that could get in the way of what I want to do in life”.’\n\n‘Luckily my first boyfriend out of school was sober – which was super-duper helpful.’\n\nShe’s also spoken to Fox News about her drinking: ‘Alcohol freed me. I was really shy and I didn’t know how to come out of my shell. I drank for the same reason I loved acting. I wanted to feel things and express myself and be free. And I'm not naturally that way.’\n\nNaomi Campbell opened up about her battle with drug and alcohol addiction in her early modelling days in the candid documentary, The Super Models.\n\nThe fashion icon explained she started to abuse substances as a way to deal with the grief of her childhood abandonment issues – as well as the shocking death of her close friend and beloved designer Gianni Versace.\n\nSpeaking about Versace on the Apple TV+ docuseries Campbell says: ‘So, when he died, my grief became very bad.\n\n‘When I started using, that was one of the things I tried to cover up, was grief.

So I got really angry.’\n\nIn the singer's 2012 Women of the Year profile by British GQ, Lana spoke of her struggle with alcohol addiction for most of her early teenage years, finally getting sober before she turned 20 and after moving to New York City to pursue her music.\n\nShe explained that was a part of the reason she attended boarding school as a teen and how it influenced her art: ‘I was a big drinker at the time. I would drink every day. I would drink alone. I thought the whole concept was so f-cking cool. A great deal of what I wrote on Born To Die is about these wilderness years. A lot of the time when I write about the person that I love, I feel like I’m writing about New York. And when I write about the thing that I’ve lost I feel like I’m writing about alcohol because that was the first love of my life. Sure, there have been people, but it’s really alcohol.’"
