        "text": "Jim Allen is an experienced natural resources lawyer assisting clients with all types of transactions related to mining and mineral rights, including coal, metals, industrial minerals, oil, and gas. He assists with mineral leases, royalty agreements, mining acquisitions, and joint ventures, as well as real-estate transactions where public lands or mineral rights are involved. Whether the client is buying or selling a mineral project, or joining forces with another party, Jim can provide local-counsel assistance to the transaction, and can help with due diligence on permitting, regulatory compliance, mineral title, and other issues.\n\nWhen land ownership is split between surface owners and mineral owners, Jim helps his clients find practical solutions to anticipate and avoid conflicts so that owners or potential buyers can understand, develop, and enjoy their respective property rights.\n\nJim provides capable assistance with all issues related to gaining and clearing title to mineral rights, including title examination, title opinions, title curative actions, and royalty disputes. In particular, Jim advises clients on the often-arcane rules governing mining claims on public land, and can help miners who are establishing, perfecting, or defending their claims. Jim is experienced in the federal systems for leasing oil and gas, coal, and other minerals on the public lands, and can assist with lease transfers, modifications, and relinquishments, among other administrative actions.\n\nWhether on public or private land, no mineral project can succeed without knowing and complying with the full range of environmental protection laws and permit requirements. Jim assists mine operators and other clients with all phases of this process before government agencies, including permit applications, conferences, hearings, appeals, and litigation. Jim’s background as an engineer permits him to interact effectively with state and federal regulators on a variety of technical issues. Jim handles appeals of regulatory decisions before to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA), the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR), and the Utah Board of Oil, Gas, and Mining, among others.\n\nPrior to joining Snell & Wilmer, Jim served as counsel to the Utah Department of Natural Resources, including the Divisions of Oil, Gas, Mining, Forestry, Fire, State Lands, and Wildlife Resources. He was staff attorney and report editor for the Utah Mine Safety Commission created by Governor Jon Huntsman to assess Utah’s role in mine safety after the Crandall Canyon Mine accidents of 2007."
