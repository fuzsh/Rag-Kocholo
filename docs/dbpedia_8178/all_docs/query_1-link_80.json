        "text": "Just one day after Coronation Street actor Mikey North released a statement categorically denying reports he 'kissed' his co-star Alison King at last week's National Television Awards, Alison herself has now responded to the rumours.\n\nAdmitting she did regrettably have too much to drink on the night, Alison also shut down the damaging reports, with the Daily Star reporting she said, “I would like to take this opportunity to say that, whilst it was obvious to see that regrettably I did have too much to drink at the National TV Awards, and chose to leave the event early, I did not kiss my co star Mikey North as has been reported.”\n\nAlison's words come just hours after Mikey called the reports 'ludicrous' and 'upsetting', whilst releasing a statement to OK! Magazine.\n\nHe told the publication, \"I would like to make one thing clear: I did not kiss my co-star Alison King during the recent National Television Awards. It is beyond ludicrous to suggest that I would or that I did.\n\n\"The grainy recording shows me simply speaking into her ear at what was a noisy public event. This report has caused me and my family a great deal of distress.\"\n\nMikey then added, \"I have an amazing wife who I adore and, as incredibly supportive as she is, it is unacceptable that she should have to deal with people seeing this kind of baseless gossip on the front page of a newspaper. I am so upset about this, and will not stand by while my personal reputation is tarnished. I have lodged an immediate complaint with the Independent Press Standards Organisation.”\n\nOf course, Mikey, who plays the role of Gary Windass in the soap, is happily married to his wife Rachael Isherwood, with the couple having two children together. Mikey and Rachael got married back in 2016, after meeting each other in a bar. The pair later welcomed their first child Archie in 2017, and their daughter Eliza in September last year.\n\nCheck out which other celebs welcomed babies in 2019:\n\nRead all of this week's Coronation Street spoilers right here."
