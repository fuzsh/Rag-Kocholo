He was born on April 8, 1946, in Indianapolis, Indiana. He was preceded in death by his parents, George and Evelyn Lois Brooks Nulf.\n\nJim's career in Sales at AMP Products was marked by his passion for building relationships and his unparalleled work ethic. Prior to his successful career in Sales, Jim proudly served in the US Navy and later also as an Air Force Reserve Pilot with the rank of LT.\n\nBeyond his professional achievements, Jim had a strong affinity for antique cars and shooting guns, which reflected his adventurous spirit and love for unique hobbies.\n\nJim is survived by his loving wife of 43 years, Susan Bostian Nulf; his children, James \"Jimmy\" Nulf Jr. and Deborah Nulf; as well as his three cherished grandchildren, Aaron, Zach, and Dominic \"Nick.\" And many wonderful friends.\n\nIn peaceful circumstances surrounded by his adoring wife, Jim Allen Nulf's legacy lives on through the memories shared with those closest to him.
