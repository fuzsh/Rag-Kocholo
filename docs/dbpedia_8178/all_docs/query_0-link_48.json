        "text": "Coronation Street spoilers: 40 new images reveal Todd caught at last, three huge arrests and child abuse horror\n\nThey say that revenge is a dish best served cold, and this is something Todd Grimshaw (Gareth Pierce) will learn the hard way in Coronation Street next week.\n\nIn scenes which viewers have long been waiting for, the young man gets his comeuppance, as Paul Foreman (Peter Ash) sets in motion a plan to expose him.\n\nSeveral of the cobbles’ finest gather in Victoria Gardens for the unveiling of the calander photoshoot organised by Curtis Delamere (Sam Retford) and Emma Brooker (Alexandra Mardell).\n\nThe calendar, however, is not on the menu, as Paul switches his laptop with Curtis’, resulting in a rather incriminating video of Todd playing for all the street to see!\n\nAnd in subsequent scenes, the schemer pays the price for his sins, as he’s arrested.\n\nAnd that’s not the only arrest made during the week in question, as James Bailey (Nathan Graham) is puled over by a policeman, and when he questions the reason why, he’s dragged away in handcuffs, while Laura Neelan (Kel Allen) is arrested on suspicion of child cruelty!\n\nFiz Stape (Jennie McAlpine) revels, as Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) gets jealous when Hope includes Phill in her school project, while the stress of Todd’s arrest weighs heavy on Summer, as she collapses, leaving Todd fearing for her life!\n\nIt’s all kicking off on the cobbles next week, eh?\n\nFancy a sneak peek? Of course you do, and we aim to please, so here’s a first look at what’s to come, with a gallery jam-packed with exciting new pictures of next week’s huge week.\n\nCoronation Street airs these scenes w/c Monday July 26 at 7:30pm on ITV.\n\nIf you’ve got a soap or TV story, video or pictures get in touch by emailing us soaps@metro.co.uk – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nJoin the community by leaving a comment below and stay updated on all things soaps on our homepage.\n\nThe Soaps Newsletter\n\nDaily\n\nWeekly\n\nSign up for daily Soaps updates and our weekly Editor’s special for juicy exclusives and interviews.
