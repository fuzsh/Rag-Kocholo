        "text": "Some of Coronation Street's best-loved stars were seen partying up a storm at Millie Gibson's leaving drinks.\n\nActress Millie, 18, who plays Kelly Neelan in the soap, is quitting the cobbles in the autumn after three years on the show.\n\nTo celebrate her tenure there, Millie and the cast headed for The Alchemist Bar in Salford Quays where the champagne appeared to be flowing.\n\nThe actress shared a series of snaps on her Instagram story, showing her with Corrie legend Samia Longchambon and Gary Windass actor Mikey North.\n\nActors Chris Gascoyne, who plays Peter Barlow, and Billy Mayhew actor Daniel Brocklebank were also in attendance.\n\nMillie looked like she was living her best life as she posed with a glass of bubbly, wearing a gorgeous turquoise dress.\n\nHer showbiz pals also seemed to be in high spirits as they chatted happily against the backdrop of the Quays.\n\nProducers have been tight-lipped about Millie's character's exit, however there are reports Kelly could be killed off.\n\nA Corrie source told The Sun : “Millie’s a huge talent.\n\n\"She has loved her time on the soap but there’s a lot of excitement about what she’s going to do next.\n\n“Everyone has been sworn to secrecy over her exit storyline.\n\n\"Millie’s not even telling people if the door has been left open for her.”\n\nKelly first joined the ITV soap in 2019 as a struggling teenager, who was accused of murder.\n\nShe was then made homeless after she was cleared of Seb Franklin's murder.\n\nMillie's run of dramatic scenes earned her the Best Young Performer gong at this year's British Soap Awards.\n\nAfter bagging the award, the actress said she'd been \"unbelievably lucky\" to have been given the \"most hard-hitting and compelling\" storylines.\n\nMillie's co-star Mikey North has also tipped her for success, rating her 'better than any young actress' he has ever worked with, according to the Manchester Evening News.\n\nHe said: \"This girl is incredible. Whatever she chooses to do in her career will be amazing\".\n\nBefore Corrie, Millie starred in ITV drama Butterfly, which followed the story of 11-year-old Max, who wanted to live as a girl.\n\nShe played Lily, Max's sister, alongside Anna Friel and former Hollyoaks star Emmett J Scanlan as Max's parents.\n\nThe actress' first role on TV was in an episode of Love, Lies and Records and her big break came after she was cast in kids show Jamie Johnson on CBBC."
