        "text": "As a gaggle of golf-mad athletes, actors and other A-listers prepare to tee it up in the American Century Championship, at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course, in Lake Tahoe, Nev., inquiring minds want to know: what’s the deal with their games?\n\nHere’s a rundown of the (reported) handicap for every player in the field for the modified Stableford competition, which is Friday to Sunday.\n\nAmerican Century Championship celebrity handicaps\n\nJosh Allen — 10\n\nMarcus Allen — 10\n\nAnthony Anderson — 15\n\nBret Baier — 2.8\n\nCharles Barkley — 10\n\nA golf-world laughingstock no more, Barkley has regained enough form to get by in a hit-and-giggle. But the best part of his game is that he doesn’t take it seriously. The bookies don’t either. The odds for Sir Charles to win are 7,500-1.\n\nBrian Baumgartner — 9\n\nJerome Bettis — 8\n\nJay Bilas — 5\n\nTim Brown — 8\n\nJoe Buck — 3\n\nDavid Carr — 4\n\nVince Carter — 9\n\nAlex Caruso — 12\n\nDell Curry — 3\n\nSeth Curry — 7\n\nSteph Curry — 0\n\nFresh off his fourth NBA title, the most famous Curry in the field is looking to seal the deal in a tournament where he has finished 7th, 4th and 9th in his last three tries.\n\nVinny Del Negro — 1\n\nJay DeMarcus — 13\n\nDylan Dreyer — 19\n\nMardy Fish — 10\n\nLarry Fitzgerald — 5.9\n\nDwight Freeney — 8\n\nTom Glavine — 2\n\nRobert Gould — 4.9\n\nRobert Griffin III — 10\n\nAJ Hawk — 15\n\nAndre Iguodala — 5.1\n\nNick Jonas — 5.8\n\nThe boy band star is putting on his big boy pants to compete in his American Century debut. If his handicap is honest, he’s a better player than those AT&T spots with Jordan Spieth make him out to be.\n\nColin Jost — 12\n\nTravis Kelce — 11\n\nJon Lester — 3.5\n\nDerek Lowe — 0\n\nKyle Lowry — 10\n\nPatrick Mahomes — 7.7\n\nJoe Mauer — 4\n\nPat McAfee — 14\n\nBrian Mcann — 0\n\nJim McMahon — 9\n\nKevin Millar — 5\n\nMike Mizanin — 17\n\nIn the ring, the WWE superstar known as The Miz dispatches his opponents with a devastating move called the Skull-Crushing Finale. On the course, the only pain he inflicts is on himself.\n\nMark Mulder — 0.3\n\nAdam Napier — 2\n\nJohn O’Hurley — 9.4\n\nTJ Oshie — 3.9\n\nJake Owen — 2\n\nCarson Palmer — 4\n\nJoe Pavelski — 0\n\nMichael Pena — 2.8\n\nPatrick Peterson — 5\n\nAlfonso Ribeiro — 2.6\n\nJerry Rice — 2.9\n\nRob Riggle — 9\n\nAaron Rodgers — 5\n\nIvan Rodriguez — 4.9\n\nJimmy Rollins — 14\n\nRay Romano — 13\n\nTony Romo — +1\n\nWhile Barkley and his buddies go deep at the casinos just across the road, Romo is expected to turn in early, resting up at the lakeside Lodge at Edgewood to prepare for a tourney he is favored to win.\n\nCC Sabathia — 16\n\nJason Scheff — 6\n\nAlex Smith — 6.5\n\nEmmitt Smith — N/A\n\nHarrison Smith — 3.7\n\nJohn Smoltz — +1\n\nAnnika Sorenstam — N/A\n\nPaige Spiranac — 0\n\nIn the past, the Instagram star and social influencer has complained that people don’t take her seriously. Clearly, she can seriously play."
