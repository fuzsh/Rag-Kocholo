        "text": "What a cliffhanger eh? Spoiler alert by the way, David did confront Elsie with a gun, but when she broke down he told her that the gun was empty and ran out.\n\nCorrie had been on air for nearly four years; Martha Longhurst had been killed off while others were on the way out in a bloodshed; and the Ogdens had made their debut a month or so earlier.\n\n23rd August 1965 (Writer: Jim Allen; Producer: H. V. Kershaw)\n\nWhen Glenda celebrated her first birthday, the 490th episode of Corrie was broadcast. Here what was in store:\n\nLen Fairclough makes Jerry Booth his partner at the builder's yard and they have a party.\n\nLucille Hewitt is chatted up by a Barry at her new workplace Mitchell's.\n\nAlbert Tatlock takes Ted Bates in after he runs away from an old age home. Albert's sideboard mysteriously jumps in the night.\n\nSpoiler alert: The reason behind the mystery was that Albert had cracked floorboads.\n\n24th August 1977 (Writer: Julian Roach; Producer: Bill Podmore)\n\nWhen Glenda entered her teenage years, it was on a Tuesday. The following day, the 1733rd episode of Corrie was broadcast. What was happening?\n\nRay Langton asks Len Fairclough for a 50/50 partnership in the builders' yard, but Len refuses. Deirdre tells Ray to set up his own business in competition against Len. Ray tells Len he's leaving the business. They agree to a truce and begin a new partnership but don't tell Deirdre or Rita.\n\nKen Barlow agrees to take Peter walking in the Peak District.\n\nMavis Riley's aunt Edie leaves her estate to her in her will and her cousin Ethel threatens to contest the will. Mavis is told that Edie's house was sold to a finance company and isn't hers.\n\nMavis would later move into the Kabin's flat which had been vacant since Rita had married Len in April.\n\nCorrie was now well-established in the TV schedules and this was the beginning of one of the show's strongest eras after a slump earlier in the decade. Minnie Caldwell had left the street in 1976 while Mike Baldwin had established his denim factory also the same year. Annie Walker had been running the Rovers alone since Jack's death in 1970 and had the help of staff Betty, Bet and Fred. Len Fairclough and Rita Littlewood had got married in April in the highest rated TV episode of the 1970s.\n\n23rd August 1982 (Writer: Peter Whalley; Producers: Pauline Shaw and Bill Podmore)\n\nWhen Glenda became of age, the 2232nd episode of Corrie was broadcast. This is what happened on the cobbles during that episode:\n\nThe Faircloughs move into the newly-built No. 7.\n\nEddie Yeats tells Hilda Ogden that his engagement to Marion Willis is off. She tells him she's certain that they'll reunite.\n\nMike Baldwin refuses to give Maggie Dunlop money to buy a shop unit. She gets money from Harry Redman instead. Mike is jealous of their relationship.\n\nCraig Whitely moves into No. 9 with his granddad Chalkie. His drum playing upsets the Faircloughs next door.\n\nIn the following episode, Maggie tells Mike that she's pregnant with his baby.\n\nThis year was the calm before the storm. Within a year the show would lose many of its key characters but popularity-wise would be at its strongest.\n\n21st August 1985 (Writer: Julian Roach; Producer: Bill Podmore)\n\nWhen Glenda celebrated her 21st birthday, it was on a Friday. The most recent Corrie was on the previous Wednesday. Here's what was happening:\n\nHilda Ogden tells Alf Roberts about what Les Pringle said about her broken roof. Alf inspects it and tells her her roof is fine. Alf confronts Pringle and tells him he doesn't want him to work on the conversion of the corner shop and throws him out. Hilda's thrilled she doesn't have to move out.\n\nTerry Duckworth is fed up of having nothing and considers leaving the street.\n\nFrank Mills and Bet Lynch predict that they'll be sleeping together soon.\n\nThe storm was now over and the show dedicated itself to its established characters instead of introducing new ones. The star players were mainly Bet, Ivy, the Duckworths, the Barlows and Alf.\n\n24th August 1994 (Writer: Adele Rose; Producer: Carolyn Reynolds)\n\nGlenda reached her 30th birthday in 1994. Her birthday was on a Tuesday and the following day, the 3742nd episode was broadcast. What was happening?\n\nDeirdre Barlow prepares No. 1 for her boyfriend Samir Rachid. She is alarmed when he's held by immigration officers at Manchester airport. She has to admit that he's her lover and Samir is allowed into the country and Deirdre takes him home\n\nTanya Pooley gets the order from the tribunal. She tries to persuade Des Barnes to drop her from the case. Tanya finds comfort in Bet Gilroy's boyfriend Charlie Whelan.\n\nPercy Sugden encourages Curly Watts to court Paula Maxwell.\n\nNicky Platt annoys the Platts by playing loud music.\n\nCorrie was now being broadcast three times. The show was still blessed with long running characters, despite the exit of Hilda Ogden in 1987.\n\n23rd August 2004 (1) (Writer: Jonathan Harvey; Producer: Tony Wood)\n\nWhen Glenda reached her 40th birthday, it was on a Monday, so two episodes of Corrie were being broadcast, the 5829th and 5830th. Here's what happened in the first episode:\n\nJamie Baldwin is angry that Frankie is interfering in his relationship with Leanne. Jamie and Leanne reunite.\n\nSteve and Karen McDonald go shopping. Karen's dad Malcolm later turns up to her shock.\n\nKarl Foster tells Todd Grimshaw he's proud that he's come out as being gay. When Les has go at him, Todd stands up for himself.\n\nPenny King and Mike Baldwin return from holiday.\n\nVera Duckworth tells Frankie that Hayley was a man to the Croppers' upset.\n\nAnd this is what happened in the second episode, that was written by Mark Wadlow:\n\nKaren is not interested in what her father has to say despite him telling her that her mum is dying.
