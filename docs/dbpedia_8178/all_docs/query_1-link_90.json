        "text": "It's not very often Coronation Street comes with a warning but one of the soap's stars has issued one ahead of heartbreaking scenes. Mille Gibson, who plays Kelly Neelan in the ITV soap, took to Instagram to share a short message with the show's fans.\n\nThe clip, posted to her Instagram Story showed a video of her co-star Kel Allen, who plays her on-screen mum Laura, as she got ready for her scenes, applying makeup in a hospital gown.\n\nMillie is heard laughing in the background as she films Kel who tells her she's 'contouring with her death pallette' as she films her final scenes after a couple of years on the famous cobbles.\n\nREAD MORE: Coronation Street Sam star Jude Riordan in stitches as he becomes 'mini Roy' with key item\n\n\"The shades are...\" Millie says before Kel replied: \"Death,\" leading them both to laugh. But there's will be no laughing on-screen as Laura's final scenes air. As Corrie fans know Laura returned to the cobbles earlier in the year and told her daughter Kelly that she was dying and after initially not believing her, the teen became her mum's carer before she moved in with her at Gary and Maria Windass' flat.\n\nBut last month there was a huge twist when Laura discovered that Gary was responsible for killing her husband Rick, who has been missing since 2019. As she prepared to go to the police with the information so she could get Rick's money to leave for Kelly when she dies, Laura had a change of heart and confessed to her husband's murder.\n\nKelly is now refusing to see her dying mum in hospital and earlier this week told Gary and Maria, who have been trying to change her mind, that her mum was already 'dead to her'. Meanwhile, the guilt is clearly eating away at Gary who continues to visit her and was told that Laura had days left to live.\n\nAhead of Friday night's episodes, Millie wrote alongside her video on Instagram as well as tweeted: \"If you’re about on a Friday night, have a watch of tonight’s @ITVCorrie’, she wrote. \"These scenes are quite distressing, but you get to see our @KelAllenUK absolutely smash it\".\n\nThe episode will see Gary reveal to Maria and Kelly just as there about to leave for the hairdresing awards that he’s had a call from the hospital warning him that Laura only has hours to live. Determined that her Mum is not going to ruin her day, Kelly walks out and Maria hurries after her.\n\nLater, Kelly is on a high as she wins Best Trainee Stylist and knocks back the wine. Gary arrives and appeals to her to go and visit Laura. What will she do?\n\nEarlier this week, Kel appeared on ITV's Lorraine to chat about Laura's final days on the cobbles. The actress spoke about the true emotions felt on set during filming her final scenes on the cobbles. After an emotional clip from Corrie played out showing Gary, played by Mikey North, at Laura's bedside, showing her photos of Kelly alongside wife Maria's son Liam, presenter Ranvir Singh said: \"Oh my goodness. That isn't your final scene on the show is it... What was it like in the build-up to your final scenes?\"\n\nKel said; \"Those final days it was literally emotional scenes... big ones. Me and Mikey, we're normally laughing on set together ad everything, but we'd be looking at each other and welling up. All this emotion would come because we knew that these big scenes were coming.\n\n\"Filming that scene just then we were just going. We were like someone needs to put a camera on us and film quickly. Production, the crew was crying. We were all just having a little cry over the scenes for Laura and just how sad they are with Kelly, Gary, and everything.\"\n\nLast month Kel, who is often sharing behind-the-scenes snaps alongside her on-screen daughter, was full of praise for her time in Weatherfield.\n\n\"For me it has been an incredible job playing a brilliant character and being part of a storyline that has really engaged the audience,\" she said. \"The biggest thing I have taken from it is the relationships with the people there.\n\n\"Milie is incredible, such a talented actor and she is the daughter I never had. I knew Georgia [Taylor - who plays Toyah Battersby] before I joined as we trained together many years ago so it has been brilliant working with her again.\n\n\"Also I loved working with Samia [Longchambon], Charlie [De Melo] and Mikey [North], we are like one big family and I feel blessed to be part of that and I will never forget this experience.\""
