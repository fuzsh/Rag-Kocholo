        "text": "James W. Allen MD, MPH is a retired Navy physician, awarded pilot, and business owner. Dr. Allen specialized in the care of the industrial workforce at the Navy’s shipyards and aviation repair stations, and served as manager of a project that installed medical computer systems in the shipyards and directed the transition to productivity measures for occupational health services. After 30 years of service in the Navy Medical Corps, Allen retired as a CAPT in 2006. He then worked with the US Public Health Service providing toxicology and health services to federal agencies for eight years before his final retirement in 2014. Following his retirement Allen has focused on his passion for aviation while caring for his family’s legacy.\n\nDr. Allen holds an undergraduate degree with highest distinction from Cornell University, a Medical Doctor (MD) degree from the University of Rochester, and a Masters in Public Health (MPH) from the Uniformed Services University for the Health Sciences. He nurtured his passion for flying in the Navy, receiving certification as an FAA designated Aviation Medical Examiner and joining Navy flying clubs where he earned his commercial pilot’s license with flight instructor’s rating. He continued his education throughout both of his careers, earning specialty certifications through the American College of Pathology and the American Board of Preventive Medicine, Masters in Science degrees in both Business Administration and Biostatistics, and graduating from the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF). Dr. Allen’s continued research of the health of aviation maintenance technicians resulted in his book, “Working Healthy”, used in trade schools that teach aviation technology.\n\nAs a volunteer for the FAA, Dr. Allen has served as a safety representative, given numerous presentations, and participated as a guest panelist all focusing on the health of the aviation workforce. In 2023 the FAA recognized him with a Master Pilot Award for 50 years in aviation and his promotion of aviation safety. Currently he lives in Wilmington, DE but operates his family’s summer campground, Lake Grove Park, located in the Finger Lakes region of New York. Associated with the Park is Kayutah Lake Airport (FAA designation 2NY9) where he keeps his airplane."
