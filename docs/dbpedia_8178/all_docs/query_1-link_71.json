        "text": "When Maria first entered the room, Laura mistook her for Kelly but the hairdresser said: \"No. I'm sorry, it's Maria.\n\n\"Kelly will be here soon, though,\" she continued before adding: \"Laura, I just want to thank you for what you have done.\n\n\"You're a good woman. I can't believe what you've done for Kelly and for Gary. For all of us,\" she stated and she proceeded to tell the dying woman she would be by her side until her daughter arrived.\n\nIt was a fair amount of time before Kelly actually burst through the hospital doors and by this point, Laura had died.\n\nMaria was the one who broke the news to her surrogate daughter, telling her how sorry she was she didn't get to see her mother one final time.\n\nDiscussing why she wanted Maria and Gary to take on the parental responsibilities for her character's daughter, Kel added: \"I think personally all she's thought is about Kelly's future and she's not considered herself in it.\n\n\"When the realisation of that hits those scenes where she is talking to Kelly were so emotional. Oh my god. I was sobbing I couldn't stop even when they shouted cut.\n\n\"It is the realisation for Laura that her daughter is going to hate her and that throws her off because she loves her but she is still determined to make this sacrifice even if she dies with her daughter believing she is a murderer.\n\n\"She has had to make the person she loves the most hate her in order to help her.\"\n\nCoronation Street airs Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 8pm on ITV."
