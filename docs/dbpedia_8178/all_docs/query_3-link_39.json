        "text": "Jim Allen was being talked about as a possible West Indies batsman when he signed for the World Series Cricket in 1977 - Clive Lloyd said at the time he expected Allen to be the surprise star of the show - but he struggled and was rather a peripheral character. After the WSC, he made 161 against Jamaica, but his form fell away afterwards and he did not score another hundred in his remaining first-class career.\n\nMartin Williamson"
