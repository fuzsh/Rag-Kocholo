Viewers and producers alike will want to keep her in the house as long as possible in the hope that she’ll shed some light on her “hush agreement” with Donald Trump.”\n\nOdds to win Celebrity Big Brother\n\nRyan Thomas - 3/1\n\nDan Osborne - 9/2\n\nGabby Allen - 13/2\n\nRoxanne Pallett - 7/1\n\nStormy Daniels - 15/2\n\nKirstie Alley - 12/1\n\nNatalie Nunn - 12/1\n\nRodrigo Alves - 12/1\n\nChloe Ayling - 14/1\n\nNick Leeson - 16/1\n\nSally Morgan - 16/1\n\nBen Jardine - 20/1\n\nJermaine Pennant - 20/1\n\nWant more news?\n\nTo keep up to date with our latest news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nFind our Bath Facebook page here or Somerset's can be found here ."
