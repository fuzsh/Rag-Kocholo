        "text": "During a March 2024 interview with Vanity Fair, Anne Hathaway opened up about her decision to stop drinking alcohol for good after coming to the realisation that it wasn't 'for her'.\n\n'And it just felt so extreme to have to say, ‘But none?’ But none. If you’re allergic to something or have an anaphylactic reaction to something, you don’t argue with it. So I stopped arguing with it,' she said.\n\nThe star went on to emphasise that her words didn't come from a place off judgement or sanctimony, but rather, prioritising what is best for her.\n\n'My personal experience with it is that everything is better. For me, it was wallowing fuel. And I don’t like to wallow. The thing that I have faith in is that everybody else is going to have one or two drinks, and by the time everybody gets to two drinks, you’ll feel like you’ve had two drinks—but without the hangover.'\n\nAddressing the audience at one of her Las Vegas residency shows, Adele has claimed that she was 'borderline alcoholic' when she was in her 20s. The Tottenham-born star admitted she was finding her new-found sobriety 'boring' and admitted she 'misses alcohol.'\n\n'I stopped drinking maybe like three and a half months ago. It's boring,’ she said. ‘I mean, I was literally borderline alcoholic for quite a lot of my twenties, but I miss it so much. I cut out caffeine.'\n\nIn March, the Hello singer, who also previously gave up drinking in October 2021, revealed she once drank four bottles of wine before lunch during the pandemic. She explained to the crowd: ‘I remember when I came here in Covid, in lockdown, it was 11am and I was definitely like four bottles of wine in – like we all were.\n\n'I said in 2020 that I wanted to put my album out. And we were all at home just drunk basically.'\n\nTom Holland revealed to Entertainment Weekly in May 2023 that he has been sober for one year and four months.\n\nThe actor said that working on Apple TV+ show The Crowded Room allowed him to ‘recognise triggers and things that stress me out'.\n\nDiscussing how talking to psychiatrists to prepare him for the psychological thriller helped him in his personal life, he told the news outlet: 'Learning about mental health and the power of it, and speaking to psychiatrists about Danny (his character) and Billy's struggles, has been something that has been so informative to my own life.’\n\nHolland said he hoped viewers of the miniseries would ‘have more respect and more sympathy for people who are going through mental health issues’.\n\nHe continued: 'I hope that people will feel educated about the powers of mental health, the struggles, [and] our incredible abilities to survive.'\n\nOpening up about how the intensity of the role took its toll on him, he explained: 'I'm no stranger to the physical aspects of the job doing the whole action movie thing.\n\n‘But the mental aspect, it really beat me up, and it tool a long time for me to recover afterwards, to sort of get back to reality.'\n\nRecalling that he needed to detach himself from his on-screen character at one point, the Spider-Man star said: 'I was seeing myself in him, but in my personal life, I remember having a bit of a meltdown at home and thinking, like, “I'm going to shave my head. I need to shave my head, because I need to get rid of this character.”\n\n'And, obviously, we were mid-shooting, so I decided not to... It was unlike anything I've ever experienced before.’\n\nHadid celebrated five months of sobreity during a trip to Las Vegas in March 2023. The model shared several photos of herself in a red dress with crimped hair, captioning the post: '5mo 🚫 🍸🍾🍷🫡 #🥹.'\n\nIn another post, she opened up about her and cofounder Jen Batchelor's aim for Kin Euphorics, a nonalcoholic wellness beverage brand. 'There was something, among many other things of course , that @jenofkin and I always agreed on. We never wanted to ostracise anyone from access to brain care and an opportunity to discover Wellness in a new way.\n\n'We wanted to make sure that we were available to not only the health and wellness communities worldwide, but genuinely passionate about different communities ability to access & utilise the benefits of @kineuphorics in any field or place that they were in. [sic]'\n\nFlorence Welch chose to mark her seventh year sober with a touching post of support to others during this tumultuous time.\n\n'I am 7 years sober today,' Welch wrote on Instagram, February 2, before adding, 'I send my love and support to anyone who is struggling. If you are feeling shaky around ED issues, drugs or alcohol, I completely understand.\n\n'The desire to disassociate is so strong. But please don’t give up. We are going to need you on the other side.'\n\nHer post included a picture of her hand touching a painting of the number 7 surrounded by a heart with two arrows in it.\n\nThe 34-year-old singer first spoke about her path to sobriety in a interview for Billboard in 2015. 'I used to drink before every performance, I’m quite shy, really -- that’s probably why I used to drink a lot. But I don’t anymore. When I finally took time off to make this new record, I had time to strengthen. And when I was coming back into the fray, I really didn’t want to lose that. I thought I could go dive-bomb back into it, but look what happened. I dived into it and literally broke myself.'\n\nFlorence revealed this personal revelation to the outlet a little over a year after she decided to give up alcohol.\n\nThe singer recently marked 18 months of sobriety.\n\nIn a selfie posted to Instagram on January 27, the Smile songstress held up a grey keyring with a message that reads: 'Clean and Serene for eighteen months.'\n\nAllen has been refreshingly open in talking about her sobriety journey over the years. Earlier this month, the British star appeared on The Recovery podcast to talk about her lifelong addiction battle.\n\n'I'm in a really happy and healthy relationship,' she said, before referencing her husband, Stranger Things actor David Harbour, who she married last year.\n\n'He's sober, has been sober for 20 years now. We're thinking about what we're going to do with the rest of our lives... I don't have as much as I had then in terms of success and wealth, but I have success and health in my mind, which is more valuable I think.'\n\nMoss who was once infamous for her love of a good party (buckets of champagne included), now has a more holistic take on life.\n\nThe model has been reportedly clean for two years. Producer and close friend of the model DJ Fat Tony spoke of Moss's sobriety in a 2020 stating that 'Kate's been clean for over two years. Me and my sober mates now have a better time than we ever did when we used to drink and take drugs.' (via Daily Mail)\n\nIn a beauty interview for Elle.co.uk, the iconic model also revealed that her morning and evening also now reflect a more introspective approach.\n\nMorning must haves include 'Hot water and lemon. I try to have that first, and follow it up with a coffee'\n\n'and minimum of 'eight hours' sleep which she said 'I’m a bit groggy in the afternoon' without.\n\nThe star stopped drinking in 2013 following a brief stint in rehab. In a 2016 interview with US ELLE, the actor said that sobriety has helped him find structure in life.\n\n‘There was a moment when my morning routine was, like, Get up and Google yourself. But that stopped, dramatically and instantly, probably three years ago,’ he said.\n\n‘I realised that viewing yourself through other people's pictures is not living your own life. I wasn't really being myself. A lot of my hobbies had gone out the window. I couldn't skateboard or surf for fear of being followed. Crossing the line of fear is what leads to greatness.’\n\nThe ‘Gravity’ singer told Complex magazine in 2018 that it was after Drake’s 30th birthday party and a six day hangover than he decided to stop drinking.\n\n‘I looked out the window and I went, “OK, John, what percentage of your potential would you like to have? Because if you say you'd like 60, and you'd like to spend the other 40 having fun, that's fine,”’ he told Complex. ‘”But what percentage of what is available to you would you like to make happen? There's no wrong answer. What is it?” I went, “100.”’\n\nSia has been sober for 10 years after previously suffering with an addiction to drugs and alcohol.\n\n‘I was really unhappy being an artist and I was getting sicker and sicker,’ she told Billboard in 2013.\n\n‘I was an alcoholic and a drug addict, and I sobered up and decided I didn't want to be an artist anymore because I was starting to get a little bit famous, and it was destabilising in some way,’ she explained to James Corden in 2016.\n\n‘So I thought what doesn't exist in pop music at the moment? And it was mystery,’ she added, referring to her face-covering wig.\n\nIn 2018, she tweeted: ‘Eight years sober today. I love you, keep going. You can do it.’\n\nThe Magic Mike star told Men's Health in 2019 that he realised he had an alcohol abuse issues aged 25 after scooping a role in Spiderman.\n\n‘Drinking was a way for me not to have to deal with me,’ he told the publication. ‘And I think that acting was a way for me to not have to be me either. So I could go onstage and not be me, come offstage and go to the bar and not be me. Rinse and repeat.’\n\nHe has been sober for 18 years and practises transcendental meditation and works out to maintain a healthy body and mind.\n\nThe DJ has opened up about his relationship alcohol in previous years, revealing in 2018 on Twitter that he would often drink two bottles of Jack Daniels a night and live on Greggs pasties.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC in 2009, the producer said that while he was never an ‘alcoholic’, drink was affecting his life.\n\n‘My live shows are a million times better now,’ he told the news outlet. ‘If you drink, you can't even remember if it's a good show or not - and that's probably for the best, because it would have been rubbish because I'd have been drunk and not making any sense. The fact that people would pay to see a show and I'd not be on form - it wasn't fair. It's not fair on anyone.’\n\nThe actor’s alcohol issues began in childhood and resulted in drug addiction, too.\n\nFollowing several stints in rehab during his career, some run ins with the law and a stint in prison, he finally got clean.\n\n‘Job one is get out of that cave,’ he told Vanity Fair in 2014 about what he has learnt over the years. ‘A lot of people do get out but don't change.\n\n'So the thing is to get out and recognise the significance of that aggressive denial of your fate, come through the crucible forged into a stronger metal. Or whatever. But I don't even know if that was my experience.’"
