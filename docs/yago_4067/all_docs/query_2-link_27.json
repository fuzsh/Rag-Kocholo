        "text": "The Great and Good gathered at St Michael Church in Munich last month to celebrate one of the region’s most influential aristocrats Franz, Duke of Bavaria, on his 90th birthday. City streets were abuzz as friends, family and politicians arrived for the Service of Thanksgiving, which paid tribute to the life of the famously low-key Franz.\n\nRead More\n\nAs Prince Ludwig of Bavaria, one of the world’s most eligible bachelors, celebrates his first wedding anniversary, Tatler opens up the romantic photograph album from the event\n\nPrince Ludwig of Bavaria, 41, married Sophie Evekink at a Munich church before celebrating with a reception at Nymphenburg Palace\n\nAmong those invited were the Duke’s cousin and heir Prince Ludwig of Bavaria and his new wife Princess Sophie of Bavaria, whose recent wedding reception took place at the family property of Nymphenburg Palace. Traditional costume, music and culture were all showcased in spectacular fashion outside.\n\nBut who is the man of the hour, the Head of the House of Wittelsbach? A pioneering figure – with a claim to the British throne – here is everything you need to know.\n\nBorn on the 14 July 1933 in Bavaria’s capital Munich, Franz was the third child and elder son of Albrecht, Duke of Bavaria, and his first wife, Countess Maria Draskovich of Trakostjan, member of the House of Drašković, a Croatian noble family. Aged 15, Franz was given the title of ‘Prince of Bavaria’, after his grandfather Crown Prince Rupprecht recognised his parents’ marriage as dynastic (it had previously been considered morganatic).\n\nRead More\n\nThe gilded history of Germany’s Nymphenburg Palace where Prince Ludwig of Bavaria held his royal wedding reception\n\nNymphenburg Palace, one of Europe’s most opulent royal residences, recently welcomed Prince Ludwig of Bavaria and his new bride\n\nFranz’s great-grandfather was Ludwig III, the last reigning monarch of Bavaria. He lost his throne at the end of the First World War, as the German Empire was dissolved and the Weimar Republic created, with all the German state monarchies abolished in the process. Today, descendants are only ‘pretenders’ to the defunct throne, with the job of representing its history.\n\nThe Wittelsbachs were strongly opposed to the Nazis and fled during the Second World War – Franz and his siblings fled to Hungary with his mother and siblings, whilst his father sought refuge in Italy. Ultimately, he and his family were captured and spent much of wartime in concentration camps such as Dachau.\n\nFranz, who succeeded as Duke of Bavaria in 2016, has been in a relationship with Dr Thomas Greinwald since 1980. The pair have never married. In 2021, the couple appeared together in an official portrait in what is thought to be the first public acknowledgement of a same-sex relationship by the head of a current or former royal dynasty.\n\nRead More\n\nScottish balls, BBQs and plenty of kilts: unearthing the fascinating legacy of Balmoral\n\nAs King Charles III opens the doors to Balmoral for the first ever time Tatler opens the history books to reveal the legacy of the Scottish royal residence\n\nAs Franz, Duke of Bavaria has never fathered children, he will be succeeded by his brother, Prince Max of Bavaria, 86. Prince Max has five daughters but no sons and so, owing to the rules of male-preference primogeniture, the title will then pass to their cousin Prince Luitpold and his descendants, including Prince Ludwig and any future male heirs.\n\nHowever, the Duke of Bavaria also has ties to another royal household. Franz is descended from King Charles I’s daughter Henrietta, a member of the Stuart family whom some consider the rightful heir to both England and Scotland. Were it not for a law passed at the beginning of the 18th century, the Duke of Bavaria might have also held the title as our current king. In 1701, the Act of Settlement effectively banned all Catholics from taking the throne. Passed by Queen Anne, it was done to solidify the Protestant rule of Great Britain. As a result, many Jacobites consider Franz to be the true heir to the throne of Scotland, and thus also the true King of England. In 2008, a spokesman for the Duke commented on this issue.\n\nRead More\n\nInside the hidden world of royal letter writing\n\nIn a corner of social media, devoted royal supporters take pride in writing – and receiving – letters\n\n‘All this interest in his opinion makes him smile because, really, he is very happy and satisfied with being the Duke of Bavaria’, he said."
