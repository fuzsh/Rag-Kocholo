        "text": "For other people named Maria Theresa of Austria, see Maria Theresa of Austria (disambiguation).\n\nMaria Theresia Henriette Dorothee of Austria-Este (2 July 1849 – 3 February 1919) was a Queen consort of Bavaria and a Jacobite pretender. She was the daughter and only child of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este and his wife, Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria. She was the last Queen of Bavaria and the Jacobite pretender as Mary IV and III from 1875 until her death.\n\nContents\n\n1 Ancestry and Family\n\n2 Biography\n\n3 Jacobite pretender\n\n4 Children\n\n5 Titles, styles, honours and arms\n\n5.1 Titles and styles\n\n6 Ancestry\n\n7 Bibliography\n\n8 Sources\n\n9 External links\n\nAncestry and Family\n\nHer paternal grandparents were Francis IV, Duke of Modena, and Princess Maria Beatrice of Savoy. Her maternal grandparents were Archduke Josef Anton of Austria and his third wife Duchess Maria Dorothea of Württemberg.\n\nMaria Theresa was born at Brünn in Moravia, now Brno in the Czech Republic. On 15 December 1849, when she was only five months old, her father Archduke Ferdinand died from typhoid. Maria Theresa was raised by her mother Archduchess Elisabeth.\n\nOn 18 April 1854, Archduchess Elisabeth married Archduke Karl Ferdinand of Austria, Duke of Teschen, by whom she had six children:\n\nArchduke Franz Joseph (1855-1855)\n\nArchduke Friedrich (1856–1936)\n\nArchduchess Maria Christina (1858–1929), later wife of King Alfonso XII of Spain\n\nArchduke Karl Stephan (1860–1933)\n\nArchduke Eugen (1863–1954)\n\nArchduchess Maria Eleonora (1864–1964)\n\nThrough her mother, Maria Theresa was also first cousin to Princess Stephanie of Belgium, Crown Princess of Austria-Hungary; and Princess Clementine of Belgium, Princess Napoleon; and Maria Dorothea, Duchess of Orleans.\n\nBiography\n\nOn February 20, 1868, she married Prince Ludwig, eldest son of Prince Regent Luitpold, in the Augustinerkirche in Vienna. The couple had fallen in love with each other during a visit of Ludwig at Pfingsten in Austria to attend the burial of Archduchess Mathilda of Austria, who was his cousin and a friend of Maria Theresa, in representation of King Ludwig II of Bavaria in 1867, and they decided to marry, which initially angered the Emperor, who had wished for her to marry Ferdinand IV, Grand Duke of Tuscany. The chief witness was Count Antonius Schaffgotsch, just the one who baptised Maria Theresa the new princess.\n\nAfter marriage, Maria Theresa spent most time raising her children. The couple lived a humble life in spite of the bright future that they would probably become King and Queen of Bavaria in future. With no official salary the family mostly lived on their farms at Leutstetten south of Munich, where Maria Theresa had her famous rose gardens.\n\nMaria Theresa got various orders:\n\nDame of the (Austrian) Order of the Starry Cross (January 10, 1865);\n\nGrand Mistress of the (Bavarian) Order of Theresia and of the (Bavarian) Order of Saint Elisabeth (October 19, 1872);\n\nDame of the (Spanish) Order of Maria Luisa;\n\nThe (Austrian) Order of Elisabeth 1st Class, the Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown, the Cross of Merit for the Year 1870/71, the Cross of Merit for Voluntary Nursing, and the (Prussian) Red Cross Medal 2nd Class.\n\nMaria Theresa became queen consort of Bavaria in 1913 when her husband the reigning Prince Regent proclaimed king himself as King Ludwig III in place of his living but insane cousin King Otto. She became the first Catholic queen in Bavaria since Bavaria was made a kingdom 1806. She spoke German, Hungarian, Czech, French, and Italian. In 1914, she hosted great festivities to the royal Bavarian jubilee and appeared with her spouse to announce the war. During World War I, she was a great patriot and also supported the Habsburg monarchy. She encouraged the women of Bavaria to support the soldiers by providing food and clothes for them with references to legendary heroines and visited wounded soldiers.\n\nOn November 7, 1918, Ludwig III was forced to abdicate Bavarian throne, and Maria Theresa fled Munich with her family to Wildenwart Castle near Frasdorf, in order to escape from Bolsheviks. The health of the Queen soon fell and she died there on February 3, 1919, and was buried at the local chapel. On November 5, 1921, her remains were transferred to the cathedral of Munich along with those of her husband, who died less than a month before.\n\nJacobite pretender\n\nShe was the niece and heir of the childless Francis V, Duke of Modena, Jacobite pretender to the thrones of England and Scotland; as such, Jacobites styled her Queen Mary IV and III after his death in 1875. Her son Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria inherited the Jacobite claim.\n\nChildren\n\nMaria Theresa and Ludwig III of Bavaria were parents to thirteen children.\n\nRupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria (1869–1955).
