        "text": "Sophie-Alexandra Evekink and Prince Ludwig of Bavaria just tied the knot in St. Kajetan church in Munich last May 20, 2023. But the royal wedding was not without hiccups. Royal blogger ChristinZ live-tweeted the incident where “A spokesperson confirmed that Princess Sophie fainted during the wedding.” Luckily, Prince Ludwig swooped in and caught his bride before she fell. “After a drink she was fine again and the ceremony continued,” ChristinZ wrote in a tweet.\n\nQuoting German newspaper Bild, ChristinZ tweets, “The maid of honours rushed over, paramedics brought her water. She felt well again straight away. Prince Leopold of Bavaria gave her a piece of glucose.”\n\nMinor health scare aside, the German royal wedding was a fairytale come true! Scroll on and see all the details you might have missed.\n\nThe Bride’s Wedding Dress\n\nThe bride donned a breathtaking Reem Acra lace wedding gown that featured a swooping neckline, an exquisite A-line skirt with layers of delicate lace that matched its sheer sleeves. Her Reem Acra wedding frock had a matching cathedral-length veil hemmed with lace. In an Instagram post by the Royal House of Bayern, the veil was created by Ukranian designer WONA. It features a lion, maple leaf, and tulip embroidered at the bottom center of the veil, which symbolizes Sophie’s heritage as a Dutch-Canadian and honoring her marriage to the German prince.\n\nThe bride emphasizes their union by carrying a bespoke handkerchief by dressmaker Catarina von Lerchenfeld, a cousin of the groom. It also served as Princess Sophie’s “something blue” as the couple’s initials were sewn in light blue thread on the fabric which came from the bride’s grandmother.\n\nIn the jewelry department, Princess Sophie borrowed a simple Catholic cross necklace with matching drop earrings from her Canadian cousin John de Jong. The jewelry set complemented the bride’s stunning Bavarian Sapphire Floral Tiara, belonging to Prince Ludwig’s branch of the family. The tiara is believed to have been first worn by Princess Isabella Antonie of Croÿ, who married Prince Franz of Bavaria in 1912.\n\nThe bride also carried a Lily of the Valley flower bouquet which is known to be a favorite among royals, including the late Queen Elizabeth II. In the Victorian era, the flowers signified a return to happiness, while today, these tiny blooms are known to be associated with motherhood and happiness. It is also a popular symbol of spring as it fully blooms in May.\n\nThe Bridal Beauty Look\n\nSophie-Alexandra’s beauty was further enhanced by her half-up hairstyle, embellished with cascading soft ribbon curls. For her makeup, the bride opted for a natural sun-kissed look, featuring a subtle pink lip.\n\nThe Groom’s Suit\n\nPrince Ludwig exuded timeless charm in his ensemble, sporting gray pinstripe trousers and a distinguished black suit jacket. Elevating his wedding attire, he chose a light gray waistcoat and a paisley-printed tie.\n\nThe Venue\n\nThe couple exchanged their vows at the illustrious Theatinerkirch, also known as St. Kajetan church, a captivating venue nestled in the heart of Munich. Following the ceremony, a splendid reception awaited them at the majestic Nymphenburg Palace, which was graciously hosted by Ludwig’s cousin, Franz, Duke of Bavaria.\n\nHis Eminence Cardinal Reinhard Marx officiated the wedding, which welcomed around 700 esteemed guests from the realms of politics, culture, and society. The celebration was further enriched by delegations representing Bavarian traditional costume associations, sports shooters, and Bavarian mountain riflemen, who paid tribute to the couple’s deep-rooted ties to Bavarian heritage.\n\nLudwig holds the esteemed title of the eldest son of Prince Luitpold and the great-great-grandson of Bavaria’s last King Ludwig III. He is in line to become the head of Bavaria. The prince is an expert in human rights and international humanitarian law. He also serves as a board member of the Nymphenburg Aid Association and has also established multiple nonprofit organizations in Kenya.\n\nMeanwhile, Sophie was born in Singapore to a Dutch-Canadian family. She is set to receive her doctorate at the Law Faculty at Oxford University, where she also teaches a course on transitional justice at the university’s Criminology Centre. Princess Sophie also worked for the United Nations on health and human rights."
