        "text": "Louis III (born Jan. 7, 1845, Munich [Germany]—died Oct. 18, 1921, Sárvár, Hung.) was the last king of Bavaria, from 1913 to 1918, when the revolution of November 7–8 brought the rule of the Wittelsbach dynasty to an end.\n\nIn 1868 he married Maria Theresa, daughter of the archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este. In December 1912, on the death of his father, the regent Luitpold, Louis took over the regency for his insane cousin, King Otto I. On Nov. 5, 1913, although Otto was still alive, Louis assumed the royal title himself.\n\nThe new king was interested chiefly in improving agriculture and transportation but also continued the traditional Wittelsbach patronage of the arts. In World War I he took as little part as was possible, though from 1917 he opposed the military policies of Erich Ludendorff, de facto head of the imperial German army."
