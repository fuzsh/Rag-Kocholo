        "text": "Congratulations are in order for Prince Ludwig of Bavaria and Sophie-Alexandra Evekink, who welcomed their first baby earlier this week.\n\nThe couple, who were married in May 2023, shared the news with delighted followers on Instagram, revealing Sophie had given birth to a little boy on 6 August 2024. In a touching move, Ludwig and Sophie shared they had named their firstborn Prince Rupprecht. It appears to be a nod to the Prince's great-great grandfather Crown Prince Rupprecht, who was the eldest child of Ludwig III and the last King of Bavaria. He died in 1955.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nIn the post on social media, the couple detailed how Princess Sophie and Prince Ruppercht were doing well following the birth. The caption explained, 'Princess Sophie and Prince Ludwig of Bavaria are delighted to announce the birth of their first child. Prince Rupprecht Theodor Maria was born on August 6, 2024 in Munich.\n\n‘Mother and child are in excellent health, the young family are now enjoying their first days together.’\n\nRead More\n\n‘Gold digger’, ‘bimbo’, ‘trapped in a loveless marriage’…, have we got Melania Trump all wrong?\n\nOn the eve of the US presidential election back in 2020, friends, DC insiders and Melania herself told Ben Judah how a small-time Slovenian fashion model rose to wear the mantle of First Lady\n\nPrince Ludwig and Sophie exchanged vows in a ceremony at the Theatine Church, before a reception, hosted by Franz, Duke of Bavaria, took place at the breathtaking Nymphenburg Palace. Prince Ludwig is the great-great-grandson of the last King of Bavaria, his namesake, King Ludwig III, who ruled from 1913 to 1918. Ludwig III lost his throne in 1918 at the end of the First World War, as the German Empire was dissolved and the Weimar Republic inaugurated, with all German state monarchies abolished in the process. Today, descendants remain mere ceremonial figureheads of royal houses, rather than enthroned ‘rulers’.\n\nSophie is a Dutch-Canadian national, who has been researching for her PhD at the Faculty of Law at Oxford. She has previously worked for the UN on health and human rights policy, alongside having taught on transnational justice at Oxford’s Criminology Centre. Of all the world’s Princesses, Sophie can certainly be said to have her finger on the pulse of global issues and current affairs.\n\nRead More\n\nHe’s the bad-boy chef whose butter videos go viral on Tiktok. But who is the real Thomas Straker – and is he actually dating a princess?\n\nIn Tatler’s September 2024 issue, the hottest chef on the planet spoke to Harriet Kean about working for a billionaire, that scandal and butter (of course)\n\nUpon the announcement of their wedding, the couple made a very considered statement regarding gifts: ‘The bridal couple are […] mindful of the number of global crises which have taken place in the recent period […] As a result, for the wedding the fiancées have, instead of presents, encouraged a call for donations towards such humanitarian initiatives.’\n\nUntil he was snapped up by Sophie, Ludwig was considered one of the world’s most eligible royal bachelors. Also a man with a global outlook, he studied law at Göttingen, where he specialised in human rights and international humanitarian law.\n\nHe is the son of Prince Luitpold and Katrin Beatrix Wiegand. Because the ruling Duke of Bavaria, Franz – who is aged 89 – has never fathered any children, he will be succeeded by his brother, Prince Max, 86. Prince Max has five daughters but no sons and so, owing to male-preference primogeniture, the title will then passed to Prince Luitpold and his offspring, including Prince Ludwig and potentially a baby boy!\n\nAt the request of Franz, the Duke of Bavaria, Ludwig has taken on a large number of ceremonial roles in the territory. He looks likely to become a truly modern head to the House of Wittlesbach and an influential figure in German society."
