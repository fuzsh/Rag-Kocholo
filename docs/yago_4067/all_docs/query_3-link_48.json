        "text": "The Last King of Bavaria's Special Golden Wedding Anniversary Coin\n\nIn 1913 Ludwig Luitpold Josef Maria Aloys Alfried became the Prince Regent of Bavaria (Bayern) succeeding his father, Prince Regent Luitpold who died on December 12, 1912.\n\nAt his swearing-in ceremonies, Ludwig assumed the title Prince Regent Ludwig III von Bayern.\n\nAt his side was his wife Maria Theresa, former Archduchess of Austria-Este, whom Ludwig had married on February 20, 1868.\n\nDid you notice the reference last King in the heading above?\n\nAlmost immediately certain elements in the press, Bavarian society, influential business leaders and political partisans, throughout the territory, called for Ludwig to be installed as King of Bavaria instead of Prince Regent. The Bavarian Legislature had already ended its 1912 session and would not reassemble until September 29, 1913. On November 4, 1913, the Legislature amended the constitution of Bavaria to include a clause specifying, If a regency for reasons of incapacity had lasted for ten years with no expectation that the king would ever be able to reign, the regent could proclaim the end of the regency and the demise of the crown, with such action to be ratified by the Legislature. The amendment received broad party support in the Lower Chamber where it was carried by a vote of 122 yas in favor, and 27 neines against. The Senate produced only six neines against the amendment. The next day, November 5, 1913, Ludwig proclaimed to the Legislature the end of the regency and deposed his cousin King Otto. The Legislature recognized Ludwig as King Ludwig III of Bavaria.\n\nBavaria had belonged to the German Empire since 1871 and was consequently forced to participate in World War I. With the proclamation of the Free State of Bavaria on 7 November 1918, Ludwig was removed as king. The monarchy was abolished and the king banished. Thus Ludwig III was the last King of Bavaria.\n\nDuring his leadership, he authorized the Munich Mint (mint mark D) to strike the following coins:\n\nFollowing photo links courtesy of Worldcoingallery:\n\n1914-D silver 2 Mark - 28mm, 0.3215 ounce Actual Silver Weight. (573,533 for circulation - unknown amount of proofs)\n\nBAVARIA 1914-D SILVER 2 MARKS - LUDWIG III\n\n1914-D silver 3 Mark - 33mm, 04823 oz. ASW. (717,460 circulation - unknown amount proofs)\n\nBAVARIA 1914-D SILVER 3 MARK - LUDWIG III\n\n1913-D and 1914-D silver 5 Mark - 38mm, 0.8037 oz. ASW. (142,500 circulation)\n\nBAVARIA 1913-14 D SILVER 5 MARKS - LUDWIG III\n\n1914-D gold 20 Mark - 22.5mm, 0.2305 oz. AGW. (532,851 circulation - inknown amount proofs). No photo available, but same designs obverse and reverse as the silver coins.\n\nIn 1918 King Ludwig III authorized a special silver 3 Mark (33mm, 0.4823 oz. ASW) commemorative coin (only 130 minted) be issued to celebrate his and Queen Maria Theresa's Golden (50 years) Wedding Anniversary\n\nBecause only 130 of these were minted, I was unable to locate a photo. Here's a desription:\n\nIf you have a Krause 1901-2000 WORLD COINScatalog you can turn to the German States section, locate Bavaria and find KM# 1010 (previous to 2010 edition reference number KM# 523). The obverse bears the jugate heads of King Ludwig III and Queen Maria Theresa facing right with the dates 1868-1918 centered inside the rim at 6:00 o'clock. The legend Circling the rim of the coin from approximately 7:00 o'clock to 5:00 o'clock reads &quot;LUDWIG III MARIE THERESE V BAYERN.&quot; The reverse features the Crowned Imperial Eagle with shield on breast and the text &quot;DREI MARK&quot; centered at 6:00 just inside rim. The legend, partially encircling the coin, just inside the rim, reads from about 9:00 o'clock to 3:00 o'clock &quot;DEUTCHES REICH 1918.&quot;\n\nHere's a photo of a painting of Ludwig III when he was Prince Regent courtesy of Webshots (news.webshots.com)\n\nPHOTO OF PAINTING OF LUDWIG III AS PRINCE REGENT\n\nHere's a photo of a painting of Ludwig III as King courtesy of Webshots (news.webshots.com)\n\nPHOTO OF A PAINTING OF LUDWIG III AS KING\n\nHere's a photo of Queen Maria Theresa (Webshots photo):\n\nPHOTO OF QUEEN MARIA THERESA\n\nHere's a photo of King Ludwig III and Queen Maria Theresa (Webshots photo):\n\nPHOTO OF KING LUDWIG III AND QUEEN MARIA THERESA\n\nThought you'd like to know...\n\nClinker"
