And I love it. Not sure the Archduke was the type for a long term relationship. I like the story of the bath house brawl that got him sent off to live in Salzburg.\n\nMarriage to the king would be great for Sophie Charlotte. He wouldn't have pestered her for you know what and the charity bazaar fire would have been butterflied away!\n\nCheeky. And I love it.
