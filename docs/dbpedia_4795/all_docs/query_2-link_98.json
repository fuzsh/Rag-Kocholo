        "text": "One of the most dramatic and mysterious sections on the Napali Coast is Honopu, which consists of two pristine white-sand beaches, backed by steep 1,200’ cliffs and separated by the famous 90’ Honopu Arch. The name Honopu means “conch shell” in Hawaiian, because of the sound the northerly winds make when they blow through the arch.\n\nBecause it’s extremely difficult and dangerous to access, most visitors to Hawaii will never step foot on the beach at Honopu. Boats and even kayaks are not permitted to land on the beach, so anyone wanting to go has to literally swim there, which is quite dangerous given the strong rip currents and pounding surf.\n\nThis is just as well since Honopu is most definitely sacred.\n\nArcheological evidence discovered in the 1920s suggests that a human population flourished in this valley but then disappeared suddenly, which is why Honopu is sometimes called the Valley of the Lost Tribe. It’s also rumored in some circles that Honopu Valley was the last home of Kauai’s fabled Menuhune tribe of little people.\n\nExplore the beauty and adventure on one of our Kauai boat tours to the Napali Coast, Niihau and Lehua Crater. We are conveniently located in Port Allen, to serve guests of Kauai staying in Koloa, Poipu, Waimea, Kapaa, Wailua, Lihue, Kilauea, Hanalei, and Princeville.\n\nWe recognize the proper use of the Hawaiian language including the ‘okina [‘], a consonant, and the kahakō [ō] or macron (e.g., in place names of Hawai‘i such as Nāpali). However, these have been omitted from this website for the best online experience for our visitors. We realize the importance and continue to use them outside of the online platform."
