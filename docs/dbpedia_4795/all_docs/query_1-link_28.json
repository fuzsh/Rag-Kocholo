        "text": "Kamehameha I (born November 1758?, Kohala district, Hawaii island—died May 8, 1819, Kailua) was a Hawaiian conqueror and king who, by 1810, had united all the Hawaiian islands and founded the Kamehameha dynasty, the most-enduring and best-documented line of Hawaiian rulers.\n\nFirst named Paiea, meaning “Hard-Shelled Crab,” the future sovereign was the son of Keoua, a high chief, and of Kekuiapoiwa, a daughter of the former king Alapai. A Hawaiian tradition tells that a bright star, Kokoiki, appeared just before the great conqueror was born. The date of the legend coincides with the appearance of Halley’s Comet in 1758. When Kokoiki was viewed by the kahunas, Hawaii’s mystic seers, it was prophesied that a great leader was about to be born who would defeat all his rivals and reign supreme over all the islands. The infant prince was ordered to be put to death by Alapai but was reared secretly and grew to manhood, taking the name Kamehameha, meaning “The Very Lonely One” or “The One Set Apart.”\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nAt the death of King Kalaniopuu in 1782, the island of Hawaii was divided between his son, Kiwalao, and his nephew, Kamehameha. Despite jealousy between the two cousins, relations were peaceful until July 1782, when a dispute between their chiefs at Keomo led to the outbreak of war. In the ensuing battle at Mokuohai, Kiwalao was slain. Kamehameha then embarked upon a series of conquests that by 1795 had brought all the islands but Kauai and Niihau under his control. When these were ceded to him through peaceful negotiations in 1810, Kamehameha was undisputed ruler of the entire island group.\n\nAlthough autocratic in principle, Kamehameha set up governors to administer each island. He retained the traditional harsh kapu system of laws and punishments, but he also promulgated the mamalahoe kanawai, “the law of the splintered paddle,” which protected the common people from unduly brutal aggressions of powerful chiefs. He also outlawed human sacrifice, rites that had been performed in former times to increase the mana, or sacred power, of the king."
