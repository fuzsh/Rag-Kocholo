        "text": "TRANSCRIPT\n\nShe was the first and the only woman to rule as the Queen of the Kingdom of Hawai.\n\nThis was the first time that America took over a sovereign nation.\n\n1895, Honolulu, Hawai.\n\nAfter her overthrow by American businessmen, Queen Liliokalani was arrested by the provisional U.S.- led government and placed under house arrest.\n\nLiliokalani was marched from her private residence to Lolani Palace, where she was locked in a bedroom suite and kept captive for months.\n\nTo occupy herself, she stitched a quilt telling her life story, composed hymns.\n\n'That first night of my imprisonment was the longest night I had ever passed in my life.\n\nIt seemed as though the dawn of day would never come.\n\nI am imprisoned in this room for the attempt of the Hawaiian people to regain what had been wrested from them.'. The queen was born Lydia Lili Kamaka'eha in 1838, at the base of an extinct volcano near Honolulu, to a family of high chiefs and advisors to the king.\n\nFollowing Hawaiian tradition, she was raised by parents of higher rank than her own.\n\n'Immediately after my birth, I was taken to the house of another chief, by whom I was adopted.\n\nIt is not easy to explain to those alien to our national life, but it seems perfectly natural to us.'. Liliokalani became part of the Royal Court of King Kamehameha the Fourth, who ruled the eight-island kingdom of Hawai for a decade - a constitutional monarchy modeled after the British system.\n\nIt was a very, very strategically important point to the British, to the Americans, and to the Japanese.\n\nAnd there was quite a bit of wrangling in the 19th century over what countries should have control over the Hawaiian Kingdom.\n\nBaptized as a Christian from age four, Liliokalani was educated at an English language school for children of the Royal Court, run by American missionaries.\n\nThe first American missionaries arrived in Hawai in 1820.\n\nAnd their sons and grandsons went into the sugarcane business, buying up land to establish plantations.\n\nAnd there was active suppression of the speaking and teaching of the Hawaiian language.\n\nLiliokalani showed musical talent early on.\n\nShe had perfect pitch and played numerous instruments.\n\nIn the late 1860s, she composed music that would be adopted as the national hymn of the sovereign Nation of Hawai.\n\nLater on, she would write 'Aloha e,' which is still to this day probably the best known Hawaiian song.\n\n'To compose was as natural to me as to breathe.\n\nMy ancestors were particularly gifted as lovers of poetry and music.\n\nAnd yet there are few, if any, written compositions of the music of Hawaii, except those published by me.'. Music was her consolation, and it was her opportunity to speak directly to her people.\n\nMy name is Meleanna Aluli Meyer.\n\nI'm an artist, educator, and student of all things Hawaiian.\n\nMy great grand aunt was a lady in waiting, a confidant of the queen.\n\nI lead groups of youth and artists in examining not only history, but their creative, visual voice.\n\nNative Hawaiians and others in the community respond to these murals in a very profound way because we're actually making visible aspects of pain and sorrow and loss, to help people understand our legacy.\n\nOur murals depict who we are.\n\nIn her twenties, Liliokalani went door to door to raise money to build Hawai's first hospital.\n\nQueen's Hospital opened in 1860 to combat diseases brought by foreigners, such as smallpox and influenza, which had decimated almost 85% of the native Hawaiian population in 50 years.\n\nIn 1862, Liliokalani married John Dominis, a white American raised in Honolulu and a commander in the Royal Court.\n\nShe later turned her attention to philanthropy, founding a bank for women and setting up a fund to support the education of Hawaiian girls.\n\nAfter her younger brother, David Kalakaua, became Hawai's king, he made her heir apparent in 1877.\n\nBut the white business-class ended up gaining much of the economic power in the islands, not only the plantations, but also the churches, the schools, and many other cultural institutions.\n\nMore unsettlingly, Liliokalani started to realize that her brother's cabinet was filled with very corrupt businessmen.\n\nIn 1887, white businessmen forced her brother, the king, to sign a new constitution that weakened the monarchy and removed the right of native Hawaiians to vote, unless they were landowners.\n\nIt became known as the 'Bayonet Constitution.'. 'Having matured their plans in secret, the men of foreign birth rose one day en masse, and forced the king to sign a constitution, which practically took away the franchise from the Hawaiian race.'. When her brother died suddenly in 1891, Liliokalani assumed the throne, becoming the first and only sovereign queen of Hawai.\n\nWith support from the majority of native Hawaiians, she attempted to overturn the Bayonet Constitution.\n\nThe constitution she was putting forward was one that would have restored voting rights to native Hawaiians and would have increased her powers as a constitutional monarch.\n\nBut the white businessmen and politicians were already plotting her overthrow.\n\nQueen Liliokalani became the target of what can only be described as a vicious smear campaign against her in the U.S.\n\npress.\n\nThe San Francisco Examiner described her as a 'black pagan queen who wanted nothing short of absolute monarchy.'. 'A trap was sprung upon me by those who stood waiting, as a wild beast watches for his prey.'. January of 1893, a battalion of U.S. Marines marched through downtown Honolulu.\n\nThey had a cannon and machine guns.\n\nWithin 48 hours, the Kingdom of Hawai'i had been overthrown and a provisional government led by U.S. businessman was in charge.\n\nIt was essentially a bloodless coup.\n\nQueen Liliokalani traveled to the U.S. to appeal to the president and Congress to restore her to the throne.\n\nIt would be very, very unusual for a woman of color to demand a meeting with not only the president, but many other people in Washington at the time.\n\nAnd so while she might have presented as a demure woman in Victorian-era modest clothing, she also contained within her the fierceness of the native Hawaiian goddess.\n\n'I would undertake anything for the benefit of my people.\n\nIt is for them that I would give my last drop of blood.'. President Grover Cleveland agreed the queen should be reinstated, but Congress rejected that recommendation.\n\nAnd on July 4th, 1894, American businessman Sanford Dole, whose family soon found Dole Food Company, declared himself Hawai's Ppresident and placed the queen under house arrest for eight months.\n\nThe overthrow caused trauma, not only of a political sort, but a spiritual and an ethical sort, because we sought to bring our queen back and reinstate her through laws and policies that we counted on.\n\nWe even had a petition of over 37,000 signatures.\n\nSo it's like being left with nothing except a shell of who we were.\n\nSo it's taken a long time to rebuild.\n\nLiliokalani is the reason we all do the work we do.\n\nAnd there are many of us everywhere - in education, in health, in advocacy for land.\n\nWe are doing the work of the queen today, bringing the culture back, so that Hawaiians can thrive.\n\nLiliokalani was released in 1895.\n\nShe spent the rest of her life advocating for native Hawaiian rights and culture.\n\nIn 1909, she sued the U.S. government to return the 1.75 million acres of Hawaiian royal lands it had seized, but it was unsuccessful.\n\nShe passed in 1917, giving all of her monies to the children of Hawai.\n\nYou've got Gandhi, Mandela, King, all of these leaders, but before all of them, you had a woman in the far-flung Pacific, who is a leader for all, in terms of peace, social justice, and righteous action for her people.\n\nHawai'i became the 50th state in 1959.\n\nIn 1993, the U.S. Congress issued an apology acknowledging that the overthrow of Queen Liliokalani had been illegal.\n\n'Never cease to act because you fear you may fail.\n\nThe true secret is to know your own worth.\n\nIt will carry you through many dangers.'"
