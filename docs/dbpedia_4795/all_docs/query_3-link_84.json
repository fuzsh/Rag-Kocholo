        "text": "List of common Hawaiian names of persons born in 1900-2008\n\n[edit]\n\nThis list of Hawaiian given names is based on a survey of persons born in 1900-1989 and 2000-2005, from obituaries in The Honolulu Advertiser and Honolulu Star Bulletin 1994-2004, and samples of births and marriages on O'ahu in Honolulu Star Bulletin 2000-2005.
