        "text": "Sharing Songs and Legends of the Wailua River Valley is a Family Tradition. In 1946, Walter Smith, Sr. and his wife, Emily, started our family business with a small rowboat and a borrowed outboard motor. Four generations later, we continue Grandpa’s tradition of sharing our love of Kauai and its rich cultural heritage.\n\nDuring the two mile river journey, you’ll hear songs and stories of ancient Hawaii — like the King’s Highway, sacred Mount Kapu, and the First Hau Tree. In addition, guests enjoy learning the hula during a lesson provided by one of our cousins. Everyone gets into the act during the river cruise!\n\nSmith’s famous Wailua River cruise boats are powered by an ingenious rear-engine system invented by Walter Smith, Sr. The spacious, open-air boats provide excellent views from either side during the trip upstream.\n\nThe Wailua River is known as “the only navigable river” in all Hawaii. The river’s fresh water pours down from Mt. Wai‘ale‘ale, one of the wettest spots on the planet. Lands along the river were the sacred capital of ancient Kauai and the birthplace of the island’s ali‘i, or royalty.\n\nAt the Fern Grotto landing, you’ll enjoy a short nature walk through the rainforest to the lush Fern Grotto.\n\nThe Fern Grotto is a geological wonder of Kauai. Ferns grow upside down from the roof of the grotto, which was formed millions of years ago. Native Hawaiian plants and colorful exotic tropical plants provide a rain-forest atmosphere.\n\nThe entire tour takes one hour and 20 minutes round-trip.\n\nWatch Video Highlights of the Wailua River Cruise"
