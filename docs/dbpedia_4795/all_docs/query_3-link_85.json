In addition to their sweet sounds, Hawaiian names also carry powerful depth and meaning.\n\n“Naming children, places and objects is important since a name carries mana [the spiritual energy of power], along with the hopes and dreams of family members,” explains David J. Wallace — better known by the honorific Kahu Dave — who is a native Hawaiian healer and author. “Names can serve as protection from evil or illness, and remind us of who we are and our purpose in life.”\n\nThe meaning behind Hawaiian baby names\n\nMost Hawaiian names, Kahu Dave explains, describe things in the natural world. “These metaphors have multiple meanings, known as kauna, that can change over time, revealing themselves at different stages of a person’s life,” he says.\n\nElements of nature are frequently used in Hawaiian baby names, including:\n\nOcean (Kai).\n\nHeaven (Lani).\n\nMountains (Mauna/Pu’u).\n\nWater (Kawai).\n\n“Each element or combination of elements will create a story and new meanings to the new word,” he says. “For example, by pairing Kawai (water) with Lani (heaven) we create the name Kawailani.”\n\nKahu Dave explains that Hawaiian names carry the hopes and dreams of parents and ancestors. “It tells a story, like a hula, with its imagery and hidden meanings that change over time,” he says. “Since there is so much meaning to a Hawaiian name, being able to share the story behind your name helps you connect to your ancestors as you prepare yourself for the future.”\n\nCultural sensitivity and Hawaiian baby names\n\nFor all the transporting beauty and symbolism behind Hawaiian names, do be mindful of sensitivities if you choose to give your baby any name outside of your own culture.\n\n“Name appropriation is a form of cultural appropriation and is something for white parents to consider when naming their children,” notes Jennifer Moss, the founder and CEO of BabyNames.com and one of the country’s foremost baby name experts.\n\nLike what you’re reading?\n\nJoin Care for free\n\nFirst name\n\nFirst name is required.\n\nLast name\n\nLast name is required.\n\nEmail\n\nZip code\n\nZip code is required.\n\nBy clicking “Join now,” you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n\nWe’re sorry, your request could not be processed at this time.

(See examples of these in our list below.)\n\nTo help inspire your Hawaiian baby name search, we sourced ideas from our experts, as well as scoured baby names websites to come up with our own curated list of 51 beautiful and unique Hawaiian baby names.\n\nHawaiian baby names created from western names\n\nKawika (kah-WEE-kah) is a Hawaiian form of David.
