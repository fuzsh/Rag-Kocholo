He is remembered for uniting the islands in 1810, for being a fierce warrior, and for ushering in an era of peace, prosperity, and unity to the Hawaiian Islands we know today; King Kamehameha Day is a celebration of everything he stood for and accomplished for the islands. This June will mark the 147th celebration of King Kamehameha, and each island celebrates the day a little bit differently.\n\nIn Kauai, we celebrate with the fabulous King Kamehameha Celebration Floral Parade in Lihue starting at Vidinha Stadium and ending at the lawn of the Historic County Building on Rice Street. The parade celebrates the paniolo (Hawaiian cowboy) traditions and is full of beautiful colors and dancers.\n\nAfter the parade, there is a Hoʻolauleʻa (Hawaiian festival) on the lawn of the Historic County Building with hula dancers, live Hawaiian entertainment, delicious food booths, craft vendors, and more!\n\nThe event is free, and is a great experience for the whole family. If you’re in Kauai on June 8th, we highly recommend you attend.\n\nWant more information on all the great things you can do in Kauai?
