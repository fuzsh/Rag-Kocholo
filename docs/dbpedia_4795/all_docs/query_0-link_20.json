        "text": "Princeville History (as well as other parts of Kauai)\n\nKauai’s History is both commemorative of and distinctively different from the other islands. Like the other islands, Kauai was initially inhabited roughly 1500 years ago by the same Polynesian adventurers who completed their nearly 2000-mile sea voyage on outrigger canoes when they first landed on the shores of the big island of Hawaii. (To expand this Princeville History section please also read our History of Hawaii section at Hawaii History). Here they stayed undisturbed for around 500 years, until a second wave of sea-canoe travelers appeared, this time from Tahiti, which was also originally settled by Polynesian sea-canoe explorers. It was from the Tahitian arrival that the current Hawaiian gods, belief structures, and many traditions evolved.\n\nKauai’s name has no particular historical meaning; however, through the legend of Hawaii loa, who is thought to have been the Polynesian founder of the Hawaiian island’s original inhabitants, “a favorite place around one’s neck” is suggested. According to legend, Kauai was the name of his favorite son, and a favorite place around one’s neck was (and perhaps still is) the universal place to carry one’s most beloved child. Despite the mystery behind Kauai’s proper name, an important part of Kauai’s History is in the preserving the ancient Hawaiian dialect, before it was extinct, which differs distinctly from current accepted Hawaiian language.\n\nEuropean traders did not discover the islands until the late 1700s, when in 1778, James Cook found and called them the “Sandwich Isles” after one of Cook’s expedition sponsors. Kauai, though, remained relatively untouched by the traders in comparison to the other islands. This could be due to the fact the Kauai was the only island among the Hawaiian chain that resisted domination from the reign of King Kamehameha, who during his reign in the late 17th century to early 18th century had conquered and united the rest of the islands in the archipelago.\n\nTwice King Kamehameha gathered armadas to conquer Kauai, and each time he was met with utter failure – due once to a storm and rough seas, and the other due to an epidemic which crippled his forces.\n\nEventually though, the king of Kauai, King Kaumualii, united forces with Kamehameha; probably to avoid future invasion attempts and to prevent continuing hostilities and any possible bloodshed which would ensue.\n\nKauai is Hawaii’s oldest island and Hanalei one of Kauai’s earliest population centers. The story begins in the early 1830s:\n\nPrinceville History in the early 1800s\n\n1810 – King Kaumualii, the last independent ruler of Kauai, negotiates a peaceful cession King Kamehameha I, effectively bringing Kauai under the control of the unified Kingdom of Hawaii.\n\n1821 – King Kamehameha II takes a 42-day voyage to Kauai\n\n1831 – Richard Charlton, British Consul to the Hawaiian Islands, leases lands between Hanalei and Kalihiwai from Governor Kaikioewa of Kaua’i to use as a cattle ranch. Longhorn cattle are imported from California, when California was still part of Mexico.\n\n1835 – The first successful sugarcane plantation is started in Koloa in Kauai and the first 8,000 pounds of sugar was shipped to the United States the following year. The sugar industry would dominate the island’s economy for more than a century.\n\n1834 – The Waioli Huiia Church, a United Church of Christ in Hanalei, is founded and the church, as it stands today, is built in 1912.\n\n1835 – The first sugar plantation opens on Kauai. Agriculture becomes a dominant economic force and during the first half of the 1800s and Hanalei harvests mulberry leaves, coffee, tobacco, cotton, rice, sugarcane, citrus fruits, peaches, pineapples, bananas, dates, tamarinds, guava, potatoes, plantains, cabbage, and lettuce.\n\n1842 – Following the Great Māhele, the Hawaiian land redistribution proposed by King Kamehameha III, British sea captain Godfrey Rhodes and Frenchman John Bernard are given a 50-year Government lease of 150 acres of land along the Hanalei River for a coffee plantation. (Refer to the Hawaii history section for details the 1839 Bill of Rights and the 1840 Constitution of Hawaii).\n\nRhodes builds a home near the future Hanalei Bridge site and names it Kikiula (it would later be called the Princeville Plantation House). The coffee plantation grows to almost 1,000 acres. Along with the neighboring Hanalei coffee plantation of Charles Titcomb, there are now 100,000 coffee trees being cultivated in Hanalei Valley.\n\n1844 – Robert Crichton Wyllie, Scottish physician and businessman, arrives in Hawaii with William Miller who has just been appointed British Consul to the Kingdom of Hawaii. While working under Miller, Wyllie compiles an in-depth report on the conditions in the islands, leading to King Kamehameha III appointing him Minister of Foreign Affairs, a position he holds for 15 years until his death in 1865.\n\n1848 – John Richard Kellett officially acquires the property encompassing the future Hanalei Plantation Hotel Resort acreage.\n\nPrinceville History in the second half of the 1800s\n\n1852 – It is thought that the first Chinese contract laborers arrive in Kauai to work in the sugar plantations around this time. (refer to Hawaii history for first imported workers from China). King Kamehameha III visits Hanalei.\n\n1853 – Wyllie acquires one of the two coffee plantations on the North Shore. Over the following decade he acquires an estimated 11,000 acres but battles against a blight that withers the coffee trees until he finally decides to plant sugar. He subsequently builds the full-scale cultivation of sugar cane on a large scale.\n\n1854 – German immigrant Hermann A. Wireman starts Grove Farms. He leases it to plantation manager Gorge Norton Wilcox, who later buys the plantation. In 1881 Princess Ruth Ke’elikolani sells some adjoining land, which grows the acreage by about a factor of ten. This 1948 Grove Farm acquires the Kolao plantation and in 2000 the company and some 40,000 acres is bought by Steve Case, former AOL CEO and Chairman.\n\n1856 – King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma visits Hanalei.\n\n1857 – The first irrigation ditch built to carry water to sugarcane fields is completed at the Hanama‘ulu Stream by William Harrison Rice, manager of H. A. Peirce & Company (renamed Lihu‘e Plantation Company in 1859).\n\n1860 – Wyllie invites King Kamehameha IV, Queen Emma, and their son, Prince Albert Edward Kauikeaouli Lei O Papa a Kamehameha to visit. In honor of the young prince, Wyllie names his estate, Barony de Princeville (the city of the prince). Sadly, the Crown Prince, who was also the godson of Queen Victoria, dies two years later at the age of four, but the name Princeville sticks.\n\n1861 – Wyllie builds a sugar mill on the east bank of the Hanalei River but the Hanalei Valley.\n\n1862 – Paul Isenberg, a German businessman, is credited for developing the sugar cane business in Kauai while being plantation manager and co-owner of the Lihue Plantation Company.\n\n1864 – George Norton Wilcox uses his engineering training and designs designed an irrigation system to bring water from the wet mountains to the sugarcane fields.\n\n1865 – Upon Willie’s death his nephew inherits the Princeville Plantation, but the following year he commits suicide. Elisha H Allen acquires most of the 10,000 for $40,051.50 in an auction the following year.­­ Several hardships fall on the new owners, including flooding, fire, and even an outbreak of a bovine disease, which forces the owners to destroy all the cattle.\n\n1868 – The first Japanese workers arrive in Hawaii.\n\n1874 – King Kalakaua visits Hanalei Bay.\n\n1881 – The first railroad opens in Kauai.\n\n1892 – The first pier in Hanalei is built from wood and used to unload goods arriving by ship. In 1912 it is lengthened to 340 feet, but the wooden deck proves difficult to maintain in the tropical climate. In 1921 the legislature authorizes $25,000 for a concrete deck and the work is completed by the end of 1922. The shed roof is added in the 1940s.\n\n1892 – Albert S. Wilcox, son of missionaries Abner and Lucy Wilcox who traveled to Hawaii in the mid-1800s to teach English and Christianity to the Hawaiian people, acquires an interest in the Princeville Plantation, and by 1895 holds a controlling interest. During that time the Hanalei Sugar Mill closes and changes from sugar cane to a cattle ranch. Wilcox also rents the lower lands of the ranch to Chinese farmers to plant rice. By the early 1900s, the Hanalei’s coastal plain is covered with rice fields.\n\n1893 – The overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy by American and European settlers leads to the eventual annexation of Hawaii by the United States in 1898. For details please sen our section on the Hawaiian History.\n\nPrinceville History in the early 1900s\n\nIn the early 1900s, nearly every square inch of Hanalei’s coastal plain was covered with rice fields. The first rice farmers were Chinese, followed by the Japanese, Filipinos, Portuguese and other ethnic group. The rice farmers built homes, schools, stores, rice mills, churches or temples, and raised their families in Hanalei. Many descendants of the farmers and plantation workers still reside in Hanalei today.\n\n1912 – A one-lane, 113-foot steel truss bridge to Hanalei opens, replacing the original bridge built in 1895. The Hanalei Bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004 and is still operation today.\n\nHenry Birkmyre, married to Maude Hatfield Birkmyre, the granddaughter of John Richard Kellett, builds a home on Princeville bluff.

It is unveiled in 1989 and becomes the most photographed fountain in Kauai. The statue, also made in Italy, is slated to stand in the foyer of the new Princeville hotel. Local resistance argues that Kauai is the only island King Kamahameha I never conquered, and this results in the statue never being erected in Princeville.\n\nThe statue is warehoused for many years before it is final erected near downtown Hilo, at the north end of the Wailoa River State Recreation Area.\n\n1989 – Qintex’s primary focus is to upgrade the Princeville hotel – which is renamed the Sheraton Mirage Princeville.
