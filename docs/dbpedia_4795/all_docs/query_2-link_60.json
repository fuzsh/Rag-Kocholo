It is accompanied by oli, or chant, and does not use modern instruments such as the ‘ukulele or guitar. Instead, traditional percussion instruments such as rhythm sticks, gourds carved into drums and rattles and bamboo sticks are used. According to The House of Kamakahelei, kahiko was generally performed before 1894.\n\nWhat is hula ‘auana?\n\nThis style of hula is more modern and less formal than hula kahiko. “‘Auana” means to wander or drift, and this style has drifted away from the traditional hula kahiko. It is more interactive with the audience, taking influence from Western culture, and typically accompanied by song and a variety of instruments such as the guitar, steel guitar, bass and ‘ukulele. Hula ‘auana is more commonly used in movies and other Western media than its traditional counterpart.\n\nWhere can you get official Merrie Monarch wear?\n\nOfficial Merrie Monarch wear will be available for purchase during the Merrie Monarch Hawaiian Arts and Crafts Fair. You can also find official merchandise at Prince Kuhio Plaza’s Merrie Monarch Craft Fair and during the festival’s opening Hoʻolauleʻa.\n\nMerchandise can be purchased on the official festival website as well.\n\nOfficial apparel is also available at the festival office at 865 Pi‘ilani St. in Hilo during regular business hours from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Friday.\n\nWhat are the “instruments of hula”?\n\nThere are several musical instruments commonly seen and used on the Merrie Monarch stage, including:\n\nPahu, a traditional tall and narrow Hawaiian drum carved from wood that is used to provide rhythm.\n\nIpu, a percussion instrument made from a single gourd or two large gourds of unequal sizes joined together, called an ipu heke, which is hit with a hand or tapped on the ground to create a beat.\n\n‘Uli ‘uli, which are gourds filled with pebbles, shells or seeds that rattle and are adorned with feathers.\n\n‘Ili ‘ili, which are smooth stones that can be struck together like castanets for a more staccato rhythm.\n\nPu‘ili are dried strips of bamboo that make a distinctive rattling sound when hit. They are used in pairs, with dancers tapping them against each other.\n\nWhy are the movements in hula so important?\n\nNo matter the style, hula shares the stories that connect people, including the dancers, to the foundation of Hawaiian knowledge and culture. It is a vehicle for historical and social commentary and passing down stories and information.\n\n“Every movement, expression and gesture in the hula has a specific meaning, from representing plants, animals and the elements to listening, searching, sailing and so much more,” according to Honolulu tour company Go Tours Hawai‘i, which adds that hand movements are of particular significance.\n\nHand movements are used to represent the words in a song or chant. They can represent an emotion like yearning or signify nature, such as a tree swaying in the wind or an ocean wave.\n\nWhat are common hula adornments?\n\nPāʻū is a dance skirt worn by both men and women hula dancers. Made of kapa, or bark cloth, and elaborately decorated with stamped or painted patterns in ancient times, nowadays most dancers make them from woven cloth and dye, paint or silkscreen patterns onto them. They can be made with ti leaves; ‘ilihau, the processed bark of the hau tree; lauhala, the dried leaves of the hala tree; and even cellophane.\n\nMalo is a men’s loincloth. While malo have become popular again, for modern hula, men also wear trousers, sometimes with a ti leaf, lauhala or ‘ilihau skirt over them. They can choose to wear shirts, but it is not obligatory.\n\nLei, the familiar garland of flowers, leaves, shells, ivory or feathers, are worn by men and woman around the neck or head and sometimes a hat.\n\nKupe‘e are similar to lei but instead decorate wrists or ankles, drawing attention to the delicate movements of hands and feet.\n\nWho was King Kalākaua and why is the Merrie Monarch Festival dedicated to his memory?\n\nKing David La‘amea Kalākaua, known as the “Merrie Monarch” for his flamboyant and fun-loving ways, was born Nov. 16, 1836, and died Jan. 20, 1891. The last king of the Kingdom of Hawai’i, he was elected to the post in 1874 and served until his death. Kalākaua’s sister, Lili‘uokalani, ascended to the throne, becoming the first woman to ever occupy it and the last Hawaiian sovereign to govern the islands.\n\nKalākaua did not support Christian missionary teachings that for decades had suppressed Hawaiian beliefs and traditions. Instead, he sought a renewal of all things Hawaiian, such as arts, medicine and hula. He and his queen, Kapi‘olani, lived by the motto, “Ho‘oūlu Lāhui,” or “Increase the Nation.”\n\nAncient Hawaiians had no written language. They used traditions such as chant and hula to record genealogy, mythology, history and religion, among others. Kalākaua not only relied on these traditional forms of documentation, he supported their practice and the expression of Hawaiian knowledge, ensuring future generations would inherit a robust Hawaiian heritage.\n\nKalākaua famously said: “Hula is the language of the heart and therefore the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people.”\n\nThe Merrie Monarch Festival maintains the teachings of kūpuna, or elders, and strives to perpetuate the history and culture of Hawaiian people in a manner that respects those teachings. The festival continues Kalākaua’s work, making sure the unique traditions of Hawaiian people flourish.\n\nWho was Edith Kanaka‘ole?\n\nBorn Oct. 30, 1913, in Honomū on the windward side of the Big Island, Aunty Edith was a Hawaiian cultural icon, kumu hula, composer and chanter. A key influence in the Hawaiian renaissance of the 1970s, she dedicated her life to educating others about Hawaiian language and culture. She learned hula from her mother, who was instructed by acclaimed dancer Akoni Mika.\n\nKanakaʻole believed oli formed the basis of Hawaiian values and history. She started composing oli in 1946 and choreographed hula to go with many of her chants. In the 1950s, she toured the mainland United States, western Canada and much of Asia with a hula group named after her daughter Nalani. She also founded her own hālau, Hālau O Kekuhi.\n\nShe helped develop the first Hawaiian language program for public school students at Keaukaha School in Hilo, and In the 1970s she created college courses and seminars about subjects including ethnobotany, Polynesian history, genealogy and Hawaiian chant and mythology.\n\nKanaka‘ole died Oct. 3, 1979, but her teachings, beliefs and practices are maintained by the Edith Kanakaʻole Foundation, a nonprofit established in 1990. The Merrie Monarch Festival’s stage is inside a facility that shares her name, the Edith Kanaka‘ole Multi-Purpose Stadium in Hilo, and she also is featured on a new U.S. quarter that recently went into circulation, the seventh coin in the American Women Quarters program.\n\nWhat are some Hawaiian words you might hear during the Merrie Monarch Festival?\n\nHālau hula: A school for learning hula.\n\nHaumāna: Student.\n\nKāholo: Nimble, swift, quick; to move fast, progress rapidly. It also is a common hula step in modern dances.\n\nKāne: Male, man.\n\nKapu: Sacred, holy, consecrated, forbidden.\n\nKuleana: Responsibility.\n\nKumu hula: Hula teachers.\n\nʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi: Hawaiian language.\n\nWāhine: Woman, lady.\n\nAre there other events throughout Hilo during the festival?"
