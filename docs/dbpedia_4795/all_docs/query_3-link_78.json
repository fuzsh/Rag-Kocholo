        "text": "Last names provide a great connection to our family’s past. When it comes to Hawaii, natives initially didn’t have last names. Western colonization required everyone to have one following their first name. As a result, many given names of both Hawaiian and Japanese origin were converted to a family surname. Some Hawaiians have English surnames, Japanese surnames, Chinese surnames, or Korean surnames. Other Hawaiian last names serve as translations of names from western languages.\n\nHawaiian values are rooted in taking each day at a time. They also have a deep respect for a person’s humility. It is considered a valuable trait, and unlike most cultures, it holds more worth than someone’s class or financial status. So when someone flaunts expensive clothes or their connections, it is viewed as pride. Hawaiians are so chill it’s uncommon to use your car horn. Unless you’re honking hello to a buddy on the road, it’s not a usual noise heard in the streets. Apart from being a beautiful travel destination, it’s an island filled with a unique blend of different cultures. It is also a culture that appreciates its legends. Storytellers are important because they help keep those stories alive, chart history, beliefs, and facts, which are passed down to future generations.\n\nSo if you’re interested in Hawaiian culture, say aloha to our list of 25 Hawaiian last names (along with their meanings and origins).
