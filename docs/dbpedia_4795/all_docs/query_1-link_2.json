        "text": "Kauai King, (foaled 1963), American racehorse (Thoroughbred) who in 1966 won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes but lost at the Belmont Stakes, ending his bid for the coveted Triple Crown of American horse racing.\n\nAs a two-year-old, Kauai King won only once in four races and earned a total of $6,120. The following year was quite different. With the approach of the Kentucky Derby, he had a record of seven wins out of nine races, with total earnings of $240,027, and was the most popular bet among the 14 horses competing in the Derby. Kauai King took the lead at the start, was never passed, and won by half a length.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAll About Horse Racing Quiz\n\nTwo weeks later at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, there was a field of only nine horses for the running of the Preakness, It soon became a two-horse race, as Kauai King engaged in a battle with Stupendous down the stretch, with Kauai King prevailing by 13/4 lengths.\n\nConfidence in Kauai King skyrocketed, and he was made the favourite to capture the Belmont Stakes and thus the Triple Crown. Ten horses showed up to challenge him in hopes that he would have an off day, and he did, winding up in fourth place behind the winner, Amberoid. Kauai King died in 1989."
