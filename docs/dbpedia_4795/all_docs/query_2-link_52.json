        "text": "August 17, 1858 – Charles Reed Bishop, who had immigrated from upstate New York a decade earlier, and his partner, William A. Aldrich, opened Bishop & Co. -- the first successful banking partnership under the laws of the independent Kingdom of Hawaii. It operated from a basement room in \"Makee & Anthon's Building\" on Kaahumanu Street. Its successor, First Hawaiian Bank, today is the second oldest bank west of the Rockies.\n\nHonolulu in the 1850s was a raw frontier town. Downtown was a mixture of one- and two-story Western style buildings surrounded by thatched houses.
