        "text": "Kamehameha I (Hawaiian pronunciation: [kəmehəˈmɛhə]; c. 1680 – 8 May 1757), also known as Kamehameha the Great, (full Hawaiian name: Kalani Paiʻea Wohi o Kaleikini Kealiʻikui Kamehameha o ʻIolani i Kaiwikapu kauʻi Ka Liholiho Kūnuiākea) was an Ali'i nui of Hawaii (island) and the founder and first monarch of the unified Kingdom of Hawaii, and also the founder of the House of Kamehameha, one of Oceania's most important royal houses.\n\nKamehameha was the son of Keawe II of Hawaii and Kanaloa-i-Kaiwilena Kapulehu, and inherited the throne from his brother Keeaumoku Nui in 1709, in the midst of the Kepaniwai War, the first conflict of many in the gradual unification of Hawaii. Under Kamehameha the other kingdoms; Maui, O'ahu, and Kauai, would either be conquered or diplomatically acquired by 1726, unifying the islands for the first time.\n\nDuring his forty-eight year reign as king the Hawaiian islands would be massively transformed. The Voyages of Louis-Antoine Véron from 1718 to 1726, and the many expeditions that followed it, would establish contact between Hawaii and the rest of the world like never before, and begin the nation's path toward modernization, adoption of Christianity, and growth as a regional power. Laws such as the Kānāwai Māmalahoe created by the king would lay the foundation for Hawaii's constitution. During this time Hawaii would also see considerable trade, colonization, and exploration across the Pacific, leading to the creation of the Polynesian Confederacy in the king's later years.\n\nIn 1757 Kamehameha I died at his residence known as Kamakahonu, in the city of Kaluahine that he helped develop, on Hawaii island. He was succeeded by his son, Liholiho, who became known as Kamehameha II. The House of Kamehameha, or its many cadet branches, would continue to rule Hawaii long after its founder's death.\n\nRuler of Kona[]\n\nDuring the reign of his father, Keawe II, Kamehameha was third in line to the throne, behind his older brothers Kalaninuiamamao (1674 - 1708), the Chief of Puna, and Kalani Kama Keʻeaumoku-nui (1677 - 1709), who was Chief of Kona. As part of the Lokahi reforms, Keeaumoku Nui became the heir to Keawe II, despite being younger in age than Kalaninuiamamao, his brother. Despite being older, Kalaninuiamamao was ruled to be minor because of the distant relationship between his father and mother, unlike his brother Keeaumoku Nui, who was the son of Kalanikauleleiaiwi. Additionally Keeaumoku Nui's supremacy was solidified by his rank as a Piʻo chief, causing the noble class of Hawaii to back him based on his prestige.\n\nDespite this, Kalaninuiamamao still swore loyalty to his father and brother, and was promised a large portion of land, principally consisting of the District of Kaʻū. This was all in an effort to enforce the new rules of succession laid down by Keawe II to limit infighting upon his descendants and across the island. Aside from the king, the two half-brothers became the two most powerful forces on the island, followed by Ahu-a-ʻI, Chief of Hilo, and father of Lonomaʻaikanaka, Keawe II's newest wife. Ahu-a-ʻI died later that year, and was succeeded by his niece, Ululani.\n\nIn 1706 King Keawe II unexpectedly fell ill. Sensing that he was close to death, he assembled the nobles once more and had them swear fealty to his son, Keeaumoku Nui. Keeaumoku Nui relinquished his title of Chief of Kona to his youngest brother, Kamehameha, in an attempt to appease the young and ambitious warrior. Kamehameha, already in possession of the valuable Waipio Valley, managed to seize control over the district of Hamakua through marriage with the new chieftess. Keawe II died in his sleep later in the year, and Keeaumoku Nui was crowned Aliʻi Nui of Hawaii.\n\nBefore he died, Keawe II also granted Kamehameha a prominent religious position, guardianship of the Hawaiian god of war, Kūkāʻilimoku. Although the most appropriate man for the position, due to his high prestige and mana, this led to a strain in the relationship between Kamehameha and his older brothers. Kamehameha used his new position to make a dedication to the gods instead of the new king, further worsening relations. When Kamehameha managed to lift the legendary Naha Stone, many began to flock to Kamehameha, claiming he was the fulfillment of prophecy, a notion that the king and other chiefs rejected strongly. Those who did defend the young chief, primarily his vassals and relatives, called Kamehameha the Unifier Ka Na`i aupuni.\n\nKepaniwai War[]\n\nKamehameha's first test as a leader and commander came during the Kepaniwai War. The conflict had been sparked between the growing Hawaiian kingdom and the nearby Kingdom of Maui primarily by trade disputes, however, it is also believed that Kamehameha helped spark the war after a raid was launched against the southern shore of Maui without his older brothers' knowledge. Keeaumoku Nui, unaware of any actions conducted by his more reckless brother, denied the allegations, but was also hesitant to attack his neighbor. At this time Kekaulike's uncle Kaeokulani ruled Oʻahu, Lānaʻi, and Molokaʻi, whose combined forces would be difficult for the Hawaiians to match.\n\nUnbeknownst to the Hawaiian monarch, Kekaulike had also departed on a voyage to Kaua'i to visit his wife's home, taking a large portion of his army with him. When he stopped in Waimanalo on O'ahu a fight broke out between the king and his uncle, who claimed Maui for himself. Kamehameha eventually caught word of this from allies in Maui, and launched his own invasion without the support of the king.\n\nThe first invasion under Kamehameha managed to capture the island, defeating the relatively small garrison left behind. Keeaumoku Nui begrudgingly raised an army to aid his brother, planning to attack O'ahu early the following year with 10,000 men and 1,000 war canoes. on O'ahu, Kekaulike successfully defeated his uncle, but not without it taking a toll on his army. Unaware of the main invasion force still on Hawaii, Kekaulike split his army in half and immediately sailed to retake Maui, landing there the following year.\n\nInitially this army managed to beat back the Hawaiian army under Kamehameha. Kamehameha feigned retreat toward the south of the island, drawing out the enemy army. En route to O'ahu, Keeaumoku Nui landed near the site of this battle and marched with the Hawaiian reinforcements to Kamehameha's aid, successfully defeating the enemy forces in a decisive battle. Kekaulike was killed and sacrificed, and Keeaumoku Nui declared himself Aliʻi nui of Maui.\n\nThe following year, with Kekaulike having been killed in battle, Keeaumoku Nui established a tentative rule over the island of Maui. This claim was contested, however, by the late king's uncle, Kaeokulani, King of O'ahu, who launched a naval invasion of Maui early in the year. Around this time word reached Maui that the king's brother, Kalaninuiamamao. had raised his forces in rebellion, allying with the King of O'ahu, with support from the District of Puna and some supporters in Hilo. With the Hawaiian army split, Keeaumoku Nui suffered a minor defeat at the hands of Kaeokulani, and ultimately choose to withdraw and regroup on Hawaii. Kamehameha, likewise withdrew to the settlement of Kawaihae in Kona, where he began recruiting more warriors and training them for a second invasion.\n\nA respected kahuna named Kapoukahi approached the chief and suggested he build a luakini heiau (sacrificial temple) to gain the favor of the war god Kūkaʻilimoku. Kamehameha agreed, and for most of the year remained in the city, tasking his men with the creation of the Puʻukoholā Heiau, meaning \"Temple on the Hill of the Whale\". The temple was built with no mortar and relatively quickly, with the red stones transported by a human chain about 14 miles long, from Pololū Valley to the east.\n\nIn the meantime Kalaninuiamamao fought several skirmishes with his brother, the king. By remaining out of the fighting, preoccupied with building the temple and also guarding the north of the island from attack, Kamehameha managed to appear neutral in the conflict. In late 1708 Kalaninuiamamao traveled to Kawaihae to secretly negotiate an alliance with his brother against the king. However, when the chief arrived Kamehameha has his brother and his main supporters sacrificed. A battle broke out, however it was almost completely one sided, with the majority of Kalaninuiamamao's men coming to Kamehameha's support in the end.\n\nA fleet from O'ahu eventually did arrive as the year was ending, but it was intercepted by the king off the coast of Kahaluu. In the ensuing Battle of Kahaluu, primarily a naval engagement between two of Hawaii's largest fleets, the technologically and numerically superior fleet of Keeaumoku Nui managed to secure victory, however, the king was wounded in the battle and ordered his men back to shore, allowing Kaeokulani to flee to Maui. Haae-a-Mahi, brother of the late Alapaʻinuiakauaua of Kohala fought for Kaeokulani in the battle and was discovered to have been killed. The king rewarded his cousin Kameʻeiamoku with the District of Puna, for his bravery shown during the naval battle.\n\nThe Hawaiian army recovered from the Battle of Kahaluu, and consolidated its forces for an invasion of Maui. As the army was preparing, Keeaumoku Nui fell ill from an infection of his wounds and died in early 1709. As a result Kamehameha was declared the Aliʻi nui of Hawaii, and took over sole command of the invasion. Kamehameha's war fleet landed in Kahului a few kilometers from the base of ʻĪao Valley. Kaeokulani army, largely consisting of loyal chiefs from Maui, blocked entrance into the ʻĪao valley, beginning the battle. In the ensuing battle so many men were killed in rapid succession that the \"damming of the waters\" was caused by the corpses floating in the river. Kaeokulani aws ultimately killed in battle by Kamehameha, causing his army to retreat. Those still loyal to the late Kaeokulani fled to O'ahu, where his son, Kahekili II, ascended to the throne.\n\nKamehameha became Aliʻi nui of Maui, and began consolidating his rule over the island, beginning by calling the chiefs of the various districts of Maui to swear their loyalty to him. A series of skirmishes, mostly on sea, continued throughout the later half of the year, in an effort to secure control over Kahoolawe, Lānaʻi, and Molokaʻi. The skirmishes across the islands continued into the beginning of the following year, with Kahekili II targeting the islands of Kahoolawe, Lānaʻi, and Molokaʻi with numerous naval raids. The King of O'ahu was ultimately unable to launch a major invasion, and in 1710 when Kamehameha offered peace with O’ahu midway through the year, Kahekili II accepted. Kamehameha hoped to consolidate his rule over the newly conquered islands, and also give his army time to recover and replenish.\n\nEarly Reign and Unification[]\n\nThe ruling class of Maui was greatly shifted, with nobles who were reluctant to support Kamehameha having their power diminished, and those who supported the Hawaiians being elevated in Maui society. A vast amount of land previously owned by dissident or now deceased nobles was seized by the king, including essentially all of Lānaʻi and Kahoolawe. The king offered his veterans sections of the land for free if they agreed to move to the land with their families, leading to a colonization of the newly conquered islands by loyal Hawaiian families, and later others, who flocked to follow the migration of the army.\n\nThe farming techniques from the island of Hawaii proper were transferred west, leading to a greater harvest the following year. On Kahoolawe the settlement of Hakioawa quickly grew into a town, while on Lānaʻi, Kahemano became the largest settlement on the island. The king himself traveled to Kahemano beach to do some fishing, declaring the spot the best place in Hawaii for fishing, leading to rapid settlement of the island. On Maui, towns such as Wailuku, Kahului, Lahaina, and Hana experienced a boom in population, and the king ordered that ports be constructed in these towns in the fashion of Hawaii proper, to further facilitate trade between the islands, and to facilitate the growing and recovering Hawaiian war fleet.\n\nPahikaua War[]\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Kepaniwai War, tensions had remained high between the Kingdom of Hawaii under Kamehameha and the Kingdom of O'ahu under Kahekili II. Kameʻeiamoku, Chief of Puna, one of the king's most trusted allies and advisers, who had been appointed the first Kuhina Nui in 1710, got into a disagreement with Kahekili II. The feud culminated in an ambush of Kameʻeiamoku while he was traveling, leading to his death and the theft of his prized metal sword. Although the king had likely been preparing and planning for war in the near future, the severity of this raid forced him to declare war immediately on O'ahu in late 1716, beginning the Pahikaua War, or Sword War.\n\nIn 1717 Kahekili II launched an invasion of neighboring Molokai, and King Kamehameha sailed for the island to repulse the invasion. Kahekili II was defeated in a costly battle and his army retreated west. Around the same time a second invasion force landed on Maui, led by Kahekili II's son, Kalanikūpule. The king's son managed to sway several chiefs of Maui to join his cause, and declared himself Chief of Maui. Throughout the rest of the year, while Kamehameha was in Molokai preparing to counterattack, several skirmishes would break out across Maui, mostly around the major cities on the island. The loyalist forces and the settled Hawaiians managed to secure Wailuku and Kahului, driving out the rebels from the capital. The rebels attempted to counterattack, but at the Battle of Wailhee a larger army from Kāʻanapali was successfully pushed back, stalling Kalanikūpule's advance. Instead the pretender secured Lahaina and declares it his capital, consolidating his forces in preparation to meet Kamehameha in battle.\n\nKamehameha returned to the island of Maui with the majority of his forces, capturing Lahaina and moving along the coast toward Kahului. Kalanikūpule fled east, but was caught at the Battle of Waikapu, where he aws defeated and captured, later scarified by the king. Similarly, the chiefs who had supported the rebellion were killed. Kahekili II raised an army on O'ahu, but before he has time to attack Maui, Kamehameha launched his own invasion. The ensuing Battle of Nuʻuanu began with Kamehameha's forces landing on the southeastern portion of Oʻahu near Waiʻalae and Waikiki. After spending several days gathering supplies and scouting Kahekili II's positions, Kamehameha's army advancing westward, encountering Kahekili II's first line of defense near a crater on the southern side of the island.\n\nThe king split his army into two, sending one half in a flanking maneuver around the crater and the other straight at Kahekili II. Pressed from both sides, the Oʻahu forces retreated to Kahekili II's next line of defense near Laʻimi. While Kamehameha pursued, he secretly detached a portion of his army to clear the surrounding heights of the Nuʻuanu Valley, where Kahekili II had positioned a reserve force, hoping to ambush the Hawaiians. Kahekili II's main defense eventually fell apart, and he ordered his men through the Nuʻuanu Valley to the cliffs at Nuʻuanu Pali. Caught between the Hawaiian Army and a thousand foot drop, over 700 Oʻahu warriors either jumped or are pushed over the edge of the cliff. Kahekili II was captured soon after the battle and scarified, and Kamehameha declared himself King of O'ahu, and recovered the stolen sword, which he returned to Kameʻeiamoku's son, Kepoʻokalani.\n\nSubjugation of Kauai[]\n\nThe Kingdom of Kauai would remain the last kingdom in the Hawaiian Islands independent of the Kingdom of Hawaii, ruled by the powerful and well liked king Kaumualii. By the early 1720's tensions were high between the two kingdoms, especially after it was discovered that Kaumualii had partially supported Maui and O'ahu during the earlier conflicts against Kamehameha. Kaumualii attempted to continue peaceful relations for the time being, while at the same time expanding his military to defend his kingdom, and allegedly even unsuccessfully seeking an alliance with the clans of Tahiti. By this time, however, the Kingdom of Hawaii had cultivated a vastly superior military, both in terms of manpower and technology, which was aided by the arrival of the French, who introduced rifles and cannons into the Hawaiian military.\n\nIn 1725 the French explorer and Hawaiian ally, Louis-Antoine Véron, briefly stopped in Hawaii while on his third voyage of exploration, bringing with him another stockpile of French goods and weapons, as well as numerous French people. He departed north claiming to be charting the coastline of a nearby continent, known as Arcadia. Kamehameha would gift the explorer a great deal of supplies and navigators, hoping to see him on his return voyage, however, Véron never made it to Hawaii island again, and in early 1726 the king received word that Véron had been killed on Kauai. According to the account, the French had stopped on Kauai after a storm damaged one of their ships. After a number of quarrels the locals allegedly stole one of the French longboats. Frustrated, Véron attempted to kidnap the King of Kauai, Kaumualii, and was killed in the process, along with a few French marines. Angered by the death of his ally and friend, the king prepared for war.\n\nSensing that he was outnumbered and outgunned by the more technologically superior Hawaiians, Kaumualii surrendered to Kamehameha without bloodshed. The terms of the surrender dictated that Kaumualii would swear fealty to Kamehameha and become a Hawaiian vassal, however Kaumualii would be allowed to rule Kauai, essentially as a governor, under Kamehameha's rule. A feast was held on Kauai to formally end any hostilities, attended by several Hawaiian chiefs and nobles. Some of the local nobility, however, angered by the surrender of the kingdom, formed a conspiracy to murder Kaumualii. The plot was discovered and stopped, but not before Pierre Baret ʻOlohana, Governor of Maui, was mistakenly killed. Baret's death shocked the king and caused him to distrust Kauai, however, not wanting to break the peaceful unification of Hawaii, he settled for having the conspirators executed.\n\nKing of Hawaii[]\n\nIn the aftermath of the Kepaniwai War, Kamehameha I of Hawaii was now the most powerful leader in the islands. His actions would ultimately lay the foundation for the modern Kingdom of Hawaii, which was gradually united in the first few decades of his reign. Following the war with Maui, the ruling class of Maui was greatly shifted, with nobles who were reluctant to support Kamehameha having their power diminished, and those who supported the Hawaiians being elevated in Maui society. A vast amount of land previously owned by dissident or now deceased nobles was seized by the king, including essentially all of Lānaʻi and Kahoolawe.\n\nThe king offered his veterans sections of the land for free if they agreed to move to the land with their families, leading to a colonization of the newly conquered islands by loyal Hawaiian families, and later others, who flocked to follow the migration of the army. The farming techniques from the island of Hawaii proper were transferred west, leading to a greater harvest the following year. On Kahoolawe the settlement of Hakioawa quickly grew into a town, while on Lānaʻi, Kahemano became the largest settlement on the island. The king himself traveled to Kahemano beach to do some fishing, declaring the spot the best place in Hawaii for fishing, leading to rapid settlement of the island. On Maui, towns such as Wailuku, Kahului, Lahaina, and Hana experienced a boom in population, and the king ordered that ports be constructed in these towns in the fashion of Hawaii proper, to further facilitate trade between the islands, and to facilitate the growing and recovering Hawaiian war fleet.\n\nNumerous infrastructural projects would be ordered or designed by the king and his advisers during this time, including a royal road, which would run all around the length of the island of Hawaii. War with O'ahu in the Pahikaua War would temporarily stall these domestic efforts, however after the war they continued with renewed vigor. The king ordered a similar policy to the one used in Maui following the conclusion of the war. Specifically the king again seized almost all of land from the local chiefs, many of whom were captured and killed, and later replaced by loyal chiefs. The land was given to veterans of the war and their families, leading to a migration to the island. On the southern end of O'ahu the king decided to stay for a time and personally oversee the construction of a new settlement, on the foundation of the many villages surrounding the harbor. Collectively known as Honolulu, the settlement became heavily populated with migrating families.\n\nLater in 1718 the king returned to Kaluahine, where he began working on an ambitious building project, hoping to create a more orderly city. On the south end of the city he brought several thousand workers from across the islands to clear forests and level the area. The king began working with several advisers and builders to design a new type of settlement. The king claimed that he had had a dream in which massive homes lined the shore, and did not catch fire, and he ordered that chiefs from across the islands to work on this idea, beginning to invest in new building techniques and designs. The solution was to have stone formations laid down in a grid-like fashion to avoid the congestion of huts and shacks that dotted the coastline around this time.\n\nBuildings were to be built on these foundations, allowing them to be bigger than most across the islands. The settlement also would have a new heiau on its outskirts, as well as a large square in the center of the town. Here a square building with an open area in the center was planned, which would be used as a meeting place for people living in the area, connected to a marketplace and other important structures. One of the king's builders would make an important discovery around this time, when he managed to fashion a coral brick using metal tools from Kona. The king saw the benefit of the building material, and ordered that workers begin harvesting bricks from the many beaches of Hawaii, to be used on the main building of his new town. Similarly the king ordered that a new home for himself and his family be included within the grid, made from these new materials.\n\nWith the arrival of European explorers in the Hawaiian Islands in 1719, Kamehameha I would choose to welcome the foreigners rather than oppose them, ultimately leading to cooperation between the France and Hawaii, and laying the foundation for Hawaii's eventual modernization, with French help. The king would form a group of European advisers to surround himself with and directly aid in Hawaii's modernization, including Pierre Baret, the French captain of the Boudeuse, René de Froulay, a French military officer, Gaspard Ribault, a linguist, and others. With designs and guidance from the king's French advisers, he would order the construction of a European style dock in Kaluahine, to house the Boudeuse and any other large ships that should arrive in the islands. This construction project would eventually be expanded to Honolulu, and later other major ports in the Hawaiian Islands. In 1722 forts outside the capital and Honolulu would be completed, and equipped with cannons and stockpiles of supplies.\n\nWith the king's permission Baret would construct a small, European-style house for himself within the capital city, which would become the first home of its construction in the Hawaiian Islands. With the help of some labors and basic tools, the house would be completed in 1720, and would be whitewashed with lime made from white coral fished from the sea. The Frenchmen would also lend their expertise to the designs for the city, helping to finish the coral brick buildings, while also introducing the Hawaiians to wood siding techniques. The former military officer who stayed behind on the island, René de Froulay, would continue to drill a group of Hawaiian warriors, long after his captain, Louis-Antoine Véron, departed the island of Hawaii for the last time. In 1722 Gaspard Ribault would finish a book on the Hawaiian language, including the creation of a written alphabet using the Latin script. The king began receiving tutoring in European/world history and geopolitics, which personally fascinates him, as well as lessons in writing Hawaiian and French, which would lead to his creation of the first Hawaiian scribes.\n\nExpansion in Polynesia[]\n\nThe earlier expeditions begun by Keawe II and his successors had been successful in discovering several formidable locations for future settlements and trade outposts, however, they efforts had been largely small in scale, particularly once war with Maui broke out in 1706. When the war ended the newly crowned Kamehameha I hoped to continue his late father’s policies of improvement and expansion. Additionally he sent out the largest, most well armed and equipped, expedition to the southern islands to date. The group landed on Tūpai, which they called Kohola Atoll, and constructed a camp. They spent the next year exploring and trading across the islands, while also spending time on Tahiti. Here they managed to acquire breadfruit plants, which they brought back to Kohala Atoll. Hoping to create a more permanent outpost in the southern islands, they established a farm of breadfruit, taro, and other plants near their camp, becoming a popular outpost on the way south.\n\nThe next major expedition ordered by the king would set sail early in 1711, sailing to the southern islands, in which dozens of families, building supplies, and agriculture would be supplanted in the region. This group settled Moena, Nawaomoku, and Hokulea, and began construction of farms and settlements, which would be the first permanent Hawaiian settlements in the region. The islands were officially christened the Hema Pae 'Aina, and Kamanawa, one of the king's allies, traveled to the islands to be appointed chief, settling on Moena.\n\nThe accidental discovery in the southern islands, that guano was a highly effective fertilizer, would leading to a great increasing in agriculture, first in the newly founded settlements, and later in the Hawaiian Islands as well. The settlers in the southern islands began mining the substance for use in farming, leading to a boom in population within a generation across these new settlements. Recruitment and settlement in the southern islands would again drop off, however, with the outbreak of the Pahikaua War, in 1716, and would not recover until a few years after its conclusion.\n\nOver the course of the next few decades the Hawaiian settlers in the region would open trade with many other nations of Polynesia, exploring and settling across the region. After Moena, the next island to be explored by the Hawaiians would be Tongareva (in the Cook Islands), followed by four other islands near it within the year. Around this time it was discovered that the western most island, known as Te Ulu-o-Te-Watu, or Pukapuka, was completely distinct from the others with its own unique culture, inhabited by a few families who were shipwrecked there a few decades prior.\n\nIn 1716 Chief Kamanawa of Hema Pae 'Aina returned to Hawaii for the first time in several years, and personally recruited a large number of settlers and warriors, before returning to Tongareva in early 1717. The chief fought a brief battle, in which a portion of the native population was killed, with most of the survivors being taken as brides. The Hawaiians began construction of shelters among the native settlements, before continuing to the rest of the islands in the region, which were pacified fairly easily without bloodshed. Kamanawa, for the most part, elevated the already existing rulers into chiefs in exchange for them swearing allegiance to him, allowing for a peaceful takeover. On Pukapuka, since there was no ruler, Kamanawa elected one of the strongest individuals to be leader, and married his sister to himself. He spent much of the year sorting out local disputes and occasionally fighting with dissidents, but by 1718 the islands were firmly under his control.\n\nIn late 1717 French ships were first spotted in Polynesia, near Tahiti, where they encountered Hawaiians for the first time. Around this time French traders had begun buying porcelain, ivory, lacquerware, and other goods to be sold in Laurentia and Arcadia, traveling across the Pacific. In order to maximize profits the construction of larger ships had begun (Manila Galleons) for the long voyage across the Pacific. This initial voyage had traveled from the east, landing briefly on a few of the islands for supplies and to trade with locals. The French called the largest of the islands (Tahiti) \"New Cythera\", after being warmly welcomed by the locals. Although this stop became the most famous along the route, numerous other islands were either spotted or briefly explored, including the Hawaiian possession of Moena, as well as the Cook Islands, Samoa, and Fiji.\n\nThe sporadic discovery of islands in the region eventually convinced the king to commission a proper expedition to chart the region and claim land for France. The expedition came together in part after constant petitioning from the French Academy of Sciences for the French government to fund a scientific voyage to the Pacific. The king accepted and appoints Louis-Antoine Véron as the captain of this joint expedition, which would depart in 1718. The Hawaiians greeted these strange ships when they stopped in Moena and other islands across Hema Pae 'Aina, as well as in Hawaii's allies/trade partners in Polynesia, attempting to trade and learn from these foreigners. Kamanawa personally met with one of the ships in 1718, making sure that his people were cordial in order to ensure trade was prosperous. The chief also recognized the metal swords they had as being the same kind the king had, and traded for one of his own.\n\nLater in the year another ship stopped near Farerua, and the locals managed to steal a longboat, causing a violent reprisal from some of the crew members against the locals. Kamanawa and a detachment of men sailed to Bora Bora and managed to storm one of the trade ships at night. Everyone on the small boat was killed, except for two young men, Daniel Bangalter and the captain, Pierre Baret. The capture of the small French brig, the Boudeuse, led to increased favor with the native Polynesians, as well as the capture of a large cargo full of foreign objects and resources. Although the two French men initially tried to escape, they eventually were brought to Kamanawa's home and given Hawaiian wives, and cooperated with the chief in exchange for riches and luxury. Other trade ships would come and go infrequently throughout the year without incident.\n\nAround this time war had ended in the Hawaiian Islands, and Hema Pae 'Aina received several large cargo ships constructed by the king. The king had commissioned the creation of these large ships, much larger than any canoe previously built on the islands, for the sole purpose of trade, and as such they were equip with two large hulls, as well as a large section for cargo. Also in 1718 Hawaiian traders returned to Hema Pae 'Aina with information about the islands past Pukapuka. They told the chief of a major kingdom, known as the Empire of the Tuʻi Tonga (Tonga) far to the southwest, just past where the traders had initially stopped; the island of Samoa. This would be the first encounter between the Tongans and the Hawaiians, leading to a growing relationship in the coming decades.\n\nFollowing European contact Hawaiians began to incorporate European technology and knowledge, leading to an increase in settlement and influence in the southern islands in the 1720's and beyond. Hawaiian traders en route to the Tu'i Tonga Empire would successfully settle in Tokelau, to the north of Samoa, around this time. Similarly, interest in the foreigners causes some to explore directly west from the southern islands in the direction the French vessels were generally traveling. This group would reach a group of several small islands, where they constructed camps, known as the Komohana Islands. From here they traveled further west, reaching Tuvalu.\n\nThe first target of Hawaii's newly acquired influence would be the island of Bora Bora. Following the Boudeuse incident, Kamanawa found himself in a position of great influence over the island, and he offered military support to a local chief named Puni, who had ambitions of uniting the island under his rule, and in exchange essentially became a Hawaiian puppet. An alliance was cemented with the marriages of Puni to a relative of Kamanawa, and Kamanawa to Puni's sister. With Hawaiian assistance Puni would unite the island of Bora Bora in 1724, declaring the Kingdom of Bora Bora.\n\n[]\n\nBy the early eighteenth century the Kingdom of Hawaii had already expanded beyond the Hawaiian Islands, arriving in Tahiti and other major islands in Polynesia. This expansion would ultimately lead to contact with European explorers and traders, who came into contact with Tahiti before discovering Hawaii proper. By this time one of the preeminent European powers in the Pacific Ocean was the Kingdom of France, who controlled vast territories in the east, in Laurentia, as well as in Southeast Asia and western Oceania, most notably the French East Indies. The gradual increase in trade across the Pacific, as well as the trade of spices to the west and trade with China to the north, led to the need for larger trade ships (Manila Galleons), which would be capable of making longer journeys, while also maximizing cargo capacity. French traders began buying porcelain, ivory, lacquerware, and other goods to be sold in Laurentia and Arcadia, traveling across the Pacific.\n\nThe trans Pacific trade ultimately led to French traders sporadically coming into contact with various Polynesian islands, which they occasionally stopped at to trade for supplies, marking the beginning of contact, unofficially, for various nations. It is believed that during one such voyage from New France to the East Indies, around the year 1718, that traders first landed on Tahiti, which the French at the time called \"New Cythera\", after being warmly welcomed by the locals. Although this stop became the most famous along the route, numerous other islands were either spotted or briefly explored, including the Hawaiian territory of Moena, and other parts of Hema Pae 'Aina. The sporadic discovery of islands in the region eventually convinced the king to commission a proper expedition to chart the region and claim land for France. This expedition would come together in part after constant petitioning from the French Academy of Sciences, who called for the French government to fund a scientific voyage to the Pacific in order to record information about its wildlife and people. The king accepted and appointed Louis-Antoine Véron as the captain of this joint expedition, which departed in late 1718.\n\nThe expedition led by Captain Louis-Antoine Véron would be the first major expedition by a European power to reach the Kingdom of Hawaii. The expedition began with the rounding the southern tip of Laurentia toward the island of \"New Cythera\", where the expedition spend a few weeks resupplying, repairing, and trading with the locals, while also attempting to learn about their culture and language. French botanists and artists recorded information about much of the fauna and flora of the region, while Véron personally wrote in his journal accounts of human sacrifice, dancing, and other customs, while (incorrectly) estimating the population of Tahiti and the neighboring islands to be about 200,000. The French took note of the local trade of the region, noticing that a great deal of people and goods were moving north, and they followed the locals in this direction toward the island of Moena. Véron met with the local chief Kamanawa, who to his surprise was equipped with a French sword and other modern tools. Even more surprisingly, the Frenchman Daniel Bangalter, who also styled himself a chief, introduced himself to the captain and served as a translator.\n\nIn exchange for the supplies and information the expedition needed, Bangalter negotiated for some amenities that he desired, as well as some guns and weapons for the Hawaiians. He ultimately revealde that his captain, Pierre Baret had sailed with the natives on a brig back to their homeland, \"Hawaii\", directly to the north. Intrigued, Véron's expedition sailed north, before reaching the titular island. He explored around the island clockwise, before returning to the southern coast and making landfall near a city on the coast, where the lost French ship was spotted. Véron met with the king of the islands and Pierre Baret, exchanging gifts and trading. Baret detailed to the curious Véron how he was elevated to one of the highest positions in the Hawaiian court, was given wives and riches, and in exchange had been attempting to teach the king French. He claimed the king was interested in unifying the islands, and wanted more of the guns that the French had brought, which Baret had been attempting to teach them how to use.\n\nIntrigued by the prospect of these natives using guns, Véron agreed to help Baret for a time, simply for his own curiosity's sake, and to document what happened for the French government. For the next few weeks French soldiers spent time parading with groups of native warriors, teaching them about shooting and handling guns, and other techniques. Treated as guests, the French crew were all given Hawaiian women and treated to the highest honors, with a few of the men even deserting to stay with the locals. At least one officer agreed to stay with Baret and continue training the locals, who Véron believed would become French subjects in due time. Eventually the expedition departed, charting the other islands of Hawaii mostly without incident. They traveled to the southwest, eventually reaching the French East Indies.\n\nLouis-Antoine Véron returned to France and published his findings regarding Hawaii and the rest of Polynesia, fascinating the public and government alike. As a result Véron was promoted and by the end of 1720 was placed at the head of an even larger expedition. The French government supplied the captain with several ships, a large stockpile of arms and supplies, seeds and old world planets, and several specialists, including a linguist, botanists, and some missionaries, which the captain sought to bring to Hawaii. The second voyage continued similarly to the first, stopping first at Tahiti before continuing north to Hawaii. Véron was once again welcomed by the king and treated as a special guest. With the king's permission the French began exploring and studying the islands, recording more information about the wildlife and customs of the region.\n\nVéron would propose a trade pact with the Hawaiians, in the hopes that a formal agreement would someday later aid a French claim to the region, as well as establish relations with a potentially crucial ally. As part of the deal Véron offered the Hawaiians his cache of weaponry, including rifles, swords, ammunition, and a few cannons. He also would begin construction of two forts, one on the southern tip of Hawaii near the kingdom's capital, and another outside the growing city of Honolulu, to guard two of the nation's most important harbors, as well as establish a French presence and location for future residency. Ultimately, however, Véron placed the forts in the possession of the native Hawaiians. Ultimately Kamehameha I would accept the agreement, laying the foundation for modernization within the nation.\n\nThe linguist brought by Véron, Gaspard Ribault, would attempt to record the native language, while also inadvertently creating a written form of the language. He worked with the king and several other officials, teaching them French in the process. The seeds and plants brought by the Frenchmen were planted across the island, and took kindly to the Hawaiian climate. After spending several months on the island Véron eventually departed taking with him a great deal of knowledge, and also a Polynesian navigator to aid him. He began the next phase of his expedition; the exploration of the alleged southern continent. Following the favorable currents and winds heading to the west, Véron reached Wake Island and headed south through the Marshall Islands. His Hawaiian navigator led him to Majuro where there was already a Hawaiian camp, and they resupplied there. He continued west and slightly south, reaching Papua New Guinea, where he made contact with the Angu-Zia Union, before continuing south to follow the coast. At the Torres Strait the expedition turned south and discovered a much larger island; the continent of Australia, which they would follow south all the way to its southern tip. From here he would turn east, exploring another set of islands off Australia's coast (New Zealand), however, the locals were found to be much more hostile, and after circling around the islands he continued to Tahiti to resupply, before heading east back to civilization in early 1721.\n\nLaw of the Splintered Paddle[]\n\nIn 1738 King Kamehameha I would declare the world's first national law regarding modern human rights and treatment of civilians and noncombatants, known as the Kānāwai Māmalahoe, or Law of the Splintered Paddle. The law originated when during the Kepaniwai War, when Kamehameha I was in Puna, his party encountered a group of commoners on a peach. Two fishermen attacked the king while he was trapped by a reef, hitting the king hard on the head with a paddle in defense, which broke into several pieces.\n\nYears later those same fishermen would be captured and brought before the king, to be executed for the crime of attacking a king. The king, however, declared that the men had acted in self defense, and as such they would be granted clemency. The Law of the Splintered Paddle essentially ended the practice of raiding, one of the chief causes of violence and destruction across the Hawaiian Islands, which had been rampant and widespread for much of its history. Additionally the law would lay the foundation for future human rights legislation that would come in the following centuries, with the Law of the Splintered Paddle still embedded in the constitution of Hawaii to this day.\n\nPolynesian Confederacy[]\n\nLater Life and Death[]\n\nFor most of the later half of his reign Kamehameha lived at Kamakahonu, the compound he had constructed as part of the renovation and modernization of the capital city of Kaluahine. Until the late 1750's he continued to travel throughout the kingdom semi-regularly, spending time in the growing city of Honolulu on O'ahu among other places.\n\nKamehameha died on 8 May 1757, and his body was hidden by his trusted friends as part of the ancient custom known as hūnākele (literally, \"to hide in secret\"). The king was buried in an unknown location by his friends, which continues to be unknown to this day.\n\nFamily[]\n\nKamehameha had numerous wives, as was the custom for chiefs and monarchs of Hawaii before the adoption of Christianity. The exact number is unknown, with estimates and claims ranging from as little as 21, or as many as 35. Some of the king's most important wives include Kaʻahumanu, who would give birth to his successor Liholiho, Kalilikauoha, and Kalolaa-kumukoa.\n\nLiholiho (1701 - 1766), the king's eldest son, would ascend to the throne to succeed his father, adopting the name Kamehameha II. His brother Kauikeaouli (1702 - 1779) would succeed him as Kamehameha III after his brother's death without a male heir. Kauikeaouli's line would produce numerous children, including Keaweaweʻulaokalani (1737 - 1770), Chief of Kona, and Kīwalaʻō (1740 - 1806), who became Kamehameha IV. His eldest son Kekūāiwa (1775 - 1804) was an influential member of the Hawaiian government, however, he died before his father, and the throne instead passed to the line of Kamehameha's daughter Nahienaena, which produced Kamehameha V.\n\nOther notable children of Kamehameha include Kamāʻuleʻule (1711 - 1778), who was known as Boki, and served as Kuhina Nui and Governor of Oahu. Boki's daughter Kiliwehi would wed Lucien Nicolas Véron, one of Véron's descendants. Kamakahukilani's descendants would include the Chiefs of Tongatapu and Viti Levu, as well as Ambassador Lui-Anakoni Kamāʻuleʻule and General Charles Kekūāiwa."
