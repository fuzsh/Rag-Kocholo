Of all my projects, this is the most delicious.\n\nBritish explorer Captain James Cook landed on Kaua‚Äôi in 1778. Kanaka Maoli (Indigenous Hawaiians) killed him on February 14, 1779, for attempting to recover a long boat they had stolen. A young Kanaka male named Kamehameha led the war party. He envied British royalists and wanted to become king himself.\n\nKamehameha didn‚Äôt have gold, silver or oil. He had land ‚Ä¶ Hawai‚Äôi had lots of land, and Kamehameha killed for land, and traded land and political rights to the British for weapons of mass destruction. Partnering with the British, he murdered 10,000s of Kanaka peasants, rival chiefs and opposing warriors. Kamehameha became the British colonial king over the Hawaiian islands in 1810 after 30 years of war.\n\nFor more history on the rise and fall of the kingdom, see: Never Forget Native Hawaiians Want to Kill You.\n\nIn 1843, USA warships kicked the British out of the northern Pacific. The Kingdom of Hawai‚Äôi gained independence, LƒÅ K≈´‚Äôoko‚Äôa, although the USA had recognized their independence since 1826. Didn‚Äôt last long. Local officials and business leaders in Hawai‚Äôi ended the absolute authority of the monarchy in 1887. King KalƒÅkaua was forced to sign a new agreement, referred to as the Bayonet Constitution. Royal power was limited. The legislature now governed.\n\nThe king died in 1891. Sister Lydia ascended to the throne in a contested and divided decision. The king was dead; long live the queen. As Queen Lili‚Äôuokalani, she began working to undo the 1887 agreement. Bad strategic move! She had no army, scarce resources and little political power. Locals booted her in 1893 and charged her with treason.\n\nLocal business leaders and officials created the Republic of Hawai‚Äôi in 1894, and elected former Kingdom of Hawai‚Äôi chief justice Sanford Dole as the first and only president. Due to complaints by Kanaka and political infighting, the USA annexed the islands in 1898. Dole became the first governor of the Territory of Hawai‚Äôi in 1900.\n\nConsidered the last prince of the Kanaka kingdom, Jonah K≈´hi≈ç Kalaniana ªole became Hawaii‚Äôs territorial representative to Congress as a Republican. Serving from March 1903 until his death, The Prince championed legislation to provide homes for Kanaka families and called for Hawai‚Äôi statehood. Homes remain elusive, but 93% voters in Hawai‚Äôi turned the territory into a state in 1959.\n\nFirst state governor was William F. Quinn, a Republican. Current governor is Josh Green, a Democrat. Of the nine governors, only two have been Republicans. Governors, like the monarchs, are weak officials. Power in Hawai‚Äôi lies with industry and wealthy land owners.\n\nOf the more than 4 millions acres of land, the State of Hawai‚Äôi and federal government owns most. Rich people, such as Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle, owns about 95% of the Hawaiian island of Lanai. Oprah, Jeff Bezos and a handful of corporations are large owners on Maui. Kamehameha Schools owns over 300,000 acres on Big Island (Hawai‚Äôi island), along with Parker Ranch, which once held more than 500,000 acres.\n\nAlthough the largest land owners on the small and oldest island, Kaua‚Äôi, behind State of Hawai‚Äôi, are the Robinsons (55k acres) and Grove Farms (31k acres), Mark Zuckerberg is arguable the most influential owner.\n\nMark Zuckerberg is King of Kaua‚Äôi. Long Live the King\n\nOver the past ten years, Zuckerberg has acquired over 1,400 acres of pristine land on the northeast corner of Kaua‚Äôi. Mark claims the property, known as Ko‚Äôolau Ranch, is the family home for him, wife Pricilla, and current three children.\n\nWIRED provided an inside look at the secret compound Zuckerberg is constructing. Facilities include a 5,000-square-foot underground shelter, have its own energy and food supplies, and, when coupled with land purchase prices, will cost in excess of $270 million.\n\nCoconut Wireless is Buzzing with Concerns\n\nAloha Councilmembers,\n\nI‚Äôve recently seen the news about Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs plan to upgrade his property and destroy the very land he owns. When contacting the Planning Department, they were NOT aware of his plans. Would you please investigate and see if he has permits for‚Ä¶\n\nHowever, the Zucks only pay hundreds of thousands of dollars ‚Äî rather than millions ‚Äî in annual property tax Zuckerberg. They aren‚Äôt farmers, but the land is subject to a substantial agricultural tax discount. People are taxed heavily in Hawai‚Äôi, not wealth or land.\n\nKali Yuga Buddha writes, ‚ÄúZuckerberg‚Äôs sprawling Kauai compound boasts a panic room and tunnels linking various structures. Stay tuned as I delve deeper to unearth more secrets. Got a tip or leak? Reach out‚Äù ü§ôüèΩ\n\nZuckerberg‚Äôs massive footprint on this tiny island with a suspicious local population of less than 75,000 has been met with significant resistance. Zuckerberg relied on ‚Äúlegal maneuvering and political networking‚Äù by throwing around millions of dollars of cash, while showing arrogant disregard for local families.\n\nLocal blogger Da Kine posted an artist rendition of the Zuckerberg compound with plans for an escape hatch, ‚Äúblind doors‚Äù and an underground bunker. WIRED claimed one local architect unaffiliated with the project joked that it reminded him of medieval rulers who, according to legend, killed the architects of their most ambitious projects so the secrets of their designs would die with them.\n\nMario Nawfal asks, ‚ÄúWhat is Mark Zuckerberg planning?‚Äù\n\nAccording to the report by WIRED, the partially completed compound consists of more than a dozen buildings with at least 30 bedrooms and 30 bathrooms in total. Two mansions with a total floor area comparable to a professional football field (57,000 square feet) contain multiple elevators, offices, conference rooms and an industrial-sized kitchen.\n\nIn nearby woods, a web of 11 disk-shaped treehouses are planned, which will be connected by intricate rope bridges, allowing visitors to cross from one building to the next while staying among the treetops. A building on the other side of the main mansions will include a full-size gym, pools, sauna, hot tub, cold plunge and tennis court. The property includes other guest houses and operations buildings. WIRED claims the scale of the project suggests that the compound will be more than a personal vacation home, as Zuckerberg hosts corporate events on the property.\n\nPlans show the two central mansions will be joined by a tunnel that branches off into a 5,000-square-foot underground shelter, featuring living space, a mechanical room and an escape hatch that can be accessed via a ladder.\n\nCompound doors are planned to be keypad-operated or soundproofed. Others, like those in the library, are described as ‚Äúblind doors,‚Äù made to imitate the design of the surrounding walls. The door in the underground shelter will be constructed out of metal and filled in with concrete ‚Äî a style common in bunkers and bomb shelters fit for a king, queen and royal family.\n\nAccording to WIRED, the Zuckerberg fortress will be self-sufficient, with its own water tank, 55 feet in diameter, 18 feet tall and pump system. Food is already being produced across the 1,400 acres through ranching and agriculture.\n\nThe over $270 million price tag for a private residence, along with the level of secrecy and security, is unparalleled in the local construction industry. ‚ÄúThe only other time you see that is when you‚Äôre doing secure military installations,‚Äù says one local construction industry official affiliated with the project.\n\nAllan Parachini, local journalist, told WIRED that the focus on managing the flow of information around the compound includes intimidating local press for critical coverage. Throughout 2017, Parachini requested permits to learn what Zuckerberg was building on Kauai. After writing an opinion piece in The Garden Island critical of Zuckerberg and calling for residents to ‚Äútell Zuckerberg that abusing his stewardship of public beaches as if we are just another batch of Facebook victims is unacceptable,‚Äù King Zuckerberg retaliated.\n\n‚ÄúI was amused. I thought it was a silly, petty, juvenile thing to do. I just laughed it off.‚Äù\n\nAllan Parachini, local journalist\n\nParachini claims a Zuckerberg representative told him their team would not communicate with him for any future pieces, and was informed that he, specifically, would no longer be allowed on the property under any circumstances, at the request of the owner.\n\nIn 2016, two years after Zuckerberg purchased his first parcel of land, a 6-foot wall was erected around portions of the property, ensuring privacy within the ranch, but denying other neighbors an ocean view as they walked or biked alongside the land. WIRED reported that recently, as construction began in earnest, the neighborhood has been transformed by cars and trucks circulating in and out. Loud noises, which sound like gunshots, frequently ring out from the construction site.\n\n‚ÄúMark and Priscilla value the time their family spends at Ko‚Äôolau Ranch and in the local community and are committed to preserving the ranch‚Äôs natural beauty. Under their care, less than one percent of the overall land is developed with the vast majority dedicated to farming, ranching, conservation, open spaces, and wildlife preservation.‚Äù\n\nHoffine Barr, the King‚Äôs PR representative\n\nThe project is changing the character in the area, Jeff Lindner, another neighbor told WIRED. ‚ÄúThere used to not be any cars,‚Äù he says. Now, there is a lot of traffic. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not there to enjoy the island,‚Äù he says of the influx of workers, many of whom he believes aren‚Äôt local to Kauai. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre there to get somewhere, and you‚Äôre in their way.‚Äù\n\nNumerous lawsuits have been filed. Not really a problem. ‚ÄúIf anybody has enough money to insulate himself from the damage created for society, it would be Zuck,‚Äù said Douglass Rushoff.\n\nMany locals believe Zuckerberg‚Äôs legal maneuverings are another example of outsiders moving to Hawai‚Äôi and taking advantage of people already living there. WIRED reported that Zuckerberg faced a barrage of negative press around the time of his attempts to acquire land, and a June 2020 petition citing the kuleana lawsuits and calling to ‚Äústop Mark Zuckerberg from colonizing Kauai,‚Äù received more than a million signatures.\n\nBUYING OFF the Local Opposition\n\nWhen one is considered to be the seventh richest man in the world, there aren‚Äôt many barriers. Zuckerberg and Chan simply launched a financial strategy to grease their pathway into the Kaua‚Äôi community. Local charity, Chan Zuckerberg Kaua‚Äôi Community Fund, has given more than $20 million to various Kaua‚Äôi nonprofits since 2018. Money talks! Hundreds of thousands in taxes to support the people. Millions to officials. Bribes work!\n\nWIRED reported that with Zuckerberg‚Äôs status as a major philanthropist come political connections. Zuckerberg and Chan established a cozy relationship with Kaua‚Äôi mayor Derek Kawakami, holding meetings to discuss funding local initiatives during a 2018 flooding crisis and at the height of the COVID19 pandemic. In March 2021, the couple helped relaunched a county jobs program with a $4.2 million donation and gave $3.5 million to local COVID19 assistance projects.\n\nZuckerbergs also hired Arryl Kaneshiro, then sitting chair of the Kaua‚Äôi County Council, as an agricultural consultant. WIRED pointed out he is the son of another former county council member. Nepotism infects government in Hawai‚Äôi.\n\nKaneshiro is a rancher and a popular politician who was reelected to four consecutive terms from 2014 to 2022. Neither Kaneshiro nor Zuckerberg PR rep Hoffine Barr responded to questions regarding pay. Ethics disclosures show that he took home more than $100,000 from his consulting practice in 2021, which was Kaneshiro‚Äôs final term on the council. Local ethics rules do not require that politicians specify how much income they make over $100,000. Corruption rules!\n\nIn November 2021, reported by WIRED, Zuckerberg made a $4 million gift to fund the purchase of a traditional Hawaiian fishpond managed by Malama Huleia, a local nonprofit that focuses on wetland restoration through Native Hawaiian cultural practices. That nonprofit also had ties to local government, then vice chair of the county council Mason Chock. He had recently served as its president.\n\nSpeaking to WIRED, Billy DeCosta, a member of the Kaua‚Äôi County Council, pointed to the fishpond donation and the hiring of Kaneshiro and suggested Zuckerberg had a ‚Äústrategic plan to get all the big dogs on his side.‚Äù Really? Say it ain‚Äôt so, Joe!\n\nWITH THE STRING of donations, Zuckerberg and Chan are the most influential royal family on Kaua‚Äôi ‚Äî they have become the king and queen of Kaua‚Äôi. Who cares about the peasants?\n\n‚ÄúThe people who are born and raised here can‚Äôt afford to live here,‚Äù says Laurel Brier, former vocational counselor told WIRED and who lives a few miles south of the Zuckerberg compound. ‚ÄúAnd we have this whole new economy that is basically serving at the rich peoples‚Äô whims. I don‚Äôt know how stable those kinds of jobs are.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy that a man not from Hawai‚Äôi comes here and purchases a bunch of land that limits the locals [from potentially buying] land,‚Äù says John, former laborer on the Zuckerberg compound. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs already been happening.‚Äù\n\nIn his book Survival of the Richest, media theorist Douglass Rushkoff criticizes what he calls ‚Äúthe mindset‚Äù‚Äî a belief that ‚Äúwith enough money and technology, wealthy men can live as gods and transcend the calamities that befall everyone else.‚Äù\n\nNot sure they are gods; they certainly appear to consider themselves royalty in America.\n\nRemember you heard it here first.
