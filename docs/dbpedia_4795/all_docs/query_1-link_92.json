        "text": "His Majesty King David Kalākaua was named David Laʻamea Kamananakapu Mahinulani Naloiaehuokalani Lumialani Kalākaua and was born on November 16, 1836. His father was the High Chief Kapaʻakea from the powerful Royal House of Keawe of Hawaiʻi (Kalaninuiʻiamamao). His mother was the High Chiefess Keohokālole and is descended from High Chief Keaweaheulu.\n\n​\n\nDavid Kalākaua was officially eligible for the throne declared by H.M. King Kamehameha III and was entered in the Royal Family Boarding School known as the Chiefs' Children's School or Royal School.\n\n​\n\nHe became king by election on February 13, 1874 under the Hawaiian constitutional law when the throne was left vacant after the death of His Majesty King Lunalilo . The other proclaimed candidate from the eligible members to the throne was the Queen Dowager Emma Rooke, granddaughter of Kealiʻimaikaʻi (Kamehameha I's brother).\n\nThe controversial election was thought to be rigged and resulted in an uproar of Queen Emma's supporters, comprised by the majority of the Hawaiian people. The Marines from American & British vessels were called to restore civil order in Honolulu and to keep the peace, Queen Emma acknowledged David Kalākaua as the new king.\n\nIn 1881, Kalākaua went on tour of the world to visit the heads of state of which he was royally received. He was a 33rd degree Masonic member and Knights Templar, who built the grand replacement of ʻIolani Palace."
