We do not permit the removal of 30’ lei hung on the statue as it may result in damage to the statue. In most cases the plant material and lei will have withered because of the direct sunlight. Those wishing to retrieve their property should plan accordingly and dispose at their discretion. Any items that remain at 6 a.m. will be disposed of as described above."
