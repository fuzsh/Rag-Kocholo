        "text": "Beautiful beaches. Lush landscapes. Fresh air. Vibrant sunsets. Towering mountains. Majestic waterfalls. These can be found on every one of the seven inhabited Hawaiian Islands, but each of these islands also has unique features – and even its own nickname.\n\nBy REAL. Updated Jul 02, 2024. | Living in Hawaii | 23 min. read\n\nHow many Hawaiian Islands are there? Total there are 137 islands in the Hawaii chain. Hawaii is typically recognized by its eight main islands, seven of eight which are inhabited: Oahu, Maui, Hawaii, Kauai, Molokai, Lanai, Niihau, and Kahoolawe.\n\nWhen moving to Hawaii, you may be wondering which island to live on. Not only do each of the islands have different geographical features, but they also have different amenities, local governing bodies, histories, cultures, and costs of living. Discover all seven inhabitable Hawaiian Islands before deciding which island fits your lifestyle.\n\nWhy move to Oahu?\n\nHome to nearly one million people, Oahu has many neighborhoods, majestic landscapes, and nearly all the amenities of a city on the Mainland U.S.A. Oahu has the world-famous North Shore with its legendary surfing sports as well as Hanauma Bay, Diamond Head, military installations, and the main campus of the University of Hawaii.\n\nThe number of Single-family home sales on Oahu are the highest of all the islands, and the housing market is incredibly competitive. With thousands of condominiums available, there are lower-cost housing options for those entering the housing market. If you want to experience paradise with the expected amenities, Oahu might be the island for you.\n\nNickname: The Gathering PlacePopulation (2022): 995,638Capital: HonoluluArea: 596 square milesDensity: 1,597 people per square mileHighest Point: Mount Kaala (4,003 feet)Median Sales Price for Single-Family Homes (November 2023): $1,100,055Median Sales Price for Condos (November 2023): $516,179\n\nFun Facts\n\nWaikiki is the tourist mecca of Hawaii with more than 100 hotels.\n\nKualoa Ranch was the site of many Hollywood films, including Jurassic Park, and prime time television shows, like Hawaii 5-0.\n\nThe NFL Pro Bowl was played in Aloha Stadium from 1980 to 2009 and again from 2011 to 2015.\n\nHistory\n\nLike the other islands, Oahu is believed to have been first settled by Tahitians around 300 CE, although the exact dates are unknown. In 1795, Kamehameha I conquered Oahu after the bloody battle of Nuuanu, uniting the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nIn 1845, the royal capital moved from Lahaina, on Maui, to Honolulu, which remains the state capital. Iolani Palace was built, which is still the only palace in the United States. With Captain Cook’s arrival in the Hawaiian Islands and an increase in sugar and pineapple plantations, the monarchy was increasingly dominated by foreign interests. Queen Liliuokalani was overthrown in 1893, and the island chain was annexed in 1898 by the United States.\n\nAnother pivotal historical event that occurred on Oahu was the invasion on Pearl Harbor by Japanese forces during World War II.\n\nThe Weather\n\nIf you define excellent weather as sunny and warm, then Oahu has your ideal weather conditions. Honolulu and Waikiki average around 80 degrees year-round with only 20 to 40 inches of rainfall. Along the Waianae coast, there is less rain, and temperatures can be a little higher. On the windward side or East coast, it tends to rain more; however, one minute it may be raining and the next minute there may be an astounding rainbow.\n\nThe Infrastructure\n\nThe County of Honolulu governs the island of Oahu. While traffic on Oahu is considered one of the worst in the United States, the island boasts a robust infrastructure. The Bus offers service around the island, and the Skyline (Honolulu's Rail System) promises to offer convenient transportation from the West side of the island to “town” or Honolulu. Water, sewage, and trash pick up are offered in every area of Oahu, with only some of the most remote locations having cesspools. Parks are plentiful on Oahu, including dog parks, bike paths, and botanical gardens.\n\nSafety and Security\n\nLike the other islands, Oahu is also considered a safe place in comparison to other cities on the Mainland. According to the Honolulu Police Department's Annual Report in 2022, there was an overall 14.3% decrease in crime compared to 2021. In fact, 2022 marked the lowest reported crime rates in the past five years. Robbery, burglary, and theft saw a decline in 2022, however, there was a slight uptick in traffic fatalities. Overall, residents of Oahu can feel safe walking most streets at night, but they should be vigilant in certain areas and neighborhoods and always take precautions to secure belongings.\n\nWhy move to Maui?\n\nThe second largest and third most-populated island, Maui was once home to sugar cane and pineapple plantations but has now evolved into an ever-developing tourist-attracting island with a lot to do and beautiful beaches and scenery. The housing market on Maui was hot in 2022, but has recently cooled off – with little inventory and single-family homes priced higher than Oahu.\n\nMaui\n\nNickname: The Valley Isle Capital: Wailuku Population (2022): 164,351 Area: 727 square miles Density: 198 people per square mile Highest Point: Haleakala (10,023 feet) Median Sales Price for Single-Family Homes (November 2023): $1,100,000Median Sales Price for Condos (November 2023): $890,000\n\nFun Facts\n\nThe road to Hana is 45 miles long with 59 bridges and more than 600 hairpin turns as well as lush jungles and countless cascading waterfalls.\n\nLahaina was the original capital of Hawaii until it changed to Honolulu in 1850.\n\nHaleakala is the world’s largest dormant volcano, at 10,023 feet above sea level.\n\nHistory\n\nPolynesians from Tahiti and the Marquesas islands first arrived on Maui perhaps around 400 A.D., although there is no definitive date. The Polynesian settlers followed a kupu system, like that on most of the islands, and became farmers and fishermen.\n\nIn the early years, there were three kingdoms on Maui: Lahaina, Hana, and Wailuku. Many wars and conquests occurred over the years, with one of the final battles being Kamehameha the Great conquering Maui in 1795 to unite the islands.\n\nAfter English explorers mapped the Hawaiian Islands, sharing the news of the rich lands of Hawaii with the world, Maui became home to whalers and Christian missionaries. Later sugar plantations consumed life on Maui for nearly a century, with the last Alexander & Baldwin 36,000-acre sugar plantation closing in 2016.\n\nThe Weather\n\nThe weather on Maui varies across the island due to its proximity to coastline, varying elevations, and differing trade winds through the valleys and slopes.\n\nCentral Maui, with the towns of Kahului and Wailuku, tend to have warm, steady temperatures throughout the year with dry breezes; sometimes Central Maui is also muggy with rainfall. The leeward side, which includes Kihei, Wailea, Makena, Lahaina, Kaanapali, and Kapalua, is typically dryer with a higher daytime temperature – up to 92 degrees – and the least amount of rainfall. The windward side with Paia, Haiku, Keanae, Hana, and Kipahulu, has heavier rainfall and northeast trade winds. Upcountry Maui includes Makawao, Pukalani, Kula, and the main mountain, Haleakala. With elevations from 1700 to 4500 feet, the temperatures are milder (70s to low 80s) during the day and chillier at night.\n\nThe Infrastructure\n\nGoverned by Maui County, which also governs the less-populated islands of Lanai and Molokai, Maui’s infrastructure was originally funded by the sugar and pineapple plantations. The federal government helped to build the county’s infrastructure from 1959 to the mid-1970s, and since the state and county has been in control, Maui residents have continued to desire infrastructure improvements.\n\nWhile Maui has wastewater, water, roadways, public transit, parks, solid waste, and police and fire infrastructure, much of it was put in place many years ago. The water infrastructure is in poor to fair condition and many of the roadways need repair. The Maui Bus system is operated by a private company, Roberts Hawaii, and has limited commuter service. Maui in Phase 3 of constructing and expanding the Central Maui Landfill.\n\nIt's also important to note that Maui is in the process of planning how to rebuild Lahaina after its deadly wildfires.\n\nSafety and Security\n\nYou may be wondering, is Maui safe? The island welcomes nearly 3 million visitors each year, and it is generally safe for both tourists and residents. Not surprisingly, the ocean environment poses a risk – especially on Maui which has one of the largest waves in the world, Peahi or Jaws. People on Maui should be aware of rogue waves as well as strong currents. The trails, waterfalls, and vast landscapes of Maui are breathtaking, but also pose a risk, as people have been known to become lost. Violent crimes are not common on Maui, but like the other islands, petty theft does occur at times.\n\nWhy move to the Big Island (island of Hawaii)?\n\nHawaii Island, known most commonly among locals as the Big Island, is the largest geographical island in Hawaii – and in the United States. It is the southeastern-most island and also the newest island with an active volcano that continues to add more land mass to make the Big Island even bigger. Prospective buyers will find that the Big Island has lower home prices with much more land available. However, the varying weather and lack of infrastructure in some areas could be a challenge for the non-adventurous home buyer.\n\nNickname: The Big IslandCapital: HiloPopulation (2022): 206,315Area: 4,028 square milesDensity: 45 people per square mileHighest Point: Mauna Kea (13,796 feet)Median Sales Price for Single-Family Homes (November 2023): $499,000Median Sales Price for Condos (November 2023): $539,000\n\nFun Facts\n\nLake Waiau, just below of the summit of Mauna Kea, is the only alpine lake in the state of Hawaii.\n\nThere is a green sand beach on the Big Island. It is called Papakolea, Mahana Beach.\n\nPele’s hair can be found around the Big Island. Pele, the goddess of fire, spews lava, which in turn makes thin strands of volcanic glass. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is home to this most active volcano in the world, Kilauea.\n\nHistory\n\nStories say legendary Polynesian navigator, Hawaiiloa, first discovered Hawaii Island, and this is where the island’s name originates. Other stories say the island is named after the realm of gods and goddesses, Hawaiki.\n\nNear the end of the eighteenth century, Captain James Cook, an English explorer sailed to Hawaii Island and called them the “Sandwich Islands.” After sharing of his “discovery” of the Hawaiian Islands with compatriots, he was later killed on the Big Island at Kealakekua Bay.\n\nThe Big Island was the home of Kamehameha the Great, who united most of the Hawaiian Islands in 1795 after several years of war. He renamed the island chain after his native island, Hawaii.\n\nThe Weather\n\nThe Big Island has eleven of the world’s thirteen sub-climates, meaning if you want wet, dry, hot, or cold – even snow – you can find it.\n\nKailua-Kona side is hot, as vog (volcanic emissions of sulfur dioxide and other volcanic gases) from the active volcano, Kīlauea, absorbs the sun’s rays. Also, Kīlauea continues to erupt, causing some housing, which often is priced right, to be at risk of lava flows. The leeward side is hot and dry, sometimes with droughts and even wildfires. If you have respiratory problems, it is not recommended to live on the leeward side of the Big Island.\n\nThe highlands and eastern side, where Hilo is located, experience a lot of rain – and mold. This side also has a history of hurricanes and tropical storms.\n\nThe Infrastructure\n\nHawaii County is the governing body of the Big Island. There is an excellent bus system that runs across the entire island and the roads are maintained fairly well. The historic town of Hilo as well as the popular tourist town of Kona have parks, bike paths, and convenient downtown areas with many shops.\n\nTraffic during rush hour is a problem on the 10-mile stretch between Keaau and Pahoa in the Puna District, often worsened with construction delays. Also, except in the main towns of Hilo and Kailua-Kona, the majority of the Big Island relies on private rainwater catchment systems for water, meaning if there is not rain, you may not have running water.\n\nSome other infrastructure cons are there are no rubbish pickup or home mail delivery in certain areas. This means you will have to take trips to the dump and the post office if you live in a rural area.\n\nSafety and Security\n\nThe Big Island is fairly safe, with little room for criminals to hide. Few major violent crimes, like murder or armed robbery, occur. The aloha spirit is present on the Big Island, with neighbors watching out for each other through Neighborhood Watch programs. However, the Big Island does have a drug and petty theft problem. House robberies are fairly common in South Hilo, the Puna District, and the Hamakua Coast as well as auto theft.\n\nWhy move to Kauai?\n\nThe oldest island in the Hawaiian chain, Kauai is known for its lush landscapes, sharp mountains on Na Pali Coast and cascading waterfalls. Quaint, country towns add to the laid-back vide of this less-populated smaller island. Real estate on Kauai is competitive with single-family home prices comparable to Maui or Oahu and not much supply. If you want to live the old Hawaii lifestyle, full of aloha and tranquility, Kauai might be the island for you.\n\nNickname: The Garden IsleCapital: LihuePopulation (2022): 73,810Area: 552 square milesDensity: 121 people per square mileHighest Point: Kawaikini (5,243 feet)Median Sales Price for Single-Family Homes (November 2023): $1,300,000Median Sales Price for Condos (November 2023): $775,000\n\nFun Facts\n\nKauai is the legendary home of the Menehune, or the mythical Hawaiian race of small people who perform construction and engineering.\n\nBy law, no building is allowed to be constructed higher than a palm tree, contributing to the eco-friendliness of the island.\n\nKauai Coffee is the largest coffee plantation in the United States.\n\nHistory\n\nAs the oldest island, Kauai has a unique history. The first settlers of the island are believed to be Marquesans and other Polynesians who arrived around 500 A.D., traversing the vast Pacific Ocean with the stars and trade winds. The early settlers lived off the land, growing taro, yams, and bananas, and enjoying the plentiful fresh water.\n\nWith the arrival of Westerns in the late 1700s, Kauai became a common stop for sea voyagers and missionaries. Kamehameha the Great had difficulty conquering Kauai, and its neighboring island, Niihau, due to rebellion and disease outbreaks. But in 1810, Kamehameha and the King of Kauai, Kaumualii, came to a peaceful agreement, with Kauai joining the Hawaiian Kingdom with Kaumualii as its governor.\n\nSugar plantations were plentiful on Kauai starting in the late 1800s due to Kauai’s rich, flat lands. In the early 1900s, pineapple found its way to Kapa‘a, along with people from all over the world – Japan, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Spain, Germany, China, and the Philippines – coming to work on the plantations. Sugar and pineapple dominated the island for nearly 100 years.\n\nThe Weather\n\nKauai’s climate is generally humid and stable year-round, with temperatures averaging 78 degrees in Lihue in February and 85 degrees in August. In Kauai’s mountain ranges, like the Kokee State Park, which has Hawaii’s “Grand Canyon,” temperatures are chilly – with a record low of 29 degrees. Kauai tends to get more rain and has had historical flooding and hurricanes which have wreaked havoc on homes and hotels. Annual rain fall varies from about 50 inches annually on the windward shore to less than 20 inches on the leeward side of the island.\n\nThe Infrastructure\n\nKauai County governs the island of Kauai as well as “The Forbidden Isle” off its shore, Niihau. Infrastructure has remained the same on Kauai for the past decades, despite an increase in tourism. Two-way roads, one-way bridges, small parking lots, and a small public transportation system – the Kauai Bus – make getting around Kauai a challenge. But Kauai is a small island, so there is not far to travel.\n\nThe island’s drainage system leaves much to be desired, as there is no Drainage Master Plan for Kauai, which has resulted in some flooding and the lost of homes in the past decade. The water systems were initially constructed by sugar plantations and later expanded by the County. Wastewater systems are available in Waimea, Hanapepe, Lihue, Wailua, and Kapaa, but public wastewater systems are not available in many areas like Princeville, Kekaha, or Kokee. In fact, there are private systems operating in Puhi, Princeville, and Poipu.\n\nSafety and Security\n\nWith its small population and geographic area, Kauai is one of the safest islands. Minimal crime exists on Kauai besides petty theft. However, the surf and one-way bridges create a hazard, so always be vigilant when swimming or driving on Kauais narrow roads. Remote waterfalls and hiking trails should not be accessed if you are not prepared or know the area, as explorers have been lost in the lush landscapes of Kauai in the past.\n\nWhy move to Lanai?\n\nComing in as the sixth largest inhabited Hawaiian Island in geographical size, Lanai is 18 miles at its longest width. Only 2% of the island is owned by the state of Hawaii or privately residents, while the other 98 percent is owned by the founder and chairman of the Oracle Corporation, Larry Ellison. Lana‘i is the island to live on if you are looking for a smaller community with plenty of dirt roads, picturesque beaches, and old Hawaii pineapple plantation charm. However, you will have to have some luck in being able to purchase one of the few homes for sale on Lanai!\n\nLanai\n\nNickname: The Pineapple IsleLargest Settlement: Lanai CityPopulation (2020): 3,367Area: 140 square milesDensity: 23 people per square mileHighest Point: Lana‘ihale (3,366 feet)Median Sales Price for Single-Family Homes: $736,569 (August 2023)\n\nFun Facts\n\nThere are no traffic lights on the Lanai. There is one K-12 public school and one hospital servicing the entire island.\n\nAcross all of the Hawaiian Islands, Lanai was King Kamehameha’s favorite fishing spot.\n\nLanai is known as the “Pineapple Island” because it once was home to a plantation that produced 75 percent of the world’s pineapples!\n\nHistory\n\nAccording to local Hawaiian legend, Lanai was once ruled by the god of nightmares for thousands of years. The god of nightmares’ rule ended when a teenage chief from Maui killed the nightmare god. He then lit a fire to signal that people from Maui could finally come to the island to inhabit it.\n\nWhen Native Hawaiians inhabited Lanai, they established fish ponds and taro farms, and the people of Lanai enjoyed relatively calm years until King Kamehameha I took control, slaughtering many of Lanai’s former residents.\n\nIn the early 1800s, a farmer from China, Wong Tse Chun, used some of Lanai’s lands for sugar-growing. In the mid-1800s, a group of members from the Church of Jesus Chris of Latter-day Saints were granted a lease in the ahupua‘a of Palawai on Lanai. In 1963, Walter M. Gibson bought this land for $3000 and put it in his name, using it for ranching and then later for sugarcane farming, which brought hundreds of people from Japan to Lanai.\n\nIn 1922, James Dole bought the island and developed it as the world’s largest pineapple plantation, bringing workers from around the word.\n\nIn 1959, when Hawaii became a state, Lanai became a part of the County of Maui. With the changing international economy and outsourcing leading to cheaper ways to produce pineapple, the Dole Food Company’s plantation dwindled, with plantation operations closing by 1992.\n\nIn June 2012, Larry Ellison purchased Castle & Cooke’s 98 percent share of Lanai for $300 million. He remodeled a former hotel to create the luxurious Four Seasons Resort Lanai at Manele Bay, which opened in April 2016. He has also built a new water filtration system and reopened a public pool in Lanai City, in addition to refurbishing and reopening the historic plantation movie theater. Ellison has started hydroponic farming on Lanai and has more plans to create a sustainable Lanai community.\n\nThe Weather\n\nLanai has generally pleasant and dry weather year-round. The island only receives about 37 inches of rainfall per year, and temperatures range from 70 to 85 degrees, with higher elevated places, like Lanai City, averaging around 72 degrees in the warmer months. Coastal places, like Manele Bay, are usually about 10 degrees higher, so you can drop the jacket and enjoy the beaches more comfortably.\n\nThe Infrastructure\n\nWith no traffic lights, one public school that goes from grades kindergarten to grade 12, and one hospital. The island is much smaller geographically and population-wise when comparing to the other Hawaiian Islands.\n\nTo move to Lanai, there is an airport and a ferry from Maui. As for traveling on the island, you will need a four-by-four vehicle to get to most places. The is no public transportation system, but some hotels offer car or van services.\n\nWhile Lanai does not have much development at the moment, Larry Ellison proposed a plan to diversify the economy and add more jobs and residents in September 2019. Plans include the approved Miki Basin Industrial Park, a 200-acre industrial park near the Lanai Airport as well as adding 546 acres to triple the size of Lanai City – with visions for a university, more housing, film studios, and a tennis academy.\n\nSafety and Security\n\nLanai is an extremely safe place to live. With only 3,000+ residents and mostly luxury tourism, it is difficult for crime to exist on Lanai. Lanai does have a police station, which is a part of the Maui County Police Department.\n\nWhy move to Molokai?\n\nAmong the Hawaiian Islands, Molokai is known as the Friendly Isle, and those who live there would consider it the best island to live on by far. With many longtime families and few visitors living on remote Molokai, it is one of the most secluded Hawaiian Islands. Long flat fields to jaw dropping sea cliffs on the “back side” to winding roads and small shops make Molokai a beautiful place to call home. Most residents live off of the land, growing produce in the rich soils, fishing, and hunting for deer. You can check out homes for sale on Molokai here.\n\nMolokai\n\nNickname: The Friendly IsleLargest Settlement: KaunakakaiPopulation (2014): 7,345Area: 260 square milesDensity: 28 people per square mileHighest Point: Kamakou (4,961 feet)Median Sales Price for Single-Family Homes (August 2023): $499,000\n\nFun Facts\n\nKaunakakai Pier in Kaunakakai Town is the longest pier in Hawaii. Drive to the end to view the reef and fish.\n\nMolokai has 4,000-foot sea cliffs – that are the tallest in the world with secret coves and waterfalls.\n\nThere are no traffic lights on Molokai.\n\nHistory\n\nIt is said that Polynesian settlers from Marquesas, Tahiti, and other Pacific islands inhabited Molokai around 650 AD, which new migrations taking place in 700 AD. The neighboring islands of Maui and Oahu did not interact much with the residents of Molokai in these early years, causing decades of peace.\n\nIn the 18th century, internal conflicts over fertile fishing groups occurred, causing chiefs from Oahu to take control of Molokai. When the king of Maui conquered Oahu, Maui also came under rule of the Maui. Shortly thereafter, King Kamehameha the Great united the Hawaiian Islands, including Molokai. King Kamehameha V had a vacation home on Kaunakakai beach and a country estate with cattle, coconut groves, and deer breeding grounds.\n\nThe first Europeans to step onto Molokai in 1786 were led by Captain George Dixon. Christian missionaries visited Molokai in the 1800s, with the first permanent missionary established in Kalua‘aha in 1832. Kalaupapa was a famous small town isolated by tall cliffs on Molokai for people suffering from Hansen’s disease or leprosy. In 1873, Father Damien deVeuster arrived at Kalaupapa, leaving a lasting legacy of caring for leprosy victims in Kalaupapa.\n\nMolokai had the Meyer Sugar Mill for almost 30 years, run by Rudolph Meye from Germany who also produced wheat, potatoes, coffee, and corn for export and partnered with King Kamehameha V to supervise Molokai ranch lands and the Kalaupapa Leper Settlement.\n\nThe Weather\n\nMolokai has desirable weather year-round. Temperature average about 75 degrees and rarely go above 85. During the winter season, which is usually December to March, evening temperatures drop to the 60s and there are often a few rainy days. Spring, summer, and fall have warm days with cool trade winds in the evenings. Without the trade winds, the heat and humidity can intense.\n\nThe Infrastructure\n\nMolokai has a small Molokai General Hospital which operates 24/7 as well as a Community Health Center and Family Health Center. Molokai has four public elementary schools as well as a public middle and high school. There is a charter school and one private school on the island.\n\nGoverned by the County of Maui, Molokai has county and state parks and protected areas, including Palaau State Park, Molokai Forest Reserve, Halawa Beach Park, and the Kalaupapa National Historical Park with restricted access.\n\nThe island has one two-lane highway going from east to west and a small bus system. There is also a small outdoor airport with mainly 8-seater planes arriving daily from the neighboring Hawaiian Islands.\n\nSafety and Security\n\nMolokai is small, and everyone knows everyone. If you are visiting Molokai, people will notice. While the unemployment rate historically has been high on Molokai with most people living off the land or working part-time jobs, there is relatively low crime or theft. People who live on Molokai or visit Molokai can sleep soundly at night knowing their neighbors are friendly and crime is low.\n\nWhy move to Niihau?\n\nNiihau is the island that you need an invitation from the Robinson family in order to visit, hence the nickname, “The Forbidden Isle.” Since Niihau is known to have stunning, unspoiled beaches and abundant wildlife, it may be enticing to try to buy real estate there. However, there is no real estate to buy on Niihau, and it is nearly impossible to even visit Niihau.\n\nNiihau\n\nNickname: The Forbidden IsleLargest Settlement: Pu‘uwaiPopulation (2010): 170Area: 69.5 sqaure milesDensity: 1.9 people per square mileHighest Point: Mount Pani‘au at 1250 feetMedian Sales Price for Single-Family Homes: No homes are for sale.\n\nFun Facts\n\nResidents of Niihau speak the Hawaiian language almost exclusively.\n\nNo one knows exactly how many people live on Niihau, as the Robinson family does not have to report population numbers.\n\nFormer Niihau residents say there are a lot of rules, including no alcohol or guns, men not having long hair or earrings, and everyone attending church on Sundays. Breaking the rules might mean an eviction from the island by the Robinson family.\n\nHistory\n\nNiihau was once ruled by Hawaiian ali‘i or chiefs, with a variety of battles and marriages marking its history and establishing its many rulers. Despite many attempts, Kamehameha was never fully successful in conquering Niihau by force. In 1810, Kamehameha gathered many fighters, and rather than fighting, the Niihau ruler, Kaumauli‘i, surrendered. And after Kamehameha died, his widow, Ka‘ahumanu, married Kaumauli‘i, further solidifying Niihau’s presence in the unified Kingdom of Hawaii.\n\nIn 1864, Elizabeth McHutchison Sinclair purchased Niihau from King Kamehameha V for $10,000 in gold. The king made the family promise that they protect the island and its residents from outside influences – and many generations later, descendants of the Sinclair family have upheld that promise to today. Brothers Bruce and Keith Robinson currently manage Niihau.\n\nThe Weather\n\nNiihau is drier than other islands with less trade wind rainfall due to its low elevation and location next to rainy Kauai. Historical droughts on Niihau have been recorded several times. Temperatures average 70 to 80 degrees year-round.\n\nThe Infrastructure\n\nIn general, Niihau has no roads, cars, stores, restaurants, Internet, electricity, or indoor plumbing. Permanent residents use traditional Hawaiian hunting and fishing methods, as were done for hundreds of years and have been passed down by their ancestors.\n\nFor employment, residents collect rare small, red shells and make them into expensive leis, and other people are employed by the Robinson ranch, where they earn salaries and free housing.\n\nSafety and Security\n\nSince access to Niihau is limited to invitation only, and everyone that lives there is basically family, there is no documented crime.\n\nSo what's the best Hawaiian Island to live on?\n\nEach of the Hawaiian Islands is unique – offering a range of weather, amenities, and differing culture. If you want lush landscapes and a laid-back old Hawaii lifestyle, Kauai may be right for you. If amenities, urban life, and spectacular surf are your preferences, you may like Oahu. If you like rural living but also might enjoy some amenities and tourists along with beautiful landscapes, Maui may be your place. And if you want wide-open spaces and have an adventurous spirit, you may prefer the Big Island.\n\nIf you want a friendly, rural place and to try sustainable living, Molokai might be your island. However, if you want to experience the old pineapple plantation vibe and hope for more sustainable living initiatives from Larry Ellison, you might enjoy living on Lanai. If you want to immerse in Hawaiian culture and escape the outside world, Niihau might be right for you – but by invitation only.\n\nWhichever island you choose to live on, the beauty of Hawaii and aloha spirit will dwell.\n\nYou may also like\n\nOahu\n\nOahu is Hawaii's most populated island a.k.a. \"The Gathering Place.\"\n\nWho owns Hawaii?\n\nGet the skinny on Hawaii's top ten landowners.\n\nBuying Land in Hawaii\n\nLearn the ins and outs of buying land in Hawaii.\n\nHonolulu Skyline Rail: What is the Status?\n\nGet a summary of the latest on Honolulu's Skyline Rail Project.\n\nAirbnb on Hawaii: What is and isn’t legal?\n\nCan I invest and rent an Airbnb home in Hawaii?\n\nCost of Living in Hawaii 2023\n\nParadise comes at a cost.
