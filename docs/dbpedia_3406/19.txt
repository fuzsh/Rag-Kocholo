Tokheim has announced it has entered into an agreement with Dover Corporation for the acquisition of the former's dispenser and system businesses for 425 million euros ($465 million), according to Reuters.

A global manufacturer and provider of fuel retailing solutions, Tokheim will maintain the sales and service divisions departments under their ownership. The transaction for the other assets is still subject to regulatory filing and customary conditions.

Tokheim´s dispenser and system business will be part of OPW, a Dover business unit, making it the premier global retail fueling systems provider.

“We are excited about the strategic fit of Tokheim’s Dispenser and System businesses within Dover’s OPW business, as well as how a strong partnership with the merged entity will enhance the growth of our remaining Sales and Service businesses” said Baudouin de la Tour, CEO of Tokheim. “We strongly believe both our customers and employees will greatly benefit from this unique ability to provide full solutions on a global scale”.

Dover is a diversified global manufacturer delivering innovative equipment and components, specialty systems and support services through four major operating segments: Energy, Engineered Systems, Fluids, and Refrigeration & Food Equipment.

“After years of sustained organic growth and geographical expansion, we found in Dover a great company to successfully pursue the global strategy of the Dispenser and System businesses” added Patrick Eisenchteter, Managing Partner of Motion Equity Partner.

Headquartered in Paris, France, Tokheim is a global manufacturer of fuel dispensing and automation equipment with a presence in over 40,000 stations worldwide, according to the company.
