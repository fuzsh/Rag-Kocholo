In January 2016, the Tokheim Group, one of the worldâ€™s largest providers of fuel retailing solutions, has sold its Dispensers Business Unit (DBU) and Systems and Electronics Business Unit (SEBU) to the Dover Group. The remaining part of the group, Tokheim Group Services, became a leading service provider and equipment supplier for service stations.

In September 2016, Tokheim Group Services has been acquired by the board of directors and is now focused on service activities and equipment sales, with an exclusive distributor agreement to sell Tokheim dispensers and systems with Dover.

Tokheim Group Services directly owns 28 Sales and Service Divisions across Europe and Africa.
