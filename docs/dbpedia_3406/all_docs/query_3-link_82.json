        "text": "By Pranab Adhikari, Data Analyst Intern\n\nToday we are proud to spotlight an outstanding partner and friend to Fleet at the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) since 2017. In the world of automotive education, Miles Tokheim stands out as a dedicated educator with a passion for hands-on learning. From his high school days at LaFollette High School to his current role shaping young mechanics of the future as a teacher at Memorial High School, Miles has a wealth of experience and insights into the evolving landscape of automotive education.\n\nMiles’ journey into the auto industry traces back to attending LaFollette High School, where he immersed himself in the world of consumer auto during his junior year and dedicated half of his senior year to experiences at the auto shop. Following his high school pursuits, Miles furthered his education at Madison College from 1996 to 1998 while simultaneously working at local dealership Kayser Ford, gaining valuable practical insights into the automotive industry. Inspired by his former LaFollette automotive teacher, Bill Ecker, Miles continued his educational journey, obtaining a bachelor's degree in teaching from University of Wisconsin Stout and a master's degree in education leadership and policy analysis from University of Wisconsin Madison. Demonstrating his unwavering commitment to education, Miles served as a technology and engineering teacher at LaFollette High School for a decade and later took on the role of Director of Career and Technical Education for MMSD. Currently, with over eight years of dedicated service, he imparts his knowledge and passion to students at Vel Phillips Memorial High School.\n\nMiles’ teaching approach centers around hands-on activities. He believes in bridging the gap between theory and practice, engaging students with real work on operational vehicles. His classes not only teach the theory behind automotive technology but also involve students in practical tasks such as work order creation and vehicle repairs that have real-world applications.\n\nMiles is proud of the positive impact his work has on the community. The youth apprenticeship at Fleet, in particular, showcases real-life results and fosters strong business relations. Many of Miles's former students have found success in the automotive industry, including a number of them here at Fleet.\n\nTo further support automotive education initiatives, Miles encourages community involvement. Supporters can contribute by joining the business advisory team. Currently, Memorial High School is the sole institution in the Madison school district with a full automotive program, but Miles believes that collaborative efforts will expand these opportunities for aspiring young enthusiasts at all of the major MMSD high schools in Madison. Fleet is working closely with MMSD to foster this expansion.\n\nFor those looking to pursue a career in the automotive industry, Miles offers valuable advice for those looking to pursue a career in the automotive industry: become a lifelong learner. With the industry constantly evolving, staying on top of new trends is crucial for success. He highlights the shift from mechanical to electronic technologies, the expansion of electric vehicles (EVs), and the importance of adaptability in this changing landscape.\n\nMiles emphasizes the cleaner and safer nature of the work today, dispelling stereotypes about the industry. We agree with him that there are excellent, stable, and high-paying careers to be had for those interested at any age, and from any background. Miles in particular has encouraged young women to study and work in the field.\n\nMiles stresses the importance of supporting local school programs. Hands-on experience, he believes, is invaluable, and community engagement is crucial for the success of automotive education initiatives. As the industry evolves, educators like Miles Tokheim play a pivotal role in shaping the future of aspiring automotive enthusiasts. Advocating for the value of practical education, Miles sends a clear message: supporting local school programs is not just an investment in education but a contribution to the future of the automotive industry. To discover how you can contribute and support Miles Tokheim's endeavors in automotive education, feel free to give him a call at (608) 442-2245.
