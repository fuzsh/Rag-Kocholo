        "text": "VR-10 Computer configured for a Tokheim Full Automatic Reset (single lever, mechanical spring-loaded reset). This is not for use with dispensers utilizing an electric reset.\n\nThis type of computer was used in some Tokheim pumps prior to July, 1976. Prior to ordering a VR-10 with this type of reset, please positively identify the type of reset mechanism on the side of the computer to ensure that you do not want the much more common PMP #18010-5. The 18010-5 is a PMP remanufactured VR-10 for use with a Tokheim Electric Reset.\n\nThe VR-10 computer can be set to a maximum price of $9.99 per gallon. The computer is capable of registering a maximum total sale of $999.98.\n\nEach revolution of the right hand money wheel is equal to $1.00.\n\nFor price settings of less than or equal to $5.999 per gallon, the price can be set in 1/10th cent increments.\n\nFor price settings greater than $5.999 per gallon the price can be set on in even cent increments."
