Introduction and Background The GLBA amended several federal statutes governing the activities and supervision of banks, bank holding companies, and their affiliates.\\1\\ Among other things, it lowered barriers between the banking and securities industries erected by the Banking Act of 1933 (``Glass-Steagall Act'').\\2\\ It also altered the way in which the supervisory responsibilities over the banking, securities, and insurance industries are allocated among financial regulators. Among other things, the GLBA repealed most of the separation of investment and commercial banking imposed by the Glass-Steagall Act. The GLBA also revised the provisions of the Exchange Act that had completely excluded banks from broker-dealer registration requirements. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Pub. L. 106-102, 113 Stat. 1338 (1999). \\2\\ Pub. L. 73-66, ch. 89, 48 Stat. 162 (1933) (as codified in various Sections of 12 U.S.C.). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In enacting the GLBA, Congress adopted functional regulation for bank securities activities, with certain exceptions from Commission oversight for specified securities activities. With respect to the definition of ``broker,'' the Exchange Act, as amended by the GLBA, provides eleven specific exceptions for banks.\\3\\ Each of these exceptions permits a bank to act as an agent with respect to specified securities products or in transactions that meet specific statutory conditions. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In particular, Section 3(a)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act provides conditional exceptions from the definition of broker for banks that engage in certain securities activities in connection with third-party brokerage arrangements; \\4\\ trust and fiduciary activities; \\5\\ permissible securities transactions; \\6\\ certain stock purchase plans; \\7\\ sweep accounts; \\8\\ affiliate transactions; \\9\\ private securities offerings; \\10\\ safekeeping and custody activities; \\11\\ identified banking products; \\12\\ municipal securities; \\13\\ and a de minimis number of other securities transactions.\\14\\ On October 13, 2006, President Bush signed into law the ``Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 (``Regulatory Relief Act'').'' \\15\\ Among other things, the Regulatory Relief Act requires that the SEC and the Board jointly adopt a single set of rules to implement the bank broker exceptions in Section 3(a)(4) of the Exchange Act.\\16\\ It also requires that not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of the Regulatory Relief Act, the SEC and the Board jointly issue a single set of proposed rules to implement these exceptions. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4)(B)(i). This exception permits banks to enter into third-party brokerage, or ``networking'' arrangements with brokers under specific conditions. \\5\\ Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4)(B)(ii). This exception permits banks to effect transactions as trustees or fiduciaries for securities customers under specific conditions. \\6\\ Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4)(B)(iii). This exception permits banks to buy and sell commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, commercial bills, exempted securities, certain Canadian government obligations, and Brady bonds. \\7\\ Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4)(B)(iv). This exception permits banks, as part of their transfer agency activities, to effect transactions for certain issuer plans. \\8\\ Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4)(B)(v). This exception permits banks to sweep funds into no-load money market funds. \\9\\ Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4)(B)(vi). This exception permits banks to effect transactions for affiliates, other than broker- dealers. \\10\\ Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4)(B)(vii). This exception permits certain banks to effect transactions in certain privately placed securities, under certain conditions. \\11\\ Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4)(B)(viii). This exception permits banks to engage in certain enumerated safekeeping or custody activities, including stock lending as custodian. \\12\\ Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4)(B)(ix). This exception permits banks to buy and sell certain ``identified banking products,'' as defined in Section 206 of the GLBA. \\13\\ Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4)(B)(x). This exception permits banks to effect transactions in municipal securities. \\14\\ Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4)(B)(xi). This exception permits banks to effect up to 500 transactions in securities in any calendar year in addition to transactions referred to in the other exceptions. \\15\\ Pub. L. 109-351, 120 Stat. 1966 (2006). \\16\\ See Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4)(F), as added by Section 101 of the Regulatory Relief Act. The Regulatory Relief Act also requires that the Board and SEC consult with, and seek the concurrence of, the OCC, FDIC and OTS prior to jointly adopting final rules. As noted above, the Board and the SEC also have consulted extensively with the OCC, FDIC and OTS in developing these joint proposed rules. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Section 401 of the Regulatory Relief Act also amended the definition of ``bank'' in Section 3(a)(6) of the Exchange Act to include any Federal savings association or other savings association the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC. Accordingly, as used in this proposal, the term ``bank'' includes any savings association that qualifies as a ``bank'' under Section 3(a)(6) of the Exchange Act, as amended. In accordance with these statutory provisions, the SEC and Board are jointly requesting comment on proposed rules to implement the broker exceptions for banks relating to third-party networking arrangements, trust and fiduciary activities, sweep activities, and safekeeping and custody activities.\\17\\ The proposed rules include certain exemptions related to these activities, as well as exemptions related to foreign securities transactions, securities lending transactions conducted in an agency capacity, the execution of transactions involving mutual fund shares, the potential liability of banks under Section 29 of the Exchange Act, and the date on which the GLB Act's ``broker'' exceptions for banks will go into effect.\\18\\ The proposed rules are designed to accommodate the business practices of banks and protect investors. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\17\\ See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)(B)(i), (ii), (v) and (viii). \\18\\ Employees of a bank that operates in accordance with the exceptions in Section 3(a)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act and, where applicable, the proposed rules also shall not be required to register as a ``broker'' to the extent that the employees'' activities are covered by the relevant exception or rule. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Any additions or changes to these rules that may be appropriate to implement Section 3(a)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act will be adopted jointly by the SEC and Board in accordance with the consultation provisions in Section 101(b) of the Regulatory Relief Act. Identical sets of the final rules will be published by the SEC in Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations and by the Board in Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations. In developing this proposal, the Agencies considered, among other things, the language and legislative history of the ``broker'' exceptions for banks adopted in the GLBA, the rules previously issued or proposed by the Commission relating to these exceptions and the comments received in connection with those prior rulemakings. The Agencies request comment on all aspects of these proposals as well as on the specific provisions and issues identified below. [[Page 77524]] In addition, the Agencies request comment on whether it would be useful or appropriate for the Agencies to adopt rules implementing the other bank ``broker'' exceptions in Section 3(a)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act that are not addressed in this proposal. If any rules (including exemptions) related to these other exceptions are adopted in the future, they would be adopted jointly by the SEC and Board. As required by the GLBA, the Board, OCC, FDIC, and OTS (collectively, the Banking Agencies) will develop, and request public comment on, recordkeeping rules for banks that operate under the ``broker'' exceptions in Section 3(a)(4) of the Exchange Act.\\19\\ These rules, which will be developed in consultation with the SEC, will establish recordkeeping requirements to enable banks to demonstrate compliance with the terms of the statutory exceptions and the final rules ultimately jointly adopted and that are designed to facilitate compliance with the statutory exceptions and those rules. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\19\\ See 12 U.S.C. 1828(t)(1). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- II. Networking Arrangements The third-party brokerage (``networking'') exception in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4)(B)(i) permits a bank to avoid being considered a broker if, under certain conditions, it enters into a contractual or other written arrangement with a registered broker-dealer under which the broker-dealer offers brokerage services to bank customers (``networking arrangement'').\\20\\ The networking exception does not address the type or amount of compensation that a bank may receive from its broker-dealer partner under a networking arrangement. However, the networking exception generally provides that a bank may not pay its unregistered employees \\21\\ incentive compensation for referring a customer to the broker-dealer or for any securities transaction conducted by the customer at the broker-dealer. Nevertheless, the statutory exception does permit a bank employee to receive a ``nominal one-time cash fee of a fixed dollar amount'' for referring bank customers to the broker-dealer if payment of the referral fee is not ``contingent on whether the referral results in a transaction.'' \\22\\ Congress included the limitation on incentive compensation to reduce securities sales practice concerns regarding unregistered bank employees.\\23\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\20\\ 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)(B)(i). \\21\\ An unregistered bank employee is an employee that is not an associated person of a broker or dealer and is not qualified pursuant to the rules of a self-regulatory organization. \\22\\ 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)(B)(i)(VI). \\23\\ See H.R. Rep. No. 106-74, pt. 3, at 163 (1999) (``[T]he conditions contained in the networking exception * * * restrict the securities activities of unregistered bank personnel to reduce sales practice concerns.''). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A. Proposed Definitions Related to the Payment of Referral Fees The proposed rules define certain terms used in the networking exception in the Exchange Act related to referral fees and terms used in these proposed definitions. The proposed rules also provide an exemption from certain of the requirements in the networking exception with respect to payment for referrals of certain institutional customers and high net worth customers. 1. Proposed Definition of ``Nominal One-Time Cash Fee of a Fixed Dollar Amount'' Under the proposal, the term ``nominal one-time cash fee of a fixed dollar amount'' would be defined as a cash payment for a referral in an amount that meets any one of three alternative standards.\\24\\ The Agencies believe that these alternatives provide useful and appropriate flexibility to banks of all sizes and locations to use different business models and to take into account economic differences around the country in assessing whether a cash referral fee paid in a particular instance is a ``nominal'' amount for purposes of the networking exception. The three alternatives are consistent with the statutory ``nominal'' fee requirement because the amount of compensation permitted under each of the three formulations would be small in relation to the employee's overall compensation and therefore unlikely to create undue incentives for bank employees to pre-sell securities to bank customers. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\24\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 700(c). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Under the first alternative, a referral fee would be considered nominal if it did not exceed either twice the average of the minimum and maximum hourly wage established by the bank for the current or prior year for the job family that includes the relevant employee, or 1/1000th of the average of the minimum and maximum annual base salary established by the bank for the current or prior year for the job family that includes the relevant employee.\\25\\ The proposed rules define a ``job family'' for these purposes as a group of jobs or positions involving similar responsibilities, or requiring similar skills, education or training, that a bank, or a separate unit, branch or department of a bank, has established and uses in the ordinary course of its business to distinguish among its employees for purposes of hiring, promotion, and compensation.\\26\\ Depending on a bank's internal employee classification system, examples of a job family may include tellers, loan officers, or branch managers. A bank should not deviate from its ordinary classification of jobs for purposes of determining whether a referral fee would be considered nominal under this standard. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\25\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 700(c)(1). \\26\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 700(d). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Under the second alternative, a referral fee would be considered ``nominal'' if it did not exceed twice the employee's actual base hourly wage.\\27\\ Thus, unlike the first option, this alternative is based on the actual hourly base wage of the employee receiving the referral fee. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\27\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 700(c)(2). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Under the third alternative, a referral fee would be considered ``nominal'' for purposes of the networking exception if the payment did not exceed twenty-five dollars ($25).\\28\\ This dollar amount would be adjusted for inflation on April 1, 2012, and every five years thereafter, to reflect any changes in the value of the Employment Cost Index For Wages and Salaries, Private Industry Workers (or any successor index thereto), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from December 31, 2006.\\29\\ The Agencies selected this index because it is a widely used and broad indicator of increases in the wages of private industry workers, which includes bank employees. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\28\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 700(c)(3). \\29\\ Each adjustment would be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1. Proposed Exchange Act Rule 700(f). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A bank employee may receive a referral fee under the networking exception and Proposed Exchange Act Rule 700 for each referral made to a broker-dealer, including separate referrals of the same individual or entity. Referral fees paid under the networking exception must be paid in cash and fixed. The networking exception and the proposed rules do not permit a bank to pay referral fees in non-cash forms, such as vacation packages, stock grants, annual leave, or consumer goods.\\30\\ We request comments on whether these alternatives provide banks sufficient flexibility to pay nominal referral fees without creating inappropriate incentives. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\30\\ See Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4)(B)(i)(VI), permitting payment of a ``nominal one-time cash fee.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- [[Page 77525]] 2. Proposed Definition of ``Contingent on Whether the Referral Results in a Transaction'' Under the statutory networking exception, a nominal fee paid to an unregistered bank employee for referring a customer to a broker or dealer may not be contingent on whether the referral results in a transaction. The objective is to reward bank employees for furthering the relationship with the broker without creating concerns about the securities sales practices of unregistered bank employees. Under the proposal, a fee would be considered ``contingent on whether the referral results in a transaction'' if payment of the fee is dependent on whether the referral results in a purchase or sale of a security; whether an account is opened with a broker or dealer; whether the referral results in a transaction involving a particular type of security; or whether the referral results in multiple securities transactions.\\31\\ The proposed rules, however, also recognize that a referral fee may be contingent on whether a customer (1) contacts or keeps an appointment with a broker or dealer as a result of the referral; or (2) meets any objective, base-line qualification criteria established by the bank or broker or dealer for customer referrals, including such criteria as minimum assets, net worth, income, or marginal federal or state income tax rate, or any requirement for citizenship or residency that the broker or dealer, or the bank, may have established generally for referrals for securities brokerage accounts.\\32\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\31\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 700(a). ``Referral'' would be defined to mean the action taken by a bank employee to direct a customer of the bank to a broker or dealer for the purchase or sale of securities for the customer's account. Proposed Exchange Act Rule 700(e). \\32\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 700(a). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. Proposed Definition of ``Incentive Compensation'' As noted above, the networking exception prohibits unregistered employees of a bank that refer customers to a broker or dealer under the exception from receiving ``incentive compensation'' for the referral or any securities transaction conducted by the customer at the broker-dealer other than a nominal, non-contingent referral fee. To provide banks and their employees additional guidance in this area, Proposed Rule 700(b) defines ``incentive compensation'' as compensation that is intended to encourage a bank employee to refer potential customers to a broker or dealer or give a bank employee an interest in the success of a securities transaction at a broker or dealer.\\33\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\33\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 700(b). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The proposed ``incentive compensation'' definition excludes certain types of bonus compensation. The purpose of the exclusions is to recognize that certain types of bonuses are not likely to give unregistered employees a promotional interest in the brokerage services offered by the broker-dealers with which the bank networks and to avoid affecting bonus plans of banks generally. The proposal excludes compensation paid by a bank under a bonus or similar plan that is paid on a discretionary basis and based on multiple factors or variables. These factors or variables must include significant factors or variables that are not related to securities transactions at the broker or dealer.\\34\\ In addition, a referral made by the employee to a broker or dealer may not be a factor or variable in determining the employee's compensation under the plan and the employee's compensation under the plan may not be determined by reference to referrals made by any other person.\\35\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\34\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 700(b)(1)(ii)(A). A non- securities factor or variable would be considered ``significant'' under this proposed provision if it plays a non-trivial role in determining an employee's compensation under the bonus or similar plan. Moreover, a bank would not be in compliance with this proposed provision to the extent that it established or maintained a ``sham'' non-securities factor or variable in its bonus or similar plan for the purpose of evading this proposed restriction. \\35\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 700(b)(1)(ii)(C) and (D). The requirement that an employee's compensation not be based on ``a referral'' made by the employee or another person also means that the employee's compensation under the bonus or similar plan may not vary based on the number of securities referrals made by the employee or another person to a broker or dealer. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition, the proposed rule provides that the definition of incentive compensation shall not be construed to prevent a bank from compensating an officer, director or employee on the basis of any measure of the overall profitability of (1) the bank, either on a stand-alone or consolidated basis; (2) any of the bank's affiliates (other than a broker or dealer) or operating units; or (3) a broker or dealer if such profitability is only one of multiple factors or variables used to determine the compensation of the officer, director, or employee and those factors or variables include significant factors or variables that are not related to the profitability of the broker or dealer.\\36\\ Under this definition, banks would be permitted to take account of the full range of business for high net worth or institutional customers that an employee has brought to the bank and its partner broker-dealers. Comment is solicited on whether existing bank bonus programs would fit, or could be easily adjusted to fit, within the proposed exclusions from the definition of incentive compensation discussed in this Section. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\36\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 700(b)(2). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- B. Proposed Exemption for Payment of More Than a Nominal Fee for Referring Institutional Customers and High Net Worth Customers The proposal also includes a conditional exemption that would permit a bank to pay an employee a contingent referral fee of more than a nominal amount for referring to a broker or dealer an institutional customer or high net worth customer with which the bank has a contractual or other written networking arrangement.\\37\\ Banks that pay their employees only nominal, non-contingent fees in accordance with Proposed Rule 700 for referring customers--including institutional or high net worth customers--to a broker or dealer would not need to rely on this exemption for these purposes. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\37\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The purpose of the proposed exemption and its conditions is to recognize that sizable institutions and high net worth individuals, when provided appropriate information, are more likely to be able to understand and evaluate the relationship between the bank and its employees and its broker-dealer partner and any resulting securities transaction with the broker-dealer. To take advantage of the proposed exemption, the bank must comply with the conditions in the proposed exemption as well as the terms and conditions in the statutory networking exception (other than the compensation restrictions in Section 3(a)(4)(B)(i)(VI) of the Exchange Act's networking exception). The conditions in the proposed exemption are designed, among other things, to help ensure that institutional and high net worth customers receive appropriate investor protections and have the information to understand the financial interest of the bank employee so they can make informed choices. The following summarizes the conditions included in the proposed exemption. 1. Definitions of ``Institutional Customer'' and ``High Net Worth Customer'' The proposed exemption defines an ``institutional customer'' to mean any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, trust, or other non- [[Page 77526]] natural person that has at least $10 million in investments or $40 million in assets. A non-natural person also may qualify as an ``institutional customer'' with respect to a referral if the customer has $25 million in assets and the bank employee refers the customer to the broker or dealer for investment banking services.\\38\\ The lower asset threshold for referrals for investment banking services is designed to permit banks to facilitate access to capital markets by referring smaller businesses to broker-dealers. ``High net worth customer'' is defined to mean any natural person who, either individually or jointly with his or her spouse, has at least $5 million in net worth excluding the primary residence and associated liabilities of the person and, if applicable, his or her spouse. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\38\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701(d)(2). ``Investment banking services'' are defined to include, without limitation; acting as an underwriter in an offering for an issuer, acting as a financial adviser in a merger, acquisition, tender-offer or similar transaction, providing venture capital, equity lines of credit, private investment-private equity transactions or similar investments, serving as placement agent for an issuer, and engaging in similar activities. Id. at 701(d)(3). When used in this proposal, the term ``include, without limitation'' means a non-exhaustive list. This usage is not intended to suggest that the term ``including'' as used in the Exchange Act and the rules under that Act means an exhaustive list. The use of the term ``including, but not limited to'' in Exchange Act Rules 10b-10 and 15b7-1 is also not intended to create a negative implication regarding the use of ``including'' without the term ``but not limited to'' in other Exchange Act rules. See Exchange Act Release No. 49879, 69 FR 39682 (June 30, 2004), at footnote 76. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The dollar amount threshold for both institutional customers and high net worth customers would be adjusted for inflation on April 1, 2012, and every five years thereafter, to reflect changes in the value of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Chain-Type Price Index, as published by the Department of Commerce, from December 21, 2006. The Agencies selected this index because it is a widely used and broad indicator of inflation in the U.S. economy. A bank would be required to determine that a non-natural person referred to a broker or dealer under the exemption is an institutional customer before the referral fee is paid to the bank employee. In the case of a customer that is a natural person, the bank, prior to or at the time of any referral, would be required either to (1) determine that the customer is a high net worth customer; or (2) obtain a signed acknowledgment from the customer that the customer meets the standards to be considered a high net worth customer. The purpose of this condition is to provide the bank with a reasonable basis to believe the person meets the requirements of the exemption.\\39\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\39\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701(a)(2)(ii). As discussed below (see infra at II.B.4.), the written agreement between the bank and the broker or dealer also must require the broker or dealer to determine whether a customer meets these qualification standards before the referral fee is paid to the bank employee. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. Conditions Relating to Bank Employees For a bank employee to receive a contingent or greater-than-nominal referral fee under the proposed exemption, the bank employee must meet other conditions designed to help ensure that the referral occurs in the ordinary course of the unregistered bank employee's activities and that the employee has not previously been disqualified under the Exchange Act. In particular, the bank employee-- May not be qualified or otherwise required to be qualified pursuant to the rules of a self-regulatory organization (``SRO''); \\40\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\40\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701(a)(1)(i)(A). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Must be predominantly engaged in banking activities other than making referrals to a broker-dealer; \\41\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\41\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701(a)(1)(i)(B). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Must not be subject to a ``statutory disqualification'' as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act (other than subparagraph (E) of that Section); \\42\\ and --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\42\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701(a)(1)(i)(C). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Must encounter the ``high net worth customer'' or ``institutional customer'' in the ordinary course of the bank employee's assigned duties for the bank.\\43\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\43\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701(a)(1)(ii). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. Other Conditions Relating to the Banks The proposed exemption also would require that the bank provide the high net worth customer or institutional customer being referred to the bank's broker-dealer partner certain written disclosures about the employee's interest in the referral prior to or at the time of the referral.\\44\\ These disclosures would have to clearly and conspicuously disclose (1) the name of the broker or dealer; and (2) that the bank employee participates in an incentive compensation program under which the employee may receive a fee of more than a nominal amount for referring the customer to the broker or dealer and that payment of the fee may be contingent on whether the referral results in a transaction with the broker or dealer.\\45\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\44\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701(a)(2)(i). \\45\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701(b). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition, to allow verification before the referral fee is paid to the bank employee, the bank would be required to provide the broker or dealer the name of the employee and such other identifying information that may be necessary for the broker or dealer to determine whether the bank employee is associated with a broker or dealer or is subject to statutory disqualification (as defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act, other than subparagraph (E)).\\46\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\46\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701(a)(2)(iii). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The proposed exemption also provides that a bank that acts in good faith and that has reasonable policies and procedures in place to comply with the requirements of the proposed exemption would not be considered a ``broker'' under Section 3(a)(4) of the Exchange Act solely because the bank fails, in a particular instance, to determine that a customer is an institutional or high net worth customer, provide the customer the required disclosures, or provide the broker or dealer the required information concerning the bank employee receiving the referral fee within the time periods prescribed. If the bank is seeking to comply and takes reasonable and prompt steps to remedy the error, such as by promptly making the required determination or promptly providing the broker or dealer the required information, the bank should not lose the exemption from registration in these circumstances. Similarly, to promote compliance with the terms of the exemption, the bank must make reasonable efforts to reclaim the portion of the referral fee paid to the bank employee for a referral that does not, following any required remedial actions, meet the requirements of the exemption and that exceeds the amount the bank otherwise would be permitted to pay under the statutory networking exception and proposed Exchange Act Rule 700.\\47\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\47\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701(a)(2)(iv). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. Provisions of Written Agreement The proposed exemption also would require that the bank and its broker-dealer partner include certain provisions in their written agreement that obligate the bank or the broker or dealer to take certain actions. These provisions are designed to help ensure that banks and broker-dealers operate within the terms of the exemption and provide appropriate protections to customers referred under the exemption. Banks, brokers and dealers are expected to comply with the terms of their written networking agreements. [[Page 77527]] If a broker or dealer or bank does not comply with the terms of the agreement, however, the bank would not become a ``broker'' under Section 3(a)(4) of the Exchange Act or lose its ability to operate under the proposed exemption.\\48\\ A bank should not be required to register as a result of the actions of the broker or dealer. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\48\\ The Commission anticipates that it will be necessary for either NASD or the Commission to adopt a rule requiring broker- dealers to comply with the written agreements discussed in this Section. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- a. Customer and Employee Qualifications First, the proposed exemption provides that the written agreement between the bank and the broker or dealer must provide for the bank and the broker-dealer to determine, before a referral fee is paid to a bank employee under the exemption, that the employee is not subject to statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act (other than subparagraph (E) of that Section). In addition, as noted above, the written agreement must provide for the broker-dealer to determine, before the referral fee is paid, that the customer being referred is an institutional or high net worth customer.\\49\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\49\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701(a)(3)(i). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- b. Suitability or Sophistication Analysis by Broker-Dealer As a method of providing additional investor protections, the proposed exemption requires that the written agreement between the bank and broker or dealer must provide for the broker or dealer to perform a suitability or sophistication analysis of a securities transaction or the customer being referred, respectively. The type and timing of the analysis needed to be conducted by the broker or dealer depends on whether the referral fee is contingent on the completion of a securities transaction at the broker or dealer. For contingent fees, the written agreement between the bank and the broker-dealer must provide for the broker or dealer to conduct a suitability analysis of any securities transaction that triggers any portion of the contingency fee in accordance with the rules of the broker's or dealer's applicable SRO as if the broker or dealer had recommended the securities transaction.\\50\\ This analysis must be performed by the broker or dealer before each securities transaction on which the referral fee is contingent is conducted. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\50\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701(a)(3)(ii)(A). Because the proposed exemption provides for a broker or dealer to conduct its suitability analysis in accordance with the rules of its applicable SRO, the broker or dealer may follow and take advantage of any applicable SRO rules or interpretations that allow the broker or dealer to make an alternative suitability evaluation. See, e.g., NASD IM-2310-3 (discussing a member's suitability obligations with respect to certain institutional investors). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- For a non-contingent referral fee, the written agreement must provide for the broker or dealer to conduct, before the referral fee is paid, either (1) a ``sophistication'' analysis of the customer being referred; or (2) a suitability analysis with respect to all securities transactions requested by the customer contemporaneously with the referral. Under the ``sophistication'' analysis option, the broker or dealer would be required to determine that the customer has the capability to evaluate investment risk and make independent decisions, and determine that the customer is exercising independent judgment based on the customer's own independent assessment of the opportunities and risks presented by a potential investment, market factors, and other investment considerations.\\51\\ This ``sophistication'' analysis is based on elements of NASD IM-2310-3 (Suitability Obligations to Institutional Customers). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\51\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701(a)(3)(ii)(B)(1). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Alternatively, the broker or dealer could perform a suitability analysis of all securities transactions requested by the customer contemporaneously with the referral in accordance with the rules of the broker's or dealer's applicable SRO as if the broker or dealer had recommended the securities transaction.\\52\\ Thus, the proposed exemption gives a broker or dealer the flexibility to perform a suitability analysis in connection with all referrals made under the exemption (regardless of whether the referral fee is contingent or not) if the broker or dealer determines that such an approach is appropriate for business reasons. c. Notice From Broker-Dealer to Bank Regarding Customer Qualification --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\52\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701(a)(3)(ii)(B)(2). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Under the proposed exemption, the written agreement between the bank and the broker-dealer would also be required to provide that the broker-dealer must promptly inform the bank if the broker-dealer determines that (1) the customer referred to the broker-dealer is not a ``high net worth customer'' or an ``institutional customer,'' as applicable; (2) the bank employee receiving the referral fee is subject to statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act, except subparagraph (E) of that Section; or (3) the customer or the securities transaction(s) to be conducted by the customer do not meet the applicable standard set forth in the suitability or sophistication determination Section above.\\53\\ The notice will help banks monitor their compliance with the exemption and take remedial action when necessary. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\53\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701(a)(3)(iii). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. Referral Fees Permitted under the Exemption If the foregoing conditions are met, the proposed exemption would allow a bank employee to receive a referral fee for referring an institutional or high net worth customer to a broker or dealer that is greater than a ``nominal'' amount and that is contingent on whether the referral results in a transaction at the broker or dealer. The exemption places certain limits on how such a referral fee may be structured to reduce the potential ``salesman's stake'' of the bank employee in securities transactions conducted at the broker-dealer. Specifically, the exemption provides that the referral fee may be a dollar amount based on a fixed percentage of the revenues received by the broker or dealer for investment banking services provided to the customer.\\54\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\54\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701(d)(4)(ii). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Alternatively, the referral fee may be a predetermined dollar amount, or a dollar amount determined in accordance with a predetermined formula, so long as the amount does not vary based on (1) the revenue generated by, or the profitability of, securities transactions conducted by the customer with the broker or dealer; (2) the quantity, price, or identity of securities purchased or sold over time by the customer with the broker or dealer; or (3) the number of customer referrals made.\\55\\ For these purposes, ``predetermined'' means established or fixed before the referral is made. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\55\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701(d)(4)(i). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As the exemption provides, these restrictions do not prevent a referral fee from being paid in multiple installments or from being based on a fixed percentage of the total dollar amount of assets placed in an account with the broker or dealer. Additionally, these restrictions do not prevent a referral fee from being based on the total dollar amount of assets maintained by the customer with the broker or dealer, or from being contingent on whether the customer opens an account with the broker or dealer or executes one or more transactions in the account during the initial phases of the account. A bank employee also may receive a permissible referral fee for each referral [[Page 77528]] made under the exemption. We request comment on all aspects of the definition of a referral fee. 6. Permissible Bonus Compensation Not Restricted The proposed exemption for high net worth and institutional customers expressly provides that nothing in the exemption would prevent or prohibit a bank from paying, or a bank employee from receiving, any type of compensation under a bonus or similar plan that would not be considered incentive compensation under paragraph (b)(1), or that is described in paragraph (b)(2), of proposed Exchange Act Rule 700 (implementing the networking exception).\\56\\ As explained above, these types of bonus arrangements do not tend to create the kind of financial incentives for bank employees that the statute was designed to address. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\56\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 701(c). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- C. Scope of Networking Exception and Institutional/High Net Worth Exemption Nothing in the statutory networking exception or the proposed rules limits or restricts the ability of a bank employee to refer customers to other departments or divisions of the bank itself, including, for example, the bank's trust, fiduciary or custodial department. Likewise, the networking exception and the proposed rules do not apply to referrals of retail, institutional or high net worth customers to a broker or dealer or other third party solely for transactions not involving securities, such as loans, futures contracts (other than a security future), foreign currency, or over-the-counter commodities. III. Trust and Fiduciary Activities Exception Section 3(a)(4)(B)(ii) of the Exchange Act (the ``trust and fiduciary exception'') permits a bank, under certain conditions, to effect securities transactions in a trustee or fiduciary capacity without being registered as a broker.\\57\\ Under this exception from the definition of ``broker,'' a bank must effect such transactions in its trust department, or other department that is regularly examined by bank examiners for compliance with fiduciary principles and standards.\\58\\ The bank also must be ``chiefly compensated'' for such transactions, consistent with fiduciary principles and standards, on the basis of: (1) An administration or annual fee; (2) a percentage of assets under management; (3) a flat or capped per order processing fee that does not exceed the cost the bank incurs in executing such securities transactions; or (4) any combination of such fees.\\59\\ These fees are referred to as ``relationship compensation'' in the proposed rules. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\57\\ 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)(B)(ii). \\58\\ Id. The Agencies will rely on the appropriate Federal banking agency for a bank to determine whether the bank's activities are conducted in the bank's trust department or other department regularly examined by the agency's examiners for compliance with fiduciary principles and standards. \\59\\ 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)(B)(ii)(I). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Banks relying on this exception may not publicly solicit brokerage business, other than by advertising that they effect transactions in securities in conjunction with advertising their other trust activities.\\60\\ In addition, a bank that effects a transaction in the United States of a publicly traded security under the exception must execute the transaction in accordance with Exchange Act section 3(a)(4)(C).\\61\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\60\\ 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)(B)(ii)(II). \\61\\ 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)(C). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This section requires that the bank direct the trade to a registered broker-dealer for execution, effect the trade through a cross trade or substantially similar trade either within the bank or between the bank and an affiliated fiduciary that is not in contravention of fiduciary principles established under applicable federal or state law, or effect the trade in some other manner that the Commission permits.\\62\\ The purpose of the rules in this area is to explain the Agencies' interpretation of certain terms and concepts used in the statute and to implement the exception. The trust and fiduciary exception recognizes the traditional securities role banks have performed for trust and fiduciary customers and includes conditions to help ensure that a bank does not operate a securities broker in the trust department. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\62\\ 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)(C)(i)-(iii). As discussed below (see infra at VI.C.), the Agencies are proposing to adopt a rule that would permit banks to effect trades in investment company securities through the National Securities Clearing Corporation's Mutual Fund Services (``Fund/SERV'') or directly with the investment company's transfer agent. Trades effected by a bank in accordance with the proposed Fund/SERV rule would be conducted in accordance with section 3(a)(4)(C) of the Exchange Act. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A. ``Chiefly Compensated'' Test and Bank-Wide Exemption Based on Two- Year Rolling Averages The proposed rules provide that a bank meets the ``chiefly compensated'' condition in the trust and fiduciary exception if the ``relationship-total compensation percentage'' for each trust or fiduciary account of the bank is greater than 50 percent.\\63\\ The ``relationship-total compensation percentage'' for a trust or fiduciary account would be calculated by (1) dividing the relationship compensation attributable to the account during each of the immediately preceding two years by the total compensation attributable to the account during the relevant year; (2) translating the quotient obtained for each of the two years into a percentage; and (3) then averaging the percentages obtained for each of the two immediately preceding years.\\64\\ Under the proposal, a ``trust or fiduciary account'' means an account for which the bank acts in a trustee or fiduciary capacity as defined in section 3(a)(4)(D) of the Exchange Act.\\65\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\63\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 721(a)(1). \\64\\ The rule provides for this process to be accomplished by calculating the ``yearly compensation percentage'' and the ``relationship-total compensation percentage'' for the account. Proposed Exchange Act Rule 721(a)(2) and (3). \\65\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 721(a)(5). The definition of ``fiduciary capacity'' included in section 3(a)(4)(D) of the Exchange Act is based on the definition of that term in part 9 of the OCC's regulations, which relates to the trust and fiduciary activities of national banks, in effect at the time of enactment of the GLB Act. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The proposed rules also include an exemption that would permit a bank to follow an alternate test to the account-by-account approach to the ``chiefly compensated'' condition. Under this exemption, the bank may calculate the compensation it receives from all of its trust and fiduciary accounts on a bank-wide basis. The alternative is designed to simplify compliance, alleviate concerns about inadvertent noncompliance, and reduce the costs and disruptions banks likely would incur under the account-by-account approach. To use this bank-wide methodology, the bank would have to meet two conditions. First, the bank would have to comply with the conditions in the trust and fiduciary exception (other than the compensation test in Section 3(a)(4)(B)(ii)(I)) and comply with Section 3(a)(4)(C) (relating to trade execution) of the Exchange Act.\\66\\ In addition, the ``aggregate relationship-total compensation percentage'' for the bank's trust and fiduciary business as a whole would have to be at least 70 percent.\\67\\ We chose this percentage to ensure that a bank's trust department is not unduly dependent on non-relationship compensation from securities transactions. We invite comments generally on the appropriateness of the proposed exemption as well as this percentage [[Page 77529]] and the other specific terms of the exemption. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\66\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 722(a)(1). \\67\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 722(a)(2). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The ``aggregate relationship-total compensation percentage'' of a bank operating under the bank-wide approach would be calculated in a similar manner as the ``relationship-total compensation percentage'' of an account under the account-by-account, except that the calculations would be based on the aggregate relationship compensation and total compensation received by the bank from all of its trust and fiduciary accounts during each of the two immediately preceding years. That is, it would be determined by (1) dividing the relationship compensation attributable to the bank's trust and fiduciary business as a whole during each of the immediately preceding two years by the total compensation attributable to the bank's trust and fiduciary business as a whole during the relevant year; (2) translating the quotient obtained for each of the two years into a percentage; and (3) then averaging the percentages obtained for each of the two immediately preceding years.\\68\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\68\\ As a technical matter, the rule provides for this process to be accomplished by calculating the ``yearly bank-wide compensation percentage'' and the ``aggregate relationship-total compensation percentage'' for the bank's trust and fiduciary business as a whole. Proposed Exchange Act Rule 722(b) and (c). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Under either the account-by-account or bank-wide approach, a bank would have the flexibility to elect to use a calendar year or the bank's fiscal year for purposes of complying with these compensation provisions.\\69\\ In addition, whether a bank decides to use the account- by-account approach or the bank-wide approach, the bank's compliance with the relevant compensation restriction would be based on a two-year rolling average of the compensation attributable to the trust or fiduciary account or the bank's trust or fiduciary business, respectively. This is to allow for short-term fluctuations that otherwise could lead a bank to fall out of compliance with the exception or exemption from year to year. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\69\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 721(a)(6). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- B. Proposed Definition of ``Relationship Compensation' Both the account-by-account and bank-wide approaches discussed above are based in part on the relationship compensation attributable to one or more of a bank's trust or fiduciary accounts. The proposal defines the term ``relationship compensation'' to mean any compensation a bank receives that consists of (1) an administration fee; (2) an annual fee (payable on a monthly, quarterly or other basis); (3) a fee based on a percentage of assets under management; (4) a flat or capped per order processing fee, paid by or on behalf of a customer or beneficiary, that is equal to not more than the cost incurred by the bank in connection with executing securities transactions for trust or fiduciary accounts; or (5) any combination of these fees.\\70\\ These types of compensation are identified in the statute. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\70\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 721(a)(4). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The proposed rules also provide examples of fees that would be considered an administration fee or a fee based on a percentage of assets under management for these purposes. Specifically, the rule provides that a fee based on a percentage of assets under management (an ``AUM fee'') includes, without limitation-- A fee paid by an investment company pursuant to a plan under 17 CFR 270.12b-1. Although Rule 12b-1 fees are related to mutual funds, we believe they should be viewed as relationship compensation because they are paid on an assets under management basis, rather than on a transactional basis; \\71\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\71\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 721(a)(4)(iii)(A). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A fee paid by an investment company for personal service or the maintenance of shareholder accounts; \\72\\ and --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\72\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 721(a)(4)(iii)(B). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A fee paid by an investment company based on a percentage of assets under management for any of the following services: (1) Providing transfer agent or sub-transfer agent services for the beneficial owners of investment company shares; (2) aggregating and processing purchase and redemption orders for investment company shares; (3) providing the beneficial owners with account statements showing their purchases, sales, and positions in the investment company; (4) processing dividend payments to the account for the investment company; (5) providing sub-accounting services to the investment company for shares held beneficially in the account; (6) forwarding communications from the investment company to the beneficial owners, including proxies, shareholder reports, dividend and tax notices, and updated prospectuses; or (7) receiving, tabulating, and transmitting proxies executed by the beneficial owners of investment company shares in the account.\\73\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\73\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 721(a)(4)(iii)(C). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition, the rule provides that the term ``administration fee'' includes, without limitation-- A fee paid for personal services, tax preparation, or real estate settlement services; and A fee paid by an investment company for personal service, the maintenance of shareholder accounts or the types of sub-transfer agent or other services described above.\\74\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\74\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 721(a)(4)(i). To the extent these fees are paid by an investment company based on a percentage of assets under management, these fees would be a permissible AUM fee. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The examples of an administration fee and an asset under management fee included in the proposed rules are provided only for illustrative purposes. Other types of fees or fees for other types of services could be an administration fee or an AUM fee. In addition, an administration fee, annual fee or AUM fee attributable to a trust or fiduciary account is considered relationship compensation regardless of what entity or person pays the fee, and regardless of whether the fee is related to only securities assets, to a combination of securities and non- securities assets, or to only non-securities assets. These fees are part of the compensation for acting as a trustee or fiduciary. Under the proposal, relationship compensation also would include a flat or capped per order processing fee, paid by (or on behalf of) a customer or beneficiary, that is equal to not more than the cost incurred by the bank in connection with executing securities transactions for trust or fiduciary accounts.\\75\\ If a bank seeks to include within this per order processing fee any fixed or variable processing costs incurred by the bank beyond those charged by the executing broker or dealer, the bank should maintain appropriate policies and procedures governing the allocation of these costs to the orders processed for trust or fiduciary customers.\\76\\ This should help [[Page 77530]] ensure that profits derived from per trade charges are not masked as costs of processing the trades. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\75\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 721(a)(4)(iv). \\76\\ A bank effecting transactions for trust or fiduciary customers through its trust or fiduciary departments may use other divisions or departments of the bank, or other affiliated or unaffiliated third parties, to handle aspects of these transactions. The bank must continue to act in a trustee or fiduciary capacity with respect to the account and, accordingly, should exercise appropriate diligence in selecting persons to provide services to the bank's trust or fiduciary customers and in overseeing the services provided in accordance with the bank's fiduciary obligations. No party, other than the bank (including, without limitation, a transfer agent or investment adviser), working in conjunction with the bank may rely on the bank's exception or exemption from ``broker'' status. To the extent that any such third party performs activities that would make that entity a broker under Section 3(a)(4) of the Exchange Act that entity would be required to register as a broker (in the absence of an applicable exemption or regulatory relief) notwithstanding any written or unwritten agreement the third party may have with the bank. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- C. Advertising Restrictions Section 3(a)(4)(B)(ii)(II) of the Exchange Act addresses advertisements and the proposed rules explain the Agencies' understanding of the terms used in the statute. The proposed rules provide that a bank complies with the advertising restriction if advertisements by or on behalf of the bank do not advertise that the bank provides securities brokerage services for trust or fiduciary accounts except as part of advertising the bank's broader trust or fiduciary services, and do not advertise the securities brokerage services provided by the bank to trust or fiduciary accounts more prominently than the other aspects of the trust or fiduciary services provided to such accounts.\\77\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\77\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 721(b). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- An ``advertisement'' for these purposes means any material that is published or used in any electronic or other public media, including any Web site, newspaper, magazine or other periodical, radio, television, telephone or tape recording, videotape display, signs or billboards, motion pictures, blast e-mail, or telephone directories (other than routine listings).\\78\\ Other types of material or information that is not distributed through public media would not be considered an advertisement. In addition, in considering whether an advertisement advertises the securities brokerage services provided to trust or fiduciary customers more prominently than the bank's other trust or fiduciary services, the nature, context and prominence of the information presented--and not simply the length of text or information devoted to a particular subject'should be considered. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\78\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 721(b)(2) (referencing Proposed Exchange Act Rule 760(g)(2)). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- D. Proposed Exemptions for Special Accounts, Transferred Accounts, and a De Minimis Number of Accounts The proposed rules also would permit a bank to exclude certain types of accounts for purposes of determining its compliance with the account-by-account or bank-wide compensation tests discussed above. These exclusions are intended to reduce administrative burdens and facilitate compliance in connection with accounts that do not present a pronounced risk that a bank is operating a securities broker within the trust department. We solicit comment on these exclusions and their specific proposed terms. Under the proposal, a bank could, in determining its compliance with either the account-by-account or bank-wide compensation tests, exclude any trust or fiduciary account that had been open for a period of less than 3 months during the relevant year.\\79\\ The proposal would also permit a bank to exclude, for purposes of determining its compliance with either of these compensation tests, any trust or fiduciary account that the bank acquired from another person as part of a merger, consolidation, acquisition, purchase of assets or similar transaction by the bank for 12 months after the date the bank acquired the account from the other person.\\80\\ Of course, in excluding such accounts, the bank would have to exclude all compensation it receives from such accounts from the relationship compensation to total compensation comparison. This approach would allow a bank to bring into compliance a group of acquired accounts. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\79\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 723(a). \\80\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 723(b). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Two additional exemptions would be provided for banks using the account-by-account approach. Specifically, a bank that uses the account-by-account approach would not be considered a broker for purposes of Section 3(a)(4) of the Exchange Act solely because a particular trust or fiduciary account does not meet the ``chiefly compensated'' test if, within 3 months of the end of the year in which the account fails to meet such standard, the bank transfers the account or the securities held by or on behalf of the account to a registered broker-dealer or another unaffiliated entity (such as an unaffiliated bank) that is not required to be registered as a broker or dealer.\\81\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\81\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 723(c). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Moreover, a bank using the account-by-account approach could exclude a small number of trust or fiduciary accounts not exceeding the lesser of (1) 1 percent of the total number of trust or fiduciary accounts held by the bank provided that if the number so obtained is less than 1, the amount would be rounded up to 1; or (2) 500.\\82\\ To rely on this exemption with respect to an account, the bank must not have relied on this exemption for such account during the immediately preceding year.\\83\\ In addition, the bank would be required to maintain records demonstrating that the securities transactions conducted by or on behalf of the excluded account were undertaken by the bank in the exercise of its trust or fiduciary responsibilities with respect to the account.\\84\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\82\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 723(d). \\83\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 723(d)(3). \\84\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 723(d)(1). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- IV. Sweep Accounts and Transactions in Money Market Funds Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4)(B)(v) excepts a bank from the definition of ``broker'' to the extent it ``effects transactions as part of a program for the investment or re-investment of deposit funds into any no-load, open-end management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act that holds itself out as a money market fund.''\\85\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\85\\ See Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4)(B)(v). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A. Proposed Sweep Account Definitions To provide banks with guidance on the sweep accounts exception, the proposal defines various terms under the exception. One key term is ``no-load.'' Under the proposal, no-load, in the context of an investment company or the securities it issues, means that the securities are part of a class or series in which a bank effects transactions that is not subject to a sales charge or a deferred sales charge. In addition, total charges against net assets of that class or series of securities for sales or sales promotion expenses, personal service, or the maintenance of shareholder accounts may not exceed 0.0025 of average net assets annually.\\86\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\86\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 740(c). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Consistent with NASD rules,\\87\\ under the proposed no-load definition, charges for the following would not be considered charges against net assets of a class or series of an investment company's securities for sales or sales promotion expenses, personal service, or the maintenance of shareholder accounts: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\87\\ See NASD Rule 2830. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) Providing transfer agent or sub-transfer agent services for beneficial owners of investment company shares; (2) Aggregating and processing purchase and redemption orders for investment company shares; (3) Providing beneficial owners with account statements showing their purchases, sales, and positions in the investment company; (4) Processing dividend payments for the investment company; (5) Providing sub-accounting services to the investment company for shares held beneficially; (6) Forwarding communications from the investment company to the [[Page 77531]] beneficial owners, including proxies, shareholder reports, dividend and tax notices, and updated prospectuses; or (7) Receiving, tabulating, and transmitting proxies executed by beneficial owners of investment company shares.\\88\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\88\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 740(c)(2). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- B. Proposed Exemption Regarding Money Market Fund Transactions The proposal also includes a new exemption that would permit banks, without registering as a broker, to effect transactions on behalf of a customer in securities issued by a money market fund under certain conditions.\\89\\ This proposed exemption recognizes that banks have long offered sweeps and other services that invest customer funds in money market funds that do not qualify as no-load funds under Commission and NASD rules. In particular, to qualify for the proposed exemption from broker registration, the bank would be required to provide the customer, directly or indirectly, any other product or service, the provision of which would not, in and of itself, require the bank to register as a broker or dealer under Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act.\\90\\ In addition, the class or series of money market fund securities that the bank provides the customer either would have to be no-load, or, if it is not no-load, the bank could not characterize or refer to the class or series of securities as no-load. For securities that are not no-load, the bank would be required to provide the customer, not later than at the time the customer authorizes the bank to effect the transactions, a prospectus for the securities.\\91\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\89\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 741. \\90\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 741(a)(1). \\91\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 741(a)(2)(ii)(A). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- V. Safekeeping and Custody A. Overview of Statutory Exception Section 3(a)(4)(B)(viii) of the Exchange Act provides banks with an exception from the ``broker'' definition for certain bank custody and safekeeping activities (``custody and safekeeping exception''). In particular, this provision allows a bank to perform the following activities if performed as part of its customary banking activities without registering as a ``broker'': Providing safekeeping or custody services with respect to securities, including the exercise of warrants and other rights on behalf of customers; Facilitating the transfer of funds or securities, as a custodian or a clearing agency, in connection with the clearance and settlement of its customers' transactions in securities; Effecting securities lending or borrowing transactions with or on behalf of customers as part of the above-described custodial services or investing cash collateral pledged in connection with such transactions; Holding securities pledged by a customer to another person or securities subject to purchase or resale agreements involving a customer, or facilitating the pledging or transfer of such securities by book entry or as otherwise provided under applicable law, if the bank maintains records separately identifying the securities and the customer; and Serving as a custodian or provider of other related administrative services to any individual retirement account, pension, retirement, profit sharing, bonus, thrift savings, incentive, or other similar benefit plan.\\92\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\92\\ 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)(B)(viii). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- B. Proposed Exemption The proposed rules contain an exemption that allows banks, subject to certain conditions, to accept orders for securities transactions from employee benefit plan accounts and individual retirement and similar accounts for which the bank acts as a custodian.\\93\\ In addition, the exemption allows banks, subject to certain conditions, to accept orders for securities transactions on an accommodation basis from other types of custodial accounts.\\94\\ These proposed exemptions are intended to allow a bank to perform the types of securities order- taking activities at times conducted in a custody department subject to conditions and limitations to protect investors and prevent a bank from using the exemptions to operate a securities broker in the bank. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\93\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 760(a). \\94\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 760(b). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Agencies seek comment on all aspects of the proposed exemptions, including the conditions they contain. The proposed rules do not contain other rules to implement the custody and safekeeping exception. The Agencies request comment on whether other rules in this area are appropriate or needed. A bank would have no need to rely on the custody exemption to the extent the bank conducts other custodial activities permitted by Section 3(a)(4)(B)(viii) (e.g., exercising warrants or other rights with respect to securities or effecting securities lending or borrowing transactions on behalf of custodial customers) or another of the proposed rules (e.g., proposed Exchange Act Rule 772, which permits banks to effect securities lending or borrowing transactions on behalf of certain non-custodial customers). In addition, a bank would not have to rely on the proposed exemption to the extent the bank holds securities in custody for a customer and provides clearance and settlement services to the account in connection with such securities, but the bank does not accept orders for securities transactions for the account or engage in other activities with respect to the account that would require the bank to be registered as a broker. The following discusses the scope and terms of the proposed custody exemption. 1. Employee Benefit Plan Accounts and Individual Retirement or Similar Accounts Under the proposed exemption, a bank would not be considered a broker for purposes of Section 3(a)(4) of the Exchange Act to the extent that, as part of its customary banking activities, the bank accepts orders to effect transactions in securities in an ``employee benefit plan account'' \\95\\ or an ``individual retirement account or similar account'' \\96\\ for which the bank acts as a custodian if the bank complies with the following. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\95\\ ``Employee benefit plan account'' would mean a pension plan, retirement plan, profit sharing plan, bonus plan, thrift savings plan, incentive plan, or other similar plan, including, without limitation, an employer-sponsored plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 401(a)), a governmental or other plan described in Section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 457), a tax-deferred plan described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 403(b)), a church plan, governmental, multiemployer or other plan described in Section 414(d), (e) or (f) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 414(d), (e) or (f)), an incentive stock option plan described in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 422); a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association Plan described in Section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(9)), a non- qualified deferred compensation plan (including a rabbi or secular trust), a supplemental or mirror plan, and a supplemental unemployment benefit plan. \\96\\ ``Individual retirement account or similar account'' would mean an individual retirement account as defined in Section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 408), Roth IRA as defined in Section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 408A), health savings account as defined in Section 223(d) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 223(d)), Archer medical savings accounts as defined in Section 220(d) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 220(d)), Coverdell education savings account as defined in Section 530 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 530), or other similar account. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- a. Employee Compensation Restriction The proposed custody exemption provides that, if a bank accepts securities orders for an employee benefit plan or individual retirement or similar account under the exemption, then no bank employee may receive compensation (including a fee paid [[Page 77532]] pursuant to a 12b-1 plan) from the bank, the executing broker or dealer, or any other person that is based on (1) whether a securities transaction is executed for the account; or (2) the quantity, price, or identity of the securities purchased or sold by the account.\\97\\ These proposed restrictions, which we believe are consistent with banking practices, are intended to reduce the financial incentives a bank employee might have to encourage a customer to submit securities orders to the bank and use a custody account as the functional equivalent of a securities brokerage account. They do not prohibit a bank employee from receiving compensation that is based on whether a customer establishes a custodial account with the bank, or that is based on the total amount of assets in a custodial account at account opening or at any other time. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\97\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 760(c). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The proposed custody exemption also expressly provides that these employee compensation restrictions do not prevent a bank employee from receiving payments under a bonus or similar plan that would be permissible under proposed Exchange Act Rule 700(b)(1) of the networking rules as if a referral had been made, or any profitability- based compensation described in proposed Exchange Act Rule 700(b)(2) of the networking rules. In addition, because these restrictions relate to securities transactions conducted in the relevant custody account, they would not prevent a bank employee from receiving a referral fee for referring the customer to a broker or dealer to engage in securities transactions at the broker-dealer that are unrelated to the custody account in accordance with the networking exception or the institutional customer and high net worth customer exemption (proposed Exchange Act Rule 701) for networking arrangements. b. Advertisements and Sales Literature The proposed custody exemption provides that a bank relying on the exemption may not advertise that it accepts orders for securities transactions for employee benefit plan accounts or individual retirement accounts or similar accounts for which the bank acts as custodian, except as part of advertising the other custodial or safekeeping services the bank provides to these accounts. In addition, the bank may not advertise that such accounts are securities brokerage accounts or that the bank's safekeeping and custody services substitute for a securities brokerage account.\\98\\ With respect only to individual retirement or similar accounts, advertisements and sales literature issued by or on behalf of the bank may not describe the securities order-taking services provided by the bank to these accounts more prominently than the other aspects of the custody or safekeeping services the bank provides.\\99\\ The purpose of these restrictions is similar to the purpose of the advertising rules in the trust and fiduciary exception. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\98\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 760(a)(2)(i) and (ii). As discussed above, the proposed rules define the term ``advertisement'' to mean material that is published or used in any electronic or other public media, including any Web site, newspaper, magazine or other periodical, radio, television, telephone or tape recording, videotape display, signs or billboards, motion pictures, or telephone directories (other than routine listings). Proposed Exchange Act Rule 760(g)(2). \\99\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 760(a)(3). ``Sales literature'' would mean any written or electronic communication, other than an advertisement, that is generally distributed or made generally available to customers of the bank or the public, including circulars, form letters, brochures, telemarketing scripts, seminar texts, published articles, and press releases concerning the bank's products or services. Proposed Exchange Act Rule 760(g)(5). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- c. Other Conditions The proposed custody exemption provides that a bank may accept orders for a securities transaction for an employee benefit plan account or an individual retirement account or similar account only if (1) the bank does not act in a trustee or fiduciary capacity (as defined in Section 3(a)(4)(D) of the Exchange Act) with respect to that account; (2) the bank complies with Section 3(a)(4)(C) of the Exchange Act in handling any order for a securities transaction for the account;\\100\\ and (3) the bank complies with Section 3(a)(4)(B)(viii)(II) of the Exchange Act relating to carrying broker activities.\\101\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\100\\ 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)(C). This provision provides that, to meet one of the exceptions from the ``broker'' definition under the Exchange Act one of three conditions with respect to transactions effected under the applicable Section must be satisfied. In particular, the bank must direct such trade to a registered broker- dealer for execution. In the alternative, the trade must be a cross trade or other substantially similar trade of a security that is made by the bank or between the bank and an affiliated fiduciary and is not in contravention of fiduciary principles established under applicable Federal or State law. Alternatively, the trade must be conducted in some other manner permitted under rules, regulations, or orders as the Commission may prescribe or issue. \\101\\ 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)(B)(viii)(II). This provision prohibits a custodian bank from acting as a carrying broker (as such term, and different formulations thereof, are used in Exchange Act Section 15(c)(3) and the rules and regulations under that Section) for any broker or dealer, unless such carrying broker activities are engaged in with respect to government securities. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- d. Non-Fiduciary and Non-Custodial Administrators or Recordkeepers The proposed exemption also would allow a bank that acts as a non- fiduciary and non-custodial administrator or recordkeeper for an employee benefit plan to accept securities orders for the plan if the bank and the custodian bank comply with all the conditions discussed in Sections V.B.1.a, b and c above and, in addition, the administrator/ recordkeeper bank does not execute a cross-trade with or for the employee benefit plan or net orders for securities for the plan, other than orders for shares of open-end investment companies not traded on an exchange.\\102\\ Executing cross-trades involves setting prices for securities transactions. The Agencies request comment on whether these conditions are consistent with the existing practices of banks acting as non-fiduciary and non-custodial administrators or recordkeepers. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\102\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 760(e). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. Accommodation Transactions Besides accepting securities orders for employee benefit plan and individual retirement and similar custodial accounts, banks also accept securities orders for other custodial accounts as an accommodation to the customer. The proposed custody exemption allows banks to continue to provide these order-taking services to other custodial accounts, subject to certain conditions designed to help ensure that these services continue to be provided only as an accommodation to customers and that a bank does not operate a securities broker out of its custody department. These conditions are discussed below. a. Accommodation Basis The proposed custody exemption expressly provides that a bank may accept securities orders for other custodial accounts only as an accommodation to the customer.\\103\\ The Banking Agencies will develop guidance to assist Banking Agency examiners in reviewing, as part of the agencies' ongoing supervisory and examination process, the order- taking services provided to other custodial accounts. This guidance will describe the types of policies, procedures and systems that a bank should have in place to help ensure that the bank accepts securities orders for other custodial accounts only as an accommodation to the customer and in a manner consistent with both the terms [[Page 77533]] and purposes of the custody exemption and the GLB Act. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\103\\ Proposed Exchange Rule Act 760(b)(1). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- b. Employee Compensation Restriction In order for a bank to rely on the custody exemption to accept orders for custodial accounts on an accommodation basis, the bank must comply with the employee compensation restrictions described above in Section B.1.a that apply with respect to employee benefit plans and individual retirement and similar accounts.\\104\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\104\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 760(b)(2) and (c). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- c. Bank Fees The proposed exemption also expressly limits the types of fees a bank that accepts accommodation orders for an account may charge for effecting securities transactions for the account. Specifically, any fee charged or received by the bank for effecting a securities transaction for the account may not vary based on (1) whether the bank accepted the order for the transaction; or (2) the quantity or price of the securities to be bought or sold.\\105\\ These restrictions do not prevent a bank from charging or receiving a fee that is based on the type of security purchased or sold by the account (e.g., a foreign security), provided the fee complies with the conditions set forth in the proposed exemption. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\105\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 760(b)(3). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- d. Advertising and Sales Literature Restrictions Under the proposed exemption, the bank's advertisements may not state that the bank accepts orders for securities transactions for a custodial account (other than an employee benefit plan or individual retirement account or similar account). In addition, the bank's sales literature (1) may state that the bank accepts securities orders for such an account only as part of describing the other custodial or safekeeping services the bank provides to the account; and (2) may not describe the securities order-taking services provided to such an account more prominently than the other aspects of the custody or safekeeping services provided by the bank to the account.\\106\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\106\\ Proposed Exchange Act Rule 760(b)(4) and (5). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- e. Investment Advice or Recommendations Under the proposed exemption, a bank that accepts securities orders for a custodial account on an accommodation basis would not be permitted to provide investment advice or research concerning securities to the account, make recommendations concerning securities to the account, or otherwise solicit securities transactions from the account. These restrictions would not, however, prohibit the bank from advertising its custodial services and disseminating sales literature that comply with the restrictions in the proposed exemption. These restrictions also would not prevent a bank employee from responding to customer inquiries regarding the bank's safekeeping and custody services by providing advertisements or sales literature describing the safekeeping, custody and related services the bank offers (provided those advertisement and sales literature comply with the restrictions in the proposed exemption), a prospectus prepared by a registered investment company, sales literature prepared by a registered investment company or by the broker or dealer that is the principal underwriter of the registered investment company pertaining to the registered investment company's products, or information based on any of those materials. Moreover, the proposed exemption allows a bank's employees to respond to customer inquiries concerning the bank's safekeeping, custodial or other services, such as inquiries concerning the customer's account or the availability of sweep or other services, so long as the bank does not provide investment advice or research concerning securities to the account or make a recommendation to the account concerning securities. The limitations and restrictions discussed in this part V.B.2, including those relating to investment advice and recommendations, relate only to those custodial accounts for which the bank accepts securities orders on an accommodation basis. Thus, for example, these limitations would not apply to (1) an employee benefit plan account or an individual retirement account or similar account; or (2) a trust or fiduciary account maintained by a customer with a bank even if that customer also maintains a custodial account with the bank. Similarly, the custody exemption does not prohibit a bank from cross-marketing the other products or services of the bank, including trust or fiduciary services, to its custodial customers. f. Other Conditions In addition to these conditions, a bank that accepts securities orders as an accommodation to a custodial account must comply with the conditions described in Section V.B.1.c. Thus, the bank may not rely on this proposed exemption to accept accommodation orders for a custodial account if the bank is acting in a trustee or fiduciary capacity (as defined in Section 3(a)(4)(D) of the Exchange Act) with respect to that account. In addition, the bank must comply with Section 3(a)(4)(C) of the Exchange Act in handling any order for a securities transaction for the account and with Section 3(a)(4)(B)(viii)(II) concerning carrying broker activities.\\107\\ The"
