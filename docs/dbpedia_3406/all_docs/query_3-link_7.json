With a presence in Europe, Middle East, Africa, South America and Asia-Pacific, Tokheim is one of the most recognized brands in the retail fueling industry.\n\n“Both Tokheim and OPW have been leaders in the retail fueling industry for more than a century,” said David Crouse, OPW President. “By integrating Tokheim’s advanced line of dispensers and automation systems, the combined business will be able to offer our customers an unparalleled end-to-end fueling solution.”\n\nTokheim is the fifth major acquisition for OPW in the past two-and-a-half years, and matches previous acquisitions (Fibrelite, KPS, Jump, Liquip) of category-leading brands outside the North American market.\n\n“OPW’s goal is to bring the very best solutions to our customers in all regions of the world,” said Keith Moye, OPW VP of Global Marketing. “Our combined product portfolio now comprises the industry’s broadest product offering, enabling us to bring a more complete solution to our customers.”"
