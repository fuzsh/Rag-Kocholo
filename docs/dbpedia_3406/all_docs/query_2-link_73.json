        "text": "Dover has completed the acquisition of Wayne Fueling Systems and announced the creation of Dover Fueling Solutions.\n\nThe Wayne acquisition is Dover’s fourth acquisition in the retail and commercial fueling space since the beginning of 2016. Dover is now combining these companies into a new business called Dover Fueling Solutions (“DFS”), which includes: Wayne, Tokheim, ClearView, Fairbanks, ProGauge, and OPW’s Fuel Management Systems.\n\nWayne, which was acquired by Dover for $780 million, is a global provider of fuel dispensing, payment, automation, and control technologies for retail and commercial fuel stations.\n\nThe focus of DFS will be to deliver advanced fuel dispensing equipment, electronic systems and payment, automatic tank gauging and wetstock management solutions to customers worldwide. The combined product portfolio of DFS and OPW represents the industry’s only global end-to-end fueling solution, according to the company.\n\nDavid Crouse, former President of OPW for 10 years, has been named President of the Dover Fueling Solutions business. “DFS is comprised of the most trusted names in the fueling industry who have been leaders in driving innovation for more than 100 years,” says Crouse. “The company will work alongside OPW, to provide the full spectrum of products and services to our global customers.”\n\nDover Fueling Solutions will be headquartered in Austin, Texas and will have a significant manufacturing presence around the world, including facilities in the USA, the UK, the Netherlands, Sweden, France, India, China, and Brazil.\n\nRelated contents\n\nDiscuss"
