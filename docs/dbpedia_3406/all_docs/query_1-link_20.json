        "text": "“Our management task over the next two years is to turn this ugly duckling into a beautiful swan,” said Mr. George Simpson, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Marconi, in 1999. Marconi was a British industrial conglomerate, formerly known as GEC. The actions taken over the next two years led Britain’s largest industrial firm to the brink of bankruptcy. Danaher Corporation swept in and bought two neglected business units from Marconi, transforming them into market leaders and transforming itself into the premier multi-industry enterprise.\n\nOne of those business units was Gilbarco. If we admire Danaher, understanding Gilbarco helps better understand the company before and after the acquisition. This chapter applies the simple framework in business theory where there are two types of acquisition buyers (strategic and financial) and three types of mergers (horizontal, vertical, and conglomerate) to a real-world example. Comparing Danaher and Marconi’s ownership of Gilbarco is useful for understanding Danaher’s performance against peers and operating philosophy. The story revolving around Gilbarco starts with Danaher’s acquisition of Veeder-Root in 1986. A few topics that are helpful for understanding Danaher overall will be explored: (1) Customer consolidation as a driver of industry consolidation, specifically related to mergers between oil and gas companies; (2) Danaher’s formation by the Rales brothers and early acquisition history; (3) Larry Culp ’s career within Danaher before becoming CEO; and (4) Danaher’s use of bolt-on and adjacency acquisitions, specifically related to its water quality businesses.\n\nThe cast of characters includes six major oil companies, two direct competitors of Gilbarco, six other industrial firms, four financial institutions that peaked in the 1980s, four private equity companies, and two technology companies. This storyline also introduces two concepts vital for comprehending Danaher’s operations: Policy Deployment and kaizen. The contemporary primary chroniclers of these storylines in the English language were the newspapers The Wall Street Journal , Los Angeles Times , The New York Times , and Financial Times , among others, as well as the news agency Reuters and ratings agency Standard & Poor’s (S&P). The language of business in this story is spoken in U.S. dollars ($), British pounds (£), and euros (€).\n\nDanaher reached an agreement to purchase Gilbarco from Marconi for $325m (approximately £225m) on December 20, 2001. In the year ended March 2001, Gilbarco contributed £410m to group revenue and £46m to group operating profit, representing an operating margin of 11.2%. However, in the half-year ended September 2001, Gilbarco contributed £183m to group revenue and £5m to group operating profit, representing an operating margin of only 2.7%. Gilbarco was expected to generate approximately $500m annual revenue. Hence, Danaher gave the company a 0.65 price-to-sales valuation. Danaher’s management planned to combine Gilbarco and Veeder-Root to create “a leading global franchise with outstanding brands uniquely capable of providing a full range of integrated automation and environmental solutions for [Danaher’s] retail petroleum customers.”\n\nConsolidation among the buyers of retail petroleum equipment made consolidation among suppliers a strategic advantage. In the two years before Danaher merged Veeder-Root with Gilbarco, the two entities’ largest customers had merged. Exxon merged with Mobil Oil Company in a deal valued at $82b in 1999, creating the world’s largest oil company. That same year, British Petroleum ( bp ) bought the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) for $26.8b. Chevron bought Texaco for $36b in 2000. Before the mergers, uncertainty around the future branding of and requirements for service station equipment caused purchasing decisions to be delayed. After the mergers, the new entities needed suppliers that could provide a wider array of products at a much larger scale. Veeder-Root was the incumbent provider of fuel monitoring services for 1,425 Exxon-branded stations before the merger. After the merger, 2,125 Mobil-branded stations were added to its service contract. Veeder-Root became the supplier of automatic tank gauging equipment for ExxonMobil worldwide. Since Gilbarco focused on above-ground service station equipment and Veeder-Root focused on below-ground equipment, the merger created a global provider with the broadest product offering in the industry.\n\nUnderstanding Veeder-Root is key to understanding Danaher. Steven and Mitchell Rales established Danaher in 1984 by merging three companies they owned into one. After Danaher’s 1986 acquisition of Western Pacific Industries (WPI, the parent company of Veeder-Root) the Wall Street Journal declared: “Danaher Corp., led by Rales Brothers, is transformed into a conglomerate.”\n\nWhen WPI reported 1985 sales of $167.8m, the company had “about $210m of its liquid assets … in U.S. Treasury bills” in anticipation of “a major long term diversification commitment.” Based on order intake, management believed “manufacturing results in the first half of 1986 will not be markedly different from the last half of 1985.” At the annual meeting of shareholders in May 1986, Chairman Howard A. Newman was quoted saying orders were down compared to the prior year and “We have no reason to feel that any prompt upturn is in sight.”\n\nOn Thursday, September 18, 1986, members of WPI’s management announced they had signed a letter of intent with investment bank Gibbons Green to acquire the company for $360m, or $155 per share. Earlier that month, the Los Angeles Times described Gibbons Green as “a pioneer firm specializing in leveraged buyouts with its founding in 1969.” Leveraged buyouts involve management taking ownership of the company with borrowed money, pledging the firm’s assets as collateral.\n\nChairman Newman was quoted saying: “I really don’t want to devote the next five years of my life to facing a mountain of debt in a highly leveraged company.” Instead, he agreed to sell his 12.3% stake in the company and did not take part in the buyout. The Rales brothers were not the only market participants to value WPI higher than $155 per share. News of the buyout offer sent the stock’s closing price to $158.50 the next day. On Monday, the share price closed at $160. The next day, Danaher made public its proposal to buy the company for at least $165 per share, conditional on reviews of “non-public financial and other information.” The stock price closed at $172.25, valuing the whole company above $400m. The people trading at that level were too optimistic.\n\nThis whole episode started because some members of the management—backed by the premier buyout firm Gibbons Green—thought they could create more value than the incumbent management team. The Rales brothers believed they could do even better than either of them. S&P had its doubts. The rating on Danaher’s subordinated debt, worth $150m, was downgraded from B- to CCC. The implied rating on Danaher’s senior debt was B-. S&P noted: “The recent purchase of Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co. for $200 million and its offer to buy Western Pacific Industries Inc. for $380 million are evidence of Danaher’s financial aggressiveness.”\n\nWPI’s stock price closed at $166.25 on Friday, October 3, 1986, implying market participants believed Danaher would be prompted to slightly increase its initial bid. Instead, Danaher was the only outside suitor to emerge, so the price floor remained at $155 per share. Danaher’s management also learned that demand for WPI’s mechanical counters and mechanical fuel pumps was deteriorating faster than expected, partly due to competing electronic products. The final offer was $163 per share, or $387.1m. Gibbons Green was aware of the $163-per-share offer but chose not to counter. WPI accepted the offer over the weekend. Danaher’s offer price included acquiring $230m worth of cash assets. The adjusted consideration of $157.1m and WPI’s annual revenue of $167.8m gave the company a 0.94 price-to-sales valuation.\n\nGibbons Green had more financial resources than Danaher. If Gibbons Green had matched Danaher’s offer, it likely would have been in a better position to complete the deal. Danaher was dependent on investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert to arrange financing, although it claimed the bank was “highly confident” it could. Thus, WPI’s board of directors might have leaned towards Gibbons Green. However, timing was in Danaher’s favor. A deal had to be completed by December 31, 1986 to avoid the scheduled increase in capital-gains tax rates in 1987. Danaher’s tender offer could be completed by that time, but Gibbons Green’s leveraged buyout might not.\n\nS&P also downgraded WPI’s subordinated debentures, worth $19.7m, from BB- to CCC, citing the combined entity’s level of creditor protection. The ratings agency projected Danaher’s debt-to-capitalization would hit 90%, even after “assuming the firm uses Western Pacific’s $230 million of cash to partially finance the transaction.” Within one year, Danaher sold off three business units of Chicago Pneumatic for $85.5m and refinanced $425m of debt.\n\nGilbarco also changed hands in the late 1980s. Exxon Corporation bought Reliance Electric Company, the parent company of Gilbarco, in 1979 for $1.2b, a venture the New York Times referred to as “one of the major gaffes in [the] industry.” Although Exxon was the largest industrial company by annual sales that year, it lacked manufacturing experience. In 1986, Exxon sold Gilbarco in a management buyout for $160m, financed by Citicorp Capital Investors and Prudential-Bache Securities. The operating unit generated annual revenue of $252m in 1986, so it had a 0.63 price-to-sales valuation. GEC announced the purchase of Gilbarco in July 1987 for $250m. In less than one year, Gilbarco’s price-to-sales valuation increased from 0.63 times to 0.99 times, partly because profits had doubled in the quarter ended March 1987 compared to the prior year. GEC believed Gilbarco “would gain from the application of GEC’s electronics capability to its fuel dispensing, measuring and associated products and services business, and the US company’s distribution network would give GEC the opportunity to expand its sales of related products.”\n\nTwo major changes occurred within Veeder-Root after Danaher acquired the company. First, the firm’s management was re-focused on internal development, such as new product introduction, instead of identifying a major acquisition. Second, Veeder-Root was an early adopter of manufacturing principles developed by Toyota Motor Corporation . Mr. Taiichi Ohno authored the book Toyota Production System (1988). Disciples of Mr. Ohno at Toyota founded a consulting firm called Shingijutsu in 1987. Danaher was their first U.S.-based industrial client, starting at the Jacobs Manufacturing Company in Connecticut the next year. Since Veeder-Root was also based in Connecticut, the two operating companies played a key role in morphing site-level imitation of lean manufacturing principles into the company culture known as the Danaher Business System.\n\nLarry Culp served as Danaher’s CEO from 2001 until 2014. He joined Veeder-Root as a Product Manager in 1990, fresh out of the Harvard Business School . As part of his on-boarding, he was sent to Japan for a week to learn lean principles by working on an air conditioner assembly line. Gilbarco was his first customer. He became president of Veeder-Root in 1993. A 1995 article in National Petroleum News highlighted the types of improvements Veeder-Root was making under his leadership. “Over the past two years, … delivery time for 95% of new equipment has been reduced from six weeks to three days with an almost 100% improvement in turnaround of spares parts and repairs [in Veeder-Root’s Market Harborough, England, facility].”\n\nThe way Veeder-Root approached acquisitions while Mr. Culp was at the helm contributed a few chapters to Danaher’s acquisition playbook. Danaher had three types of acquisitions: Platform-establishing, adjacency, and bolt-on. We can understand Veeder-Root as one of Danaher’s early platform-establishing acquisitions. The Environmental platform was built around Veeder-Root. An example of an adjacency was the 1996 acquisition of American Sigma. Its wastewater sampling products had been used at Veeder-Root. Danaher bought the company, then formed the water quality segment within the Environmental platform around it. Examples of bolt-on acquisitions will be introduced in the next two paragraphs.\n\nA few months before the acquisition of Gilbarco was announced, Veeder-Root completed a bolt-on acquisition that it had targeted for years. In January 2000, Franklin Electric and United Dominion Industries announced a letter of intent “to form a joint venture for the manufacture of submersible gasoline pumping systems and leak detectors” involving Franklin’s FE Petro unit and United Dominion’s Marley Pump business. In May of that year, the U.S. Department of Justice sued in the Federal District Court in Wisconsin to block the merger, claiming the joint venture would allow Franklin to “gain monopoly power in the STP [“submersible turbine pumps”] market, enabling the joint venture to raise prices and reduce quality and service.” The district court noted that Danaher was interested in purchasing Marley’s STP business (also known as “Red Jacket”), but not its water pump business, after Veeder-Root had tried to enter the market but could not find a suitable submersible motor supplier. On August 30, 2000, District Judge Barbara B. Crabb granted a permanent injunction to block the joint venture. When explaining the challenges United Dominion faced in 2000, Glenn A. Eisenberg, president and chief operating officer, said: “Poor results at Marley Pump were exacerbated by our inability to address its operating issues on a timely basis due to an extended dispute with the U.S. Justice Department over its efforts to block a planned joint venture.” SPX Corporation purchased United Dominion in May 2001, then sold Red Jacket to Veeder-Root for $40m on August 27, 2001. The acquisition was expected to add about $30m in annual revenue. Hence, Danaher gave Red Jacket a 1.33 price-to-sales valuation. The event did not even warrant a press release from Danaher.\n\nThe second example of a bolt-on is Gasboy , a unit of Indiana-based Tokheim Corporation. On February 10, 2003, Danaher announced it had successfully bid $38.3m in an auction for the assets of Gasboy. Tokheim had exited bankruptcy in October 2000 with a debt and equity structure that assumed “the depressed United States market in which the Predecessor Company had been operating in recent years would return to prior growth levels.” This assumption did not materialize. By the year ended November 2001, Tokheim’s net sales of $494m generated an operating loss of $19.6m and net income of negative $56.8m. The company’s total assets of $458.1m were worth less than the company’s total liabilities of $478.1m. Less than one year later, Tokheim Corporation’s U.S. subsidiaries “filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for Delaware.” This allowed them “to pursue an orderly sale of its business units, while resolving short-term liquidity issues.” Management had decided “to sell its operations either as a whole or by one or more of its main operating segments: Tokheim North America, Tokheim International and Gasboy.” On November 29, 2002, the private equity firm First Reserve entered into a purchase agreement for the North American assets of Tokheim’s operations for $42m, which valued Gasboy at $30m. Danaher out-bid First Reserve for Gasboy in an auction on February 8, 2003, paying $8.3m more than First Reserve’s initial purchase agreement. First Reserve was the highest bidder for Tokheim’s other North American assets, increasing its offer price to $15m from $12m. Neither company bid for Tokheim’s international operations, so the auction scheduled for February 27, 2003 was cancelled and a previous bid from France-based AXA Private Equity was submitted to the bankruptcy court. Despite successfully selling all the assets of the company, management did not believe “its shareholders will receive any distribution upon confirmation of a plan of reorganization.” Gasboy generated $40m in annual sales, so Danaher gave the company a 0.96 price-to-sales valuation. That multiple was lower than the 1.33 times paid for Red Jacket but higher than the 0.65 times paid for Gilbarco.\n\nDid Marconi get a good price for Gilbarco? If Gilbarco had maintained the price-to-sales valuation of 0.99 that GEC paid in 1987, then Gilbarco would have sold for $495m in 2001. That is $170m higher than the price paid by Danaher. How was Danaher able to acquire the company in 2001 at a valuation only slightly higher than the valuation Gilbarco had in the 1986 leveraged buyout (0.65 and 0.63 times, respectively)? To answer that question, we need to understand Marconi’s situation, as the seller, and those of potential buyers.\n\n“The entire UK banking sector has suffered from concerns that lenders could end up with huge losses on their Marconi loans and that they might have to throw it a lifeline on top of its existing debts,” reported Reuters in September 2001. Marconi’s bonds were trading at 30% of face value in October. Marconi was desperate for cash.\n\nThe new CEO of Marconi, Mike Parton, had negotiated with Philips to sell Marconi’s medical devices unit for £780m and hoped to raise another £500m from selling other assets. Marconi sold its entire stake in French media group Lagardere for €68.8m. It sold 12 U.K. properties for £66.8m and its 21.5% stake in Siemens Telecommunications (of South Africa) for £20m. It traded its optical components business for 9.999% of Bookham Technology’s equity, worth £19.7m. It sold its 50% stake in General Domestic Appliances (GDA), a joint venture with (American) GE, to Merloni of Italy for £121m. It also bought its own bonds with a face value of £152m for only £80m, effectively reducing its debt burden by £72m. All that activity, comparable to rummaging through the sofa at headquarters for spare change, still netted less than the £500m target. Marconi needed to sell one of its larger non-core businesses, like Gilbarco, to get over the target.\n\nThere are two types of buyers in the market for operating companies: Strategic and financial. A strategic buyer “is already an operating company with at least one core business or perhaps several” and “wants to direct its acquisition efforts to strengthen, extend, and build up its existing operations.” A financial buyer “will want to minimize the interrelations of the companies it owns so that each can be refinanced or disposed of without affecting the others.” There are three types of mergers: Horizontal, vertical, and conglomerate. A horizontal merger is between two competitors. A vertical merger is a combination of companies that have a buyer-seller relationship. A conglomerate merger is between companies that have neither relationship in a significant sense.\n\nIn Gilbarco’s case, potential strategic buyers would be: (1) Its largest competitors, Dresser, Inc. and Tokheim, for a horizontal merger; (2) companies selling related products, such as Franklin Electric or Danaher’s Veeder-Root, for a vertical merger; and (3) other industrial conglomerates like GE . The list of potential financial buyers is much longer, but a few that were directly involved with Gilbarco will be listed below.\n\nDresser straddled between a strategic buyer and a financial buyer because of the way it was sold in 2001 by Halliburton . Halliburton considered itself to be “the world’s largest provider of products and services to the petroleum and energy industries,” but no longer believed Dresser fit closely with its “core businesses and long-term goals and objectives.”\n\n“Over a long period of time, we have had a lot of inquiries from businesses in our Dresser properties,” said Guy Marcus, Halliburton vice president for investor relations. “I think we will be able to run a pretty good auction,” said Chairman and Chief Executive (and future Vice President of the United States) Dick Cheney in April 2000. “There is great interest out there.”\n\nBy January 2001, Halliburton reported that “negotiations are in process with a purchaser” and expected to announce a sale of Dresser soon. The business unit generated revenue of $1.4b and operating income of $158m in 2000. The next day, Halliburton announced the sale of 95% of Dresser to First Reserve, Odyssey Investment Partners , and Dresser officials for a total consideration of $1.55b. First Reserve described itself as “a private equity fund manager specializing in the energy industry with over $1.7 billion under management.” Odyssey Investment described itself as “a New-York based partnership with over $700 million under management that makes private equity investments in management buyouts and other corporate transactions primarily within the manufacturing, telecom and financial service industries.”\n\nThe management buyout group gave Dresser a 1.17 price-to-sales valuation. A similar valuation for Gilbarco would have fetched $585m, or $260m more than Danaher paid. Dresser might not have been able to step in and pay a higher price than Danaher because of anti-trust issues caused by merging two large direct competitors.\n\nTokheim was Gilbarco’s other large competitor. It had emerged from bankruptcy in the previous year and was in no position to acquire other companies.\n\nIf acquiring Gilbarco made sense for Veeder-Root, then it also made strategic sense for Franklin Electric, a manufacturer of motors and electronic controls. Franklin Electric generated revenue of $325.7m and an operating margin of 12.3% in 2000. Its annual report declared: “During 2001, the Company intends to continue to seek acquisition candidates that are compatible with its existing product lines and that provide leveraged growth potential.” Franklin Electric generated sales of $59.18 per share in 2000 and its stock traded at a high of $73 that year. That gave the company a reference 1.24 price-to-sales valuation. At that valuation, Gilbarco would have fetched $620m, or $295m more than Danaher paid.\n\nHowever, in the prior three years, Franklin Electric spent less than $17.7m on acquisitions. That is a small amount compared to the $325m Danaher paid for Gilbarco. It is a tiny amount compared to the $1.3b Danaher spent on acquisitions over the same period.\n\nAmong industrial conglomerates, Marconi had the closest relationship with GE. It will be the last potential strategic buyer reviewed before transitioning to financial buyers. GE and Marconi’s 50-50 joint venture in GDA generated sales of £540m in the year ended March 2001. When the Financial Times reported on Marconi’s intent to sell its stake in January 2001, the newspaper estimated Marconi’s stake might be worth between £200m and £300m. GE was not prepared to say if it would make a bid for the entire business. Instead, GE did not stop Merloni from buying Marconi’s stake for only £121m.\n\nWhen the Financial Times reported in April 2001 on Marconi’s intent to sell its medical devices, the newspaper mentioned Philips, Siemens , and GE as interested parties. The business unit generated annual revenue of about £1b and was expected to fetch a 1.8 price-to-sales valuation. Instead, GE let the opportunity pass at a purchase price of only £780m in July 2001. The deal was strategically important to Philips because it was the final major acquisition in its quest to build a $5b medical devices division. In the medical diagnostic imaging segment, Philips was now second only to GE, bumping Siemens to third place.\n\nIn 2010, GE bought Dresser from the private equity group that owned it. Dresser’s annual revenue had increased to $2b by then and GE offered $3b, giving the business a 1.5 price-to-sales valuation. With nine years of hindsight, we know that GE wanted to be in the business of retail petroleum equipment. It also did not mind competing directly against Danaher’s Gilbarco Veeder-Root after nine years as a combined entity. Back in mid-2001, though, GE planned to acquire Honeywell in the largest-ever merger between two industrial companies. Despite being a merger between two American companies, the deal was blocked by the European Union. The GE leadership team’s attention was focused elsewhere, not on acquiring portions of Marconi.\n\nThe potential strategic buyers listed above can be split into three groups. Dresser and Tokheim, as direct competitors, were in the first group. Franklin Electric and Veeder-Root, as manufacturers of related products, were in the second group. Large industrial conglomerates like GE were in the third group. There were also a few potential financial buyers worth mentioning.\n\nThe financial buyer most relevant to Gilbarco was First Reserve. It facilitated the management buyout of Dresser. First Reserve’s stake in Dresser and willingness to consolidate other portfolio investments made it straddle the line between strategic buyer and financial buyer. Dresser’s 1.17 price-to-sales valuation was partly justified by its size being larger than Gilbarco and Tokheim, combined. Dresser had a higher operating margin than Gilbarco, while Tokheim was losing money. Dresser’s valuation likely set a price ceiling on the deal for Gilbarco.\n\nDuke Street Capital, a British private equity firm, had reportedly planned to offer £150m for Gilbarco in October 2001. A spokesperson for Duke Street confirmed its interest in acquiring Gilbarco, but declined to say how much might be offered. That gave Gilbarco a 0.43 price-to-sales valuation. Was that a low valuation? No. AXA Private Equity reportedly bid €144m for Tokheim International, which was not part of Tokheim’s bankruptcy and generated annual revenue of €340m. AXA won the auction in 2003 automatically because no other bids were made, despite the target only having a 0.42 price-to-sales valuation.\n\nFirst Reserve’s stake in Dresser set the price ceiling for a strategic buyer interested in a horizontal merger with Gilbarco. Duke Street’s reported offer set the price floor for a financial buyer interested in Gilbarco. Veeder-Root’s vertical merger with Gilbarco was valued on the lower end of the range but was likely the best offer Marconi could have gotten for the circumstances.\n\nInterestingly, Veeder-Root, Gilbarco, and Gasboy all changed hands in 1986-1987. Danaher acquired Veeder-Root’s parent company. Gilbarco’s management led a leveraged buyout from Exxon. Tokheim acquired William M. Wilson’s Sons, Inc. (the parent company of Gasboy). Danaher united all three in 2002-2003. In his book Competitive Strategy (1980), Professor Michael Porter wrote: “Forces outside the industry are significant primarily in a relative sense; since outside forces usually affect all firms in the industry, the key is found in the differing abilities of firms to deal with them.” Forces in the industry caused sellers of these three companies to exit the market and the buyers to enter in both 1986-1987 and 2002-2003. Danaher had different abilities to deal with the change.\n\n“Our history has always been to operate our companies in a decentralized, autonomous way,” Mr. Steven Rales was quoted as saying in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. “And continuity of management is important and practical.”\n\nWilliam “Bill” Korb was Gilbarco’s president and CEO from 1987 until 2001. The combined Gilbarco Veeder-Root organization was led by Scott Clawson . He had been president of Veeder-Root since 1998. Other Veeder-Root veterans that took on early integration responsibilities were John Dion , Terry Ross , Greg Sears , and Martin Gafinowitz . In an earnings conference call, CEO Culp said:\n\n“We put in one of our outstanding … executives—a ’10-Year Club’ Danaher veteran—as Vice-President of Operations worldwide. … We sent one of our strong product line general managers down there to run the service station equipment business[.] We’ve also put the services business … under a single executive[.] We’ve also inserted a number of [Danaher Business System] managers from different Danaher businesses to help the very good team at Gilbarco move forward. In fact, because of some of the systems opportunities …, we put in a new Chief Information Officer in the business.”\n\nBy mid-April of 2002, the senior leadership team of Gilbarco Veeder-Root completed its Danaher Business System training, including a lesson in Policy Deployment taught by CEO Culp. Policy Deployment is the process Danaher uses to establish 3-5 year breakthrough objectives, convert them into annual goals, determine how to accomplish them, assign ownership, and keep score.\n\nThe Gilbarco organization completed 17 kaizen events within 90 days of the acquisition. A kaizen event at Danaher is a multi-day, small team exercise to define a problem and implement countermeasures. The leader of the kaizen is usually someone with ownership over the functional area to be improved. Another key member of the kaizen team is the facilitator, an expert in a specific Danaher Business System tool from another operating company. The sustainment of each kaizen, which is arguably more important than the act of organizing a kaizen, is tracked at 30-, 60-, and 90-day increments. Gilbarco hosted 41 kaizens in the second quarter of 2002. CEO Culp explained the importance of rapid implementation of kaizens at new acquisitions: “We will certainly get quality, delivery, and cost impact favorability, but we also do that exercise to set a tone: A hands-on, action-oriented tone in new businesses.”\n\nMr. George Koenigsaecker wrote Leading the Lean Enterprise Transformation after a career as a Danaher executive. He explained the importance of getting the kaizen concept rooted into an organization:\n\n“You could count the number of weeklong kaizen event experiences as you would college-degree credit hours. … Typically, about a dozen weeks of this intense application experience is roughly like graduating from kindergarten. … [After about 40 events], you are familiar with most of the Lean tools that are being used inside your business and are competent as a team member to use them. … Somewhere around sixty events, you begin to believe the principles, and you are now able to lead kaizen efforts effectively because you not only know the tools, but also can implement them in a way this is consistent with the principles of Lean.“\n\nSomewhere around 100 event experiences, individuals undergo a personal transformation[.] These folks have seen that applying the tools and following the principles have always led to significant improvement, regardless of the kind of work being studied, and they now know what is possible.”\n\nDanaher got Gilbarco’s operating margin up to high single digits by the third quarter of 2002. Geopolitical uncertainties in the first quarter of 2003 caused Gilbarco’s revenues to decline 15%. By April, CEO Culp believed “the principal uncertainty related to the Iraq War has been effectively digested by our businesses.”\n\nAfter that rocky start, GVR remained a major business of Danaher for more than a decade. In 2016, GVR was spun-off, along with other Danaher legacy businesses, into Fortive . Over most of the time Danaher owned GVR, the operating company reported to a single executive: Martin Gafinowitz.\n\nWhy was Gilbarco more transformational under Danaher than Marconi? GEC, like Danaher, had dozens of manufacturing subsidiaries that reported monthly financial figures to the head office, with an emphasis on cash flow. Arnold Weinstock, GEC’s Managing Director (i.e. CEO), reviewed these reports at the end of each month. GEC was an under-leveraged electronics manufacturer generating annual revenue of £11b in 1996. Half of revenue came from joint ventures. Under new management, led by CEO Simpson, GEC re-organized itself into a newly named and over-leveraged telecommunications company generating annual revenue of £7.0b in 2001. Two-thirds of revenue came from communications businesses. Danaher used acquisitions to complement existing platforms or add a platform, not transform the entire company like Marconi did. Danaher’s acquisition targets were evaluated based on their ability to generate 10% return on invested capital (ROIC) within three years (or five years for platform-establishing acquisitions). Marconi acquired FORE Systems, a U.S.-based supplier of Internet switching equipment, for $4.5b in 1999. That purchase price was almost 7.9 times trailing annual revenue, so achieving ROIC in excess of 10% within five years would have set a new record in the history of commerce. From a market timing perspective, Marconi’s purchase of FORE Systems was less than one year before Cisco ’s market capitalization exceeded Microsoft ’s to become the most valuable listed company in the world. One year after Cisco reached its all-time-high closing price of $80.06, the stock price closed at $18.12, a decline of 77.4%. In short: Marconi overpaid for its largest acquisition.\n\nChanging the direction of a company is sometimes advisable and overpaying for an acquisition can be forgiven. The way Marconi became structured, though, exacerbated the company’s problems. Marconi had three segments: Communications, Systems (which included Gilbarco), and Capital. Unlike the Danaher Business System, which could be applied across industries and talent could be transferred between subsidiaries—especially after an acquisition—the “Marconi Way” was mostly focused on technology-centric businesses. The subsidiaries left over from the GEC days, like Gilbarco, had little to offer to the new favorites, except equity to be extracted or leveraged to overpay for another telecommunications acquisition.\n\nDanaher brought strategic focus back down to the operating company. Talent and business systems were transplanted between existing subsidiaries and the new operating company to integrate it faster. The acquisitions of Gilbarco did not radically change the composition of Danaher. The acquisition price, as a ratio of trailing sales and operating profit, was reasonable. Those were the major differences between Danaher and Marconi’s management of Gilbarco. That is part of the story of how Danaher turned Marconi’s ugly duckling into a beautiful swan.\n\n[This is a draft chapter of a manuscript submitted to Cambridge University Press (CUP).
