I hope the funding that we have announced — along with their own investment — will lead to more opportunities for Tokheim to grow and expand their place in the market, in which they are the leader.”\n\n“Jim Watson, innovation and enterprise services director at Scottish Enterprise, said: “As Scotland’s innovation agency, we want to encourage more innovation in all companies, as it leads directly to commercial products and services.\n\n“It’s even more important for Scotland’s oil and gas sector, as innovation will open up new revenue streams. Earlier this year, we prioritised £10 million to help more oil and gas companies reduce the risk of investing in R&D.\n\n“Tokheim is a great example of how innovation can drive future company growth opportunities, and we wish it every success with its latest R&D project.”\n\nNews category: UK Manufacturing"
