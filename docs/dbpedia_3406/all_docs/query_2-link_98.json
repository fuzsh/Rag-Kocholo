        "text": "Danaher, which owns other retail petroleum companies – including Gilbarco, Veeder-Root and Red Jacket brands – successfully bid on the company during an auction held Feb. 8. The bankruptcy court approved the sale Tuesday.\n\nGasboy President Michael Boone said the sale should not immediately affect employees or production.\n\n“Certainly they‘re a strong company, they own the strongest businesses in the (petroleum) industry,“ Boone said. “We expect to not have any business disruptions in terms of supplying products to our customers.“\n\nOfficials from Danaher were on hand at the Lansdale company Wednesday, meeting with employees and explaining the implications of the sale.\n\nDanaher officials on Wednesday informed employees at the Lansdale site that their benefits, stripped by Tokheim in December to make the company more attractive to potential bidders, will be reinstated as soon as the sale is complete. That is expected to occur in early March, Boone said.\n\nGasboy employees at both the Lansdale and Upper Gwynedd sites have been working without medical benefits since Dec. 15. The company also stripped paid vacation for nonunionized workers as well as its employer-match for employees participating in 401(k) savings plans.\n\nBoone declined to say whether any layoffs are planned, noting the economy and consumer demand dictate the number of employees needed to operate the company.\n\nTokheim Corp., of Fort Wayne, Ind., bought Gasboy in 1986. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Nov. 21 with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. At the time it listed assets of $250 million and debts of $458 million."
