        "text": "HAMILTON, Ohio — OPW, a Dover Co., and a global leader in fluid-handling solutions, has announced that Dover Corp. has completed the acquisition of Tokheim Group S.A.S.’s dispenser and systems businesses and they are now part of OPW.\n\nTokheim is a leading manufacturer of fuel dispensers, retail automation systems and payment solutions. With a presence in Europe, Middle East, Africa, South America and Asia-Pacific, Tokheim is one of the most recognized brands in the retail fueling industry.\n\n“Both Tokheim and OPW have been leaders in the retail fueling industry for more than a century,” said David Crouse, OPW president. “By integrating Tokheim’s advanced line of dispensers and automation systems, the combined business will be able to offer our customers an unparalleled end-to-end fueling solution.”\n\nTokheim is the fifth major acquisition for OPW in the past two-and-a-half years, and matches previous acquisitions (Fibrelite, KPS, Jump, Liquip) of category-leading brands outside the North American market.\n\n“OPW’s goal is to bring the very best solutions to our customers in all regions of the world,” said Keith Moye, OPW vice president of global marketing. “Our combined product portfolio now comprises the industry’s broadest product offering, enabling us to bring a more complete solution to our customers.”\n\nHamilton, Ohio-based OPW’s deployment of this end-to-end solution strategy encourages customers to select and customize a fueling system from OPW’s full line of underground storage tank (UST) equipment, piping and containment systems, and aboveground products–including the newly acquired line of Tokheim dispensers and automation systems–fulfilling almost every equipment need for a fueling station, while using one supplier.\n\nDover, based in Downers Grove, Ill., is a diversified global manufacturer with annual revenues of approximately $7 billion. It delivers equipment and components, specialty systems and support services through four major operating segments: Energy, Engineered Systems, Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment."
