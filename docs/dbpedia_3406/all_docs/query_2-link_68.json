The remaining part of the group, Tokheim Group Services, became a leading service provider and equipment supplier for service stations.\n\nIn September 2016, Tokheim Group Services has been acquired by the board of directors and is now focused on service activities and equipment sales, with an exclusive distributor agreement to sell Tokheim dispensers and systems with Dover.\n\nTokheim Group Services directly owns 28 Sales and Service Divisions across Europe and Africa."
