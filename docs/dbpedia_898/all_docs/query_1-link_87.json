It's located between 5th Street and 23rd Street.\n\nYou can use this Google Maps link for directions.\n\nExplore the Art Deco District with a Guided Tour\n\nThe best way to see what the Magic City has to offer is with a sightseeing tour. There are several great walking tours in Miami.\n\nIf you’d like to explore the area at your own leisure, you might enjoy our free self-guided Art Deco tour below.\n\nWe also have a GPS audio tour of South Beach and the Art Deco District (Listen to a sample).

This is Miami's most iconic street.\n\nCountless movies have been filmed along the pastel-hued, art-deco lined streets that burst with colorful night lights, fancy cars, sunshine, and palm trees.\n\nWhat was once a swampland filled with mangroves in 1913, this area has been completely transformed.\n\nBeginning at 1st street and extending up to 15th, you'll find an endless array of restaurants, bars, clubs, shopping, and, of course, some of the best people-watching in the world.\n\n2) Get Your Shopping Fix In on Lincoln Road\n\nFulfill your inner shop-a-holic at the Lincoln Road Mall, which is a pedestrian lined street just a few blocks from the Art Deco District.\n\nYou'll find 23 different stores such as ZARA, Gap, Anthropologie, Forever 21, NIKE, Athleta and many more.\n\n50+ restaurants are scattered all throughout and around, offering just about any cuisine that you could imagine.\n\nMost stores are open daily from 10 am – 11 pm.\n\nCheck out our section below for other areas in South Beach to shop!\n\n3) Walk the Pier at South Pointe Park\n\nThe southernmost point of South Beach offers up a more relaxed and quiet waterfront area compared to the hustle and bustle near Lummus Park on Ocean Drive.\n\nWhat was once home to police horse stables, South Pointe Park was donated by the Federal Government to Miami Beach in 1979.\n\nHave a picnic at the park, watch the water traffic enter and leave the Port of Miami and marinas, or simply enjoy the spectacular beach.\n\nThere’s even a playground which includes a water fountain and a dog park.\n\nTake a walk on the 450-foot-long pier, which underwent a $4.8 million renovation in 2014.\n\nThe pier offers up views of the city and marina, along with South Beach and the beautiful blue Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe best news is, visiting the park is completely free! Check our list of free things to do in Miami for even more fun that won’t cost you a dime.\n\n4) Take a Sightseeing Tour\n\nSouth Beach is an Art Deco Playground. In fact, it’s the largest collection of Art Deco architecture in the world.\n\nEven if you’re not into architecture, anyone will enjoy perusing these streets lined with pastel buildings.\n\nInterestingly, all of these structures were constructed between 1923 and 1943 and literally resurrected South Beach from a major decline.\n\nSurprisingly, South Beach wasn’t always this glamorous and posh. It once was polluted with high crime and vacant buildings.\n\nIt wasn’t until the 1980s and 1990s when movies like Scarface (1983) and the Birdcage (1996) transformed it into the world-class travel destination that it is today.\n\nJoin a guided tour or venture out on your own with our self-guided tour through the Art Deco District listed below!\n\n5) Soak in the Sun on South Beach\n\nWith 825 miles (1,328km) of sandy coastline in the sunshine state of Florida, it’s almost a crime if you come to Miami and don’t go to the beach!\n\nSouth Beach, AKA SoBe, is a picture-perfect 4-mile (6.4km) strip of coastline and is one of the most famous beaches in the world.\n\nIt surely cannot be missed, especially because it’s free! So, pack up a cooler and hit the sand!\n\nIf you want to see all the action on the beach, it’s best to start your journey on Ocean Drive near Lummus Park.\n\n6) Stay or Eat at the Former Versace Mansion\n\nWhat is the second most photographed residence in the USA (the White House is #1), the Villa Casa Casuarina, formerly known as the Versace Mansion is located right on Ocean Drive just steps away from the beach.\n\nThe Villa was constructed in 1930 by the architect Alden Freeman, who was the heir to the Standard Oil fortune. The mansion was purchased in 1992 by Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace.\n\nToday, the Villa operates as a luxury boutique hotel and event venue.\n\nThis hotel also houses a well-known restaurant, Gianni's At The Former, which offers a blend of Italian and Mediterranean cuisines.\n\nWhile dining, enjoy being surrounded by the the beautiful ornate dining room or outside near the famous pool.\n\n7) Explore Miami on Two Wheels\n\nThe most unique, up-close-and-personal way to see the city of Miami is via bicycle and the Citi Bike Program makes it easy for everyone to enjoy it!\n\nCiti Bike is Miami’s bike-sharing rental system.\n\nThe bikes are super durable, kept in great condition and even come with a basket on the front to put your personal items in.\n\nThere are over 1,000 bikes at 100 different stations spread across the greater Miami area, so you’ll always have a place to dock your bike, no matter what destination you have in mind.\n\nThey also have a very friendly mobile app for Apple and Android users, which makes finding a station near your location virtually seamless.\n\nBike rentals cost $6.50 for one hour or $10 for 2 hours; a much cheaper alternative than a taxi, Uber or paid tour!\n\n8) Dine at the Iconic Joe's Stone Crab\n\nIf there ever were a restaurant iconic of South Beach, Joe's Stone Crab would be it.\n\nOpened in 1913 by Joe Weis, who had moved to Florida because his Doctors told him he had to move to warmer weather to help his asthma, this famous restaurant is bursting with delicious food, in a comfortable atmosphere.\n\nWhile you should obviously eat their Stone Crab, you'll also enjoy their fried chicken or grilled tomatoes.\n\nDo note that they do not take reservations, so it's best to go before or after peak times.\n\n9) Explore the Latest Contemporary Art at the Bass Museum\n\nThe Bass Museum, although small, has established itself as one of the leading Museums for contemporary art in the city.\n\nOpened in 1964 by John and Johanna Bass and housed inside an Art Deco building, The Bass offers exhibitions by Ugo Rondinone, Mika Rottenberg, Isaac Julien, and many more talented artists.\n\nWhile The Bass is an especially popular museum during Miami's Art Basel week, it draws a large crowd of tourists and locals alike year-round, with their ever-changing exhibitions.\n\n10) Dance the Night Away at Story Nightclub\n\nWhat is owned by the same owners as LIV nightclub, Story is a 27,000-square-foot club with 60+ VIP tables.\n\nThe most iconic DJs and artists have performed here over the years, from Drake to Justin Bieber to the Miami Heat celebrating the team's NBA championship inside its walls.\n\nRESTAURANTS\n\nBelow is a long list of excellent dining options for any budget.\n\nCheap (under $20)\n\nLa Sandwicherie - 229 14th St\n\nGrab one of their iconic delicious sandwiches on fresh French Bread, a smoothie, burgers, burritos and so much more!\n\nBe sure to get your food to go, as there isn't exactly a lot of sitting space, especially during peak hours.\n\nPuerto Sagua - 700 Collins Ave\n\nThis classic South Beach restaurant offers traditional Cuban food at an incredibly affordable price.\n\nGrab a Cuban sandwich, chow down on some oxtail soup, or enjoy some fried plantains.

Art Deco Welcome Center\n\n1001 Ocean Drive at 10th Street\n\nAny good tour of Miami’s Art Deco District should start at the Art Deco Welcome Center located near Lummus Park.\n\nThis is the home of the Miami Design Preservation League (MDPL), which was instrumental in saving a lot of the buildings that you will be seeing on this excursion.\n\nAt the Welcome Center, you’ll have the opportunity to learn a lot about many of the sites on this walking tour before you head out.\n\nMDPL also provides its own guided and self-guided tours of the area, but you are not required to take them.\n\n2. Lummus Park\n\nOcean Drive from 5th St. to 15th St.\n\nThis park runs alongside Ocean Drive for most of the length of our entire tour, so why not take a stroll beneath the palm trees?\n\nAs you head south through Lummus Park to your next destination, look to your left for a glorious view of Miami Beach.\n\nTo your right, you’ll see the beautiful Art Deco skyline of South Beach represented in a variety of businesses and uniquely designed buildings.\n\nOnce you reach 7th Street, keep an eye out for the next stop on our self-guided walking tour.\n\n3. CelinoHotel (formally Park Central)\n\n640 Ocean Drive\n\nAs of when this was written in 2019, the Celino Hotel had just opened on this site after a $110 million renovation.\n\nThe Celino takes several buildings that were previously separate businesses – the main building used to be the Park Central Hotel – and combines them all into a luxury hotel complex.\n\nThe renovation takes the interior pretty far off from Art Deco in terms of the exact look, but it sticks to the spirit: Art Deco comes from a time of enthusiastic excess, and what better way to say that in 2019 than a glass-bottomed rooftop pool.\n\nIf you’re curious to see the inside, their bar is a particular point of pride – check out the chandelier if you go in.\n\nThis building was constructed in 1937, and in fact, most of the existing Art Deco structures in Miami Beach were built in the 1930s.\n\nThe 30s brought the Great Depression to the United States and put the optimism and the consumption of the 20s firmly behind us.\n\n4. The Hotel of South Beach\n\n801 Collins Avenue\n\nDespite the fairly unassuming name, you probably won’t have too much trouble finding this historic hotel.\n\nAll you have to do is look up at the neon spire which reads “Tiffany” in order to locate The Hotel of South Beach.\n\nThis beautifully restored hotel was originally designed by L. Murray Dixon and built in 1939.\n\nThe hotel was previously named The Tiffany, and it wasn’t until the late 1990s when fashion designer Todd Oldham stepped in that the name was changed to reflect a more modern appeal.\n\nAlthough this building has been modernized in many ways, architects and designers elected to keep the Tiffany sign and it is still used to this day.\n\nWhen you’re done checking out The Hotel of South Beach, keep heading north on Collins Avenue for two blocks.\n\nAs you walk down the avenue, you’ll notice quite a bit of unique architecture from various eras on either side of the street.\n\nAt the corner of 10th and Collins, you will find our next stop on this self-guided walking tour of the Miami Art Deco District.\n\n5. Essex House\n\n1001 Collins Avenue\n\nHenry Hohauser was in high demand during the late 1930s, having designed a number of hotels in Miami Beach.\n\nEssex House, built in 1938, is a unique design that resembles a cruise ship heading into the ocean.\n\nIn Miami, the Art Deco movement wasn’t just about bold and rich colors, it was also about taking chances on various architectural designs.\n\nWhat better way to stand out than by building a hotel that looks like an ocean liner?\n\nAs you walk east down 10th street, continue to enjoy the design of Essex House while you move in the direction of the Art Deco Welcome Center on Ocean Drive.\n\nWhen you arrive once again at the Welcome Center, walk north on Ocean Drive to continue this self-guided walking tour of Miami’s Art Deco district.\n\n6. The Clevelander\n\n1020 Ocean Drive\n\nLocated right across the street from the Art Deco Welcome Center, this beauty was built in 1938 by Albert Anis and features a stylish patio bar.\n\nFeel free to stop by and get a drink, or just take in the view of this creative hotel.\n\nRenovated and restored in 2009, the Clevelander serves as an excellent counterpoint to Essex House.\n\nThere’s always something happening at this beautiful and historic hotel in the heart of Miami’s Art Deco district.\n\nContinue walking north on Ocean Drive and take in the sights of the Congress Hotel as you make your way to our next destination.\n\nAs you pass 11th street, look to your left and take note of a building hidden away by several palm trees to locate the next stop on this walking tour.\n\n7. The Villa Casa Casuarina\n\n1116 Ocean Drive\n\nWe’ve seen quite a few hotels on this tour so far, but none of them look anything like the Casa Casuarina.\n\nThe original owner and designer, Alden Freeman, was inspired to build the mansion in 1930 after visiting Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.\n\nWhile he was there, Freeman saw the Alcazar De Colon which was built during the early 16th century by Diego Columbus (Christopher Columbus’s Son).\n\nIt is known for being the oldest residence in the western hemisphere.\n\nFreeman was so moved by this structure that he obtained one of the bricks from the Alcazar De Colon and used it in the construction of the Casa Casuarina.\n\nWhen clothes designer Gianni Versace bought the mansion in 1992, he decided to expand it by demolishing another historic hotel located next door.\n\nAlthough this wasn’t looked upon favorably by the MDPL, there was little they could do to stop it from happening.\n\nWhen it was purchased by Barton G. Weiss in 2009, he decided to rename the property The Villa.\n\nLegend has it that the mansion was originally named after the last tree that remained on the lot where it was built after a hurricane that hit Miami in 1926.\n\nFreeman was forced to cut that tree down, and it is said that he named the mansion in its honor.\n\nThe name of the tree was the Casuarina equisetifolia, which is more commonly described as the Australian Pine Tree.\n\nLet’s continue our self-guided walking tour by moving north on Ocean Drive toward 12th street.\n\nAs you move past the Sugar Factory and the Palace Bar, you’ll discover our next stop.\n\n8. The Tides Hotel\n\n1220 Ocean Drive\n\nBy now, you’ve probably noticed that the Art Deco district is peppered with dozens of uniquely designed buildings that tend to stand out from one another.\n\nThe Tides is no exception, as the pinkish hue and porthole windows make it easy to spot.\n\nThe Tides was designed and built by L. Murray Dixon in 1936, just a few years before he worked on The Tiffany.\n\nThis was the first Art Deco hotel he built in South Beach, and at the time it was the tallest building in the area.\n\nThe Tides was renovated in 1997 and continues operating to this day.\n\nDescribed as “The Diva of Ocean Drive,” it’s fair to say that this location exudes an attitude that you won’t find at many of the sights on this tour.\n\nOur next stop on this self-guided walking tour is located right next door.\n\nNorth of The Tides, you will find yet another hotel with a distinctive appearance that can’t be mistaken.\n\n9. The Leslie\n\n1244 Ocean Drive\n\nIf the yellow paint job isn’t enough to catch your attention, the surrounding palm trees and wonderful Art Deco architecture should do the trick.\n\nBuilt and designed by Albert Anis in 1937, this building combines the best of both the modern world and the Art Deco world.\n\nWhile the modern architecture was typically very linear, Art Deco was much more bold and brave.\n\nYou can definitely see the combination of these two art styles when you take a look at The Leslie.\n\nAlthough there are straight lines everywhere, they are painted in yellow and much more ornamental in design.\n\nRenovated in 2014, this is one of the newer restorations on Ocean Drive.\n\nAs we continue walking north, you’ll discover our next stop located right next door to The Leslie.\n\n10. Carlyle Hotel\n\n1250 Ocean Drive\n\nIf you feel as though you have seen this building before, you might not be wrong.\n\nThe Carlyle has been featured in several notable Hollywood films including Scarface, Bad Boys 2, and The Birdcage.\n\nThis is one of the most easily recognizable hotels in all of South Beach and it’s not hard to see why.\n\nLike The Leslie, the design of The Carlyle combines modern architecture with rounded edges and a stand-out paint scheme that is hard to miss.\n\nBuilt in 1939, The Carlyle maintains the same architectural style that defined its earlier days in Miami Beach.\n\nWhen you’ve finished taking in the sights and sounds of this memorable locale, continue walking north on Ocean Drive.\n\nOnce you pass 13th street, look left and take note of our next stop.\n\n11. Cardozo Hotel\n\n1300 Ocean Drive\n\nLike The Carlyle, The Cardozo may also look familiar, having appeared in Hollywood blockbusters Any Given Sunday and There’s Something About Mary.\n\nBuilt in 1939 by Henry Hohauser and now owned by Gloria Estefan and her husband Emilio, this hotel is another fine example of a combination of modern architecture and more artistic fare.\n\nRounded edges combine with the straight lines of the windows creating a design that is unmistakably Art Deco in nature.\n\nContinue your trip down Ocean Drive by stopping at the hotel right next door and discovering yet another unique architectural design in the heart of South Beach.\n\n12. The Cavalier\n\n1320 Ocean Drive\n\nJust a few steps from The Cardozo Hotel, you will find a building that looks strikingly different from most of the locations you have visited on this walking tour.\n\nWhile many of the Art Deco buildings in Miami Beach focus on horizontal lines, The Cavalier bucks this trend by going for a more vertical style.\n\nWith stucco friezes directing your eyes upward, this Caribbean inspired architectural design is sure to leave an impression.\n\nThe hotel was built in 1936 and was recently renovated in 2015.\n\nMuch like The Carlyle and The Cardozo, The Cavalier has also been a popular destination for filmmakers.\n\nFrom this point, you will want to continue walking north on Ocean Drive until you reach 14th street. At the corner, you’ll discover the next stop on the tour.\n\n13. The Winter Haven\n\n1400 Ocean Drive\n\nWith a name like this, the intended audience is pretty clear.\n\nBy the time this location was built in 1939, 'snowbirds' were making their way down to South Beach every winter, and Art Deco hotels were popping up all over Ocean Drive to accommodate their needs.\n\nLike The Leslie, The Winter Haven was originally designed by Albert Anis.\n\nTake note of the awning style, which is very similar to the design we saw back at The Leslie.\n\nInside, the details of this beautiful hotel have been restored using period-accurate materials, ensuring that the original flavor of The Winter Haven remains intact for an entirely new generation of visitors.\n\nContinue walking west on 14th street until you reach Collins Avenue. Once on Collins, walk north until you reach Española Way.\n\nThe next destination on this self-guided walking tour will be right on the corner -- you cannot miss it!\n\n14. Site of the former Hoffman’s Cafeteria\n\n1450 Collins Avenue\n\nDepending on when you visit, this location might have an entirely new tenant.\n\nAs of writing this tour, the current restaurant located in the building is Señor Frogs, but they are only one of many restaurants that have made this historical Art Deco structure their home.\n\nBack in 1940, this was known as Hoffman’s Cafeteria, and it was designed by none other than Henry Hohauser.\n\nDespite the change in the paint job, the architecture of this beautiful location still manages to stand out from the crowd.\n\nEventually, other businesses moved in and set up shop, including the Warsaw Ballroom and Jerry’s Famous Deli.\n\nWhen Jerry’s moved in, they refurbished the building a bit, using pictures from decades past to recreate original Art Deco concepts that had fallen into disrepair.\n\nWhy not stop in and grab a bite to eat if you’re hungry.\n\nOnce you’re ready, head north on Collins Avenue until you reach 16th street, at which point you will see one of the largest buildings in the area.\n\n15. Loews Hotel\n\n1601 Collins Avenue\n\nAlthough it may not seem like this monolith has anything to do with the Art Deco era of the ’30s and ’40s, it actually houses one of the more notable hotels in the history of South Beach.\n\nLocated on the right side of the Loew’s Hotel, you will also see the St. Moritz Hotel, which was restored by Loews and is still in use today.\n\nThe St. Moritz has been in Miami Beach since 1939 when it was designed and built by Roy France.\n\nThe St. Moritz continues to serve as an excellent example of Art Deco architecture and its ties to Miami, as even developers are keen to keep history alive by restoring and renovating classic hotels.\n\nOur next few sites are just past Lincoln road as you continue north on Collins Avenue. All three are right next to each other, so it shouldn’t be too hard to find them.\n\n16. Sagamore Hotel\n\n1671 Collins Avenue\n\nAs you come across this collection of Art Deco hotels on your right, the first you will notice is The Sagamore.\n\nThe history of The Sagamore Hotel in South Beach is emblematic of the cultural importance represented in Miami’s Art Deco district.\n\nHaving been built in 1948 by Albert Anis, the style of this particular hotel is definitely different from others that you will see on Collins Avenue.\n\nYou will see many more straight lines on display, as well as the characteristic Art Deco awnings that have no doubt become quite familiar at this point.\n\nDespite the hint of modern design, the architecture is definitely postmodern in concept, subverting expectations by extending its lines beyond the standard cubic structure of most modern hotels.\n\nIn 1999, The Sagamore was purchased by Martin Taplin and partially converted into a museum of sorts.\n\nAlthough it still serves as a hotel, you will now also find an art gallery inside the halls of this beautiful and historic landmark.\n\nThe next stop on our walking tour is right next door.\n\n17. National Hotel\n\n1677 Collins Avenue\n\nWith its bold color choices that draw your eyes upwards, it’s hard to deny the beauty of The National Hotel.\n\nAt around the same time that he was working on The St. Moritz, Roy France also began working on The National.\n\nWhile there are some similarities between these two landmarks, there are also a lot of notable differences.\n\nThe hotel originally opened in 1940 and was later restored to its former glory in 1997.\n\nYou’ll even find a lot of the original furnishings scattered around the inside of this building, as many of them have been updated and restored along with the hotel itself.\n\nYou won’t have to walk far to reach our next location on this walking tour of Miami’s Art Deco district – it’s right next door!\n\n18. Delano\n\n1685 Collins Avenue\n\nWhen it was built in 1947, the Delano was actually the tallest building in Miami Beach.\n\nWhen you look at it right next to The National, it doesn’t appear to be much taller, but these things used to be fairly important to developers back in the day.\n\nDesigned by Robert Swartberg in the mid-’40s, the hotel was one of the first in the area to be built after World War II and was used as military housing for a short time before its doors were opened to guests.\n\nThe hotel was named in honor of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt who died in 1945.\n\nWith such a unique design, it’s no wonder that The Delano was listed among 2007's \"America’s Favorite Architecture\" list published by the American Institute of Architects.\n\nThe design of this building takes the modern approaches of old and twists them out of place.\n\nThe building was renovated and restored in 1994 under the direction of world-renown architect Philippe Starck hoping to attract a new generation of chic hotel guests.\n\nThe Delano succeeded and is now one of the hottest hotels in Miami, with celebrity guests like Kim Kardashian, Jay-Z, and Leo DiCaprio.\n\n19. The End\n\nHaving just toured almost 10 blocks along both Ocean Avenue and Collins Avenue, it’s about time to wrap up this tour.\n\nIf you’re not tired, we recommend heading over to Lincoln Road for some shopping at their historic open-air mall.\n\nOf course, you can take a bus tour or boat tour, so be sure to check out our posts about which tours are the best.\n\nHOTELS\n\nPlease note that the prices of hotels vary by season and events taking place in the city.\n\nInexpensive (under $200 a night)\n\nUnfortunately, it’s slim pickings when it comes to inexpensive hotels in South Beach. You might find better rates at an Airbnb. Here are a few hotels under $200 a night still around.\n\nThe Clevelander 1020 Ocean Drive.
