        "text": "According to Love County Sheriff's Department, a hole found on I-35 is expected to cause significant delays to traffic traveling southbound to Texas.\n\nDrivers have already experienced delays as the lanes have been downsized to one lane and significant back-ups have kept people waiting up to 35 minutes. Love County law enforcement advises drivers to avoid the area altogether. \"If you have plans to travel south on i35 seek an alternate route or plan for significant delays,\" Sheriff Cumberledge said Sunday evening.\n\nAccording to KXII, drivers can consider \"the Willis Bridge in Madill, the bridge on Highway 89 in Courtney, or the Red River Bridge on US 69/75 in Bryan County.\" Drivers should be aware that, if you decide to take Bryan County Bridge, the highway will eventually merge into one-lane traffic near Calera. It is also important to note that certain roads will not help, such as Taking Exit 1.\n\nAs for when people can expect to see some repairs and the roads opening back to two lanes, there are no for sure answers at the moment, at least not from the Love County Sheriff's Department. \"This one is out of our hands,\" Cumberledge said. Since the hole is on the highway, the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, or ODOT, is responsible for the repairs.\n\nInterestingly enough, it seems as though I-35 near Thackerville had already been drawing ODOT's attention when they implemented the eight-year construction plan in 2023. They noted some of the important projects that the plan was focused on repairing, and wouldn't you know, this stretch of road was noted as:\n\nIn South Central Oklahoma, planning for improvements along I-35 between Marietta in Love County and Springer in Carter County, as well as an I-35 bridge reconstruction at Thackerville in Love County.\n\nIt seems as though the state may have seen this one coming but just didn't get to the repairs soon enough. According to the plan, though, construction was supposed to begin in May of this year (page 18).\n\nHopefully ODOT can utilize the more than $19 million dedicated to renovating this stretch of road to make the repairs quickly. How do you think Oklahoma's Department of Transportation should address the issue? Tell us your thoughts through our app."
