        "text": "UPDATE MARCH 11, 2024\n\nThe “Old River Bridge” is returning. The Saline County Judge’s Office held a groundbreaking on March 11th, 2024 to marking the beginning of the installation of the restored bridge. Once the installation is complete, the bridge will be the oldest in Arkansas in its original location.\n\nThis bridge is a big part of the history of Saline County. It supported traffic by horse and carriage, and more modern vehicles for nearly 80 years until an incident made it no longer possible. The Old River Bridge is also known for its appearance in the 1996 film “Sling Blade” starring Billy Bob Thornton.\n\nConstructed in 1891 for a price of $5,000.00 this bridge allowed the first settlers of Saline County a safe passage over the Saline River. In 1974, a truck carrying concrete blocks severely damaged the bridge to the point of local officials decommissioning it.\n\nREAD MORE BELOW ?\n\nAround 2004, late former Benton Mayor, Lynn Moore expressed a vision to restore the bridge and incorporate it into a bike/pedestrian pathway. The citizens of Saline County came together to make Mayor Moore’s vision a reality. Many locals worked together to clean and improve an area on the Benton side of the bridge. It’s now called Saline Crossing Park, in tribute to its early days of use by settlers. The group formed a non-profit organization called Saline Crossing, to continue the improvement and maintenance of the park.\n\nThe following three pictures ?are the dismantling of the Old River Bridge, for the purpose of restoration. ?The images are from May 12, 2018, courtesy of Marsha Guffey.\n\nMeanwhile, government agencies were working together to fix up the bridge itself. Using funding from TAP grants through the Arkansas Department of Transportation, the County was able to dismantle the structure.\n\nIn May 2018 it was taken to the Saline County Road Department. In 2021, the County sent it to Michigan for restoration. The iron was mostly refurbished, but it was also recast in areas. In 2022, it was shipped back to the Saline County Road Department. There, the contractors laid out the pieces of the bridge to prepare it for it’s final trip – back to the Saline River.\n\nOn Monday, March 11, 2024, the County held a groundbreaking ceremony for the bridge’s return. The goal is for it to be installed and ready for pedestrian traffic by Spring 2025. Speakers at the Groundbreaking Ceremony include Brad Moore, son of the late Lynn Moore; former County Judge Jeff Arey; and current County Judge Matt Brumley.\n\nThe bridge will serve as a connector between the cities of Haskell and Benton in the Southwest Trail. The Southwest Trail is a 60-mile biking and walking trail that will eventually stretch from Hot Springs in Garland County, through Saline County, and on to Little Rock in Pulaski County.\n\nFind more historical information on the bridge at https://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/old-river-bridge-12175/"
