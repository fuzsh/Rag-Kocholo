        "text": "Preservation Oklahoma released its\n\nPOK released this list to promote these places and raise awareness of their historical significance in Oklahoma. They receive public nominations for these places every year in October.\n\nIt should be noted that inclusion on the list does not guarantee protection or funding for these locations. However, the recognition could help restoration efforts.\n\nThe following is a mixture of commercial, religious, and educational sites.\n\n11th Street Bridge, Tulsa:Now known as the Cyrus Avery Route 66 Memorial Bridge. It was built in 1917 and was the first concrete and steel-reinforced bridge to cross the Arkansas River in the United States.\n\nPOK believes giving the bridge a new life could expand tourism opportunities in Tulsa and ways for pedestrians and cyclists to cross the river.\n\nQuanah Parker's Star House, Cache: Citizens have reportedly nominated this house six times. The site is extremely difficult to access and was built in 1890 for Quanah Parker and his family.\n\nPOK says thanks to an EIN number issued in 2022, the site is expected to eventually be a living museum and educational center that honors Quanah and the Comanche.\n\nIsaiah 53 Church, Tulsa: Seen in south Tulsa, the church used to be an all-black, small farming community. The last member of that community died in 1983.\n\nThe property is currently up for sale, and residents are concerned that whoever buys it will erase its history.\n\nLarkin Hotel, Blackwell: This hotel last appeared on this list in 2012 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.\n\nIt was built in 1923 by John Larkin and designed by JM Fuller, It stands four stories tall with 66 rooms.\n\nIt was the first modern hotel in Blackwell.\n\nL'Ouverture School, McAlester: This 20th Century school had African-American students starting in 1908. In 1968, the students were integrated with McAlester High School students.\n\nPlans to reserve the building for future generations are in motion. Graduates f the class of 1965 bought the building in 2014 and are working to establish a nonprofit center there.\n\nBridge No. 18 at Rock Creek, Sapulpa: The bridge was made in 1924 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.\n\nThis bridge originally served the Ozark Trail and was bypassed by Route 66 in 1952.\n\nThere are plans from the City of Sapulpa to turn the area into a park, in which the bridge will be the center.\n\nBryant Center, Oklahoma City: This made POK's 2022 list and used to be a hub for Okla. City's most prominent Black community. The site is now used as a dumping ground.\n\nSt. Joseph's Rectory, Krebs: It was built in 1905 and was the hub of the parish complex and home for the parish priest.\n\nNow, the site needs major fundraising and restoration work, but the parish hopes to apply for a National Fund for Sacred Places grant.\n\nJewel Theatre, Oklahoma City: Made in 1931, the theater served as a safe haven for Black people during the Jim Crow era.\n\nIt closed its doors in the late 1970s. It is currently owned by Arthur Hurst who has promised the original owner owner that the site will be restored.\n\nSkyride, Tulsa: Made in 1965, the ride was one of the ten remaining Von Roll sky rides in the USA. It is currently being demolished, despite public outcry.\n\nPeter Conser House, Heavener: Built in 1894, the home was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.\n\nIt features a family cemetery with graves dating as far back as 1879.\n\nPeter Conser was the captain of the Lighthorse, a representative to the Choctaw Council, and a senator to the Choctaw Council. The home used to be a museum before the Cosner family resumed ownership of it. However, the home has been severely neglected and many worry the unattended grave sites may face danger.\n\nCapitol Hill High School, Oklahoma City: The 1928 building recently got a bond issue for Oklahoma City Public Schools, and POK worries the building will be damaged to make room for a new structure.\n\nPOK will have a on July 13, 2023, that is free to members and $25 for nonmembers."
