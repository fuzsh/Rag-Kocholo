        "text": "Historical Notes\n\nWilshire Boulevard was designated by The Octagon Museum of the American Architectural Foundation as one of the 'Grand American Avenues'. For nearly a half a century it was decorated with the Wilshire Special pole and lantern along nearly six miles of its length.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe idea of a specialized electrolier for a business district was particularly popular in the late 1920s.Â The best known was the Wilshire Special, installed in 1928 along Wilshire Boulevard from Park View to Fairfax.Â In the 1930s these ornate electroliers were also installed on the remaining sections of Wilshire all the way to downtown. Other upscale commercial districts, such as Westwood Village, followed suit with their own special types.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nAs of 2008, approximately 100 \"Wilshire Specials\" still remain over the distance of about one-and-a-half miles along Wilshire Boulevard. The original lanterns are solid bronze and stand 7Â½ feet tall from the base of the lantern to the top of the finial.^^\n\nClick HERE to see contemporary views.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nAfter being sold in 1975 and renovated, the Brown Derby Restaurant was finally replaced in 1980 by a shopping center known as the Brown Derby Plaza. The domed structure was incorporated into the third floor of the building and accommodates a cafe. A Korean mini-mall occupies the site today.\n\nThe Brown Derby chain included restaurants in Hollywood, Beverly Hills, and the Los Feliz area. The Los Feliz Brown Derby at 4500 Los Feliz Blvd is the last remaining branch of the chain still extant and in operation.^*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIf still standing today, the view from the porch of these buildings would be that of Disney Hall, located directly across the street, on the other side of Grand Ave. Click HERE to see more in Early LA Historic Buildings (1800s).\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe above street light is a Union Metal UM-1747 \"Pacific\" model with GE Form 18-B lanterns. They were found all over Bunker Hill until the neighborhood was bulldozed into oblivion. Only one Bunker Hill example survives as of 2021. It's on the East side of Olive Street, just South of 4th Street.\n\nClick HERE to see more 'Pacific' UM 1747 dual-lamp streetlights (Contemporary Views)\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe LAPD installed call boxes in 1903. Before that, officers had to go to headquarters on foot with a message, or headquarters had to send a runner to find them. Call boxes let officers check in at intervals, using a key to unlock the box. Laterâprobably in the Thirtiesâdial telephones replaced the direct lines. And much later, walkie-talkies made call boxes obsolete.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nBoth high voltage and low voltage time switches were installed in the early part of the 1900s by the Bureau of Power and Light.Â These were used to control streetlight electrolier circuits through the city. Some of these still exist today.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe keystone Iron Steelwork Company from Los Angeles (1917-1928) made fire alarm/police call boxes, streetlight time switches, and fire hydrants. Some streetlight time switches are still in service while others are not but remain for historical value throughout the city.\n\nMore detailed information can be found on these time switches in a 1947 DWP Streetlight Manual (Page 24).\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe most common of the incandescent multiple globe electroliers of the early 1900s were those manufactured by the Llewellyn Iron Works of Los Angeles.Â The firm became so identified with this style of street light that any multiple globe electrolier became commonly known as a Llewellyn.Â The Llewellyn Iron Works, founded in 1889â1890, was one of the largest metal working facilities in Los Angeles.Â It manufactured structural steel â including that for the Bradbury Building.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nWithin two years of the above photo, the entire hill, including the tunnels, would be leveled as part of the Bunker Hill Redevelopment Project.\n\nThere are no 5-bulb Winslow Eletroliers left today.Â The model is extinct.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe twin street lights along Melrose were the Marbelite 1900 model, distinguished by its squarish base. The Melrose lights were removed around 1950, but there are a few survivors fairly close by.Â Wilshire Boulevard on the west side also had similar streetlights in the 1930s.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Bell & Howell Building, located at 716 N. La Brea Ave in Los Angeles, is a distinguished example of Art Deco architecture. Constructed in 1928 to serve as the West Coast operations center for the Bell & Howell camera equipment company, it was designed by the architectural firm Edelman & Barnett. The building features classic Art Deco elements, including terra cotta ornamentation, geometric patterns, and vertical emphasis. The main structure is four stories tall, crafted from reinforced concrete, with a tall tower at the center, whose exact height remains unspecified, adding an element of intrigue to its architectural profile.\n\nClick HERE to see more on the Bell & Howell Building.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe “California Special” was designed by Westinghouse, but produced locally by Llewellyn Iron Works.Â Chris Burden dubbed these \"The Magnolia Double\" for his Urban Light sculpture down on Wilshire Blvd.\n\nToday, there are still plenty of these to be found on the Magnolia Boulevard between Lankershim and Cahuenga.Â They were previously found in Leimert Park. Single lamp versions use to line Burbank and Magnolia Blvds. in Burbank, but those are all gone, too.\n\nThere are eight \"California Specials\" found around the El Portal Theatre in North Hollywood, four on Lankershim and the other four around the corner on Weddington.Â These are 21st Century transplants. The California Special was never found on either of those two thoroughfares.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nOriginally called the Macy Street Viaduct/Bridge, the Cesar E. Chavez Avenue Viaduct is the second bridge built during large bridge-building program in Los Angeles during the 1920s. The first bridge located on this spot was a wooden, kerosene lamp-lit covered bridge, built in 1870. It was later replaced with a small metal truss bridge.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe site of numerous significant events in the history of public health, the Los Angeles County + USC Medical Center contains one of the city's most recognizable Art Deco buildings. The facility is located in Los Angeles' Lincoln Heights neighborhood and has previously been known as County/USC and Los Angeles County General Hospital.\n\nClick HERE to see more Early Views of the LA County General Hospital.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nOn May 7, 1942, the Los Angeles Park Commission renamed Westlake Park in honor of Gen. Douglas MacArthur. The decision to rename the park, which had been known as Westlake Park for more than 50 years, was made in preparation for an observance of MacArthur Day on June 13th.*^\n\nRefurbished Wilshire Specials can still be found in downtown LA. (Click HERE).\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nSouthern California was once home to the world's largest interurban electric railway system, the Pacific Electric Railway. Los Angeles also boasted the Nation's fifth largest urban trolley system, the Los Angeles Railway. This combination streetlight trolley pole on North Main Street is representative of many different styles of steel and concrete decorative poles used to support the 600-volt DC wires which supplied power to the streetcars and interurbans of the two companies.^^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nVariations of the UM-1906, the UM-2502, and similar dual uprights by other manufacturers also still exist in a number of outlying areas, generally neighborhood commercial in nature. They include the south side of Magnolia Avenue from Lankershim to Vineland and north side of Magnolia from Cleon to Cartwright in North Hollywood-Valley Village; 3400-3700 Slauson Avenue in Hyde Park; Seventh Street between Union and Garland Avenues in Westlake; La Cienega Boulevard between Airdrome Street and Olympic Boulevard, and Seventh Street between Catalina and Hoover Streets In the Wilshire area.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nWestwood Village adjacent to the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) was decorated in the early part of the century with the Westwood Special, notable for the blue and gold ceramic tile around its base. These were replaced with modern lights in the early 1960's when Westwood Village determined to become the brightest lighted commercial area in the world using 1,000-watt mercury vapor lamps.^^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe dual-lamp electroliers shown above were utilized in a most unique way. Cross-arms were installed on top of the electrolier post and power lines layed upon the arm. Also, streetcar wire ran across the street and was attached at both ends to the electroliers.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nLos Angeles installed its first automated traffic signals in October 1920 at five locations on Broadway. These early signals, manufactured by the Acme Traffic Signal Co., paired \"Stop\" and \"Go\" semaphore arms with small red and green lights. Bells played the role of today's amber or yellow lights, ringing when the flags changedâa process that took five seconds. By 1923 the city had installed 31 Acme traffic control devices.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn the photo above, the large building in the distance is the Biltmore Hotel and the building being demolished is the Biltmore Theatre, built in 1924.Â Â Also, the LA Central Library is to the right (out of view).\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn the above photo is an odd looking structure in the form of an Igloo.Â It was an Ice Cream parlor with the name of, you guessed it, “The Igloo”.Â Click HERE to see more.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe “Ventura Special\" lined Ventura Boulevard from Sepulveda Eastward to Lankershim, and then Cahuenga Boulevard West from Lankershim to Hollywood Bowl. Although none of the full street lights survive, a few of the lanterns can be found on the Fletcher Drive Bridge over the L. A. River in Atwater Village.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nCThere also used to be several Ventura Specials in more recent times. Here’s the census: Four on the Washington Boulevard Bridge over the L.A. River. According to Google Street View, two survive and two were stolen sometime between January 2023 and May 2024. Eight were located on the 7th Street Bridge over the Los Angeles River. All have been stolen sometime between February 2023 and May 2024, per Google Street View. That’s the sad part of life. Butâ¦life goes on.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nSouthern California was once home to the world's largest interurban electric railway system, the Pacific Electric Railway. Los Angeles also boasted the Nation's fifth largest urban trolley system, the Los Angeles Railway. This combination streetlight trolley pole on North Alameda Street is representative of many different styles of steel and concrete decorative poles used to support the 600-volt DC wires which supplied power to the streetcars and interurbans of the two companies.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Post Office Terminal Annex, a three-story building with two towers, was designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood and built by Sarver & Zoss between 1939 and 1940. The building was known to open 24 hours a day and responsible for processing 2,000,000 mails per day including all incoming and outgoing mails in Los Angeles. It is located between Alameda Street and Cesar E. Chavez Avenue, across from the Los Angeles Union Station.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe scroll arms (genie lamps) are in the style that began to appear just before WW2, but really took off post-war.Â Vine Street scroll arms first appeared in 1947.Â The Hollywood Blvd. group between Sycamore & Gower was particularly short-lived:Â 1947 & 1948, before being replaced with another design in the summer of 1948.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe interchange was constructed as a stack interchange because surrounding buildings and terrain made construction of a cloverleaf interchange impractical. The mainline traffic of US 101 is at the top of the interchange, above the ramps, a rarity in stack interchanges. Its distinctive architecture has long made it a symbol of Los Angeles' post-World War II development, and it appears on numerous postcards of the 1950s and 1960s.^*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Four Level, also known as the Stack, gets its name from its multi-tiered structure that separates traffic heading in each direction into dedicated lanes. On the bottom level are curved ramps for those changing from the 110 freeway to the 101. One level above is the main trunk of the 110 freeway, named the Arroyo Seco Parkway north of the interchange and the Harbor Freeway south of it. On the third level are the arcing flyover ramps carrying traffic from the 101 freeway to the 110. Finally, on the fourth and top level is the main trunk of the 101 freeway, named the Hollywood Freeway to the west and the Santa Ana Freeway to the east.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nBetween 1954 and 2010, Arroyo Seco Parkway was officially designated the Pasadena Freeway. In 2010, as part of plans to revitalize its scenic value and improve safety, Caltrans renamed the roadway back to its original name. All the bridges built during parkway construction remain, as do four older bridges that crossed the Arroyo Seco before the 1930s.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Davit Streetlight used a different type of lamp, based on improvements in HID lighting technology. Lamps were horizontally-mounted, rather than vertically as with the earlier pendants. This permitted a larger lamp in a housing, or optical assembly, which included reflector and prisms to direct the light. Along with this change in the lamp size and orientation came improvements in the gasses used.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nBy the late 1970s, sodium had replaced mercury as the most common form of lamp.Â The result was a significant change in the height and spacing of street lights. The improvement in lighting power allowed the electroliers to be taller and placed further apart. Longer arms extended the lamp over the street, and the reflectors and prisms threw the light toward the center of the roadway.Â The horizontal orientation of the optical assembly, attached to a curved arm, inevitably gave this type of street light the popular name of cobra-head.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nMercury vapor lamps are more energy efficient than incandescent and most fluorescent lights, with luminous efficacies of 35 to 65 lumens/watt.Â Their other advantages are a long bulb lifetime in the range of 24,000 hours and a high intensity, clear white light output.Â For these reasons, they were used for large area overhead lighting, such as in factories, warehouses, and sports arenas as well as for streetlights.^\n\nHigh pressure sodium lamps would replace the Mercury vapor lamps by the late 1970s.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThese forked three-arm streetlights were chosen in the early 1970's by representatives of the Van Nuys business community to light Van Nuys Boulevard and Magnolia Boulevard. Originally, 1,000 watt mercury vapor lamps were used to provide on average five foot-candles. This turned out to be too bright and too costly from an energy level.Â Today, these three-pronged electroliers can still can be seen on and around Van Nuys Boulevard.Â However, the luminaires today are 250 watt high-pressure sodium.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe most colorful of the postwar lights is the Hollywood Boulevard Special. Beginning around 1960 the existing electroliers on Hollywood Boulevard were reconstructed. The original pole bases and shafts were retained, but the lamps were replaced by luminaires on short arms. The Hollywood Special is a rectangular housing, over seven feet in length, in which three lamps are housed. The face of each side of the housing is adorned by red stars.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe \"Hollywood Specials\" streetlights, known for their distinctive three-bulb design and red stars, were installed along Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street in the 1960s. These streetlights remained the predominant style in the area for over three decades, indicating they lasted at least until the late 1990s. They were a notable feature of Hollywood's streetscape during this period, contributing to the area's iconic visual identity.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn the 1970s, the intersection of Sunset and Vine in Hollywood was still a vibrant cultural hub with deep ties to the entertainment industry. The area, once home to NBC Radio City, was transformed with the construction of the Home Savings and Loan building, designed by Millard Sheets and completed in 1968. This building became an artistic landmark, featuring mosaics and sculptures that celebrated Hollywood's history. The surrounding streets, including \"Guitar Row,\" were lively with nightlife and music-related businesses.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nAn example of the transition from the pendant to the davit is the two headed specialty light (CD-950), dating from the mid-1950s, which can be found along Wilshire Boulevard, from Fairfax Avenue to beyond Wilton Place. It is significant for its use as an updated specialty electrolier to continue the tradition of the Wilshire Special of the late 1920s. While in form close to the pre-war pendants, the luminaires are not teardrop in shape, indicating the use of early optical assemblies. Also new is the side-by-side mounting, rather than the front-and back position as found in the Broadway pendants of the late 1940s.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe double heads date from 2005, reminiscent of the scroll-arm teardrops that started populating the area around 1946. The shafts and bases on Hollywood Blvd. (dubbed the CD 920 by the LABSL) date from 1948. Vine Street didn't get its CD 920s until around 1960, when the famous 5-Star street lights were installed as part of the Hollywood Walk of Fame project.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe pendant could make good use of the early High Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps becoming increasingly common by the late 1930s. In place of a filament, the HID lamp ignited a gas. The most common in the early years of the HID was mercury vapor. It was a practical lamp by 1938, providing 400 watts of power. It had a life of almost four years, compared to the incandescent which could last six to eight months.^\n\nPlease Support Our Cause\n\nWater and Power Associates, Inc. is a non-profit, public service organization dedicated to preserving historical records and photos.\n\nYour generosity allows us to continue to disseminate knowledge of the rich and diverse multicultural history of the greater Los Angeles area; to serve as a resource of historical information; and to assist in the preservation of the city's historic records."
