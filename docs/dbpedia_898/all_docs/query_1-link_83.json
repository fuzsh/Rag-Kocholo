        "text": "All About Tulsa, Oklahoma\n\nFacts, Trivia and useful information\n\nElevation: 722 ft. (220 m). Population: 391,906 (2010).\n\nTime zone: Central (CST): UTC minus 6 hours. Summer (DST) CDT (UTC-5).\n\nTulsa is the second-largest city in the State of Oklahoma and 47th-most populous city in the United States. It is the county seat of Tulsa county. The Metropolitan Area of Tulsa had over 960,000 residents and spans Osage, Rogers, Wagoner and Tulsa counties.\n\nIts motto is: \"A New Kind of Energy\" and its nicknames are \"Oil Capital of the World\", \"Tulsey Town\" and \"T-Town\".\n\nTulsa's History\n\nThis part of America has been inhabited for over 10,000 years. The Native American people were hunters and gatherers. The Spanish reached the region in the mid 1500s but didn't settle it; the French fur traders arrived in the late 1700s as they explored the Arkansas River upstream in what was then the French Louisiana.\n\nAfter the US purchase of Louisiana in 1803, Oklahoma remained a remote area and was later designated as the \"Indian Territory\" and was to be used for the relocation of Native Americans, removed from their tribal lands in the East (this forcible relocation took place in the 1830s and is known as the \"Trail of Tears\").\n\nThe Osage people\n\nThe Osage had settled in what is now Osage county, Oklahoma by the mid 1700s. But they had to cede their claim to that land to the US government who in turn gave it to the Cherokee Nation that it was forcing to relocate in Oklahoma.\n\nBut the Osage returned to Oklahoma and repurchased 1.57 million acres (6.400 km2) of their former land from the Cherokee. It became a reservation on 1875; this land is just northwest of Tulsa.\n\nThe Creek people\n\nThe Creek tribe lived in Georgia and traded with the British colony established there. After American independence, the new state of Georgia forced them to cede their lands through a series of treaties between 1790 and 1805.\n\nDiscontent among the Creek led to the Red Stick War (1814) and even more land cessions (1825). Finally the Federal Government signed a treaty relocating them in the \"Indian Territory\" which would later become Oklahoma (1832). In 1836 they were forcibly expelled from Georgia and Alabama.\n\nThe Lochapoka Band of Creek Indians settled in 1828-36 in what is now Tulsa; their village was located close to present Cheyenne Ave. and 18th St., under an oak tree, the \"Creek Council Oak Tree\".\n\nThe Name Tulsa\n\nIt is the name that the Creek Indians gave to the village they established there in 1838; it was called \"Tallasi\" or \"Tulasi\" which means \"old town\" in Creek language.\n\nThe same word is the origin of the name of Tallahassee in Florida\n\nA U.S. Army party explored the area in 1832, camping in what is now Washington Irving Park (after the famous writer who accompanied the party).\n\nLewis Perryman set up a trading post in the village in 1846, he was part Creek. The town grew with cattle trading and a post office was opened in 1879 and one of Lewis' sons was postmaster.\n\nThe Atlantic and Pacific Railroad which would later become the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway reached Tulsa in 1882.\n\nTulsa was incorporated in 1898; and the first oil well (Sue Bland N°1) was drilled in 1901, opening the oil-boom.\n\nPopulation began to grow (from 1,390 to 141,258 residents between 1900 and 1930). By 1917, Tulsa called itself \"The Oil Capital of the World\" in 1917, and oil drove its economy.\n\nRoute 66 was aligned through the town in 1926, promoted by a local businessman, Cyrus Avery, known as \"The Father of Route 66\" who was part of the Committee that drew its alignment.\n\nRacial Strife\n\nThe African American community in the Greenwood neighborhood was prosperous and peaceful, but the \"Tulsa Race Riot\" of May 31 and June 1, 1921 saw civil disorder and whites attacking blacks. The official toll was 39 dead (23 of them blacks), but the actual figure was closer to 300 dead (mostly black). 35 city blocks were burned and 10,000 people left homeless.\n\nOil wealth helped the town weather the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, which hit the nation and Oklahoma hard.\n\nAfter World War II, Route 66 became saturated, it was also unsafe so Oklahoma built the Turner and the Will Rogers Turnpikes linking Oklahoma City to Joplin, Missouri through Tulsa in 1957. The multi-lane highway bypassed the old segments of Route 66, but as they passed through Tulsa, they benefited its economy.\n\nWhere to Stay\n\nThere are plenty of hotels in Tulsa, you can take your pick.\n\n> > Book your Hotel in Tulsa\n\nRoute 66 Accommodation close to Tulsa\n\nHeading East....\n\n18 mi.

It gives us an idea of what it was like in Tulsa during US-66's heyday.\n\nRittenhouse tells us that 15 miles east of Tulsa US66 and OK-33 intersected, and there were cabins, garage and gas at that point. One mile ahead the road turned sharply west and two miles west, ran through Lynn Lane (a small community) with \"several gas stations, a small garage and general homes. KVO court here\".\n\nIn Tulsa Rittenhouse mentions \"Several hotels including: Adams, Alvin, Bliss, Bradford, Cadillac, Corona, Tulsa, Mayo, Mercer, Oklahoma, Plaza, Seneca and Wells; courts include: Cook's, Park Plaza, Achor, Baker's, Blue Jay, Campbell's, El Reposo, Mid-Way, Rio, Shady-Rest, Tulsa, Whitt, Will Rogers, Grotto\". On the west side of town he mentions Howard Park and the suburb of \"Red Fork\" he comments that the road into Sapulpa is \"flanked with a constant succession of... tourist courts, garages, gas stations, etc.\"\n\nDrive through Tulsa on Route 66\n\nFrom the East\n\nComing from the east (from Catoosa), drive south along 193rd Street and then take a sharp right turn along E 11th Street. Ahead to your right is an old Gas Station\n\nStone faced Gas Station\n\n17501 E 11th St., Tulsa\n\nThis old gas station has seen better days. Its gabled canopy stands over the now empty pump islands and the broken sign is rusting away.\n\nYou are in Lynn Lane and here is the KVO court mentioned by Rittenhouse in 1946 (to your right just west of S 157th Ave)\n\nK.V.O. Modern Courts\n\n15606 E 11th St. Tulsa, Tulsa\n\nThe postcard tells us that \"E.F. Schmidt Proprietor, Reasonable Rates, 5 1⁄2 miles east of Tulsa\".The stone buildings are as they appear in the postcard below. The trees of course have grown since the 1940s. But the roof shape and disposition of the double doors on the cabin is the same:\n\nHead west, for 3 miles and after passing the freeway, to your right is a Classic Motel:\n\nBrookshire Motel\n\n11017 E 11th St, Tulsa\n\nThis motel now closed, has a classic neon sign and an appealing cottage styled office.\n\nContinue west to the next \"Motel\":\n\nSaratoga Motor Hotel\n\n10117 E 11th St., Tulsa\n\nThe Saratoga \"Motor Hotel\" (what we now call a motel) had 85 rooms with a 24-hour Resturant, Circulating Ice Water, Continuous Hi-Fi Music and Radio, Large, Heated Pool and 1-Day Laundry Service. Credit Cards Honored and Free Airport Transportation.\n\nNow it is the America's Value Inn and the original neon sign is still there though redesigned (yellow triangle and star gone) vertical \"motel\" letters with text in them, the \"L\" gone. And the upper green sign's shape has been modified.\n\nRoute 66 signage at Mingo Road, Tulsa, Oklahoma\n\nSigns at Mingo Road and Interpretative Plaza\n\n9701 E 11th St.\n\nIn the median strip of 11th Street at Mingo Rd. there was a sign marking the 1926-32 alignment (right along Mingo \"Greenway\"), the 1933-73 alignment (straight ahead on 11th St.) and to the left an arrow pointing towards the \"Interpretative Plaza\" (with parking space and some plaques and markers with information).\n\nSide Trip to the 1926-32 Alignment\n\nTake a 5.1 mile side trip (round trip) to visit Two Classic Sights on the first alignment of Route 66 in Tulsa. This is the Map with Directions.\n\nTurn right along Mingo Rd. and head north. At the Admiralty Pl. roundabout is a very new sculpture completed in December 2018:\n\nRoute 66 Rising Sculpture\n\nCyrus Avery Traffic Circle\n\nRoute 66 Rising. KTUL\n\nThis is a gigantic sculpture, 70 feet wide and 30 feet high. it cost $655,000.\n\nIt was designed by Eric F.

Even though in those days Route 66 had moved south to 11th St., it catered to locals and customers driving down US 75 or OK-33 into Tulsa.\n\nTurn right at Memorial Dr., cross the freeway and turn left at Easton St. to see a unique Drive-in theater:\n\nAdmiral Twin Drive-In\n\nRoute 66 Roadside Attraction\n\n7355 E Easton St, Tulsa\n\nIt was built in 1951 and is one of the few drive-in theaters that have survived in Oklahoma.\n\nWith a capacity for more than 1,000 cars it is the largest drive-in theater in the state. It has a dual 9-story pair of screens. This is its Street view.\n\nNow turn around and head back to 11th and Mingo, turn right and head west into Tulsa along the 1933-73 Route 66.\n\nAgain on 11th Street into Tulsa\n\nOasis Motel Neon Sign today, Tulsa, Oklahoma.

There was a pool in the front lawn, which has now gone.\n\nThe sign is a googie style favored in the early 1960s, so it probably replaced the original one at that time. The \"boomerang\" on the sign is great!\n\nSheridan Hills Motel\n\n6302 E 11th St, Tulsa\n\nThe current Super 11 Inn used to be the Sheridan. Its postcard tells us that it had all the comforts a traveler needed: \"East edge of Tulsa York Air-Conditioning - Thermostat Heat control - Wall-to-wall Carpets - Tile Baths - TV's\".
