        "text": "Two weeks ago I published a blog about Art Deco in Miami, which many people liked, so I thought it might be nice to write something about Art Deco in the City.\n\nI am going to cheat a bit and republish the blog I wrote on this subject way back in November 2017. Sadly the wonderful Express Newspaper building is currently hidden behind hoardings but the pictures here will give you a good idea of how impressive it is.\n\nHereâ€™s the 2017 blog:\n\nI used to often confuse Art Deco and Art Nouveau â€“ probably because they both begin with the word â€˜artâ€™. I had to get my head around this properly when I decided to write this blog and therefore searched for a simple explanation.\n\nThe one I like best is that Art Nouveau tends to be flowing and flowery whereas Art Deco tends to be sharp and streamlined. Both designs evolved as a result of the culture of the times â€“ Nouveau influenced by the industrial revolution and Deco by the First World War.\n\nHere are some of my Art Deco favourites.\n\nEvery now and then when I headed off to meetings in the East end of the City I would walk past the magnificent, undulating and symmetrical Ibex House at 42-47 Minories. Built in 1937, it is clad in black and beige faience and, apparently, has the longest strip windows in London. When it opened you could rent space for 6 shillings (30 new pence) per square foot â€“ which included the cost of cleaning.\n\nI often feel a bit nostalgic walking down Fleet Street. I well remember its heyday when lorries trundled past carrying gigantic rolls of paper and you could hear the presses rumbling into the night producing the next dayâ€™s print news. Sadly, it was also the home of the notorious so-called â€˜Spanish Customsâ€™, restrictive practices which eventually left the industry open to brutal modernisation and, finally, total relocation.\n\nThe former Daily Express building in Fleet Street (1932) has a black facade with rounded corners in vitrolite with clear glass and chromium strips and, in my view, looks quite futuristic even today. The newspaper moved out in 1989 and the current owners are investment bankers Goldman Sachs. The foyer is stunning but currently hidden from view behind curtains â€“ come on, Goldmanâ€™s, draw back those curtains and let us mere mortals have a peep!\n\nThe former Daily Telegraph building at 141 Fleet street is another Art Deco masterpiece (also owned by Goldman Sachs). It is meant to be overwhelming and certainly succeeds with its giant fluted columns topped with carved Egyptian capitals.\n\nJust above street level, Twin Mercuries head off to distribute news around the Empire with the sun rising over the centre of the hemisphere which is, of course, England. Apparently the carver, Arthur Oakley, shortly afterwards became a monk specialising in religious ornaments.\n\nFlorin Court , designed by Guy Morgan and Partners and opened in 1936, is famous now as the fictional â€˜Whitehaven Mansionsâ€™ home of Hercule Poirot. Itâ€™s in Charterhouse Square and originally boasted squash courts, a dining room and a cocktail bar. Nowadays, thereâ€™s a gym, a spa and a wi-fi area.\n\nI have two favourites â€“ Fox Umbrellas and the shipâ€™s prow in Bury Street.\n\nFox Umbrellas at 118 London Wall was constructed in 1937 on the ground floor of an early 19th century terraced house. It is by the shopfitting firm E. Pollard & Company and has a vitrolite front along with curved non-reflective glass (an American invention for which Pollard held the English patent). According to the blog Londonâ€™s Historic Shops and Markets, this â€˜invisibleâ€™ glass, which was was very expensive, allowed passers-by to see much further into the shop and made the stock on display more visible at a time when interior lighting was duller and less sharp than today. It works by using a steeply curved concave glass to deflect light towards matt black â€˜bafflesâ€™. Pollards installed the same type of glass at Simpsons of Piccadilly, where it is still in place today (the store is now a Waterstones).\n\nPop in for a glass of wine â€“ many of the original features have been preserved.\n\nFor the Art Deco shipâ€™s prow, first find Holland House in Bury Street just opposite the Gherkin and the subject of my earlier blog, Ship Ahoy. Walk around to the south east corner of the building, step back and admire this brave vessel plunging through the waves towards you, the funnel smoking impressively. Itâ€™s a granite structure by the Dutch artist J. Mendes da Costa and reflects the companyâ€™s main business of shipping.\n\nI love this story about the shipâ€™s positioning.\n\nApparently the company owner, Helene KrÃ¶ller-MÃ¼ller, had wished to buy the whole of the Bury Street corner, but had been thwarted by the adjacent owners who refused to sell. As a consequence, Holland House is broken into two sections, and it has been suggested that the aggressive prow of the ship was intended to â€˜cock a snookâ€™ at the neighbours.\n\nIf you would like to follow me on Instagram here is the link â€¦\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/london_city_gent/\n\nI usually only post my holiday snaps on Instagram but Iâ€™m making an exception this week after my visit to Miami South Beach. This is partly because I know I have a number of Art Deco fans among my subscribers, but also because I was just so impressed with what has been retained and restored in the Ocean Drive district where we were staying.\n\nHere are views looking north â€¦\n\nâ€¦ and south â€¦\n\nHere are my favourite buildings and what I have been able to find out about them.\n\nThe McAlpin Hotel has been described as follows: One of the finest examples of Art Deco architecture in Miami with its perfectly symmetrical design and eye-catching Miami pastel hues of pink and turquoise. Look for the cute face formed in the center of the building by three windows and the dividing lines. It was designed in 1940 by Lawrence Murray Dixon, considered one of the great minds in the Art Deco movement â€¦\n\nIn the evening â€¦\n\nNext door, and by the same architect, is the Ocean Plaza, built a year later â€¦\n\nBuilt in 1937, the Leslie Hotel is described as follows in the architectural guide book : Tripartite symmetry on primary facade; Vertical racing stripes; Eyebrows; Large signage of hotel name; Ziggurat parapet roofline; Minimal additional ornamentation.\n\nI like the use of the term â€˜eyebrowsâ€™, so appropriate â€¦\n\nThe Cavalier South Beach Hotel was one of the first hotels ever to be built on Ocean Drive and was designed by architect Roy F. France in 1936 â€¦\n\nâ€˜Unlike most Art Deco buildings in the area, using horizontal lines as the main feature in their design, the Cavalier bucks this trend by going for a more vertical style. The decorative stucco friezes outside the building draw your eyes upward. As a result, the hotel looks strikingly different from the nearby structuresâ€™ â€¦\n\nAnd now four hotels designed by Henry Hohauser.\n\nThe Penguin was built in 1948 â€¦\n\nCute penguins try to entice you in â€¦\n\nThen thereâ€™s the Congress Hotel (1936) ..\n\nThe decoration by the door is a nice touch â€¦\n\nAlso by Harry is The Crescent (1938) â€¦\n\nâ€˜It has relief decoration, a kind of railroad track design, that cuts vertically through the windows and continues to outline the top as well as the circular discs that add a geometric motifâ€™ â€¦\n\nAnd finally, by the same architect, The Cardozo (1939) â€¦\n\nBuilt in 1939, the hotel was named after Benjamin Cardozo, one of the first Jewish jurors appointed to the US Supreme Court â€¦\n\nThe nearby Carlyle looks rather unusual â€¦\n\nThe architectural guide book says : â€˜A mainstay of Miamiâ€™s Ocean Drive, The Carlyle represented an evolution of the Art Deco style that had dominated architect Richard Kiehnelâ€™s previous works, while still retaining standards like the rule of thirds and elegant curvatures nestled among sharp geometry.\n\nOpening in 1941 with a sparse colour palette of white and sea foam green, the Carlyle is a significantly more understated and nuanced take on the bright pastel colorways seen on other South Beach hotels like The Pelicanâ€™ â€¦\n\nThe Winter Haven Hotel â€“ hereâ€™s another excerpt from the Guide Book : The Winter Haven Hotel â€¦ was designed by Albert Anis and opened in 1939. Taller than the typical South Beach Art Deco hotel, it still has the typical tripartite front and extended eyebrows around the corners. The notched central bay includes even the windows. A canopy supported by fluted columns accentuates the front. The upper stories above the canopy are dramatically supported by these heavy fluted columnsâ€™.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the Art Deco delights of Miami. They were for a long time under serious threat of demolition but were rescued by the efforts of a wonderful, tenacious lady called Barbara Baer Capitman who is commemorated with this sculpture â€¦\n\nRead more about her here.\n\nBy the way, if youâ€™re feeling in a revolutionary mood at the moment and you want to start setting up the barricades, this is the man to contact â€¦\n\nIâ€™ll be back to writing about London again next week.\n\nIf you would like to follow me on Instagram here is the link â€¦\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/london_city_gent/\n\nA lovely Sunny day last Saturday tempted me out for a walk.\n\nThe national Submarine Memorial Memorial on Victoria Embankment (EC4Y 0HJ) is, I think, one of Londonâ€™s most moving.\n\nAlthough able to hide when submerged, once struck the vessels were often unable to rise to the surface and became effectively underwater coffins. In the First World War fifty four boats were lost and with them the lives of 138 officers and 1,225 men. At the inauguration in 1922 Rear Admiral Sinclair, the Chief of the Submarine Service, reminded those present that, during the Great War â€¦\n\nThe number of those killed in the Submarine Service was greater in proportion to its size than any other branch of His Majestyâ€™s fighting forces â€¦ one third of the total personnel.\n\nIn November 1959 new panels commemorating Second World war losses were unveiled by Rear Admiral B W Taylor.\n\nWright and Moore, writing for the 20th Century Architecture website, describe the memorial as a complex mixture of narrative and symbolism â€¦\n\nSculptor: F B Hitch Architect: A H R Tenison Founder: E J Parlanti\n\nThe central figures recreate the scene set inside the submarine exaggerating it into a small, claustrophobic tunnel. The crew use charts and follow dials, the captain is braced at the centre with the periscope behind his head. Around the vessel a shallow relief depicts an array of sea creatures or mermen appearing to trap and haul the submarine in fishing nets, reminding us that the submarines were as much prey to the tempestuous elements as they were to the enemy.\n\nOn both corners are allegorical figures. Next to the list of vessels lost between 1914 and 1918, Truth holds up her mirror. Just further to the left in the picture are two of the 40 bronze wreath hooks in the form of anchors â€¦\n\nOn the right, next to the vessels lost in the Second World War, Justice wears a blindfold and as usual holds a sword and scales â€¦\n\nOn a more lighthearted vein, walk east from the Memorial on the north side of the road and youâ€™ll find this chap frantically trying to hail a taxi â€¦\n\nTaxi! by the American Sculptor J Seward Johnson is cast bronze and is now interestingly weathered. If you think the baggy trousers, moustache and side parting are erring on the retro, thatâ€™s because this particular office worker was transferred from New York in 2014. It was sculpted in 1983 and originally stood on Park Avenue and 47th Street.\n\nI love this pair of â€˜dolphinâ€™ lamps (although they are actually sturgeon) ..\n\nNeptune also makes an appearance â€¦\n\nFurther east you can wave to the pretty mermaid who embellishes the Art Deco style Unilever Building â€¦\n\nFurther along the lamps repay detailed study â€¦\n\nAcross the road, a jolly friar looks down from the Blackfriar pub â€¦\n\nCarry on along Queen Victoria Street and admire the imposing College of Arms building â€¦\n\nâ€¦ and its ornate gate â€¦\n\nSt Peterâ€™s Hill runs north alongside the College and at the top you will find the Firefighters Memorial. On its octagonal bronze base are the names of the 997 men and women of the fire service who lost their lives during the conflict. The sculpture features two firemen â€˜working a branchâ€™, with their legs spread to take the strain of the hose â€¦\n\nA sub-officer directs others to assist. There are clues to the identity of this figure scattered among the debris at the figuresâ€™ feet: the letters CTD for C.T. Demarne. At the unveiling, his colleagues from the fire service claimed that there was no need for such clues. One who was interviewed by the Telegraph stated: â€˜You can tell itâ€™s Cyril by the way heâ€™s standingâ€¦he always waved his arms about like that when he was ordering us aboutâ€™.\n\nBy 1943 over 70,00 women had enrolled in the National Fire Service in the United Kingdom. This memorial commemorates those who lost their lives in the London bombings â€¦\n\nThe lady on the left is an incident recorder and the one on the right a despatch rider.\n\nAcross the road, just south of the Cathedral, is this rather handsome bearded gentleman â€¦\n\nJohn Donne 1572-1631 by Nigel Boonham (2012).\n\nIn 1617, two years after his ordination, Donneâ€™s wife died at age 33 after giving birth to a stillborn child, their twelfth. Grief-stricken at having lost his emotional anchor, Donne vowed never to marry again, even though he was left with the task of raising his ten surviving children in modest financial circumstances. His bereavement turned him fully to his vocation as an Anglican divine and, on November 22, 1621, Donne was installed as Dean of St. Paulâ€™s Cathedral. The power and eloquence of his sermons soon secured for him a reputation as the foremost preacher in the England of his day, and he became a favourite of both Kings James I and Charles I.\n\nHis bust points almost due west but shows him turning to the east towards his birthplace on Bread Street. The directions of the compass were important to Donne in his metaphysical work: east is the Rising Sun, the Holy Land and Christ, while west is the place of decline and death. Underneath the bust are inscribed words from his poem Good Friday â€“ Riding Westward :\n\nHence isâ€™t that I am carried towards the west, This day when my soulâ€™s form bends to the east\n\nThe most familiar quotation from Donne comes from his Meditation XVII â€“ Devotions upon Emergent Occasions published in 1624:\n\nâ€˜No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main â€¦ and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.â€™\n\nIncidentally, if you walk around the east side of the Cathedral you will see scars from the Second World War bombing which illustrate just how close the building came to destruction â€¦\n\nIf you would like to follow me on Instagram here is the link â€¦\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/london_city_gent/\n\nEvery time I walk along Fleet Street I find something to write about.\n\nThis week I decided to take another look at the courts and alleys starting with the curiously named Poppinâ€™s Court (a good name for the restaurant). The wallsign gives tourists a visual clue as to whatâ€™s on offer, yummy!) ..\n\nAccording to The London Encyclopaedia, the abbots of Cirencester, whose crest included a popinjay or parrot, had a town house here in the early 14th century called Le Popyngaye and the name stuck. If this is correct, the apostrophe in the current name is not really appropriate, giving the impression that someone called Poppin used to live there. Or possibly that the court is named after the restaurant. There used to be a stone relief of a parrot over the courtâ€™s entrance but this has disappeared.\n\nI was curious to know what a coat of arms with a parrot on it looked like and I found one, on the crest of Sutton United Football Club of all places â€¦\n\nFurther west is Peterborough Court, with its â€˜INâ€™ entrance â€¦\n\nâ€¦ and â€˜OUTâ€™ exit â€¦\n\nThe Court is named after the Bishop of Peterborough who owned the land in the 14th century. Described as â€˜An Art Deco Temple to Journalismâ€™, the Portland Stone building dates from 1928 and was the home of the Daily Telegraph. The newspaper moved out in 1987 and eventually Goldman Sachs International leased the building at a cost of Â£18 million a year. The lease runs out in 2021 and I think they have already vacated the building since it looks a bit sad and neglected. There was talk last year of it becoming another WeWork site but who knows in the current economic climate. The lovely Art Deco clock usually makes me smile â€¦\n\nCheshire Court is modest, but its fame comes from its neighbour, Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese â€“ a pub which has been recorded on this location since at least 1538, although itâ€™s original name was probably the Horn Tavern â€¦\n\nWine Office Court is so named because licences for selling wine were issued at premises here. Thatâ€™s the entrance to Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese on the right â€¦\n\nThe view looking towards Fleet Street â€¦\n\nI canâ€™t find out much about Hind Court, itâ€™s possibly named after a tavern â€¦\n\nMany of the courts have a plaque at the entrance. This one shows a facsimile of the front page of the first edition of Daily Express dated Tuesday 24th April 1900 â€¦\n\nThe note in the box reads â€¦\n\nThe first edition of the Daily Express was published in Fleet Street. It was one of the first papers in Britain to carry gossip, sports, womenâ€™s features and a crossword.\n\nBolt Court is probably named after another vanished inn, the Bolt-in-Tun, and Dr Johnson lived here at number 8 from 1776 to when he died in 1784. The house was lost in a fire in 1819 â€¦\n\nAt the entrance is a facsimile of the front page of The Sun newspaper dated 15th September 1984 â€¦\n\nBolt Court leads to Gough Square where another house that was occupied by Dr Johnson has survived. There is also a sweet sculpture of his cat Hodge looking towards his old home â€¦\n\nIâ€™ve written more about the Square and Hodge in this blog entitled City Animals 2.\n\nSt Dunstanâ€™s Court references the nearby church, St Dunstan-in-the-West â€¦\n\nAt its entrance computerisation in the printing industry is illustrated, a bit bizarrely I think, by the Pac-Man game â€¦\n\nThe Royal Society met in Crane Court from 1710 until they moved to Somerset House in 1780 â€¦\n\nThe plaque shows a facsimile of the front page of the Daily Courant dated Wednesday March 11, 1702 â€¦\n\nIt was Britainâ€™s first daily newspaper.\n\nOn 14 April 1785 it ran a story about a man murdered after a visit to the barber. Some claim that this was the inspiration behind Victorian penny dreadful Sweeney Todd (allegedly a resident of 183 Fleet St) and the spawning of lots of movies â€¦\n\nItâ€™s worth taking a walk through Crane Court and seeing how it opens up into an area full of character where development has been careful and restrained â€¦\n\nMitre Court was named after the Mitre Tavern â€¦\n\nThe Mitre was Dr. Johnsonâ€™s favourite supper-house and James Boswell, his biographer, referred to dining there â€¦\n\nWe had a good supper, and port-wine, of which he (Johnson) sometimes drank a bottle.\n\nLike nearby Bouverie Street, the name Pleydell Court comes from the Pleydell-Bouveries, Earls of Radnor, who were landlords in this area â€¦\n\nNow to Hare Place and its interesting history.\n\nThe Whitefriars, or Carmelites, once owned land stretching from here to the river. When the monastery was dissolved in November 1538 the land was sold to individuals who subdivided their plots and built tenements on them. However, this precinct had long possessed the privileges of Sanctuary, which were confirmed by a charter of James I in 1608. From about this time the area was known by the cant name Alsatia (after the disputed continental territory of Alsace), and its entrance was in Hare Place, then known as Ram Alley â€¦\n\nIt became the â€˜asylum of characterless debtors, cheats and gamblers here protected from arrestâ€™. One Edwardian historian spoke of â€¦\n\nIts reeking dens, its bawds and its occupantsâ€™ disgusting habits. Every house was a resort of ill-fame, and therein harboured women, and still worse, men, lost to every instinct of humanity.\n\nThe privilege of Sanctuary was finally abolished in 1687.\n\nAnd, finally, I walked through these elaborate gates to Serjeantsâ€™ Inn. â€¦\n\nPrudens Simplicitas (Prudent Simplicity) was the motto of the Amicable Society which was based here from 1838 and was the worldâ€™s first mutual life insurance company. The unusual choice of creatures may refer to a biblical quotation in which Jesus exhorted followers to be â€˜wise as serpents, gentle as dovesâ€™. Lost during building works, the gates were rediscovered in a scrapyard in 1937 and returned to their original position here in 1970.\n\nWhat awaited me inside the gates was quite unexpected â€¦\n\nThere is nothing to give a clue as to what this happy elephant represents but I am wondering if he is linked to the green bear that has recently appeared outside Citypoint â€¦\n\nIf you would like to follow me on Instagram here is the link â€¦\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/london_city_gent/\n\nIs this the creepiest sculpture to be found in the City?\n\nItâ€™s on the tower of St Mary Somerset (EC4V 4AG). This was a Wren church, but I donâ€™t think either he, or his very competent colleague Nicholas Hawksmoor, had anything to do with this screaming face. Their style was more cheerful cherubs and occasionally dragons or a phoenix.\n\nThe church was demolished in 1871 but the tower was saved and restored by the architect Ewan Christian who was also responsible for the National Gallery. It was probably him, therefore, who installed the head. It predates Munchâ€™s picture but reminds me of it â€¦\n\nYou can read more about the church and its background on The Londonist website from which I have borrowed this picture by Tony Tucker indicating where the screamer can be found â€¦\n\nThe tower is now a private home.\n\nThe Guildhall building at 71 Basinghall Street boasts a menagerie of strange creatures (EC2V 7HH). Some sit either side of the entrance â€¦\n\nOthers lurk near the top of the building â€¦\n\nâ€¦ and on the roof itself â€¦\n\nA predatory bird keeps a beady eye on you from the roof of 60 Lombard Street (EC3V 9EA) â€¦\n\nI must have walked past this building at 51-54 Gracechurch Street hundreds of times but never looked up and noticed two lines of extraordinary heads above and below the fifth floor windows â€¦\n\nIt was constructed between 1928 and 1930 and designed by the architect Leo Sylvester Sullivan. It has lovely Art Deco features but I have no idea why he incorporated the heads. There are 17 in total and this is a small selection â€¦\n\nYou can read more about the building on the excellent Look Up London website.\n\nAnother head, this time on the tower of St Margaret Pattens, Rood Lane (EC3M 1HS) â€¦\n\nTwo owls stand guard above the King William Street entrance to what was once the Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance Companyâ€™s City officeâ€¦\n\nOne of the delights of Eastcheap are these figures just below the roof of number 23 â€¦\n\nI cannot look at these dogsâ€™ and boarsâ€™ heads without smiling. When I first photographed them a few years ago they had a splash of colour and I think it is a shame that this has been painted over â€¦\n\nA little further east at 33-35 another boarâ€™s head peeps out from the undergrowth. It references the Eastcheap inn of that name which was supposed to be the meeting place of Sir John Falstaff, Prince Hal and other characters in Shakespeareâ€™s Henry IV plays â€¦\n\nThe Walkie Talkie looms over the area and dwarfs the remaining Victorian buildings including the one containing the boarâ€™s head which dates from 1868. Pevsner described it as â€˜one of the maddest displays in London of gabled Gothicâ€™ and he quoted Ian Nairn, the architectural critic, who called it â€˜the scream that you wake on at the end of a nightmareâ€™ â€¦\n\nThis creature on All Hallows by the Tower looks like an authentic gargoyle (water spout) but the downpipe or guttering is missing, maybe lost when the church was severely damaged in the war â€¦\n\nAs I walked along Cornhill one day I glanced up and saw these rather sinister figures silhouetted against the skyâ€¦\n\nCloser inspection shows them to be devils, and rather angry and malevolent ones too â€¦\n\nThey look down on St Peter upon Cornhill and are known as the Cornhill Devils (EC3V 3PD). The story goes that, when plans were submitted for the late Victorian building next to the church, the rector noticed that they impinged slightly on church land and lodged a strong objection. Everything had to literally go back to the drawing board at great inconvenience and expense. The terracotta devils looking down on the entrance to the church are said to be the architectâ€™s revenge with the lowest devil bearing some resemblance to the cleric himself â€¦\n\nIf this resembles the rector he must have been a pretty ugly guy.\n\nAnd finally, two mice share a piece of cheese in Philpot Lane. There are several theories as to the story behind these charming little creatures but no one knows for sure who put them there and why â€¦\n\nRemember you can follow me on Instagram :\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/london_city_gent/\n\nIt has been many years since I crossed Southwark Bridge and then I wasnâ€™t taking much notice of the buildings in Queen Street Place as I headed towards the bridge and out of the City. When I took the trouble to look last week I was absolutely captivated by this delightful but rather strange Art Deco sculpture by H W Palliser â€¦\n\nBuilt by the Vintnersâ€™ Company in 1928, at the centre stands a nude woman clutching to herself bunches of grapes which grow on vines at her side. She is a Bacchante, the â€˜spirit of the harvestâ€™, and two goats look up at her adoringly as four doves descend above her head. Two swans are also in attendance, reminding us that the Vintnersâ€™ Company is one of the three owners of all the swans on the upper Thames, the others being the Dyers and HM the Queen. The model for the woman was Leopoldine Avico who was also, I believe, the model for The Queen of Time above Selfridges.\n\nYou get a nice view of Vintnersâ€™ Hall from the Bridge â€¦\n\nImmediately next door is Thames House (1911-12). It was built for the Liebig Extract of Meat Company whose product was imported from a huge plant in Fray Bentos, Uruguay. There is a clue as to what they made over the central entrance â€¦\n\nYes, the two stone horns symbolise the South American herds that provided the meat for the famous and successful Oxo cube (or â€˜boiled up cowâ€™, as one commentator rather unkindly called it). The other carvings represent Abundance â€“ a nude youth pours water from a vase and a nude maiden pours flowers from a cornucopia.\n\nIn the pediment on the North Pavilion a pair of nude figures hold a strop to tame the winged horse Pegasus, who beats the cloud with his hooves in his struggle â€¦\n\nThis may allude to the alleged energising qualities of the product.\n\nOn the South Pavilion pediment a female figure with fruit and flowers represents the fruits of the land with Neptune, holding his trident and a rope for his net, signifies the fruits of the water â€¦\n\nBetween them is the figure of a boy standing on two winged wheels symbolising Trade..\n\nDirectly over the door is this group â€¦\n\nItâ€™s a particularly lavish doorway surmounted by an arch over a circular window or oculus. The spandrels over the arch contain bas reliefs of women denoting Commerce (left) and Wisdom (right), by Richard Garbe. Commerce holds a caduceus and brandishes an oak branch, symbol of endurance and fortitude. Wisdom holds a torch and proffers a laurel branch, symbol of victory. Above, a dove with an olive branch in her beak brings peace.\n\nIn front of the window is a bronze galleon by the metalworker William Bainbridge Reynolds â€¦\n\nThe ship is flanked by some rather grotesque fish which look like they are gasping for air. Maybe Neptune has just caught them.\n\nHereâ€™s the full frontal view â€¦\n\nFurther along to the north I admired some elaborate doors â€¦\n\nThe old doorway to Thames House at the junction with Upper Thames Street is now an entrance to Five Kings House, the interior of the building having now presumably been segmented in some way (EC4R 1QS) â€¦\n\nAbove the door the male figure, with a helmet and wings at his heels, is clearly Mercury as God of Commerce. Itâ€™s not clear what the lady represents â€“ possibly agriculture. Two seated putti support a cartouche\n\nQueen Street Place was a wonderful surprise to me. I have often been asked if I am ever going to run out of things to write about but I canâ€™t imagine this ever happening. The City seems to have something new to offer me every day I walk around it.\n\nRemember you can follow me on Instagram :\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/london_city_gent/\n\nFor the first half of the 18th century the river remained Londonâ€™s main thoroughfare. The watermenâ€™s cry of â€˜Oars! Oars!â€™ as they looked for customers constantly rang out in riverside streets. One Frenchman, who hadnâ€™t quite mastered the language but had heard of Londonâ€™s immoral reputation, thought this an invitation to try a quite different service.\n\nBut things were about to change.\n\nBy the mid-1750s the bridge was clearly failing in its purpose to provide an adequate river crossing, but the building of a new bridge nearby was constantly blocked by the strong waterman lobby and riverside businesses. Bridge residents showed their objection to a nearby temporary wooden bridge by persistently trying to burn it down.\n\nBut something had to be done, the bridge being â€¦\n\nNarrow, darksome, and dangerous â€¦ from the multitude of carriages â€¦ with frequent arches of strong timber crossing the street from the tops of houses to keep them together and stop them falling into the river.\n\nThomas Pennant writing in 1750.\n\nA compromise was reached in 1757 by pulling down all the houses on the bridge as well as the chapel of St Thomas the Martyr. The bones of the cleric who oversaw the earliest building of the bridge in the 12th century, Peter de Colechurch, were interred there and some accounts say that, when they were uncovered, the workmen unceremoniously tossed them into the Thames.\n\nSt Thomasâ€™s chapel is commemorated with a stained glass window in St Magnus-the -Martyr church. I like the sleepy monk on the right â€¦\n\nBut the bridge continued to be congested and, for a growing port, increasingly seen as an obstacle to trade. The momentum for change was unstoppable and the old bridge was doomed â€¦\n\nFew tears were shed over its destruction. As Bernard Ash writes in his fascinating book The Golden City : â€˜This was not a sentimental generation. It looked forward not backward. It saw no picturesqueness in the narrow, inconvenient ways of its forebears or in the narrow, inconvenient and often makeshift things they had builtâ€™.\n\nBut the river was no longer the highway of London â€“ private carriages and hackney coaches were taking over. As Ash eloquently points out, all the watermenâ€™s traffic had â€˜run away on wheelsâ€™.\n\nA new bridge designed by the Scottish engineer John Rennie (1761-1821) was decided upon. The work went ahead in 1824 under the supervision of his sons, John Rennie the Younger and George. In order to keep the old bridge open for traffic during construction it was decided that the new one should be on a different alignment, about one hundred feet upstream.\n\nConstruction took seven and a half years at a cost of two and a half million pounds and the lives of forty workmen, many perishing in the fast flowing water caused by the continued existence of the old bridge.\n\nThe opening (depicted below) was described in The Times as â€¦\n\nthe most splendid spectacle that has been witnessed on the Thames for many years.\n\nThe King arrived at about 4pm and the red carpeted stairs where he landed can be seen leading up to the bridge on the far side of the river. A huge pavilion where a sumptuous banquet was held had been erected on the bridge. The royal standard can be seen flying from the pavilion at the north end. The King was accompanied by his wife Adelaide â€“ hence the name of the 1925 Art Deco office block on the north east side of the bridge that you can see today.\n\nHereâ€™s a view of Adelaide House from the Thames path â€¦\n\nLondonâ€™s growing prosperity led to increased traffic and more congestion problems for the bridge â€¦\n\nBy 1896 the bridge was the busiest point in London, and one of its most congested â€“ on average 8,000 pedestrians and 900 vehicles crossed every hour. Subsequent surveys showed that the bridge was sinking an inch every eight years, and by 1924 the east side had sunk some three to four inches lower than the west side. Clearly the bridge would eventually have to be removed and replaced.\n\nIn 1967, to many peopleâ€™s astonishment, Rennieâ€™s bridge was put up for sale and, to more astonishment, was bought on 18th April 1968 by the Missourian entrepreneur and oilman Robert P McCulloch for $2,460,000. Under no illusion that he had bought Tower Bridge (as some papers mischievously reported) he moved it piece by piece to Lake Havasu City Arizona â€“ all 10,276 granite blocks individually numbered.\n\nI think it looks great â€¦\n\nYou can read more about Lake Havasu here along with the 50th anniversary last year of the bridgeâ€™s purchase.\n\nThe London Bridge we see today was constructed between 1967 and 1972 and opened by Queen Elizabeth on 17th March 1973. I like this nighttime picture â€¦\n\nNow there are security blocks in place as a result of the terrorist attack in June 2017â€¦\n\nI hope you have enjoyed these short histories of the bridges that have been known as â€˜London Bridgeâ€™. Incidentally, if you do a Google search for â€˜London Bridge imagesâ€™ you will see that, on most American sites, youâ€™ll be shown pictures of Tower Bridge!\n\nHaving had a lot of fun seeking out cherubs for an earlier blog I decided to go in search of angels.\n\nAbove the door of St Michael Cornhill is the warrior Archangel Michael â€˜disputing with Satanâ€™. It was carved by John Birnie Philip when the church was remodelled in 1858-1860.\n\nOutside the church is another sculpture of Michael brandishing a flaming sword. It is a bronze memorial to the 170 out of the 2,130 men of this parish who enrolled for military service in the First World War and died as a result.\n\nThe sculpture (by R R Goulden) was described in the Builder magazine as follows\n\nSt Michael with the flaming sword stands steadfast above the quarreling beasts which typify war, and are sliding slowly, but surely, from their previous paramount position. Life, in the shape of young children, rises with increasing confidence under the protection of the champion of right.\n\nDo go into the church, itâ€™s a serene place to visit with very attractive pews and stained glass.\n\nOf particular note on the left is the Churchwardenâ€™s pew which shows St Michael thrusting a lance into the mouth of a truly evil-looking devil. Itâ€™s a work by the eminent wood carver William Gibbs Rogers (1792-1875).\n\nWhen you come out of the church turn right and you will find that Cornhill is seriously infested with devils.\n\nItâ€™s a bloggerâ€™s dilemma when one encounters what seems to be an apocryphal explanation for something one is researching. I have taken the decision that itâ€™s OK to publish if, firstly, I make the nature of the story clear and, secondly, if it could just about be true, and thirdly if itâ€™s a great story!\n\nWhat follows seems to me to meet all the criteria.\n\nAs I walked along Cornhill one day I glanced up and saw these rather sinister figures silhouetted against the skyâ€¦\n\nCloser inspection shows them to be devils, and rather angry and malevolent ones too â€¦\n\nThey look down on St Peter upon Cornhill and are known as the Cornhill Devils. The story goes that, when plans were submitted for the late Victorian building next to the church, the rector noticed that they impinged slightly on church land and lodged a strong objection. Everything had to literally go back to the drawing board at great inconvenience and expense. The terracotta devils looking down on the entrance to the church are said to be the architectâ€™s revenge with the lowest devil bearing some resemblance to the cleric himself.\n\nOnward now towards the Tower of London via Hart Street.\n\nTwo trumpeting spandrel angels face one another over the doors of St Olave, Hart Street.\n\nYou can read more about this historic church in my earlier blog Samuel Pepys and his â€˜own churchâ€™.\n\nThis angel by the door of All Hallows by the Tower holds a shield bearing the cross of St Andrew. Above is the crossed sword emblem of the Diocese of London.\n\nFleet street is always great to visit given the vast range of subjects to explore.\n\nInside the door of St Dunstan in the West, Fleet Streetâ€¦\n\nThe plaque reads:\n\nThe foundation stone of this Church was laid on the 27th day of July 1831 and consecrated to the worship of Almighty God on the 31st day of January 1833: John Shaw, Architect who died July 30th 1832, the 12th day after its external completion, and in the 57th year of his age. To his memory this tablet is here placed by the Inhabitants of this Parish.\n\nEver since one of my earliest blogs, Philanthropic Fountains, I have a bit of a â€˜thingâ€™ about drinking fountains so I shall digress from angels momentarily.\n\nJust outside St Dunstanâ€™s is this pretty but sadly timeworn fountain designed by John Shaw junior. The inscription is really hard to read but I believe it says â€¦\n\nThe gift of Sir James Duke Bart MP ald. of this ward\n\nThe fear of the Lord is the fountain of life\n\nElected Lord Mayor 1848\n\nMP London 1849\n\nAn Art Deco trumpeting angel called The Herald graces 85 Fleet Street. The sculpture is by William Reid Dick and was unveiled by Sir Edwin Lutyens himself on 10 July 1939. The Times stated that The Herald was\n\nSending forth through her trumpet the news gathered from all corners of the Earth â€¦\n\nAnd finally to St Bartholomew the Great via St Paulâ€™s Cathedral.\n\nEmily Young FRBS is one of the countryâ€™s foremost stone sculptors and you can enjoy her work in the form of Angels I to V in the courtyard beside St Paulâ€™s Cathedral. I never tire of looking at them.\n\nAnd finally some more classical angels at the church of St Bartholomew the Great â€¦\n\nAnimals are everywhere in the City and, after some really nice feedback on my previous City Animals blog, I have decided to put together another selection.\n\nFirst up is this magnificent leaping fox. It appears on the exquisite Grade II listed Art Deco shopfront of the Fox company, who manufactured and repaired umbrellas. Mr Fox opened his first shop in the City in 1868 but this shop dates from 1935. You can still purchase a classy Fox umbrella if you go to their website, but the shop is now a wine bar.\n\nItâ€™s easy to understand why lion heads have been chosen to adorn so many late Victorian and early 20th Century buildings. They are fierce, brave, noble, the king of the beasts and, of course, immediately recognisable as a symbol of Great Britain in the heyday of Empire.\n\nOnce surrounded by the throbbing printing presses of Fleet Street newspapers, Gough Square is today a quiet haven off the noisy main road. Now known as Dr Johnsonâ€™s House, 17 Gough Square was built by one Richard Gough, a City wool merchant, at the end of the seventeenth century. It is the only survivor from a larger development and Dr Johnson lived here from 1748 to 1759 whilst compiling his famous disctionary.\n\nNearby, Johnsonâ€™s most famous cat, Hodge, is remembered by this attractive bronze by John Bickley which was unveiled by the Lord Mayor, no less, in 1997. Hodge sits atop a copy of the dictionary and alongside a pair of empty oyster shells. Oysters were very affordable then and Johnson would buy them for Hodge himself. James Boswell, in his Life of Johnson, explained why:\n\nI never shall forget the indulgence with which he treated Hodge, his cat: for whom he himself used to go out and buy oysters, lest the servants having that trouble should take a dislike to the poor creature\n\nPeople occasionally put coins in the shell for luck and every now and then Hodge is given a smart bow tie of pink lawyersâ€™ ribbon.\n\nAnd from a famous cat to mysterious mice. Nibbling a piece of cheese, they add charm to a building in Philpot Lane off Eastcheap and have been described (rather nicely, I think) as Londonâ€™s smallest sculpture. Even though they have been repainted they are still a bit hard to find â€“ so I am not saying precisely where they are, and hopefully you will enjoy looking for them. One theory is that the builders in 1862 were pestered by mice who persistently ransacked their lunch packs, so they left this little informal tribute. Another is that they commemorate a man who died during the construction of the nearby Monument to the Great Fire. Mice had eaten his lunch, but he accused a fellow worker by mistake, and fell to his death in the fight that followed. As to the true story behind the little rodents, your guess is as good as mine.\n\nAnd now another cat.\n\nHanging signs were once a major feature of Londonâ€™s streets and were encouraged by Charles I in order to help people find their way around at a time when many could not read. Needless to say, they became immensely popular with businesses, and proliferated to such an extent that they posed a threat to life and limb in times of storm and windy weather. When, in 1718, one brought about the collapse of an entire building frontage and killed four people it was obvious something had to be done. Nonetheless but it was not until 1762 that businesses were forced to remove them and fix them to shopfronts instead â€“ just as we see today. The Cat and Fiddle sign in Lombard Street harks back to a tavern of that name but was only erected in 1902, along with other replicas, to celebrate the coronation of Edward VII.\n\nAnd finally, this stunning black horse is part of the 2017 â€˜Sculpture in the Cityâ€™ project. It is at the corner of Bishopsgate and Wormwood Street,\n\nI really like The Gherkin a.k.a. 30 St Mary Axe and itâ€™s interesting to recall that when it was completed in 2003 it dominated that part of the City. Now itâ€™s sad to see soaring new office developments beginning to surround it so itâ€™s unique shape is gradually being hidden from view. When it was finished it was for a while informally known as The Swiss Re building, after the company that commissioned it for their London headquarters, but some wag said it looked like â€˜an erotic gherkinâ€™ and the description stuck. Itâ€™s probably a shame for the company that their award-winning building had its name hijacked like this, even though they no longer own it.\n\nAnyway, you may be wondering what the connection is with the magnificent Art Deco shipâ€™s prow in the photograph above. Bear with me.\n\nThe Gherkin is built on the site of the old Baltic Exchange, which was eventually demolished as a result of an IRA bomb in 1992. The clearing of the area to provide an open space around the Gherkin opened up for the first time a new view of Holland House in Bury Street. This was at one time one of the narrowest streets in the City but the west side was demolished to open up the Gherkin â€˜piazzettaâ€™ (the name for a little piazza, Iâ€™m told). So the Holland House architect originally designed the building to be viewed obliquely.\n\nHolland House is fascinating for a number of reasons. For example, it was built in 1916 right in the middle of the First World War and the year of the Somme. The Dutch company Wm. H. MÃ¼ller who commissioned it were big in shipping, steel and mining. In its feature on the building, the journal Building Design comments as follows: â€˜The company thrived in the neutrality of the Netherlands â€¦ and there were scarcely any British clients who could, or would, invest in such a large city building. The glazed terracotta bricks (made in Delft) were sent to London in the firmâ€™s ships and given priority over other cargoesâ€™. It is also the only building in London by Hendrik Petrus Bertage, the foremost Dutch architect of the 20th Century and is one of the first in London to have a steel framed structure.\n\nBut what about the ship!\n\nWalk around to the south east corner of the building, step back and admire this brave vessel plunging through the waves towards you, the funnel smoking impressively. Itâ€™s a granite structure by the Dutch artist J. Mendes da Costa and reflects the companyâ€™s main business of shipping.\n\nI love this story about the shipâ€™s positioning.\n\nApparently the company owner, Helene KrÃ¶ller-MÃ¼ller, had wished to buy the whole of the Bury Street corner, but had been thwarted by the adjacent owners who refused to sell. As a consequence, Holland House is broken into two sections, and it has been suggested that the aggressive prow of the ship was intended to â€˜cock a snookâ€™ at the neighbours."
