        "text": "While you're eating roast pork at Gloria Estefan's restaurant, Larios, on Ocean Drive, you can impress your friends with your knowledge of art deco.\n\nAll you really need to know is this: The art deco buildings in Miami Beach had three influences - cruise ships, the French world exposition in 1926 and the turn-of-the-century German philosophy of no-frills architecture.\n\nFirst, the maritime inspiration. The porthole windows, curved metal rails, flags and smokestacks on buildings came from the big ocean liners that docked here. One of the best examples is the Welcome Center building on Ocean Drive at 10th Street. The back of the building looks like the bow of a ship moving out to sea.\n\nThe second influence was the ornate decorations from the French Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts in 1926. An example is the \"frozen fountain\" low relief on many buildings.\n\nThe German influence was the straight, severe lines of the \"machine age.\"\n\nYou could spend a week inspecting all the buildings in the district. Or 30 minutes.\n\nHere's a quick tour - all the buildings are on Ocean Drive near the Welcome Center.\n\nThe Park Central Hotel (between Sixth and Seventh streets), fabulously renovated in 1985, was the first hotel to be returned to its original splendor. (Miami Beach was decaying in the '60s and '70s.) Built in 1937, it was the hangout for such Hollywood stars as Clark Gable and Rita Hayworth. Giorgio Armani stays here. So does author Anne Rice (along with her fictional French vampire Lestat).\n\nThe Avalon Hotel, on the northwest corner of Seventh Street and Ocean Drive, has its share of celebs - one of the Spice Girls checked in two weeks ago. This streamlined deco building has stark square columns. The 1955 Olds 88 convertible out front has been the hotel's mascot for nine years. (It still runs.)\n\nAt the Waldorf Towers, 860 Ocean Drive, check out the round glass tower that looks like a lighthouse or a bridge on a ship.\n\nVersace Villa, Ocean Drive and 11th Street, is a Mediterranean Revival extravaganza in the center of the deco district. The owner, Gianni Versace, was gunned down last year in front of the black gates. This is where the tour buses stop and block traffic.\n\nThe Tides hotel, between 12th and 13th streets, was the last big Ocean Drive hotel to be renovated. It opened May last year, and is the hippest place to stay. It's a severe art deco monolith. Notice the porthole windows.\n\nAt the Cardozo Hotel, don't miss the coral balusters and terrazzo floors. And look out for the Estefans, who eat at the restaurant occasionally.\n\nIf you go\n\nTours: Art Deco Walking Tours leave the Art Deco Welcome Center, on Ocean Drive at 10th Street, every Thursday evening at 6:30 p.m. and Saturday at 10:30 a.m. Buy tickets, which are $10, at the Welcome Center. Tours are 90 minutes. Call (305) 672-2014."
