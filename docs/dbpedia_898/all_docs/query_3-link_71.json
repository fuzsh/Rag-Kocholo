        "text": "WASHINGTON — On the edge of the historic Anacostia neighborhood here there is a very ugly bridge.\n\nIt once linked Capitol Hill to a freeway that headed to Southern Maryland over the Anacostia River, but had little inherent value to the neglected, largely African-American region through which it passed.\n\nBut city officials, community activists and private donors have plans to transform the 11th Street Bridge — a previous version was once traversed daily by Frederick Douglass — into a park that would link some of the district’s tourist-oriented neighborhoods with one of its final frontiers in the march toward gentrification.\n\nAs with park projects in other cities, the Anacostia park project is seeded with hope and some trepidation as schematic drawings inch toward reality. For many impoverished areas that have been bolstered by green spaces and the ensuing development around them, the rewards of recreation can be a mixed blessing. The $45 million project — which will rely on private donations on top of a $14.5 million commitment from the city — is coming together at a time of political upheaval in the Ward 8 section of the city, which includes Anacostia. It follows closely on the death of the ward’s controversial but locally beloved councilman, the former mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., which along with economic uncertainty has left residents anxious about what comes next.\n\n“Gentrification has already rolled into Ward 8,” said Brenda Richardson, a community activist and a former aide to Mr. Barry. “It isn’t always an easy thing to do to talk to this community because we are always in battle mode to fight for what we want.”\n\nThe park would become a recreation area of both national significance and of rare benefit to Ward 8, just southeast of Capitol Hill and the Nationals’ ballpark, and aid in restoring the Anacostia River, a fetid, often forgotten tributary to its elegant sister, the Potomac.\n\nIn its previous form, the 11th Street Bridge was one of two freeway bridges built at the site in the 1960s. Those bridges were replaced recently with three new structures, two freeway bridges and one for local traffic: the park will be built on the piers of the old freeway bridge. The park is similar in its aim to the Atlanta BeltLine, which turned an old railroad line into a bike path, and Seattle’s Olympic Sculpture Park, in which a polluted parcel in an industrial neighborhood was transformed into a natural space run by the Seattle Art Museum. It could be developmentally parallel to the razing of the Cabrini-Green public housing project, economically boosting an area of Chicago long ignored by commerce.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
