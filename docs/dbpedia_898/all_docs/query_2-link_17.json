        "text": "Dubbed as the first major multi-span concrete bridge in the state of Oklahoma, the 11th Street Arkansas River Bridge is one of the beautiful examples of Art Deco heritage in Tulsa that also coincides with the city’s rich Route 66 cultural heritage. The bridge was constructed in 1916-1917 to replace the previous wooden bridge and accommodate vehicles crossing the Arkansas River. It is 1,470 feet long, making it one of the longest concrete structures in the Midwest.\n\nThe 11th Street Arkansas River Bridge was engineered by Harrington, Howard, and Ash of Kansas City and was built by the Missouri Valley Bridge and Iron Company. The bridge features sweeping architectural elements and has 18 arched spans. A monolithic railroad track runs down the center, flanked by vehicular lanes on either side. In 1929, the original lights and balustrades were replaced with Art Deco lights and guard lights, incorporating ZigZag Art Deco and PWA Classical Art Deco. In 1980, the bridge was closed to vehicular traffic and made a pedestrian bridge."
