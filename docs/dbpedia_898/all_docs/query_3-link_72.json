        "text": "Having become a solar nerd (if an excel spreadsheet counts), it’s interesting to see the power consumption figures in the comments for Max’s purpose design. I calculated we’re using about 50KwH / Sq m / pa in a leaky 1800s house and felt smug. Then I remembered the tanks full of heating oil on top! The trade off of fresh air v warmth in the design is interesting but we can feel the drafts so I think we’ve got fresh air covered! The attention to seasonality is interesting too. Especially considering the changes in temperatures we’re experiencing in Kent. Conclusion I drew for our house is 1) buy better insulating, intelligently controlled blinds and 2) get better controls to use more of our excess 2 megawatts pa of solar for the car. Pumping solar back into the grid is only paying us a third of cheap rate, a tenth of the day tariff so we’d be better off using it if we can. I also wonder if there’s a way to use our old house fresh air draughts better in conjunction with heat recovery?

The site's new planning framework will facilitate a transformative mixed-use development that is visionary in scope and grounded in community benefits. In particular, the site's building height and FSR have improved to 46 metres (from 14.5 metres) and 5:1 (from 1.5:1). The existing streetscape of New South Head Road features inconsistent typologies, fragmented built scales and low pedestrian amenities. Development of the sites will provide a much-needed opportunity to enhance the consistency of built form along the northern side of New South Head Road, as well as benefit the streetscape. Find out where the project is by subscribing today to our weekly development journal here: https://lnkd.in/gzNEX4k5\n\nNYC's concrete jungle is about to get a cozy makeover! With a blueprint for change in 2024, commercial spaces will transform into affordable homes. But this isn't just about buildings; it's about people. The city's experts are analyzing the landscape and understanding the community's needs. Planners, architects, and engineers are piecing together a puzzle of zoning laws and design to create spaces that are more than just houses - they're homes. Partnerships are forming, and funding is fueling the dream. With sustainability and accessibility at its core, this is a symphony of progress with each brick and beam bringing the city closer to its goal. New York City is setting a precedent, a timeline of transformation, and a story of a city that turns dreams into doorways.\n\n#AgeInPlace on a budget? In cities lacking #agesafe #housing, innovative steps are being taken to #designspaces affordably. #Retirees aiming to revamp #olderhomes may encounter complications with rules, permits and bringing homes up to code. Solutions like using #affordable materials and forward thinking smart design can make the process smoother. #Revamping now can meet modern needs without breaking the bank later. Older homes demonstrate that aging in place is achievable through creative design and attention to detail. Become a member of the National Aging In Place Council (NAIPC) to help us create change in our #agingcommunities.

From towering skyscrapers to cozy homes, modular construction offers unprecedented flexibility and efficiency. The beauty of this approach lies in its adaptability, allowing us to dream big and build even bigger. With modular construction, we can transform urban landscapes, build sustainable communities, and even create innovative spaces for work and play. The sky's the limit when it comes to what we can achieve, as long as we let our imagination lead the way. Let's embrace this revolutionary approach to construction and push the boundaries of what's possible. How many things can you find wrong in the picture below? #LetYourImaginationBuildTheFuture #ModularConstruction #ModularHousing #Modular #ADU #CFS #prefab\n\nHighbridge, a new residential tower in the Bronx set to begin construction in 2024 and open in 2027, is an all-electric, passive house design by Magnusson Architecture and Planning PC. When complete, the project will far exceed market norms for quality and amenities while drastically reducing emissions compared to baseline code compliance—all while providing affordable homes for hundreds of the most vulnerable New Yorkers. Highbridge is among the standout projects recognized by NYSERDA's #BuildingsofExcellence Competition, which seeks to jump-start a major shift toward climate-friendly construction in the state by supporting the development of architecturally significant, low-carbon multifamily residential buildings.
