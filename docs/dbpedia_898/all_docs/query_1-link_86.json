        "text": "Often times the story of the New York Art Deco skyscraper ends with the Empire State Building. It was the tallest of its era, and it ranks well among a lavish group. Though it set records for construction speed, it nonetheless languished without tenants for years after its opening. “The Empty State Building,” some called it, emphasizing the Depression economics that followed the jazz age extravagance and optimism.\n\nWhat if the Irwin Trust at 1 Wall Street were considered the end of the era instead? In a way, it makes a better bookend, and Ralph Walker, its chief designer, a better protagonist for the era.\n\nWalker had arguably begun the era of Art Deco (an anachronistic term, applied post facto) skyscrapers when he designed the Barclay Vesey Building for the New York Telephone Company. He began in 1921, and completed the building in 1926.\n\nA newly gargantuan structure for one of the era’s most definitively modern and growing corporations, the phone company, Walker’s skyscraper was a harbinger. It derived much of its distinctive shape from the New York Zoning Ordinance of 1916, which said essentially that the higher tall buildings rose, the narrower they had to be. The building owed a bit of its distinctive setback shape to these rules and most of it to Walker’s artful sense of composition.\n\nLikewise, Walker had a relatively novel and very timely approach to architectural ornament. Instead of the highly sculptural columns and cornices or finials and buttresses of traditional building (which numerous architects struggled to update), he liked to express ornament as shallow reliefs molded into cast stone. His images were not historic, but rather animal and vegetable. They became more geometric and abstract with advancing years.\n\nThe abandonment of historical forms was something that historians would later identify in Paris’s International Decorative Arts Exposition of 1925. In fact Walker began the Barclay Vesey designs before that fair took place. He was a singular talent whose design sensibilities did not reveal obvious sources.\n\nThe Barclay Vesey Building was a hit, so impressive and popular that architectural revolutionary Le Corbusier used it as the frontispiece of the 1927 American edition of his perennial classic Towards a New Architecture. Le Corbusier was actually coming out against the sort of architecture that Walker produced, advocating instead for box-like volumes and ornament-free surfaces. But the power and originality of Walker’s building could not be denied.\n\nShould Barclay Vesey be the building of the day? Perhaps.\n\nExcept that Walker produced a series of similar structures, often for AT&T, in which he honed his capacity for heroic, sculptural setback massing. He refined his ability to make a brick curtain wall seem as though it were folded and crenelated with the elegance of a Japanese fan. Finally, with the help of decorators and crafts people, he developed programs of ornamental sculpture, mosaics, and furniture that epitomized the luxury of the era.\n\nHis last, best building of the skyscraper style was Irving Trust at 1 Wall Street, executed between 1928 and 1931. The building, which is currently the home of BNY Mellon, was always the home of an investment bank, though they occupied abut a third of it and leased the rest to high prestige professional firms.\n\nInstead of brick, this structure is clad in limestone, which is detailed for an absolutely smooth surface. The enclosure on such steel frame structures is called curtain wall, because it does not support the building. In this case, though, the stone is articulated with a stunning vocabulary of pleats, flutes, and scallops that might be compared to an actual curtain. But this is no jokey reference. Walker’s walls perfectly synthesize the otherwise contradictory senses of rock solid permanence and soaring, streamlined motion. The sculpted setbacks of the Barclay-Vesey Building from just a few years earlier now seem clunky by comparison, as Irving Trust seems to telescope upward with a fluid mechanical ease. The assured consistency of its beautiful limestone sheathing makes the black, white, and metal histrionics of the Chrysler Building (my favorite yesterday and tomorrow), seem brash and uncontrolled by comparison. Chrysler is a better top. This is a better building.\n\nThe inside is full of luxurious corporate offices and lobbies, among which the “Red Room” is the most remarkable. A collaboration among Walker, interior designer P.C. Smith, and mosaicist Hildreth Meière, it is an expressionist explosion of tesserae in gold figures against a red background. The color of flames notwithstanding, it is a heavenly masterwork of saturated color and line.\n\nThe building opened in 1931 with the poor timing of befuddled plutocrats who couldn’t believe that their own extravagance was not relieving the economic disasters that they themselves had created. You could hardly blame social and economic egalitarians for hating overwrought banking buildings.\n\nBut you have to love the scrappy contractor’s son from Providence who invented America’s secular cathedral. And you can’t ignore that Frank Lloyd Wright, another architect whose work looked nothing like Walker’s, called him “the only other honest architect in America.”\n\nThe Europeans who grabbed the rudder of America’s architectural tastes in the next generation did everyone a disservice when they disdained Walker and his generation in favor of Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, and Mies van der Rohe as if the exuberant American and dour European approaches couldn’t coexist. (Hint: they did for a very short moment at the 1933 Chicago World’s Fair).\n\nQuestionable financial institutions will come and go, but ideally, they will leave behind the Irving Trust Building and its ability to speak to talent and artistry in architecture more than any financial shenanigans.\n\nLikewise, generations of ornament-free buildings killed the ability of American industry or craft to create work like Walker’s. Now though, digital fabrication techniques are making anything possible. The need to restore and maintain buildings of this kind will surely feed a resurgence in their popularity.\n\nBorn in 1632, Christopher Wren is best known as the architect of St. Paul’s in London, itself a complex intersection of rationalist geometries, structural sleights of hand, and classical facades concealing Gothic plans and techniques. For that matter, St. Stephen’s Walbrook, of Wren’s 51 (or so) churches, is one of the most charming in its surprising ability to make a seemingly oversized plaster dome rest with unanticipated comfort on what seem like a few casually placed columns.\n\nBut it is at the Sheldonian, his first major project, where Wren weaves the multivalent qualities that most lucidly express his architectural hand and mind. The theater is the ceremonial hall for Oxford University. Students officially matriculate and graduate there, with all variety of official ceremonies and assemblies taking place in between, as they have since its construction. The gift of Gilbert Sheldon, who was Warden of All Souls College then the Archbishop of Canterbury, the building seemed necessary as a proprietary secular space to replace borrowed ecclesiastical ones.\n\nWren, meanwhile, was famously not even an intentional architect at first. He began as an astronomer and mathematician, fields in which he made a significant reputation as a young man–Newton and Pascal admired his work. He became Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College, London in 1657, and Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford in 1661.\n\nArchitecture was for him as it was for Jefferson, a gentleman’s pursuit that suited a curious intellect. But it would also combine well with his notoriety in royal and aristocratic circles. He was invited to examine and suggest repairs to St. Pauls’ as early as 1661. Complete architectural commissions were soon to follow. He became Surveyor of the King’s Works in 1669 and was officially appointed to redesign St. Paul’s in 1673, following the notorious and fateful fire of 1666, which brought him those dozens of church commissions as well. His career would fill with other major royals commissions, yet the Sheldonian Theater has a particular blissful clarity.\n\nIn the Sheldonian Theater, Wren was all to happy demonstrate the breadth of his knowledge. Clearly, he had studied the forms of Roman examples such as the Theater of Marcellus, whose D-shaped plan and sloping tiers of seating were instructive. Likewise, he had clearly examined Italian examples of Alberti, Palladio, and Maderno in layering a three bay façade over a five bay façade (or was it seven?), complete with keystones, arches, swags, and foliated Corinthian capitals. But a pronounced British fussiness persists. It seems more the product of intention than of lack of exactitude.\n\nIn the north theater side of the building, his precise, geometricizing tendencies materialize in a faceted rather than purely curved enclosure. Likewise, though his grasp of classical architecture is apparent in the combination of arches and rustication, the partially blind windows at ground level are unusual, and the oval dormer windows at the top, now gone, were even moreso.\n\nThe roof was a particular tour de force, with a network of lateral and radiused truss girders, which allow the interior to be column free (except for the balconies). Ceiling murals, by Robert Streeter, have recently been restored to great acclaim.\n\nWren’s philosophy that architecture was a combination of customary beauty and rational beauty is a staple of French theory of this time, learned from texts as well as his travels to Paris in 1665.\n\nThe man who was best known for his cathedral and his churches was in fact a rationalist whose works were at least as resonant in secular applications. The fluent architectural classicist spoke that language from the viewpoint of expression rather than simply rule. The master architect and builder came to the profession and enriched it only by having a deeply universal sense of the relevance of science through astronomy and its applicability to all human endeavors. The poetic Neo-Platonic musings of Renaissance architecture maintained their beauty while taking on assured astronomical precision in Wren’s Baroque.\n\nIn a profession when so many admired designers through the ages have created beautiful works that are compromised by structural deficiencies, it is a delight to see one that is durable and lasting precisely because the designer built it with an innovative (and expensive) structure and not despite that phenomenon.\n\nThe end of Wren’s epitaph is “Reader, if you seek his monument, look around you.” That could refer to St. Pauls’ where he is buried and greater London where so many of his churches remain.\n\nIt might just as easily have said, reader, if you seek his monument, consider the advancement of architecture. Its status as science and art in a secular world is more vivid in the Sheldonian Theater than it was in any building before.\n\nThe student comment was as scathing as it was ill-considered. It was to the effect, “I don’t see why you make all of us do the exact same white cube exercise.” I think it’s in the first year that all the students design a cube-shaped house that is something like ten or twelve meters in each dimension. Even I will admit that to review so many projects of such similarity gets to be repetitive when the students don’t have remarkable talent. (When someone comes along who is remarkably good, the seemingly monotonous project is suddenly a joy).\n\nAll the while, the idea is clear. It is useful (in many minds) to learn some of the fundamentals of design for space and form in architecture through an exercise that manipulates such variables in their most pure form. It’s like learning to read using the same alphabet and a vocabulary of a small number of words. A true literary talent will be able to produce poetry from the most simple of means. A true architectural talent will do likewise, with only white walls and right angles. This is certainly the case for Sou Fujimoto.\n\nLook at House N. This may be as close as you can get to a student design exercise in piece of actual built work. The 150 square meter house in Oita, Japan is constructed of three pristine white boxes of progressively smaller sizes, each nested within the next. The intent is to create a gradation of spaces from the public street to the private innermost living spaces. Walls and ceilings with the same vocabulary of rectangular openings create willful ambiguities of layering, as do wispy trees planted in interior spaces. A great paradox of architecture is that the ease of a minimal model to scale in the studio becomes a great labor of expertise and precision to eliminate extraneous elements in the built work.\n\nIn a project such as his children’s psychological institute, the sense of engaging a rigorously orthogonal and unremittingly bleached palette for composition continues. It is beautiful in the photographs and again, elegantly minimal. For a private home for a willing client who guides the process all the way through and lives with the results of their own choices, such unwavering restraint could make some sense. For an institutional setting for children, the practice seems a little bit more questionable.\n\nOther projects are farther reaching ruminations on systems of design and construction in relationship to the greater environment. One of my favorites is the Final Wooden House. It’s almost as if he thought of it while playing Jenga, realizing that pulling a wooden block from the rising stack might create a structural imbalance, but it results in a poetic architectural space at the same time. What would happen if you changed the Jenga tower from 3 blocks wide to a larger number and then pulled pieces out with more of an emphasis on architectural living space? This house.\n\nThere is plenty of contemporary architecture that pursues complexity at its extremes for its own sake. One of the continuing themes in Fujimoto’s architecture is that the essential elements and concept for a building can be simple to the point of minimalism, but the manner in which such elements are recombined or interconnected can be very complex indeed.\n\nOne project was for a busstop in Krumbach, Austria as part of a series of seven by renowned architects. Fujimoto’s project is a small network of slender vertical poles, reminiscent of a stand of cat-tails as much as anything. Within these, a series of steps rises, more for the purpose of exploring space and views than for much of anything having to do with waiting for a bus, though I suppose you could sit on them. Actually, the project apparently ran afoul of Austrian building codes, but it persists as an essay in system and space, of architectural folly in the best sense.\n\nFujimoto designed the Serpentine Pavilion for 2013, the annual temporary piece of contemporary exhibition architecture in London’s Kensington Garden that is awarded as a prestige commission to a deserving architect.\n\nFujimoto’s project is in essence a three dimensional grid of slender white poles, but the geometry of presence and absence was articulated irregularly to give the impression of some kind of cross between a cloud and a tree canopy. The project was very well received, widely photographed, and broadly praised. Without seeing the structure in person, though, it can be difficult to discern where it starts and ends, which parts were suitable for sitting and climbing and which were not.\n\nIn discussing his architecture, Fujimoto talks about working in an arena between architecture and nature. From a purely formal standpoint, he does in deed combine rigorous geometry with a more picturesque sense of naturalism, so the assessment seems right on point. On the other hand, in an era in which any and all architectural projects can be conceived with a view to environmental conscientious in material selection and energy use, Fujimoto (to the extent researched thus far), does not engage such issues as a priority. Surely he could.\n\nJapanese architectural culture generally seems to produce an abundant supply of such projects. Restrained in geometry and material palette. Absolutely abstract in conception and implementation. They also seem to have construction techniques and standards that allow such unforgiving and precise projects to reach completion in apparently flawless fashion. It seems as though the best of these will be the ones that find ways to be human rather than overwhelming.\n\nArchitecture seems to have no shortage of beautiful forms and images. The new generation will move the profession forward most successfully as it synthesizes global moral and material needs in close harmony with esthetic ones.\n\nIt was common for architecture magazines in the early part of the twentieth century, to publish travel sketches of architects who had been abroad. The practice goes back centuries, first to the initial explorations of the Renaissance, then to the broader tradition of the Grand Tour. The Enlightenment-driven archaeologists of the 18th century gave way to a full culture of traveling in which English and French travelers would cross the continent studying ancient remains in particular. Some were more leisurely, others were more studious. The former bought souvenir images as grand as those by Canaletto. The latter made their own study drawings to form the basis of their later architectural or artistic practices. Various national academies in Rome institutionalized academic study there.\n\nInto the twentieth century, there was a much greater availability of photography, yet drawing did and does persist as a method of expression, documentation, and art. You publish images.\n\nIn the 1890s, rising young architect Bertram Goodhue produced a series of travel sketches and accompanying drawings that he submitted to literary magazines for publication. The story goes that his works were rejected when the editors could not find the named locations on a map.\n\nArchitectural magazines had no such worry. Both the Brickbuilder and Architectural Review published a series of sketches and accounts that included the Cathedral of St. Kavin at Traumburg and Saint Catherine in the Italian Hill Town of Monteventosa. The problem, or perhaps no problem at all, was not simply that the architect had never been to those towns–he had never left the North American continent–in fact the towns didn’t exist.\n\nIt is an amusing anecdote with an overtone of fooling ones friends and tricking the experts. Indeed, it is a trope in the tales of lives of talented artists that there is some manner of foolery that is an indication of their talent. Apelles, the Greek painter, legendarily fooled birds with his paintings of fruit. And Michelangelo fooled experts by making sculpture that was passed off as ancient when it was really new. But imagining an entire village? Perhaps this was unprecedented.\n\nThe issue cuts across social and academic issues in architecture. In those days, one’s ability to cultivate authority as an architect, however dependent on talent and education, also relied on the wealth and standing to travel through Europe. That’s why wealthy patrons frequently underwrote travel and study for the talented but impecunious.\n\nLikewise, the idea that architectural practice was driven by the study and copy of recognized models is an oversimplification, but it is nonetheless true that many architects and historians viewed the world as a finite collection of buildings from which a smaller group percolated to the top as most laudable examples of study and emulation.\n\nFor an architect to fabricate a beautiful building and pass it off as an established landmark worthy of study, then for it to turn out to be imaginary, well, that cut to the quick of the epistemology of architecture itself, to say nothing of the structures of authority. Clearly, the two were tightly intertwined.\n\nGoodhue was one of the architects of his generation who had been steeped in historical styles but worked near the end of his career to incorporate abstraction and certain elements of modernism, even if it was not of the pure European variety.\n\nThere are those who call this transitional or eclectic architecture, and I’m very wary of both of those words. It is always possible and perhaps even necessary and desirable to synthesize the influences of a number of different architectural styles. Indeed, the sense of a pure and singular architectural style is rare and perhaps impossible, or much less possible than adherents claim.\n\nGoodhue’s great masterwork was the Nebraska State Capitol, one of the great and massive temples to American Civic culture in the vast landscape. It still depends to a large degree on hints of byzantium and other medieval inflections, even as it takes on a significantly Modernist tone of streamlining and abstraction. The healthy and pervasive infusion of symbolic sculptural and ornament, to say nothing of the ecclesiastical tower and cruciform plan, mean that it will always be interpreted as at least historically revivalist to a significant degree.\n\nWe still have a tendency to consider Modernists to be true originals and revivalists to be some lesser stripe. There is a temptation to say that Goodhue demonstrated with Monteventosa and Traumburg that he could be an original designer as much as modernists of his own or later days could be. Or, maybe even better, he brought the concept of originality itself into question for a broader range of generations than just his own.\n\nYou could be excused for making a correlation between presidential architecture and American money. The Lincoln Memorial was on the reverse of the penny for fifty years, and Monticello was on the reverse of the nickel for something like sixty.\n\nSo where does that put the McKinley Memorial? Actually, McKinley is the face of the rarely used five hundred dollar bill, but unlike the old two dollar bill, which had Jefferson on the front and Monticello on the back into the 1960s, the five hundred dollar bill simply has graphics on the back and no building. Too bad, because it could just as easily have been the McKinley Memorial in just the same way that the Lincoln memorial is on the back of the five dollar bill.\n\nWhy the obsession with architectural representation on money, as well as other varieties of coins and medals? On one hand, it is no more than a convergence of my childhood interest in coin collecting with my adult interest in architecture.\n\nBut it has led me to study what can be reasonably called architectural exonumia, or medals and tokens with buildings on them. Because of the expectation that heads of state and august architecture correlate with actual monetary value, it’s interesting to see what happens when the same components fail to do so, or do so in different ways than we expect.\n\nSuch is the case with a medal of William McKinley with his memorial on the reverse. McKinley was president from 1897 to 1901. He was assassinated infamously at Buffalo’s Panama Pacific Exposition six months into his second term. As President he was noted for successful prosecution of the Spanish American War and his endorsement of protective tariffs. Also, notably, he was in favor of keeping the United States on the Gold Standard.\n\nMcKinley began his adult life and his law practice in Canton, Ohio, so that’s where his memorial is located. The design, by architect Howard Van Buren Magonigle, was chosen in national competition from over sixty designs and completed in 1907. The New York-based architect designed the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, and he collaborated with sculptor Augustus Piccirilli on the Monument to the U.S.S. Maine in Columbus Circle, and the Fireman’s Memorial on Riverside Drive. He designed a number of small funerary works as well, but he is otherwise fairly obscure.\n\nThe structure itself is essentially a dome-topped cylinder, sited at the top of a hill with a long axis leading up to it. The architecture is certainly derived from the classical tradition with its arched entry and pronounced cornice, but the absence of any actual columns is fairly unusual. It seems as though Magonigle is searching for the kind of abstracted classicism that would come a couple of decades later in the work of architects such as Bertram Goodhue and Paul Cret.\n\nAlso, it looks pretty good on the commemorative medal, which flattens the appearance of the shape and perhaps clarifies the proportions. Alas, in photographs, the building tends to look lumpy and comparatively less graceful.\n\nOddly, though, the medal is silver plated, and it seems to tarnish, scratch, and corrode fairly easily. This seems unfortunate and especially ironic for a president whose platform included the gold standard as a priority. No gold medal for McKinley?\n\nLincoln’s memorial, a subject of much heated debate, wasn’t underway until 1913 or so. It was finished in 1922. Henry Bacon, the architect, hardly remains in cultural memory. The building, which was originally the subject of some controversy, has only become iconic over the years. It’s curious how Lincoln, one of the most revered of presidents, is on the least valuable piece of money.\n\nHarding’s memorial was designed by Henry Hornbostel and completed around 1931. It too has a commemorative medal.\n\nContrary to the old street slang, not all “dead presidents” are money.\n\nThis building is viscerally beautiful. Delight, said Vitruvius, in now-shopworn fashion, is the third necessary quality of architecture. Yet even after millennia of people saying so, the capacity of a building, particularly a simple one, to cause delight is a remarkable thing. A pile of bricks caused me to draw a breath, a clear indication both that it is art and I am human.\n\nThe building itself is a dorm complex for Somerville College at Oxford. The site is an unusually narrow one, pushed hard against the existing college to the south, with a walking path to remain immediately to the north. There is the promise of substantial redevelopment on the opposite side (including more work to come from McLaughlin). With a program for dorms, the site leaves barely enough room for a building a single room wide with a narrow corridor. The context includes Medieval and English Renaissance architecture.\n\nThere is a strong argument that these new buildings are completely Modern. Built around a concrete frame, they have essentially only brick and oak as their exterior materials. In fact, the oak as enclosure for both the dormitory rooms and the stairway towers is entirely prefabricated. Even in the era of CNC milling, there is no extraneous figuration (for those of you who may be afraid to say decoration or ornament). Also, the unrelentingly orthogonal geometry allows for no suggestion of historical elements such as gables or dormers, or even any ambitious geometry in the building plan. (The issue of a lantern is perhaps separate).\n\nThere is a flicker of Lou Kahn’s Exeter Library, particularly in the dorm room modules, as I think the architect has commented, without saying it is intentional. Much more remarkable is the capacity that the vertical elements have to call to the yearning otherworldly quality of Gothic architecture. Finned, wooden vitrines that fit snugly within and then reach proudly above their brick enclosing walls, these are really just stair towers. But they exemplify what is McLaughlin’s now habitual practice (see Bishop King Edward Chapel, Oxford) of creating stunningly ruminative ecclesiastical spaces with minimally articulated wood fins and judicious use of clerestory lighting.\n\nNikolaus Pevsner’s spirit floats through as well, since he famously described Oxford’s phenomenon of well-placed gateways aiming the pedestrian from one axis to the next. McLaughlin’s towers work at this urbanistic scale as well.\n\nThe aesthetic effects occur at such a persuasive intersection of the elegant and the sensible that it seems almost vulgar to ask what relation these new constructions have to historic reference. Are they Jacobean? There are certainly enough brick courses and stacked vertical windows to elicit a comparison. But the pleasure comes in a building that works with or without the potential semiotic checkmark. It’s a stark contrast to the heavy-handed visual jokesterism of post-modern reference, yet that is how we Yanks so often experienced engagement with historical context. Maybe McLaughlin is giving us Frampton’s Critical Regionalism rather than Venturi’s Both-And architecture.\n\nWe have too easily thought of historical reference and modernism as differences of kind, when they might better be approached as differences of degree, to continue to use Reiser and Umemoto’s designation. You can have plenty of historical reference, and you can have it through a variety of material, figural, typological, and tectonic means. It is not an either-or situation. Philip Johnson’s AT&T building, an emblem of Post-modernism, was really mostly a Modern skyscraper, except for its pink stone, arched entry and Chippendale top. Meanwhile Mies and Philip’s Seagram Building, the Modern icon, was to a large degree historically referential–a hexastyle temple with a false front skin on a symmetrical axis with a Renaissance palace across the street. It’s a matter of how much of what ingredient and how we can assess them precisely. The components are far more engaging and dynamic in mixture than they are in attempted isolation.\n\nMcLaughlin’s Somerville College dormitories triumph in their combination of historic palette and siting with modern articulation because they embrace restraint and timelessness over heavy-handed symbolism or fleeting fashionable approaches.\n\nThe Yale Art Gallery is one of my least favorite Louis Kahn Buildings. It may be the most over-rated.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. There are plenty of things to like about it. The new renovation is spectacular. In fact, that is one of the problems. It just reminds you how many things there are to like in addition or even in contrast to Kahn’s building.\n\nNow that Street Hall has been renovated in a way that shows off its historical fabric, it comes through with real distinction as a willfully tectonic piece of Ruskinian Gothic, thanks to P. B. Wight.\n\nSimilarly, perhaps even more so, what had seemed like the neglected oddball trecento of Egerton Swartwout’s early twentieth century Gallery has come into its own, as a tour de force of suitably monumental galleries combined with delicately sequenced circulation spaces and artful overlooks. It’s a building that understands a truly orchestral scope of spatial effects, and it has the massive walls and delicately carved traceries to back up the experience.\n\nWhile we’re at it, there is Weir Hall, the adjacent dorm and library of Jonathan Edwards College. Originally intended for Skull & Bones, it has that institution’s dour brownstone, which is not helped by the pinched site between the Bones tomb and the rest of Yale’s property, what soon became the rest of J.E.\n\nBut Weir Hall is delightfully intimate on the inside, its Taft Library providing a wonderfully domestic yet serious study space (though I can remember exploring the tight spiral staircase and other nooks and crannies when I should have been studying).\n\nA key element is that with renovations to both dorm and gallery, it is possible to go from Weir Hall out onto its court and then down a few stairs to the gallery entrance. It’s like having the Louvre as your back yard.\n\nI remember Vincent Scully talking about the sequence of art buildings along Chapel Street. From Street Hall to Swartwout’s Gallery to Kahn’s Gallery to Rudolph’s A&A. He talks about the ensemble as though it were almost inevitable. Perhaps it is less an inevitable procession of architecture than it is a remarkable exemplar of a set of consecutive eras, each represented by an outstanding version of the type.\n\nSo kahn speaks well for the austerity of that particular moment of Modernism (and indeed Tom Wolfe mocks him for it. It’s enough to make me side with Kahn on this building).\n\nIt’s not that Kahn’s building is too austere for me. I can certainly appreciate that quality in Modernism. I just don’t think that the legendary concrete space frame is that fine a piece of architecture. It is noteworthy as a formal concept. But it is not really structural. It ends up being a very cumbersome and expensive screen. Otherwise, the building is a not-entirely-distinguished stack of open floor galleries, which are nice enough, but unremarkable.\n\nActually, the stair is pretty wonderful, but even old Lou would call it a servant space.\n\nI do delight in the Yale Art Gallery. I am enthralled with its contents, and (especially with the new renovation), I am a fan of all the buildings around it. Kahn’s gallery is not bad, it’s just not remarkable.\n\nThe British Art Center across the street? That’s pretty remarkable. Maybe a different essay.\n\nDrawings and buildings have a perennial relationship, usually because drawings are often needed as instruments to make buildings. Just as often though, building makers secretly yearn for drawings for their own sake. More than a few questionable flimsy buildings have been constructed as tribute\n\nAs a result, occasionally, a willfully flimsy building will get built, as a tribute to paper architecture, or maybe a decade or two of them will arise. Other times, though, the inspiration of drawings will result in more solid and admirable architecture, as in this small museum by the Russian firm SPEECH Tschoban/Kuznetsov.\n\nThe firm has achieved notoriety in Europe over only a couple of years, underscored by participation in the Venice Biennale, but a reported current size of about two hundred architects makes them substantially busy at a level of productivity that fills a full recent issue of Architectural Review. And there’s a good showing of this project on Dezeen from May, from which these images come.\n\nThe drawings center is a compact and tidy project, bolstered by a conventional program (its a tiny museum and study center) and a flexible client–Tschoban himself. Indeed, it rings some familiar bells right away as its basic massing recalls Zaha Hadid in Cincinnati from a significantly earlier stage in her career and SANAA’s New Museum a little more recently, though the SPEECH building benefits from angled floor masses in a way that neither predecessor does. Other crucial subtleties and distinctions abound.\n\nThe site is packed into an urban square and nudged against the party wall of one rowhouse. Other nearby buildings are medieval revival industrial structures, including a brewery, being converted into cultural uses. The new structure replaces a small stable. It’s only five stories high and not quite 500 square meters in five floors, the height of the surrounding district.\n\nThe concrete, which is both highly refined and evocatively textured, could check a box for some sort of Brutalist revival, but for the just-so angularity of stacked concrete floors that consult a calendar rather than a history book for taste. Likewise, the incised patterns on the wall seem for just a moment to be a one-liner of architectural representation out of post-modernism, until closer assessment reveals more. Interestingly, an early conceptual drawing for this project is actually less subtle about the implementation of drawings that the final version is.\n\nFor just a minute there, you could almost set the way-back machine to Venturi and Scott Brown’s Seattle Museum of Art. Its complexity was welcome at the time, but their boast that they were the first to use a 7/19th fraction of a pilaster or some similar thing rang oddly hollow. Meanwhile, other critics site Herzog & de Meuron and Caruso St. John as architects making more recent use of graphic representations on the facades of their buildings.\n\nIn this case, the images come from architect Gottardo Gonzaga. The 18th century Venetian was primarily a painter and designer of stage sets who also produced fantasy drawings in the manner of his hero Piranesi. Little if any of his built work survives. Indeed, he spent his last depression-plagued years begging clients for commissions. But his remarkable drawings formed the basis of Tschobon’s collection, which has expanded to need this building.\n\nThe worst of post-modernist building as drawing gamesmanship was twee and foppish. Yet this succeeds in a way that will make observers eager to check back over the years. The drawing motifs are not overbearing. They could read simply as texture that provides well-gauged relief in the concrete surfaces. Of course closer examination reveals the unmistakable quality of hand-drawing, which has been expanded and incised into the surface. Also, these graphic elements are perspective drawings, which create a healthy tension between physical flatness and the illusion of depth. The drawings are also cut into narrow sections–though these have changing widths–and repeated as nearly-abstract motifs, so there is further healthy tension between simple texture and specific graphic representation. Some have suggested that they look like cascading sheaves of drawings.\n\nThere is yet another layer to such play, because the windows, which pierce only the first floor of the concrete (and narrow circulation areas of upper floors), take a variety of angled–dare to say Tetris block-like–rectilinear shapes. These have a recognizable but not rigid relationship to the curves in the perspective drawings of the first floor surface.\n\nJust when the viewer is entranced by the capable and subtle play of surface in concrete, the top floor caps the composition in a boldly cantilevered glass-enclosed structure. Its material contrast could not be more vivid, yet its precise alignment with the perimeter of the floor below could not be more elegant.\n\nInside, the first floor space includes paneled walls with the same incised patterns as the exterior. Upper spaces, one per floor, are not figural. And the top floor is a pure vitrine at a suitable height for the surrounding historic context.\n\nThe worst post-modern architecture failed when they made buildings into drawings. This building succeeds as a building by incorporating drawings into architecture.\n\nThis PA Award-winning Allied Works project for the National Music Centre of Canada, a winner from a 2009 competition is an adventurously articulated building simply on its own, but a couple of the study models reinforce the sense of its thoughtful architectural expression. (I have focused on a couple; in fact the multi-step process is aesthetically rich and very thoughtful through a variety of steps)\n\nEarly on, it has a grouping vertical plaster blocks, in which brass cones and cylinders have been embedded and then sheared away leaving various circular and parabolic openings and accompanying volumes at the flat sides. Plaster conveys architectural mass and brass evokes both space and sound, which is well-suited to the musical program of the building. This is a fine example of conceptual model-making.\n\nIt also seems to lead very clearly to a more specifically volumetric articulation of space, abetted by parametric modeling.\n\nThe next set of models shows what you might call a modified nine-square grid. It takes most advantage of parametric modeling in order to nudge and inflect each cell with some curvature significantly out of its potentially orthogonal form while still leaving a recognizable grid intact.\n\nIt has an additional order of complexity in the nesting of its cells. One set of four alternating cells (think of white squares on a chessboard) is connected to each other at the bottom, while a set of five alternating cells (think of black squares) are connected to each other at the top. The set of five is placed within the set of four, which the images demonstrate this lucidly. One critic called this “a continuum of exploration between solid and void.” There is a resulting sophisticated layering of material and space. It is a clever nesting of boxes within boxes, yet it has the lucidity of fingers of two hands intermeshing with each other.\n\nAs the architectural project turns from defining a spatial language to solving more specific issues of program and site, the language of the study model proves to be extendable and adaptable, dividing into different sizes for program space, stretching out to cross over a street, and opening a large void so that an existing historic structure can be fit in the overall complex. (Let this be a lesson to people who wonder if historic and contemporary architecture can coexist.)\n\nThis becomes a fairly specific schematic plan for the museum, in which the established geometric language works with apparent comfort and adaptability in allowing the real-life rigors of program space and circulation to fit into the building. Yet, the geometric abstraction of the plan still looks like art.\n\nThe lobby rendering suggests that the spatial sensibilities of the early study models survive into the final building scheme with real consistency. Meanwhile, the curtain wall, suggests a similarly nuanced vocabulary of changes in texture and gradations in perforation to allow a great variety of visual effects.\n\nWith only a limited range of architectural features considered here, this design nonetheless shows an avant-garde sensibility that is adventurous and sculptural, while still nuanced and responsive to the rigors of a real institution with a complex program of uses. It is more than worthy of the complex and layered musical performances that will take place within."
