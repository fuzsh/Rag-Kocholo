        "text": "Copper Arts Hub-Narrative\n\nA welcoming new home in North Miami for community and culture. A catalyst coming at the right time to ignite the arts in North Miami. A vital artistic center that will foster community, creativity and economic activity by boosting the arts in the city. All led by an immigrant raised in North Miami who has forged a thriving international cultural exchange organization and is bringing his experience, knowledge and passion to invest back home.\n\nThis is Copper Arts Hub, a community-based cultural center slated to open in 2021 on North Miami’s central corridor of 125th Street, in the historic Griffing Park area. The newest project from Geo Darder’s internationally acclaimed Copperbridge Foundation, Copper Arts Hub will present original programming in visual arts, music, dance, theater and architecture, with exhibits, performances, artist residencies, outdoor celebrations, street murals, and educational programs for children and adults. Copper Arts Hub will be a welcoming place for the North Miami community, and a vibrant cultural resource that will make a vital contribution to the City of North Miami’s plans to re-develop and revitalize the city’s downtown core. The city’s vision has inspired Darder, who was raised in North Miami and started his career there, to bring the Copperbridge Foundation’s international connections, multi-cultural expertise, and community-based vision to the city where he started.\n\nCopper Arts Hub will open in three stages, across three properties that will form a miniature cultural district. Phase 1 will be in two graceful Art Deco buildings facing each other across a courtyard, named Caridad (Charity) and Esperanza (Hope), on 125th Street and NE 4th Avenue, with visual art exhibits, classes and workshops, artist residencies, live events, and the organization’s offices. Phase 2 will unfold at an outdoor lot on the same block, which will initially provide parking and emphasize outdoor programming such as an art garden, farmers and antique markets. Phase 3, slated for the Fe (Faith) property half a block south on 4th Avenue, will see artist studios and residencies in the historic Art Deco single-family home, while the expansive rear garden will host musical and other performances, pop-up art events, container exhibits, craft markets, food trucks and more.\n\nOutdoor programming will be a key feature across Copper Arts Hub’s phases and sites, recognizing the new reality engendered by Covid-19. The Hub will build on the model created by successful and popular outdoor entertainment spaces such as Wynwood Yard, Midtown Garden Center, and Upper Buena Vista, combining innovative pop-up and indoor/outdoor culinary experiences, live music and other performances, and inviting art and design in a beautiful garden setting.\n\nCopperbridge – Fostering Culture and Community\n\nGeo Darder founded the non-profit Copperbridge Foundation in 2011 with the mission of fostering culture, community and understanding through international artistic exchange, working primarily with Cuba, Brazil, Haiti and Latin America. In the decade since, Copperbridge has been extraordinarily successful in creating a rich range of cultural experiences in Miami and beyond. Darder’s group has presented the Miami debuts of famed Cuban dance troupes Malpaso and Danzabierta and the U.S. premiere of celebrated theater piece 10 Million; sponsored a major visual art project, Detras del Muro (Behind the Wall), which commissioned Cuban and international artists to create installations on the Malecon, Havana’s seaside promenade, for the 11th, 12th and 13th Havana Bienniales; presented pioneering Afro-Cuban music group Sintesis and famed songwriter Descemer Bueno, co-writer of megahit Bailando; and created programs for the American Association of Architects and the World Congress on Art Deco for conferences in Cuba, Chile, and Argentina.\n\nIn 2020, Copperbridge’s 10×10 virtual celebration of its tenth anniversary drew hundreds of participants from across Latin America and the U.S. for panels and conversations on visual art, dance, and architecture. Copperbridge has been featured in the Miami Herald, the New York Times, the Miami New Times, and Dance Magazine.\n\nDarder has made community partnerships and education central to Copperbridge, imbuing its programming with a warm, welcoming spirit and a commitment to creating opportunities for personal interaction that fosters understanding between peoples and cultures. The group’s programs include workshops with visiting and local artists in everything from Afro-Cuban dance and music; crafts such as ceramics and metal-working; and workshops for children in mask-making and murals. Post-performance talkbacks, artist studio visits, and informal celebrations are all part of the Copperbridge DNA. In Miami, the group has partnered with such luminary organizations as the Miami Light Project and Miami Dade College. For its 2017 Copperfest arts festival, its signature Miami event, Copperbridge worked extensively with North Miami and Haitian-American institutions, producing family and Afro-Caribbean music celebrations at MOCA, an exhibit and talk by Haitian photography project Fotokonbit at the Little Haiti Cultural Center; and workshops at WJ Bryan Elementary, Barry University, and the North Miami Public Library.\n\nThe values that drive Darder and the Copperbridge Foundation are expressed in the names he gave the Arts Hub properties: Caridad, Esperanza and Fe. “Charity is for giving back,” Darder says. “Hope is for a better tomorrow. And Faith because if you don’t have faith you have nothing. Those are messages to the community.”\n\nGeo Darder – Giving Back and Going Back to his Roots\n\nCopper Arts Hub fulfills a personal mission for Darder, bringing together his experience and achievements to give back to his first home.\n\n“This neighborhood has always been part of my life,” Darder says. “I have always believed in community. What do you do with this knowledge? You have to share it. So I’m coming back home. At this stage of my life, where I’ve accumulated experience, property, a bit of wisdom and a sense of belonging, it’s all about bringing whatever I’ve done in my life to this center.”\n\nWhen Darder’s parents fled Cuba’s communist government for Miami with Darder, a toddler, and his three-year-old brother, they settled in North Miami, where his father started a small construction business and his mother worked in a factory. Darder grew up near Tom Sasso Park, went to Ben Franklin Elementary and Westview Junior High School, rode his bike to every park. Friends and neighbors from North Miami’s rich panoply of cultures – Black, Colombian, Haitian, Puerto Rican, Anglo, Italian-American – imbued him with an appreciation for diversity, in a place where he and his family were welcome.\n\n“When you’re in exile you seek acceptance,” Darder says. “North Miami accepted us. It was home.”\n\nAfter graduating from Miami Dade College North Darder, who had modeled through high school, started two modeling agencies based in North Miami, with clients that included the hit TV show Miami Vice. After a decade working in architecture and cultural tourism in New York, Cuba, and Brazil, he returned to Miami in 2005 and opened another business, the antiques and new age store Gypsy Tea Shop, in North Miami. He continued investing in the area, buying his childhood best friend’s family home, and the properties that will now become Copper Arts Hub.\n\nWith North Miami poised for a revitalization where arts and culture will play a key role, Darder believes he can play a part in giving back to his first home.\n\n“I finally have the opportunity to be part of the positive growth of a city,” Darder says. “I can’t change the world. But I can change this little hub.”\n\nNorth Miami – a Rich Cultural Legacy\n\nCopper Arts Hub will build on North Miami’s rich cultural history, which city leaders are working to reinvigorate.\n\n“The idea is to reintroduce the history of that artistic heritage, the film, the music, to re-introduce that vibrant, forward thinking identity,” says Julie Soimaud, manager of Art in Public Places for the North Miami Community Redevelopment Agency, or CRA. “We want to create a place that’s a home for the arts, an arts and entertainment city.”\n\nThat history starts with major film, TV and music production venues. In the 1960’s, North Miami became home to the Ivan Tors studio, which created the hit TV shows Flipper and Gentle Ben; later, renamed Greenwich Studios by new owners, it handled production of the 80’s TV megahit Miami Vice; as well as made-in-Miami films like Ace Ventura Pet Detective, The Birdcage, Strip Tease, and There’s Something About Mary; numerous telenovelas; and countless music videos by stars like Julio Iglesias, Madonna, Celine Dion and Whitney Houston.\n\nNorth Miami has a prominent place in pop music through Criteria Studios, one of the most influential music production studios in the country. Artists ranging from Aretha Franklin, Eric Clapton, The Eagles, The Bee Gees, Fleetwood Mac and James Brown to Billy Joel, R.E.M., Nicki Minaj, Justin Bieber, Drake and Dr. Dre have recorded and helped Criteria the name The Hit Factory.\n\nNorth Miami’s famed Museum of Contemporary Art, or MOCA, was a pioneering space from the moment it opened in 1981 as a small, city-sponsored gallery, moving into its graceful, modernist current home in 1996. The first area museum to present conceptual, performance, environmental and sound art, MOCA was a crucial haven for the kind of contemporary artists and ideas that have transformed Miami into an international art center. Under famed former director Bonnie Clearwater, MOCA was the first museum in Miami-Dade to build a contemporary art collection and a reputation for adventurous, ground-breaking shows with the likes of Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein, Keith Haring, Frank Stella, Louise Bourgeois, as well as contemporary exhibits that made it a must-stop venue during Miami Art Week and for a time the most renowned museum in Miami-Dade County. Now led by Chana Bugazad Sheldon, MOCA continues to present powerful exhibitions that speak to art lovers and North Miami’s diverse community.\n\nArtist studios, small galleries and alternative spaces also figure in North Miami’s artistic legacy. In the 90’s, North Miami warehouses provided studio space to famed New York transplant Kenny Scharf, who came out of New York’s graffiti and downtown art scenes; and major Miami artists such as Carol K. Brown and sculptor Robert Thiele; and drawing rising young talent like Daniel Arsham. That independent tradition continues under Thiele and his daughter Kristin Theile, who run Bridge Red Studios, an artist studio and exhibition complex LOCATION whose roster includes Lou Anne Colodny, the founder of MOCA. The independent antique and furniture stores on 125th Street near MOCA, the heart of downtown North Miami, are an insider source for hip 20th century design.\n\nCreative neighborhoods go through stages. With Wynwood and South Beach increasingly geared towards tourists and commercial ventures, North Miami’s history makes it a top contender to be Miami-Dade’s next leading artistic area.\n\n“North Miami is primed to host a resurgence, a rebirth in art,” says artist and art fabricator Oliver Sanchez, who ran Scharf’s warehouse studio and has worked with a host of visiting and local artists. A veteran instigator of community-powered art scenes, Sanchez, who is on Copper Arts Hub’s Advisory Board, was part of New York’s legendary East Village creative incubator Club 57, and for years has run the vibrant gallery, workshop and multi-generational gathering spot Swampspace in the Design District, where he has nurtured generations of teenage artists from DASH with internships and classes.\n\nAs a dynamic new incubator for culture and community in North Miami, Copper Arts Hub will help drive North Miami’s artistic resurgence.\n\nA Civic Partnership – Economic and Community Benefits\n\nLeaders at the City of North Miami want a thriving art and culture scene to be at the heart of their efforts to redevelop the city, particularly in the downtown core around MOCA and 125th Street. In 2021, that effort seems poised to come to fruition. The Community Redevelopment Agency, or CRA, recently announced a major subsidy for ELEVEN55, a 384-unit affordable and workforce housing complex near the museum which will break ground in 2021; the first step in an ambitious city plan to add 500 units of new or refurbished, affordable housing annually for several years. North Miami is growing. The massive luxury Sole Mia development on Biscayne Bay has been a success, while increasing numbers of new residents are drawn by North Miami’s green neighborhoods filled with single-family homes.\n\nThe CRA has refurbished the plaza in front of MOCA, sponsored the Jazz at MOCA concert series, and requires developers applying for funding to include a public art component. The agency will soon oversee a complete redesign and renovation of a community center in Griffing Park, one block from Copper Arts Hub. NoMi leaders want to further encourage cultural activity, restaurants, and shopping to boost quality of life for the approximately 62,000 people living in the city, and to draw visitors from around Miami-Dade and beyond.\n\nCopper Arts Hub is working with the CRA and city leaders to play a role in that cultural renaissance. It has been awarded a $150,000 CRA matching grant to renovate the Caridad and Esperanza buildings.\n\nJulie Soimaud, the CRA Art in Public Places manager, says Copper Arts Hub comes at an ideal time to reinforce the city’s cultural ambitions. “The timing couldn’t be more perfect,” says Soimaud. “Having outside influences is crucial to the development of the arts in North Miami.”\n\n“The face of North Miami has changed. The demographics are truly international. It’s opening up to a younger crowd, which is why what Geo is doing is really crucial. It’s reflective of North Miami today. It’s showcasing and embracing diversity.”\n\nDarder will draw on Copperbridge Foundation’s extensive international network of artists, cultural supporters and producers for Copper Arts Hub, which will benefit North Miami in multiple ways – bringing acclaimed architectural experts for programs that will look at the city’s architecture and history, for instance; teaching artists to lead workshops for local children; and new attention to the city.\n\nA major initiative for Copper Arts Hub will be a street mural project, which will bring international and South Florida street artists to paint ten murals in the immediate area. The mural project will reinforce the CRA’s public art efforts, which include art transformations of utility boxes in Griffing Park, as well light poles, crosswalks, and musical bus benches.\n\nThe Copper Arts Hub street mural project is led by Raquel Vallejo, an urban art curator who, as a consultant to the city of Gainesville, spearheaded their arts and culture master plan, initiating a mural project that created over 90 street murals in five years. The murals will bring attention to Copper Arts Hub and to North Miami, transforming the neighborhood visually, increasing cultural tourism, and using artists with huge social media followings who will bring international attention to the city.\n\n“Murals create community,” says Vallejo, pointing to the success of mural projects in Gainesville, St. Petersburg, Palm Beach and Jacksonville. “They lift up the neighborhood. They beautify the urban environment, make everything pop. Every city that has a decent mural project is going through a renaissance.”\n\nBeyond the economic boost of visitors, activity and visibility, Copper Arts Hub will emphasize the countless intangible benefits of culture. Its accessible, multi-cultural programming and friendly style will bring people of different classes, races and cultures together in ways that will foster appreciation and understanding. Its educational programs will inspire and teach both children and adults. As North Miami’s first international, multi-disciplinary arts center, Copper Arts Hub will build community pride and quality of life.\n\nNeighbors are already embracing Darder’s vision. Cindy Ordaz, whose home and graphic design business, Vessel Design, are a few blocks from the Caridad and Esperanza buildings, believes Copper Arts Hub will bring the community together, while lifting it up with new cultural activity. “We’re a diamond in the rough – we have so much potential,” says Ordaz, a member of the NoMi Neighborhood Association. “Copperbridge is taking us in the direction North Miami should go. This is absolutely what people in my neighborhood want.”"
