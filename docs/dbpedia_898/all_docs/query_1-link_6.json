        "text": "The 2023 list of Oklahoma’s Most Endangered Places include:\n\n11th Street Bridge, Tulsa\n\nBuilt in 1917, the old 11th Street Bridge (now the Cyrus Avery Route 66 Memorial Bridge), was the first concrete and steel-reinforced bridge to cross the Arkansas River anywhere in the United States. It has 18 spans and is 1,470.6 feet long. The original balustrades were classical in design and it featured Victorian-era lighting. In 1929 the guardrails and lighting were replaced with Art Deco designs. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996 and is considered to be in poor condition.\n\nCyrus Avery was appointed to the Joint Board on Interstate Highways in 1924. In 1925, that board received approval from the American Association of State Highway Officials for a proposed National Highway System. The first highway as part of this new system was a sweeping highway from Chicago to Santa Monica. Avery convinced the AASHO that the best route for this proposed highway would be through Tulsa via the old 11th Street Bridge.\n\nThe historic significance of this bridge makes it a major tourist attraction for the city and state. Rehabilitating the bridge will allow us to preserve history and make the bridge accessible for pedestrian and bicycle traffic, available for popup shops, events, etc. It is currently closed to all motor and pedestrian traffic.\n\nQuanah Parker’s Star House, Cache\n\nFew properties in Oklahoma gather as much interest and curiosity as Quanah Parker’s Star House, currently located in Cache. Concerned citizens have nominated the home a total of six times, including this year’s nomination. We understand the interest: it is difficult to gain access to the site, it can’t be seen from the road, and Parker’s legacy as the last great Comanche warrior bring visitors from all over, hoping to see the home.\n\nStar House was built around 1890 on Fort Sill for Quanah Parker and his family. He lived there until his death in 1911 and his daughter purchased the property. It was in danger of being demolished in 1956. Herbert Woesner, Jr., purchased the home and moved it to his amusement park near Cache, Eagle Park. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.\n\nThe home has deteriorated significantly over the decades, and many were concerned it was near collapse. For the last few years, a small group of people interested in the Quanah Parker’s Star House began meeting with the current owners. As a result of those discussions, an oral agreement has been reached and plans are moving forward to secure this treasured structure for a new nonprofit organization. Planning for the full and accurate restoration of Star House includes consultations with an historic architect and an experienced contractor.\n\nQuanah Parker’s Historic Star House, Inc. (QPHSH) was incorporated in the State of Oklahoma and was issued an EIN number in 2022. The IRS Form 1023, Application for Recognition Under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue Code, will soon be submitted for approval. Star House will be moved to the front of the property on which it is presently located. This wonderful house where Quanah received numerous people from all walks of life will once again welcome visitors. Star House will be a living museum and educational center that honors Quanah and the Comanche and our shared history.\n\nIsaiah 53 Church, Tulsa\n\nA remnant of the past is slowly being encroached upon in south Tulsa, near 81st and Harvard. Founded by Stephen Rentie, Rentie Grove was established on a land allotment for Freedmen from the Muskogee (Creek) Nation after the Civil War. Here, a small farming community thrived. Although never incorporated, Rentie Grove had a post office, two churches, a community school, and a general store with a Masonic Lodge above it.\n\nThe small community maintained a presence for decades and the last official resident passed in 1983. Only this church building (the former Baptist Church) and a community cemetery remain. Structurally, the building is in great shape, but the property is for sale. The sale includes the land around the church and a home on the same property built in 1998.\n\nCitizens are concerned that the building could be razed to make way for housing or other development. We hope a buyer pledges to preserve the site as a reminder of this early all-black community in Oklahoma.\n\nLarkin Hotel, Blackwell\n\nSituated on a prime corner in downtown Blackwell, the Larkin Hotel returns to the Most Endangered Places List after last appearing in 2012. It has faced serious deterioration since that time. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.\n\nBuilt in 1923-1924 by John Larkin and designed by J.M. Fuller, the four-story hotel had 66 rooms, 42 of which had their own attached bathrooms; a dining room that was the hot spot to meet during Blackwell’s heyday; and a grand ballroom graced by governors, congressmen and other prominent figures. It anchors the north end of the downtown district. Blackwell was a hub of agriculture, manufacturing, and oil and gas exploration, aided by early railroads providing access to shipping for the community. Blackwell’s population peaked in the1950s, but as the oil and gas boom went to bust, the town declined rapidly. With few guests to serve, the Larkin has been closed for decades.\n\nAs the first four-story building, the first modern hotel in Blackwell and with the involvement of the Commercial Club in its development, the Larkin Hotel represents a unique advancement in Blackwell’s community planning and development. Unfortunately, the north side of the hotel is in dire shape. Several of the brick walls have collapsed, leading to an uncertain future the building.\n\nL’Ouverture School, McAlester\n\nAfrican American and Afro-Indigenous people were among the earliest settlers in Indian Territory. In the first half of the 20th century L’Ouverture was the school attended by African Amercian students in McAlester beginning in 1908. In 1968, the 115 high school students integrated with McAlester High School. The school sits on a prominent hill in the southeast part of town and features buildings from different eras.\n\nThe gymnasium/auditorium was constructed in 1933 by the Civil Works Authority and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. It featured an arched roof and art deco motifs typical of the WPA style of buildings. The gymnasium walls appear solid, but the roof has collapsed in parts over the last few years.\n\nThe rest of the school was demolished in 1952 and a new, mid-century school took its place. It is a long, L-shaped, red brick building and is directly to the east of the gymnasium. This building featured modern classrooms and a new auditorium. The school was used as an alternative school for several years but has sat vacant for over ten years. Windows have been smashed, graffiti can be found down the halls, and vegetation is finding its way indoors.\n\nThere are plans to preserve the building for future generations. Graduates of the class of 1965 purchased the building in 2014 and renamed it L’Ouverture Historical Center. A nonprofit organization is being established by graduates and there are plans to update the National Register listing to include the now-eligible addition.\n\nBridge No. 18 at Rock Creek, Sapulpa\n\nConstructed in 1924 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995, Bridge No. 18 at Rock Creek is an excellent example of a parker through truss bridge on Route 66 in the state. This type of bridge was used extensively along the route during the first part of the 20th Century. It also originally served the Ozark Trail, a network of locally maintained roads and highways.\n\nRock Creek bridge was bypassed by Route 66 in 1952. The bridge did remain in use until recently. While still structurally sound, it is closed to vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The city of Sapulpa plans to turn the area east of the bridge into a park and use the bridge as a centerpiece, attracting domestic and international travelers.\n\nBryant Center, Oklahoma City\n\nRetained from our 2022 list, The Bryant Center was a hub for Oklahoma City’s most prominent Black community. Little progress has happened since last year, and Bryant Center has become an unofficial dumping ground. Piles of shingles dot the site, along with graffiti and garbage. Those experiencing homelessness also use the site.\n\nOnce housing a bowling alley, a restaurant, and a dining club at its peak, what was formerly known as The Bryant Recreational Center has fallen into a state of disuse since the 1980s.\n\nThe goal is to preserve the building for the benefit of the community. There is renewed interest in the property as the historic northeast side of Oklahoma City continues to see development. A new roof is needed but the walls appear to be stable. The community hopes to conduct a structural assessment soon.\n\nSt. Joesph’s Rectory, Krebs\n\nBuilt in 1905 in the Second Empire style, the rectory at St. Joseph’s Catholic Church was the hub of the parish complex and home for the parish priest. It is constructed of sandstone block (painted white) with a pressed tin mansard roof. It is immediately to the south of the red brick, eclectic style church that was built in 1903. The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 and the rectory is eligible for listing as well.\n\nAll activity has moved out of the rectory over the years, and the building is now in need of extensive restorative work. This includes foundation repair, roof restoration, bringing wiring up to code, and plumbing and wall repair. Plans are being made to begin fundraising for the repairs and the parish hopes to apply for a National Fund for Sacred Places grant.\n\nJewel Theatre, Oklahoma City\n\nConstructed in 1931, the Jewel Theater served as one of the few safe havens for Black joy, community, and entertainment in Oklahoma City’s public realm during the violent, segregationist era of Jim Crow in the south. Although the theater survived that period, and the city’s multiple urban renewal projects that took place in the 1960s through the ‘80s in the area, the ultimate displacement of thousands of residents and the decline of the neighborhood’s conditions created multiple barriers in the theater’s ability to remain open. The theater ultimately closed its doors in the late 1970s and is now structurally vulnerable - facing serious disrepair. Current owner Mr. Arthur Hurst purchased it with a promise to the original owner that he would restore it so it can operate in the community as a cultural asset once again.\n\nIt is the only building left along that stretch of NE 4th Street in the John F. Kennedy neighborhood. With the restoration and surrounding new development at Page Woodson School, the Jewel Theatre is primed for a comeback. A recent grant from the Mellon Foundation will help with structural stabilization and planning for future uses. It is also part of a Planned Unit Development with the city of Oklahoma City. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.\n\nSkyride, Tulsa\n\nBuilt in 1965, the Tulsa Skyride was one of ten remaining Von Roll skyrides in the USA and one of three at a state fair. This detachable gondola skyride was manufactured by Von Roll Ironworks of Bern, Switzerland. The Tulsa Skyride offered a unique experience not duplicated elsewhere in Oklahoma or most neighboring states. It was a family favorite, and the Tulsa State Fair tradition was deemed eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nExpo Square planned to demolish the skyride in 2022 without public notification. News of the pending demolition was leaked in May 2022. Public outcry halted the demolition but the skyride remained threatened. Demolition of the towers began earlier this year but halted for a time. Work resumed last week, and it seems all towers have been removed.\n\nWe have chosen to keep the structure on the list this year in hopes of raising awareness of properties of this type, that often get overlooked in the preservation process.\n\nEstablished as one of Preservation Oklahoma’s first programs, Oklahoma’s Most Endangered Historic Places was patterned after a similar annual list produced by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Ralph McCalmont, one of the founding board members of Preservation Oklahoma, had also served on the board of the National Trust and was keenly aware of the program’s impact. Realizing the need for Preservation Oklahoma to focus public attention on the state’s historic structures, the Board of Directors agreed to publish an annual list of “properties and sites which have special historic or architectural significance to our state, but which are in danger of being lost, due to neglect, poor maintenance, obsolescence or other causes.” The purpose of producing this listed was stated by John Mabrey, then the President of Preservation Oklahoma, when he said “if we bring the problems to light of a structure familiar to people, they are more likely to do something about it.”\n\nFor thirty years, people have done “something about it.” While inclusion on the list does not guarantee protection or funding, it has proven to be a key component in mobilizing support for the preservation of historic sites by raising each structure’s awareness to a statewide level. The nomination process has evolved to reflect the fact that the public is aware of the need to preserve their local structures. Today, nominations are solicited annually from the public. The nominations are compiled and the formal list is selected by a group of preservation experts, including historians, architects, and archaeologists. ​"
