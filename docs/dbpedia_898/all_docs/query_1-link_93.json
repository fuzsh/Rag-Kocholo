        "text": "Designated September 21, 2004\n\nThe Long Island Headquarters of the New York Telephone Company, built in 1929-30, is a masterful example of the series of tall structures issuing from architect Ralph Walkerâ€™s long and productive association with the communications industry. In this dramatically massed, orange brick skyscraper, Walker illustrates his exceptional ability to apply the Art Deco style to a large office tower. Its abstract, metal ornament on the ground story display windows and the main entrance on Bridge Street, suggests constant movement, and is typical of the art of late 1920s.\n\n*Excerpt from the Landmarks Preservation Commission designation report"
