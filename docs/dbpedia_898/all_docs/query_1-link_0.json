        "text": "Tulsa was founded in 1879 with the establishment of its first post office. The town has deep Native American roots. The Creek Indians from Alabama were relocated here in the 1880s. In fact the town was originally called Tulsey Town for this Indian community. The railroad came to town in 1882 insuring Tulsa's economic growth. I guess the real clincher for an up and coming Oklahoma town was the oil boom brought on by the first commercial well located across the river in Red Fork in 1901. In 1896 Tulsa was a sleepy frontier town along the Arkansas River. That was about to change. In 1901 oil was discovered here and created a boomtown with many new millionaires. With all the oil money, Tulsa became a town to be reckoned with. Compare the 1896 picture of Main Street Tulsa on the left to the 1909 picture of Main Street on the right. The town had changed in 12 short years! Tulsa now had a reputation to uphold and the building boom that resulted produced some of the most beautiful examples of Art Deco Architecture to be found anywhere in the United States. Art Deco generally comprises the time period between the two World Wars. It is a fanciful style that uses geometric designs and shapes from nature. With Art Deco \"line and shape\" is everything. Route 66 Harley-Davidson Larry Wofford is a Tulsa Route 66 hero. He owns the Route 66 Harley Davidson Shop and promotes the Mother Road whenever he can. His store is Route 66 themed all the way. The shop floor is a road map of Route 66 that starts in Chicago and ends in Los Angeles. Michael Wallis, author of \"Route 66 the Mother Road\" and a Harley owner himself, is a customer.\n\n\"Route 66 goes through eight states but we say it should be nine ~ the ninth being a state of mind!\""
