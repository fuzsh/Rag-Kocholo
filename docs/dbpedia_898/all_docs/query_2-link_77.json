        "text": "Tulsa, city, Osage and Tulsa counties, seat (1907) of Tulsa county, northeastern Oklahoma, U.S., situated on the Arkansas River. It originated in 1836 as a settlement of Creek Indians who named it for their former town in Alabama. White settlement began after the arrival in 1882 of the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway. The discovery of oil in nearby Red Fork (1901) and Glenn Pool (1905) launched the mid-continent oil and gas boom, and phenomenal growth followed. Hundreds of oil companies now have plants and offices in the city, which was the site of the International Petroleum Exposition (held 1965–80). The main economic activity is based on petroleum—exploration, drilling, production, refining, and research. The aviation-aerospace industry also is important to Tulsa’s economy, which includes a wide range of manufacturing and wholesale distribution activities. The city serves as the commercial and financial centre of a rich agricultural area and is the national headquarters of the U.S. Jaycees.\n\nThe municipally owned Spavinaw Water System brings clear water from the Ozark foothills, 70 miles (110 km) away. Surrounded by man-made lakes and reservoirs, Tulsa, with the nearby port of Catoosa on the Verdigris River, is the head of navigation for the Arkansas River Navigation System. It thus has access via the Arkansas and Mississippi rivers to the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico and to barge transportation, complementing airlines, railroads, and truck lines."
