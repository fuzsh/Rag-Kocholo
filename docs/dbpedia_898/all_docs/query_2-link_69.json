        "text": "Next Article\n\nBy Rhys Martin, President, Oklahoma Route 66 Association\n\nWe’re lucky in Tulsa that we have a lot of local, cultural treasures — Route 66 being one of them.\n\nFor those who drive East 11th Street every day, it may not seem like a big deal. But people come from all over specifically to travel that old two-lane that connects Chicago to Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean. Tulsa isn’t just another stop along the famous highway, either. Tulsa is known as the Capital of Route 66 for good reason!\n\nTulsa is the adopted hometown of Cyrus Avery, the Father of Route 66. This early proponent of the “Good Roads” movement saw the vital need for paved roads to accommodate the growing automobile industry in the early 20th century. Because of his influence and heavy involvement, U.S. Highway 66 came through Tulsa and across the Arkansas River on the 11th Street bridge. There’s a statue in his honor on the northeast end of that historic span, forever locked in a surprise encounter with a horse-and-buggy oil field worker.\n\nRoute 66 in Tulsa isn’t a one-hit wonder, though. Tulsa has 28 miles of the road when you consider both alignments, which cover eight distinct districts in the city. If you are heading east to west (the traditional direction that Route 66 is known for) you’ll enter Tulsa through the Gateway District, named after the beautiful deco-inspired gateway near East 11th Street and South 129th East Avenue. There’s a historic marker nearby, the first of dozens scattered along the road that tell more of the story. The traffic circle at East Admiral Place and South Mingo Road — once the site of Avery’s gas station and tourist court — stands a magnificent monument titled “Route 66 Rising.” Indeed, over the last two decades it has seen a great rebirth not just for tourism but for local entrepreneurs.\n\nAs you journey east, the blazing neon of the vintage Desert Hills Motel welcomes you to the University District. Anchored by the University of Tulsa, this stretch of the road starts to show how the city’s Neon Sign Grant has further enhanced the corridor. Neon has long been associated with Route 66’s so-called “heyday,” but it’s as vibrant and beloved as ever. Since the program launched in 2019, over 50 signs have been approved through the grant program. These have joined the long-standing signs to create a brightly lit path of nostalgia and artistry that begs visitors to stay longer to see the tubes come to life as the sun goes down.\n\nThe Tulsa Market District is named after Mother Road Market, the sprawling food hall at 1124 S. Lewis Ave. The intersection has recently undergone a massive transformation thanks to the City and the Lobeck Taylor Family Foundation. It’s hard to believe it wasn’t that long ago this part of town was heavily associated with car dealerships and warehouse storage. This is a popular stop for Route 66 travelers with shops and unique Tulsa flavors.\n\nJust north of the Market District, Kendall Whittier is nestled on the original alignment of Route 66 and proudly celebrates its multicultural makeup. Circle Cinema here is Tulsa’s only independent movie house and it always has something interesting going on. There are many small businesses here that fit the mold that has always made Route 66 great — from the Pancho Anaya Bakery to Bar 473 to Ziegler Art and Frame and more.\n\nDid you know Tulsa is home to one of the largest neon signs on the entire Route 66 corridor? The Meadow Gold sign near 11th and South Peoria Avenue was saved from demolition in the early 2000s and fully restored as part of Tulsa’s Route 66 Master Plan. Today it overlooks one of the best examples of how local businesses have come together around an identity to create something of a small-town atmosphere in the middle of the city. The Meadow Gold District is home to Ike’s Chili, the oldest operating restaurant in Tulsa (its original location even served Will Rogers) and the 21-foot-tall Muffler Man statue outside of Buck Atom’s Cosmic Curios has become an international landmark. The longer you linger here,\n\nRoute 66 exits downtown through the Cathedral District. Multiple ornate and architecturally significant churches stand within view. Not far from here, the road turns south and crosses the Arkansas River. In addition to the previously mentioned Cyrus Avery statue, there’s a Neon Sign Park on the southwest bank. These signs had been lost to the wrecking ball for decades, but thanks to the Tulsa Route 66 Commission’s efforts, they were reborn to celebrate the three eras of Route 66 in Tulsa.\n\nSouthwest Boulevard leads into the Red Fork District, home of Tulsa Route 66 Main Street. Red Fork was a suburb when Tulsa was young. It’s time as the Oil Capital of the World. It’s fitting that a drive down Route 66 on the west side takes you past an oil refinery and the Route 66 Village, a roadside attraction designed to educate travelers about Tulsa’s transportation history. Historic Downtown Red Fork is still there, too, and is becoming known as a hotspot for local art."
