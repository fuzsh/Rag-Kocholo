        "text": "OLIN’s winning design for the 11th Street Bridge Park Competition connects two historically disparate sides of the Anacostia River with a series of rooms and active zones, including two sloped ramps that elevate visitors to maximized look-out points to landmarks in either direction. Each ramp terminates in a waterfall that visually reconnects the ramps to the river below. In addition to demonstrating how plants cleanse captured rainwater, the waterfalls above the bridge deck provide cooling breezes and a calming sound. The waterfall below the structure collects surface river water and drops it back into the river, emphasizing the need for river aeration and higher oxygen levels. To encourage visitors to the bridge and neighboring communities, the design includes amenities for comfort and refreshment and an open plaza for markets, festivals and theatrical performances. The form of the bridge creates an iconic encounter, an “X” instantly recognizable as the river’s new image.\n\nThe Anthony J. Celebrezze Federal Building, the workplace of 4,000 people, is located on approximately 4 acres adjacent to City Hall and bounded by 9th Street—the recently designated Rock and Roll Boulevard that leads to the Hall of Fame. OLIN’s fundamental design goal is to create a memorable place that will aid in the renaissance of downtown Cleveland. Central to the design is the concept of an urban forest that, together with careful modeling of the ground and layout of paths and low walls, form a protected microclimate, while remaining open and inviting to the city. The design features a series of strategically planted spaces that accommodate relaxation and contemplation, as well as large events. To most fully realize the potential of this challenging site exposed to the winds of Lake Erie, OLIN worked closely with architects, a wind consultant, a lighting consultant and an artist to form a place that will become one of the most popular destinations in downtown Cleveland.\n\nOne of the highest profile and most cherished public spaces in the world, Bryant Park has become a model for environmental, social and economic sustainability. Many visitors to the park are unaware that the site is a large-scale green roof above an annex housing more than three million volumes of the adjacent New York Public Library. The social character of Bryant Park was transformed within days of the restoration’s completion in 1992. The New York Times cited, “Where once the park was the home of derelicts, drug dealers and drug users, it is now awash with office workers, shoppers, strollers and readers.” Today, Bryant Park draws thousands of visitors every day. The park is active year-round with concerts, performances, movie screenings, ice skating and more. The restoration of the park marked the beginning of an era in which public/private partnerships became the financiers and guardians of the public realm—a watershed moment in the history of park-making.\n\nNature and culture come to the forefront as the design for California Memorial Stadium artistically blends natural systems with social and environmental function. The site improvements allow the stadium and its environs to be an active and contributing part of campus, not only dur­ing games, but every day of the year. The design takes its inspiration from several site-specific themes: wilderness, history, and academic and athletic achievements, which are expressed in the materials, grading and amenities. The site’s elevations change of more than 145 feet presented opportunities for dramatic views and spaces, but made accessibility a challenge, ultimately overcome through skillful and sensitive grading. The main plaza was formed conceptually by pressing the building into the earth, minimizing the visual impact to the site, while creating an accessible and significant public open space. Materials, as one approaches the stadium, become more refined, from a coarse stonewall to precisely laid paving. The paving pattern at the plaza is intricately designed and detailed, inspired by Ellsworth Kelly’s painting La Combe III at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Spirited quotations from alumni are engrav­ed within the paving, acknowledging the university’s influence in world affairs.\n\nOLIN developed a landscape master plan and detailed landscape design for this rural country inn. The design concept was to create a relaxing and contextually rich environment for guests by reflecting elements charac­teristic of the region’s agrarian landscape in the site planning, architecture and garden design. Native trees, grasses, and warm stone walls visually link the complex to its surroundings. Each guest unit boasts an individually designed garden featuring colorful perennials, flowering shrubs, and fruit and nut trees. The inn’s core—its registration building, private restaurant, health spa, and swimming pool—were placed on the site’s highest elevation to capture the magnificent views across Napa Valley. However, this location is subject to cold winds coming off San Francisco Bay. OLIN created a warm, protected microclimate for the swimming pool area by siting the buildings at right angles to the north and west to block the prevailing winds, and set the pool low into the hilltop, where it basks in full sun all day and catches the last of the afternoon’s warmth. To address water resource concerns, all of the site’s waste­water receives tertiary treatment and is recycled for on-site irrigation. As part of a multi-faceted design team, OLIN provided urban design and master planning from a landscape architectural perspective, helping to develop the goals and philosophy of the community in response to its distinctive natural environment. The plan takes advantage of Cayman’s beautiful setting and gentle trade winds; the challenge came in designing for the island’s harsher conditions, such as fierce hurricanes, strong sunlight, high humidity, frequent seasonal rain showers and salt-laden soil, water and air. By funneling cooling breezes, incorporating open spaces and producing shade with architecture, fabric and plants, a comfortable pedestrian environment was created.\n\nSince completing the overall master plan, OLIN has repeatedly been engaged to implement an array of projects throughout the community, including office buildings, the town center, the marina, a schoolyard, and a botanical garden walk.\n\nOLIN’s redesign of Columbus Circle is based on concentric rings of movement and light, transforming what was once an inhospitable traffic circle into a refuge where people stop, meet and relax in the hub of a swirl of traffic late into the evening. The fountain is formed by a series of ledges with cascading water and jets arching toward the center to reinforce the circular design and primacy of the monument, mask traffic noise and temper the summer climate. When turned off, the ledges serve as seating to avoid the typically forlorn character of unused fountains during winter months. Custom-designed benches are scaled to complement the civic space and are wide enough to allow individuals to sit comfortably back-to-back. Columbus Circle demonstrates the potential of reclaiming social space in conjunction with rethinking transportation infrastructure. The redesign devotes less area to vehicles, yet traffic now flows more efficiently. Disciplining traffic as part of transportation planning and successfully balancing it with social needs is a difficult task, but one that is successfully addressed at Columbus Circle and can serve as a model for other cities.\n\nOLIN’s redesign of Columbus Circle is based on concentric rings of movement and light, transforming what was once an inhospitable traffic circle into a refuge where people stop, meet and relax in the hub of a swirl of traffic late into the evening.

OLIN led the design to prioritize the pedestrian experience and create a welcoming urban destination with fountains, trees, seating, and kiosks for refreshments and museum information.\n\nOrnamental beds of shrubs and herbaceous flowers reference plantings seen in early-to-mid-20th century photographs and drawings. Trees with limited lifespans have been replaced with a formal allée of aerial hedges; in all, the plaza includes approximately 100 new trees, more than twice the previous number. Increased shade creates a more comfortable environment, reducing the surface temperature of paving by as much as 25 degrees Fahrenheit. A new pair of contemporary granite fountains operates year-round by utilizing an innovative steam-recycling circulation system. They are positioned closer to the grand stairs, improving access to the plaza’s street-level public entrances and creating an energized connection between people sitting on the steps and those at the fountains.\n\nThe Desert Shield and Desert Storm Memorial is an oasis rising out of the fabric of the National Mall. Nestled adjacent to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the Lincoln Memorial, two of the most visited sites in the nation’s capital, the National Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial is comparatively modest in size, but extraordinarily compelling in its layering of form and narrative of unprecedented international cooperation.\n\nCurvilinear landforms rise and fall along the pathway which spirals toward the center of the site, their shapes evoking the image and texture of desert sand dunes. As visitors traverse the path, they approach a series of three elements which sequentially express the major themes of the conflict. The geopolitical and regional context, as well as the speed and scale of the conflict are represented by a soaring eagle and falcon, framed by a cinematic bas relief carving depicting the progression of the conflict to the liberation of Kuwait. The second element is a figurative sculpture of American servicemembers, commemorating teamwork and courage in the face of danger, the bond formed through that experience, and the post-Vietnam healing and transformation of American society following the victory and homecoming. The Unity Shield is the third element, commemorating the memorial’s central theme of global cooperation and shared service and sacrifice. Situated within an oasis-like grove, the shield incorporates a water feature and includes an engraved symbol of each coalition nation. The sculptural elements and contemplative space ask visitors to remember this turning point in history when they gaze out over the Lawn toward the Lincoln Memorial—another symbol of hard-won liberty.\n\nAt the foot of City Hall and the hub of Philadelphia’s transit center, Dilworth Park has become an iconic destination in the heart of the city. Prior to renovation, Dilworth Park lacked accessible space and was divided by a series of raised and sunken terraces and blind stairways. OLIN developed a universally accessible common plaza through the elimination of stairs and walls. The new design brings the entire plaza to street level creating a contemporary public space worthy of its prominent location at City Hall. The park is constructed over Philadelphia’s transit lines and is framed by the addition of two elegant glass pavilions that create a sculptural and daylit entry to the city transit concourses below.\n\nDilworth Park is designed as both a relaxing refuge in Center City as well as a destination for major events. Signature park elements include the plaza, a lawn parterre for informal gathering, sinuous stonework detailing and an interactive fountain. The fountain emerges from the plaza providing a seamless scalability to the park with basins that shrink or enlarge according to the park’s activity. In the winter the fountain transforms to an ice rink providing year round enjoyment. Integrated into the fountain is artist Janet Echleman’s Pulse, a kinetic representation of the transit lines, which signal their passage through illuminated ribbons of atomized fog rising through air. OLIN collaborated with Urban Engineers, KieranTimberlake and CVM Engineers to create this vibrant and comfortable public space that establishes Dilworth Park as a welcoming space to all.\n\nThe Folger Shakespeare Library renovation project, in collaboration with KieranTimberlake, expands public space, improves accessibility, and enhances the experience for all visitors. OLIN worked closely with the museum on the design, which replaces a surface parking lot and monoculture lawn plantings with a series of at-grade and sunken outdoor spaces, including two welcoming east- and west-facing entry plazas, a flexible event lawn, and meandering paths bordered by a mix of evergreen groundcover and seasonally diverse shrub plantings. The entry plazas and open gardens flanking the building are envisioned as a modern interpretation of the Elizabethan Garden; an evergreen hedge and groundcover plantings surround the site, clearly defining an edge, while a series of paths and benches invite visitors to linger and enjoy the immersive environment. The landscape is designed to encourage exploration and social interaction, with museum staff expanding public programs aimed to highlight the numerous plant species referenced in Shakespearean literature, which are proposed to be featured in the new design.\n\nThe Grace Farms Foundation sought a site design that allows people to experience the beauty of nature through landscape; creates a welcoming environment that fosters relationships; provides volunteer resources and opportunities; and enhances this bucolic environment as a place for reflection, study, and discussion. Teamed with the architects at SANAA, OLIN’s vision for the site transformed this 75-acre former horse farm into an open park composed of woodlands, meadows and ponds surrounding new buildings, as well as separate community facilities for art, social outreach and recreation. The property’s post-agrarian landscape has a unique cultural and historical narrative that will be shared with the larger community—72 of the 75 acres is openly accessible to the public. The landscape encourages ecological diversity by strategically removing invasive woodlands and non-native tree species, which will be replaced with indigenous plantings. OLIN also clarified circulation to enhance one’s experience of the site.\n\nCommitment to quality, agrarian heritage, and the connection between people and finely crafted food was an ethos its leaders wished to be represented in every detail of their new home. In a unique collaboration with Overland Architects, OLIN produced an interweaving of building and landscape that enables all employees to enjoy and draw inspiration from the company’s roots and Wisconsin’s bountiful agricultural heritage. The new landscape is composed around and within the Home Office, sited to take advantage of views to the greater surrounding rural landscape and the dramatic Niagara Ledge. Employees arrive via a meandering drive to an orchard inspired parking court of Red Maples, then pass through the Four Seasons Garden to the Arrival Piazza, encountering sensory-rich plantings of vivid color and seasonal contrast. In the central courtyard, employees gather around a uniquely crafted common table to meet and share ideas throughout the day. Beyond the piazza sits the Heritage Orchard, dedicated to Grande’s founder Fillipo Candela, for which OLIN developed a program of grafting authentic Sicilian bud stock onto hardy Wisconsin rootstock. More than half of the 40-acre site is preserved for the continued development of orchards and meadows, which are experienced via winding paths for promoting exercise and contemplation. At its heart, Grande’s Home Office is a physical expression of its commitment to craft and focus on success through a better and more natural work environment.\n\nIn response to community feedback during the LA River Master Plan process and the Headwaters Area Project, the Headwaters Pavilion aims to create a unique and community specific gateway to the LA River Greenway in the neighborhood of Canoga Park that includes improvements for lighting, signage, wayfinding, and safety. As the first project of the LA River Master Plan Update, the Headwaters Pavilion will integrate design concepts put forth in the Master Plan common elements, including water quality best management practices and a river pavilion, which will include a shade structure and sitting area, restrooms, and other elements such as bike racks and drinking fountains. The pavilion is designated as a Tier II pavilion, likely encompassing approximately 650 square feet total of indoor and outdoor covered space.\n\nThe pavilion is located at the intersection of Alabama Avenue and Bassett Street, on the north side of the LA River Channel. The pavilion can be accessed from the river trail or Bassett Street and serves as a portal from the community to the river. The landscape and architecture of the pavilion serves as an interrupter in the typical greenway to indicate the connection to the LA River Trail and provide a unique and place-specific gateway. On the south side (river side) of the pavilion, a sloped walkway and stair provide access down to the LA River Trail on the top of the LA River bank. The project does not provide access into the channel. The project includes improved sidewalk, crosswalk, and street level access to the pavilion from Alabama and Bassett Streets as well as a curb bump out on the south side of Bassett that maintains the existing traffic pattern while helping to calm traffic and shorten the length of crosswalks to the pavilion.\n\nThe Hunts Point Lifelines project is an innovative plan to safeguard the hub of New York’s Food Supply through a protective and resilient landscape infrastructure. The plan was a funded winner of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Rebuild by Design competition. The project is an exemplar of design that demonstrates innovative, scalable solutions that increase long term resilience along the Eastern Seaboard and enables cities, towns, and neighborhoods to respond to the mammoth challenges of climate change adaptation. Lifelines was built upon an integrated design process with deep community engagement, research, and analysis. These efforts resulted in popular support for a landscape based flood protection system that encouraged the use of local industries and green jobs in the implementation of flood protection as well as funding strategies that would result in buildable projects along New York City’s urban shorelines. The PennDesign/OLIN team focused on the development of a living shoreline strategy that incorporated the use of levees designed as greenways and habitat rich wetlands to manage stormwater and prevent wave inundation along the low-lying Hunts Point Peninsula. The project’s consisted of four initiatives, known as ‘Lifelines’: The Levee Lab, a protection system that serves dual purpose as a shoreline greenway, Cleanways a multi-step plan for clean infrastructure, Emergency Maritime Supply Chain, and Livelihoods a policy proposal to promote the local economy and create green jobs.\n\nOLIN’s garden design grew organically in response to the site’s context, specifically climate and light. The architectural parti strove for seamless integration of interior and exterior space. For staff and visitors, the gardens create an exquisitely appointed vestibule for the museum and set the stage for the treasures encountered within. OLIN’s design concept emerged as a reinterpretation of a classic Italian Renaissance villa and garden as a contemporary public arts institution. Italian stone pines line the entrance drive, pruned as in Rome to highlight their distinctive silhouette. A bosque of London plane trees revives the ancient horticultural practice of pollarding, a pruning technique seldom seen in the United States. All plants were carefully chosen based on their horticultural requirements, primarily water, soil and sun needs. Both native and non-invasive plants that are proven performers in the Mediterranean climate of Los Angeles were selected. The striking cacti and succulent garden serves as a model of plant selection based on extreme environmental constraints.\n\nCentrally located in the core of downtown, Lock 3 Park is the primary gathering space for Akron and its environs. Prior to the re-imagining of Lock 3 Park, this ad-hoc space served as the City of Akron’s main public venue and functioned entirely as an event space whose primary mission is to bring people to the downtown. While the events have been somewhat successful, it is during the non-event times that the park is vacant. The locks, which are part of the Ohio & Erie Canalway system, were the lifeblood of the region that brought people, commerce and industry to Akron in the 19th century. Over time, the canal lost its significance with the emergence of the railroad and fell into disrepair. It was during the late 1960’s and early 1970’s that the Canal was deemed a National Historic Landmark and was transformed into a recreation trail along the towpath. However, locks, 2,3, and 4 remained largely disconnected from the city and the pathway to the north that leads to the Cuyahoga River Valley.\n\nThe lock system, within downtown Akron, exists in parallel with Main Street but sits nearly 16 feet below street level. OLIN’s task was to work with the City, representatives from the Ohio & Erie Canalway Coalition, and key stakeholders to reimagine Lock 3 Park and develop a master plan that incorporated Locks 2 and 4. This forgotten gem within the urban fabric was reconceived as a public garden and event space that brings universal access to the steep slope adjacent to Main Street. The programming was reconsidered to allow events to still function and maintain flexibility as a comfortable, everyday place for Akronites to gather and be outside. The signature elements of the park are the Lawn Bowl Amphitheater and Balcony, which takes advantage of the site’s topography, and The Play Loop that connects Locks 2 and 3. The Play Loop is a series of play spaces that are characterized by different ecotypes of NE Ohio; they are the Grass Moraine, Forest, Sand Bog, River Valley, and Misty Plains. The Misty Plains also transforms into an ice-skating loop during the winter months, hence making the park a place to inhabit year-round. OLIN is excited to be a part of this revitalizing effort in creating a welcoming and vibrant downtown park in the City of Akron.\n\nFor decades, Mill River in Stamford, Connecticut was dammed and channelized, choked with pollution and silt buildup, leading to greater flood risk for the surrounding downtown. When the Army Corps of Engineers called for the removal of the dam and channel walls, OLIN was brought in to create a master plan for the newly naturalized waterfront. The plan envisioned the river as an amenity and connector, anchored by a park to the north and with a multimodal greenway stretching down to Stamford Harbor. The first phase of the plan, Mill River Park, was implemented directly out of OLIN’s master plan. The park embraces the newly naturalized banks with a design that includes passive meadows, pedestrian and bicycle trails, lawn areas for play and events, and—for the first time in decades—access points down to the water’s edge. The park also incorporates an existing cherry tree grove, a beloved landmark in Stamford that was a gift to the city in 1957 by Junzo Nojima, a Japanese immigrant. Future phases of the park development include a fountain/ice rink and additional permanent visitor amenities, as well as trail connections extending beyond the park to Stamford Harbor.\n\nThe National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden is a welcome oasis in the vast scale and bustling environment of the adjacent National Mall. It is a lush retreat created by plantings, pathways, and furnishings designed to highlight some of the finest examples of 20th century sculpture in the nation’s capital. OLIN’s concept for the garden was to create a series of outdoor rooms to provide an appropriate setting and route for viewing the collection. The garden was to be a comfortable enclave for people to rest, relax, dine and watch each other in the presence of great art. American tree species define the rooms of various size, shape and proportion to accommodate the sculpture and display them to best advantage. One can focus upon each piece individually, while also viewing several at a time to compare them. Curvilinear paths guide visitors through the rooms and choreograph a comfortable pace for observation. An elegant fountain replaced the old, non-functioning one, and is transformed into an ice skating rink in the winter.\n\nOLIN has been commissioned to develop a design for a new 400-plus acre park in Southern Indiana, along the northern shore of the Ohio River. The project will rehabilitate and transform an expanse of waterfront lands, which for decades have been occupied with landfills and industrial facilities, into a rich cultural and civic asset for Southern Indiana and the Louisville, Kentucky metropolitan area. The park was first envisioned by River Heritage Conservancy, a non-profit organization dedicated to implementing and managing a world-class park system along the northern shoreline of the Ohio Riverfront. The design will seek to regenerate and reforest the landscape, which has been dramatically shaped by both human intervention and the forces of nature. The project will also celebrate the land’s rich ecological and cultural legacy, which dates back to First Peoples’ communities established a millennium ago.\n\nLocated in the Hudson River Park near the Tribeca neighborhood, Pier 26 reaches out and over the Hudson River with striking views to the Statue of Liberty and One World Trade Center. The 2.5 acre pier is located within the Hudson River Estuary, a highly sensitive and ecologically productive body of water that contains a hybrid of freshwater runoff and ocean saltwater. The pier has a unique mission, providing a physical and virtual space that brings to life the invisible dynamics of the Hudson River Estuary, reflecting the current technologies and scientific understanding regarding its health, ecological successes, and challenges. The physical design of the park is a dynamic gradient experience from upland to lowland, from land to water. This experience provides opportunities for ecological education and offers recreation and leisure spaces for people of all ages.\n\nAmericans today are seeking to retain their traditional relationship to the land and their historic landscape while balancing simultaneous demands for increased density, more amenities, greater efficiency, and an ever-expanding job market. The Hills at Vallco offers a paradigm shifting solution: that which cannot be located side by side, can be combined vertically in layers. This project proposes to create a 30-acre public park over a 50-acre development of buildings, streets, and public civic squares. The public landscape of Vallco is composed of tree lined streets, two public squares, and an extensive roof park with a variety of outdoor amenities. The roof park incorporates paths for walking and jogging, a playground, orchards and a vineyard, along with a unique performance space, and at the same time, quieter areas, some constituting native habitat for the native flora and fauna of the Bay Area.\n\nThe Sportsmen’s Lodge sits at a crossroads, a meeting place of the Los Angeles River and Coldwater Canyon, that has been a center of social activity and an icon of Ventura Boulevard throughout the history of the San Fernando Valley. Historically, through several eras of significance, its natural springs have drawn people to this place, and its 21st-century reimagination builds on this tradition.\n\nThe main social space is the Canyon Pass through the new retail development, which celebrates the charismatic geography of the valley, river, and mountain landscapes. The design creates a landscape that magnifies the most historic qualities of the Sportsmen’s Lodge, an inviting, visually rich, and tactile open space through the creative use of water and lush plantings.\n\nFormerly a parking lot the size of a city block, Simon and Helen Director Park is now a vibrant urban piazza in downtown Portland. The park, built entirely atop an underground parking garage, has created a variety of public spaces within the site's compact footprint, with a range of microclimates, amenities and activities. A glass and wood trellis stands out as a signature element of the plaza, offering shaded seating and a café without disrupting views throughout the space. An interactive fountain element anchors the northwest corner of the site, partially bordered by an ipe wood bench, and on the southern edge, a small grove of trees frames a giant, whimsical chessboard. Amid this vibrant civic experience, the park also incorporates strategies for urban greening and stormwater management, including a green roof on the café, planting beds which filter and reserve runoff for irrigation, and even the trellis and paving, which are designed to direct rainfall into the park’s catchment system.\n\nLocated next to Target Field, the station serves as a central, multi-modal transportation hub and community gathering space in downtown Minneapolis. A catalyst for neighborhood redevelopment, the $82 million design-build project provided 300 new jobs during its construction, and created new community park space for the North Loop neighborhood and historic Warehouse District. The station links 488 trains from light and commuter transit networks, and connects daily bus operation and miles of biking and walking trails linked within the Twin Cities Metropolitan area. The interchange includes an urban plaza with areas for neighborhood bars and eateries, cultural amenities, and entertainment. A great lawn in the upper plaza serves as a central green “stage,” providing new space for pre-game events, community concerts, and seasonal events. Located atop a parking structure, the project provides for 250 additional parking spaces within the transit hub. The landscape and infrastructure are fully integrated, with stormwater cisterns that can hold over 40,000 gallons. Stormwater filtering and reuse have reduced runoff from the Target Field Station site by 27% and total suspended solids in the runoff by 97%.\n\nOLIN’s landscape design is a synthesis of the U.S. government’s goals for sustainability, security, accessibility and design excellence; with a team led by KieranTimberlake, OLIN crafted an embassy design that gives form to the core beliefs of democracy—transparency, openness, and equality—in a way that is at once secure, welcoming, and sustainable. OLIN’s competition winning landscape is a contemporary approach to the English tradition of urban parks and gardens as the context for civic buildings. The design’s spiraling walks and sculpted meadow terrains form the Embassy grounds, winding into the lobby and promenade overlooking a freshwater pond and the Thames to the north. The landscape design expresses these ideas formally but also through the selection of landscape materials. The spiral continues up through the building in interior gardens based on six significant American landscapes. Plantings chosen for the project were selected on the basis of commonalities between species common to the United Kingdom and the U.S.—a result of their being brought by English settlers and explorers to the New World. The result is a true embodiment of the United States’ deep bond with the U.K., the embassy’s connection to the city and people of London, and the fundamental tenets of American democracy.\n\nThe Fairmount Water Works Park Amenities and Island Enhancements projects represent the final site initiatives in a comprehensive revitalization of the Schuylkill River’s edge. The project is comprised of three main elements: the Italian Fountain Plaza, the River’s Edge and the Island. Along with the restoration of the Italian Fountain itself, improvements to the paving, planting, and seating transformed the formerly isolated and non-functioning fountain in a parking circle into an accessible, vibrant place of comfort and respite. Improvements to the River’s Edge provided new universally accessible paths throughout the entire site, including—for the first time—access to the island. A stone retaining wall used as a grade-changing device also doubles as the backdrop for a gracious series of wooden benches, and a bio-swale collects water from adjacent areas and conveys it to an infiltration garden, which retains and cleanses site stormwater while providing opportunities to educate the public on the processes involved in water conservation. A simple pedestrian bridge provides access to the island, which, with an accessible boardwalk and gathering platforms, offers a unique view of the Schuylkill’s riparian ecologies, and helps reveal the diverse flora associated with the gentle changes in elevation and moisture content of the soil. Native plants create a diversified and stable plant community and increase habitat for the island’s plants and animals.\n\nLocated in the heart of downtown Redding, Whistle Stop Park honors the city’s long-standing connection to the California and Oregon Railroad. With its permanent stage and central location, the park will host special events and be welcoming for everyday passive use. It establishes a 1,600-square foot area of vibrant civic realm within a two-acre mixed-use, transformational effort known as Redding Block 7. The $111-million Block 7 project improves housing access through 78 affordable residences available at mixed-income rates from 30% to 80% of the area’s median. The development also focuses on diversifying local businesses, increasing outdoor comfort, improving pedestrian connectivity, and increasing bicycle mobility.\n\nAs the integral hub of the larger development project, Whistle Stop Park provides a variety of uses and programming possibilities to attract both residents and visitors. The park features abundant shade to mitigate intense summer heat, a multifunctioning performance kiosk, a playful lawn, varied seating options, and a cooling mist garden inspired by the regional geology and ecology of Redding. The park is a refreshing microclimate oasis and a comfortable public amenity for passive and active use throughout the year.\n\nCommunity leaders have been working hard for several years to lay the groundwork for this downtown revitalization project. Block 7 is a joint effort by The McConnell Foundation, K2 Development, and The City of Redding and was created through the design collaboration of OLIN, Modus Studio, and DMARCstudio. Modern Building is the general contractor.\n\nWillis Tower stands as an icon of modern architecture, however for decades the base of the tower created an unwelcoming urban environment. The reimagination of the ground levels creates a vibrant streetscape, atrium, and roof park that is an amenity for people who work in the building but also nearby residents.\n\nWhile still respecting needs for security, the previously closed off spaces around the building are now open to pedestrians, and rich textures and materials along the streetscape honor the famous gridded architecture of the tower. On the fourth floor roof park, the curving geometry interrupts the architectural grid and references the winding rivers of the Midwestern landscape with a native palette of prairie grasses and trees."
