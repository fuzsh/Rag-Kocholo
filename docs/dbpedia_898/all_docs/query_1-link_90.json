It was such a success that it was used again in 1959.\n\nIts owner and sponsor, the Mid-Continent Supply, donated it to the Tulsa County Fairgrounds Trust Authority and built the current and permanent version for the 1966 Expo.\n\nIt is 76 ft. (23 m) tall and designed to withstand winds of up to 200 mph. It contains 2.5 miles of steel rods and mesh and is covered in concrete. Its hand rests on a real oil derrick.\n\nIt is said to be the largest free-standing statue in the world and weighs 43,500 lb.\n\nCyrus Avery Centennial Place and Gateway\n\nLocation: Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza. Southwest Blvd. and Riverside Dr.\n\nEast Meets West Sculpture\n\nThe bronze sculpture 20 feet tall by 40 feet shows the Avery family in a 1926 Ford encountering an oil-cart.

The two-bay garage was added to the original 1926 station in 1940, and then, the old office was demolished and replaced with the new office in the 50s, using large glass windows and the green trim that identified the Cities Service Co. brand.\n\nRoute 66 Historical Village\n\nLocation: 3770 Southwest Blvd, Tulsa, OK\n\nThe Route 66 Historical Village is an open-air museum with some large artifacts.

The fish became a whale, and it was a big one too.\n\nHe made an iron framework for the body, 80 ft. long and 20 ft. tall and covered it with cement. The making of the whale took two years and was completed in July 1972. People would come and swim in the pond and slide off the whale's tail.\n\nThe Blue Whale closed in 1988, and Davis passed away in 1990. It is now owned by Dee Dee (Davis) Belt and her husband and was refurbished in 1997 by the Catoosa Chamber of Commerce.\n\nPraying Hands\n\nLocation: 7777 South Lewis, Tulsa, OK\n\nTulsa is known as the \"buckle of the Bible Belt\" and is the site of Oral Roberts University and the university's Prayer Tower.\n\nAt the entrance to campus is the statue of the \"praying hands\", which is 60 feet (18 m) tall and the largest bronze sculpture in the world, it was cast in Mexico in 1980."
