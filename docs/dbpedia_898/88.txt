Route 66 in Tulsa, Oklahoma

After traveling through Galena, Riverton and Baxter Springs, Kansas, Route 66 entered Commerce, Oklahoma, and headed southwest through Miami, Chelsea, Claremore and into Tulsa.

Once inside Tulsa, Route 66 traversed the city east-to-west on 11th Street into downtown, crossed the Arkansas River, and headed westbound to Sapulpa, Davenport, Chandler, Arcadia and Oklahoma City.

As other segments of Route 66, alignments around Tulsa varied and improved over the years.

In general, it followed the route of present-day Interstate I-44.

The city is known for its art deco architecture in the central Deco District. Landmarks like the Philcade and Philtower buildings reflect a 20th-century construction boom fueled by the prosperous local oil industry. It is often called "The Oil Capital of the World". The city is home to Oral Roberts University, the University of Tulsa and the University of Oklahoma - Tulsa.

"You Said We Couldn't Do It" Mural

This mural commemorates a bridge built over the Arkansas River in Tulsa in 1904. The bridge wasnât for rail traffic, so investors considered it a risky project. The government wouldnât pay for it either. Instead, three citizens formed a toll company and paid for the bridge, a huge undertaking both financially and logistically due to the shifting river bed.

On the completed bridge they hung a sign, âYou Said We Couldnât Do It, But We Did.â

Located in the Meadow Gold District - 1306 E. 11th Street at S. Peoria Avenue

The Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza

Two plazas in Tulsa celebrate Historic Route 66 and Cyrus Avery: Centennial Plaza on the east bank of the Arkansas River, and Southwest Plaza on the west bank.

Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza looking west from the Skyway

The Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza is named for the Tulsa resident who is known as "The Father of Route 66". It is located at the east entrance to the historic Route 66 bridge near downtown Tulsa. The first phase of the plaza, dedicated in 2008, included a display of flags from all eight states through which Route 66 traversed.

A Skyway with observation deck leads pedestrians from the visitors parking lot across Southwest Boulevard to the plaza.

The park and sculptures are an artistic representation of the use of automobiles and highways spreading across the country in the late 1920s and 30s. Future plans for the Avery Centennial Plaza include a visitor’s center and the Route 66 Interpretive Center, to be located on the hill beside the Skywalk. It will feature Route 66 exhibits, historical perspectives, restaurants and gift shop.

Centennial Plaza is located at the east entrance to the historic bridge at the intersection of Southwest Boulevard and Riverside Drive.

A visit to Centennial Plaza is highly recommended for Route 66 fans!

The Sculptures

East Meets West: Symbolic Route 66 Midpoint

The scene in Centennial Plaza depicts the Avery family riding west in a Motel T Ford, meeting an eastbound horse-drawn carriage. He, his wife, his daughter and their pet cat are all in the Model T traveling down Route 66. They suddenly come across an oil field waggoneer whose team of horses are scared by the new sounds of a combustion engine. The sculptures are the work of Robert Summers.

Route 66 Bridge Over the Arkansas River

Directly west of Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza is the original Eleventh Street Bridge bridge built in 1915 to carry Route 66 over the Arkansas River. It is located between newer bridges on Southwest Boulevard and Interstate 244, and was closed to traffic in 1980 although it remained open for pedestrians for a time.

Gates were locked on the bridge in 2008, and it remains closed to both vehicular and pedestrian traffic today. The old bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and re-named the Cyrus Avery Route 66 Memorial Bridge.

Earlier Times on Route 66: Vintage Views of Tulsa

What was Route 66 like in its earlier years, as visitors drove around or through Tulsa? What did all the service stations, motels and public buildings look like when they were new?

What did the traveling public experience on the Mother Road? We wonder such things when we travel Route 66 today.

Those earlier times in the 1930s, 40s and 50s were not always captured on film. But the use of colorful postcards was common in those decades.

We have included below a sampling of our collection of vintage travel postcards showing scenes in Tulsa. These portray the city in its earlier years and help us to visualize "yesterday" as we drive Route 66 today.
