Set to folk music anarchist punk, or weird post-punk, we’re assaulted with pleas, information, and harangues about the abuses to both the human species and animalkind.

Antietam Antietam LP

Definitely the punk equivalent of middle period JEFFERSON AIRPLANE. The “punk” side comes from the PATTI SMITH-ish vocalist, though both sides she and the male vocalist hit higher notes. Musically, it’s a jazzy/folky rockish band with tough, punkish power (at times).

This band unveils a new variety of hardcore—”destructo rock”—which sounds for all the world like gruff and grungy mid-tempo thrash. ANTISEEN can’t boast great songwriting skills, but I still enjoyed the irrepressible aggro and rebelliousness of their output. A pretty good release.

More tuneful than most Finnish thrash, this band employs melody, and clean production and playing; because of this, there’s more of a British feel to this six-song release.

A fine slab of sludge rock from Durham, North Carolina. This music plants itself firmly in between the trashiness of the GUN CLUB and the garage sound of 100 FLOWERS. Three members dress in leather and one in paisley, and that’s pretty much the sound—3/4 punk and 1/4 psychedelic.

Two defunct Chicago-area bands share the honors on this split EP. DEAD FINK produces raw but hook-filled punkers of which “Home in a Grave” is particularly outstanding; HAPPY TOONS alternate between a careening thrash assault and some weird metal-tinged structures, but they’re crude enough to get away with it.

Tall Boys Final Kick 12″

Part of that unique mixture of rockabilly and ’60s punk that some modern bands are conjuring up, TALL BOYS’ blend renders a result that works. Purists of both genres might be unhappy, most rock’n’rollers will be mighty pleased. Interesting cover of “Action Woman.”

Terminal Sunglasses Wrap Around Cool LP

Goofy punky rock new wave Á la ’77. Satirical lyrics combined with surfy/folky/jazzy music with an edge. Sort of like FRANK ZAPPA meets early MYSTIC KNIGHTS OF OINGO BOINGO.

The Bollock Brothers ’77 ’78 ’79 LP

Various punk celebrities from the old days offer their talents for this album of slower, ’77-oriented material. The absence of energy in the tempos put me off initially, but there’s some very palatable SEX PISTOL-ian material here, albeit cleaner and more refined. A decent record.

The Conditionz Weird America LP

Really enjoyable pop/punk in an older punk style, not unlike the path STRANGLEHOLD took. Roughly translated, that means lotsa hooks, pop structures, clean production, pounding drums, vocal back-ups, and tough guitar. Good.

The Fall Couldn’t Get Ahead / Rollin’ Dany 7″

The FALL are getting easier and easier to take on the first listen. This 45 chronicles a day in the life of a terminal loser over a scrappy, howling song with blasts of harmonica. This flip has the first cover tune they’ve ever done, and it draws more of a rockabilly sound out of this line-up.

The Jesus and Mary Chain You Trip Me Up / Just Out of Reach 7″

Scott says they sound like a cross between psychedelia and a trebly FLIPPER. Dogtowne says they’re pretentious pretenders to the VELVET UNDERGROUND’s second LP. Whatever, they do combine pop tunes with incredibly abrasive guitar noise and feedback to produce a highly listenable product.

The Micronotz The Beast That Devoured Itself LP

A new singer has joined the former merely MORTALS, adding some really gruff punky vocals. This is added to their garage Midwestern rock’n’roll sound and clean playing, for a pop/punk record that REPLACEMENTS fans should enjoy.

Excellent release that crosses post-punk with ’60s psych in a modern powerful way. Reminds a bit of fellow Australians LIME SPIDERS, and with this debut US release (this label will be presenting a lot of Aussie bands to the US) the SPIKES will make their mark.

The Stalin For Never 2xLP

This is the last testament for the STALIN, a two-record live recording. Forsaking their earlier harder-edged punk and thrash, the preponderance of songs here are harder-edged post-punk/rock punk. While not a “weak” release by any means, I found myself bored at times with the long dirges, and not excited enough by the shorter slaps. I’m spoiled by their older records.

Thee Fourgiven It Ain’t Pretty Down Here LP

This trio cranks out some cool ’60s punk, especially on the instrumental side. At times, they remind me of SYNDICATE OF SOUND, maybe even a bit tougher. But the singer tries to “sing” too much, instead of snarl, and I found that a bit annoying. Otherwise, cool band and record.

Probably the only English band to truly understand American garage trash, that wonderful mixture of R’n’B and white teen angst. These incredibly prolific guys couldn’t care less that it’s not 1963, whirling on in a world of their own fueled by surf, Mersey, DIDDLEY, KINK-dom, and KINGSMEN. Boss.

True West Shot You Down / 1969 7″

On the A-side, TRUE WEST showcases a neo-generic pop style that’s so soft and unassuming that it left me completely uninvolved. The STOOGES cover on the flip, though, musters up some excitement despite the band’s continual tendency to squelch its own power. Lacks heart.

United Mutation Rainbow Person EP

The compositions on this release from UNITED MUTATION sacrifice the thrashiness of their debut for a spookier, more atmospheric approach—but it works. Churning arrangements, an aggressive HC energy, and those trademark laryngitis vocals team up to good effect especially on “Take Your Pick.” Solid and recommendable.

I guess this is where we start hitting the dross of Greg Shaw’s collection. Instead of great, nasty fuzzy punk songs from the ’60s, we’re treated to wimpy pop bands masquerading as hip political folk rock (aargh!). Although the two tracks by the GRAVEYARD 5 are pretty cool, it’s getting harder and harder to recommend this series when there are excellent compilations elsewhere.

A 50/50 proposition. The bands, with the likes of FRITES MODERN, PORNO PATROL, MAU MAUS, UPRIGHT CITIZENS, DOA, etc. are world-class, and the songs are uniformly excellent. Unfortunately, most of the recordings were culled from hand-held walkman cassettes, which doesn’t help the sound quality. I must admit that the excitement comes through, though.

Despite a well-drawn but obnoxious macho cover with blatant evocations of violence, the third Chaos Production compilation proves to be another very strong release. This one has bands from all over Europe on if, thereby extending its range and variety. Herein one can find the standard French-style skunk (KOMINTERN SECT, REICH ORGASM, L’ENFANTS SAUVAGES, and Spain’s DECIBELIOS), catchy pop punk (AL KAPOTT, DREI ORLOK, Spain’s TNT, Holland’s NV LE ANDEREN, and a killer cut from Sweden’s ASTA KASK) pure Oi (BRUTAL COMBAT and Italy’s NABAT), and all sorts of punk (the KAMBRONES, Germany’s F.F.F. and NEUROTIC ARSEHOLES, and Sweden’s SLAM). Highly recommended.

Rockabilly, the punk of its time, meets today’s punk in Psychobilly, some of the results are recorded herein. While the METEORS (who appear here) broke this trend, tons of bands have followed.

Three fine Spanish outfits (ODIO SOCIAL, ANTI-DOGMATIKSS, and AUTODEFENSA) share this 15-song tape—and each of the bands have something special to offer.

A well-diversified sampler with thrash mayhem from the STUPIDS, Oi-type sounds from SAMPLES and PROTEST, power Britpunk from DEATH ZONE, SELF-ABUSE, ATROX, and ANNIHILATED, and the post-punk melodies of QUEL DOMMAGE with crazy blurbs between each song.

Maybe I’m getting spoiled by all the great Italian HC releases of late, because this comp just doesn’t reach the energy or excitement level I’ve grown accustomed to. Most of the bands here (BASTA, CANI, DIOXINA, HOPE & GLORY, ROUGH, SS20, KLAXON, among others) turn in older-style punk or Oi sounds that just don’t overwhelm. Even the normally excellent NABAT doesn’t really break through.
