        "text": "MANY HANDS IN THE FLIPSIDE FANZINE COOKIE JAR\n\nWhich band was on both Volume 1 and 2 ?\n\nMy Dell computer got Covid19 and is now at Docs. A rather new one for having issues with Dell and Windows. But shit happens. It is good too because I got out an older computer and cleaned it and upgraded the software and it is running very nicely. It cannot use any of my Adobe programs but that is OK. At least it can go online and work here on my WordPress site.\n\nIn the process I came across some stuff I was doing that needs to be followed through with. So, I will do it now.\n\nHere are the two vinyl fanzines vol. 1 and 2 through “Flipside / Gasatanka.” Mighty amazing at the time for a growing punk scene. I am grateful to the bands. The contributions to our fan base were well received and the promotion did not hurt either.\n\nWorking with Al and Bill was fun and I never quite knew where the boat was sailing but we ran a tight ship and got to shore. Then got these records on the deck for distribution.\n\nA time when bands, fanzines, records labels and others worked together without big heads but instead with a real love of the music we supported in so many ways.\n\nI did the layouts for the inserts and helped where I could with the more in-depth recording and promotional aspects of getting these out. And to the other artists and executives … thank you too, you know who you are. Lots of hands in the Flipside cookie jar.\n\nAl and Bill were a dynamic duo to work with and, as the third fanatic, we three did good for the love of a punk scene. You are welcome even Black Market Baby is welcomed, though I don’t know why?\n\nDick wad….\n\nBands on vol. 1\n\nDickies “Gigantor (Live Cleveland Agoura)”\n\nGovernment Issue “Religious Ripoff”\n\nThe Freeze “No One Is Ever Coming Home”\n\nWhite Flag “Question of Intelligence”\n\nKraut “Floating with an E String”\n\nF “Attack”\n\nPlain Wrap “Meat Between the Treads”\n\nFlag of Democracy “Madhouse”\n\nTSOL “Suppose They Gave A War’’\n\nAdrenalin O.D. “Me Three Bunch”\n\nScream “Fight”\n\nUndead “In Eighty-Four”\n\nF.U.S “Warlords (Live on WERS FM Boston)”\n\nBlack Market Baby “Total Waste”\n\nPsycho “Master Race’”\n\nGay Cowboys in Bondage “Domestic Battlefield”\n\nBorscht “Suburbia”\n\nAnti Scrunti Faction “Big Woman”\n\nCharged GBH “Give Me Fire (Live at Perkins Palace Pasadena)”\n\nBands on vol. 2\n\nMIA “Just A Dream”\n\nDecry “Island Paradise”\n\nOut Patients “Backwards Explosion”\n\nNaked Raygun “Metastasis”\n\nRoach Motel “Mad Dog”\n\nJFA “Out of School (Live)”\n\nMassacre Guys “Let’s Forget”\n\nVagina Dentata “Golden Boys”\n\nPlain Wrap “Magnetic Shoes”\n\nD.I. “Johnny’s Got A Problem”\n\nMisfits “Attitude (LIVE)”\n\nNecros “Walking the DOG”\n\nC2D “Aggressive System”\n\nIconoclast “Dominion or Destruction”\n\nCheetah Chrome Motherfuckers “No Wordz”\n\nDisorderly Conduct “How Old Are You”\n\nCatatonics “Descending in “E””\n\nBraille Party “Let It Burn”\n\nGerms “Forming”\n\nGKH “Dickermann”\n\nAgent Orange “Shakin’ All Over”\n\nArt above by Shawn Warcot below John Crawford.\n\nHudley Inserts…\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAnti Scrunti Faction were a queercore punk trio from Boulder, Colorado. 😄\n\nIt is amazing to think back and realize how regular mail correspondence through the US Postal service was the spine of the Punk Rock movement. I can say I was a punk rock correspondent entrepreneur. This is how I met Leslie Mah and Tracie Thomas of A.S.F. During the punk scene of the 1980s, tapes and correspondence were part of our lives and I was taken by the gals of A.S.F., mostly because women were not a big staple of the scene we had grown to know. I made it happen and we put out their record. Women, punk rock, politics, sexuality, racism, and abounding creativity is the loud heartfelt sarcasm that emanates from this band. I remember making vegetarian spaghetti in our kitchen with Leslie. Taking Leslie and Tracie to the beach was a real treat. I got my first tattoos with the A.S.F. girls. A contrary experience for me because at the same time we were working with the bands Doggy Style and Detox. Some of my best memories of co-running a fanzine. Leslie Mah and Tracie Thomas went on to have an interesting life creatively and I am happy for them. Look them up you may be surprised.\n\nOne can listen here…\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Anti-Scrunti-Faction-Damsels-In-Distress/release/2004128\n\n(From the original Flipside CATALOG)\n\nThis is the debut LP by Boulder Colorado A.S.F.~Anti Scrunti Faction, a joint release by Flipside and Unclean Records. “Damsels in Distress” features the very colorful artwork of Leslie Mah, the band’s bass player and singer. Inside you’ll find 18 thought provoking tunes, a lot of which deal with a woman’s view of the punk rock scene as well as the world. – and it is no wonder -two women in this band. This critically acclaimed punk classic features these songs: “Boys will be Boys.” “Sugar and Spice,” Writhe like Worms,” “Big Dick,” Resist The lies,” “Marshall Law,” “War, War, War,” “One Crashed over The Cuckoo’s Nest,” “Brain Transplant,” “Ohpmyn,” “3005 E. Euclid,” “Suicide Note,” “Another Love Song,” “Silent Death,” “In My Heart,” “Innocent Victim,” “Johnny,” and ” Slave to My Estrogen ,” A.S.F. and their song, “Slave to My Estrogen,” is featured in Flipside Video 11.\n\nA note….\n\nMIA is a Flipside Records Band too! After the Fact (LP, 1987, Flipside Records) and Flipside Vinyl Fanzine Vol. 2 (1985) includes “Just A Dream” 😸\n\nOriginally out on Flipside Records….\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHey original John Crawford Artwork on the back cover. Revolutionary Fetus says\n\n“Support Flipside Vinyl Fanzine # 2 or face a bleak and unlivable future.”\n\nHattie Jacques plays Nanette Parry from film Make Mine Mink (1960).\n\nAgain, from the original Flipside “CATALOG.” As written at that place and time in history by yours truly. I don’t know why I excluded Flipside Vinyl Fanzine Number One, maybe at the time we ran out of them for sale. Yet I will include it later in my gathering of Intellectual Property … my journey to bring together what was lost on the internet wasteland. (If only symbolically)\n\nA friendly gesture to remember what seems vague in my senior years. Thank you for indulging my fiery drive. As Emma Jung, wife of Swiss psychologist and psychiatrist Carl Jung, said and I paraphrase, “Sometimes a dame has got to do something for herself that no one else fucking understands, who cares cause she knows why she is doing it… for her own soul.” There now that feels better. I am just in the gathering phase. I call it Phase A.\n\nIncluded below is some remarkable history about the process of creating this Vinyl Fanzine. Many hands in the cookie Jar. Heartfelt Thanks!!\n\nFlipside Vinyl Fanzine Number Two with loads of bands.\n\nSide One we have MIA “Just A Dream.” Decry “Island Paradise.” Out Patients “Backwards Explosion.” Naked Raygun “Metastasis.” Roach Motel “Mad Dog.” JFA “Out of School.” Massacre Guys “Let’s Forget.” Vagina Dentata “Golden Boys.” Plan Wrap “Magnetic Shoes.”\n\nSide Two we have DI “Johnny’s Got A problem.” Misfits “Attitude.” Necros “Walking the Dog.” C2D” Aggression System.” Iconoclast “Domination or Destruction.” Cheetah Chrome and the Motherfuckers “No Words.” Disorderly Conduct “How Old Are You.” Catatonics “Descending In “E.” Braille Party “Let It Burn.” Germs “Forming.” (I’m sorry for saying mean things about Darby in Ink Disease Fanzine, he was just such a stinker.” GKH “Dickerman.” Agent Orange “Shakin’ All Over.”\n\n“Chaz”, as he was known to most, was guitarist for Eddie and the Subtitles, a local punk band that was influential on younger Fullerton punks as the Adolescents and Social Distortion, both of which recorded their early demos and singles at Casbah and continued recording albums there as their popularity grew.\n\n“I don’t think they shared musical tastes” stated Michael Hutchinson, producer for Billy Idol and Berlin, observing “I don’t know how excited Chaz was about Berlin – he was more excited about punk stuff.”\n\nYet there was an excitement that came from the blending of the two distinct cultures: one typified by Chaz and his cronies’ slacker ethos, the other by St. James and his commercial sensibilities and keen awareness of musical trends. After the success of Stacey Q’s Better Than Heaven, St. James deferred ownership of The Casbah to Ramirez.”\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casbah_Recording_Studio\n\nNew Casbah Recording Studio\n\nhttp://casbahrecording.com/\n\n“Bill Bartell~ His contributions to the punk rock scene were numerous between writing, playing in his band and releasing records on his now-defunct Gasatanka Records label.”\n\nR.I.P.
