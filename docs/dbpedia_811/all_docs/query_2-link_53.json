CANADA T5B 3E7 o PERSONAL CHEuK 60 m ne NEW AGE RECORDS 1585 N. HIGH ST, COLUMBUS, OHIO 43201 BALE-INC OUT Dear Jeff Bale: We just formed a band here in Hamtramck and practice all the time and are getting pretty tight. We're gonna record a tape and send it to you guys so you can tell us what you think. All of our friends like us, and we are quite happy with ourselves, but there is much arguing and disagreement between band members as to what is Jeff Bale's allowable guitar solo time limit. I (the guitarist), say that there is no time limit, but the limit is 4 bars of oodelee oodeiing. The bassist says a guitar solo shouldn't take up more time than 1 verse in the song. The drummer say§ that (he thinks) you don't care how long the solo is, as long as it's good . How stupid. What is good ? K. K. Downing is good, but I wouldn't put any of that shit in any of my songs. Our singer says no guitar solos is your limit. So could you please let us (and the world) know about how long is the shortest path through lame guitar solo land? Sincerely, Disinfect/ Hamtrack, Ml Dear DISINFECT: Since I know that the whole world is holding its breath awaiting my response to this crucially important question. I'll have to make the results of my extensive research into the problem public. After years of analysis, I've discovered that the most acceptable length for guitar solos is 3.78567 seconds. Seriously,, though, I like my solos short, primitive, and to the point, and consider 4 bars of oodelee oodeiing more than enough. Jeff STEPE-ING IN SHIT Dear MRR : I am writing this letter to get an understanding of the people who listen to hardcore today. Recently (in New York anyway), heavy metal and hardcore are played together at shows and on the radio and many hardcore bands do BLACK SABBATH and other HM songs. What I want to know is why? Hardcore and heavy metal are both fast and hard, but as far as I'm concerned, that's where the relationship ends. I thought the reason punk came about was to get away from the pretentious, flashy, self-indulgence of rock n'roll. So why are people bringing it back ? I know this letter will bother a lot of people because they listened to HM before they got into hardcore and still enjoy it (which I see nothing wrong with), but how can you mix 2 philosophies together? When I first got into ^punk I saw it as a philosophy and still do. I live straight edge and according to my philosophy of life. And while other peoples' may differ, I don't see how a HM philosophy mixes with a HC philosophy. If you think there is no philosophy to either one you are wrong-there is! I am looking forward to seeing what others have to say about this. I know people will feel I am closed-minded but I am really just the opposite. The fusion of HM and HC is limiting the bands and their music. I see the music as becoming more and more alike and being wound into a tight ball instead of extending and growing. The new bands all prescribe to the same formula of what a HC band should sound like. People are building walls instead of tearing them down. Well, I'm straying into a different area now. I just want to remind you of the purpose of this letter, which is to understand people who mix HM and HC . I do not wish to condemn although I might seem that way. I just get very angry when punks, skins, etc., come down on me for listening to ska, reggae and English post-punk while enjoying hardcore when they are banging their heads to BLACK SABBATH. Thankyou, Vickk, Bronx, NY Dear MRR: I'm going to start this band and our sound is going to be Big Band-HC. We're going to play Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller songs thrash style. Just kidding folks. But is it any less ridiculous that heavy metal should influence hardcore. To me, heavy metal is meathead music and has everything that I'm against; exaggerated masculinity, pretensions to being \"musicians\", guitar solos, sexism, and general ignorance of reality in favor of science fiction and/or satanic themes. Where I came from (Peoria) heavy metal is the music of rednecks. It goes with long hair, hiking boots, 4-wheel drive pickup trucks, and kegs of Busch to party\"! I started listening to punk because it was intelligent as well as being loud and obnoxious. To the defenders of heavy metal who listen because hardcore all sounds the same and is going nowhere. You are full of shit. Hardcore may have its problems, but that is no excuse to listen to the music that punk/HC was developed as an alternative to. I think the reason that some hardcore people listen to metal is that they are sick of (what they perceive as) being preached at and in general bored with HC. They want music that asks of its fans only that they \"bang their head\" and the ever famous \"party\". In closing. I'd like to say that metal threatens punk because the HM style is even more stilted than the loud /fast style that has made hardcore boring in some cases. James Moran/ 1231B GTS/ Dekalb IL 60115 after May 4: 1034 W. Teton/ Peoria IL 61614 yours, Barry Stepe P.S.: Sausages!! And I don't hate all longhairs, just metalheads. Dear MRR, I would like to address this letter to Barry Stepe from Peoria, IL. Barry, your life's a mess! Who are you to say Heavy Metal sucks? Your band. UNACCEPTED has always been at the top of my list as one of the greatest bands around. But when you start sayin' Heavy Metal sucks that really pisses me off. I don't think you know enough about life, bud. When you get bigger and meaner than me, you can say it. Until then. Mil be the one to judge music in this part of Central Illinois. Matt Rousey/ 204 W Miller/ Bloomington IL Dear MRR : I am writing to discuss an incident that occurred in El Paso this past summer when Finland's RIISTETYT and Italy's RAW POWER came here to play a show at the local all age place. The show itself was great; it was a pleasure to see European bands, and the crowd dug it, especially the set by RAW POWER, but there is a t0 the event * !t seems that RIISTETYT stayed at a local musician's house after the show, and they made a quite expensive ($120) phone call to their native land. Of course they didn't bother to tell the guy that put them up; he found out when his dad got the bill. Now, you might say \"the guy was dumb for leaving his phone out\", but RIISTETYT surely knew what they were doing. The guy that set up the tour, Chris of Bad Compilation Tapes in San Diego, was notified, and he told us that this also happened to several other people around the U.S. (They got some poor person in Chicago for $300 or so!) He assured us he is working to assess and repay damages, but it looks doubtful these victims will ever be repaid. I suggest that any money Chris /BCT makes off selling RIISTETYT tapes be given to the people this band ripped off, and that promoters around the country avoid booking this and other bands that rip off and destroy honest peoples' property. Actually, we'll probably never see RIISTETYT again in the U.S.; they seemed pretty wimpy and fucked up. I welcome any reply from RIISTETYT and other interested parties. Mucky Pup/ Sick Harold/ Box 627/ Clint TX~79836 Dear MRR, I still hate metal and metalheads! I got a lot of encouraging, but I also got some hate mail from my anti-metal letter. To Marcia: You can call me narrowminded, but I don't think I am. I can handle any music except metal. I listen to all types of music, but metal sucks the big wazoo! I'm not saying hate metal cuz I do. I'm also not saying all longhairs are bozos. I'm talking about the stupid, slimy skids! I don't consider it stereotyping when every (well, most every) single metalhead I met in my short but fruitful life is a dickhead. Hey, even I listened to metal when I wuz a youngster, but I knew of no alternative. After finding the soothing sounds of punk rock in 7th grade (I'm a sophomore in college now), I can't understand why people would go back in a time warp to that shit. I'm just pissed cuz a few people thought, \"Hey, let's be metal,\" and now almost every band is growing their hair and learning AC /DC riffs because it's so \"punk\". Sorry to offend all ye faithful readers, but this is just nw opinion (even though Peoria punks feel the same way). If you don't like it, I don't care, but don't come running to me when yer scene is invaded by a bunch of burned out metalheads. Send more hate mail, I think it's cool, man, cool! Joyfully Dear MRR: Hello from Florida! Because of the indescribable response to a letter of mine which MRR printed a while ago, I would only be a fool not to voice my opinion again in a magazine that prints letters just as they are written, (tsk tsk to you others) . It's been three months now since MRR printed the complaint I wrote concerning the marketing and censorship of HC/punk records. Since the letter was printed there has been an absolute turnaround in the store policy of the record chain that I am employed by in Fla. Seems that now not only is the company encouraging me, but are also encouraging other store managers to increase their HC/punk selection by 50%. Somehow the word got back to the big cheese of the company, who proceeded to look up the profits my particular store was making on its punk section. Upon seeing that this product sells, well, let's just say that there will be many more punk record stores along the Southeast coast. I urge all people from all over the world to write to MRR— it works! ! And I have no doubts that it will work again. You see, though the Gay Rights movement may have taken effect in California, here in Florida it is ignored— especially among the punks. It's time to realize that one equals one, no matter how you look at it. I was recently kicked out of a band (DISORDERLY CONDUCT) for having a \"relationship\" with a certain member of California band who flew out to South Fla. recently. Obviously I am not worried about being in the band, I am worried about the recognition of a human being, namely me. I was widely the target of abuse by most S. Fla. bands (especially \"F\") who were laughing at me. I felt comforted to be the one to laugh back. . .but my laugh was the laugh of pity. Pity for their ignorance. I have since joined a different S. Fla. band whom I understand are doing pretty well in California— the GAY COWBOYS IN BONDAGE, (humorous name). Though they are not gay themselves, at least I know that I will bb treated as an equal should be. Please write back with any comments (or childish threats). Scot Lade/ Orange Blossom Mall/ 4118 Okeechobee Rd/ Ft. Pierce, FL 33450 Dear MRR : I am writing this letter the day after I saw BLACK FLAG in Chicago. To get the story straight, BLACK FLAG, the first time they were to be here with their new line- up, back in April, cancelled their show at the Metro. I called Metro to find out why, and they told me because BF wasn't getting enough money. What I did was drive with a friend to Detroit to see them. Five hours to see BF, MEAT PUPPETS, and NIG-HEIST . Great time! Then they came to Chicago in August. Not bad (except for Henry getting off on letting everyone touch his hair! ) Then they were to come again in October. I went to TicketMaster to pick up a ticket, and behold $10. Now let me think. $10 to see Henry? So, I made the big decision. I bought the fucking ticket. BLACK FLAG cancelled the day of the show, and were to come back later. They did. For THIRTEEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS!!! (I mean, I can see the 50C, but $13?) At the beginning of the show, I aired my disappointment to Henry with a \"What the fuck is with the $13.50!\" He replied snot-like and said \"Oh, I'm the one that makes the prices!\" Then, waving his hands, said \"Why don't you leave?!\" — It Was a damn good idea! Now I can say that I WAS one of the biggest fans of BLACK FLACT When there was Chuck & Dez & Chuck, and Henry used to dive out in the audience. Now Henry is a teen-idol who can't put on more than shorts and whose ego is un-surpassed . Henry and his cast of bouncers didn't allow one stage- diver. Maybe all the boos, fuck yous, and spitting they deservedly got will keep them away. Here is a band that charges $1 just for their lyric sheet--to know the fucking words! Trash it, Henry! Sounds like a story about the EXPLOITED. Sincerely, Tom Foster/ 9521 Greenwood Dr. / Des Plaines, IL 60016. PS--Henry, I'd love to hear from you. We could talk about your new album! P.P.S.—For $13.50 and no stagediving, I was expecting DURAN DURAN (and seats) . FLYNN-FLAMMED A Warning to All Touring Bands: On December 31st (New Year's Eve) two New Jersey bands, ADRENALIN O.D. and BEDLAM were bamboozled by a promoter/ club owner named Sharon Flynn. Let me tell you first the deal these bands were promised before I get into the contradicting outcome. The name of the club is Flynn's. It is in a hotel called Ocean 71 on the beach in Miami, Florida. A. O.D. and BEDLAM were promised $500 to split among themselves. This price was to cover the plane fare for 3 members of A. O.D. who could not take off a week from work to drive down with BEDLAM. Deli platters and hotel rooms were used as a lure to make the whole New Years extravaganza more appetizing. Ms. Flynn also told us that the Miami Herald was going to do a story on us and we should immediately rush records and a presskit to her. We spent 7 dollars on the rush delivery for the package she so desperately needed only to find out that it had gone to a club hand named Joe for his own personal use. When we arrived expecting to have a red carpet rolled out for us, we noticed the place was not nearly as big as described. Ms. Flynn did not arrive at the club until 3/4 of the show was over. She worked the door for 45 minutes and then left before anyone could even talk to her. The turnout was poorer than anticipated, and all night we heard from Joe that there should have been more people and no one supports their scene. We met lots of nice people that started telling us horror stories of how Flynn's cons and rips off out of state bands. CORROSION OF CONFORMITY supposedly really got screwed on their visit. Unbeknownst to us, there was an opening band, POISON PACT from Miami, featuring a skimply-clad girl singer doing aerobics backed by a polished new wave band. At the end of the night, A. O.D. and BEDLAM were paid a total of $170 and POISON PACT received $100. After arguing over the pay, we finally got it jacked up to a whopping $200 to split between the two bands. The deli platter turned out to be an appetizing alpo spread with a side of Ritz crakers, which was placed in the middle of the club for everyone to share. Luckily, by the time the bands got near it, it was all gone. No one seemed to recall promising us hotel rooms either, and after more arguing, we obtained 3 filthy, roach- infested rooms upstairs. We had to sleep with the lights on to keep the bugs from devouring us. At our departure the next morning, the hotel manager and club-hand Joe started screaming about graffiti they accused us of writing on the walls. They had our equipment locked up in the club and refused to open the door unless we paid them or cleaned it up. It turns out that the writing they bitched about was not only not our doing, but it said things like, \"I love the Big Apple\". Believe me, if we were going to write anything, it would be, \"Flynn's Sucks.\" We're not even from New York. We finally left in time for A. O.D. to miss their plane back home, leaving them a 12 hour wait in the airport. Bands beware of this place! ! ! We were not the only ones to get the shaft, from what we understand. Flynn, just remember, you got what you gave. Sincerely, the members and crew of ADRENALIN O.D. and BEDLAM. Dear MRR, This scene report is going to be a little less optimistic and supportive than most. We are MORAL DISGUST from Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Lately we've been quite disgusted since the scene here in Oshkosh peaked and then died after BLACK FLAG and afterward the DK's came, here, we've been playing the other neighboring scenes. Recently, we were asked at the last minute to hop on a bill with STIFF LEGGED SHEEP (from Iowa City) and S.U.M. in Green Bay. Well, we were a bit wary of Green Bay since we had unfortunate incidents there in the past, but reluctantly agreed since they needed more bands. Our only condition was that we make some money (something that you can't expect in Green Bay). The truck that we use for hauling our stuff would take about $30 worth of gas so I asked for $50 so we could get $5 apiece for playing. The response to that was \"We don't make guarantees, but you'll get your gas money.\" This I wasn't too thrilled about, but agreed never the less because we never make more than gas money. Well, we got there, and there was around a hundred plus people there who payed $2.75 (why not $3?) at the door. As usual, S.U.M. didn't play, so it was just STIFF LEGGED SHEEP and us, but the show went on and a good time was had by all. When it came time to get our fair share, Jim \"Immature\" Runge, the person dividing the cash, was going to stiff us! Not to be screwed over once again, we demanded our money. So Jim, being the benevolant shyster that he is handed us $9, which he said was $10. I said \"Fuck you, shell it out and he gave us $3 more - a total of $12. They paid STIFF LEGGED SHEEP $100 which wasn't fair since they had been in Wisconsin since four days earlier when they played Kenosha and were hoping to play Chicago two days later. So the bands got $112 when a hundred plus people payed $2.75 at the door? Where's the rest of the money? The P.A. and the hall didn't cost close to two hundred bucks! When STIFF LEGGED SHEEP heard how we got cheated, they gave us $10 out of their own pockets! So we ended up with $22 and S.L.S. ended up with $90, and some liar and cheat from Green Bay make a couple hundred! BANDS ! Beward if you're coming to Green Bay! Jim Runge's letter in MRR #20 entitled \"Attention Promoters\" is a fucking bad joke - have nothing to do with this man! It's a pity too, because the people in the scene are great, we like playing for them,, but they have some real cretins running the shows. On the lighter side, we played Champaign, IL about a month earlier with the CRUCIFUCKS and it was great! The promoter there, a super person named Dave Holtgrave, lost alot of money on the show just so the bands could get paid. Champaign has a great scene and we give them our full support. That night we went back into Wisconsin to play with the CRUCIFUCKS again in Kenosha and even though we couldn't play due to lack of time, they still gave us gas money. Kenosha also has a strong yet young scene and we hope it continues and gets stronger. As far as MORAL DISGUST news, obviously we are not broken up as was reported by our Green Bay \"friends\" in MRR #17. We've been writing lots of new material and will be entering the studio soon to record our debut LP. To all of you who inquired about the \"I Love College\" cassette (reviewed in MRR #13), it is unfortunately unavailable, but look forward to the album. You'll be hearing more from us then. Salvatore Serio/309 Washington #9/ Oshkosh, Wl 54901/ (414) 233-4805 NOW THE GOOD NEWS? Dear MRR Readers, This letter is about all the strange things surrounding my record distribution, in reply to complaints. First, I've had a lot of problems with the post office and cops, cause they think I'm a big asshole. They've even had me put on observation. I've also had alcohol problems. About 5 or 6 times I've been cheated by the post office, as some people have sent cash in their letters. They've been opened at the P.O. and searched for money. (Note: please don't write \"ANTI-CIMEX\" on on letters/parcels to me, as there's a big factory nearby called that too, and I've had to go over there and reclaim about 30 letters) . Because I've received complaints for buyers, all I can say is that if you haven't received your records within 3 weeks, let me know. The mailing deals in Sweden are for shit. Anyway, I promise to get better in replying faster. Thanks, Matt Bodenmalm/ Bullshit records/ Brana 1:11/ 571 00 Nassjo/ Sweden. Dear MRR, I've been reading MRR for 1* years. I like it. Reason for writing: It's hard for me to comprehend the problems with violence at shows in various scenes across the globe. I'm from Chicago and I used to drum for BLATANT DISSENT from Dekalb (70 miles west). The scene here is great. Violence is very minimal here. A punch here and there. But, of course, there's going to be some drunk oversized fools at shows trying to hurt smaller people. Lots of people in the scene are friendly. I've been around about 3 years and have met many nice people. I don't have a skinhead or a mohawk and no one cares. People of all kinds attend shows here, even metal heads. It's cool. Many great bands in Chicago: ARTICLES OF FAITH, NAKED RAYCUN, OUT OF ORDER, ROTA, SAVAGE BELIEFS, SEISMIC WAVES. Lots of kids starting with bands too. I'm proud of this scene. Summers are great here, winters not so. But people remain friendly. Just thought I'd let you know one person's feeling. Oh yeah, almost forgot. I feel that the letter from \"A Concerned Chicago Hardcore Enthusiast\" was a bit hard on Sean Duffy and BLOODSPORT. I myself only know Sean by sight and have only seen BLOODSPORT once, so no bias. If there's something bothering this person shouldn't they consult Sean about it instead of writing a letter MRR and not having the balls to sign their name. Oh well, try and have a nice year and write if you want, I don't mind! I'll even write back. Dave Fishman/8119 Lincolnshire West/ Dekalb IL 60115 MRR, I'd like to tell everyone about Matt Vinet, manager of the STRETCH MARKS. While on tour, they did a gig in Vancouver. Unfortunately, the asshole promoter booked them in the Smilin' Buddha, an over- 19 bar. I wasn't too pleased (I'm 16) and neither were Bill or Dik, so the band told us to meet them in the back alley later and they'd see if they could get us in. Well, when we returned, we were greeted by Mark Stretch and Matt, neither of which I had ever met. They couldn't get us in cuz the guy at the back door checked ID too, so, in my opinion, we were fucked. But between sets, while bands were going to their vans to get equipment. Matt convinced the guy at the door to let us in — as long as Matt slipped him a case of beer. Matt didn't have to do this; he hardly knew me and my friend. That was the coolest thing any band has ever done, and it just exemplifies the dedication that the STRETCHIES have toward the scene. Matt, you are god ! I know he does a lot for the Winnipeg scene, and we'd just like to thank him for all he does. By the way, the band thrashed, and I swear everyone in the STRETCHIES is as cool as Matt. Kai 6 Kamel/ #111 13325 105th Ave/ Surrey B Cl Canada V3T-1Z2/ (604) 588-2648 P.S. Any band wanting to play Vancouver, get in touch. We're starting a BYO type deal here and need support! ANTI-ANTI-SEMITISM Dear MRR : Recently Gary Yarbrough, the killer of Alan Berg, who was a Jewish talk show host in Denver, was captured in Portland, OR. Yarbrough lived in Boise, ID, and had once been the head of security for the Aryan Nation, a white supremacy group. A friend of his named John Miller lives in Jerome, which is adjacent to my town. He was asked how he would react if he found out about a white man /black woman marriage. He stated that he would first warn the white man and then do everything in his power to stop the marriage, even if it meant killing them. Northwest states such as Idaho have become centers for the Aryan Nation and groups of their kind. They regularly burn crosses, terrorize Jews and blacks, and even blew up a church. There is also an investigation of a plot to blow up a dam in northeastern Washington. All of this may not seem like much to you, but this is my state and it scares the shit • out of me. If these terrorist groups continue to grow everyone will be in danger, not just the Jews and blacks. Don't be fooled because you will soon be on their black lists. This is no joke. Racism must end now!! Kent McClard/ 964 Mt. View Dr. N ./ Twin Falls, ID 83301 Dear MRR : This letter is directly addressed to Bob Beyer. Gee, it's really cool that you've been into punk for 5± years. By punk standards you are an elder, but by worldly standards you have a lot to learn. I remember the HB's and their swastikas. They were a bunch of kids who wore symbols to bring attention and controversy to themselves. The issue of the HB police being nazis is irrelevant, but the point is that the swastika doesn't mean anything different now - it still means the same. A symbol of a murderous fascist government that had some short anti- Jewish fuck as the main man. 6,000,000 innocent men, women, children, Jews and non-Jews alike were murdered under the sign of the swastika. All of you readers of MRR are too young to remember the Holocaust, but maybe your parents or neighbors do. I lost family in the name of the swastika, in the name of the Third Reich, and the name of nazism. All you asshole punkers out there who think they are neo-nazis are full of shit. There is nothing cool about being anti-Jewish, anti- Black, etc. You fuckheads only give punk a worse name. Maybe one day you'll meet a survivor, and you'll see the terrified look in their eyes, even after 45 years. They still have numbers on their arms from the death camps, many have no family because they were all exterminated. I challenge a neo-nazi punk to write in a letter and tell all the readers just what he stands for. Chances are he doesn't know. I don't believe any of this white supremacy crap, that died with the Civil War. And I want to know what evil Jews have done. Don't give me any freedom crap or Reagan shit either. I've heard it all. I'm just waiting to hear the arguments of someone who really is a nazi. And in my opinion, all the real ones are dead or living in South America because nobody elso wants them. Yours truly. One Jewish Punker with strong opinions. Dear MRR, I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area, but at the moment I'm in the midst of spending a week visiting my aunt and uncle in New York City. What started out as an innocent little trip for me has turned out to be a really eye-opening experience. I'm getting a lot of insight into how the world has become so fucked up and seems set on remaining that way, by extrapolating the attitudes held by my somewhat elderly (60-ish) relatives to the world at large. My one big conclusion is this: hate breeds hate. My relatives I'm visiting are Jewish, and this trip is my first exposure to Jewish culture. They talk a lot about the persecution of \"their people\" by Hitler and others, and they're indignant with good reason. But what really disturbs me is that they've learned nothing from their experiences and those of their families in Europe in the '30's. On the contrary, they spit this hatred right out in the form of persecution against others. I've never heard so much sexist and racist talk as I've heard in the past few days from my own kin, spouting off about \"Schwartzers\", \"women drivers\" and \"oriental drivers\". With my liberal, politically radical upbringing, this kind of talk really sickens me. Nothing, not even nuclear war, scares me as much as ignorance and the prejudice that goes with it, often found in people who are otherwise quite honorable. Another thing that bothers me is the isolation among the crowd that my relatives and their neighbors have fallen prey to. Here they are, living in the middle of the biggest city in America, and they have such an incredibly narrow view of what's going on in the world. The way cities have developed, it's possible, and common, for people like my aunt and uncle to go back and forth to their jobs and get the bare essentials of life with practically no social contact with anyone. This also makes me sad. There are a lot of other things that bother me about what I'm seeing this week, including intolerance, unthinking clinging to religious dogma, lack of concern for or knowledge about our limited natural resources, and so on, but I think I've made my point. If you're like me and have grown up in a liberal household, you may find it hard to understand why Reagan, capitalism, hatred, materialism. Burger King, etc. continue to exist. Believe me, there are people out there who are never going to fight these things because their entire existance is built on such crap. All I can say is THINK and then ACT .accordingly. I'd like to read about other peoples' thoughts and experiences relating to what I've written about. Thanks. Yours Toward Peace, Richard/2457 Eye Street /Areata, CA 95521 SKINS, BRAINS, S CUTS? Dear MRR : Hello you all. This is the first time I've written to MRR. I've wanted to quite a few times, but. . .excuses, excuses. Time is very tight. I picked up the Dec. copy along with Wake Up from the U.K., and since I'm on vacation, no excuses. This letter is in response to your request for \"scene perspectives\" from non-skin /non-peace punks. I just started listening to \"punk\" rock, and going to shows in '77— mostly better- known bands-JAM, TALKING HEADS, CLASH, EDDIE AND THE HOT RODS, etc. But it wasn't until I saw SLF, and THE BAD BRAINS, UNDEAD, etc., in the Winter /Spring of '81, that my way of thinking and dressing changed. At first it seemed to mean something, besides being fun. It was easier to be different-- not just for \"conformity\" or the sake of being different. Especially living here on L.I., it's still ass-backwards. Well, enough b.s. Quite a few of my friends have also been around for a while and still occasionally go to shows. I can't speak for them, but they all express concern over the scene and recent letters in MRR. I really can't compare NY/NJ/CT to anywhere else, to give perspective. But this scene is still very large. I see new faces all the time. Shows are rarer than in ■80-'82, but then again about that time dance clubs became popular and got more money having a DJ and dancing, so the live music disappeared--Mudd, Privates, Hurrahs, Pep Max's, etc. Prices for shows doubled. Smaller places, 171-A, A-7, Sabotage, Plugz, etc. also gone. These, of course, were the best places. While I haven't been to every show, I go often. Over the summer up until now there have been a few fights — nothing major that I know of. I see more in traffic every day or in local yokel bars. There's a. few \"ego\" blockheads, but I've never seen them start trouble. There's also the \"punker than you\" attitude. It's not a rampant disease, but it's there, along with the \"fucking kids from the Island coming to \"our\" shows\" attitude. These are very general statements, but that's what I see and hear and it's my impression. I have seen some of the problems mentioned in other letters as far as skins harassing gays and occasionally teasing or goofing on a hippie or two but that's just immaturity--l've seen more violence against gays and freaks in the \"happy suburbs\". I'm not standing up for this, it's wrong, but these skins are kids and think it's cool, I guess. Maybe their bored? I have nothing against skinheads, and I don't see any skins vs. punks at shows. Maybe on the street, but not at shows. To me--there's no difference. Labels are just words, not necessarily accurate descriptions. Many have \"quit the scene,\" but they are still listening to records and alternative radio and playing in bands. They just don't go to every show. Occasionally I'll see a face I haven't seen in 1 or 2 years. The devoted seem to stay that way in mind, even if they don't go to gigs anymore. Well, time to wrap it up. Just trying to get my point across, which is, NY is still great! Patrick Bennett Dear MRR : In regards to readers' comments on skins-- all the people down on violence, destruction, etc., have got their heads up their asses; why, they may as well move to Athens, GA., put flowers in their hair, smoke dope and do acid and join the new R.E.M. hippie movement. Going down to the local fashion store, buying spikes to wear to shows so you can stand on the sidelines and look intimidating. . .Ha, if you don't live your philosophy, then your philosophy is bullshit. You guys read too much if you think that the meek will inherit anything besides slavery and oppression-- if you let your ass get kicked at a show, or wherever, maybe you're too timid to be there in the first place — the name of the game is survival of the fittest. . .maybe that's why so many scenes are dwindling--because pasificists aren't fit, therefore they don't survive. Oh, by the way, I'm the farthest thing from a skin. . . Feedback? M. M ./ 2215 Berryhill Rd./ Charlotte, NC 28208 Dear MRR : I've been listening to \"hardcore\" music for about three years now as well as other types of music. Since the trend now seems to be labeling, i.e., \"peace punks,\" \"Nazi skinheads,\" I was wondering, since I neither have long, spiky hair or a bald head, am I in an identity crisis? Should I run out to the nearest barber and get a shave or is it ok for me to be myself? Since this labeling business has run rampant it's brought a question to mind that I bet a lot of people don't know the answer to. I know that back in '77 or so, dear old Malcom McLaren coined the label \"punk rock,\" but where in hell did the label \"hardcore\" come from anyway, and who though of it? I would really appreciate a reply from anyone who might know. There's too many assumptions and blind obedience (following) going on, which is ironic because it seems that that is what a lot of punk/hardcore music is trying to prevent. Send knowledge to Thea Kearney/ 693 President St./ Brooklyn, NY 11215 Dear MRR : I would like to send a late congratulations to Kim Fox and her letter on the Denver scene in #18. She pretty much covered the attitude and present day show situation but I think she forgot to mention who was at the bottom of this whole fucking needless problem: the nazis and the skinheads. Fuck, if anybody was afraid to be part in the scene before they sure have solid reasons to now! And I don't blame 'em. Who wants to risk their life at a show just because they are afraid to slam in a certain area? That's complete bullshit. The problem of the nazi punks and the skinheads is an overwhelming one and I think that it is anybody else's duty, that would like to keep the amount of excellent bands that show up in Denver, to do something about it. I am just one in hundreds, I'm no fucking army, which by the way seems to be the size that you need to knock some sense into these fuckups. Cos' when they ruin the scene they aren't just hurting themselves but everyone else that was enjoying it and by that time it's gonna be too late to fucking say they're sorry. So support the Denver hardcore/punk scene and band against these kind of actions to break us up. Jessica Dutton/ 2343 Senator Ct/ Louisville CO 80027 Dear MRR, I have finally decided to write and get my 2C in on the issue of violence at gigs. First off, let me describe myself. I am 16 and have been involved in alternative music for a year. Although I have fairly long hair, I don't associate myself with any fashion or group of people. I wear what I wear because that's what I find in my drawer. Money seldom reaches my hands, so I rarely have gone to shows--eight, to be exact. At the shows I go to, I find stupid violence becoming more and more the \"in\" thing to be a part of. That's bullshit! If I wanted to see boxing. I'd go home and watch it on TV. Shouldn't I be able to see bands and talk with people without being violated by some drunken asshole? Thrashing seems to provoke fights sometimes, especially when people have fun by taking other thrashers out and trying to knock over as many people as possible. At the final FANG show last month here in Berkeley, there were a few individuals who didn't give a damn about anybody else, including me. Haying a broken leg at the time, I fortunately met a few caring and sensible people who went out of their way to protect me. I wasn't surprised that several fights broke out that night. Does a situation like the one at the TRIAL/DICKS outdoor gig bring the problem of mindless violence to the attention of all in the scene? I hope so. Unfortunately, some people may be apt not to go to shows now because of this kind of crap. This brings up the question of solving the violence. An interesting solution is the one Tim Y brought up (on the radio show) of everybody linking arms (join in when you see a bunch of people doing this) and encircling the aggressor, leaving no room to fight. Another is akido. which is a self-defense method that uses the aggressor's own energy against himself. Communication is always necessary in a situation like this, and it appears to* be time to start talking --not just with your friends, but with people you don't know . Now, I have never been to NY City, but there seems to be a division in the scene (I think the number of letters in MRR reflect this). The 2 main factions are a group of people who prefer not to have hair on their heads (for the sake of simplicity. I'll call them \"skins\"), and a group of people who supposedly like to spike and color their hair (I'll call them \"peace punks\"). There seems to be a lot of name-tossing and childish fighting between the 2 groups, and the rest of the scene is losing out. A lot of the problem is blamed on the \"other guy\", but the simple fact is those who are quick to point fingers are guilty of the same atrocity. Some have even gone as far as blaming MRR for the troubles. Now, that's ignorance if I ever saw it. Just because Newsweek printed more letters from Mondale supporters doesn't mean it recommends him (I doubt they did!). Come on guys, if people have written in saying there is a problem, then there must have been a problem. Then there are the anonymous letters. One was from a so-called \"peace punk\" (MRR #19) who told out-of-town bands to boycott NYC shows. I hope no band listens to that, because it doesn't mean anything. If you want to play in NYC, get in touch with people who have been/are there and then make the decision yourself. In issue #20, some supposed \"skin\" wrote in saying that everyone has fun at every show, and NY is the best city in the world, and skins are the proudest, and they have the best bands, and so and so rules and blah, blah, blah. What a bunch of malarkey. Put on your Amerikan flag shirt and go to a fuckin' football game--whst's the dif? It is unfortunate that some people have been turned off by the divisio.n in the scene, but that is inevitable when there is violence. I, myself, have thought of quitting my own lifestyle because of apathy, but the cause is too great. Play in a band, make a zine, invent some stickers, but don't just sit on your butt. Please write, Toby Bodine/ 1521 Lincoln St/ Berkeley, CA 94703 JUST BRAINS Dear MRR : I am writing to you about the almost constant stream of letters in your magazine each month from readers who cry and complain about the scene, skinheads fighting, etc. I am at present serving in the Marine Corps. Not only is it the biggest mistake I ever made but I'm stationed overseas and I haven't been to a show in over a year. I have absolutely nowhere to ride my skateboard. The only contact I have is an occasional zine or MRR my friends might send me and I'm lucky to have that. There is one other skate punk here with me and we both feel the same way: If you don't like something in your scene fucking change it or do something about it! Don't fucking cry to everyone. Believe me, it could be worse, you could have nothing at all, and it may very well be like that if you let your scene be overrun by god damned nazi skins or be broken by drughead British wannabes. One of the things punk stands for is thinking for yourself, so think of a way to get rid of these assholes in your scene or be prepared for them to cause the self destruction of punk. If you're afraid to fight for what is yours then you should just turn it over to the nazis. I can't even begin to tell you all about the fascism I've experienced in the Marines but I know this: that kind of person is a danger, and these people should not be allowed to spread, skinheads included. The means to fight them doesn't have to be a violent way, but that's probably what those dick for brains will retaliate with. Most of these people will only understand an outstanding ass kicking anyway. But above all, stand up for your rights, and don't let them ruin your scene, or you might wake up one day and not have one, and believe me it isn't any fun. I have one suggestion though, give all of these nazi's names to a Marine recruiter, they would fit right in. SKATE TOUCH. SKATE FREE. Also we'd invite anyone to write us. We need to correspond with anyone who has a brain (no one here does) . Larry Nielsen/ Steve Lauch/ Ammo Co 3D Sup Bn 3DFSSG/ FPO San Francisco CA 96602 Dear MRR : Concerning political legitimacy of the punks - you all know your rhetoric, but let's face it - you're no threat. Though the scene does get bigger there's no way punk will ever unite people in an important way. Why? Cos' negativism and resentment are what motive Those Who Run The Show, and you don't subvert that by mimicking it. You want proof? Take Martin Luther King, Jr. He was assassinated because of his power, power based not on hate but love. Sounds like hippie revisionism, huh? The bottom line is, hate divides and love unites. Punk doesn't radiate love, no matter what anyone says. Anger is good - there's plenty of that - but it's gotta be directed in the right ways. Until then the punks mean nothing as a political force. They've not shot Jello yet (Thank Cod), nor have the members of CRASS been interned in a concentration camp. Punk is self-defeating, and the authorities know it. However, there are intelligent people in the movement so there is a chance this could all change. There are lessons to be learned from the Sixties, because except for difference in hair length feelings are basically the same. It is good that many punks are against brainwashing - they seem to be the only bunch of people of my age that are as a whole. For a \"commercial\" band, U2 seems to have integrity. To the punks, that should be a contradiction, but anyone who puts out an album basically dedicated to MLK gets my vote, he being the last great champion for justice in this country. Jello B. is my idea of punk integrity (actually, the whole band) and those that trash him and the DK's, well, that'll be the last noise they ever make. There's nothing wrong with' humor (thanks again Jell-O) or beauty, for that matter. SSS - Stop Skin Stupidity. Maybe we'll survive Reagan. Dan McNaughton/ Reed College Box 494/ Portland OR 97202 Dear MRR, Whatever happened to idealism? Can anyone actually hold an ideal as true, and strive to achieve its ends in today's fucked situation? From what I've seen and heard from all but a few, most people's ideals are just a cop-out to hide their ignorance of a given subject, or else its just an intellectual pose for the benefit of impressing or alienating their acquaintances An example of this are the people calling themselves \"anarchists\". Alot of these people don't even know what the term \"anarchy\" means. For those of you who don't, here we go \"Anarchy is the absence of government control and influence\". Sounds good doesn't it? I mean, not having anyone to tell you to go to school, or work or whatever. Having no one to tell you to do anything. whatsoever. Well just how the fuck do you expect to live? Whose going to teach you how to read and write? What about their children? What are you going to do for food, clothing, shelter? You also have to realize that without some kind of state (whatever system you care to choose) that there will be no laws of any kind. I guess that means everything will be legal! Isn't that great! Murder, rape, kidnapping, robbery, torture and cannibalism would be legal! Let's fact it; anarchy would be a heyday for every fucked psychopath there is. There are also some people around calling themselves \"nihilists\". Wow. These nihilists would have to reply \"so what\" to all of the above (and below). Very, very tough these \"nihilists\". So tough that if they were walking down the street with a friend (are \"nihilists\" allowed to have friends, I wonder?) and another \"nihilist\" walked up to them and b«ew their \"friend\" away with a rocket launcher, I suppose they'd say \"so what, chaos rules\" and be unaffected by it all. I doubt it highly. Getting back to the original query, these above groups hold no ideals at all. Chaos isn't an ideal, it is chaos ! It is evident that the existing political system is corrupt, unjust and illogical (unless you think that putting the right to \"rule\" in the hands of a priviledged few - namely the rich, is logical) . What is needed by \" the people \" is a drastic social change. Some who think that working within the system is the only way to make a change for the better, are invariably corrupted by the very system they set out to change. Starting from the ground up, reforms should be made to restore \"a government for the people, by the people and of the people\", (which was a very popular ideal about two hundred or so years ago) . What I mean is that this \"democracy\" was founded upon revolution. But a revolution in the conventional sense is impossible today (how many people do you know who own an automatic weapon let alone a squandron of hypersonic fighter jets?) What is needed is a \"quiet\" revolution. A collective of people who would run for election in various districts and who communicate with each other for ideas and news from their respective districts. They could meet in a kind of congress to vote upon motions pertinent to the people of the \"riding\" they were chosen to represent. Today's system is described as being such though, isn't it? But in reality, if one of the representatives disagrees with their party's fundamental platform on an issue, they run the risk of losing their portfolio (or special title, such as \"Minister of Finance\" or \"Minister of Education\") and possibly the support of their party. We have these parties to give the voter a \"choice\". Is there a choice in sameness? How about a one party system where anyone who chooses to run for an office is free to do so. Wouldn't it be more logical to vote someone into office for their position on an issue, instead of following some party's policies, good or bad? For those of you interested in such an \"idealistic, bleeding heart\" kind of system, how about making an honest attempt at running for an office or position the next time an election comes around. Try to improve your community or region and keep thinking of the ways to do so. You don't have to work within the system, form a new and improved one! Send replies, responses or hate mail to J. Mercieca/145i King St #5/London, Ontario/ Canada P.S. Frymire please write no one knows where you are! P* P.S. All fascist/racist/sexist scum, please kill yourselves or each other and leave innocent people alone. WE LIVE TOGETHER OR WE DIE TOGETHER The point in history has come upon us, we can destroy our entire world and with it ourselves. Never before have we had the technology to do so, never before has the threat of war been soominous>. A war between the super powers today spells complete and total annihilation to every living thing on this planet; that's you and me! War is, today, OBSOLETE. War is obsolete as a means for nations to settle disputes, if we choose to continue employing warfare as our resolving factor, we face death by our own doing. The realization that war is obsolete must be made by all of us. We must begin to employ this vision into our everyday lives, today. The only way we can bring on this new way of thinking is to start with ourselves. We have got to see violence is not a reasonable way to communicate. Unless we, the individual, can do this how can we expect our nation to do it? It begins at home. The individual ultimately shapes the whole, realize your strength, put it to work! How, do we shake off all the programming we've been put through? I mean in this society we are to fight for what we want and to employ any means to get our way, we're constantly taught that that's the way things are done. We need to re-evaluate our way of thinking and our attitude toward one another. This re-evaluation can begin today, now! I've found one way to see the world in a different way, try this: next time you walk down a city street try to imagine every person you see is a member of your family. Accept any faults you see in them as you would the faults you see in, let's say, your mother. In our families we have to accept our differences and faults in order to live harmoniously under one roof, if we don't do this we tend to go crazy, or worse! We must begin to see the earth as a home and we are the family that shares it. Unlikely at best, huh? It's unlikely sounding but, tell me, have we really got any choice?! The simple fact is we have no choice! There is no way we are going to survive unless we begin to respect one another's rights. I say it can be very well start with me; I today have expanded my \"family\" to include every one of us, the people of this fine planet. I truly hope each of you reading this would do the same. Spread the word too, tell everyone you see. Tell'em we're family now so we may as well just get along. The single reason I'm saying all this to you is because I WANNA' LIVE!!! To close this open letter to humankind I'll just say, remember: if you start a fight tomorrow at the show your giving some asshole the permission to blow you up. Don't be so selfish though, most of us want to live! I DO! Well, that's all, the choice is ours. THANKS FOR THINKING! Jason Traeger/ 1243 Hygeia St/ Leucadia CA 92024 Yo MRR , Joe Asaro, GRAND POO-BAHS here. Now that I've gained the respect of the reading audience, let me once and for all put an end to all the brouhaha and confusion surrounding the rightful function of \"punks\" in America. First of all, the average punk looks like this : Not like this : Because if he looked like this he could not have a job, be an effective fighter for social justice, and moreover, would reduce himself to a freak-circus reject or the paradoxical fashionable \"anti-fashion\" punk. I think once bands accoutre themselves in \"punk\" regalia or the \"Hardcore Outfit\"® they are on the same level as heavy metal exhibitionist assholes. I'll take VERBAL ABUSE, SATAN'S CHEERLEADERS, and GILLIGAN'S REVENGE over CBH , the EXPOLITED, and PSYCHOS anyday. How can any punk identify with some burly, leather boy with a mohawk; he'll never have to apply for a job in some fast-food conglomerate. I believe that \"punk rock\" is actually the successor of true rock 6 roll. We are the descendents of the spirit of rockabilly and early '60's \"punk\" bands. But when you spend hours teasing your mohawk you reduce yourself to the level of glitter rockers and other forms of commercial, pompous music. Secondly; I attended a KRAUT show a while back at NY's Rock Hotel. KRAUT (who are usually cool) used some blinding, intense lights that panned the audience. Besides having hallucinogenic flashbacks of FOGHAT on the Midnight Special, I felt like I was involved in some sick, experimental C.I.A. project, or worse yet, a heavy metal concert. Even more disturbing were the 2 or 3 skins who were hired (I imagine by KRAUT) to prevent any of us lowlife spectators from stage-diving or disturbing the \"sacred\" set. George Orwell said: \"Power corrupts\". I couldn't help think that as I watched those burly, macho, fascist skins in their lame \"staff\" shirts, hurling kids off-stage. How these militant fascist skins are driving deep factions in the NYHC scene is another 2-page letter. (All due respect to cool, open-minded skins). Getting back to the KRAUT show, I have nothing against using stage effects, but caution and question the use of commercial trappings of conventional concerts. Hi Johnny. Thirdly; what's all this nonsense about punks being apolitical and apathetic (hardcore buzzword of the year)? When asked about what the average punk thought about politics, Joey Ramone said something to the effect of \"Punks don't care about politics; they care about having a fun time.\" Now, regardless of what you think of Joey Ramone, his point has some validity. Punk initially was the idea that plain (ie punks) kids could get together and make music for kids by kids, etc... It was the idea that punks— kids who weren't impressed by heavy metal power-trip egotists or brainwashed AOR, MOR static — could form their own underground music scene without the manipulative powers of record execs, club owners, and most of all, lame-brained, post-hippie musicians who comprised most of American music throughout the ' 70's . That in itself is an intense political statement. Not that punk should be apolitical — I personally feel that hardcore as a forum for social change has been a positive development, but not necessarily a natural one. I think that punk has grasped progressive politics because, on the whole, punks have less sexist, racist, religious, and egotist hang-ups — but don't jump on someone's case if he's into playing the congas, or just skating. I think most people in the scene can appreciate bands who criticize aspects of institutions, western civilization, or the world in general in an intelligent way. Bands who can effectively make social /political statements /arguements do so in an objective, informed, and non- make-em-chant-\"Nazis suck\"-in-the chorus- and-maybe-they'll-forget-the- 1 5-years-that- parents-schools-taught-them-the-joys-of-raci.*! way. Get it? Most of the bands who are labeled \"preachers\" encounter this stigma because they criticize (or in more extreme case, attempt to indoctrinate the audience) in a simplistic, condescending manner (sometimes uninformed ) without any humor involved. You don't have to have a degree in sociology to realize this type of sectarian opining is bound to result in resentment by youth who are already preached to in schools, churchs, and homes. Consequently, I think traditional methods of punk criticism, parody, and satire are more effective and much more bearable. Thanks, Joe Asaro/ 84-44 60th Ave/ Elmhurst NY 11373 Dear MRR, I am pretty sick and tired of seeing \"Anarchy\" sprawled over park walls, etc. and seeing general apathy at shows. I guess most punks around here value showing of? how \"punk\" they are than really being a threat by participating in any rallies or other functions where one can voice out his/her beliefs or creativity. My interpretation of being \"punk\" is putting your intellects together to muster all of our creative and intellectual skills and talents together and create something new--to be idealists in a materialistic world. We can topple this \"system\", a lot of \"punks\" call \"fascistic and oppressive\". If we just band together (not as in sheep or gangs) as individuals functioning independently in a group towards a common goal. But before one goes to change the world (it can be done) one should look at one's self — find out who you are, what you really want, and where you are and where you want to go. Maybe if you know yourself (even a little bit) and your prejudiced, you can then open your minds to new ideas and learning experiences. One has to have a revolution in the soul first, before he starts tearing down the social yoke placed on his shoulder. \"Punk\" is a learning experience. It, to me, is a school where one learns from other people and upon \"graduating\" from this school- one becomes more aware of his government, friends and self . Maybe, if we start to really listen to each other (instead of just hearing) and see each other (instead of only looking) we can learn from each other. Most of the time, learning destroys ignorance, which breeds hate. If we could only start learning from educating each other maybe we won't have apartheid, labels, wars, etc. Remember, the world starts with you and you are the spark that preludes an explosion. Enough preaching. Peace and Understanding. Jed / 7540 St. Clair Ave/ NH CA 91605 P.S. I am putting together a \"thought\"-zine.

Ok, so maybe people don't take into account the fact that bands work 24 hrs a day. I say they still have a right to be pissed when SIOUXSIE & THE BANSHEES charge $12 a show— even if they're wrong. But please don't talk like a school-teacher or make dumb jokes, cause it's not going to alleviate the frustration which comes from the fact that most people just plain don't have 12 bucks to spend like that. But anyway, what really gets me is Mykel's assertion that \"rock musicians are not exploiters, no matter how much money they make\". What the fuck does he mean? Who in specific is he talking about, anyway? What about woman- haters like Motley Grime and their cohorts who are making millions off of the exploitation of people's frustration with their relationships and their misunderstanding of women? What about bands that call themselves \"joke\" bands and yet perpetrate more and more stances of hatred, violence and stupidity? Sure, \"Kill the Poor\" was a revealing slap in the face, but how much longer can bands go on crancking out the same old backwards drivel in the name of satire? I think that's exploiting people's desire for something shocking of illuminationg value— by telling them how brilliant ind revolutionary their sexist, racist lyrics are they mislead (or try to) some people into thinking they're getting some real social commentary. The same goes for bands like THE CLASH — whom Mykel excuses as being \"just hypocritical\". Well, you could say that Ronnie Reagan is \"just hypocritical,\" too. How lame. Mykel justifies the whole sell-out mentality by saying \"What's wrong with making money?\" with an American-dream placidity that doesn't take into account what is being exploited. THE CLASH are exploiting people's (especially younger people's) need for social change and the feeling of participation in this change. If buying loads of CLASH paraphernalia at mass-market prices is your idea of revolution, forget it. Yeah, I know, no one made them buy it, but if we can see the effects that corporate advertising and TV have on our brainwashed minds, can't we at least demand a little conscious responsibility from supposedly radical bands? I just can't see thriving on the very system you're claiming to work against. We all know who pockets the rewards of this farce. \"Rock musicians don't make money on the misfortunes of others.\" Mykel, that's just not true. Exploitation extends beyond the physical, dollars-and-cents reality; people's aspirations for a better world get exploited, which is worse in essence because it's a mind- fuck. That's the greatest misfortune of all. Oh, and one last thing--| know working can suck. And I don't envy you your job, Mykel. But don't lump all work into one category. The main reason there is so much apathy and hatred towards work is that most of it is so lousy you'd rather die, but there are other kinds of work, yes even physical work, like carpentry or farming, which can be really rewarding and can reinforce our place in this world as builders of positive, creative visions. Let's focus on making this a real alternative, and not spend time pontificating and excusing the middle-of-the -road \"hypocrites\" who are just making a few million innocent bucks. So, don't give up hope and fer chrissake, don't be a dope! Thank MRR! Write — Katie/ 2373 Empire Grade/ Santa Cruz, CA 95060 Dear MRR : TESCO TIME While I fully enjoyed your article on the Industrial scene in #19 (yes, Tesco, that label does indeed suck shit) , I feel compelled to share some of my sparse thoughts with you. First of all, Tesco Vee referred to THROBBING GRISTLE as the \"harbinger of things to come.\" Upon this point I beg to differ. First, though, let me say that I'm not trying to take anything away from T.G. and that I am lost in admiration for them. During the 70's, T.G. was one of the few groups which comprised the underground, along with IGGY, BEEFHEART, the Ralph Records groups and GENTLE GIANT, before the SEX PISTOLS blew the scene open. The \"industrial\" musicians, whether they care to admit it or not, were and are merely an extension and continuation of a much older set of musicians that Tesco neglected to mention: JOHN CAGE, TODD DOCKSTADER, KARLHEINZ STOCKHAUSEN, EDCARD VARESE, GEORGE ANTHILE, DAVID TUDOR, MARCEL DUCHAMP (yeah, he's the dadaist painter as well), HENRY COWELL, ALBAN BERG, GEORCE CRUMB, THADDEUS CAHILL, CHRISTIAN WOLFF, MILTON BABBIT, BULANT AREL, etc. etc. 1 will spit upon anyone who dismisses these people as \"arty\" or obsolete. Their music is as valid, vibrant and alive now as it was when first performed because it lacks the trendiness that has proved to be fatal to a good deal of music that has since been spawned. This music was labelled \"avant-garde\" and they knew a thing or two about busting down barriers. That's my point — they were the harbingers of things to come. I believe we should give credit where credit is due. While we're at it, let's name a few more '70's \"Industrial\" harbingers: BRIAN ENO, early DEVO, ELP. Pretty pretentious stuff you say? Well, let me quote somebody: \"...your preceptions/ tastes/ and open-mindedness will dictate any predeliction towards this type of music... But to this writer, this realm of (non)music is as relevant as any...\" Another good one is KRAFTWERK's first double LP on Vertigo. What set me off on this rave was that Tesco Vee states right off the bat that \"Noise is certainly nothing new...\", but then skips over the avant-gardists whom were using noise, atonality, and disharmony before the Nuclear Age, before your parents, in many cases, and even your grandparents in some cases, were even born. Instead he went straight to the \"industrialists\", as though they've invented something new. Nah! C'mon! Be serious! Well, what about the social commentary, you say? Well, Duchamp, as I've stated, was a dadaist painter (he may have also invented Dada), as well as an avant-gard musician, and dada had a thing or two to say about society and its mores. Why do you think Gary Kail (of ANTI) called his avant-noise band ZURICH 1916? Go look up the artists who were painting in Zurich in 1916 and see what they had to say about society (Jean Arp, Max Ernst, Paul Klee, Alfred Jarry, Rene Magritte, and Man Ray you might want to take a look at as well). At least Kail knew who to bow to. My point? There is no set beginning to \"Industrial\" music. Whoever you claim was the first, someone else will find an artist who was doing it before that. \"Industrial Music\" is as old as industry itself (check out Ravel), if you want to get technical about it (no pun intended). Hence, any \"industrialist\" who disclaims influence from the Avant-gard is not only an asshole, but a fucking liar as well: your music exists because there was Avant-gard. So, if you still feel no obligation to them, then you can stick it up your ass sideways as far as I care about your music. Still, though, hats off to Tesco Vee because this is one of the first zine articles to deal with underground music that is not hardcore, and I'm glad he had it in him to write about it (I knew I liked the MEATMEN for some reason) and alert us to Chris Phinney's zine, which I never knew existed. Well done!! His article also hit it dead center: we pay people with nice physical endowments large sums of money, as though we want them to trick us into believing that ugliness does not exist, by showing us how nice their tits are or whatever. The systematic dehumanization that governments all over the world have been forcing on mankind since time immemorial is now effectively out of control. This must be to make us obsequious, abject slaves. I can’t see any other reason for it. So be careful and don't give up. I am not now nor will I ever be your humble and willing servant. I to / 23 Marvin St/ Saratoga NY 12866 P.S. Two of my friends and myself collectively possess an enormous library of weirdo music, ranging from the original avant-gard, to avant- jazz, to psychedelic, industrial, punk, post- punk and new wave. So, if you're interested in trading records and tapes, write me at the above address. If you do not receive an immediate reply, it means I moved and never got your letter, and I can be reached at: 23706 Thornton/ Mt Clemons Ml 48043, which is my parents address. They will see to it that I get your letter, although it will take longer. THE SITUATION Dear MRR, I'd just like to congradulate Bill Brown on his article in MRR #19. The whole thing was really \"informative\", but I'd like to concentrate on the last paragraph. I disagree with his statement \"Punk rock is dead\". It definitely isn't shocking to society anymore; the \"punk look\" can be found in any store and is being made more popular as the time goes on. It is the thing among trendy people. People often confuse Madonna as a \"punk\", and her look is being copied by more and more teenage girls. However, the idea behind \"Punk rock\" is still alive. The attitude remains the same. The social concern (or rather, our trying to change society before it changes us) is there. That's what counts. This is what we need to work on, not trying to shock, but change the system. I do agree with his concern for \"the hardcore scene\". This is a relevant and necessary concern today. However, his statement suggesting that the fact' that many into hardcore are anarchists, and that this is leading to its decline is false. It's true that a lot of people who wear anarchy signs plastered all over their clothes really don't know its real meaning: they think it's just \"cool\" to wear them. How can there be support for something when the supporters themselves and the rest of humanity have no clue as to what its theory is? There still is a lot of people who really are involved and do have enough information in their brain to be able to support their opinions. These are the people who are helping \"the scene\", rather than wrecking it. If we had enough strong-willed, determined, intelligent people cooperate and do something, hardcore would grow strortger (Does that make any fucking sense at all?). Talk is cheap. Talk won't create change; action will. If any suggestions, please write. I'm done. Madeline Virbasius/ 33 Linda Ave/ Millbury MA 01527 STARVE A FEEDER Dear MRR : Before writing \"An Introduction to the Situationist International,\" I sent a postcard to the FEEDERZ informing them that \"any contributions on your part would be greatly appreciated.\" Frank Discussion, in his letter to me (MRR#21), clains it arrived \"two days\" before the deadline, meaning Oct. 13. Yet his own photocopy of the postcard, which he insisted on sending me, shows plainly that it was postmarked on Sept. 18! The only other reason Frank said the FEEDERZ had for ignoring my request was that I might've been (gasp! ) A STUDENT , and thus presumably not ever capable of becoming \"politically correct\". Now that this STUDENT has challenged their monopoly on the hardcore movement's access to the techniques and writings of the Situationists, the FEEDERZ are suddenly ready to talk, or rather, to bellow insults at me. Go back and look at the liner-notes on Have You Ever Felt Like Killing Your BosiT : Sure, they tell you about all the great Situationist books, but they withhold the addresses of the books' publishers. You had to go through them to get it and if you were (gasp!) A STUDENT, maybe you wouldn't get it at all. But don't worry, those days are gone forever, the \"Intro to the S.l.\" saw to that. It's your turn now. Bill Brown/ P.O. Box 7252/ Ann Arbor, Ml 48107. P.S.: It is still inconceivable to me that the Situationists would, under any circumstances, ever endorse a song as reactionary as the FEEDERZ' \"Love,\" whose narrator says he wants to respond to a woman's amorous advances by \"kicking her where she pees\" and \"sticking a broken Coke bottle up her cunt.\" Greetings, We are an Alternative Arts, contributor- sponsored, mail magazine club called Velocity .

So we aren't Sure what we're going to do (as usual). I like the name a lot, but I don't think it has too much to do with our music. Oh well, what do you think? Vik Kaos/ 1261 E Tunis/ Pensacola FL 32503. Dear MRR : Yow! Please help us save a dying /yet unborn scene! Amarillo, TX (population: too many goddam cowboys! ) has a tiny scene of less than ten people, and we've never had any gigs here (although I did hear that the VANDALS got stuck in the snow here about two years ago) . Amarillo is located in the Panhandle, that is, the little rectangular part at the very top of the state. Interstate 40 runs right through the city, as does Interstate 27. We can provide a place to play and a place to stay, so please don't forget the smaller scenes like ours. Any and all bands interested in setting up dates here (c'mon guys, don't let us down), contact me, Landshark Marc, 6200 McCoy Dr./ Amarillo, TX 79109, or call (806) 359-9361, and leave your name and number if I'm not home. Thanks a lot! Dear MRR, This is the Hudson Valley scene report. What scene?, you who are familiar with the area ask. Exactly! There is no scene here in this town (New Paltz), but I'm trying to build one. I just put out the first issue of a fanzine (Acid Tears) and I'm getting in some bands. I wis in N.Y.C. but decided my energy was needed up here in my hometown. None of the new bands have any place to play around here. The underground art /political scene is dominated by hippies who don't want to see any changes. The lack of community among the revolutionaries, punks, and hippies makes all the musicians slaves to the bar owners. I'm trying hard to wake people up to what's happening now instead of living in the '60's, like all these earth nazis do around here. I want to build an underground punk scene that will give all the frustrated creativity pulsing under the boring college-town exterior of this place a voice. Sounds pretty romantic, huh? Well, I'm gonna give it a fuckin' shot anyway. Please, anyone who wants to give advice, get a copy of Acid Tears (50C), or just talk, get in touch. I'm suffering from mental stagnation and terminal doubt. Stephen Bort/ 51 A Village Arms/ New Paltz NY 12561 Dear MRR : S.O. Fuckin S... Attention all bands!!! Buffalo, N.Y. is home to a rapidly growing hardcore scene. Being a Buffalo punk, I feel our location is one of the best in the country. Our city, being one of the many industrial cities in the world being closed by the greedy capitalist blockheads, has many families on governmant issued social services. Basically the city (as in most northeastern cities) is full of oppressed people, while the suburban preppie fuck ups live carefree. Also in the neighborhood, we have Love Canal, \"Home of our friends at Hooker Chemical and Union Carbide\"; that speaks for itself. As we take a tour south of the \"Queen City\", we are greeted by the friendly employees of the West Valley Nuclear Power Project. For all you military buffs, the Niagra Falls Air Force Base; 107 Fighter and 914 Troop Carrier are stationed there. And the USS Sullivan and Little Rock that store a very small fraction of U.S. semen. The last two bands to play our scene were DECRY and CRUCIFUCKS (I was in jail and missed these two shows but heard they were a big success) . Anyway, the owner said it would be cool to have more H.C. bands play that club. The club is basically an all ages club, although we do have a bar club. Please, we are in desperate need of establishing a firmer base for our scene. This is an emergency. S.O. Fuckin S. out to aM bands (political, metal, social, or any outcast of society). We have places to play and to stay. So send letters of times and dates available to play and how many people you need us to put up. Write or phone us if you want to play or just come up and and check out the many fine tourist attractions that Buffalo and the surrounding area have to offer. If anyone out there wants to respond, please feel free, just to prove that there are other thinking people out there. Now signing off... Chief/ 472 Grant St./ Buffalo, N.Y. 14213. Phone (716) 885-1549. Dear MRR : Hey, let's look left and right here. Let's at least let other people say what they think. Being a high energy \"punk\" band from Cold water Ml (pop. app. 10,000) we know what it's like when people don't give a shit who you are or what you do. The vast majority of these people are into \"Top 40\" and heavy metal. However, there are about 10 of us into the scene who have half their shit together (for whatever good it does) . Anyway the name of our band is TWISTED VALUE. It consists of 3 people: Todd Bag, Death Lee III and Rubie Casanova. We have been together for about 1i years and have recently produced a 45 EP \"Take It For Granted\". Our problem is we rarely get to play out, mainly because of our location. We have been looking to play in bigger cities around our area, however, alot of places won't even acknowledge the fact that we exist (we have no manager). We tell them who we are, what we play, drive miles and miles only to be punched aside like head cheese. Our records don't sell well around the area. What's the problem??? What are these people afraid of? Alot of good performers have come from the northeastern U.S. like ICCY POP, HALF JAPANESE, MC-5, CO EAT, THE SCHMANC LORDS, etc... All I'm really trying to get at is that TWISTED VALUE does exist and we are available to play in areas like Detroit, Ann Arbor, Lansing, Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids, Columbus, Cleveland, Columbus, Toledo, Akron, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, Louisville, Chicago, Milwaukee or anywhere in between there. TWISTED VALUE/ 564 E. State Rd / Coldwater Ml 49036 Dear punx. It seems that there is a built-in prejudice towards people involved in underground movements. People don't take time to listen to these \"different\" people and of course, any media attention given to the movement is fully distorted. Sounds a lot like the punk scene doesn't it? Well, I'm actually talking about the beatnik era of the 50's and 60's, and before you stereotype them, consider beatniks as your forefathers. The beatnik era was primarily literary, with a small core of men like Jack Kerouac (the daddy of the psychedelic era), Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs (active in today's music scene in England), and others. There was a strong association between the beats and jazz musicians, yet it was Bob Dylan who became a disciple and collaborated with Ginsberg to form blues /poetry . The beat's jazz association also led to a false stereotype of goatees, berets, and heroin, etc. and these men, involved with the literary community, found it very hard to get their works published (sound familiar bands??) and it wasn't until the tail end of the \"scene\" that a national magazine paid attention to what these men had to say. Of course \"beats\" dressed in berets and goatees appeared in TV shows and movies (much like Johnny Slash et al). So as you see, we share common problems with today's punk scene as people did with another underground scene of 30 years ago. As of now, there is a growing literary awareness of what the beats were all about, so there is hope for the punk scene to surface again much like the psycadelic era is doing today. Scott Huey Nebbish/ Minneapolis MN Dear MRR, To all people who bought an ARTICLES OF FAITH album (Give Thahks) and discovered that there was no lyric sheet inside, there is still hope. Evidently a large number of records were shipped out by the plant without those useful little 12x12 sheets of rhyming words, so if you find that you are one of those lacking lyrics, write to the record distributor and you will soon receive one. The address is Dutch East India Trading/ 45 Alabama Ave/ Island Park NY 11558. Now, for those of you who have lyric sheets but no. records ... Virus X/ A.O.F. Dear MRR, This letter is in response to Andy T, Suburban Voice fanzine's letter featured in the Boston Scene Report in your January issue. Thanks, but no thanks Andy. When I need to listen to your warnings about what kind of music I should or should not listen to. I'll simply listen to top forty radio. It truly surprises me that Andy feels that he has to take it upon himself to warn me about what records I should buy. What an insult to anyone who reads this magazine! Such a hypocritical letter does not belong in a magazine which advocates free thinking. If Mr. T felt so intimidated by the rantings of someone as good natured and harmless as Springa I truly feel sorry for him. (And why is it that when anyone from a band speaks Mr. T believes they are speaking for the entire band?) I cannot believe that he would put down certain bands for making a progression. If he doesn't like their music, fine — that's his perogative, but it certainly doesn't entitle him to force his opinions down everyone else'e throat. It is shocking to me that he can put D.Y.S. down because they have a ballad on their album! Give me a break from such narrow minded thinking. I don't believe the bands mentioned in your article have ever pushed themselves on anyone. Maybe, Andy, your taste is dated. Music changes year after year, and those like you, unwilling to accept the fact, are backwards. You are as much in a time warp as those people who think the only good music is from the 50s or 60s. If you chose to live in the past, fine but please don't tell me to. I feel sorry for you because you weren't a part of the true hardcore scene - if you were, you would not be satisfied by the imitation hardcore bands that try so hard to bring back the spirit of 1980 hardcore. Lastly, I cannot believe that Mr. T devotes a whole letter condoning the very thing he says he despises. Some advice to you Andy: Rock and roll will never be just ONE form of music. Rock and roll has never been about forcing your ideas on someone else. Spend more time listening and you will spend less time making a fool of yourself. Sincerely, Louie LaSorda/ Boston MA Dear MRR, After reading a couple letters in the latest MRR I've found myself inspired enough to use this magazine as a public forum qnce again on the continuing topic of the complexities of independent record distribution. What ticked me off in particular was the letter from Modern Records in Syracuse NY in which they accused \"certain\" wholesalers of exploitation for the sake of capitalism and implied distributors take no risks whatsoever. I think this viewpoint is rather misleading. Back in October 1984, George of Modern called Toxic Shock to place a sizable order with us for his store. During the conversation I reminded him that since this was his first order with us, his package would be going out C.O.D., until he could fill out a simple commercial reference application. We do this to protect ourselves from writers of bad checks. George said this would be \"no problem\", so we shipped out his package. A couple weeks later, this very same package came back to us, unaccepted. Attempts to reach George by phone were unsuccessful, however we did receive a postcard from him shortly thereafter, where he stated yes, he still wanted the package and asked us to reship it. We complied. Another two weeks, back comes the same package. By this time our shipping expenses had accumulated to over $30 which we are required to pay UPS, plus our time and energy to process the order. All future attempts to contact Modern Records turned futile. Even calling Syracuse information to verify the phone number, we were told there was no listing for Modern Records. No risks, huh George? In his letter George also complained of being asked by distributors to order only what he could sell. Is this unreasonable? Also, distributors do allow stores some return privileges of unsold records (after or if they receive them). The reason we extend credit to a minimal of store accounts is to insure that we'll be able to pay the record labels within a reasonable amount of time. Even when collecting a store check or cash from a store, we won't receive payment from UPS for up to two weeks later. It's rather seldom when we'll sell out of what we receive from the label in the first two weeks therefore we rarely receive all the money owed to the labels in the first 30 days. We've found as Systematic stated in their interview in MRR #16 60 day terms with our suppliers a much more realistic payment schedule. We still pay within 30 days on some of our smaller purchases, but the necessities of \"capitalism\" do indeed involve certain restrictions and yes even risks. Just recently Mike Ness burned us for $75 on some SOCIAL DISTORTION videos that turned out to be blank. So much for junkie capitalism. The other letter I'd like to comment on is by Scott of Gravelvoice, concerning bankruptcy and lack of communication between suppliers and the middleman. Toxic Shock lost $330 on a bad check when Real Records in Houston went bankrupt; we did get partial payment in records though. However this doesn't bother me half as much as seeing the Upstart label thrive after Jorge Newberry's supposed bankruptcy. Erika Records, who manufactures the Upstart label, continues to make his records and collect his money. I think a real simple solution would be for all distributors to boycott Erika/Upstart altogether. Toxic Shock has taken this step but it's ineffective unless every distributor does the same. The record buying public should also stop putting money into Jorge's pockets and simply stop buying Upstart releases (KILLROY, RED SCARE, STALAG 13 and CIRCLE ONE 12\"s and STUKAS OVER BEDROCK 7\"). By the way, has anyone else been burned by Tez of Retaliation in the UK? We sent him $90 in records early last summer and still haven't got a reply. As Scott pointed out, communication is very important. In the formative stages of Toxic Shock's development back in 80-81, we had our financial woes, but in time we cleared up all our old debts and would expect the same of others or at least an explanation. I'm thankful there's a zine such as MRR to communicate a warning to others and allowing everyone in the scene an opportunity to air grievances and numerous subjects. Let's give the accused ample time to respond directly without going public, but if you don't get any response, let's expose the slippery and let others be warned! Another thing that irritates us is when an indie label will refuse to allow us to distribute their records after repeated requests by us due to the high demand from stores we service. We get told \"we have enough distributors already\". Maybe we're looked upon as a small- time operator compared to other distributors with larger warehouses, a bigger staff and a less specialized catalog. We encourage bands, labels and fanzine people to send us samples of their product with related info and to contact us, by phone if possible, as answering letters can get time consuming due to the volume we receive. We sometimes rely on brief notes and form letters to communicate and we don't necessarily distribute everything we receive, but give us a chance. If we do decide to carry your product, help us out by making invoices clearly stated and stay in touch with us. Let us know about important things like tour schedules. Feel free to ask questions. We're here to help. We look at Toxic Shock as a service, not as a capitalistic enterprise. After we meet our expenses, any \"profits\" are put back into our operations. We keep our record label finances separate from distribution, our record label pays for itself without outside funds. Through the label, our mail order service, and distribution, we hope to make underground music available to anyone interested in an alternative.

COLUMNS Q f the columnists Live like Vic Bondi 48 BEFORE 18 Hey folks, get out your dictionaries-- I'm back. I don't know if you noticed, but it's been almost a year since the last \"Live Like Bill\" column. There were personal reasons for that, and public ones too. . .basically l had felt somewhat disenchanted with the whole \"Punk Rock /Hardcore\" whateveritis. I began to feel the whole thing imploding into its own rhetoric, becoming reducible to pat cliches and meaningless slogans: \"We're pissed off. . So what? Hardcore was missing a human face, too concerned with society to care about the self, too occupied with the world to care about each other, too cool to be understanding. Then too, the older set, those who have been around since the early 80's, were standing around complaining about all "
