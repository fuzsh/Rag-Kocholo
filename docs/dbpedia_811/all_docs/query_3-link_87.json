In Tune -Hud!ey*s Editorial Did you know that Coffee Shops are becoming obsolete? Do you carer How about clubs, did you know they've become obsolete too! Beth are important places, special places, magical places, because they bring people together in a rather quaint way.And here is where people get in tune with each other! Near my house (in the middle of the block) in xhe town of Whittier I often go to a near by Coffee Shop. The place is called \"Jacks Salad Bowl\", it's about as tacky as it sounds but it's cool. Lots of elders hang-out there and thev have been hanging out there since their teens and mayoe even longer. I go there to listen mostly, but 1 often share in a conversation or two. I talk to all sorts of people such as the local Preacher or a nice lady Child Psychologist. And maybe a smite from a waitress might take my blues away, usually does, ... a historical situation!! Going to 'Jack's' helps me get in touch with where people are at, and it's better than sitting at home watching T.V. or listening to the same records on the stereo. Clubs are the same as Coffee Shops because they also bring people toqether, though the club have mostly the youthful. But that's becoming obsolete no-thanks to over 21 clubsf I've met quite alot of interesting people at clubs, tnere's noting like the experienc of a small show at a club were everyone's in to the bands. People are in tune at these types of shows, and just be. there can communicate so much to o.i individual, even if not to many words are shared. The tunes of the past are changing. The clubs that brought individuals together in the past have metamorphosized into Hail Shows and Olvmipic concerts! The individual people type of scene is now a group or gang scene. The punk social happening ready has materialized into a pattern of violence and comformaty. The stereotyped punks of yesterday, have become the punks of today, no-thanks to the media and to films. What tune can be tuned in to now? There is like this crazy distortion between the individual tuning forks. The shinning moments of the scene have become dull and void. This brings me to some words bv an interesting person named Ceza X (aka: Dead Beats, Ceza and the Mommv Menj. He was around at the beginning of the LA punk scene, and is stid around! He once described the scene back then as having a kind of Mass Telepathy Power. Something that brought xhe kids together. And he said more of that power is needed for what he called an \"Evolutionary Leap\"! And he states that in the song he called, \"We Need More Power\": We need more power. Civilization is in pretty deep. We all want to win, but the price is too steep Our backs are in the corner We're gonna die like sheep We've got to make A evolutionary leap But there's a problem We need more power ... Extra extra read it and weap The futures getting grim and life is getting cheap our ethics are a chambles Our Histroy is a heap We've got to make a evolutionary leap But there is a problem We need more power So let's declare war And form a human winch let's grab reality and move it over about and inch If the river is there, then the river is crossable We've got to consentrate on doing the impossible but there is a problem We need more power ... I'd have to say: where is the power now? And where is the human winch? Mavbe the scene is dying out. Maybe, 'Hands Across America' could be used as a example of the type of power we need!! The Saturday evening before 'Hands Across America', I had a strong pull to listen to music from the original soundtrack of 'Woodstock' and to listen to some music by 'The Who' and 'Janis Joplin. The 60's had a power going and it died. Maybe some of the old hippies helped create the whole 'Hands Across America' movement? Almost two decades ago the hippie/flower children movement was alive, but it died, is the punk scene also dying or is it already dead? Personaly I feel torn between bands, people in the scene and lyrics. What I tuned into has faded because of so many reasons. Maybe I'm growing up, maybe others are/ The bands and tne lyrics I believed in are not relative anymore. They have all moved far apart from each other. The magnifinq glass no longer has the sun shinning tnrough its lens. The suns rays no longer are burning its focal point and a dark shadow has blocked the sorce of power of the light!! I'll encf this little editorial by sharing a 'tuning in' moment. After 'Hands Across America', we all let go of our hands and we said goodbye to people we'd probably never see again. We crossed the street and while walking to our car (In Jack's Salad Bowl parking lot), I happend to catch a biker kind-of-guy walking near me, and he was saying ... \"From 'Woodstock' to 'Hands Across America' I made it. I'll have something to tell mv grandchildren!\"(This guy was beaming; Of course I was drawn to him like a warp in space time and said, \"You were at Woodstock?!!!!\" (remembering my last night eveninqs musical entertainment!). He told me he had been there and I politely asked if I could shake his hand, and we did shake hands!! And at that moment I' felt a reality move through me because of that touch, that tuning in!! At that moment two youth rebellions were brought together and were united, 66 to 86, two decades, brought to a timeless now!! 1 also remembered his remark, 'I'll have something to tell my Grandchildren.' His grandchildren maybe part of a furture rebellion, which the two of us may never visit, maybe not even in our dreams. And if I ever have children. I'll have something to tell them and of course my grandchildren ... The past The Who \"Tune In On You\" I'm singing this note, cause it fits in well with fhe chords I'm playing. I can't pretend there's meaning here in the things I'm saying But I'm in tune, right in tune, I'm in tune And I'm gonna tune in on you. I got a little tired having to say do you come here often But when I look in your eyes I can see the harmonies and the heart ache softens I'm getting in tune right in tune. Chorus: repeat: I got it all here in my head there is nothing more needs to be said I just banging on my own piano I'm getting in tune to the straight and Narrow Repeat cnorus: I'm singing this note cause ft fits in well with the why I'm feeling There's a symphony that I here in your heart sets mv heart a reeling But I'm in tune Chorus: Near Present ... Marginal Man, \"Fallen Pieces\" As they fall by the way side Who is there to pick them up? People who were once just on the same level Are now just weeds by the highway They used to be friends and they used to be enemies Dropping like flies with no cries of distress Present ASF \"In Mv Heat\" What's this world coming to No one even cares People so worried about Their looks, their hair Everything is twisted Minds are on rewind Are we still looking But no one seems to find Freedom is a word That know one ever knows Money is their greed Money they can have Look and you shall find It's not true anymore This world will never be How I want it to be Faces faces faces All I see are faces Burning holes right through my back Trying to hold on But still trying to withdraw Holding to the rail I think I'm going to fall.

Barbara- we've been around since February of 1982. At first, we av¬ eraged about four issues per year. Then came 1984, an extremely hard time for us, when we only came out with one issue. Last year, we put out two. We want 1986 to see at least three Truly Needies. Q- Have you had lots of changes in format? Barbara- The biggest change in format came when, in #8, we went from xerox stapled on the side to newsprint, stapled in the middle. Also, we aquired an Osbourne-PC with word processing capability, which made things, like error correc¬ tion, much easier. Also, William has gotten much more adept at lay-out. At first, we adopted the generic mode but then we decided we needed a cleaner, more original look. Perhaps this emphasis on packaging may seem phoney, but I believe graphics say a lot about the mag, nearly as much as it's con¬ tent. Q- What type of changes in contribu¬ tors have you had? Barbara- Our contributors have changed vastly. At first, TN was a lark, an idea generated by roomate, college friends and myself. Our first issue was born in the xerox room of the American Psychological Association, where my then-^est friend worked. Then things became a little heavy. Some friends and I began to be immersed in hardcore and American bands, they either stayed with English arty stuff or lost interest in music. We've had loyal writers like Hugh Buyers, Mike Salkink, Jerome Wilson and Mike Heath. And then we've had the more than loyal people, who've run errands and picked up pieces at critical moments like Luis Harris and Marc Sterling. Byron Coley and Howard Wuelfing write for us when we're lucky. And then we have unseen all-important muses like Kathleen Connell, who arranges our parties, and Erica Freed. During 1985, much cross-fertilization occured between TN and the Period. Gordon Gordon, Dan Snoke, and Dave McDuff have all influenced TN. And some of us write for the Period. Q- Are you satisfied with your zine today, and what are some future plans? Barbara- I'm never satisfied completely, although my favorite is usually the most current. The most obvious problem is that we don't come out often enough. We'd like to cover an even wider range of music and add more color to the graphics. We might cover political issues, but this would have to be done very carefully. I despise preaching and I wouldn't want it to begin nere. Q- What are some of the most important topics written about in your issue over the years relating to the underground music scene. Barbara- As far as topics go, we've usually stuck to music, not because we've been unaware of other things. Stimulating an underground culture may not have an immediate impact on events, but it's important in the long run, especially now during this very stifling, conservative era. So a review of the new Black Flag album might not have the immediate, sensational impact of say, a diatribe against aid, to the Contra rebels, but it is just as important. So I don't know how much impact the Nick Cave, Black Flag, Marginal Man or other articles had, but I do believe these, had some relevence. I've been starting to write more articles too, stringing ideas, trends and bands together. Q- You do such in-depth coverage of record reviews and fanzine reviews, what do you do with all the records, tapes and 'zines that you collect? Barbara- Anyone will tell you I'm a nortorious pack rat. I have about 1,000 records. Recently, I've been weeding through my tapes. Also the 'zines that are really bad, I toss. I've sold a very small percentage of the records I've received. Q- Do you think there is too much to cover, or to much repetition going on in the scene? Barbara- Repetition in musical and other artistic movements is inevitable. You get a band with a certain successful sound and hundreds are willing to duplicate it. But, always, always, adventurous souls are foolhearty or wacked out enough to stumble onto something orignal. It's the fanzine writer's job to find and commend these special people. There is too much to cover; that's why we have room for many fanzines. sometimes get restless because I know there are hundreds of cool records by cool bands I don't know about. That's why I read 'zines so avidly. Q- Who are some of the most exciting and fun bands you have seen or interviewed? Barbara- Most exciting bands covered: MY favorite interview was with Henry Rollins, closely followed by chats with the Fall, the Minutemen, Husker Du, Nick Cave, Jeffrey Pierce, Einsturzende Neubaten and Big Black. Q- Describe your situation as a female fanzine writer? Barbara- My situation as a female fanzine writer is a double-edged sword. Sometimes men in bands are more than receptive to women: Mark Smith, Bob Mould, Mike Watt, Nich Cave and Jello Biafra seemed to be more at ease with me than they would have otherwise. Dunno if this has anythig to do with my gender, though. Then again, there were the bands who dismissed me as a groupie, who ignored me, but I think these were in the minority. I also support more women in music like Lydia Lunch, Frightwig, Anti Scrunti Faction, Salem 66, Razebrae, X-Mal Deutscheland, even the Bangles. I love watching women rock out; it's why I miss Kira being in Black Flag, tor example. I do wish there were more female rock critics. I've found critics to be more sexist than the bands. If I I didn't work on Truly Needy. I'd probably remain unpublished. In rock criticism it's been the fashion recently to ruminate on what certain music does to your pud, an option not open to me. Around the scene. I've noticed cold shoulders from some local musicians. It's funny when band members communicate messages to me through Bill. Perhaps they feel uneasy with me. Who knows? Q-Tell us about your local Scene? How are the Clubs in your area, the bands in your area, the politics in your area? Barbara- Ah, the local scene! I'm still an outsider, but I think my distance has made me a better re¬ viewer. So I'm going to be brutally honest: DC is nara on alternative musicians. The clubs are sparse. We have thre 9:30 club, which has a fine physical plant and a somewhat adventurous booking policy. DC space is a smaller, more cramped venue (Half the size of the Anti-Club so I'm told). So the 9:30's bascally the only game in town, a sort of benevolent monopoly. Sometimes things can get cramped, like at the Fall and Robyn Hitchcock shows. No open-minded hall exists with a capacity between the 9:30 and the Capital Center (WUST Radio Hall, where the Kennedys once played, is in the middle of one of the largest heroin dealing districts on the East Coast. Most likely, no more shows will be there). Our band scene is diverse. First off, we have the well-known Dischord crowd and its various graduates (As I write, I just recently learned that the members of Embrace parted ways). Kingface is one of my fav¬ orites, though they're less well-known. We have a' slew of young hardcore bands like Kids For Cash, Nothing For Christmas and Dag Nasty, among others. Then we have a bunch of wimpy pop bands who do U-2 covers and tne crowd seems to be resurfacing with the re-emergence of the Velvet Monkeys and emergence of the Mourn¬ ing Glories and Hyaa. A brilliant new band has popped up, provisionally called \"Beefbag* featuring Joe, Malcolm and Mark from Grand Mai and Jeff from Minor Threat. Let u3 not forget starlwarts like the Slizkee Boys, who were garage years before it was cool. Black Market Baby, Half Japanese, and Tommy Keene. Also, we have a young indust¬ rial scene with Pussy Galore, Peach of Immortality and New Carollton and a an art pop scene with 9353 (new album out!). Troubled Gardens, and Broken Siren. Olive Tree Reconds is home for the dred funk punks like Psychotics, Outrage, Zion Train, and HR. Many of you might already know that the Bad Brains have already signed with SST. Original heavy metal has died down a bit since the dissolution of the Obessed and Pentagram but some notables are Scythian, Factory, Asylum and Chained Lace. I try to stay away from scene politics as much as possible since it trivializes our aspirations. We do have our share of Nazis and fascists. I took upon these folks as emotionally distrubed and certainly not representa¬ tive of the majority. Some have begun to wave the banner of politics after ignoring it for many years. They preach with the perfervence! i j,: ; { i!|i of the newly converted. While thisl%; : !jiji !J:j well-meaning cant can be overbear inq,\"-^ it's probably healthy. Positive Force (211 Florida Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C., 20008) has done a gooci ‘ 1 .. informing the underground on various topics. and the allegedly alternattvie radioii station have generally iqnored ouH resilient underground scene. One outlet, aside from the fanzines, is WMUC which does a lot more than it's 10 Watts might suggest. Q- Is there anything you want to S et off your chest, (so to speak)? arbara- I've spewed out more than enough already. I'll simplv add that it's very important to keep the under¬ ground network thriving and open- minded in these politically, socially and culturally conservative times. I don't mean just overtly political organs either. The similarly conser¬ vative 50s had Burroughs, Kerouac, Ginsberg, as well as the jazz giants. We have not worked hard enough m. j* to challenqe \"conventional wisdon . • :.ntr jf ^ Pehaps cuftural historians will rate Minutemen, Minor Threat and Black Flag with Coltrane and Charlie Parker. I dunno. But we've got to have more artiste ammunition to challenge these static, often repressive times (not that this is enough). &LOA/t>e PooFD/tfl^ OAJWRADC \\MF\"* PUBLICATIONS 2 * 4*1 Newsprint P= Printed rox N = newsletter G £= Small (1-16 pages) M = Medium (16-48 pages) L= Large (more than 48) Notes- MC = Multi-colored [= with inserts s s= send stamps when ordering 1 = exceptional zine .s7 ZINE2 A.C.

They say they recorded this tape for $26 live and will send it to anyone who sends them a blank C90 and postage. Singer Jae Monroe sounds like Joan Baez turned punk after listening to Penelope Houston; much better singing than when she's talking/shouting. Unfortunately, her voice detracts from listening to the rest of the band, which turns out a well-done mixture of styles leaning heavily on punk and 60's influenced folk-rock. Some fine songs like \"Registration\" and \"Cinderella\" and stretches of good musicianship scattered here and there augure well for the future. Topically, the band tackles all the issues; pacifism, vegetarianism, feminism, punk fashion, the environment, politics, etc. I could criticize some of their lyrics; 1 think they would welcome the dialog. As for reviewers, I could quote a line from their closing song: \"Do you judge by magazines?\" (Donny) ADRENALIN OD/BEDLAM \"Caught In the Act\" shared Ed (Buy Our Records, Box 363, Vauxhalt NJ, 07088). Until the next Lp comes out,we'll just have to pick up bits and pieces all over the place. The instrumental, \"Master\" must be played at 45, when it sounds like the Royal Highlands of New Jersey Scottish Punk Band. It sent my cat into a frenzy dashing back and forth at neadlong blitzspeed. \"We Will Rock You\" demolishes in proper style a classic rocker from Queen. \"Traffic Jam 1 ' is 9 seconds a capella. The rest is talk. On the Bedlam side, \"Creepy Fuckin' Hitchcock\" is def, \"Lost In Space\" is memorable (but also found on the \"One Big Crowd\" comp); \"A.I.D.S.\" is just lousy. (Donny! ARTLESS Ep (Placebo Records) Yup. It's the great da da of punk rot...spewing forth h.c. noise thrash (and the like), and a Flipperesque \"I am a Rock\". This was the very first time I heard stuff from Mykel Board's Artless. I was expecting no-core jazz, or something, but it turned out to be good ol' punker shit. Gee...l saw some artsy bastards walk out of the record __j_* _- ♦ ii a i in.. ay. (Katz) Stic) Soriy guys. The mix ‘ ' d...BoD? whei ‘ returned it the next da 1 AGRESSION Lp. (Mysi . __ _ ^ 4 job leaves alot to be desired...Bob? Where's the bass? The slow stuff also has alot to be desired. A K STATE OF MIND / CHUMBAWAMBA Ep. (Agitland Records) An impressive package (a 16-page info-packed booklet) but unfotunately, not an equally impressive record. The Chumbawamba side gets a bit too Crass-ish and both bands mix folk and thrash to get their views accross. It gets a bit redundant creativitwise, but they seem very dedicated. Still, one of the better of its genre and the information kept me unsettled for days. (Joy) THE BRIGADE \"The Dividing Line\" Lp (Better Youth Organization Rec.) Classy packaging, artsy cover, clean, innovative songs, creative new music and real slick production. W qy too slick. The Brigade formerly Youth Brigade, departs from it's fast-paced sing-a-longs to a more Simple Minds meets U2. Okay for people into the ''Rock of the 80's\" but not for me. BARNACLE CHOIR \"85 BC\" cassette. (Warpt West, PO Box 8045, Santa Cruz, CA 95061-8045 \"Jim Skafish-meets-Whatever\" sarcaso weird musick, with something to say, the the bummed-out intelligent people. (Katz) BEST OF B.C.T. #1 \"We Can Do Whatever We Want\" V/A LP (B.C. TApes and Records. P.O. BOx 16205, San Diego, CA 92116) w/ Raw Power, Eat the Rich. Psycho. Traumatic, Rattus, I Refuse It!, Violation, bnufflex. War Dogs, Detention, Suburban Decay, Shockin' T.V., Terveet Kadet, Wretched, No Response, Peggio Punx,Cheetah Chrome Motherfuckers. Even though the recording quality of some of these tracks are not the best, (Do you expect every one to record their stuff on a 36-track teac studio recorder?),most of these bands R unch out some raw h.c. music. Yes, yes.yes, ike any comp) there are a couple of klunxers, but they're outnumbered by good tracks. A good portion of the disc are manic thrashers, but the most ear-catching tunes belong to I Refuse It! (Thrash w/keyboards) and Detention (Great recording quality, for live, and real funny, sarcastic lyrics, primo). (Katz) BUTTHOLE SURFERS \"Rembrandt Pussyhorse\" (Touch + Go Records) Oh no! They're playing \"musick\"! I don't know what to say?; Mark says alright! Woof. Woof. (What?) (Katz) BEDLAM \"Lost in Space\" (Buy Our Records) This Lp goes quick and opens up to the instrumental theme to \"Lost in Space\". Ya, its thrashy and comes with a record cover with lyrics on it. A long list of thank-yous and a small list of fuck Vs\" (Hud) BLACK FLAG 'Who's Got The 10 1/2' (live.KSST) Which seems to be missing the live aspect. With the exception of the auidence in the background. Has all the fav's plus \"Drinking and Driving\" I think lt ? s nice to see Black Flac concerned about peoples stupidity, great recorc with studio sound - JlLL BUTTHOLE SURFERS 'Rembrandt Pussyhole (Touch and Go, POB 433, Dearborn, Ml 48121 This is a great record, one of the best I've hearc in awhile. Neat original stuff and all sorts of different instruments about the place. No it ain't full on thrashing punk rock, in fact is kinc of slow and even tribal at times (But so what?) A pleasant surprise as I lost interest in the Buttholes for awhile. -ALBY BLUE HOLLOW 'Stealing A Whisper' (Still Records, 132 Garfield St v New Bedford, Ma USA) Haunting type stuff with bass carving things through ana guitar cutting in and out to add that atmospheric touch. More new music than anything, but don't discard it coz of that as it does have that certain something to keep you hanging in there. Reminicent of U2 in places (Yeah, I know comparisons, comparisonsljALBY THE COLORS \"Vivid Colors\"(Poe Records. POB 15481, Detroit, Ml 48215) 5 song Ep. A 60's garage band, so-so production, weakly mixed album.This band has energy and fun. (Gus) CONFLICT \"Bust Fund\"LP (P.O.B.448, Eltham, London, S E 9. UK) Live. Mud. All for raising dough for tneir cause. What goes? What happened with Mortarhate? (Katz) CONFLICT \"Only Stupid Bastards Help E.M.I.\" LP (same address as above) Again Live. Not too muddy. Recorded at the Olympic. Again, for raising dough. (Katz) CONFLICTING INTERESTS demo tape (106 N. Trevor St. Anaheim. CA 92806) Well, we got the tape damaged (cracked tape body and some heat damage), cuz they neglected to send it with protection (padding, insulation, and last but not least a tape case!) Because of the state the tape was in I thought it was some cheap shit recorded live in tneir garage, but ! was wrong! Surprisingly enough, they recorded their stuff in a studio! What I thought was going to be really boring turned out to be really potent thrash (the first couple of songs were damaged by heat so they sounded kinda \"whooshy\"). This shit really rips with intensity! Come on guys, go to the nearest Xerox place and make some killer tape covers! This tape deserves better...and don't forget a tape case! (Katz) # % DC-3 (SST) Okay, this album is downright boring. But I can't say that about the members of this band. They all have inspired alot of people, including me. But sorry, this stuff is Hist not fun! (Hud) 7 D.C.NECROS \"History of...\" cassette (Pete Molin, 1041 9th st. #50, Albany,CA 94710) They released this tape when they noticed their band (1980-1983) listed, among others, in a past issue of FIipside(History of D.t. scene). 7 songs displaying ap early hardcore style, not the more familiar rapid-fire kind of stuff, but might be worth checking into. I guess they feel good to know that they are not being forgotten. TKatz) DECLINO / NEGAZIONE - 'Mucchio Seluaggio' (Cor Records, UK, Box 33, 37 Stokes Croft, Bristol BSL 3PY England) Hey if you're into that European thrash sound, this record rips. Two hot bands from Itally, that have got it all. Some of the intensity of the guitar playing leaves your month open. The spirit of this music breaks down the language barrier. -ALBY DISSENSION 'Why Work For Death' (Metal Storm Rec., 6110 E. Los Arcos St. Long Beach Ca 90815) A band playing some pre.tty mean thrash with neat little tempo changes along the way. Still I think the best is yet to come from this group. Though I've been assured there the best in tne area (Maybe?) Where's the lyrics? (Or didn't we get any?)- Alby DOG MATICS 'Everbody Does lt'(Dutch East India) 77 punk sound kinda like the Saints or Heartbreakers with a great remake of 'Teenager in Love' 'cept their version 'Teenage Lament'. I'm not a dancer but I'd dance to these guys .- JILL DC3 'The Good Hex'(SST Records) Listening to this record I feel 15 again DC3 definitly has the 70's sound + good for them. The 50's + 60's sound is overkilled, this is just good R + R with out any hype crap.-JILL DIE KREUZEN 'Oct. File'(Touch 6 Go, POB 733 Dearborn, Mi 78121) Metal thrash well I don't think they can be classified that. They're well more like a rivet hammer pounding your ears. These guys are intence + this 2n<iLTP is the best so far. Real crisp clean well produced. Verv impressive.-JILL ED GEINS CAR \"Makinq Dick Dance\" (319 3rd St. #21, Brooklyn NY 11215) The talent g limpsed at at times in this bands single \"Brair ead Baby\" come into it's own in their first LP variea collection of interesting songs featuring a punk - demented - satirical - humor in the lyrics throatily delivered by Scott Weiss and backed bv a band that does well at c number of different speeds. Go for a spin ir Ed Geins ca, but first check your insurance (Donny) EXPLETIVE DELETED \"The Nixon Tapes\" £ song tape (c/o Gerry, 1 Area PL. Staten Is., NY 10314) Your basic off the shelf new band showing some areas of promise. Mixture of standard hardcore and the sort of thing Maryland's Sub-Mensas do much better. Undistinguished production doesn't help out but \"Organized Religion\" is the germ of a really good song. (Donny) F.C.C. \"Live Cheesecake\" 15-song tape (234 Holland Rd., Holmdel, NJ 07733) Basically standard h.c., Dave Madsen trying to sound like Ian. A ska version of \"Wild Thing\" and \"Me, Myself and l\"(Which could be developed into an excellent song) stand out in the crowd. With alot of work and a decent studio, could be a good ep in it. (Donny) FOE \"Life After Christ\" 6 song tape ($3.50 to Dave Hoskins, 15 Braen Ave. Hawthorne, NJ 07506) This band, which grew out of the former Malignant Tumor, plays fast thrash with skill; speeds up \"Smoke On The Water\" and makes a decent rocker out of that old chestnut; \"Slaughterhouse\" marries Mike Klaskow's well=crafted bass lines to Johnny Devious' Mike Muir-style narrative vocals for good effect. A worthy Foe is counted a blessing in many teachings. (Donny) F.S.P. \"Call Me Paranoid\" cassette ($2.00 to F. S.P., 4608 Metpark De., Las Vegas, NV 89110) Kinda Grundqy-core. Most of tne stuff on it is not quite fnrash. Gives me the same kind of feeling as listening to Black Flag. (Katz) GET SMART ^'Swimming With Sharks\" (Restless/Fever Rec. 671 S. Fourth, Philadelphia, PA 19147) A whole album of upbeat rhythmic paced music. Mixture of hard-edqecf pop with harmonizing vocals. If I listenecTto alot of Pop Top 40 radio, this is the way I'd want it to be. (Gus) G. N.P. \"Grossest National Product\" cassette (4679 Wooddale Ln. Pelham, AL 35124) Twangy guitar, chunky rhythm. Definitely \"garage 1 '. They also have some thrashers, too. Funny lyrics (another plus). Let's see what they're going to do next. (Katz) GERMS 'Rock n Rule'(XES Records) I love the Germs but I can't figure out why they put out this LP. (Lack of $) who knows. Sound ain't bad, great cover, nostalgia has hit punk rock. -JILL HAPPY WORLD 'Jump For Joy' ep (Regressive Records, 3965 Fox St. Denver Co 80216) I feel real priviledged to do this, 1) I've known these guys for years. 2) I think they are great with their own melodic early punk sound w / physhedelic tendencies. Good aspect about n\\jy py Wurld is they are great on vinyl or live.- INDIGESTI r Osservati Dall'inganno' (TVOR casella Postale 804, Como 5, 22100 Como, Itally) The one thing that detratcs from this record is the low level of the vocals, the guitar screams over the top of them. Otherwise there's some neat thrash here that gets real fast. Lyrics are translated on a lyric sheet and deal with feeling and thoughts in a bizarre way. The musics tiqht and drumming is hot.- ALBY KGB \"Rock Hudson/Plastic Liberal\" (Velvet Elvis Rec. POB 23336. Mpls, MN 55423) Singer Jim Smith sounds like a refugee from the \"Return of the Living Dead\" movie. Stupid lyrics and musical Sominex. 1 forgot the other song as soon as it ended. (Donny) KEfN GRUND ZUR BERUHIGUNG \"Letzte Bestellung\" cassette (c/o Hannes Koerber, Munzgasse 13, 7400 Tubingen, W. Ger.) Geez. These guys put alot of time and effort puttin' this together. They get an A+ for their lyrics/info booklet, their use of graphics and the effort they put into the tape itself. I really enjoyed it. The music's old style (c. 1981J hardcore with tons of hooks and melodies. They also do a parody cover of the Sweet'e \"Ballroom Blitz\" (With the, crowd screaming fer K.G.B.!) Great release. (Katz) LES LARMES (Lost Arts Rec.s POB 85338, L.A., CA 90072) Ok, while listening to this album, I happened to have a groovy experience (like a crazy square root). T took the newly opened album cover and placed the open end to my nostrils, to smell tne fumes and to my surprise, as I syuck my nose in, I noticed the reflection on either side of the album cover. Now balancing my parallax view I noticed a kaleidoscope view. Try it. Need a reflective album cover! That's the beauty of this moody album. Cool cover of \"Ode to Billy Joe\" (Hud) LUDICHRIST 15 song demo taj>e (c/o Tommy Christ, 7 Third Ave., Farmingcfale, NY 11735j Best part of this is the well illustrated zine/lyric book included. Basic speed-thrash from Long Island mixed with metallic wandering or wailing guitar breaks, underlying interesting punk lyrics. They tell ya in polite company don't talk politics or religion so this band tackles both. Whaddya expect from someone named Christ? If Stuart could talk, he'd protest that \"Most People Are Dicks\" is slander to the noble organ. \"God Is Everywhere\" is theologically correct from a Hindu standpoint anyway. Add to the long list of punx fueled by the Catholic Church (I was born a Catholic but escaped early) this Tommy Christ. (Donny) THE LEAD \"Return Fire\" cassette (POB 822. Coconut Grove. FL. 33123) Religion? Punkf Jesus? The Christian \"God\"? What goes...? Just when you thought religious songs were limited to folky \"Jesus-freak' r stuff, Stryper, and (to a limited extent) Bad Brains and Rh7, along cums a hardcore band preachin' Jesus (seriously). The music's okay, 6ut I'm not crazy about the lyrics. But that's their business. Some of the slower stuff doesn't carry as much of a punch as their thrashers do, but that's true with most slow songs. The singer kinda reminds me of Chrissie Hynde, for some weird reason. (Katz) MEAT PUPPETS 'Out My Way' No country punk this time more melodic swing + structured vocals great album to listen to while in the hammock drinking iced tea. Exta plus \"Good Golly Miss Molly\"- JILL MISSIOU (Frantic Records, 2105 Maryland, Ave, Maryland, 21218) \"When Thunder Comes\" Intense energy energy 60's garage rock. A clear self-produced album. (GusT MAD PARADE \"Right Is Right\" EP (Toxic Shock Rec.POB 242, Pomona, CA 91769) This is something Sham/Subs fans can probably relate to, yet this slab still keeps its originality. Clean guitars, sing-a-lonq vocals, good production and a great version of'\"Mother's Little Helper\" Blue Vinyl. A must. (Joy) THE MOBERLYS \"Sexteen\" (Lolita Rec's. F.G.L. 80, ou du Maine, 75014 Paris. France) Seattle pop transplants doin' the L.A. scene with foreign wax, (Them frenchys appreciate our local U.S. homeboys), that's been out awhile but not gotten much press stateside. Another Plimsouls-sounding band (See \"Real Impossibles'), but with more emphasis on sex that time. I know these guys are more well-rounded lyrically, but this is an older representation and they have probably opened up with their newer stuff. Some tough rock, tnough, with Jim Bosnight coming oTf as a confident singer/guitarist with a good sense of humor, hooks and phrasing, pushed and supporteed by a solid rhythm duo (now a trio). Hopefully next time they'll discover that life is more than just sex (cars, food, bowling?), or is it??? Hey, maybe this is just an outdated concept record (kinda like Berlin!), ya...sure. (Poocn) THE NEIGHBORS \"The High Hard One\" (Restless Records/Enigma) This Boston band releases a full album'. Energetic paced rock. This is the syuff that should be played on Top 40 radio- not that English crud. (Gus) NEW REPUBLIC \"Good Missiles, Good Manners, Good Night\" 10 song tape w/lyrics (2 Jenni Ln. Norwood, NJ 167^8). New bands like this reconfirm my faith in the good health of punk grassroots. Original, thoughrul lyrics on a wide variety of subjects, sung with raw passion by Brenden O'Blivion (Berlin 1930 has returned/ and we're more than just a little bit concerned\"); rSellinq Out to Metal\" fires a shot accross the bow of the Combat etc. bands; \"Gay Rape Squad\" turns the table on \"queerbashers*' (about time someone sang it, as its been an issue of the scene long enuf, but I'm afraid the careless listener could mistake it for a homophobic song, and it reinforces the harmful stereotype, one that has no relation to facts— all studies indicate that rape of other males is generally committed by \"straights\", not gays); USA for S. Africa\" has Brendan singing about S. Africa with a fake Jamacan accent to decent reggae and mixing some Rasta stuff with it, weird. The bands are original compositions built on a hardcore base; Abbie Normal's guitar shines occasionally. Three cheers! (Donny) Oznerol (Madeis Space) Lorenzo Bohue the bass player for the Dickies + Fear had a new project and it's name is Oznerol, with a 4 song song EP. Pop music for nice people, but who's nice Anymore? - GUS Charlie Pickett \"Route 33\" (win tone 445 Olive Ave. So. Mpls., Mn 55405).The style of music is a electricfied honkie tonk blues. Another example of the great work of the twin tone label produces. -GTJS Psyche (Mass Productions, c/o POB 5153 Station A Toronto M5W 1N4)Boring synth stuff, not as good as 'Suicide' Alot of fun to play for them. but not so fun to listen to for me. -Hud Pandoras 201 _ \"Stop pretending*' (Rhino 1 Olympic Santa Monica Blvd, ta 90404) If you are into that 60's pop/psychedelic sound, especially the sound with a female singer - this is for you. This all female L.A. bana has put out a real catchy, good sounding disc here - it shows lots of roots, but that's ok for some reason - normally I'd say on that point, but here I rave. (Al) The Pognes - \"Pognetry in motion\" - MCA Fronted by lead singer Shane (with worse teeth than Strummer) Macbowen, this rather large Irish group mixes modern socio-political lyrics and views with a backdrop of traditional Irish pub rock and jigs, creating some of the most intelligent ana distinctive music to come out of the Isles in years. This 4 song ep doesn't hit me as being string as their previous American release \"Rum Sodomy\" and \"The Lash\" (which was also deftly produced by Elvis Costello) due to someone's more usual approach of singing songwriting and loss of the ethnicity that made them different in the first place. Side two reverts somewhat, but the first song talks American and the second is an instrumental. Not at all a bad record mind you, but a bit more normal and watered down. Still Shane and the band are very talented.(Why do the The Boomtown Rats pop into mind!?) 6 could progress into something major on the next release. Definately check 'em out, 'cos if they've ever recorded any lousy tunes, they're certainly not on these records - Buy!! Buy!!! (Pooch) PLEASED YOUTH 'Dangerous Choo-Choo' (Buy Our Rec. POB 363, Vauxhall, NJ 07088 USAO Not unlike a lot of other thrash stuff about. Words range from humoros to more serious like. Production is quite good but sounds a bit samey after awhile. 1 like the vocals. Another band who will definetely qrow in time. -ALBY RADWASTE 'Cooking + Nothingness' (Happy Squid) The debut from this percussonated evolution of 100 Flowers. 6 highly danceable tunes featuring the mean guitar licks of Mike Kory and 4 drummers!! John Jones (Urinal/100 Flowers) sings and thumps and pumps these tunes into funk, rock masterpieces. Too bad it's only an ep (AL) THE REAL IMPOSSIBLES \"4x4\" (F.K.A.D. Records, 6050 Canterbury, 6228 Culver City, Ca 90230) After slagging out locally, these LA guys finally put out some vinyl, and it's pretty cool to boot. Plimson's comparisons are obvious , even if it weren't produced by Peter Case, whose new Geffin album sounds great from what I've heard so far, but that ends once the toughness of the instruments takes hold. Then you realize that they do have a real handle on the original sources (Byrds, Standells). This is one solid ep from a foursome definately worth keeping an ear out for. 'Sides phast Pheadie sez it's cool 'nuff said' (Pooch) RIM AND THE BELIEVERS (Harmony Records PO Box 1100 San Francisco, CA 94101.)\"lnternational Funk\"ep. Dance mix disco music in a new package. Da ta da ta Hump Funk. (Gus) RAIN PARADE \"Beyond the sunset\" (Restless/Enigma.) The live record from their Japanese tour in '84. Why do the Japanese always put out great live records? If anyone knows, write to us and tell us the story. Well anyway, the record itself is Rain Parade at their best. My only complaint is you can't hear any real audience response. (GusJ ROADSIDE PETZ \"Take Two\" 7 song tape. (LSP, band: (c/o T.Morse, 100 Lexwood Dve. #30B Lexington Park, MD 20653) Why not? These are the kind to take home and keep around. Clear vox, intriguing lyrics, good HC songs: these pets know what they're doing. \"Talk too much\" is excellent, \"Billy Was A Skinhead\" a superfast tribute to \"a skinhead prgud and true\" makes me eye my clippers. takes the fall\" is a good song. Feed 'em' n' see how they qrow...(Donny) RHYTHM PIGS \"Rhythum Pigs\" (Mordam POB 988 SF, CA 94101) An unusual mix of fast punky rock and slower, melodic, hormonized vocals give this band an unusual appeal. Maybe they are an 80's answer to updating r and b? Anyway- this is an enjoyable change of pace- I hope they continue to play the punk scene. (Al) REA RESPIRATOR ,r Slapp Loss Alla Band\" cas¬ sette. ($2.00 PPD to : F 6 M Grehn, Sofia Dahl bergsg. 4,573 00 Tranas, 0140/166 oz, Sweden.) Really Grundgy Thrash. Kinda \"generic\" Not too catchy. (Katz) RAMONES 'Animal Boy' The Ramones were the first punk band and probably will be the last. This album rips from start to finish, even the ballad (\"Don't Tell Me How To Love My Baby'*) is great. It also has two more songs by Dee Dee Ramone, how about a Dee Dee solo album? He even does a song about Sid 6 Nancy (\"Love Kills\"). They do some songs about Monkeys, drinks + something to believe in, hum, tnis sounds familar, onfy this one, to me really is something to believe in and you should too. Buy, buy buy, you won't be disapointed. (Sickboy) STAN RIDGEWAY \"The Big Heat\" (IRS) At last!!, geez + well worth the wait, max on my tape pTayer w/a bullet. We're talkin' full on Cinema matic visions with solid rock backing, courtesy of some of LA's finest (Minutemen/ Fibonacci's. Rayonics, etc) + real session cats. Lotsa stuff to pick up on with each listening + Stan's phrasing + sense of humor just keeps improving. Not unlike Pal Tom Wait's newest stuff where you can stick on dem phones + get a whole film festival in dolby + Techno color I ike. S^ take a seat + pass the popcorn, 5 stars. STURM GROUP (Greenfuse Records, 12 Earl St. Toronto, Ontario, Canada M4V IM3, 416 964 -6227) A musical soundtrack experience! I promise the next party I have I will play it so we will all feel like we're all staring on Miami Vice! Heavy drums. Sax. guitar, jazy sound. -Hudley SONld YOUTH \"Evol\" (SST) Sonic Youth moves to SST with their 1st full album. With 9 complete songs. Once again their unique approach intraps ones attention. This time out there are some refinements, t^e length of songs shorter and more accessible, their best record so far. (Gus) THE SERVICE \"America's Newest Hitmakers\" (Prauda Rec. POB 268043 Chicago IL, 60626) A talented mix off 60's and todays roots rock. A geat produced + mixed sounding recording. Their lyrics have all the right hoolcs. It's nice to hear a piano again. Shoulcf get lots of College radio airplay (GusJ SUBURBAN UPRISING \"The Jersey Beat Col¬ lection\" (comp, cas: Jersey Beat, 418 Gregory Ave., Weehawken, NJ 07087) 20 bands. The \"Pop Side\" tries to show that there's nothing new under the sun, old styles can be fun. The New Breed, Mod Fun and the Alter Boys do it best, but 4 of the songs are losers. On the \"Punk Side' 1 things get better, as AOD's classic \"Suburbia\", not on their LP, is worth the price of the tape alone. Then there's Pleased Youth, Das Damen, the Skulls, and Sacred Denial to warm your spirits. Even the nortorious Love Pushers came up with a decent song, tho it is problematic. The real find of this tape is the Punsters, whose \"Jive in Jersey\" had me in stiches. But then I went to high school in the Chemical state. Sound is good but low volume. Put out by Jersey Beat fanzine's Jim Testa, but not all the bands are from \"Joizee\" (Donny) STRAW DOGS Formely the FU's, this Boston 5 piece (+ a new ■ lead guitar player) doesn't try to put a metallic edge to hardcore, but instead goes headfirst, I mean completely, into heavy metal. The info states that the sound \"It's enough to convert any hardcore fan to the metal sound\" What bullshit.- JOY SKULLS \"Dress Up and Die\" (Buy Our Rec, POB 363 Vauxhall, NJ 07088) Fast raunchy rock and roll played with that trashy Thunders / Andy Scott guitarcatchy tunes, just like so many others like this coming out of LA lately. They do alright, but they snow what they ain't by covering Sweets \"Set Me Free\". (The singer has an amazing Brain Connolly sound alike voice!) Being a big Sweet fan I nave to give a thumbs up to Skulls! (AL) STUPIDS \"Stupids\" (COR Box 333, 37 Storkes Craft, Buistol B52 3PY England) Start stop, fast thrashy stuff, most of which spins its wheels, but the tunes that catch, burn. Especially on the songs like \"Always Never Fun\" that use good backing vocals. A very energetic LP. (AL) THE SCENE \"High Numbers / Shout\" single (Checkmare Rec.) The title cut is a wimpy and uninspiring MOD-number, but the B-side offers a little bit better with a poppy Selector - inspired tune. Needs more punch but if you're into this sort of stuff. (Joy) SINCERE FIBERS 4 song Demo (1278 Glenneyre, Suite 36. Laguna Beach, Ca 92651) Yo Mr. Bell ... No. We haven't gone out of business (never have, never will We're still here in punkland punking it out. I don't know where you guys drifted off to. We're still involved with the punk scene (The one most ex-\"Punk\" Trendy fuckers slag.) We'll still be here long after most trendies float off elsewhere. Well,'bout the music? Sorry. But. Not my brand of laxatives ..(Katz) SMOKING DAVE + THE PREMO DOPES- \"Planting a Dead Tree\" cassette (B/S records c/o Todd Steed, Box 8190, University Station, Knoxville, TN 3)996 - 4800) Garage rock w/a '60ish feel, 'cept \"Front Row\" which reminds me of Texas' NFS (A slightly Punky Tune), and \"Love of Youth\" which kinda sounds surfy. Mellow. (Katz) SWANS \"Time Is Money\" (Bastard) I was real impressed with this 3 song Ep. Just as powerful as their live performances. They have a slow repitivie grinding industrial sound that overwhe¬ lms you to want to turn it off or bang your head. A must for metal industrial heads. Recommended at high volume. -JILL SCARTCH ACID \"Just Keep Eating' (Rabid Cat POB 49263. Austin, TX 78765) This record grew on me as I listened to it. Good variation of stuff ranging from some grinding type tunes with weird almost screaming type voice to more up tempo stuff. I really haven’t heard a group like this before. It always stays pretty powerful. Interesting. -Alby 76% UNCERTAIN 'Nothing But Love Songs' (Shmega Records) This band is a cut above most and this is a neat little record. It's got everthing you need; good sound, good production, lyrics, music, etc. And enough content (as in changes, etc) to keep it interesting, (what more do you want?)-Alby SONIC YOUTH 'Halloween'(Homestead Rees. Industrial psycadelic thing to this ep. The word content would definitly offend the record rating mothers. This is more powerful to listen to in a dark room.-Jill TSOL \"Revenge\" This is TSOL's best album to date. This group has shown great durability throughout tne years, and I really believe this is the album that is going to break them into a larger market and I hope you guys really do it because you really deserve it. It starts with \"No Time\", \"Colors\", \"Madhouse\" and basicity every song on this album is great. It finishes with \"Everybody's a Cop\" which makes me want to pluq a guitar in and play with them, it's inspiring. Buy this album, it is undoubtedly the best American album this year, hands down. (Sickboy) ** Don't be disilusioned, this album is not DRI or COC but in my opinion one of the two best American Ips in a very long time. (Ramones being the other). But if Metal edge is for you then check out Mellalica \"Master of Puppets\". Nuff said. TU-DO HOSPITAL 'Patients of ...' (Wasserstr. 176, 4630 Bochumi, W. Germany) This power German band features a full on over kill flick knife guitar attack- that they blend in with melodic and spontaneous thrash and rock and some how never seem to cross over to a boring metal masturbation. Great lyrics and singing pull it all together. (AL) TREACHEROUS JAY WALKERS 'Earth' cass¬ ette ($3.00 ppd to: John Haden. 16916 Bolinger Dr., Pacific Palisades, Ca 90292) this has to be the most grundgiest band I've hear yet. I have a hard time listening to it, but my brother swears that they're real killer. I'll let you decide.-Kats \"USKOLLISEN KOIRANSA CRAGEMUREN VALOSSA v/a cassette ($2.00 + blank C-60 tape to: Tero Lehto, Kiverionk 12, 15140 Lahti, Fin¬ land) w/Rattus, Sanctuary, Dorian Gray, Attila the Stockbroker, Iconoclasts (UK). A joint Fin.- /Uk release. Rattus shows that they play more than just gut-rippin' thrash. They also put forward a \"Rock\" song and a '77 Brit. Punk\" song in a nearly- Clash style. Sanctuary was a bit hard to listen to .. too noisy. Dorian Gray is Finland's answer to \"Death Rock\". Lot's of wailing vocals. Real bass- heavy. Like most of it's local counterparts it left me uninspired. Fast forward. Now to side B. While Attila + Co. are jammin' to their folk-punk the Iconoclasts puts forth some real gems (Best tracks on this tape), with their unique thrashers. Deez ladies did a great job. (KATZ) UK SOBS 'In Action' Double LP (In green vinyl, RFB Recodings: Dist. by Pinnacle) This double slab commemrates their tenth years as a band (!?!) Ten years! That's how ola the Spin Maq. dinks claims how old the punk scene is. ALL the tracks (32 sonqs) recorded are 'live' (nowhere hear 'MUD\")1've never been a fanatic about 'ol brit-punk, but this disk kinda grows on me (after listening to it about a half a dozen times), besides I love colored vinyl... (KATZ) LA'S WASTED YOUTH 'Get Out of My Yard\" ep(Open Circle Records) These guys are back with a vengeance (and a new singer!) Angry, biting guitars and a Keith- influenced vocalist make tnis vinyl top notch. Check out \"Young and Bored\" -Joy WHITE PIGS 'Songs of Sin' cassette (Box 18152, E. Hartford, Ct 06118) Metal- bangin' punkers. Only 2 'Speed-metal' songs (in the \"Motorhead— Meets Priest vein) They do a 'Metal' version of the Munsters theme song. I'll give this tape to my kid brother- he'll like it ...TKATZ) I like it. especially the Munsters theme (DON) THE ZULUS (Greenworld RecordsJFormer members of Boston's Human Sexual Response get together and form the Zulus, A bit more refinecf .

Putting the poor visuals + sound aside great packaging + booklet guys. Great concept of recording the tour + five shows unfortunately the audience enjoyed the shows more than I the video - recommended for hardcore 7 Seconds fans.- JILL BUTTHOLE SURFERS 'Blind Eye Sees All' VIDEO (Touch & GO POB 433 Dearborn, Ml 48121) Good sound quality, professional job on visual aspect entertaining Video w/ live footage + so called interviews in bed. Singer is an goes off on tangents, se in the band talks, a qreat video.- JILL BONES BRltiRADE Videos 1 + FUTURE PRIMITIVE (Bones Brigade II) These two videos arethe state of the art in skate videos, nothing amuseing story teller but go My complaint is no one else other wise a qreat video.- JIL else even comes close. The first video, when I first saw blew me away at what was possible. These guys obviously have the best skaters in freestyle + vertical (pools + ramp). Tony Hawk defys description. This video is worth it just to see him do a three foot, no hands backside air. then there's Rodney Mullen who to really appreciate, you have to see him in slow motion. Lance Mountain is a very natural showman and red hot skater and show great variety and a great ramp. Then when you think you've seen everything put in the Second Bones video, and hold yourself down. It opens with someone doing a gymnost plant (Handplant with your feet straight up and the board to your side and then Tony Hawk does a 720° spin, if this doesn't take your breath away, you're already dead. Later in the video we see a more muscular Rodney Mullen, once again setting standards in freestyle, with tricks I coulcf not even begin to name. He also powers into a flatland handplant which is most impressive. They also have a slowmotion section which is amazinr and even a eat it section, I would have like' to see Mark Gonzales, but then He doesn't ride for Powell Peralta does he. There is also some great flat wall, not transition riding, which is most impressive. The final word is buy these videos and watch over £ over until Part III comes out.-Sick Boy THE VISION SKATE CONTEST SERIES Basiclv cover contests of the past year and for the most are kinda boring. Except for Christian Hosoi + Jeff Phillips + Mark Gonzales, the only exceptional skating is done by Powell Peralta Skaters . A must only if you like seeing all skating Bad + Good.

The was askin. Why people like American Chip and Tony Kinman first made themselves known to inquiring ears as the Dils. pioneers o? revolutionary music and one of the most political. contreversial. irritating, and ultimately influencial bands to emerge from the early punk era. Eventually, fed up witn the West Coast scene and seeking a new sound with which to offend audiences, they fled for Austin and founded RanK and File, and in doing so laid down the groundwork for the legions of new country bands that exist today. In person, the Kinmans are about nine feet tall [each]; one is dark and serious, and one is blond and flippant. The interview was done at Cantor's Deli in Hollywood by Martha Rose O'Meara Me: I did a Fall interview, but you said that all English bands suck, so you wouldn't like them. Chip: (Embarassed giggle] Wait a minute, when did I say this? Me: That one you did in An-Aesthetic magazine. Well, if I said it. it must be true. Me: Really, what do you listen to then? Chip: I really listen to Ratt. Motley Crue. and Aerosmith. Me: Well. I know people who like them that listen to you. Chip: Yeah. well. I don't think that's out of the question. You can like them and listen to us. Did I really do English people bands so much,\" and you go, \"I imagine that's because all tne English bands suck.\" Tony: Sounds like a Chip thing to say. Me: I thought it was a little sweeping. Chip: Yean, but this is rock 'n roll. You're supposed to make statements like that. Some people have built their career on statements like that. I don't like English roots music. Tony: Their roots suck! Me: But that's where American roots music comes from—that's the roots of American roots. Tony: No. American music came from all that stuff smashing into black music. It was the black music that made it exciting. Chip: You remove the black part of it, then you get English folk music. [The subject was dropped by mutual consent.] Me:You were talking in that interview about country music being a fad in England. or among London tredmongers... Yeah, they have been listening to country for a long time. In England there's always been a large country music audience. They're not rocx 'n' rollers. They're people that rock 'n' rollers hate. Me:Claughs] Well, that's true over here, too. y: Well, when you find trendy English people going [British accentj \"I love country music.\" they don't know what they're talking about. ...Will They'll have listened to Hank Williams, maybe Lefty Frizell or another fairly established legend, but they won't listen to what's happened in country music for the last twenty years. You see people going. \"On yeah, I like Hank Williams. and that's like, if you like rock 'n' roll and somebody goes \"Oh. I really like the Beatles.\" You're going, now wait a second, a lot has happened since then. Me:Well, isn't that a good place for people to start? Tony: Yeah, but ususally they never get over starting. They always like Hank Williams and they're never gonna listen to anything else. Chip: It's a hip thing, but, by the time this interview comes out. it might not be. you know. Things come and go real quick. I remember, we were in England two years ago and I was walking down King's Road. I had cowboy boots, a fringed jacket, a cowboy hat, 501's. and a plaid shirt. People were looking at me like I was from mars. I mean, it was just amazing. And these were people with purple mohawks and shit. I understand now. ^ou go down there, well, look at \"Mick Jones' new band or any of these cretins. /S»v »/ m rn rrr m ■ Rank 'N File Rank *N File Rank 'N File Rank 'N File Rank ‘N File Rank 'N File Rank *N File Rank 'N File Is Dlls Dlls Dlls _ . M+J JJT amounts oF bullshit. I mean. the □ i Is sell out. they play the Civic for ten bucks, now wait a minute, you know. So we got a lot of that stuff. So it got kind of bad. Me: And then, when you started changing your music, did that get worse? Tony: No, People didn't care any more about it. If you liked punR rock, you liked your own little hard¬ core ghetto stuff, you didn't pay attention to bands like Rank 'n File. People who wanted to hear Class War or something like that, they came around for one or two shows. But after they understood that we weren't going to be playing that song, they stopped coming around. They had nothing to do with us. We did'nt even enter the picture. ^ Me: You still get some Dils fans, £ you still get a few. Tony: Yeah, well see, the thing £ about the Dils is that alot of the L people that sit around and talk about £ the Dils now didn't go see us back t then, didn't want to know about w it. didn't care! The Weirdos drew j* five times as many people than we did. We were not a popular band, we were an unpopular band, people did not like the Dils. Chip: Brutally honest. Me: Some of 'em. well like the 1 Screaming Sirens, and that kind P of thing, is considered cool. ^ Tony: Oh Yeah. Well a lot of people. . I mean their musical horizons do L expand, but you can't listen to a s pretty steady diet of that stuff £ all the time. I don't think so. £ Chip: Hardcore? Tony: Yeah. Maybe you can when k you're fourteen and you're adolescent. and you've got those kind of juices going, but it starts to get pretty thin after a while. Especially when ; it's done as poorly as most bands 1 do it. Chip: There dosen't seem to be a ' whole lot of variety out there, in the punk rock scheme of things. I may be wrong. I don't know. Me: But a lot of people claim to s have been influenced by the Dils. j, I think that's one reason why a band { like the Dils. our influence might have been bigger that the actual > impact at the time, because it is l a Rind of a set little thing you can. look at and go, that was right on. i you know. Especially now. when > you don't see those Flipside articles k and stuff, where people were really r railing against us. I mean, we were N the enemy! We were the enemy! Chip: What was amazing in San * Francisco, there was only one place > to play. Now. I've heard this story J tola a lot of times.and no one ever told the right story. There was only fc one place to play, and that was > the Mabuhay. And somebody. I don't remember who. had the bright idea s of putting on a show at what was * the Gay Community Center. And us. the Dils. The Avengers and the ^ Nuns wanted to do it. And we said. > \"Sure, we'll do this show, it sounds good.\" Dirk Dirkson . who ran the Mabuhay. immediately came back to us and said. \" You can't do it. any band that plays any place but % the Mabuhay will never play the > Mabuhay again. \"And there was ^ no way he could keep the Avengers. > the Nuns, and the Dils. so we just * said \"Okay, fuck you. we won't k play the Mabuhay again.\" 'Cause J these were like the top three bands ^ at the time. And in tne meantime, we would get calls and stuff, and Jello would stop us on the street or at clubs and be goin'.\"You're breaking up the scene. you're destroying the scene, how come you're takin' it to another club\", you know. \"You can't do that, we ot to keep it in the Mabuhay\" and r At-y /-rf srr /-ry /tf & rrr TUT Dils Dils Dils Dils Dils theyre all wearing cowboy gear. I think the Long Ryders had a lot to do with popularizing that in England, 'cause they were there ’ at the right time with the right \\ sound. 1 Me: So. do you have a lot of friends from the real old days? Tony: Yeah, we see a lot of friends when we come into cities, like Vancouver. San Francisco. L.A.. back East... Me: Any friends that were in bands then? Tony: Up in San Francisco, we see people who were in bands. Chip: Yeah, we see D.O.A. whenever they're around, they're our pals. Folks like that. If they're around we see them. We don't do too much socializing. I suppose. But. many of those people, we just don't see 'em—different circles. It's eight years ago. You know everyone's got their lives and 1 stuff, 'cept us. Me: It seems that some people have really glorified that as a peak in their lives, and other people just turn their backs on punk completely, and it's really hard for people to hit a balance. Tony: I think it's mostly those \"old punks\" who glorify that peak in their lives who never did anything after it. Me: The peak of civilization—the Masque in 1978. Tony: It's like being a big athlete in nigh school and your managing a gas station when you're 22. Me: The opposite are people that just turn their backs on punk completely and are really conservative now. Chip: I like to think we've found a middle around. I mean. I'm into the Dils. T thought the Dils were cool. In fact. I just got a live tape which is pretty bitchin'. I'd forgotten some of those songs. A couple of 'em are way'77 [Imitates a punk rock guitar riff). That's pretty exciting. Me: So. are you still as political as you were then? ; Tony: Yeah, more political. Me: Your view's haven't changed at all? Chip: I think it's more effective if you come in and do something different, and everyone's enriched by it. There's gonna be a certain amount of people that's gonna think it's a bunch of shit, no doubt. I'm sure there's gonna be some people that come to see us. and when we don't play \"Glad I'm Not in Love\" or something. they're gonna get all upset, but that's alright. I don't care. Plus, it's exciting for us to do something different. I would hate to have to go out on stage and play \"I Went Walking.\" Me: I heard a Dils story the other day and I was wondering if it were true. Somebody told me that you guys kicked Zippy Pinheard out of the band because he was working in a supermarket and there was a strike and he crossed the picket line. Tony: No. Actually, if you want to know the true story. Zippy Pinhead i r m mr rnrnrT^fcJCtt^al Ink ' N File] Ink ,1 Ink L r-i Ink ’N F] link Ink ‘N FiU was the only drummer we ever ha that quit the Dils. I don't think Zippy ever nad a job! There's all kind of Dils stories that aren't true. We had quite a reputation. Me: For what? Chip: Oh. there was this thing going around that we were a big anti band, you know, anti this, anti drugs, anti all this stuff. There was this thing that they thought we were anti sex. and that our manager had his balls cut off. or something like that. This is 'cause we do interviews for magazines like Flipside and stuff. Me: What happened the last time you were interviewed? Chip: We just called a lot of people old. and in the way. and called a bunch of people boring, pretty much. 'Cause back in those days you could say what was on your mind, or I thought you could. That was part of punk rock, that you could say that sort of stuff. Honesty, and breaking down the old barriers, and all. Me: And what happened with the interview? How'd it come out? Chip: Well. I thought it came out fine, but everyone hated us after that. So it just got kind of nasty at that point. Me: Yeah, how nasty did it get? Chip: How nasty? Well, magazines like Slash and Flipside and lesser punk rock magazines would watch every move we did to see where we would fuck up. then they'd write editorials about it,and talk about just how horrible the Dils were be¬ cause they're selling out the revolution and theyVe trying to destroy the scene. I mean. Full on editorials, you know, about how fucked we were. See. in the early days. I mean people honesty did think, I don't think punk rock bands believe this anymore, but they honestly did. in the mid seventies, late seventies, all the bands that came up thought that we were going to change some¬ thing. other than fashion. Thought that there was going to be an actual change in rock 'n roll. Rock 'n roll big business was percieved as the enemy. And bands like the Dils, we tried to do things differently, tried to keep door prices down, stuff like that. Tried to make sure things were fair. You know, like just on a very superficial level, like all bands are treated equal. Now. I don't think that matters for shit, to tell you the truth. I mean how bands are treated, from band to band. And the people would watch us. like we did a show with the Clash where the Clash charged ten bucks to get in and at the same time [it was in like *78 I think) at the ten dollars was like an outrageous amount to pay for a show, especially a band like the Clash, you know. But the Clash didn't get shit for it, the Dils did. 'Cause we opened the show. Me: In '79? Here? The Civic ... Chip: In Santa Monica, yeah, was that 79? Me: I saw that one. [Actually in February '79. and the price was $7.50) Chip: Yeah, And we got enormous « our reply was. of course. Fuck off\" And that was the attitude at 3 the time, that they didn't want it J to get bigger, they wanted to keep B it to themselves, 'cause it was everyone's own little thing, you know ... Me: Well, they didn't succeed. I Chip: No. they didn't. Me: I was surprised to find out in that interview that \"Sound of the Rain\" was a Dils song, 'cause it ) doesn't sound like it. Tony: \"Tell her I love Her\" was a Dils song. a Me: Really? Any others? I Tony: None that we do right now. * Me: But they were later Dills songs. Chip: \"Sound of the Rain\" was written right after that Flipside interview, and all that stuff came out. You know, when the shit started hitting the fan, 'cause our drummer came over to my house and he was going. , \"Oh god. why'd you say that stuff. 5 everyone's mad at us\". And it really * made me angry, and I said, that's punk rock. Thars what it's all about, j 'And then when he left I kinda wrote 3 that song \"Sound of the Rain\" as being like, one of those \"Funk You\" * songs, you know, say what you want J to say and believe in it. and it doesn't * matter what else happens about ) you. As long as you do what you think's right, follow you instincts and do what you believe, that's all I you can do. Me: But are you ever sorry that you changed the lyrics on that album? i Chip: No. because that didn't change i the meaning of the song at all. Bob “ Biggs said. \"Would you change this J line in the song.?\" We said. yeah, sure. I mean I don't give a shit. I mean, we were told that if we changed 3 this line, 'cause the line was pretty severe, you know, it's a pretty servre line, and they said. well, we'll have J e better chance of getting it on the radio. And I remember saying at the time, I said,\"Well, listen, you promise me that you're gonna J like work this and get it on the radio. and we'll change the line.\" And ■then I was told. \"Well, we can't 1 promise that.\" So I said, \"We\"ll change it\", you know. And of course they printed up like 500 singles and there yo go! They didn't do ( anything, and it makes for a good interview question, and that's about it. Yeah. I mean, changing that I line, that doesn't make any difference to me. We changed a line in \"Amanda l Ruth\". Me: Really. I Chip: Yeah, the Everly Brothers recorded it. Tony: They didn't want to sing the song about reggae because... J Me: I was wondering about that. , I was wondering how much they would listen to reggae... Tony: It's 'cause they don't listen to reggae. They said, can you change it. and I said sure, and I wrote them a whole new one. And I can understand that. Chip: Yeah, well plus, the Everlys go for a crossover sound too. JTony: The ting about \"Sound of the 4 Rain\". I think too. that line refined the thought and made it more pointed. I don't think it diluted the feeling of it any more. Me: [Dubiously] Yeah... I Tony: I think it sharpened it. 'Cause, see. I don't wish that all cops were dead. But I do think that cops that like beat people up and shoot at people. I don't want to listen to them. I think they are assholes, you know. Me: Oh. I don't think anybody should be dead. But when you guys do the original lyrics, it just sounds better. (Chip laughs] Tony: I agree that phonically and sonicallv it works better. Chip: He's a Mountie! He's like the u _j -g iy *--/ yu# MJ ±4 ^ ^ headof the Mounties of ms territory, and we were stayin' at his house for about a month, when we were recording that single, livin' under Sergeant Nick's roof. And after we recorded it. they would want to hear it. him and his wife Mrs. Penhead would want to hear it. And every time that line came up. about how I wish the cops were dead, 'cause that's one cop that I don't wish he was dead, you know. I'd like cough, or talk over it. or we'd try to get their attention away from it. And he didn't say a word. Well he did at the end, when we were leaving, after staying at his house for a month, ana eating his food, and enjoyin' their hospitality, he said. right when we were leaving,\"Boys. I really like the recording you did. Just next time, try to say something nice about the police/ And. now. put yourself in his shoes. If you had some people in your house for a month, eatin' your food, watching your TV. layin' around on your couch, and they're recording a song sayin' \"I wish all § irls with red hair were dead\", you'd e pissed off! And I though that was a pretty big of him. not to like smash our faces in. Bunch of booger-eatin' punks, you know saying something like that. Tony: Well plus I think that nowadays it's impotant to move beyound those blanket sentiments ...? Me: Like \"All English bands suck\"? Both: Yeah Me: Do you think the reasons that Rank'n File has been influencial are similar to the reasons that the Dils were influencial? Tony: I'll tell you why we're influen¬ cial. Chip: You tell me. Tony: We're brave, we're not afraid to ao stuff, most people are. They're deatly afraid to do anything different. We're never afraid to do anything different. Besides usually what we do is pretty good. So it usually creates something that's better than what was before, or at least just as interesting. Most people will wait for a band like the Dils or Rank n' File to do it first, and then they'll follow in. You know, back before hardcore hap. when it was basically mid 70s style *■ punk rock, you had people sayin' £ the Dils suck because they're political, ** Music should be fun. it shouldn't ^ be about politics. Well, it took ^ a band like the Dils to say. \"Yeah. £ we're a seriou band, we basically believe in what we're singin'. we don't take ourselves seriously, but what we sing about we take seriously.\" And so then, many umpteen years later, you have hardcore bands doin' interviews all about Reagan and Central America. and stuff like that, and now they're serious. And now the whole thing is taken really seriously. And it's just like the country thing, when everybody else was talkin' about how stupid country music was. country music was the last thing to like. If you wore a cowboy nat you were a redneck* you know. And than we decided to say. \"Yeah, we play country music, it's fun. it's cool/ Up in San Fran¬ cisco. KUSF Wave, tneir magazine, did the first review that Rank'n File ever got. live review, they said we sucked, and then they said. \"What are these guys trying to do. start a trend?\" Well that's the way it worked out. but only because we were brave enough and smart enough to do it first. And that's how you get to be influencial. if you're brave enough to do something different, and if you're smart enough to do it right. Otherwise you're just another dumb-ass band.

These sultry amazons roam the clubs and gutters of L.A., creating havoc and a lotta noise. When things get too hot they careen across Amer¬ ica, breaking hearts and causing terminal wet dreams for thousands of simple country boys. Many of these shattered youth, hoping for one more glimpse of those buckskinned thighs, one more note from thosr heavenly voices, leave their nest; and head for Hollywood. Their night ire spent at the seedy dives where the Sirens play, their days scroungin' a living as male prostitutes or movii extras. Youth of America, beware!!! They have, however, made severa appealing recordings: \"Ugly and Slouchy\". on 'The Sound of Hollywood Girls' [Mystic Comp.], \"Black £ White Thunderbird\" on 'All Your Party' (Martian Comp.], \"Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad\" G \"The Running Kind\" on 'Hell Comes To Your House 1 (Enigma corrip.].

Pleasant: I just wanted to have £ really wild all-girl band that wa< like a gang or something. And Boon- Boom was the only drummer I coulc think of so even though we hatec each other I wound up calling her anyway. We had all the same idea* about bands and life and drinkinc and everything.

Pleasant: These guys in Sacramento were all dressed up like Mexican bandits and Indians and they were skateboarding around.
