        "text": "Time for some of my annual Christmas postings... and my first selection for this year is a doozy!\n\nAs mentioned in a previous post, the television program The Brady Bunch premiered on ABC in the fall of 1969. The show was extremely popular with kids in its first couple of seasons, but that popularity wasn't reflected in the overall Nielsen TV ratings, which ranked The Brady Bunch somewhere near the middle (at best) to the back of the pack. Still, the network and the producers wanted to further capitalize on the program's pre-teen popularity, and early in the second season, someone came up with the inspired idea of releasing an album full of Christmas standards sung by the kids as something that might appeal with their target audience.\n\nIt goes without saying that this recording was not exactly a labor of love by anyone involved... The kids (Barry Williams (\"Greg\"), Maureen McCormick (\"Marcia\"), Christopher Knight (\"Peter\"), Eve Plumb (\"Jan\"), Mike Lookinland (\"Bobby\") and Susan Olsen (\"Cindy\")) weren't particularly enthused about doing it - except for perhaps McCormick, who had some limited vocal experience, the rest of them had little if any significant singing talent to exploit. Facing this fact and the relative brevity of time allotted to cut this disc, the production staff were even less happy to be involved in this project (album producer Tim O’Brien, who was also Paramount’s house producer, was later quoted as lamenting trying to pull something listenable from “six little kids who could not sing”). And network management could have cared less about the resulting quality of the finished product - they just wanted something related to their semi-hit show out before the holidays. In that atmosphere, production commenced in mid-October, 1970.\n\nRecorded in less than two weeks, the album mixed group sing-alongs with solo performances on classic holiday standards (“We finished our vocals in one afternoon, and then listened intently as the audio engineers used every gimmick, trick and echo chamber in the book to get us at least up to ‘listenable’ status,” recalled Barry Williams). None of the tracks are especially memorable; frankly, most of them are jaw-droppingly horrible renditions that soon segue into the realm of \"Oh my God!\" hilarity. A prime example of this is their version of \"O Holy Night\", which I only recently listened to for the first time in years. The song starts off semi-tolerable, until it reaches the chorus... at which point I burst out in incredulous laughter at its stunning awfulness. The label had the cojones to actually release a single from this album, Susan Olsen's lisping rendition of \"Frosty The Snowman\" - there wouldn't be another.\n\nIt's not like there weren't any decent Christmas numbers to pull from the show; mother Carol Brady (Florence Henderson) laid down a beautiful performance of “O Come All Ye Faithful,” featured in the series’ only Christmas episode, that for some reason was not among the selections (I guess they just wanted to focus on the kids - bad decision).\n\nAll in all, this record, in my opinion, has all the hallmarks of a recording of an amateur holiday pageant from some elementary school in the Midwest - good enough for parents and attendees to have a memory of their child warbling off-key Christmas songs, but nowhere near good enough to actually release for purchase.\n\nOne of the other weird things about this album is that the kids recorded it \"in character\". As shown below, some of the songs say \"lead vocal by Bobby Brady, Jan Brady\", etc., not by the actors' names.\n\nThis thing was pushed out the door so fast, they obviously didn't spend a lot of time on spell checking or proper song annotation - \"Marcia Brady's\" name is spelled \"Marsha\" here; and some of the lead vocals are credited to the incorrect child.\n\nThese are the correct lead vocals for this disc:\n\n1) The First Noel - Mike\n\n2) Away in a Manger - Maureen\n\n3) The Little Drummer Boy - all 6 kids\n\n4) O Come All Ye Faithful - Eve\n\n5) O Holy Night - Maureen & Barry\n\n6) Silent Night - all 6 kids\n\n7) Jingle Bells - all 6 kids\n\n8) Frosty the Snowman - Susan\n\n9) Silver Bells - all 6 kids\n\n10) Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer - all 6 kids\n\n11) Santa Claus is Coming to Town - Barry\n\n12) We Wish You a Merry Christmas - all 6 kids\n\nNot exactly the mark of a quality production.\n\nAnyway, for good or ill for you this holiday season, here you are: The Brady Bunch Kids' debut album, Merry Christmas From The Brady Bunch, released by Paramount Records on November 2nd, 1970, and rereleased on CD (and renamed Christmas With The Brady Bunch) by MCA Records in 1995. Get ready...\n\nWhatever your reaction, as always, let me know what you think.\n\nPlease use the email link below to contact me, and I will reply with the download link(s) ASAP:\n\nSend Email\n\nWith October 31st just around the corner, and longtime horror hostess Elvira (or more specifically Cassandra Peterson, the actress who plays Elvira) in the news recently due to the revelations in her recently published autobiographyYours Cruelly, Elvira: Memoirs of the Mistress of the Dark, I thought I might post a couple of her Halloween-related compilations.\n\nThe first Elvira music compilation came out in 1983, a couple of years after Peterson auditioned for and won the job of presenter for a revival of a popular Los Angeles-area weekend horror show featuring old scary movies called Fright Night. The program (renamed Elvira's Movie Macabre) featured her now-iconic character Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark, a saucy, sarcastic, 'Valley Girl'-type tricked out in heavily-applied horror-film makeup, a huge black beehive wig and a tight-fitting, low-cut black gown which displayed Peterson's ample chest. Elvira not only introduced the decidedly Grade-B, -C and -Z films, she would often interrupt the flicks during the program to poke fun of their overall crappiness, in addition to making racy double entendres and jokes about her boobs. She quickly gained notoriety and popularity in the region, and parlayed that success to appearances on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show and other programs (like CHiPs and The Fall Guy) which brought her nationwide fame.\n\nHer first release, Elvira Presents Vinyl Macabre - Oldies But Ghoulies (Vol. 1), was a quickie collection of Halloween/horror-related rock and pop hits and standards by the likes of Bobby \"Boris\" Pickett and Sheb Wooley, slapped together by Rhino Records in the early years of that label's existence. As such, Peterson/Elvira had little to do with or on the album, other than record a couple of intros/outros and appear on the cover in all her glory. Despite its relative generic October music presentation, today this disc commands high prices, probably because the record was never rereleased on cassette or CD.\n\nThe follow-up to this initial release was Elvira Presents Haunted Hits, put out in 1988. Actually, in some ways, this album serves as sort-of rerelease of Vinyl Macabre, as it reprises a number of songs that were on the first compilation (like \"Monster Mash\", \"Purple People Eater\" and \"Haunted House\"), while adding a substantial number of other holiday-related tunes, some rather popular and renowned. In case you're interested, here's the lineup:\n\nMonster Mash - Bobby 'Boris' Pickett & The Crypt-Kickers\n\nHaunted House - Jumpin' Gene Simmons\n\nGhostbusters - Ray Parker Jr.\n\nOut OF Limits - The Marketts\n\nThe Blob - The Five Blobs\n\nThe Creature From The Black Lagoon - Dave Edmunds\n\nThe Purple People Eater - Sheb Wooley\n\nThe Addams Family (Main Title) - Victor Mizzy\n\nTwilight Zone - Neil Norman & His Cosmic Orchestra\n\nWelcome To My Nightmare - Alice Cooper\n\nEnd Of Side One - Elvira\n\nBeginning Of Side Two - Elvira\n\nHalloween Spooks - Lambert, Hendricks & Ross\n\nDead Man's Party - Oingo Boingo\n\nLittle Demon - Screamin' Jay Hawkins\n\nHorror Movie - The Skyhooks\n\nI Put A Spell On You - Screamin' Jay Hawkins\n\nKing Kong - Big T. Tyler\n\nAttack OF The 50-Foot Woman - The Tubes\n\nI Was A Teenage Werewolf - The Cramps\n\nVoodoo Voodoo - LaVern Baker\n\nThe Creature (From Outer Space) - The Jayhawks\n\nFull Moon - Elvira\n\nMartian Hop - The Ran-Dells\n\nAttack Of The Killer Tomatoes - Lee Lewis\n\nElvira's Outro - Elvira\n\nElvira was a little more involved on this album; in addition to her commentary, she's even provided a full song to sing, \"Full Moon\" - a lightweight, synth-poppy confection that doesn't hold up well next to the other classics included here. But all in all, in my opinion, this is probably the best of the compilations released under her name, due to the breadth, scope and volume of fun Halloween music offered here. It was a bestseller for the label when it was released, and remains a perennially popular disc.\n\nBut the success of the ...Haunted Hits album seemed to lead to some unfortunate decisions/choices for the next Elvira compilation, Elvira Presents Monster Hits, released six years later. It appears that someone (either Peterson herself or the producers) believed that the big selling point for the earlier set was the increase in Elvira's voice and presence. So for this new one, the decision was made to ratchet up the \"Elvira factor\" - more than one-third of this short (28 minute long) album is centered on her. This includes two original songs, \"Monsta' Rap\" and \"Here Comes The Bride (The Bride Of Frankenstein)\" - both generally bland, worthless songs that do little more than take up space that could have been better utilized by including more classic and well-known Halloween songs. The track list for this brief release is as follows:\n\nIntroduction - Elvira\n\nMonsta' Rap - Elvira\n\nLittle Demon - Screamin' Jay Hawkins\n\nFeed My Frankenstein - Alice Cooper\n\nMonster Mash - Bobby 'Boris' Pickett\n\nNightmare On My Street - DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince\n\nThe Addams Family - Joey Gaynor\n\nHere Comes The Bride (The Bride Of Frankenstein) - Elvira\n\nOutro - Elvira\n\nAlso note that this comp includes several repeats from Elvira's previous releases, making the existence of this one somewhat redundant.\n\nIn years to come, Rhino would release a couple more Halloween compilations under Elvira's name, all to gradually diminishing returns: Revenge Of The Monster Hits in 1995 and Elvira's Gravest Hits (an 'best of' (*eye roll*) album devoted almost solely to tunes crooned by her) in 2010, along with Heavy Metal Halloween in 2009. But these have done little to decrease the fame of Peterson's signature character; Elvira remains popular and active to this day.\n\nAnyway, here for your spook-tacular pleasure are two discs to make your haunted holiday complete:\n\nElvira Presents Haunted Hits, released in 1988; and\n\nElvira Presents Monster Hits, released in 1994\n\nBoth were put out by Rhino Records.\n\nEnjoy, and have a wonderful, safe and happy Halloween!

We lost a GIANT today, ladies and gentlemen, and an inspiration to rock drummers everywhere. The consummate, detached, sardonic professional and perfectionist, who grounded The Rolling Stones with his steady, yet innovative beats for nearly sixty years.\n\nI've been going through the multitude of remembrances, eulogies and tributes to Mr. Watts all afternoon since I heard the news. Of all of them, I feel that Rob Sheffield captured the manner, spirit and essence of him the best, in the article filed earlier today in Rolling Stone magazine. Honestly, what more need be said?\n\nIn honor of the late drummer, I'm offering up for your enjoyment not a Rolling Stones album or rarity, but the loose and rollicking jam session members of the band recorded with two longtime friends and session players (pianist Nicky Hopkins and guitarist Ry Cooder) one night in the spring of 1969, while The Stones were in the middle of recording tracks with producer Glyn Johns for their upcoming album Let It Bleed. The quintet shambled and shuffled through a few loose bluesy originals (penned by Watts, Cooder and Hopkins), along with a couple of blues covers they liked.\n\nIt was all a big goof, and at the time it was done, they had no intention whatsoever of releasing the songs. In the original liner notes, Mick Jagger describes the album as \"a nice piece of bullshit... which we cut one night in London, England while waiting for our guitar player to get out of bed. It was promptly forgotten (which may have been for the better) ...\" As such, it sat around in the vaults for years, until one day a bored Johns retrieved it. Johns said of the album: \"[It] was just a joke really, just a laugh. I recorded it and they played it, and then, I don't know how long later [ed. note: nearly three years, actually], we dug the tapes out, I mixed it and they stuck it out on an album. It didn't really warrant releasing really, but it was okay, a bit of fun, and there's some good playing on it.\" The disc charted briefly in America, eventually peaking at #33 on Billboard, but did nothing in the UK.\n\nTo this day, this release is generally reviled and disowned by Rolling Stones purists, who equate the recorded performances here to that of A Toot And A Snore In '74, a recording of a similarly loose (albeit drug-fueled) jam session by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Harry Nilsson and Stevie Wonder in Los Angeles in the spring of 1974. But I feel that comparison is unfair, and unwarranted. Despite its slapdash nature, there is some good playing on this disc, and at best it shows The Stones unadorned, belting out numbers like the bar band they started out as. All in all, it's definitely worth a listen.\n\nSo here it is for you all to do just that - Jamming With Edward! (\"Edward\" was Nicky Hopkins' nickname), recorded on the evening of April 23rd, 1969, and released on Rolling Stones Records on January 7th, 1972. Enjoy this in the spirit in which it is offered, in honor of the life and legacy of the sublime and now-immortal Charlie Watts. And as always, let me know what you think.\n\nPlease use the email link below to contact me, and I will reply with the download link(s) ASAP:\n\nSend Email\n\nR.I.P. to Isaac Donald (Don) Everly yesterday at the age of 84, the last surviving member of the Everly Brothers (Phil Everly died in 2014) - if not THE greatest, certainly the most influential rock 'n' roll duo of all time. The Everly's close harmonies were a major influence on rock greats like The Beach Boys, The Beatles, The Bee Gees, and especially Simon & Garfunkel. They hold the record for the most Top 100 U.S. singles by any duo, and trail only Hall & Oates as the duo with the most Top 40 hits. The Everly Brothers are recipients of the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, have a star dedicated to them on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and have been inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, the Musician's Hall of Fame (for Don's innovative rhythm guitar riff on their early hit \"Wake Up, Little Susie\"), the Country Music Hall of Fame, and of course the Rock Hall of Fame, where the group was included as part of the inaugural class of genre pioneers in 1986. Rolling Stone magazine ranked The Everly Brothers at #33 on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Artists Of All Time\".\n\n(I list all of these superlatives because, although it seems the duo are all but forgotten today, they were the real deal, and no joke.)\n\nWith their greatness basically pretty self-explanatory, I don't think I need to go into great length here with this posting on the background, whys and wherefores of The Everly Brothers. I'll just cut to the chase, and pony up the music...\n\nThe duo had their first breakout hits on Cadence Records in the late 1950s, finding massive and widespread success with classic songs like \"Bye Bye Love\" and \"Wake Up, Little Susie\" (both 1957), \"All I Have To Do Is Dream\" and \"Bird Dog\" (both 1958).\n\nAfter three years at Cadence, the Everlys signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1960 and stayed with the label for a decade. Their early years at Warners were their most successful, with their first label release, \"Cathy's Clown\", topping the charts and selling eight million copies. Other early '60s Top Ten hits included \"Walk Right Back\" and \"Crying In The Rain\". Although their star faded somewhat in America with the advent of the British Invasion, The Everly Brothers remained very popular and successful in the United Kingdom and Canada for the remainder of the decade.\n\nHere for your listening pleasure is the Everly Brothers compilation The Price Of Fame, covering the first five years (1960-1965) the group was at Warner Bros., and including not only every release from that period, but a number of alternate takes and outtake sessions. Every early huge label hit is here, along with re-recordings of some of their early Cadence music. This is a massive set... but I feel it's an essential one for fans of the Everlys and for rock fans in general.\n\nThe compilation was put out by the celebrated German label and reissue specialists Bear Family Records on January 31st, 2006. Since its a Bear Family release, you know it's going to be thorough!\n\nAnyway, enjoy, and let me know what you think. Thanks and farewell to you, Don - the choir in Rock 'n' Roll Heaven just got a little better. All the best to you and your brother, wherever you are.\n\nPlease use the email link below to contact me, and I will reply with the download link(s) ASAP:\n\nSend Email\n\n[I began putting this one together back in mid-2018... but discovered some problems with the discs that took a while to sort out, and by the time I did so, I'd moved on to other write-ups. Guess I'll finish this one up now...]\n\nI found this rarity available for download a couple of months ago [ed. note - early 2018], from an obscure music website, Kangnave (which appears to have been actively added to for a couple of years in the mid-2010s, but hasn't seen a new posting since 2015). Here's the description the blog moderator put up regarding this:\n\nThis is a pretty insane project put together by my pal Vince B. from San Francisco a few years back. As the title indicates, this is a homemade 12 x CD-R (!) compilation of punk bands fronted by female vocalists from 1977 to 1989. More like a giant mixtape than a compilation, as he only made 36 copies which he sent to friends and people who submitted material. You may notice that some of the bands didn’t have a steady female vocalist (The Lewd, etc.) but he still included songs that were sung by another member of the band. This is as international as it gets, with stuff ranging from world famous Blondie or Crass to the most obscure Eastern European cassette compilation veterans. The boxset came packaged in a handnumbered fancy translucent lunchbox enclosing all 12 CD-Rs, a stack of full-colored cards featuring comprehensive tracklist and artwork/info, as well as a manga pin-up figure! Talk about a labor of love.\n\nLike the guy above said, this is a pretty incredible worldwide collection of decent to excellent punk vocalized by women - here's the lineup for all twelve discs:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n1. Blutsturz – Schweigen (Demo) (Germany, 198?)\n\n2. Penetration – Money Talks (England, 1977)\n\n3. Pyhäkoulu – Painajainen (Finland, 1986)\n\n4. VulpeSS – Me Gusta Ser Una Zorra (Spain, 1983)\n\n5.

Perhaps a better name for this would have been A Reference of Female Voices in Punk Rock 1977-89... but maybe I'm just nitpicking. All in all, the selection here is superb...\n\nUnfortunately, the initial set of downloads burned from this blogger's copies were NOT superb. I had a heck of a lot of issues with some of the song files, especially in the last five or six discs - some files were incomplete, others hopelessly corrupted. So I made the time and took the extra effort to cull out the crap and find replacement files for some of these bands from other sources. Considering the level of obscurity of some of the tunes provided in this set, it goes without saying that it took a while for me to track everything down. But in the end, I think I did. So the set I'm offering here is a clean and uncorrupted as you're going to find out there for the time being.\n\nApparently, this set was featured on the Dangerous Minds website a few years ago - but still linked back to the Kangnave page, with its wonky files. Here for your listening pleasure is my repaired version of A Reference Of Female-Fronted Punk Rock 1977-89, a fan-compiled boot of twelve discs containing over 300 slices of quality punk and post-punk from the heyday of this music. Enjoy, and as always, let me know what you think.\n\nPlease use the email link below to contact me, and I will reply with the download link(s) ASAP:\n\nSend Email\n\n[I started this one way back in 2017, but for some reason never got around to finishing it. Here you go...]\n\nBack when I was a kid, my parents discouraged us from drinking much in the way of soft drinks. There was never that much soda in any of the houses where we lived, and that that was present was generally reserved for the grown-ups; the kids had to make do with things like milk, water, juice and occasionally Wyler's and/or (in some cases, stunningly culturally inappropriate) Funny Face fruit-flavored drink mixes. I suppose at the time it was just one of the ways and methods our folks used to watching out for our health and well-being - and being a parent now, I can sympathize with and relate to that attitude. But when I was a child, it felt like a heavy blow, as if we were being unfairly and arbitrarily deprived of something that other kids had ready access to.\n\nHowever, my grandmother (on my father's side) had no such compunctions; she always had a plentiful stock of stuff like RC Cola, 7-Up and Mr. Pibb readily at hand in big half-gallon (later two liter) bottles at her house, and during our visits there she would spoil us unmercifully with near-unlimited access to this carbonated nectar (\"unlimited\", that is, until my folks would inevitability step in and order us \"not to drink all of Grandmama's soda\"). I don't think my parents fully understood that that limited availability only served to make us children desire it more, and make it seem more \"special\".\n\nEven with all of that, once I got older and began living (and shopping) on my own, I can't say that I became a big pop drinker. To this day, my non-alcoholic beverages of choice continue to be water, milk and OJ (so I guess my parents did that right after all). I do keep cans of soda in the fridge, and have never prevented my own children from having them when they felt the desire. In doing so, I think I've kept them from equating soft drinks as special treats, as I once did, regarding them now as just another choice that they can take or leave. And I think that tactic has been successful; they are not big soda guzzlers either.\n\nI think that this info will not be regarded as good news by the big beverage bottlers - Keurig Dr. Pepper, PepsiCo, and the longtime industry giant, The Coca-Cola Company - all of whom have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising revenue promoting their products and exhorting us to drink more-More-MORE! These companies have gone to great lengths to convince/coerce the public to consume mass quantities, with some campaigns more memorable than others. Those of us of a certain age fondly recall this classic Dr. Pepper commercial:\n\nOr this memorable 7-Up commercial, featuring the talents and voice of the incomparable Geoffrey Holder:\n\nAnd this, probably the gold standard as far as soft drink commercials are concerned, the 1971 \"Hilltop\" ad for Coca-Cola, featuring a reworked version of the New Seekers' song \"I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing (In Perfect Harmony)\" - a song so popular that not one, but TWO versions of it, both made the U.S. Top Ten in 1972 and went Gold:\n\nCoca-Cola had long been the industry leaders in innovative, creative product promotion. The company began placing ads in national magazines as early as 1904, and by the end of that decade, their advertising budget exceeded $1 million per year, an extraordinary sum for that time.\n\nThe very design of the unique and world-famous Coca-Cola bottle in the 1910s was a deliberate choice to differentiate the brand from that of other cola competitors. Coke was one of the first brands to feature Santa Claus prominently in its print ads, beginning in the 1930s, an association that has remained to this day. And from the dawn of the 20th century, the firm made heavy use of celebrity endorsements, beginning with popular singer Hilda Clark in 1901.\n\nFor over fifty years, Coca-Cola engaged the services of the D’Arcy Advertising Company as its official ad agency, and the union was very successful. But in 1956, Coke ended its relationship with D’Arcy and transferred the company’s advertising account to McCann-Erickson, Inc. The aim was to more successfully utilize new media like television, areas that McCann-Erickson was more in touch and in tune with. The new agency proved its worth quickly with the first two Coca-Cola campaigns it managed in the 1950s – “The Sign of Good Taste” (1957) and “Be Really Refreshed” (1959). Pop performers from the period, such as the McGuire Sisters, The Brothers Four and Connie Francis were involved in these successful efforts (note that, at the time, Coke didn't appear to be very interested in utilizing rock 'n' roll stars and making inroads into the youth market... curious).\n\nThe next major McCann-Erickson campaign was “Things Go Better with Coke,” which began in 1963. For this campaign, there was an explosion in the number and quality of ads, and the number of top contemporary music stars involved, making up for that dearth in the earlier campaigns. As mentioned in Allmusic.com:\n\nDuring the 1960s, it wasn't unheard of for rock & roll groups and music performers to lend their voices to commercial jingles... But in the '60s, artists of surprisingly high stature were willing (and artists of surprisingly middling stature were asked) to lend their talents and skills to the cutting of product advertising jingles. Any act with lesser stature than The Beatles or The Rolling Stones was fair game to be approached by an advertising agency with some hope of success.\n\nMcCann-Erickson (backed by Coca-Cola's huge checkbook, I'm sure) convinced some huge stars of the period to record radio and/or television commercials under the “Things Go Better with Coke” campaign. These artists were asked to incorporate the “Things Go Better with Coke” slogan into a commercial-length song, which was generally inspired by one of their big hits (for example, Tom Jones’ Coke commercial uses the melody and arrangement of his signature tune “It’s Not Unusual”):\n\nAgain, from Allmusic.com:\n\nIt may seem monotonous -- most of the spots include the phrase \"Things Go Better With Coke\" -- but the variations are fascinating, and it is a chance to hear these acts having what can only be considered fun with their respective sounds. There is a kind of surreal fun to be found in these sounds -- many of the tracks run well over a minute and are done in each artist's straight style, whatever that might be. The second of three Roy Orbison numbers here, for example, is in his hardest rocking style of the mid- to late '60s, while the third blatantly imitates \"Oh, Pretty Woman.\" [Other] acts... completely absorb the Coca-Cola lyrics into their own respective sounds.\n\nActs who participated include the aforementioned Tom Jones and Roy Orbison, along with The Supremes, The Tremeloes, Jan & Dean, The Moody Blues, Boyce & Hart, Marvin Gaye, Gladys Knight & The Pips, Gary Lewis & The Playboys, The Easybeats, Ray Charles, The Box Tops, The Bee Gees, Aretha Franklin, and many, many more. All in all, the \"Things Go Better With Coke\" campaign, which ran until 1970, was a smashing success, and to this day the phrase is probably second only to \"It's The Real Thing\" in regards to a signature, recognizable brand slogan.\n\nInitially, there doesn't appear to have been any great interest in preserving these ads for posterity; I think both the company and the performers themselves considered them to be for commercial use and generally disposable. So the origin and sourcing of this album is pretty scanty and sketchy, to say the least. It appears that these songs were all but forgotten about for over twenty-five years, until someone at McCann-Erickson corporate headquarters pulled them all together in the mid-1990s as an in-house thing, commemorating and celebrating their innovative and successful 60's ad campaign. As such, it was initially produced in very limited quantities (only about 100 copies or so) - it was definitely not done by a studio. It probably would have remained an internal ad agency document if some enterprising and on-the-ball individual hadn't recognized its significance and historical value, nabbed a copy and began marketing it as a hard-to-find blank-label bootleg CD in the late 1990s. However, even that effort was short-lived; this album has been off the market now for close to twenty years and has become a difficult find on the Web, and/or an rare, high-priced purchase from sites like eBay.\n\nWith this being an unlicensed, unregulated bootleg, even its format and track listing vary from version to version, with different album covers (as shown here) and song listings. The original boot release listed a total of sixty-four cuts, but actually only included sixty-one, for some reason. I can't recall where or when I ended up acquiring my copy from, but it appears I hit the jackpot - my version of this compilation includes over ONE HUNDRED tracks, both short and long radio commercials done by dozens of artists. The quality throughout this comp is generally good to excellent, although the American material is slightly lower in fidelity for the most part (The Box Tops' tracks in particular reveal some surface noise, and seem to be the only tracks taken from sources other than tape). And the final song, \"Come Alive\", appears to have been appended on to my version as a joke, as \"Come Alive\" was the late-60's slogan for Coca-Cola's bitter (no pun intended) rival, Pepsi-Cola.\n\nAnyway, here for your listening pleasure is the hard-to-find but enjoyable bootleg compilation Things Go Better With Coke: Sixties Coca-Cola Commercials 1965-69, original release date unknown. Have a listen to these short but interesting and classic blasts of '60s radio ephemera, and as always, let me know what you think.\n\n(...and, if I may, might I suggest you enjoy this auditory experience while imbibing the thirst-quenching soft drink of your choice; I won't make any recommendations - I'm sure one brand in particular will somehow come to mind...)\n\nPlease use the email link below to contact me, and I will reply with the download link(s) ASAP:\n\nSend Email\n\nEarlier this morning, after nearly 300 posts spanning over eleven years, Pee-Pee Soaked Heckhole recorded its millionth visitor! It's been a long time coming!\n\nFor all of you who have managed to stick with me and the silly little blog of mine over the years, let me once again provide you with my most sincere thanks and appreciation. Thank you for your patronage, your suggestions, and most of all, your comments - it feels good to know and read that, in some cases, I've turned someone on to a new genre of music, or reunited them with a lost classic. My favorite comments to receive are those along the lines of \"I've been looking for this for years!\", or \"I never thought I'd hear this again!\" - I get that same kind of feeling and thrill whenever I manage to track down a hard-to-find tune I'm seeking; glad to know I can instill that in others. This site started off as a \"Can I possibly do this too?\" sort of lark, so even after all of the music I've provided and write-ups I've penned, it's still sort of crazy to me that THAT many people have found this obscure corner of the Web and have read at least a little of the meandering, verbose narrative I've cranked out month after month, year after year.\n\nIn honor of this Million Visitor Milestone, I thought I'd at least make an attempt to complete some of the dozens of half-written music write-ups I've had sitting in my queue but, for some reason or another, never finished (some have been in limbo for literally years). Over the next few days I'll do what I can to bear down at get a least a few of this publication-ready for you all. So keep an eye on the site, and keep on coming back!\n\nLooking forward to meeting and engaging with the next million visitors!\n\nAll the best to you all from Pee-Pee Soaked Heckhole\n\nHappy Birthday to famed musicians and identical twins Kim and Kelley Deal, who were born on this date in Dayton, Ohio sixty years ago today. In honor of this day, I thought I might as well post the rest of Kelley Deal's output I currently have in my possession.\n\nBoth of the twins got into music during their teen years in Ohio, working up songs in the home studio they built in their parents' basement, and playing folk- and country-laced originals and covers in and around the Dayton area (with Kim on guitar and Kelley on drums). This went on for a couple of years until the mid-1980s, when Kim got married and moved to Boston; Kelley stayed in Dayton and started working as a technical analyst. Kim found a job in the Massachusetts biochemical tech industry, and that was her main focus in life until one day in March 1986, she came across an unusual advertisement in the \"Musicians Wanted\" classified section of the old Boston Phoenix newspaper that read, \"Band seeks woman bassist into Hüsker Dü and Peter, Paul and Mary...\" On a whim, Kim answered the ad (she later found that she was the only person who did) and met locals Charles Thompson and Joey Santiago, old college roommates who were thinking about forming a band. The trio began jamming together, and that's how the band The Pixies were formed.\n\nEven with Kim on board, the rudimentary Pixies were still without a drummer. Kim contacted her sister Kelley back in Ohio, and subsequently paid for her to fly out to Boston to audition behind the kit for the band. Although both Thompson (soon to be known as Black Francis) and Santiago approved, Kelley wasn't confident enough in her drumming to join up, and opted to move back to Ohio. Kim then recommended another drumming acquaintance, David Lovering, a friend of her husband's she met at their wedding reception the year before. Lovering signed on, and the group was complete.\n\nIn a post I published a decade ago, I briefly provided an overview of the formation of The Breeders in 1989, the result of the dissatisfaction Kim Deal and Tanya Donelly were feeling regarding their roles in their then-current bands (Donelly was a member of Throwing Muses). Kim asked Kelley to join the new group and assist with the recording of their debut album Pod, but Kelley was unable to participate because she couldn't arrange to take enough time off of her analyst job. However, after Donelly left the group, Kelley quit her job and joined her sister's band in 1992, assuming the lead guitarist role (although at the beginning, she had NO IDEA how to play the instrument).\n\nMany moons ago, I related to you all the story of my initial encounters and brief long-distance semi-friendship with Kelley Deal during the mid-to-late 1990s. In that narrative, I related how she and The Breeders were riding on the crest of global commercial and critical success, in the midst of a triumphant world tour capitalizing on their hit album Last Splash. It seemed to me at the time that everything was going right for the band; little did I know how much turmoil was occurring behind the scenes, and how much things were getting out of hand for Kelley. Demons already long present in her life began to take over, exacerbated by the long hours of life on constant tour. Taken from a 2002 feature article on the group from The Guardian newspaper:\n\nThe Breeders spent several months during 1993 and 1994 touring, and it was during this period that Kelley's long-standing addiction to heroin stopped being a secret and started being a problem. When the band returned home, the Deals immediately started work on the follow-up to Last Splash, but in autumn 1994 Kelley was arrested for possession, and by the beginning of 1995 she was in rehab in Minnesota.\n\nAs I mentioned in that earlier post, Kelley got busted by the feds when she received a half-pound brick of Black Tar heroin from her dealer at her home address. The subsequent felony charges could have landed her in jail for an extended period. But her family pulled together to support her, and saved her from the slammer - not that she appreciated it at the time (also from The Guardian):\n\nKelley insists that her family drove her to the rehabilitation centre themselves, and that meant that when her case came to court, she wasn't convicted. \"I hated my family,\" she admits. \"They were all against me, they didn't understand me. I didn't think I had a problem.\"\n\nShe was ordered to report to the famed Hazelton rehab center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where she spent much of 1995 in a structured, isolated environment, getting treatment for her addiction. Kelley's time at the clinic also helped her find a up-to-then untapped wellspring of creativity and inspiration, and for the first time she began penning her own songs. At the completion of her program at Hazelton, Kelley was gradually eased back into society, moving into a halfway house in nearby St. Paul for further observation and treatment. While there, she met and befriended Jesse Colin Roff, a local guitarist and drummer also undergoing drug rehab, and (tentatively, at first) began sharing with him some of the songs that she wrote while at the center. Intrigued and inspired, the two began jamming together and collaborating, and Kelley began plotting a return to active recording.\n\nThe duo began gathering like-minded musicians, including David Shouse from The Grifters and Jimmy Flemion of The Frogs, and by early 1996 Kelley was confident enough in the abilities of herself and her band (christened The Kelley Deal 6000) to enter Minneapolis's Terrarium recording studio to work on a debut album. Go To The Sugar Altar was completed in a month, and issued in the late spring of 1996.\n\nGo To The Sugar Altar, to me, is the sound of a band, and a musician, finding their/her feet. The songs (all written either by Kelley herself or in conjunction with various band members) cover a number of genres: straight-ahead rock, some punky thrashing, a dollop of blues and even a dash of country thrown in from time to time. A lot of these songs sound somewhat like glorified demos... but that may be due to the nature of the circumstance, with Kelley producing and funding the project herself from whatever limited funds she had at her disposal. With that being said, most of the songs are winners, and Kelley's voice is a treat; it has the same familiar sound as that of her sister, but unlike Kim, who tends to bury her voice somewhat in her recordings, Kelley's is out front the entire time, and has an appealing tone and growl. Some of my favorite songs off of this album include \"Dammit\" and \"How About Hero\":\n\nComparing the Deal sisters' immediate post-Last Splash releases of the time [after The Breeders went on forced hiatus in the wake of Kelley's drug problems, Kim assembled what was originally intended to be a \"new Breeders\", but instead evolved into The Amps, and released a so-so album (Pacer) in late 1995], I feel that Go To The Sugar Altar is the truer follow-up/continuation of the hit Breeders sound.\n\nThe band's debut album met with decent reviews, and the group hit the road that summer for shows all across the U.S., drumming up support for the disc. I saw The Kelley Deal 6000 a couple of times that year, as I mentioned in my earlier post, and at every show took the opportunity to try to say \"hello\". During their tour, the label released the Canyon EP, containing the lead cut from the album along with the non-album track \"Get The Writing\". I picked up both over the course of that year.\n\nAfter their extensive tour, the group returned to Minneapolis in the spring of 1997 to record their sophomore album Boom! Boom! Boom! During these sessions, Kelley and Jesse Roff took a little time apart from the other band members to record a two-song side project, titled Carnivale, under the moniker Solid State 6000. This single didn't expand upon the sound ideas that ended up on the full band album, but serves as a superb companion piece.\n\nThese were the final releases by Kelley on her own. After the Boom! Boom! Boom! tour ended in early 1998, the group went on indefinite hiatus, and Kelley returned to the Breeders' fold, where she remains to this day.\n\nIt's been a quarter-century since the band's debut, and while they didn't last very long, The Kelley Deal 6000 and related projects shouldn't be relegated to just a long-ago memory, or regarded as a 'flash in the pan'. Kelley definitely had some things to say, and it is to her credit that, in the wake of all that was going wrong for her at the time, she was bold enough and adventurous enough to step out on her own and present to the public what was on her mind at the time. I enjoyed this group very much while it lasted, and miss heading out to see them in the small clubs they played around the country during that time. And on a personal note, it was an honor and a privilege to have Kelley as my friend, even for so brief a time.\n\nWith that being said, for your listening pleasure, here are:\n\nGo To The Sugar Altar, the debut album by The Kelley Deal 6000, released by Nice Records (Kelley's label) on June 4th, 1996;\n\nThe band's Canyon EP, released later that summer; and\n\nThe Carnivale single, released by Solid State 6000 on the same label in mid-1997.\n\nEnjoy, and as always, let me know what you think.\n\nPlease use the email link below to contact me, and I will reply with the download link(s) ASAP:\n\nThe Kelley Deal 6000 - Go To The Sugar Altar: Send Email\n\nThe Kelley Deal 6000 - Canyon EP: Send Email\n\nSolid State 6000 - Carnivale (single): Send Email\n\nI've posted a couple of B-52's entries in the past three years; here are some more hard-to-finds:\n\n\"Private Idaho\" b/w \"Party Out Of Bounds (Instrumental)\" - I mentioned in a post about a decade ago that when I purchased The Yellow Album in the fall of 1980, the first music I ever bought with my own money, I'd listen to it in the living room during off-hours, with my ear pressed against the speaker and the volume turned down low; my parents weren't into this crazy New Wave music at all! But that situation was rectified that Christmas, when my folks got my brother and I a small stereo set (with speakers, cassette player and turntable) to set up in the tiny room we shared in the La Mesa Navy housing complex in Monterey, CA.\n\nWoo-hoo! No more having to sneak around the house shamefacedly with my B-52s album, bracing myself for grownup derision, and/or admonitions to \"turn that noise down!\". And to show that there were no hard feelings, my parents also gave me a couple of 45s to play on own new rig. One was Devo's \"Whip It\" single (off of their then-latest album, Freedom Of Choice) b/w \"Turnaround\", a non-album B-side that quickly became (and still is) a favorite of mine.\n\nThe other disc my folks got for me was The B-52's \"Private Idaho\" single, off of their August 1980 Top 20 album release Wild Planet. The flip side of this record included an instrumental version of \"Party Out Of Bounds\", the lead track off of the same album. Both of these singles, plus the album I already owned, were in heavy rotation in me and my brother's bedroom for the next few weeks. That stereo system was the impetus I needed to begin acquiring more records by artists that I liked - like it or not, my parents inadvertently set me on the road to become a lifetime collector and appreciator of all types of music!\n\nAnd after all of these years, through dozens of records, scores of cassettes, hundreds of CDs and thousands of MP3s, and more household moves that I can count, I still have this record in my possession. I used to play it often on my turntable, before technology caught up and I was able to burn both sides to MP3. This disc was never released on CD, so the B-side instrumental is somewhat hard to find. Therefore, here it is for you.\n\n\"Give Me Back My Man\" b/w \"Give Me Back My Man (Instrumental)\" - As 1980 turned into 1981, with a new stereo in my possession, I was eager to expand my music collection, but really didn't know how to start. Although I had been working a good-paying after-school job in the kitchen at Santa Catalina private girls' school (just down the street from where I lived), I was initially hesitant about spending my hard-earned pay on full albums. So my early purchases, from both the music racks at the Navy Postgraduate School Exchange and the music store at Del Monte Mall (both within walking distance of my house), were vinyl singles.\n\nHere's one of the first I purchased that new year - another single (both the album track and instrumental version) from the Wild Planet album. I really like this song; I feel that \"Give Me Back My Man\" is one of the all-time highlights of Cindy Wilson's vocal career - you can really hear and feel the yearning heartache she conveys behind the somewhat silly words:\n\nAs good as the vocal version is, it's the instrumental version on the B-side that really grabbed me. I never get tired of hearing Ricky Wilson's innovative and creative guitar work showcased in this song's bridges - the guy was a frickin' MASTER! This particular song was the one that finally convinced me to loosen my purse strings and purchase the album... and I'm glad I did. However, I've always been somewhat disappointed that, outside of the vinyl single, the instrumental version of this song has never been released in any other format. Fortunately, with the time and the equipment, I took care of that!\n\nFun fact: Weird Al Yankovic completely stole the rhythm and melody (I believe he referred to it as a \"style parody) of \"Give Me Back My Man\" for his song \"Mr. Popeil\", on his 1984 sophomore release \"Weird Al\" Yankovic In 3-D, the same album that contained his smash single \"Eat It\". His appropriation of this B-52s song even included background vocalists that sounded a lot like Cindy Wilson and Kate Pierson:\n\nIf there is a fine line between tribute, parody and plagiarism, Weird Al came very close to obliterating it with this one. Whatever - water under the bridge at this point.\n\n\"Creature In A Black Bikini\" versions - When I first wrote about this B-52's rarity three years ago, the only thing I had to go on was a brief soundboard snippet apparently recorded during one of the band's 1985 practice/rehearsal sessions for Bouncing Off The Satellites. From that abbreviated clip, it was obvious that there was more to the song, perhaps many more minutes, but I figured I'd never have a hope in Hell of tracking the longer version down.\n\nHowever, about a year ago, I began hearing from a site visitor and rabid, knowledgeable French B-52's fan writing under the pseudonym \"Frank Reich\". Mr. Reich had the inside scoop on a TON of band information, which he kindly shared with me. For example, in my 2018 post, I speculated on what appeared to be a tentative track list for the full-blown Mesopotamia album, which was aborted and released in a 6-track EP format in early 1982. I had some thoughts and questions regarding demo tracks from that period, some of which were saved and developed for future albums, and some that had apparently never seen the light of day - included a conjectured \"Butterbean\" demo.\n\nMr. Reich set me straight on that account:\n\n\"...the band never recorded \"Butterbean\" during the late 1981 sessions... because of the tension accumulating in the studio ([such as] Byrne not telling the band he asked Kate to put vocals on an instrumental piece called \"Cloud 9\", which became \"Deep Sleep\"). In the end, there is no \"outtake\" version of \"Butterbean\" like there is with \"Queen Of Las Vegas\".\n\nSo, there you go. I got plenty of other great tidbits from him regarding Mesopotamia, including the following:\n\n\"[It was] Fred [Schneider who wrote, then] totally scrapped \"Adios Desconocidas' (and didn't ever want to talk about it again), and Warner Brothers almost asked the band to drop the song \"Mesopotamia\" out of the record...\n\n[Island Records head] Chris Blackwell asked David Byrne for his mixes (from various sources) that were then sent to Island Records... that's how the UK/European version of the EP sounds so different. Blackwell wanted to release and promote Mesopotamia as a dance/experimental funk record, something the band didn't know and never agreed to... In the end, European critics hated the record, fans were confused, and that's why that era of The B's (1981 - 1988) is not very famous (or known at all) in Europe. Talk about destroying a band's reputation...\n\nThe band ended up very frustrated with the EP, and to this day they still joke about 'finishing it', something they tried to do at various times throughout the '80s and '90s... that's why when you saw the band performing \"Big Bird\" during that '82 show, they were performing songs [according to] their original idea of what Mesopotamia could have been.\"\n\nMr. Reich was an absolute pleasure to correspond with, and as I mentioned above, a font of good band gouge. And at the end of our conversations, he provided me with two treasures: the full NINE MINUTE jam version of \"Creature In A Black Bikini\"... AND:\n\n\"I've also taken the liberty to include my own mix here, when I remastered the tape and overdubbed [it] with drum machine and keyboards in order to form a full 5 minute song.\"\n\nMr. Reich's efforts on this fully realized mix are incredible - it really sounds like something The B-52's themselves would have released during that era. It has the same sort of sound qualities and beats that were heard in band releases from that time like Whammy! and Bouncing Off The Satellites. It is a song fully worth devoting multiple listens to (and I have!).\n\nSo here you all are, for your repeated listening pleasure as well:\n\n\"Private Idaho\" b/w \"Party Out Of Bounds (Instrumental)\", recorded by producer Rhett Davies at Compass Point Studios, Nassau, Bahamas in April 1980, and released on Warner Bros. Records in October 1980;\n\n\"Give Me Back My Man\" b/w \"Give Me Back My Man (Instrumental)\", also recorded at Compass Point Studios in April 1980 and released on the same label as above in November 1980;\n\n\"Creature In A Black Bikini\", the full 9-minute jam session outtake from the Bouncing Off The Satellites sessions, recorded in Philadelphia in the spring/summer of 1985 but never released; and\n\n\"Creature In A Black Bikini (Frank Reich Mix)\", a fan-created re-imagining of what a fully realized and produced version of this song would have been.\n\nMore B-52's stuff is ALWAYS good in my book!
