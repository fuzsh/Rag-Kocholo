        "text": "Hi, Simon from the Spoilt Victorian Child blog thing here.\n\nFirstly I’d like to apologise for the mass mailout…\n\nI hate them myself, but it would take me a month to write to all of you…\n\nSo I understand if this goes straight in the bin.\n\nAnd secondly…\n\nLast week I started something that I’m quite excited about… SVC Records.\n\nAt the moment It’s just a download based net label, with two releases… but there will be a few more this month and I’m eventually going to try and get vinyl and CD releases sorted… just lack of cash stopping me at the moment.\n\nAnyway, here’s a few tracks for you to download from the first two albums.\n\nFirst up we have a few from Mike Seed…. Folky Pop.\n\nwww.svcrecords.co.uk/sample/Mike_Seed__Putting_The_Fountain_To_Sleep.mp3\n\nwww.svcrecords.co.uk/sample/Mike_Seed__Jack_Frost_Blues.mp3\n\nwww.svcrecords.co.uk/sample/Mike_Seed__William_In_A_Trance.mp3\n\nwww.svcrecords.co.uk/sample/Mike_Seed__High_Water_Mark.mp3\n\nMike’s page can be found at www.svcrecords.co.uk/artist_mikeseed.html\n\nAnd secondly we have some from The Palace Lido…. Electroish.\n\nwww.svcrecords.co.uk/sample/The_Palace_Lido__Neo_Maxi_Zoom_Dweebie.mp3\n\nwww.svcrecords.co.uk/sample/The_Palace_Lido__Vous_Envoyant_Cette_Forme.mp3\n\nwww.svcrecords.co.uk/sample/The_Palace_Lido__Its_A_Jungle_At_The_Zoo.mp3\n\nThe Palace Lido’s page can be found at www.svcrecords.co.uk/artist_palacelido.html\n\nWell I hope you find something you like there, It goes without saying that I’d love it if you could write something, feel free to link to the tracks if you fancy, and if you require any more info and the like just drop me a line.\n\nAll the best\n\nSimon\n\nX\n\nwww.svcrecords.co.uk"
