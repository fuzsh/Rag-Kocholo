PY a, i PROCEEDS ARE EITHER INVESTED IN TECHNOLOGICAL 1 Welcome to the first ever queer Issue of MRR. We're excited about It and we hope you all learn something from It. As you will see, much of what we have covered is from San Francisco, something that we tried to avoid by appealing to the masses via this page a few months ago. However, the response was quite small, meaning either that there wasn't anything going on outside of here, or perhaps people aren't as open about it as we had thought. In retrospect, the latter seems to be more accurate, as more and more things seem to be popping out of the most obscure places. Maybe this issue Is what's needed to bring them all together. Also, we've received a few complaints about our use of the word \"queer\", as some people find it quite degrading and insulting. For us, the word not only ties In to the rebellion often associated with punk and the like, but is also the only term that describes all sexes, genders, and orientations outside the norm. Got a better word? Then use It. Thanks to everyone who helped make this possible.

THE RODNEY KING BEATING VERDICT IS ONLY THE MOST OBVIOUS FACE OF RACIST WHITE AMERICA. IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT A JURY WITH VIRTUALLY NO AFRICAN-AMERICANS, FROM A LILY- WHITE SURURBAN CITY THAT IS KNOWN AS A COP HAVEN AND RETIREMENT COMMUNITY, WOULD UPHOLD RACIST POLICE VIOLENCE. THIS IS AN AMERICAN TRADITION THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR CENTURIES. YOU CAN BET YOUR SWEET ASS THAT THE DECISION WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE DIFFERENT HAD IT DEEN A WHITE MALE COPRORATE EXECUTIVE IN A RUSINESS SUIT GETTING STORMTROOPED. \"IVE lived HERE IN THIS CITY FOR OVER 40 YEARSS...AND NEVER ONCE HAVE 1 DEEN BRUTALIZED BY THE POLICE !! RCDBB Things haven t changed much .THE ONLY THING THAT THE POWER STRUCTURE UNDERSTANDS IS VIOLENCE OR THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE BUT THE MORE INSIDIOUS FACE OF RACISM TAKES PLACE EVERY DAY ON LESS BLATANT LEVELS. THE BLIND EYE OF JUSTICE THAT ONLY SERVES THE RICH IS JUST ONE FACET OF A SYSTEM THAT RORS PEOPLE OF THEIR HOPES AND DREAMS, OF ECONOMIC AND INTELLECTUAL OPPORTUNITY, OF PRIDE AND DIGNITY. THE MAYOR, GOVERNOR, AND PRESIDENT CALL FOR CALM AND RESPECT FOR THE LAW. HA FUCKING HA. WHEN THERE IS NO LONGER ANY HOPE, WHEN DEHUMANIZATION AND BRUTALITY ARE ONGOING AND SYSTEMATIC, WHEN THE MAJORITY COULD GIVE A SHIT-ANY FRUSTRATED RESPONSE IS NORMAL. These drawings are 25 years ago : ' '■\" \"'\"\"\"■■ Every so often the mask slips off the face of America. It happened during the Vietnam War and the race riots of the 1960s. But most of the time the plastic, the smokescreens, and the slick media hype obscures reality with an image that most This month we got another glimpse into the real soul of this country. What was most surprising was not that peek into the ugly soul beneath, but that so many people spontaneously erupted in frustrated revulsion at that sight. Not all their responses were laudable, like the instances where innocent people were dragged from cars and beaten merciless- ly, or where poor people looted small stores owned by other only slightly bet- ter off people. But the mere fact that so much frustration got released at once was enough to blow the cover, at least for now. America is not very political. The two-party charade, their big-buck back- ers, and the corporate media control keep most people either ignorant or in a TV- induced stupor. But apparently under- neath that conditioning lurks a desire for change. It may not get articulated in co- herent political terms, but the sheer amount of hatred and resentment cannot be covered up so easily anymore. This probably won't translate into real change, and you can bet the politi- cians and mass media will be working overtime to get that mask back in place as soon as possible, before people around the country realize what an opportunity for empowerment that have at hand. In some areas it got mean— not in terms of destruction of property, but in tenns of race vs race. The hatred and mistrust is understandable, but doesn't bode well for future solutions. But it was interesting to note that, at least in SF, the multi-racial crowds that revolted had a decidedly class outlook. There were very few reports of any racial tension, and the destruction was very pointedly aimed at the well-to-do shopping district. And while many looters may have taken ad- vantage of the situation (an NBC TV an- chor called them \"greedy\"), most of them seemed more like \"needy.\" President Bush calls for respect for the law, though as CIA chief, Vice-Prez, p and Big Cheese, he has repeatedly shown | no respect for international law. He sayr there's no room for racial bigotry in thi tion campaign was centered on racism through the use of buzzwords in ads that played on white fear of black America. Another \"hilarious\" moment came when TV reporters informed LA's may- or Bradley that there were reports of looters \"laughing\" and \"giving the high- five.\" Oooh, pretty scary! In the past, these kinds of spontane- ous explosions have not translated into focused political movements for change. Maybe they will this time, maybe not. But it was at least heartening to see that this system is not beyond being brought down. For a brief period, we saw our \"civilization\" crumble uncontrolably, the Third World chickens coming home to roost. America has abandoned its young, its minorities, its future. There is a price to pay for that dehumanization, and these events may just be the first few days of the fire sale yet to come. Combined with the upswing in anti-two part system sen- timent and the recent victories of rela- tively unkn own pro-choice women in primary elections, there is a real oppor- tunity for dramatic enpowerment for a long-subdued coalition of have nots. If the Supreme Court overturns the right of women to control their own bodies, we might be privileged to not only wit- ness—but be a vital part of— the restruc- turing of power in this sick country. What seemed impermeable now seems very vulnerable. Oh yeah, in response to those who say there's no political value in rampant, emotional explosions....two things. First, They are not only the most honest and direct expression of frustration and an- ger, but it has been proven over time that giant peaceful demonstrations ain't worth shit unless there's the threat of violent riots to back them up. Unfortu- nately, violence is the only language this system understands. And secondly, and again unfortu- nately, change through the electoral sys- tem is weighed towards those who have the most— the most money, the most control, the most power, the most to lose. They are the ones who rig the game and offer the (lack of) choices. It is the yuppies that vote (evermore conserva- tively) to affect change in their lives, and it is the disenfrachised that riot (ever- r<? more radically) to affect change in their a lives. an all-volunteer run store/community center Volunteers always welcomed.

Tim *Dear MRR, Was reading your April columns i section and have some comments: I Rockin' Jeff Bale: You say \"...the more convinced I become that they're basically just making a big joke out of punk, which is the one thing I consider unforgiv- able, man. Joke about me, or my politics, or even my old lady, but leave punk rock the fuck alone, understand?\" Jeff, punk rock was made to be fun of. It is a big joke. The whole point is that it is a joke with a fist. If that fist can't point towards its own face, what's the point? Any scene without a sense of humor about itself is a dud. Of course punk rock has been a marvelous phenomenon, and ex- tremely important, especially in terms of ed- ucation and do-it-yourself self-initiative. But refusing to laugh at ourselves is the fist step towards becoming really BORING. Humor brings perspective, and considering how ho- mopnobic, beer-guzzling, and sen-parody- ing the scene can already be (witness: \"Mer- ry Fucking Christmas\", hilarious as that was), we can use perspective. Punk rock without satire is dud rock. And punk rock without self- satire is humorless and pretentious. That doesn't mean we should marginalize the things we have to say or even how we say them, but ratherthat humor can be an impor- tant ingredient in serious discourse and self- examination. I also take issue with your statement \"What I object to is all these androgynous teenage girls in flannel shirts with rings througTi their noses who half the time you can't even tell if they're girls or boys!\" Now who's being reactionary? Is it really \"rebel- lious\" to enforce standard gender categories handed down for thousands of years? Is punk really \"breaking tradition\" by urging boys to be boys, girls to be girls, and men to be men? Come on really, the whole move- ment towards androgyny and blurring of the gender lines is in the service of revolution and transformation. Seeing someone who you can't immediately classify as male or female can fuck with you to the extent of making you question your classification scheme. Why is it that the first determination we make is someone's gender and upon that basis tailor our behavior? Someday sexual segregation (yes, even of clothes and bath- rooms) may seem like racial segregation of the past did. How often does punk rock degenerate into macho bullshit with a mo- hawk? There are some punks who, with their beer, sexist, racist, and homophobic atti- tudes, I wonder if the only thing separating them from the Archie Bunker who wants to kick their ass is their leather jacket and Doc Martens. If punk rock isn't how you like it, it's because it's out of your hands. It belongs to no one and everyone. The \"New Kids will determine what punk rock is, and they will make it theirs, no matter how many \"wimp or \"poseur\" (and there is nothing funnier than watching a \"You're more of a poseur than I contest) epithets we throw at them. And if what they do with it pisses you off, good! That's what punk rock's all about. I think the new punk rockers are going to be more androgynous, more bisexual, more transgender, more ethnically diverse and less willing to take shit than before, as well as less homophobic, racist, and sexist, not because it's politically correct, man, but because all of those things stink of a parent's world of authoritarian bullshit that want to deprive people of their individuality. Isn't punk about asserting your individuality? Of celebrating it— with a hammer, if necessary? If I wanteda macho contest, I could join the Hell's Angels or the Republican Party. It's time we acknowledged that some of our comrades such as QueerNation and ACTUP might be a lot more punkthan we are, and we might have a lot to learn from each other... Not that I'm telling you what to do. You don't have to think any way. Fuck political correctness. No one's gonna tell you what to do, and that's all right. Refuse their dogma, but listen to reason. Affirm your desires, yes, but see how they are informed by a fucked up culture. Punk is just as much about self- education as it is about an attitude. So this is just a one-voice contribution to an ongoing dialogue in all of our education... thanks. T3en Weasel: it seems hip these days to bag on Jello Biafra. Every time I read such things I chuckle. I chuckle because for one thing, many people have heroized him to such an extent that they expect him to be perfect, and when they find out that he, like every other human being on the face of the planet, can act like an asshole (did he ever claim otherwise?), get disillusioned and pissed off. We're all fucked up. But the fact is Jello Biafra has done more to educate and inform people than a lot of others in this scene. I don't worship him, but I sincerely find him most inspirational, and a valuable voice in the discourse (if you want to call it that) of punk. Tapes of Jello's spoken word albums go like mad: kids from age 1 1 to 27 gobble tnem up and learn quite a lot. It's mass education and entertainment. How many professors at any university do you know of who people will pay to hear, and when they come to speak have to move them to a larger auditorium (seating 5000) and even then turn away people? (like happened down here at Cal State Northridge in '91 ) And not speak- ing to elite audiences but to minorities and outcasts. I applaud Jello. I think he demon- strates the potential of free speech and con- sciousness raising. Sure, he's human. And when he does something fucked up, he should be called on it. But overall, I think he's done a lot of good for this scene and people in general. , , . Mykel Board: If you could print a copy of a testimony signed by the 1 2 year old boy testifying to your story and print it in MRR, you'd probably gain more credibility and sup- port. I think a lot more people would be willing to help out if they saw that. Just an idea. Life With Larry: Yes, I foundyour article mildly humorous and good for poking fun, but somewhat tiresome. While yes, it is easy to poke fun at NAMBLA and the RCP, and somewhat fun to parody the jargon and slo- gans, that does not negate the fact that there is a lot of scary rightwing stuff going on in this country. Maybe it's not Hitler. Maybe there won't be martial law with boot camps and curfews and executions. But it's still getting scary. We can fight amongst ourselves all we want, but guess who's laughing. Jesse Helms and Pat Buchanan ain't gonna cry for you when you end up in jail for some petty noth- ing, and Hitler or no, prison IS the police state. That's here now. It's been here. Yes, so-called sensitivity can be taken to ridicu- lous extremes. There's a value to directness, expressiveness, uncensored truth, and even obnoxiousness. But are these things really so separate from being sensitive? Is it impos- sible to be both at the same time? We've all met people who seem to fit your stereotype perfectly and it's healthy to laugh at them, as they should at their selves. But while we laugh at the form, we should not marginalize the substance. In much of this, there is good food for thought and action. Anyway, I think you have a great mag- azine that is thought-provoking and one of the BEST resource guides to alternative cul- ture. I think your \"Book Your Own Fuckin' Life\" is a magnificent idea. It's about time we networked and got ourselves an integrated media of our own. The more people we can reach, the more people we are. Best to you — Howlin' Mad Jonann P.S. Have you read Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed! Check it out. Dear MRR: Safe sex is a serious is- ' sue and definitely worthy of cover- age, but MRR does not do its read- ers a service by printing questionable misin- formation on the subject. What are Lily Brain- drop's sources? She implies that urine is unsafe, while even the U.S. Surgeon Gener- al unequivocally stated it is not a transmis- sion veniclef or HIV (f reshpiss is sterile). I let Johnny Puke piss straight into my mouth from the CBGB's stage, so you can be sure I've researched that one. She also specifical- ly requires a barrier for oral sex, swallowing whole (pardon the pun) the U.S. govern- ment's campaign to stamp out oral sex. The Canadian government has pronounced oral sex safe, and at the very least it is extremely difficult (if not impossible, short of an open wound in the mouth) to transmit the virus that way. Saliva is an active destroyerof HIV, and stomach acids are even more lethal to it. Check it out in the medical journals, not just the U.S. government-approved literature (which includes all those groups getting gov- ernment grants, Lily). Since my report on the Popsicle Jubi- lee Festival got printed in your April issue, and some readers might have thought it unlikely that a 1 9-band-f estival could go on despite cops and bullets, let me assure read- ers that it was a serious news report. While I'm on the April issue, that Ant- arctica scene report was the best scene report I've ever seen; not a single band was left out. Too bad the Mykel B story was fake; that trial would've been something to look forward to! Kudos on a fun issue! An update on the Punk for Beginners book project: despite letters sent to zines in over a dozen foreign countries, insufficient overseas response has come in to make up for my own lack of knowledge about foreign punk, so I think I'm going to have to limit the book to American (and maybe British) histo- ry. One of two co-cartoonists decided to drop out, so I'm on the lookout for more illustra- tors. Also need more researchers to give me the full story on their favorite punx. Anyone interested write to me at 3147 Broadway, #12A/ NYC 10027. And thanx to the letter- writer who slagged the book before it was even written. Great idea: next is to review records before they're been recorded and then before the songs get written. Lots of innovative possibilities. Think how much time it would save for reviewers! Finally a note to zine editors: I've decid- ed to write a wide-ranging monthly or bi- monthly column, which Tim says MRR has no room for, so if you're interested in it, drop me a note. It won't always be about punk rock (not to mention sex & drugs & chaos) but it will explore interesting topics from a punk's perspective. Donny the Punk y^L Hello MRR and fellow letter read- ^^^r Last issue #107 bugged me. The ^^ Nirvana interview was real good on Lance's behalf, but why put a band that has sold us down the shitter in MRR? Yes, Nirvana has fucked the underground good and proper. All Nirvana stands for now is corporate, slimy, cut-throat greed! Why else were they so quick to change their name so that DGC can mold them into that industry's perfect image of exploration. Nirvana, just like Danzig, Hank Rollins, Suicidal Tendencies, Social Distortion and the rest that will follow in their footsteps, are nothing but corporate whores and tney do not deserve our support. All they do is de- stroy what took a long time to build up in the alternative \"scene\". It s way cool that Lance got in f orf ree, but what if I were into Nirvana? Pd have to pay a real bullshit door price so that Nirvana could live in fucking mansions while I worry if I still got a job or not. It may seem that I m jealous ana just blowing hot air. Well if that's what y'all think, then fuck it. I don'tgive a fuck! Fuck Nirvana, may all of their limo windows be broken and may the same fate befall any band who sells out to the greedy, cut-throat recording company bandits. We (or should I say I?) don't needthose kinds of bands. Launch Pad/ 1057 Topsail Dr./ Vallejo, CA 94591 P.S. Be a fool, go ahead and support those mentally dead bands but be warned, you'll just be tucking yourself over. a. Dear MRR, :The other day while at a local mag- ' azine stand I happened to view the new issue of MRR #107. Well, I picked up a copy, paid for it, and went home to read it. As I always do I proceeded to read MRR from start to finish, cover to cover, etc. Needless to say that what I read would completely shatter my world and change my life forever. It all started as soon as I read Tim Yo's column. After reading Tim Yo's column I put the magazine down, went outside, and at the top of my lungs screamed, \"What the fuck?\". As I was walking back inside it dawned on me that maybeTim was suffering from senility brought on by old age. I re-read Tim's column and come to the conclusion that it must be for real. I then proceeded to read several other things that would completely blow my mind. I won't mention all the things, but I will mention a few. In Mykel Board's column, he talked about how he was having trouble with the law stemmingfrom an incident that had to do with a sexual encounterconceming some underage kid in some bathroom. Having been a long time reader of Mykel Board's columns this came as no surprise to me. What surprised me is when I read that GG Allin was doing a benefit for Mykel. GG Allin, (a man who I thought hated everyone and everything), actually doing a benefit for some- one. What is the world coming to? Then in the record reviews I read a couple of shocking items. Poison Idea put out an album of thrashfunk and was on Metal Blade records, and if that wasn't bad enough, I then read where Winger, (a band who I just wrote off as some lame, limp wristed, sissy boy, wanna be metal band who couldn't write a decent song to save their life), was putting out a punk EP called, \"Fuck the Govern- ment\". Oh Jesus I think I'm coming to join ya— NOT! There were a couple of other things such as finding out that Kurt Cobain from Nirvana was in the first line-up of the band Instead, that MRR would be merging with Flipside, and what really pushed my mind overthe edge was when I saw an ad for MRR merchandise — The Spring Line. MRR is now selling clothes? I can just see it now, MRR comes out with a glossy cover, stops covering punk and alternative bands and goes for a more com- mercial rock/metal readership, starts having nudie centerfold pullouts. I'm sure for their first centerfold they will probably have Su- zanne Bartchy, (you know, the drop dead gorgeous, liberty spiked punk goddess who graced the cover of MRFl a few issues ago), in the nude 4n some sexually erotic pose. MRR will also start having beer and cigarette ads. Who would have ever thought we'd see the day that MRR goes mainstream commer- cial? Well, needless to say that after reading issue #1 07 1 have been going around the last couple of days dazed and confused, (how wonderful, I'm now using Led Zeppelin song titles in my letter), I have been unable to eat, I can t function mentally, and have just basi- cally have lost the will to live. How could vou do this MRR? I'm sure I'm not the only one who felt like this after reading the April issue of MRR. Well, I'll finish this letter off by saying, 'Thanks MRR,Thanksfor turning my world upside down.\" I'm sure you're happy knowing that my life has been affected forever and may never be the same again. I'm sure with years and years of intense therapy I will be able to put some of my life backtogether again. Oh well, see ya. Ian A. Tim, Hiya. I wanted to say I totally agree with your column in #1 07. 1 am sad to see this community go down the shitter as it has for the last 5 years or so. I write to say good luck in the future and thank you jor what you have done for everyone in the \"scene\". Eric Astor/ PO Box 1 865/Tempe, AZ 85280- 1865 PS Jeff Last Option says goodbye. jt Dear MRR/Mykel Board, Tj Mykel, m'boy, you're lucky you're ** I not dead, you sick motherfucker. I don't care if the kid beggedyou for it, you are an adult pervert, and had a moral obligation to disengage yourself from his ministrations. Your failure to act condemns you just as if you had stuck your diseased unit in his mouth. You are one very disturbed individual, Mykel, and I strongly recommend that you seek psychiatric help. Anyone who lets a 1 2- year old lick his dirty asshole (in a public restroom, no less) is a sad individual indeed. Sincerely, Geoff Burkmarvproprietor Renaissance Mu- sic Media/ 1 924 S. Smithville Road/ Dayton, OH 45420 P.S.-Don't overcome to Dayton, Mykel, because if you pull that sick shit here, you'll never leave intact. Bet on it! ®Yo Sean Reich & MRR readers, Before I comment on Mr. Ho- mophobia's letter in MRR #107, I'd like to correct something from #1 06. In the SoCal scene report, it was stated that the San Diego Anti-racist Action had \"folded up\". This is untrue. We're still here & we ain't folding shit. The reason it appears as though we've disbanded is be- cuz lately we've been having dual meetings/ actions with the San Diego Anarchist Feder- ation. A lot of A.R.A. members are also S.D.A.F. members. Our most recent venture was a show on March 20th with the almighty Tit Wrench (who rule), Stillborn, Rice, Total Chaos, Psycho Babble, A-Solution, & No More Hate. The A.F. put out a minizine/ flyer for the show & the A.R.A.'s zine Under Your Skin #2 should be out soon. My column in issue #2 deals with homophobia, so of course in it I had to mention dickhead Sean, ho- mophobe extrordinaire. So please take note - San Diego's A.R.A. is alive & well, & so is the S.D.A.F. Now to address Sean's letter. Sean, I have trouble with everythingyou say. I mean, who can you take seriously? You call your band \"Vegan Reich\", you're supposedly a vegan, but at the same time, you're a total redneck homophobe. Your latest rage is defending the memory of that fuckwad Bill Graham. Well fuck him & fuck you. I'd piss on either of your graves. Your main beef is that you thought Tim was com- pletely insensitive towards the loss of a life, but let's not forget who's life this was. This was no innocent, caring person. Bill Graham was a money grubbing piece of shit. I thought Tim & Larry were both rather lenient on him; I'm not so nice. If the Grateful Dead are your idea of a radical 60's band, you are truly a loser. The Dead sucked from day one. They were about as radical as Molly Hatchet. There were a lot of really good bands that Graham promoted, but he wasn't doing us any favors. He did K to get rich -filthy rich. Are you gonna miss him, Sean? I'm glad the tightwad died. That s one less parasite. What kind of an asinine comparison were vou trying to make between Graham and Tim Yo? You said, \"How many people were changed by the bands Tim Yo helped get out?\" Get a clue you dork. Graham's job was promotion, not helping bands, not chang- ing people, just promotion. The fucker got filthy rich doing shows with any band ne could sell. The fact that there were a lot of great bands around when he started promotion was pure dumb luck. He had nothinq to do with the quality of music coming out. He was in it for the profit and bands like The Who, Hendrix, The Doors and such just made it easy for him. A band's talent has little to do with the leeches that promote them. Tim and crew nave helped \"get out many bands. I don't know how you could say any different. Through MRR, Gilman, Epi- center, MRRRadio.&severalrecords.theyve done more for punk rock than a hundred Bill Grahams have doneforcock rock. You seem to think that it's the other way around. Bill Graham wouldn't have given a chump like you the time of day. MRFt, on the other hand, has given you a chance to speak your mind, even though they don't agree with everything you say. MRR doesn't make millions off the scene like Graham did. That's becuz they pump life into the scene, instead of sucking the blood from it, like Graham. \"Ripped apart from limb to limb , well boo, hoo, noo. Fuck him. That's what he gets for zipping around town in his f uckin helicop- ter. Honestly, you act like he was a relative of yours. He was scum, & I dig it when scum dies. And Sean, well you're scum too. A Hardline, hate-filled, homophobic, anti-abor- tionist, god-fearing scum. I'll be Grateful when you're Dead. Stinky Panch w Just read your \"last\" col- umn. Your comments on the state of the punk scene were right on target. Liars, backstabbers, ass-kissers, fakes, money-grubbers, etc, etc, etc. We said this all years ago, that's why our name is a take-off on anti-scene. As soon as you have a \"scene\" somebody wants to rule it, then segregate itfromeverybody else. \"We're more punk than you\", etc, etc. We always hopecf we'd someday have one giant \"world scene\" that everybody could be part of, with no jealous backstabbers to fuck it up. But people will never change, I guess. I'm not a cynic, I'm a realist. But you've done a lot of great things for a lot of people, including us. I'm 32 now, still playing the same 3-chord punk songs I was playin p in 1 983 when we started. Most of the kids at our shows think we're a bunch of old farts but come out anyway cause they wanna make the \"scene\" here in Charlotte. Our first European tour went great. Beautiful people over there. Very little back- stabbing.Hopeyou can make ourf irst SF gig coming up soon. Thanks man! Joe/Antiseen (Second letter 5 days later) Hey Tim! What a sneaky bunch of bastards you old punk rockers are! I just wrote Mykel and told him to \"blow\" the 20 bucks I sent his \"defense fund\" down in Times Square. Oh well, live and learn as Homer Simpson said once! Hope to see you in April. Joe ^d^ Dear MRR, , . ■1 I must say how utterly im- ^^J^P pressed I was with Mykel Board's ^^^column in the April '92 edition of MRR. The stirring recreation of Board's sex act with a twelve year-old boy in an airport john left me breathlessly wonderinq what Board will be up to next. Way to go Mykel! And to think you did the same thing in Thai- land! And were considered a \"hero no less! I work in the adult video industry myself and am fortunate enough to view quite a few adult videos from various companies, and I tell ya, Myk, I don't think I've ever seen a story quite like yours on the screen. Why dont'cha come on down to LA. and practice your talented hand at something other than what you're used to using it for, and help us out on some scripts? Yours is the stuff that legends are made of! I tellya, in an industry filled with repetitive Man- Woman, Woman-Woman, Man-Man sex-acts, we could use someone like you! Man-Boy! Yes! And, to be fair, how 'bout Man-Girl, too?! After all, what's fair for one should be fair to the other, right? I'm sure you'd agree. I can see the titles of these potential classic movies now: Kindergarten Cock, All the President's Boys, andperhaps a new version of an old classic: The Little Prince. Thanks, Myk, for the great tale. What say you work on a treatment right away? How 'bout a new angle for The Little Prince? I mean, after all, just what were the pilot and the boy-prince doing in the desert all by themselves?! If you got anymore stories just write me directly. I'll \"be sure to pass it on to the \"right\" people. Let's do lunch, Roc O'Callahan/ Van Nuys, CA P.S. No, I'm not leaving my address, and no, \"Roc O'Callahan\" is not my real name. If homophobes have already attacked Mr. Board's dwelling I sure as hell am not going to risk some idiots taking my sarcasm seriously and going after me. It's a fucked world but that's the price you pay for speak- ing your mind. a Dear Friends, Yeah, that's right- I called you all \"friends\". Why? Well, I so foolishly believe that anyone reading this let- ter right now belongs to the same extended family I do - not so much to the family of punks, but to the family of those of us who live our lives against the \"normalcy\" of society. It doesn't really matter if you are a Nazi skin, an East Bay scenester, a drunken anarchist, or just a lonely kid with a mohawk and combat boots trying to make it through school everyday in some far-away hicktown. What does really matter is the fact that we are all just a very small part of a very big whole and we've got to stop i fighting each other and start supporting each other. And even though people will continue to argue and voice their individual opinions in these very letters (and sometimes they get very nasty), we must always remember that we are all on the same side (except for maybe some die-hard losers who will die ignorant punks anyway.) This ship we like to refer to as \"PUNK\" is sinking fast because of many reasons. But the one major reason is that we are all starting to divide ourselves into different groups. Now, there are a lot of people who say this is a good thing - punk sucks now anyway, so why not just let people split and go and start a whole new thing on their own. Some people even go so far as to say, \"Destroy MRR! because this will then force everyone to start an entirely new network of scenes, zines, and bands. But do we really want the existing punkculture to just crawl away and die? Most people would love to see all of us punks just go away and die - especially the government. Are we going to play into their hands? No matter what happens, we have to stay linked together to fight against all of the red tape and bullshit and right-wing dog poop that is beginning to sweep across our nation. Be- lieve it or not, punk is a sub-culture that has many traits of an entirely separate culture. Archeologists and historians will look back on our civilization millions of years from now (if humans still exist) and be amazed at the fact that WE had our own types of music, language, clothing, beer, philosophy and lit- erature - but it all died at its peak in the late 20th century because of unknown reasons. They will wonder why we died away like the dinosaurs and let a bunch of complete ass holes like David Duke and Pat Buchanan come to power. So let's just get our acts together and do what we have to do - change punk without destroying it. This sub-culture needs to be shaken up a lot! Every minute we spend fighting and dividing is just one more minute that the government uses to slowly take away our rights as punks and as citi- zens. So my message to you, punk, is to stop bitching and complaining and to start taking things into your own hands - and you just might need OUR help. I would also just like to comment on some of those bombshells that were dropped on MRR readers in the now-classic issue #107 (if this letter is already too long, then you can drop this part because those very same bombshells could have all been part of an April Fools Day prank, and I could be about to humiliate myself by falling for your punky chicanery.) (1 ) TIM YO QUITS: I was very shocked and saddened to learn that Tim was leaving MRR after giving all of us literate punks 1 07+ issues of fun. His creation, MRR, not only changed my life, but also everyone else involved with the zine and thousands of other punks worldwide. So thank you, Timmy. You inspired me to create my own zine and you also served as a hero to all of us goon-punks who stand above 6 feet tall. „ w _ „. .. (2) MYKEL BOARD ARRESTED: Well, it didnt really come as much of a surprise to me that this pervert finally got what was coming to him but what did surprise me was the fact that the wrath of God finally came down on him. Hey Mykel - looks like my god's not an asshole - YOU ARE! _,„__._._ (3) BAD RELIGION RE-DISCOVER THEIR ROOTS: That letter from Bad Reli- gion really made my day. They now say they're only gonna play $5 shows! Looks like Ben Weasers article on 'The Business Of Punk Rock\" actually accomplished some- thing. Thanks Ben! You probably saved me and a lot of other punks $10 the next time Bad Religion rolls into ourtowns. Now I don't have to feel guilty (because of their shady busi- ness practices) when I listen to \"Generator\", which is one of their best releases to date. (4) MRR MERGES WITH FLIPSIDE: What?!?!? Well, in these tough economic times it makes sense. Punks have to watch out for each other and I guess I'll keep on supporting MRR even though I find Flipside to be very boring. It's almostlike Pepsi taking over Coke or George Bush picking Pat Bucha- nan as vice-president. Well, I took up enough space. I hope I made at least some sense and actually sent a positive message through these letters for a change. My zine, Suffolk Suffocation, will print anything you send us - including any ads you have - for free!!! Also, please call 1 - 800-426-1 1 1 2 and pledge some money for Jerry Brown's presidential campaign. I hope MRR helps him out when he gets to Califor- nia. Twinkie Force is the greatest band on Earth (hey Lawrence Livermore - did you get my postcard?) I love you all. Have a nice day. Brian Grandjean/ PO Box 1 53/ Bayport, NY 11705-0153 ®Dear MRR, So we have Stiff Little Fin- gers, The Damned and The riuzzcocks reforming every three years for another cash in reunion. We have Henry Rollins posing in designer jeans in fashion magazines. Crass records no longer have the \"pay no more than\" price warnings on them. Discharge reformed only to play the pseudo Led Zepplin crap they got booed off the stage at the Ritz for. Two members of Govnment Issue have new bands using their names as names. Naplam Death still pretend to be politically conscious. Wattie from the Exploited has a red braided extension mohi- can making him look like Living Colour's Cory Glover. Pre studded leatherjackets sell for $400 in local trendy shops. Flipside, the fanzine that abandoned punk years ago in exchange for all the rage rock'n'roll crap is merging with MRR. And finally Tim Yo has left MRR because he feels he's flogging a dead horse. But why? Because we have yet to change the world? Sure the aforemen- tioned used to make me feel uneasy but what else is there? That is not to say that punk rock is the only viable source of music or flavor of counterculture out there but it is something I have participated in for 1 years now and still believe in. The bands and people that in- spired me in the early 80's are for the most part gone but not all of them and there are always new ones to replace the old 1 992. We have Born Against, probably one of the most sincere and astute bands playing and Citizen Fish, Resist, FUAL and Profane Existence. There are many more bands and fanzines today made up of people who are concerned with the events of today. The hippies did not change the world and punk is not going to change the world tomorrow, but we as con- cerned people have to express our disap- proval as to the way the planet is run. You cannot expect to change thousands of years of conditioning in even three decades. It will happen, for if it does not it will not matter because we will be dead. Tim Yohannan, I am sorry you have given up and you will be missed even if you did give my band a bad review. Thanks. Rob Phelps/ 199 Ives St/ Providence, Rl 02906 ~MRR- Just read the Nirvana in- terview in issue #107. All of their anti-gay comments make me sick and I want Nirvana to know I'm gay and proud of it and you guys are fucking assholes and need to grow up and analyze why you are so homophobic. Not only them, all these so- called free thinking people who slag gays and lesbians are really full of shit. You've all been brainwashed into hatinggay people by your parents, teachers, etc. Think about it, what the fuck is so bad about two men having sex or two women having sex. Nothing. It's been around forever and will always be around. 1 in 10 people are gay or lesbian, if it seems like fewer to you it 's because people often keep it inside, scared assholes like Nirvana will fuck with them. MRR - 1 already think you are full of shit and now I hate you even more for printing this really stupid anti- gay interview. Being punkyou're so often the misfit, outsider, underdog. So, being gay is the same thing and to put us down is really stupid. Many people at shows are gay and lesbian and the underground must be ma- ture and accepting. The whole straight world is against gays, it hates us, and is killing us off and for the so-called underground music scene to act similarly is sick. Like Kenny Kaos, challenging the dude to a fist fight to \"see who's right\", are you joking? What an asshole. That kind of thinking you should be hanging out with rednecks or preppie college frat boys and by the way, your brain must be rotting from all your West Coast bullshit. The Waldo's fuckin rock and you can't compre- hend New York punk rock like the fucking NYDolls, Ramones, Wayne Country, etc. The Waldo's is keeping the tradition of true rock'n'roll alive and youKenny and MRR and all you readers can kiss my gay and proud ass! I hadn't bought yourshittyragin 5 years, I stole this issue and it's obvious Tve missed nothing. You all are totally running around in a treadmill, completely played out.it's the same shit year after year, you are all so boring, just give it up ! Gays and lesbian punks and otherwise rule! Sincerely, Maurice White/ NYC rules. P.S.: Johnny Thunders lives, fuck you if you're too ignorant to see it! P.P.S.: You MRR owe an apology to your lesbian and gay readers for publishing something very offensive and insulting, ft that doesn't make sense to you, you are all sick P.P.P.S.: Mykel Board you are full of shit, I hope you rot in jail. Liar! Dear Tim, My name is Jason and I'm from West Virginia (yeah, you've reached the mountain state!). Anyway, about 5, or 6, or 7, or 8 years ago I picked up a Black Flag LP and thought, \"Phucldis be da shit!\" Well, to make a long story and a short life shorter, over the years my musical discoveries have broaden and exponentially with it so did my awareness and attitudes. And now, to me at least the music has become pretty much secondary, it's all ideas you know? Anyhow, that transition also was brought about because about the same time I heard that first chord of Black Flag, I also picked up a Maximum Rock-n-RoJI, and I realized that there were ideas, attitudes, problems and lifestyles being presented in the music. As some of my friends, and like- minded freaks from school se- dated them- selves with the Misfits and other assorted crap, I kept reading, I kept listening, and I kept thinking. Here I am today, 19, in college (buying time), and trying to figure out a way I can live in accordance to the beliefs and ideas I hold so dear without becoming anoth- er drone worker for the queenbee of the capitalist hive. And it's hard as hell! You know why? There are very few role models, or examples to look to! (no! not to someone to blindly follow!), but there are very few people to look to for inspiration and to be able to say \"Look! he did it!! I can fucking do it toolr Whenever I hear that patronizing, \"Don't worry you'll get over it, you'll calm down.\" Well, I won't get over it! Damit! Your one of those examples Tim! You're one of those punk role models (like it, or not!) I remember when I first saw Threat By Example, you know what? You're in there Tim! You know why? You're example is a threat! Yeah, I know it sounds over simplistic and stupid, but think about it! You're an example! In a scene that is dominated by red- necks and jocks in punk clothing, by image makers and alternative socialites there is a core, a very small core of people to whom punk is a lifestyle, a religion of strength and will to survive and grow, and those people have there best connection and inspiration in MRR and you! I can always point to you and say, \"He's 40 years old, fought like hell and held onto his beliefs! He did it, so can I.\" I have always looked up to you,(no you're not an idol, or anything, so don't let your head swell!), and been inspired by your example. Well, I just got done reading your col- umn this month, (as you can probably tell). Actually, I read it about a dozen times looking for the words \"April fools\", but it wasn't there. You know sometimes I feel like giving up and going mainstream and saying what the fuck and either getting a job in suburban Mc- Donald's world, but then I quickly regain my \"right\" mind again and realize that's taking the easy way out, that's giving up. That is defeatism! This month's column embodied every- thing that's ever in my mind when I feel like saying'fuck it!\" It's all true! It's all sad, and it's scary, and it makes me mad as hell. But in all honesty, when I read that you were quitting, I cried. I felt like an idiot for doing it, but I couldn't help but cry. From years of reading your zine and living in a fucked up world I've never been able to get myself to write a single note to anyone for any reason, but when I sawTimY., one of the most influential people in helpingto shape my thoughts andfeelings, the guy responsible for creating an all impor- tant media like MRR about to call it quits I couldn't keep quiet! After I read your column I get out my Threat by Example once more. I opened it to page 46, and there between the Dick Lu- cas's, the Lawrence Livermores\", and the Chumbawamba's, was one more person who in who influenced probably a whole Hell of alot more people around the world than just Martin Sprouse, It was you, man! I read back over your section, but it's funny, right there on the fac- ing page was two black boxes that I thought did and still do typifyTim Yohannan, and probably how he wants to be remembered. The first said: 'The key is, first, having a dream. Second, it's important to communi- cate that dream to others to see if they share it or are a part of it/ And third motivating myself to motivate others to joint action Right below that is your story of failing the Army physical! Tim that is motivation! That is an example! The 2nd black box reads: \"We dont have the numbers or power to meet the strength of the Industrial State head on, so we must be clever, must know our limitations but not ever give into defeatism.\" Those are words to live by! And you have for so long. Don't stop! What your column says is true and it frustrates me too! 1 don't want to seem as if I'm judging you for a personal decision or slamming you for selling out, because I don t feel you are. To me you re a friend, someone who (even though unknowingly) was there to lend a guiding hand and to help me see. To me you re a friend who is now feeling pushed a little too far and a little too hard, and are fuckin' pissed that you seem helpless to do anything about it. ,.«_, Well maybe the New World Order is to be the death of us all, and maybe CIA terror- ism is only a phone call away, and maybe you're getting shit for a petty Dwarves inter- view from a bunch of assholes who are only one step above Danzig fans and maybe we couldn't stop a war! But, in such an increas- ingly fuckea up world punk rock means ev- erything!!!! It means in the face of the biggest meanest, ugliest, stinkenest, most bad breathed, toothless, ruthless, sprt-slobberin, club weildin, punk thumping, racist, republi- can, homophobic, soci-pathic, David Duke wannabe, George Bush worshippin GM puppet of a bully that there are a handle full of us 1 9-41 year old snot noses that just won t backdown!! Besides Tim, the power of the individ- ual in his own time to change the world is very limited! Single handedly you, or even us, could not stop a war, or world wide capitalis- tic rape, that is one limitations! But you re a success Tim! Because you've succeeded in planting the seeds and you've even stuck aroundto water dem seeds! You and your crew have inspired hundreds and maybe thousands more people like me to be the next core people of punk to keep the ideas alive and growing so that we can plant them in 1 0's of thousands in the next wave. (By the way, this is the first time in history that ded- icated punks are having and raising kids! Just think of who might pop up!) Anyway whatyouandyour'baby\" have fostered are the seeds and roots of change. Who knows it may take 100's and 100's of years but I believe someday we might win. Unfortunately it's a race against time to win before their fuck ups kill us all, and we might lose, but isn't the punk spirit greatthat us snot noses will still try! , . . _ I Love usf! Go team! (ha ha). Team, yeah right? You know, us punks may be the most disorganized, untrusting, rebellious, un- cooperative and sometimes lazy fuckers in the world but even if every bit of work we ever do gets bulldozed we, ourselves, will not be,!! Cos' we're Punk Damnit! Now maybe I sound naive and imma- ture, but I don't think so! Maybe I'm taking a musical \"trend\" (as they say in mass media gone wild too seriously, but I don t think so! Pm just living the way I believe is right, and it s not far from the way the Tim Yohannan I know and loves does probably. You know, maybe MRR has survived a war, two presidents, growing state violence, harassment and assassination attempts but I don't think it can survive Tim Yohannan. Because it survived due to Tim Yohannan! Because you're the Grandfather of Punk! And you should be damn proud that you've earned that title! . Yeah sure! Obie and his \"straightened ouf friends, who one by one \"got on with their lives\", may see you as a middle-aged kid failure who refuses to grow up; well fuck them!!! And if you ever see Obie or that guy in NY who called you; you should punch their fucking lights out!! Because in an increasing- ly fucked world, punk rock, and your involve- ment in it means everything! Tim, I may be the only one who writes to you and you may get a 100 letters saying 'Thank god! he's gone!\" but I don't think I m the only one you (eft a positive impact on. There a hundred and maybe thousands of other punks out there like me who truty care and know what's up. And probably every one of them cried a tear or two this month too! So please Tim, I ask for myself and on behalf of them, please, workthruK, reconsid- er, fight if you have to but please... Comeback. P.S. You can't let them win by allowing one of our leaders at a time to fall by the wayside. Your friend, Jason Murphy/ Rt. 1 , Box 172a/ Falling Wa- ters, WV 2541 9 a Dear MRR: This is Rich from vicious Vinyl fan- zine sending in this news clipping that appeared in the weekend sec- tion of the Seattle Times (3/20/92). I was surprised to find out that the mainstream press even knew of MRR's existence!!! But anyway, here's proof that they do! The April issue of Maximum Rock N Roll has Northwest bands all over it, includ- ing a hilarious interview with Nirvana, an interview-feature with the Fastbacks and an interview with the Mono Men, illustrated by photos of the classic Northwest bands the Sonics and the Waiters. And there are re- views of bootleg recordings by Soundgarden /!</*»..» A U^lmMit Uinrtia\") \\lin/ana I Smalls \"Get A Haircut Hippie\"), Nirvana ( Smells Jke Green Spirit\") and - best of all - Bruce Pavitt, the Sub Pop tycoon, plays for some- thing called \"Bruce Pavitt Plays 'Teen Beat, described as a surf/instrumental record. It was recorded in 1979, and the over picture of young Pavitt, is a hoot. By the way, the Nirvana interview squelches rampant rumors about the band breaking up. \"We're /usf gonna keep getting heavier and heavier, Kurt Cobain (who is curiously referred to as \"Qurt\" throughout) is quoted as saying \"More of the same high quality rock. We love our fans and feel like they should be able to expect something from us. \" Dear Maximum Rock and Roll, I'd never have thought the day would ,come when I could sincerely quote a Slapshot song, but it now seems ap- propriate, punk is dead. The once admirable traits of its adversity the the mega-business politics of the \"real world,\" and its individuality and its non-conformity have been transformed into hypocritical political ideologies, and a clique-filled, narrow-mindedcommunrty. Over the past couple of years, we have watched punk gradually decay, and now, Maximum RocknRoll has finished it off for good. What was once a valuable medium for communi- cation is now nothing but one petty argument after another, pages of mindless interviews, and now, a \"corporation.\" The inside cover of issue number 107 confirmed every doubt I ever had about the sincerity of punk rock and of your publication. I've probably swore to myself a half a dozen times over the past year that I would never buy MRR again. The first criticism that got to me was the extreme and blatant bias towards bands and individuals not from an approved location, i.e. the East Bay. Ive seen countless original bands from through- out the country suffer from a bad review when bands like the Mr. T Experience and Greenday can regurgitate the same three chords and the same silly lyrics and receive great reviews. And what really sucks is that you have the whole underground community by the balls. We need a review to sell records yet if we get a bad one, which we probably will we're tucked. And heaven forbid our zine isn't quite up to par with your standards, because now you won't review it. I guess as the popularity of your publication increased, so did your ego. (By the way, these are not pissed off, spiteful feelings that I have be- cause of a bad review, nothing of mine has been reviewed as of yet.) There is absolutely nothing to read in MRR anymore. The letters section is ajoke. They are usually from some half-witted mo- ron complaining about his favorite band sell- ing out. \"\"Oh, boo hoo, bands aren t allowed to make a living if they are really punkfuckin rock \" Then of course I could always turn a few pages and read another interview with Nirvana, (as if they need any more press). Don't interview any new bands, that would be too logical. The news section is ridiculous. That stupid two-page spread that asks all the cool Berkeley dudes a really hip question is a total waste of space. And what really cracks me up is this new feminist and gay kick your on It seems to me like you pick the hottest topic of the day, (no matter how old and how boring), and use it to capitalize . The only section worth glancing af is the columns. Thank God there are people like Ben Weasel and Mykel Board who piss people off and force them to think. And now for the straw that broke the camel's back, Maxide Corp. Everything punk rock has always been against is a reality. To an unsuspecting reader, it seemed almost like MRRperformed a hostile takeover of Flipside. For some strange reason, I can t buy the fact that the intentions of this merger are totally legitimate. I think I see dollar signs somewhere. I'd neverthought I'd seethe day when MRR was big business. But wait, now that MRR has merged with Flipside, maybe they will accept all ads. Nope. MRR has taken the liberty to continue to blatantly censor all ads. Excuse me, punk rock is supposed to be against censorshjp, even if it concerns racism or homophobia. Don't I have a right to say what ever the fuck I want to? Isn't there a journalistic code that plainly states that the views of the editors are not necessarily in agreement with those of the contributors. MRR has the power to be so informa- tive, but you fucked it up. I totally think it's time for something new. Punk is dead, stick a fork in ft, it's done. Let's move on and start something new. Let's put all of those stupid punk rock philosophies set in our mind by bands and publications such as this aside and start over. God knows its about time. Sincerely, Brian McNamara/ 3428 Hess Sty Phila., PA 19136 r-^^fe^i Dear Mykel Board, ■*■ You stinking filthy pervert. L W^J It's too bad about your house get- ^~-t--^'^ting fire bombed... Too bad you weren't in it. I find your story of how the boy initiated everything to be questionable at best. But for the sake of argument, we'll say he did. What if the boy was 10 years old? Would you have still allowed it to happen you piece of shit? How about it? Maybe six? Is it okay for children to be seduced to dirty old fakenes like yourself? Is it all right if they get A.I.D.S? I guess it is, after all a six year old can say no, right? Granted the boy's father was probably as bad as you, deserving the slow death, but if I walked in on you doing what you did, I'd smash your teeth on the urinal, kick your fucking kneecaps in, and crush your larynx. Rot in prison you sick mother fucker, Warren Fisher. Dear Maximum Rock N' Roll, Excuse me Mr. Weasel, your column in MRR #107 makes me wantto heave. Let me just brief- ly explain. Not only do I think your column is a total waste of valuable space, but a waste of readers' time. Who really cares if you have nothing betterto do then to tell MRR readers that you re jealous that Jello's got the woman you wanted, which seems to me anyway, a lie. You say Biafra said, \"I'm the most famous punk rocKer in America.\" Well shit, he probably is. Hasn't he done many uncountable, valuable things for\"smart' punks over 1 2 years? The guy is fucking honest with intelligence, and has a great voice to boot. Shit, \"Biafra for fucking president.\" I'm sure you'll comment on that. Who even cares who's more punk than who. About you grabbing Jello's dick, it was probably a wet dream come true for you. I can imagine you couldn't wait to tell all of us about it. You're so pathetic and full of rotten shit. I can't tell what's worse, your hand that writes for MRR or the Dwarves lyrics. You are fucking with shit that you are totally ignorant about. You are about as punk as my fundamentalist Christian grandparents, but that's just my opinion. Oh yea, I bet you use Trojans as well as Mr. Mackaye, when your neighbors' dog feels up to it. Sorry about that last com- ment to all you animal rights activists. I hap- pen to be one too, but you probably don't care about that anyway, right? It seems as though you probably won't admit it, you probably ollow all those sarcastic \"punk rock\" rules you made up. Thanks for being the fascist of the month. Please get hit by a truck. You keep writing those nasty columns, so I can amuse myself by fucking with them. One more thing - Jello and Ian are as \"punk\" as it gets so far as I can see, and have contributed their souls and lives to it. I love them and what they're about. Their music and words have inspired and kept alive the fire in all of us. This is only my view, many may not feel the same way and thats fine, I don't care. Just don't fuck with people you can't hold a candle to. I Remember punk as law, anyone who shares the same feelings as above write me. Steve Richey/ 396 Syne St./ Lakeport, CA/ 95453 P.S. Please write me, Mr. Weasel, you fucked Nazi. Dear MRR: I'm writing to answer \"A Compas- S% sionate Person who Cannot Sign His ■.\"Name etc.'s\" letter. I'll do this point- by-point, so drag out issue #1 07 and follow along. 1f Several years ago, the Animal Liberation Front raided the lab of John Orem, a man with no medical training, destroyed his equipment and \"stole\" the cats he had been experimenting on. Contrary to \"person's\" let- ter s claims, the cats did not simply have to wear electrodes-the electrodes were insert- ed into their brains through holes drilled into their skulls. This produces results like \"pro- jectile vomiting'-hardly painless. The cats were sleep deprived by being forced to stand on a small platform over an ice bath. Lastly, Oram's published papers- after a decade of cat-killing, mention SIDS only twice, once to state thai his findings had nothing to do with Sudden Infant Death Syn- drome. It wasn't until the ALF forced him to defend himself that he grabbed the nearest baby and stood behind her-thus exploiting the tragic deaths of children as ruthlessly as he exploited cats. 2) \"Person\" says that Alex Pacheco staged the famous photograph of a monkey in a holding chair that appears on the \"This is Vivisection posters. This is a lie that first appeared in Washington Magazine, along with the rest of this story. Washington Maga- zine recently printed an apology. Taub, the vivisector in this case, cut the monkey's spi- nal cords so as to paralyze one arm. He then used painful electric shocks to try to force the monkey to use his/her injured arm. As for \"Persons\" assorted tidbits: PETA does have an annual \"Gala\" party. It's a major fundraiser & chance to thank whatev- er Congressmen have helped the animals, even a Tittle. Various celebrities donate their time & talent at the party. PETA's budget, last I checked, was $3 million a year, not the $2 million \"Person\" says. Yeah, that's a lot of cash, but it's nothing compared to the vivisection industry, not to mention the furriers, factory farmers, and the rest of the killing-animals-for-profit crowd. 50% of PETA employees , who work 60-20 hours each week, make less than $24,000 a year & Ingrid Newkirk makes nothing. Over 75% of PETA's budget last year wenttowards Research & Investigations, Pub- lic Outreach & special campaigns. Read Pe- ter Singer's Animal Liberation. Read Tom Regan's Case For Animal Rights.

I booked the snow a while ago and as soon as your last issue came out which had the piece about him getting arrest- ed my phone didn't stop ringing with com- plaints about me booking him and the band, I even started getting people calling me to ask what I thought about the Maxide Corporation thing. I bet you have received so many letters saying shit.

Just thought I'd take a minute ^™ to drop you a line and say thanks for all your work over the years with the mag and all and give you a high five and best wishes and all that crap for fhe future! Yeah, bizarre a in't it-this year marks ten . count 'em, years for my involvement with this 'scene\" via the Fixtures-if you can call it involvement; I mean we've been nothing but outsiders from the start to the present, but hey, that's show biz! Anyway, things really haven't gotten any better and there's little difference between this \"scene\" and the rest of the world anyway-and that's unfortunate- but we push ahead anyway, and go on with whatever we do, no big deal. MRR and all you've done has been quality and valuable, at the very least to me anyway. So I send you my thanks. Too bad I, like many others, am probably sending them a bit late, but here they are none-the-less! Enough babble, take care and take no shit as always! Kevin, The Fixtures Greetings Folks, Forthe first time ever, after reading #107, I've been prompted to write a letter to you lot. Why? \"Well, I guess, like many others, I was surprised/ saddened to read Tim's resignation column. I've always seen good ole Mr. Yo Mama in a very 'respectable light (for want of a better phrase). Not just for what he created with MRR, etc., but also because he's one of the rare species of 40+ years who still knows maximum rock n' roll when he hears it. I will miss his record reviews, from what I've heard he knows 'punk as fuck' more than anyone! Fuck! I hope I hold onto whatever it is that keeps the rebellious/ punk spirit alive as long as that. Perhaps if nothing else, he can be encouraged to continue writing columns? Hey, what's this? Another thing (& it seemed to infiltrate Tim's column) is this growing pessimistic virus about the current punk scene. Well, bollocks to that!! Listen, where I live there is no punk scene, no bands, no gigs, no zines, no mohawks (almost). It's always been like this. I can't look back and reminisce about the good old days cos there's no such fuckin thing. Out here, the punk scene is your bedroom. I can't help feeling that if all these \"The scene sucks\" punk rockers had no scene they'd soon realize how fullof shitthey are! To extend a quote from aforementioned column - \"if your scene sucks, it's only because you do!\" Fuck this negativity. I love life. I love punk!! And I love MRR. When I first came across it about 6 years ago, I was overwhelmed. Here it is, a well-made punk zine, by fans for fans, with commitment and integrity. I can't say it's perfect, but it sets standards, y'know. And for punks like me, it's a very important medium of communication- almost a punk rockbible!! (no, perhaps not...) Anyway, when you're surounded by jerks and the brainwashed, it's nice to have MRR as a forum for punk and a bit of intelligentthinking - at least I'm not alone! The Flipside merger was quite a surprise too (Iguess I'm not the onfy punk entity that's been fucked by the recession!) I'mverypleasedtohearyou're sticking to the no racist/ sexist/ fascist policy. A very important position that should not be compromised. , I still look forward to each new issue of MRR with as much, if not more, excitement than ever. Lastly, to all you shrtworkers. out here in the middle of nowhere (sort of) there is someone who really appreciates what you produce, (and you can bet your ass if I lived in Berkeley, I'd be part of it myself) -Your time is not wasted. Keep up the good work! Thanx. Neighbour Annoyer (Punkasf uckas always!) P.S. I have studied each 'Jeff Bale Column carefully. I have absolutely no idea which is the genuine item & judging by the contents - who cares! P.P.S. Just cos I've said some nice things does not mean I'll allow any head- swelling/ ego-boosting. Get back to work ya fuckers!!. Now back to our regular scheduled programming- Dear MRR and Readers, / Hello from the bustling metropolis of Baltimore! I am a 20- year old punk lesbian. I'm still 'in the closet'. It's really difficult, with no support. Because homosexuals cannot be recognized, I get to listen in on my friend's verbal gay basning. It's really discouraging. I have heard that some people realize the stupidity of their homophobia when they find out that one of every one I know is homophobic, or they say \"I'm not homophobic. I just don't like to be around gay people.\" What the fuck does that mean? Everyone seems to have learned ho- mophobia, from right-wing fundamentalist Christians, to the punks who claim to reject everything that the system' preaches. I don t see why a person's sexual orientation should bother other people. I may not like my friend's boyfriend, or I may think that she has bad taste, but that would have no effect on my relationship with her. So why should the fact that I would choose to go out with another female affect any of my friendships? I know that this has been said and will be said many times, but, wake up! We're just like anyone else, except for the effects that being rejected by society has. I hope that there are also letters from some homophobes in this issue- I'm really curious exactly what people find so threatening about us. I hate lying to my friends. I hate getting embarrassed and turning red when my fam- ily asks if I have a boyfriend yet, but the thought of alienating all of my friends and family scares the hell out of me. So what am I to do? -frustrated dyke in Baltimore, MD After reading your letter I only wish you had given me your address. Believe me, you are not alone. I remember when Homocore zine used to get scores of similar letters. It s so sad - all of these young queers who are just plain desperate for understanding. This is a pretty accurate reflection of the current state of queer youth outreach today. Christ, a few years ago, I could've written the same damn letter, almost word-for-word. You seem to be very confident in yourself, and I m glad that you re becoming aware of yourself, de- spite your surroundings. Really, just about every queer goes through this; hardly any- one has it easy. I hope this issue helps you realize that there is a life ahead of you. As far as I'm concerned, this issue is dedicated to you. And whatever decision you make on coming out, just remember that there is help out there for you. Don't suffer alone. If your friends can't handle being around queers, then they're not your friends. Period. Take some pride in yourself and read on. - Matt ^XX^. Dear MRR & Readers, CTSTjlC^* | am deeply saddened to tWAV/1 inform everyone that my best yVJlLj/ friend, Dumpster Dive partner, v vjC*^- and sjnger/leader of the Connecticut band, The Wussies— Jack Etes — passed away this week. Jack had fallen sick with pneumonia and with that and the combination of his blood disease, hemophilia, he took a turn for the worse. Jack was really into the music scene thing. He loved our kind of music and everything about it. Jack tried very hard with his band and our fanzine. Granted o.k., both were not the greatest, but a lot of people enjoyed both. He tried hard and some people wish they could take it as far as Jack did. Fame and fortune was not the important thing — having great fun came first with us. I feel really glad that we did all the things we did. Everybody who knew Jack would agree, he didn't have a bad bone in his body, he always meant well, and was a caring person with a good heart. So not to totally bum you out, I will tell a funny story about Jack. A few months ago we went into New York City with him and some friends to hear Lou Reed do spoken word piece of all his great songs and it was pretty cool. After the reading we hung out, trying to get a hold of Lou Reed and give him our zine. I guess because of things like the death of John Lennon and the countless acts of violence we read about in New York City, Lou has become a little scared of people. I guess I don't blame him. Anyway, Jack refused to leave until we could give Lou a couple of issues of Dumpster Dive fanzine. Lou Reed had a huge bodyguard and he threatened us bodily harm if we didn't leave. Jack stubbornly refused to leave and was being as annoying as possible. Finally we were kicked out by the bodyguard and janitor. Outside we went with a large group of people standing and waiting to take pictures and get autographs of Lou. Jack went up to Lou Reeds' limousine, opened the door with the driver inside waiting, and threw a bunch of Dumpster Dives inside. A large group of people saw this. The crowd roared, cheered and laughed for Jack because he had the balls to do this. Actually you really had to be there, but you get the_picture. It was really funny. We got Lou Reed to give us his autograph and I don't know if he ever read those fanzines Jack threw in his limo. But that's an example of how Jack was. He was a funny, great guy who did not like to give up. Life is a very fragile thing that we all take for granted. When something like this happens, it hurts. We will have a couple of kegs of beer as he wished a party to remember him. He was hard-core to the end. I will cherish all of our good fun times we experienced and I hope everyone who knew him does too. I will never forget Jack. I loved him very much and I will miss him very much. Jack Etes— Rest in peace. Peace and Love, John (The Bomb) Colletti/ DumpsterDive/74 Osborne Ave/ Norwalk, CT 06855 ' Beth Johnston, thanks for the great thoughts in MRR 1.06 on being an adult and married punk. My wife and I could relate to most everything you said. Many of your ideas deserve serious consideration by everyone in \"the scene\", especially those rolling through their early to mid-twenties, a time when so many people fade away into the mainstream. Your focus seemed to be on taking responsibility for everything you do in your daily life, and how that relates to being an adult punk interacting with this fucked up world that surrounds us. Being a responsible person is often confused with growing up\" or ■\"calming down.\" It ain't necessarily so. Being responsible is completely compatible with anger, rebellion, and radicalism. In fact, I would say they can be one in the same if you include things like political, social, and environmental awareness along with combating ignorance and intolerance etc. as being characteristics of a truly responsible person. After all, do the majority of people in the U.S. possess these characteristics? No way. That is what makes being responsible, rebellious. I'm not sayingthat most punks are responsible in those ways either, but I wish they were. About marriage, which you didn t say much about. Most people we meet cant believe it when we tell them we are married. \"People like us\" aren't supposed to be married. They ask us why we would do such a thing. It's really not a question that can be answered in a sentence or two, but I'll try to explain briefly. Yes, marriage can be a strange thing, and people do it tor a lot of goory reasons: money, status, legitimacy of sexuality, procreation, it's expected of them, etc. All of these things get camouflaged into the word love. Personally, we had been living together for a few years and we felt like marriage would be a further commitment to one another by acknowledging that this is the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. Oh yeah, did I mention love? We found nothing in marriage that would compromise our beliefs, as long as we did things our way. The ceremony was completely free from religion, performed by a liberal, Spanish- American, woman judge. (Are we PC or what?) I m not going to feed you any line about how you'll know when you have found the right person whenthey come along, statistics would prove me wrong. It takes work and commitment to avoid becoming a statistic. Remember that your relationship is just as \"legitimate\" regardless of whetheryou marry. Don't let the government, the church, schools, friends, or relatives tell you different. Thanks again Bethforthegreat column. I hope I was able to accurately expand on a couple of your ideas. There's obviously much more that could and should be said about these issues. Gosh, maybe we should start a network of responsible, radical, married punks! . , ,„_ _ J/Another Pair Of Shoes 'zine/ PO Box 300031/ Minneapolis, MN.

You'll get it— next month. This is the queer issue and there are queer questions to raise. Note 2: 1 originally wrote part of this col- umn for HOMOCOKE Magazine. They rejected it] PART ONE: QUEER'S OK, BUT GAY IS BAD I was madder than a butt-fuckee with diarrhea. Ms. Lilly tells me about the \"queer 7 ' issue. She wants me to \"do something special. \" I tell her. \"Just 'cause I fuck guys, doesn't make me a homo. Ask them! Homos don't like me.\" \"Don't worry, Mykel.\" She says, \"I'm not gonna let the homos steal queerdom from us.\" Bravo Ms. Lilly! Queer means queer — not \"gay.\" It means strange- not the norm. It means not Mr. & Ms. Straightahead. It means that the celibate girl with her clit pierced is queer. The head of the gay Republicans is not. The hetero who wears diapers under his Wall Street suit is queer. The Andrea Dworkin les- bosarenot. Ok. It's a tempting idea. Already too many folks think Jody roster and Tom Sellek are \"queer.\" Yeech! Ifqueermeans \"strange or different\" from the practicing norm, than I'm as queer as a mule in pajamas. If it means strange or different from people's actual sexuality, then I'm as straight as Ray Cappo. Ever since Freud stuck beard to inkwell, folks realized that everybody is sexual. Kids are born with sexual feelings toward every- thing. The cigar-suckingshrink called it \"poly- morphous prversity.\" Those feelings narrow down and focus with age. Hormones, family, social conditioning, create a \"sexual orienta- tion.\" This orientation is really a selective suppression of natural polymorpnous perver- sity. The real world is not divided between purse-carrying boys in bomber jackets and Warren Beatty. Girls don't have a choice be- tween Phyllis Shlafly and Holly Near. The real world contains a spectrum of sexuality. It lowers from the natural polymorphous per- verse through various levels ofrepression. Next to celibacy, the most restrictive is mono-sexual- ity. Homos and heteros are both guilty of monosexuality. BUT homos are more guilty. Here's why: In our culture, as we get older our per- spective narrows. If we're exposed to daytime TV and Basic Instinct, that narrowing leads to some form of heteroness. Those too weak or ignorant to break from the masses become bor- ing straight people. This narrowing gets even more specific. So there are boys who only like girls with big tits and girls who only like boys with hairy chests. These \"normal people\" don't think much about their orientation. It's the only way they know. They don't make it an identity. You never hear someone introduced himself, \"Hi, I'm Sam, a heterosexual.\"? OPINIONS EXPRESSED ARE SOLELY THOSK .OE ,THg ,.,. COLUMNISTS AND ARE NQT MRR . EPI.TORIAL POLICY On tine other hand, those who find their orientation narrowing to membersoftheirown sex have a more difficult time. Sometimes the \"normals\" ridicule them. In any case they have fewer examples of behavior to follow. You can't turn on Ivvcof Life and find a model homo to admire. Remembergay \"clones 7 \" They still haunt Christopher and Castro streets. It s the Marl- et, hiking boots and tight bluejcans. k>i S mr. it's the same with a flannel shirt and, usually, less of a mustache. Why are there clones? Well, when a simultaneously discover the label \"gay. ' They know their actions are not \"normal.\" They need to name their abnormality. \"Gay,\" sup- plies the name. But gay is more than just homosexual- it's a \"life style.\" Once someone adopts the label, they adopt that lifestyle. Now that clones are a dying breed, there are alternatives. Take the \"beards and dresses\" look (please!) Adopted by the \"Radical Faeries,\" it implies that homosexuality is \"feminine.\" ( Dresses a re, i n our cultu re, clothes for w omen A homosexual in a dress is therefore, less masculine than other sexual orientations.) This is exactly what society at large thinks. The so- called gender-fuckers do nothing more than reinforce the stereotypical view. They're as bad as tine Brando-biker homos. Those guys claim that homosexuality is MORE masculine than other sexua lities. Neither makes' the more radical claim— that it's HUMAN— partofALL sexuality. A novice reasons, \"if I like to sleep with boys, that must mean I should grow a mus- tache\" (or wear a dress). Often the new homo moves to New York or San Francisco or at least to his local gay ghetto. He makes his surroundings as homo- sexual as possible. But he goes further. He lias chosen a difficult course; a non- mainstream course; a course that can subject himself to ridicule; possibly physical danger. Like most people in danger, he tries to protect himself. He uses his homosexuality as both a shield and a badge or more — his identity. A homosexual who has become 'gay,\" surrounds himself with more and more gay accoutremonts. Sometimes he finds himself with more female than male friends. He grad- ually loses theability to bond \"non-erotically\" with other males. Old friends move away; a few because they're uncomfortable with his sexuality; more because they just don't fit in with his new \"life style.\" That narrowing circle of friends makes his life-style ever more one-sided. He lives in a mental as well as a physical ghetto. He builds walls around him to keep out the \"nonnals.\" Those who "
