Film Comment, io9, indiewire, Open Culture, flavorwire, a.o.\n\nWaiting for Godot (Roman Polanski)\n\nPolanski proposed a film adaptation of the play to Beckett, who politely refused to allow it. Beckett insisted that the play was not cinematic material and that an adaptation would destroy it. He asked for Polanski’s forgiveness and that the director not dismiss him as a “purist bastard.”\n\nWho Killed Bambi? (Russ Meyer, 1978)\n\nIntended as a punk rock version of A Hard Day’s Night, the film was to star the Sex Pistols. It was to be based on a screenplay by Roger Ebert and Malcolm McClaren. According to Ebert, \"McLaren claimed 20th Century-Fox read the screenplay and pulled the plug. This seems unlikely because the studio would not have green-lighted the film without reading the script. Meyer called me to say McLaren had made false promises of financing and was broke. The film's fate was sealed when Princess Grace, a member of the Fox board, said, \"We don't want to make another Meyer X film.\" Some footage was shot by Meyer, but not much, perhaps several days' worth, and it wound up in Julien Temple’s The Great Rock ’n’ Roll Swindle.\n\nA Confederacy of Dunces (John Waters, 1980s)\n\nAdaptation of the novel by John Kennedy Toole about a corpulent, flatulent medievalist. The role was considered for John Belushi, John Candy, and Chris Farley, all of whom died before anything could be realized. Waters, who for a time had lived half a block from Toole's mother (Thelma Ducoing), wanted the part for Divine before his death and pitched for the job of director, and lost it when the producer saw a photo of him, in his book Shock Value, visiting Manson Family member Charles 'Tex' Watson - who had killed one of the producer's best friends.\n\nVideo: CONFUSION. LECTURE BRUITÉE D'UN SCÉNARIO NON-RÉALISÉ DE JACQUES TATI\n\nConfusion (Jacques Tati)\n\nIn a media-obsessed future Paris, society is glued to communication technology and little distinction is made between fiction and reality. Tati was planning to collaborate on the film with the band Sparks, who were to play two American TV execs. Action centers around the mishaps within the studio facilities of fictive media conglomerate COMM. During the live broadcast of a scripted drama filled with stagy theatrics, a mistakenly loaded gun kills an off-screen Monsieur Hulot. The cameras keep rolling, with cast members discreetly stepping over the fresh cadaver during their scenes, while the crew scrambles to remove it from sight.\n\nKing Shot (Alejandro Jodorowsky)\n\nCo-produced by David Lynch, it was to star Asia Argento, Jeff Bridges, Marilyn Manson, and Udo Kier in a “metaphysical western set in a desert casino, featuring a man the size of King Kong and Marilyn Manson as a 300-year-old pope.” The film's storyboards are available here.\n\nWomen (Paul Verhoeven)\n\nTo be adapted from Charles Bukowski’s fictionalized account of his experiences (and frequent dissatisfaction) with sex and romance.\n\nThe Bells of Hell Go Ting-a-Ling-a-Ling (David Miller, 1966)\n\n'This was my first film role, co-starring with Gregory Peck, who was a huge movie star at the time. He was not well-cast as an English army Colonel — he repeatedly addressed me as 'Loo-tenant': and when I repeatedly corrected his pronunciation (in UK we say 'Left-tenant'), the director David Miller told me to shut up. 'Never forget Ian, Great Britain is only 5% of the world market.'\" The story was that a squad of British airmen attempt to smuggle plane parts into enemy territory with the aim of reassembling them and attacking German targets. It was a disaster. After five weeks filming, the summer was invaded by early snow which was forecast to persist through the following six months. The shooting was already behind schedule so Mirisch cut their losses by abandoning the film and sending us home — me with 4000 pounds.'-- Ian McKellen\n\nTo the White Sea (Joel & Ethan Coen, 2001)\n\nThe Coens wrote a nearly dialogue-free adaptation of James Dickey’s 1993 novel about a WWII American fighter pilot who, shot down on a mission over Tokyo in 1945, murders his way through the outskirts of the fire-bombed city. Brad Pitt was set to play the brutal protagonist, with Jeremy Thomas producing. The Coen Brothers' decision to actually shoot the film in Japan proved to be the project’s downfall as it already had been a struggle for the Coens to convince 20th Century Fox to take this violent, experimental movie on.\n\nLuchino Visconti in France in 1971 scouting locations for 'A la recherche du temps perdu'\n\nÀ la recherche du temps perdu (Luchino Visconti, 1969)\n\nIn 1969 Visconti commissioned a script by Suso Cecchi d’Amico. Visconti conducted rigorous research around Paris and the Normandy coast. The usual collaborators were retained: Nicole Stéphane (who owned the rights), photographer Claude Schwartz, costume designer Piero Tosi, and set designer Mario Garbuglia. Silvana Mangano was to play the Duchesse de Guermantes, Alain Delon or Dustin Hoffman the narrator-protagonist Marcel, and Helmut Berger the homosexual protégé of Baron Charlus, Charlie Morel. The proposed four-hour film boasted a huge cast and an accordingly huge budget for which financing could not be secured. Laurence Olivier and Marlon Brando were considered for role of Charlus.\n\nIn a Dream of Passion (Monte Hellman)\n\nHellman’s adaptation of Alain Robbe-Grillet’s novel, La Maison de Rendez-Vous, about an American’s experiences in a Hong Kong brothel, was to be produced by Roger Corman.\n\nBatman-Dracula (Andy Warhol)\n\nThought to be the first campy portrayal of Batman, Andy Warhol directed the film without the permission of DC Comics and only showed it at his own exhibitions. Warhol's friend, the appropriately named Gregory Battcock, played Batman, while Baby Jane Holtzer played Catwoman. While the film itself is unavailable, some scenes are shown in the documentary Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis. Smith played Dracula.\n\nA Scanner Darkly (Charlie Kaufman)\n\nKaufman said he wrote this script soon after Being John Malkovich: \"I got it as an assignment. There was a director attached, an Australian woman named Emma(-Kate) Croghan. She had just directed an independent comedy [Strange Planet] and she was attached to the project by Jersey Films and then they brought me on.\" And then the studio lost interest. Kaufman's script is easy to find online, but Kaufman says you should just read the book instead. \"What's the point if you're going to read the book? Certainly my version doesn't offer anything that the book doesn't! At the time, I felt like I was trying to do something that was respectful of the Dick book. I felt like the movies coming out based on his books had nothing to do with his books.\"\n\nTechnically Sweet (Michelangelo Antonioni)\n\nThe director worked on this screenplay in the late Sixties and envisioned Jack Nicholson in the lead role as a man lost in the Amazon wilderness after surviving a plane crash. Some production stills from the unrealized film are available here.\n\nSuffer or Die (Michelangelo Antonioni)\n\nScripted by Tonino Guerra and Anthony Burgess, it was to star Debra Winger alongside Mick Jagger or Richard Gere or Giancarlo Giannini as an architect. Amy Irving was cast at one point as a Catholic novice.\n\nFreud (John Huston/Jean-Paul Sartre)\n\nIn 1958, legendary director John Huston decided to make a film about the life of Sigmund Freud. Having met Jean-Paul Sarte in 1952 during the filming of Moulin Rouge, Huston felt the philosopher would be the ideal person to script the Freud film, since Sartre knew Freud’s work so well and since Huston surmised that he would have “an objective and logical approach.” Ironically both Sartre and Huston considered themselves anti-Freud for largely the same reason: Sartre because as a Communist he believed the role of the psychoanalyst was limited and of little social importance. For his part Huston felt that psychoanalysis was an indulgence for bored house wives and the problem children of the rich while the “movers and shakers”’ were too busy for it and those that most needed it couldn’t afford it. First, Sartre delivered a modest 95-page treatment. This, however, became a 300-page draft in 1959 that Huston calculated would produce an unacceptable five-hour-long film. When Huston and Sartre met in person in Galway to find a way to cut the screenplay down to a reasonable length, their working relationship was less than cordial. In Huston’s recollection, Sartre was “as ugly as a human being can be.” Sartre’s remembrance is hardly more flattering of Huston: \"…in moments of childish vanity, when he puts on a red dinner jacket or rides a horse (not very well) or counts his paintings or tells workmen what to do. Impossible to hold his attention five minutes: he can no longer work, he runs away from thinking.\" After their Galway meeting, during which Huston tried and failed to hypnotize Sartre, the philosopher attempted another revision, but this time, he sent Huston an even longer draft, for an eight-hour film. At this point, Huston gave up on Sartre.\n\nThe Story (Jean-Luc Godard)\n\nIn the late 1970s Jean-Luc Godard became obsessed with the story of Siegel and planned to make a movie about him. He wrote a screenplay called, simply, \"The Story\", and planned to cast Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton in the Siegel and Hill roles. He dropped this plan when Keaton lost interest and then turned his attention to Every Man for Himself (1980) as his return to commercial filmmaking.\n\nKaleidoscope (Alfred Hitchcock, 1964-67)\n\nAfter watching Antonioni’s Blow-Up, Hitchcock felt he was a century behind the Italians in technique. He asked the novelist Howard Fast to sketch a treatment about a gay, deformed serial killer. Pleased with the results, Hitchcock composed a shot list with over 450 camera positions and shot an hour’s worth of experimental color tests. MCA/Universal were disgusted by the script and immediately canceled the project, reducing Hitchcock to tears. See the images, parts of the script, and test footage.\n\nBunuel in Mexico researching A Sumptuous Ceremony\n\nA Sumptuous Ceremony (Luis Buñuel)\n\nAt four o'clock one afternoon Luis Buñuel decided that he would make no more films. He was staying in the spa at San Jose Purua in southwest Mexico where, for more than twenty years, Buñuel had gone to write his scripts. It is a semitropical paradise set in a green canyon — a bit too hot, in truth, for Buñuel liked rain, fog, the north. The screenplay was for a film to be called A Sumptuous Ceremony, in homage to Andre Breton, who defined eroticism as \"a sumptuous ceremony in an underground passage.\" From the outset the watchwords were \"terror\" and \"eroticism.\" Bunuel imagined a young girl in a prison cell receiving a visit from a phantom bishop; a trap door led to an underground passageway and to a boat filled with explosives for blowing up the Louvre museum. The script was never finished. Buñuel had barely arrived in San Jose Purua when he felt unwell, ill at ease (this was 1979 and he was therefore seventy-nine years old). He spoke of some \"menace,\" and at four o'clock in the afternoon he announced that his life as a filmmaker was over.\n\nThe Conquest of Mexico (Werner Herzog)\n\nPlanning to take the perspective of the conquered Aztecs, Herzog said the film would be so expensive that it could only be made with the backing of a Hollywood studio. \"I am currently working on a film about the conquest of Mexico and Francis Ford Coppola is involved,\" Herzog said at the time. \"But I am not making a Hollywood film. Somehow it will still be a Bavarian film. I have nothing against what they do in Hollywood. It doesn’t bother me. Let them do it.”\n\nDavid Lynch storyboard for Ronnie Rocket\n\nRonnie Rocket (David Lynch)\n\nA comedy starring a reanimated dead teen, set in a rundown, industrial future. Screenplay available here.\n\nOne Saliva Bubble (David Lynch, 1987)\n\nAn early project of Lynch and Mark Frost written almost a year before the Twin Peaks pilot. A saliva bubble from a country bumpkin working at a top-secret military base gets into a weapons system, causing the device to fire upon Newtonville, Kansas, and prompting the townsfolk to switch identities with one another. Lynch called it “an out-and-out wacko dumb comedy”; Martin Short and Steve Martin were initially attached to star. Screenplay is available here.\n\nHeartbeat in the Brain (Amanda Feilding)\n\nAfter shaving her hairline, donning a floral cap and constructing protective eyewear from a pair of sunglasses and medical tape, 27-year-old art student Amanda Feilding injects herself with an anesthetic, peels the skin from her forehead with a scalpel, and begins to drill into her own frontal bone with a foot operated dentist's drill in this documentary/art piece about the \"science\" of trepanation. A reviewer who saw the film in 1978 reported that when Feilding finally drills through the bone and grins victoriously as blood spurts down her face, several members of the audience fainted, \"dropping off their seats one by one like ripe plums.\" The film hasn't been seen in 44 years. It is assumed that Feilding has a copy.\n\nPincushion (John Carpenter)\n\nPostapocalyptic odyssey was to star Cher, whose character must deliver a life-saving serum to Salt Lake City. John Raffo scripted.\n\nHu-Man (Jérôme Laperrousaz)\n\nAn actor (Terence Stamp, playing himself) is placed in a series of dangerous situations, while his fear is broadcast to the television audience. Their emotional reactions will determine whether he is sent into the future, or the past. Directed by Jérôme Laperrousaz, a highly elusive figure whose other films include the almost equally obscure documentary Amougies (Music Power - European Music Revolution) and the Bob Marley-starring musical Third World, and co-starring Jeanne Moreau, Hu-Man won the Trieste Festival of Science Fiction Films in 1976, but has fallen into obscurity, and apparently no prints exist.\n\nL’Ailleurs immédiat (Jean-Pierre Gorin)\n\nIn the director’s first solo film, Gorin played the lead, reciting passages from Nietzsche’s Genealogy of Morals while getting tattooed, and masturbating on a Paris window ledge. The film was reportedly destroyed by the producers before completion, after the drug arrest of the lead actress.\n\nThe Tourist (Claire Noto)\n\nNoto’s script, started in 1980, has often been cited as similar to Blade Runner, and its moody, atmospheric, and unexpectedly sexual overtones also suggested the alienation and tragic nature of The Hunger and the exotic mien of the creatures from Ridley Scott’s Alien. It languished in development hell forever, while its ideas proved so popular that it was plundered time and again, most blatantly by Men In Black which mostly lifted the concept wholesale, added heroic human agents as the leads, jettisoned the existential woe of estranged aliens, trapped and in-hiding on Earth, and of course made it a comedy. Legendary visualist H. R. Giger created a series of alien designs in the early 1980s and they, like the script, were much too sexualized and unsettling for the execs who were trying to grapple with an unwieldy story of morality, corruption, xenophobia, humanity and imprisonment, both physical and psychological. Citing influences such as Fellini and Antonioni, Noto once said of the screenplay “I wanted to portray sexual agony and ecstasy in a way I’d never seen before, and science fiction seemed like the arena.” But in development hell she remained, though briefly flirting with Francis Coppola’s Zoetrope Studios, before they went broke (legal problems began here, as another producer claimed she co-owned the option). Noto’s difficult nature saw her kicked off her own creation, which then spent years in the studio system (Universal, WB, Paramount, Joel Silver all being involved) as it was overdeveloped into something less nihilistic and more homogenized. And also, bland. In the end, it was a dark independent movie that should have stayed that way. Unfortunately, the Fox Searchlights of the world didn’t exist yet, thus the only option for the project was the studio world where it just didn't fit. HR Giger's conceptual drawings for the film are available here.\n\nThe Corrections (Noah Baumbach, 2012)\n\nScott Rudin was to produce this HBO miniseries adaptation of Jonathan Franzen’s novel. Ewan McGregor, Chris Cooper, Dianne Wiest, Maggie Gyllnehaal, Greta Gerwig, and Rhys Ifans were cast and shooting began before HBO cancelled the project. According to Baumbach, \"We shot a pilot, but we didn't shoot a whole pilot, even. It was never finished.”\n\nNapoleon (Stanley Kubrick, 1969-70)\n\nA biopic on Napoleon set to be made just after the success of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Kubrick was so enthusiastic to make the project that he confessed to identifying with Bonaparte down to the way he ate his food. Jack Nicholson was slated to play the title character, but when corporate changes hit MGM, Kubrick lost the approval.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings (Stanley Kubrick)\n\nIn the late 1960s, The Beatles worked for a year on a project in which they would star in an adaptation of Tolkien's novel. The plan was that Paul McCartney would play Frodo Baggins with Ringo Starr backing him up in the role of Sam Gamgee. George Harrison would don a hat and grow his beard a little longer to take on the role of Gandalf and John Lennon decided that for him only the role of Gollum would do. They even went as far as to Stanley Kubrick to direct the film. Kubrick did consider it, citing the sheer immensity of the book as a reason for his declining The Beatles' offer. The project finally died due to the increasing animosity between band members.\n\nThe Moviegoer (Terrence Malick)\n\nAdaptation of Walker Percy’s novel about a Korean War vet turned stockbroker whose traumatic experiences cause him to search for life’s deeper meaning, heading for New Orleans. Malick abandoned the idea after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city, where the film was to take place.\n\nThe English Speaker (Terrence Malick)\n\nThis highly personal passion project was based on the pioneering study by “talking cure” proponent and Freud forerunner Josef Breuer of 1880s psychoanalysis patient Anna O, a hysteric given to melancholia, personality changes and a form of aphasia in which she could understand only German, but replied in English, French or Italian. The screenplay, according to producer Bobby Geisler, one of the very few people ever allowed to read it, was “as if [Malick] had ripped open his heart and bled his true feelings onto the page,” while author Peter Biskind described it as “The Exorcist as written by Dostoevsky.” But perhaps because he felt so passionately, the project got sucked into the whirl of controversy and recrimination that surrounded the tortuous process of getting The Thin Red Line to screens. Malick in fact held the finishing of his war elegy for ransom, demanding in perpetuity rights over The English Speaker to ensure no one but him could direct it. The producers held out, though, and in the dust cloud thrown up by the eventual breakdown of the relationship between Malick, Geisler, and The Thin Red Line producer Mike Medavoy, it’s hard to see exactly where the rights landed.\n\nMona Lisa (Larry Clark)\n\nRemake of Neil Jordan’s 1986 underworld thriller to star Eva Green and Mickey Rourke, or Rosario Dawson and Hayden Christensen.\n\nMaldoror (Alberto Cavallone)\n\nThis is a holy grail amongst film collectors, matched only by The Day the Clown Cried. There was no one more qualified to adapt Comte de Lautréamont's infamous novel than director Alberto Cavallone, who made a number of grotesque/erotic art films, which were in vogue at the time. Cavallone's adaptation was completed, though never publically screened, making the film as impenetrable as its source material. Finding a copy would be, in the words of the Comte himself, as \"beautiful as the chance encounter of a sewing machine and an umbrella on a dissecting table.\" A detailed account of the film's history by Mike Kitchell is available here.\n\nLa Belle vie (Robert Bresson)\n\nBresson received “advance-on-box-office” French funding in 1986 for the project.\n\nGenesis (Robert Bresson, 1963)\n\nA lavish adaptation of the Book of Genesis that Bresson wanted and tried to make off and on for 35 years. The story would have had to span the creation of the universe all the way to the building of the Tower of Babel. And back in the day, Bresson didn’t have Terrence Malick’s VFX team for “The Tree of Life.” Dino De Laurentiis had agreed to finance, but Bresson abandoned the project only to take it up again and then abandon it a second time. He once said that one of the frustrations with the production was that he couldn’t make his animal performers do as they were told. He would try to mount the project one more time in 1985, thanks to \"an exceptional pre-production grant” he had received, but this attempt failed too.\n\nGershwin (Martin Scorsese, 1981)\n\nPaul Schrader and John Guare wrote drafts of the script for this biopic about the American composer George Gershwin. Lavish production numbers of Gershwin’s works were to be related to scenes from his life as discussed by Gershwin on a psychologist’s couch. The movie was owed to Warner Bros., but they were eventually interested in another Scorsese picture (they also were skeptical about the cost/return prospects on \"Gershwin\"). “Ultimately, when it was time to do Gershwin, they turned to me and said, 'We'd rather have one on Dean Martin,'” Scorsese said circa 2004. The problem was, while Tom Hanks was eyed for the lead of Dino (Martin’s birth name), and Nick Pileggi (the author and screenwriter of Goodfellas and Casino) was going to write the script, that one wasn’t even started, while Gershwin was ready to roll. WB wouldn’t budge. The project was finally canceled for good due to complications with rights and the fear that a young audience would not understand or care about Gershwin.\n\nFrankenstein (David Cronenberg)\n\nCanadian film producer Pierre David approached Cronenberg in the '80s with the idea and the filmmaker offhandedly said yes. \"He said, ‘Listen, tell me what you think… David Cronenberg's Frankenstein?\" Cronenberg recalled of the producer's pitch. He replied “Sounds good to me. What about poor Mary Shelley?” And the next thing Cronenberg knew, there was a full-page ad in Variety touting, “David Cronenberg’s Frankenstein.” Evidently, Cronenberg did think about it a little bit. “It would be a more rethinking than a remake. For one thing I’d try to retain Shelley’s original concept of the creature being an intelligent, sensitive man. Not just a beast,” he is quoted as saying in the collection of interviews Cronenberg on Cronenberg, but, beyond that nothing seemed to happen.\n\nMaster of Lies (Nicolas Roeg)\n\nThis modern-day Jekyll-and-Hyde story was to star Donald Sutherland as a celebrated author who suffers from attacks of blindness. A story of parallel protagonists in which one man’s destructive fascination for another masks his desire to become him. Jamie Sives and Shirley Henderson were to co-star, with Eddie Dick producing.\n\nDumbo 2 (Walt Disney Studios)\n\nDumbo 2 was to be a direct-to-video sequel. It would of taken place a day or so after Dumbo ended. Now that Dumbo isn’t considered a freak (as he’s bringing in major bank for the circus) he’s made a group of super cool and hip friends. The premise: Dumbo and his circus buddies have to figure their way out of the big city after the circus train accidentally leaves them there. When John Lasseter became the Creative Director for Disney, he put a stop to all Disney sequels. Because instead of introducing children to the classics like intended, the sequels often tarnished the spirit of the original films. And it’s not surprising that Lasseter wouldn’t want the same thing to happen to his favorite film. The sequel was so far along that a “behind the scenes” trailer was actually released.\n\nMaldoror (Kenneth Anger, 1952)\n\nA film based on the work of proto-surrealist poet Comte de Lautréamont. Production never went past test footage and rehearsals with ballet dancers for the film from the companies of Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas and the Ballets de Paris of Roland Petit. The footage and information about the film are lost.\n\nSpike Jonze Harold & The Purple Crayon Test Film\n\nHarold and The Purple Crayon (Spike Jonze)\n\nThe film was an adaptation of an adaptation of Crockett Johnson's novel Harold & The Purple Crayon. Jonze worked on the movie for a year and half, but said by that time the vision of the movie had veered off course from its original aims, due to studio notes and interference. \"I wanted it to be almost like this silent animation, going back and forth between live action and animation,\" he said, but after 18 months it had transformed into something else. \"When we finally got the plug pulled I got this amazing sense of relief.\" Jonze and his team took a giant 6-foot Purple Crayon replica that was made during development and pitched it off a six story roof in downtown Los Angeles in an anti-form of celebration. \"We watched it shatter and I was just so relieved. And I realized over the course of a year and a half, I'd let the studio anxiety—'It's gotta be funny,''It's gotta have snappier dialogue,''This is too sad,''This is too melancholy'— and it happened millimeter by millimeter. A year and a half later I realized this is so far away from what I originally wanted to do.\"\n\nThe Idiot (Andrei Tarkovsky, 1986)\n\nThroughout the 1970s, Tarkovsky tried and failed to make a film version of Dostoyevsky's novel The Idiot. According to Tarkovsky's younger sister, Marina Tarkovskaya, adapting the novel was a lifelong dream and the state-funded and controlled Russian government (who had to approve all such movies) would never let him make it and kept stringing him along. \"Andrei dreamed about filming [it], but they casually told him: 'You are too young and inexperienced. Let some time pass!,\" she told the Voice Of Russia in 2012. “In the end, they kept feeding him with promises for 10 years, and that cherished dream of his life was never realized. Let me stress that Andrei was never a dissident, but the leaders of the USSR still perceived him as a stranger, a person with internal freedom, that was what they could not forgive.\" An August 1983 letter from a Russian Deputy Chairman, confirms that Tarkovsky had signed a contract to write an Idiot screenplay for Russian film studio Mosfilm, but in an 1984 Italian press conference, Tarkovsky declared he would never return to the home country. He then passed away three years later at the age of 54.\n\nWhere the Wild Things Are (John Lasseter)\n\nIn 1983, future Pixar honcho and director John Lasseter directed a 30-second film test of Maurice Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are, which Disney then owned the rights to and were planning to make into an animated film. Lasseter was asked to do an experiment to see if it would be feasible to hybridize hand-drawn character animation with 3D backgrounds. Studio heads decided the technique was \"too expensive\" and \"what they do on Futurama,\" and Lasseter was fired shortly after.\n\nCocaine (Rainer Werner Fassbinder, 1980)\n\nFassbinder said of his flashback-centered film based on Pitigrilli’s 1921 novel: “Cocaine freezes the brain, freeing one’s thoughts of anything inessential, and thereby liberating the essential, the imagination, concentration, and so on. This freezing of the brain . . . will be expressed in the film as follows: everything visible will appear covered with a sort of hoarfrost, glittering ice, whether in winter or summer; glasses and windows will covered with ice flowers, and with all the interior shots in the studio, even in summertime, the actors’ breath will be visible, as is usually the case only when it’s bitter cold outside.” This film was supposed to be a big budget production. It had an announcement at the festival in Cannes in May 1982, which Fassbinder and the producer attended. The problem was that because Fassbinder’s script was so big (about 600 pages) the producer asked him to think about shortening it. Since Fassbinder wasn’t in the mood to cut it quickly, he proposed to shoot other films first. He died without ever going back to it.\n\nDracula (Ken Russell)\n\nA “sex-propelled” comic script was written in 1978 as a star vehicle for Mick Fleetwood. The aesthetic was to draw on Aubrey Beardsley (an artist admired by this version of the Count, an arts philanthropist).\n\nGiraffes on Horseback Salad (Salvador Dalí)\n\nThe screenplay was written for the Marx Brothers. It was never produced because MGM thought it would be too surreal for them. Harpo also did not find it funny enough for the group. The film's storyline is available here.\n\nCleo (Steven Soderbergh, 2009)\n\nSoderbergh envisioned a 3-D rock musical about Cleopatra with songs by Robert Pollard, starring Catherine Zeta-Jones. Ray Winstone was signed to play Julius Caesar, and Hugh Jackman was to play her lover. \"It's like an Elvis musical in a way,\" Soderbergh said of it at the time. \"It's not serious. I mean it's historically pretty accurate but it's sort of like Viva Las Vegas meets Tommy.\" As of late 2013, Soderbergh announced he was reimagining the project as a Broadway musical.\n\n*\n\np.s. Hey. So, later today I'm heading off to the German city of Halle to spend a couple of days doing early work on and rehearsals of Gisele Vienne's and my new, upcoming theater piece. As usual when I'm out of Paris, you'll get rerun posts, specifically tomorrow through Thursday. But, unusually, I should be able to do the p.s. every day during that time, barring unexpected internet problems where I'm staying and/or currently unplanned early morning rehearsals. So, expect things below the posts to happen normally. If one of the next three posts does surprise us all by lacking a proper p.s., know that it'll probably be for one of the aforementioned reasons. ** Empty Frame, Hi, man. Well, I haven't read 'ASN' yet, but I think it's that a sub-current of a lot of his work was made the current. And, true enough, you're right: 'ASN' was the best selling R-G novel in France in decades. Oh, shit, the underground filmmakers tips. I'll have nothing to do on the plane tonight other than paging through the new issue of The Wire, so I'll make a list then, sorry. I'm so happy that I've never read Andrew Sullivan that I know of and barely know what he's supposed to be. ** David Ehrenstein, Ah, but the French secretly love to be shocked and outraged, and its writers know that, and R-G actually managed to trigger that impulse, which isn't so easy. Thanks re: the R-G post, and, yeah, Catherine was/always is a regal thing. I'll check out that Richard Kramer book, thanks! ** Sypha, Ha ha, well, feel free to counter-program the Robbe-Grillet post with a JK Rowling Day, if you like. That would slip an interesting ice cube down the blog's pants. One literary agent reject is pre-par for the course. Ask anybody. Keep on it. Cool about the 10th possible story. No, I haven't played Kyte's game. I really want to do that. Thanks a lot for the reminder. ** Kier, Hi, Kier! Me too about the book. It's on its way to me, and I'm chomping. The Chris thing is a performance work inspired by this place, the blog, you guys, my doings, etc., masterminded by the great man himself. That's all I know so far, but I think everyone here is going to be invited to contribute ideas and such to the work, so, yeah, it seems like it's going to be really exciting! The auditions went really great. I think we have a bunch of the cast in place. We're going to look at the footage we shot of them later this week and start cementing the roles and stuff. How was your weekend? Lots of love to you. ** les mots dans le nom, Hi. I really look forward to reading the book and getting to say something about it, and it's awesome that Mike's thoughts are already on their way to all of us! The auditions went as well as we had hoped. All is very well. Thanks! I can't remember if I've read that Sollers piece. Hm, I'm going to try to find it and, if I haven't, I definitely will. Thank you for alerting us to it and for talking so wonderfully about it. ** Tosh Berman, Hi, Tosh. You have the best street, so that book is a lucky dog. True, what you said about the conservatism now. It is the weirdest time. I just read this interesting essay somewhere about 'the new PC' and why it's happening and why the Left is the realm that's propagating it, but, unfortunately, I don't remember where I saw it. ** Mikel Motorcycle, Hi, Mikel. I think you might be right with that little masterpiece attribution. I pulled it out again this weekend, thanks to you, and was more insinuated by it than ever. Beautiful thoughts/writing on it. Really. A super pleasure, and, yeah, totally resonant with me. No, I haven't seen the 'Dune' doc yet. It hits theater here soon. Jodorowsky's stuff is really singular. The early few are especially strong, maybe 'The Holy Mountain' most. It's interesting/weird: when I saw them back at the time they were released, I liked them, but they had this heavy hippie/trippy contemporary infection that was kind of hard to take, for me, but, seen nowadays, that stuff is pretty much drained off, and I think they look much more amazing out of their original context, or maybe I mean in the pure context in which they were made and for which he intended them. ** Magick mike, Hi, Mike. So lucky you re: the early ARC. So majorly excited to read your doozy of a review. If you remember, alert me/us to where it ends up, if you don't mind, and I'l keep my eyes and fingers peeled for it in any case. Just read your piece in Plinth and really liked it a lot. Kudos! Fantastic about your column at Entropy. Bookmarked. And I'll greedily read that two-parter the minute I am able. Everyone, the supreme writer (and d.l.) magic mike aka Mike Kitchell has begin writing a column @ Entropy Magazine, and, well, here he is: 'i've started writing a weekly column at Entropy Mag, and I just finished a two-parter addressing Bataille, Blanchot & Duvert in how they all severely revised (cut in half) significant texts. part one, part two.' It's extremely highly recommended that you click those links and go read Mike's always incredible text, ideas, thoughts. I would have been pretty shocked if 'ASN' was Bataille-an. Take care, man, and thanks a lot. ** Steevee, Hi. Yeah, it seemed pretty safe to assume that Aronofsky + $130 mil + Russell Crowe + The Bible was not going to be a game-changer, or at least not in a positive direction. ** Paul Curran, Hi, Paul! Got your email. It's perfect! I've set it up, and it's set to go on the 14th. Thank you so, so, so much! ** Bill, Hi, Bill. By 'in the Whitney', do you mean in the Biennial? If so, no, strangely, I don't think I knew that, and, wow, that's a great and deserving thing, if so. Ottinger's stuff is definitely worth testing out at the very least. Ooh, pix of Cambodia by you. I'll be there gawking as soon as I am humanly able. Everyone, do you want to see photos of Cambodia snapped by the superb artist and d.l. Bill (Hsu)? Of course you do, right? Here. ** _Black_Acrylic, Hi, Ben. Hope you like 'MC', and I suspect you will. That is a really good interview with Jeff. Everyone, _Black_Acrylic alerts all of to a really good, smart interview with the one and only Jeff 'Mira Corpora' Jackson aka the one and only Chilly Jay Chill over @ The Quietus. Excellent reading for all kinds of reasons. So please go here. ** Torn porter, Yo, Torn! Welcome to the extended hood, man! We should get a coffee for sure duh. I'll be back in Paris at the end of the week. Let's sort it out. Have a blast in the meantime if not even forever! ** Zach, Hi, Z. Yeah, yeah, good thinking there, yeah. I haven't read the actual R-G novel yet, but, yeah, I trust and share your entrance ideas. I vaguely remember that part of 'Ulysses'. Or vaguely until you referenced it, and now it's blooming again. Exactly, about connections. Really great thoughts, man, thank you! ** Chilly Jay Chill, Hi, Jeff. Really excellent Quietus interview. You said great things. Rachel K. is a friend of mine, so I don't say much in this context, but I totally agree with you. The auditions went really well, thanks. The Fest sounds nice, fun. I've met Vollman a few times, and we've talked on the phone. I read with him twice. That 'kind and gentle affect, an almost aw shucks quality' is really him, I think, not only when he's performing. Like him a lot. Yeah, I'll tell you about the script, not today, but soon. Zac and I are in the heat of conceptualizing and writing it now, so it'll be easier and more accurate to talk about in the next couple of weeks when we've nailed things down more. ** Misanthrope, Aw, yikes, about the mix-up, but it's cool to imagine LPS watching it while you typed. And, yeah, fingers crossed and mum's the word until the LPS returns news becomes factual. Well, for sure, we'll sort out a day that's great for you and fine for me re: you coming over here for a day. Shouldn't be a problem at all. Great, great! ** Rewritedept, Hi. It's available now, not even nowish. Auditions went great. Auctions, ha ha, good old spellcheck and good old my hurried, apparently non-detailed last p.s. check for mistakes. Really glad the Cobain gig went so well. If there end up being pix, fill us in, yeah? My weekend was good, yeah. Thanks, buddy. ** Okay. Unmade movies, a bunch of them, for your delectation or whatever. Like I said, you'll get a hopefully fun rerun post tomorrow and, barring the unforeseen, I'll be here to talk back to you like almost always. See you then.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nRerun: G.B. Jones Day (orig. 11/10/07)\n\n----\n\nA crash course\n\nGB Jones helped start the homocore scene in Toronto which later inspired the worldwide queer punk movement of the late 80s and early 90s. She was in the seminal, pioneering queercore band Fifth Column, to which current bands like The Hidden Cameras, Kids On TV, Xiu Xiu, and Lesbians On Ecstasy still pay tribute. She is an internationally shown visual artist. In 1996, the New York gallery Feature Inc. released a book of Jones' drawings, and other artwork, entitled G.B. Jones, edited by Steve Lafreniere. Although widely available in the U.S. and Europe, copies were seized at the Canadian border and it was officially banned in Canada. A twenty year retrospective of her drawings, The Power and the Glory, was held in Toronto in 2005. With Bruce la Bruce, she founded and co-edited the first and arguably most important queer punk zine, JD's, in 1985. She has directed a number of underground no-budget Super 8 films. Her best known work is The Yo-Yo Gang, a 30 minute 'exploitation' movie about girl gangs that has gained significant cult status even though it, like most of her films, has rarely been screened. She has starred in several underground films including Bruce la Bruce's first feature No Skin Off My Ass. She lives and works mysteriously in Toronto.\n\n----\n\nFilms\n\nThe Lollipop Generation (1993 - ?): This legendary, unfinished film, almost fifteen years in the making, about the lives of underaged porn stars is roughly to Queer Cinema what Orson Welles''The Other Side of the Wind' is to, well, Cinema. Eternally in progress and always purportedly near completion, its current status is unknown. The artists Scott Treleaven and Paul P, who appear in the film, have confirmed that scenes were being shot by Jones as recently as 2002. A rough, short early draft of the film featuring footage shot in the early 90s has occasionally been screened at film festivals. In addition to Treleaven and P., the cast of 'TLG' includes Jena Von Br_cker, Johnny Noxzema, Vaginal Creme Davis, Caroline Azar, Mark Ewert, Karen Chapelle, Rachel Pepper, Diana Donato, Mitchell Watkins, and G.B. Jones.\n\nTrailer: 'The Lollipop Generation'\n\nThe Yo-Yo Gang (30 minutes; 1992): This 'no budget film' follows the exploits of two girl gangs, the \"Yo-Yo Gang\" and the \"Skateboard Bitches\", as a gangwar erupts between them. The tag line for the film reads: \"Gang girls frequently out-curse, out-fight and out-sex every boys' gang around\". The theme song, \"Yo-Yo\" is performed by Fifth Column and the film also features songs by Human Ashtrays and by Anti-Scrunti Faction. The soundtrack, including these bands and songs, was a cassette tape only release on Bitch Nation Tapes. Cast: Jena von Brucker, Anita Smith, Beverly Breckenridge, Suzy Sinatra, Caroline Azar, Leslie Mah, Tracy, Candy, Mark Frietas, and G.B. Jones.\n\nTrailer: 'The Yo-Yo Gang'\n\nThe Troublemakers (45 minutes; 1990): The film is equally fact and fiction, documentary and performance, home movie and narrative - the line is blurred and distinctions meaningless. Shot in the condemned home of director G.B. Jones and lead actors Caroline Azar and Bruce laBruce, the total cost of the film was the price of 7 cartridges, 3 minutes in length, of Super 8 film plus developing and transfer to video with a one-to-one ratio. There are no outtakes. GB Jones: '“We were all really poor so I decided to make a film about what our lives were like, to really honestly portray how we were getting by. So, on one level it’s a document of how people living on the margins of society manage to exist. But on another level, I wanted the film to capture the dichotomy between how society views people like us and how we choose to be portrayed on film.'\n\nTrailer: 'The Troublemakers'\n\nVisit GB Jonestown at Youtube\n\nArtworks\n\n1985 - 1994\n\n'G.B. Jones has an uneasy fascination with authority and uses her gender and sexual preference to exploit fantasies of rock & roll, sex, groupies, booze, drugs, money, leather, torn jeans,motorcycles and stardom as an all out assault against values that would strive for assimilation of queer culture into the mainstream. She's every queer girl and boy's hero, whether you want her to be or not. Believe it or don't, she is looking out for every queer's best interests.\n\n'Her obsession with power, narrative, and the detailed reworking of Tom of Finland's stereotypical gay male erotica is apparent in the series of drawings titled \"I am a Fascist Pig.\" This series recalls scenes from a dyke fantasy movie such as \"Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\" Here a beautiful blond female motorcycle cop is seduced by two punkrock babes, who tie her up and steal her bike. We are left to imagine that the cop was raped as the final scene leaves her tied to a tree, bare ass facing the audience, while the babes make a fast getaway.\n\n'The style the drawings take is usually casual, pencil on paper with heavy outlines and carefully rendered tits, asses, quads, biceps, et al.. and whether framed, pinned to the wall or just printed in a zine, they maintain the freshness of pages torn from a teenager's school notebook.'-- Arnold Kemp, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts\n\n2003 - 2005\n\n“ The ruined and decaying monasteries and remote, secluded spots of Caspar David Freidrich's ink drawings are translated into this age while attempting to continue his traditions. To behold private places, to see the moment altered irrevocably, ravaged by circumstances and violence beyond our control and, afterwards, the beauty of decay. Whether discovered by chance or created by fate, the unimagined becomes visible. What was unknown becomes accessible, fleetingly merging with the aesthetic of the present till, once more, it becomes forgotten and invisible to the future.” -- G.B. Jones, October 2003\n\n2007\n\nSackhead\n\nBy GB Jones & Scott Treleaven\n\n----\n\nFifth Column\n\n'Fifth Column is an all-women experimental post punk band from Toronto, which came about during the early 1980s. Originally the group had been known as Second Unit, but they took the name Fifth Column after a military manoeuvre by Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War, in which nationalist insurrectionists within besieged Republican Madrid, called 'the fifth column', would aid the four columns (north, south, east and west) outside the perimeters.\n\n'Independent-minded, they released their recordings, including their second full length recording All-Time Queen Of The World, themselves. In 1992 they released a single, \"All Women Are Bitches\", on the independent record label K Records. Despite being controversial and receiving little airplay, the recording was voted \"Single Of The Week\" in the UK music publication Melody Maker. Their last full-length recording, 36-C, was also released by K Records. The band's latest release was in 2002, on the Kill Rock Stars compilation, Fields And Streams.'-- collaged\n\n'Like This'\n\n'All Women Are Bitches'\n\n'Donna'\n\nTrailer: 'She Said Boom: The Story of Fifth Column'\n\nXtra catches up with Kevin Hegge, Director of 'She Said Boom: The Story of Fifth Column'\n\nAlbums\n\nTo Sir With Hate (1985, Hide Records)\n\nAll-Time Queen Of The World (1990, Hide Records)\n\n36-C (1994, K Records)\n\nSingles\n\n\"All Women are Bitches/Donna\" 7\" on K Records (1992)\n\n\"Don't\" 7\" split single with God Is My Co-Pilot on Outpunk Records (1994)\n\n\"I Love You, But\" 7\" split single with Trailer Queen on Dark Beloved Cloud Records (1995)\n\nCassettes\n\nWork (1989) Hide Records & Tapes; soundtrack for the video by Paulette Philips, cassette only release\n\nLinks\n\nFifth Column interviewed at PunkAcademy.com\n\nFifth Column's Myspace page\n\nFifth Column Fan Page (in Portugese)\n\n----\n\nJ.D.s\n\n'J.D.s is seen by many to be the catalyst that pushed the queercore scene into existence. The editors had initially chosen the appellation \"homocore\" to describe the movement they began, but later replaced the word 'homo' with 'queer' to create Queercore, to better reflect the diversity of the scene and to disassociate themselves completely from the oppressive confines of the gay and lesbian communities' orthodoxy and agenda. G.B. Jones says, \"We were just as eager to provoke the gays and lesbians as we were the punks.\" According to Bruce LaBruce, J.D.s initially stood for Juvenile Delinquents, but \"also encompassed such youth cult icons as James Dean and J.D. Salinger.\"\n\n'The zine featured the photos and the \"Tom Girl\" drawings of G.B. Jones, stories by Bruce LaBruce, and the \"J.D.s Top Ten Homocore Hits\", a list of queer-themed songs such as \"Off-Duty Sailor\" by The Dicks, \"Only Loved At Night\" by The Raincoats, \"Gimme Gimme Gimme (My Man After Midnight)\" by The Leather Nun, \"Homophobia\" by Victims Family, \"I, Bloodbrothers Be\" by Shockheaded Peters, \"The Anal Staircase\" by Coil and many more. Groups like Anti-Scrunti Faction were featured in the fanzine. Contributors included Donny the Punk, comic artist Anonymous Boy, author Dennis Cooper, artist Carrie McNinch, musician Anita Smith, punk drag performer Vaginal Davis and Klaus and Jena von Brücker.'-- collaged\n\nYou can download pdfs of two issues of J.D.s for free here from the great Queer Zine Archive Project Site.\n\nOr you can buy a special box set of meticulous recreations of the entire run of the J.D.s zine for the unpunk rock but rather art world price of $80 (Canadian) here.\n\n----\n\n*\n\np.s. Hey. Greetings from Halle, Germany. Nothing to report back on yet. I just woke up. ** Sarah Schulman, Sarah! Wow, hi! How really awesome of you to come in here. How are you? I miss you. Oh, yeah, I've got a list of my-stuff-to-film projects that never happened. Some quite sadly. I've also got one 'successful' my-stuff-to-film project that I wish had never gotten made too, ha ha. Thanks a lot, Sarah! Much respect and love to you! ** David Ehrenstein, Hi, David. Yes, I found maybe 5 really exciting sounding films that Resnais wanted to make and never did, very sadly. The Garbo thing, wow. That I don't know. ** MyNeighbourJohnTurtorro, Hey! Really good to see you! Ugh about the internet issues. I'm good, really busy, really good. Oh, yes, I like Breillat's films. I did a post here about her work a while back. Let me see if I can find it. Hold on. Yeah, here. Yes, the questions for Elias! I spaced in my current spate of work overload. I'll have a bunch of bored downtime the next couple of days because theater rehearsals are usually something like 70% sitting around waiting, so I'll make a list and get that to you pronto. Sorry. I'm really excited to get to query him. I intend to see 'Under the Skin', yeah. I think it just hit Paris. Music ... give me a day to get my memory together. I just woke up, and I'm typing on barely coffeed-up, rudimentary fumes/brain power. Cool to see you, man. More soon, including Elias questions. Thanks a lot! ** Tosh Berman, Hi, Tosh. Thanks re: the post. Good, no, great question. I didn't remember where I read that piece, sorry, but Steevee suggested another think-piece that I read too, by Michele Goldberg @ The Nation, and which isn't bad at all, so I doubly recommend it. I agree with you on every point wholeheartedly. ** Sypha, Hi. Suzanne Vega would be a nice ice cube for the blog's pants too, so, yeah, if you want to make a SV pst, I would be thrilled and really grateful. I joined Amazon Prime so I could watch some movie, and their player didn't work with my system, and it was big waste of whatever I paid. ** Bill, I know, right? Yeah, I looked around and saw that they are in the Biennial, which is so great. I'm not sure if your link is what I found, so I'll use it later. I forgot my toothbrush, and the flight here was a horror -- never fly Darwin Airlines, trust me -- and I just saw Halle in the daylight for the first time, but, so far, for the most part, things here are A-okay. ** Statictick, Hey! Big N! I missed you! Oh, fuck, about the epilepsy episode and the hospital outcome. Man, you are the toughest fucker ever, I don't even know what to say. Obviously, mega-hopes for the visit with the neurologist. The Mitten Movie Project sounds really interesting. 'I need to get back to doing what it is that I do': truer words hath ne'er been spoke! Love to you, buddy. ** Steevee, Thanks for the suggestion to Tosh. I read that piece too. Not bad, yeah. That's great news about the actor! Congratulations, man! That's fantastic! Having just gone through successful auditions myself, I think I know how strengthening that feels. ** Magick mike, Hi, Mike. Oh, shit, sorry. I rushed to judgement on the authorship. I'll change the attribution in the link. Yeah, sorry about that. ** Torn porter, Hi. Okay, sounds good, and meeting/seeing Ratty would be ace. Let's sort it this weekend. Thanks for the link, but, yeah, said fellow being interviewed is an ex-boyfriend of mine, and I actually didn't like that interview at all for numerous reasons, but, yeah, I can see why it might seem like I would. Long story short, thanks! ** Zach, Hi. I would think it would, yes. I had a friend who did it a few times, thinking it might cure his ills. It didn't, and, wow, no thanks. I actually found that unmade Eisenstein film info when I was looking for stuff for the post, and I somehow lost it along the way and didn't use it, weird. Yeah, really interesting, right? Indeed, Sarah S. came in here. I was and am very chuffed. ** Kier, Hi, K! Thanks a lot, pal. That's weird: I listened to Mahler's 'Kindertotenlieder' about four days ago for no reason at all. Our brains may have ended up in the same loop or something. My day was okay, mostly traveling, but today might be something. First day at actual work on the new theater piece. Momentous or something. Have a great day. ** Rewritedept, Hi. I don't know or maybe remember about the 'Abelcain' thing. He has a lot of never realized films. Is that Gilliam doc the one from quite a while back with Johnny Depp, etc..? If so, it's okay. I did see 'Cocksucker Blues', yeah, quite a while back in a theater. I thought it was quite interesting, and while, yeah, I can see why the RS didn't want it out, their refusal to let it be released does not speak well of them. Hope you're much less bored out of your skull today. ** les mots dans le nom, Hi. Thanks for directing me to the source re: the Sollers. Interesting about Bataille holding the greatest mystery. I'd need more coffee and wakefulness to figure out which of those guys is the most mysterious to me. I think the problem re: Sollers, at least in France, is that he has become a go-to TV talking head/guest on shows here all the time, and I haven't read hardly any of his writings from the last many years, but people I know who have and who I respect always say something happened and that he has become a much less interesting thinker and writer. But I don't know at all, personally. ** Paul Curran, Hi, Paul. Yeah, I like the reading clips being included. It's nice, a curious offshoot, a interesting tangential add. I guess that, like, a 'Left Hand' FB page or something is a good idea? People seem to do that all the time, so I guess it works and is a plus? ** Chilly Jay Chill, Hi, Jeff. Yeah, I'm pals with John W., and I didn't know about the 'Dunces' project either until I found the info online. You know, obviously, the Bressons are the most tragic never-mades for me. I would kind of die if Tati had made that Sparks film or even any additional film. And the Malicks, of course. I think your dissent was very respectful. I haven't seen a consequent shit storm, so I suspect you just said what a number of people have been thinking. You're going to LA? Whoa, to read or ... ? To be on Bookworm? My fave LA restaurant is Real Food Daily, a vegan place, on La Cienega near Beverly. I love the 'fast' Mexican food place/chain Poquito Mas, on Sunset a bit west of La Cienega. A trip to Amoeba Records is always hugely recommended. What area are you staying in? ** Misanthrope, If anybody could have seen all those films, it would have been you. Dude, I read about The Undertaker losing. I was completely shocked. I watched footage of the crowd's reaction. Amazing. One of guys that Zac and I are casting in our film is really really into American pro wrestling, and he's also the bass player in a French Death Metal band. He is awesomeness. Cool, let me know know what's up re: your accommodations when it's up. ** Right. You get this old post about the wondrous GB Jones today, which I hope you'll thoroughly enjoy, of course. I'm off to rehearsals now. I promise to break a leg if you will. See you tomorrow.\n\n↧\n\nRerun: Entry level: Luchino Visconti's 'German Trilogy' (1969 - 1973) (orig. 07/24/08)\n\n----\n\n\"The Damned (1969) Death in Venice (1971) and Ludwig (1973) are known as Luchino Visconti’s ‘German Trilogy’. Here Visconti examines the decadence of the Belle Epoque, the corruption and confusion behind the rise of Nazism in Weimar Germany, and the story of Ludwig II of Bavaria who has been viewed as very eccentric and was the patron of Richard Wagner. Whilst some critics have marked this down as Visconti’s ‘decadent’ period, and noted an increasing pessimism in the themes that he dealt with this has frequently been over-personalised. Visconti has argued that what interested him was the analysis of a sick society, and in these films the historical forces of modernity versus counter-modernity are being played out.\n\n\"In The Damned the representation of the infamous ‘Night of the Long Knives’ when the SS slaughtered the leadership of the sexually transgressive SA of Eric Rohmer, links the growth of Nazism to a crisis of masculinity, and also explores the homo-erotic bonding of militarism which repress its own sexual excess instead transferring that into compulsory heterosexuality in tandem with patriarchal family values.\n\n\"Death in Venice links Thomas Mann and Mahler, artists of the period, with a desire for youth represented as homosexual longing which was an impossible desire at that time. Representing a crisis where the new generation will be fundamentally different whilst the once resplendent Venice the most dynamic city in Europe of the Early and middle Renaissance is decaying, riven by a pestilence of a more Mediaeval type. This isolation of the wealthy and their retreat to decadence is a representation of modernity as conquering the old, marginalising the ancien regime.\n\n\"Ludwig’s homosexuality can be seen as indicative of the passing of a monarchical system reliant upon hereditary and therefore compulsory heterosexuality. This dovetails two themes. Patriarchal systems based upon physical reproduction have become outmoded and unstable. A newer form of patriarchy is necessary to achieve stability. For Ludwig to express his desire even as a monarch means to regress from the social reality of the moment only when Bavaria has been subjugated to Prussia leaving a token monarchy can Ludwig act out his desires in a limited way.\"-- Kinoeye\n\nThe Damned (1969)\n\n\"It's been suggested that there's incest between Hamlet and his mother in Shakespeare's play, but between them there's lots of things in addition to the incest; Hamlet never actually has intercourse with his mother, and even in my film The Damned I was able to convince [the censors] that the scene was very elliptical. However, when I showed them the film with a tiny cut, they asked for a much longer cut, one which would have eliminated the whole scene, so I refused and stuck to it (...) I said I could have cut more of that scene, but that I would have been forced to insert a counter-camp, and I said it would have made everything more graphic, because you would actually see a naked man and a naked woman on a bed. So I cut this counter-camp in and I showed them the film again, and they immediately agreed to go back to that only one tiny cut.\"-- Luchino Visconti\n\n\"The Damned won Visconti his sole Academy Award nomination, for best screenplay, shared with his two co-writers.\"-- BBC Four\n\n\"When Visconti asked me to be in The Damned, I said to him, \"Look. I can't play this role.\" He said, \"I know you can do it,\" and I said, \"How?\" and he said, \"I can see it behind your eyes. Just listen to me. I'm going to make you up, I'm going to change your style, I'm going to make you look like a woman in her thirties, you're going to have beautiful clothes, a beautiful set, you're going to have beautiful people around you. I'm going to put you into this place and you're going to have to do what you have to do. I can't act for you. I can do everything else for you, but I can't act for you. Will you act for me?\" I said, \"Senor, si! Grazia!\" And I did. With Helmut Berger he was an absolute tyrant. He told Helmut every single thing to do. Everything. Every movement. But with the women, he was - I don't know how he was with Ingrid Thulin because we didn't have so many scenes together - certainly with me and Romy Schneider, he just puts you in this most incredible situation where you feel like a princess and you're absolutely loved, and you're dressed and you're made-up and he says, \"Just now act for me.\" And with his women it was like that. With the men it was very different.\"-- Charlotte Rampling\n\n\"Visconti’s intention in The Damned is not to present a realistic character driven drama but a highly stylized metaphor for Germany's descent into insanity. He intentionally uses extreme grotesque images, with one scene more bizarre than the next. The film is filled with moments of great sadness, perversion and horror that include themes of incest, pedophilia, homosexuality, murder, drug addiction and suicide. One of the highlights of the film is a bloodbath -- the historical \"Night of the Long Knives,\" massacre of Hitler's old private army. This memorably horrific set-piece is superbly staged, beggining with a pastoral scene of soldiers playing in a lake, then progressing into an almost surreal drunken orgy of soldiers, naked women, men in drag, finally leading to the brutal massacre.\n\n\"Visconti dramatizes alienation and madness in a very similar way that Stanley Kubrick handled similar themes in A Clockwork Orange. He photographs these acts of violence and perversion with detached but almost pictorial beauty. Everyone's sweats in this movie: drops of perspiration trickle down temples, and rivers of sweat glisten on upper lips while the baroque lavishness of the scenery makes a striking contrast with the ghastly minds of the characters. The cinematography is brilliant, capturing the decaying elegance impecably. Visconti uses a Hammer-horror pop color palette emphasizing the intense contrast between shadow and light (good vs. evil), blues, browns and reds. In the opening scene, he shoots the blasting furnaces of the steelworks factory, flames and smoke coming up from the furnaces as the titles jump on and off the screen and we hear the harrowing music theme by Maurice Jarre; a fitting metaphor of Hell and of the horrors and depravity which will follow.\n\n\"With The Damned, Visconti reassures himself again a spot right up there, into the pantheon of great directors. One can see the influence of The Damned on later films such as Bob Fosse’s Cabaret or the psycho sexual drama The Night Porter. The film was originally rated X due to its challenging subject matter, but Visconti’s craft and talent elevates this epic drama to a higher artistic level. With its brilliant set design, spectacular costumes, the intensity of Helmut Berger and Ingrid Thulin performances, Luchino Visconti's The Damned is a feverish masterpiece not to be discarded.\"-- from 'The Spinning Image'\n\nTrailer\n\nThe massacre\n\nDinner scene\n\nDeath in Venice (1971)\n\n\"Some shots of Björn Andrésen, the Tadzio of the film, could be extracted from the frame and hung on the walls of the Louvre or the Vatican in Rome. For this is not a pretty youngster who is supposed to represent an object of perverted lust; that was neither novelist Mann's nor director-screen writer Visconti's intention. Rather, this is a symbol of a beauty allied to those which inspired Michelangelo's David and Da Vinci's Mona Lisa, and which moved Dante to seek ultimate aesthetic catharsis in the distant figure of Beatrice.\"-- from Lawrence J. Quirk, 'The Great Romantic Films'\n\n\"In his memoir, An Orderly Man, Dirk Bogarde relates that, after the finished film of Death in Venice was screened for them by Visconti in Los Angeles, the Warner Bros. executives wanted to write off the project, fearing it would be banned in the United States for obscenity because of its subject matter. They eventually relented when a gala premiere of the film was organized in London, with Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Anne in attendance, to gather funds for the sinking city.\"\n\n\"Luchino Visconti's 1971 adaptation of Thomas Mann's novella Death In Venice visibly had a strong influence on Ron and Russell Mael aka the band Sparks. In their early performances Sparks got a miniature ocean liner made out of papier-mache, and Russell Mael had burst out of it wearing a dark sailor suit to begin the show. The ideas of the miniature ocean liner and the sailor suit were obviously inspired by Lucchino Visconti's movie despite Russell's suit was dark instead of the white one wore by the main young character Tadzio from the movie. When the first Halfnelson album failed, the Bearsville label thought the record should be repackaged under the name \"Sparks\" with a revamped packaging too. So Ron Mael and manager/ photographer Larry Dupont designed the album cover with the fake brick wall. It just wasn't as interesting as the original first car interior cover but the pic featured Russell Mael in the famous sailor suit inspired by Luchino Visconti's movie. When Sparks' second album, A Woofer In Tweeter's Clothing, was released one year later it included the song \"Moon Over Kentucky\". The intro of this song was written by Ron Mael after seeing Death In Venice.\"-- from 'Sparks: the Early Years'\n\n\"If The Damned displays a violent assault on space, Visconti's adaptation of Thomas Mann's novella Death in Venice shows it slowly dissolving. Twenty years before Wong Kar-wai, Visconti had already penetrated the private space of a lonely, romantically obsessed individual and summoned up his emotional landscape through the expressive use of an urban environment and music. Like the furnace that sets the scene in The Damned, Death in Venice states its mood and pace in its opening image, an incredibly slow shot floating from the middle of a dusk-blue mist into the Venetian lagoon across which the boat bearing composer Gustav von Aschenbach (Dirk Bogarde) to the city of his death passes. Accompanied by the music of Gustav Mahler, upon whom the character of the composer was based, this shot slowly brings the story into focus, just as at the end it again drifts out of focus. This lends a sense of instability to the melancholy, dreamlike interim. Visconti's descriptive camera is allowed to dominate the film because there is simply nothing but description and observation in this film. As in The Damned, Visconti makes expert use of the zoom lens, but this time the zooms are for the most part slow and exploratory. The camera glides endlessly across the hotel and its guests, as well as the beaches with their numerous holidaymakers, often starting a shot as if it were from von Aschenbach's point of view, only to finish with him in shot, creating a subtle sense of disorientation.\n\n\"The only action in this film is what goes on within Aschenbach's mind and it is by colouring the potentially neutral, at times almost documentary scenes that Visconti creates with the appropriate mood that he brings this film to life. Compared to the crushing solidity of Ludwig, space here is frequently subjective, a screen on which the dying hero projects his feelings. At the same time, this space remains mysteriously aloof from him, displaying all the inscrutability of a foreign country. This slightly threatening aspect of Venice is hinted at from the outset. As von Aschenbach is brought by gondola from the boat at the opening of the film, a dispute with the gondoleer leaves Aschenbach muttering worriedly to himself: “I don't understand”. In the final stages of Death in Venice, when von Aschenbach discovers evidence of a cholera epidemic locals are trying to cover up for the sake of the tourist industry, the menacing aspect comes to the fore, the now corrupt beauty of the alleys and canals of Venice holding a lurking sense of death and danger far more powerful than even that evoked by Nicolas Roeg in Don't Look Now (1973) with its more obviously grand Guignol trappings. Roeg's rainswept, off-season Venice is immediately inhospitable, whereas Visconti, the master of decadence, seduces us with his painterly vision only to gradually reveal the danger at its heart. This parallels the process of Aschenbach's hopeless love for a boy he has spotted on the beach and his ultimate death in pursuit of his ideal, Visconti once again using space to tell his story, this time with a delicacy that he would never surpass.\"-- from 'Visconti's Cinema of Twilight', by Maximilian Le Cain\n\nTrailer\n\nThe entire film\n\nLudwig (1973)\n\n“One would spontaneously put Visconti’s Ludwig in the category of films that are bigger than cinema and more audacious than their time. Their mere existence challenges the dullness of daily life, the materialism of the century… And in this film of over-proportionate ambition, the filmmaker could not remain smaller than his subject: Ludwig, no more than Linderhof castle, is meant to be inhabited.”-- Olivier Assayas\n\n“In Helmut Berger’s Ludwig, Visconti’s echt aestheticism finds its last champion, its Tristan, and also its supreme sacrificial victim, its Christ. Ludwig is a passion play: a mass.”-- James McCourt\n\n'Visconti's best films have the rare quality of existing in space as much, if not more, than in time. It is an intensely visual style of filmmaking, which involves immersing the audience in the atmosphere of each scene and gradually overwhelming them with it as opposed to rushing from one scene to the next in pursuit of narrative tension. Of all the directors who, each in their own very unique way, practice a similar approach – Dreyer, Antonioni, Tarkovsky, Jansco, Angelopoulos, Tarr, certain films by Kubrick and Wenders – Visconti is the most subtle, consciously or unconsciously cloaking his radicalism in the 'respectability' of the period genre. I would argue that this radicalism was achieved through constant striving to tell his stories more vividly rather than by making use of any preconceived aesthetic programme. In this way, Visconti can be perceived as the transitional figure in European cinema between classicism and modernism.\n\n\"Ludwig deals with an aristocrat isolated by changing times, in this case the King of Bavaria. Melancholy gives way to neurosis; the romantic atmosphere has become that of a gothic horror film, with Helmut Berger's tormented King hiding from the world like a vampire as he descends into escapism, illness and insanity. Ludwig is a film about a man avoiding coming to terms with change, put in a position of leadership for which he is hopelessly unfit and which he uses to hide from the world. It is an icy, spare, claustrophobic record of decadence and degeneration. Each scene has the feeling of a solemn ceremony or, at times, an historical tableau. His view of events is detached, reflecting both the hero's helplessness and his increasingly tenuous grip on reality.\n\n\"In one powerful scene, we follow Ludwig into a room full of relatives, through a complicated process of bowing and hand kissing. In the middle of it all he becomes aware of a personal betrayal. Almost overwhelmed with fury and grief, he goes through the same formal procedure before leaving the room. The scene is not played as a stiff upper lip exercise in putting a good front on things. Rather it is bitterly farcical, the King's body trembling with humiliation as he goes through the empty procedures. Ludwig is the story of a man trapped by destiny, history, and his own personal failings. And, in what is Visconti's most extreme film, he is a man trapped by the walls that enclose him.\n\n\"Ludwig is ultimately a man crushed and destroyed by architecture. Having been deposed by the government as mentally unfit to govern, he is silently escorted by his captors in an interminable real time scene down an endless series of corridors to his bleak, sterile cell. It is at moments like this that Visconti's leisurely pace turns almost sadistic, yet the relentless oppressiveness of corridor after corridor is genuinely chilling and, taken in the right spirit, possesses a hypnotic, mercilessly compacted power. It is the natural conclusion to Ludwig's ever contracting world, a final imprisonment. All that is left is his mysterious death by drowning the first time he is let out for a walk in the grounds.\" -- from Viscont's Cinema of Twilight, by Maximilian Le Cain\n\nTrailer\n\nExcerpt\n\nExcerpt in Italian\n\nHelmut Berger in Ludwig 1881\n\n*\n\np.s.

Kiki Gallery: A Year or Two of Crazy Art Making (orig. 07/05/08)\n\n----\n\nDear Dennis, as you know I’ve been working for a long time on an exhibition here in San Francisco that will bring back Kiki Gallery for six weeks this summer at Ratio 3, deep in the Mission District and oddly enough right around the corner from the original Kiki. The young artist Colter Jacobsen has been my co-curator for this show, and we have been well advised by Ratio 3’s director Chris Perez, who gave us the green light a year ago and who has been patient, helpful and generous for months. Our show is called “Kiki: The Proof is in the Pudding,” and it opened June 27, to run through August 2, and seeing that you can’t be here, I’m sending you some bits and pieces of it through e-mail for your wonderful blog. Most of your readers will have never heard of Kiki, nor of its founder, the late Rick Jacobsen (1961-1997), so I thought to introduce the show by way of a memoir -- unpublished and unfinished -- which I’ve been writing for some years. The show includes nearly two dozen artists who showed at Kiki and we have scrounged the world for the original artworks that once hung on its walls. Even though the gallery lasted for only 18 months, it turned into something of a legend, perhaps because so many of the artists involved went on to fame elsewhere. And also just because it was so amateur and contingent and makeshift I guess, in that respect very representative of the funk-junk aesthetic often associated with California art. Thanks, Dennis, for giving me and Colter permission to use the essay on Yoko Ono which you wrote for Kiki’s final show, “This Is Not Her,” organized by Rick Jacobsen and Wayne Smith, and of course for opening your blog to me and to Kiki today. If any of your readers will be here in San Francisco this summer I hope they can come down to Ratio 3 and take a look. Love from, Kevin K.\n\nThis is what you'd see when you come into Ratio 3\n\n(calligraphy by Colter Jacobsen)\n\nColter Jacobsen (my co curator) and Scott Hewicker, artist\n\nPortrait of Rick (2008) by Keith Mayerson,\n\ncourtesy Derek Eller Gallery\n\n----That afternoon in 1993, when I left John Ryan’s apartment on 14th Street, my head was spinning. In the 1950s, John Allen Ryan had been cute in a supercharged, street boy sort of way, kind of a Pete Wentz look I guess—it was all years before I was introduced to him, but I knew he had been Jack Spicer’s student at the Art Institute here in San Francisco, had slept with him (or something), become his confidant, had the sex Spicer was afraid of, and eventually became one of the “6” in the “6” Gallery, the legendary artist-run space Spicer founded with five former students in 1954. When I was writing the life of Spicer (with Lew Ellingham) Ryan was one of my key witnesses—a living link to Jack Spicer’s most vital period—and one who knew him in many different contexts, as a teacher, a “boyfriend,” a fellow poet, an artist, a collaborator. Yet each of my visits to John Allen Ryan, who lived only 3 or 4 blocks away from me, left me walking home with a headache, in part because he was dying, in part because of the difficulty of his character. And yet even the defects in his character—as I saw them—seemed inextricably tied to his dying. If I had known him at some earlier time would I have seen the same sunny, angelic, sexy man so many had told me about? Now Ryan had AIDS and he was experimenting with his meds, and he used his diagnosis as a release from the 12 step programs his friends and family might have preferred to see him on. Plus drunk, he felt comfortable enough to share with me his memories of lusting after children, and I wasn’t comfortable with that myself, yet I felt constrained around him, like I had to pretend not to be revolted. He had basically stopped writing poetry and started writing—I was going to say “child porn,” but it wasn’t quite that—at some hazy time long before we had met. Handwritten stories about adorable boys of 7 or 8. When you visited his apartment piles of ancient piles of newspapers climbed the corners of his rooms, stacked up against his walls, maybe chest-high. It wasn’t exactly dangerous, but it did make one want never to save another newspaper oneself. And laid in among these crumpled papers were original drawings by Jess, handwritten poems by Spicer, unique photos of Kerouac—all these artists and writers he had known in his youth (he had been the boyfriend of Ginsberg as well). In effect, he was out of control, and I began wondering if anything he told me could be trusted, for his mind wandered from here to there and back at the drop of a hat. I liked him, but I didn’t like him wanting me to match him drink for drink, and I didn’t like myself leading him on, as it were, for the sake of his memories of a man who had died back in 1965.\n\n----To clear my head I padded a few doors up towards Guerrero to the storefront where Rick Jacobsen was putting up his new gallery. The door was open, so I poked my head inside. “Hello!” I hollered.\n\n----Maybe when I look back on my life and youngsters asked me what I did with it, I’ll be able to nod sagely and say that I was in on three very different movements that happened here in San Francisco. I was part of the Poets Theater, I was one of the original “New Narrative” writers in the 1980s and then, in the 1990s, I hung out at Kiki—the short-lived art gallery that ran for only eighteen months maybe. Of course there’s plenty of time left for me to add a fourth or even fifth thing to my resume but as of now (2008) those are basically what I’ll remember as my most intense intersections with art. “Hello?” I called out, through the open door. The room in which my voice echoed around was small, more of a lobby than an actual room, and I assumed that this would be the anteroom and the new planned gallery would begin deeper away from the frontage. Then Rick’s head appeared from the hallway. “Hello, my friend,” he said. “This is it. This is going to be Kiki.”\n\n----We’ve all heard the tall tales about AIDS, how when people came down with the virus and felt that they faced imminent death, they turned themselves into urban legends of capitalism and its discontents. We’ve heard the stories about gay men scoring zillions of American Express cards and maxxing them out in final shopping sprees. Rick Jacobsen considered it, but instead he quit his job to do something in his last days, something he really loved. In this case, he would open a gallery and run it exactly as he pleased. I’ve got some photos of Rick Jacobsen, and the Kiki archives, housed close by my apartment at Special Collections at the main San Francisco library at Civic Center, have plenty more, so I should be able to conjure him up for you physically, for he was awfully vivid. If this were a movie, Rick would play the part of the sidekick, the Kato type, the Ron Weasley. Or he might be Jimmy Olsen in the Superman comics, strawberry blonde hair cropped short, bright blue eyes, cyan really, as though peeled from a 40s comic strip. He was quick to grin, to see the silly side of life, so sometimes he seemed goofier than he was, or than he felt perhaps. Later, after Rick’s death, when I got into Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I saw something of Rick in Xander Harris, his wisecracks, his longing for hope, his wry grin, go-for-broke stance. Inside Kiki the walls were generally white, and there was so little wall space that Rick kept the same gallon of paint for several shows, re-painting after each one was taken down. You could do the whole place in about fifteen minutes, unless you were high, which cramped your speed but made it more fun in a certain sense. Occasionally there would be a show which demanded chocolate walls, or green walls—Cathie Opie’s show was hung on walls the burnt color of terra cotta flower pots. His first show, Rick said, was going to be all about shit. It was going to be called “Caca at Kiki.” And the “at” would be replaced by a circa sign, like an e-mail address. There was something of the provocateur about Rick, that’s a given. Like the UK impresario Malcolm McLaren, he had a paradoxical combination of nervous energy and a still core of Buddhist calm. Indeed McLaren had been one of Rick’s inspirations. McLaren called the shop that he and Vivienne Westwood opened, in London’s Kings Road, “Let It Rock,” and linked it to an international Situationalist movement in which a cat might look at a king, the littlest person might try something, and social change would result. I don’t know if Rick knew his Paris 1968 as well as Greil Marcus, but he was instinctively drawn to artists on the outer edge of expression, and of course he was thoroughly informed by ACT UP politics and the courageous, sometimes vulgar ethos of the movement.\n\nBrett Reichman, \"Time Is/Time Was\" (diptych), 1993\n\nFour pictures from \"Pinocchio the Big Fag\"\n\n(1993) by Keith Mayerson\n\nKota Ezawa, \"Rick and Karla\" (2008 lightbox\n\ndrawing from 1996 photo)\n\nNayland Blake, \"Negative Bunny\" video; Michelle\n\nRollman, Red Wagon piece\n\nCliff Hengst, screen of famous designers\n\n----Indeed he came to art, or to dealing, through his activism, through his work raising money for ACT UP San Francisco. New York had had those fabled art auctions which would raise one million dollars in a single evening at Paula Cooper Gallery, beginning in 1989, and in San Francisco Rick would produce smaller versions of these benefits. I remember going to one at Rex Ray’s studio when it used to be on 11th Street in the nightclub district, above the DNA Lounge, and seeing Rick there, posing in front of some little Ross Bleckner etching that the glamorous New York-based painter, then the veritable king of gay art, had donated to the cause. Rick was all beaming and Bleckner’s mysterious, biomorphic blobs loomed like underwater creatures—like T cells, Rick said. I don’t know how much money the auction made, but Rick had found his métier.\n\n----When I first knew him, he dressed with casual rigor in ACT UP fashions, a precise range of styles now somewhat difficult to reconstruct. Doc Martens, white T-shirts with Helvetica logos, what we might now call cargo shorts except somewhat briefer, but with plenty of pockets, bandannas, red suspenders, overalls. Dodie points out, even if they paid a lot for the clothes they looked like ordinary clothes. Fashion was so extravagant in 1990 that the ACT UP look, as we called it, seemed stripped down, minimalist, egalitarian. The Reagan-Bush years were all about Marie Antoinette-like spectacles of excess—the Miami Vice construction of whiteness, the Christian LaCroix pouffe. Was the look of ACT UP perhaps a worker’s look? A fighter’s look. It owed something to skinhead fashion, stripped down bare bones of clothes, with nothing extraneous for the cops to hold onto you with, and heavy shoes for kicking back. And it was made for mass reception. As Douglas Crimp said, “The fact that everybody would be wearing identical shirts made ACT UP look incredibly well organized.” Thus when the designer of the poster for our current show used as the poster image an old photo of Rick posing in front of Kiki, she sent it my way for approval, and I wrinkled my brow, thinking it didn’t look right: it was because she had whitened out Rick’s waistline, and got rid of the waistband of his underwear that poked out from top of his baggy jeans, and I insisted she put those jockey shorts back because that was the style, that was the key—you can see I got fairly imaginative, with the trifles and trinkets that are all that are left to me.\n\n----And Kiki’s inaugural show was going to be about shit not just to outrage but because, Rick said, the AIDS crisis had made a whole generation of gay men and their friends all too familiar with what was formerly a taboo substance, but now we all watched, “read” really, our own shit the way an earlier generation of soothsayers had divined the future from bones shaken out of a cup, or the lines in one’s palm. It was in the zeitgeist: the provinces of our body, as Auden wrote, had revolted. Rick and I stood on the curb and surveyed his gallery. A large square window on the street let in spring sunlight, but it was barred with a Byzantine cluster of molded iron rods, so the sun cast strange shadows on the painted wooden floor. From the curb you could barely see in, but if you squinted you could make out the room’s essential features. Underneath the window, close to the weeds that sprouted between sidewalk panels of concrete, was the distinctive and lovely touch of a Delft blue ornamental tile in checkerboard squares.\n\n----Step inside the door, there was the little room that was, comically, the main room of the gallery. A loft platform was built into a corner of the room, and a wooden ladder nailed into the wall to access it—an ungainly feature that precluded hanging anything large on either of the walls that abutted it, but one that Rick made the best possible use of in other aspects: why, he had rented out this loft bed for someone to sleep there, which brought in some added monthly income, and also I imagine cut down on security costs.\n\n----“You know Mark Ewert,” Rick said. “Why, you introduced me to him. He’s my star boarder!” Mark had abandoned a stormy relationship with LA-based poet and novelist Dennis Cooper — you, Dennis! — , and we had introduced him to many of the denizens of the local art world in San Francisco. The young ones especially, for Mark who had spent many of his teenage years trolling for older men like Ginsberg and Burroughs, had now decided to turn over a new leaf and try out guys his own age. Mark and I were writing novel together — Secret Garden, the classic Frances Hodgson Burnett story brought up to date with surf culture, AIDS activism, and some seriously kinky sex play — and it was nice to have him nearby.\n\n----“I’m sure he’ll have fun,” I hazarded, though it would not do for me, I was forty, far too old to climb a pirate style ladder of planks to reach my bed, or to clear out whenever there was activity in the gallery below, as Rick required of Mark—scat, like a cat, into the streets.\n\n----“We’ll run all kinds of events here,” Rick said. “I want lectures and readings and talks and films and bands. I want you to put on your plays here, Kevin. I sort of want it to be everyone’s clubhouse, a place to draw people in and then hit them over the head with what’s new. What’s new, pussycat? Remember that film, my friend, with Peter Sellers? Peter O’Toole? Crazy!” The rooms of the gallery were so small that if a reading were held, and eight people showed, it would seem like an enormous crowd. We were to stage plays for Rick, who would heroically jam three rows of six folding chairs into the space underneath the loft bed, then seat three or four people up in the bed, and our stage would be among the feet of the people in the front row, and our backs would be brushing the curtained window onto 14th street. Players would make their exits and entrances from the one door, the front door of the gallery; I remember seeing them crouching listening for dear life at the keyhole, desperate to hear the cues within over the vibrant Mission street life outside. And often they missed their cues and the stage manager would have to run over and open the door himself and summon whoever it was to come inside and start speaking immediately. The first play I did there was “Life after Prince,” set in an unemployment office slash courtroom in which a presiding judge (Wayne Smith) heard evidence from all the protégés Prince had signed up, made a few quasi-hit singles for, then dropped. One by one they crowded the courtroom — Wendy and Lisa, Apollonia, Kim Basinger, Vanity, Sinead O’Connor and Sheena Easton. Nayland played Vanity and Apollonia, changing his character by flipping over a sandwich board on his chest. I was the clerk, trying to calm down the apoplectic judge. And Stephanie Cannizzo, Larry Rinder’s secretary at the Matrix Program at UC Berkeley’s Art Museum, played herself, Prince’s biggest fan and the chief witness in his defense.\n\nSTEPHANIE CANNIZZO. Ladies and gentlemen, I’m still afraid you might have gotten a wrong impression about Prince—I mean, Victor. He’s really special. When you listen to one of his songs, you’ll know. He’s no clown, he’s one of the top creators of all time. He was born under a magic star, under a dark sky, and the whole world trembled that night, and ever since his first record, I’ve been telling everyone I know, how great he is. Maybe he’s mistreated these women, I don’t know, but everyone makes mistakes. He’s sensitive and proud—I admire that. I like everything about him—almost. Give him another chance, I know you’ll say, he’s really great. Thank you and—good night.\n\n----I went back to John Ryan’s apartment a few doors down, possessed by an enormous idea. Really I should have been an event planner. John Ryan had been one of the founders of the 6 Gallery — the alternative San Francisco art space — wouldn’t it be cool if he came by, met Rick, and I don’t know, made some gesture of passing on the torch as it were? Acknowledging, you are doing what we did back then, you are doing the thing that I’ve been living on all these decades past? John seemed interested for a few minutes, then started to fret about something; soon his attention was entirely elsewhere. He had translated the entire Lord of the Rings saga into Elvish, and had recited it into a series of footwide tapes big as dinner plates. Impressive, and a true labor of love, but boring after a few minutes of close listening. I’d sit there, growing skeptical, wondering how would you know if this was real Elvish or him just uttering any old glottal, lip smacking syllables with musical intonations? He and Jack Spicer taught each other Martian, and when I asked him to favor me with some Martian, he gave me Spicer’s lines, from his Imaginary Elegies, about the flirty boy in the Berkeley gay bar,\n\nWhen I praise the sun or any bronze god derived from it\n\nDon’t think I wouldn’t rather praise the very tall blond boy\n\nWho ate all of my potato-chips at the Red Lizard.\n\nIt’s just that I won’t see him when I open my eyes\n\nAnd I will see the sun.\n\nThings like the sun are always there when the eyes are open\n\nInsistent as breath.\n\n----But in Martian the verse sounded suspiciously Elfin, and when he drank it just went on and on until even his cats got bored and left us for the kitchen. “Ae ú-esteliach nad, estelio han, estelio ammen.” “So beautiful,” I murmured. “Now what do you say we go to Kiki and I’ll show you what Rick is doing with the space.”\n\nJim Winters, silkscreen on canvas, \"Parakeet Attack\"\n\nMark Gonzalez drawing courtesy of Nayland Blake\n\nJerome Caja by Catherine Opie (from Portraits\n\nseries, 1993)\n\n\"Hunt\" by D-L Alvarez, 2008 reconstruction of damaged\n\n1993 original which was D-L's first \"paint by\n\nnumbers\" piece exhibited\n\nHere's a detail image of \"Hunt\" so the key\n\nis more visible\n\n----I mustn’t forget to tell you about Red Dora’s Bearded Lady, the café that lay adjacent to Kiki so that their doors opened into each other. Founded by the artists Harriet (now Harry) Dodge, and Silas “Flipper” Howard from the band Tribe 8, Red Dora’s was a women’s tearoom and “truckstop” as Dodge used to say, with a minimal menu but the epicenter of Mission lesbian life in those days. The café and the gallery shared a common garden patio in the back, usually filled with dogs, nearby the bathroom. Coming out into the sunny backyard after penetrating the incredibly narrow, dim hallway of either Kiki or Red Dora’s one found it perhaps more charming than it actually was. The cartoonist and writer Kris Kovick ran a monthly reading series there, a lot of spoken word, slam poetry, much of it comic in nature, always a vibrant mix of writing and theater. Jenni Olson, the San Francisco filmmaker and activist, laughed when she remembered what an unlikely place it was—14th Street, seedy as all get out—and then you had Red Dora’s and Kiki bunched together like defiant outposts of the avant-garde. “I remember the opening of Cathie Opie’s show at Kiki,” she recalled, “with that giant, life-sized picture of Justin Bond, and the smaller photos of LA trannies like ‘Chicken’ and ‘Steak,’ with Opie’s trademark rich colors and backdrops, and I remember thinking how thrilling it was that finally, for lesbians, we were finally chic—not just tolerated or excused, but everyone wanted to be us! It was transitory, that high, but you can’t imagine how that felt.”\n\n----I remember seeing Justin Bond, of the cult stage duo “Kiki and Herb,” walking everywhere in San Francisco, often down 18th Street from the Castro to the Mission, his long blond hair sometimes tied primly behind him, other times, like Melina Mercouri, he let the hair blow about his face as though to suggest passionate fires banked within. His extraordinary looks stopped traffic in the street. Cars would jam on their brakes. Opie photographed him looking stunning and androgynous in violet, his eyes boring holes through the viewer, holes of ravaged glamour remarkable in one who, viewed from another angle, was so young and fresh.\n\n----“Which came first,” I asked him recently, “did you become Kiki or did Rick call his space Kiki first?”\n\n----“I’ve often thought about that,” he replied. “You know I was at the opening. You’d think I would recall.” Justin had come across the term “Ki-Ki,” in Leslie Feinberg’s memoir-novel Stone Butch Blues (1993), a lesbian category for one who presents herself as neither butch nor femme. “But it’s pronounced “Ky-Ky,” to rhyme with ‘My, My.’ I liked that; I felt like that, that I wasn’t butch nor was I femme. And there was Kiki of Montparnasse, the artists’ favorite model and rather a disgrace in 1920s Paris. I always teased Rick for copying me, but to tell you the truth, it might have been the other way around—though I don’t think so!”\n\n----In the summer of 1993 Kiki opened, and it was a mess—but an inspired one, with the sorts of work on the walls that had you rubbing your eyes, “Is this art?” People came in droves, maybe the inner core of hipsters at first, but then intrepid collectors and then, drawn by the buzz like bees at a hive, came the ordinary people I guess, those who didn’t know much about art but knew when something was fun. Some got converted, some became artists themselves. The very messiness of Rick’s presentation and the tiny size of the space sometimes made you feel you were in an old fashioned phone booth with graffiti edged into it from top to bottom. Rick’s shows were really out there; after the “Caca” one, there was a “Carcass” show, truly gross, in which all the art works had been made from dead animals. There was a Bong show of artist’s bongs—the only rule was, they all had to actually be workable. At that show, the artists brought the work in so late there was no time to label anything, and everyone was so high that no one could remember who had done which piece. I don’t remember how Rick sorted it all out, or if he cared to. There were a number of one or two person shows: Catherine Opie showed with Jerome Caja, the San Francisco drag activist who did many of his/her paintings using store bought makeup—nail polish, liquid eyeliner, glitter—on canvases retrieved from dumpsters. Jerome greeted his fans from a claw-footed bathtub; it was a gesture out of an earlier age, the 1920s, the era of Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven. Presumably the Baroness would not have signed my autograph book, as Jerome, did, “Hi Kevin, Fuck You.” Dozens of Jerome’s little pictures dotted the walls, and more were piled in the shed in case any were bought. Soon as one was snapped up, Rick slapped up another. They came on any flat surface Jerome could find—not only canvas but hubcaps, ashtrays, pizza boxes, shingles. D-L Alvarez had a show, “Night of the Hunter,” that doubled up with Chris Johanson’s “Fantasy Island.” The public library, where Wayne donated many of the Kiki materials after Rick’s death, has a whole slew of little Johanson drawings, at least a dozen, all more or less the same, one stab after another for an image for the “Fantasy Island” invitation, all of them variations on his signature image of an anonymous schlub lying (dead? passed out? asleep) on a cruel city street.\n\n----It was an age of aggression, of survival—an agonistic age—with a premium on raw, unfiltered message. Even artists with existing gallery connections and representation found Kiki a place to express other sides of their talents, or to give way to a churning place of sensation where talent was not the only value. Sometimes even the most Apollonian of us wanted a place to feel as Dionysus felt. Brett Reichman was my favorite painter then, and his exquisitely wrought canvases of toys and dolls in extremis, in bold colors and delicate shadows, seemed superhumanly rendered, almost as though a god had made them.\n\n----“All my work from that timeframe,” Brett told me recently, “was addressing AIDS, death, beauty, metaphor, identity. While my work was moving toward a more refined facility and clearly on the fringes of the KIKI aesthetic, it was nonetheless a layered process of control and the lack thereof.” His work went through an explosive stage during the Kiki period, incorporating “major” dripping and splattering of paint. “Yeah, what was that all about?” I asked. “I was thinking of the paint metaphorically, as crying off the surface,” said Brett. Paint as tears: I’ve been thinking about how much fun we had at the gallery but it comes back and hits me from time to time now, how awful things were and how depressed we were at bottom. We had to make up fun since there wasn’t any going on in “reality.”\n\n----As the sculptor Vince Fecteau remembered it, Kiki was a process for Rick, and not entirely a pleasant one. Rick Jacobsen went into Kiki all fired up and politicized, but of necessity he had to become part of the very art world he abhorred. You couldn’t change something except by doing it from inside, but being inside literally weakened Rick. I asked Vince what it was about Kiki that made it so vibrant. Nayland’s patronage helped — Nayland Blake, the super success story among San Francisco artists of the day. He had gone from hanging his work on the walls of Just Desserts on the waterfront, to showing at Mary Boone and Matthew Marks — and yet he remained dedicated to promoting the local, the artists or would-be artists on our block. Nayland had an intense respect for writers, which might have influenced Rick to encourage writers to become part of his gallery–I didn’t think of this till just last month, that it was probably Nayland’s say-so that got me past the velvet rope and into the art world, and only because I was a writer, someone who knew the writers he admired, like Kathy Acker or Robert Glück.\n\n----And soon enough they were inside too. Kathy never wrote anything or showed anything at Kiki, but leafing through Rick’s reservation book I see her name again and again at events. As I think of it more and more I realize the privileged place writers had at Kiki, for it wasn’t only Kathy or Bob who exercised influence on what artists got shown there, but Dennis too, like some sweet eminence grise, must have put in a word for Keith Mayerson (with whom he was to collaborate on the graphic novel of Horror Hospital Unplugged), and for Frances Stark and Richard Hawkins as well — two Los Angeles artists who were among his special enthusiasms (I had almost said protégés) at the time, all of whom showed at Kiki. I wonder also if the time wasn’t right for a — well, if not a writer-run space, but a space that worked with writing. So many of the artists who interested us most were writing all up and down their pictures and sculptures, so many in fact, that before long they had to invent a special word for this practice, the ungainly “image-text.” “Oh, so you do image-text?” one would inquire politely, but rather on rote, the way one might ask, “Oh, and you breathe?”\n\n----In San Francisco, curator and critic Maria Porges had organized a big Artspace show in 1989 examining this development, calling it “The New Narratology,” but think of Barbara Kruger, Lawrence Weiner, Cy Twombly, Gran Fury’s “Silence = Death” stickers, and then in 1993 it was all about Raymond Pettibon on the one hand and Sophie Calle on the other — captions versus narration, but both of them heavily dependent on the word.\n\n----Finally, the time was right for a gallery like Kiki because of the collapse of the art market, which would come back stronger than ever, of course, but which then was pr"
