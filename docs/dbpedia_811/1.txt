These savage ladies are tearing up the current Chicago punk landscape, squealing and careening like an out of control tornado of estrogen, headed straight for the danger zone. With spazztastic sounds leaking from the VOM/Teddy & the Frat Girls-school of sloptometrics, Squish are a combustible gang of rabid rock’n roll gals that might just squash your feelings along with your face. Keep an eye out for their debut 7″ EP on Hozac!
