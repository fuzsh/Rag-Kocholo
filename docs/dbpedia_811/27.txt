Anti Scrunti Faction were a queercore punk trio from Boulder, Colorado. 😄

It is amazing to think back and realize how regular mail correspondence through the US Postal service was the spine of the Punk Rock movement. I can say I was a punk rock correspondent entrepreneur. This is how I met Leslie Mah and Tracie Thomas of A.S.F. During the punk scene of the 1980s, tapes and correspondence were part of our lives and I was taken by the gals of A.S.F., mostly because women were not a big staple of the scene we had grown to know. I made it happen and we put out their record. Women, punk rock, politics, sexuality, racism, and abounding creativity is the loud heartfelt sarcasm that emanates from this band. I remember making vegetarian spaghetti in our kitchen with Leslie. Taking Leslie and Tracie to the beach was a real treat. I got my first tattoos with the A.S.F. girls. A contrary experience for me because at the same time we were working with the bands Doggy Style and Detox. Some of my best memories of co-running a fanzine. Leslie Mah and Tracie Thomas went on to have an interesting life creatively and I am happy for them. Look them up you may be surprised.

Again, from the original Flipside “CATALOG.” As written at that place and time in history by yours truly. I don’t know why I excluded Flipside Vinyl Fanzine Number One, maybe at the time we ran out of them for sale. Yet I will include it later in my gathering of Intellectual Property … my journey to bring together what was lost on the internet wasteland. (If only symbolically)

A friendly gesture to remember what seems vague in my senior years. Thank you for indulging my fiery drive. As Emma Jung, wife of Swiss psychologist and psychiatrist Carl Jung, said and I paraphrase, “Sometimes a dame has got to do something for herself that no one else fucking understands, who cares cause she knows why she is doing it… for her own soul.” There now that feels better. I am just in the gathering phase. I call it Phase A.

Included below is some remarkable history about the process of creating this Vinyl Fanzine. Many hands in the cookie Jar. Heartfelt Thanks!!

Flipside Vinyl Fanzine Number Two with loads of bands.

Side One we have MIA “Just A Dream.” Decry “Island Paradise.” Out Patients “Backwards Explosion.” Naked Raygun “Metastasis.” Roach Motel “Mad Dog.” JFA “Out of School.” Massacre Guys “Let’s Forget.” Vagina Dentata “Golden Boys.” Plan Wrap “Magnetic Shoes.”

Side Two we have DI “Johnny’s Got A problem.” Misfits “Attitude.” Necros “Walking the Dog.” C2D” Aggression System.” Iconoclast “Domination or Destruction.” Cheetah Chrome and the Motherfuckers “No Words.” Disorderly Conduct “How Old Are You.” Catatonics “Descending In “E.” Braille Party “Let It Burn.” Germs “Forming.” (I’m sorry for saying mean things about Darby in Ink Disease Fanzine, he was just such a stinker.” GKH “Dickerman.” Agent Orange “Shakin’ All Over.”

“Chaz”, as he was known to most, was guitarist for Eddie and the Subtitles, a local punk band that was influential on younger Fullerton punks as the Adolescents and Social Distortion, both of which recorded their early demos and singles at Casbah and continued recording albums there as their popularity grew.

“I don’t think they shared musical tastes” stated Michael Hutchinson, producer for Billy Idol and Berlin, observing “I don’t know how excited Chaz was about Berlin – he was more excited about punk stuff.”

Yet there was an excitement that came from the blending of the two distinct cultures: one typified by Chaz and his cronies’ slacker ethos, the other by St. James and his commercial sensibilities and keen awareness of musical trends. After the success of Stacey Q’s Better Than Heaven, St. James deferred ownership of The Casbah to Ramirez.”

RIP “HUMAN” and Dan Forklift

We at Los Angeles Flipside Fanzine had loads of fun having too many projects while supporting a scene. It was way over my head but being right in the middle I did what I did to help it to flow forward. Words below from the Flipside CATALOG.

Flipside Recordz

Detox “Start Finish” LP

Our first attempt to put out a full-out album, A real under-ground sound to this album, with a band that has been around the LA scene for quite some time!!

Twelve punker tunes sung by good old Dan Forklift. Bass played by Steve (Human of the Vandals,) Tony Malone plays guitar (who featured in the movie “Girls just want to have fun,” he played the guy with green hair playing guitar on a table at some party, remember?) and now ex member Lantz Krantz (Boyfriend of Boom Boom of the Screaming Sirens) on drums.

Square dance to “No Reggae in Russia” and slam to “Shoot the Kid,” something for everyone. Oh, Oh , Oh…

Round 1

No Reggae In Russia

Henderson St

Child For One

Radio Henri

Submerge

Life On Cahuenga

Round 2

Ick The Eem

Placidyl Polka (Eddie’s Drunk Again)

Soul Boat

I Hate The French

Seasons In The Sun

Shoot The Kid

(says full album but is not) tease me babyyyy…

The last of the Flipside Videos from the 1980s. I will not do the Doggy Style “A Hard Dogs Night” because I had enough of them back in the day. That was a Gus and Al thing. Like the day Detox, ASF and Doggy Style were at our fourth Flipside house on the same day. My body and mind blew up and that is when I realized I was burning out big time, while Joy sat there with her tight mouth. ASF and Doggy Style were like oil and water and then Detox… well all around confusion. I wish I video taped that day with them. I am going to do our Flipside Records next from the Flipside CATALOG. Be more than a witness as little old Hudley continues her walk down memory lane in her vast pursuit of Intellectual Property is a good thing journey. Now is the time to fucking organize!

RIP Reed Mullin of COC… and Julie Lanfeld-Keskin of Sin 34

Ya, and life goes on TOO! And this here video has lots of bands to savor and enjoy! A colorful combination of bands from different parts of the scene.

RADWASTE the bandy band that drums and guitars their way int your viewing entertainment. Tribal sounding and unique this band plays “Radwaste Is Here” and “Rock and Roll part 1& 2” and a 100 Flowers song “All Sexed Up.”

CORROSION OF CONFORMITY blaring and loud they play “Technocracy” at the O limp Dick.

Then some Raszebrae.

“Young till I Die” at the Rollaway, in Placenta and “Strength” at Sun Valley Sportsman Hall and “Out of Touch” at the O limp Dick all show what 7 Seconds is made of.

Sin 34, “Do You Feel Safe” and “12 Hour Trip” filmed at the O limp Dick. Mini Interview.

Man, catch this, The Necros “Black Water,” “Guns,” and “Walking the Dog.”

I’m scared of these big women called FRIGHTWIG, the song “Frightwig” and “A Man’s Got to DO…” are a couple of ball breaking songs. A band that you just got to go see if you can LIVE…!

A bit of humor brings you to a band called Big Stick. A special song for all you drag racers called “Drag Racing,” the singer in this band wears a tube top, tube top because her boyfriend Eddie takes her to the drag strip (in the summer)!

And ending this video are the GRIM with two numbers “Live to Dies,” “Summer of 85” and “Sunday School.”

The End.

Shoot this is messed up because the original Flipside Video Nine produced at Flipside was in sink and had a nice continuity. Yet one can get a feel for it and the message from the bands listed. You can play the game, “I spy, that song and that band member.” So, the original CATALOG is a good outline of what is going on.

Thanks to the characters who posted these videos. I asked them to write up a little story about their journey with these tapes but no reply. Oh well, this is just my little project of gather our Flipside Products tighter in a place of love, peachy peace and prosperity.

I mean Intellectual Property is a good thing. If only a place where my grand children can see what their grandma was up to. Like me maybe eyeballing them in the future at the beginning of this video. Had to laugh. I like that. I think the message comes through. The punk rock patina shows though.

When Can I Sleep In Peace is one of our hottest videos yet, A action video waking up the viewer with the realities of a troubled world.

All the touring bands of this decade.

The video opens with the band MDC, with their song “Revolution In Rock.” And mixed through the video are three other songs of theirs “Corp. Death Burger,” “Blue by Day” and “Church and State.”

Then on to my fave band on this video the DICKS with three songs, “Sidewalk Begging,” “Hate the Police” and “No War.”

PREDITION from the out back make a slice in this video with the song “Diseases.” He don’t want it.

BGK play and sing an animal rights song call what else “Vivisection,” and a song called “Arms Race.”

And on to the big one, CONFLICT with two songs, “Which Ever You Want It” and “From Protest to Resistance.”

Oh boy, did we score when we got these songs from The Dead Kennedys. “Moral Majority” and “Chemical Warfare.”

And FINAL CONFLICT contributes one song call “Political Glory.”

And who could forget the SUBHUMANS with “Cradle To Grave.”

Then on to REAGAN YOUTH with “It’s A Beautiful Day.”

And our buddies from out back bring us a number called “Suppy Demise.”

Ending this video is the well-known band SCREAM with the very heart-warming song called “Solidarity.”

Can’t believe these tapes are holding up as good as they did. A nice cameo of Al’s voice and Me on the beginning of this Video. For those who don’t know Al and I ran Los Flipside Fanzine together during 1979 to 1989. Along with many Flipside players. Pete Landswick, Gus Hudson especially who helped a great deal with the production of these original 11 Videos. Including Hard Dogs Night.

Keith Morris By Hudley From Punk Singers Gone Mad a Flopside Bubble Gum Comic.

Straight from the original Flipside CATALOG.

This video has nine good bands on it. Sooooo, we start out with those wild and crazy guys Doggy Style, with their infamous “Donut Shop Rock” which is from Flipside’s first conceptual video. Then we have live at Balboa Theater “Side By Side,” and “Denial.” All you guys will be happy to learn what Doggy Style really means, oh baby! Just ask the Boyz about the Greek Girl.

Then one of our fave bands with the man of Rock & Roll himself Don Wrap singing “All Fucked Up “and “Red Light Green Light.” At the beautiful Safari Sam’s and the smelly O Limp Dick. I miss this band, I love ‘em so will you, Ya I’m talking ‘bout Plain Wrap

And on to one of the longest living punk rock bands, the Circle Jerks with “Making The Bomb” at the Cornhusker and “Killing For Jesus” at the O limp Dick. Something to cherish.

Aggression…. with mini Interview. Then “Salty Leather” and “Money Machine.”

On to a hot Canadian band called the Asexuals, this band has SOOO much energy, they’ll burn your eyes out. You’ll want to dance all night long! Their premiere performance “Contra Rebel and “Circus” at Fenders.

Marginal Man the hottest band, DC Band too, since the Buzzcocks perform “Marginal Man,” “Tell Me” and “Turn The Table.” Lots of fun including all recorded at Steve’s (from Ink Disease Fanzine’s basement.) Have fun and sing along with ‘em as they sing “Waffle House.”

The Detonators perform two songs at the O limp Dick, “I’ve Got A Reason” and “Do You Understand.” Ready and go…

If you’ve heard about ‘em you just got to see them live at this show at a small 12XU show in Pomona. An honest interview included that just might surprise you, it did me! And the band’s name is Agnostic Front.

The End.

JUNE NEWS 17, 2022

I am happy to say that a band from this video, and promotion video, is being featured in ARTCORE FANZINE ISSUE #41 with STUKAS OVER BEDROCK ‘Life Like Yogi’ 7” EP OUT NOW.

Pete Grella and I talked about the story of this original tape which I found interesting. It is my mission to bring stories and creators back to original source material when I can.

“I gave the Stukas video to Welly. [Welly Artcore] I appreciate that you put us on your flipside video, it made us feel like we had arrived. We made that video when we were at UCLA, using UCLA’s equipment for filming and editing. The video has aired on many platforms. We recorded the video on 3/4 video tape we found unattended. A friend of ours was taking a video editing class so she gave us access to the video editing rooms.”

Punk history is always telling a wonderful narrative. When we work together, we can keep the real punk rock historic thread and narrative alive.

Flipside Video Seven

Someone told me once that Chuck Dukowski from SST Records and I from Flipside Fanzine were the only ones that answered our mail. That made me feel good. It mattered … still does.

What I like so much about my WordPress site The Seminary Of Praying Mantis is that it is part of a global community. Every day I can see who is reading my posts from all over the world. It thrills me as much as it did back in the 1980s. We had bulk mail. We distributed Los Angeles Flipside Fanzine all over the world. And even though it may have taken two to three months for another country to get their Flipside Fanzines, I always got letters and corresponded with punks all over the world, kind of like now but maybe not as intimate. It was cool hiding in my Flipside cave and corresponding like that.

Now for the video that everyone contributed to. The compilation video with all your fave bands.

A lonely thing without a real or true story or without original source.

This tape starts out right to the point. As I have said I am finding these online because a lot of our Flipside material is all over the fucking place.

I am pulling it in or trying to collect it a bit. Giving our Intellectual Property a story of context and authentic experience. We at Flipside Fanzine did this all and it was fun but hard work.

More than copying a few video tapes or two… we went to the shows, taped the shows and hung out with the often wild and free punk players.

Los Angeles Flipside Fanzine documenting a scene. A little more than being archived somewhere or someplace.

The greatest punk band around opens this video. We bring you D.O.A. with three of their greatest “Fucked Up Ronnie,” “Enemy,” “Burn It Down.” The O limp dick is the concert hall, watch out they might just burn a whole in your boob tube.

Now we’re proud to bring an acid trip… on us, take it with Sonic Youth. “Kill Your Idols,” and “We Want Out.” Maybe right out in your living room?? Who knows?? All filmed at the Mojave Desert.

And now at the Flashdance brings us Target Of Demand, live with two songs “Airhead” and “No.”

Oh where, oh where did my Love Canal roam, or where oh where can they be? Well, they were caught here live at Cornhuskers in Azusa, and boy were they loads of fun, a real ball of laughs. “Punk Is OUR Funk Is In,” is the song. Boo Hoo, I miss these guys boo hoo. Mini-Interview. (Al And Pete)

“Hey Bob What’s Up,” is the famous son from Pillsbury Hardcore. Live at the Sun Valley Sportsman’s Hall. Don’t you want to know what’s up??

The Stardust brings us a dream live from the band Condemned To Death, with “Night of The Succubus,” It will suck the Life Force from you. So, remember to eat lots of garlic.

We love Wattie Boy oh yes, we do, we love you Wattie Boy and we’ll be true, when you are away, we’ll be blue, oh Wattie Boy we love you. “Alternatives” at the O limp dick. Mini interview back stage fun. (Al and Hudley)

The Flashdance again with Toxic Reasons “Do You Feel” and “No way Out.’ An overlooked band so give them a viewing, serious like.

More professional punks like the Stretch Marks are needed. They play “What Do you See” and “Another Tragedy” from Perkins.

The macho side of punk brings us Kraut with their very well-known hit, “Twisted.” At the O limp Dick.

Oh, Oh, Oh… Detox’s “Placydyl Polka” oh, oh, oh…. At the O limp dick… oh, oh, oh.

Two different clubs bring you the same band, yes, the wondrous and OCingest band called D.I. play “No War” and “Guns.” What do all these men have in common? Do you give up? Dicks!

That’s ALL FOLKS … da, da, da, daa…. Ptttttttt.
