Perfect Tennis started back in 2011 as a tennis news site. Since then it’s gone on to be one of the largest independently owned website for tennis news and a platform for fans to share their views on the game.

The site primarily focuses on the men’s game but also covers the financials of the sports, equipment reviews, strings, and every tournament at Grand Slam, 1000, and 500 level.

The mission of the site is to allow tennis journalists and fans freedom and creativity in their writing, personal commentary, and out-of-the-box analysis.
