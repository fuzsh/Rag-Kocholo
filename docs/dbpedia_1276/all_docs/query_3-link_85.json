        "text": "Pros and cons of BCG vaccination in countries with low incidence of tuberculosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nTala, E O; Tala-HeikkilÃ¤, M M\n\n1994-07-01\n\nPreventive bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) vaccination, together with case finding and effective chemotherapy, has formed an integral part of the tuberculosis (TB) control program in most countries. In some low-incidence countries the balance of prevention has been more on the side of chemoprophylaxis than of BCG vaccination. The time clearly has come when the strategy of mass BCG vaccination no longer is indicated medically, nor is it cost-effective. The pros and cons of the programs need to be critically evaluated against the present epidemiological background, taking into account the facts that TB, the killer disease, is recovering strength, human immunodeficiency virus infection is on the increase, and multidrug-resistant TB has changed the outcome of this previously fully curable disease. Although no longer appropriate for mass programs, BCG vaccination still should be considered for the protection of selected risk groups in low-incidence countries. The overall efficacy may be of the order 50% to 80%, but the variation is great. Therefore, further research urgently is needed on the effectiveness of BCG as an intervention in local TB programs.\n\nRecombinant BCG vaccine candidates.\n\nPubMed\n\nHernÃ ndez-Pando, Rogelio; CastaÃ±Ã²n, Mauricio; Espitia, Clara; Lopez-Vidal, Yolanda\n\n2007-06-01\n\nGiven the variable protective efficacy provided by Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin), there is a concerted effort worldwide to develop better vaccines that could be used to reduce the burden of tuberculosis. Recombinant BCG (rBCG) are vaccine candidates that offer some potential in this area. In this paper, we will discuss the molecular methods used to generate rBCG, and the results obtained with some of these new vaccines as compared with the conventional BCG vaccine in diverse animal models. Tuberculosis vaccine candidates based on rBCG are promising candidates, and some of them are now being tested in clinical trials.\n\nMurine immune responses to oral BCG immunization in the presence or absence of prior BCG sensitization.\n\nPubMed\n\nCross, Martin L; Lambeth, Matthew R; Aldwell, Frank E\n\n2010-02-01\n\nOral delivery of live Mycobacterium bovis BCG in a lipid matrix invokes cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses in mice and consequent protection against pulmonary challenge with virulent mycobacteria. To investigate the influence of prior BCG sensitization on oral vaccine efficacy, we assessed CMI responses and BCG colonization of the alimentary tract lymphatics 5 months after oral vaccination, in both previously naive mice and in mice that had been sensitized to BCG by injection 6 months previously. CMI responses did not differ significantly between mice that received subcutaneous BCG followed by oral BCG and those that received either injected or oral BCG alone. In vivo BCG colonization was predominant in the mesenteric lymph nodes after oral vaccination; this colonizing ability was not influenced by prior BCG sensitization. From this murine model study, we conclude that although prior parenteral-route BCG sensitization does not detrimentally affect BCG colonization after oral vaccination, there is no significant immune-boosting effect of the oral vaccine either.\n\n[BCG infection of the glans penis after intravesical BCG therapy].\n\nPubMed\n\nMichelet, N; Spenatto, N; Viraben, R; Cuny, J-F; Mazet, J; Trechot, P; Barbaud, A; Schmutz, J-L\n\n2008-01-01\n\nBCG therapy is an effective adjuvant treatment for superficial bladder tumors. Therapy involves intravesical instillation of live attenuated Calmette-GuÃ©rin bacilli. BCG infection of the glans is a rare local complication associated with this treatment, two cases of which are reported below. Case 1: A 77-year-old man presented relapsing urothelial bladder carcinoma treated by endoscopic resection and BCG therapy. One week after the seventh instillation, severe balanitis developed. Three months later, examination revealed massive painful perimeatal ulceration with yellowish papules in the peripheral regions. Histology revealed epithelioid giant-cell granulomas. Ziehl-Neelsen staining was positive. Slow cure of the lesions was achieved within 12months using double antitubercular antibiotic therapy. Case 2: In a 61-year-old man receiving BCG therapy for relapsing bladder carcinoma in situ, the sixth instillation was considered traumatic since it was highly painful. One week later, papular nodules appeared on the glans with a sclerosing lesion of the balanopreputial sac, dark purple perimeatal papules and a mass beneath the mucosa of the glans. Antibiotic treatment comprising ofloxacin followed by rifampicin for two months proved ineffective. Histology revealed granulomatous dermal lesions with eosinophilic necrosis. Triple antitubercular antibiotic therapy was initiated. The first reported case of BCG infection of the glans in patients undergoing intravesical BCG therapy was published in 1992. Since then, there have been nine other reports. There is no stereotypical clinical presentation. In most cases, an infiltrated erythematosus plaque is seen together with yellowish papules in certain patients. Diagnosis is based upon history and histological examination.\n\nBCG - old workhorse, new skills.\n\nPubMed\n\nGengenbacher, M; Nieuwenhuizen, N E; Kaufmann, She\n\n2017-08-01\n\nBacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG), the only tuberculosis (TB) vaccine in clinical practice, has limitations in efficacy, immunogenicity and safety. Much current TB vaccine research focuses on engineering live mycobacteria to interfere with phagosome biology and host intracellular pathways including apoptosis and autophagy, with candidates such as BCG Îzmp1, BCG ÎureC::hly, BCG::ESX-1 Mmar , Mtb ÎphoP ÎfadD26, Mtb ÎRD1 ÎpanCD and M. smegmatis Îesx-3::esx-3(Mtb) in the development pipeline. Correlates of protection in preclinical studies include increased central memory CD4 + T cells and recruitment of antigen-specific T cells to the lungs, with mucosal vaccination found to be superior to parenteral vaccination. Finally, recent studies suggest beneficial non-specific effects of BCG on immunity, which should be taken into account when considering these vaccines for BCG replacement.

The current vaccine is not fully effective and novel alternatives are needed. Here, two vaccine candidate strains derived from BCG carrying deletions in the BCG1416c or BCG1419c genes were analysed for their capacity to modulate the cytokine/chemokine profile and granuloma formation in a human lung tissue model (LTM). We show that the clustering of monocytes, reminiscent of early granuloma formation, in LTMs infected with BCG strains was similar for all of them. However, BCGÎBCG1419c, like M. tuberculosis, was capable of inducing the production of IL-6 in contrast to the other BCG strains. This work suggests that LTM could be a useful ex vivo assay to evaluate the potential immunogenicity of novel TB vaccine candidates. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The World Health Organization (WHO) affirms that the characterization of BCG sub-strains, both on genomic and proteomic levels, is crucial for a better comprehension of the vaccine. In addition, these studies can contribute in the development of a more efficient vaccine against TB. Here, we combine two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) and mass spectrometry to analyse the proteomic profile of culture filtrate proteins (CFPs) from M. bovis BCG Moreau, the Brazilian vaccine strain, comparing it to that of BCG Pasteur. CFPs are considered of great importance given their dominant immunogenicity and role in pathogenesis, being available for interaction with host cells since early infection. The 2DE proteomic map of M. bovis BCG Moreau CFPs in the pH range 3-8 allowed the identification of 158 spots corresponding to 101 different proteins, identified by MS/MS. Comparison to BCG Pasteur highlights the great similarity between these BCG strains. However, quantitative analysis shows a higher expression of immunogenic proteins such as Rv1860 (BCG1896, Apa), Rv1926c (BCG1965c, Mpb63) and Rv1886c (BCG1923c, Ag85B) in BCG Moreau when compared to BCG Pasteur, while some heat shock proteins, such as Rv0440 (BCG0479, GroEL2) and Rv0350 (BCG0389, DnaK), show the opposite pattern. Here we report the detailed 2DE profile of CFPs from M. bovis BCG Moreau and its comparison to BCG Pasteur, identifying differences that may provide relevant information on vaccine efficacy. These findings contribute to the detailed characterization of the Brazilian vaccine strain against TB, revealing aspects that may lead to a better understanding of the factors leading to BCG's variable protective efficacy against TB.\n\nProteomic profile of culture filtrate from the Brazilian vaccine strain Mycobacterium bovis BCG Moreau compared to M. bovis BCG Pasteur\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is currently the only available vaccine against tuberculosis (TB) and comprises a heterogeneous family of sub-strains with genotypic and phenotypic differences.

PMID:21507239\n\nInhibitory effect of BCG cell-wall skeletons (BCG-CWS) emulsified in squalane on tumor growth and metastasis in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoo, Yung Choon; Hata, Katsusuke; Lee, Kyung Bok; Azuma, Ichiro\n\n2002-08-01\n\nThe antimetastatic effect of BCG-CWS, which was emulsified in an oil-in-water form with either Drakeol 6VR mineral oil (BCG-CWS/DK) or squalane (BCG-CWS/SQA), on lung metastasis produced by highly metastatic murine tumor cells, Colon26-M3.1 carcinoma cells and B16-BL6 melanoma cells, was investigated in syngeneic mice. An intravenous (i.v.) administration of BCG-CWS (100 mg/mouse) 1 day after tumor inoculation significantly inhibited tumor metastasis of both Colon26-M3.1 carcinoma and B16-BL6 melanoma cells in experimental lung metastasis models. No differences in the antitumor activity of the two oil-based formulations (BCG-CWS/DK and BCG-CWS/SQA) were obverved. However, BCG-CWS/SQA administered through subcutaneous (s.c.) route was shown to be effective only when it was consecutively injected (3 times) after tumor inoculation. An in vivo analysis for tumor-induced angiogenesis showed that a single i.v. administration of BCG-CWS/SQA inhibited the number of tumor-induced blood vessels and suppressed tumor growth. Furthermore, the multiple administration of BCG-CWS/SQA given at on week intervals led to a significant reduction in spontaneous lung metastasis of B16-BL6 melanoma cells in a spontaneous metastasis model. These results suggest that BCG-CWS emulsified with squalane is a potent inhibitory agent of lung metastasis, and that the antimetastatic effect of BCG-CWS is related to the suppression of tumor growth and the inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis.\n\nDendritic Cell Activity Driven by Recombinant Mycobacterium bovis BCG Producing Human IL-18, in Healthy BCG Vaccinated Adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nSzpakowski, Piotr; Biet, Franck; Locht, Camille; Paszkiewicz, MaÅgorzata; Rudnicka, WiesÅawa; DruszczyÅska, Magdalena; Allain, Fabrice; Fol, Marek; Pestel, JoÃ«l; Kowalewicz-Kulbat, Magdalena\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTuberculosis remains an enormous global burden, despite wide vaccination coverage with the Bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG), the only vaccine available against this disease, indicating that BCG-driven immunity is insufficient to protect the human population against tuberculosis. In this study we constructed recombinant BCG producing human IL-18 (rBCGhIL-18) and investigated whether human IL-18 produced by rBCGhIL-18 modulates DC functions and enhances Th1 responses to mycobacterial antigens in humans. We found that the costimulatory CD86 and CD80 molecules were significantly upregulated on rBCGhIL-18-infected DCs, whereas the stimulation of DCs with nonrecombinant BCG was less effective. In contrast, both BCG strains decreased the DC-SIGN expression on human DCs. The rBCGhIL-18 increased IL-23, IL-10, and IP-10 production by DCs to a greater extent than nonrecombinant BCG. In a coculture system of CD4(+) T cells and loaded DCs, rBCGhIL-18 favoured strong IFN-Î³ but also IL-10 production by naive T cells but not by memory T cells. This was much less the case for nonrecombinant BCG. Thus the expression of IL-18 by recombinant BCG increases IL-23, IP-10, and IL-10 expression by human DCs and enhances their ability to induce IFN-Î³ and IL-10 expression by naive T cells, without affecting the maturation phenotype of the DCs.\n\nDendritic Cell Activity Driven by Recombinant Mycobacterium bovis BCG Producing Human IL-18, in Healthy BCG Vaccinated Adults\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBiet, Franck; Rudnicka, WiesÅawa; DruszczyÅska, Magdalena; Fol, Marek; Pestel, JoÃ«l\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTuberculosis remains an enormous global burden, despite wide vaccination coverage with the Bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG), the only vaccine available against this disease, indicating that BCG-driven immunity is insufficient to protect the human population against tuberculosis.

A case-control study was conducted to assess the efficacy of BCG in preventing tuberculous meningitis in children. New cases of tuberculous meningitis, confirmed bacteriologically, were registered as cases. Controls were children suffering from febrile convulsions attending the same hospital. A total of 107 cases and 321 controls, block matched for age, were registered. Vaccination status was determined from the history reported by the mother and by BCG scar reading. Data regarding socioeconomic status, crowding, and nutritional status were collected. Using multiple logistic regression analysis the odds ratio obtained for the presence of BCG scar was 0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.37) and the protective efficacy of BCG vaccine in preventing tuberculous meningitis in children was found to be 77% (95% CI 71 to 83%).

The immunological system is less mature in low birth weight (LBW) babies compared to term and normal birth weight (NBW) babies. Bacille Calmettee Guerin (BCG) vaccine is given at birth under the national immunization programme. There is a paucity of information on the immunogenicity of BCG vaccine in preterm and LBW babies. It was, therefore, proposed to study the reaction of BCG vaccination in LBW, preterm and normal birth weight newborns. A total of 143 newborns (90 term and 53 preterm; of these 78 were LBW) received during March to September 1998, 0.1 ml of BCG vaccine (Danish 1331 strain) intradermally on the left arm just above the insertion of the deltoid muscle within 7 days of life. At the same time trivalent oral polio vaccine was administered as per the national immunization programme. These babies were followed up in the immunization clinic at 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 +/- 1 wk to observe reactions at the BCG vaccination site. After 4 wk reaction at the vaccination site was significantly (P < 0.001) delayed in preterm babies as compared to term infants, and in the LBW babies (P < 0.05) as compared to NBW babies. The reaction at the site of vaccination was not found to be different at 6, 8, 10, 12 wk. BCG scar was seen in 47.5 per cent infants (45.4% in < 2500 g birth weight and 50% in > or = 2500 g birth weight infants) at 12 wk. But 33 (42.3%) LBW and 24 (36.9%) NBW infants also showed papule, pustule, ulceration or scab at the BCG vaccination site. The BCG reaction was seen in the sequential order from papule to scar formation. No significant difference was seen in the scar formation in infants studied with varying gestation and birth weights after 12 wk of BCG vaccination. Fifty seven (40.4%) babies still showed different stages of BCG reaction at 12 wk. BCG vaccine along with OPV administered in early neonatal life showed successful BCG reaction in 95.5 per cent infants.\n\nDifferent effects of BCG strains - A natural experiment evaluating the impact of the Danish and the Russian BCG strains on morbidity and scar formation in Guinea-Bissau.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrankel, H; Byberg, S; Bjerregaard-Andersen, M; Martins, C L; Aaby, P; Benn, C S; Fisker, A B\n\n2016-08-31\n\nDifferent Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine strains may have different non-specific effects. We assessed the effect of two BCG strains (Danish and Russian) on childhood morbidity and BCG scarification in Guinea-Bissau. During 2011-2013, infants in the Bandim Health Project's urban study area received the Danish or Russian BCG in a natural experiment. Health center consultations were registered at point of care and scar status and size at age 4Â½ months. We assessed the effect of strain on consultation rates between vaccination and age 45days in Cox proportional hazards models. Scar prevalence and size were compared using binomial regression and ranksum tests. Among 1206 children, 18% received Danish BCG (n=215) and 82% Russian BCG (n=991). The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for consultations was 0.94 (95% CI 0.60-1.46) for Danish BCG compared with Russian BCG. Girls vaccinated with Danish BCG tended to have lower consultation rates compared with girls vaccinated with Russian BCG (aHR 0.56 (0.25-1.24)), whereas the effect was opposite for boys (aHR 1.24 (0.74-2.11)), p=0.09. Children vaccinated with Danish BCG were more likely to develop a scar (97%) than children vaccinated with Russian BCG (87%), the relative risk (RR) being 1.11 (1.06-1.16). The effect was stronger in girls, and BCG scar size was larger among infants vaccinated with the Danish strain. BCG strain influences scar prevalence and scar size, and may have sex differential effects on morbidity. BCG strains are currently used interchangeably, but BCG scarring has been linked to subsequent survival. Hence, more research into the health effects of different BCG strains is warranted. Small adjustments of BCG production could potentially lower childhood morbidity and mortality at low cost. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although identified as having effects on macrophage presentation events, lactoferrin's capability to modulate dendritic cells (DCs) function when loaded with BCG antigens has not been previously recognized. In this study, the potential of lactoferrin to modulate surface expression of MHC II, CD80, CD86 and CD40 from bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) was examined. Generally, lactoferrin decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, IL-6 and IL-12p40] and chemokines [macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1Î± and MIP-2] and increased regulatory cytokine, transforming growth factor-Î²1 and a T-cell chemotatic factor, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, from uninfected or BCG-infected BMDCs. Culturing BCG-infected BMDCs with lactoferrin also enhanced their ability to respond to IFN-Î³ activation through up-regulation of maturation markers: MHC I, MHC II and the ratio of CD86:CD80 surface expression. Furthermore, lactoferrin-exposed BCG-infected DCs increased stimulation of BCG-specific CD3+CD4+ splenocytes, as defined by increasing IFN-Î³ production. Finally, BCG-/lactoferrin-vaccinated mice possessed an increased pool of BCG antigen-specific IFN-Î³ producing CD3+CD4+CD62Lâ splenocytes. These studies suggest a mechanism in which lactoferrin may exert adjuvant activity by enhancing DC function to promote generation of antigen-specific T cells.

To retrospectively compare the outcome with BCG Connaught and BCG TICE in a large study cohort of pT1 high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients. Individual patient data were collected for 2,451 patients with primary T1G3 tumors from 23 centers who were treated with BCG for the first time between 1990 and 2011. Using Cox multivariable regression and adjusting for the most important prognostic factors in this nonrandomized comparison, BCG Connaught and TICE were compared for time to recurrence, progression, and the duration of cancer specific survival and overall survival. Information on the BCG strain was available for 2,099 patients: 957 on Connaught and 1,142 on TICE. Overall, 765 (36%) patients received some form of maintenance BCG, 560 (59%) on Connaught and 205 (18%) on TICE. Without maintenance, Connaught was more effective than TICE only for the time to first recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.20-1.82; P<0.001). With maintenance, TICE was more effective than Connaught for the time to first recurrence (HR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.47-0.93; P = 0.019) with a trend for cancer specific survival (HR = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.14-0.92; P = 0.033). For time to progression and overall survival, Connaught and TICE had a similar efficacy. Compared to no maintenance therapy, maintenance BCG significantly reduced the risk of recurrence, progression and death, both overall, and disease specific, for TICE, but not for Connaught. We found that BCG Connaught results in a lower recurrence rate as compared with BCG TICE when no maintenance is used. However, the opposite is true when maintenance is given. As there is currently a BCG shortage, information on the efficacy of different BCG strains is important. In this nonrandomized retrospective comparison in over 2,000 patients, we found that BCG Connaught\n\nOral delivery of BCG Moreau Rio de Janeiro gives equivalent protection against tuberculosis but with reduced pathology compared to parenteral BCG Danish vaccination.\n\nPubMed\n\nClark, Simon O; Kelly, Dominic L F; Badell, Edgar; Castello-Branco, Luiz Roberto; Aldwell, Frank; Winter, Nathalie; Lewis, David J M; Marsh, Philip D\n\n2010-10-08\n\nThere is a need for an improved vaccine to better control human tuberculosis (TB), as the only currently available TB vaccine, bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) delivered parenterally, offers variable levels of efficacy. Therefore, recombinant strains expressing additional antigens are being developed alongside alternative routes to parenteral delivery. There is strong evidence that BCG Moreau (RdJ) is a safe and effective vaccine in humans when given by the oral route. This study compared the efficacy of a single oral dose of wild type BCG Moreau Rio de Janeiro (RdJ), or a recombinant RdJ strain expressing Ag85B-ESAT6 fusion protein, formulated with and without lipid to enhance oral delivery, with subcutaneous BCG Danish 1331 and saline control groups in a guinea pig aerosol infection model of pulmonary tuberculosis. Protection was measured as survival at 30 weeks post-challenge and reduced bacterial load and histopathology in lungs and spleen. Results showed that a single oral dose of BCG Moreau (RdJ) or recombinant BCG Moreau (RdJ)-Ag85B-ESAT6, formulated with or without lipid, gave protection equivalent to subcutaneously delivered BCG Danish in the 30 weeks post-challenge survival study. The orally delivered vaccines gave reduced pathology scores in the lungs (three of the four formulations) and spleens (all four formulations) compared to subcutaneously delivered BCG Danish. The oral wild type BCG Moreau (RdJ) in lipid and the unformulated oral wild type BCG Moreau (RdJ) vaccine also gave statistically lower bacterial loads in the lungs and spleens, respectively, compared to subcutaneously delivered BCG Danish. This study provides further evidence to show that lipid formulation does not impair vaccine efficacy and may enhance the delivery and stability of oral vaccines intended for use in countries with poor health infrastructure. Oral delivery also avoids needles (and associated cross-infection risks) and immunisation without the need for specially trained\n\n[BCG vaccines for the prevention of tuberculosis in the world].\n\nPubMed\n\nHashimoto, T\n\n1997-11-01\n\nThe BCG vaccines will celebrate the 100th anniversary of their discovery in a decade at the beginning of the next century since Albert Calmette and Camille Guerin had presented it before the Academie des Sciences in 1908. At present tuberculosis kills more people than any other infectious disease about 3 million people a year, including almost 300,000 children under 15, and is producing over 7,000 deaths and over 24,000 new cases every day. Therefore, WHO declared a global health emergency in 1993. More worse, recently multi-drug resistant tubercle bacilli are emerging rapidly making TB patients incurable. Under these situations we need a potent anti-tuberculosis vaccine. So first of all, we must check the century-old BCG before proceeding further. At moment, the BCG vaccines are being used worldwide in the largest quantities in the world, but still most controversial vaccines anywhere. I would like to describe here their success and failure in the combat against the white plague. 1. The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). In 1974, when the EPI was launched by WHO, less than 5% of the world children were immunized against six infectious diseases including tuberculosis. In 1995 statistics, BCG gave the highest vaccination coverage, 87% higher than any other 5 vaccines of EPI for children. The BCG in EPI must have saved a lot of infants as the vaccine, has been proved to be most effective against the blood-born tuberculosis of child type. 2. The efficacy of BCG vaccination against tuberculosis. Results of each 10 of randomized controlled trials (RCT) and Case-control studies (CCS) showed the protective efficacy against tuberculosis as uncertain, unpredictable, as protective efficacy varied from 80% to 0%. More recently, a Meta-analysis of selected papers on BCG field trials which were so far collected. They recalculated vaccine protective effect separately for pulmonary TB and for meningeal/miliary TB in the trials. As the result, it was found that protective\n\nRole of fibronectin in intravesical BCG therapy for superficial bladder cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nRatliff, T L; Kavoussi, L R; Catalona, W J\n\n1988-02-01\n\nIntravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has been demonstrated to be effective both for prophylaxis and treatment of superficial bladder cancer. In order to identify the progression of events that result in BCG-mediated antitumor activity, studies were performed to evaluate the mechanism of binding of BCG within the bladder. Histological and quantitative studies in a mouse model revealed that BCG attached to the bladder wall only in areas of urothelial damage. Preliminary in vitro data showed that BCG attached to surfaces coated with extracellular matrix proteins. Further studies were then performed using purified extracellular matrix proteins to identify the proteins responsible for attachment. BCG were observed to attach to surfaces coated only with purified fibronectin (FN) but not to other purified proteins including laminin, collagen or fibrinogen. The attachment of BCG to purified FN in vitro was dose dependent and was inhibited by anti-FN antibodies. Moreover, BCG attachment in vivo to bladders with damaged urothelial surfaces was inhibited more than 95% by anti-FN antibodies, but binding was not affected by anti-laminin antibodies or preimmune serum. A survey of commercially available BCG vaccines (Pasteur, Tice, Glaxo, Connaught) showed that only Glaxo BCG did not attach to FN-coated surfaces. Glaxo BCG also was shown to express inferior antitumor activity suggesting that the absence of FN binding by Glaxo may have been associated with the absence of antitumor activity of the vaccine.\n\nIpr1 modified BCG as a novel vaccine induces stronger immunity than BCG against tuberculosis infection in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Yuwei; Yang, Chun; He, Yonglin; Zhan, Xingxing; Xu, Lei\n\n2016-08-01\n\nTuberculosis is a major challenge to global public health. However, the Bacille CalmetteâGuÃ©rin (BCG), the only vaccine available against tuberculosis, has been questioned for the low protective effect. The present study used the mouse gene intracellular pathogen resistance I (Ipr1) gene to alter the current BCG vaccine and evaluated its immunity effect against tuberculosis. This study also investigated the intrinsic relationships of Ipr1 and innate immunity. The reformed BCG (BCGi) carrying the Ipr1 gene was constructed. The mice were intranasally challenged with the M.Â tuberculosis H37Rv strain after vaccination with BCGi. Protection efficacy of the vaccine was assessed by the organ coefficient, bacterial load and pathological changes in the lung. The differential expression of 113Â immuneârelated genes between BCGi and BCG groups were detected by an oligo microarray. According to the results of organ coefficient, bacterial load and pathological changes in the organization, BCGi had been shown to have stronger protective effects against M.Â tuberculosis than BCG. The oligo microarray and reverse transcriptionâquantitative polymerase chain reaction further revealed that the Ipr1 gene could upregulate the expression of 13 genes, including a >3âfold increase in Tollâlike receptor (TLR)4 and 10âfold increase in surfactant proteinÂ D (sftpd). The two genes not only participate in innate immunity against pathogens, but also are closely interrelated. Ipr1 could activate the TLR4 and sftpd signaling pathway and improve the innate immunity against tuberculosis, therefore Ipr1 modified BCG may be a candidate vaccine against M.Â tuberculosis.\n\nEvolution of the BCG in Disturbed Galaxy Clusters\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nArdila, Felipe; Strauss, Michael A.; Lauer, Tod R.; Postman, Marc\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe present paradigm in cosmology tells us that large-scale structures grow hierarchically. This suggests that galaxy clusters grow by accreting mass and merging with other clusters, a process which should be detectable by the presence of substructure within a cluster. Using the Dressler-Shectman (DS) three-dimensional test for dynamical substructure, we determined which clusters showed evidence for disturbance from a set of 227 Abell clusters from Lauer et al. (2014) with at least 50 member galaxies and spectroscopic redshifts, z < 0.08. Our results show that 155 (68.2%) of the clusters showed evidence for substructure at â¥ 95% confidence, while 72 did not. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests suggest that the two populations of clusters (those with and without detected substructure) are significantly different in their distributions of BCG luminosities (Lm), but not in their BCG stellar velocity dispersions (Ï), their BCG spatial offsets from the x-ray centers of the clusters, their BCG velocity offsets from the mean cluster velocity, the logarithmic slopes of their BCG photometric curves of growth (Î±), their cluster velocity dispersions, or their luminosity differences between the BCG and the second-ranked galaxy in the cluster (M2). Similarly, no significant difference was found in the fitting of the Lm-Î±-Ï metric plane for BCGs of clusters with substructure compared those in which there is not substructure. This is surprising since our hierarchical growth models suggest that some of these BCG/cluster properties would be affected by a disturbance of the cluster, indicating that our understanding of how BCGs evolve with their clusters is incomplete and we should explore other ways to probe the level of disturbance.\n\nVariable Virulence and Efficacy of BCG Vaccine Strains in Mice and Correlation With Genome Polymorphisms\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhang, Lu; Ru, Huan-wei; Chen, Fu-zeng; Jin, Chun-yan; Sun, Rui-feng; Fan, Xiao-yong; Guo, Ming; Mai, Jun-tao; Xu, Wen-xi; Lin, Qing-xia; Liu, Jun\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBacille CalmetteâGuÃ©rin (BCG), an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, is the only vaccine available for tuberculosis (TB) control. However, BCG is not an ideal vaccine and has two major limitations: BCG exhibits highly variable effectiveness against the development of TB both in pediatric and adult populations and can cause disseminated BCG disease in immunocompromised individuals. BCG comprises a number of substrains that are genetically distinct. Whether and how these genetic differences affect BCG efficacy remains largely unknown. In this study, we performed comparative analyses of the virulence and efficacy of 13 BCG strains, representing different genetic lineages, in SCID and BALB/c mice. Our results show that BCG strains of the DU2 group IV (BCG-Phipps, BCG-Frappier, BCG-Pasteur, and BCG-Tice) exhibit the highest levels of virulence, and BCG strains of the DU2 group II (BCG-Sweden, BCG-Birkhaug) are among the least virulent group. These distinct levels of virulence may be explained by strain-specific duplications and deletions of genomic DNA. There appears to be a general trend that more virulent BCG strains are also more effective in protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis challenge. Our findings have important implications for current BCG vaccine programs and for future TB vaccine development.

Of 268 children exposed, 18 were eventually diagnosed with active tuberculosis. We present the initial clinical and radiographic characteristics of the active disease group. Mantoux testing was positive in only 66% of cases. All cases were either pulmonary or involved hilar adenopathy on chest radiograph; there were no cases of disseminated disease or meningitis. 24% of the exposed children had been previously vaccinated with BCG, and no case of active disease was found in this group (p = 0.016), suggesting a profound protective effect of BCG in this population. Our experience provides evidence supporting a protective effect of BCG against pulmonary disease in young children.\n\n[Disseminated BCG infection in patients with urinary bladder carcinoma].\n\nPubMed\n\nKoraÄ, Milos; MiloseviÄ, Branko; LavadinoviÄ, Lidija; JanjiÄ, Aleksandar; BrmboliÄ, Branko\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBacillus Calmette-GuÃ«rin--a live, attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis has been used in immunotherapy of patients with superficial urinary bladder carcinoma. Some patients develop complications after intravesical instillation of BCG: high temperature followed by hematuria or granulomatous prostatits, epidydimoorchitis, urethral obstruction, and less than 1% have a systemic disease followed by dissemination of bacteria into other organs. A 50-year-old man underwent transurethral resection of a bladder tumor. One month after the operation BCG intravesical installations were administered for three weeks. After the fourth installation, our patient developed high fever, fatigue, vomiting, dark urine, light stools, and jaundice. On admission he was jaundiced with a high fever, enlarged liver and spleen and laboratory findings which included high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, pancytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, especially alkaline phosphatase and aminotranspherases. The bone-marrow biopsy showed granulomatous inflamation suggesting mycobacterial spread in the bone marrow, liver and spleen and sepsis. The patient was initially treated with antituberculous therapy, but his state did not improve until corticosteroids were added to the antituberculous treatment regimen. Although dissemination of BCG is a rare complication of intravesical BCG treatment of the bladder carcinoma, it may result in prolonged fever and granulomatous inflamation of the liver, spleen, lungs, bone marrow and BCG sepsis. Antituberclous agents in combination with corticosteroids comprise the treatment of choice for disseminated BCG infection.\n\nBCG-SSI(Â®) vaccine-associated lymphadenitis: Incidence and management.\n\nPubMed\n\nEngelis, Arnis; Kakar, Mohit; MeikÅ¡Äns, Roberts; Petersons, Aigars\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThere is a high incidence of childhood tuberculosis in Latvia, including children aged less than 1 year, while BCG-associated lymphadenitis is one of the most frequent adverse events requiring surgical treatment. The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence of purulent BCG adenitis through-out the population of Latvia after the introduction of BCG-SSI(Â®) vaccine and to evaluate the treatment results. The study included 194 patients. All patients had received the BCG-SSI(Â®) vaccine during the first week of life routinely or at a later time according to the indications. The indications for surgical treatment were lymph node destruction also affecting the skin. All patients in this study received surgical treatment - the affected lymph node extirpation. The mean age of the patients was 5.12Â±0.96 months. A total of 172 patients had purulent axillar lymphadenitis, 14 had purulent supraclavicular lymphadenitis, 8 patients had lymphadenitis at both localizations. During the whole study period the incidence of BCG adenitis varied from 0.02% to 0.36%, while the mean rate was 0.11%Â±0.08% from 184,068 vaccinated children during the study period. We observed an increasing trend in the incidence of BCG lymphadenitis during the study period. The primary and complete healing rate at the end of period was 99.5% (n=193) following an affected lymph node extirpation. The mean hospitalization time after the operation was 3.71Â±0.18 days. The incidence of BCG-SSI(Â®) vaccine associated purulent lymphadenitis varied widely with an increasing trend, followed by the return to the product characteristic limits. Indications for the surgical treatment should not be changed. Extirpation of the purulent BCG adenitis is a safe treatment method and leads to the primary wound healing in the majority of cases.

BCG vaccine is contraindicated in patients with SCID. Because most countries encourage BCG vaccination at birth, a high percentage of patients with SCID are vaccinated before their immune defect is detected. We sought to describe the complications and risks associated with BCG vaccination in patients with SCID. An extensive standardized questionnaire evaluating complications, therapeutics, and outcomes regarding BCG vaccination in patients given a diagnosis of SCID was widely distributed. Summary statistics and association analysis was performed. Data on 349 BCG-vaccinated patients with SCID from 28 centers in 17 countries were analyzed. Fifty-one percent of the patients had BCG-associated complications, 34% disseminated and 17% localized (a 33,000- and 400-fold increase, respectively, over the general population). Patients receiving early vaccination (â¤1 month) showed an increased prevalence of complications (PÂ = .006) and death caused by BCG-associated complications (PÂ < .0001). The odds of experiencing complications among patients with T-cell numbers of 250/Î¼L or less at diagnosis was 2.1 times higher (95% CI, 1.4-3.4 times higher; PÂ = .001) than among those with T-cell numbers of greater than 250/Î¼L. BCG-associated complications were reported in 2 of 78 patients who received antimycobacterial therapy while asymptomatic, and no deaths caused by BCG-associated complications occurred in this group. In contrast, 46 BCG-associated deaths were reported among 160Â patients treated with antimycobacterial therapy for a symptomatic BCG infection (PÂ < .0001). BCG vaccine has a very high rate of complications in patients with SCID, which increase morbidity and mortality rates. Until safer and more efficient antituberculosis vaccines become available, delay in BCG vaccination should be considered to protect highly vulnerable populations from preventable complications\n\nCultivation of Mycobacterium bovis BCG in bioreactors.\n\nPubMed\n\nDietrich, Guido; Mollenkopf, Hans-Joachim; Weber, Heinz; Knapp, Bernhard; Diehl, Klaus-Dieter; Hess, JÃ¼rgen; Blackkolb, Friedrich; BrÃ¶ker, Michael; Kaufmann, Stefan H E; Hundt, Erika\n\n2002-07-03\n\nThe Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine for commercial use is classically produced as surface pellicles by culture on synthetic medium. Under these conditions, reproducibility of the cultures and quality assessment are hampered by slow growth of the bacilli, the formation of bacterial aggregates and a high proportion of dead bacilli after processing and final formulation of the vaccine. Here, we established dispersed cultures of M. bovis BCG in synthetic media in small-scale bioreactors. These cultures allow recording and adjusting of culture parameters and give rise to single bacilli with a high degree of live bacteria. In the murine model, bioreactor-grown M. bovis BCG exhibited slightly stronger replication and persistence than the vaccine produced under the classical conditions. The protective efficacy against challenge with M. tuberculosis was identical for both vaccine preparations.\n\nAge-related waning of in vitro Interferon-Î³ levels against r32kDaBCG in BCG vaccinated children\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAnuradha, B; Santosh, CM; Hari Sai Priya, V; Suman Latha, G; Murthy, KJR; Vijaya Lakshmi, Valluri\n\n2007-01-01\n\nBackground Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine has displayed inconsistent efficacy in different trials conducted in various geographical regions. Nevertheless, it significantly reduces the risk of severe childhood tuberculosis and continues to be used to prevent tuberculosis in many countries. Many studies revealed that efficacy of vaccine wanes with age. Most of the studies were based on in vivo and in vitro responses to tuberculin. With the advent of newer tests such as in vitro interferon-Î³ assays and identification of potent immunogenic mycobacterial proteins there is a need to corroborate the observations. This study aims at ascertaining the need for a booster at a later age as indicated by in vitro release of IFN-Î³ while evaluating Ag85A as an antigen. Methods Ninety healthy children who were without any clinical evidence of the disease, 45 with a BCG-scar and the remaining 45 without scar and 25 with tuberculosis were included in the study. The incidence of TB was analyzed in 216 children attending a DOTS clinic during 1996â2005. CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts were measured by Flow cytometry. r32kDaBCG (Ag85A-BCG) protein was used to stimulate T cells in in vitro T cell responses and interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) cytokine levels in the supernatants were measured by ELISA. Results High incidence of TB was observed in age group 13â14 years followed by children in the age group 10â12 years (Chi-square 242.22; p < 0.000). T cell subsets were within the normal range in all subjects. 79% of vaccinated children showed positive proliferative responses with a mean SI value of 4.98 Â± 1.99 while only 39% of the unvaccinated and 58% of the tuberculosis children showed positive responses with mean values of 2.9 Â± 1.6 (p < 0.001) and 2.9 Â± 1.7(p < 0.057), respectively. The stimulation indices in vaccinated children decreased in the older children concurring with an increase in the incidence of TB.

One possible explanation for this variability is increased exposure of certain populations to non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). This study used a murine model to determine the effect that exposure to NTM after BCG vaccination had on the efficacy of BCG against aerosol Mycobacterium tuberculosis challenge. The effects of administering live Mycobacterium avium (MA) by an oral route and killed MA by a systemic route on BCG-induced protection were evaluated. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were profiled to define the immunological mechanisms underlying any effect on BCG efficacy. BCG efficacy was enhanced by exposure to killed MA administered by a systemic route; T helper 1 and T helper 17 responses were associated with increased protection. BCG efficacy was reduced by exposure to live MA administered by the oral route; T helper 2 cells were associated with reduced protection. These findings demonstrate that exposure to NTM can induce opposite effects on BCG efficacy depending on route of exposure and viability of NTM. A reproducible model of NTM exposure would be valuable in the evaluation of novel TB vaccine candidates. Copyright Â© 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Catalase activities of the substrains were all low. Data for nitrate reduction, niacin accumulation, Tween 80 hydrolysis, susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide and nitrate, and optimal pH for growth were all variable among these substrains. These findings suggest that the heterogeneities of biochemical characteristics are relevant to the differences in resistance of BCG substrains to environmental stress. The study also contributes to the re-evaluation of BCG substrains for use as vaccines.\n\nIL-18 Does not Increase Allergic Airway Disease in Mice When Produced by BCG\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAmniai, L.; Biet, F.; Marquillies, P.; Locht, C.; Pestel, J.; Tonnel, A.-B.; Duez, C.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nWhilst BCG inhibits allergic airway responses in murine models, IL-18 has adversary effects depending on its environment. We therefore constructed a BCG strain producing murine IL-18 (BCG-IL-18) and evaluated its efficiency to prevent an asthma-like reaction in mice. BALB/cByJ mice were sensitized (day (D) 1 and D10) by intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin (OVA)-alum and primary (D20â22) and secondary (D62, 63) challenged with OVA aerosols. BCG or BCG-IL-18 were intraperitonealy administered 1 hour before each immunization (D1 and D10). BCG-IL-18 and BCG were shown to similarly inhibit the development of AHR, mucus production, eosinophil influx, and local Th2 cytokine production in BAL, both after the primary and secondary challenge. These data show that IL-18 did not increase allergic airway responses in the context of the mycobacterial infection, and suggest that BCG-IL-18 and BCG are able to prevent the development of local Th2 responses and therefore inhibit allergen-induced airway responses even after restimulation.

Here we report the first efficacy data on using these vaccines in cattle, a natural target species of tuberculous infection. Protection was determined by measuring development of disease as an end point after M. bovis challenge. Either Ad85A or MVA85A boosting resulted in protection superior to that given by BCG alone: boosting BCG with MVA85A or Ad85A induced significant reduction in pathology in four/eight parameters assessed, while BCG vaccination alone did so in only one parameter studied. Protection was particularly evident in the lungs of vaccinated animals (median lung scores for naÃ¯ve and BCG-, BCG/MVA85A-, and BCG/Ad85A-vaccinated animals were 10.5, 5, 2.5, and 0, respectively). The bacterial loads in lymph node tissues were also reduced after viral boosting of BCG-vaccinated calves compared to those in BCG-only-vaccinated animals. Analysis of vaccine-induced immunity identified memory responses measured by cultured enzyme-linked immunospot assay as well as in vitro interleukin-17 production as predictors of vaccination success, as both responses, measured before challenge, correlated positively with the degree of protection. Therefore, this study provides evidence of improved protection against tuberculosis by viral booster vaccination in a natural target species and has prioritized potential correlates of vaccine efficacy for further evaluation. These findings also have implications for human tuberculosis vaccine development.\n\nMRP8/14 induces autophagy to eliminate intracellular Mycobacterium bovis BCG.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Jinli; Huang, Chunyu; Wu, Minhao; Zhong, Qiu; Yang, Kun; Li, Miao; Zhan, Xiaoxia; Wen, Jinsheng; Zhou, Lin; Huang, Xi\n\n2015-04-01\n\nTo explore the role of myeloid-related protein 8/14 in mycobacterial infection. The mRNA and protein expression levels of MRP8 or MRP14 were measured by real-time PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. Role of MRP8/14 was tested by overexpression or RNA interference assays. Flow cytometry and colony forming unit were used to test the phagocytosis and the survival of intracellular Mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG), respectively. Autophagy mediated by MRP8/14 was detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence. The colocalization of BCG phagosomes with autophagosomes or lysosomes was by detected by confocal microscopy. ROS production was detected by flow cytometry. MRP8/14 expressions were up-regulated in human monocytic THP1 cells and primary macrophages after mycobacterial challenge. Silencing of MRP8/14 suppressed bacterial killing, but had no influence on the phagocytosis of BCG. Importantly, silencing MRP8/14 decreased autophagy and BCG phagosome maturation in THP1-derived macrophages, thereby increasing the BCG survival. Additionally, we demonstrated that MRP8/14 promoted autophagy in a ROS-dependent manner. The present study revealed a novel role of MRP8/14 in the autophagy-mediated elimination of intracellular BCG by promoting ROS generation, which may provide a promising therapeutic target for tuberculosis and other intracellular bacterial infectious diseases.

We assembled the data from high-throughput sequencing with SOAPdenovo software, with many contigs and scaffolds obtained. There are many sequence gaps and physical gaps remained as a result of regional low coverage and low quality. We designed primers at the end of contigs and performed PCR amplification in order to link these contigs and scaffolds. With various enzymes to perform PCR amplification, adjustment of PCR reaction conditions, and combined with clone construction to sequence, all the gaps were finished. We obtained the complete genome sequence of BCG Tice and submitted it to GenBank of National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The genome of BCG Tice is 4334064 base pairs in length, with GC content 65.65%. The problems and strategies during the finishing step of BCG Tice sequencing are illuminated here, with the hope of affording some experience to those who are involved in the finishing step of genome sequencing. The microarray data were verified by our results.\n\nPreliminary results from BCG and ECG measurements in the heart failure clinic.\n\nPubMed\n\nGiovangrandi, Laurent; Inan, Omer T; Banerjee, Dipanjan; Kovacs, Gregory T A\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWe report on the preliminary deployment of a bathroom scale-based ballistocardiogram (BCG) system for the in-hospital monitoring of patients with heart failure. These early trials provided valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities for such monitoring. In particular, the need for robust algorithms and adapted BCG metric is suggested. The system was designed to be robust and user-friendly, with dual ballistocardiogram (BCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) capabilities. The BCG was measured from a modified bathroom scale, while the ECG (used as timing reference) was measured using dry handlebar electrodes. The signal conditioning and digitization circuits were USB-powered, and data acquisition performed using a netbook. Four patients with a NYHA class III at admission were measured daily for the duration of their treatment at Stanford hospital. A measure of BCG quality, in essence a quantitative implementation of the BCG classes originally defined in the 1950s, is proposed as a practical parameter.\n\nRodent malaria: BCG-induced protection and immunosuppression. [Mice, gamma radiation, Plasmodium berghei\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSmrkovski, L.L.; Strickland, G.T.\n\n1978-10-01\n\nOne dose of 10/sup 7/ viable units of Mycobacterium bovis, strain BCG, protected a significant number of Swiss mice from a primary challenge with 10/sup 4/ thoracic sporozoites of Plasmodium berghei. Immunization with irradiated sporozoites induced greater protection than that observed in BCG-treated animals. Mice treated with BCG and surviving a primary sporozoite challenge were not protected from rechallenge, whereas mice immunized with irradiated sporozoites and surviving initial challenge of sporozoites were solidly immune to further challenge. Immunizing mice with BCG and irradiated sporozoites simulataneously resulted in a synergistic effect of increased protection against a primary challenge of sporozoites onlymoreÂ Â» if the two immunogens were administered on the same day and if the mice were challenged 1 to 3 days later. Mice given BCG and irradiated sporozoites and surviving a primary challenge of sporozoites were unable to survive rechallenge. BCG given to mice previously immunized with irradiated sporozoites suppressed their protective immunity against sporozoite challenge.Â«Â less\n\nCauses of variation in BCG vaccine efficacy: examining evidence from the BCG REVAC cluster randomized trial to explore the masking and the blocking hypotheses.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarreto, Mauricio L; Pilger, Daniel; Pereira, Susan M; Genser, Bernd; Cruz, Alvaro A; Cunha, Sergio S; Sant'Anna, Clemax; Hijjar, Miguel A; Ichihara, Maria Y; Rodrigues, Laura C\n\n2014-06-24\n\nBCG protection varies and in some places (nearest the equator) is low or absent. Understanding this variation can inform the efforts to develop new vaccines against tuberculosis. Two main hypotheses are used to explain this variation: under masking, new vaccines are unlikely to increase protection; under blocking new vaccines have a greater potential to be effective when BCG is not. We conducted a cluster randomized trial to explored the masking and blocking hypotheses by studying BCG vaccine efficacy of neonatal vaccination and when administered for the first or a second (revaccination) time at school age in two sites (Manaus close and Salvador further south from the equator). Seven hundred and sixty three state schools were matched on socio economic characteristics of the neighborhood and 239,934 children were randomized to vaccine (BCG vaccination at school age) or control group. Protection by first BCG vaccination at school age was high in Salvador (34%, 95% CI 7-53%, p=0.017) but low in Manaus (8%, 95% CI t0 39-40%, p=0.686). For revaccination at school age, protection was modest in Salvador (19%, 95% CI 3-33%, p=0.022) and absent in Manaus (1%, 95% CI to 27-23%, p=0.932). Vaccine efficacy for neonatal vaccination was similar in Salvador (40%, 95% CI 22-54%, p<0.001) and Manaus (36%, 95% CI 11-53%, p=0.008). Variation in BCG efficacy was marked when vaccine was given at school age but absent at birth, which points towards blocking as the dominant mechanism. New tuberculosis vaccines that overcome or by pass this blocking effect could confer protection in situations where BCG is not protective. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Although BCG-based therapy is the most effective intravesical therapy for this kind of tumor and represents the only agent known to reduce progression into muscle invasive bladder cancer, BCG is ineffective in approximately 30-40 % of cases and disease recurs in up to 50 % of patients. Since that BCG is considered an effective vehicle for delivery of antigens due to its unique characteristics, the genetic manipulation of these mycobacteria has been appealing in the search for less toxic and more potent therapeutic agents for bladder cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we discuss current advances in recombinant BCG construction, research, concerns, and future directions to promote the development of this promising immunotherapeutic approach for bladder cancer.\n\n[Lupoid syndrome in \"BCG-itis.\" Report of a case].\n\nPubMed\n\nRamÃ­rez, O; RamÃ­rez, R\n\n1986-01-01\n\nIt is presented the first case of lupoid syndrome of \"BCG-itis\" found in El Salvador.

E.; Ponnighaus, J. M.; Maine, N.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nReported are data on the BCG scar status of more than 112,000 individuals who were surveyed in Karonga District, northern Malawi, between 1979 and 1984. The age and sex patterns of apparent BCG scars reflect the history of BCG vaccination activities in the district. Repeated independent examinations of large numbers of people revealed that the proportions remaining with the same observed scar status among those initially classified as being scar \"positive\" or scar \"negative\" were each approximately 90%. The repeatability of positive scar reading was lower among children and older adults than among young adults aged 15-24 years, and blind follow-up of children known to have been vaccinated as infants in child health clinics indicated that less than 60% had a detectable scar 3 years after receiving the vaccine. \"Negative\" repeatability increased consistently with age. The implications of these findings for estimating BCG vaccine uptake and for assessing its efficacy in case-control and cohort studies are discussed. The finding that BCG scars may be difficult to read suggests there is a danger of observer bias that could lead to distortion--in particular, to overestimates of vaccine efficacy.

The increased efficacy of BCG due to zmp1 deletion was demonstrated in both BCG Pasteur and BCG Denmark indicating that the improved protection by zmp1 deletion is independent from the BCG sub-strain. In addition, unmarked BCG Îzmp1 mutant strains showed a better safety profile in a CB-17 SCID mouse survival model than the parental BCG strains. Together, these results support the further development of BCG Îzmp1 for use in clinical trials. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, no case of BCG-induced pleurisy has been reported. Case presentation We here report the first case of pneumonitis with lymphocytic pleurisy following bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy. Although marked T helper cell alveolitis was found by bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsies, no acid-fast bacillus could be identified in recovered BALF or pleural effusion. The lymphocyte stimulation test of BCG was strongly positive. However, levels of serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid KL-6, a useful marker for hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), were within normal ranges. Conclusion We speculate that the pathogenesis of our case may be a hypersensitive reaction to the proteic component of BCG entering the lung and pleural space, which is different from the etiology of the common type of HP.

The aim of this study was to characterise the genomic and immune proteomic profile of the BCG 1931 strain used in Mexico. Results BCG Mexico 1931 has a circular chromosome of 4,350,386 bp with a G+C content and numbers of genes and pseudogenes similar to those of BCG Tokyo and BCG Pasteur. BCG Mexico 1931 lacks Region of Difference 1 (RD1), RD2 and N-RD18 and one copy of IS6110, indicating that BCG Mexico 1931 belongs to DU2 group IV within the BCG vaccine genealogy. In addition, this strain contains three new RDs, which are 53 (RDMex01), 655 (RDMex02) and 2,847 bp (REDMex03) long, and 55 single-nucleotide polymorphisms representing non-synonymous mutations compared to BCG Pasteur and BCG Tokyo. In a comparative proteomic analysis, the BCG Mexico 1931, Danish, Phipps and Tokyo strains showed 812, 794, 791 and 701 protein spots, respectively. The same analysis showed that BCG Mexico 1931 shares 62% of its protein spots with the BCG Danish strain, 61% with the BCG Phipps strain and only 48% with the BCG Tokyo strain. Thirty-nine reactive spots were detected in BCG Mexico 1931 using sera from subjects with active tuberculosis infections and positive tuberculin skin tests. Conclusions BCG Mexico 1931 has a smaller genome than the BCG Pasteur and BCG Tokyo strains. Two specific deletions in BCG Mexico 1931 are described (RDMex02 and RDMex03). The loss of RDMex02 (fadD23) is associated with enhanced macrophage binding and RDMex03 contains genes that may be involved in regulatory pathways. We also describe new antigenic proteins for the first time.

In this study, we asked a question whether M. bovis BCG mycobacteria which are known for the preferential stimulation of T helper-1 (Th1) immunity, diminish the effector functions of Th2 cells from allergic patients upon stimulation with a common house dust mite Der p-1 allergen. Our results allow a positive answer to this question. We demonstrate that BCG modulates the dendritic cell-dependent allergen presentation process and switches naive T lymphocytes towards an anti-allergic Th1 profile.\n\n[Relationship between BCG immunization coverage and the immunization delivery system in the Tama area of Tokyo].\n\nPubMed\n\nSugishita, Yoshiyuki; Hayashi, Kunihiko; Mori, Toru; Horiguchi, Itsuko; Marui, Eiji\n\n2012-03-01\n\nThe BCG immunization has long been performed in Japan. Although the BCG immunization service is the responsibility of the municipality, the manner in which the BCG immunization is delivered differs from municipality to municipality. The purpose of this study was to clarify how the different manner of the BCG immunization delivery systems influenced the BCG immunization coverage. The study of BCG immunization coverage was conducted in the Tama area located in the western suburbs of Tokyo in 2004. The birth data and the immunization history by the age of 3 years were collected in the three-year-old health check-up from a total of 2,341 children residing in the Tama area. Based on the age at immunization for each child, the BCG immunization coverage was calculated according to the types of the BCG immunization delivery system. The immunization types were defined as follows; the BCG immunization given on the occasion of the mass health check-up (Group 1); the exclusive mass BCG immunization in a monthly service (Group 2); the exclusive mass BCG immunization in a bimonthly service (Group 3); the exclusive mass BCG immunization in services of fewer than every two months (Group 4); and the immunization given on an individual basis by a general practitioner (Group 5). A univariate analysis was performed to examine the relationship between the BCG immunization coverage by the age of 6 months and the difference among the BCG immunization delivery systems, followed by a multivariate regression analysis to adjust for the factors related to the demography, health care services and the socio-economic status of the municipalities. Unadjusted odds ratios and adjusted odds ratios for BCG unimmunized children under the age of 6 months by the BCG immunization delivery manner groups were OR 1 reference, adj. OR 1 reference in Group 1; OR 1.42 CI 0.87-2.29, adj. OR 4.01 CI 2.24-7.11 in Group 2; OR 4.96 CI 3.66-6.82, adj.

We studied the combined immune-potential effectiveness of intranasal application of Lentinan (at a dose of 1 mg/kg, three times at 2-day intervals), followed by administration of BCG (strain Sofia SL-222 at a dose of 1 x 10(8) CFU, once) in guinea pigs. Samples of broncho-alveolar lavage fluid, as well as tissue fragments of lungs, spleens and lymph nodes were obtained from four groups (combined treatment with Lentinan and BCG; only with Lentinan; only with BCG; control with saline) of animals at different intervals--1, 14 and 45 days after last treatment and were evaluated by several parameters (establishing the number, H2O2 and nitrite production, and killing ability against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus of alveolar macrophages; spleen index, BCG CFU in spleens and histomorphological observations). Our attention was focused both on local effects in lungs, and systematical effects in reticuloendothelial system. The results indicate that intranasal application of BCG alone, or in combination with Lentinan induced high level of alveolar macrophage activation. Pre-treatment with Lentinan enhanced the local immunohistological response to BCG in lung and reduced the generalized side effects.\n\nDisseminated Mycobacterium bovis infection post-kidney transplant following remote intravesical BCG therapy for bladder cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nZiegler, Jennifer; Ho, Julie; Gibson, Ian W; Nayak, Jasmir G; Stein, Markus; Walkty, Andrew; Orr, Pamela\n\n2018-05-29\n\nIntravesical Bacillus Camlette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) is the treatment of choice for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, and has been used successfully for over 40 years. A rare and potentially fatal complication of intravesical BCG therapy is BCG-induced sepsis. We report a rare case in which a patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to chronic granulomatous interstitial nephritis underwent remote, pre-transplant intravesical BCG treatment for high-grade non-invasive papillary bladder carcinoma. The patient subsequently received a deceased donor kidney transplant 5 years after BCG therapy, with thymoglobulin induction therapy and standard triple maintenance immunosuppression. Two years post-transplant, he developed BCG-induced sepsis confirmed by cultures from urine, blood and left native kidney biopsy. He died from disseminated BCG-induced sepsis and failure of his renal allograft. This case highlights the potential adverse reactions associated with intravesical BCG therapy that may occur years after bladder cancer therapy is completed, and should heighten physician awareness for BCG-related infections during pre-transplant assessment and post-transplant care of solid organ transplants recipients.

Previous studies showed that attachment of BCG to fibronectin within the bladder was necessary for mediation of the antitumor response. Further studies identified a bacterial receptor, fibronectin attachment protein (FAP), as an important mediator of BCG attachment to fibronectin. In vitro studies showed that a stable BCG/fibronectin interaction was dependent on FAP binding to fibronectin; however, no role for FAP in the attachment of BCG in vivo has been characterized. We now report the cloning of the M. bovis BCG FAP (FAP-B) and demonstrate an important role for FAP in the in vivo attachment of BCG to the bladder wall and in the induction of BCG-mediated antitumor activity. The predicted amino acid sequence for FAP-B shows 61% and 71% homology, respectively, with Mycobacterium avium FAP (FAP-A) and Mycobacterium leprae FAP (FAP-L). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Mycobacterium vaccae FAP (FAP-V) reacted with all 3 recombinant FAP proteins on Western blots. Functional studies show FAP-B to bind fibronectin via the highly conserved attachment regions previously identified for FAP-A and FAP-L and also to competitively inhibit attachment of BCG to matrix fibronectin. In vivo studies show FAP to be a necessary protein for the stable attachment of BCG to the bladder wall. Moreover, stable binding of BCG via FAP was shown to be necessary for the expression of BCG-induced antitumor activity. Our results demonstrate a biological role for FAP in the mediation of BCG-induced antitumor activity.\n\nAn update on vaccines for tuberculosis - there is more to it than just waning of BCG efficacy with time.\n\nPubMed\n\nRomano, Marta; Huygen, Kris\n\n2012-12-01\n\nApart from better diagnostics and new anti-microbial drugs, an effective vaccine for tuberculosis is urgently needed to halt this poverty-related disease, afflicting millions of people worldwide. After a general introduction on the global threat of tuberculosis, the pros and cons of the existing M. bovis BCG vaccine are discussed. As the correlates of protection against tuberculosis remain largely unknown, new findings in biomarker research are described. Next, an update on the ongoing Phase I and Phase II clinical trials is given. Finally, some of the most promising novel pre-clinical developments using live attenuated vaccines, sub-unit vaccines, prime-boost strategies, and new vaccination routes are discussed. The field has made considerable progress and 12 vaccine candidates have now actually entered Phase I or Phase IIa and IIb clinical trials. It is argued that the variable protection conferred by the existing BCG vaccine against reactivation of latent TB is caused not only by waning of its efficacy with time but also by its weak induction of MHC class I restricted responses. Prime-boost strategies based on the actual BCG vaccine may not be sufficient to overcome this hurdle. The use of plasmid DNA vaccination might offer a solution.\n\nEffect of intradermal tuberculin tests on BCG-induced allergy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMagnus, Knut\n\n1957-01-01\n\nTrials are going forward to determine whether intradermal tuberculin testing with 10 TU at yearly intervals after BCG vaccination may prevent waning of BCG-induced allergy in schoolchildren. Meanwhile, two experiments to the same purpose, carried out in guinea-pigs, are described. They show that waning allergy in guinea-pigs can be sustantially enhanced by intradermal injection of either purified tuberculin or Old Tuberculin, the effect lasting for at least 8 weeks, even with so small a dose as 5 TU. It is pointed out that this enhancing effect has been demonstrated only in BCG-vaccinated guinea-pigs and that it is not known whether the same phenomenon would occur in guinea-pigs infected with living human tubercle bacilli.

Cell-fraction proteins of BCG Denmark and Phipps substrains were separated into approximately 500 spots in 2D-PAGE. The proteomes were similar in protein number, and isoelectric point (pI) and molecular mass (MM) distribution. Statistical analysis, resulted in 72 spots with no change, and 168 and 90 unique for BCG Phipps or Denmark, respectively. Two hundred and fourteen spots showed changes in intensity of >1-fold, 138 of Denmark, and 76 of Phipps. Seventeen spots were selected for MS-based identification (13 from Phipps and 4 from Denmark), including unique, as well as proteins with changes in intensity. The proteins identified participate in virulence, detoxification, adaptation, lipid metabolism, information pathways, cell wall and cell processes, intermediary metabolism and respiration, or still hypotheticals. Our findings contribute to phenotype characterization of BCG substrains and provide new elements to consider for the design of diagnostic tools, drug targets and a new vaccine against tuberculosis based upon protein expression through quantitative statistical analysis.\n\nVEGF signaling mediates bladder neuroplasticity and inflammation in response to BCG\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground This work tests the hypothesis that increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) observed during bladder inflammation modulates nerve plasticity. Methods Chronic inflammation was induced by intravesical instillations of Bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) into the urinary bladder and the density of nerves expressing the transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily 1 (TRPV1) or pan-neuronal marker PGP9.5 was used to quantify alterations in peripheral nerve plasticity. Some mice were treated with B20, a VEGF neutralizing antibody to reduce the participation of VEGF. Additional mice were treated systemically with antibodies engineered to specifically block the binding of VEGF to NRP1 (anti-NRP1B) and NRP2 (NRP2B), or the binding of semaphorins to NRP1 (anti-NRP1 A) to diminish activity of axon guidance molecules such as neuropilins (NRPs) and semaphorins (SEMAs). To confirm that VEGF is capable of inducing inflammation and neuronal plasticity, another group of mice was instilled with recombinant VEGF165 or VEGF121 into the urinary bladder. Results The major finding of this work was that chronic BCG instillation resulted in inflammation and an overwhelming increase in both PGP9.5 and TRPV1 immunoreactivity, primarily in the sub-urothelium of the urinary bladder. Treatment of mice with anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody (B20) abolished the effect of BCG on inflammation and nerve density. NRP1A and NRP1B antibodies, known to reduce BCG-induced inflammation, failed to block BCG-induced increase in nerve fibers. However, the NRP2B antibody dramatically potentiated the effects of BCG in increasing PGP9.5-, TRPV1-, substance P (SP)-, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactivity (IR). Finally, instillation of VEGF121 or VEGF165 into the mouse bladder recapitulated the effects of BCG and resulted in a significant inflammation and increase in nerve density. Conclusions For the first time, evidence is being presented supporting that\n\nEffects of BCG infection on the susceptibility of mouse macrophages to endotoxin.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPeavy, D L; Baughn, R E; Musher, D M; Musher, D M\n\n1979-01-01\n\nMice infected intravenously with Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) are 100 to 1,000 times more sensitive to the lethal effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Since BCG infection results in macrophage activation and LPS may cause pathophysiological effects through interaction with this cell type, it was of interest to determine whether macrophages from BCG-infected animals were more susceptible to the toxic effects of LPS in vitro. When LPS-susceptible, C57BL/6 mice were infected with BCG, a significant reduction in the 50% lethal dose of LPS was first observed after 7 days and persisted for several weeks. Macrophages from these animals had greatly increased susceptibility to LPS in vitro, which correlated with the development of acquired cellular resistance as determined by their ability to inhibit the growth of Listeria monocytogenes. In contrast, BCG infection of C3H/HeJ mice, a strain resistant to LPS, did not alter the 50% lethal dose of LPS for these animals or increase the sensitivity of their peritoneal macrophages to LPS in vitro. These results indicate that susceptibility of BCG-infected mice to the lethal effects of LPS parallels the susceptibility of their macrophages in vitro; release of vasoactive substances from LPS-susceptible activated macrophages in vivo may be, in part, responsible for lethality.

In this article, we describe a case of suppurative lymphadenitis caused by BCG vaccination and propose diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines of the disease. The lymphadenitis was presented as skin involving mass and was completely extirpated. Pathological evaluation revealed a necrotising lymphadenitis, consistent with the diagnosis of BCG lymphadenitis. The patient was administered adjuvant medical treatment with anti-TB medications (Isoniazid and Rifampicin) for 3 months. At 6 months follow-up, the disease was in complete remission without complications. We recommend focus on the following four signs when diagnosing BCG lymphadenitis: (i) previous history of vaccination on the ipsilateral side of the lesion, (ii) absence of any other infection signs, (iii) absence of fever and (iv) isolated axillary or supraclavicular/cervical lymph node enlargement proven by ultrasonography or computed tomography scan. BCG vaccination-induced suppurative lymphadenitis can easily be overlooked, but prompt, accurate diagnosis followed by appropriate surgical resection should result in complete healing as in this case.

In this study we have analyzed and compared the proteins which are expressed differentially during broth-culture and intraphagosomal growth of M.bovis BCG. Eight proteins which showed increased expression during the intraphagosomal growth were identified by MALDI-TOF/MS. These were - a precursor of alanine and proline-rich secreted protein apa, isoforms of malate dehydrogenase, large subunit alpha (Alpha-ETF) of electron transfer flavoprotein, immunogenic protein MPB64 precursor, UPF0036 protein, and two proteins with unknown function. Based on these findings we speculate that higher expression of these proteins has a probable role in intracellular survival, adaptation and/or immunoprotective effect of BCG. Further, these proteins might also be used as gene expression markers for endosome trafficking events of BCG.\n\nProspects in Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette et GuÃ©rin (BCG) Vaccine Diversity and Delivery: Why does BCG fail to protect against Tuberculosis?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMoliva, Juan I.; Turner, Joanne; Torrelles, Jordi B.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection leads to active tuberculosis (TB), a disease that kills one human every 18 seconds. Current therapies available to combat TB include chemotherapy and the preventative vaccine Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette et GuÃ©rin (BCG). Increased reporting of drug resistant M.tb strains worldwide indicates that drug development cannot be the primary mechanism for eradication. BCG vaccination has been used globally for protection against childhood and disseminated TB, however, its efficacy at protecting against pulmonary TB in adult and aging populations is highly variable. In this regard, the immune response generated by BCG vaccination is incapable of sterilizing the lung post M.tb infection as indicated by the large proportion of individuals with latent TB infection that have received BCG. Although many new TB vaccine candidates have entered the development pipeline, only a few have moved to human clinical trials; where they showed no efficacy and/or were withdrawn due to safety regulations. These trials highlight our limited understanding of protective immunity against the development of active TB. Here, we discuss current vaccination strategies and their impact on the generation and sustainability of protective immunity against TB.

Their heterosubunit structure, bifunctionality and stimulation by AdoMet make them different from other classified restriction enzymes. Here we report on a new Bcg I-like restriction endonuclease, Bpl I from Bacillus pumilus , which in contrast to all other Bcg I-like enzymes, recognizes a symmetric interrupted sequence, and which, like Bcg I, cleaves double stranded DNA upstream and downstream of its recognition sequence (8/13)GAGN5CTC(13/8). Like Bcg I, Bpl I is a bifunctional enzyme revealing both DNA cleavage and methyltransferase activities. There are two polypeptides in the homogeneous preparation of Bpl I with molecular masses of approximately 74 and 37 kDa. The sizes of the Bpl I subunits are close to those of Bcg I, but the proportion 1:1 in the final preparation is different from that of 2:1 in Bcg I. Low activity observed with Mg2+increases >100-fold in the presence of AdoMet. Even with AdoMet though, specific cleavage is incomplete. S -adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) or sinefungin can replace AdoMet in the cleavage reaction. AdoHcy activated Bpl I yields complete cleavage of DNA.

The current study was aimed at determining whether a combination of delivering BCG by s.c. and oral routes would enhance levels of protection, compared to only one route of vaccination. Forty calves were randomly divided into four groups (10/group). Calves were vaccinated with 10(6)colony forming units (CFU) of BCG Pasteur by the s.c. route or orally with 10(9)CFU BCG incorporated into a lipid formulation. One group received a combination of BCG administered by both the s.c. and oral routes and a non-vaccinated group served as a control. The two groups of calves that received s.c. BCG produced strong IFN-gamma responses in whole blood cultures stimulated with bovine purified protein derivative (PPD) 3 weeks after vaccination. Cattle vaccinated just with oral BCG in a lipid matrix produced a strong IFN-gamma response 8 weeks after vaccination, and peaking at 11 weeks after vaccination. All calves were challenged by the intratracheal route with M. bovis 15 weeks after vaccination and were euthanized and necropsied to assess protection at 17 weeks following challenge. BCG given s.c. or orally induced significant and comparable levels of protection against the virulent challenge. Vaccination of cattle by a combination of s.c./oral routes did not enhance protection beyond that achieved by s.c. or oral vaccination alone. We conclude that vaccination of cattle with BCG by a combination of routes has no beneficial additive effects, compared to a single s.c. administration of BCG or BCG given orally in a lipid formulation.\n\nDemonstrating Functional Equivalence of Pilot and Production Scale Freeze-Drying of BCG.\n\nPubMed\n\nTen Have, R; Reubsaet, K; van Herpen, P; Kersten, G; Amorij, J-P\n\n2016-01-01\n\nProcess analytical technology (PAT)-tools were used to monitor freeze-drying of Bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) at pilot and production scale. Among the evaluated PAT-tools, there is the novel use of the vacuum valve open/close frequency for determining the endpoint of primary drying at production scale. The duration of primary drying, the BCG survival rate, and the residual moisture content (RMC) were evaluated using two different freeze-drying protocols and were found to be independent of the freeze-dryer scale evidencing functional equivalence. The absence of an effect of the freeze-dryer scale on the process underlines the feasibility of the pilot scale freeze-dryer for further BCG freeze-drying process optimization which may be carried out using a medium without BCG.\n\nRetrospective study of efficacy of intravesical BCG alone in treatment of superficial bladder cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nMydlo, J H; Usher, S M; Camacho, F; Freed, S\n\n1986-09-01\n\nThis is a review of 100 patients at our institution who were treated for superficial bladder cancer. In those patients with carcinoma in situ of the bladder who were treated with conventional therapy (resection and/or fulguration) and intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) without intradermal BCG, and those patients who were treated with conventional therapy alone, we found a response rate of 60 per cent versus 40 per cent at the end of three months. In comparing those patients with superficial papillary cancer, we found a response of 39 per cent after conventional therapy and 63 per cent after conventional therapy and intravesical BCG. This suggests that intravesical BCG without intradermal BCG can be an important adjunct to the conventional therapy of bladder tumors.\n\nRemoval of BCG artifacts using a non-Kirchhoffian overcomplete representation.\n\nPubMed\n\nDyrholm, Mads; Goldman, Robin; Sajda, Paul; Brown, Truman R\n\n2009-02-01\n\nWe present a nonlinear unmixing approach for extracting the ballistocardiogram (BCG) from EEG recorded in an MR scanner during simultaneous acquisition of functional MRI (fMRI). First, an overcomplete basis is identified in the EEG based on a custom multipath EEG electrode cap. Next, the overcomplete basis is used to infer non-Kirchhoffian latent variables that are not consistent with a conservative electric field. Neural activity is strictly Kirchhoffian while the BCG artifact is not, and the representation can hence be used to remove the artifacts from the data in a way that does not attenuate the neural signals needed for optimal single-trial classification performance. We compare our method to more standard methods for BCG removal, namely independent component analysis and optimal basis sets, by looking at single-trial classification performance for an auditory oddball experiment. We show that our overcomplete representation method for removing BCG artifacts results in better single-trial classification performance compared to the conventional approaches, indicating that the derived neural activity in this representation retains the complex information in the trial-to-trial variability.\n\nImmunotherapeutic effect of BCG-polysaccharide nucleic acid powder on Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected mice using microneedle patches.\n\nPubMed\n\nYan, Qinying; Liu, Houming; Cheng, Zhigang; Xue, Yun; Cheng, Zhide; Dai, Xuyong; Shan, Wanshui; Chen, Fan\n\n2017-11-01\n\nPolysaccharide nucleic acid fractions of bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin, termed BCG-PSN, have traditionally been used as immunomodulators in the treatment of dermatitis and allergic diseases. While the sales of injectable BCG-PSN have shown steady growth in recent years, no reports of using BCG-PSN powder or its immunotherapeutic effects exist. Here, BCG-PSN powder was applied directly to the skin to evaluate the immunotherapeutic effects on mice infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). In total, 34âÎ¼g of BC"
