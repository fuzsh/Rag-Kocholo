        "text": "As organizations increasingly depend on information technology for their operation, complexity of information systems becomes an important issue for management in the context of organizational engineering. This paper shows how the combination of cybernetics with conceptual modelling contributes to the measurement of complexity for the analysis and design of information systems and organizations. Based on the discussion of a language-based approach, we show how conceptual modelling as an instrument for organizational analysis can significantly contribute to organizational engineering if used in combination with an established theory for control and communication. Within an action case study in an information technology controlling setting, we apply the concept of variety as a measure for complexity in combination with conceptual modelling and explore its usefulness for the diagnosis and redesign of a controlling and reporting system.\n\nA universal-descriptive-definition of complexity is provided as a context for understanding the examples of approaches to complexity that miss the target. All situations have both quantitative and qualitative aspects of what they are. Qualitative aspects of complexity occur as organizational-complexity. Organizational-complexity increases as diversity of components and relations increase. Some of these approaches shy away from complexity through simplifying procedures that result in measuring something other than the actual complex situation itself. In doing so these methods lose touch with the qualitative organizational-complexity of the complex situation or system. These methods are too simple to capture the actual complexity. Another approach that misses the target is that of the specialist viewpoint that does not consider forms of complexity outside the specialty. This leads to definitions of complexity that are too limited in scope. A third approach that misses the target occurs when a powerful tool used in the approach dominates the thinking of the researcher. In this case the results can be less than realistic in their application to the complexity of reality. Quantitative methods should be applied within and conform to the context of the qualitative complexity.\n\nComplexity theory is an interesting complement to classic scientific theories. Although this topic is at the center of interest of a large group of researchers, there are only a few publications on this subject that can be found in Polish literature. The aim of this article is to fill this gap partially. Basic assumptions of complexity theory have been discussed. Examples of its applications in social and economic sciences as well as numerous applications in other areas have been analyzed. Particular attention was paid to the possibilities of practical application of elements of this theory in the management of complex business systems. The benefits resulting from the development of complexity theory were also shown\n\nThis article follows up on the author&#39;s 2010 article &quot;How and why complexity arises in IS&quot; in the magazine Systémová integrace (Systems Integration), which dealt with IS complexity as an important challenge for informatics, presenting a definition of complexity and describing the mechanisms by which it arises and its effects on an enterprise. The article also included a questionnaire study, through which several hypotheses were tested. In 2016 the author conducted a new study, using the same questions as in 2010 for one part and for the other part adding several other related questions on the reasons by which complexity arises in information systems and which methodologies are used for complexity management."
