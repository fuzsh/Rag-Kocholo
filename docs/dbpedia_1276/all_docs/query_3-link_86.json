        "text": "The majority of the Antarctic land surface is covered by ice and snow, resulting in only partial and scattered exposures of Cambrian carbonate platform deposits. Allochthonous archaeocyath-bearing clasts have, therefore, been crucial to establish both a regional biostratigraphic framework and to inform the palaeogeography between localities in Antarctica and southern Gondwana from the Cambrian through to the Late Palaeozoic glaciation records (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, at times, interpretations have been based solely on the presence of archaeocyaths. Meanwhile, the microfacies and diagenetic evolution of the Antarctic Cambrian carbonate platforms have been poorly studied.\n\nOften in Antarctica, the finding of allochthonous archaeocyaths has preceded the location of the Cambrian carbonate successions they came from (Hill Reference Hill1965; Cooper & Shergold Reference Cooper, Shergold and Tingey1991 and references therein). In fact, archaeocyaths were the first Cambrian fossils collected in Antarctica by the Bruce's Scottish National Antarctic Expedition (1902–1904) from deep sea gravels at the Weddel Sea (station 313; see Pirie Reference Pirie1913) and by the Shackleton's British Antarctic Expedition (1907–1909) from moraine deposits of the Beardmore Glacier at the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) (David & Priestley Reference David and Priestley1914). However, thick successions of Cambrian carbonate platforms only crop out along the TAM and in the Ellsworth Mountains (EW) at the W Antarctica region.\n\nThe intraplate TAM belt separates the E from W Antarctica regions (Fig. 2a) that present clear differences in their geological evolution. The E Antarctic Craton (EAC) is formed by the amalgamation of Precambrian terranes during different Precambrian–Cambrian orogenies (e.g., Boger Reference Boger2011). The geologic record of the TAM belt (see Goodge Reference Goodge2020) includes a Mesoarchaean and Paleoproterozoic basement (part of the EAC). This basement was rifted and developed an Andean-style Gondwana convergent margin with carbonate deposition (PM and cTAM in Fig. 1), basin inversion and clastic molasse-type sedimentation during the late Neoproterozoic to early Palaeozoic Ross orogenic cycle. Intra-cratonic and foreland basin sedimentation and mantle upwelling (Gondwana breakup) continued during Late Palaeozoic and Early Mesozoic times, and experimented rift-shoulder uplift related to Cenozoic extension (Goodge Reference Goodge2020). On the other hand, the W Antarctica extensional province is formed by Palaeozoic–Mesozoic microcontinental blocks (outboard terranes) as the Ellsworth–Whitmore Block (EWB), Thurston Island, Marie Byrd Land and the Antarctic Peninsula (Dalziel & Elliot Reference Dalziel and Elliot1982; EWB, TI, MBL, AP in Fig. 1) and both the Weddell Sea and W Antarctic rift systems (Fig. 2a). From ~500 Ma, the W Antarctica region is a tectonically active margin between the subducting paleo-Pacific oceanic plate and the EAC (Jordan et al. Reference Jordan, Riley and Siddoway2020 and references therein) (Fig. 1). Thus, the best known Cambrian carbonate successions in Antarctica (TAM and EW) were not part of the same carbonate platform, nor they did share a common tectonosedimentary evolution during the Cambrian – something that is key when establishing the origin of allochthonous archaeocyath-bearing clasts in the neighbouring regions of southern Gondwana (Fig. 1)\n\nOn the other hand, the record of Antarctic allochthonous archaeocyathan assemblages is abundant, scattered and, at times, very far from the hypothetical source areas, and some of them have not yet been studied. However, because less than 2 % of the bedrock is exposed in Antarctica, archaeocyath-bearing clasts are key records that give us a chance to solve many geological problems. For instance, in the TAM, the presence of archaeocyath-bearing clasts in Cambrian conglomerates (e.g., Starshot Formation, Douglas Conglomerate) was useful to establish maximum depositional ages, lithostratigraphic relationships and relative timing of deformation, uplift and erosion of the Cambrian Series 2 carbonate platform (Rowell et al. Reference Rowell, Rees, Cooper and Pratt1986, Reference Rowell, Rees, Cooper and Pratt1988; Myrow et al. Reference Myrow, Pope, Goodge, Fischer and Palmer2002a). In recent tills, the presence of archaeocyath-bearing clasts derived from Cambrian polymictic conglomerates would indicate that the Douglas Conglomerate could be hidden under the ice at least as far S as the Beardmore Glacier (Rowell & Rees Reference Rowell and Rees1989).\n\nIn the EW (EWB in Fig. 1), the Heritage Group contains thick carbonate successions such as the middle Cambrian Drake Icefall Formation and the middle-upper Cambrian Minaret Formation (Webers et al. Reference Webers, Craddock and Splettstoesser1992). However, the only record of lower Cambrian carbonate sedimentation occurs as reworked carbonate clasts in the lower Cambrian conglomerates of the Kosco Peak Member (Castillo et al. Reference Castillo, Fanning, Fernández, Poblete and Hervé2017) from the Heritage Group and in Permo-Carboniferous tillites of the Whiteout Conglomerate (Buggisch & Webers Reference Buggisch and Webers1992). In fact, the Whiteout Conglomerate represents the Late Palaeozoic Gondwana glaciation sedimentation in W Antarctica (Matsch & Ojakangas Reference Matsch, Ojakangas, Webers, Craddock and Splettstoesser1992). But the source area of the carbonate clasts is unknown in the EW; specifically, the archaeocyath-bearing clasts give a lower Cambrian age (Debrenne Reference Debrenne1992) and no clasts believed to be from the Minaret Formation are found (Buggisch & Webers Reference Buggisch and Webers1992).\n\nIn Late Palaeozoic Gondwana glaciation deposits outside Antarctica, the presence of archaeocyath-bearing clasts (Fig. 1) allows paleobiogeographic correlations between Antarctica and other erratic assemblages in S Gondwana where the record of Cambrian carbonate successions is unknown, as in the Falkland Islands (Stone et al. Reference Stone, Thomson and Rushton2012), South Africa (Debrenne Reference Debrenne1975), Namibia (Perejón et al. Reference Perejón, Rodríguez-Martínez, Moreno-Eiris, Menéndez and Reitner2019) and Argentina (González et al. Reference González, Tortello, Damborenea, Naipauer, Sato and Varela2013). In this regard, the autochthonous archaeocyathan assemblages from the lower Cambrian Shackleton Limestone (TAM; Hill Reference Hill1964b; Debrenne & Kruse Reference Debrenne and Kruse1986, Reference Debrenne and Kruse1989), the Schneider Hills limestone (Pensacola Mountains (PM), TAM; Konyushkov & Shulyatin Reference Konyushkov, Shulyatin and Zhuravleva1980; Debrenne & Kruse Reference Debrenne and Kruse1989), the middle Cambrian Nelson Limestone (PM; Wood et al. Reference Wood, Evans and Zhuravlev1992) or the upper Cambrian Minaret Formation (EWB; Debrenne et al. Reference Debrenne, Rozanov and Webers1984; Henderson et al. Reference Henderson, Debrenne, Rowell, Webers, Webers, Craddock and Splettstoesser1992) are, so far, essential to establish the likely source areas of allochthonous records. But, are these the only Cambrian carbonate successions, or are there other records hidden under the ice? And, if so, how can we infer and differentiate them?\n\nThe Shackleton Range (SR in Fig. 1) is interpreted as a collisional orogen due to the final amalgamation between E and W Gondwana during Late Precambrian–Cambrian times (Tessensohn et al. Reference Tessensohn, Kleinschmidt, Talarico, Buggisch, Brommer, Henjes-Kunst, Kroner, Millar and Zeh1999a), but the presence of shallow-water marine successions from the Cambrian is unknown in this sector. However, glacial erratics with Cambrian brachiopods from a locally sourced area were the first fossils collected by the Shackleton Range geological expedition in recent moraine deposits (1970–1971; Clarkson Reference Clarkson1971; Thomson Reference Thomson1972). And later, during the German geological expedition GEISHA (1987–1988), Cenozoic glacial erratic archaeocyath-bearing clasts were discovered. Höfle & Buggisch (Reference Höfle and Buggisch1995) suggested that a major expansion of the Antarctic Ice Sheet carried these erratic carbonate clasts from their hypothetical source area: the Nelson Limestone in the PM, the southernmost part of the TAM (PM in Fig. 1). Some years later, during the EUROSHACK expedition (1993–1994), a sampling of new archaeocyath-bearing clasts from the Mount Wegener Formation was carried out. Buggisch & Henjes-Kunst (Reference Buggisch and Henjes-Kunst1999) suggested an early Cambrian Atdabanian age for the synorogenic upper slope to basinal deposits of the Mount Wegener Formation on the basis of the potassium–argon (K–Ar) ages of detrital muscovites and the presence of the trace fossil Oldhamia, calcimicrobes and archaeocyaths. Therefore, the carbonate clasts from the Mount Wegener Formation come from the erosion of shallow marine deposits; although geochemical and paleocurrent data suggest a northern source area, its final provenance is not yet determined (Buggisch & Henjes-Kunst Reference Buggisch and Henjes-Kunst1999).\n\nThe aims of this paper are: (a) to analyse the microfacies of the Cambrian carbonate clasts from the Shackleton Range (Cenozoic tills and Cambrian Mount Wegener Formation); (b) to identify the diagenetic processes that carbonate clasts and host rock conglomerates have undergone, from the shallow marine platform stage up to the very low-grade metamorphic overprint and nappe-tectonic stage; (c) to analyse the taxonomic relationships of the archaeocyath specimens; (d) to determine the age of archaeocyathan assemblage to set the minimum age of the carbonate platform they derived from; (e) to establish possible palaeobiogeographic correlations between the archaeocyathan assemblage from the Shackleton Range sector and other coeval assemblages; (f) to give new age constraints of the Mount Wegener Formation; (g) to figure out the different depositional sub-environments of the lost carbonate platform in the Shackleton Range sector; and (f) to compare this lost carbonate platform and its tectonosedimentary evolution with other contemporary Antarctic platforms."
