        "text": "Hemocyanins are oxygen-transporting glycoproteins in the hemolymph of arthropods and mollusks that attract scientific interest with their diverse biological activities and potential applications in pharmacy and medicine. The aim of the present study was to assess the in vitro antitumor activity of hemocyanins isolated from marine snail Rapana venosa (RvH) and garden snails Helix lucorum (HlH) and Helix aspersa (HaH), as well the mucus of H. aspersa snails, in the HT-29 human colorectal carcinoma cell line. The effects of the hemocyanins on the cell viability and proliferation were analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and the alterations in the tumor cell morphology were examined by fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy. The results of the MTT assay showed that the mucus and α-subunit of hemocyanin from the snail H. aspersa had the most significant antiproliferative activity of the tested samples. Cytomorphological analysis r...\n\nCancer remains a significant global health concern, necessitating the search for new effective and safe anti-cancer agents. Natural products derived from plants and animals, including mollusks like snails, have gained attention as potential sources of novel anti-cancer compounds. Haemocyanins (Hcs), large copper-containing glycoproteins involved in oxygen transport in mollusks, have shown promise as anti-cancer agents. This study focuses on evaluating the in vitro anti-tumour efficacy of bioactive substances obtained from the hemolymph of the garden snail Helix aspersa on various human cancer cell lines representing different types of cancer. The results demonstrate that certain hemocyanin subunits from H. aspersa exhibit cytotoxic activity comparable to cisplatin, a widely used chemotherapy drug. Additional assays confirm the cytotoxic effects of the tested substances on cancer cells. The study underscores the potential of natural compounds from H. aspersa as alternative therapeuti...\n\n1. The stability towards pH changes, thermal and chemical (guanidine hydrochloride) denaturation of the oxy- and apo-forms of the native Rapana thomasiana haemocyanin and its structural subunits, RHSS1 and RHSS2, has been investigated using fluorescence and CD spectroscopy. The association of the subunits into haemocyanin aggregates increases considerably the melting temperature and the free energy of stabilization in water. The guanidine hydrochloride denaturation of the aggregated oxygen-transporting protein depends slightly on the protein concentration. The denaturation of the individual subunits is concentration-independent. Rapana haemocyanin is 5.9-7.5 kJ/mol more stable than the constituent polypeptide chains. 2. Upon excitation of the native haemocyanin and the subunits at 295 or 280 nm the fluorescence emission is determined by tryptophyl residues &#39;buried&#39; deeply in the hydrophobic interior of the protein globules. This is confirmed by quenching experiments with acr...\n\nHemocyanin (HCY) is a multifunctional glycoprotein, which plays multiple roles in immune defense in invertebrates. HCY from some mollusks can induce potent immune response, while little is currently known about how hemocyanin from arthropods affects tumors. In the present study, in vitro cytotoxic effect of HCY from two crab species Atergatis roseus and Eriphia verrucosa was investigated on two cell lines included hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2) and breast cancer (MCF-7). The results showed that HCY exhibited degrees of inhibitory activity against the two cell lines. HCY of A.roseus showed the highest cytotoxicity against HepG-2 cell line(IC50 :7.7 ± 3.1 mg/ml) while the HCY of E.verucossa showed inhibitory effect (IC50 : 9.5 ± 2.6 mg/ml) after 72 h. HCY of A.roseus and E.verucossa showed their maximum cytotoxity IC50 towards MCF-7 at 2.71± 1.3 mg/ml and 4.72± 1.5 mg/ml, respectively. In Conclusion, We concluded that HCY obtained from A. roseus has strong anti-tumor activity against HepG-2 and MCF-7 than HCY obtained from E. verrucosa."
