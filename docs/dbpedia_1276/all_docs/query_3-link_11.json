Several TB vaccine candidates are currently in clinical and preclinical development.

The latter are designed as vaccines that will be administered to individuals already vaccinated with BCG (or in the future with a BCG replacement vaccine). In this review we provide up to date information on novel tuberculosis (TB) vaccines in development focusing on the risk assessment of candidates composed of genetically modified organisms (GMO) which are currently evaluated in clinical trials. Indeed, these vaccines administered to volunteers raise biosafety concerns with respect to human health and the environment that need to be assessed and managed.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nTuberculosis (TB) is a contagious infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and other mycobacteria belonging to the Mtb complex (M. africanum, M. bovis, M. canettii). TB is spread by aerosols of species of the Mtb complex, which are shed through cough from open cavitary pulmonary TB patients before onset of multi-drug therapy. It is a major source of morbidity and mortality which has afflicted mankind since its origin [1]. Mtb is a pathogenic micro-organism belonging to the risk group (RG) 3 namely a biological agent that can cause severe human disease and may present a risk of spreading to the community [2]. An effective prophylaxis or treatment for infectious diseases caused by agents of RG 3 is usually available. An effective treatment exists against TB except for patients with extremely multi-drug resistant strains (XDR-TB) which are defined as strains resistant to most of the available antibiotics. The airborne route of transmission of Mtb and its low infectious dose in humans (ID50 1–10 bacilli) greatly contributes to the final classification of this pathogen into RG 3 [3].\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) reported that in 2012, 8.6 million new cases of TB were notified and that 1.3 million people died from TB [4]. Among the 8.6 million cases of incident TB, 13% were in HIV co-infected individuals, 450,000 were caused by a multi-drug resistant strain (MDR-TB) defined as resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin, 2.9 million were women and 0.53 million were children. Among the 1.3 million people that died of TB, 320,000 individuals were HIV-positive, 170,000 died of MDR-TB, 410,000 were women and 74,000 were HIV-negative children.\n\nAccording to the WHO, the TB mortality rate has fallen globally by 45% since 1990 and number of deaths is falling in most parts of the world. This can be attributed to a better access to treatment around the world (via the implementation of treatment programs such as the one of directly observed treatment short-course or DOTS) as well as to the recent development of more rapid diagnostic methods (for example the GeneExpert). Nevertheless, in order to achieve an effective control of TB, novel antibiotics, new treatment schemes and effective vaccines able to prevent the development of the contagious pulmonary form of TB are needed.\n\nUntil now, there is no effective vaccine to prevent TB in adults [4]. Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a live-attenuated vaccine derived from M. bovis isolated in 1921 that is still the only licensed vaccine available against TB. Vaccination with BCG was progressively implemented worldwide since the middle of the 20th century and currently, in TB endemic countries, BCG is part of the vaccines administered in the context of the WHO Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI). In non-endemic countries, BCG is recommended only to individuals at increased risk of exposure to Mtb. BCG vaccination protects children against TB meningitis and against disseminated disease, but has been found to be of variable efficacy against pulmonary TB (ranging from 0% to 80%) in a number of clinical trials [5,6,7]. Therefore, BCG has a minor impact on transmission of Mtb infection.\n\nA major problem in the quest for more efficient TB vaccines is the poor understanding of the immunity that is needed for effective protection. Nevertheless, it is well established that a key role in protection against this intracellular pathogen is played by the cellular arm of the adaptive immune system, particularly by CD4+ Th1 (type T helper) cells producing IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 [8]. This is underscored by the clinical association between HIV and TB, by the genetic susceptibility to TB and opportunistic mycobacterial disease of individuals bearing mutations in the IL-12/IL-23–IFN-γ pathway and by the increased risk to develop reactivation TB of individuals treated with anti-TNF-α agents used for a range of inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease [9,10,11]. MHC class I restricted CD8+ T cells play also a role in the immune response against Mtb through production of cytokines and their lytic activity targeting infected cells. This has been demonstrated by a number of studies in pre-clinical models and with samples isolated from humans [8,12]. The importance of CD8+ T cells in the control of latent TB infection and immune protection against reactivation TB in humans was convincingly demonstrated by Bruns et al [13]. who have reported that anti-TNF-α immunotherapy with infliximab reduced CD8+ T cell-mediated antimicrobial activity against Mtb in humans through the interaction of the antibody with cell surface expressed TNF-α on CD8+ T cells and their subsequent complement-mediated lysis [13]. Hence, when developing novel TB vaccines, the type of immunity that is mainly sought is cellular adaptive immunity with CD4+ Th1 cells and CD8+ T cells.\n\nIn this review, TB vaccine candidates that are currently evaluated in clinical trials are presented. A particular emphasis is given to the risk assessment of vaccines composed of genetically modified organisms (GMO) such as recombinant BCG and Mtb strains or viral-vectored sub-unit vaccines. Indeed, vaccines based on GMO that are administered to volunteers raise biosafety concerns with respect to human health and the environment that need to be assessed and managed [14,15].\n\n2. Risk Assessment of Activities Involving GMO-Based Vaccines against TB\n\n2.1. General Regulatory Considerations in Europe\n\nDepending on the purpose and the type of activity in the European Union (EU), the use of genetically modified and/or pathogenic (micro-)organisms may fall within the scope of several regulatory provisions (Table 1). As the manipulation of pathogenic micro-organisms may pose a risk related to the exposure of the worker to biological agents, this type of activity is covered by the European Directive 2000/54/EC [2]. Activities involving manipulations of Genetically Modified Micro-organisms (GMM) in a facility may increase the probability of exposure of the population and the environment to these organisms. In this case, a risk assessment should be made in accordance with the provisions of the Directive 2009/41/EC related to the contained use of GMMs [15]. In addition if these activities involve the deliberate release of GMOs (including GMMs) into the environment they should undergo an environmental risk assessment (ERA) according the principles defined in annex II of the European Directive 2001/18/EC [14]. Moreover, activities aiming at commercializing of GMO biopharmaceuticals are covered by the Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 laying down procedures for the authorization and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use [16].\n\n4. Biosafety Considerations of Clinical Studies with GMO-Based Vaccines\n\nHuman use of a GMO as vaccine requires rigorous tests to control their attenuation and the absence of reversion to virulence, their persistence and biodistribution in the vaccinated subject, their ability to survive outside the host in the environment and their genetic stability [54,55]. Issues raised by use of antibiotic resistance markers need to be addressed and evidence for lack of shedding of live micro-organisms by vaccinated persons should also be assessed. Concerning recombinant live mycobacteria, the possibility of exchange of genetic material with naturally occurring environmental mycobacteria needs to be studied and requires an assessment of the consequences of such genetic exchange.\n\n4.1. BCG Replacement with Genetically Modified Mycobacteria\n\nOne of the basic strategies to develop this first category of TB vaccines is to improve BCG by genetically modifying it. The resulting genetically modified (GM) BCG strain will express or over-express Mtb protective antigens or will be able to better induce protective immune responses as compared to the original BCG vaccine strain. The second strategy followed to replace classic BCG vaccination is rational attenuation of Mtb in order to develop a live attenuated TB vaccine that resembles more the pathogenic mycobacteria in terms of antigenic repertoire and in terms of the induced immune responses.\n\n5. Conclusions and Perspectives\n\nSuccess of TB vaccines currently evaluated in clinical trials is unpredictable and in this respect, 2013 has been disappointing. Evidence for efficacy of most of the vaccine candidates is poor compared to BCG vaccine, including in animal models of pre-clinical studies. In March 2013 the results of the MVA-85A-AERAS-485 phase IIb clinical trial (NCT00953927) were published [46]. In this trial, which was conducted in South Africa, healthy infants (aged 4–6 months) that were previously vaccinated with BCG received one intradermal dose of MVA-85A or an equal volume of Candida skin test antigen as placebo. Though the primary objective of this trial was safety, also efficacy evaluation against TB disease (diagnosed by microbiological, radiological and clinical criteria) or Mtb infection (defined by QuantiFERON TB Gold In-tube conversion) was performed in a defined group of participants. Safety results were satisfactory, while no improved efficacy was observed in the group of infants that were BCG-primed and MVA-85A-boosted vs. BCG-primed and placebo-boosted infants.\n\nIn retrospect, a number of factors can explain lack of improved efficacy of this vaccination scheme [123]. In our opinion, the main point is related to the population that was evaluated in this study, namely infants that had been BCG vaccinated early after birth. Indeed, in this population, BCG is performing well in terms of protective efficacy against childhood forms of TB. In addition, MVA-85A proved modestly immunogenic when levels of vaccine-induced cellular immunity were compared to the levels achieved when BCG-vaccinated adults are vaccinated with MVA-85A as a booster vaccine. Hence, the efficacy results obtained in this trial do not exclude the possibility that a boost with MVA-85A administered to adults that have been vaccinated with BCG during infancy or that are latently infected with Mtb might prove efficient in terms of reduction of TB morbidity in ongoing and future clinical trials. Concerning the modest immunogenicity observed in infants boosted with MVA-85A, it is worth mentioning that a number of clinical trials are ongoing to improve this aspect. In these trials, MVA-85A has been either modified by fusing Ag85A to the oligomerization domain IMX313 (NCT01879163) or vaccination protocols combining MVA-85A with other viral-vectored sub-unit vaccines are being tested. Such being the case in clinical trial NCT01683773 in which booster immunization with AERAS-402 (Crucell Ad35) is followed by a second booster vaccination with MVA-85A, or clinical trial NCT01829490 in which ChAdOx1 85A (based on a chimpazee adenoviral vector expressing Ag85A) is followed by a second booster vaccination with MVA-85A.\n\nIn addition, it is important to emphasize that NCT00953927 was the first phase IIb trial for a TB vaccine conducted in a high-burden setting and the solutions, which were implemented for this trial will be of value in the planning of efficacy trials of other TB vaccine candidates [45].\n\nNevertheless, as success of the TB vaccines currently evaluated in clinical trials is unpredictable, it is also essential to continue fundamental and pre-clinical research to better understand protective immunity to Mtb and to identify novel TB vaccine candidates that might prove more efficient than the candidates currently under clinical evaluation.\n\nPromising novel “BCG replacement” candidates are either based on genetic modification of BCG or on genetic attenuation of virulent Mtb. Some examples of interesting recombinant BCG candidates are the genetically modified BCG ∆zmp1 [62] and BCG ∆sapM [61]. Both deletions involve genes that negatively regulate the process of phagosome maturation. Hence their deletion should favor antigen escape from the phagosomal compartment to increase cross-presentation of mycobacterial antigen over those achieved by parenteral BCG. Indeed, the zinc metalloprotease 1 (Zmp1) is required to arrest phagosome maturation and SapM is a secreted acid phosphatase, which plays a critical role during phagosome maturation.\n\nConcerning candidates based on attenuation of Mtb, strains lacking the SapM gene have been described as well as pantothenate auxotrophs strains [124,125]. In addition, two highly attenuated Mtb mutants, MGM1991 and Mtb∆hma::hyg (HMA) have recently been proposed as potential vaccine candidates against TB [126]. These strains lack all oxygenated mycolates in their cell wall, which are Mtb glycolipids that have been associated with Mtb pathogenesis in mice, in part through effects on the inflammatory activity of trehalose dimycolate (cord factor). As compared to vaccination with BCG, the subcutaneous vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with either of the two mutants induced stronger Th1 (IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α) and IL-17 responses. In addition, compared with BCG vaccination, significantly higher number of mycobacteria-specific IFN-γ producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected and stronger protection against Mtb challenge was observed in mice vaccinated with the Mtb mutants. For the Mtb-based vaccine candidates the risk assessment procedure will need to thoroughly assess any virulence and possible virulence reversion, as it has been described for MTBVAC vaccine candidate.\n\nBesides safety and efficacy of the novel vaccine candidates against TB, biosafety should also be considered when this vaccine is composed of a GMO. Biosafety focuses on the protection of public health and the environment from an intended or unintended exposure to the GMO-based vaccine by implementing adapted containment measures during handling of the GMO. The risk assessment of future clinical trials with new GMO-based vaccine candidates will follow the same procedure of risk analysis as that followed for current clinical trials using GMO-based vaccines: what are the intrinsic characteristics of the parental micro-organism (or recipient organism), what is the function of the transgene or the mutated gene in the GMO and what are the characteristics of the final GMO? In case of an accidental release into the environment, what could be the consequences of an exposure of the environment, the human being or of animals to this GMO? Identification of potential risks of handling the GMO vaccine and the probability of their occurrence should define the risk management of the clinical trial. It has to be noted that at each step of the development of a GMO vaccine the risk assessment should take into account any new data generated by the previous steps.\n\nConcerning the risk assessment procedure for new BCG- and Mtb-based candidates, it is important to note that these recombinant vaccines have been designed by targeted inactivation of endogenous genes and not by expression of heterologous virulence genes (as it has been the case for VPM1002 or for AERAS-422). Hence, the risk assessment procedure will need to take into account the genetic stability of the vaccine candidates. Particular attention is required with live vaccines based on attenuated pathogens on their capacity of virulence reversion as well as on their capacity to multiply and propagate in the vaccinated host and in the environment.\n\nThe successful use of viral vector vaccines against TB has not been demonstrated so far. However research is still ongoing and this review has discussed the biosafety issues which need to be considered carefully when performing clinical trials with recombinant Adenovirus or MVA. Although a case-by-case risk assessment should be performed on each clinical trial involving GMO-based vaccines, the same general methodology can be applied.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank Didier Breyer and Katia Pauwels (Scientific Institute of Public Health, WIV-ISP, Brussels, Belgium) for their useful contribution to this document.
