Five of the strains clustered with, but were distinct from, Sphingomonas capsulata, whereas the sixth strain was most closely related to Blastobacter natatorius. The five strains that clustered with S. capsulata, all of which could degrade aromatic compounds, were gram-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile, rod-shaped organisms that produced small, yellow colonies on complex media. Their G + C contents ranged from 60.0 to 65.4 mol%, and the predominant isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone Q-10. All of the strains were aerobic and catalase positive. Indole, urease, and arginine dihydrolase were not produced. Gelatin was not liquified, and glucose was not fermented. Sphingolipids were present in all strains; 2OH14:0 was the major hydroxy fatty acid, and 18:1 was a major constituent of cellular lipids. Acid was produced oxidatively from pentoses, hexoses, and disaccharides, but not from polyalcohols and indole. All of these characteristics indicate that the five aromatic-degrading strains should be placed in the genus Sphingomonas as currently defined. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, DNA-DNA reassociation values, BOX-PCR genomic fingerprinting, differences in cellular lipid composition, and differences in physiological traits all indicated that the five strains represent three previously undescribed Sphingomonas species. Therefore, we propose the following new species: Sphingomonas aromaticivorans (type strain, SMCC F199), Sphingomonas subterranea (type strain, SMCC B0478), and Sphingomonas stygia (type strain, SMCC B0712).\n\nSphingomonas from petroleum-contaminated soils in Shenfu, China and their PAHs degradation abilities\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLisha Zhou\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract Members of the Sphingomonas genus are often isolated from petroleum-contaminated soils due to their unique abilities to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, which are important for in situ bioremediation. In this study, a combined phenotypic and genotypic approach using streptomycin-containing medium and Sphingomonas -specific PCR was developed to isolate and identify culturable Sphingomonas strains present in petroleum-contaminated soils in the Shenfu wastewater irrigation zone. Of the 15 soil samples examined, 12 soils yielded yellow streptomycin-resistant colonies. The largest number of yellow colony-forming units (CFUs could reach 105 CFUs g-1 soil. The number of yellow CFUs had a significant positive correlation (p < 0.05 with the ratio of PAHs to total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH, indicating that Sphingomonas may play a key role in degrading the PAH fraction of the petroleum contaminants at this site. Sixty yellow colonies were selected randomly and analyzed by colony PCR using Sphingomonas -specific primers, out of which 48 isolates had PCR-positive signals. The 48 positive amplicons generated 8 distinct restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP patterns, and 7 out of 8 phylotypes were identified as Sphingomonas by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the representative strains. Within these 7 Sphingomonas strains, 6 strains were capable of using fluorene as the sole carbon source, while 2 strains were phenanthrene-degrading Sphingomonas. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to evaluate the relationship between PAHs contamination levels and culturable Sphingomonas in environmental samples.\n\nThe astaxanthin dideoxyglycoside biosynthesis pathway in Sphingomonas sp.

Growth occurred at 10-37âÂ°C (optimum 25-30âÂ°C), at pH 5.0-9.0 (optimum 7.0) and in the presence of 0-2.0â%âNaCl (optimum without NaCl supplement). Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the nearest phylogenetic neighbours of strain THG-T61 T were identified as Sphingomonas ginsengisoli KCTC 12630 T (97.9â%), Sphingomonas jaspsi DSM 18422 T (97.8â%), Sphingomonas astaxanthinifaciens NBRC 102146 T (97.4â%), Sphingomonassediminicola KCTC 12629 T (97.2â%), 'Sphingomonas swuensis' KCTC 12336 (97.1â%) and Sphingomonas daechungensis KCTC 23718 T (96.9â%). The isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone-10 (Q-10). The major fatty acids were C16â:â0, C17â:â1Ï6c, summed feature 4 (iso-C15â:â0 2-OH and/or C16â:â1Ï7c) and summed feature 7 (C18â:â1Ï7c, C18â:â1Ï9t and/or C18â:â1Ï12t). The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, sphingoglycolipid, one unidentified lipid, one unidentified phospholipid, one unidentified glycolipid and one unidentified phosphoglycolipid. The polyamine was homospermidine. The DNA G+Câcontent of strain THG-T61 T was 65.6âmol%. The DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain THG-T61 T and its closest reference strains were less than 49.2â%, which is lower than the threshold value of 70â%. Therefore, strain THG-T61 T represents a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas rhizophila sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is THG-T61 T (=KACC 19189 T =CCTCC AB 2016245 T ).\n\nCharacterization of Sphingomonas isolates from Finnish and Swedish drinking water distribution systems.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKoskinen, R; Ali-Vehmas, T; KÃ¤mpfer, P; Laurikkala, M; Tsitko, I; Kostyal, E; Atroshi, F; Salkinoja-Salonen, M\n\n2000-10-01\n\nSphingomonas species were commonly isolated from biofilms in drinking water distribution systems in Finland (three water meters) and Sweden (five water taps in different buildings). The Sphingomonas isolates (n = 38) were characterized by chemotaxonomic, physiological and phylogenetic methods. Fifteen isolates were designated to species Sphingomonas aromaticivorans, seven isolates to S. subterranea, two isolates to S. xenophaga and one isolate to S. stygia. Thirteen isolates represented one or more new species of Sphingomonas. Thirty-three isolates out of 38 grew at 5 degrees C on trypticase soy broth agar (TSBA) and may therefore proliferate in the Nordic drinking water pipeline where the temperature typically ranges from 2 to 12 degrees C. Thirty-three isolates out of 38 grew at 37 degrees C on TSBA and 15 isolates also grew on blood agar at 37 degrees C. Considering the potentially pathogenic features of sphingomonas, their presence in drinking water distribution systems may not be desirable.\n\nEcology, physiology, and phylogeny of deep subsurface Sphingomonas sp.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFredrickson, J K; Balkwill, D L; Romine, M F; Shi, T\n\n1999-10-01\n\nSeveral new species of the genus Sphingomonas including S. aromaticivorans, S. stygia, and S. subterranea that have the capacity for degrading a broad range of aromatic compounds including toluene, naphthalene, xylenes, p-cresol, fluorene, biphenyl, and dibenzothiophene, were isolated from deeply-buried (>200 m) sediments of the US Atlantic coastal plain (ACP). In S. aromaticivorans F199, many of the genes involved in the catabolism of these aromatic compounds are encoded on a 184-kb conjugative plasmid; some of the genes involved in aromatic catabolism are plasmid-encoded in the other strains as well. Members of the genus Sphingomonas were common among aerobic heterotrophic bacteria cultured from ACP sediments and have been detected in deep subsurface environments elsewhere. The major source of organic carbon for heterotrophic metabolism in ACP deep aquifers is lignite that originated from plant material buried with the sediments. We speculate that the ability of the subsurface Sphingomonas strains to degrade a wide array of aromatic compounds represents an adaptation for utilization of sedimentary lignite. These and related subsurface Sphingomonas spp may play an important role in the transformation of sedimentary organic carbon in the aerobic and microaerobic regions of the deep aquifers of the ACP.\n\nFirst Report of Sphingomonas koreensis as a human pathogen in a patient with meningitis\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nMarbjerg, Lis H; Gaini, Shahin; Justesen, Ulrik S\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSphingomonas koreensis is an aerobic Gram-negative rod originally described in 2001 following isolation from natural mineral water in Korea.

Strain 200 T grew optimally at pH 7.0 and in the absence of NaCl on R2A. Its optimum growth temperature was 20âÂ°C. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain 200 T belonged to the genus Sphingomonas. Strain 200 T showed the highest sequence similarities to Sphingomonas kyeonggiense THG-DT81 T (95.1â%) and Sphingomonas molluscorum KMM 3882 T (95.1â%). Chemotaxonomic analysis showed that strain 200 T had characteristics typical of members of the genus Sphingomonas. Ubiquinone 10 was the predominant respiratory quinone and sym-homospermidine was the polyamine. The major polar lipids were sphingoglycolipid, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine. The G+Câcontent of the genomic DNA was determined to be 60.9âmol%. Strain 200 T contained C16â:â0 (31.6â%), summed feature 8 (comprising C18â:â1Ï7c and/or C18â:â1Ï6c, 22.7â%), summed feature 3 (comprising C16â:â1Ï7c and/or C16â:â1Ï6c, 11.2â%), C18â:â0 (7.8â%) and C14â:â0 2OH (6.7â%) as the major cellular fatty acids. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, and physiological and biochemical characterization, strain 200 T should be classiï¬ed as representing a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonasantarctica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 200 T (=CCTCCâAB 2016064 T =KCTC 52488 T ).\n\nProposal of the genus Sphingomonas sensu stricto and three new genera, Sphingobium, Novosphingobium and Sphingopyxis, on the basis of phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic analyses.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTakeuchi, M; Hamana, K; Hiraishi, A\n\n2001-07-01\n\nPhylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences by distance matrix and parsimony methods indicated that the currently known species of the genus Sphingomonas can be divided into four clusters. Some chemotaxonomic and phenotypic differences were noted among these clusters. Three new genera, Sphingobium, Novosphingobium and Sphingopyxis, are proposed in addition to the genus Sphingomonas sensu stricto. The genus Sphingobium is proposed to accommodate Sphingomonas chlorophenolica, Sphingomonas herbicidovorans and Sphingomonas yanoikuyae. The genus Novosphingobium is proposed for Sphingomonas aromaticivorans, Sphingomonas capsulata, Sphingomonas rosa, Sphingomonas stygia, Sphingomonas subarctica and Sphingomonas subterranea. Sphingomonas macrogoltabidus and Sphingomonas terrae are reclassified in the genus Sphingopyxis. The type species of Sphingobium, Novosphingobium and Sphingopyxis are Sphingobium yanoikuyae, Novosphingobium capsulatum and Sphingopyxis macrogoltabida, respectively.\n\nStructural analysis of biofilm formation by rapidly and slowly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) such as M. abscessus, M. mucogenicum, M. chelonae and M. fortuitum, implicated in healthcare-associated infections, are often isolated from potable water supplies as part of the microbial flora.

The cells were strictly aerobic, non-spore-forming and rod-shaped. The strain grew at 15-37âÂ°C (optimum, 25âÂ°C), at pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum, 7.0) and in the presence of 0-1â% (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetically, the strain was closely related to members of the genus Sphingomonas(97.04-91.22â% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities) and showed the highest sequence similarity of 97.04â% to Sphingomonas kyeonggiensis THG-DT81 T . It contained C16â:â0, summed feature 8 (C18â:â1Ï7c and/or C18â:â1Ï6c) and C14â:â0 2-OH as the predominant fatty acids and Q-10 as the major ubiquinone. The predominant polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine and sphingoglycolipid. The major polyamine was sym-homospermidine. The serine palmitoyl transferase gene (spt) was detected and sphingolipid synthesis was confirmed. The mean DNA G+C content of the strain was 67.8Â±0.5âmol%. DNA-DNA relatedness between strain PR0302 T and closely related type strains of Sphingomonas species was less than 30â%. The low levels of DNA-DNA relatedness identified strain PR0302 T as a member of a novel species in the genus Sphingomonas. Based on phenotypic, genotypic and chemotaxonomic data, strain PR0302 T represents a novel species in the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas carri sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is PR0302 T (=KACC 18487 T =NBRC 111532 T ).\n\nSphingomonas jatrophae sp. nov. and Sphingomonas carotinifaciens sp. nov., two yellow-pigmented endophytes isolated from stem tissues of Jatropha curcas L.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMadhaiyan, Munusamy; Alex, Tan Hian Hwee; Cho, Hayoung; Kim, Soo-Jin; Weon, Hang-Yeon; Kwon, Soon-Wo; Whitman, William B; Ji, Lianghui\n\n2017-12-01\n\nTwo yellow-pigmented isolates, S5-249 T and L9-754 T , originating from surface-sterilized plant tissues of Jatropha curcas L. (Jatropha) cultivars were characterized using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Strains S5-249 T and L9-754 T had 16S rRNA genes sharing 94.2â% sequence similarity with each other and 91.6-97.2â% sequence similarity with those of other species in the genus Sphingomonas, suggesting that they represent two potentially novel species. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains S5-249 T and L9-754 T shared the highest similarity to that of Sphingomonas sanguinis NBRC 13937 T (96.1 and 97.2â%, respectively). The genomic DNA G+Câcontents of strains S5-249 T and L9-754 T were 66.9 and 68.5âmol%, respectively. The respiratory quinone was determined to be Q-10, and the major polyamine was homospermidine. Strains S5-249 T and L9-754 T contained summed feature 7 (comprising C18â:â1Ï7c, C18â:â1Ï9t and/or C18â:â1Ï12t), C16â:â1, C14â:â0 2-OH and summed feature 4 (C16â:â1Ï7t, iso-C15â:â0 2-OH and C16â:â1Ï7c) as the major cellular fatty acids. The predominant polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and sphingoglycolipid. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values between S. sanguinis NBRC 13937 T and the two type strains (S5-249 T and L9-754 T ) were 72.31 and 77.73â%, respectively. Digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) studies between the novel strains (S5-249 T and L9-754 T ) and other species of the genus Sphingomonas were well below the thresholds used to discriminate between bacterial species. The results of dDDH and physiological tests allowed genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of the strains from each other as well as from the species of the genus Sphingomonas with validly published names. These data strongly support the classification of the strains as representatives of novel species, for which we propose the names Sphingomonas jatrophae sp. nov\n\nEndoftalmitis poscirugÃ­a de catarata por Sphingomonas paucimobilis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nOmar Mauri Garrido\n\nFull Text Available Se presenta la caracterizaciÃ³n y manejo terapÃ©utico de un caso de endoftalmitis bacteriana posoperatoria causada por el germen Sphingomonas paucimobilis.

Here in, is the first case report of Acute Sphingomonas phlebitis secondary to intravenous (IV drug use. We present the case of a 39-year-old male who initially presented with pain in his right upper extremity, fevers and chills of three week duration. He admitted to regularly injecting heroin in his distal right upper extremity with visible erythema, tenderness and streaking along the path of vein along the injection site. Radiographic studies including X-ray of the right arm, ultrasound and a subsequent MRI of the right arm were not significant for any osteomyelitis, deep venous thrombus, abscess, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, or pyomyositis. Blood culture grew Sphingomonas paucimobilis. Patient was initially started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam and subsequently switched to levofloxacin to complete a 14Â day course. Patient admitted to using toilet water to mix his heroin which we suspect may have been the source of his bacteremia. Since it was first reported in 1979, a wide variety of community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections have been attributed to this Sphingomonas. It is ubiquitous to natural environment. We believe that due to its widespread habitat and ability to survive in stress conditions it could be a potential future threat in the era of increasing antimicrobial resistance globally. More research needs to be done on early identification, pathogenesis, treatment and eradication of the organism.\n\nChanges to the structure of Sphingomonas spp. communities associated with biodegradation of the herbicide isoproturon in soil.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShi, Shengjing; Bending, Gary D\n\n2007-04-01\n\nThe phenyl-urea herbicide isoproturon is a major contaminant of surface and ground-water in agricultural catchments. Earlier work suggested that within-field spatial variation of isoproturon degradation rate resulted from interactions between catabolizing Sphingomonas spp. and pH. In the current study, changes to the structure of Sphingomonas communities during isoproturon catabolism were investigated using Sphingomonas-specific 16S rRNA gene primers. Growth-linked catabolism at high-pH (>7.5) sites was associated with the appearance of multiple new denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) bands. At low-pH sites, there was no change in DGGE banding at sites in which there was cometabolism, but at sites in which there was growth-linked catabolism, degradation was associated with the appearance of a new band not present at high pH sites. Sequencing of DGGE bands indicated that a strain related to Sphingomonas mali proliferated at low pH sites, while strain Sphingomonas sp. SRS2, a catabolic strain identified in earlier work, together with several further Sphingomonas spp., proliferated at high-pH sites. The data indicate that degradation was associated with complex changes to the structure of Sphingomonas spp. communities, the precise nature of which was spatially variable.\n\nClassification of Rhizomonas suberifaciens, an unnamed Rhizomonas species, and Sphingomonas spp. in rRNA superfamily IV.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nvan Bruggen, A H; Jochimsen, K N; Steinberger, E M; Segers, P; Gillis, M\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThermal melting profiles of hybrids between 3H-labeled rRNA of Rhizomonas suberifaciens, the causal agent of corky root of lettuce, and chromosomal DNAs from 27 species of gram-negative bacteria indicated that the genus Rhizomonas belongs to superfamily IV of De Ley. On the basis of the melting temperatures of DNA hybrids with rRNAs from the type strains of R. suberifaciens, Sphingomonas paucimobilis, and Sphingomonas capsulata, Rhizomonas strains constitute a separate branch in superfamily IV, which is closely related to but separate from branches containing Zymomonas mobilis, Sphingomonas spp., and S. capsulata. Sphingomonas yanoikuyae and Rhizomonas sp. strain WI4 are located toward the base of the Rhizomonas rRNA branch. DNA-DNA hybridization indicated that S. yanoikuyae is equidistant from Rhizomonas sp. strain WI4 and S. paucimobilis. Sequences of 270 bp of 16S ribosomal DNAs from eight strains of Rhizomonas spp., eight strains of Sphingomonas spp., and Agrobacterium tumefaciens indicated that S. yanoikuyae and Rhizomonas sp. strains WI4 and CA16 are genetically more closely related to R. suberifaciens than to Sphingomonas spp. Thus, S. yanoikuyae may need to be transferred to the genus Rhizomonas on the basis of the results of further study.\n\nSphingomonas qilianensis sp. nov., Isolated from Surface Soil in the Permafrost Region of Qilian Mountains, China.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPiao, Ai-Lian; Feng, Xiao-Min; Nogi, Yuichi; Han, Lu; Li, Yonghong; Lv, Jie\n\n2016-04-01\n\nA Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, non-motile and rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated X1(T), was isolated from the permafrost region of Qilian Mountains in northwest of China. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain X1(T) was a member of the genus Sphingomonas and shared the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Sphingomonas oligophenolica JCM 12082(T) (96.9%), followed by Sphingomonas glacialis CGMCC 1.8957(T) (96.7%) and Sphingomonas alpina DSM 22537(T) (96.4%). Strain X1(T) was able to grow at 15-30 Â°C, pH 6.0-10.0 and with 0-0.3% NaCl (w/v). The DNA G+C content of the isolate was 64.8 mol%. Strain X1(T)-contained Q-10 as the dominant ubiquinone and C(18:1)Ï7c, C(16:1)Ï7c, C(16:0) and C(14:0) 2-OH as the dominant fatty acids. The polar lipid profile of strain XI(T)-contained sphingoglycolipid, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, one unidentified glycolipid and two unidentified phospholipid. Due to the phenotypic and genetic distinctiveness and other characteristic studied in this article, we consider X1(T) as a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas and propose to name it Sphingomonas qilianensis sp. nov. The type strain is X1(T) (=CGMCC 1.15349(T) = KCTC 42862(T)).\n\nSphingomonas frigidaeris sp. nov., isolated from an air conditioning system.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLee, Yunho; Jeon, Che Ok\n\n2017-10-01\n\nA strictly aerobic Gram-stain-negative bacterium, designated strain KER25-10 T , was isolated from a laboratory air conditioning system in South Korea. Cells were yellow-pigmented, non-motile rods showing catalase- and oxidase-positive reactions. The strain grew at pH 4.0-9.0 (optimum, pH 6.0-7.0) and 10-40âÂ°C (optimum, 30âÂ°C) and in the presence of 0-3â% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0â%). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 65.1âmol%. Strain KER25-10 T contained ubiquinone-10 (Q-10) as the predominant isoprenoid quinone and C16â:â0, C17â:â1Ï6c, summed feature 3 (comprising C16â:â1Ï7c and/or C16â:â1Ï6c) and summed feature 8 (comprising C18â:â1Ï7c and/or C18â:â1Ï6c) as the major fatty acids. The major polar lipids were sphingoglycolipid, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. Only spermidine was detected as the polyamine. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA sequences indicated that strain KER25-10 T formed a distinct phylogenetic lineage within the genus Sphingomonas of the family Sphingomonadaceae and the strain was most closely related to Sphingomonas kyeonggiense THG-DT81 T with a 96.8â% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular features, strain KER25-10 T clearly represents a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas frigidaeris sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KER25-10 T (=KACC 19285 T =JCM 32053 T ).\n\nIsolation and characterization of diesel degrading bacteria, Sphingomonas sp. and Acinetobacter junii from petroleum contaminated soil\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhang, Qiuzhuo; Wang, Duanchao; Li, Mengmeng; Xiang, Wei-Ning; Achal, Varenyam\n\n2014-03-01\n\nTwo indigenous bacteria of petroleum contaminated soil were characterized to utilize diesel fuel as the sole carbon and energy sources in this work. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis identified these bacteria as Sphingomonas sp. and Acinetobacter junii. The ability to degrade diesel fuel has been demonstrated for the first time by these isolates. The results of IR analyses showed that Sphingomonas sp. VA1 and A. junii VA2 degraded up to 82.6% and 75.8% of applied diesel over 15 days, respectively. In addition, Sphingomonas sp. VA1 possessed the higher cellular hydrophobicities of 94% for diesel compared to 81% by A. junii VA2. The isolates Sphingomonas sp. VA1 and A. junii VA2 exhibited 24% and 18%, respectively emulsification activity. This study reports two new diesel degrading bacterial species, which can be effectively used for bioremediation of petroleum contaminated sites.\n\nGrowth in coculture stimulates metabolism of the phenylurea herbicide isoproturon by Sphingomonas sp. strain SRS2.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSÃ¸rensen, Sebastian R; Ronen, Zeev; Aamand, Jens\n\n2002-07-01\n\nMetabolism of the phenylurea herbicide isoproturon by Sphingomonas sp. strain SRS2 was significantly enhanced when the strain was grown in coculture with a soil bacterium (designated strain SRS1). Both members of this consortium were isolated from a highly enriched isoproturon-degrading culture derived from an agricultural soil previously treated regularly with the herbicide. Based on analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, strain SRS1 was assigned to the beta-subdivision of the proteobacteria and probably represents a new genus. Strain SRS1 was unable to degrade either isoproturon or its known metabolites 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-1-methylurea, 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-urea, or 4-isopropyl-aniline. Pure culture studies indicate that Sphingomonas sp. SRS2 is auxotrophic and requires components supplied by association with other soil bacteria. A specific mixture of amino acids appeared to meet these requirements, and it was shown that methionine was essential for Sphingomonas sp. SRS2. This suggests that strain SRS1 supplies amino acids to Sphingomonas sp. SRS2, thereby leading to rapid metabolism of (14)C-labeled isoproturon to (14)CO(2) and corresponding growth of strain SRS2. Proliferation of strain SRS1 suggests that isoproturon metabolism by Sphingomonas sp. SRS2 provides unknown metabolites or cell debris that supports growth of strain SRS1. The role of strain SRS1 in the consortium was not ubiquitous among soil bacteria; however, the indigenous soil microflora and some strains from culture collections also stimulate isoproturon metabolism by Sphingomonas sp. strain SRS2 to a similar extent.\n\nSPHINGOMONAS PAUCIMOBILIS INFECTIONS IN CHILDREN: NOSOCOMIAL VERSUS COMMUNITY ACQUIRED INFECTIONS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNuri Bayram\n\n2013-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Sphingomonas paucimobilis is a causative agent of infection in immunocompromised patients, and healthcare-associated infections. Although the infections associated with S.paucimobilis occurs rarely, it has been encountered with increasing frequency in clinical settings. In the current study we noted the risk factors and clinical features of the children with S.paucimobilis infections, and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of the isolated strains among the patients. This study was conducted in Dr. BehÃ§et Uz Childrenâs Hospital, Turkey, during the period of January 2005 and December 2012. The medical records of pediatric patients with positive cultures for S.paucimobilis were reviewed. Sphingomonas paucimobilis isolates were recovered from 24 pediatric patients. The median age was 4 years (ranging from 3 days infant to 15 years and 58,3% were male. Eight (33,3% of the patients were under 1 months of age. Among the patients; 13 (54,2% infections were community related however 11(45.8% infections were nosocomial infection. The median duration of hospital stay was 7 days (ranging from 4 to 22 days. The most effective antibiotics were fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. This is the first largest study in children to evaluate the clinical features of S. paucimobilis infections. Sphingomonas paucimobilis may cause infections in both previously healthy and immunocompromised children. Although variable antimicrobial regimens were achieved to the patients, there was no attributable fatality due to S.paucimobilis infections due to the low virulence of the bacteria.\n\nPoly(Aspartic Acid) Degradation by a Sphingomonas sp. Isolated from Freshwater\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nTabata, Kenji; Kasuya, Ken-Ichi; Abe, Hideki; Masuda, Kozue; Doi, Yoshiharu\n\n1999-01-01\n\nA poly(aspartic acid) degrading bacterium (strain KT-1 [JCM10459]) was isolated from river water and identified as a member of the genus Sphingomonas. The isolate degraded only poly(aspartic acid)s of low molecular masses (\n\nIn vitro susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium fortuitum, and Mycobacterium chelonae to ticarcillin in combination with clavulanic acid.\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nCasal, M J; Rodriguez, F C; Luna, M D; Benavente, M C\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe in vitro susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium fortuitum, and Mycobacterium chelonae (M. chelonei) to ticarcillin in combination with calvulanic acid (CA) was studied by the agar dilution method. All the M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, and M. africanum strains were inhibited at a ticarcillin concentration of 32 micrograms/ml or lower in combination with 5 micrograms of CA. M. chelonae and M. avium strains ...\n\nIsolation and characterization of an isoproturon mineralizing Sphingomonas sp. strain SH from a French agricultural soil.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHussain, Sabir; Devers-Lamrani, Marion; El Azhari, Najoi; Martin-Laurent, Fabrice\n\n2011-06-01\n\nThe phenylurea herbicide isoproturon, 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (IPU), was found to be rapidly mineralized in an agricultural soil in France that had been periodically exposed to IPU. Enrichment cultures from samples of this soil isolated a bacterial strain able to mineralize IPU. 16S rRNA sequence analysis showed that this strain belonged to the phylogeny of the genus Sphingomonas (96% similarity with Sphingomonas sp. JEM-14, AB219361) and was designated Sphingomonas sp. strain SH. From this strain, a partial sequence of a 1,2-dioxygenase (catA) gene coding for an enzyme degrading catechol putatively formed during IPU mineralization was amplified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the catA sequence was related to Sphingomonas spp. and showed a lack of congruence between the catA and 16S rRNA based phylogenies, implying horizontal gene transfer of the catA gene cluster between soil microbiota. The IPU degrading ability of strain SH was strongly influenced by pH with maximum degradation taking place at pH 7.5. SH was only able to mineralize IPU and its known metabolites including 4-isopropylaniline and it could not degrade other structurally related phenylurea herbicides such as diuron, linuron, monolinuron and chlorotoluron or their aniline derivatives. These observations suggest that the catabolic abilities of the strain SH are highly specific to the metabolism of IPU.\n\nPyrosequencing as a tool for the identification of common isolates of Mycobacterium sp.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTuohy, Marion J; Hall, Gerri S; Sholtis, Mary; Procop, Gary W\n\n2005-04-01\n\nPyrosequencing technology, sequencing by addition, was evaluated for categorization of mycobacterial isolates. One hundred and eighty-nine isolates, including 18 ATCC and Trudeau Mycobacterial Culture Collection (TMC) strains, were studied. There were 38 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, 27 M. kansasii, 27 MAI complex, 21 M. marinum, 14 M. gordonae, 20 M. chelonae-abscessus group, 10 M. fortuitum, 5 M. xenopi, 3 M. celatum, 2 M. terrae complex, 20 M. mucogenicum, and 2 M. scrofulaceum. Nucleic acid extracts were prepared from solid media or MGIT broth. Traditional PCR was performed with one of the primers biotinylated; the assay targeted a portion of the 16S rRNA gene that contains a hypervariable region, which has been previously shown to be useful for the identification of mycobacteria. The PSQ Sample Preparation Kit was used, and the biotinylated PCR product was processed to a single-stranded DNA template. The sequencing primer was hybridized to the DNA template in a PSQ96 plate. Incorporation of the complementary nucleotides resulted in light generation peaks, forming a pyrogram, which was evaluated by the instrument software. Thirty basepairs were used for isolate categorization. Manual interpretation of the sequences was performed if the quality of the 30-bp sequence was in doubt or if more than 4 bp homopolymers were recognized. Sequences with more than 5 bp of bad quality were deemed unacceptable. When blasted against GenBank, 179 of 189 sequences (94.7%) assigned isolates to the correct molecular genus or group. Ten M. gordonae isolates had more than 5 bp of bad quality sequence and were not accepted. Pyrosequencing of this hypervariable region afforded rapid and acceptable characterization of common, routinely isolated clinical Mycobacterium sp. Algorithms are recommended for further differentiation with an additional sequencing primer or additional biochemicals.\n\nDraft Genome Sequence of MCPA-Degrading Sphingomonas sp.

It stabilized the emulsions more efficiently than commercial gums such as arabic, tragacanth, karaya and xanthan. Emulsions were stable for 6 months, from 4 to 40Â°C and pH 4 to 10 and in the presence of NaCl up to 50 g/l. The polysaccharide had no discernible toxicity towards mice when tested using World Health Organization guidelines.\n\nThe novel oleaginous bacterium Sphingomonas sp. EGY1 DSM 29616: a value added platform for renewable biodiesel.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAmer, Nehad N; Elbahloul, Yasser; Embaby, Amira M; Hussein, Ahmed\n\n2017-07-01\n\nOleaginous microorganisms are regarded as efficient, renewable cell factories for lipid biosynthesis, a biodiesel precursor, to overwhelm the cosmopolitan energy crisis with affordable investment capital costs. Present research highlights production and characterization of lipids by a newly isolated oleaginous bacterium, Sphingomonas sp. EGY1 DSM 29616 through an eco-friendly approach. Only sweet whey [42.1% (v/v)] in tap water was efficiently used as a growth medium and lipid production medium to encourage cell growth and trigger lipid accumulation simultaneously. Cultivation of Sphingomonas sp. EGY1 DSM 29616 in shake flasks resulted in the accumulation of 8.5Â gÂ L -1 lipids inside the cells after 36Â h at 30âÂ°C. Triglycerides of C16:C18 saturated and unsaturated fatty acids showed a similar pattern to tripalmitin or triolein; deduced from gas chromatography (GC), thin layer chromatography (TLC), and Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight-mass spectra analysis (MALDI-TOF-MS) analyses. Batch cultivation 2.5Â L in a laboratory scale fermenter led to 13.8Â gÂ L -1 accumulated lipids after 34Â h at 30âÂ°C. Present data would underpin the potential of Sphingomonas sp. EGY1 DSM 29616 as a novel renewable cell factory for biosynthesis of biodiesel.\n\nCrystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of alginate importer from Sphingomonas sp.

A1 is a member of the ABC transporter superfamily that directly transports alginate polysaccharide into the cytoplasm. Crystals of alginate importer in complex with the periplasmic binding protein AlgQ2 diffracted X-rays to 3.3 Ã resolution. Sphingomonas sp. A1 directly incorporates alginate polysaccharides through a âsuperchannelâ comprising a pit on the cell surface, alginate-binding proteins in the periplasm and an ABC transporter (alginate importer) in the inner membrane. Alginate importer, consisting of four subunits, AlgM1, AlgM2 and two molecules of AlgS, was crystallized in the presence of the binding protein AlgQ2.

However, the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway of these species remains unclear. In this study, we cloned and characterized a carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster containing four carotenogenic genes (crtG, crtY, crtI and crtB and a Î²-carotene hydroxylase gene (crtZ located outside the cluster, from the gellan-gum producing bacterium Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461. Each of these genes was inactivated, and the biochemical function of each gene was confirmed based on chromatographic and spectroscopic analysis of the intermediates accumulated in the knockout mutants. Moreover, the crtG gene encoding the 2,2'-Î²-hydroxylase and the crtZ gene encoding the Î²-carotene hydroxylase, both responsible for hydroxylation of Î²-carotene, were confirmed by complementation studies using Escherichia coli producing different carotenoids. Expression of crtG in zeaxanthin and Î²-carotene accumulating E. coli cells resulted in the formation of nostoxanthin and 2,2'-dihydroxy-Î²-carotene, respectively. Based on these results, a biochemical pathway for synthesis of nostoxanthin in S. elodea ATCC 31461 is proposed.\n\nCloning and characterization of genes involved in nostoxanthin biosynthesis of Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhu, Liang; Wu, Xuechang; Li, Ou; Qian, Chaodong; Gao, Haichun\n\n2012-01-01\n\nMost Sphingomonas species synthesize the yellow carotenoid nostoxanthin.

Among the 59 pediatric cases of S. paucimobilis infection reported in the literature, the most common diagnosis involves isolated bacteremia. These cases are related to sporadic or epidemic infections. Death related to this infection occurred in only one case. The authors report a case of an 11-year-old boy with the diagnosis of Sphingomonas paucimobilis otomastoiditis and a thorough review of the literature on this infection in pediatrics.

Some of them cause problems in immunodeficient patients. Over the last decade, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was established in 45 novel species of nontuberculous mycobacteria. Experiences revealed that this method underestimates the diversity, but does not distinguish between some of mycobacterium subsp. To recognize emerging rapidly growing mycobacteria and identify their subsp, rpoB gene sequencing has been developed. To better understand the transmission of nontuberculous mycobacterial species from drinking water and preventing the spread of illness with these bacteria, the aim of this study was to detect the presence of bacteria by PCR-sequencing techniques. Drinking water samples were collected from different areas of Kermanshah city in west of IRAN. After decontamination with cetylpyridinium chloride, samples were filtered with 0.45-micron filters, the filter transferred directly on growth medium waiting to appear in colonies, then DNA extraction and PCR were performed, and products were sent to sequencing. We found 35/110 (32%) nontuberculous mycobacterial species in drinking water samples, isolates included Mycobacterium goodii, Mycobacterium aurum, and Mycobacterium gastri with the most abundance (11.5%), followed by Mycobacterium smegmatis, Mycobacterium porcinum, Mycobacterium peregrinum, Mycobacterium mucogenicum, and Mycobacterium chelonae (8%). In this study, we recognized the evidence of contamination by nontuberculous mycobacteria in corroded water pipes. As a result of the high prevalence of these bacteria in drinking water in Kermanshah, this is important evidence of transmission through drinking water. This finding can also help public health policy makers control these isolates in drinking water supplies in Kermanshah.\n\nMycobacterium saopaulense sp. nov., a rapidly growing mycobacterium closely related to members of the Mycobacterium chelonae--Mycobacterium abscessus group.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNogueira, Christiane LourenÃ§o; Whipps, Christopher M; Matsumoto, Cristianne Kayoko; Chimara, Erica; Droz, Sara; Tortoli, Enrico; de Freitas, Denise; Cnockaert, Margo; Palomino, Juan Carlos; Martin, Anandi; Vandamme, Peter; LeÃ£o, Sylvia Cardoso\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFive isolates of non-pigmented, rapidly growing mycobacteria were isolated from three patients and,in an earlier study, from zebrafish. Phenotypic and molecular tests confirmed that these isolates belong to the Mycobacterium chelonae-Mycobacterium abscessus group, but they could not be confidently assigned to any known species of this group. Phenotypic analysis and biochemical tests were not helpful for distinguishing these isolates from other members of the M. chelonaeâM.abscessus group. The isolates presented higher drug resistance in comparison with other members of the group, showing susceptibility only to clarithromycin. The five isolates showed a unique PCR restriction analysis pattern of the hsp65 gene, 100 % similarity in 16S rRNA gene and hsp65 sequences and 1-2 nt differences in rpoB and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences.Phylogenetic analysis of a concatenated dataset including 16S rRNA gene, hsp65, and rpoB sequences from type strains of more closely related species placed the five isolates together, as a distinct lineage from previously described species, suggesting a sister relationship to a group consisting of M. chelonae, Mycobacterium salmoniphilum, Mycobacterium franklinii and Mycobacterium immunogenum. DNAâDNA hybridization values .70 % confirmed that the five isolates belong to the same species, while values ,70 % between one of the isolates and the type strains of M. chelonae and M. abscessus confirmed that the isolates belong to a distinct species. The polyphasic characterization of these isolates, supported by DNAâDNA hybridization results,demonstrated that they share characteristics with M. chelonaeâM. abscessus members, butconstitute a different species, for which the name Mycobacterium saopaulense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is EPM10906T (5CCUG 66554T5LMG 28586T5INCQS 0733T).\n\nPhotodynamic inactivation of the models Mycobacterium phlei and Mycobacterium smegmatis in vitro\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBruce-Micah, R.; Gamm, U.; HÃ¼ttenberger, D.; Cullum, J.; Foth, H.-J.\n\n2009-07-01\n\nPhotodynamic inactivation (PDI) of bacterial strains presents an attractive potential alternative to antibiotic therapies. Success is dependent on the effective accumulation in bacterial cells of photochemical substances called photosensitizers, which are usually porphyrins or their derivatives. The kinetics of porphyrin synthesis after treatment with the precursor ALA and the accumulation of the Chlorin e6 and the following illumination were studied. The goal was to estimate effectivity of the destructive power of these PS in vitro in respect of the physiological states of Mycobacteria. So the present results examine the cell destruction by PDI using ALA-induced Porphyrins and Chlorin e6 accumulated in Mycobacterium phlei and Mycobacterium smegmatis, which serve as models for the important pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium bovis. We could show that both Mycobacterium after ALA and Chlorin e6 application were killed by illumination with light of about 662 nm. A reduction of about 97% could be reached by using a lightdose of 70 mW/cm2.\n\nIn vitro Inhibition of Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nSome Nigerian plants used in traditional medicine to treat tuberculosis and/or some of its symptoms were screened for in vitro activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis and a clinical isolate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Comparison of whole-genome sequences have become the method of choice for classification of prokaryotes, thus allowing the identification of bacteria from an evolutionary perspective, and providing data to resolve some current controversies. Currently, controversy exists about the assignment of members of the Mycobacterium avium complex, as is for the cases of Mycobacterium yongonense and 'Mycobacterium indicus pranii'. These two mycobacteria, closely related to Mycobacterium intracellulare on the basis of standard phenotypic and single gene-sequences comparisons, were not considered a member of such species on the basis on some particular differences displayed by a single strain. Whole-genome sequence comparison procedures, namely the average nucleotide identity and the genome distance, showed that those two mycobacteria should be considered members of the species M. intracellulare. The results were confirmed with other whole-genome comparison supplementary methods. According to the data provided, Mycobacterium yongonense and 'Mycobacterium indicus pranii' should be considered and renamed and included as members of M. intracellulare. This study highlights the problems caused when a novel species is accepted on the basis of a single strain, as was the case for M. yongonense. Based mainly on whole-genome sequence analysis, we conclude that M. yongonense should be reclassified as a subspecies of Mycobacterium intracellulareas Mycobacterium intracellularesubsp. yongonense and 'Mycobacterium indicus pranii' classified in the same subspecies as the type strain of Mycobacterium intracellulare and classified as Mycobacterium intracellularesubsp. intracellulare.\n\nBiodegradation of dimethyl phthalate by Sphingomonas sp. isolated from phthalic-acid-degrading aerobic granules.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZeng, Ping; Moy, Benjamin Yan-Pui; Song, Yong-Hui; Tay, Joo-Hwa\n\n2008-10-01\n\nPhthalic acid esters (PAEs) contamination in water, air, and soil is one of the major environmental concerns in many countries. Besides the PAE biodegradation process, the PAE degrading bacteria have become one of the focuses of study. This study reports the successful isolation of one kind of indigenous bacterium PA-02 from phthalic acid (PA)-degrading aerobic granules. Based on its 16S ribosomal DNA sequence, isolate PA-02 was identified as Sphingomonas genus with 100% similarity to Sphingomonas sp. strain D84532. Strain PA-02 was a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium with strong auto-aggregation ability. In particular, the strain PA-02 possessed PAE-degrading ability without acclimation. Results of growth tests showed that strain PA-02 could degrade dimethyl phthalate (DMP), dibutyl phthalate, and diethylhexyl phthalate. The specific degradation rates of DMP and PA were concentration-dependent with maximum values of 0.4 g-DMP g(-1) biomass h(-1) and 1.3 g-PA g(-1) biomass h(-1), respectively. Kinetic studies also revealed that PA-02 was robust under high concentrations of DMP and PA. Even when the PA concentration was increased to 1,000.0 mg l(-1), the specific PA degradation rate was about 0.25 g-PA g(-1) biomass h(-1). The corresponding value for DMP was 0.067 g-DMP g(-1) biomass h(-1) at 1,000 mg l(-1).\n\nMycobacterium persicum sp. nov., a novel species closely related to Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium gastri.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShahraki, Abdolrazagh Hashemi; Trovato, Alberto; Mirsaeidi, Mehdi; Borroni, Emanuele; Heidarieh, Parvin; Hashemzadeh, Mohamad; Shahbazi, Narges; Cirillo, Daniela M; Tortoli, Enrico\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFour strains isolated in Iran from pulmonary specimens of unrelated patients are proposed as representative of a novel Mycobacterium species. Similarity, at the phenotypic level, with Mycobacterium kansasii is remarkable with the photochromogenic yellow pigmentation of the colonies being the salient feature. They differ, however, genotypically from this species and present unique sequences in 16S rRNA, hsp65 and rpoB genes. The average nucleotide identity and the genome-to-genome distance fully support the status of an independent species. The name proposed for this species is Mycobacterium persicum sp. nov. with AFPC-000227T (=DSM 104278T=CIP 111197T) as the type strain.\n\nSpecific growth rate plays a critical role in hydrogen peroxide resistance of the marine oligotrophic ultramicrobacterium Sphingomonas alaskensis strain RB2256\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nOstrowski, M; Cavicchioli, R; Gottschal, JC; Blaauw, Maarten\n\nThe marine oligotrophic ultramicrobacterium Sphingomonas alaskensis RB2256 has a physiology that is distinctly different from that of typical copiotrophic marine bacteria, such as Vibrio angustum S14.

They are all nonpigmented rapid growers and are related phenotypically and genetically to the Mycobacterium chelonae-Mycobacterium abscessus group. Extensive characterization by phenotypic analysis, biochemical tests, drug susceptibility testing, PCR restriction enzyme analysis of the hsp65 gene and ITS, DNA sequencing of housekeeping genes and DNA-DNA hybridization demonstrated that 'M. franklinii' DSM 45524, D16Q19 and D16R27 belong to a single species that is separated from other members of the M. chelonae-M. abscessus group. On the basis of these results we propose the formal recognition of Mycobacterium franklinii sp. nov. Strain DSM 45524(T) (â= ATCC BAA-2149(T)) is the type strain.\n\nRizoremediaÃ§Ã£o de pentaclorofenol em um solo argiloso por sphingomonas chlorophenolica ATCC 39723 Pentachlorophenol rhizoremediation in a loamy soil by sphingomonas chlorophenolica ATCC 39723\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRosemeri I.

Measurements of PCP concentrations were carried out in a laboratory basis using High performance liquid chromatography analysis (HPLC. The toxic effect of PCP on plants was studied through the monitoring of the plant growth. The biodegradation of PCP by S. chlorophenolica in soil was assessed with a bioluminescence assay of Escherichia coli HB101 pUCD607 and bacterial analyses in roots and soil. The planted and inoculated soil showed a faster degradation when compared to the inoculated soil without plants. There was a significative increase in the populations of the organisms tested in the roots when compared to the soil. The monitoring of the plant growth showed a protective role of S. chlorophenolica against the toxicity of PCP in the loamy soil.\n\nDraft Genome Sequence of Isoproturon-Mineralizing Sphingomonas sp.

Alun W.; Aamand, Jens; Walker, Allan\n\n2003-01-01\n\nSubstantial spatial variability in the degradation rate of the phenyl-urea herbicide isoproturon (IPU) [3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea] has been shown to occur within agricultural fields, with implications for the longevity of the compound in the soil, and its movement to ground- and surface water. The microbial mechanisms underlying such spatial variability in degradation rate were investigated at Deep Slade field in Warwickshire, United Kingdom. Most-probable-number analysis showed that rapid degradation of IPU was associated with proliferation of IPU-degrading organisms. Slow degradation of IPU was linked to either a delay in the proliferation of IPU-degrading organisms or apparent cometabolic degradation. Using enrichment techniques, an IPU-degrading bacterial culture (designated strain F35) was isolated from fast-degrading soil, and partial 16S rRNA sequencing placed it within the Sphingomonas group. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified bacterial community 16S rRNA revealed two bands that increased in intensity in soil during growth-linked metabolism of IPU, and sequencing of the excised bands showed high sequence homology to the Sphingomonas group. However, while F35 was not closely related to either DGGE band, one of the DGGE bands showed 100% partial 16S rRNA sequence homology to an IPU-degrading Sphingomonas sp. (strain SRS2) isolated from Deep Slade field in an earlier study. Experiments with strains SRS2 and F35 in soil and liquid culture showed that the isolates had a narrow pH optimum (7 to 7.5) for metabolism of IPU. The pH requirements of IPU-degrading strains of Sphingomonas spp. could largely account for the spatial variation of IPU degradation rates across the field.

Dept. of Biology and Chemistry\n\n2007-05-15\n\nThe influence of growth medium on cometabolic degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was investigated when Sphingomonas sp. strain PheB4 isolated from surface mangrove sediments was grown in either phenanthrene-containing mineral salts medium (PMSM) or nutrient broth (NB). The NB-grown culture exhibited a more rapid cometabolic degradation of single and mixed non-growth substrate PAHs compared to the PMSM-grown culture. The concentrations of PAH metabolites were also lower in NB-grown culture than in PMSM-grown culture, suggesting that NB-grown culture removed metabolites at a faster rate, particularly, for metabolites produced from cometabolic degradation of a binary mixture of PAHs. Cometabolic pathways of single PAH (anthracene, fluorene, or fluoranthene) in NB-grown culture showed similarity to that in PMSM-grown culture. However, cometabolic pathways of mixed PAHs were more diverse in NB-grown culture than that in PMSM-grown culture. These results indicated that nutrient rich medium was effective in enhancing cometabolic degradation of mixed PAHs concomitant with a rapid removal of metabolites, which could be useful for the bioremediation of mixed PAHs contaminated sites using Sphingomonas sp. strain PheB4.

GY2B.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShe, Bojia; Tao, Xueqin; Huang, Ting; Lu, Guining; Zhou, Zhili; Guo, Chuling; Dang, Zhi\n\n2016-03-01\n\nNano bamboo charcoal (NBC) has been commonly used in the production of textiles, plastics, paint, etc. However, little is known regarding their effects towards the microorganisms. The effects of NBC on phenanthrene degrading strain Sphingomonas sp. GY2B were investigated in the present study. Results showed that the addition of NBC could improve the phenanthrene removal by Sphingomonas sp. GY2B, with removal efficiencies increased by 10.29-18.56% in comparison to the control at 24h, and phenanthrene was almost completely removed at 48h. With the presence of low dose of NBC (20 and 50mgL(-1)), strain GY2B displayed a better growth at 6h, suggesting that NBC was beneficial to the growth of GY2B and thus resulting in the quick removal of phenanthrene from water. However, the growth of strain GY2B in high dose of NBC (200mgL(-1)) was inhibited at 6h, and the inhibition could be attenuated and eliminated after 12h. NBC-effected phenanthrene solubility experiment suggested that NBC makes a negligible contribution to the solubilization of phenanthrene in water. Results of electronic microscopy analysis (SEM and TEM) indicated NBC may interact with the cell membrane, causing the enhanced membrane permeability and then NBC adsorbed on the membrane would enter into the cells. The findings of this work would provide important information for the future usage and long-term environmental risk assessment of NBC. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

At present, M. bovis tuberculosis is still a problem of importance in many countries and is considered the main cause of zoonotic tuberculosis throughout the world. Recent development of molecular epidemiological tools has helped us to improve our knowledge about transmission patterns of this organism, which causes a disease indistinguishable from that caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Diagnosis and treatment of this mycobacterium are similar to those for conventional tuberculosis, with the important exceptions of constitutive resistance to pyrazinamide and the fact that multidrug-resistant and extremely drug-resistant M. bovis strains have been described. Among other members of this complex, Mycobacterium africanum is the cause of many cases of tuberculosis in West Africa and can be found in other areas mainly in association with immigration. M. bovis BCG is the currently available vaccine for tuberculosis, but it can cause disease in some patients. Other members of the M. tuberculosis complex are mainly animal pathogens with only exceptional cases of human disease, and there are even some strains, like \"Mycobacterium canettii,\" which is a rare human pathogen that could have an important role in the knowledge of the evolution of tuberculosis in the history.\n\nThe draft genome of Mycobacterium aurum, a potential model organism for investigating drugs against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nPhelan, Jody; Maitra, Arundhati; McNerney, Ruth; Nair, Mridul; Gupta, Antima; Coll, Francesc; Pain, Arnab; Bhakta, Sanjib; Clark, Taane G.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nMycobacterium aurum (M. aurum) is an environmental mycobacteria that has previously been used in studies of anti-mycobacterial drugs due to its fast growth rate and low pathogenicity.

With more and more mycobacterial genomes being sequenced, any knowledge generated from comparative genomic analysis would provide better insights into the biology, evolution, phylogeny and pathogenicity of this genus, thus helping in better management of diseases caused by Mycobacterium spp.With this motivation, we constructed MycoCAP, a new comparative analysis platform dedicated to the important genus Mycobacterium. This platform currently provides information of 2108 genome sequences of at least 55 Mycobacterium spp. A number of intuitive web-based tools have been integrated in MycoCAP particularly for comparative analysis including the PGC tool for comparison between two genomes, PathoProT for comparing the virulence genes among the Mycobacterium strains and the SuperClassification tool for the phylogenic classification of the Mycobacterium strains and a specialized classification system for strains of Mycobacterium abscessus. We hope the broad range of functions and easy-to-use tools provided in MycoCAP makes it an invaluable analysis platform to speed up the research discovery on mycobacteria for researchers.

Methods: The milk sample was collected from a cow with mastitis, which was pretreated with 4 % NaOH and inoculated with L-J medium for Mycobacterium isolation. The positive cultures were initially identified by acid-fast staining and multi-loci PCR, then Mycobacterium species was identified by the multiple loci sequence analysis (MLSA) with 16S rRNA , hsp65 , ITS and SodA genes. The drug sensitivity of the isolates to 27 antibiotics was tested by alamar blue assay. Results: Two anti-acid stain positive strains were isolated from the milk of a cow with mastitis, which were identified as non- tuberculosis mycobacterium by multi-loci PCR, and multi-loci nucleic acid sequence analysis indicated that one strain was Mycobacterium thermoresistibile and another one was Mycobacterium elephantis . The results of the drug susceptibility test showed that the two strains were resistant to most antibiotics, including rifampicin and isoniazid, but they were sensitive to amikacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, ethambutol, streptomycin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin and linezolid. Conclusions: Mycobacterium thermoresistibile and Mycobacterium elephantis were isolated in a cow with mastitis and the drug susceptibility spectrum of the pathogens were unique. The results of the study can be used as reference for the prevention and control the infection in cows.\n\nMycobacterium talmoniae sp. nov., a slowly growing mycobacterium isolated from human respiratory samples.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDavidson, Rebecca M; DeGroote, Mary Ann; Marola, Jamie L; Buss, Sarah; Jones, Victoria; McNeil, Michael R; Freifeld, Alison G; Elaine Epperson, L; Hasan, Nabeeh A; Jackson, Mary; Iwen, Peter C; Salfinger, Max; Strong, Michael\n\n2017-08-01\n\nA novel slowly growing, non-chromogenic species of the class Actinobacteria was isolated from a human respiratory sample in Nebraska, USA, in 2012. Analysis of the internal transcribed spacer sequence supported placement into the genus Mycobacterium with high sequence similarity to a previously undescribed strain isolated from a patient respiratory sample from Oregon, USA, held in a collection in Colorado, USA, in 2000. The two isolates were subjected to phenotypic testing and whole genome sequencing and found to be indistinguishable. The bacteria were acid-fast stain-positive, rod-shaped and exhibited growth after 7-10âdays on solid media at temperatures ranging from 25 to 42Â°C. Colonies were non-pigmented, rough and slightly raised. Analyses of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight profiles showed no matches against a reference library of 130 mycobacterial species. Full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences were identical for the two isolates, the average nucleotide identity (ANI) between their genomes was 99.7â% and phylogenetic comparisons classified the novel mycobacteria as the basal most species in the slowly growing Mycobacterium clade. Mycobacterium avium is the most closely related species based on rpoB gene sequence similarity (92â%), but the ANI between the genomes was 81.5â%, below the suggested cut-off for differentiating two species (95â%). Mycolic acid profiles were more similar to M. avium than to Mycobacterium simiae or Mycobacterium abscessus. The phenotypic and genomic data support the conclusion that the two related isolates represent a novel Mycobacterium species for which the name Mycobacterium talmoniae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NE-TNMC-100812T (=ATCC BAA-2683T=DSM 46873T).\n\nMycobacterium ahvazicum sp. nov., the nineteenth species of the Mycobacterium simiae complex.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBouam, Amar; Heidarieh, Parvin; Shahraki, Abodolrazagh Hashemi; Pourahmad, Fazel; Mirsaeidi, Mehdi; Hashemzadeh, Mohamad; Baptiste, Emeline; Armstrong, Nicholas; Levasseur, Anthony; Robert, Catherine; Drancourt, Michel\n\n2018-03-07\n\nFour slowly growing mycobacteria isolates were isolated from the respiratory tract and soft tissue biopsies collected in four unrelated patients in Iran. Conventional phenotypic tests indicated that these four isolates were identical to Mycobacterium lentiflavum while 16S rRNA gene sequencing yielded a unique sequence separated from that of M. lentiflavum. One representative strain AFP-003 T was characterized as comprising a 6,121,237-bp chromosome (66.24% guanosine-cytosine content) encoding for 5,758 protein-coding genes, 50 tRNA and one complete rRNA operon. A total of 2,876 proteins were found to be associated with the mobilome, including 195 phage proteins. A total of 1,235 proteins were found to be associated with virulence and 96 with toxin/antitoxin systems. The genome of AFP-003 T has the genetic potential to produce secondary metabolites, with 39 genes found to be associated with polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide syntases and 11 genes encoding for bacteriocins. Two regions encoding putative prophages and three OriC regions separated by the dnaA gene were predicted. Strain AFP-003 T genome exhibits 86% average nucleotide identity with Mycobacterium genavense genome. Genetic and genomic data indicate that strain AFP-003 T is representative of a novel Mycobacterium species that we named Mycobacterium ahvazicum, the nineteenth species of the expanding Mycobacterium simiae complex.\n\nSphingomonas paucimobilis bacteraemia and shock in a patient with rheumatic carditis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nY Yozgat\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Acute rheumatic fever (ARF carditis is treated with steroids, which can cause changes in the cellular immune response, especially decreased CD3 (+ T cells. Nosocomial infections due to steroid use for treatment of ARF carditis or secondary to the changes in the cellular immune response have not been reported in the literature. Sphingomonas paucimobilis is a Gram-negative bacillus causing community- and hospital-acquired infections. It has been reported as causing bacteraemia/sepsis, pneumonia or peritonitis in patients with malignancies, immunosuppression or diabetes. We present a case with S. paucimobilis bacteraemia/sepsis and shock after administration of steroids for treatment of ARF carditis. We suggest early identification of the causative agent and appropriate adjustments of the treatment plan to avoid shock and possible mortality. This is the first reported case of S. paucimobilis bacteraemia/sepsis in the setting of steroid use for ARF carditis.\n\nPesquisa de MicobactÃ©rias Ambientais em Ã¡gua de torneira, luvas e soluÃ§Ãµes utilizadas em procedimentos cirÃºrgicos no Hospital UniversitÃ¡rio GetÃºlio Vargas - Manaus/AM Investigation of Environmental Mycobacteria in tap water, surgical gloves and antiseptic solutions used in surgical procedures at the GetÃºlio Vargas University Hospital, Manaus-AM/Brazil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAdriana Vallejo Restrepo\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Investigou-se por mÃ©todos bacteriolÃ³gicos (cultivo e moleculares (PCR - Restriction Enzyme Analysis, PRA, a presenÃ§a de micobactÃ©rias ambientais em Ã¡guas de torneira, soluÃ§Ãµes e luvas cirÃºrgicas, utilizadas nas etapas dos procedimentos cirÃºrgicos executados no centro cirÃºrgico do Hospital UniversitÃ¡rio Getulio Vargas (HUGV, na cidade de Manaus-Amazonas/Brasil. Foram colhidas e analisadas 105 amostras sendo: 24 de Ã¡guas (colhidas das 2 torneiras existentes no centro cirÃºrgico, 8 de soluÃ§Ã£o de Povidine e 7 de soluÃ§Ã£o de Clorhexidina, que servem para a higienizaÃ§Ã£o das mÃ£os dos cirurgiÃµes; 39 de luvas cirÃºrgicas (superfÃ­cies internas e externas; e 27 de soluÃ§Ãµes que foram efetivamente utilizadas durante o ato cirÃºrgico. Por mÃ©todo bacteriolÃ³gico obteve-se 41 isolados micobacterianos apenas de Ã¡guas das torneiras. Pelo PRA obteve-se a detecÃ§Ã£o de DNA micobacteriano somente na amostra de Ã¡gua que forneceu acima de 100 colÃ´nias de micobactÃ©rias por tubo semeado. Os isolados foram identificados como sendo Mycobacterium celatum perfil 2, M. gordonae perfil 3, M. gordonae perfil 6, M. intracellulare perfil 1, M. lentiflavum perfil 3 e M. mucogenicum perfil 1. O encontro de M. mucogenicum, espÃ©cie jÃ¡ incriminada em surtos pÃ³s-cirÃºrgicos, indica que devem ser efetuados procedimentos de limpeza e monitoramento em todos os pontos de distribuiÃ§Ã£o de Ã¡guas, visando Ã prevenÃ§Ã£o de surtos de micobacterioses nosocomiais induzidos pelo uso das Ã¡guas nas diferentes atividades de manuseio ou higienizaÃ§Ã£o dos pacientes submetidos a procedimentos invasivos.Using bacteriological (culture and molecular (PCR - Restriction Enzyme Analysis, PRA methods, we investigated the presence of environmental mycobacteria in tap water, antiseptic solutions and surgical gloves, used in carrying out surgical procedures at the GetÃºlio Vargas University Hospital Surgical Center, in Manaus -Amazonas/Brazil.

The molecular taxonomy of the M. terrae complex causing tenosynovitis has not been established despite approximately 50 previously reported cases. We evaluated 26 isolates of the M. terrae complex associated with tenosynovitis or osteomyelitis recovered between 1984 and 2014 from 13 states, including 5 isolates reported in 1991 as M. nonchromogenicum by nonmolecular methods. The isolates belonged to three validated species, one new proposed species, and two novel related strains. The majority of isolates (20/26, or 77%) belonged to two recently described species: Mycobacterium arupense (10 isolates, or 38%) and Mycobacterium heraklionense (10 isolates, or 38%). Three isolates (12%) had 100% sequence identity to each other by 16S rRNA and 99.3 to 100% identity by rpoB gene region V sequencing and represent a previously undescribed species within the M. terrae complex. There were no isolates of M. terrae or M. nonchromogenicum, including among the five isolates reported in 1991. The 26 isolates were susceptible to clarithromycin (100%), rifabutin (100%), ethambutol (92%), and sulfamethoxazole or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (70%). The current study suggests that M. arupense, M. heraklionense, and a newly proposed species (\"M. virginiense\" sp. nov.; proposed type strain MO-233 [DSM 100883, CIP 110918]) within the M. terrae complex are the major causes of tenosynovitis and osteomyelitis in the United States, with little change over 20 years.
