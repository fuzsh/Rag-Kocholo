Within fleshy fruit, the skin supports internal cell layers and can provide the initial cues in attracting seed-dispersing animals. The skin of a fruit, termed the exocarp, is a key element of consumer preference and a target for many breeding programs. Across fruiting species there is a huge diversity of exocarp types and these range from a simple single living cell layer (epidermis) often covered with a waxy layer, to complex multicellular suberised and dead cell layers (periderm), with various intermediate russet forms in between. Each exocarp can be interspersed with other structures such as hairs or spines. The epidermis has been well characterised and remains pluripotent with the help of the cells immediately under the epidermis. The periderm, in contrast, is the result of secondary meristematic activity, which replaces the epidermal layers, and is not well characterised in fruits. In this review we explore the structure, composition and mechanisms that control the development of a periderm type fruit exocarp. We draw upon literature from non-fleshy fruit species that form periderm tissue, from which a considerable amount of research has been undertaken."
