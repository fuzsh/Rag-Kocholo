        "text": "Over the past years, Employee Involvement (EI) in Greece entailed limited participation on the part of the workers in decision-making. Nonetheless, in the last decade some progress has been made in this connection, particularly within the subsidiaries of multinational companies (MNCs), thanks to the implementation of the European Works Council Directive (EWCD). In an attempt to provide a contribution to relevant literature through new research findings, this paper examines the factors that affect the effectiveness of EWCs. It is argued that there are some best practices which are associated with certain influencing factors concerning the nature of the MNCs as well as the structure of employee representation.\n\nEuropean Works Councils (EWCs) provide transnational information and consultation mechanisms for employee representatives in multinational companies (MNCs). By organising meetings between central management and employee representatives from the EU Member States in which the companies operate, the EWC builds a bridge between the headquarters where strategic decisions are made and the workplaces where these decisions have an impact on employees. This report explores the efforts of the members in 10 EWCs to enhance these bodies for European companylevel social dialogue. Looking at the developments in EWCs over a longer period of time gives an insight into how practices evolve and how they achieve their objectives. Based on the 10 longitudinal case studies, a comparative analysis explores the factors that can influence these developments and assesses in particular the impact of the 2008 economic and financial crisis and of the recast directive 2009/38/EC. Other factors, such as company ...\n\nDisclaimer/Complaints regulations If you believe that digital publication of certain material infringes any of your rights or (privacy) interests, please let the Library know, stating your reasons.

That explains the limited number of worker participation schemes which appeared within Greek enterprises in the past decades. Nonetheless, during the last decade some progress in the cases of worker participation has been made within the subsidiaries of multinational companies (MNCs), thanks to a European Works Council (EWC) Directive. This paper examines the factors that contribute to the effectiveness of EWCs by reviewing the pertinent literature and enriching it with new research findings from the human resource (HR) management side. The conclusions indicate that there are some good practices of EWCs, which are linked with certain contributing factors concerning the nature of the MNC as well as the structure of employee representation.\n\nThe European Company ( Societas Europaea, SE) regulations include the highest mandatory provision for negotiation of transnational employee voice. What are the effects of transnational employee voice, enacted at works council and board levels, on knowledge exchange within the multinational corporation? This qualitative study of globally active SEs incorporated under the SE regulations that have ‘dual-forum’ transnational employee voice addresses that research gap. Our main contribution reveals that, over time, transnational employee voice facilitates multifaceted knowledge exchange, both widening the platform and strengthening relations for intra-multinational corporation collaboration. Alongside expressing labour interests as intended, dual-forum transnational employee voice stimulates managers and employees to develop mutually beneficial competencies and trust. These aid multilateral knowledge exchange. That knowledge, which includes factors affecting employees and quality of orga...\n\nThis report is the final outcome of the INFORMIA II project, promoted by the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (CITUB). The project aimed to analyse the role of the systems of information and consultation (I&C) at workplace level, including European works councils (EWCs), in several EU member states (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Ireland, Italy and the UK) and one accession country (Croatia). It stimulated the transnational exchange of experience and best practice examples among the partner countries. The aim was to promote and improve the impact of workplace representation and participation structures on productivity, corporate governance and competitiveness, and to promote the European social model and corporate social responsibility in the partner countries."
