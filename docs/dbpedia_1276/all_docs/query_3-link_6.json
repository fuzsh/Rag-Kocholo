Interestingly, previous in vitro studies demonstrated that A2AR expression levels are reduced after treatment with S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), a methyl donor molecule involved in the methylation of important biological structures such as DNA, proteins, and lipids. However, the in vivo effects of SAM treatment on A2AR expression are still obscure. Here, we demonstrated that 2 weeks of SAM treatment produced a significant reduction in the rat striatal A2AR messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein content as well as A2AR-mediated signaling. Furthermore, when the content of 5-methylcytosine levels in the 5′UTR region of ADORA2A was analyzed, this was significantly increased in the striatum of SAM-treated animals; thus, an unambiguous correlation between SAM-mediated methylation and striatal A2AR expression could be established. Overall, we concluded that striatal A2AR functionality can be controlled by SAM treatment, an issue that might be relevant for the management of these neurological conditions that course with increased A2AR expression.\n\nKeywords: S-adenosyl-L-Methionine, SAM, ADORA2A, Adenosine A2A receptor, Methylcytosine, Striatum\n\nIntroduction\n\nAdenosine mediates its actions by the activation of specific plasma membrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) classically classified into four subtypes (A1R, A2AR, A2BR, and A3R) [1]. Both the A1Rs and A2ARs are primarily responsible for the central effects of adenosine [2]. The A2AR, mostly coupled to Gs/Golf proteins [3], is expressed at high levels in only a few regions of the brain, namely primarily striatum, olfactory tubercle, and nucleus accumbens [4]. Interestingly, upregulation of A2AR expression levels has been shown in the putamen and in peripheral blood cells from Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesias, well-correlating with the severity of the disease [5–9].\n\nThe gene that codifies human A2AR (ADORA2A) is located at chromosome 22 [10–13], but its gene expression regulation has not been widely studied [14]. However, we previously demonstrated that DNA methylation plays a key role in both the differential ADORA2A content within different brain areas [15] and the receptor expression levels observed in pathological conditions such as Huntington’s disease and schizophrenia [16, 17]. In addition, we also demonstrated that ADORA2A expression is modulated by S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) treatment in cultured cells [18]. Of note, SAM participates in transmethylation, transsulfuration, and aminopropylation anabolic reactions. Accordingly, SAM constitutes the main biological methyl donor molecule involved in the methylation of DNA, proteins, and phospholipids [19–21]. Interestingly, a previous report showed that parenteral and oral SAM treatments promoted an increase in SAM levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of depressed patients, indicating that SAM crosses the blood–brain barrier [22]. Hence, considering the presented data, we previously proposed the use of SAM as an adjunctive therapy in levodopa-treated PD patients to reduce striatal A2AR levels [23].\n\nTaking into account all these considerations, here, we aimed to demonstrate that in vivo SAM treatment was indeed able to control striatal A2AR expression. To this end, we monitored striatal A2AR messenger RNA (mRNA) content and A2AR ligand-binding avidity in both control and SAM-treated animals. In addition, the 5-methylcytosine levels in the 5′UTR region of ADORA2A were also analyzed, and a close relationship between SAM-mediated methylation and decline in striatal A2AR expression was established.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nMaterials\n\n[3H]ZM241385 ([2-3H](4-(2-[7-amino-2-(2-fury1) [1, 2, 4] triazolo [2,3-a] [1, 3, 5] triazin-5-ylamino]ethyl)phenol 27.4 Ci/mmol) was from the American Radiolabeled Chemicals (Saint Louis, USA). SAM, theophylline, and calf intestine adenosine deaminase (ADA) were obtained from Sigma (Madrid, Spain). All other products were of analytical grade. SAM was diluted in sterile water.\n\nAnimals\n\nThirty rats (Sprague–Dawley, 100 g in weight) were housed with access to food and water ad libitum in a colony room kept at 19–22 °C and 40–60 % humidity under a 12:12 h light/dark cycle. All procedures were performed in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the local animal care committee of Universitat de Barcelona (99/01) and the Generalitat de Catalunya (99/1094). The rats were killed under anesthesia (400 mg/Kg chloral hydrate), and their brains were rapidly removed from the skull. The whole left striatum containing both dorsal (caudate–putamen) and ventral (nucleus accumbens) striatal areas were dissected and immediately frozen at −80 °C.\n\nIn a first set of animals (saline- and SAM-treated rats, n = 5 for each group), the left striatum was removed for mRNA and DNA methylation analysis. In a second animal cohort (n = 5–10 for each group), the whole left striatum was used for binding assay and cAMP determinations.\n\n[3H]ZM 241385 binding assay to striatal membranes extracts\n\nStriatal membrane extracts from saline- and SAM-treated rats were obtained and used for A2AR radioligand-binding assays as previously described [24]. Briefly, membrane extracts were incubated with 5 U/mg ADA in 50 mM Tris HCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 for 30 min at 25 °C in order to eliminate endogenous adenosine from membrane preparations. Then, membrane extracts (70 μg of protein) were incubated with the specific and selective A2AR antagonist [3H]ZM 241385 at 40 nM for 2 h at 25 °C using 5-mM theophylline to obtain non-specific binding. Binding assays were stopped by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B filters, which were immediately washed and counted in a Microbeta Trilux liquid scintillation counter (Wallac).\n\ncAMP assay\n\nTotal cAMP accumulation was measured using the LANCE Ultra cAMP kit (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Striatal membrane extracts (1 μg) from saline- and SAM-treated rats were resuspended in stimulation buffer (HBSS 1X, 5 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 % BSA) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Afterwards, zardaverine (10 μM), GTP (10 μM), and ATP (150 μM) were included into the extract and were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the ligands (Basal, 1 μM Forskolin and 200 nM CGS) were added for 30 min at room temperature prior to lysis. Eu-cAMP tracer and ULight™-anti-cAMP reagents were prepared and added to the sample according to the LANCE® Ultra cAMP Kit instruction manual. Three hundred eighty-four-well plate was incubated 1 h at room temperature in the dark and was then read on a POLARstar microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Durham, NC, USA). Measurement at 620 and 665 nm were used to detect the TR-FRET signal, and the concomitant cAMP levels were calculated following the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nRNA purification\n\nRNA purification was carried out with RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The concentration of each sample was obtained from A260 measurements with Nanodrop 1000. RNA integrity was tested using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).\n\nRetrotranscription reaction\n\nThe retrotranscriptase reaction (100 ng RNA/μL) was carried out by using the High-capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Madrid, Spain) following the protocol provided by the supplier.\n\nTaqMan PCR\n\nTaqMan PCR conditions were the same as previously described [18]. Standard curves for rat ADORA2A, ADORA1, Drd2, and β-glucuronidase (GUS) were prepared using serial dilutions of cDNA from wild-type rat brains. The identification numbers for rat ADORA2A, ADORA1, Drd2, and the endogenous control GUS probes were Rn00583935_m1, Rn00567668_m1, Rn01418275_m1, and Rn00566655_m1, respectively (Applied Biosystems, Madrid, Spain).\n\nQuantitative DNA methylation analysis\n\nDNA purification, bisulfite treatment, and quantitative DNA methylation analysis by MassArray platform of SEQUENOM were performed as described [18]. A locus located in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of rat ADORA2A gene was analyzed to learn the percentage of DNA methylation. Primers were designed using MethPrimer (http://www.urogene.org/methprimer/). The reverse primer presented a T7-promoter tagged to obtain an appropriate product for in vitro transcription and an 8-bp insert to prevent abortive cycling. The forward primer contained a 10mer-tagged to balance the PCR primer length. The sequences of primers used for amplification of bisulfite-treated DNA were (included tags are indicated below in lower case): forward, 5′-aggaagagagATTTTTTTAGTAGGAAGGAAGGGT-3′, reverse, 5′-cagtaatacgactcactatagggagaaggctAAAAAACCAAAATAACACAAACAAC -3′. The locus amplified was located at positions 16466335–16465793 of contig {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NC_005119.3\",\"term_id\":\"389675109\",\"term_text\":\"NC_005119.3\"}}NC_005119.3.\n\nResults and discussion\n\nA fundamental goal of GPCR pharmacology is to settle receptor–ligand interactions in order to catalog receptors according to their thermodynamic and kinetic properties. Interestingly, an important aspect in drug action is not only the ligand concentration but also the receptor availability. Therefore, controlling GPCR expression constitutes a compelling way to manipulate receptor-mediated physiological responses both in normal and in pathological conditions. Hence, here, we aimed to shed light into the in vivo control of A2AR expression, a GPCR with eventual increased prevalence in certain neurological conditions. Indeed, A2AR levels have been shown to be increased in the putamen of some PD patients [5–9].\n\nIn order to evaluate whether SAM treatment was able to modify A2AR expression levels in rat striatum, we administered SAM (100 mg/kg, i.p.) [25] during 2 weeks, and the amount of striatal A2AR was monitored by means of radioligand-binding experiments using [3H]ZM241385, a selective A2AR antagonist. Interestingly, while saline-treated animals showed a [3H]ZM241385-specific binding of 571.6 ± 43.7 fmol/mg protein, the SAM-treated animals exhibited a binding of 328.9 ± 43.6 fmol/mg protein; thus, a significant reduction of ∼40 % (P < 0.001) in the A2AR content was achieved after SAM treatment (Fig. ). Subsequently, we assessed the A2AR functionality in striatal membranes from saline- and SAM-treated animals by measuring the A2AR-mediated cAMP accumulation upon agonist challenge (i.e., {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CGS21680\",\"term_id\":\"878113053\",\"term_text\":\"CGS21680\"}}CGS21680). Thus, a significant reduction of ∼36 % (P < 0.05) in the A2AR-mediated cAMP accumulation in striatal membranes of SAM-treated animals was observed (Fig. ). Finally, we measured the A2AR mRNA levels in the striatum of both saline- and SAM-treated animals by means of TaqMan PCR. Noteworthy, a significant reduction of ∼27 % (P < 0.05) was observed in the striatal A2AR mRNA content of SAM-treated animals (Fig. ), while A1R and dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) mRNA levels remained unchanged (Fig. ). Overall, these results clearly suggested that SAM treatment reduced A2AR expression and function in vivo, thus pointing up to the potential use of SAM to reduce A2AR activity in terms of ADORA2A repression.\n\nSince gene repression could be accomplished through DNA methylation and SAM constitutes one of the main biological methyl donor molecules involved in DNA methylation [19–21], we next aimed to ascertain if ADORA2A downregulation was achieved throughout a methylation process. To this end, the 5-methylcytosine content in the 5′UTR region of rat A2AR gene was measured using the MassArray platform of SEQUENOM. Interestingly, an increase in the percentage of methylated DNA in several CpG sites was detected in SAM-treated rats when compared to saline-treated animals (Fig. ). It is worth mentioning here that some CpG sites within the 5′UTR region of rat ADORA2A could not be quantified by the MassARRAY platform [26]. In addition, some of the CpG sites presented similar degree of methylation since the base-specific cleavage of the in vitro transcription product was not discriminated by the MALDI-TOF analysis (Fig. ). Nonetheless, SAM treatment mediated the specific methylation of several CpG sites within the striatal ADORA2A. Overall, a clear correlation between SAM-mediated methylation and striatal A2AR expression could be established.\n\nIt has been proposed that the main cellular localization of striatal A2AR confers an important role on dopaminergic signaling through its interaction with D2R [27, 28]. As a result of this direct A2AR-D2R interaction [29], antagonists for A2AR have emerged as new targets for non-dopaminergic anti-parkinsonian treatments [30]. Indeed, several clinical trials have shown that the administration of istradefylline (or KW-6002), an A2AR antagonist, ameliorates the dyskinesias induced by chronic levodopa treatment of PD patients [31–38]. Similarly, since A2AR levels have been shown to be increased in the putamen of some PD patients [5–9], it seems likely that ADORA2A repression would be an alternative therapy to reduce A2AR activity. Interestingly, several cerebral areas, such as cerebellum, show reduced A2AR levels, a fact that has been correlated with a high percentage of DNA methylation in ADORA2A. Therefore, SAM-based treatments would be more effective in those brain regions with low 5-methylcytosine levels in ADORA2A, as it occurs in the putamen [15]. In conclusion, based on the restrictive expression of A2AR in the brain and the present results showing that SAM treatment affects striatal A2AR levels, it seems reasonable to consider that SAM may represent a potential co-adjunctive therapy by reducing A2A-mediated D2R inhibition in the management of PD.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, Instituto de Salud Carlos III (grant CP08/00095 to MB), Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad (grants SAF2011-24779, Consolider-Ingenio CSD2008-00005 and PCIN-2013-019-C03-03 to FC, and BFU2011-23034 to MM), and La Fundació La Marató de TV3 (grants 090330 to MB, and 092331 to MM).
