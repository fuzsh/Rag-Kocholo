        "text": "From 2014 to 2019, I wrote for The Philippine Reporter-- an experience that truly shaped my journey as an emerging author.\n\nFor my first article, Mila Garcia commissioned me to write about Proudly Pinoy, a Filipino celebration hosted by the Toronto Catholic District School Board.\n\nAt the time, I was working at a settlement agency, and the most creative thing I was writing were government reports, but she was so encouraging that I knew that I had to try.\n\nThis led to six years of pitching stories, publishing articles, meeting Filipino community leaders in Toronto, British Columbia, and Hawaii, and so much more.\n\nAnd with weeks to go until I launch my debut novel, Reuniting with Strangers, on September 9th, I’m proud to say that The Philippine Reporter was a key part of my path to becoming a published author.\n\nAs the Vice-Principal at Loretto College School, Lily Capalad Adams is a Filipina trailblazer in the Toronto Catholic District School Board. After growing up as a shy student in the Philippines, Adams emigrated to Canada in 1988 when she was in the eighth grade. With the support of her teachers, she found her inner confidence and was inspired to become an educator.\n\nAfter finishing her undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto, and her Teachers’ College and Masters of Education at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, she rose to become one of the few Filipino school administrators at the TCDSB. As Vice-Principal of a school that is 33 percent Filipina, Adams has some powerful advice for students and parents who want a successful school year.\n\n1. You grew up in the Philippines and moved to Canada in the eighth grade. How did being a young newcomer form you into the Vice-Principal you are today?\n\nI was a very timid girl in the Philippines. I felt lost in the crowded classes where the normal class size was over 35 students. I never really liked the academic life of the school.\n\nThe first school I attended was St. Jean de Brebeuf in Scarborough. In contrast to my experience as a student in the Philippines, the smaller class sizes and tight-knit school community of St. Jean de Brebeuf contributed to my success. I also attribute my success and increased school engagement to the principal of the school (I still remember his name: Mr. McGuire). He was very welcoming since Day One. I was one of a few Filipino students, but I never felt left out or alone. He and the teachers provided a very nurturing environment for all students. I became more engaged— and happier— in school by participating in various activities such as the school play. I came a long way.\n\nI want to give students, especially newcomers, the same experience. I wanted to become a teacher to directly impact student learning, but I know that as an administrator, on a larger scale, I could provide opportunities for teachers to better help students, especially students who are often marginalized.\n\nBeing an immigrant, I can empathize with parents who have made sacrifices of uprooting their families and moving to another country. Every year, I meet many parents who experience the same challenges my parents had. Being an administrator, I can be a source of support.\n\n2. What was hard about being a newcomer student in 1988? How did your parents help you while you adjusted to Canadian life?\n\nThe hardest part was missing my family and friends in the Philippines. Christmas and New Years are never the same here. Back then, there were no social media, FaceTime, email, Viber, etc., and making long distance calls was so expensive, so it was really hard to keep in touch with family and friends.\n\nAnother challenging aspect was starting here in Grade 8. Many of the students had already built established friendships. On my first day of school, my mother went up to a girl in the schoolyard and asked if she could show me around. It was a bit embarrassing, but I got over it. It was very hard at first, but I eventually made some friends. I actually still keep in contact with my first friend in Canada.\n\nAnother big adjustment was learning French for the first time. My mother bought beginner books so I could get extra practice. I eventually got caught up. Our parents helped me and my brothers with our schoolwork. They were always available for extra help. My parents worked very hard and exemplified perseverance. I remember my dad saying, “Mag-tiis ka na lang…kayang-kaya mo yan.” They have always been encouraging and were proud even for just small achievements.\n\n3. What inspired you to pursue a career in education?\n\nWhen I was in elementary school in the Philippines, I was not confident in my math ability and did not love math at all— I had math anxiety. It wasn’t until the ninth grade that I came to enjoy and excel in Math. I became a Math teacher because I wanted to tap into that hidden potential in the students. I was also a very timid child in the Philippines, but when I started school here, because of the encouragement of my teachers, I came out of my shell. I believe that being a teacher is a way to give back.\n\n4. What are the top tips you have for Filipino students starting school this September?\n\nAlways ask for help. Do not be shy. Speak up. Be assertive. Talk to your guidance counsellor, child and youth worker, social worker, school chaplain, teachers, or administrators if you are going through personal issues.\n\nKeep your mental health in check. Make time to take a break— that includes unplugging yourself from smartphones, social media, etc., even if it’s for just 30 minutes a day.\n\nEat healthy and sleep— you can’t learn if you do not eat healthy or if you do not get enough sleep. Huwag mag-puyat!\n\n5. Why are these tips so important for Filipino students?\n\nTraditionally, Filipino youth tend to keep feelings bottled up. When I was growing up, there was no such thing as depression nor was there a focus on mental health. It is important for Filipino youth—and their parents— to realize that there are many resources and agencies who can help.\n\nWe live in a world in which technology has been so ingrained in our daily lives. We need to take a break from our smartphones, look up, and communicate face-to-face. It is important to develop early effective communication skills.\n\nLike many Filipinos, I was trained as a young child not to “rock the boat”, “not speak up”, or to just accept how things are. Although it is important to be respectful towards authority figures, young Filipinos need to be confident, assertive, and speak up if they witness injustice or unfairness.\n\n6. Can you share a success story about your most memorable Filipino student?\n\nMy most memorable Filipino student graduated in June. She had a rough home life both back home and in Canada. She found it very hard adjusting to life here. In addition, she had mental health challenges. Despite her personal obstacles, she remained engaged in school and did her best, working very hard. School was her second home where she formed friendships and received a great deal of encouragement from the caring staff of Loretto College. In June, she graduated with honours and was the school valedictorian.\n\n7. What are your top tips for Filipino parents who want to be more engaged in their child’s education?\n\n1. Develop great relationships with your child’s teachers. Remember, it is a partnership.\n\n2. Attend parent council meetings.\n\n3. Attend school events or volunteer.\n\n4. Follow the school’s social media: Instagram, Twitter, etc.\n\n5. Support your child by attending school shows, concerts, etc. Just be present for them.\n\nI know it’s hard to juggle between work and home life, especially when parents work long hours. I am a mother myself. I count on my husband a lot. He is very supportive.\n\n8. Some parents have teaching backgrounds in the Philippines and are looking to teach again in Canada. What is your advice for them?\n\n1. Ask the Ontario College of Teachers for advice as well as Faculties of Education in the province.\n\n2. Be familiar with the demographics of the communities you will be serving. Students in Canadian classrooms are very different from students in the Philippines. Do some research.\n\n3. Make connections in your local schools. Get to know the administrators.\n\n4. Volunteer in schools— network!\n\n5. Know the Ontario Curriculum and other supporting documents well.\n\n6. Know the school board’s mission statement and multi-year strategy.\n\n7. Be familiar with culturally-responsive pedagogy.\n\n8. Be familiar with numeracy and literacy strategies of the schools and the boards.\n\n9. In the Toronto Catholic District School Board, how many fellow Filipino school administrators have you met? How would you encourage other Filipino-Canadian teachers to aspire for leadership positions?\n\nI only know of one Filipino administrator who is now a principal at an elementary school.\n\nMany Filipinos tend to pursue careers that relate to service due to our innate strengths and gifts of caring and nurturing for others, which I believe sometimes makes us shy away from assuming or pursuing leadership positions. I would encourage Filipino-Canadian teachers to draw upon our culture and tradition of service and duty by seeking leadership opportunities. Get involved in your school’s learning improvement plan team or in your school’s student success team. Start a school initiative that not only benefits students but benefits the entire community.\n\n10. What do you love about being a Vice-Principal?\n\nIt is multi-faceted. You wear a lot of hats: teacher, parent, consoler, cheerleader, counsellor, peacemaker, problem-solver, recruiter, adviser, manager, “detective”, even “fashion consultant” (when you enforce the uniform policy, haha!)\n\nIt goes beyond just helping students— you are helping families and you contribute to creating a nurturing learning environment. You make a larger impact in the learning of students. It is servant leadership at its fullest!\n\nThis article was originally published in The Philippine Reporter on October 24, 2019.\n\nUnlike other Filipino clothing lines that use barongs, ternos, or indigenous weaving to show a link to Filipino culture, the Pinay Collection embraces Filipino identity by boldly featuring Tagalog words like ‘maldita’, ‘lakwatsera’, and ‘ambisyosa.’\n\n“I would get called ‘ambisyosa’ a lot in high school because people would tell me that I couldn’t do something and say, ’Ang ambisyosa mo naman!’” said Galit. “I would tell them something I’d want to do, and they’d call me ‘ambisyosa’ like it was out of my reach.”\n\n“These are very much rooted from my experiences, but at the same time, these are also other people’s identity stories, and I’d like to think that through these pieces, Filipinas and Filipinxs share that connection.”\n\nWhile most launches are only focused on sales, Galit had a bigger plan: community healing through a free calligraphy workshop using Filipino words.\n\n“Think about a word— Tagalog or not— that you would like to reclaim,” said Galit. “A word that isn’t necessarily so good, something that’s been used to put you down, or that’s been used to shame you in the past. But you know what? You want to reclaim it, you want to own that word. Write it down and write down why. What does that word mean to you?”\n\n“I’d like to reclaim ‘prangka,’” said Stef Martin of Makulay Atbp. “We could just say our feelings but with compassion for each other. It doesn’t have to be negative when you’re being honest and truthful.”\n\nCommunity leader Glyn Narca’s word was ‘mainggay.’ “When I was in Grade 10, someone told me, ‘You’re loud for an Asian girl.’ So that always makes me feel, ‘Should I be quieter?’” asked Narca. “That’s something that I need to be comfortable with as I grow up: to speak up and not feel like I’m too loud.”\n\nIllustrator Khela Maquiling’s word was ‘maldita.’ “I was a very hyperactive and outspoken kid, and I heard it so many times in various angry tones that I became very quiet and reserved, and I was like that for years,” said Maquiling. “And then I began to think, ‘All of my maldita traits are the traits that make me confident, that make me assert myself in places and spaces that I could never dream of entering. So it’s a word that I’m reclaiming now. I’m maldita, what are you gonna do about it?”\n\nA Role Model\n\nFor Paper Plus Cloth owner Rowena Sunga, the launch and workshop were a pleasant surprise. “When Jovie first approached me about this, I thought it was just about lettering some nice Filipino words that people can relate to, but her message was so much more than that,” said Sunga. “What’s driving her is not the money— it’s about reclaiming what these words mean. I admire her. She’s definitely going to be an inspiration for many people.”\n\nFor Ihayag founder and university student Isabela Villanoy, Galit’s merchandise meant an international representation of Filipina identity. “On the global stage, I think it’s great that Jovie’s putting our culture out there through her clothing line. She’s one of the people I’d like to emulate.”\n\nGalit had also become a role model for Maquiling, an aspiring entrepreneur. “Seeing her utilizing such an artistic skill and making a business out of it is so inspiring. Now that I see someone like her being successful, I’m gaining a little bit more confidence stepping into this world of actually showing my art.”\n\n#WearPinay\n\nWhen it was time to buy the t-shirts, sweatshirts, bags, pins, cards, journals, and pouches, the Pinay Collection sparked discussions and laughter as customers excitedly posed with their new purchases.\n\nAnd as Galit addressed the store filled with customers buying her merchandise, she couldn’t stop smiling. “My goal is that hopefully, when you type the word ‘Pinay,’ something else comes up, something wonderful. Like your faces. Like your stories. I’m really hoping that we can do that together.”\n\nwww.pinaycollection.com\n\n“The way I like to look at it is that we refer to ourselves as a Filipino student association, but it’s not just for Filipinos to associate with Filipinos, it’s for everyone to associate with Filipinos,” said Thompson.\n\nAnd in addition, every event is an opportunity to find FSAT’s future executive committee members.\n\n“Throughout the year, we always try to encourage Filipinos— or anyone in general, actually— to come to our events, to come see what we’re about, and to encourage them to run for executive positions next year,” said Social Events Coordinator John Patrick Carlos.\n\nFor Todd Le Blanc, Assistant Dean for Student Life and Leadership at New College, FSAT’s ability to maintain momentum is why it stands out among other student groups.\n\n“It’s not just the innovation and the community building, but the legacy building,” said Le Blanc. “For the first-year students coming into FSAT, the upper-year students give them responsibilities and they take it and run with it. So there’s a really great pipeline that comes through FSAT that means it’s strong year after year— that’s one of FSAT’s hallmarks for sure.”\n\nWith majors ranging from Animal Physiology to Neuroscience to Equity Studies, the twelve-member executive team boasts a range of interests and skills.\n\n“We know how to work together and how to utilize each other’s strengths,” said Co-President Hilary Naluz. “Each event shows that we’re passionate and we’re driven to do this type of work on this land and in this institution.”\n\n“I’m so proud of what we’ve accomplished for the Filipino community within the university and also within the Greater Toronto Area,” said Co-President Glyn Narca. “We always knew that we were doing something special, but being recognized for it means so much to all of us.”\n\n“The biggest lesson I learned at SG was the mirroring of experiences between Filipino-Canadian youth and the Filipino youth from Oahu and Big Island,” said writer and Ryerson Social Work student Maria Toquero. “We faced similar struggles—from discrimination, to the loss of culture, to immigration, to identity. The highlight of my experience was that I felt like I wasn’t alone.”\n\nFreelance fundraiser, capacity builder at Kababayan, International Relations graduate, and delegate to the United Nations’ 62nd Commission on the Status of Women Karla Villanueva Danan held back tears during the final lunch.\n\n“It was even more magical than I expected,” she said. “Moments would just catch me totally off guard and I would just start crying at how beautiful it was to be surrounded by people who felt and looked like me.”\n\n“My biggest lesson from SG is learning the true potential and result of having a close-knit community and pride in one’s own culture,” said Chemical Engineering student and FCAR executive member Kristian Pacpaco. “I have no doubt that the bonds we, as Toronto delegates, have formed and shared together will be the foundation of a strong community that Toronto and Hawai’i can truly be proud of.”\n\nIn the future, the group plans to create a summer leadership camp for Filipinx youth in Toronto.\n\n“When I think about my wish, it’s that they return back from Hawaii, inspired with a clear illustration of what this camp could look like, but it’s up to them to imagine it and build it for themselves,” said Batac. “It looks very promising already.”\n\nA hui hou, Sariling Gawa— till we meet again.\n\nFor New Canadian Media\n\nBack when I was a settlement worker, many of my newcomer clients would enter the job market in positions of non-skilled labour. Ranging from forklift operators to construction workers to food service workers many of them felt that they would have to start with survival jobs before moving on to a role that fit their credentials. The initial joy that accompanied their first tastes of Canadian employment would pass soon after a couple of months, where they would then meet with me to ask if coming to Canada was the right choice.\n\nUpon arrival, their main barriers revolved around a lack of financial flexibility and professional networks, however after working survival jobs for a time, many would lose confidence. Coming from backgrounds in accounting, engineering, law, IT and other multi-faceted sectors; their old professions would seem so far gone that they would begin to doubt that they could return to them.\n\nWhile precarious work will define the Canadian job market of the future, the majority of immigrants are usually unaware of the available programs that will lead them to more secure positions. As the federal government continues to ramp up efforts to bring in more skilled workers, more support systems have been put in place so that these individuals are able to overcome many of the toughest issues plaguing immigrants in the past.\n\nIf some of the newcomers I had worked with had known about opportunities for training or mentorship, I know that they could have been able to start their Canadian careers sooner.\n\nCanadian Experience\n\nOne of the biggest issues newcomers often face has been a lack of ‘Canadian experience’. Although the Ontario Human Rights Commission has made concerted efforts to discourage employers from discriminating on this basis, many immigrants can attest to the continued existence of this phenomenon. While it can be difficult to regulate employers’ selection basis for a number of reasons, programs that offer both training and employment experience.\n\nNPower Canada, an organization which advocates for diversity in the workplace, provides cost-free employment training programs for youth aged 18-29. Since its 2014 launch in Canada, the charity has been able to train and support over 500 youth.\n\nThe need for such a program has become increasingly apparent in recent years. A 2011 study revealed that 43% of immigrant women between 24-35 with university degrees obtained outside of Canada or the US, were working in positions that required a high school education or less.\n\nBut the statistics are truly brought into perspective with first-hand accounts like 27-year-old Nigerian newcomer Adebola Arogundade’s. She arrived in Canada with a B.Sc in Marketing as well as experience abroad in marketing strategies, point-of-sale systems, and customer service; however, she was unable to find work within her field of work.\n\nAt a crossroads, she decided to enroll in a program with NPower Canada. The 10-week program allows participants to work towards various certifications while simultaneously introducing them to employers such as Rogers, TD Canada Trust and Alterna Savings.\n\nThe direct impact the program will have on Arogundade’s job search is yet to be seen, but nonetheless she is content with the training and the Canadian experience she will receive.\n\nMentorship Programs\n\nFor other newcomers, survival jobs become a primary option because of friends and family members they may have, which have already gone down those paths. In an attempt to break this cycle, (The Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council) implemented a program that connects individuals with volunteer mentors in a range of careers.\n\n“Immigrants often think that when they come, they have to get a survival job, like drive a taxi,” explains Daniel Kim of TRIEC. “But our whole organization’s mandate is to help those immigrants who come with skills and expertise, and to connect them to businesses who want that talent.”\n\nKim who is a Communications and Media Relations specialist with TRIEC, states that over 75% of the individuals enrolled in TRIEC Mentoring Partnership are able to find work within their field.\n\nAn astounding success rate that seemingly speaks to many of the studies that assert the benefits of mentor-mentee programs. While these relationships allow proteges to further develop their subject knowledge, it also helps facilitate more extensive professional networks. In addition, immigrants are able to practice soft skills which could benefit them immensely once they are within the workforce. The issue of ‘Canadian experience’ extends past the necessary technical skills for many employers. A lot of whom, worry about the soft skills newcomers may have, such as conflict resolution, workplace communication and fitting in with the team.\n\nProfessional Immigrant Networks\n\nTRIEC also provides an opportunity for immigrants to join networks specific to their profession and ethnicity.\n\nPINs (Professional Immigrant Networks) are comprised of a range of occupations and ethnic backgrounds, from the Philippine Teachers Association Canada to the Association des femmes maroco-canadiennes (Association of Female Moroccan-Canadians).\n\nMany of these networks were actually started by immigrants themselves.\n\nUpon emigrating from the United Kingdom, Jenny Okonkwo felt isolated without a group that she could relate to. “Basically, what happened was that I didn’t know any Black female accountants,” she says. “If you don’t immediately have that small circle to call on, that just shows how big the gap is.”\n\nIn 2016, Okonkwo started BFAN (the Black Female Accountants Network), and soon after, her network joined PINs. Today, BFAN has grown to 600 members nationwide and works in partnership with CPA Ontario (Chartered Professional Accountants). Their mandate is to encourage female accountants of African descent to network, share knowledge, and advance themselves in accounting.\n\n“BFAN provides résumé reviews, career advice, development of soft skills, networking opportunities, and more— and all for free to the Afro-Caribbean diaspora in Canada,” said Okonkwo. While they don’t provide job matches, their members, ranging from executives to university students, are dedicated to helping others develop professional skills.\n\nTheir members have already published articles, presented on public stages, and created study groups to help one another pass their CPA exams.\n\n“The value comes from saying to a newcomer, ‘I’ve already walked this path. I’ve walked it two, five, fifteen years ago, and here’s how I did it,’” said Okonkwo. “And they come out feeling like they’ve made the right decision about the progression of their career in Canada.”\n\nTRIEC’s PINs and Mentoring Partnership program as well as NPower Canada’s employment training programs are only a few of the unique opportunities available to newcomers. While these free initiatives can help many immigrants overcome the innumerable barriers they will be faced with, they will only be effective if these skilled individuals are aware of what is available to them. Only time will tell how Ontario will ensure these resources are being utilized.\n\nThis article was originally published in New Canadian Media on March 17, 2018.\n\nFrom October 25th to 29th, the 14th annual Filipina Leadership Global Summit will be held in Toronto.\n\nOrganized by the San Francisco-based Filipina Women’s Network (FWN), the event is more than a celebration of the world’s 100 most influential Filipina leaders— it is an opportunity to bring free coding and mentorship opportunities to Toronto.\n\n“We don’t want to just come in and leave,” said founder and CEO Marily Mondejar. “We want to give back to the community that hosts us.”\n\nMusical Coding by Music Notes\n\nFacilitators from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory will be teaching Filipinas aged 9-12 a lesson in coding with an artistic twist.\n\n“Because we want to focus on STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) instead of just STEM, we want the girls to learn coding through hip-hop,” said Mondejar.\n\n“At the end of the day, they will be able to modify or code a song that they will present at graduation.”\n\nAlthough the cost is $100 USD per child, the FWN is offering the workshop for free to 50 girls.\n\n“We want them to apply soon so we can give them the scholarship,” said Mondejar. “The research we’ve seen says that it’s the most neglected age group.”\n\n“All of the experts are flying in on their own money. This group, Music Notes, their mission is to teach coding to young girls. They’re investing in this. We need to find the girls.”\n\nParticipants must bring their own smartphone and laptop with Windows 8 or 10. The program will be on October 25th from 8:00-5:30 at the InterContinental Toronto Centre.\n\nWonder-Full Adventures with Robots: Dash and Dot\n\nTeams from ten GTA high schools can apply to send two to four Filipina teens and one adult to learn coding with Wonder Workshop's award-winning robots, Dash and Dot.\n\nAfter the workshop, teams can bring a robot back to their high schools.\n\nAlthough the cost is $500 USD per person, the FWN is offering this workshop for free.\n\nSuccessful teams who apply will be notified by October 15th. Team members must bring their own tablet and smartphone (contact FWN for brand specifications). The program will be October 25th, from 8:00-5:30 at the InterContinental Toronto Centre.\n\nPower MeetUp With Amazing Filipina and Canadian Women\n\nFWN members will meet Filipina and Canadian professionals at this free social networking event with a focus on women in international trade.\n\n“We want to seat them in groups of five for a more intimate gathering,” said Mondejar. “As a ‘No Host’ event, this will be an informal evening for us to meet local women.”\n\nThe Power MeetUp will take place on October 25 at 6:00pm at the Marché in Brookfield Place. Hors d’oeuvres will be provided, and participants must pre-register online.\n\nPinay Speed FEMtoring with Global FWN100™ Awardees\n\nFEMtors are female mentors who have received the Global FWN100™ award for outstanding Filipina leadership.\n\n“Awardees must join the FWN, attend the summit, pay their own way, and give back by advising mentees,” said Mondejar. “It’s a working award.”\n\nThis mentoring event is geared towards new professionals with only one to five years of experience in any profession.\n\n“We want to connect Filipina doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs, people in the military, and more,” said Mondejar.\n\nLast year, the summit was at the University of Cebu.\n\n“We opened FEMtoring to students, but the president of the university said that the professors requested the session be for them, too. They were teachers, doctors, lawyers. They actually closed the school for the day— they were so interested.”\n\nThe event will take place on October 28 at 3:15 at the InterContinental Toronto Centre. Participants must fill out an application under the “Engage” tab on the FWN summit homepage.\n\nNominations Still Open: The 100 Most Influential Filipina Women in the World\n\nThe FWN is still seeking Global FWN100™ nominations for Filipina-Canadian leaders.\n\nNominees must be a “#FilipinaDisrupter”— someone who is “fearless, purpose-driven, and socially conscious” in any economic sector.\n\n“Our goal is to have a Filipina woman leader in every sector of the economy by 2020,” said Mondejar.\n\nCanadian nominations must be received as soon as possible.\n\n“She has to be vetted and interviewed for approval,” said Mondejar. “Then there’s another process for featuring her on FWN Magazine and ordering her award, if approved.”\n\n“There are currently eight Canadian awardees, and we’d like to increase that eight.”\n\n—\n\nMondejar hopes that this summit will connect more Filipina leaders worldwide.\n\n“When someone says, ‘I’m the first,’ my question is, ‘Who did you bring along? Who will be next?’ You’ll always be first, but I’m sure there’s another influential Filipina in your area.”\n\n“This is the culture of FWN,” said Mondejar. “They’re not just coming to get an award. It’s a working award. We say, ‘You need to give back.’”\n\nParticipants must pre-register online for all events.

I can’t just think of myself. I have to think of everyone else and be an older brother to all of the youth. Now they think of me as everyone’s kuya.”\n\nIn the closing workshop, Batac led the students through an exercise called “Touch Somebody.” Everyone sat in a circle with their eyes closed, and Batac selected individuals to stand in the middle. “Touch someone who is able to accomplish anything,” she said. “Touch someone who has given you good advice… Touch someone who made an impact on your life.”\n\nThe students touched the shoulders of their peers, and soon, the sound of sniffles filled the room.\n\nAt the end of the exercise, Batac asked, “How do you feel?” And after the initial nervous laughter at everyone seeing each other with red eyes, the group responded with powerful words: “Thankful,” “Important,” “Respected,” “Noticed,” “Loved.”\n\nMentee Joy Siscar was especially touched. After being in Canada for only a year and a half, she felt lonely without her extended family.\n\n“I thought that coming to Canada, my family would only be just us six,” she said. “But KAMP taught me that family doesn’t have to be blood-related, but it can be the people who support you. I never expected people to appreciate the small things that I do.”\n\nAnd the newfound connections inspired mentor Sol Diana to perform an original poem: “i see my ancestors / and i have so much to tell them / like look where we are! / look what we've done to get here / look what we've done to honour your legacy / you fought for this / you fought for me and for that i'm grateful / i'm grateful / for the home that i've found.”\n\n“Who’s afraid of Americans?” he asked. “People come to Cuba to ride in old American cars, to see old American Art Deco architecture. They drink in the bars where Hemingway went. Even Cuba Libre is made out of Cuban rum and Coca-Cola. I’m not scared of Cuba changing. Actually, I’m scared of it not changing.”\n\nBut as Cubans look towards the future, many tourists only seek out the past.\n\nThey prize the time-warp atmosphere of Havana -- a land without wifi, without consumerism, without mass commercialization. But tourists must realize that longing for nostalgia means that they are against the change that so many Cubans want.\n\nWith two million tourists visiting every year -- mostly Europeans and Canadians -- the country certainly hadn’t been cut off from the outside world before Americans arrived. What they had been cut off from is the version of Cuba that only tourists could afford.\n\n“No industry pays people what they need to live,” Yildo said. “The average Cuban makes the equivalent of $18 USD a month. So of course they have to do something on the side.”\n\nHe pointed out dozens of ways for Habaneros to make money from side businesses. From selling everything from eggs to concrete on the black market, to turning their private cars into taxis, to converting their dining rooms into restaurants, to putting their homes for rent on Airbnb, Habaneros were embracing opportunities to capitalize on tourism.\n\nI thought of the American tour guide.\n\n“But what if tourism goes too far?” I asked. “Could developers come and demolish the old family homes of Centro Habana and Habana Vieja and turn them into condos and hotels?”\n\n“There’s a housing shortage, so where would they put the people?” Yildo replied. “The only thing that will happen is that they’ll make enough money to fix their roofs. And maybe put on a new coat of paint.”\n\nSangiorgio said that the other option would be to build a new school on St. Margaret’s original site.\n\nDue to the school’s meagre two-acre lot, the proposed designs include an underground parking lot so that students could retain their schoolyard.\n\nIf the underground parking lot is approved by the Ministry of Education, then an application will go to the City of Toronto.\n\n“Best case scenario, it’ll be three years to completion. But it’s all dependent on the response from the Ministry,” said Sangiorgio.\n\nTrustee Maria Rizzo wishes that the provincial government had prioritized St. Margaret long ago.\n\n“They’ve passed St. Margaret over and over and over again,” said Rizzo.\n\n“In terms of the Filipino community, St. Paschal Baylon, St. Antoine Daniel, Our Lady of Assumption, and St. Margaret— they’re all sort of on the same Bathurst strip. And there’s not a dime for any of them.”\n\nWith government funds bypassing schools in Filipino areas, “some members of the community feel that there is some racism going on,” said Rizzo.\n\n“It’s not blatant racism, it’s systemic. To some degree, it’s my fear that it’s because these parents are not as politically active as the people on the east side of Avenue Road.”"
