        "text": "RAYMONDVILLE â€“ Police arrested two people in connection with the prostitution and sexual assault of a child in Raymondville.\n\nMonica Garcia, 30, is charged with compelling prostitution, trafficking of persons for sexual exploitation and sexual assault of a child. Raul Arevalo Jr., 77, is charged with sexual assault of a child.\n\nAuthorities said their arrest could lead to a larger human trafficking problem.\n\nPolice said an undocumented teen reported the assault last week. Raymondville Police Department detective Denise Ledesma said the minor told officers she was forced to have sex for money.\n\nThe investigation led authorities to Garcia and Arevalo. But Ledesma said there could be more victims in this case.\n\n\"We just want all victims, if there are any victims. It has been brought to our attention that there might be several, but they're afraid to come forward because of their status,\" she said. \"That is not something we're looking for into. We just want to go ahead and help each victim out.\"\n\nThe detective said the department is short-handed to handle the case. It's the reason why they asked the FBI to step in.\n\nFBI spokesperson Michelle Lee told CHANNEL 5 NEWS they're prepared to assist Raymondville police.\n\nGarcia and Arevalo are being held on a $130,000 bond and $50,000 bond, respectively.\n\nAnyone with information on the case can call Raymondville police at 956-689-2441."
