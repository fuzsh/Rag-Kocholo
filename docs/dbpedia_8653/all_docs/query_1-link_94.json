        "text": "The only thing worse than a bad film is a disappointing one. Nothing stings quite like a film failing to deliver on its premise, especially if that premise shows promise. Spanish director Daniel Calparsoro’s thriller, The Warning (El Aviso), an adaptation of the novel by Paul Pen, is capably assembled but doesn’t fulfill its own potential, betraying glimpses of a richer story than the one we actually get. For genre fans, a decent mystery complete with twists that sustain the intrigue may be enough to satisfy. I ultimately found the movie frustrating. Calparsoro leaves space so the audience has the opportunity to fill in the gaps; the price is an end more perplexing than the beginning.\n\nIt opens with Jon (Raúl Arévalo) and his best friend, David (Sergio Mur) stopping by a convenience store one night, right after David tells Jon he’s going to propose to his girlfriend, Andrea (Belén Cuesta). David’s left in a coma after a gunman attacks the store. Soon, Jon starts finding evidence not only that the attack was planned, but that it is part of a pattern of attacks. The camera subtly glides over Jon’s mathematics awards, revealing he has a genius-intellect. But the white pill bottle he owns alludes to his mental health issues, inviting the audience to question the truth of every revelation.\n\nIn a parallel storyline ten years later, we meet a young nine-year-old boy named Nico (Hugo Arbues) who’s dealing with bullies. They force him to steal a porno magazine from the same 24-hour store, where the incident is now recounted like a ghost story. There Nico finds a note stating he must not return to the store on his tenth birthday or else he will die. His mother, Lucía (Aura Garrido) dismisses it as harassment from his tormenters, but the shopkeeper, Héctor (Antonio Dechent), hints it might be a warning. He was present during the incident, so he looks mournfully at Nico, like he wants to spare him from an unavoidable evil.\n\nCalparsoro plays with ideas of destiny throughout the film. As Jon uncovers more clues to the case, he grows more determined to unravel the grand design. Arévalo plays Jon with a wide-eyed, disheveled desperation that never lets up. The mystery becomes Jon’s mission, not just an assignment but a call to action that he alone can answer. While he obsesses, he isolates himself from Andrea and spirals deeper into his own mind. At the end, he realizes his place in the convoluted scheme, a moment, as Julio de la Rosa’s soundtrack swells, that comes across as self-satisfied because the logic behind it is never fully explained.\n\nMeanwhile, Nico is trying to choose his own path as various forces impose their will. Lucía, who has a restraining order on Nico’s father, wants Nico to not submit to his fears as she says she did in the past. His bullies always lurk on the wings. Then there are the note and the store that loom over him and the film, the atmospheric music helping build that haunted quality. Nico seems fated to confront the violence, his childhood innocence up against enigmatic terror. He and Jon are compelling lead characters, powering the film.\n\nThe plot, however, is not nearly as compelling. The mathematical pattern is not very complex, just a recurring sequence of numbers that link several crimes throughout history. It renders Jon being a mathematician irrelevant, as all he does is standard investigative work. At one point during Jon’s research, the Basque separatist organization Euskadi Ta Askatasuna is connected with another crime in the pattern, but it’s never mentioned again and thus feels like a name-dropped add-on. No deeper reason behind the crimes is ever made clear. That could be a purposeful choice to leave some parts for the audience to interpret, but without these details the entire story feels pointless. Jon’s schizophrenia gets trivialized, made into a plot device so Calparsoro could include some hallucinatory shots of larvae crawling over newspaper clippings and moths flying overhead. The mathematical sequence, paranoia and destiny are all interesting thematic components that Calparsoro fails to coherently blend, resulting in a narrative that’s both simplistic and confusing.\n\nIt’s hard to say definitively whether the movie’s strengths outweigh its weaknesses. For me, they don’t. If anything, the weaknesses take away from the strengths, draining them of impact because my attention was often on the many flaws. Though entertaining, the film leaves much to be desired. Perhaps Calparsoro was aiming to achieve a sort of minimalism, but in this case, less isn’t more."
