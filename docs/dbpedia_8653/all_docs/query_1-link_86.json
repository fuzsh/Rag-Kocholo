        "text": "Arevalo scores perfect in ACT science test, says TAG program helped light his world\n\nBY DOLORES CULLEN\n\nCongratulations to Storm Lake High School graduating senior Raul Arevalo, who will be a freshman next year at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Md.\n\nRaul and his family came to the US from a small town named Portezuelo, in Jalisco, Mexico, when he was eight-years-old. Relatives had jobs in Storm Lake and the Arevalos joined them.\n\nRaul entered the Storm Lake school’s ELL program because he spoke no English. He was able to test out of it in fourth grade though.\n\nHe says math and science were always his strengths. In fact he had a perfect ACT score (36) in science and a 32 in math.\n\nHe plans to study biophysics at Johns Hopkins, the famous private research institution, and possibly double-major in molecular engineering.\n\nHe applied to the school in December and was pleased to be accepted. Online statistics indicate a 13% acceptance rate, but also an average cost after aid of $34,000 a year.\n\nScholarships and aid for Raul will have him paying $9,000. He hasn’t visited the university yet. “We don’t have the resources,” he said. His mother Maura works at Tyson and his dad Antonio at VT Industries.\n\nRaul’s brother, Antonio, will be a senior at SLHS next year and his little sister Arely is four-years-old.\n\nRaul said his experience in the Storm Lake Middle School’s TAG program opened his eyes to many new interests. He’s soft-spoken by nature, but his statements belie a passion for study. “I like all kinds of learning. I love biology and I am fascinated by the way life behaves the way it does. I want to improve the functioning of the human body.”\n\nHe reads constantly and described an article about a doctor who attempts to grow organs starting with skin cells that transform into stem cells. Over the last two months, with school called off, he’s been reading e-books and material published by research universities.\n\nHe mentions Ebola research at Johns Hopkins. He said his interest in research was probably a major factor in his admittance.\n\nIn preparation for his first semester at Johns Hopkins, he participated in a Zoom open house in early May where he was the only class member from the Midwest. Others were from China, India, Korea and other parts of the US."
