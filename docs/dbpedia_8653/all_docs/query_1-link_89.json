        "text": "Daniel Sánchez Arévalo, the loved director\n\nSpanish cinema is moving. Last month, Daniel Sánchez Arévalo, director and scriptwriter of movies like “Dark blue almost Black” (“AzulOscuroCasiNegro”) visited DC to present “Cousinhood” (“Primos”) at the Filmest DC.\n\nHe really knows the States. He started his career as a director after being awarded with a Fulbright scholarship to do his masters at Columbia University (New York). Here, he started to write his directorial debut in English, “Dark blue almost Black”. He even thought about filming it in Manhattan or Queens. But a budget is a budget and, eventually, Madrid as his film loaction was the easiest way.\n\nSánchez Arévalo, who wrote the Spanish series like “Farmacia de Guardia” “Hospital Central” and “Querido maestro”, is working on a couple of projects of programs to be filmed in English and run here in the States, “Where you can now find the talent, where things go much more slowly than in Spain and in a completely different rhythm “. He loves American series like “Homeland” and \"Mad men”: “They are incredible, they have a level we can’t even smell in Spain and the reason, of course is money”\n\nHis new film will be a comedy about the family to “vindicate cinema as an entertainment art and more so in times of crisis, when people need more of a distraction.“ he will still work with his favorite actors like, Quim Gutiérrez, Raúl Arévalo and Antonio de la Torre, because “they are still the best ones I can find”.If he could film in the States perhaps he would choose Naomi Watts, Reese Witherspoon or Philip Seymour Hoffman, some of his favorites stars. But surely his loved befriend actors would also have to roll in it.\n\nWhat do we have to import from the cinema in the US? ”A more global vision and the way the Americans sell their cinema\".\n\nDo American public understand your sense of humor? Because they laughed quite a lot during the screening… “Yes, Outside of Spain there are a lot less prejudices at watching our films, and a lot more respect also” he stressed.\n\nIn “Cousinhood” there is a scene where one of the actors say to the other “I almost love you” (te “prequiero” in Spanish), a sentence that originated in a real experience he once had. After the screening, in the discussion, one of the girls in the public confessed to him “DanieI, I almost love you” and the whole audience laughed and agreed."
