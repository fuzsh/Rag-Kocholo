Synopsis: Madrid, August 2007. Curro is the only one arrested for the robbery of a jewellery store. Eight years later, his girlfriend Ana and their son are waiting for Curro to get out of prison. Jose is a solitary and reserved man who just does not seem to fit in anywhere. One morning he goes for a coffee at the bar where Ana and her brother work. That winter his life gets interwoven with the others’ at the bar, who take him in as one of their own. This is especially the case with Ana, who sees this newcomer as an outlet for her distressing life. Having done his time, Curro gets out with the hope of starting his life with Ana over again. But everything has changed in just a very short time. (Source: Venice Film Festival).

Spanish title: Tarde para la ira IMDb Rating: 7.5\n\nLast week, Begoña and I had the opportunity to see the directorial debut of Spanish actor Raúl Arévalo. To be honest for some time I had not been in a cinema theatre. And not precisely because I don’t enjoy going to the cinema, but due to the fact that I couldn’t find a film of my taste. I should add that I have enjoyed this film quite enough, but I would rather leave it to others the review of this film. Judge for yourselves.\n\nRaúl Arévalo was born in Spain. He starred in DarkBlueAlmostBlack (06), Even the Rain (10), and Ghost Graduation (12), all of which screened at the Festival, and Marshland (14). The Fury of a Patient Man (16) is his directorial debut. (Source: TIFF). Keep reading here. An interview with Raúl Arévalo is here.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter: Spanish actor Raul Arevalo makes his feature debut with this gritty score-settling thriller, playing at Venice and Toronto. Every so often, Spanish cinema throws up a grungy, beautifully compact thriller that is indeed authentically Spanish, rather than an imitation of U.S. models. Examples are Jorge Sanchez-Cabezudo’s The Night of the Sunflowers and Patxi Amezcua’s 25 Carat; more recently, there’s the work of Alberto Rodriguez. To this august but undervalued pantheon can now be added Raul Arevalo’s The Fury of a Patient Man, a broodingly intense revenge thriller that reflects the fine, broodingly intense performance driving it relentlessly forward. Wisely choosing a familiar milieu for his first film — it’s set largely in a working-class barrio of Madrid, returning to Arevalo’s childhood pueblo for later scenes — Patient Man is a candidate for Spain’s best thriller of the year, its mounting tension sometimes so visceral as to ensure that it will not quickly be forgotten. Offshore pickups beyond Spanish-speaking territories look likely, and would be deserved. (Keep reading here).\n\nCine Europa: The directorial debut of actor Raul Arévalo is a wild, bold, harsh and resolutely arthouse film, shot with a confidence and intensity that are surprising for a debut feature. (Keep reading here).\n\nVariety: A jolting opening segues into a scattered, slightly confusing beginning, but Spanish actor-turned-director Raúl Arévalo quickly brings his deeply impressive debut under control, reining in the narrative with a hand that betrays almost none of a neophyte’s unsteadiness. It’s a taut little story of devolving nastiness, uncompromising in its relentless, western-influenced linearity, and yet Arévalo still finds time for the most elusive attribute in the familiar territory of the lean revenge thriller: surprise. The bait-and-switch structure, by which the hesitant, complicated, real-world romance of the first half is revealed to have much darker and knottier import in the second, makes the film, which Arévalo co-wrote with David Pulido, a singular dish, best served cold. (Keep reading here).\n\nScreen Daily: Versatile Goya Award-winning actor Raúl Arévalo (I’m So Excited, Marshland) applies the same resourcefulness to his directorial debut, co-written with fellow first-timer David Pulido. The vengeance-laden The Fury of a Patient Man progresses from gritty, naturalistic beginnings to become a poised, polished thriller. The end result might not shy away from its western leanings, yet it doesn’t meekly adhere to convention either. (Keep reading here)."
