        "text": "Some successes\n\nSome challenges: the water problem\n\nA brief assessment of bilateral relations between Spain and Morocco\n\nIf we were to define these 25 years of reign, they would undoubtedly be characterised by years of stability and development.\n\nSome successes\n\nIn this regard, I would like to highlight some milestones that have marked this important period in the history of the new Morocco: from the Mudawana, the Family Code that has granted advanced rights to women, Morocco being a pioneer in the elimination of male guardianship over women, promoting their equality and autonomy and including the Equity and Reconciliation Instance, known by its acronym IER. It is also important to remember the June 2011 proposal for a new Constitution, which would replace the previous one of 1996, and which was submitted to a referendum on 1 July of the same year with a support of over 97% of voters and came into force on 16 July of the same year. A Constitution that guarantees human rights and gender equality. In short, numerous political and institutional reforms to modernise society, the administration and the different branches of government.\n\nOther examples that could be highlighted include a migration policy that stands out in the Arab world and its return to the continent on 30 January 2017 with its readmission to the African Union after 32 years of voluntary cessation of its membership in the organisation, recognising the uselessness of the \"empty chair\" policy. At least 39 of the 54 countries that make up the African Union supported Morocco's return to the most important pan-African integration and cooperation organisation. This decision to apply for readmission to the African continental organisation was a personal endeavour of Mohammed VI, who personally led an intensive diplomatic campaign with numerous visits to sub-Saharan African countries. Moreover, the Kingdom of Morocco has intensified its economic and commercial activities throughout the African continent during the reign of the Alaouite monarch, especially in French-speaking and West African countries. It should not be forgotten that Morocco is currently the second largest African investor in Africa after South Africa. Today, Morocco's presence in the banking sector, telecommunications companies, insurance companies and airlines is constantly expanding. Morocco is also trying to gain more religious influence from sub-Saharan imams and ulema by training them in Moroccan Islamic schools. In this way, Morocco also manages to preserve its country from the influence of Islamist organisations that might be born or develop their activities in its southern neighbours, whose institutional structures are weaker. A Moroccan contribution to regional security and peace.\n\nA new Morocco that through the National Human Development Initiative (INDH) launched in May 2005, the country has made a real effort to promote solidarity and social justice as pillars of the nation. Numerous economic and development projects and social programmes are aimed at social cohesion through citizens' access to basic services.\n\nOn the other hand, it is also worth highlighting the investment effort that has been made over the years, making Morocco's infrastructures the most advanced, but at the same time committed to sustainable development. A Morocco open to the world that seeks a commitment to peace and global dialogue and builds bridges between cultures.\n\nAn ambitious transformational project led by H.M. King Mohammed VI has been carried out, preserving the achievements of the past in order to win the future with all its people. A country that is modern in the face of the demands of our times and that draws inspiration from its age-old traditions and values, which make Morocco one of the oldest nation-states in the world.\n\nSome challenges: the water problem\n\nKing Mohammed VI himself pointed out some of the challenges facing the nation, among which he highlighted as most important the water problem caused by six consecutive years of drought, climate change and the natural increase in demand. This has had an impact on water reserves and aquifers, especially in rural areas of the country. In this regard, Morocco continues to work on better implementation of the National Drinking Water Supply and Irrigation Programme 2020-2027 and an innovative policy.\n\nThis plan aims to guarantee drinking water to all citizens and to provide at least 80% of the national territory with irrigation water. The Alawi monarch also acknowledged the delay in the implementation of some water projects, such as the dam construction programme, renewable energy and the inter-basin water transfer from the Wad Lau and Lukus river basins to the Umm Errabia river basin, and Buregreg, as well as accelerating the completion of desalination plants (an example of this is the Casablanca desalination plant, which will be the largest of its kind in Africa and the second largest in the world running 100% on clean energy).\n\nHe also stressed the importance of training Moroccan engineers in the field of desalination and the need to create a national industry in this sector and local companies. This is a problem that we also have in Spain, and which is sometimes the cause of a lack of solidarity between our Autonomous Communities and a consequence of poor coordination by our central government, which turns the water problem into a political problem in Spain. If Morocco is able to complete these projects as part of its water policy, by 2030 it will be able to guarantee half of the country's drinking water needs and irrigate large agricultural areas, which will contribute to strengthening food security. Spain can also be a good example in the use of water resources through drip irrigation, where we are an example for other countries in the world.\n\nA brief assessment of bilateral relations between Spain and Morocco\n\nIf we take stock of this quarter of a century of bilateral relations between the Kingdoms of Morocco and Spain, we can affirm that these have been strengthened by the historical and fraternal ties between our two Royal Courts and the friendship that unites H.M. King Mohammed VI and H.M. King Felipe VI.\n\nThe two countries are cooperating in a way that can be described as multi-sectoral, as it covers different levels: firstly, the political level through permanent dialogues of coordination and agreement; secondly, the fight against immigration and legal mafias or human trafficking networks that promote this type of immigration, not only illegal but also in inhumane conditions, where both countries cooperate in an exemplary manner, opting for a regular, orderly and circular migration; and a third dimension that would include the fight against terrorism of any origin, but especially Islamist terrorism; and fourthly, economic cooperation, where Spain has been Morocco's leading trading partner for more than a decade, with trade amounting to almost 20. 20 billion a year. It is also worth noting that more than 20,000 Spanish companies maintain commercial activities with Morocco (around 1,000 of them with a direct presence in the country).\n\nFor Spain, Morocco is the main destination for our exports in Africa and the Arab world, as well as the main investment hub for Spanish companies on the African continent. There are more than 230 air and 538 sea connections between the two countries every week.\n\nIn addition, in 2030 Spain and Morocco will have a special opportunity to strengthen our relations in a special way through sport by means of the joint candidacy of Morocco, Spain and Portugal for the football World Cup. Through this ambitious project that symbolises our friendship and cooperation, and that unites Europe and Africa, our countries will present themselves to the world as great nations that share a common and positive vision to jointly face the great challenges of the 21st century, thus contributing to the prosperity and stability of our region, not only between Spain and Morocco but also between Europe and Africa, where both nations are bridges to our continents.\n\nCarlos Uriarte Sánchez"
