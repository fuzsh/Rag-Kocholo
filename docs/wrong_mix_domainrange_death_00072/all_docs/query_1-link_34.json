        "text": "A Note from Director David Ruttura\n\nBeautiful is a coming-of-age story about one of America’s most celebrated song writers: Carole King. Sure, you know her incredible solo career with albums like “Tapestry,” and songs like “You’ve got a Friend.” But one of the most delightful and surprising parts of Beautiful is discovering how many brilliant and era-defining songs she wrote before you had ever heard of her. These treasures of the American Songbook were written with her first husband, Gerry Goffin – the central relationship of our story.\n\nI won’t give any of the songs away here, though a few page turns will reveal them… if you’re into spoilers. However, those joyous musical discoveries are only part of the story you’re about to see. At its core, Beautiful is about an extraordinarily gifted woman raised in a traditional world, who finds herself in the midst of major societal change: The Women’s Liberation Movement, The Civil Rights Movement, The Sexual Revolution, among many others. Ultimately, the influence of these seismic shifts upends her relationship and forces her to question everything she believes. It’s what leads her to discover what’s most important: self-assurance and the power that comes when you stand up for what is right for you. Carole instinctively defied societal norms to pursue her career as a songwriter in a male dominated field, she just needed to translate that bravery into her relationships.\n\nCarole wisely says in her opening remarks,\n\n“You know what’s so funny about life? Sometimes it goes the way you want and sometimes it doesn’t. And sometimes when it doesn’t, you find something beautiful.”\n\nThe last few years have thrust us into another necessary social justice movement, and as we all work to address these issues, I hope you can find strength in Carole’s story; always stick up for yourself and others, follow your dreams, and make the world a better place for everyone.\n\nIt’s been an honor to recreate Marc Bruni’s definitive Broadway production with Joyce Chittick (Choreographer) and Nick Williams (Music Director) – both veterans of the Broadway company and National tour. It always brings me such joy to dive back into Doug McGrath’s script, which fills the rehearsal room with constant smiles and laughter. We’re proud to bring you a cast full of veterans of the show, as well as welcoming a number of new folks to the family.\n\nBeautiful has delighted audiences on Broadway and across the globe for over 6 years, and I’m thrilled that The Cape Playhouse is the venue for the show’s next life.\n\nShow Summary\n\nThis Tony® and Grammy® Award-winning musical is an inspiring true story of Carole King’s journey from teenage songwriter to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nBefore she was hit-maker Carole King — she was Carole Klein, a spunky, young songwriter from Brooklyn with a unique voice. From the chart-topping hits she wrote for the biggest acts in music with her husband Gerry Goffin to her own life-changing, trailblazing success with her album “Tapestry.”\n\nBeautiful — The Carole King Musical takes you back to where it all began — and takes you on the ride of a lifetime with one of the most successful solo acts in popular music history.\n\nThe musical phenomenon is filled with the songs you remember such as “You’ve Got a Friend,” “One Fine Day,” “So Far Away,” “Take Good Care of My Baby,” “Up on the Roof,” “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling,” “Will You Love Me Tomorrow,” and “Natural Woman.”\n\nOriginally Produced on Broadway by Paul Blake, Sony Music Publishing, and Mike Bosner"
