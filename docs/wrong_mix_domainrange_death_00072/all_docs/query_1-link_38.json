And is there any evidence since when the habit of revering\n\nJizo/sekibutsu in this way exists and where it comes from?\n\nMany thanks in advance for any information on that point\n\nBernhard Scheid\n\nî—“\n\nPlease forgive me as I haven't checked thoroughly through my sources\n\non this, but as I was told the bib was representative of clothing,\n\noffered to Jizo because of his status as a traveller, so that he does\n\nnot get cold upon his journey. I was told that the bib was often\n\ngiven by mothers or parents, as Jizo is supposed to travel down to\n\nHell(s) and back again to rescue the souls of children who have died.\n\nHere is an example of the story from a 14th century copy of \"Jizou\n\nEngi Emaki\" from the Tokyo National Museum. I apologize for the\n\nresolution:\n\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/tatsushu/284661896/in/set-72157600772093455/\n\nIt appears, however, that Jizou's robes may have been red in that\n\ndepiction--though it is only one, I find it an interesting\n\ncoincidence.\n\nRed is, of course, an auspicious color; on stone I have often wondered\n\nif it doesn't provide the fortunate 'ko-haku' aesthetic.\n\nHere are some specific examples:\n\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/tatsushu/277241281/in/set-72157600771340229/\n\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/tatsushu/277241976/in/set-72157600771340229/\n\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/tatsushu/277245321/in/set-72157600771340229/\n\nYou also see the bib on fox statues at Inari shrines, so it does not\n\nappear to be a purely Buddhist or Jizou related custom.\n\nAs to why a bib--I would suggest that it is a simple garment, easily\n\ncreated to fit over a statue which one may not necessarily 'dress'\n\nappropriately. Of some possible linkage is the adornment of Buddhist\n\nimages elsewhere with monks robes, such as in Thailand.\n\nUnfortunately, I could not say how long this practice has been going\n\non, though I've seen scrolls with pictures from the Edo period, at\n\nleast, showing this kind of offering. I'd look to the origins of the\n\nworship of Jizo in Japan and see if that helps. I would also suggest\n\nlooking in another possibly odd place: stories of tanuki. As bakemono\n\nsome of the more 'popular' shapes in stories are as a kettle or Jizo\n\nstatue. While indirect, there may be some help tracking down those\n\ntales and seeing when the Jizo image becomes popular.\n\n-Joshua Badgley\n\nDear list members,\n\na recent question by a student caught me by surprise because it related\n\nto something so familiar that I did no longer realize I didn't know:\n\nJizo's bib and cap.

DEMONS AND DISEASE.\n\nhttp://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/color-red.html\n\nGreetings from Japan! Gruesse aus Japan!\n\nGABI\n\nDaruma Museum Japan\n\nhttp://darumasan.blogspot.com/\n\n.\n\nFelicitations to all,\n\nThanks to Bernhard Sheid for this question, always a fruitful if elusive one.\n\nI was asked the same question recently by a friend on her first trip\n\nto Japan and was once again stymied as to how to reply. I'll try to\n\nbe brief in my response here, but I have lots to say on this issue,\n\nso am glad to see that there is interest.\n\nClearly, all the answers provided thus far are absolutely correct and\n\nno response can exhaust the possibilities. Having been _tricked_ by\n\nJizo (or was it a tanuki?) in the later years of Showa like Edward\n\nMoreno, I have asked some of the the same questions: why a yodarekake\n\nand why red?\n\nJoshua Badgley tentatively suggests Edo-period origins for this\n\npractice, and I'd agree. As Gabi Greve indicates, one common\n\nexplanation is that women (families) used to give the bibs of their\n\ndead children to Jizo and ask him to watch over them in the\n\nSai-no-kawara limbo. I'd say that this belief in Sai no kawara, which\n\noriginated around the turn of the seventeenth century is closely\n\nrelated, as is late medieval belief in the Blood Pool Hell or\n\nKetsubon/Chi no ike. Sawada Mizuho has written about a Qing period\n\ngazetteer entry from Zhejiang in which women who have had children\n\nmake skirts out of red paper and wrap them around a Jizo (Dizang)\n\nimage on the day of Dizang's birthday - 7/30 - when they remove\n\nthese, it is said to expiate the pollution of childbirth. (On the\n\nsame day, there are ceremonies directed at making deposits to King\n\nEmma who provides the soul of the child on loan.) Following from this\n\nlast point, and echoing JJ Josephson's comment about the placenta,\n\nTanaka Takako has noted that in the late medieval story Tengu no\n\ndairi, it is said that Datsueba (the 'clothes stripping hag' of Sanzu\n\nno kawa, sometimes seen as Emma's wife in Japan) lends each\n\nbaby/fetus a 'placenta cloth' or enakin, which must be returned to\n\nher on the fateful day when they meet again.\n\nThe practice of dressing images (especially Jizo images) is also\n\npretty old in Japan. As JJ says, this is no doubt related to the\n\nimportance of the laity donating monastic robes to the sangha. Jizo\n\nis, after all, a monk. As to the wrapping of other sekibutsu, and\n\nalso old discarded grave stones in (often red) bibs and caps, I'd say\n\nthat this is an assimilation to the Jizo cult. I have much more to\n\nsay about this, especially as it relates to the idea of muen botoke\n\n(or the unconnected dead) and dosojin, but here will just note that\n\nin Japan other deities are frequently misidentified (the wrong word\n\nhere if there ever was one) as Jizo. Devotees might call an Amida\n\nimage famous for healing teething pain habuki Jizo, ignoring the\n\niconographical contradictions, or might see a favorite stone image of\n\nKobo daishi as Jizo, his clutched vajra hidden under a think stack of\n\nbibs.\n\nFinally, as is often seen on Mt. Koya, the broken-off finial of a\n\nhokyointo--type grave, placed in the crotch of an ancient tree and\n\ndecorated with a little bib and cap, is certainly a Jizo image to the\n\npilgims who place their one-yen coins in little plastic baskets and\n\nfold their hands in prayer before it.\n\nOK, sorry for the long-winded (and jet-lagged) response. Feel free to\n\nply me for specifics offlist if you are interested.\n\nregards,\n\nHank\n\nHank Glassman\n\nAssoc. Prof. of East Asian Studies\n\nHaverford College\n\nî—“\n\nDear Colleagues,\n\nIn the wonderful array of detail in the discussion on Jizo's bib I\n\nfeel there is some lack of clarity about what counts as a \"meaning\" or\n\nan \"origin\" of something. The first question by Bernhard Scheidt was\n\nquite simple: (from memory) Why does Jizo wear a red bib? What has not\n\nbeen asked in the discussion is \"for whom\" any answer would be an\n\nappropriate one. If you ask people today, then the answer is usually\n\nto do with the identification with the children (of whom the unborn\n\nare in a majority when it comes to death), for whom Jizo cares. Any\n\nconnection with epidemics is rare. But that may have been important\n\nearlier. But there seems to be a tendency to collect up all possible\n\nassociations for bibs and the colour red, and then to regard this\n\nwonderful collection as the answer. But the answer for whom? and when?\n\n- that is what we always have to ask.\n\nA few points on some of the details which have been adduced: Giving\n\nrobes to Buddhist figures has usually been for those who are\n\nordainable (in Theravada Buddhism also the Buddha himself, as the\n\nmodel for his disciples) but not usually for bodhisattvas, who were\n\nalready ordained long long ago.... And robes are not bibs. So even as\n\na remote cause I would discount this theme as not really relevant to\n\nJizo's bib.\n\nAs to red clothing in general, wasn't it considered an appropriate\n\ncolour for the garments of children (and girls) in early Confucianism?\n\nThis would discount both the epidemics and the \"pollution\" theme. By\n\nthe way, references to blood aren't necessarily references to\n\n\"pollution\". There is blood involved in childbirth and in abortions,\n\nbut we must be careful not to jump to the idea that it's a kind of\n\npollution. Pollution isn't a major matter in all contexts equally,\n\nthough important in some. Anway, the \"bib\" doesn't seem the right\n\nplace for blood-related pollution, even though real-life bibs can get\n\nmessy...Often the bibs are not red anyway, and when they are numerous\n\non one Jizo they can vary in colour. This line of thought doesn't\n\nexclude the possibilty of such considerations having influenced the\n\nuse of the colour red at some point, but we should take not to simply\n\nextrapolate it forward as a permanent given.\n\nAs to the red of some torii, whenever I have asked Shinto priests\n\nabout this, I have always been told that it has no particular symbolic\n\nmeaning, and is just the colour of an appropriate preservative paint\n\n(with a history). In the case of Inari shrines the orangy red has\n\nbecome something of a specific trademark, though the red is not\n\nrestricted to them. Nor is there only one kind of red on torii.\n\nSo what's the main residual point? At graves it's customary to leave\n\nstandard things which the dead persons might require, cigarettes,\n\nsake, golf balls, flowers, rice, tea... In so far as Jizo figures are\n\nset up to escort dead children including foetuses, they can take a bib\n\nfor the child in question. Since the figures often stand for the\n\ndeceased infants, or as carers for still living children, the best\n\nplace to put the bib is right around their neck. The donors are\n\neffectively asking Jizo to take care of the children by accepting a\n\nbib for them. This view fits with what people tell you nowadays, with\n\nthe general concept of kuyo, and with the specific connection between\n\nJizo and children.\n\nIn sum, the origins of anything (e.g. the use of the colour red) may\n\nbe more complex, or just other, than the current phenomenon. Thus the\n\nmeanings shift and aren't necessarily cumulative. Unfortunately it's\n\nnot very easy to \"ask\" the people of bygone centuries.\n\nMichael Pye\n\nProfessor of the Study of Religions\n\nUniversity of Marburg, Germany (retired)\n\nVisiting Professor, Otani University, Kyoto, Japan"
