        "text": "It is with a heavy heart that I’m writing this last column for my dad, George Shimizu. In late January Dad was enjoying his Warrior’s game on TV and reached for his favorite orange soda—he fell and broke his hip. The orthopedist that performed his hip replacement said he was like a 60-year-old; the doctor was amazed at how well Dad did. While in the rehab home, he had a few setbacks. His 103-year-old body is too fragile, making it difficult to keep him comfortable.\n\nDad will stay at the rehab home for the remainder of his life, they love him there and call him “Papa.” They’re amazed how he remembers all their names and reads the paper and magazines every day. They take excellent care of Dad and love his sense of humor and hearing his stories.\n\nDad was so proud to attend Dartmouth—those were some of his fondest memories. Even with a hip replacement, he reminded me to send in his annual donation…I think he’s the longest contributor at 81 years! He enjoyed writing the class of ’43 notes and whenever he received the magazine it was the first piece of mail he read! I know he’s been writing about his experiences in World War II—he has an incredible memory and recalls dates, times, places, and people instantly.\n\nDad lived with my husband and me, totally independent until his fall. He needed just three meals a day—and, of course, dessert with lunch and dinner—and spent his days watching sports on TV, reading, and writing letters (on his IBM typewriter, which he preferred to his Mac)!\n\nI want to thank Dartmouth College, as so many people have reached out to Dad (both alumni and students) thanking him for his articles and sharing how they enjoyed reading them—that put a huge smile on his face!\n\nEditor’s Note: Carol shared the following news on May 4: “I have sad news: Dad passed away peacefully early this morning in his sleep.”\n\n—Carol Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nWhile in the Army, I spent four Christmases in uniform. I shared the first two in the last column and share the second two here—though the fourth Christmas was the best of all.\n\nChristmas 1944 I was at the Allied Translators Interpreters Section just outside Brisbane, Australia. One day later, four of us sergeants were ordered to fly to the Philippines as “replacements.” Two of us joined the 8th Army, the other two went on to Luzon. The first three Christmases were easy to take. During wartime, everything is uncertain. There is no light at the end of the tunnel; no one knows what lies ahead. Rumors indicated that October 1, 1945, would be D-Day, the invasion of Japan’s homeland. No outfit could survive that. D-Day Normandy on June 6, 1944, involved 156,000 troops; in comparison, D-Day Japan involved 300,000 U.S. and Allied forces. We were winning the war in the Pacific. The future looked precarious.\n\nThat’s why my fourth Christmas in the Army will always be my favorite. Our 8th Army comprised the 24th, 41st, and 93rd divisions. Our convoy landed on Mindanao in the southern Philippines in mid-February 1945. We were the lucky ones. After two weeks of heavy fighting, the enemy soldiers disappeared into the higher mountains. A month later we went by Landing Craft Infantry to the beaches south of Davao. We began staging for the invasion of Japan. Then on August 15, 1945, Armed Forces Radio blared out, “Japan surrenders—war’s over!” There was not a dry eye in the outfit! Even the grumpiest fellows gave up a wry smile. And thanks to Little Boy and Fat Man—those two atomic bombs did it!—every one of us slept soundly. What a relief; no more worries. Then, in early September, I got sick and the 24th Division Hospital sent me by hospital plane to a huge Army General Hospital on Leyte Gulf. I was in the intensive care unit for 105 consecutive days. In December I was discharged from the hospital and returned to my old outfit. All my buddies had left for home. I went to the Replacement Depot and MS President Monroe glided into the harbor. Four thousand happy GIs boarded and that afternoon the Monroe set sail for San Francisco and home. Christmas 1945 was spent on the high seas. What a great bunch of guys.\n\nOne fellow said, “I’m a farmer. I went through basic training at Fort Ord. I was born in Idaho but plan to move to California.” Another chimed in, “I’m from Oklahoma and a really good truck mechanic. I want to work at a new car dealership. My family is looking forward to life in California.” It seems to me that California is truly the Golden State. My best buddy, Sam from Jersey, readily agreed when I said, “Let’s count our blessings!”\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nA fond merry Christmas and a happy and healthy New Year to one and all! Christmas has always been my favorite holiday. People care, people share. It is better to give than to receive. And it’s the best time for families to get together. It is time to count one’s blessings. But World War II changed all that. While in the Army, I spent four Christmases in uniform—and the fourth Christmas was the best of all.\n\nOn December 12, 1942, 400 of us graduated in Thayer Hall. We started with 651 frosh. It was a subdued and teary occasion. We were losing on all fronts. President Hopkins and Arthur Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times, gave inspiring words. We lost 23 classmates during World War II. They are on the College’s Military Service Hall of Fame in the Hopkins Center. They will be forever young. We graduated without fanfare, no families, no friends. Would we see each other ever again? At class reunions? It was wartime. More than 100 classmates headed for Notre Dame and became 90-day ensigns. On December 15, 1942, I enlisted and became Pvt. George T. Shimizu, ASN 1715XXXX for the duration plus six months. I was 22 years old. The commandant, who had recruited me in April, and I went back a long way. When I was a senior at the American School in Japan, his daughter was in the third grade. He was a military attaché at the U.S. embassy at that time.\n\nChristmases ’42 and ’43 were spent on post. In 1943, Mary had told me, “Eat dinner on post and come later to the Schankes for dessert,” so I did. Mary had arrived from Heart Mountain (Wyoming) Relocation Center, and we married on April 2, 1943. We were one of the first couples to marry at Camp Savage. In June, 250 of us entrained to Camp Shelby, Mississippi, to undergo a basic, 90-day training course with the newly formed 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Six of us qualified as “expert” with the M1 Garand rifle. Upon our return to Camp Savage, there were weddings and receptions galore. After graduation, we would learn our next destination: Hawaii, China, Burma, India, or Australia. Graduation day in November 1943 was an eye-opener. If you were a Nisei linguist, you became a sergeant. If you were a Caucasian taking the same course, you became a second lieutenant. Some of the older, highly skilled Nisei complained, but to no avail. The Army had its way and the Army kept it that way.\n\nNext issue I’ll share those third and fourth Christmases.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nJune 24 dawned dark and overcast with a brisk breeze, cold. It was Saturday—my 103rd birthday! I never believed I would make this date. People would later tell me that very few persons reach this age. I am cautiously living on borrowed time. I moved to Milpitas, California, on March 4, 2020. Living with children Carol and Tommy gives me a nice sense of security and well-being. And I received more than 150 “Happy Birthday” greetings. I appreciate all those cards, with comments such as “Amazing,” “Inspiring,” “You’re the first 103-year-old I know,” and “Thank you for your service.” I stopped driving at 99 and have played no golf since 2019. I know I’m slowing down. In the past three months I’ve felt weaker and weaker. I rarely leave the house nowadays and lead a very quiet and lethargic life. It takes me all morning to read the daily newspaper (San Jose Mercury News), then the afternoon mail arrives, and lo and behold it is time for dinner before you know it. After chow, it’s time for the Giants, 49ers, Warriors, and lights out. My favorite TV show is Blue Bloods on Friday night. A VIP in my life wrote: “We are looking forward to celebrating your 104th next year!” Well, thank you and we’ll see. Life is good.\n\nMany thanks for all those wonderful 103rd birthday cards. About a dozen of them were from alumni relations and the Ripley ’29 Society. The class of ’79 chipped in with about 20 greetings. I thank everyone for their kind, heart-warming words. And receiving coveted congratulations from the White House was a pleasant surprise.\n\nIt appears there will be zero attendees for our 80th class reunion in September. My travel days are over. I was lucky enough to make our 55th, 60th, and 70th reunions. I remember Ed Bock and Bob Lappin arriving in Hanover for our 75th. They set a record for class with the lowest attendance. I recently received a roster of living ’43s. There are 15 of us left out of the original 651 frosh, who, for the first time, trod on the Big Green and had all meals in Freshman Commons in 1939. Nobu Mitsui and I were in 109 Middle Mass. Do you recall your room number?\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nA huge wah-hoo-wah to Sian Beilock. With her inauguration September 22, she will become the 19th president of Dartmouth College, successor to Phil Hanlon ’77. She will be the first female president in our College’s 254-year history. At age 47, she will also be the youngest president in the Ivy League. Sian was born and raised in Berkeley, California, and graduated from UC Berkeley, a well-known, cosmopolitan area. What a great merging of the East Coast and West Coast. Soon to be a teenager, daughter Sarah will take over Hanover’s townsfolk and the student body as the Neidlinger sisters did 80 years ago. Plus, the newest dog in town will be the First Family’s pooch, named Rosie. I applaud the College’s selection of Beilock as the right person for the right position in the right time and right place. Our warmest welcome to all!\n\nHey, what’s going on in this world? A guy in DAM wants to write about dogs without being hounded. Dog lovers in Hanover will unite for dog-ville. As a kid growing up on a farm on the outskirts of Long Beach, California, I always had a dog. It was always a big German shepherd police dog and always named Jackie. And our wonderful dog was bilingual. He understood both Japanese and English. And Jackie loved rice over tofu, dry onions, and hamburgers with shoyu and mirin. When we moved to Los Angeles in late 1933, Jackie came with us. Then, in August 1935, our family boarded a steamship liner and moved to Tokyo; Jackie was with us. Gads, the four-legged mutts took only 16 pages and the cover out of the 90 pages of the March/April DAM. Nobody was dogging it. Let the poodles still stop traffic on Main Street.\n\nIt’s a doggone shame that two alums wrote in—a fellow from a mid ’50s class stated DAM needs “…a different editor” and a second reader wanted the magazine to write about more important events worldwide and not “bury its head in the sand.” I disagree. Dog-lovers in Hanover have a strong case. But in my experience, men love dogs and women love cats (and canaries). There are far more widows than widowers, and the cat-lovers will outvote us in every way. We can’t win. We dog-lovers will lose this dogfight—and some are already in the doghouse. I doggedly fear there is no end to it—and let’s be clear: Dartmouth is definitely not going to the dogs! It’s getting late. I’ll go now, as at 103, I’m dog-tired. Bye bye (arf arf).\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nIt is still true: Since five-score years ago, America is still the melting pot of the world. Everyone everywhere wanted to come to the United States of America! And the Statue of Liberty, bearing a torch aloft in New York harbor, beckons with open arms in a warm welcome to the land of the free and the home of the brave.\n\nIn all those years, we became a nation of immigrants. My friend John W. Cusick ’57, class secretary, discussed the “roots” of some of the ’57 family. It was of great interest to me as I thought of my mom and dad and their pioneer spirits. At the age of 20, on his own, Dad went to Hawaii and worked in the sugarcane fields and pineapple plantations. He also learned pidgin English! When he returned to Japan, my parents got married—and both decided their next trip would be to America, especially California. As a kid, during family dinners, Dad would smile and reminisce, “WE didn’t want to grow rice all our lives in that hamlet in Hiroshima.” Sao Paulo, in Brazil, was the destination for thousands of Japanese. My mom and dad arrived in San Francisco. Their dream came true. It was year 1908.\n\nIt took them more than two months to reach Los Angeles. My folks would stay with farmer friends who lived near dirt roads that would later become U.S. Highway 101. Dad would help in the fields and Mom would help in the kitchen. Fortunately, they had friends who had settled in Moneta, close to Wilmington. They said many Japanese families lived and worked on the hillside in Long Beach. A number of years later, a flat field area known as the Santa Fe district became available. Almost all the Japanese families moved there. Our family was unable to move. I was born on that lot and in 1923 we moved to a nice house on Nebraska Avenue. I went to Burbank Elementary School and was the only Nisei in school. And in the fifth and sixth grades I was the marbles champion! Then I attended Franklin Junior High School and played on the Peewee basketball and baseball teams. Then boom—on March 10, 1933, a huge earthquake devastated Long Beach and Compton. I recall terrible looting caused an uproar, and the U.S. Navy provided short patrols at many intersections. Contractors and builders were arrested for using far too little cement—homes and buildings had moved off their foundations and roofs had collapsed. We were lucky the earthquake hit at 6 p.m. and not during school hours. In September 1933, our family moved to Los Angeles so my sisters could enter the University of Southern California. I went to Foshay High School and graduated in June 1935. Our family finally moved to Japan in August 1935. I was age 15—and the rest is history!\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nTwo fellows from ’43 are members of the Harold C. Ripley ’29 Society, a very special community of 5,870 alumni who have donated to the Dartmouth College Fund (DCF) since graduation. The two ’43s? They are Edmund G. “Ted” Miller and George Shimizu. Ted and I were invited to be members just before our 75th class reunion in 2018. Ted replied to my letter, saying, “It was easy. I had a checking account during my campus days. After graduation, I was in the Dartmouth contingent of nearly 100 ’43s at Notre Dame University.” Ninety days later, he was made an ensign and assigned to Noumea, New Caledonia, the U.S. Navy base closest to Guadalcanal in the South Pacific. It was July 1943. He made numerous “runs” to Guadalcanal and the Solomon Islands, hauling troops, equipment, and supplies. “So in early 1944, I sent my donation to the Dartmouth College Fund. And I did the same in early 1945.” Later in life, Ted received his M.A. in 1947 and his Ph.D. in 1955, both from Columbia University. He now lives in Exeter, New Hampshire.\n\nI, George, had no knowledge of the Ripley ’29 Society. In early 1944, I was at Allied Translators and Interpreters Section, just outside Brisbane, Australia. In one of her letters, my wife, Mary, wrote, “I sent a donation to your alumni fund in your name and class.” Then in 1945, Mary wrote that she had made another donation since our outfit (24th Division) was on the island of Mindanao in the southern Philippines. That’s why my Mary deserves the credit for those first two years of gifts to the DCF. A huge wah-hoo-wah to my Mary, who died on May 30, 2000, in Marin County. I am today a proud member of the Ripley ’29 Society.\n\nSpecial notice: The 2022-23 DCF is in full swing. Our annual fundraiser ends on June 30. Take action today! According to my records, there are 13 of us left out of an original 651 frosh who became classmates in September 1939. We are centenarians now. This may be your husband, dad, uncle, or brother: If he can’t send a check, send it for him. If he can’t do it, take it upon yourself, as my Mary did, and mail a donation in his name and ’43. The amount is secondary; participation, to me, is more important. It would be perfect if we could engender 100-percent participation! Thank you.\n\nTake care and stay safe and wear a mask.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nHappy days are here again! I was asked recently, “What was the happiest day of your life?” Well, read on…. Year 2023 means all surviving classmates are now centenarians. I will attain the age of 103 on June 24. I believe I’m at least one year older than most of you. When my family moved from Los Angeles to Tokyo in September 1935, I was accepted at The American School in Japan. I was asked to take my ninth grade over again. There, the class of 1938 had 19 students; the class of 1939 had five. In my senior year we had seven graduates. Later on, I told my kids: “Daddy ranked No. 7 in his high school class.” And woe the next question: “How many kids in your class, Dad?”\n\nI’ve always been an easygoing fellow. I was an eternal optimist, good at taking things in stride. The glass was always half-full. It’s easy to be separated by business, a mission, or vacation. But being separated by war is the worst feeling of all. Anything can happen— a stray bullet, a sniper, friendly fire, a booby trap, a sudden explosion, a vehicle accident. That’s why, with sound recollections, I know the happiest day of my life was the morning of January 14, 1946, when I finally returned to my wife, Mary, in Los Angeles after a 24-month separation—January 1944 to January 1946. We were never apart again due to war. We were married for more than 57 years when she died on May 30, 2000, due to a heart condition. Mary was the nicest and best thing ever to happen to me in my entire life. It’s true: Happy wife, happy life!\n\nWartime is difficult. It is the unknown that haunts you. The words “for the duration plus six months” are hard to take. No one can predict the future. Rumors were heard about several “Dear John” letters received by good-natured G.I.s; one took it with a grin and said, “I feel sorry for the new guy!” Others became sullen, depressed, and demoralized. With so many weapons available in every tent, a quiet remark to the brass was inevitable. The “DeeJays” would wind up at a nearby hospital for observation. We later learned that some were flown back stateside for greater professional help. I personally felt much sadness and compassion for the DeeJays. People say that war brings out the best in humankind. Sometimes it doesn’t.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nIt was December 1945! “Beyond the Blue Horizon” and “Red Sails in the Sunset” were two of my favorite golden oldies. Every sunset was a thing of beauty and joy. As the good ship MS President Monroe plowed through the white-capped Pacific, all 4,000 returning veterans counted our blessings. San Francisco was getting closer and closer. Just days earlier the ship’s chefs had prepared a wonderful Christmas dinner with all the trimmings. It was by far the best meal we enjoyed in months and months. Life on the decks of the Monroe was very good.\n\nMusic and lyrics make the world smaller. Music and lyrics make life better for families and friends. It’s now year 1946 and we are still a week out from the Golden Gate. An announcement boomed out of the PA loudspeaker: “Now hear this! Four nurses will perform in the stern lounge at 1900. Don’t miss it.” The gals imitated the Andrews Sisters, and what a marvelous show they put on. After a raucous “Don’t Sit Under the Apple Tree” and other hits, a GI shouted, “Where have you gals been?” And one nurse hollered back, “Up front, where the good-looking guys are!” And that started the good-natured bantering back and forth, which enlivened the show—all in good taste ribaldry. Those four nurses were probably star performers in their high school and college musicals. The nurses and their pianist were terrific, and we all appreciated their efforts, talent, and sense of humor. At the end one gal said, “I’m a fan of Frances Langford.” She crooned, “I’m in the mood for love simply because you’re near me,” and we all cheered and asked for one more. It was “White Christmas,” and when she finished there wasn’t a dry eye in the SRO audience.\n\nSpecial notes: A fond Merry Christmas and a healthy and happy new year of 2023 to all. Take care and stay safe.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nHither and yon, happy days are here again! Our U.S. 8th Army was on the island of Mindanao in the southern Philippines in the waning years of World War II. To the best of my memory, August 15, 1945, when Japan surrendered, has to be one of the happiest days of my life. I was 25 years old. Staging for the invasion of Japan came to a stunning halt. D-Day Japan was scheduled for October 1, 1945, and would involve 300,000 U.S. and Allied troops. (Note: D-Day Normandy on June 6, 1944, involved 156,000 troops.) Nisei linguists became go-betweens. In two days stockades were set up by combat engineers; the boundaries were two sets of barbed wire. If a prisoner wanted to escape it would have been easy, but where would he go? Every GI gave up a set of khakis and a blanket and we went on short rations—that happens when there are 13,000 extra mouths to feed and bodies to clothe. Among them were about a thousand Japanese army civilian employees and their families of young kids and babies. “War is over” leaflets were dropped by low-flying B-25 bombers; the Philippine Scouts knew exactly where every large Japanese camp was located. It seems that it was easy for the enemy to surrender. They had no air force or navy, no mail in months and months, were low on food, medical supplies, and ammo. We found out that the city-bred soldiers were quick to accept defeat. The country-bred soldiers, with zero contact with any Americans, were more gung-ho and prone to resist but they quickly changed their attitude and realized how lucky they were to surrender to American forces in the Philippines. There was mutual respect from both sides.\n\nThere were mixed emotions for several older Japanese businessmen. They had met and married younger Filipino women; now had children. They had heard rumors of a devastated Japan—no economy, cities and villages in ruins. They had nothing to return to, and if they did return, knew they would be just another mouth to feed. Some businessmen appealed to American officials as they desired to remain in the Philippines. Their wishes were granted. Then there was another problem: More than 60,000 Japanese soldiers were still on bypassed islands in the Southwest Pacific. They had to be rounded up and returned to Japan. Lo and behold, mission accomplished.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nIt is the year 1946! It is Monday, January 14! It is exactly 7 a.m. I pressed the door bell and a fellow opened the door. I said, “I’m George Shimizu,” and he replied, “Great. Welcome back. I’ll get Mary.” I sat down in the living room of the All Peoples Church hostel (as I found out later). I closed my eyes and thought to myself how lucky I am to be home again. I silently counted my blessings. Then my Mary came down the stairs and quickened her stride. We clung together and all she was saying was “Honey. Honey. Honey!” And I remember saying, “My sweetheart. Sweetheart. Sweetie!” Mary was crying and I could not see her because something kept getting into my eyes. We were finally together again! It had been a two-year separation—730 days and nights. We would never be separated by war again. I look back—it was exactly 24 months (January 1944) ago that we had boarded the MS Matsonia, 14,000 soldiers and equipment careening and zigzagging solo all the way from San Francisco to Brisbane, Australia. We were all grim-faced and solemn. The U.S. and Allied forces were losing on most fronts in the Pacific war zone at that time. Then, like a miracle, America’s superior heavy industry changed the climate in the war against Japan. Bulldozers, huge earth-movers, long-range submarines, escort “flat-tops”, tanks, P-51 Mustangs, B-29 Superfortresses, all combined in the strategy on the road to victory leading to the dropping of two atomic bombs, over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945. If peace had not occurred, experts estimated that more than 1 million (military and civilian) lives would have been lost in the following 12 months.\n\nThen Mary left to go upstairs, and I reflected on the past week. After a night at Camp Stoneman in Pittsburg, California, we went by bus to Camp Beale, just north of Sacramento. Three days later we were out of the U.S. Army. Three of us took the Greyhound bus overnight to Los Angeles. The lady at the counter told me to go down San Pedro Street to Mary’s address. Then an elderly gentleman said, “I go down San Pedro on my way home. I will drop you off at that address. That will be my good deed for the day!”\n\nOur class sends heartfelt condolences to the family of our one and only incomparable Waldo “Doc” Fielding, who died on January 1 in Hingham, Massachusetts, at the age of 100 years.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nDisappointments? I’ve had several in my 101 years of life. It was in January 1946, 76 years ago, at Camp Stoneman in Pittsburg, California, in the Bay Area.\n\nEarlier in the day our troop ship, MS President Monroe, had finally docked in San Francisco Bay. Four thousand gleeful soldiers had boarded the ship in Leyte Gulf in the central Philippines. World War II had ended on August 15, 1945. Scuttlebutt was that our ship might be one of the last to “bring the boys home”! I had been counting the days as the ship neared the Golden Gate. What an emotional and precious moment it would be to hear Mary’s voice again! It had been two long years of separation. Those were exciting years—going from Australia up through the various islands; from Leyte, our outfit went south to the island of Mindanao, where we were when the war ended. Just the mere thought of being with Mary again gave me the strength and spirit to overcome those days and nights. In retrospect, I think I was the only Nisei linguist on the ship. I heard later that more than 600 Nisei linguists, the majority of them from relocation centers, were awarded battlefield commissions to second lieutenant in Manila. They became an important and vital cog in the Army of Occupation and the democratization of Japan. Why and because? Well, those linguists had no home to return to. Their families were still behind barbed-wire fences back in the States. Many linguists would become career military, some would marry native-born Japanese gals and would retire as officers. Through the years I met many linguists and their war brides and welcomed them heartily. During WW II Japan was our worst enemy. Today Japan is our staunchest ally in the Pacific—no doubt about it!\n\n“Sorry, soldier, I know where you are calling from. There is no listed telephone number at that address on 27th Street in Los Angeles.” I thanked the phone operator as my heart sank. Oh, what a big disappointment! (Note: A home telephone was impossible to get during wartime and shortly thereafter.) Suddenly, I reconciled myself, knowing that I would see my Mary in four days in person! Then I thought of my best friend of 18 days, good Sam of New Jersey. Thanks for the memories!\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\n“Land ahoy!” Who among the super-happy GIs on board would be the first to shout out those magic words? Our good ship, the MS President Monroe, steadily plodded toward the Golden Gate of California. “California, here we come—right back where we started from!” was the talk of every get-together. I would hazard a guess that about 85 percent of the Army soldiers began their overseas trek from San Francisco to action in the Pacific during World War II. And now here we were, thinking how fortunate we were to be heading home to our loved ones.\n\nMy best buddy, Sam from New Jersey, and I shared every meal and bull session. What a good friend he was. Sam and I especially enjoyed hearing how the air superiority gained by the Americans hastened the end of WW II. They extolled the change in the skies when the United States introduced new fighter bombers, including the twin-hull P-38 Lightning, P-51 Mustang (my favorite), P-47 Thunderbolt, and the Navy’s F6F Hellcat carrier. All four could out-maneuver and out-gun the vaunted Japanese Zero fighter, which ruled the air in the Pacific war from the days of Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941) until 1943. During WW II air power really helped, on land or sea. How comforting it was to see a plane flying toward us, to know it was a “friendly.” What a delight when the President Monroe glided under the Golden Gate Bridge. It seems to me that we were one of the last of the returning soldiers. There was a brass band welcoming us home! We could hear a voice saying. “I never thought I’d see this place again!” Another hollered, “I’m going to kiss terra firma when I get off the gangplank!” Sometime later, a dude named Tony became more famous by crooning “I left my heart in San Francisco, high on a hill.” Looking back, everyone had a warm feeling for California. Many fellows told me they planned to move to the West Coast. Sam and I agreed we were two lucky guys. More to come.\n\nIn the sad news department, I have received word that classmate Waldo “Doc” Fielding died on January 1, 2022.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nJanuary 1, 1946: Happy New Year! Heartfelt salutations and greetings echoed from bow to stern on board the MS President Monroe. For the first time in 10 years no shots were fired in anger, no bombs were dropped, no torpedoes were launched. There was world peace on earth—finally! My thoughts were on buddies who gave up their lives in World War II. They will be forever young. Our ship kept plodding through the high seas, heading for landfall at the Golden Gate of San Francisco. All 4,000 troops were counting our blessings. We were the lucky ones, heading to be home forever.\n\nIt was the first morning after debarking from Leyte Gulf. I had just finished washing up when I heard a voice, “Want to go to chow together?” We were the earliest risers. I replied, “Sure, let’s go.” We introduced ourselves. His name was Sam, and he came from a small town on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River, 25 miles from Times Square. Sam’s dad had gone to Fordham, but he was choosing Rutgers and wanted to become a certified public accountant under the G.I. Bill. He was three years older than me. In the next 18 days Sam became one of my all-time favorite fun guys. Our bunks were close together, we ate meals together, and we had so much in common. A super buddy!\n\nIt was smooth sailing. What a bunch of slap-happy men. One morning Sam told me, “George, I think you’re on the wrong ship heading in the wrong direction.” “No, Sam,” I answered, “I was born in Long Beach, California. My wife is waiting for me in Los Angeles. I’m going home to Mary.” A few days later Sam said, “You know, George, I was wrong. You have a Japanese face. You have an American heart—and a big, genuine smile.” Nearing the Golden Gate, rumors were rife that a big card shark had won more than $10,000 in a high-stakes poker game. Gads, you could buy three houses for that kind of money. Were the losers set up? No one could guess. More later….\n\nAttention fellow classmates: Please drop me a line on how you’re doing—or a member of your family can do the same, okay? Hope you enjoyed the past holidays. Have a healthy 2022. Take care, stay safe, and wear a mask.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nChristmas 1945: We were on the high seas, en route to San Francisco, more than 4,000 happy and giddy GIs, all survivors of months and months in the Southwest theater of operations. I had been discharged (finally) earlier in the month from the 42nd Army General Hospital on Leyte. I returned to my outfit and didn’t recognize anyone except my captain and a first lieutenant; all my buddies had long gone. Several days later I was at the replacement depot and lo and behold, the USS President Monroe arrived in Leyte Gulf. We boarded immediately and left—the last time I would see any part of the Philippines. I spent four Christmases in the U.S. Army. The best Christmas of all was on the President Monroe. World War II had ended on August 15, 1945. We were headed for home. We were on the winning side. No more nightmares about the invasion of Japan, rumored to have been set for October 1, 1945. No more zigzagging across the Pacific Ocean. No more blackouts at night. California is our destination—full speed ahead. We were all counting our blessings. Life was good.\n\nSpecial notice: Waldo “Doc” Fielding hits the century mark! (Did you know Doc was ping pong champion during his campus days?) A heads-up email from Dick Fleming ’53 alerted me to send a nice happy 100th birthday greeting from his buddies in the ’43 family. Doc’s wife, Anita Mackinnon, engineered a surprise gala celebration. More than 100 guests turned out on July 25 and enthusiastically sang “As the backs go tearing by….” The get-together was held at Linden Palms Retirement Center in Hingham, Massachusetts, where Doc and Anita live. As usual, Doc delivered. A huge wah-hoo-wah to all!\n\nA hearty farewell to secretary Jean Francis, widow of Richard Francis ’38. I read her sentimental swan song in the July/August DAM. I always enjoyed her column from afar—and her Richard was one lucky fellow. Jean, take care and stay safe.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulvida Ave., Milpitas, CA 94595; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nIt is 1945—the new scenario is “What if….”\n\nWhat if there was no mushroom cloud over the city of Hiroshima on August 6 or the seaport of Nagasaki on August 9 or Tokyo was mum, with zero announcements over its NHK radio network on August 15?\n\nAnd what if President Harry S. Truman had replied “No” to the continuance of the Manhattan Project directed by Maj. Gen. Leslie Groves? President F.D.R. never told his vice president about the Manhattan Project; incoming President Truman had not been in the loop! Upon review it appears most high-ranking officers were for using the atom bombs. It seems Gen. MacArthur voted no to the nuclear use. Gen MacArthur felt Japan was on its last legs—without air power or navy and on the home front little food and no steel or oil—and fighting a losing battle on all fronts. What if a miffed President Truman said no to Maj. Gen. Groves—and the top-secret Manhattan Project came to a sudden and inglorious halt?!\n\nNone of the thousands of U.S. troops had any knowledge of the Manhattan Project. We just went on as usual, staging for the invasion of Japan slated for October 1, 1945. All in the war zones felt the extra pressure and anxiety. We understood surviving overseas was a question mark—anything could happen, and would, in the long run!\n\nExperts were saying that an invasion of Japan would extend the war another 12 months. The cost in lives would be a million soldiers—and millions of Japanese civilians would die, fighting to save their way of life and their homeland. We were constantly reminded to be prepared, be alert, trust no one, avoid fraternizing with the enemy—as it would cost you your life! Rumors were rife that 75- and 80-year-old men and women were waiting for us with wooden spears and hand grenades, 5- and 6-year-olds would throw hand grenades to disable tank tracks, weapon carriers, and trucks. And we worried how our M-4 Sherman tanks would manage to travel on narrow dirt trails and whether they would lose their maneuverability in the water-filled rice paddies.\n\nLuzon was practically secure in June and the battle in Okinawa ended in July. On March 9, 1945, more than 300 B-29 Super Fortresses dropped 200 tons of incendiary bombs that destroyed 16 square miles of Tokyo and more than 100,000 lives. My family home in Shibuya Ward was lost in this attack—more on this later.\n\nOur class sends heartfelt condolences to the family of the Rev. Benedict Reid, who died on March 13 in Palm Desert, California.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulvida Ave., Milpitas, CA 94595; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nFlashback to the year 1945: The 42nd Army General Hospital on Leyte was huge! Two months after arriving via hospital plane from Mindanao and into the intensive care unit, I felt better but not strong. My Army major doctor was telling me, “Not yet, George, not yet.” It was early November; World War II had ended on August 15. My outfit had returned to Leyte. My buddies had headed home. It would be another 45 days before my discharge!\n\nMilitary lore proves that the Navy and Marine Corps attracted the prettiest nurses, then came the Air Force, Coast Guard, and finally the Army. I truly disagree. The Army had its own bevy of beauties. There were eight of us in our ICU ward and we all loved and idolized Lt. “Cee.” I think she was from Wisconsin, and no one could pronounce or spell her last name. When she glided through the doors in the early morning, groans emanated from every bed. “Nurse Cee, I don’t feel good. Hold my hand.” “Lieutenant, I don’t feel well. I need help.” “Nurse Cee, I’m going to faint!” And she would holler back, “Okay, fellas, chow in 30 minutes!”\n\nLt. Cee was the prettiest gal in the hospital. She was our ray of sunshine, a bundle of joy, a blockbuster beauty—and she was our favorite nurse. One afternoon I was writing a letter home when she stopped by, saying, “George, your Mary is so pretty.” I replied, “I think you’re prettier, Lt. Cee.” Nurse Cee jabbed me in the upper arm with her finger and whispers, “George, you are one big flirt.” Then, with a lovely smile, she sauntered over to the next bed. She honestly lit up every room. I wonder whatever happened to Nurse Cee. In a certain way, she “saved” our young lives!\n\nIt was strange, but after spending 105 days in the ICU, one’s nurse becomes very important in your life. She talks, you listen. She tells a story, you laugh. Except for a doctor’s appointment once a week, we were on our own after each meal. There was no occupational therapy, no physical therapy. I enjoyed going back to the social lounge and library. I read back issues of Life and Look magazine and the available newspapers and liked chatting with other grunts. We were the “veterans.” And ICU patients had privileges. The hospital took really good care of us. We saw every USO troupe that came through and saw movies and news reels. We all agreed that America had survived WW II better than other worn-torn countries. No battles had occurred on U.S. soil. How lucky we all were! We lost 415,000 soldiers in WW II. As I write this in April, Covid-19 has claimed more than 550,000 lives in more than 12 months. So take care, stay safe.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nBack to circa 1941: Dick’s House finally released me on December 11. The surprise and stunning news of Pearl Harbor was still in the air. After I returned to 109 Middle Mass, my roommate Nobu Mitsui and I walked to Thayer Hall for an early lunch. I asked how he was faring and he said, “I’m all right. Things could be worse. But that Pearl Harbor was a complete shocker!” I readily agreed and cautioned Nobu to be extra patient and resilient. I heard later that Nobu had been taunted and heckled, mostly by younger rednecks. I immediately imagined that Nobu was probably quite adept in martial arts (judo). Nearly all the youth in Japan take judo training in their early school days. A close dorm friend told me that two upperclassmen from North Mass Hall had prevented an altercation by shouting, “Hey, stop it! We don’t need that kind of talk here in Hanover.” The younger students sheepishly walked away. Nobu never mentioned it to me.\n\nSeveral months later I heard that President Hopkins, a good friend of F.D.R., had vouched for Nobu’s conduct while he was in Hanover. At about the same time I was having lunch with buddies on Main Street. A waitress told me “George, those two fellows want to talk to you.” I went outside and found two FBI agents. They asked, “What do you think of Takanobu Mitsui?” I instantly replied, “He’s harmless.” And, you know what, those same FBI fellows came by about 10 days before graduation (December 12, 1942) and, in the parking area outside, told me, “This is just a personal visit to wish you good luck. We know you’re going into the Army’s Military Intelligence Service on December 15, three days after graduation.” I would be just one of the 91 percent of our class who served in the armed forces in World War II. It is sad to remember that we lost 23 classmates in WW II. They will be forever young.\n\nOur generation came through WW II. We were all born in the early 1920s. (I turned 100 last year.) At the time, serving in the military was the right thing to do. When we graduated, the U.S. and Allied forces were losing on all battlefronts. A total of 16 million soldiers were in uniform.\n\nOur class sends heartfelt condolences to the families of John M. Jenkins, who died on November 23, 2020, in Hanover, and John W. Reps, who died on November 12, 2020, in Ithaca, New York.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 94595; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nIt is Sunday, December 7, 1941. It is chilly and gloomy outside, warm and cozy inside. I was in Dick’s House, admitted three days earlier with fever and flu. There was no more golf and tennis and I was looking forward to indoor squash. Winter months are closing in, exams are forthcoming, and Christmas is in our thoughts. There are six of us in our ward, we are just lolling around, and I am reading the sports pages of The Boston Globe. The New York Yankees had routed the Brooklyn Dodgers in the World Series in October. And then—boom—it happens! An exciting voice hollers, “Turn on your radio!” An announcer says, “…Pearl Harbor under attack by Japanese dive bombers!” None of us knows where Pearl Harbor is. As we gather around the radio, we hear, “Pearl Harbor is the U.S. Navy base in Hawaii, outside of Honolulu.”\n\nThe first bombs and tornadoes exploded at 7:55 a.m. in Hawaii. Twenty-two minutes earlier, radar reported unidentified objects to headquarters. Headquarters had thought they were a squadron of new B-17 bombers flying in from the mainland and did not sound the alarm. To me, 22 minutes is a lot of time to prepare to repulse an enemy air attack. Pearl Harbor was a complete shock: 2,335 American servicemen died, 19 Navy ships sunk or damaged, 325 Army and Navy aircraft lost, the vast majority lined up wingtip to wingtip on their designated air strips. On that traumatic afternoon, I just could not believe the news. Here I was in the junior class, the only Nisei on campus, with my parents in Japan. As I looked around, I saw all eyes on me, suspiciously, no doubt. I realized that my life on campus had changed instantly and drastically. One patient, a senior, told me, “Don’t worry, George, we know you’re an American.” A nurse added, “We also know you’re from Tokyo. We also know, from all reports, that you’re more American than lots of others here in Hanover.” I thought, “I am lucky I am a junior. Everybody knows me and my roommate, Nobu Mitsui. If we were freshmen, it might have been a different story.” Every one of us wondered, “What now?” I was especially worried about my best friend, Mary Yamamoto, in Los Angeles. America’s entry into World War II would change our lives forever.\n\nNote: Mary and I would later marry—on April 2, 1943—while I was at the Army’s Military Intelligence Service Language School at Camp Savage, 15 miles outside of Minneapolis.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulvida Ave., Milpitas, CA 94595; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nIt was the year 1945. World War II officially ended on the deck of the USS Missouri, where the peace treaty was signed on Sunday, September 2, in Tokyo Bay. I was one of thousands of U.S. troops on the island of Mindanao in the southern Philippines. All the G.I.s were so happy. We were heading for home and we were on the winning side! “Little Boy” and “Fat Man” did the trick! Those two bombs forced Japan’s surrender—what a huge relief. No more fears, nightmares, and worrying about D-Day Japan, rumored to be October 1, 1945. That was the target date for our 8th Army, under Lt. Gen. Robert Eichelberger, to land on the beaches 50 miles north of Tokyo. (The landing ship tanks that were supposed to take us on that perilous two-week voyage to the shores of Japan instead performed a herculean humanitarian effort: They transported the thousands of Japanese soldiers and civilians back to their homeland. According to reports, the food was “excellent.”)\n\nThen it happened. One morning after breakfast I didn’t feel well. I went to a nearby combat engineers’ sick call and the medic on duty said, “Hey, Sarge, you’ve got a 103.8 temperature. You’ve got to go to the division hospital in Davao.” I was admitted into the 24th Division Hospital. Three days later a major said, “George, we’ve been treating you for malaria, which you’ve had before. But you don’t have malaria, you have infectious hepatitis. You’re too sick for us to handle. Tomorrow morning we’re sending you by hospital plane to a big Army general hospital on Leyte” about 500 miles away. There were six stretchers being loaded, and as mine was being moved onto the converted C-47, I heard an airman’s voice ring out: “Hey, who’s the V.I.P. prisoner of war? That’s a first for this plane.” A buddy of mine hollered out: “That’s no POW, that’s George Shimizu. He’s a sergeant in the U.S. Army. He’s one of us. He’s one of the good guys!” Several hours later we landed at Tacloban Airport on Leyte. Ambulances took us to a huge Army hospital and I was immediately admitted into the intensive care unit. I wondered, Am I going to make it? I didn’t want to die on this lonely island in the Philippines, so far from home. I was in the ICU for three and a half months. After two months I was feeling better, but the doctors would not release me, saying, “Not yet, George, not yet.” More later.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035-6142; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nMindanao is the second largest island in the Philippines. It is 35,537 square miles of mountains, valleys, and farmlands. It is double the size of a combined Vermont and New Hampshire. World War II had ended days earlier, on August 15, 1945, and brief peace negotiations had taken place all over Mindanao. Filipino scouts knew exactly where every large encampment was hidden, and tens of thousands of mimeographed surrender sheets were dropped by low-flying B25 medium bombers on these enemy positions.\n\nWe had made the landing on the island back in late February. After heavy battles the enemy had, overnight, disappeared to safe areas deep in the mountains near a lake or river. Then came Emperor Hirohito’s radio announcement. And WWII as we knew it was over! What a huge relief. The horizon looked brighter and there was not a dry eye in the outfit. Thank the good Lord for those two bombs! As the enemy soldiers trudged toward us in surrender, they were grim-faced, looking at the ground with stony stares from hollow eyes. It was the saddest sight I’ve seen in my life. They expected the worst from the “horrible Americans” their leaders in Tokyo warned them about. Low on ammo, medical supplies, food, and morale, they had literally been abandoned by Tokyo. They had received no mail from the homeland for months and months. I and other Nisei linguists assured them they would be taken care of, the sick and wounded first, and then returned to Japan as soon as possible. I treated them with compassion, respect, and kindness. As a non-smoker, I was able to give the POWs my ration of cigarettes. We also told them how lucky they were to have surrendered to American forces—and later reports verified brutal treatment of surrendering Japanese soldiers in parts of China and Manchuria. More in a later column.\n\nOur class sends heartfelt condolences to the families of Frank P. Sherwood, one of my favorite classmates, who died on August 28, 2019, and Michael Frothingham, who died on August 10, 2020.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035-6142; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nCoronavirus, shelter-at-home, social distancing—never in my lifetime (I just turned 100) did I dream we, as a nation, would be capitulating to an invisible disease. Education is at a standstill, bar exams have been postponed, first-responders are in need of personal protective gear, and face masks are required when outside. As one wag pointed out: “It’s better six feet apart than six feet under!”\n\nRewind to the summer of 1942. As seniors we all knew we were old enough to serve. After graduation on December 12, 1942, we scattered to all corners of the United States. We were worried and wondered what was in our future. WW II was No. 1 on everyone’s to-do list. No one knew where we would be next year or in two or three years.\n\nIn the summer of 1943, about 200 Nisei were ordered to Camp Shelby in Mississippi for three months basic training with the recently formed 442nd Regimental Combat Team. This was composed of Japanese American troops whose families, for the most part, were behind barbed wire in 10 isolated internment camps due to the executive order signed by FDR. I was one of six GIs who qualified as “expert” with the M1 Garand rifle.\n\nIn the summer of 1944 I was an interrogator of Japanese prisoners of war at the Allied Translators Interpreters Section just outside of Brisbane, Australia. The section was later awarded the prestigious Presidential Unit Citation for outstanding services rendered from 1942 to September 3, 1945.\n\nIn the summer of 1945 I was on the island of Mindanao in the southern Philippines. WW II ended on August 15, 1945. More than 12,000 POWs and Japanese civilians were in stockades and ready to return to Japan. The landing ship tanks that we were to board for the invasion of Japan on October 1, 1945, were instead returning the Japanese to their homeland. Then, in early September, I got sick with a fever of 103.8. I was in the 24th Division hospital when a major told me, “George, you’re too sick for us to handle. We’re sending you by hospital plane to a huge Army hospital on Leyte.” I was admitted to the intensive care unit in the hospital on Leyte, another island in the Philippines, for 105 days. I really thought I was a goner. I was only 25, and I only wanted to see my Mary back in Los Angeles. More later.\n\nOur class sends heartfelt condolences to the family of Robert “Bob” Bowman, who died on April 18 in Vero Beach, Florida.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035-6142; (408) 930-2488; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nIt was the summer of 1942, and our senior year was a conflict of anxiety and uncertainty. Nobody in our class knew what exactly the future held. Where would we be in 12 months, or 24, or 36? Classes were attended and we studied with desperate emotions. It was rumored early on that no prof would flunk a ’43. Our 1943 Aegis shows 411 graduates—91 percent headed for the military; in the armed forces for the duration of war, plus six months. We graduated—with no families, with no pomp and circumstance—in a farewell dinner in Thayer Hall on December 12, 1942. Three days later I was in the Army, waiting to report to Camp Savage, the Army’s Military Intelligence Service language school, located 15 miles outside of Minneapolis/St. Paul. I was one of about 200 Niseis (second-generation Americans of Japanese ancestry). Ten Niseis were part of every U.S. and Allied infantry division in the Pacific, China, Burma, and India theaters of operation. We were the Japanese language experts.\n\nAnd who will ever forget those Sunday night jam sessions during that summer of 1942? Hundreds of students, townspeople, professors and their families, and hundreds of Navy midshipmen learning to become ensigns in 90 days all sat in makeshift chairs or on the lawn in front of Robinson Hall. Hanover High School girls sang their best renditions of Judy Garland, Bea Wain, Betty Hutton, and Frances Langford. And the high school boys chimed in with Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra. Oh, what fun it was! Even celebrated professors undid their ties from button-down collars and surprised everyone with their vocal talents and dance moves.\n\nThese shows, led by Waldo “Doc” Fielding, were a gigantic and much-needed respite and diversion. During that summer of ’42, with its accelerated classes so we could join the war effort, Doc Fielding brought a crescendo of plaudits to that small village of Hanover. He brought us together like a pair of cymbals. The ’43 musicians included Derek van Quackenbush on saxophone, Chick Webb and Eugene Roitman on bass fiddle, Dacy Stevens and Leon Chapman on trumpets. Those five, with other Green Collegians and Barbary Coast performers, made us forget the battles we were losing on all fronts during those difficult war-torn days.\n\nSad News Department: Hanover records indicate the passing of Henry C. Peck on April 4 in Pasadena, California, and Robert I. Lappin on April 3, probably in Swampscott, Massachusetts.

My phone rang and I saw the name “Doc” Fielding on the screen. He was calling to wish me a happy New Year and I reciprocated. He sounded just fine in Massachusetts, and I told him, “It’s 60 degrees here in sunny northern California.” According to the San Francisco Chronicle that day, it was 37 degrees in Boston.\n\nWhat a joy it was to hear from a favorite ’43. We reminisced about bygone days. I reminded Doc about our first dinner at our 70th reunion at the Hanover Inn: At our table were Doc and his date; my daughter, Carol, and her husband, Tommy; Bob Ehinger; Henry Keck and his significant other; and myself. Henry regaled us with his inventive stories, pure genius at our table. One story led to another, and who there will ever forget variety night and jam sessions in front of Robinson Hall and Webster Hall? Who was the talkative master of ceremonies? You’re right, our own Doc Fielding! One wag lately told Doc, “Thanks for a great show. We ran out of gas ration coupons so had to settle for your act.”\n\nDoc and I reflected on our 55th reunion (or was it our 60th?), when Doc and his Suzie mesmerized everyone (including those in the classes of ’38 and ’48) with their song and dance, corny stories, and wonderful entertainment in the Hopkins Center. Then two banjo-playing ’38s brought down the house by leading us all in singing golden oldies from the 1930s and 1940s. What a night for all the old-timers!\n\nWe were seniors during the summer of 1942, when the College instituted classes so we could graduate six months early, in December 1942. They were accelerated programs due to WW II. The U.S. and Allied forces were losing on all fronts. Gas ration coupons were impossible to get. Hanover became a Navy town as 900 midshipmen arrived—90 days later to become ensigns bound for wartime duty. President Hopkins announced that the total student body was 1,984, the lowest in 20 years. Dartmouth’s newest objective: Prepare students for service in the nation’s armed forces.\n\nThanks for your phone call, Doc. You made my day!\n\nOur class sends heartfelt condolences to the family of Oliver “Ollie” Lazare, who died on December 12, 2019, in Scarsdale, New York.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2140 Sepulveda Ave., Milpitas, CA 95035-6142; (925) 937-2504; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nMore freshman year nostalgia: Our highly touted frosh football team went undefeated, with Bud Kast and Ray Wolfe leading the pack. Our frosh basketball team, with future headliners George Munroe, Jim Olsen, and Stan Skaug, made varsity head coach Ozzie Cowles grin from ear to ear when seen on Main Street.\n\nIt took five months before our first Winter Carnival. Ten days before the mid-February 1940 event, a voice rang out, “George, do you have a date for next week?” I replied, “No, why?” He told me, “Now you have a date, okay? I’ve met her and she’s a fun gal.” He later stated that his steady was a freshman at Mount Holyoke and her roommate was dying to come up for Winter Carnival.\n\nAnd what a wonderful blind date: a dark-haired cutie, an infectious smile, a bubbly personality. As we headed for lunch on Main Street she gripped my hand and said, “George, I am so happy to be here.” We went to see sporting events, a tour of Baker Library, and even drove out to the Hanover Country Club golf course to watch the ski jumpers catapulting into the frigid air. Then, after dinner in Thayer Hall, we headed to the gym to dance—was it Count Basie or Duke Ellington? The dance floor was rockin’ and jumpin’! Following Sunday brunch the gals left by car. My date, kissing me on the cheek, said “George, I thank you for a marvelous time. A great weekend!” Crazy, but after 79 years, I remember her telling me her boyfriend was at Cornell but I can’t even recall her name!\n\nOur class sends heartfelt condolences to the families of Thomas F. Ellis, who died on July 12, 2018; Robert L. Grant, who died on August 16, 2019, in Sarasota, Florida; and George H. Lowden, who died on October 7, 2019. The College has also recently learned of the deaths of Carl J. Batter Sr., who died on January 7, 2012, in Rockville, Maryland; Charles R. Cusack, who died on November 4, 2016; Donald W. Kingsley, who died July 5, 2010; Alexander C. Nagle Jr., who died on August 12, 2013, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina; and Robert G. Taylor, who died on November 21, 2010, in Hyannis, Massachusetts.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2642 Saklan Indian Drive, Apt. 2, Walnut Creek, CA 94595; (925) 937-2504; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nWe were sophomores! It was the middle of November 1940—exactly 79 years ago this month. It was just another football weekend in Hanover, and 15,000 fans witnessed one of the most heralded and memorable games in NCAA gridiron history! How can a team lose 7-3 on Saturday and then become victorious 48 hours later by a score of 3-0? The game was in an era before TV and instant replay.\n\nIn 1940 Cornell’s Big Red was ranked No. 2 in the nation and a 24-point favorite to demolish our varsity. Starring for the home team were classmates Harry Gerber and Remsen Crego as stalwart linemen and Bud Kast and Ray Wolfe in the backfield. Left end Bob Krieger ’41 kicked a 17-yard field goal in the fourth quarter to give us a 3-point lead. But all Big Green hopefuls in the stands were merely waiting for the opponents to begin their onslaught. It was just a matter of time before Cornell came to life…. They did—on the final snap of the game! They scored their winning touchdown on a short pass play. Dartmouth lost, 7-3! The four of us—Bill Moseley, John Milburn, Nobu Mitsui, and I—sadly trudged to Thayer Hall for an early dinner. Bill, with dessert in hand, returned to our table, saying, “Hey, there’s a rumor going on that Cornell scored on an illegal extra down!” John piped up, “Bill, sit down! You’re dreamin’! Nobody’s going to change the score. We still lose!” But somebody did change the score. It was referee William “Red” Friesell, who sent a Western Union telegram to captain Lou Young ’41 confessing he allowed an illegal fifth down to Cornell. Referee Friesell admitted the final score should be Dartmouth 3, Cornell zero! Both college presidents agreed within hours. We won!\n\nThe 1940 fifth-down game still registers as one of the all-time greatest goofs in NCAA football history. It still ranks highly as an example of great sportsmanship and integrity for the good of the game! And to top it off, we were there.\n\nOur class extends heartfelt condolences to the families of John Hyde, who died August 6, 2019; Palmer Wright, Ph.D., who died May 16, 2019; and David Bortz, who died in 2012, we have just learned.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2642 Saklan Indian Drive, Apt. 2, Walnut Creek, CA 94595; (925) 937-2504; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nI am writing this column during the first week of August. It was exactly 74 years ago that I was on the island of Mindanao in the southern Philippines, serving as a sergeant in the U.S. Army as a Japanese language linguist. World War II was heading toward its biggest challenge. It was rumored that U.S. forces and allies were staging for the invasion of Japan. The war in Europe had ended on VE Day May 8, 1945. FDR had died on April 12, 1945, and Harry Truman was sworn in as president. It was President Truman who ordered the dropping of two nuclear bombs a few weeks later.\n\nOn August 6, 1945, a single bomb was dropped by a lone B-29 Super Fortress on the city of Hiroshima on Honshu, the main island of Japan. The first atomic bomb was the equivalent of 2,000 B-17 Flying Fortresses dropping their payloads. The result: 100,000 dead. On August 9, 1945, the second nuclear bomb exploded over seaport Nagasaki. Another 80,000 were killed. On August 15, 1945, I was writing a letter home when I heard sudden bursts of gunfire as machine guns, Bofors, and cannons sent tracers and bullets soaring overhead. Was it a final desperate banzai attack by Japanese troops? I was reaching for my pistol and M1 carbine when a head popped in the doorway hollering, “The war is over! Japan surrenders!” A bunch of us headed to the mess tent. Sure enough, Armed Forces Radio was blaring that Emperor Hirohito had announced that the war had ended. One lieutenant hugged me and said, “George, it’s over. We’ve survived a war we did not start.” There wasn’t a dry eye in our outfit. The two atomic bombs did it—they hastened WW II’s end. The two bombs were tickets home to the States for every GI, gob, and leatherneck in the Pacific theater.\n\nSad news from Hanover indicates the passing of Phil Harmon on April 29 in Buxton, Maine. We send heartfelt condolences to his family. Phil was awarded the Purple Heart during WW II and served as class treasurer from 1993 to 2009.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2642 Saklan Indian Drive, Apt. 2, Walnut Creek, CA 94595; (925) 937-2504; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nAs I write I am feeling nostalgia for my freshman year in 1939, with New England foliage, cooler nights, and brilliant days. Six of us from Middle Mass were having a late-night snack on Main Street. A waitress walked by and Nobu Mitsui blurts out, “That gal is built!” Bill Ahern and Bob Purdy are stunned. I am speechless. And then Howie Thomas taps Nobu on the shoulder and says, “Welcome to America!”\n\nNobu was quiet and reserved but not secretive. He said he had always had a tutor in English during his youth. He knew words from Webster’s Dictionary that I had never heard of. And he readily admitted that American slang and idioms confused him. Nobu was also highly intelligent—even majoring in physics!—and for much of his time at Dartmouth he surrounded himself with like-minded students.\n\nMiddle Mass—perfectly placed equidistant to Main Street, classrooms, and Baker Library—was also home then to 96 students. Other ’43s included Bill Whitmarsh, Henry Inge, Hud Wilson, Will Gray, Earl Harris, Martin Kane, Bill Glovsky, Stan Sandberg, Gardner Colson, Harold Fuller, Varnum Mead, Roy Collingswood, Herb Harrigan, George Burke, and John Hatheway.\n\nOur class sends heartfelt condolences to the family of Chester Solez, M.D., who died on January 30 in Guilford, Connecticut. He was the youngest member of the class, born on May 6, 1923, in Brooklyn. Chet was an early selectee for Phi Beta Kappa.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2642 Saklan Indian Drive, Apt. 2, Walnut Creek, CA 94595; (925) 937-2504; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nWho came the farthest in our class as a freshman to Dartmouth? Could it be Nobu Mitsui and George Shimizu, both from Tokyo, Japan? No. Two fellows—Cy Brown and Bill Allman—arrived all the way from the Shanghai American School in Shanghai, China. Cy left right after Pearl Harbor to join the Royal Canadian Air Force, later to the U.S. Army’s Signal Corps, and then became a distinguished M.D. in Duluth, Minnesota. As I recall, Bill spent many years in the Middle East and now has an address in Connecticut; he was in financial services.\n\nAs freshmen, all ’43s enjoyed (?) meals together in College Hall Commons. The cost: $135 per semester, or $270 for three squares a day (vacations excepted) for the term ending in June 1940. Imagine—three meals for $1 a day! It was great policy because it made making friends so much easier. Early on, Stan Skaug and Ray Wolfe asked me to join them for lunch because our Monday-Wednesday-Friday class ended at lunchtime. I was more than happy and pleased to accept their kind offer.\n\nUpon arriving at Middle Mass, our friend and mentor Larry Durgin ’40 took Nobu and me to get our dark green ’43 beanies, which marked us as easy “bell hops” for other students to unload their cars and move their furniture. Those dreaded words, “Come here, ’43” and “Over here, ’43” really didn’t bother us. It was all in fun and a long-held tradition. I wonder—do they still do this?\n\nClassmates in Middle Mass included Al Crowley, Hal Lindley, Charles Callahan, Paul Weinbrenner, Bill Chilcote, Tom Keeler, Nobu Mitsui, Richard Chadwick, Oakley Curtis, Ed Leene, Smed Ward, George Lowden, George Mason, Warren Dale, Bud Miskell, Walter Howe, Bob Purdy, Jack Jouett, Bill Scholl, John Milburn, Bill Moseley, Phil Harmon, Holden Waterbury—and others to be named later.\n\nI am writing this on April 2—what a date to be remembered forever. It was on April 2, 1943, that California-born Mary Yamamoto and George Shimizu married in Minneapolis, Minnesota. After our ’43 “Last Supper” in Hanover on December 12, 1942, I had volunteered (the Army recruited me in April 1942) into the Army on December 15, 1942, and then married exactly 76 years ago. Mary died in 2000 due to a heart condition.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2642 Saklan Indian Drive, Apt. 2, Walnut Creek, CA 94595\n\nIn mid-September 1939 Nobu Mitsui and I enjoyed the sights and sounds of the World’s Fair in New York City. Two days later we were in Hanover.\n\nI took the train up, along with hundreds of other undergraduates, to White River Junction, Vermont, five miles from campus. Nobu had driven up the day before with friends who lived in Connecticut. Waiting to greet me was Larry Durgin ’40, who spotted me instantly when I stepped off the train; I was the only American of Japanese ancestry on the platform!\n\nLarry was such a dear friend and mentor, and he truly looked out for Nobu and me. During Freshman Week he came by every night to 109 Middle Mass. He had earlier bought refurbished furniture for our room: two desks, two chairs, a sofa and easy chair, two rugs, and several lamps. The cost: $102. I paid Larry $51 in cash and Nobu said his father’s company would send a check. We would have been lost without Larry’s help and know-how. Later, when I would see him at Baker Library or on Main Street, he always had time for a short conversation. Larry went on to become a well-known and beloved pastor of an elite church on Riverside Drive in New York City.\n\nI knew Larry because his father, Russell Durgin, headed the YMCA in the Kanda District of Tokyo. I also knew Larry’s siblings, Helen and Russell Jr. ’47, who were several classes behind me at the American School in Japan.\n\nMy kids and I had a wonderful dinner with Patty and Rob Lynn ’68 last month. Patty’s dad, Bob Ohama, and I were on the same WW II interrogation team that questioned POWs in the Allied Translators and Interpreters Section just outside of Brisbane, Australia, in 1944. We met Patty and Rob, a retired attorney, for the first time at the Congressional Gold Medal awards ceremony in November 2011 in Washington, D.C.\n\nI write this column on Groundhog Day—and he did not see his shadow, so it will be an early spring! The paper shows the temperatures in Concord, New Hampshire, are a high of 20 and a low of minus 6. The high-low here in Walnut Creek, California, is 57-47. An acute deep freeze has sent temperatures plunging to minus 34 in the Midwest and Eastern regions of the country. Our class spent 40 months (September 1939 to December 1942) in Hanover. Never, to the best of my memory, did we endure this polar vortex of minus degrees.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2642 Saklan Indian Drive, Apt. 2, Walnut Creek, CA 94595\n\nA warm, uplifting, and most welcome letter from the son of one of my favorite classmates, Fred “Fritz” Geller, made my day! Jim Geller ’79 mailed it to this fledgling Class Notes writer. Jim, who lives in Devens, Massachusetts, wrote to say he was “happy to see ’43 Class Notes in DAM again.” His dad, who died 14 years ago, was Tri-Kap. Many of my closest friends were Tri-Kap: Tracy Breed, Bob Clark, High Lena, Jim Mullins, Russ Sherburne, Don Taylor, Howie Thomas, and Holden Waterbury. Son Jim also mentioned seeing, now and then, Jim Hyde (also Tri-Kap), a longtime family friend living in North Woodstock, New Hampshire, who is doing okay but slowing down (like the rest of us).\n\nI’d like to reflect on how a student in Tokyo wound up in Hanover. It was February 1939 when principal Harold C. Amos of the American School in Japan waved me into the hallway and said, “I have an extra application for Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. You love to ski and ice skate, and your best friend, Harvey Daniels [who was a year ahead of me at the school], will be a freshman there too.” I didn’t even know where New Hampshire was, so we looked it up in the library. I mailed the application, and weeks later received Dartmouth’s letter of acceptance. My family and I were happy to read the news. It was a new challenge for me to study at a school “back east.” A month later Takanobu “Nobu” Mitsui phoned and we had lunch together in the school cafeteria. Nobu asked if I would like to share a dormitory room with him. And that’s how we wound up together in 109 Middle Mass, the largest dorm on campus with 96 students.\n\nHeartfelt condolences to the families of Dr. Stan Bolster Jr., who died October 16, 2018; Robert Field, who died June 23, 2018; Charles Does, who died May 2, 2018; Robert Ehinger, who died March 8, 2018; Charles Kane, who died April 29, 2018; Robert Fieldsteel, who died September 25, 2018; and Roberto Herrera, who died January 2, 2015.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2642 Saklan Indian Drive, Apt. 2, Walnut Creek, CA 94595\n\nJust two classmates made it to Hanover to set a dubious record for all-time low attendance for a 75th class reunion. I was not one of them! Well, two is better than one, and far better than zero. They were Ed Bock of Syracuse, New York, and Bob Lappin of Swamscott, Massachusetts.\n\nEd was editor-in-chief of The Dartmouth during our final days on campus. Both were members of Palaeopitus.\n\nAnd many thanks to the class of 1948 for welcoming Ed and Bob and their families to their two dinner receptions. It was much appreciated.\n\nImagine—75 years ago our Commencement date was listed as January 1, 1943. Our “last supper” date was actually December 12, 1942. It was in Thayer Hall’s main dining room. President Hopkins and Arthur Hayes Sulzberger, president and publisher of The New York Times, were the keynote speakers. No pomp, no valedictorian, no Bema, no honorary degrees, no cap and gown, no family. The dinner ended with hugs and teary eyes. We scattered in different directions the next morning. We were facing World War II in its darkest moments.\n\nNinety-one percent of the class was headed for the armed forces. The other 9 percent went to medical school, dental college, or divinity school or were unable to serve. I was in the U.S. Army three days later. I enlisted on December 15, 1942, at Fort Snelling, Minnesota. The Army had recruited me in April 1942 to attend its military intelligence service language school (for Japanese language instruction). Three days later I was at Camp Savage, Minnesota, where non-stop education in Japanese language, military terms, and customs were drummed into about 200 niseis.\n\nWould we see each other ever again? We lost 23 classmates in WW II. Our class was destined early on to travel, courtesy of Uncle Sam, over the girdled earth. WW II ended on September 3, 1945.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2642 Saklan Indian Drive, Apt. 2, Walnut Creek, CA 94595-3052; (925) 937-2504; marymariko@comcast.net\n\nA fond hello to my class of 1943 family. I will be taking former class secretary John Jenkins’ role in Class Notes. John announced in the March/April issue that he was retiring due to “late middle age,” and said he hoped a volunteer or widow would take his place.\n\nIt pained me to see no ’43 column in the past three issues. I believed and hoped a classmate closer to Hanover would rise to the occasion. When that didn’t happen, I dropped a note to John, who said, “Fine, George. You can take my place.”\n\nSo, here I am, 3,000-plus miles away in Walnut Creek, California. I live in Rossmoor, a gated retirement community of 10,000. I will try my best and recently received the College’s list of contact information for surviving classmates and widows.\n\nThe class of ’43 75th reunion was September 28-30, though I was unable to attend. I flew back to Hanover and really enjoyed three previous reunions (55th, 60th, and 70th). Sadly, I missed our 65th because I had an aortic valve replacement surgery two weeks before the get-together.\n\nIt was more than 79 years ago that the class of 1943 matriculated on the Big Green campus—and 651 bright-eyed frosh joined together for meals in Freshman Commons. It was September 1939, and Nazi Germany had invaded Poland on September 1. We were known as the first war-time class.\n\nI am writing this column on August 15, a date my class will never forget: V-J Day! I was on the island of Mindanao in the southern Philippines. I was a sergeant in the U.S. Army and served as a Japanese language expert.\n\nMore about that later.\n\n—George Shimizu, 2642 Saklan Indian Drive, Apt. 2, Walnut Creek, CA 94595\n\nShould Dartmouth expand its number of undergraduates? A task force has been appointed to study the possibility of expanding the number of students from 10 to 25 percent; from the present 4,300 undergraduates, the smallest in the Ivy League, to as many as 5,400. New dorms would be required—one possible location might be College Park, near the observatory. Would this change affect the College’s identity? A report from the task force is expected by mid-March. “A larger student body would lead to more graduates, which would amplify our impact on the world,” says President Hanlon.\n\nCongratulations: Tuck School is ranked No. 5 in Forbes’ list of the best business schools in the country. Dartmouth is one of the top 10 “Best Value Schools in America” (determined by academic quality and cost) in a list released by U.S. News & World Report. Former New Jersey Congressman Frank J. Guarini ’46 has doubled his original gift of $10 million to promote foreign study in hopes of improving students’ understanding of the world. Thayer School professor Eric Fossum received the 2017 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering—presented to him by Prince Charles. The Economist lists Professor Douglas Irwin’s book, Clashing Over Commerce, as one of the best books of 2017—it “sets the record straight and in the process elegantly debunks a host of trade policy myths.”\n\nWe should all be congratulating ourselves over the good help our 1943 class fund provides for needy students. This year three students, from California, Oregon and Virginia, were the beneficiaries.\n\nWe are sad to report the deaths of Allen W. Phillips, Harry C. Sayre Jr. and Roy Watson. Our condolences to their families.\n\nThis is my last issue as your class secretary; late middle age is catching up with me. I hope another classmate, or the wife or widow of a classmate, will take over our column so we don’t lose our place in DAM’s Class Notes. Please contact me if you’re interested in the job—it’s not a hard one and is a wonderful way to keep up with college news.\n\nThanks for your support and kind words through the years. God bless!\n\n—John M. Jenkins, 80 Lyme Road, Apt. 304, Hanover, NH 03755; (603) 643-2757; mmjenkins@kahres.org\n\nU.S. News & World Report named Dartmouth seventh nationally in a ranking of “best value schools.” It considered academic quality vs. cost, as well as the percent of students receiving needs-based grants. In another ranking, Forbes magazine has rated Tuck School No. 5 nationally among business schools. The ranking is determined by subtracting the cost of the M.B.A. from total earnings during the first five years after graduation.\n\nThe new Moosilauke Ravine Lodge has opened to rave reviews. Built of white pine from the Dartmouth Grant, its dedication was attended by enthusiastic undergraduates, staff and local alumni.\n\nIn 2013 Frank Guarini ’46, a New Jersey congressman, gave Dartmouth $10 million to establish a new institution to support foreign study. He has now given a second $10 million to expand study abroad opportunities for students, saying, “There is no better way to promote peace in our world than for young people to immerse themselves in different cultures.”\n\nDartmouth’s ban on liquor seems to be effective. In 2016 there were 40 arrests involving liquor, in 2014 there were 100. Sexual abuse cases are also down—33 in 2016 vs. 55 in 2014.\n\nDartmouth might close the golf course. The average yearly deficit during the last four years was $595,000 and membership declined to about 300 in 2016—it was 551 three years ago. The final decision rests with President Hanlon.\n\nWe regret to report the deaths of Charles E. Dorkey Jr., Raymond J. McMahon Jr., Allen W. Phillips and William Porter. Our condolences to their families.\n\n—John M. Jenkins, 80 Lyme Road, Apt. 304, Hanover, NH 03755; (603) 643-2757; mmjenkins@kahres.org\n\nIs bigger better? Dartmouth, currently the smallest college in the Ivy League, is evaluating whether it should increase the present number of undergraduates. Princeton is slightly larger than Dartmouth, while Cornell, the largest, has 14,000 students, a 66-percent increase in the last 15 years. During that same period all Ivy League schools have increased the number of their undergraduates, but Dartmouth’s increases have been small. A task force has been appointed, co-chaired by the dean of the College and the dean of the faculty of arts and sciences. The charge is to come up with a financially feasible plan that could increase the student body between 10 and 25 percent. There are currently 4,310 undergraduates; a maximum increase would take the number to 5,300. Concerns include housing, maintaining an acceptable faculty-student ratio and maintaining the vitality of student life. A report is expected by March 2018.\n\nDartmouth’s campus was voted the fifth loveliest in a list of the country’s 24 most beautiful college campuses. Its citation read, “an Ivy League university and it looks the part.” (Bard was No. 1.)\n\nThis spring Dartmouth celebrated its 45th Pow Wow on the Green featuring traditional dancing, drummers and crafts from all over the country. There are 75 Native American tribal nations represented in the current student body.\n\nA letter from classmate Henry Keck reports that he’s still working and has just published a book titled How Design Changed America, about success and failure in the marketplace. Our congratulations!\n\nAs of June 2, 48, or 7.3 percent, of us remain from our original class of 659.\n\nSomething to think about—a quote from Dartmouth professor of physics and astronomy Marcelo Gleiser: “What’s fascinating is that consciousness is what makes the universe exist.”\n\n—John M. Jenkins, 80 Lyme Road, Apt. 304, Hanover, NH 03755; (603) 643-2757; mmjenkins@kahres.org\n\nThere were 20,034 applicants seeking admittance to the class of 2021; 2,092 (10.4 percent) were accepted, with an expectation that about 1,100 of the 2,002 will choose to become members of the class of 2021. Five hundred forty-seven are either valedictorians or salutatorians; 11 percent are foreign students (from 63 countries); mean SAT scores rose 17 percent over those from a year ago; 59 percent are public school graduates; the group represents 50 states and D.C.; 9 percent are alumni legacies; 15 percent are the first in their families to attend college; and 63 percent need financial aid. California, for the sixth year, had the largest number of applicants, followed by New York.\n\nEffective this fall, Dartmouth’s tuition will be increased 2.9 percent, bringing total costs for one year—tuition, room, board and mandated fees—to $68,000. Ten million dollars, joining an earlier $10 million, has been given by Frank Guarini ’46 to support a foreign study program sending Dartmouth students abroad and bringing foreign students to the Dartmouth campus. Five million dollars has been given to Dartmouth by former trustee Ed Halderman ’70 to be used by the director of athletics “to invest in programs and innovations that boost Dartmouth’s competitive advantage and enhance the students’ athletic experience.” The College has sold a 175-acre farm it owned in Etna, New Hampshire, to the Trust for Public Land. The trust will convey the land to the National Park Service, which will add it to the Appalachian National Scenic Trail.\n\nDuane Compton ’77, a professor of biology and cell chemistry, has been named dean of the Geisel School of Medicine, having presided over a major reorganization there in 2016. Honors to Louise Erdrich ’76, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for her novel, LaRose, and to Tuck Dean Matthew Slaughter, who was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Science.\n\nGood news! No obits to report. Eat your Wheaties.\n\n—John M.

His theme was “The real adventure starts now—persevere.” He wove together many references to Dr. Seuss ’25 before an audience of 10,000 in addition to 1,500 degree recipients.\n\nPresident Hanlon ’77 marked his fourth year as Dartmouth’s president by acknowledging that “there is more to do,” despite substantial improvements such as the independent graduate school, the student cluster housing program and a $160 million energy studies institute.\n\nIn general college news, donations to the Dartmouth College Fund are down slightly, general gifts are up and applications are down 3.1 percent (20,675 to 20,034). But 61 percent of those accepted by Dartmouth, decided to attend—the highest percentage ever.\n\nJames Weinstein, CEO of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, has left and was be replaced by Dr. Joanne Mather Conroy ’77, who is currently CEO of the Lahey Hospital and Medical Center, a Tuft’s School of Medicine affiliate in Burlington, Massachusetts. She has also served in Washington, D.C., as chief healthcare officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\nBob Ehinger reports that our class will continue to provide $2,000 a year for the Henry Eagle Internship. This is our 25th year supporting this program that assists Native American students at Dartmouth.\n\nA recently published children’s book, Skyward Bound, about hot-air ballooning by Morton Pechter and his wife, Alese, has received Mom’s Choice Award for 2017 as best family-friendly book. Alese says that the profit from any sales that come through her will be donated to the class or Dartmouth. The book costs $24.95. Reach them at 1730 S. Federal Highway, Suite 398, Delray Beach, FL 33483.\n\nAgain, no obits to report! Keep up the good news!\n\n—John M. Jenkins, 80 Lyme Road, Apt. 304, Hanover, NH 03755; (603) 643-2757; mmjenkins@kahres.org\n\nThe board of trustees has authorized the schematic design funding for the new $73-million building that will be built at the end of the Tuck Mall to house the Arthur L. Irving Institute of Energy and Design. The College plans to raise an additional $160 million, which, joined with the $80 million given by the Arthur L. Irving Family Foundation, will totally fund the new institute.\n\nDartmouth has joined 16 other universities, including Harvard, Yale and Stanford, in opposing President Trump’s immigration ban. They have filed a legal brief in a New York federal court.\n\nJottings: Eric Fossum, a professor at Thayer School, has just been awarded the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering (the most prestigious engineering prize in his field) for his invention of the image sensor which makes the “selfie” picture possible. CNN anchor Jake Tapper ’91 will deliver the Commencement address in June. The Hood Museum is on The Huffington Post’s list of the top college art and history museums in the Northeast; people come from around the world to see the 3,000-year-old Assyrian reliefs and the Orozco murals. The College is still hoping to update their athletic facilities, even though a recent proposal to build a $20-million indoor practice facility was turned down by the Hanover planning board because of neighbors’ resistance.\n\nWe regretfully report the death of Thomas F. Swick. Our condolences to his family.\n\n—John M. Jenkins, 80 Lyme Road, Apt. 304, Hanover, NH 03755; (603) 643-2757; mmjenkins@kahres.org\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to give Dartmouth $800,000 to finance studies that will advise communities on ways to improve water quality and help them develop plans to make their water cleaner and safer.\n\nBaker Library tower renovations have been completed. The $4-million project refurbished the tower and its spire and replaced the copper roofing. Contributions are still coming in to pay for the replacement of the old 1938 Moosilauke Lodge. We hope it will be finished in time for the traditional DOC gathering of the class of 2021. Dartmouth aims to increase faculty salaries to bring them in line with its Ivy League counterparts. Currently Dartmouth pays a full professor an average of $177,000 a year in salary and benefits. This is roughly $15,000 less than the Ivy League average. A dorm on East Wheelock Street had to be evacuated after a fire on the roof caused by students forgetting about a lit hibachi they had used earlier. The damage was severe enough to make the building uninhabitable for a term.\n\nDartmouth has named Mary Lou Aleskie as the new director of the Hopkins Center, effective this spring. The Hop has a $7.8-million operating budget and presents more than 500 programs a year. For the last 11 years Mary Lou has run the International Festival of Arts and Ideas in New Haven, Connecticut. The 79th Dartmouth student to become a Rhodes scholar is Sarah Waltcher ’16. She is one of 32 students, chosen worldwide, who will study at Oxford University next fall.\n\nCornell’s new president will be Martha Pollack ’76, who is currently provost at the University of Michigan. Did you realize that the lead-off pitcher for the victorious Cubs in the World Series was a Dartmouth grad—Kyle Hendricks ’12? He had the lowest ERA in the Major League this year.\n\nWe are sorry to report the deaths of Robert C. Barnum Jr., William T. Doer Jr., Daniel J. Hurley and William T. Wolf. Our condolences to their families.\n\n—John M. Jenkins, 80 Lyme Road, Apt. 304, Hanover, NH 03755; (603) 643-2757; mmjenkins@kahres.org\n\nDartmouth is moving ahead on plans to expand its western campus near Tuck and Thayer by 459,000 square feet of new buildings. At least five of them will support Tuck, Thayer and the computer science department. A third Thayer School building is already in the planning stage. Also included in the conceptual plan is a path from the Green to the Connecticut River. No date has been set for construction.\n\nA recent $80 million gift from the Arthur L. Irving Foundation and members of the Irving family will help Dartmouth create a new energy research institute. A cross-disciplinary group will work toward solutions to real-world problems such as the reliability of electrical grids and how to protect them. The institute had already received $33 million from other sources and hopes to raise another $160 million.\n\nDartmouth’s endowment dropped 1.9 percent—to $4.5 billion—by the end of the 2016 fiscal year on June 30. The College withdrew $214 million, which was more than replaced by $46 million received in gifts and $350 million earned on investments. Harvard and Penn reported losses, but Yale had a 3.4 percent increase.\n\nOn the academic side, Dartmouth has joined a group of schools across the country that no longer requires students to submit SAT scores with their applications.\n\nOur class president, Howard Leavitt, died on October 13, 2016. Ever loyal to Dartmouth and our class, Howie stepped in as president when we needed him—at the same time continuing his newsletters that kept us up to date on the lives of our classmates. The newsletter will now be discontinued, so please send all personal notes to me and I will incorporate them into the report for the alumni magazine.\n\nWe also sadly report the deaths of Robert J. Fieldsteel, Lee Romanow and Stanley D. Skaug. Our condolences to their families. (All obituaries appear online.) To the 61 of us still hobbling around: Take care, keep warm and don’t give up the ship.\n\n—John M. Jenkins, 80 Lyme Road, Apt. 304, Hanover, NH 03755; (603) 643-2757; mmjenkins@kahres.org\n\nDartmouth has recently completed an action plan for inclusive excellence containing more than three dozen new initiatives as well as enhancements of existing programs. Its aim is to increase diversity and inclusion. The plan, through time, will add 50 new faculty members to the College’s undergraduate and graduate faculties. In addition the plan will work to implement training programs and outreach to combat bias in the workplace and among students.\n\nOf interest: Dartmouth’s President Hanlon has been named to the advisory board of the Guggenheim fellowships. The advisory board reviews fellowship applications. Last spring Provost Carolyn Dever traveled to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to see first-hand the work of a global health project developed by Dartmouth and Muhinbili University of Health of Allied Science. For the first time there were more females than males graduating from Thayer School of Engineering—54 percent. At the same time Dartmouth set a U.S. record as the first national research university to have more women than men receiving engineering degrees.\n\nNine Dartmouth graduates participated in the Olympics in Rio. Six on U.S. teams, one represented Greece, one represented Canada, another South Korea. One of the eight was Abbey D’Agostino ’14, seven-time NCAA champion. Inadvertently during a 5,000-meter qualifying heat, Abbey clipped New Zealand’s Nikki Hamblin. They both fell down. Rather than immediately continuing the race, Abbey stopped and helped Nikki to her feet. They both finished the race, though Abbey suffered a fairly severe knee injury. The media celebrated the incident as a fine example of the Olympic spirit.\n\nLast summer Dartmouth hosted a group of African leaders—Mandela African Fellows—for the third year. The summer program empowers young leaders through academic courses, leadership training, mentoring, networking and professional opportunities and supports activities after they return home. The group at Dartmouth was part of the 1,000-member Mandela Washington Fellows that was hosted across the country in June and July. The program ended with a town hall in Washington, D.C., featuring President Obama.\n\nWe sadly report the death of Warren B. Thompson. Our condolences to his family.\n\n—John M. Jenkins, 80 Lyme Road, Apt. 304, Hanover, NH 03755; (603) 643-2757; mmjenkins@kahres.org\n\nThe class of 2016 graduated on June 12 with 1,867 degrees awarded to students from 48 states, the District of Columbia and 31 foreign countries. Nobel Laureate (2011) Leymah Gbowee, a Liberian human rights activist, delivered the main address. Setting a new record, there were eight valedictorians and seven salutatorians.\n\nMany of the 32 new scholars who joined the Dartmouth faculty in the fall are researching solutions to challenging problems in medicine, business and the arts and sciences. A new institute for cross-disciplinary engagement at Dartmouth has been created. Headed by Marcelo Gleiser, the Appleton Professor of Natural Philosophy, it will explore the limits of human nature, the nature of time, consciousness and reality itself. Professor Mary Lou Guerinot has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences in recognition of her distinguished and continuing achievements in original research.\n\nShe is one of 84 new members and 21 foreign associates from 14 countries. The National Science Foundation has awarded 17 research fellowships to Dartmouth students and alumni. The 2,000 national winners were chosen from 17,000 applicants. Five students and recent graduates have been offered Fulbright fellowships. Another three have been offered German academic exchange service fellowships. Twenty-five million dollars has been given toward the planned expansion of Thayer School—the number of engineering students has doubled in the last 15 years. The Hood Museum, which closed last March in preparation for its expansion, has opened a gallery in downtown Hanover in an empty store near the Nugget.\n\nEffective September 1, Richard Lifton ’75 will become the 11th president of Rockefeller University. A collection of 2,500 photographs covering the development of planned towns in southwestern France has been given to Cornell by the photographer (and Cornell professor emeritus) John Reps. He has studied the towns during a 60-year period and the digital collection allows viewers to compare the images through time.\n\nAlexis Pappas ’12 will be a member of the Greek Olympic team in 2016. She’s among the fastest seven American women in the 5,000- and 10,000-meter class.\n\nGood news! No obits to report. Stay well.\n\n—John M. Jenkins, 80 Lyme Road, Apt. 304, Hanover, NH 03755; (603) 643-2757; mmjenkins@kahres.org\n\nThe only advantage of being my age that I can think of is that I’m not applying to Dartmouth now. Look at these frightening statistics for the class of 2020: Of the 20,675 applicants, 10.5 percent were accepted; 94 percent come from the top 10 percent of their classes; 37.1 percent are valedictorians; the mean SAT scores are 737 (critical reading), 741 (math) and 741 (writing).\n\nAdditional interesting statistics: 51.6 percent are students of color; 63 percent come from public schools; 8.2 percent come from 60 foreign countries; 8.1 percent are children of alumni; 48 percent qualify for financial aid ($40.2 million total scholarships offered).\n\nIn a recent survey of more than 13,000 current and former business school students, Tuck ranked No. 1 for best value among the top 25 business schools in the world—students felt they earned the best education for the price.\n\nStudent activists at Dartmouth have persuaded the U.S. Library of Congress that the phrase “illegal alien” should no longer be used to describe non-citizens who lack legal residency status. Beginning in May or June all catalogs using English language headings worldwide will replace the word “alien” with “non-citizen.” The word “alien” is outmoded and prone to misunderstanding.\n\nA new, $20 million, 70,000-square-foot field house is planned for a site near Thompson Arena. It will be an indoor facility to allow student athletes a longer window to practice in cold weather. It will particularly help athletes involved with spring sports. The College hopes to start construction in November, with completion in November 2017.\n\nFormer Dartmouth President Jim Wright, a former Marine, is slated to join the board of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. Founded in 2004, the nonprofit organization has provided more than 1.2 million veterans with resources and access to a community of their peers and given at least 5,000 former soldiers support from the group’s social workers.\n\nWe sadly report the deaths of Seth J. Washburn, Roy H. Kirch Jr., Joseph G. Hirschberg and James B. Malley—who led so many of our reunion memorial services. Our condolences to their families.\n\n—John M. Jenkins, 80 Lyme Road, Apt. 304, Hanover, NH 03755; (603) 643-2757; mmjenkins@kahres.org\n\nDartmouth has reached its goal of $100 million, the amount needed to establish 10 new academic clusters, which will focus on urgent world challenges ranging from global poverty to cybersecurity. This will create 30 new faculty positions. Two Dartmouth students joined 109 other students, chosen from 3,000 applicants from 135 countries, in receiving Schwarzman scholarships to study at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. Schwarzman’s aim is “to build a global network of talented young leaders helping to bring stronger links between China and a rapidly changing world.” They will receive M.A.s in public policy, economics and business, and international studies.\n\nDartmouth has recently welcomed two international conferences. The first, in January, on health and wellness in the Arctic, was hosted by the Institute of Arctic Studies at the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding. It sought solutions relating to Arctic climate changes, mineral rights, shipping routes and the protection of indigenous people. The second conference, in February, also hosted by the Dickey Center, assessed the response to the April 2015 earthquake in Nepal that killed 8,000 people.\n\nIn January John Stomberg became the new director of Dartmouth’s Hood Museum. A specialist in American and European art, he was the former director of Mount Holyoke’s art museum and, before that was affiliated with the Williams College and Boston University art museums. He’s arriving just in time to become involved in Hood’s $50 million expansion, which will get underway in March of this year.\n\nTwenty thousand, five hundred and fifty applications have been received for the class of 2020. Of the 1,927 applicants for early decision, 494 were accepted—a 3.4-percent increase. Free tuition is available for students whose parents earn less than $100,000 a year; scholarships average $46,315; average student debt at graduation is $16,339—one half the national average.\n\nEarlier this year Dartmouth closed another fraternity. Sigma Alpha Epsilon is no longer recognized by Dartmouth, and its charter has been revoked by its parent organization because of alcohol-related hazing.\n\nWe sadly report the death of Robert M. Hamill.\n\n—John M. Jenkins, 80 Lyme Road, Apt. 304, Hanover, NH 03755; (603) 643-2757; mmjenkins@kahres.org\n\nThe recent u"
