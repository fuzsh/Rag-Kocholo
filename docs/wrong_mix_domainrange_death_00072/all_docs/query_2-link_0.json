        "text": "It started with heartbreak and loss in Japan and ended in pride and triumph in the U.S.A.\n\nHe was a boy during World War II when his two older brothers, both kamikaze pilots, died fighting for Japan.\n\nThere were times when his family didn’t even have rice. They subsisted on sweet potatoes and whatever they foraged.\n\nYoung Yoshi taught himself English by listening to country music on U.S. military radio.\n\nHis spoken English echoed his native Japan but he sang like he came from a holler in the South.\n\nAt 17, he started entertaining U.S. troops in Occupied Japan.\n\nWhen he performed “Your Cheatin’ Heart,” the homesick Americans let him know he’d captured Hank Williams’ indictment of faithlessness by shouting: “Hank! Hank! Hank!”"
