And be nice to people.' And that's the way I handled myself, and people were very, very nice to me,\" Mr Campbell told The Telegraph in 2011.\n\nHis musical career started in the early years of rock 'n roll and he toured with the Champs of \"Tequilla\", he was part of the house band for the ABC TV show Shindig! and a member of Phil Spector's \"Wrecking Crew\" studio band that played on hits by the Ronettes, the Righteous Brothers and the Crystals.\n\nHe also played guitar on Frank Sinatra's 'Strangers In the Night', The Monkees' 'I'm a Believer' and Elvis Presley's 'Viva Las Vegas'.\n\n\"We'd get the rock 'n' roll guys and play all that, then we'd get Sinatra and Dean Martin,\" Mr Campbell told The Associated Press in 2011. \"That was a kick. I really enjoyed that. I didn't want to go nowhere. I was making more money than I ever made just doing studio work.\"\n\nHe released more than 70 albums and in the 1990s recorded a series of gospel CDs. In 2011, his farewell album Ghost on the Canvas included contributions from Jacob Dylan, Rick Nielsen of Cheap Trick and Billy Cogan of Smashing Pumpkins.\n\nWorld news in pictures\n\nShow all 50\n\nThe documentary Glen Campbell...I'll Be Me came out in 2014 offering a poignant testimony of how the guitar virtuoso continued to shine while his mind unravelled from Alzheimer's disease.\n\nMr Campbell confide he suffered for his fame and drank heavily, used drugs and indulged in a turbulent relationship with country singer Tanya Tucker in the early 1980s.\n\nAmong his life's work, his song Rhinestone Cowboy became his own personal anthem. Originally written and recorded by Larry Weiss in 1974, his own version topped the chart in 1975.\n\n\"I thought it was my autobiography set to song,\" he wrote in his autobiography also titled Rhinestone Cowboy.\n\nMr Campbell, who was married four times, is survived by his wife Kim Campbell, their three children Cal, Shannon and Ashley and his children from previous marriages Debby, Kelli, Travis, Kane and Dillon and ten grandchildren.\n\nThe legendary guitarist announced that he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2011.\n\nThe family has set up a donation page for Alzheimer's research.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
