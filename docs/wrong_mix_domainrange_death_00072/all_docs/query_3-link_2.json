Through these candid interviews we get a glimpse of the boy behind the legend. We explore his uncanny ability to write lyrics well beyond his years and limited education. We search for the secret of his amazing destiny in the humble beginnings of his short, tumultuous life.\n\nThe University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) will handle station relations for \"Hank Williams, Sr.: Along for the Ride.\" Gayle Loeber and NETA are distributing the documentary and have set up a feed for Sunday, April 3, 2005 @ 1930-2030 ET/513.

More than fifty years later he is considered by many to be the greatest country songwriter of all time. But before the recording contracts, the sold-out tours — before the Grand Ole Opry made him a household word — he was a skinny country boy with a passion. Those who were with him as his career unfolded — from singing on street corners as a shoe-shine boy to international acclaim as one of country music’s greatest stars — look back at his short life and magical rise to stardom.\n\nToday many people think the name Hank Williams belongs exclusively to a current country music star. Perhaps lesser known by today’s fans, his father was a legendary songwriter. He authored such hits as “Hey Good Lookin’”, “Your Cheatin’ Heart”, “Jambalaya”, “I Saw the Light”, “Take These Chains”, “Honky Tonkin’”, “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry” – the list goes on and on.\n\nThe stories about his short life &3151; like his tragic death — come in many varieties, as they have grown and changed in the telling over the years. To find out what Hank’s life was really like, we have found those of Hank’s early band members who are still with us. (Many of them have passed on to that great Honky Tonk in the sky.) Their interviews are presented here with rare photographs and a story line that takes the viewer through the entire life and death of the late, great Hank Williams, Sr.\n\nDIRECTOR'S NOTE\n\nWhat makes this Hank Williams documentary different from the others? It’s no surprise that the story of Hank Williams, Sr. has captured the imagination of other filmmakers through the years. Produced out of Hollywood, most of these films center around his Nashville years — his stardom and the rapport he had with the other stars from the Grand Ole Opry. This documentary is an Alabama story told by Alabama folk.\n\nHow did we happen to make this documentary? My co-producer, Larry Powell, grew up in Georgiana, Alabama. Larry asked me to work with him in bringing an “early years” perspective to Hank’s life story. (Many of Hank’s early band members have never been interviewed by the “big shots.”) Larry is a researcher and Hank buff; I am a filmmaker and musician. The pairing seemed right to take on such a task. Hank’s early bandmates are getting older, for each year one or two are missing at the annual Hank Williams Festival in Georgiana. Larry felt an urgency to get their stories on film.\n\nI hope you enjoy this ride along the “lost highway”— as we follow together the threads that make up the still-living fabric of the life and music of Hank Williams, Sr.\n\nJune Mack\n\nFILMMAKERS' BIOGRAPHIES\n\nJune Mack, Producer-Director\n\nJune Mack’s films have won 22 international awards in film festivals around the world including the The International Television Movie Festival, The Ft.
