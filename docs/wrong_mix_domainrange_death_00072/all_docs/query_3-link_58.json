        "text": "Margaret N. Caldwell was a loving, generous, and loyal wife, mother, grandmother and friend. She left this world surrounded by family on February 11, 2022 at age 97. She is survived by children David and Ellen Caldwell, Christine and Tim Keiper, Susan McCracken and grandchildren Jenna, Amy, Matthew Keiper, Leah McCracken, Kelly and Austin Hudspeth and Isaac and Lianna McCracken who are expecting Margaret’s first great grandson. She was preceded in death by her parents Vincent and Ramona, husband, Jack Caldwell, and son-in-law Kurt McCracken.\n\nMargaret was born and grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, went to Colorado University in Boulder, CO and was a PE teacher in Denver where she met and married Jack Caldwell. They moved to Fort Morgan, CO where she loved raising her three children, opened her home to foster children, and became a successful business woman opening one of the first travel agencies in NE Colorado. After retiring, Margaret and Jack moved to Columbia, Missouri and then Las Cruces, NM.\n\nMargaret loved politics and wrote letters to the editor for local newspapers. She often wrote under the pen name Joy Nast at the request of her husband, who was wary of repercussions with friends. She kept a notebook of published letters and delighted in going back and reading them and the passionate responses they sometimes generated. After retirement she often faxed politicians in Washington late into the night.\n\nMargaret's favorite Bible verse was John 3:16 and she would open prayers with, \"We thank thee Father for thy many blessings...\" She valued a sermon rich with scripture and didn't have much good to say about one featuring quotes from Readers Digest. She highly valued her family’s Christian heritage.\n\nWith age, Margaret became ever more sweet, loving and appreciative of friends and family. As a senior citizen she often delighted others with her sense of humor and ability to laugh at herself. Recently Margaret dreamt she died and reported, “I couldn't remember my life or who I was.” When asked how that felt she replied, chuckling, “Normal! I can't remember anything anyway!” After being told by the hospice doctor that she probably had just a few short months to live she quipped, \"Before I die, I need to go to the bathroom.\" \"Please bring me some candy. That's my final request.\"\n\nMargaret loved music, especially jazz and classical. She asked that Aaron Copeland’s “Fanfare for the Common Man” be played at her funeral saying, “That would open up the gates of heaven for me. ‘Knock, knock! I’m here! Ready or not!’”\n\nA celebration of Margaret’s life, featuring “Fanfare for the Common Man,” will be held at 11:00 am on February 22, 2022 in Evans Memorial Chapel, Denver, CO. This will be followed by a lunch reception at the Brown Palace Hotel where Jack and Margaret had their wedding reception February 24, 1951, 71 years ago.\n\nSally Lou Duman, age 97, of Port Washington, WI, formerly of Fredonia passed away peacefully Saturday, September 16, 2023 at Forest Haven Assisted Living in Fredonia.\n\nShe was born on February 16, 1926 in Beaver Dam, WI; daughter of Dr. Rob Roy and Ruth Violet Zepherin Roberts. Sally Lou graduated from Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, later attending Ripon College. She would receive a degree in Occupational Therapy from Marquette University. After working in that field for a short period of time, Sally Lou was a court clerk at the Ozaukee County Circuit Courts Branch 2 under Judge Warren Grady.\n\nIn the early 1960’s, Sally Lou became the first female Customer Service Representative for Wisconsin Electric, serving five townships. As Office Manager in 1991 after over 30 years, she retired. During this time she received a degree from the Milwaukee School of Engineering in 1981.\n\nOn January 24, 1968, Sally Lou married William L. “Hopper” Duman at her parent’s home in Mosinee, WI. They resided in Fredonia for many years, moving to Port Washington in 1991. He preceded her in death on December 28, 2006.\n\nDuring her life, Sally was a member of the Delta Phi Sigma sorority, life member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars 5373 Auxiliary, past Worthy Matron of Eastern Star Ozaukee Chapter 147 and the Port Washington Senior Center. She and her husband enjoyed many winters in Texas and she was very proud of her Scottish heritage.\n\nSally Lou is survived by her children Dean (Marlene) Duman of Flower Mound, TX, Perry Duman of Port Washington and Robin Richardson of Cedarburg; grandchildren Erin (Justin) Killeen and Kimberly Richardson, two great grandchildren, her brother Rob Roy Roberts of LaCrosse, nieces, nephews, other relatives and friends. She is preceded in death by her husband Hopper, her sister Dorothy Jane Whitney and her husband Ralph, her brother Norman Dean Roberts and her granddaughter Jessica-Anne Duman.\n\nWe celebrate Sally Lou’s life at 1PM Friday, September 22, 2023 at Open Door Bible Church, 3420 County Road LL, Port Washington, WI. Relatives and friends can gather from 12Noon until time of Service at 1PM. Interment will take place at Union Cemetery in Port Washington.\n\nMemorials to Open Door Bible Church appreciated.\n\nOn Thursday, June 18, 2021, F. Addison Jones, loving husband, father, and grandfather passed away at the age of 92 at the Mayflower Community Health Care Center in Grinnell.\n\nAddison was born on December 17, 1928, in Tama, IA to Fred A. (F. A.) and Alice Josephine Jones. He moved to Grinnell with his parents in the summer of 1940 which would become his lifelong home. Addison attended school in Grinnell from seventh grade through his sophomore year in high school before he attended Wayland Academy in Beaverdam, WI. As he recalled throughout his life “My folks had decided I’d go to Grinnell College and thought it would be a good experience if I had some time away at school.”\n\nAddison graduated from Wayland Academy in 1946. As a proud Grinnellian, his Grinnell High School graduating class of ’46 always welcomed him to class reunions over the years even though his junior and senior years were spent at Wayland Academy. “Going to Wayland turned out to be very important in my life. I met my wife, friend, love…my everything to me.”\n\nFollowing high school, Addison returned to Grinnell to play football at Grinnell College and was awarded as an All-Conference Center in ’48-’49. He received his Bachelor of Arts from Grinnell College in 1950.\n\nOn August 12, 1950, Addison married the love of his life, Marion Austin Jones. They raised three sons, Stephen Jones (’53), David Jones (’56), and F. Austin Jones (’64). Together they raised the boys in the house Addison built for them in 1960.\n\nHis professional career began at Ottumwa High School from ’50-’51 where Addison taught math. He then worked at a bank in Chicago from ’51-’52 before becoming a Lieutenant in the Coast Guard. During his two years in the Coast Guard, he served out of Cleveland, OH, and Grand Haven, MI.\n\nHe returned to Grinnell in 1954 to begin his nearly lifelong career at Grinnell State Bank. During his 67 years, he attended the Graduate School of Banking Madison, WI from ’55-’58, was named the Bank President in ’72, and named the CEO and Chairman of the Board in ’76. He was proud to work alongside his father, sons, and grandchildren. Addison continued to work at the bank through January 2021.\n\nAddison had many passions including boating on the Mississippi River, fishing, and woodworking. Not only did Addison build his home but he also built two boats, Ad’s Venture and Ad’s Venture II. He enjoyed “snowbirding” to Northern Mississippi in Guttenburg, IA as well as exploring the world with Marion and friends. He enjoyed meals spent with his family, dancing with Marion, playing bridge and hearts with friends, and, of course, indulging in the occasional Manhattan.\n\nThroughout his life, Addison was involved in Greater Grinnell Development, Kiwanis, Free Masons, Iowa Bankers Association, and the American Institute of Banking (AIB).\n\nAddison was preceded in death by his wife (Marion), oldest son (Steve), father (Fred), mother (Josephine), and sister (Florence). He is survived by his two younger sons, Dave (Lori) and Austin (Kim), seven grandchildren, Tony, Rusty, David Aric, Hillary, Alyson, Kelsey, and Miranda as well as ten great-grandchildren, Brent, Cole, Carson, Bella, Peyton, Finn, Laney, Tessa, Jaxon, and Emilia, one great-great-grandchild, Peyton, and his sister, Esther (Jones) Bethel.\n\nIf you are reading this, or if it’s being read to you, it’s because I have checked into a new place with no area codes, zip codes, computer applications, or passwords to remember.\n\nIt all began for me on August 29, 1932, when Dr. Dean Burns delivered me to James and Vergene (Glidden) Whitfield, at the old Petoskey Hospital on Lake Street. Growing up on Walloon Lake was anything but a hardship. Summers were spent building sandcastles, swimming, waterskiing, and attending Camp Daggett. Winters were equally traumatic with activities centered around sledding, tobogganing, ice-skating, and building snowmen. I went to Central Elementary School in Petoskey through the fourth grade.\n\nWhen WWII started, my parents, brothers, George and Jim, and sister, Dorothy moved to Saginaw where my father worked as an engineer designing aircraft propellers at the Chevrolet Plant. The new urban environment introduced me to jacks (also known as knucklebones), hopscotch, softball, and Saturday afternoon matinees. If you don’t know what some of these are, just” google” them.\n\nFollowing a family tradition, in 1945, I began attending high school at Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, WI, graduating in 1949.\n\nWhile attending Central Michigan University, I met my husband, Pierce Erb, and we were married for 68 years before he passed away in 2019. We raised a wonderful daughter, Deborah, who had the good sense to marry Gary Green, the best son-in-law one could have. Their lovely daughter, Erin, also had the good sense to marry my terrific grandson-in-law, Daham Sol. Both Pierce and I always felt very fortunate to have had such a caring, supportive, fun family.\n\nAs for my working years, it all began in 1944, behind a lunch counter in Saginaw, after I received my Social Security card at the age of 12. In the ensuing years, I worked at Gattle’s Linens, Maters Boat Works, Petoskey Beverage Company, and Boyne Mountain, in bookkeeping and office management positions.\n\nCommunity service was always important to me, which led to my being the Melrose Township clerk for 16 years, and later, treasurer of the Crooked Tree Library. In the late 1990s, interest developed in having a dedicated building for the library at Walloon Lake and I soon became involved with that worthwhile effort. As members of The Friends of the Library, Cynthia Hermann collaborated with me to publish Walloon Yesterdays, a pictorial history of Walloon Lake, with proceeds going towards maintaining the new library.\n\nRetirement was another wonderful time of my life. It afforded me more time for two favorite past times, downhill skiing and traveling. Pierce and I camped and skied our way through the United States together. I was later joined by various friends on wonderful trips to New Zealand, the fjords of Norway, the Swiss Alps, and other European destinations.\n\nWith the passing of time and children in our lives, I joined several Petoskey ladies with whom I met monthly for pot-luck lunches while the kids were in school. We remained a very close-knit group for well over 50 years. There were also several ladies who played an important role in my life. Katie Littmann, whom I have known since I was eight, Cynthia Hermann, Rosemary Renwick, Penny Marshall, Sheryl Goodrich, and Rose Thelen are especially dear to me. My family and I would also like to thank Hospice of Michigan and the Comfort Keepers for the loving care they gave me.\n\nAs you probably know, it is always sad to lose someone you love, and I dearly miss those who preceded me in death, my parents; my husband, Pierce; my brother, George, and his two sons, Gary and Steve; my sister, Dorothy, her husband, Walter Ericks, and their daughter, Judy.\n\nMy survivors include my brother, Jim Whitfield; daughter, Debbie (Gary) Green; granddaughter, Erin (Daham) Sol; niece, Lynn Ardman; nephews, Mark, Scott & JC Whitfield, David and Walter Ericks, and numerous cousins.\n\nI will end with the following, “Life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and proclaiming, WOW, What a ride!!”\n\nBy the way, please consider donations in my memory to the Crooked Tree District Library (CTDL), PO Box 518, Walloon Lake, MI. 49796.\n\nThe very best to all of you…. Love, Mary.\n\nJune 18, 1930 - July 16, 2021\n\nClyman, WI - Aaron R. Klink, Sr., 91, of Clyman, died on Friday, July 16, 2021, with family and loved ones always with him during his final days.\n\nAaron was born to Vincent Paul and Isabel Katherine (Schultz) Klink on June 18, 1930, in Juneau. He grew up in the Juneau area, as his parents managed the Dodge County Hospital from 1938-66.\n\nHe graduated from Juneau High School with the Class of 1948. He also attended Wayland Academy college preparatory school in Beaver Dam.\n\nHe proudly served in the U.S. Marines from 1950-55, aboard the USS Princeton aircraft carrier (CVA-37) during the Korean War.\n\nAaron and Shirley Mae (Torke) Klink married at St. John the Baptist Catholic Church in Clyman on June 19, 1965, after they first met at \"The Blew Inn.\" It was rumored he went there to see the beautiful new waitress, and they remained together until his death.\n\nHe graduated with a teaching degree from the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. His first teaching position was with the Tripoli School District in Lincoln and Oneida counties. He moved back south during the 1960s, teaching high school biology at Oak Creek High School in Milwaukee County for almost 30 years before retiring in the early 1990s.\n\nMany of his summers were spent Up North in Sawyer County, at the cabin on Blueberry Lake. It was there he relaxed, fished, swam, drank beer and participated in countless unforgettable moments with his family.\n\nIn fall, he was often found in front of the television when the Green Bay Packers were playing. His shouts of \"Go! Go! Go!\" could be heard through the house whenever the Packers were headed for the end zone.\n\nLater in autumn, his attention always turned to deer hunting. He would leave in November for \"the deer hunting shack\" near Pittsville and stayed in the blind from sunup to sundown to get his buck.\n\nWhen school let out for the summer each year, the trailer was packed, covered with a tarp and tied down for the 365 mile journey north. The family again was headed for another unforgettable summer at Blueberry Lake.\n\nAaron did whatever was necessary to keep the family together, from getting part-time jobs when times were tough to buying all the best toys he could afford for birthdays and Christmas. His family always came first, and that will always be remembered about him.\n\nAfter retiring from teaching and having had his fill of life around the big cities of southern Wisconsin, he returned to his Dodge County roots. Aaron and Shirley settled back in Clyman, eventually buying a home in the small, rural village where they were married.\n\nAaron is survived by his wife, Shirley of Clyman and his children, Curt (Holly) of Cheyenne, Wyo., Luke of Ladysmith, Vin (Veronica) of Upper Marlboro, Md., Theresa of East Troy, Aaron Jr. of Watertown and Nick of Clyman. He is also survived by his sister, Carol (William \"Bud\"-deceased) Gahlman and Ken Klink, both of Juneau. He is further survived by his grandchildren, Matthew, Brandon and Joey.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents; his brother, Florian \"Jack\" and his sister, Karen (Quinn-deceased) Zingsheim. The family thanks nurses and staff who cared tremendously for Aaron at Watertown Regional Medical Center, Highland House Assisted Living in Watertown and Rainbow Hospice Care in Watertown.\n\nMayna Avent Nance, of Sewanee, Tennessee, passed away May 13, 2020 in Signal Mountain, Tennessee at the age of 87 from complications after a fall late last year. She led a full and eventful life and, until late last year, was living independently with her husband Walter Nance.\n\nHer story is one that is intertwined between Tennessee and China with paths via New York and Virginia.\n\nMayna Rose Avent was born on June 17, 1932 in Tientsin (Tianjin) China, the daughter of Standard Vacuum Oil of China (later Mobil Oil) manager James Avent, Sr., of Nashville, Tennessee and Jeanette nee’ Nelson of Dekalb, Illinois. Apart from the interregnum of the Second World War, the Avents lived in several cities in China until 1949, including Tientsin, Tsingtao, and Shanghai. During the Second World War, Mayna lived with her family in New York and returned to Shanghai after the war, living there until 1948. In 1949 her parents returned to the town of her father’s alma mater, the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. There they purchased a grand house overlooking Lost Cove, establishing a long-term family base from that time until 2020.\n\nIt was during the China years that Mayna’s Auntie Harriet met and married a young Annapolis graduate named Dudley “Mush” Morton. Morton went on to command the famed WWII US submarine Wahoo. While the Avents were living in Tsingtao, China, in a house on the coast of the Yellow Sea, Jim Avent flew an American flag on a flagpole overlooking the ocean. In 1943, during the height of war between Japan and the US, Morton was able to clandestinely reveal Wahoo’s patrol area, which are normally secret, when he wrote in a letter home to Mayna and the Avents “I saw your flagpole today.”\n\nMayna’s children grew up hearing stories of China from this time ranging from military battles and epidemics to Mayna’s father meeting local leaders and facing mortal danger. Many other stories were more lighthearted. Such as how her father ended up in China in the first place in 1919, after going to the wrong personnel department at Standard Oil in New York. Or when, after the War, Mayna, her mother, sister and brother arrived back in Shanghai via ship from New York to rejoin her father, bringing a frozen turkey and an air conditioner - the latter they believed was one of the first in Shanghai. The summer heat and humidity in the city were so unbearable that Mayna, her sister, and brother would quietly sneak into the master bedroom at night where the air conditioner was located. She would brag that she paid 200,000 dollars for a hotdog in Shanghai in 1948 (hyperinflated Chinese dollars that is).\n\nMayna was an active artist throughout her life. Drawing inspiration from her father’s mother, noted artist Mayna Treanor Avent, Mayna Nance expressed herself in a variety of media including oil painting, drawings, pastels, ink etching, watercolors, photography, and printing of various types using wood block, linoleum, and metal etching. She attended the Parson’s School of Design in New York.\n\nMayna met her first husband, Daniel MacKinnon of Oshkosh, Wisconsin while attending Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. With Dan, she had three children, Michael, Andrew, and Bryan, all born in Los Angeles. They later settled in Sewanee and then in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nMayna’s second husband is Dr. Walter E. Nance. The Nance and Avent families have been friends for many years, starting from the days in China before the War. Walter was Professor and Chair (emeritus) of the Department of Human Genetics of the Virginia Commonwealth University. Walter and Mayna lived in Richmond, Virginia and finally Sewanee, and traveled the world while Walter would lecture, conduct research, and photograph anything and everything and Mayna would pursue her artistic projects. They both shared a great love of cooking and entertaining friends and family.\n\nOne of Mayna Nance’s lasting contributions was the establishment of her grandmother’s cabin-studio on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994 as the Mayna Treanor Avent Studio, also known as the Avent-Ownby Cabin. The Avent family have been visitors and explorers in the Great Smoky Mountains since the early 20th century. In 1918, her grandparents purchased an authentic pioneer mountain cabin built around 1850 that Mayna Nance’s father James converted to a summer studio for his mother Mayna Treanor Avent before the establishment of the Smoky Mountains National Park. After the Cabin was returned to the National Park in 1992, Mayna Nance led a successful drive to have the structure listed on the National Register. You are welcome to go visit, provided you can find it after a slightly strenuous hike up the side of a mountain and across a creek deep into the woods. Just remember to sweep the floor and close the doors before you leave!\n\nAs China began opening up in the 1980s, Mayna was one of the early Western travelers back to China, first as part of semi-official delegations and later jointly with her husband Walter. Both were contributors to their Alma Mater, The Shanghai American School, and were invited lecturers there.\n\nThough Mayna’s passing was not due to COVID-19, the current global situation restricted who could be at her bedside. Nonetheless, technology greatly assisted as Mayna’s overseas and Tennessee families were able to be with her in her final hours. She was shown her artwork and photos of her family and was able to listen to a recording of her father and mother recounting life in China.\n\nMayna is survived by her husband Walter, her sons Michael (Carol) MacKinnon and Bryan (Chikako) MacKinnon, eight grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. She is predeceased by her parents James and Jeanette Avent, her sister and brother Jacqueline and James Avent (Jr), her first husband Daniel MacKinnon, her son Andrew MacKinnon, and her granddaughter Tiffany MacKinnon Allen.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please send a donation in Mayna’s memory to either of\n\n• The Jacqueline Avent Sewanee Summer Music Festival Scholarship Prize at the University of the South.

Halverson, 91, of Beloit, WI, passed away on Saturday, June 22, 2024 at Cedar Crest, Janesville, WI.\n\nHe was born March 17, 1933 in Beloit, WI, the son of Harold and Helen (Cormican) Halverson. Peter attended all of his school years in Beloit Schools with the exception of his junior high year, which he attended at Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, WI. He returned to Beloit and graduated from Beloit High School. Pete was not interested in college, so he dropped out of the University of Wisconsin and Beloit College. He then went to the South Beloit Airport and obtained a private pilot's license from Russ Van Galder. He loved flying and also obtained a multi engine rating. Pete married Nancy Thorpe on February 27, 1954 in Delavan, WI.\n\nAt age 18, Pete went to work at the Beloit Foundry Company, the family-owned business since 1900. He became Vice President and later President after his father retired. Pete was very fond of his employees and remodeled a building across from the foundry as an employee lounge. There was a nice kitchen, pool table, card tables, television, a fireplace, and outside a horseshoe and basketball court. All the employees had a card that gave them access at any time. They used the building for birthday parties and many other affairs. The foundry had many benefits that no other local firms had. Harold Halverson put in health insurance before GM `Plant in Janesville had it. Pete put in dental insurance, profit sharing, more paid hours for holidays and vacations. In the last years before the foundry was sold, Pete put all his employees on salary, which gave them eight weeks off for any reason with pay. The benefit was never abused. In 1978, the foundry was sold to Beloit Corporation and one year later they shut it down after 79 successful years.\n\nPete was a charter member of the Turtle Township volunteer Fire Department and helped build the addition to the building on the Dougan Farm that housed the fire engine. He was a member of the Beloit Jaycees and served as president in 1957-58. In February of 1960 the Jaycees awarded Pete the second National Bank Trophy as outstanding Jaycee of the year. He was elected to the board of Beloit Memorial Hospital in 1964 and later was board president during the planning and construction of the new hospital. Pete hired the architect and the fundraiser and spent about 20 hours a week at the hospital during the construction period. In 1970, Peter was elected to the board of the First National Bank & Trust Company and served 47 years which was the longest serving director at that time.\n\nPete and two partners built the Hatch Cover Restaurant in Middleton, WI. The restaurant was very successful as it had a limited menu and used only the top-quality food, and had a wonderful service from the staff that was all university students, the oldest one was 22 years old. Peter and his partners sold the restaurant after three successful years.\n\nIn 1992, Pete purchased Rock River Shores the manufactured housing community on the Rock River. It took several years to get it updated and new homes installed, but after that happened it became a very successful community. He sold it in 2015 after 23 years.\n\nPete was a people person and always wanted to know your story. If he met a person, he would find out what they did for a living and what their interests were and then relate to them on some level. He always saw the good in people and was very generous with employees, friends and family.\n\nSurvivors include his wife of 71 years, Nancy Halverson; two sons, John Halverson of Beloit, WI, and Robert (Vicki) Halverson of Edgerton, WI; and a sister, Helen Lindquist of Florida.\n\nJames P. Keating Jr. — known to family and friends as “Jim” or “Pete” — slipped away peacefully on Sunday, October 1st. Jim has been reunited with Sally (née Eiff), his beloved wife of 64 years. He was born in Neenah on February 16th 1934, where he lived and worked until his passing. Born to James P. Keating Sr. and Katherine Keating (née Aylward), he had a strong sense of place, proud of his family's deep roots in Neenah and of his commitment to the community.\n\nJim graduated from Wayland Academy at 17, and went on to earn a double degree in business and mechanical engineering from the University of Wisconsin. He liked to joke that he didn’t need to specify Madison, since there was only one UW campus when he graduated in ’57. Jim spent his career at the Neenah Foundry, where he served as the Vice President of Manufacturing, as well as President of Hartley Controls and Neenah Trucking. He was active in the foundry industry at the state, national, and international levels. He served as chairman of the Wisconsin chapter of the National Foundry Association, and worked with his colleagues in Germany and Alabama to help bring state-of-the-art molding and casting technology to Neenah.\n\nJim made friends wherever he went, never forgetting a name or face, and always gave — and received — a smile, a laugh, and a handshake. He knew — and remembered — people from all walks and areas of his life. In addition to his distinguished professional career, he was an active volunteer in the community.\n\nJim served for many years on the board of directors at the Neenah-Menasha YMCA, helping manage at a time of extensive reorganization and the addition of a new meter pool and diving well. He had a vested interest: He was an avid swimmer, doing laps at lunchtime for most of his adult life, was the diving coach for the girls’ swim team, and organized two swimming expeditions across Lake Winnebago, from Neenah to High Cliff.\n\nAmong his proudest associations was with the Boys’ and Girls’ Brigade. Known to most as “Pete,” he served as a leader, a board member — always looking forward to weekends with the rough craftsmen at Camp Onaway — but most importantly as the founder of the canoe club. The canoe club was Pete’s brainchild. Pete began his canoeing days as a camper at Kooch-I-Ching in the 1940s — the old days of wood-and-canvas canoes — and brought that spirit of backcountry camping to The Brigade. The canoe club began with middle schoolers taking easy overnight trips on the Little Wolf River, gradually evolved to add whitewater training on the “big” Wolf, and from there trips down nearly every major whitewater river in Wisconsin. The canoe club culminated in extended 7-10 day trips to the Canadian wilderness, including the Quetico and across Ontario and Saskatchewan. Through the canoe club Pete — affectionately known as “The Bourgeois” in honor of the French fur trappers — introduced scores of teen boys and girls to true wilderness. Outside of The Brigade, Pete had a lifetime of wilderness canoeing with friends and family that extended to Manitoba, the Northwest Territories, Labrador and Alaska. He was a card-carrying patron of the untrammeled spaces, part old-time explorer and part Thoreau. There aren’t many people who have logged more miles in a canoe and shared that passion with others.\n\nMusic was one of Jim’s great loves and favorite pastimes. He was a multi-instrumentalist and charter member of the Neenah Community Band, where he played clarinet and the occasional tenor sax. Music was one of his great gifts to his friends, and especially his family. He liked to play boogie-woogie on the piano — at the Kappa Sig house, more than a few old uprights were rolled out to the end of the dock for sing-alongs, and legend has it that some ended up in Lake Mendota. And there are many, many fond memories of music by the campfire. Backing his strong tenor with the guitar, Jim would lead the group in camp songs and the songs of his folk and blues heroes — a special treat was the vaudeville act of Jim and Sally performing “The Bum Song.”\n\nJames is survived by his two sisters: Mary Keating Russell, Katherine Keating Wilson; six children: John (Peg) Keating, Michael Keating, James (Sachie) Keating III, Katherine Paul, Mary (John) Keating Baker, and Thomas (Heidi) Keating, and eleven grandchildren: Andrew, Peter, Kevin and Riley Keating; Anna and Klaire Keating; Salomon Paul; Johnny and Betsy Baker; and Jack and Rosie Keating.\n\nThe family would like to express special gratitude to friends and caregivers Teri Beyer, RN, and Terry Quirk, and the Valley Nursing Association.\n\nPlease direct all expressions of kindness and donations to Jim’s son John Keating at 232 Limekiln Drive, Neenah, WI 54956. They will be directed to the memorial fund.\n\nLois-Jean (Updike) Erickson, age 88, peacefully went to sleep in Jesus' arms at Bethany Home, Waupaca, on Saturday morning, July 15, 2023.\n\nShe was born in Milwaukee on August 28, 1934, the child of Gladys and Walter Buege and given the name Virginia Orilla Ethel Buege. Sadly, her father tragically passed in a traffic accident and her mother was not allowed to continue raising her child and Virginia was placed in the Milwaukee County Children's Home. Thankfully her time in the orphanage did not last long, as the sweet little blue-eyed girl with the beautiful blond \"Shirley Temple\" curls caught the attention of a childless couple who happily made her a part of their little family through adoption. She was given the name Lois-Jean, by her new parents, Maud and Russell Bryan and began her new life in the city of Ripon. Soon after joining her new family, Lois-Jean, having been carefully taught by her mother and her church, realized that she needed a Savior and at the young age of six, Lois-Jean put her faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ and was baptized. Her faith was a central part of her life through all of her years and she actively participated in the work of the Lord in every church she became a part of. She enjoyed attending Bible studies, women's circle meetings, teaching Sunday school and Vacation Bible School, as well as singing in the choir. She had a beautiful soprano voice and shared her love of singing by taking her children to many old-fashioned hymn sings! Lois-Jean was a good student, a published poet, gifted in public speaking, and played clarinet in the band. She graduated from Wayland Academy and went on to study at Oshkosh Business School. Lois-Jean met her first husband, Richard Updike in 1953, and they eventually made their home in Neenah, where they raised their four children. While busy raising her children, Lois-Jean assisted with her children's activities as a Girl Scout Leader, compiling statistics for Little League, Girls Club Advisor and school lunch mom. She also became involved with her beloved Betty Rebekah Lodge #212, and served as Wisconsin State President of the Rebekah Assembly. Not long after Dick's retirement, he was stricken with cancer and passed away. Lois-Jean spent her time with her family, volunteered many hours working with children in the local AWANA Bible Club, as well as knitting thousands of hats and scarves for the needy at Northcott Neighborhood House in Milwaukee. After several years of widowhood, Lois-Jean became reacquainted with an old friend that she had met through his first wife. Leo Erickson, also widowed, became her constant companion and the two found love a second time! August 25, 2012, they tied the knot and enjoyed almost 11 years of wedded bliss. Lois-Jean leaves a legacy of her love for Jesus Christ lived out in her service to others.\n\nLois-Jean was preceded in death by her birth parents, Gladys & Walter Buege, and adoptive parents, Maud & Russel Bryan, her sister, Barbara Buege, her two brothers, Charles Thom and Sonny Thom, her first husband, Richard M. Updike, her daughter Catherine Marie, her grandson, William Richard, great-grandson Hunter Heiser and great-grandson Qualee Jones. She is survived by her husband Leo Erickson, Waupaca; children: Peggy (Albert) Taylor, Milwaukee; Patricia (Edward) Huber, Waupaca; and Russell (Melanie) Updike, Temecula, CA; stepchildren: Larry Erickson, Clintonville; Lonnie Erickson, Clintonville; 10 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren.\n\nA memorial service will be held on Sunday, August 27, 2023, at Fellowship Baptist Church N3548 County Rd E, Waupaca, WI, Pastor Rick Anderson officiating. Visitation will begin at 1:00 pm with the Rebekah Memorial Service at 2:00. The Main Memorial Service will follow. A fellowship meal will be held after the service. Private family burial will be in the Oak Hill Cemetery, Neenah. The family is asking those attending to please wear blue, Lois-Jean's favorite color, or something with butterfly print. The family would like to thank Dr. Ellen Wenberg and the staff at Bethany Home of Waupaca for their excellent care of Lois-Jean. Holly Funeral Home of Waupaca is assisting the family with arrangements.\n\nMADISON - James Edward Burgess passed away on Monday, Dec. 20, 2021, at the UW Hospital in Madison. His death fell on the 63rd anniversary of his wedding to Catherine E. Burgess, who, together with his four children, was present to love and support him as he passed.\n\nJim was born in La Crosse, Wis., on April 5, 1936, to William T. and Margaret F. Burgess. He grew up in La Crosse, second of three Burgess boys. It was a youth marked by memories of lots of mischief with his lifelong friend, Dr. Jerome Gundersen. He attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison and throughout his life was a significant financial supporter of the University and a regular attendee at Badgers football and basketball games.\n\nProfessionally, Jim was a consummate journalist... until the end. He was a paperboy as a kid, worked on the UW campus newspaper, The Daily Cardinal, as a student, eventually becoming its business manager. His journalism career was briefly interrupted by four years of service in the U.S. Air Force after graduation when, stationed in Germany, he served as an aircraft controller monitoring flights over eastern Europe in the early days of the Cold War.\n\nUpon completion of his military service, he returned to journalism and began working for Lee Enterprises, as his father and grandfather had done before him. He held senior positions at the Quad City Times in Davenport, Iowa, at the Missoulian, in Missoula, Mont., at the Independent Record, in Helena, Mont., and at the La Crosse Tribune, where he was the third generation Burgess to hold the position of publisher.\n\nJim might have remained at the La Crosse Tribune, but he was called to higher service as Executive Vice President of Newspapers at Lee Enterprises, the parent company of both the La Crosse Tribune and the Wisconsin State Journal. As Vice President of Newspapers, he was responsible for 19 newspapers in the Midwest and Western U.S. during a period when the company became highly successful. Then, after 13 years at the executive level, Jim left the corporate office and returned to his first love, the daily running of a great newspaper in a dynamic town, becoming publisher of the Wisconsin State Journal where he remained for the next 10 years until his retirement. \"Retirement\" brought new interests and involvement in the Madison community. Jim was an active and engaged board member for Edgewood College, the UW Hospitals and Clinics, and the Madison Center for the Arts, as well as a key donor for the Overture Center.\n\nA crowning achievement of Jim's career was his work with the UW School of Journalism and Mass Communication to create the James E. Burgess Chair of Journalism Ethics. The Chair was the cornerstone of what would become the Center for Journalism Ethics, now an internationally recognized hub for reflection, education and activism in the field. Under the leadership of its current director, Kathleen Bartzen Culver, the center has come alive with events and programs that question, challenge and advance the ethical well-being of journalism and journalists.\n\nSince boyhood, Jim devoted his free time to the outdoors. He was a bird hunter, a fisherman, and a super-putzer, who always had a tree to cut up or something to \"fix.\" Jim followed his father's lead by building a home on Lac Courte Oreilles Lake near Hayward in northern Wisconsin. He dragged his large-ish family to that beloved place at every possible occasion: for summers, long weekends and all holidays, the old station wagon pulling a trailer for the eight-hour drive from Davenport, Iowa, overflowing with a family of six and all its gear. He worked to establish a conservancy for the land around the lake and was active in COLA, the Courte Oreilles Lake Association. He sailed, pulled water skiers, toodled around on his pontoon boat, and never failed to assist other boaters in distress.\n\nJim also loved \"the farm,\" a large property he bought near Portage, in an uncommonly rich part of Wisconsin, full of creeks, ponds, trails, and trees. In other words: a source of endless outdoor projects! He built a log cabin there, bought a few tractors, revitalized ponds, put up birdhouses and mowed, over and over. Jim was father to four adult children: Kary Deuel (Jim), Peter (Karen Hostens), Sydney (Al McMillian) and Curtis (Donna Peota). He was grandfather to 11: Benjamin and Elizabeth (Kary); Åsne, Tale and Jonas (Peter); Virginia, Cullen, Tait and Rebekah (Sydney); and Quinn and Aiden (Curtis). To them he was known as Gampie. He taught them naughty words, sneaked them treats, but most of all gave each of them unconditional acceptance and love, according to each one's particular needs and situation. He is also survived by two brothers, Steve (Joan) of Naples, Fla., and Tom of Hayward, Wis.\n\nJim loved a good wind, a sharp chainsaw, his family, Johnny Walker Red, Good & Plenty candies, bathing in the lake, his dogs, his toys, holding forth at the dinner table, Madison journalism, his lifelong friends, and, of course, his wife, Cathie, or \"Catherine!\" as he frequently called her.\n\nFor those wishing to make a memorial gift at this time, we ask that you consider Jim's cherished organizations: Courte Oreilles Lakes Association (COLA), P.O. Box 702, Hayward, WI 54843, or Center of Journalism Ethics, School of Journalism and Mass Media, 5115 Vilas Hall, 821 University Ave., Madison, WI 53706.\n\nThe family also wishes to acknowledge the extraordinary professionalism and care provided by the Madison Police Department, the Madison Emergency Medical Services, the Emergency Room staff of the UW Hospital, and especially the care team in the Trauma and Life Support Center (TLC) of the UW Hospital.

He is survived by his brother, John (Jack) Laun, of Middleton, Wisconsin. Somporn Nirabutra Laun, his much-loved wife of 25 years, predeceased him in 2011. They had no children.\n\nUniversally known to his family and friends as Fred, he was born on December 9, 1937 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Alfred A. Laun, Jr. and Sue Burgess Laun. Fred grew up in Kiel, Wisconsin, where he attended Kiel Grade School. He attended Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, where he continued his growing fascination with radios and amateur (ham) radio in particular. Fred then enrolled in and graduated from the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin, in 1962 with a BA in Political Science and Journalism. During his university years what would become Fred's life-long attraction to ham radio grew as he operated with and learned from students at the Engineering Department's ham radio club W9YT.\n\nAfter graduation Fred became a Foreign Service Officer with the United States Information Agency. Over the next 25 years he served in the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, Thailand, Argentina, Colombia, and Nicaragua. From each country Fred received permission to operate his radio and actively participated in the local radio clubs. During Fred's service in Argentina he came to national attention in 1974 when he was kidnapped and shot by leftist guerrillas who were attracted by the large ham radio antennas behind his home. His captors administered life-saving medical care and the next day released him unconscious where he would be found. He eventually recovered and was recognized with The Secretary's Award by U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and a letter from President Richard Nixon.\n\nAfter retirement Fred played a leading role in supporting organizations of amateur radio operators in the United States and abroad and participated in numerous amateur radio competitions until he took ill in mid-December. Fred was a lifetime member of the American Radio Relay League and a member of its Maxim Society. He served as editor of the bilingual Region 2 News published by the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU) from 1990 through 1998 and served in a variety of offices in local radio clubs, including as president of both the National Capitol DX Association and the Potomac Valley Radio Club. In 1993 he was selected by his fellow radio hams to be inducted into the CQ Amateur Radio Contest Hall of Fame. Until his death Fred also served as a director of the Yasme Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation that supports scientific and educational projects related to amateur radio and the introduction and promotion of amateur radio in developing countries.\n\nAt Fred's request no services were held. He was laid to rest in the family burial plot at New Holstein City Cemetery in New Holstein, Wisconsin.\n\nFrederick Charles Kapelle, Age 82, passed away on March 26th, 2020 with his loving wife by his side. He was born on May 17, 1937 in Beaver Dam, WI, the cherished, only child of Merlin Charles and Alma Henrietta (Miller) Kapelle. He grew up in Wisconsin, attending school at The Wayland Academy where he excelled in academics as well as sports. He attended college at University of Wisconsin and proudly flew his Badger flag next to his Green Bay Packer flag at home. He received his Master's degree in Social Work (MSW) from the University of Denver. It was there that he met the love of his life and wife of 59 years, Beverly Davis Kapelle. They married on April 21st, 1961, and their love story has been an inspiration to all that knew them.\n\nFred spent his life serving God and dedicated to making the world a better place. He began his career as a case worker supervisor in Fond du Lac, WI. In 1970, he moved his young family to Kalamazoo, MI to work as Director of Family and Children's Services. He established the first drug prevention program in Kalamazoo in the 1970's, where he implemented the first methadone program and the 24 hour HELP-line for suicide prevention and mental health support. In 1972, he began his work as Executive Director of Lakeside Children's Home, a 24 hour residential program for children, where he helped them and their families to live healthier lives. Fred and Bev were active members in the First Presbyterian Church of Kalamazoo for 25 years.\n\nBev and Fred retired to Kerrville, TX in 1994 and spent their next 25 years enjoying being closer to Bev's Texan family, golf, GB Packer football, some hunting (though mostly with a camera), and traveling. Fred was an accomplished potter and continued to enjoy his art and the strong friendships that came with his craft throughout his life.\n\nFred had two passions in life that he was dedicated to above all else; family and God. He was blessed with his wife, Beverly, and their three children who he is survived by; Leslie (Dean) Burns of Irons, MI; Amy (Dave) Spindler of Northville, MI; and David (Teresa) Kapelle of Lacey, WA; as well as his nine grandchildren; Anna, Stuart, and Samantha Burns; Haley, Reagan, and Tess Spindler; Chase Kapelle; and Crystal and Robert Becan. He was never happier than when his family was together and there was laughter in the room.\n\nHis strong faith in God helped guide his steps in spending his career helping others, and extended into his retirement where he helped to launch and lead the Stephen Ministry work at First Presbyterian Church of Kerrville, TX. He was able to use his skills and Christ-like compassion to help care receivers in need of support.\n\nFred lived an admirable life, where he was as cherished at its end as he was at the beginning.\n\nTucker McNamara was endowed by his heritage, shaped by his circumstances and his choices. Tucker was born February 25, 1938, in Oshkosh, to William and Elizabeth McNamara. His grandfather Charles Williams scripted three poems about his first grandson: Tucky Mac and Quacky Quack, To Tucker on His First Birthday, and Tall Tucker. They are part and parcel of the family lexicon.\n\nTucker spent his early years in Peoria but summered in Oshkosh on Lake Butte des Morts at his grandparents' cottages, with his sister Meg and various cousins. Fishing, frolicking, and swimming were daily on his agenda.\n\nTucker attended Wayland Academy, graduating from 12th grade in 1956. He earned a bachelor's and master's degree in engineering at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, where he also joined the school of engineering faculty. He was a lifelong member of Tau Beta Pi, The Engineering Honor Society.\n\nCalifornia and the opportunity to work in his field led to a succession of jobs in the aerospace industry. His career culminated in a consultancy to the US Navy on a highly classified project for its F18 fighter jet.\n\nTucker married Mary Jo Perk in 2001, after they rekindled a still flickering flame from 1963. They embarked on a great life adventure that continued to their last days together.\n\nTucker is survived by Mary Jo, her son Chris Willy (Daureen) and daughter Erica Jo Moroney (Matt) and five grandsons. He is also survived by his sister Margaret Gyll, his sisters-in-law Letty Perk and Kitty (Mark) Miller, many nieces and nephews, and cousins both local and far flung.\n\nTucker enjoyed physical pursuits that included hiking, biking, kayaking and swimming off the dock in front of his and Mary Jo's home on Lake Winnebago. His intellectual curiosity led to his lifelong love of learning about subjects outside of his chosen profession: history, astronomy, and current affairs.\n\nTucker has outpaced the bounds of earth. The world has lost a bright shining light. However, his aura will live on in all of us who knew him and loved him so well.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, if you wish, kindly send a donation to the Worldwide Wildlife Fund (to save elephants, Tucker's favorite animal).\n\nCarol Lee (Carrie) was born on September 30, 1937, in South Bend Indiana as the best ever birthday present to her mother, Mattie Lee (Patsy) Ramsey Smith, who was born on the same date. Harold F. Smith was her loving father who made her eyes twinkle every time she talked about him. Carrie spent many happy summers at Diamond Lake sunning, swimming and sailing. She shared her love of the lake with her entire extended family. As a child, she took piano and voice lessons and sang like an angel. Singing in church choirs was an integral part of her life where she made many friends.\n\nCarrie loved all aspects of education. She shared many joyous stories about her years at Wayland Academy and Mac McMurray College, both of which she was a proud alumna. The friendships she made there were so cherished that she never lost touch with her school friends.

As a dedicated educator, Carrie began her career as a Kindergarten teacher in Palatine Illinois, she shared her love of finger plays and songs as the Ellis Hollow nursery school teacher and she mastered the fine art of successful substitute teaching in the Ithaca City School District. The highlight of her career was teaching with the Boynton Beauties, the best sixth grade team of teachers who became lifelong friends.\n\nCarrie's first marriage was to Jerry Lace, the father of their two daughters, Christine Lace McPherson, Sackets Harbor, NY and Toronto, Ontario and Julie Lace, Tampa, Florida. Of the hats Carrie wore, she often said her greatest joy came from being a mother. Her grandchildren, Caitrin and Caroline Mc Pherson, Alyssa and Andrew Crocker brought her tremendous happiness.\n\nIn 1974, Carrie married her best friend Jon W. Metzger. Together they had a beautiful life enjoying all the small moments, walking on Venice beaches, traveling, sailing and turning houses into homes. Jon was the most dedicated spouse a person could ask for as he cared for Carrie and loves her with his entire heart and soul.\n\nCarol Lee is survived by her sister, Sarah Smith (Pam Tompkins) of Venice, Florida, her stepson , J. Todd Metzger (Nolene) and their children Taylor and Abby Metzger; her stepdaughter Lee Metzger Dudley and her children, J.J., Josh and Hallie Dudley.

Ann's father was a revered family physician adored by Ann and the community for his kindness and generosity. Ann's mother was an active Girl Scout volunteer, known for her creative and energetic spirit. These traits were easily apparent in Ann as well.\n\nGrowing up on a lake in rural Wisconsin, Ann was very active and athletic. She enjoyed water skiing and was a high school cheerleader and athlete at Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam. After graduation, Ann attended Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, and Arizona State University in Tempe. Ann met Bob Fisher at ASU and they were married in 1959.\n\nAfter Bob's service in the Army, the Fisher family settled in San Diego County, where Ann's many talents emerged.\n\nAnn was a loving and nurturing parent who also enjoyed working with young children. She opened a preschool in Rancho Bernardo and was an active volunteer, recognized for her support of the community. She served on the boards of Home Owner Associations and RB Little League.\n\nAnn was also very creative. She enjoyed playing the piano and was a skilled, hands-on interior designer, working for individual clients as well as corporations, including Teledyne Ryan of San Diego. Ann also became certified as a massage therapist, another service she provided to reach out and help others, her most favorite pursuit. Family and friends describe Ann as selfless, generous, thoughtful, agile, resourceful and fun-loving.\n\nAnn traveled extensively after her marriage in 2006 to David Rousseau, M.D., of Rancho Bernardo. She and Dave took many trips as a couple but also enjoyed travel and visits with sons Steve and Greg, spouses Tiffany and Amy, and grandchildren Trace, Camden, Blane, and Kelby. Cruising with Dave was a favorite activity, and locally Ann was often seen \"cruising\" the neighborhood in her shiny, red Alfa Romeo convertible.\n\nAnn recognized the challenges ahead as her memory began to decline, but handled her diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease with dignity, humor and grace. Ann always treated every person, no matter what their circumstances, with love, kindness and respect.

He greatly enjoyed looking at and walking in and nearby Dunn’s Marsh. He also loved music of all kinds, but especially jazz. He loved electronics and spent many hours building things from kits, including the family’s first color TV. He also loved reading, especially science fiction and adventure stories by favored author Edgar Rice Burroughs.\n\nDave had a great sense of humor and loved joking around. Although Alzheimer’s Disease changed him from the man we knew in his younger years, he always brought joy and dancing to the lives of those who knew him in his later years.\n\nDave will be greatly missed by those who survive him, children Kelly Olson, Lisa Geffert, Kris (Dave) Owens, Greg (Amber) Geffert; his grandchildren Nic Schwark, Stephanie Arnold, Kyle Owens, Alec Owens, Ryan Owens, and Alexandra Geffert; his great-grandchildren Eva, Silas, and Arlo Arnold, and Thora Schwark, sister-in-law Elizabeth Geffert, brother John, brother in-law Gerald Minton, and many nieces and nephews.\n\nTremendous thanks to the wonderful caregivers at Sonrisas in Verona where he spent his final months.

He played every day that he could. Many will smile fondly, remembering Big Dave’s antics on the court and his fond appreciation of the sport.\n\nUpon retirement, David and Karen spent their time in their two favorite places, Roaring Brook, and Sanibel Island, where he was very involved in both communities. Serving as president of and sitting on the Board of the Roaring Brook Association for years, he was often seen on the beach, in his white bucket hat, under an umbrella, getting the inside scoop from the community he served and loved. He also enjoyed collaborating with neighbors and friends around the pond on Sanibel to work and care for the island community.\n\nThroughout his life he was active in various philanthropic activities. He was a member of the Kiwanis Club of Harbor Springs, volunteered as a mediator and small business advisor, worked as a census coordinator, and even pushed the book cart around at the hospital.

Born in Chicago, Laura was the second of six children of Kellogg Fairbank, Jr., an industrial Realtor, and June Fairbank Taylor, Founder of the Lincoln Park Zoo Society. Laura grew up in Chicago's Near North Side and spent her summers at \"Butternuts,\" the family home on the shores of Lake Geneva, Wisconsin built in 1890.\n\nLaura felt great pride in her family's deep Chicago roots. Laura's great-grandfather, N.K. Fairbank came to Chicago in 1855, and became a successful industrialist with companies that manufactured soap as well as animal and baking products. He was the original owner of the land that comprises Streeterville in downtown Chicago and engaged in a 20-year court battle to evict the legendary squatter, \"Cap\" George Streeter. N.K. founded many of the city's cultural institutions including The Chicago Club and the Commercial Club of Chicago, and was an original trustee of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.\n\nLaura attended Francis W. Parker School, followed by the Baldwin School, Wayland Academy, and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. But a 1959 trip to Africa to collect mountain gorillas with Marlin Perkins, Director of the Lincoln Park Zoo and star of the television program, Zoo Parade, was the catalyst for her real education. Laura's African adventure sparked a lifelong passion for learning about others, culture, and community through traveling the world.\n\nIn 1961, she married William S. Ames and had three daughters. In 1969, she married Louis C. Sudler, Jr., a retired Navy Captain and partner in Sudler & Company, one of Chicago's largest and most prestigious real estate firms at the time. Together, they had a son. Also in real estate, Laura was a top luxury broker for more than 30 years.\n\nLaura believed that it is our civic responsibility to actively support the organizations that make Chicago great. She served as President of the board of the Chicago Academy of Sciences (now the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum), SOS Children's Villages Illinois, and ARCS (Achievement Rewards for College Scientists), and tirelessly in leadership roles for several other organizations.\n\nAfter retiring from real estate, Laura, along with her husband Louis, went into the travel business. Together, they led groups to unlikely destinations on every continent including Africa, India, Iran, Syria, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Bhutan, Nagaland, Antarctica, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, and Spitzbergen. They traveled the world so many times that their flight paths would wrap the globe like a ball of yarn. Their goal was to explore places that were out of the way, learning about unique cultures and people. While traveling, Laura collected original textiles, many of which were donated to the Art Institute of Chicago and the Field Museum. Most importantly, they opened doors, changing the lives of the people they met, and the perspectives of the people who traveled with them. Always ready for adventure, she was planning her next family vacation right up until she died.\n\nLaura led her extraordinary life with bravado and candor. She was colorful, outspoken, caring, principled, generous, and full of determination. She valued her friends and cherished her family. She loved deeply, was passionate about learning, and had a boundless commit to making a difference in the world. In recent years, she enjoyed spending time at their home in Colorado.\n\nLaura is survived by her husband, Louis, as well as her children, Jennifer Ames Lazarre (Paul), Mary Ames Kivell (Tom), Nathalie E. Ames, and Stewart Zachariah \"Zack\" Sudler (Violet), her stepsons, John Sudler (Karolyn) and David Sudler (Sandra), and eight grandchildren: Chase, Emily, Laura, Griffin, Holden, William \"Max,\" Alexander, Erik and a step grandson, Nathan.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to an organization that is dear to her heart, SOS Children's Villages of Illinois at www.sosillinois.org/giving/donations.\n\nIt is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Judith Congedo, of Corinth, Texas, on January 6th, 2023.\n\nJudy was born in Chicago on August 29, 1941 to Elenor and Robert Fisher. After graduating from Wayland Academy in Wisconsin, Judy attended the University of Colorado. It is in Boulder where she met her husband Manny Congedo. They were married for 56 years before Manny passed away in 2018.\n\nJudy is survived by her three children, Jennifer, Jill and her spouse Rodney, and Christopher and his spouse Kim. Along with her seven grandchildren; Jerry and his spouse Lisa, Matthew, Nathaniel and his spouse Kaylee, Ashley and her spouse Ryan, Emily, Zella, Vivian, and four great grandchildren; Madison, Haley, Juniper, Magnolia.\n\nShe really loved to quilt and sew. Judy made a number of quilts that are based on the seasons and nature themes. Many of which now decorate her children's and grandchildren's homes. After giving up on sewing clothes for her kids, Judy loved to sew Halloween costumes. Each year her grandchildren would ask for a costume and she would oblige. She made multiple themed dresses and all kinds of animal costumes, from bunnies and turtles to a skunk costume that her granddaughter asked for.\n\nJudy also enjoyed reading, gardening, trying new restaurants, playing games, and visiting with friends and family. She put her love of reading to good use when she worked in the local school library for many years. Later in life she enjoyed recommending books and recipes. Some that she made and some she thought looked good from a cooking magazine she recently read. Starting in her early 50's, Judy began to struggle with mobility and muscle strength. It slowly worsened to the point that she spent most of the last decade in a motorized wheelchair. Even with her physical limitations, Judy was a strong woman who never complained and didn't like it when her family did either. Her friends describe her as always being upbeat, friendly, and having an infectious smile. We will miss her indelible will and generosity of spirit.\n\nShe and her brother Bob, suffered from Mitochondrial Disease. A little known condition that can manifest in many different ways.\n\nWaupaca - Once you have tasted flight, you will walk the earth with your eyes towards the sky. January 9th, 1941, Fred was born. His life would prove to be extraordinary. He was the youngest of four children born to Russell C. Flom and Lois Trossen Flom. He was adored by his teenage siblings Dick, Betty, and Jerry. The family lived on Park Street across from Smith Park in Menasha,WI. As a young boy it was obvious that sports would be a huge part of Fred's life. His lifelong love of tennis began on the courts in Smith Park. Friendships were born that lasted a lifetime.\n\nAs time went on, it was decided Wayland Academy was in the best interest of the family. Fred spent his high school years being a reluctant student, an avid sportsman, and with an eye on the sky. He knew from a young age he had the \"need for speed\" and dreamt of becoming a pilot.\n\nSummers were spent on the Chain O' Lakes as his parents had a cottage constructed on Rainbow Lake when Fred was a child. This was probably when his reputation as a Maverik began. His mischief was harmless, but no question he was a rule breaker.\n\nCollege took him to Lawrence University where he lettered in four sports, but more importantly where he joined the ROTC and continued to follow his dreams. Upon graduation the U.S. Air Force beckoned and he was on his way.\n\nHe married his college sweetheart, Ginny McKee, and they were off to a life with the Air Force. He was no longer a rule breaker, but a proud Air Force fighter pilot. A beautiful little girl, Julie, came along and all was right with the world.\n\nHe was sent to Takhli Air Force Base in Thailand where he flew eighty-six combat missions before his life changed dramatically. On August 8th, 1966, his F-105 Thunder Chief was hit. He was forced to eject and was captured immediately. After Six and a half years as a POW in Vietnam, thousands of people gathered in Appleton, Wisconsin to welcome him home. Upon his return he met his adorable son Erik for the first time, who was born the month after he was shot down.\n\nFred never wanted this experience to define him, of course friends and acquaintances often could not comprehend how it could not. It is called being a patriot, choosing honor and duty over self. It is being given the ultimate test and passing with flying colors because you stared death in the face and walked away. The best revenge is having a wonderful life. He used to say \"I've had the best life… Well, except for maybe those seven years\".\n\nTo most people the sky is the limit, to those who love flying the sky is home. Fred decided a full time Air Force career was a hardship on his family so he satisfied his flying dreams through the Wisconsin Air National Guard and eventually flying his beloved F-105 and later the F-4 at Carswell Air Force Base in Texas. He had a twenty five year career as a commercial pilot with American Airlines and was able to continue flying fighters with the Air Force until he was almost 50. Life continued to challenge Fred during his early years in Texas. He lost his wife Ginny in a car accident in 1981 and his son Erik who was on a trip to Thailand in 1996.\n\nOn January 1st, 1986 he married Kay Fleck with whom he shared thirty five years of adventure. Their relationship was defined by \"Don't ever let any day be ordinary\". Fred was as at home in a neighborhood bar as he was on the Orient Express. He was as cool in his Pantera as he was in his twenty-two year old pick up. This Wisconsin boy developed an affinity for cowboy boots, concerts, and the Dallas Cowboys, but always kept the Green Bay Packers dear to his heart.\n\nIn August of 1997 his family grew by one when his daughter Julie married John Pereira in what Fred turned into a military dining out in all its glory. Soon afterwards, Fred welcomed in his three grandchildren, Kodiak, Maxwell, and Quinn. As his grandsons say… The coolest Grandpa was created.\n\nIn retirement his flying dreams had been fulfilled and after years of remodeling his Texas home on Manning Lane, he and Kay set out to remodel a 100 year old cottage on Round Lake in Wisconsin. He was not a trained builder, but during his time as a POW he spent countless hours building structures in his imagination. Camp Flom was born.\n\nThis man was a warrior, a patriot, a family man and a friend who embodied the best. He had been to Hell and back, but was never bitter. He had a zest for life and was always able to see past differences in search of common ground. He knew that we all need to commit to something bigger than ourselves. He never treated anyone differently because of race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. Fred hoped we would all learn from our mistakes and realize that the war we need to be fighting is the one right here in the United States… our divided nation, our dislike of those different from ourselves. \"All men and women are created equally\".\n\nFred returned with honor. He believed you do what is right, even if you are flying solo. On June 23rd, 2021 the world lost a beautiful soul. A soul that had an enormous impact. A soul that is loved and admired by many. Fred, \"Everything's waiting for you\".\n\nMary Edith Koch Barclay of Severna Park passed away peacefully in her home on March 5, 2023. Mary was born to Carl Nelson Koch and Marjorie (nee Autrey Koch) on May 10, 1942, in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, and attended Wayland Academy.

Chapter R, and she enjoyed over 50 years of friendship and philanthropy with her sisters and their families in Severna Park. A member of Woods Church, she always brought Anne to the monthly music programs. Her daughter attended Severn School. Mary was very active in the school community where she built many great friendships. Well-coordinated and strong, Mary enjoyed sports and played tennis with friends here and at The Little Egg Harbor Yacht Club (LEHYC) in Beach Haven, New Jersey. Mary, Charlie and Anne have spent their summers at their family cottage in Beach Haven. Mary loved to read and was a leader in several book clubs here and at LEHYC. She was also in the Art Club there, making beautiful watercolor and oil paintings. Other hobbies included playing the piano, bridge, knitting and cooking, often gourmet, and used family recipes from her mother and Grandmother, and from Julia Child. Mary was truly good at everything she did, very bright and talented, and her family could always rely on her good judgement. Mary and Charlie enjoyed travel together with many memorable trips both here and abroad. She used her research skills to prepare for their trips. With her wonderful personality, Mary has made many good friends. She was truly a joy to everyone.\n\nMary is survived by her devoted husband, Charles Brunner Barclay, of 57 years; daughter, Anne Brooks Barclay Perry (Wesley Scott Perry) of Kensington MD, and two grandchildren, William and Wesley; and by her sister, Kathryn Elizabeth Koch Kremer (Michael G. Kremer) of Middleton, WI. Mary is predeceased by her brother, Thomas Autrey Koch of Chatham, NJ, and by her parents, Marjorie Louise Autrey Koch and Carl Nelson Koch. A Memorial Service will be celebrated on Saturday, April 15 at 11:30 am, Woods Memorial Presbyterian Church, Severna Park, MD 21146, with a reception to follow.\n\nI have thought about this for some time, it gives me peace of mind and quality time to think back on what really mattered. What mattered: The birth of my two children, Timothy James Meyer (wife, Latha and granddaughter, Hali) and Elizabeth Briand Angiuli (husband, Tony and grandchildren, Mikelle and Marcus).\n\nI was born on Dec. 23, 1941, to “Betty” Morainville Johnson Oaks and Claude Johnson. My great-grandparents were Gertrude and Augustus Spies. I moved to Oshkosh in the late 40s where I later graduated from Wayland Academy and attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nI worked for over 60 years beginning as a camp counselor and ending as the manager of Programs and Membership at the Marinette-Menominee Area Chamber of Commerce. I LOVE (loved) Menominee and returned to my hometown in 2009 from the Seattle area.\n\nI cannot forget my lifelong devoted friend, Kae, who is still with me in spirit. We have 70 years of friendship. I am honored to have had several other women friends that I call “sisters.” Vicki and Pat, I love you! I am so thankful for their friendship. I also have two half-sisters in the area, Claudia Schoener and Johanna Lewis. It has been heartfelt knowing them as adults. I have two half-brothers, Ken and Tom Oaks, who live out of the area.\n\nAristotle and Sophia — my beautiful dogs. You will be taken care of by your loving and treasured “foster parents,” Tricia and Ben. Without you, my life would have been void of white hair on everything.\n\nI will find my final resting place in the Spies plot at the foot of my grandmother’s grave, Elizabeth Spies Morainville, next to my grandfather, Victor Morainville. And, Daddy you are not far away in the Henes plot. I wish I had more time knowing you. I have lived and loved, cried and laughed, and now I find some eternal peace. If you knew me, I hope this made you smile!\n\nCarole Wenaas died peacefully at home with most of her family around her in Milton, GA on Wednesday, 12/14/22 just 2 days before her 81st birthday. Carole, was born in Green Bay, Wisconsin on December 16, 1941, to Val (Nana) and Ade (Pappy) Ritter. Carole was predeceased by her parents and brother Gene Ritter. Left to cherish her memory are her two children, Scott and his wife Susan, and their four children, David, Elizabeth, Emma and Jonathon; Mike and his wife Heidi and their two children, Ben and Ally; her sister Virginia O’block, her brother Bob Ritter, her niece Kim Arrants, other nephews and nieces, and her close brother and sister-in-law’s, Eric and Karen Wenaas, and John and Christine Wenaas.\n\nHer family moved several times in Carole’s childhood before settling in Fond du Lac, WI where her father owned and operated the Lamartine Creamery. Carole attended Wayland Academy, a private high school in Beaver Dam, WI. She went on to attend Purdue University and graduated with a major in English. She became a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority and was selected to be a rush chairman and a pledge trainer. She graduated in 1964 and accepted a teaching position as a Sophomore English teacher at Haverford High school outside of Philadelphia. She lived there with one of her close sorority sisters.\n\nWhile a freshman at Purdue, she met David Wenaas, a Junior and Civil Engineering major. Five years later upon discharge from the Army Corps of Engineers in Germany, David and Carole were married on June 26, 1965. They moved to Middletown, Ohio and she continued teaching high school English with her best friend until their first son, Scott, was born in 1969. Her second son, Michael was born in 1971.\n\nDavid was transferred to Boston in 1973 for a sales position, and she began playing tennis with women who became lifetime friends. This love for the sport enabled her to teach both of her boys how to play. Furthermore, she became an avid skier which resulted in a wonderful family activity along with tennis. Carole provided a close family tradition of having dinners together as a family since she was an excellent cook. While living in Sudbury she lost her older brother Gene, a Pan Am copilot, in a tragic cargo plane crash at Logan Airport due to a fire caused by incorrect packaging of cargo. She also lost her best friend and next door neighbor who had two girls the age of her boys.\n\nIn 1977 Carole, David and their boys moved again to beautiful Denver, CO. Always adventuresome, she flew out by herself to find a new home which was one under construction in Green Oaks neighborhood; she then supervised all the painting and finish work from Boston. In addition to continued skiing and tennis, she played bridge, and was a volunteer for several charitable organizations including the Carrousel Ball fund raiser for children’s diabetes. Wherever Carole called “home,” she attracted many friends and Denver was no different. Many lifelong friends were made during their years in Colorado.\n\nIn 1995, she enthusiastically embraced the opportunity to live in Tokyo, Japan for two years to be with David in his assignment to complete a cable TV joint venture with Sumitomo cable TV; she had many interesting experiences that were not to be found in Denver.\n\nDavid was fortunate to be able to take early retirement, so they decided to move to Williamsburg, VA to be close to Scott and Susan and their first two grandchildren. She had many friends and wonderful experiences in Governors Land which included the Two Rivers Golf Club and Marina. She was a member of the “Gang Plank” which was a partnership of six couples who owned a pontoon boat. They enjoyed many boating adventures on the James River. Carole and David lived in Governor’s Land for 22 years.\n\nIn 2020, Carole was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and at the gentle insistence of Scott and Susan she moved with her beloved David to Milton, GA. in July, 2021.\n\nKenneth Lowry Black, 80, of Washington, IL died on August 22, 2023 at OSF Richard L. Owens Hospice Home under the gentle care of his family and the OSF hospice team.\n\nHe was born in Peoria in 1942 to Kenneth W. and Edith Lowry Black and lived most of his life in Washington.\n\nAt Washington Community High School he was an outstanding athlete, lettering in football, basketball, and baseball. In whatever sport he took on, he excelled, with golf becoming his primary focus after school. In addition to his athletic prowess, Ken was an avid outdoorsman with a love and respect for nature. Fishing, hunting, and working with hunting dogs became his lifelong avocations. He became a highly successful dog trainer/handler, winning dozens of national and regional shooting dog amateur championships.\n\nAlong with his active life in the outdoors, he was an enthusiastic reader, fully engaging his mind in new ideas and considerations of human nature.\n\nFollowing his graduation from Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, he attended Florida State University on a basketball scholarship, then transferred to Bradley University, where he was a member of Sigma Chi Fraternity. He graduated in 1966.\n\nKnowing the military draft was on the near horizon, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. In 1968 he was deployed to Viet Nam as a Second Lieutenant and served at Khe Sanh. Despite his antipathy to that war, he never entertained \"draft dodger\" mentality, duty bound to honor his commitment. Unfortunately, his exposure to Agent Orange would be a causative factor in his demise. Perhaps with some atonement on the part of the USMC, he was next stationed at Camp Pendleton where he played basketball for the Marines in the California sunshine.\n\nUpon his return to civilian life, he obtained a law degree from the University of Louisville School of Law in 1974, then joined his father in the family firm, Black and Black. He remained in law practice with his father and later two nephews, Robert W. Brown, Jr. and David A. Brown for over 45 years, with the firm becoming Black Black and Brown. Over 30 of those years included serving as the City Attorney for the City of Washington. He was admitted to practice in the Illinois Supreme Court, U.S. District Court, and U.S. Supreme Court. In 2001 the Tazewell County Bar Association honored him with their Volunteer of the Year Award for his generous pro bono work. As an attorney, Ken aspired to the highest ideals of the law and remained loyal to that intent for all his professional life. Honesty and devotion in representing his clients was a constant in his life.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Carolyn Coulter, his son, Travis Black, and his best bird dog, Crow Creek Sugarbaby. Also surviving are his brother, Bruce Black (Patricia Bass), a large extended family of nephews, nieces, and cousins, his former wife, Paula Prutsman, Carolyn's step-daughter, Kris Uhler, and more friends than most people can ever dream of. His parents predeceased him as well as his sister, Barbara Brown.\n\nRobert J. “Bob” Kratz, Sr. age 79 of Fox Lake, died unexpectedly at his home on Friday, Sept. 23, 2022.\n\nBob was born in Fond du Lac on Feb. 1, 1943 the son of Orville F. and Helen (Kahler) Kratz.

In 1971, the family moved to Marshfield where he was employed by Rembs-Kundinger Funeral Home. Bob worked hard with long days and nights but managed to find time to be active with the local Jaycees and Jaycettes and the local Boy Scout program.\n\nEarly 1978, Bob and MaryAnn moved back to their home town when Bob took over the family business from his father Orville F. Kratz. Bob and MaryAnn continued to be active with the local Jaycees and Jaycettes and Bob with the local Boy Scouts while his sons were young. Being a people person, Bob joined and volunteered for many organizations such as Fox Lake Chamber of Commerce, City of Fox Lake Redevelopment Authority, Fox Lake Kiwanis, and Fox Lake Property Owners. Bob was united in marriage to Ellen M. Walker-White on March 18, 2000 in Jamaica.\n\nIn his later years, he became a charter member of the Fox Lake Lions Club where he loved to hold brat fry’s, do community projects and to volunteer at Wisconsin Lions Camp. Bob held various positions with the Lions Club outside the local group, including district chairman, and received the Wisconsin Birch-Strum Award, the highest award given to honor those who exemplify undying dedication and commitment to Lionism. In his free time, Bob enjoyed hunting, fishing, bowling, collecting sports memorabilia of the Packers, Badgers and NASCAR, going out to eat, hence his nickname “be right back Bob” and having a night cap at local establishments.\n\nMany will remember him for his quick wit, a good joke but also as a caring man helping others in need. Bob will be sadly missed and mourned by his children, Lori McConochie (John Sharp) of Cambria, Robert “Rob” Kratz, Jr (Cindy Hulen) of Delafield and Steve Kratz (fiancé, Gabie Goral) of Chilton; his grandchildren, Chandra Solis (TJ Lazewski), Deidra (Jon) Pahl, Alexandra (Brad) Grage, Chandler and Mylie Kratz, Ian Diels and Karissa (Eugene) Rataczak; his great grandchildren, Brennon Engle (Isabella Hartl), Nicholas Pahl, Kyle and Brooklyn Grage, Karlee, Christopher and Cassie Jo Kratz; one great great granddaughter, Rosetta Marie Engle; one brother, Richard (Joan) Kratz of Stoughton; cousin, Marion Kratz of DePere; his ex-wiives and friends, MaryAnn D.

She graduated from Wayland Academy in 1962 and went on to earn her bachelor's degree in Government from Cornell University and her master's degree from Columbia Teachers College.\n\nShe began her career as an educator, with an emphasis on disadvantaged youth.

Weaving, quilting, spinning, knitting, and beading were among her favorite crafts, and one of the primary avenues for her many friendships. The other was her involvement in the lives and activities of her two boys; from organizing playgroups to heading up the PTA to hitting the road for soccer tournaments or track meets. She was always a friendly presence and often found or made friends in the stands with a tin full of cookies and a smile. She was always generous in her support of her kids' interests.\n\nJoan had the good fortune to be cared for by Annetta Lee and her staff at Lee Manor Adult Family Home over the final five years of her life, as Alzheimer's disease eroded her previously formidable abilities.\n\nJoan was preceded in death by her parents Henry and Mary Godshall and her brother, Jonathan Godshall. She is survived by her sister Jamie Godshall and brother in-law David Gerry; sister in-law Nancy Godshall; her two sons Eric and Justin Dudley along with their wives Amber Larsen and Heidi Dudley, and three grandchildren Charlotte, Landon and Tucker; and former husband Rick Dudley.\n\nA memorial service will be held at 11:00am on Friday, January 13, at Westford Funeral Home in Bellingham, with reception following.

David enjoyed attending bunkering business gatherings, through which he made many lasting friendships.\n\nDavid was an avid reader with great knowledge and interest in history as well as current events.
