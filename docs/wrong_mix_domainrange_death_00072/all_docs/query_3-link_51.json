        "text": "Cultural conflagrations don’t come any less expected than those that mark the life and career of Terry Allen: the orbits of country music and the art scene don’t, after all, tend to travel the same paths. Still, here we have Mr. Allen, 80 years old and living at Santa Fe, who counts among his friends the late Texas songsmith Guy Clark and Conceptualism’s perpetual enfant terrible, Bruce Nauman. Should those names not ring a bell, attempt squaring Hank Williams and Marcel Duchamp — it’s not impossible; just improbable.\n\nMr. Allen is the subject of a new biography by Brendan Greaves, “Truckload of Art: The Life and Work of Terry Allen.” Mr. Greaves is a self-described “lapsed art worker” and founder of a North Carolina-based record label, Paradise of Bachelors. As you might expect of a music label that takes its name from a short story by Herman Melville, Mr. Greaves’s concern thrives in “the subluminal aether” — that is to say, Southern vernacular music. “Our business,” the mission statement avers, “is fascination.”\n\nMessrs. Greaves and Allen have collaborated on a series of projects, not least of which is the remastered version of “Lubbock (On Everything),” Mr. Allen’s 1979 homage to his hometown. The double album is widely and, in this critic’s opinion, rightfully considered a masterwork of alt-country — a term that hadn’t been coined at the time of its recording. “The Beautiful Waitress” is a particular favorite, as it combines truck stop gastronomy, on-the-fly eroticism, and the vexations of drawing from observation. Mr. Allen’s voice, a sharp drawl indicative of his Texas roots, navigates the ruminative and the wry in equal measures.\n\nMr. Greaves’s book takes its title from another song featured on “Lubbock (On Everything).” The track begins as a recitation backed by countrypolitan chamber music and turns into a loping narrative punctuated by Mr. Allen’s yodeling and sustained by Richard Bowden’s fiddle. The music sounds as old as the hills — Mr. Greaves points to precedents like Jimmie Rodgers and Roy Acuff — but the lyrics are something else altogether, detailing, as they do, the art world rivalry between “real superior” New Yorkers and the “snotty surfer upstarts” out west.\n\nSardonic, Mr. Allen is; pithy, too, and not a little cantankerous: Just ask his wife of many decades, the artist and actress Jo Harvey Allen. It’s enough to make you wonder if Mr. Greaves is the writer best suited to limn this contrarian’s life. His prose tends to the purple. Here he imagines the meeting of Mr. Allen’s parents in 1942: “They caught each other’s eyes through the clarifying, brassy sunlight slanting onto the stucco and vibrating off the tracks … the attraction was instantaneous and palpable, unsettling them out of their interiority and wounded hesitancy.”\n\n“Wounded hesitancy,” huh? If Mr. Greaves’s writing evinces someone weaned on too many back issues of Artforum, doling out terms like “metonymic personifications” as if they were M&M’s, he does get into something resembling a groove when hunkering down with the facts, just the facts. As his subject’s story becomes increasingly verifiable, Mr. Greaves’s literary turns take on their own logic. By the time he starts describing Lubbock’s scarifying dust storms ’roundabout Chapter 4, we relinquish control to the author’s lead.\n\nAs for Mr. Allen: He is traversing a curious, wide-ranging, and fascinating life. That earlier allusion to Hank Williams and Marcel Duchamp? Our hero met them both, or, rather, he spied Williams from the wings of a concert venue that was run by his father: “the boy had watched [Williams], spellbound, as he had watched so many others shake his dad’s stages.”\n\nAs a student at the Chouinard Art Institute, now known as CalArts, the 22-year-old Mr. Allen was in the audience when the Grand Pere of Dadaism was interviewed at a local television station. He later shook hands with Duchamp even as he “had no idea what to make of [his] self-reflexive, recondite art.”\n\nAnother sighting of cultural import includes a young Elvis Presely, who supped with the Allens on one of his tours of Lubbock. As a preadolescent, Mr. Allen was unmoved, finding the future King of Rock ’n’ Roll not “terribly exotic or impressive.”\n\nStill, this bastard son of Sled and Pauline Allen — that’s Mr. Greaves’s terminology, not mine — weathered the flatlands of Lubbock, his own ennui, and a series of indelible markers: the death of his father, his mother’s alcoholism, and the academic ostracization that resulted when he and a buddy performed an original song at a high school assembly. Its title? “Roman Orgy.” Coach Rodgers, for one, was unimpressed, threatening to “kick [the two boys’] asses all the way to Amarillo.”\n\nMr. Greaves’s encyclopedic knowledge of Mr. Allen’s oeuvre is commendable and, given his business interests, necessary, but it can sometimes be a slog. Still, his biography touches on home truths about the sacrifices one has to make in order to be an artist and, importantly, the rewards of having done so. The array of personages we meet along the line — country rocker Joe Ely no less than New Museum founder Marcia Tucker — is wildly various. Members of the Manson family straggle in, David Byrne alights on the proceedings, and Nancy Reagan, of all people, makes a guest appearance.\n\nHaving not encountered Mr. Allen’s drawings, installations and performances first-hand, I can’t comment upon their qualities. As a songwriter, however, he’s pointed, funny, and peculiar: It’s one thing to title an album “Just Like Moby Dick,” it’s another to justify the chutzpah in doing so. The music is the place to start with Mr. Allen’s oeuvre. “Truckload of Art” is the set of concrete blocks on which to place it.\n\n(c) 2024 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the April 4, 2024 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nToward the back of “Black Caesars and Foxy Cleopatras: A History of Blaxploitation Cinema,” a new book by a Boston Globe film critic, Odie Henderson, there is a list of the 10 best songs associated with the genre. The performers responsible for them are a veritable who’s-who of post-war popular music: Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops, Marvin Gaye, James Brown, Martha Reeves, Curtis Mayfield, and Isaac Hayes.\n\nThe latter’s “Theme From Shaft” is among the most distinctive earworms extant, an inescapable cultural landmark on the scale of Humphrey Bogart’s lisp, Marilyn Monroe’s airborne dress, and the Statue of Liberty’s torch. “Oh, come on,” Mr. Henderson writes, “you knew this was number one.” Whereupon he mentions its status as winner of the 1972 Oscar for Best Original Song. It also won a Grammy for Best Original Score and was later paid homage to on “Sesame Street” by, of all muppets, Cookie Monster.\n\nThat funky paean to the pleasures of macaroons, “Cookie Disco,” occurred just at the cusp at which the era of Blaxploitation was drawing to a close. What brought about the end of this “freewheeling, often shameless, and wildly influential cinema genre?”\n\nMr. Odie notes that Elvis Mitchell, a former film critic at the New York Times, places blame for the demise on the poor box office response to the pricey re-envisioning of “The Wizard of Oz,” “The Wiz” (1978). It’s not an unreasonable thesis: “Hollywood,” director Melvin Van Peebles noted, “has an Achilles’ pocketbook.”\n\nCould it have been television, though? Some of the highest-rated television shows of the time featured African-American casts, including “Good Times,” “Sanford and Son,” and “The Jeffersons.” Then there was the game-changing mini-series “Roots”: “a ratings blockbuster so potent that its viewing numbers … have never been repeated.” Why pay good money to attend the local movie palace when one can stay at home and be entertained for free?\n\nStandards of culture evolve and historical trends peter out. A change of societal mores can account for the deviation in the predilections of various audiences. Blaxploitation pictures had become “very cheap cash grabs” and were reaching a terminus of energy and inspiration. Yet the marketplace is nothing if not absorbent. The genre faded, but its influence runs deep. Rap music is inconceivable without Blaxploitation, as are talents as notable as Spike Lee, John Singleton, and Quentin Tarantino\n\nWhat was Blaxploitation? The term originated from circumstances that were far from commendatory. In 1972, a former head of the Hollywood branch of the NAACP, Junius Griffin, formed the “Coalition Against Blaxploitation” in response to the success of movies like “Cotton Comes to Harlem” (1970), “Shaft” (1971), and “Superfly” (1972). He claimed that such films, with their emphasis on sex, sensationalism, drugs, and violence, were a “form of cultural genocide.”\n\nLike Impressionism, Cubism, and, to a certain extent, jazz, Blaxploitation was a calumny that its practitioners took on as a badge of honor. There are few things more validating than thumbing one’s nose at presumed arbiters of moral virtue.\n\nThis is, in significant part, Mr. Odie’s rationale for putting a spotlight on what “many consider a disreputable series of films.” By keying into the country’s troubled history on racial matters, as well as the imperatives of popular culture, he locates the sociological worth of the films as markers of Black autonomy, as a forum for how marginalized people can “win at the end.”\n\nIf that all sounds heady, rest assured that Mr. Henderson may be a cineaste, but he’s also a fan. One of the pleasures of “Black Caesars and Foxy Cleopatras” is how deftly he navigates between matters of cinematic quality and the wiles of personal taste: “For better and for worse, Black people were front and center in Blaxploitation, playing the heroes and starring in their own tales.”\n\nAs he wends his way through the bumpy history of Blaxploitation, Mr. Henderson is upfront about the limitations of many of the films under discussion. When writing about the infamous “Mandingo” (1975), he states that it “should be evaluated only for what it is: TRASH!” Whereupon the author pauses, takes a beat, and exclaims “And it’s good trash, too!” We can disagree about Mr. Henderson’s opinion even while admiring his candor and enthusiasm.\n\n“A History of Blaxploitation” isn’t encyclopedic in its focus, but Mr. Henderson is thorough in delineating how the films were made, the stories they tell, and their subsequent reception by audiences, critics, and whoever else put in their two cents.\n\nMy lone complaint is that the author is prone to identitarian nostrums that are, alas, the lingua franca of a generation. Still, I have to thank him for mentioning grindhouse favorites from my misspent adolescence — those would be “The Twilight People” (1972), “Sssssss” (1973), and “The Beast Must Die” (1974) — and for providing a resource that is as unaffected as it is informed.\n\n(c) 2024 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the February 3, 2024 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nIn the great cause of critical integrity, let me state a conflict of interest right out of the gate: I am one of the producers of “Garland Jeffreys: The King of In Between.” All right, maybe not. I did, though, contribute to the film’s Kickstarter campaign in the amount of $25. A more princely sum was beyond my means, but Mr. Jeffreys’s music has been an integral part of my life and thanks had to be proffered, however humble.\n\nThe tagline for “The King of In Between” comes courtesy of an unnamed newscaster whose voice we hear during the film’s opening moments: “The name Garland Jeffreys either means nothing to you or everything to you.” Hyperbole is part-and-parcel of show business. Still, that’s not to say Mr. Jeffreys’s music hasn’t connected with audiences the world over. What those audiences may have lacked in size they made up for in loyalty and enthusiasm. And, of course, taste — but, again, I’m a fan.\n\n“The King of In Between” is, in large part, about the frustrations of stardom — or near-stardom — and the satisfactions inherent to a life lived with purpose. What, after all, is success? Toward the end of the picture, the musician Laurie Anderson, the widow of Mr. Jeffreys’s friend Lou Reed, ruminates on the definition. “I would assume you’re talking about public acknowledgment, but for many artists it would probably mean more like, ‘Did I write some really good songs?’”\n\nThe thing about really good songs is the artist responsible for them may not always be wise to their quality. At a concert at the Rubin Museum of Art in 2012, Mr. Jeffreys recounted the history of “Matador,” a song from his 1979 album “American Boy and Girl.” Adjacent to the studio at which Mr. Jeffreys was setting down tracks, he bumped into Gene Simmons of Kiss. Having overheard “Matador,” Mr. Simmons repeatedly extolled the song’s catchiness. But, really, is a self-anointed “demon” who spends much of his time cavorting in Kabuki make-up and 10-inch platform boots worth taking seriously?\n\nWhen it came time to decide on the first single from the album, the record execs at A&M insisted on “Bad Dream.” Recalling Mr. Simmons’s comments, Mr. Jeffreys put his foot down and insisted on “Matador.” Lo and behold, the song proved a sizable hit in Europe, reaching no. 1 in Germany and Austria, and doing very well in Switzerland and France. The now 80-year-old Mr. Jeffreys recounts this story in the film, clasps his hands together, and thanks Mr. Simmons with a laugh that is both deep and grateful.\n\nGratitude, though a palpable undercurrent in the film, is not the primary motif informing “The King of In Between.” Race and its tangled history in the United States has long been a subject of Mr. Jeffreys’s music, as well as a snag on his career. How, exactly, does one market a singer-songwriter of mixed-race parentage — Mr. Jeffreys’s father was Black, his mother Puerto Rican — who is as conversant with blues and soul as he is with rock and reggae?\n\nIn the film, we see photographs of record stores back in the day tagged with a variety of musical categories. The thing is, Mr. Jeffreys didn’t fit in any of them because, well, he fit in all of them. During a life in which he’s been The Next Big Thing several times over, Mr. Jeffreys took to some odd career tangents — appearing in blackface, for instance, or unknowingly recording a disco song. Is it me or does Mr. Jeffreys, looking back, seem more chagrined by the latter than the former?\n\nThe documentary has been directed by Claire Jeffreys — yes, the artist’s wife — and features testimony from the likes of Ms. Anderson, Harvey Keitel, Graham Parker, Vernon Reid, Bruce Springsteen, and Savannah Jeffreys — who, at one point in the film, is as embarrassed by her parents as any adolescent. There’s vintage film and photos of Coney Island, of which Mr. Jeffreys is a proud son, as well as concert footage.\n\nMy lone complaint is that his 1981 album “Escape Artist” — Mr. Jeffreys’s finest, I think — is only fleetingly alluded to. Still, “The King of In Between” does right by a temperament whose clarity and empathy have never been waylaid by a concurrent anger and frustration. Mr. Jeffreys has, in the end, found peace “about a thousand yards from the Cyclone.” We should all receive a valentine like “The King of In Between.”\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nThis article was originally published in the November 19, 2023 edition of “The New York Sun.”\n\nIn an interview with Vogue magazine a little more than a year ago, the director Sofia Coppola mentions that taking on “Priscilla,” her new movie based on Priscilla Presley’s 1985 book “Elvis and Me,” was done as a “pivot” away from an Edith Wharton adaptation that was proving burdensome. Wanting to make “one film with one idea,” Ms. Coppola likened Ms. Presley’s experience as a teenager coming of age within the “amplified world” of Elvis Presley as “kinda similar to Marie Antionette.”\n\nMs. Coppola, you might remember, helmed “Marie Antionette” (2006), a picture released to mixed reviews, though critics in France found much to recommend within its fast-and-loose historical parameters. Some opinion makers stateside took the film to task for a soundtrack that was largely ahistorical, wondering if songs by post-punk musicians like the Cure, Bow Wow Wow, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and New Order were suitable for evoking the resplendent environs and political machinations of 17th-century Versailles.\n\nMusic has always been a vital component of Ms. Coppola’s films. Bill Murray’s karaoke version of’ “More Than This” in “Lost in Translation” (2003) made plain the vulnerability that was occluded in the original by Roxy Music. The pivotal use of songs by the Jesus and Mary Chain in the same film did much to reboot their pop profile. Did “Marie Antionette” do something similar for Gang of Four when it featured the song “Natural’s Not In It”? Somehow, aggrieved Marxist caterwaul seems less user-friendly than Bryan Ferry keening about the vagaries of romance.\n\nThose expecting “Priscilla” to include an array of Elvis songs will be disappointed. Authentic Brands Group, the corporation that is a majority owner of Elvis Presley Enterprises, didn’t grant access to Ms. Coppola and her cohorts. My knowledge of copyright law being what it is, I wonder how a re-created snippet of “Guitar Man” from Elvis’s epochal 1968 television special made it into the movie. Still, anachronism in the soundtrack flourishes — from the Ramones to a just-out-of-chronological-sync Tommy James and the Shondells to Phoenix, a group headed by Ms. Coppola’s husband, Thomas Mars.\n\nHow true to life is “Priscilla”? The story of a 24-year old Elvis Presley courting 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu is as chaste, in its own weird way, as it is unseemly. What did the recently drafted pop idol, played by Jacob Elordi from the HBO series “Euphoria,” see in the daughter of Captain and Mrs. Paul Beaulieu (Ari Cohen and Dagmara Domincyzk)? An American girl, pure of mien. The junge frauen of Germany proved too starstruck to be good company.\n\nNot that your average ninth-grader back in 1959 didn’t know who Elvis Presley might be. When Priscilla (Cailee Spaeny) is given parental permission to join a party hosted by Presley, she arrives dumbfounded not only by the number of adults on hand, but by the attention bestowed on her by one of the world’s most famous men. After sequestering themselves together, Elvis admits to a level of insecurity about his diminishing fame. Priscilla tells him that “Heartbreak Hotel” is her favorite song.\n\nAfter taking Priscilla to the pictures — “Beat the Devil” (1953), of all things, is the film of choice — Elvis talks about becoming a movie star along the lines of Marlon Brando and James Dean. Although Elvis’s cinematic output is nowhere near as dreadful as it is often assumed, we know, at this late date, that Hollywood and his erstwhile manager, Tom “the Colonel” Parker, did much to tame Presley.\n\nIn “Priscilla,” the making of movies takes Elvis away from his beloved Priscilla and, should the gossip rags be believed, into the arms of co-stars like Ann Margaret. Tensions between Elvis and his pretty young ward increase, as does the usage of pills and, with them, stray moments of violence.\n\nDid the world really need another movie about Elvis Presley? Protestations to the side about this being Ms. Presley’s story, “Priscilla” tells us more about Elvis’s wants, needs, and failings than it does about its title character. As played out in Ms. Coppola’s script, Priscilla remains something of a cipher, more of a post-feminist sounding board than a full-fledged character.\n\nAdmittedly, that might be the point — proving just how dehumanizing unchecked masculinity might be. But when Priscilla either undergoes or instigates transitions in her relationship with Elvis, the audience is curiously absented from them. As a result, we remain perplexed by the inscrutable woman at the center of what is, in the end, a meandering and episodic picture.\n\nMs. Spaeny does her best with the bare bones given to her by Ms. Coppola. But one does have to wonder if the executive producer — that would be Ms. Presley herself — encouraged some massaging of biographical particulars? As it is, “Priscilla” is a handsomely mounted film of minor interest, a cinematic venture that falls flat by being more subtle and more evasive than its story warrants.\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the October 31, 2023 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nWhen notice of the new documentary by Peter Michael Dowd appeared in my email box, I clicked on the link, scanned its contents, and summarily deleted the message about “Mr. Jimmy.” As someone suspicious of nostalgia and the squishy comforts it proffers, the last thing I wanted on my docket was a film about a middle-aged man who has spent the greater part of his life trying to recapture the heady buzz of adolescence.\n\nWhy I later retrieved the missive from the good folks at Abramorama, a distributor of offbeat films based at Pleasantville, New York, I don’t know. The title of Mr. Dowd’s picture refers, at least in part, to Jimmy Page, the British musician who, sometime in the late 1960s, formed the band Led Zeppelin. Perhaps you’ve heard of them.\n\nLed Zeppelin’s music, though an inescapable part of the cultural landscape during my teen years, never suited my taste. It was only in middle age that I understood the inherent humor in the band’s enterprise. With their admixture of gargantuan riffs and folky medievalisms, Mr. Page and his cohorts set out to create the musical equivalent of a brontosaurus attempting a pirouette. Pursuits as inherently quixotic as that can’t help but garner some admiration.\n\n“Mr. Jimmy” is similarly quixotic in its detailing of the life and ambitions of Akio Sakurai, a Tokyo-based kimono salesman who has spent 30 years proselytizing on behalf of Led Zeppelin and, in particular, Mr. Page. Physically, Mr. Sakurai is all but a dead-ringer for the guitarist as he appears in the 1976 movie, “The Song Remains the Same.” The spindly frame, the generous mop of hair, and a similarity in facial structure — pair all of that with body language that speaks of hours spent studying concert footage, and Mr. Sakurai more than earns the title sobriquet.\n\nBut, then, Mr. Page is also a musician, and it’s testament to Mr. Sakurai’s powers of concentration and indomitable drive that he proves almost as walloping a talent on the guitar as his hero. “What’s amazing about ‘Mr. Jimmy’ Sakurai …,” the founder of a custom guitar workshop, Makoto Fukano, says, is that “he’s maintained that passion since he first heard [Led Zeppelin] and that initial shock.” “Obsessive” is a word bandied about a few times during the course of the film, but Mr. Sakurai’s ardor for all things Zeppelin is indicative less of neurosis, I think, than of love.\n\nThis isn’t to say that his venture is without its quiddities or that he isn’t a piece of work. Mr. Sakurai is a scholar, a purist, and a perfectionist. What doesn’t he know about Led Zeppelin? Forget the albums, the bootleg CDs, the films and books. There are also the guitars, the amplifiers, the cords, the bobbins, and the Les Paul pickup guards with their angular edges and scalloped holes replicated by Atsushi Iwasaki and Naoki Washida, craftsmen of boundless patience and impeccable skill. If you’re working for Mr. Jimmy, the last two attributes are musts.\n\nThen there’s the Black Dragon suit worn by Mr. Page during Led Zeppelin’s 1975 tour. Mr. Sakurai has tasked both his wife Junko and Kiyomi Osawa, a Yokoburi embroiderer, to replicate the outfit. Every last stitch is accounted for; colors are gainsaid, double-checked, and ultimately put in order. Among the electrical technicians with whom Mr. Sakurai works is Kishimoto, a man of sober temperament who’s got a pretty good peg on his client: “Ultimately he’s going for something that doesn’t have an answer.”\n\nWhen Jimmy Page — not a simulacrum, but the man himself — shows up for one of Mr. Sakurai’s gigs, well, things change. Mr. Jimmy packs his bags, heads to the United States, and plies his trade in a tribute band called Led Zepagain. Whereupon follows a clash of egos, of cultures, and, not least, of artistic purpose.\n\nMr. Sakurai’s unbending adherence to Led Zeppelin’s music is called into question. He loses faith, money, band members, and friends. How this story pans out is better left unspoiled, but the trip Mr. Dowd has chronicled has keen things to say about the perils of the creative life, the imperishability of art, and the rewards that come with persistence. “Mr. Jimmy” is a deceptive and, in the end, peculiarly profound motion picture.\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nThis article was originally published in the September 1, 2023 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nThe documentary filmmaker Les Blank, who died in 2013 at the age of 77, did the lord’s work. Likely best known for “Garlic is as Good as Ten Mothers” (1980), “Burden of Dreams” (1982), and “Gap Toothed Women” (1987), Blank’s primary enterprise was the chronicling of American vernacular music. From Dizzy Gillespie and Lightnin’ Hopkins to Clifton Chenier and the Wild Tchoupitoulas, Blank set out to valorize cultural byways that were off the beaten commercial path. In doing so, he preserved many of them for the historical record.\n\nOf course, there was that venture with, of all people, Huey Lewis and the News, and “A Poem is a Naked Person,” a project commissioned and subsequently quashed by the musician Leon Russell. Still, Blank’s heart was down with the people and, especially it seems, those ensconced in rural Louisiana. For his efforts, Blank received any number of accolades and honors, including the American Film Institute’s Maya Deren Award for “outstanding lifetime achievement.” Although his reputation isn’t far-ranging, it does cut deeply for those wise to his accomplishments as the most unassuming of anthropologists.\n\nAn abiding fondness for idiosyncrasy and ethnic food mark his documentaries, as does, it should be admitted, a gentle strain of noblesse oblige. “I try to show that the people in my films are human beings who have just as much right to be on this earth as anybody else. Maybe more right.” If Blank can be faulted for romanticizing the margins of culture, he should be applauded for holding true to the quiddities of localism. Time waits for no man, but Blank surely was not going to let it steamroll his quirks without capturing them on film.\n\n“I Went to the Dance” (1989), a disarming overview of Zydeco and Cajun music, is being re-released in a version that has been restored, remastered, and otherwise put right. It offers an object lesson in the complications, contradictions, and, in the end, tangible rewards of what can only be called the American experiment. After a short clip of a convivial Queen Ida — who refers to Louisiana as a country behind “the iron curtain” of the United States — Blank capitulates to conventional documentary form by running an abbreviated text outlining the historical markers that went into shaping the music.\n\nIt’s a story about the promiscuous commingling of cultures, beginning in 1755 when the British expelled French-speaking Acadians out of Nova Scotia, resulting in their trek to the bayous of Louisiana. The Acadians set down roots in a community composed of Free Men of Color, Native Americans, and other European settlers. The Irish had a strong hand in shaping the keening tonalities of Cajun music, but the most sweeping influence was that of Black Creoles. The latter, folklorist Barry Jean Ancelet explains, are pivotal in understanding the difference between Acadian and Cajun music.\n\nToward the beginning of “I Went to the Dance,” a player and maker of accordions, Marc Savoy, provides a step-by-step explanation — a recipe, really — of Cajun music. After extolling the benefits of the accordion in terms of volume (loud) and durability (tough), Mr. Savoy runs through the seven notes that “tell the story.” He plays “J’ai Passe Devant Ta Porte,” all the while elaborating on “the simple melody” by making eighth notes out of full notes, pushing and drawing the octaves and chords, and then adding “the little embellishments that make it ornate.” It is the last step that proves the most illusive and, wouldn’t you just know it, the most magical.\n\nBlank inventories a variety of musicians whose fame didn’t extend much beyond the region. You’ve likely never heard of Iry LeJeune, whose death in an auto accident at age 26 didn’t prevent him from racking up significant sales, or the eerie wail of Cléoma Falcon, who, with her husband Joe Falcon, recorded “The Waltz That Carried Me To My Grave,” among the first pieces of Cajun music put to wax. We follow the genre as it encounters bumps in the road — foremost among them, the advent of rock ’n’ roll — and how the folk revival of the 1960s proved indispensable in shining a new light on that distinctive wail and those scurrying rhythms.\n\nHow Cajun and Zydeco are faring in the here-and-now is a good question. A quick surf of the web shows that Wayne Toups, seen in “I Went to the Dance” as a testosterone-charged 20-something, is still at it and, from the looks of it, he’s at it hard. “Always for Pleasure,” the title of an earlier Blank documentary, was the director’s modus operandi and a sentiment that proves just as apt for this modest slice of subcultural reportage.\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nThis article was originally published in the August 30, 2023 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nFame is ephemeral and retrospect often unforgiving: This fairly obvious truism applies to, among myriad others, Paul Whiteman (1890-1967), an inescapable figure in American popular music for whom time and taste have not been kind.\n\nWhiteman, nicknamed “The King of Jazz,” helmed one of the most popular big bands during the 1920s and ’30s, and did much to popularize the artform. He cut a striking figure — Whiteman comes on like a nattier Oliver Hardy — and hired some of the best musicians in the business, including legendary figures like Bix Biederbecke and Jack Teagarden. Among his achievements was asking George Gershwin for something that later became known as “Rhapsody in Blue.”\n\nWhiteman was also that most loathsome of creatures: a cultural appropriator. Although he was supportive of African-American musicians — he commissioned pieces from Duke Ellington; worked with arrangers like William Grant Still and Don Redman; and provided backing for Paul Robeson’s signature version of “Ol’ Man River” — his music has been deemed over-orchestrated, tasteful to a fault, and exclusionary. Sweeping Whiteman under the rug is, by jazz cognoscenti, the preferred manner by which to acknowledge him.\n\nThat being said, good luck trying to avoid tussling with the controversies surrounding Whiteman or America’s racial history upon watching “King of Jazz” (1930), a film included in “Eye Candy: The Coming of Color,” a series of pictures presented by the Museum of Modern Art in conjunction with the exhibition “Before Technicolor: Early Color on Film.”\n\nAs curators James Layton and David Kehr remind us, color movies have been with us, in one form or another, since 1895. That color was once considered “a white elephant to the cinematic medium” will likely come as a surprise to audiences today.\n\n“Eye Candy” was organized by a curator in the Department of Film, Ron Magliozzi, and includes a number of noteworthy pictures, such as the original (and best) “Phantom of the Opera” (1925), with Lon Chaney in the title role; Cecil B. Demille’s first go-round with “The Ten Commandments” (1923); and the seminal science fiction movie “A Trip to the Moon” (1902), by Georges Méliès. Also included are experimental films by Len Lye and Oskar Fischinger, bopping arrays of shape, geometry, and text that would later be lampooned by Mel Brooks in his Academy Award-winning short “The Critic” (1963).\n\nStill, “King of Jazz” is the most noteworthy of the bunch and not just because it will rankle contemporary sensibilities. You don’t have to be the wokest bloke on the block to rue an era in which African Americans were explicitly denied their role in shaping American pop culture, as is the case here with “Melting Pot of Music,” the grand finale of “King of Jazz.” As for that appellation, Whiteman neither generated nor declined it. As a man who stated that “jazz came to America three hundred years ago in chains,” he was wise to the irony implicit in his royal status.\n\nHaving said all that, “King of Jazz” is wild and weird, an old-fashioned entertainment that has accrued an almost hallucinogenic patina. It’s a variety show, basically: a trundling out of musical numbers, dance routines, novelty acts, comedic aperçus, and even a cartoon. Built around the conceit of “Paul Whiteman’s Scrapbook,” the movie turns its pages through some glitzy nightclub settings that have a lot of moving parts and are often gargantuan in scale. Universal Pictures sunk a pretty penny into this venture.\n\nThe studio didn’t recoup its costs — “King of Jazz” was later dubbed “Universal’s Rhapsody in Red” — and the critical consensus was, you know, meh. Perhaps audiences had to reconnoiter after the initial all-talking, all-singing novelty of sound had begun to wear thin. That didn’t prevent one young man from achieving greater things. Yes, that’s a cherry-pink Bing Crosby making his feature movie debut as one of The Rhythm Boys, the vocal component of Whiteman’s orchestra.\n\n“King of Jazz” was filmed in a process keyed to green and red, and the resulting film has a softly saturated, almost spongy tactility. The narrow range of chroma — at moments sickly sweet, at other times acidic — gives the picture an otherworldly tenor. The 10-minute segment dedicated to “Rhapsody in Blue” tends toward a velvety aquamarine and is kaleidoscopic in its “Alice in Wonderland” shifts in scale. How this film didn’t become a staple back in the heyday of Haight-Ashbury, I don’t know.\n\nDirector John Murray Anderson seems to have been channeling the Russian Constructivists in his employment of skewed camera angles, abrupt close-ups, and crisply defined choreography. Herman Rosse, a veteran of Broadway stagecraft, won an Oscar for Best Art Direction and then, in a filip that isn’t as counterintuitive as it might seem, went on to design the sets for James Whale’s “Frankenstein” (1931).\n\nAs for the toy-like line-up of chorines known as the Russell Markert Dancers: they eventually morphed, fancy that, into the Rockettes. Their renown remains undiminished here in 2023 — unlike that of Whiteman, who is the affable locus of a perpetually stupefying film. “King of Jazz” is a trip. Kudos to MoMA for making it available on the big screen.\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nThis article was originally published in the August 22, 2023 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nFew items that have come through the transom in recent months have elicited as much joy, as much wonder and surprise, as “Soundies: The Ultimate Collection,” a four-disc Blu-Ray set released by Kino Lorber. For devotees of American popular music, the package is nothing short of a necessity, being a cornucopia of mid-century song and dance. Kino Lorber has, in other words, come bearing gifts — more than a few being rare, many exultant, and some a bit troublesome. More on that anon.\n\nWhat, you might ask, is a Soundie? The ready answer is that they’re antecedents to music videos, and the device on which they were played, the Panoram, a kissing cousin to the jukebox. The author of “Soundies and the Changing Image of Black Americans On Screen; One Dime at a Time” and curator of the Kino Lorber set, Susan Delson, posits these mini-movies as “a little-known way-station in the long migration of the moving image to ever smaller screens.” Their hey-day was the years during World War II and their purview, inadvertent but inescapable, a changing America.\n\nClose to two-dozen businesses were producing coin-operated video machines in 1940, but only one ultimately thrived. By 1942, the Chicago-based Mills Novelty Company was the last Panoram standing and its typical habitue was the back of the bar. The cost of playing a three-minute Soundie was a thin dime, but, as the New York Times reported, that made them “the highest-priced cinema entertainment,” considering most people would play several at a sitting. The typical movie ticket of the era was about a quarter. That, and Soundies didn’t come with a newsreel and a cartoon.\n\nWhat they did come with was a staggering array of talent and a kaleidoscopic overview of the nation’s citizenry. “Stirring Up the Melting Pot” is the title of one section of “Soundies,” and I dare say the collection, as a whole, gives a truer overview of American culture than did Hollywood of the time. That a significant number of Soundies are devoted to country music, rhythm and blues, and the leggy charms of the female form — Army bases being another locale in which you’d find the Panoram — points to savvy entrepreneurs who took into account the specific market in which the video jukebox would be situated. It wouldn’t be the first time capitalist initiative would benefit artistic fact.\n\nTake into account some of the figures peppering this sterling collection: the Nat Cole Trio, Merle Travis, Hoagy Carmichael, Duke Ellington, Louis Jordan and His Tympany Five, Stan Kenton, Fats Waller, Cab Calloway, Les Paul, Doris Day, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, and an up-and-coming pianist then known as Walter Liberace. Fans of the New York boroughs other than Manhattan will take note of a very young Ricardo Montalban making his screen debut as the titular heartthrob in “He’s a Latin from Staten Island.” “Soundies” captures them all in exuberant fettle.\n\nEach section of “Soundies” comes with an introduction by Ms. Delson, often in tandem with the media conservationist at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, Ina Archer. They’re on hand to provide historical context, but even as they do the two scholars can’t resist engaging in identitarian cant. We’re cautioned, for instance, about “misplaced exoticism” and told, with a straight face, that the 1940s “were not a non-binary era.”\n\nRace relations back in the day were fraught, cultural stereotypes commonplace, and let’s not forget the country was at war — all of which are reflected, to varying degrees of emphasis, in “Soundies.” We’re likely to roll our eyes at a toe-tapper like “We’ll Slap the Japs (Right into the Laps of the Nazis),” and not without reason, but history and its more tendentious artifacts should instill humility, not righteousness. The good news is that “Soundies,” for the most part, lets the content speak for itself.\n\nThere are innumerable finds in a set as varied as this one. A sleek Maurice Rocco clears the road for Little Richard, and Harry “The Hipster” Gibbon does much the same for Jerry Lee Lewis. Day, Dawn and Dusk, a trio of African-American singers adept at commingling high and low culture, weren’t only mellifluous vocalists but gifted comedians. Elsewhere, Dorothy Dandridge and Gale Storm are seen to glorious effect, strange drifts of Surrealism sneak into the proceedings, and a pop standard, “Along the Navajo Trail,” is done up more than right by the estimable John “Shadrach” Horace and Johnny Moore’s 3 Blazers.\n\nWhat are you waiting for? “Soundies” is a valuable contribution to our understanding of 20th century America and an indicator of how pop culture may well be the most effective agent for fostering true diversity.\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nThis article was originally published in the July 27, 2023 edition of The New York Sun.\n\n“Syd Barrett,” Roddy Bogawa writes in the notes accompanying a new documentary, “just happened to become one of the most famous cult icons in music.” This raises a question: What is the criterion for such a designation? If “Have You Got It Yet? The Story of Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd,” the film Mr. Bogawa co-directed with the late Storm Thorgerson, is an indication, the answer is neither simple nor happy.\n\nWe all know Pink Floyd. Although it’s been some 40 years since its heyday, the band continues to roll on in one permutation or another and, sometimes, to consternating effect: Witness the recent controversies surrounding a former member, Roger Waters, and his apparent fondness for antisemitic tropes. Be that as it may, albums like “Dark Side of the Moon,” “Wish You Were Here,” and “The Wall” are staples of popular culture to this day. How many millions of albums have Pink Floyd sold? Only their accountants know for sure.\n\nThen there’s Syd Barrett. Few members of the audiences who have sung along with “Money” or “Comfortably Numb” are likely to be familiar with the name, though Barrett did serve as the inspiration for “Shine On You Crazy Diamond,” among the group’s signature songs. As it turns out, Barrett was the veritable sine qua non of Pink Floyd, a charismatic and troubled figure who started the ball rolling but didn’t have the wherewithal to follow its trajectory.\n\n“Have You Got It Yet?” tells the story of Roger Keith Barrett (1946-2006) through documentary footage, a range of talking heads, and some cleverly constructed fantasy segments. The latter, I’m guessing, are courtesy of Thorgerson, who was co-founder, along with Aubrey Powell, of Hipgnosis, a graphic design company that created album art for the likes of Led Zeppelin, Peter Gabriel, and, yes, Pink Floyd. The sequences featuring actors taking on the role of Barrett at different moments in his life wandering through Maxfield Parrish-like dioramas are appropriately heady in character.\n\nHow did young Barrett come to be known as Syd? Accounts vary as to whether it stemmed from the jazz musician Sid “The Beat” Barrett, the comic actor Sid James, or simply came about because the name seemed suitably prole. What is certain is that Barrett was a precocious and talented youth, exhibiting talent in painting as much as for music. The advent of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan put paid to the notion of spending endless days in an atelier inhaling turpentine fumes. Rock ’n’ roll beckoned and, after pursuing an array of blind alleys and membership in different bands, Pink Floyd came to fruition.\n\nThe band’s first single, “Arnold Layne,” an encomium to transvestism, was banned by the BBC, but the follow-up, “See Emily Play,” proved a hit, earning Pink Floyd an invitation to perform the song on three separate occasions for the long-running television program “Top of the Pops.” Both songs were written by Barrett, as was the majority of the group’s debut album, “The Piper at the Gates of Dawn” (1967). The record is unlike anything else in Pink Floyd’s corpus, being a jaunty psychedelic foray that owes as much to Edward Lear, Lewis Carroll, and “The Wind in the Willows” as it does to Carnaby Street, Jimi Hendrix, and LSD.\n\nLSD does figure mightily in Barrett’s life and likely exacerbated an already fragile temperament. As Pink Floyd’s fame increased, his behavior became increasingly erratic — Mr. Bogowa’s film includes a clip from “American Bandstand” in which Dick Clark does his best to converse with a near-catatonic Barrett. The band ultimately abandons their leader on the way to a gig. Barrett took a few halting stabs at a solo career, but basically lived the rest of his days in isolation, his renown as a “mad genius” increasing the further he retreated from public life.\n\n“Have You Got It Yet?” is a cautionary tale about stardom, madness, and the excesses of a decade whose reverberations resonate today.\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nThis article was originally published in the July 14, 2023 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nAt the risk of iterating shopworn arguments about form and content, let me point out the discrepancy between the two, at least for this listener, when it comes to the music of the Baseball Project. When news came over the transom — or, as aficionados might have it, from the rubber — that the band’s fourth album was nearing release, I marked the calendar.\n\nYet while the Baseball Project’s first three volumes — “Frozen Ropes and Dying Quails,” “High and Inside,” and “3rd” — are an integral component of my music library, I don’t know a thing about baseball and remain, if not oblivious to the game’s attractions, indifferent to its appeal. Having been dragged to a single Mets game back when the stadium was still named after William Shea, I sat in the nose-bleed seats and took note of the field’s geometry and the precision by which the players maneuvered its parameters. Otherwise, my knowledge of America’s greatest pastime is nonexistent. What I do know about is punk rock.\n\nThe Baseball Project is counted, for those of us once ensconced at the margins of popular culture, as a supergroup. Back in the day, my friends and I pored over the latest offerings from the Dream Syndicate, R.E.M., and the Young Fresh Fellows as if they were vinyl equivalents of the Talmud. We knew that Steve Wynn, Peter Buck, Mike Mills, and Scott McCaughey had gleaned every last lick from “Nuggets” — that is to say, the canon of 1960s garage rock — and that the Velvet Underground, the Stooges, and Big Star were touchstones. Yet who knew they were grateful to their moms and dads for not trashing their baseball card collections? That’s not punk at all.\n\nBeginning with “Frozen Ropes and Dying Quails” (2008) — terminology that can be deciphered, should one be interested, at the official website for Major League Baseball — these rock ‘n’ rollers shelved their day jobs in order to indulge their passion for baseball. Propelled by drummer Linda Pitmon, Mr. Wynn’s wife and a self-confessed sucker for pinstripes, the Baseball Project proved that pop music usages sharpened, streamlined, and transmogrified over time could be fitted to the story of Harvey Haddix and his near perfect game or the bittersweet tale of Larry Yount’s short-lived career as a pro.\n\nThen there’s Mr. McCaughey’s melancholy encomium to Carl Mays, whose pitch for the 1920s Yankees felled Ray Chapman of the team once known as the Cleveland Indians, resulting in the game’s only on-field fatality. Narrated by the title character from behind the grave, “Here Lies Carl Mays” juxtaposes the peacefulness of Cleveland’s Lake View Graveyard with a curse presumably set into motion by “that killer pitch.” Pretty hard stuff for a pop song.\n\nHaving said that, the most surprising thing about the Baseball Project is its sense of humor. Admittedly, Mr. McCaughey’s Young Fresh Fellows were a snarky outfit — their best-known song imagined the Christian pop singer Amy Grant getting busy with Barry White, yuk-yuk. But Mr. Wynn’s songs about desperate lives written for the Dream Syndicate didn’t lend themselves to laughter, nor was R.E.M. necessarily known for its sparkling wit. Lilting melodies and folkish rondels, yes; knee-slappers, no.\n\nBut the Baseball Project is loose-limbed, unpretentious, and eager for a joke. The songs admit to winking musical readymades — yes, a stadium organ figures into them — and lyrics that abound with good will and, or so one likes to think, a graciousness that comes with age. Would the ennui-besotted Mr. Wynn, circa-1981, have dared a rhyme as unlikely as “card-carrying member of Mensa” and “MVP trophies on my credenza”? Consider, as well, the raucous title opener for the new album “Grand Salami Time!” in which Mr. McCaughey runs through a compendium of “genius/knucklehead announcer catchphrases.” Even the most doctrinaire of Dadaists would have to smile at lines like, “He kicks and deals, a screaming yellow yakker” and “Hey! Ain’t the beer cold. How ’bout a Doozie Marooney.”\n\nNone of the Baseball Project’s albums are bad, but “Grand Salami Time!” is a distinct cut above “3rd,” which betrayed a thinness of inspiration. The new record is unstoppable — the result, perhaps, of nine years of preparation. Among the highlights are Mr. Wynn channeling Mississippi John Hurt for his tribute to Jose Fernandez in “That’s Living” and the spooky groove of “The Stuff,” in which we learn how vaseline, pine tar, and saliva “give my curveball that extra bite/Make my sinker slide out of sight.”\n\nWhat rye, mustard, salami, and Grandma have to do with baseball, I don’t know, but they’re all good things, as is this joyous and rollicking record.\n\n(c) 2023 Mario Naves\n\nThis article was originally published in the June 26, 2023 edition of The New York Sun."
