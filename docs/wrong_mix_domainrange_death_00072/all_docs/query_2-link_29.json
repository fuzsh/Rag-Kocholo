        "text": "I remember when this was released I was very excited to see that Hank Jr. had signed with the resurrected Capricorn Records. It seemed like a natural fit for him. I remember being disappointed when I first bought this. Seemed way too mellow and laid back. The album has grown on me since then. I really like the covers of old soul numbers like the title track and Joe Tex's \"Hold What You've Got\". A couple of other standouts for me are \"Everything Comes Down To Money And Love\" and the humorous \"I'm Tired\".\n\nOn the other side of the coin the 2 big duds for me are \"Diamond Mine\" and \"Blue Lady In The Red Mercedes\".\n\nThis album follows the pattern that Bocephus has pretty much followed for the last 3 decades. A few very good songs, some ok filler and some real crap. For the hardcore fans (of which I count myself) mostly. If you wanted to introduce a newcomer to his music this album wouldn't be a good starting place.\n\nHank hasn't done his legacy any favors by releasing these half baked albums over the years. As was stated, there really isn't any of the self-referential bluster (that has been done to death) on this album. And that's a good thing in my book.\n\nThe best album Hank Jr. has released since the late 80's is IMHO \"The Almeria Club\". A very strong record that unfortunately kind of came and went without much notice.\n\nAgree! 'The Almeria Club' is probably his last great album. I do like 'I'm One Of You', some great songs on that and\n\nI played that and Almeria to death at the time.\n\nThe last 3 albums however are just one blur of winging and whining and it gets a bit old after a couple of songs.\n\nI've bought them, and really have tried to like them being a Hank Jr fan, but I'm left with 'meh',\n\n'here he goes again'..... rant rant rant....\n\nYou could probably take the last 3 albums and make one good actually.\n\nOne of the better tunes, I wish he'd get back to this type of stuff:"
