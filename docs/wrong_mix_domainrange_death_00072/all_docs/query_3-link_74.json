Index.\n\nCompiled by members of the Texas Folklore Society, this collection of pieces that focus on gatherings of all kinds ranges from personal reflections to scholarly analyses. Some authors discuss the place that gatherings have in marking all stages of life, from birth to death, while others consider gatherings based on special interests, such as crafting and music. more... about Gather 'Round: Gatherings in Texas and the Southwest\n\nWhere to Carry the Sound\n\n— Vol. 23: of Katherine Anne Porter Prize in Short Fiction\n\nPublished: Pages: 224\n\nThe stories in Where to Carry the Sound center on characters excavating their own lives: unearthing family secrets, exploring inherited silences, and rediscovering what might have seemed lost to them. Wherever these characters find themselves—including brewing bootleg liquor in Prohibition-era Bombay, finding remnants of a new language at an archaeological dig in Andhra Pradesh, seeking mirages above the Arctic Circle, or setting up an outpost on the moon—each seeks to reconcile a past continually bleeding into the present and to forge a path of belonging to carry them into the future. more... about Where to Carry the Sound\n\nTubby: Raymond O.

Index.\n\nEntering West Point from central Oklahoma, Raymond O. Barton’s prowess on the football field and wrestling team earned him the nickname “Tubby,” an appellation used by his friends and fellow officers for the rest of his life. Based on personal letters and documents, this biography explores Barton’s military career from his days as a cadet through thirty-seven years of military service, culminating with his command in World War II of the 4th Infantry Division during the US Army’s campaign in France. From the inside readers have a picture of officership during the intense days of training and expansion on the eve of World War II. Finally, thanks to the discovery of his war diary, we have a close-up view of his senior leadership as he trained in England for the landing on Utah Beach on June 6, 1944. more... about Tubby: Raymond O.

Index.\n\nTombstone, Arizona, is forever associated with Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Doc Holliday, and the legendary OK Corral gunfight that made it a cultural symbol of the Old West. The town’s most iconic and storied original building is the Bird Cage Theater—a stunning example of late nineteenth-century variety theaters that were a staple in entertainment around the globe. The modest interior that was once filled with orchestra music, cigar smoke, laughter and whistles, and cheers and jeers is now an empty canvas for the echoes of the past. more... about The Bird Cage Theater: The Curtain Rises on Tombstone, Arizona’s National Treasure\n\nThe Best American Newspaper Narratives, Volume 11\n\nPublished: Pages: 320\n\nThis anthology collects the nine winners of the 2023 Best American Newspaper Narrative Writing Contest at UNT’s Mayborn Literary Nonfiction Conference.

C. Greene Series\n\nPublished: Pages: 240 Features: 27 b&w illus. Map. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nIn western New Mexico in 1905 there rode a notorious outlaw from the Mexican border named Henry Coleman. With a Colt .45 strapped to his hip, Coleman (alias Street Hudspeth from the well-to-do Texas family) came to be either despised as a deceitful rustler and ruthless murderer or admired as a man of honor and great courage, a popular and charismatic cowman who was fast with a gun. No one seemed indifferent. more... about Murder on the Largo: Henry Coleman and New Mexico’s Last Frontier\n\nTracking the Texas Ranger Historians\n\nPublished: Pages: 400 Features: Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nThe first systematic inquiry into the Texas Rangers did not begin until 1935 with Walter Prescott Webb’s publication The Texas Rangers. Since then numerous works have appeared on the Rangers, but no volume has been published before that covers the various historians of the Rangers and their approaches to the topic. Editors Bruce A. Glasrud and Harold J.

Linda J. Quintanilla describes Jiménez’s lifelong battle against injustice, be it racist, sexist, or anti-immigrant animus. The Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride in 2003, only one of her many impressive achievements, delighted her the most. The experience introduced its participants, undocumented immigrants, to historic places and African American activists and descendants from the Civil Rights Movement. more... about Warriors for Social Justice: Maria Jiminez of Houston and Mexican American Activists\n\nDesire to Serve: The Autobiography of Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson\n\nPublished: Pages: 464 Features: 35 b&w illus. Notes. Index.\n\nDesire to Serve is the autobiography of Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson (1934–2023), a thirty-year member of the United States House of Representatives, in her words as told to Cheryl Brown Wattley. It chronicles Johnson growing up in segregated Waco, Texas; attending St. Mary’s nursing school in South Bend, Indiana; working at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Dallas, Texas, as a chief psychiatric nurse; serving in the Texas House; being appointed as the regional director for Health, Education and Welfare; being elected as a Texas state senator; and serving thirty years as a congressional representative from North Texas.

C. Greene Series\n\nPublished: Pages: 256 Features: 54 b&w illus. 2 maps. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nWhen New Mexico became part of the United States, the territory contained 295 land grants, the largest of these being the Maxwell Land Grant. The size and boundaries of the grant were disputed, with some believing that much of the land was public domain. Settlers on this land were fought not only by the land grant owners but also by a group of corrupt politicians and lawyers— known as the Santa Fe Ring (most notably Thomas Catron and Stephen Elkins)—who tried to use the situation for personal profit and land acquisition. more... about The Colfax County War: Violence and Corruption in Territorial New Mexico\n\nFraming Oak Cliff: A Visual Diary of a Dallas Neighborhood\n\n— Vol. 1: of Seeing Texas Series\n\nPublished: Pages: 160 Features: 116 duotone photos.\n\nIn this stunning collection of black-and-white photographs, photographer Richard Doherty takes a deep visual dive into Oak Cliff, the southwest Dallas neighborhood where he has lived for the past four decades. Using a variety of film cameras, Doherty combines vivid, sweeping panoramic images on the main business drag, Jefferson Boulevard, with intimate portraits of people in their workplaces, homes, and yards. These evocative, richly detailed images reveal the unique character of the diverse people, social landscapes, and personal spaces in this often-overlooked section of Dallas. more... about Framing Oak Cliff: A Visual Diary of a Dallas Neighborhood\n\nFelling\n\n— Vol. 31: of Vassar Miller Prize in Poetry\n\nPublished: Pages: 80\n\nThis collection is a record of one man’s navigation of loss, addiction, and labor. At once a meditation on the allure of a legacy in self-destruction and a giving over to hope, Felling is an exploration in honesty. Rendered in direct language and through clear eyes, this book, as its title indicates, is concerned with tensions of agency, creation, and destruction— upward and downward motion. more... about Felling\n\n“Winner, Vassar Miller Prize in Poetry”\n\nThe Business of Sustainability in Fashion: Following the Threads\n\nPublished: Pages: 320 Features: Notes.

Index.\n\nFerdinand Lindheimer was already renowned as the father of Texas botany when, in late 1852, he became the founding editor of the Neu-Braunfelser Zeitung, a German-language weekly newspaper for the German settler community on the Central Texas frontier. His first year of publication was a pivotal time for the settlers and the American Indians whose territories they occupied.

Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nFrom their founding in the 1820s up to the modern age, the Texas Rangers have shown the ability to adapt and survive. Part of that survival depended on their use of firearms. The evolving technology of these weapons often determined the effectiveness of these early-day Rangers. John Coffee “Jack” Hays and Samuel Walker would leave their mark on the Rangers by incorporating new technology which allowed them to alter tactics when confronting their adversaries. The Frontier Battalion was created at about the same time as the Colt Peacemaker and the Winchester 73—these were the guns that “won the West.” more... about Firearms of the Texas Rangers: From the Frontier Era to the Modern Age\n\nThe Best American Newspaper Narratives, Volume 7\n\nPublished: Pages: 288\n\nThis anthology collects the winners of the 2019 Best American Newspaper Narrative Writing Contest at UNT’s Mayborn Literary Nonfiction Conference.

Gouhenant set up shop as a daguerreotypist and photographed the town’s early residents.

In the frenzy that followed the robbery, the media castigated both lawmen and government officials, at times lauded the outlaws, and indulged in trial by media. At Flatonia the gang tortured the passengers and indulged in an orgy of violence that earned them international recognition and infamy. Private enterprises, such as Wells Fargo, the railroads, and numerous banks, joined forces with law enforcement to combat them. Lawmen from cities and counties combined with federal marshals and the Texas Rangers to further cement what would become the “brotherhood of the badge.” These efforts succeeded in tracking down and killing or capturing a good number of the gang members. more... about The Cornett-Whitley Gang: Violence Unleashed in Texas\n\nMinding the Helm: An Unlikely Career in the U.S. Coast Guard\n\n— Vol. 14: of North Texas Military Biography and Memoir Series\n\nPublished: Pages: 304 Features: 28 b&w illus.

Map. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nDavid R. “Buff” Honodel was a cocky young man with an inflated self-image when he arrived in 1969 at his base in Udorn, Thailand. His war was not in Vietnam; it was a secret one in the skies of a neighboring country almost unknown in America, attacking the Ho Chi Minh Trail that fed soldiers and supplies from North Vietnam into the South. Stateside he learned the art of flying the F-4, but in combat, the bomb-loaded fighter handled differently, targets shot back, and people suffered. Inert training ordnance was replaced by lethal weapons. In the air, a routine day mission turned into an unexpected duel with a deadly adversary. Complacency during a long night mission escorting a gunship almost led to death. A best friend died just before New Year’s.

First as a deputy sheriff, then county sheriff, and finally captain of the notorious Texas State Police, he developed a reputation as a violent and ruthless man-hunter. He arrested many suspected lawbreakers, but often his prisoner was killed before reaching a jail for “attempting to escape.” This horrific tendency ultimately brought about his downfall. Helm’s aggressive enforcement of his version of “law and order” resulted in a deadly confrontation with two of his enemies in the midst of the Sutton-Taylor Feud. more... about Captain Jack Helm: A Victim of Texas Reconstruction Violence\n\nHigher Education in Texas: Its Beginnings to 1970\n\nPublished: Pages: 368 Features: 20 b&w photos.

Brice grappled with several issues when deciding how to relate a general history of the Texas Rangers. Should emphasis be placed on their frontier defense against Indians, or focus more on their role as guardians of the peace and statewide law enforcers? What about the tumultuous Mexican Revolution period, 1910-1920? And how to deal with myths and legends such as One Riot, One Ranger? more... about Texas Rangers: Lives, Legend, and Legacy\n\nOrdered West: The Civil War Exploits of Charles A. Curtis\n\n— Vol. 13: of War and the Southwest Series\n\nPublished: Pages: 704 Features: 31 b&w illus. 4 maps. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Charles Curtis served in the 5th United States Infantry on the New Mexico and Arizona frontier. He spent his years from 1862 to 1865 on garrison duty, interacting with Native Americans, both hostile and friendly. Years after his service and while president of Norwich University, Curtis wrote an extensive memoir of his time in the Southwest. Curtis’s reminiscences detail his encounters with Indians, notable military figures, eccentrics, and other characters from the Old West—including Kit Carson—as well as the construction of Fort Whipple and expeditions against the Navajo and Apache. more... about Ordered West: The Civil War Exploits of Charles A.

Index.\n\nGraham Barnett was killed in Rankin, Texas, on December 6, 1931. His death brought an end to a storied career, but not an end to the legends that claimed he was a gunman, a hired pistolero on both sides of the border, a Texas Ranger known for questionable shootings in Company B under Captain Fox, a deputy sheriff, a bootlegger, and a possible “fixer” for both law enforcement and outlaw organizations. In real life he was a good cowboy, who provided for his family the best way he could, and who did so by slipping seamlessly between the law enforcement community and the world of illegal liquor traffickers. Stories say he killed unnumbered men on the border, but he stood trial only twice and was acquitted both times. more... about Graham Barnett: A Dangerous Man\n\nJohn Ringo, King of the Cowboys: His Life and Times from the Hoo Doo War to Tombstone, Second Edition\n\n— Vol. 6: of A. C. Greene Series\n\nPublished: Pages: 384 Features: 22 b&w illus. 2 maps. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nWestern gunman John Ringo is most well-known for his role in Tombstone for backing the Cowboys against the Earps. In his youth he became embroiled in the blood feud turbulence of post-Reconstruction Texas and the Mason County “Hoo Doo” War, then shot it out with Victorio’s raiders during a deadly confrontation in New Mexico before going to Tombstone in territorial Arizona. There Ringo championed the largely Democratic ranchers against the Earp brothers and Doc Holliday, finally being part of the posse that hounded these fugitives from Arizona. In the end, Ringo died mysteriously in the Arizona desert, his death welcomed by some, mourned by others, wrongly claimed by a few. more... about John Ringo, King of the Cowboys: His Life and Times from the Hoo Doo War to Tombstone, Second Edition\n\nStilwell and Mountbatten in Burma: Allies at War, 1943-1944\n\n— Vol. 3: of American Military Studies\n\nPublished: Pages: 288 Features: 7 b&w illus. 3 maps. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nStilwell and Mountbatten in Burma explores the relationship between American General Joseph “Vinegar Joe” Stilwell and British Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten in the China-Burma-India Theater (CBI) and the South East Asia Command (SEAC) between October 1943 and October 1944, within the wider context of Anglo-American relations during World War II. Using original material from both British and American archives, Jonathan Templin Ritter discusses the military, political, and diplomatic aspects of Anglo-American cooperation, the personalities involved, and where British and American policies both converged and diverged over Southeast Asia. more... about Stilwell and Mountbatten in Burma: Allies at War, 1943-1944\n\nEavesdropping on Texas History\n\nPublished: Pages: 352 Features: 26 b&w illus. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nMary L. Scheer has assembled fifteen contributors to explore special moments in Texas history. The contributors assembled for this anthology represent many of the “all stars” among Texas historians: two State Historians of Texas, two past presidents of TSHA, four current or past presidents of ETHA, two past presidents of WTHA, nine fellows of historical associations, two Fulbright Scholars, and seven award-winning authors. Each is an expert in his or her field and provided in some fashion an answer to the question: At what moment in Texas history would you have liked to have been a “fly on the wall” and why? The choice of a moment and the answers were both personal and individual, ranging from familiar topics to less well-known subjects. more... about Eavesdropping on Texas History\n\nSutherland Springs, Texas: Saratoga on the Cibolo\n\n— Vol. 2: of Texas Local\n\nPublished: Pages: 320 Features: 50 b&w illus. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nIn Sutherland Springs, Texas, Richard B. McCaslin explores the rise and fall of this rural community near San Antonio primarily through the lens of its aspirations to become a resort spa town, because of its mineral water springs, around the turn of the twentieth century. Texas real estate developers, initially more interested in oil, brought Sutherland Springs to its peak as a resort in the early twentieth century, but failed to transform the farming settlement into a resort town. The decline in water tables during the late twentieth century reduced the mineral water flows, and the town faded. Sutherland Springs’s history thus provides great insights into the importance of water in shaping settlement. more... about Sutherland Springs, Texas: Saratoga on the Cibolo\n\nThirty-three Years, Thirty-three Works: Celebrating the Contributions of F. E. Abernethy, Texas Folklore Society Secretary-Editor, 1971-2004\n\n— Vol. 71: of Publications of the Texas Folklore Society\n\nPublished: Pages: 384 Features: 65 b&w illus. Notes. Index.\n\nFrancis Edward “Ab” Abernethy served as the Secretary-Editor of the Texas Folklore Society for over three decades, managing the organization’s daily operations and helping it grow. He edited two dozen volumes of the PTFS series and wrote the three volumes of the Society’s history. This Publication of the Texas Folklore Society celebrates Ab Abernethy’s years of leadership in collecting, preserving, and presenting the folklore of Texas and the Southwest. The prefaces to some of the more memorable edited volumes are included, along with articles he wrote on music, teaching, anecdotes about historical figures and events, and “cultural” examinations of the things we hold dear. In all, these pieces tell us what was important to Ab. In part, these topics are also what was—and still is—important to the Texas Folklore Society. more... about Thirty-three Years, Thirty-three Works: Celebrating the Contributions of F. E.

Bib. Index.\n\nTexan Identities rests on the assumption that Texas has distinctive identities that define “what it means to be Texan,” and that these identities flow from myth and memory. What constitutes a Texas identity and how may such change over time? What myths, memories, and fallacies contribute to making a Texas identity? Are all the myths and memories that define Texas identity true or are some of them fallacious? Is there more than one Texas identity? more... about Texan Identities: Moving beyond Myth, Memory, and Fallacy in Texas History\n\nRounded Up in Glory: Frank Reaugh, Texas Renaissance Man\n\nPublished: Pages: 480 Features: 20 color and 20 b/w illus. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nFrank Reaugh (1860–1945; pronounced “Ray”) was called “the Dean of Texas artists” for good reason. His pastels documented the wide-open spaces of the West as they were vanishing in the late nineteenth century, and his plein air techniques influenced generations of artists. His students include a “Who’s Who” of twentieth-century Texas painters: Alexandre Hogue, Reveau Bassett, and Lucretia Coke, among others. He was an advocate of painting by observation, and encouraged his students to do the same by organizing legendary sketch trips to West Texas. Reaugh also earned the title of Renaissance man by inventing a portable easel that allowed him to paint in high winds, and developing a formula for pastels, which he marketed. A founder of the Dallas Art Society, which became the Dallas Museum of Art, Reaugh was central to Dallas and Oak Cliff artistic circles for many years until infighting and politics drove him out of fashion. He died isolated and poor in 1945. more... about Rounded Up in Glory: Frank Reaugh, Texas Renaissance Man\n\nPublication Award from the Center for the Advancement and Study of Early Texas Art (CASETA), 2017\n\nThe View from the Back of the Band: The Life and Music of Mel Lewis\n\n— Vol. 10: of North Texas Lives of Musicians Series\n\nPublished: Pages: 416 Features: 31 b&w photos. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nMel Lewis (1929-1990) was born Melvin Sokoloff to Jewish Russian immigrants in Buffalo, New York. He first picked up his father’s drumsticks at the age of two and at 17 he was a full-time professional musician. The View from the Back of the Band is the first biography of this legendary jazz drummer. For over fifty years, Lewis provided the blueprint for how a drummer could subtly support any musical situation. While he made his name with Stan Kenton and Thad Jones, and with his band at the Village Vanguard, it was the hundreds of recordings that he made as a sideman and his ability to mentor young musicians that truly defined his career. more... about The View from the Back of the Band: The Life and Music of Mel Lewis\n\nInside John Haynie's Studio\n\nPublished: Pages: 304 Features: 44 photos.

Chilton first described UNT as “independent, original and progressive” in his inaugural speech opening the university in 1890. In the 125 years since then the university has more than lived up to his expectations. The University Archive holds countless photographs, artifacts and publications which tell the remarkable story of the University of North Texas from its beginnings in a downtown hardware store to its place today as the one of the nation’s largest public universities.

Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nBill and Jean Eckart were stage designers and producers at the peak of the musical, and their designs revolutionized Broadway productions. An Eckart set became part of the performance on stage, equal at times to an actor. They were best known for their designs for Damn Yankees (1955); Once Upon a Mattress (1959), in which Carol Burnett made her Broadway debut; and Mame (1966) with Angela Lansbury. Andrew B. Harris uses production stills and the Eckarts’ sketches from every show they worked on to illustrate (with more than 500 color illustrations) the magic behind an Eckart design. more... about The Performing Set: The Broadway Designs of William and Jean Eckart\n\nFinalist, George Freedley Memorial Award, The Theatre Library Association, 2006\n\nGolden Pen Award, United States Institute for Theatre Technology, 2007\n\nWhiskey River Ranger: The Old West Life of Baz Outlaw\n\n— Vol. 16: of Frances B. Vick Series\n\nPublished: Pages: 448 Features: 100 b&w photos. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nCaptain Frank Jones, a famed nineteenth-century Texas Ranger, said of his company’s top sergeant, Baz Outlaw (1854-1894), “A man of unusual courage and coolness and in a close place is worth two or three ordinary men.” Another old-time Texas Ranger declared that Baz Outlaw “was one of the worst and most dangerous” because “he never knew what fear was.” But not all thought so highly of him. In Whiskey River Ranger, Bob Alexander tells for the first time the full story of this troubled Texas Ranger and his losing battle with alcoholism. more... about Whiskey River Ranger: The Old West Life of Baz Outlaw\n\nRiding for the Lone Star: Frontier Cavalry and the Texas Way of War, 1822-1865\n\n— Vol. 2: of American Military Studies\n\nPublished: Pages: 464 Features: 35 b&w photos. 5 maps. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nThe idea of Texas was forged in the crucible of frontier warfare between 1822 and 1865, when Anglo-Americans adapted to mounted combat north of the Rio Grande. This cavalry-centric arena, which had long been the domain of Plains Indians and the Spanish Empire, compelled an adaptive martial tradition that shaped early Lone Star society. Beginning with initial tactical innovation in Spanish Tejas and culminating with massive mobilization for the Civil War, Texas society developed a distinctive way of war defined by armed horsemanship, volunteer militancy, and short-term mobilization as it grappled with both tribal and international opponents. more... about Riding for the Lone Star: Frontier Cavalry and the Texas Way of War, 1822-1865\n\nTraqueros: Mexican Railroad Workers in the United States, 1870-1930\n\n— Vol. 6: of Al Filo: Mexican American Studies Series\n\nPublished: Pages: 256 Features: Map. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nPerhaps no other industrial technology changed the course of Mexican history in the United States—and Mexico—than did the coming of the railroads. Tens of thousands of Mexicans worked for the railroads in the United States, especially in the Southwest and Midwest. Construction crews soon became railroad workers proper, along with maintenance crews later. Extensive Mexican American settlements appeared throughout the lower and upper Midwest as the result of the railroad. The substantial Mexican American populations in these regions today are largely attributable to 19th- and 20th-century railroad work. Only agricultural work surpassed railroad work in terms of employment of Mexicans. more... about Traqueros: Mexican Railroad Workers in the United States, 1870-1930\n\nAgainst the Grain: Colonel Henry M. Lazelle and the U.S. Army\n\n— Vol. 9: of North Texas Military Biography and Memoir Series\n\nPublished: Pages: 432 Features: 36 b&w photos. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nHenry Martyn Lazelle (1832-1917) was the only cadet in the history of the U.S. Military Academy to be suspended and sent back a year (for poor grades and bad behavior) and eventually return as Commandant of the Corps of Cadets. After graduating from West Point in 1855, he scouted with Kit Carson, was wounded by Apaches, and spent nearly a year as a “paroled” prisoner-of-war at the outbreak of the Civil War. Exchanged for a Confederate officer, he took command of a Union cavalry regiment, chasing Mosby’s Rangers throughout northern Virginia. more... about Against the Grain: Colonel Henry M. Lazelle and the U.S. Army\n\nTales of Texas Cooking: Stories and Recipes from the Trans-Pecos to the Piney Woods and High Plains to the Gulf Prairies\n\n— Vol. 70: of Publications of the Texas Folklore Society\n\nPublished: Pages: 352 Features: 60 b&w illus. Notes. Index.\n\nAccording to Renaissance woman and Pepper Lady Jean Andrews, although food is eaten as a response to hunger, it is much more than filling one’s stomach. It also provides emotional fulfillment. This is borne out by the joy many of us feel as a family when we get in the kitchen and cook together and then share in our labors at the dinner table. Food is comfort, yet it is also political and contested because we often are what we eat—meaning what is available and familiar and allowed. more... about Tales of Texas Cooking: Stories and Recipes from the Trans-Pecos to the Piney Woods and High Plains to the Gulf Prairies\n\nA History of Fort Worth in Black & White 165 Years of African-American Life\n\nPublished: Pages: 400 Features: 35 b&w illus. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nA History of Fort Worth in Black & White fills a long-empty niche on the Fort Worth bookshelf: a scholarly history of the city’s black community that starts at the beginning with Ripley Arnold and the early settlers, and comes down to today with our current battles over education, housing, and representation in city affairs. The book’s sidebars on some noted and some not-so-noted African Americans make it appealing as a school text as well as a book for the general reader. more... about A History of Fort Worth in Black & White 165 Years of African-American Life\n\nStorming the City: U.S. Military Performance in Urban Warfare from World War II to Vietnam\n\n— Vol. 1: of American Military Studies\n\nPublished: Pages: 400 Features: 22 b&w photos. 8 maps. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nIn an increasingly urbanized world, urban terrain has become a greater factor in military operations. Simultaneously, advances in military technology have given military forces sharply increased capabilities. The conflict comes from how urban terrain can negate or degrade many of those increased capabilities. What happens when advanced weapons are used in a close-range urban fight with an abundance of cover? more... about Storming the City: U.S. Military Performance in Urban Warfare from World War II to Vietnam\n\nSelected for Marine Commandant's Professional Reading List for all senior enlisted men and all Majors and Lieutenant-Colonels, 2017\n\nHistory/Military Book Club Selection, 2015\n\nThe Royal Air Force in American Skies: The Seven British Flight Schools in the United States during World War II\n\nPublished: Pages: 464 Features: 20 b&w photos. Map. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nBy early 1941, Great Britain stood alone against the aerial might of Nazi Germany and was in need of pilots. The Lend-Lease Act allowed for the training of British pilots in the United States and the formation of British Flying Training Schools. These unique schools were owned by American operators, staffed with American civilian instructors, supervised by British Royal Air Force officers, utilized aircraft supplied by the U.S. Army Air Corps, and used the RAF training syllabus. more... about The Royal Air Force in American Skies: The Seven British Flight Schools in the United States during World War II\n\nFrom Wright Field, Ohio, to Hokkaido, Japan General Curtis E. LeMay's Letters to His Wife Helen, 1941–1945\n\nPublished: Pages: 400 Features: 5 b&w illus. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nIn 1942, Colonel Curtis E. LeMay and his 305th Bomb Group left Syracuse, New York, bound for England, where they joined the Eighth Air Force and Royal Air Force in war against Germany and her allies. Over the next three years LeMay led American air forces in Europe, India, China, and the Pacific against the Axis powers. His efforts yielded advancement through the chain of command to the rank of Major General in command of the XXIst Bomber Command, the most effective strategic bombing force of the war. more... about From Wright Field, Ohio, to Hokkaido, Japan General Curtis E.

Index.\n\nPacific Blitzkrieg closely examines the planning, preparation, and execution of ground operations for five major invasions in the Central Pacific (Guadalcanal, Tarawa, the Marshalls, Saipan, and Okinawa). The commanders on the ground had to integrate the U.S. Army and Marine Corps into a single striking force, something that would have been difficult in peacetime, but in the midst of a great global war, it was a monumental task. Yet, ultimate success in the Pacific rested on this crucial, if somewhat strained, partnership and its accomplishments. Despite the thousands of works covering almost every aspect of World War II in the Pacific, until now no one has examined the detailed mechanics behind this transformation at the corps and division level. more... about Pacific Blitzkrieg: World War II in the Central Pacific\n\nHistory/Military Book Club Selection, 2013\n\nDistinguished Writing Award in Operational/Battle History, from the Army Historical Foundation, 2014\n\nSelected by General Raymond Odierno, 38th Army Chief of Staff, for the U.S. Army Chief of Staff's Professional Reading List, February 2014\n\nCrader Family Book Prize in American Values\n\nCombat Chaplain: A Thirty-Year Vietnam Battle\n\nPublished: Pages: 312 Features: 35 b&w illus. 5 maps.

He chose to accompany them, unarmed, on their daily combat operations, a decision made against the recommendations of his superiors. During what would be the final days for some, he offered his ministry not from a pulpit but on the battlefields—in hot landing zones and rice paddies, in hospitals, aboard ship, and knee-deep in mud. He even found time for baptisms in the muddy Mekong River. more... about Combat Chaplain: A Thirty-Year Vietnam Battle\n\nMaking JFK Matter: Popular Memory and the 35th President\n\nPublished: Pages: 418 Features: 19 b&w photos. Notes. Bib. Index.\n\nIn Making JFK Matter, Paul Santa Cruz examines how popular memory of John F. Kennedy has been used politically by various interest groups, primarily the city of Dallas, Lyndon Johnson, and Robert Kennedy, as well as how the memory of Kennedy has been portrayed in various museums. Santa Cruz argues that we have memorialized JFK not simply out of love for him or admiration for the ideals he embodied, but because invoking his name carries legitimacy and power. Memory can be employed to accomplish particular ends: for example, the passage of long overdue civil rights legislation, or even successfully running for political office. more... about Making JFK Matter: Popular Memory and the 35th President\n\nDeath on Base: The Fort Hood Massacre\n\n— Vol. 9: of North Texas Crime and Criminal Justice Series\n\nPublished: Pages: 384 Features: 28 b&w photos.

Death on Base is an in-depth look at the events surrounding the tragic mass murder that took place on November 5, 2009, and an investigation into the causes and influences that factored into the attack. more... about Death on Base: The Fort Hood Massacre\n\nOther Psalms\n\n— Vol. 22: of Vassar Miller Prize in Poetry\n\nPublished: Pages: 84\n\nIn his debut collection, Jordan Windholz recasts devotional poetics and traces the line between faith and its loss. Other Psalms gives voice to the skeptic who yet sings to the silence that “swells with the noise of listening.” If faith is necessary, this collection suggests, it is necessary as material for its own unmaking. Without a doubt, these are poems worth believing in, announcing, as they do, a new and necessary voice in American poetry. more... about Other Psalms\n\nWinner of the Vassar Miller Prize in Poetry 2014\n\nKatherine Anne Porter's Ship of Fools: New Interpretations and Transa"
