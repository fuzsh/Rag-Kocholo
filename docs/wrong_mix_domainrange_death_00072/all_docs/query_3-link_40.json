        "text": "Music plays a vital role in both the creation and appreciation of art. Simchowitz acknowledges and promotes this fundamental principle through its Music & Audio Residency. This residency invites artists, curators, musicians, and music lovers to create playlists that can be run in parallel with exhibitions, or in response to exhibitions or experiences that have inspired them. Music powers so many creative lives, and Simchowitz wants to provide and curate these selections for you all to enjoy while providing social listening spaces at our galleries in Pasadena and Los Angeles.\n\nSimchowitz will also be exhibiting a collection of high-end audiophile-grade components, carefully curated by audio specialists and highly specialized retailers with decades of experience in managing the complexity of integrating audio grade componentry into perfectly balanced audio chains that present the best possible musical experience in our various spaces. The design, technology, industrial-engineering precision, and love for presenting music in its most magical form that go into the manufacture and design of these products reflect our ethos of artistry and excellence. Renowned brands such as Nagra, Fleetwood, Western Electric, Graham Audio, Vinnie Rossi, Harbeth, Jadis, Devore, Tannoy, Luxman, Lina, and many others have been set up in specifically crafted audio chains to give the best of each system. This experience, we believe, will dramatically enhance and give musical dimensionality to the exhibitions we put on, as well as provide some insight into what music gives artists the inspiration to create.\n\nThe Music & Audio Residency is a unique opportunity for artists and art lovers to explore the relationship between music and art. We will be partnering with select audio brands and select specialized retailers who will curate our systems and assist collectors and clients should they wish to engage in building such audio systems for themselves.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our novel concept of integrating art and music in a natural way that integrates the exhibition of art with the presentation of audiophile quality music.\n\nFor more info call Stefan Simchowitz on +1 (917) 691-8440\n\nor mail simchowitz@gmail.com\n\nD.A.
