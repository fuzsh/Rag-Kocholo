        "text": "Getting booked to sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” at a major event is an honor for any artist. Many will try anything — whether it’s fiddling with the arrangement or striving for the glory notes that only five-octave powerhouses like Whitney Houston could hit — to put their own memorable stamp on the national anthem.\n\nBut not everyone — in fact, almost no one — reaches a level of true greatness. After all, it’s a pretty difficult tune to sing, what with its gymnastic melody that forces vocalists to swing dangerously back and forth between their high and low registers as well as a final line that audiences have come to expect be belted out high and mightily. Factor in the borderline excessive wordiness (Rockets red glare? Bombs bursting? Seriously, couldn’t we have toned down the alliteration a little?) and the fact that screwing it up risks offending an entire nation, and you’ve got yourself a song that is, be it by accident or design, the ultimate make-or-break test for performers everywhere.\n\nNerve-inducing as it is, however, you’d think that singers would have learned by now to stop booking public National Anthem gigs unless they were absolutely positive they had what it takes to do the song justice. Alas, artists of all genders, genres and generations (Okay, maybe alliteration is kind of fun) have stood up in front of the world time and time again and butchered our country’s theme song — including some talented folks that you’d never expect.\n\nWith that in mind, cover your heart and hold your ears as Billboard brings you the 11 worst national anthem performances ever."
