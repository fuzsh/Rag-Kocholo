He was born to parents John Hoffa and Viola Riddle Hoffa and his siblings were Jennetta, William, and Nancy Hoffa, as listed in the 1920 United States Federal Census.\n\nHis birthplace was their home on North Vandalia Street, “an A-frame house of three rooms,” of which Hoffa was born in the bedroom in the middle, according to Hoffa’s memoir, The Trials of Jimmy Hoffa. They later moved to “a slightly more elegant place one block east on Ashley Street,” according to Hoffa’s official biographer, Jim Clay. Their final residence in Brazil was their home at 315 E. Church Street, as noted by the 1921 Brazil City directory and the 1920 United States Federal Census.\n\nJohn Hoffa’s profession of blacksmithing was greatly buoyed by the coal mines in Clay County and the surrounding counties, according to Hoffa biographer, Jim Clay. As he wrote, “he was a mine blacksmith, meaning that he specialized in serving the metal work needs of coal mines. . . . He followed his work by muleback, making the rounds from one mine pit to another in Owen, Clay, and Putnam Counties.”\n\n[2] “John C.

Hoffa recalls in both of his memoirs that his father died after “four months of prolonged illness” and speculated that he might have died of a “massive stroke.”\n\nThis left young Hoffa, his siblings, and his mother Viola with the task of providing for the family. As Hoffa wrote in Trials, “She was never one to mince words. She would now have to be both mother and father to us, she said. She would have to work, she said. And we, she declared, would all have to help.” They moved back to their home on Vandalia street and began to work to make ends meet. As for her jobs during this time, Hoffa recollected in Hoffa: The Real Story, “She knew what hard work was, too, cooking in a restaurant on Main Street and doing housework in the big houses on ‘The Hill.’ My mother also took in washing, Jennetta helping with the ironing while Billy and I did the delivering.” This laundry delivery service was a large part of Hoffa’s assistance to his mother, alongside household chores involving kindling for the kitchen and transporting water for the “big clothes boiler.”\n\nAt the age of nine, the young Hoffa badly injured his right hand when “his brother missed the chicken the two were decapitating and hit his hand with the hatchet,” according to the Richmond Palladium. His hand was scarred for the rest of his life.\n\nRegarding his childhood and its influence on his life in organized labor, Hoffa declared in Trials:\n\nThe raw courage of my mother, exemplified day in and day out while her children were growing to adulthood, has influenced my thinking, and that of my brother and sisters, perhaps more than anything else in life. Viola Riddle Hoffa's life as a mother has been the personification of the class struggle born of the Industrial Revolution. As a member of the labor movement, I am an extension of that struggle.\n\nAs an activist in the labor movement, I have dedicated myself to the creation of jobs for all who wish them and to ensuring the payment of proper compensation so that the worker can live in dignity and self-provided security. And, if there is anything about the background of the boy that influenced the life of the man, it was this.\n\nIn 1924, when Hoffa was eleven years old, the family moved to Detroit, Michigan looking for improved job prospects. Their residence in Detroit is shown in the 1930 Detroit city directory as well as the 1930 United State Federal Census.\n\n[3] “James Hoffa,” 1940 United States Federal Census, Ancestry.com; James Hoffa, Detroit, Michigan, City Directory, 1930, Ancestry.com; “Profile of James Hoffa,” Logansport Pharos-Tribune, October 4, 1957, 1, Newspapers.com; “Hoffa—A Personality Profile,” Traverse City Record-Eagle, August 2, 1975, 5, Newspapers.com; ; James R.

Reflecting in his memoir, The Trials of Jimmy Hoffa, he wrote, “My bosses liked me. I liked them. I enjoyed the work. I felt the same excitement that the department heads felt when merchandise moved well, or when a special display produced good results. I felt that I was part of a large commercial family and that each member shared each other's fortunes.” Then the Great Depression began, causing continued issues with his job at Frank and Cedar’s. He left the job and started working at a Kroger’s grocery store warehouse in 1930. It was in this job that he joined the broader labor movement. “I joined the labor movement at Kroger's,” he wrote in Trials, “I joined it out of a need for self-preservation—laced liberally with some honest anger at injustices so blatant they were obscene. ‘Man's inhumanity to man’ was constant and gleefully adhered to in the lower reaches of the economy found amidst the sweat and smells and curses and blisters of Kroger's produce warehouse.”\n\nHe and his colleagues began agitating for better pay and working conditions, essentially creating their own union within the Kroger warehouse. This came to a head in April of 1931, when 175 workers went on strike, refusing to process a shipment of strawberries. Hoffa encouraged them to join with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union, who would provide protection during strikes. Continued conflicts with management led to him quitting his job at Kroger, but Teamsters Joint Council 43 learned of his organizing skill, bringing him in as an unsalaried organizer. In 1935, at the age 21, he became the business agent of Local 299, reorganizing and revitalizing the branch of the union, especially in its courting of truck drivers. According to biographer Jim Clay, Hoffa took the in-debt branch from a paltry 250 members to 4,000 members with money in the bank. For his efforts, he was appointed President of Local 299 in 1937.\n\n[4] “Steel Walkout in Detroit,” Washington, D.C.

As examples, in the June 4, 1941 issue of the Washington, D.C. Evening Star, Hoffa was brought in to support a steel workers’ strike in Detroit. In 1946, also chronicled by the Evening Star, he supported striking transit workers in Detroit, who wanted a 15-cent increase in pay.\n\nAt the 1952 Teamsters International Convention in Los Angeles, Hoffa was named the ninth vice president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. In his memoir, Hoffa: The Real Story, he referred his selection as vice president as “a nice step forward.”\n\nBy 1953, alongside international vice president, Hoffa juggled numerous roles within the Teamsters, including president of Truck Drivers Local 299, president of Teamsters Joint Council 43, president of the Teamsters Michigan Conference, president of the National Truckaway and Driveaway Conference, and vice president and negotiating chairman of the Central States Drivers Council, according to the Detroit Free Press.\n\nOn October 4, 1957, James R. Hoffa was elected General President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, with a vote margin of “almost a 3-to-1 margin over his two rivals,” according to the Greencastle Daily Banner. Reflecting years later in his memoir, The Trials of Jimmy Hoffa, the labor leader wrote, “I became General President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the largest independent union in the world, representing a group of people to whom I gladly dedicated my life, my total devotion, my maximum effort and strength.”\n\nAs the Caldwell Journal noted, his election was highly controversial, so much so that a federal judge issued a restraining order on October 14, 1957 barring Hoffa from formally assuming the office. They alleged that delegates to the convention had been seated illegally, thereby tainting Hoffa’s election. This led to a protracted legal battle that ended on January 24, 1958, when the courts settled with the Teamsters and Hoffa formally took over as President. He was reelected in 1961 and 1966.\n\n[5] “Auto Workers, Teamsters are Biggest Unions,” St. Louis Globe-Democrat, April 15, 1957, 28, Newspapers.com; “Profile of James Hoffa,” Logansport Pharos Tribune, October 4, 1957, 1, Newspapers.com; “Whoop’er Up for Jimmy,” Greencastle Daily Banner, October 5, 1957, 1, Hoosier State Chronicles; “Watch on the Potomac,” Petal Paper, January 2, 1958, 3, Chronicling America; “Believes Priest’s Attack on Meany, Ill-Advised,” Catholic Times, December 5, 1958, 4, Chronicling America; “McClellan Claims Hoffa Juggles Membership Total,” South Bend Tribune, May 31, 1959, 12, Newspapers.com; “Finds Teamster Pay Tops Associate Profs’,” Detroit Tribune, March 12, 1960, 2, Chronicling America; “Teamsters Re-Elect Hoffa as President,” Richmond Palladium-Item July 8, 1961, 1, Newspapers.com;“Expelled by Federation, Teamsters in Kentucky Outgain Other Unions,” Louisville Courier-Journal, November 25, 1962, 81, Newspapers.com; “Teamsters President James R.

During that time, the membership did increase, but its exact figures were disputed during his tenure. In April 1957, a few months before he became president, the membership was reported by the St. Louis Globe-Democrat as somewhere between 1,400,000 and 1,500,000, making it one of the two largest unions in the United States (the other was the United Auto Workers). The Logansport Pharos-Tribune noted 1,400,000 upon Hoffa’s election as general president while the Greencastle Daily Banner noted 1,500,000.\n\nDuring the 1959 hearings of the Senate Rackets Committee, Senator John L. McClellan, Chairman, accused Hoffa and the Teamsters of “juggling figures to make it appear his union’s membership has been growing,” the South Bend Tribune noted. Using figures based on received union dues, McClellan put the membership at 1,295,740 at the end of 1957 and 1,277,000 at the end of 1958. Hoffa dismissed these numbers.\n\nHowever, an article in the Helena Montana-based People’s Voice noted a membership of 1,633,000 in 1960. In 1961, in a Richmond Palladium-Item article about his reelection as general president, membership stood at 1,700,000. This number stayed the same by Hoffa’s reelection as general president in 1966, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\nAccording to Hoffa’s memoir, membership in 1970 was around 1,900,000 and a Marion Star article from July 6, 1971 placed the membership at 2,000,000. It is accurate to say that, during Hoffa’s tenure as General President of the Teamsters, the member went from approximately 1,400,000 to 2,000,000, as indicated by newspaper articles and his two memoirs.\n\nDespite the controversies, Hoffa did receive some accolades for his leadership on behalf of workers. An editorial by Robert G. Spivack in the Petal, Mississippi-based Petal Paper praised his time in the Teamsters, declaring “he’s done more for the American labor movement than he realizes, and that’s no kidding.” In a column for the Catholic Times, a priest who supported Hoffa was quoted as saying:\n\nfor the past 12 years you have read and you have heard a many things about a Jimmy Hoffa. Let them say what they want about him, but no one can say he is not imbued with (the) spirit of unionism . . . I [wish] there were more of his qualities in the labor movement, for such alertness would stay us well in the cold battle being waged against organized labor.\n\nWorkers also experienced better pay and benefits, as noted by newspapers and Hoffa’s autobiographies. Average Teamster members often earned more than college professors, at $7,200-$7,800 a year as opposed to $7,332, a 1960 article in Detroit Tribune noted. Hoffa echoed this his memoir, The Trials of Jimmy Hoffa: “Teamsters' wages continued to grow, too. We had some catching up to do, and wage increases for Teamsters exceeded the rate for all other industries.” In his second memoir, Hoffa: The Real Story, he elaborated on the benefits to Teamster members:\n\nIf you want to know how far the Teamsters have brought the nation's truck drivers, consider that in those days the highest-paid drivers were receiving $19 for a seven-day week, sunup to sundown. With our first contract we got them $.48 an hour for a sixty-hour work week, which is $28, but that was only the beginning. As of now they get $7.83 an hour, which is $469.80 for a sixty-hour week. Why sixty hours? Because overall they want to work that many hours. As one guy explained it:\n\n\"What the hell do you want me to have to do, sit around the house all the time with the old lady?\"\n\nBut their benefits don't end there. Under Social Security they get $338 a month at age sixty-two. Under the Teamster pension fund they get $500 a month starting at age fifty-seven.\n\nA 1963 article in the Pascagoula Chronicle noted that Hoffa was “weigh[ing] tax angels carefully before presenting wage demands to trucking firms this fall because union drivers are moving into higher tax brackets.”\n\nIn 1964, Hoffa played a central role negotiating the National Master Freight Agreement, which covered 400,000 Teamster members employed over 1,400 companies. The agreement provided a 36.5 to 45 cent-an-hour wage and benefit increase for the three years of the contract. The Oakland Tribune noted that “American truckers feel they struck a good bargain with Jimmy Hoffa’s Teamsters Union in the recently negotiated national master freight agreement.” Despite its largely positive reception, some locals within the Teamsters did revolt against it, citing Hoffa’s overhanded tactics against them, as articles in the Indianapolis News, Tipton Daily Tribune, and the Minneapolis Star indicated.\n\nAs his memoir and newspaper articles note, Hoffa resigned as general president on June 22, 1971, with Frank Fitzsimmons becoming interim president. Two days later, he resigned as president of Local 299 in Detroit. Hoffa would never hold another leadership position within the Teamsters.\n\n[6] “Hoffa to Spy on Congress,” Carlsbad Current-Argus, April 10, 1960, 1, 3, Newspapers.com; “Capital Circus,” New York Daily News, September 8, 1960, 4C, Newspapers.com; “Congressional Bloc is Teamsters’ Objective,” Sheboygan Press, April 14, 1960, 5, Newspapers.com; “Union Opposition Said Not Decisive in Congress Contests,” Waterloo Courier, January 5, 1961, 4, Newspapers.com; “Teamster DRIVE Starts Slow Here,” Nashville Tennessean, August 6, 1961, 10, Newspapers.com; “Teamsters Plan Political Action in Carolinas,” Danville Bee, August 9, 1961, 31, Newspapers.com; “Hoffa’s Blonde Bombshell: His Wife Jo,” Binghamton Press and Sun-Bulletin, February 26, 1962, 11, Newspapers.com; “Hoffa Tells Women: ‘You Can Control Vote’,” Racine Journal Times, April 4, 1962, 4, Newspapers.com; “A West Texan in Washington,” El Paso Times, August 24, 1963, 4, Newspapers.com; “Washington Bound,” Terre Haute Tribune, September 25, 1963, 8, Newspapers.com; “Teamsters Stress Political Buildup,” Indianapolis News, October 23, 1963, 7, Newspapers.com; “Hoffas Will Be Honored by Teamsters, Sept. 29,” Helena People’s Voice, September 13, 1963, 1, Chronicling America; James R.

It was described in the Carlsbad Current-Argus as “a neighborhood project—a major force from the rank-and-file up, not from the top down.” It’s first director was Teamster’s political action chief, Sidney Zagri. The Teamsters developed a voter outreach strategy that focused on congressional races, reported Victor Riesel in the Sheboygan Press. In the 1960 election, the Waterloo Courier wrote, DRIVE supported 233 congressional candidates, of which 137 were elected.\n\nJo Hoffa, the wife of James R. Hoffa, became DRIVE’s director in 1962, and “Jo Hoffa banquets” were routinely held at Teamster locals to raise funds for the political organization. As a Racine Journal Times article from April 4, 1962 noted, Jo Hoffa “urged the [5,000] women” in attendance at one of these dinners “to join your husband and fight back through DRIVE.” Female members of DRIVE would lobby their federal and local legislators. For example, the El Paso Times reported in 1963 that 170 wives of Texas Teamsters “put Texas congressmen through an inquisition on current governmental issues.” That same year, a group of five women associated with Teamsters Local 144 in Terre Haute, Indiana lobbied their federal representatives under the DRIVE banner, according to the Terre Haute Tribune.\n\nThe Teamster’s website claims that “more than 15,000 women [came] to Washington, D.C. between 1962 and 1968 to lobby for labor-related issues through the DRIVE groups.” Newspaper accounts, Hoffa’s Memoirs, and Clay’s biography do not confirm this claim. However, thousands did involve themselves with DRIVE over the years, as the sources above indicate, but it was not only women. An October 23, 1963 article in the Indianapolis News quotes Teamster associate Sidney Zagri as claiming “23,000 [members] were added in the past month.” Contradicting the claim is an article in the Saint Louis Post-Dispatch from December 30, 1963, which noted, “despite hundreds of thousands of dollars poured into this effort [DRIVE], sources close to the Teamsters operation estimate only a few thousand of the union’s 1,500,000 members are enrolled as active participants.”\n\n[7] James R.

Hoffa’s interactions with and involvement in civil rights are complicated. In his 1957 trial for bribery, Hoffa was defended by former boxer Joe Louis, himself an African American, who testified on his behalf. “I have known Hoffa for 10 or 12 years, and in my opinion he’s a good guy,” Louis told to reporters in the Jackson Advocate. The backlash against Louis, including accusations of a payoff from Hoffa, dogged both them for years, especially the latter in the Senate Rackets Committee’s investigations. In 1961, Hoffa offered a job to Jesse Owens, famed African American Olympic runner, after his firing by the Illinois Youth Commission in 1961 for supporting a Hoffa-backed labor leader, as reported in the Indianapolis Recorder.\n\nWithin the Teamsters as an organization, Hoffa supported a non-discrimination policy as general president and outlined this policy in an April 16, 1958 letter to the membership. “As Americans, we should be opposed to bigotry and racial discrimination at every turn, and do everything in possible to make the Bill of Rights a reality for every citizen,” he wrote. This policy meant a strict non-discriminatory hiring policy at all locals within the Teamsters. However, a 1959 article in the Indianapolis Recorder noted that the Senate Rackets Committee, then investigating Hoffa, alleged that he discriminated against African Americans at his Local 299 in Detroit. It is unclear whether this claim was substantiated. That same year, the Teamsters hired Augustus G. Parker as the first African American legal counsel for the union. In the Indianapolis Recorder article announcing his hire, it was noted that “a National Bar Association resolution recently praised the union for its nondiscriminatory activities, especially in the South.” Reflecting on this later in his memoirs, Hoffa wrote: “Many inequities continued to exist in trucking circles in various parts of the nation, and I had come to realize that only a strong, solid, large union could end them. I was arguing against racism long before the federal politicians were aware of it as an issue.”\n\nDespite the nondiscrimination policy within the Teamsters and his own declarations against racism, Hoffa did not support the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, organized by such prominent African American leaders as A. Philip Randolph of the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) and civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Ironically, he did call for a march on Washington in 1963, but for organized labor and without any overt references to civil rights for African Americans, the Knoxville News-Sentinel reported. In an August 22, 1963 interview published by the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Hoffa called pending federal civil rights legislation “a farce and a fake” and called the March on Washington “a futile gesture.” He went on: “I do not believe that picketing will solve the problem. The march is no answer to the question of jobs.” A week later, in an almost contradictory statement, the Vineland Daily Journal quoted Hoffa saying, “Only by pressure our Congress moves . . . .These people couldn’t get anything any other way so they came to Washington to show pressure.”\n\nBy 1965, Hoffa became more public about his support for civil rights, particularly the work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. At the March 31, 1965 funeral of slain civil rights activist Viola Liuzzo, Hoffa presented King with a $25,000 check to support his civil rights advocacy, as reported by the Odessa American. Hoffa’s support of King caused a backlash within some of the rank-and-file members of the Teamsters. An article in the Pittsburg Press noted that Local 612 distributed petitions for Hoffa to ask for the check back.\n\nThe newspaper, autobiographical, and biographical sources indicate that Hoffa did support Dr. King and efforts to end discrimination within the Teamsters but wasn’t a leading voice during the civil rights movement.\n\n[8] “Nothing Criminal,” Washington, D.C.

Hoffa’s interactions with the legal system stared during the 1930s, when we a young labor organizer in Detroit. An article in the Detroit Free Press from March 14, 1957 noted that Hoffa had been arrested 17 times and convicted three times, for crossing picket lines, violating anti-trust laws, and for extortion. The extortion case from 1946, wherein Hoffa allegedly “threatened damage to the property of an independent merchant,” dragged on for over a year before he was acquitted of all charges on June 26, 1947, according to the Wilmington Morning Star and the Indianapolis Times.\n\nIn 1957, Hoffa was indicted on charges of bribery. The Senate Rackets Committee, led by Senator John McClellan and Counsel Robert F. Kennedy, accused Hoffa of “bribing a rackets committee investigator to slip him secret committee documents,” the Greencastle Banner noted. Kennedy had begun investigating the labor leader a year before, which led to tense interaction between them that Hoffa recalls in his memoir, Hoffa: The Real Story. Kennedy had come into his office, unannounced, looking for documents, setting off Hoffa’s temper. As Hoffa wrote, “that incident turned out to be the start of what was to become a blood feud. Maybe it didn't seem like much at the time, but I had stepped on a poison snake.”\n\nHoffa faced long and penetrating investigations by the Rackets Committee. A Detroit Free Press article from August 25, 1957 reported that McClellan the committee laid out a 48-point indictment on the Teamster Vice President, accusing him of conflicts of interest, misappropriation of Teamster funds, improper loans, and questionable relationships. In regards to specific relationships, the Committee grilled Hoffa for his involvement with an ex-convict and alleged labor racketeer named Johnny Dio, who was pursuing control of a New York City taxicab union. Also in the fall of 1957, Hoffa was indicted on five counts of perjury by a federal rackets grand jury, for supposedly “lying during an investigation of wiretapping,” according to the Greencastle Daily Banner. The case was dismissed in May of 1958, with a unanimous acquittal by the jury.\n\nHoffa and the Teamster’s also faced opposition within the organized labor movement. On October 31, 1957, less than a month after Hoffa was elected General President of the Teamsters, the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) announced their intention to expel them from the umbrella union for failing to remove Hoffa and “other union officials accused of corruption.” The separation of the Teamsters and the AFL-CIO was finalized on December 6, 1957. In his memoir, Hoffa blamed Robert F. Kennedy and the Senate Rackets Committee for the AFL-CIO’s souring on him and the Teamsters. He wrote:\n\nThen on December 6 the Teamsters were expelled from membership in the AFL-CIO because they elected me president. It really made me red-assed. Because I found out that Kennedy had whispered in a lot of the ears at the top. They sure as hell were scared they would be investigated if they crossed Kennedy. The thing that really bothered me as a lifelong union man was that it caused a split in labors unified ranks. It was back alley politics by the Kennedys. They kept most of labor on their side of the political fence for the presidential drive ahead and the Teamsters still were the patsy that would satisfy those Southern antilabor conservatives.\n\nWhile Hoffa would attempt in later years to rehabilitate the Teamster’s relationship with the AFL-CIO, it was never successful.\n\nIn 1962, a mistrial was called by federal judge William Miller in another case involving Hoffa and alleged corruption. Investigators charged Hoffa “with conspiracy to receive payoff to ensure labor peace for a nationwide automobile transport firm,” as indicated by the Pascagoula Chronicle.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy around this time had been appointed Attorney General, serving for his brother, President John F. Kennedy. Under Kennedy, the Department of Justice escalated its formal investigations on Hoffa, what the Teamster would call the “Get Hoffa Squad.” This led to numerous indictments, including a May 1962 charge of Hoffa and seven other people “fraudulently obtaining $20 million in loans from a Teamsters’ pension fund and using more than $1 million of it for their own benefit.” This action was Kennedy’s seventh legal action against Hoffa since their interactions in the Senate Rackets Committee in the late 1950s. The 55-page indictment included 28 counts of mail and wire fraud, the Pascagoula Chronicle reported. Hoffa always let his feeling about Kennedy public, as an article from the Greencastle Daily Banner illustrated. In the piece, Hoffa said, “Bobby tried to run roughshod over and I stood to up him. He is nothing but a spoiled young brat, never having had to work for a living.”\n\nHowever, the case that ultimately put Hoffa in prison was a jury tampering case in Nashville, Tennessee. The Greencastle Daily Banner reported on June 10, 1963 that Hoffa and ten others were charged with bribing jurors during the previously mentioned 1962 fraud case. The trial lasted for nearly five weeks, with the government resting their case on February 14, 1964. On March 4, 1964, James R. Hoffa was found guilty on “two counts of jury tampering—crimes punishable by a total of 10 years in prison and $10,000 fine.” The Indianapolis Star reported Hoffa’s reaction to the case: “Hoffa called the verdict ‘a railroad job in my opinion’ and said he pitied ‘those who do not have the funds to go to appeals courts.’” He was sentenced to eight years and a $10,000 fine.\n\nHoffa appealed his case, which dragged out for another two years. The U.S. Supreme Court, on December 12, 1966, upheld Hoffa’s 1964 conviction. Hoffa began serving his prison term at the federal penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania on March 7, 1967, as noted by the Muncie Evening Press. Upon heading to prison, Hoffa said, “I hope and trust that all those who are part of that conspiracy realize the fact that it isn’t Hoffa. It’s purely a question of an American citizen. If the government can do this to Hoffa, it can do it to any American citizen.” He served a little over four years in prison before his sentence was commuted by President Richard Nixon; he was released on December 23, 1971. One of the stipulations of his release was that he could not involve himself in any union activity until March 6, 1980, the South Bend Tribune reported.\n\n[9] “High Crime Figure Faces Questioning About Disappearance of James Hoffa,” Richmond Palladium-Item, August 1, 1975, 2, Newspapers.com; “Ex-Teamsters Chief Hoffa Disappears,” Sacramento Bee, August 1, 1975, 1, Newspapers.com; “Disappearance Latest Development in Teamster Battle,” Traverse City Record-Eagle, August 2, 1975, 5, Newspapers.com; “FBI Takes Over Now in James Hoffa Case,” Waxahachie Daily Light, August 4, 1975, 1, Newspapers.com; “Hoffa’s Children Think O’Brien Knows Something About Incident,” Jasper Herald, August 7, 1975, 22, Newspapers.com; “James P.

Hoffa’s disappearance on July 30, 1975 was covered extensively in newspapers and in the last chapter of his memoir, Hoffa: The Real Story, written by co-author Oscar Fraley.\n\nHoffa was last seen by witnesses around 1:30 pm in front of the Bloomfield Township restaurant, according to the Sacramento Bee. Hoffa told his wife, Jo, that morning he was expecting to visit with “Tony Jack and a couple of other guys.” As Fraley noted in Hoffa: The Real Story:\n\n“Tony Jack,\" also known as \"Tony J.\" and \"T. J.,\" is Anthony Giacalone, reputed Detroit Mafia leader who was under indictment on income-tax-evasion and mail-fraud charges. Hoffa had been called before a grand jury to testify in the Giacalone case and—something he never did in his own defense—he had taken the Fifth to keep from discussing someone else's activities.\n\nBy 4pm, Hoffa’s family and other colleagues suspected something was awry and began to ask around for help. The next day, at 6pm, he was declared missing. As Fraley wrote, “Jimmy Hoffa became a number again: Missing Person Number 75-3425.” Hoffa’s car was discovered abandoned in a Bloomfield Hills shopping center near the restaurant he was last seen by.\n\nThe FBI took over the case on August 4, 1975, according to the Waxahachie Daily Light, when “extortion demands received during the weekend turned it into a federal case.” Additionally, the Daily Light reported that threats were also made to Hoffa’s family and associates. “One FBI source said two notes had been received, one by the family and one by a Hoffa associate saying: ‘You saw what happened to him. You’re Next.’” By the fall of 1975, James P. Hoffa believed that his father was dead. “I don’t think we’ll ever see him again. I think he was assassinated,” he said to reporters in an article published by the Jasper Herald.\n\nOn December 8, 1982, over seven years after his disappearance, James Riddle Hoffa was declared legally dead. Despite being declared legally dead, the FBI continued its investigation. The Indianapolis Star reported that “the FBI said it still expects to solve the mystery of the former Teamster’s boss’ disappearance.”"
