Mott, clerk and recorder of the circuit court of New Madrid County, was born in Nicholasville, Jessamine Co., Ky., on September 5, 1826. He is a son of James Mott, a native of Virginia, who went to Jessamine County, Ky., when a young man, in 1815. There he married Hettie Withers, a native of the county. He was a farmer and merchant, and in 1828 removed to Hickman, Ky., and remained there engaged in the mercantile business until his death in 1847. John A. grew to manhood in Hickman and spent his youth in school and in his father's store. In 1850 he went to California, via New Orleans, Panama and Aspinwall; and, after spending two years in the mines, returned home by the same route. He came to New Madrid in October, 1852, and remained one year, when he went to Illinois and was appointed route agent for the American Express Company, with headquarters at Chicago.\n\nHe resigned the position in 1856, and came back to New Madrid, and was married in November of that year to H. J. Waggener, a native of the county, and a daughter of Robert G. and Zelia Waggener, who were among the early settlers of the county from Virginia. After his marriage Mr. Mott resided one year in New York City in the mercantile business, and in 1857 returned to Chicago in the employ of the American Express Company; but, after one year longer, came back to New Madrid. He engaged in farming until he was appointed by Gov. Gamble clerk and recorder of the circuit court. He was next appointed by Gov. Fletcher, and was elected at the first general election, and has been re-elected at each consecutive election with a nice majority each time but one, when he had but sixteen more than his opponent. He has held the office twenty-five consecutive years in a manner most satisfactory to all. He has also held several offices in the city. In 1875 he was licensed as an attorney at law, but has never practiced. To him and wife have been born six children: Clara, Laura, Louis W., May, Richard J. and Robert. Mr. Mott is a member of the Masonic order.\n\nLee C. Phillips\n\nPage 906 and 907\n\nLee C. Phillips was born in Jefferson County, near Louisville, Ky., on December 29, 1859, and is a son of Capt. Thomas Phillips, who was born and reared in Kentucky. The latter came to Missouri when a young man about 1855, and was married in New Madrid County to Ann H. Maulsby, a native of the county. Thomas J. Phillips enlisted in the Confederate army, and was made captain of his company, with which he served until 1864. Upon his return from the war, he removed to Kentucky and located in Jefferson County. He engaged in agricultural pursuits, but after two years returned to New Madrid County, Mo., and in February, 1866, located on the farm on which his family now resides. He remained here engaged in farming until his death, on June 17, 1872.\n\nAfter returning to New Madrid County he was county surveyor for a number of years, and was serving in this capacity at the time of his death. He left a family of four children - two sons and two daughters - three of whom are living: Lee C., Dr. Murray W. (a dentist in New Madrid) and Mamie. Lee C. was reared on his father's farm, and received an ordinary education in the common schools. Since reaching manhood he has managed the home farm, containing 280 acres, which is somewhat below the average fertility of land in New Madrid County. Two hundred and sixty acres are in cultivation. He owns one-fourth share of the farm, which is moderately improved. On January 5, 1887, he was united in marriage to Miss Neelie Waters, a daughter of Louis A. Waters, Sr., and Vaginia Waters (both deceased). Mr. Phillips is a member of the A. O. U. W. His wife is a devoted member of the Catholic Church. Her mother was also a devout member of the same church. Mr. and Mrs. Phillips are the parents of one son, Edwin.\n\nMurray Phillips\n\nPage 906\n\nMurray Phillips, a prominent citizen of Southeast Missouri, residing near New Madrid, was born near that city on January 19, 1847, and is a son of Shapley R. and Sallie (Graves) Phillips. Shapley R. Phillips was born at Louisville, Ky., on September 22, 1802, and when a young man came to New Madrid County, Mo., where he afterward resided. At the time of his location in the county, he possessed scanty means, but by energy and superior business ability he became one of the most wealthy and substantial men of Southeast Missouri. He seemed to be successful in all his undertakings, owning at one time 300 slaves, and between 7,000 to 10,000 acres of land. His attention was given entirely to farming, which he prosecuted on an extensive scale. He died on Lewis' Prairie on January 29, 1863.\n\nHis wife was born in East Tennessee, and died when the subject of this sketch was a young boy. There were eight children, of whom Murray is the youngest and only survivor. He received a fine education, first attending Christian Brothers' College of St. Louis, and later Washington University of Virginia, which was then under the management of Gen. Robert E. Lee. He graduated from the latter college in French and mathematics. After his father's death he lived with his elder brother, Amos R., a prominent citizen of New Madrid County, who was a representative at the time of his death in 1873. Amos R. was never married. Sallie D., a sister, was the wife of Leroy Kline. She died in 1865, leaving one son, Amos R., who has since had his name changed to Amos R. Phillips. In 1869 Murray Phillips took charge of his father's estate, in connection with which he now has charge of his brother, Amos R., and Leroy Kline's estates. The Phillips estate comprises 15,000 acres of some of the best land in Southeast Missouri. On August 10, 1876, Mr. Phillips was united in marriage with Anna M. Howard, a daughter of J. H. Howard, of New Madrid. Their union has been blessed by the birth of one son, Murray.\n\nPhilip Raidt\n\npage 908\n\nJudge Philip Raidt was born in Beal, on the Necker, in Wurtemberg, Germany, April 4, 1825, and is a son of Remegious and Antonia (Hanely) Raidt, who were also born in Germany, where they were reared and married. They immigrated to America in February, 1833 (the father resigning his office of burgomaster of Beal), and landed in New Orleans some time in May of that year. Then the father embarked for St. Louis on the steamer \"Mohegan,\" but on account of the severity of the cholera was forced to abandon the boat, owing to slow speed and time occupied in burying people. Mr. Raidt, Sr., stopped, as he thought, temporarily at New Madrid, but it proved to be a permanent step. Two of his daughters died on the boat and were buried between New Orleans and New Madrid, and one died soon after landing.\n\nAfter living in town until the next spring he purchased some land and moved on a farm, where he died in a short time. This farm was about two and half miles from New Madrid at that time but is now about one and a half miles distant, by reason of the wash and caving-in of the banks of the Mississippi River. Philip Raidt grew to manhood on the farm, and was married in 1848 to Rosie Thomas, a native of Germany, who came to America in the same vessel with the Raidt family. After his marriage the Judge remained on the farm until 1866, when he removed to New Madrid to give his children the advantages of the school of that city. He has three children: Barbara (wife of Louis Newbeaur, whose sketch appears in the work), Elizabeth (a young lady at home) and Philip A. (who now has charge of his father's farm). Since removing to New Madrid Mr. Raidt has served as school director two or three terms, and helped to organize the first free school in this county. He has also served as alderman on the city board for a few terms. In April, 1884, he was elected mayor of the city of New Madrid without any solicitation on his part, but did not serve, as his services were otherwise required in attending to duties about his farm. In the fall of 1884 he became a candidate for judge of the county court, from the first district of New Madrid County, and was elected in November, 1884, and was re-elected in November, 1886, which office he now holds.\n\nAmos Riley\n\nPage 908 and 909\n\nJudge Amos Riley, one of the prominent citizens of New Madrid County, Mo., was born in Jefferson County, Ky., on June 10, 1810. He is a son of Amos Riley, Sr., a native of Montgomery County, Md. The latter when a young man left his native State and went to Jefferson County, Ky., where he married Susan Philips, a native of Virginia. Some years after their marriage they removed to Daviess County, Ky., where they spent the remainder of their lives. Amos Riley, Jr., grew to manhood in Daviess County, Ky., and was married in Louisville on December 23, 1833, to Lucy Ann Hamilton, a daughter of Charles Hamilton, of Claiborne County, Miss., in which county Mrs. Riley was born. After his marriage Mr. Riley located in Kentucky, but in 1837 came to Southeast Missouri and purchased 300 acres of land, where he now resides. He brought his family to this farm in 1844. Since then he has purchased more land (all timbered), which he has improved, and after giving liberally to his children, still has about 600 acres. He has served as judge of the county court, and is one of the substantial men of the county. He and wife have reared a family of six sons and two daughters, viz.: Charles H., Amos C. (who was killed in the Confederate army at Atlanta, Ga.), William, Ellen (wife of Amos R. Hathaway), Henry C., E. T. Chilion (now in New Mexico), Lucy (wife of J. D. Harrel, of Jackson, Mo.) and D. B. (who is now managing the home farm). Judge Riley is a consistent member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and his wife of the Presbyterian Church.\n\nWilliam Riley\n\nPage 909\n\nWilliam Riley was born in Jefferson County, Ky., December 20, 1840, and when four years of age, came to Missouri with his father, Amos Riley, who settled in New Madrid County [see sketch of latter]. William grew up on his father's farm, and secured a good education at the Military Institute, near Frankfort, Ky., and the State University at Columbia, Mo. He enlisted in the Confederate army in 1861 at the beginning of the war, joining the First Missouri Infantry as a private, but was soon after promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. He served on year in that regiment and re-enlisted in 1862 in the Eighth Missouri Cavalry, with which he served until the close of the war. He enlisted the second time as a private and was again promoted to first lieutenant.\n\nHe participated in all the engagements of his regiment, not being away from his command more than a month from the beginning to the end of the war. The most prominent battles were Shiloh, Helena, and Pilot Knob. When peace was restored he returned home, and has since been engaged in farming. He was married in October, 1867, to Orra Toney, a native of New Madrid County, and a daughter of Pinkney Toney, deceased. He located on the farm where he now resides, three and one-half miles north of New Madrid, in 1871. The farm consists of 210 acres of fine land, nearly all fenced and under cultivation. To him and wife have been born eight children: Lydia C., Amos C., Nannie D., Charles V., Mabel O., William, Chilion and John M. Mr. Riley is a member of the A. O. U. W. lodge at New Madrid.\n\nHenry C. Riley\n\nPage 909\n\nHenry C. Riley, prosecuting attorney of New Madrid County, Mo., is a native of the county, born December 18, 1850, and is a son of Judge Amos Riley [see sketch]. Henry C. Riley spent his youth on his father's farm and at school. He received his literary education in a five years' course at the Kentucky Military Institute, near Frankfort, Ky., graduating from the institution in June, 1871. He then entered the St. Louis Law School, from which he received a diploma in 1873.\n\nAfter finishing his professional education he commenced practicing at New Madrid, and has become one of the leading lawyers of the county. He served as county school commissioner for a few years. In 1884 he was elected prosecuting attorney for the county, and was re-elected in 1886. He was united in marriage in May, 1877, with Miss Jennie Howard, a native of the county, and a daughter of Judge J. H. Howard [see sketch]. She was reared in New Madrid County and educated at St. Vincent Female Seminary at Cape Girardeau. Mr. and Mrs. Riley's union has been blessed by the birth of three, viz.: Edwin H., Harry C. and Dixie. Mr. Riley is a member of the Masonic order, and also of the A. O. U. W. Mrs. Riley is a devoted member of the Catholic Church.\n\nMadison Jackson Tickell\n\nPage 912 and 913\n\nMadison Jackson Tickell, a prominent citizen of New Madrid County, was born in White County, Tenn., on July 16, 1826. He is the sixth of eleven children born to William and Lavinia (Stallcup) Tickell, natives of Rockingham County, N. C., and of Scotch-Irish and German lineage, respectively. Probably soon after their marriage, they removed to White County, Tenn., and in 1836 to Obion County, that State, where they remained several years, and went to Hickman County and resided till their deaths. William Tickell was a successful farmer, but lost much money by going security for his friends. He had no political aspirations, and he and wife were for many years zealous members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, always taking an active part in church affairs.\n\nOf their eleven children, nine lived to be grown and four are living at this writing: Madison Jackson, Elizabeth C. (the widow of Daniel Mozier, deceased), Sallie Louisa (who is married and resides in Arkansas), Martha Caroline (widow of Mr. Pierce, deceased). Madison J. received a limited education in Tennessee, as opportunity for schooling was meager at the time. Since coming to New Madrid County, Mo., he has attended school three months, and by much reading and close observation has gained a good practical education. At the age of sixteen years, he began driving a team for his father from Hickman, Ky., into the interior of the State about 100 miles, hauling goods from the Mississippi River, and in return bringing cotton and tobacco. He continued this for three years, and a few months before he was twenty-one years of age left home, paying his father $20 for his liberty. He took a trip on the Mississippi River to New Orleans, and across Lake Pontchartrain to Mobile, Ala. In May, 1847, he returned to New Madrid, and began learning the carpenter's trade, at which he afterward worked for fifteen years, and continued twenty-five years more in connection with house-moving. Being very successful at his trade he then began dealing in stock, the most of which he shipped to New Orleans, and the rest to St. Louis.\n\nHe is still engaged in this business, and has been farming extensively for many years, owning at present 3,000 acres of fine land. Immediately after the war he cultivated 100 acres on the site of the present town of New Madrid, for which land he paid $6 per acre rent. In 1847 he married Mrs. Anise (Audibert) Roy, a native of France, who came with her parents to the United States when small, and first located near New Albany, Ind., but later came to New Madrid County, Mo. To Mr. and Mrs. Tickell have been born four children, three living: Mary Eliza (wife of Henry Clay Hunter), Louis Alfred (who is engaged very successfully at house-moving), William Adolph (who is merchandising at LaForge). The other one, Laura, died when three years of age. Mrs. Tickell is a member of the Catholic Church. Mr. Tickell is a very active, public-spirited citizen, and at all times supports the cause of education, and he and family are highly respected by all who know them.\n\nEdward A. Wright\n\nPage 914\n\nEdward A. Wright, editor and publisher of the Weekly Record, of New Madrid, Mo., was born in St. Louis, on December 2, 1856. His father, Erie Wright, was a native of Massachusetts, and was an architect, contractor and builder in St. Louis, for a number of years. He was married in that city to Louisa Cruchon, a native of France, who was reared and educated in St. Louis. Erie Wright continued his business in St. Louis till his death at Camp Jackson during the war. After the death of her husband Mrs. Wright removed to Jackson, Cape Girardeau County, where she has since resided. Edward A. Wright grew to manhood at Jackson and Cape Girardeau. When a lad of sixteen years he commenced learning the printer's trade in the office of the Cash Book, at Jackson. He continued there until he became a practical printer, and afterward worked at his trade in other offices of that county until he became a skillful job printer.\n\nIn 1881 he came to New Madrid and took charge of the Weekly Record, as editor and publisher. The paper at that time was a small sheet, a five-column patent outside, with a very limited circulation. Mr. Wright has succeeded in making it a six-column quarto, which has a good patronage in its advertising columns, and a large circulation. The paper is now a credit to its editor and to New Madrid County. Mr. Wright was married in this city in October, 1884, to Miss Cora Grover, who was born, reared and educated in Adams County, Ill. She is a daughter of Benjamin F. Grover, of that county. One son has blessed this union: Grover. He is a member of the A. O. U. W., and is recorder of his lodge, and is, also, clerk of the city council."
