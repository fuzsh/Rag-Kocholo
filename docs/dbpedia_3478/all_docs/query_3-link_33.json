I know there are a lot of firms out there that mention a lot of promises – promises they can’t deliver. What I wanted in my attorney was someone who would be honest with me – for good and bad – and be willing to fight for me and my family. Mr. Williams handled my case with toughness toward the other side, and always made sure to check on us to see how we were doing. I heard from his staff as well, that we got to be on a first name basis, and they were going above and beyond to help. Our case was settled a lot quicker than I thought – and I got a fair and just settlement. I know there are a lot of attorneys out there, but for my money – and it is – you could not ask for a better lawyer than William Williams. He has my full recommendation.\n\n11-22-2022\n\nAaron H.\n\nWilliam Williams and the staff at Lytal, Reiter, Smith, Ivey & Fronrath were excellent and took care of my case, as well as making sure we were OK.

Huge thank to Amarys Reyes and Regan Navarro they were exceptional. I would highly recommend Mr. William Williams and his staff.\n\nMarch 17, 2021\n\nJoseph M.\n\nI was in an accident. I got a call from the insurance agency from the person that hit me. They wanted me to sign a document and I felt really under a lot of pressure from them. They offered me an amount of money that really did not even cover the repairs to my truck. So, I reached out to Lytal Reiter and was connected with Bill Williams. From the start I knew I made the right choice in calling them. The entire team worked diligently to let me understand my rights and that I did not have to settle for what the insurance company was offering. During the entire process, they kept me informed of what was happening and I never felt in the dark with my case. When it was all over, I received a settlement that covered repairs, medical expenses and money I lost in time I could not work. I don’t plan on getting into another accident anytime soon, but if I do or any of my friends do, I am calling Bill and the folks at Lytal Reiter! Great people!\n\nMarch 3, 2021\n\nIsrael S.\n\nAfter an auto accident William “Bill” Williams was recommended to me by another attorney in Boca Raton. Bill worked very diligently on my case and was very sincere and caring. His paralegal Amarys Reyes continually stayed in touch with me keeping me up to date. This firm is perhaps one of the best in the country. I now have another case and am using attorney Gabriel Isasi V and have had the same level of communication.\n\nFeb 24, 2021\n\nAnonymous\n\nBill Williams and his assistant Amarys Reyes did an excellent job representing me in my recent personal injury lawsuit. The case involved a car striking me in the bike lane while riding my bike along A1A in Lake Worth. The case was complicated by the fact we could not determine the true identity of the driver, but we had a positive identification of the owner of the vehicle. Bill determined the best way to proceed was against the owner of the vehicle. With their meetings with the insurance company representing the owner, filling all the detailed paperwork and negotiating settlement with the car owner’s insurance company we arrived at a favorable outcome. I highly recommend them.\n\nFeb 3, 2021\n\nJoel M.\n\nBill Williams handled my case. It was very complex, involved a lot of insurance companies and was complicated by no eyewitnesses and an inaccurate police report. His investigator Jimmie came to the accident scene with me, and his detailed investigation and analysis were very helpful in convincing the insurance companies to pay all I was due. One company disputed I was working because I was going between projects on my Harley. Bill got this shot down very quickly. All the insurance companies finally paid the maximum amounts; Bill’s work allowed me to pay all my bills, live well and keep my company running and my workers employed. His fee for all this work was very fair. If you have a difficult and complex case or any serious injury this is the attorney and firm to retain. Bill reviewed all my insurance and found benefits I did not even know I was entitled to for this accident. They were very helpful and knowledge when I was interviewed by insurance company investigators. Do not deal with an insurance company without Bill. At the end of the day Bill and Jimmie got me a fair and proper settlement with all companies. I can tell you without them I would not have had a chance. When ads for the firm are on TV and feature Bill, I am always proud to say he was my attorney. I recommend him to those in need of a fair shake on an accident. He still sends me a card on my birthday and at Christmas. Just a great friend now and a really, really good attorney. You can take it to the bank with Bill and he will see that the insurance companies treat you fairly. They all settled out of court. This is a testament to his ability.\n\nFeb 3, 2021\n\nSarah P.\n\nMr. Williams is an excellent attorney. Very punctual and friendly. Always available any time you call him. His staff is just as wonderful. He did an excellent job with my case. Quickly handled my case to make sure I deserved what was necessary for my recovery and with the losses I incurred. Highly recommend him and staff.\n\nFeb 2, 2021\n\nAmy G.\n\nThe day of a car crash is never a good day but with the expertise of Bill Williams, esquire better days lie ahead. The injuries sustained combined with financial difficulties makes for an overwhelming situation. Mr. Williams offers guidance and support that helps to create an intelligent plan of litigation. He is most accessible and always willing to go the extra mile to resolve any issue. The firm of Lytal, Reiter, et al has our strongest endorsement.\n\nFeb 1, 2021\n\nJuliana C.\n\nI have used Bill Williams twice when in a car accident that wasn’t my fault.\n\nBill stepped in right away to help me, when I didn’t know what the next steps were for seeking medical care. He was able to get all my medical expenses covered as well additional money to pay for my continued care. He also called and checked on me personally once a week and made sure if I had any questions or needed anything. I would highly recommend Bill Williams.\n\nJan 23, 2021\n\nPatricia J.\n\nMr. Bill Williams was our attorney when my husband had a car accident. He is extremely knowledgeable and conscientious.

I can’t thank him enough for helping us thru this trying time!\n\nJan 21, 2021\n\nRachel M.\n\nThis firm is extremely professional, and Mr. William Williams (Bill) comes with my highest recommendation. He gave me his personal cell phone number and told me I could call anytime. He was very responsive to all of my needs. In a time very difficult to me, he provided me with service that surpassed my expectations. He gave me hope in a time of turmoil. He has a very direct and no-nonsense approach and there is no sugar-coating; this realistic and honest approach was much appreciated. This is a person you definitely want on your side. I did not know who to turn to when I found out I was in need of an attorney. I had the good fortune of a personal recommendation to call Bill. I am so happy to have had that recommendation and now I can tell you from my own experience that if you are in South Florida and are in need of an attorney with Mr. Williams practicing specialty, then he is the person you need representing you. Thank you for all you did to help me Mr. Williams!\n\nNov 16, 2020\n\nPeter M.\n\nI was involved in a rear end collision which sustained me injuries to my neck and lower back. The initial attorney dropped the ball in filing timely which voided the case. I went to seek new counsel with the Lytal firm and employed Atty. William Williams. Thanks to him and Amarys Reyes, the case was reinstated, and I received the compensation due me. I would always trust and call upon them for any legal issues.\n\nOctober 20, 2020\n\nLavonna R.\n\nI can’t thank Bill Williams enough for the exceptional outcome on my case. He went above and beyond and superseded my expectations on my settlement.

They were gentle, encouraging and patient with me, thoroughly professional and personable. You want these folks representing you – not just for the win, but to help make this unpleasant process easier.\n\nJune 21, 2018\n\nElizabeth P.\n\nMy case was handled by Bill Williams and Amarys Reyes. It is hard to express how incredibly appreciative I am of their work. Since the man who hit me had so little insurance, I faced the possibility of being in debt from the accident that severely injured me. But they worked so hard to advocate for me that I am not in debt and was able to receive enough money from the settlement to take care of myself while I continue rehabilitation. They have been instrumental in making my recovery possible.\n\nJune 5, 2017\n\nDeardra K.\n\nI was referred by a dear friend to attorney Bill Williams office for a first-time experience after having a car accident.
