The organization regularly serves as an advocate for the preservation and rehabilitation of historic buildings and neighborhoods and is financed through memberships, corporate and foundation gifts, and public grants.\n\nBy 1994 the Liberty Memorial was closed to the public because of safety concerns. There was significant deterioration of the underlying supports of the buildings. The Kansas City Parks and Recreation Department has responsibility for the Liberty Memorial site (Kansas City owns the buildings and the land) and coordinated the planning as well as the construction work for the necessary repairs. In 1998 an eighteen-month sales tax for the restoration of the Memorial and the creation of an endowment for the memorial and the museum was approved by Kansas City voters. When the tax expired in 2000, it had raised $45.5 million dollars for the Memorial. Additional funds came from the State of Missouri and the federal government with an estimated total of $102,000,000 raised for the project. While the restoration of the existing Memorial was a focus of the Parks Board plan, it also included a significant expansion of the space for the Liberty Memorial Museum.\n\nWilliam T.
