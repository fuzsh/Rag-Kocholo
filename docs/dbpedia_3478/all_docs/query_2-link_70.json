        "text": "Lottie Ellen Ward Williams was born May 21, 1943 in Seiling, OK to Willis Dowel and Francis Alice (Plummer) Ward and passed away January 30, 2018 in Enid. In 1961, she graduated from Enid High School. Over the years, Lottie worked at various places including being the manager for Lot-A-Burger for some time. But her passion was always being a caregiver for others. She was blessed by being a blessing to those that needed her. Lottie enjoyed fishing and her favorite furbaby will always be her dog, Pudgy. She was preceded in death by her parents; son, Irby Williams; daughter, LeAnn Williams; brother Buddy Ward and sister, Toni Miskell. Lottie leaves behind her daughter, Angela Williams; five siblings, Alice, Viola, Kathy, Shila and Polly; seven grandchildren, Michael, Jackie, Forest, Corey, Amber, Kenzie and Matthew; two great-grandchildren, Peyton and Kia as well as several nieces and nephews. Graveside service for Lottie will be 2:00pm Friday, February 2, 2018 in Paradise Cemetery, Breckenridge, OK. Services are under the direction of Henninger-Hinson Funeral Home. Memorial contributions may be given through the funeral home to the charity of ones choice.
