        "text": "A LOVING WIFE, MOTHER, AND GRANDMOTHER PASSES. Lottie B. Williams, long-time resident of Seaside, and an active member of Hayes Chapel in Seaside where she also served as President of the Missionary Society, was called Home on November 2, 2005 after a long illness. Lottie Williams was born on October 16, 1923 in Jacksonville, Alabama. Her parents, Sam and Roxie Woods, also had two sons, one of whom predeceased Lottie. Her surviving brother, Mack Woods resides in Lawrence, Mississippi. Lottie is survived by her husband Charlie L. Williams, also of Jacksonville, Alabama. Lottie and Charlie were married for 64 years, and Lottie is survived by the three children from this union, Carl, James (“Jimmy”) and Sigrid, and by daughter-in laws, Jayne Williams and Jacqueline Williams. Lottie is also survived by her loving grandchildren Tamela Austin, Brandon Chapman, Chad Williams, Robin Hinton, Kelli Williams, and Jamie Williams; and by great-grandchildren Ashley Chapman, Jordan Chapman, Devean Hinton, Rashaad Austin, Michael Malachi O’Donal, and Gabriel Williams. Lottie received her high school diploma from Jacksonville High School in Jacksonville, Alabama. Lottie was a consummate cook; visitors to her home in Seaside would often find her in the kitchen. Among her many culinary treats that is most revered by family and friends is her rum pound cake. Always active in pursuits that engaged her mind, Lottie was especially fond of quilting, and she often presented her friends and children with gifts ofexquisitely designed quilts. Lottie was an avid reader with a passion for knowledge, and she practiced what she often preached to her children and acquaintances-“you are never too old to learn”-by enrolling in Monterey Peninsula College and receiving an Associate of Arts degree at the age of 51. Funeral services will be held on Friday, November 11, 2005, 11:00 a.m. at Hayes Chapel, located at 625 Elm Street, Seaside, California. A quiet hour will be held at The Chapel of Seaside on Thursday, November 10, 2005 from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m."
