        "text": "Lottie Made History 100 Years Ago\n\nOne hundred years ago one of the most colorful political figures in Illinois history was elected to the Illinois State Legislature. A major achievement for women and Downers Grove – it was the election of Lottie Holman O’Neill(1878-1967).\n\nBorn in Berry, Illinois, Lottie with her husband William moved to Downers Grove in 1908. Here they raised their family while Lottie was active in the Red Cross, Campfire Girls, Downers Grove Women’s Club, and President of the Parent Teachers Association. It was her husband who encouraged her to enter politics, so in November of 1922 she ran for the Illinois State Legislature. She believed women should have a place in politics so their voices could be heard.\n\nOn January 3, 1923, Lottie took her seat in Springfield, escorted by 1000 women who took a special train from Union Station for the event.\n\nWhen Lottie came to the capitol a bathroom had to be built as she was the first and only woman serving. They called it Lottie’s Potty.\n\nElected just 2 years after the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote, her career would last 38 years. She served 13 terms in the House of Representatives and was elected 3 times to the State Senate. During that time she fought for bills to fund schools for disabled children, 8-hour workdays for women, and the right for women to serve on juries.\n\nLottie retired from politics in 1962 and passed away in 1967, but she was not forgotten. In 1976 a statue was dedicated to her in the Rotunda of the State Capitol in Springfield and Downers Grove named a Middle School in her honor. The history Lottie O’Neill made 100 years ago should be remembered today."
