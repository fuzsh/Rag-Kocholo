In 1961, she graduated from Enid High School. Over the years, Lottie worked at various places including being the manager for Lot-A-Burger for some time.

She was preceded in death by her parents; son, Irby Williams; daughter, LeAnn Williams; brother Buddy Ward and sister, Toni Miskell. Lottie leaves behind her daughter, Angela Williams; five siblings, Alice, Viola, Kathy, Shila and Polly; seven grandchildren, Michael, Jackie, Forest, Corey, Amber, Kenzie and Matthew; two great-grandchildren, Peyton and Kia as well as several nieces and nephews. Graveside service for Lottie will be 2:00pm Friday, February 2, 2018 in Paradise Cemetery, Breckenridge, OK. Services are under the direction of Henninger-Hinson Funeral Home. Memorial contributions may be given through the funeral home to the charity of ones choice. Condolences can be made online at www.enidwecare.com

Note: These are general guidelines; some florists may not be able to operate within these timelines. During peak periods such as Valentineâ€™s Day, Memorial Day and most holidays, florists are not always able to keep up to demand. Tribute will contact you if there are any issues.

Plant a tree: How does it work

When your purchase is complete, a post will be made on the tribute wall of the deceased signifying the planting of a memorial tree.

An official certificate recognizing your purchase will be included with your email receipt. You can then forward the email to the family or print it and give it to them personally.

After an order is placed, our forestry partners will plant the tree in the area of greatest need (nearest the funeral home), according to the planting schedule for the year.

Due to seasonal conditions, the tree planting takes place during the spring and summer.
