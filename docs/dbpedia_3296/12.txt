About Delmarva Public Media

Delmarva Public Media is a collaboration of public radio stations owned by Salisbury University (WSCL and WSDL) and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (WESM).

Our three stations feature the widest variety of public radio programming on the Delmarva peninsula.

For nearly 40 years, these stations have provided quality music, news, and programming to the Delmarva Peninsula.

On July 1, 2020, the three stations began broadcasting collectively in a collaborative effort now known as Delmarva Public Media.

Three stations. Three distinct formats.

Classical Delmarva, WSCL 89.5, is all classical, all the time.

WSDL 90.7 FM is our "Rhythm & News" station, featuring award-winning local news, student productions, and NPR news. The "AAA" format station features everything from Americana to Zydeco, homegrown programs that you can't find anywhere else, and World Cafe and XPoNential Radio.

WESM 91.3 "Jazz Blues and NPR News"

features live hosted jazz, NPR news programs, award-winning local news, blues, soul, funk, R&B and music from around the globe.

This 3-station collaboration offers up the most diverse, inclusive, and robust offering of programming that aims to inform, entertain, and enlighten our community.

For almost four decades, we have been Delmarva's hometown public radio stations and we are committed to providing this vital service to the community and continuing to be your hometown public radio stations.
