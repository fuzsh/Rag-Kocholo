        "text": "Editor's Note: This report has been updated the clarify the proposed relationship with DPR and WESM.\n\nTwo of the peninsula's public radio stations are discussing more collaboration, a move that would bring Delmarva Public Radio and WESM closer together.\n\nOfficials from both Salisbury University and University of Maryland Eastern Shore, which run DPR and WESM respectively, confirmed that discussions are ongoing, although no agreements have been signed yet.\n\n\"DPR and WESM are in discussions about ways to collaborate that would provide efficiencies for both stations; however, no agreements have been signed, and those discussions are ongoing,\" Karen Olmstead, provost and senior vice president of academic affairs, said through a spokesperson.\n\nBill Robinson, UMES spokesperson, referred to the discussions as \"preliminary.\"\n\nMore: Delmarva Public Radio supporters meet to discuss its future\n\nMore: Photos: The 2018 stories that shaped Delmarva\n\nHe said the station manager at WESM, listed on the station's site as Gerry Weston, was working with DPR to find a way for the two National Public Radio-affiliate stations to collaborate in the future to share resources as well as costs. Weston worked at DPR from 2007 to 2011, according to a 2017 release from UMES.\n\n\"There is neither a formal plan or a proposal on the table at this time ... as to how the two institutions might work together,\" Robinson said in an email. \"Discussions are ongoing.\"\n\nIt isn't known at this time how such a change would affect those who work at the station or what changes might be in store for listeners of either station if the two stations were to combine resources.\n\nSuch a change would be beneficial for local lovers of public radio, said Kel Nagel, president of the Friends of Delmarva Public Radio group. The friends group, while not formally part of DPR, supports the station and is made up of some of the station's closest backers.\n\nMore: Delmarva welcomes first babies of 2019\n\nMore: A Look back at our top stories from December, ranked by what our readers read the most.\n\nHe said a collaboration between the two stations would lower expenses between the two stations and would help preserve public radio. Such a decision is up to the administrations of SU and UMES, however.\n\n\"It's probably what needs to be done,\" Nagel said.\n\nAt a meeting of the friends group in November, officials discussed how sustainability has been a problem for the station in light of the rise of drivers preferring to stream music from smart devices rather than listen to the radio as well as stations like WAMU, which has much of the same programming and sometimes a better signal.\n\nRadio listenership has dropped, as has underwriting money and donations. Olmstead said in November that she had analyzed peer colleges and universities to see what they had as a far as a radio station, and only one school supported two different stations as Salisbury University does. At the time, she said she couldn't say for sure what that meant for the future of the stations.\n\nMore: What's happening in Wicomico, Salisbury\n\nMore: Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel new tolls in effect\n\nFor the time being, however, Nagel hopes the stations are able to come to an agreement that benefits both the stations and the listeners.\n\n\"I'm pretty excited about the stations possibly coming together,\" Nagel said. \"It's always a challenge when it comes to this sort of thing, but I think it would be a good change.\""
