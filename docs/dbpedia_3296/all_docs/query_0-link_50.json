In a recent interview about his book, Dr. Wright notes, “I wanted to use Kanye’s career and life as a case study on the Black celebrity in America. I hope that people can use this book to engage in deeper dialogues and conversations on race, class, fame, identity, and what it means to be an exceptional Black man or woman in a white-centric American society.” Dr. Wright is a scholar of Black celebrities and has written extensively on this and other topics. He is the author of “‘Empire and Black Images in Popular Culture,” which examines the evolution and potency of black images in popular culture and explores the television show “Empire” and its place in a diverse body of literature and media, data and discussions on respectability. Dr. Wright is also the host of “Woke History,” a new podcast series streaming on the National Public Radio app, NPR One, that is also available at WESM-FM.
