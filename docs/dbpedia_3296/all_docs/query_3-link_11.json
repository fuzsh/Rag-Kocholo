and\n\n(c) The cost of constraint violation based on the constraint violation coefficients.\n\n3.6.1.4 In formulating the market dispatch optimization model, the Market Operator and System Operatorshall ensure that the dispatch for each trading intervalis made subject to:\n\n(a) Constraints representing limits on generation offer, demand bidand when applicable reserve quantities as specified by Trading Participants in accordance with clause 3.5, except to the extent that as they may be relaxed in accordance with clause 3.5.13;\n\n(b) Constraints representing the technical characteristics of reserve facility categories, including when applicable reserve effectiveness factors initially set at one (1);\n\n(c) Energy balance equations for each node in the market network model ensuring that the net load forecast for the end of the trading intervalat each market trading nodeas determined by theMarket Operatoris met;\n\n(d) Constraints representing limitations on the ramp ratefrom the plant status deemed to apply prior to the commencement of the trading interval;\n\n(e) Constraints defining power system reserve requirements asprovided by the System Operator under clause 3.5.3;\n\n(f) Network constraints, as implied by the market network modelprovided by the System Operator under clause 3.5.3;\n\n(g) Loss and impedance characteristics of market network lines, as advised by the System Operator under clause 3.5.3, and defined in Appendix A2;\n\n(h) Constraintson HVDC link operations, as advised by the System Operator under clause 3.5.3, and defined in Appendix A2;\n\n(i) Power flow equations, as defined by a DC approximation to an AC power flow within AC sub-systems;\n\n(j) Any overriding constraints imposed on the recommendation of the System Operator in accordance with clause 3.5.13; and\n\n(k) Any additional constraints due to ancillary servicesor system security requirements.\n\n3.6.1.5 The market dispatch optimization model shall be designed so that, subject to the approximations and adjustments provided for by clause 3.6.4:\n\n(a) It will produce an optimal dispatchgiven the objective defined by clause 3.6.1.3, and the constraint structure defined by clause 3.6.1.4, and specifying dispatch targets for each scheduled generating unit, scheduled load and reserve facility;\n\n(b) It will produce a schedule of flows on each transmission linecorresponding to the optimal dispatch determined in accordance with clause 3.6.1.5 (a);\n\n(c) It will produce energy prices for each market trading node, and when applicable reserve price for each reserve region, so that the recommended dispatch targets for each individual Trading Participant would be optimal for that participant at those prices, given their offers and demand bidsand after accounting for other constraints which may affect that Trading Participant; and\n\n(d) It will perform its functions in accordance with the performance standards approved by the PEM Board.\n\n3.6.2 Constraint Violation Coefficients\n\n3.6.2.1 The constraint violation coefficients shall:\n\n(a) Be set so as to ensure that the market dispatch model will always find a solution which satisfies all constraints, if such a solution exists;\n\n(b) Be set so as to ensure that binding constraints are prioritized, such that constraints resulting in the lowest reduction in the capability of the network, loador generating units will occur first;

and\n\n(d) Shall preserve, under all operating conditions, an accuracy which is generally acceptable to all WESM Members and particularly to any Trading Participants directly affected by such approximations.\n\n3.6.5 Model Development\n\nFrom time to time, the System Operator and the Market Operator shall investigate the scope for further development of the market dispatch optimization model beyond the minimum requirements specified in clause 3.6.1 and, submit their recommendations in a report to the PEM Board for public consultation.\n\n3.6.6 Market Settlement\n\nThe market shall be cleared, prices determined, and dispatch determined\n\naccording to the model results for each trading interval, in the form that is written. The model results shall not be challenged ex-post.\n\nIn the event that Trading Participantsidentify solution inconsistencies with the stated definition and objectives of the model, the Market Operatorwill formulate a plan to correct the model.\n\nNotwithstanding such model solution errors, the spot marketshall continue to be cleared according to the model results until a model revision is put into service in accordance with clause 3.6.5.\n\n3.7 MARKET PROJECTIONS\n\nThe Market Operator shall prepare and publish week ahead projectionsand day ahead projectionsusing the market dispatch optimization model, in accordance with the timetable.\n\n3.7.1 Week Ahead Projections\n\n3.7.1.1 Weekahead projections shall be prepared by the Market Operatorand published daily, in accordance with the timetable, to assist Trading Participants to anticipate and respond to the range of spot market conditions which might reasonably be expected to occur over the forthcoming week.\n\n3.7.1.2 Market projections shall be prepared for all trading intervalswithin the relevant market horizon as defined in the timetable.\n\n3.7.2 Day Ahead Projections\n\n3.7.2.1 Day ahead projections shall be prepared using the market dispatch optimization modelby the Market Operatorand published regularly through the day, in accordance with the timetable, to assist Trading Participantsto anticipate and respond to the range of spot marketconditions which might reasonably be expected to occur over the forthcoming day.\n\n3.7.2.2 Market projections shall be prepared for all trading intervalswithin the relevant market horizon as defined in the timetable.\n\n3.7.3 Preparation of Market Projections\n\n3.7.3.1 Each market projection shall take into consideration:\n\n(a) Thenetwork service provider data prepared in accordance with clause 3.5.2;\n\n(b) Reserve requirements, the anticipated market network model configuration,constraints and system security requirements for each reserve region, as advised by the System Operator in accordance with clause 3.5.3;\n\n(c) The forecast demand information prepared in accordance with clause 3.5.4;\n\n(d) The generation offer information submitted by each relevant Trading Participantin accordance with clause 3.5.5;\n\n(e) The loading levels for each non-scheduled and NRE generating units with intermittent energy resourcein accordance with clause 3.5.5; and\n\n(f) When applicable, the reserve offer information submitted by each relevant Trading Participantin accordance with clause 3.5.7 and 3.5.8.\n\n3.7.3.2 Prior to the preparation of each set of market projections, the Market Operator shall, in consultation with the System Operator, prepare an expected unrestrained net load forecast in accordance with the procedures developed under clause 3.5.4, and such number of other load scenariosas may be determined in consultation with WESM Participantsand approved by the PEM Board.\n\n3.7.3.3 The Market Operatorshall prepare a market projection corresponding to each load scenario developed under clause 3.7.3.2.\n\n3.7.3.4 When a probability of a significant failure in the power systemhas been advised to the System Operator, the Market Operatormay, in consultation with the System Operator, also prepare market projectionsin which the constraintstructure is modified to represent a situation in which such failures occur.\n\n3.7.3.5 Market projections shall be prepared by the Market Operator through the application of the market dispatch optimization model to all trading intervals within the relevant market horizonas defined in the timetable.\n\n3.7.3.6 When preparing a market projection, the starting conditions for each successive trading interval shall be determined:\n\n(a) In respect of the first trading interval, as the actual, or expected, power system conditions at the time of the commencement of the market projection; and\n\n(b) In respect of subsequent trading intervals, as the projected power system conditions determined by the market dispatch optimization model for the end of the previous trading intervalin that market projection.\n\n3.7.3.7 The Market Operator shall publish additional updated versions of a market projectionin the event of changes which, in the opinion of the Market Operator, are material and which should be communicated to Trading Participants.\n\n3.7.3.8 The Market Operator shall document the exact procedure it uses for preparation of market projections and make the procedure available to all Trading Participants.\n\n3.7.4 Published Information\n\n3.7.4.1 Based on the information referred to in clause 3.7.3, each market projection publishedby the Market Operator in accordance with the timetable shall contain the following information for each trading intervalin the period covered by the market projection:\n\n(a) The assumed net load forecast at each market network node, plus required reserves for each reserve region;\n\n(b) The required level of reserve for each reserve region;\n\n(c) Any modifications to plant or network availability which the Market Operatormay have made under clause 3.5.13 in forming this projection;\n\n(d) Projected aggregate dispatch of scheduled generating unitsand scheduled loadat each market network node;\n\n(e) Projected aggregate cleared reserve quantities for reserve regionsand reserve facility categories;\n\n(f) The projected market price for each market trading node;\n\n(g) When applicable projected reserve prices for each reserve region; and\n\n(h) Identification and quantification of:\n\n(1) Projected load shedding requirement;\n\n(2) Projected violations of system security;\n\n(3) Projected failure to meet reserve requirements;\n\n(4) Trading intervals for which low or inadequate capacity margins are projected to apply;
