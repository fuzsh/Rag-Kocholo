        "text": "The Independent Electricity Market Operator of the Philippines (IEMOP), operator of the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM), announced that it is preparing market participants for the official launch of the WESM Mindanao on January 26, 2023.\n\nEnergy Secretary Raphael Lotilla signed the Department of Energy Circular 2022-12-0039 in December 2022, requiring Mindanao electric power industry participants and entities to register as WESM members.\n\nAs part of the preparations for the commercial launch of WESM Mindanao, IEMOP hosted a Focus Group Discussion(FGD) in collaboration with various energy industry agencies. IEMOP discusses the provisions of DOE Circular 2022-12-0039 and the activities leading up to WESM’s commercial operations in the region.\n\n“The commercial operation of WESM Mindanao and the MVIP [Mindanao Visayas Interconnection Project] is expected to improve the reliability of electric power supply not only in the Mindanao grid but also in the Luzon and Visayas grids,” according to the circular. It also stated that the commercial operation of the MVIP would require the commercial operations of WESM Mindanao to allow for the efficient transfer of electricity exchanges.\n\nThe circular also requires the market operator to facilitate WESM registration and authorize the disconnection of WESM participants and entities that are required to register but are unable to do so.\n\nThe critical roles of different agencies such as IEMOP, National Electrification Administration (NEA), Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corp. (PSALM), Philippine Electricity Market Corp. (PEMC), and National Grid Corp. of the Philippines (NGCP) were also discussed in the circular.\n\nAmong the roles played by various agencies were:\n\nThe IEMOP should also ensure that WESM Mindanao participants comply with the registration requirements and take appropriate action to address noncompliance. They should also ensure that the WESM Mindanao transitions and operates smoothly.\n\nThe PEMC will monitor and evaluate the WESM Mindanao implementation and make recommendations to address any policy issues that may arise. It will also impose sanctions and penalties following the circular’s provisions.\n\nThe NEA will assist electric cooperatives (ECs) in completing their WESM registration and coordinate with relevant agencies to ensure that the ECs meet the financial and technical requirements for WESM registration.\n\nSo the real question is, Are you ready to transition with the WESM Mindanao commercial operations?\n\nWe understand that you are committed to ensuring that your company remains compliant with the WESM rules and market manuals, but we also know that it can be difficult to keep track of all of your obligations.\n\nThat’s why we at Exist Software Labs Inc. provide Energy System Solutions, a solution that helps you:\n\n– Automate the collection of 5-minute WESM data,\n\n– Comply with the NEW BIR Ruling,– Streamline submission to CRSS and NMMS,\n\n– Seamless monitoring of MMS data such as RTD, HAP, DAP, LMP, and others,\n\n– Generation of BCQ for CRSs upload,\n\n– Smooth processing of CRSS Metering and Settlement data, and more!\n\nWe will help you avoid sanctions and penalties by assisting you to ensure full compliance with all of your obligations under WESM Rules and Market Manuals.\n\nCheck out these links to help you get prepared for WESM Mindanao commercial operation\n\n– WESM Mindanao\n\n– WESM Operations\n\n– WESM-Mindanao-FGD-Grid-Scheduled-Gens_QA-_clean.pdf (iemop.ph)"
