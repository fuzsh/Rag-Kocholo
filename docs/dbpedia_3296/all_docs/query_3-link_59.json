Enables students to understand and evaluate United Methodism in light of its antecedent organizations, the broader historical context of the history of Christianity, and especially its engagement in mission. Also enables students to engage in responsible and articulate participation in the life and leadership of the United Methodist Church, effectively represent the tradition, and perceptively participate in ecumenical and interreligious dialogue."
