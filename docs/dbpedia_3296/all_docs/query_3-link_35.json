        "text": "By Darwin Wally T. Wee\n\nZAMBOANGA CITY, March 13 (PNA) -– The overall power condition in Mindanao is expected to improve with the establishment of the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) in June, a government official said.\n\n“The primary objective of establishing WESM in Mindanao is to promote transparency and efficiency in the power (sector) since all the data such as demand, supply, pricing, connectivity, and others will be made available in real-time at WESM’s website,” Glenn Jay Reston, technical head of the Mindanao Development Authority’s (MinDA) power development program, told the Philippines News Agency on Monday.\n\nIn addition, the aim in opening a spot market for electricity in the island-region is part of the Department of Energy’s (DOE) goal to provide a platform to properly handle the excess supply coming from Mindanao-based power firms.\n\nEarlier, Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi said part of their main thrusts is to ensure the security, reliability and availability of transparent and reasonably-priced electricity in the country.\n\nCurrently, the daily excess power of the Mindanao grid averages around 400 megawatts (MW). It started when new Mindanao-based power firms began commercial operations in the third quarter of 2016.\n\nThe present Mindanao power situation is a complete reversal from two to three years ago, when the island region suffered a daily energy supply shortfall of at least 500 MW, resulting to five to eight hours of daily brownouts in parts of the island such as in the cities of General Santos and Zamboanga.\n\nThe Mindanao daily power demand is around 1,800 MW based on the bulletin of the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP).\n\nThe excess in supply is expected to reach 1,000 MW for this year, and will double in the succeeding years, as new power plants will begin to operationalize, Reston said.\n\nUnder the WESM operation, energy suppliers will post their prices that will be bid out by customers or the power distribution utilities. The scheme will provide the power utilities an option where to source their supply.\n\nTo date, distribution utilities source their supply through bilateral contracts with power generating companies.\n\nThe Philippine Electricity Market Corporation (PEMC), an agency under the DOE, will manage WESM just like in the Luzon and Visayas regions.\n\nWESM is similar to the Interim Mindanao Electricity Market (IMEM) that was implemented in 2013 at the height of the energy crisis in the southern Philippines.\n\nMeanwhile, the DOE and MinDA have recently finished its consultations among key sectors in Mindanao for the establishment of WESM.\n\n“It is expected that the final version of the circular establishing WESM in Mindanao will be published this month,” Reston said.\n\nAn information campaign will follow next month to ensure that Mindanoans will fully understand the concept of WESM and appreciate its benefits before its launching in June.\n\nReston said another idea in setting up WESM is for the power producers in Mindanao to sell excess electricity to Luzon and Visayas in the future.\n\nBased on the data from NGCP, the two main areas for interconnectivity are Negros/Cebu-Zamboanga for the western route and Leyte-Surigao for the eastern route.\n\n“It will create a bigger market for our suppliers,” Reston said.
