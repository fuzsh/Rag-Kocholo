        "text": "Who runs this car donation program?\n\nThis program is a legacy of the public radio show Car Talk. For more than three decades, Tom and Ray Magliozzi (aka Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers) answered listeners' questions about cars, and provided laughs, comfort, and trustworthy advice to millions. While Tom passed away in 2014, Ray and the rest of the staff decided to continue this program as a way to give back to the stations that were our friends and partners for decadesâ€“and whose programs we listen to every day.\n\nAlong with our car donation partners, we're proud to work with your local public radio station and help you turn your car into more of the programs you love. And we thank you for the help you are providing to our hard-working stations!\n\nWhat documents are needed for my car donation?\n\nYou'll need a clear title to donate your car. If you don't have one, you'll have to apply for a duplicate title. At the time of pick up, you'll hand over the signed title to the tow driver. Instructions on how to sign your Maryland title can be found here or by calling us at 1-877-215-0227.\n\nWhat about privacy? Will you share my information?\n\nWe are very careful with any information you provide. Donor information is not given to any organization except the IRS as required by law, and to the station to which you're donating. Your station will only get your name and contact information, which they've asked for because they're eager to thank you.\n\nIf (and only if) you specifically opt in during the process, one of our producers may contact you to ask you about why you donated your car, or to ask for a picture of you with the car we can share with other public radio fans. That is totally optional, though. By default, your information will be entirely private."
