The author discusses (i) the history of radio programming by non-broadcast professionals: (11) organization and training of non-broadcast professionals; (ill) the relationship between nonbroadcast professionals and their audiences: (iv) production processes of development programmes; and (v) topics covered as development programmes. The author concludes that Swaziland needs trained content specialists who understand the audience&#39;s technical requirements for programme production."
