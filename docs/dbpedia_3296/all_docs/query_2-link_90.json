        "text": "President Ferdinand ''Bongbong'' Marcos Jr. on Wednesday said the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) has temporarily suspended the operation of the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market amid the declaration of red alert status.\n\n''Dahil sa matinding init, tumataas ang konsumo ng kuryente na nakakadagdag sa pag-akyat ng presyo. Kahapon lamang ay kumilos na ang Energy Regulatory Commission o ERC upang pansamantalang isuspende ang operasyon ng tinatawag na Wholesale Electricity Spot Market o WESM kapag may idineklarang Red Alert ang System Operator o NGCP (National Grid Corporation of the Philippines),'' Marcos said in his speech during the Labor Day event.\n\n(Due to extreme heat, power consumption rose which would result to an increase in price. Yesterday, the ERC acted in temporarily suspending the WESM every time a red alert is declared by the NGCP.)\n\n''Ito ay naglalayon na pigilan ang pagtaas ng presyo ng kuryente sa gitna ng kalamidad na dulot ng El Niño,'' the President added.\n\n(This is intended to prevent hike in electric bills amid the calamity caused by El Niño.)\n\nThe WESM, created by virtue of Section 30 of Republic Act No. 9136 or the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) of 2001, is a venue for trading electricity as a commodity.\n\nThe Presidential Communications Office (PCO) said this is where the power generators sell their excess capacities not covered by contracts and where the customers buy additional capacities on top of their contracts.\n\nDuring an interview in Cotabato last Monday, Marcos guaranteed the public that the government will carry out plans and strategies to tame power prices amid the current high demand for electricity.\n\nThe power system is experiencing an overload due to the dry spell, Marcos had said.\n\nMore yellow and red alerts are expected in the coming weeks as the country has already exceeded its forecast demand given the prevailing heat levels amid the El Niño, the Department of Energy (DOE) earlier said.\n\nAccording to DOE Undersecretary Rowena Cristina Guevarra, the alerts will depend on the status of plants, and this could reach a red alert status should plants go on unscheduled outages as seen earlier this month."
