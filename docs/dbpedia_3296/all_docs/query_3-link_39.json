What is The Philippine Rural Electrification Program?\n\nThe Philippine Rural Electrification Program has initiated the lighting up of the countryside from a few hundred households to 15 million connections which benefited 70 million Filipinos for more than five decades. The impact of power in the rural areas has been reflected in the rise of small and medium-scale industries and in the improvement of the lives of rural folks through the availability and use of electric-driven appliances in their homes.\n\n2. What is NEA?\n\nThe National Electrification Administration (NEA) is the agency instrumental in the successful implementation of the Rural Electrification Program. It was created on July 28, 1969, through Republic Act No. 6038 which later became a corporation under Presidential Decree No. 269 on August 6, 1973, and has been granted additional power by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 1645 on October 8, 1979. For 53 years, NEA has undertaken the task of improving the socio-economic status of the people in the countryside through electrification. NEA has provided legal, institutional, financial, and technical (LIFT) assistance to the Electric Cooperatives (ECs) which in turn undertake power distribution on an area coverage basis.\n\nSection 58 of Republic Act No. 9136 or the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 mandates NEA to strengthen the technical capability and financial viability of rural ECs as electric distribution utilities and to prepare said ECs to operate and compete in the deregulated electricity market, specifically in an environment of open access and retail wheeling.\n\nRepublic Act No. 10531 also known as the National Electrification Administration Reform Act of 2013 further strengthens NEA’s role in helping the ECs become economically viable and prepare them for the implementation of the retail competition and open access.\n\n3.
