        "text": "Three New Shows and Musical Lineup Coming to WSDL 90.7 FM Starting April 9th.\n\nDelmarva Public Media is happy to announce the launch of two new music programs on Sundays and a restructuring of the program schedule on WSDL 90.7 FM beginning April 9, 2023.\n\nAdditionally, a brand new locally produced hour-long show will be added on Thursday afternoons at noon on WSDL beginning April 13th.\n\n“As we continue to shift programs around and add new ones that will help give each of our three FM stations a unique and strong identity, we are excited to add “Americanarama”, “Delmarvalous Americana”, and “On the Download” to our weekly WSDL lineup”, said Bryan Russo, Delmarva Public Media’s Director of Production and Operations.\n\nAmericanarama (Sundays, 7-9pm on WSDL 90.7FM)\n\nPremiering on Easter Sunday, listeners will now hear DPM’s “Americanarama.” The program is hosted by longtime Boston-based DJ Mike Gioscia and features a curated mix of alt-country, folk, roots, bluegrass, and country rock. Gioscia takes pride in crafting a show that blends together in a way that no algorithm can compute, which is why he is excited to share this experience with the listeners of Delmarva Public Media.\n\n“Mike is an incredible host with a show that I’ve admired for many years and when I heard that he was looking for a new home on the public radio airwaves, I knew our listeners on WSDL would welcome the show with open arms and ears”, said Russo.\n\nDelmarvalous Americana (Sunday, 9-10pm on WSDL 90.7 FM)\n\nThis hour-long weekly program, hosted by local radio personality and musician Billy Earl, aims to examine the voices, the sounds, and the personalities of the local and regional artists and musicians.\n\nIt will be a blend of music and conversation featuring a special guest each week.\n\n“I think that people will really enjoy Billy Earl’s passion for music, and his desire to help shine a light on the quality of musicians and artists that we have access to here in the Mid-Atlantic region”, said Russo. “We are very pleased to have it be a part of our growing list of ‘homegrown’ programs that we produce here at Delmarva Public Media.”\n\nOn the Download (Thursdays, 12-1pm on WSDL 90.7 FM)\n\nThere are approximately 60,000 songs that are released each and every day, so this program is a weekly deep dive into helping music lovers discover great new albums and bands that are often so easy to miss.\n\nHosted by Angela Semig, “On the Download” will focus more on new and recently released music leaning toward the AAA format, but will be carefully crafted and curated for both novice music listeners and serious music snobs.\n\n“The algorithms of streaming music services are so willing to tell you what they think you’ll like based on what you’ve already listened to”, said Russo, “this show aims to bring back the relationship that still exists between a passionate radio host and the listeners who are desperately seeking new music to discover”, said Russo, who will serve as Managing Producer on all three programs.\n\nSunday Schedule Changes on WSDL 90.7FM\n\nA number of shows will be airing at a new time beginning April 9th, including Steve Martin’s Unreal Bluegrass at 1pm (previously aired at 7pm), Folk Alley at 4pm (previously aired at 2pm), High Country Celtic Radio at 5am (previously at 4pm) and Ozark Highlands Radio, which will now air at 6am on Saturday mornings on WSDL (previously aired at 1pm on Sundays).\n\nThe programs that will no longer air on WSDL will be Technation, Deutsch Welle-inside Europe, and the Sunday evening broadcast of the BBC World Service.\n\nWSDL’s New Sunday Lineup\n\n12am-5am- Blues Before Sunrise\n\n5am – High Country Celtic Radio\n\n6am – With Good Reason\n\n7am – You Bet Your Garden\n\n8am-10am – BBC World Service\n\n10am – Splendid Table\n\n11am – This American Life\n\n12pm – Delmarva Today\n\n1pm-4pm – Steve Martin’s Unreal Bluegrass\n\n4pm-6pm – Folk Alley\n\n6pm-7pm – Woodsongs\n\n7pm-9pm – Americanarama\n\n9pm-10pm – Delmarvalous Americana\n\n11pm-12am – Midnite Special\n\nFull program schedule for all three stations can be found at delmarvapublicmedia.org."
