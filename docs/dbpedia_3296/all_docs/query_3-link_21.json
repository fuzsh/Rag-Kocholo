I am a Member of the Apache Software Foundation. I was previously CTO and co-founder at Voltron Data and remain a Senior Advisor. Before that I worked at Two Sigma Investments, Cloudera, and co-founded DataPad.\n\nI blog occasionally on my personal website.\n\nYou can sponsor me with GitHub Sponsors. I donate at least $1000 each year to NumFOCUS to support pandas and also encourage you to consider donating there, too."
