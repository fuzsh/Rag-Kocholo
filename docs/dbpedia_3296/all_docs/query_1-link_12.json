In fact, WESM M is the only radio station on the Eastern Shore that offers a unique balance of mainstream jazz, blues, world and gospel music programs – as well as up-to-the-minute local and national news coverage, community issues and informative talk shows. WESM 91.3 FM began broadcasting in March 1987 and our license is held by the University of Maryland Eastern Shore located in Princess Anne, Maryland. We’re an affiliate of National Public Radio (NPR), Public Radio International (PRI), and other public radio consortiums. Broadcasting at approximately 50,000 watts, WESM reaches a broad audience across the Eastern Shores of Maryland & Virginia, as well as southern Delaware – and across the Chesapeake Bay to cover portions of Southern Maryland & Virginia’s Northern Neck. Our 24/7 live audio stream also draws listeners from around the world. WESM 91.3 FM has been honored with awards from the Chesapeake Associated Press Broadcasters Association (CAPBA) for Outstanding Public Affairs Program or Series ("
