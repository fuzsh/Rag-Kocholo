        "text": "Spotlight on the Wildlife and Environmental Society of Malawi: Advancing Climate Action (SDG-13) through Conservation Art and Education\n\nHaving been established in 1947, and now the oldest conservation NGO in Malawi, the Wildlife and Environmental Society of Malawi (WESM) works to advance Climate Action (SDG-13) through supporting conservation and sustainable management of Malawi’s wildlife and natural resources. WESM champions environmental education, and supports conservation and natural resource research through its membership network, and also promotes the agency of indigenous people in advancing Climate Action.\n\nWESM’s Environmental Clubs: At the Heart of Malawi’s Conservation Movement\n\nAt the centre of efforts in delivering environmental education in Malawi are WESM’s “Environmental Clubs”. With over 1,500 school-based clubs based out of nine branches across the country, each club helps enhance environmental knowledge and community involvement in conservation activities, working largely out of primary, secondary and college-level schools, as well as from youth groups and local village natural resource committees.\n\nThe WESM Lilongwe branch, responsible for seven districts and 800 clubs has reached over 5,000 people through training, engagement, coaching, and peer-to-peer mentorship in environmental sustainability and climate action practical skills sessions. This program has been key to building capacity and resilience for climate innovation in Malawi’s youth, and therefore continues to aim to build an environmentally conscious future Malawi.\n\nArt in Malawi’s Conservation Movement\n\nWESM has innovatively incorporated art into its movement to raise awareness for conservation priorities and activities in Malawi. Art-in-the-Park is a bi-annual event inviting businesses, government representatives, diplomats, and members of the public to increase exposure for artwork raising awareness about Malawi’s conservation movement. Similarly, Craft-in-the-Park targets craft industry professionals, widening WESM’s reach, and further contributing to raising funds for sustainable initiatives through some art-sale process.\n\nSupporting Conservation Awareness with WUSC\n\nUnder WESM and WUSC’s partnership, three volunteers have begun work with WESM under the Volunteer Cooperation Program funded by Global Affairs Canada. Volunteers have been able to build WESM’s capacity in program and management quality assurance, and ongoing coaching and mentoring programs, and play a central role in helping advance climate action through WESM.\n\nA Vision for Malawi’s Future\n\nWESM continues to seek out positive action towards conservation and climate action in Malawi. They are currently participating in the Chia Lagoon Community Waterbird project, aiming to mobilize community action in protecting fish, forestry and land resources. WESM also seeks to expand its environmental education program, particularly through raising awareness in disaster-prone areas and their local environmental clubs of climate resilient technologies that can be integrated into daily life."
