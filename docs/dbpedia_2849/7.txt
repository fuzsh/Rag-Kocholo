metro station, MRT - Mass Rapid Transit Singapore

The Marina Bay MRT Station (NS27) is the southern terminal station of the North South Line in Singapore. This station is located on reclaimed land and there are no developments surrounding it, and hence contrary to what the name implies, there exists a slight distance between the station and the actual town of Marina Bay. The station is used now as a means for locals to travel from other parts of the island here to connect to a bus service that brings them to a recreational area nearby. In the future, this station will serve businessmen & office workers who work in the up and coming New Downtown, an extension of Singapore's Central Business District. This Station will also serve residents who live in the New Downtown, as well as tourists and locals visiting the attractions that are located there.
