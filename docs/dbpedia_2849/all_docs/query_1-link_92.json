        "text": "National Day themes are always a call for solidarity, and this year's theme is no different. \"Together, As One United People\" is all about celebrating Singapore's success and banding together to forge a diverse and inclusive future. Singapore's ideals of democracy, peace, progress, justice, and equality are further captured in the five stars of the NDP logo, with six ascending strokes representing the pillars of Total Defence shooting out of the number \"59\" (cleverly designed to look like the letters \"SG\" too).\n\nA sucker for National Day theme songs? 2024's is a nostalgic piece titled Not Alone. Composed and sung by Benjamin Kheng, it pays homage to some of Singapore's most beloved NDP tunes. Take the lyrics \"But then I come to the river that runs through my town\", which calls to mind the familiar lines from Home written by Dick Lee.\n\nNDP 2024 is segmented into six sections. After a vibrant pre-parade show featuring float displays, marching bands, choir and dance performances, we dive straight into Chapter 1: Parade and Ceremony. Highlights include the Military Tattoo – a hybrid performance that will include precision drills and band performances – alongside favourites like the state flag flypast, presidential ceremonial vehicle drive-past, and 'Salute-to-the-Nation' bomb burst flown by fighter aircraft.\n\nChapter 2 marks 40 years of Total Defence with the first Dynamic Defence Display (D3) at the Padang. Watch live-action performances weaved together with multimedia films, showcasing our community’s rapid response to high-stakes emergency situations.\n\nA good hangover from the Covid-19 pandemic days is that NDP celebrations now spill over to the heartlands. On August 10, you and your family can enjoy celebrations at the following locations:\n\nYishun (field beside futsal arena)\n\nPunggol (field beside Waterway Point)\n\nBuona Vista (field beside Buona Vista MRT station)\n\nBishan (field opposite Bishan MRT Circle Line station)\n\nPaya Lebar (field next to Paya Lebar Quarter 1)\n\nEach of the five districts will have a unique theme. Look forward to carnival games, live performances, and static displays from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), and the Singapore Police Force (SPF). You must pick up a ticket from your community centre (while stocks last) to enter the celebration sites.\n\nNDP rehearsals are over, but there are still a couple of National Education (NE) shows for school kids and previews for the public. The remaining NE show is happening on July 20, while the previews will occur on July 27 and August 3. Ticket applications for previews and the actual NDP date have closed, but you can try to book hotel rooms close to the Padang if you're determined to get as close as you can to the fireworks and festivities!\n\nThe main star of the NDP is, undeniably, the prodigious pyrotechnics. This year, the usual main fireworks display will take place at the Padang before the singing of the National Anthem. Here are the best vantage points around downtown Singapore to catch the fireworks display.\n\nFireworks will also be set off at the aforementioned heartland locations on August 10. After the carnival games and live performances, stick around to catch the dazzling pyrotechnics at Yishun, Punggol, Buona Vista, Bishan, and Paya Lebar."
