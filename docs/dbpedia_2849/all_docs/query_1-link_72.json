        "text": "SINGAPORE – What is National Day without catching the parade’s show in the skies?\n\nThe Straits Times shares some tips on watching the National Day Parade (NDP)’s state flag fly-past, fighter jet aerial display, and fireworks show from the best spots in the city.\n\nWhen to watch\n\nIf you are on the lookout for some fireworks, Aug 9 is not the only day when you can catch a glimpse of the display.\n\nThe next NDP preview takes place on Aug 3, with the fireworks display estimated to begin at around 7.30pm and last till 8.20pm.\n\nEven after National Day, there will be fireworks on Aug 10 for the heartland celebrations in Bishan, Punggol, Yishun, Paya Lebar and Buona Vista.\n\nWhere to go\n\nAs the NDP fireworks are launched from the waters in the Marina Bay area that The Fullerton Bay Hotel and Marina Bay Sands overlook, the ideal spots to catch the fireworks include locations right next to the waters as well as some vantage points farther away.\n\nHere are seven locations to consider:\n\n1. Marina Bay Sands boardwalk\n\nTo see the fireworks up close, visitors can head to the Marina Bay Sands boardwalk, where the upper floors of the Apple store and Louis Vuitton stores at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands are located.\n\nThe area here tends to get quite busy, so it is recommended to reserve your spot earlier if you want a good view.\n\nYou can access the boardwalk by heading towards the ArtScience Museum from within The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands.\n\nWhat else to look out for in the skies\n\nFireworks are not the only thing to watch out for – the Republic of Singapore Air Force attack helicopters will be part of the NDP dynamic display for the first time at the Padang.\n\nFrom 5.45pm to 6.50pm on Aug 3 and 9, the public can look forward to catching 14 aircraft in the sky during the celebration, including a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, four Apache and three Chinook helicopters, and six F-16 jets.\n\nA Chinook helicopter will fly over the Padang for the state flag fly-past after 6.45pm, during the singing of the National Anthem.\n\nThe fighter jets will then perform a bomb burst at around 6.50pm as they approach the Padang from the south after the National Anthem, as a mark of respect for and a salute to the nation.\n\nThe jets will also be part of the dynamic display, with two of them positioned to intercept suspicious aircraft in a simulation and another two performing a vertical climb to an altitude of 3,000m.\n\nTo wrap up the display, the Apache helicopters will showcase an air-sea integrated operation over Marina Bay and the Padang as they approach from the Central Business District.\n\nGetting there\n\nThose intending to visit Marina Bay can use the Crowd@MarinaBay map online to view real-time crowd levels and areas which may be closed at the various fireworks viewing spots.\n\nAvailable on computers and mobile devices on Aug 3 from 1.30pm to 10pm, the map will also be displayed on television screens at selected MRT stations.\n\nIt will include available surface and underground walking paths around Marina Bay, which the public can use to avoid crowded areas.\n\nClarification note: In an earlier version of the story, we said that members of the public can head to the roof terrace at the Esplanade to watch the fireworks. Esplanade has clarified that the roof terrace is not open to public on Aug 3 and Aug 9."
