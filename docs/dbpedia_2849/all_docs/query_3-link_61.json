        "text": "At the mention of Marina Bay, you'll most likely visualise the iconic three-towered integrated resort. And we can't blame you as the iconic Marina Bay Sands have become the poster landmark of Singapore since its opening in 2010. With the world's largest infinity pool, the luxury hotel has attracted many travellers, including megastars the Beckhams and John Mayer.\n\nRight by the doorstep is the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. Feel the urge to splurge as you step into designer brands such as Chanel, Gucci and Dior, and celebrity chef restaurants like Bread Street Kitchen by Gordon Ramsay and Chinoiserie by Justin Quek.\n\nBut there's more to living like a Crazy Rich Asian at Marina Bay. Beyond the towering skyscrapers, the reclaimed land is peppered with plenty of things to do, see, eat and drink. Admire the view from above at the Singapore Flyer, take a stroll down Gardens by the Bay, or fly a kite at the Marina Barrage. And when you're feeling famished, take your pick from local delights or gourmet spreads – all within the vicinity of the bay and the city skyline.\n\nRECOMMENDED: 120 best things to do in Singapore and the ultimate guide to the Civic District\n\nFusing art and science, the 21 gallery spaces here have hosted some of the most famous exhibitions in the world. We're talking about those that feature the sets, costumes and props from blockbuster films such as Titanic and the Harry Potter franchise. Its current permanent exhibition, Future World, is a mind-bender: designed by Japanese arts collective teamLab, the show takes visitors on an interactive journey of lights, digital art and magic.\n\nWelcome the weekend with a memorable nocturnal carnival experience at this nightlife superstar. Priding itself as the biggest nightclub in the city, the indoor adult playground stretches over 2,300-square-metres across three floors with sky-high ceilings that tower up to 30 metres, and features a giant indoor Ferris wheel that offers revellers an unparalleled view of the nightclub. Beyond highly talented resident spinners, heavyweight entertainers and DJs from the dance music spectrum are also invited to helm its state-of-the-art Funktion One DJ console.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe stuff of nature-lovers’ dreams, Gardens by the Bay is a truly magnificent site. The 250-acre green haven is filled with huge, flora-wreathed towers connected by ‘skyways’ and two enormous conservatories. Opened in 2012 as part of a drive to bring more greenery into Singapore, the gardens are free for guests to explore but you'll need an admission ticket for access to the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and Floral Fantasy that house rotating floral exhibitions. Needless to say, this is a non-negotiable must-see.\n\nStart your nighttime indulgence with tantalising tipples and arcade fun at the stylish AVENUE. The lavish lounge boasts interactive play areas such as a mini-bowling alley, karaoke room, vintage arcade games like a pinball machine and skee ball machine, and a pool table. If you need some Dutch courage to ask out the hottie by the bar, pick your poison from original inventions and renditions of modern classics that take inspiration from AVENUE’s American roots and latest Asian home.\n\nAdvertising\n\nCÉ LA VI is one of the top (geddit?) ones – and its climb to the 67th spot in the DJMag’s Top 100 Clubs of 2018 list is a testament to that. Boasting 360-degree views over the Lion City, the nightclub is a hot spot to be seen. If you want to fit in with its A-list frequenters then be sure to dress the part. The club is known for throwing some incredible parties DJ’d by local and international names including Armin van Buuren, Fedde le Grand, Bob Sinclar, Roger Sanchez and Jazzy Jeff. Music genres range from nu disco to house, and dance hip-hop to afro-Latin.\n\nMarina Barrage attracts couples and families all year round thanks to its breathtaking 360-degree view of the bay area. Bring your own kite to sail in the bay’s gusty winds or pick one up from among the cavalcade of colourful creations in the kite shop on the grounds. Besides flying kites, the park is a popular venue for yoga, jogging and kayaking – and also an ace spot to have a picnic.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAn offshoot of the famous Red Dot Museum in Germany, the largest exhibition of contemporary design in the world, this local version displays the latest in product and communication design made by winners of the prestigious Red Dot product design awards.\n\nMarina Bay's giant, 42-storey, 165m observation wheel continues to pull a mix of tourists and locals who come for the breathtaking, 360-degree views of the city available from one of 28 air-conditioned, UV-protected capsules. Each flight lasts 30 minutes and on a clear day, the panorama from the top of the wheel stretches into neighbouring Malaysia and Indonesia. Dining and cocktail packages are also available if you're planning to make it more memorable."
