        "text": "One thing that surprises people about the city is the atmosphere and life that abounds beneath the city. Some stations are enormous and have shops, restaurants, and more!\n\nUnlike in many other cities, having a shop in the metro station is a great location!\n\nLines\n\nThe MRT has five lines\n\nNS (North-South Line, Red): from Marina Bay to Jurong East.\n\nEW (East-West Line, Green) goes from the Changi Airport to Tuas Link. It takes 27 mins from the airport to the center.\n\nNE (North-East Line, Brown): Connects HarbourFront (the stop if you want to go to Sentosa) and Punggol.\n\nCC (Circle Line, Yellow): Connects HarbourFront and Marina Bay.\n\nDTL (Downtown Line, Blue): Connects Bukit Panjang in the northeast and Expo to the east.\n\nNo Durians Please\n\nSomething that's sure to surprise you is the restrictions on the MRT. On the metro, you can't smoke, eat, drink, or bring on board flammable substances or (the cherry on the cake) durian fruit.\n\nThese are local fruits which, although tasty, smell terrible! And as well as on the metro, they're banned from hotels.\n\nSchedule\n\nThe metro runs from 5:30 am to 12:30 am. The frequency varies from 2 to 8 minutes depending on the line and the time of day.\n\nPrice\n\nThe price of the Singapore MRT depends on the distance traveled. It varies between 1.50 SGD (€ 1) and 2.50 SGD (€ 1.70) per journey."
