        "text": "The Marina Barrage, located at the end of Marina Bay in Singapore, is a dam that opened in 2008. It plays a crucial role in water storage and flood control for the city.\n\nBeyond its essential functions, the Marina Barrage is also a favorite recreational spot for both locals and tourists. It's a popular place to gather with friends and family for picnics, enjoying the fresh air and stunning views.\n\nWe recently tried picnicking there ourselves and found the combination of fresh air and beautiful scenery perfect for a relaxing afternoon.\n\nIf you’re planning to visit Marina Barrage, here’s a quick guide on how to get there using public transportation. You have two options: the MRT or the bus.\n\n1. By MRT\n\nTo get to Marina Barrage, the easiest way is by MRT. The nearest station is \"Gardens by the Bay,\" just a short walk away.\n\nGardens by the Bay station is on the Thomson East Coast Line (TEL), marked by a brown line code. It's one of the newest lines in Singapore's MRT network. Here's how to get there:\n\nTake the Thomson-East Coast Line to Gardens by the Bay station.\n\nExit via Exit 1.\n\nFrom the exit, walk to the right toward Marina Barrage.\n\nThe exit at Gardens by the Bay station is beautifully decorated with nature-themed ornaments, similar to those at the Bayfront station nearby.\n\nOnce you exit the station, you'll see Marina Barrage on your right. It's only a few minutes' walk.\n\nAlternatively, you can get off at Bayfront MRT station on the Downtown Line and Circle Line. However, this station is a bit farther from Marina Barrage and is better for those who want to explore the Gardens by the Bay area first.\n\n2. By Bus\n\nBesides the MRT, you can also take a bus to Marina Barrage. The only bus that goes there is number 400. You can hop on this bus and get off at the Gardens by the Bay Station Exit 1 stop (stop number 03369).\n\nThis bus stop is right in front of the main entrance of Marina Barrage, so you can just walk straight there once you get off the bus.\n\nBus 400 is the only bus serving the Gardens by the Bay area. Besides taking you to Marina Barrage, it can also take you to other spots within Gardens by the Bay.\n\nBus 400 stops at several key locations in Singapore, including:\n\nShenton Way Ter\n\nShenton Way Stn Exit 3\n\nTanjong Pagar Stn Exit C\n\nOpp Downtown Stn\n\nThese are two easy ways to get to Marina Barrage. Once you're there, you can enjoy many fun activities like picnicking, kite flying, cycling, jogging, and even fishing.\n\nAll these activities are free since there's no entrance fee for Marina Barrage. So, are you interested in visiting Marina Barrage?"
