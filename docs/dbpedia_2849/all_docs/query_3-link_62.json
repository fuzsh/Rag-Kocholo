        "text": "Client Brief\n\nThe new Marina Bay MRT Station serves as an Interchange station to connect the North-South Line with the new Circle Line. Currently located on open land adjacent to Marina Bay Station Road and the East Coast Parkway the station will eventually be integrated into a new central park as part of the new Marina Bay Central Business District Development.\n\nThe design brief required the station to integrate successfully and seamlessly with the existing NSL station and the proposed Station Park, with provisions for connections into the future adjacent sales sites and the Underground Pedestrian Network. The architectural language of the station was required to provide a strong identity and establish the station as a unique and recognisable facility within the new CBD without compromising the required urban view corridor through the station entrance and park.\n\nStation Design\n\nTo minimize the visual impact of the station on the surrounding park landscape, all ventilation openings within the immediate vicinity of the station entrance have been maintained below eye level. All emergency exits and BOH access have been arranged along a sunken pathway, so that only the lift, the entrance glazed enclosure and the lightweight ETFE canopy are visible at street level, allowing full views through the station entrance into the park.\n\nThe translucent ETFE canopy acts as a skylight, allowing natural light to filter through the large openings and penetrate right into the underground station hall and affording views from the hall below up to the sky.\n\nWater features in the form of reflective pools have been introduced to provide a calming transition area between the station entrances and the park. At the same time the pools frame the open large voids and skylights as a safety barrier which help to maintain the station character as a light, welcoming structure."
