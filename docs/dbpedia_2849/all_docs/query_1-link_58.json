        "text": "Marina Bay MRT Station (NS27/CE2) is an underground Mass Rapid Transit interchange station on the North South Line and Circle Line in Downtown Core, Singapore. The station is designed by Aedas. It was the southern terminus of the North South Line until late November 2014. However, most trains terminate at Marina Bay instead of Marina South Pier possibly due to the low passenger demand at Marina South Pier. Passengers who are going to Marina South Pier should observe the television screens on the station platforms and listen to announcements which will notify commuters when a train that is terminating at Marina South Pier arrives. Circle Line trains that begin from here terminate at Harbourfront MRT station, with a few trains terminating at Stadium during peak hours. However, during off peak hours, usually all trains departing here terminate at Stadium. Next time it will become 3-line interchange, with a greater demand taking place on Circle Line & Thomson-East Coast Line.\n\nMarina Bay has secluded demand. Nobody goes there unless it has another term Marina Bay Sands.\n\nImages for kids"
