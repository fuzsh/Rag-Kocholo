        "text": "I picked up a set of Tourism Promotion Board publication series of various Singapore “Heritage trails” and I was found reading the “Toa Payoh heritage trail” when some one asked me randomly, “Why is Toa Payoh named Toa Payoh?”\n\nHence begin this entry. For a “Quick, I want to know, tell me now” on the etymolomy behind these stations in Singapore, you may find your answers here.\n\nFor a detailed map of the mrt stations, please see LTA MRT System map\n\nToa Payoh – “Toa” means “Big” in Hokkien and “Payoh” is borrowed from the word “paya” in Malay which means “Swamp” – which is what Toa Payoh used to be, a huge swamp.\n\nYishun – The word Yishun is derived from the same sounding words “Nee Soon“. Lim Nee Soon (1879 – 1936) , a Peranakan was a rubber & pineapple planter and a merchant. He started a plantation and owns the processing factory. Lim plays an important role to the rubber plantations in Yishun and his rubber business was a booming success.\n\nDhoby Ghaut or “Dhobi Ghat” literally means washerman’s place in Hindi, from “dhobi – washerman or one that does laundry”. “Ghat” refers to a series of steps leading down to a body of water. The Hindi terms passed to English usage during the British colonial days and anglicised as “Ghaut”. Until the early 1900s, the dhobis used water from a clear stream that flowed into Sungei Bras Basah (Bras Basah means “Wet Rice” in Malay but is this sungei is now Stamford Canal) for their laundry business.\n\nSerangoon – The name seems to be derived from the word “Ranggoon” which is the Malay name of a bird of the stork species – also known as the small marsh bird. Others suggest that the name was derived from the Malay phrase “di-serang dengan gong”, meaning “to attack with gongs or drums”, a possible reference to these instruments used to scare away animals from the forested area in Serangoon.\n\n“Kallang” is an old Malay reference to the orang laut (people of the sea), called “orang biduanda kallang”, who lived in the vicinity of the Kallang River and Singapore River. There are other possible meanings too. Kallang may also be derived from the Malay word “kilang”, meaning “mill” or “factory” – which were aplenty here.\n\nLavender – The place where this street used to be was a garden planted with chinese vegetables. As night soil and dung was used as natural and cheap fertiliser, the smell from these gardens were terrible. When the Municipals (back in 1858) wanted to name this place, Lavender was chosen as sarcasm, put forth as a suggestion and later formalised (much to many’s surprise).\n\nBedok – Bedok is derived from the Malay word for “drum”, which is spelt bedoh with the “h” pronounced like “k”. The drum was used in olden days at the mosque to sound out to Muslims that it is prayers time. It is also used when there is a need to convey to nearby villagers important announcements or messages. Bedok may also refer to the small fishing boats found along the coastline and it is called “biduk”, in Malay.\n\nSomerset – Somerset road is just above the station. Along with nearby roads such as Exeter, Oxley, Killiney and Devonshire, they were named after English cities and suburbs (Don’t forget we were once governed by the British). Somerset is a country in South West England.\n\nPaya Lebar – In Malay, “Paya” means swamp, “Lebar” means wide. Paya Lebar near Kallang used to be a swampy area and hence derived the name. It was also an extensive and notorious squatter farming area rearing pigs and poultry.\n\nTanjong Pagar – “Tanjong” means cape and “Pagar” means fence. As shipping activities here grew back in 1850s, wharves were built and the words would mean the “enclosed space” – wharf where ships are moored.\n\nNote: As you can see, the names were derived from a mix of English, Hokkien (a dialect), Hindi, Malay words, that also attests to the fact that our country and its people has always accepted its mixed ethnicity, race, language, religion, heritage and culture even a long time ago.\n\nMost streets and station names are also named after pioneers and early settlers who helped built or were important contributors to the development of Singapore in the early days. Examples include:\n\nNewton were named after in 1914 after assistant municipal engineer Howard Newton(1877–1896)\n\nBoon Keng were named after Lim Boon Keng, a Chinese physician who came to Singapore in 1880s and contributed on promoting social and educational reforms for the local society since 1890s.\n\nNicoll highway mrt station is named as well as the Nicoll Highway after Governor John Fearns Nicoll (1952–55)\n\nbut that is probably another blog for another day.\n\nFor a comprehensive guide to Singapore Street names, you can check out the book – “Singapore Street Names: A study of Toponymics” By Victor R Savage, Brenda Yeoh"
