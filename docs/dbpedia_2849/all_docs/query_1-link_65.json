Crafted to look like it is from a single block of plasticine, the sculpture preserves subtle imprints from its packaging. Delicate traces are left by the artist’s fingertips and her childhood memory of creating plasticine sculptures with her sisters during school vacations.\n\nAmidst the perpetual rhythm of the cityscape, the artwork offers a moment of tactile reflection and a nod to the shared pilgrimage of city dwellers.\n\nThe sculpture thus emerges not merely as a static creation but as a dynamic narrative that serves as a symbol of life’s journey, paying tribute to the people who have walked through life and contributed to the tapestry of Marine Parade’s rich history.\n\nStation Amenities\n\nPublic Toilets at station concourse (B1)\n\nRetail Shop provisions\n\nSimplyGo Ticketing Service Centre\n\nExits\n\nMarine Parade MRT station has six exits leading to street level, with an additional access to the underground bicycle parking facility via dedicated lifts near Exit 2.
