A lightweight, translucent ETFE canopy floats like cloud cover over the station entrance, integrating into the park amenity.\n\nThe building’s canopy allows natural light and ventilation to flood the underground concourse while providing shelter. The station design is commendable for approaching design towards sustainability, and creating comfort and good experience for commuters in our public transport infrastructure.\n\nSingapore MRT, Circle Line Station Building image / information from Singapore Institute of Architects (SIA)\n\nSingapore Institute of Architects Architectural Design Awards\n\nLocation: Singapore, Southeast Asia\n\nSingapore Architecture\n\nContemporary Singapore Architectural Projects\n\nSingapore Architectural Designs – chronological list\n\nArchitecture Tours in Singapore – city walks by e-architect\n\nSingapore Architects Offices – architects studio contact details on e-architect\n\nSingapore Houses – selection of the most interesting contemporary properties in this country\n\nSingapore Architecture\n\nMetro Station Buildings\n\nSingapore Building Designs\n\nAedas Singapore Office Interior Design\n\nArchitects: Aedas\n\nimage courtesy of architects office\n\nAedas Singapore Offices Interior Design\n\nJust off a busy thoroughfare in Singapore’s science and technology hub, Buona Vista lies a busy business hub.
