        "text": "Taking inspiration from this tale, the Merlion was originally designed in 1964 by Alec Frederick Fraser-Brunner, a British ichthyologist, to be used as a logo for the Singapore Tourism Board. Mr. Brunner was an esteemed member of the Souvenir Committee and served as a curator of the Van Kleef Aquarium. He added a fish tail to his design as an ode to the country’s humble beginnings as a fishing village. Though the Singapore Tourism Board adopted a new logo in 1997, the Merlion remains an iconic symbol of Singapore to this day.\n\nAs of February 2023, there are six Singapore Tourism Board-approved Merlion statues in Singapore. The Merlion Park, spotted near Marina Bay Sands is home to the original Merlion statue, with a smaller Merlion statue measuring 2-metre tall located near it.\n\nOther Merlion statues can be found at the Tourism Court (near Grange Road), Mount Faber's Faber Point, and another pair at the entrance of the car park along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1.\n\nThe Merlion has a significant connection with the principles of Feng Shui. Believed to usher in tremendous success, the Merlion status at the Merlion Park is carefully oriented to face the East, an auspicious direction.\n\nThe unending water gushing from the Merlion symbolises a continuous flow of prosperity, a notion influenced by both traditional superstitions and specific principles of Feng Shui.\n\nThere are many ways to reach the Merlion, but we recommend a cruise down the Singapore River to the jetty closest to the statue.\n\nThe Singapore River Cruise is a 40-minute ride on a rustic bumboat that meanders through the stunning districts of Clarke Quay, Boat Quay, and Marina Bay. Besides the Merlion statue, tourists can view some of Singapore’s iconic landmarks such as Marina Bay Sands, ArtScience Museum, Sir Stamford Raffles Statue, the Esplanade and more. Passengers can alight or hop-on at Clarke Quay Jetty along the river and continue their journey on foot.\n\nExperience the magic of Singapore's iconic light show from a unique vantage point at Merlion Park. As dusk falls, the city's skyline transforms into a vibrant tapestry of lights, with the mesmerising spectacle reflecting off the waters of Marina Bay. From the park, you'll have an unobstructed view of the famous Spectra – A Light & Water Show, which combines lasers, fountains, and visual projections to create a captivating performance. This unforgettable display of light, sound, and water movement is not to be missed during your visit to Merlion Park.\n\nExplore alternative places to catch this light show.\n\nA fantastic way to get the most out of your trip to Merlion Park is to walk or cycle around the Marina Bay waterfront promenade.\n\nEmbark on a picturesque 3.5-km jogging route in Singapore that not only offers breathtaking views but also traverses some of the city's most Instagrammable spots. Admire the world's only floating Apple store, Helix Bridge, ArtScience Museum, Singapore Flyer and the iconic Marina Bay Sands. If you are up for a challenge, add Gardens by the Bay to your cycling route for a more satisfying biking trip.\n\nLAVO is an award-winning restaurant that offers authentic Italian-American cuisine. Savour their signature dishes such as the Charred Octopus and the famed LAVO Meatball, made with fresh Imperial Wagyu Beef, Italian sausage, and whipped ricotta cheese. Polish off your meal with their delectable 20-Layer Chocolate Cake, and sip on their handcrafted cocktails at the sprawling outdoor bar and terrace with spectacular views of the city skyline.\n\nLAVO is located at L57, Hotel Tower 1, Marina Bay Sands.\n\nAs far as the rooftop restaurants in Singapore go, Spago Bar & Lounge in Marina Bay Sands is in the clouds. Owned by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck, Spago’s speciality is Californian cuisine with a modern twist. Lavish your palate with Spago’s careful mix of flavours and signature light bites like the Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones, or must-haves such as the Miso Broiled Ora King Salmon and the Chicken ‘Laksa’ Spring Roll.\n\nSpago is located at L57, Sands SkyPark, Hotel Tower 2.\n\nBread Street Kitchen by Michelin-starred chef Gordon Ramsay offers a contemporary rendition of traditional British cuisine. Dishes worth trying are the creamy Buttermilk Pancakes and the all-time classic English Breakfast, comprising eggs, bacon, sausage, and mushrooms. For a healthier breakfast, opt for the Avocado on Toast or the Eggs Benedict. Cleanse your palate with their fruity smoothies, cold-pressed juices, or signature cocktails. Unwind along Marina Bay with a view of the Merlion at these waterfront bars in Singapore.\n\nBread Street Kitchen is located at L1-81, The Shoppes.\n\nYardbird Southern Table & Bar is the place for American comfort food made with farm-fresh ingredients and traditional Southern flavours. Try their legendary Chicken ‘n’ Watermelon ‘n’ Waffles at this western restaurant for the perfect combination of sweet and savoury. Seafood lovers will enjoy the tasty Crab Cake Benedict, or the Lobster Mac & Cheese. End the night at their Instagram-worthy alfresco bar with a sip of their handcrafted cocktails, such as the Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade and Watermelon Sling.\n\nYardbird Southern Table & Bar is located at B1-07, The Shoppes."
