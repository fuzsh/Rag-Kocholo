        "text": "The R&F Princess Cove encapsulates the HOPSCA Marina Living Concept â a first in South East Asia. It aims to provide an epitome of modern living, combining first-class residential properties, high-end business platform and premium recreational environment. As South East Asiaâs first HOPSCA (Hotels, Offices, Parks, Shopping Malls, Clubhouses and Apartments), you can live, work, play and shop in this city within a city. Lifestyle and Entertainment at Your Doorstepï¼Be spoilt for choice with a plethora of shopping, entertainment and dining establishments within Princess Coveâs integrated development. Enjoy modern living with luxurious facilities like garden clubhouse, greenery square, sea view ox bar, etc. all within your reach. Prominent Education Hubï¼Located near major clusters of prominent educational institutions like Foon Yew Primary & Secondary School as well as Edu-City in Nusajaya, your childâs educational path is well taken care of. Transport Hub of Tomorrowï¼R&F Princess Cove is a privileged address in the heart of the Johor state. A mere 2-minute drive to Johor CIQ via car and 10-minute walk to the planned future Rapid Transit System(RTS) Link to Singapore. The Rapid Transit System(RTS) will be completed before Dec 31, 2024. The link can carry up to 10,000 passengers per hour in each direction. This means 60,000 additional commuters will be able to cross the Causeway during peak hours. Currently, an average of 300 passengers travel in each direction per hour using the daily shuttle train service between Woodlands and Johor Bahru. The bilateral agreement on Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System(RTS) was signed on Tuesday (16th Jan 2016) by Singapore Transport Minister and Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure Khaw Boon Wan and Malaysia's Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Abdul Rahman Dahlan. which is scheduled to begin construction in 2019 and completed for operation by end-2024. After 9th May 2018 General election, the New Transport Minister Anthony Loke said that the new government had \"agreed in principle\" to the Rapid Transit System (RTS) project linking from Bukit Chagar MRT Station, Johor Baharu to Woodland North MRT Station, Singapore via Thomson MRT Line which can travel directly until to Marina Bay MRT Station.\n\n7 things to know about the upcoming Johor Baru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link\n\n1. THERE WILL BE A TRAIN EVERY 8 MINUTES\n\nWhen it is ready by Dec 31, 2024, commuters can hop on a train every eight minutes on average. Trains will eventually arrive every four minutes on average during peak periods. The line will start with five trains, and gradually have a total fleet of seven trains. The link can carry up to 10,000 passengers per hour in each direction. This means 60,000 additional commuters will be able to cross the Causeway during peak hours. Currently, an average of 300 passengers travel in each direction per hour using the daily shuttle train service between Woodlands and Johor Baru.\n\n2. START YOUR JOURNEY AT WOODLANDS NORTH\n\nThe line will link Bukit Chagar station in Johor Baru, near Sentral train station, to the Singapore terminus in Woodlands North, where commuters can transfer to the upcoming Thomson-East Coast MRT Line (TEL). The TEL is expected to open in phases from 2019 to 2024, and will comprise 31 stations stretching from Woodlands in the North to Sungei Bedok.\n\n3. PASSENGERS NEED TO CLEAR CUSTOMS ONLY ONCE\n\nThe link will have a joint customs, immigration and quarantine facility at both terminus stations. Passengers who are crossing the border will need to clear customs and immigration only when they depart from either Singapore or Malaysia.\n\n4. THE 4KM LINK WILL CROSS THE STRAITS OF JOHOR VIA A 25M-HIGH BRIDGE\n\nThe tracks will cross the Strait of Johor in a straight line rather than curving over water, taking into account the Johor Sultan's earlier reservations about the project. It will make a bend over land in Malaysia instead.\n\n5. FARES WILL BE SET BY JOINT VENTURE COMPANY\n\nFares will be set by the joint venture company between SMRT and Prasarana Malaysia. It will not be regulated by the two governments.\n\n6. THE END OF KTM SHUTTLE TRAIN\n\nWithin six months after the link starts operations, the Keretapi Tanah Melayu Tebrau (KTM) Shuttle will cease. The KTM train service has been running 26 daily trips since June 1 last year to cope with higher demand.\n\n7. POSSIBLE REDEVELOPMENT OF WOODLANDS CHECKPOINT\n\nLast August, Mr Khaw said the opening of the link will allow the Woodlands Checkpoint to be redeveloped, after the train shuttle service ends and land is freed up. \"Then, hopefully, this problem of the Causeway jam can be significantly mitigated or even eliminated,\" he had said.\n\nâ æ ¸å¿å°æ®µ â\n\n1056ç±³ å«å°ºæ°å å¡ å¯åå ¬ä¸»æ¹¾ä½äºæ°å å¡å¯¹å²¸ãè¿æ¥âæ°å±±-æ°å å¡âçæ°æé¿å ¤æï¼è·ç¦»æ°å å¡ä» 1056ç±³ãå¯åå ¬ä¸»æ¹¾å°å¤æ°é©¬ä¾æ¯å¹²è¾¾ç»æµç¹åºAåºä¸­å¤®åå¡åºãæ¼å®æ°é©¬å¾æ¥å½åè¦éââæ°æé¿å ¤ï¼æ¥äº«æ°é©¬åå±å°å©ä¼å¿ãåéå³å¯å°è¾¾æ°é©¬ç¬¬ä¸å ³å£ï¼ç¬é´éå ³ç æ¸¸æ°é©¬ã æ°å±±å°éä¸çå°éç´æ¥éå ³â1ç«æµè¾¾æ°å å¡ æ°é©¬ç¬¬ä¸ééæ°æé¿å ¤ï¼æ°å å¡å å °âæ°å±±ï¼å å °å ³å¡è¿ä¸æ­¥æ©å»ºï¼æ°é©¬éå ³è¿ç¨å°å ¨é¢æéãåæ¶ï¼æ°å å¡å°å¨å å °å°åºåå±å ¨æ°æ¦å¿µå¸éï¼æé åæµ·å²¸åæ°èµ°å»ãå¯åå ¬ä¸»æ¹¾ä¸æ°å å¡å å °ä» ä¸æ¡¥ï¼æ°æé¿å ¤ï¼ä¹éï¼è·ç¦»ä» 1056ç±³ï¼è¿äº«æ°å å¡å å °åå ¨æ°åå±ææã ç«ä½äº¤éä¾¿æ·åºè¡ä¸ä¸­å½4å°æ¶ç´èªæºç¨ 7å°æ¶ç«è½¦ç´è¾¾ ä»å¯åå ¬ä¸»æ¹¾åºåï¼30åéç´è¾¾æ°å±±å£«ä¹æºåºåæ°å å¡æ¨å®æºåºï¼4å°æ¶ç´èªå°å¹¿å·ãæ·±å³ï¼3-7å°æ¶å³å¯éè¾¾å ¨äºæ´²ã æªæ¥æ³äºéè·¯å¼éåï¼å¨ææä¹åç«è½¦ï¼7å°æ¶å³å¯å°è¾¾é©¬æ¥è¥¿äºï¼è½»æ¾å¼å¯æ æ¶å·®å½é çæ´»åã åæ¥æ°é©¬ååç¹ååå è½»æ¾æ¿æ´»1å°æ¶æ°é©¬ç»æµçæ´»åãç´§é»æ°å±±ä¸»å¹²éï¼å¯å¿«éå°è¾¾æ°å±±ä¸»è¦åéååå¤§ç¹åååã"
