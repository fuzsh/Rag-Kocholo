        "text": "SINGAPORE: All areas in Marina Bay have reopened to the public and train services at Bayfront MRT station have resumed following a temporary disruption due to large crowds at the New Year countdown on Sunday (Dec 31).\n\nAccess to a total of nine locations in the vicinity were earlier closed by the police for safety reasons, but the Singapore Police Force said in an update at about 1.15am on Monday that the crowd situation in the waterfront areas around the Marina Bay has since eased.\n\nTrain services resumed at Bayfront MRT station just before midnight, less than half an hour after police said trains would not be stopping there due to the large crowds.\n\nThe police had said earlier this week that trains may skip affected stations if there is overcrowding at the event.\n\nAccess to Merlion Park, One Fullerton, Jubilee Bridge and Youth Olympic Park were first closed in an announcement by police on Facebook at about 10pm. The list later grew to also include Promontory Waterfront, Esplanade Waterfront, Fullerton Waterfront, MBS Waterfront and The Lawn.\n\nThose heading to the vicinity were encouraged to check the crowd situation online using the Crowd@MarinaBay platform before heading down for the festivities. The platform also provided information on available transport nodes nearby.\n\nTo prevent overcrowding, police officers and auxiliary police officers regulated the number of people entering The Promontory, One Fullerton/Merlion Park, Esplanade Park, Esplanade Waterfront Promenade, Marina Bay Sands Waterfront Promenade, as well as other areas within the vicinity of Marina Bay.\n\n“When the capacities of these areas reach the planned safety thresholds, these areas will be closed to ensure the safety of members of the public,” the police said earlier this week.\n\nCROWD CONTROL AT MRT STATIONS\n\nCertain entrances and exits of MRT stations around Marina Bay were closed to regulate crowd flow.\n\nAfter the countdown event, there were designated routes out of the Marina Bay area.\n\nPeople may be directed to another MRT station to avoid overcrowding at certain stations, police said.\n\n“We seek your understanding to head to these less-crowded MRT stations and use the inter-connected MRT networks to get to your intended destination,” the police added.\n\n“Members of the public are advised to be patient and cooperate with security personnel.”\n\nSECURITY CHECKS, ROAD CLOSURES\n\nAhead of the event, police said bag checks may be conducted by security personnel.\n\nThey also advised revellers to stay close to their friends, avoid carrying large amounts of cash or wear excessive jewellery and avoid contact with unruly crowds.\n\nPeople should also ensure their bag is closed at all times and slung in front of them. Wallets should not be put in their back pockets.\n\nAs several roads were closed to vehicular traffic, members of the public were advised to take public transport to the Marina Bay area.\n\n“Parking at peripheral roads and stopping of vehicles along ECP (Benjamin Sheares Bridge) to watch the fireworks are strictly prohibited,” the police said.\n\nOver in the heartlands, there were also fireworks at seven locations to usher in 2024."
