        "text": "SINGAPORE â€“ Some exits of MRT stations around Marina Bay will be closed on Aug 3 for crowd control, in view of the National Day Parade (NDP) Preview 2 at the Padang.\n\nTrains may also bypass MRT stations near overcrowded areas, such as Bayfront station, to divert people away, the police said on Aug 1.\n\nAs some MRT stations, including Bayfront, City Hall and Raffles Place, are expected to be very crowded, the police urged people to use other stations such as Esplanade, Promenade, Downtown and Marina Bay.\n\nThey advised the public to be patient and listen to the marshals and officers on duty throughout the day, as well as to look after their belongings.\n\nAlso, a number of roads and lanes will be closed to vehicles because of the preview, said the police.\n\nOnly authorised vehicles, as well as police and emergency vehicles, can access these roads during the closures.\n\nPolice officers, auxiliary police officers, security officers and marshals will be at the affected junctions to assist and direct motorists.\n\nTraffic delays are expected along Battery Road, Beach Road, Bras Basah Road, Collyer Quay, Guillemard Road, Hill Street, Marina Boulevard, Mountbatten Road, North Bridge Road, Ophir Road, Raffles Avenue, Raffles Boulevard, Raffles Link, Republic Boulevard, Rochor Road, Temasek Avenue, Temasek Boulevard and Victoria Street.\n\nMotorists travelling to Suntec City and Marina Square must go via Bayfront Avenue or Rochor Road leading to Temasek Boulevard.\n\nThe police advised motorists to plan their routes early and avoid these roads, or to use public transport to get to the affected areas.\n\nParking restrictions on the closed roads will be strictly enforced, and vehicles found parking illegally or causing obstruction will be towed away, the police said.\n\nThe police also advised those attending the NDP preview to arrive early, to allow enough time for security checks.\n\nThe attendees are also encouraged to minimise the personal belongings they are taking into the venue, to facilitate security clearance.\n\nThe police said that any container holding more than 100ml of liquid, aerosol or gel will be subjected to additional checks.\n\nCanned items, including drinks, will not be allowed into the venue. Each ticket holder will receive an NDP pack, which includes items such as water and light snacks.\n\nPolice officers and auxiliary police officers will also regulate crowd flow at areas in Marina Bay such as the Esplanade waterfront, One Fullerton waterfront, Merlion Park and the Marina Bay Sands waterfront.\n\nThose intending to visit Marina Bay can use the Crowd@MarinaBay map online to view real-time crowd levels and areas which may be closed at the various firework viewing spots.\n\nAvailable on computers and mobile devices on Aug 3 from 1.30pm to 10pm, the map will also be displayed on television screens at selected MRT stations.\n\nThe map will include available surface and underground walking paths around Marina Bay, which the public can use to avoid crowded areas.\n\nLarge crowds are expected around the Padang and in the Marina Bay vicinity after the rehearsal, the police said, with the City Hall, Raffles Place and Bayfront MRT stations anticipated to be very crowded during this time.\n\nThe public should use other stations, such as Esplanade, Promenade, Downtown and Marina Bay stations, after the show, the police added.\n\nFor further inquiries, the public may contact the NDP organiser on 1800-637-2024."
