        "text": "SINGAPORE: The last 2024 National Day Parade (NDP) Preview will be held at the Padang on Saturday (Aug 3), with large crowds expected at Marina Bay and road closures planned for the event.\n\nTo prevent overcrowding, officers will be regulating the flow of the crowd at areas in the Marina Bay such as the Esplanade Waterfront, One Fullerton Waterfront, Merlion Park and Marina Bay Sands Waterfront, said the Singapore Police Force (SPF) on Thursday.\n\nMembers of the public intending to visit Marina Bay should also use the Crowd@MarinaBay map to navigate and avoid crowded areas.\n\nThe crowd-tracking map, which was used for other big events such as the 2024 Marina Bay Singapore Countdown, can be used to view real-time crowd levels and areas which may be closed at the various fireworks viewing spots.\n\nIt also includes available surface and underground walking paths in the area.\n\nThe public can access the Crowd@MarinaBay map via their computers and mobile devices on Saturday from 1.30pm to 10pm, police said.\n\nFurthermore, certain entrances and exits of MRT stations around Marina Bay will be closed to regulate crowd flow. Should there be overcrowding, trains may bypass affected stations to divert people away.\n\nAs MRT stations including Bayfront, City Hall and Raffles Place are expected to be very crowded, members of the public are encouraged to use other nearby MRT stations such as Esplanade, Promenade, Downtown and Marina Bay.\n\nThose attending the NDP Preview are advised to arrive early to allow ample time for security checks, and minimise the personal belongings brought into the venue to facilitate security clearance.\n\nPolice also warned of road closures, which will affect traffic in the area.\n\nTraffic delays are expected along Battery Road, Beach Road, Bras Basah Road, Collyer Quay, Guillemard Road, Hill Street, Marina Boulevard, Mountbatten Road, North Bridge Road, Ophir Road, Raffles Avenue, Raffles Boulevard, Raffles Link, Republic Boulevard, Rochor Road, Temasek Avenue, Temasek Boulevard and Victoria Street.\n\n“Motorists are advised to plan their routes early and avoid these roads,” police said. “Members of the public travelling to these affected areas are strongly encouraged to use public transport.”\n\nSimilarly, motorists heading to Suntec City and Marina Square from Bras Basah Road, Esplanade Drive, Nicoll Highway or Raffles Boulevard would need to use alternative routes via Bayfront Avenue or Rochor Road leading to Temasek Boulevard.\n\n“Parking restrictions along the affected roads will be strictly enforced. Vehicles found parked illegally or causing obstruction will be towed,” police said.\n\nFollowing the NDP Preview, City Hall MRT station, Raffles Place MRT station and Bayfront MRT station are expected to very crowded as people disperse.\n\nAs such, members of the public are advised to use alternative stations such as Esplanade MRT station, Promenade MRT station, Downtown MRT station and Marina Bay MRT station, police said."
