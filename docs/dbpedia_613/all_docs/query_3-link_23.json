In 1998, Brookings released a report that explained how Black people — especially Black Americans — consistently score lower than white Americans on standardized IQ tests. While the gap has narrowed since 1970, “the typical American black still scores below 75 percent of American whites on almost every standardized test. This statistic does not imply, of course, that all blacks score below all whites. There is a lot of overlap between the two groups.

While the gap has narrowed since 1970, “the typical American black still scores below 75 percent of American whites on almost every standardized test. This statistic does not imply, of course, that all blacks score below all whites. There is a lot of overlap between the two groups. Nonetheless, the test score gap is large enough to have significant social and economic consequences.”\n\nSo, when someone is certified as having a “high IQ,” it’s a good thing. But it’s even better if that “someone” is a Black man or woman, especially — according to Forbes — when a perceived low IQ is used by racists to claim the “innately lower intelligence” of Black people.\n\nThese Black men and women, however, have proven that they not only have a high IQ, but their IQs are — in some cases — higher than that of Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein. Today, we salute these shining examples of Black excellence. More of this, please!\n\nKashe Quest\n\nIQ: 146\n\nKashe Quest became a certified genius at just two-years-old. As AfroTech previously reported, Quest can identify all 50 states by shape and position on a map. She is learning to read, can sign over 50 signs in ASL, and can identify elements on the periodic table by their symbols. She is even learning Spanish, as a second language.\n\nAfter an IQ test, it was determined that the precocious two-year-old has an IQ of 146, well above the genius level — making her qualified to become a member of American Mensa, a prominent high IQ society.\n\nBernadette Giacomazzo\n\nBernadette Giacomazzo is the SEO Manager at Blavity, Inc.
