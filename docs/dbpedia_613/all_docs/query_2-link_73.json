        "text": "An ingenious invention that effectively made the internet and other modern IT technologies possible, the linked supercomputer system is the brainchild of Nigerian-born computer scientist Philip Emeagwali, who in 1989 came up with the idea of linking multiple microprocessors to turbo-charge computing power after observing bees in nature.\n\nPhilip Emeagwali (born 23 August 1954) is a computer scientist originally from Nigeria. He won the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for price-performance in high-performance computing applications, in an oil reservoir modeling calculation using a novel mathematical formulation and implementation. He is known for making controversial claims about his achievements that are disputed by the scientific community.\n\nPhilip Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954. He was raised in Onitsha in the Southeastern part of Nigeria. His early schooling was suspended in 1967 as a result of the Nigerian Civil War. At age 13, he worked in the Biafran army. After the war he completed high-school equivalence through self-study.\n\nLater on, he married Dale Brown Emeagwali, an African American microbiologist. He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship following completion of a course at the University of London. He received a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Oregon State University in 1977.\n\nHe later moved to Washington D.C., receiving in 1986 a master’s degree from George Washington University in ocean and marine engineering, and a second master’s in applied mathematics from the University of Maryland. Next magazine suggested that Emeagwali claimed to have further degrees. During this time, he worked as a civil engineer at the Bureau of Land Reclamation in Wyoming.\n\nEmeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991. His thesis was not accepted by a committee of internal and external examiners and thus he was not awarded the degree. Emeagwali filed a court challenge, stating that the decision was a violation of his civil rights and that the university had discriminated against him in several ways because of his race. The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan state Court of Appeals.\n\nEmeagwali received the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for an application of the CM-2 massively parallel computer. The application used computational fluid dynamics for oil-reservoir modeling. He received a prize in “price/performance” category, with a performance figure of about 400 Mflops/$1M. [citation needed]\n\nThe winner in the “performance” category was also the winner of the Price/performance category, but unable to receive two prizes: Mobil Research and Thinking Machines used the CM-2 for seismic data processing and achieved the higher ratio of 500 Mflops/$1M. The judges decided on one award per entry. [citation needed] His method involved each microprocessor communicating with six neighbors.\n\nEmeagwali’s simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time approach to reservoir modeling. He was cited by Bill Clinton as an example of what Nigerians can achieve when given the opportunity and is frequently featured in popular press articles for Black History Month.\n\nEmeagwali has made several controversial claims about his achievements that are disputed by the scientific community. His claim of being a father of the Internet, of having invented the Connection Machine, of possessing 41 patented inventions of winning “the Nobel Prize of Computing” and of being a “doctor” and/or “professor” have been conclusively debunked with widely documented evidence.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to Switzerland in April 2009, Mr. Emeagwali said he was the first to program a hypercube “to solve a grand challenge defined as the 20 gold-ring problems in computing. That discovery, in part, inspired the reinvention of supercomputers as an Internet.” He claimed that by his effort, he was able to set three world records and improve on Newton’s second law of motion.\n\nAccolades\n\nPrice/performance–1989 Gordon Bell Prize, IEEE ($1,000 prize)[2][19]\n\nSelected publications\n\nEmeagwali, P.
