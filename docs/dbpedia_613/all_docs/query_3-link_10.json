        "text": "Every year, throughout February, we celebrate Black History Month in North America, and in many countries around the world. But did you ever wonder exactly how this month-long tradition began? This article will share some insights into the interesting backstory of Black History Month. Then, read on to learn more about black technology inventors and educators whose work has impacted the lives we lead today.\n\nThe History Of Black History Month\n\nThe African American historian Carter G. Woodson is credited with establishing the event that eventually evolved into Black History Month. Feeling compelled to honor the accomplishments and achievements of black Americans, he proposed what became the Negro History Week in 1926.\n\nHere are a few interesting facts:\n\nThe first black history celebrations were in 1924 and were known as Negro History and Literature week.\n\nThe second week of February was chosen for Negro History Week to coincide with the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass.\n\nBlack History Month was officially recognized by President Gerald Ford in 1976.\n\nToday, Black History Month is celebrated in October, in countries like the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Ireland.\n\nAs a software company that supports K12 schools, we live and breathe technology development and all things education. For Black History Month, we want to help raise the visibility of unsung contributors to U.S. and world history. We are called Rise Vision, after all! ;)\n\nTo help you with your research, we’ve broken down the names, notable contributions and some helpful links for you to further your research on these amazing inventors and educators.\n\nHere are 5 black inventors and educators you may not have known:\n\nThe Real McCoy\n\nName: Elijah McCoy (1844 - 1929)\n\nNotable Contribution: Automatic lubricator for steam engines; held over 50 patents\n\nHave you ever heard the expression “the real McCoy”? Although sometimes disputed, it is believed that this expression - meaning the real thing - is attributable to Elijah McCoy. He was a Canadian-born engineer and inventor who relocated to the United States with his family in 1859. It was there that he developed and patented an automatic lubrication device that allowed trains and ships to travel farther and faster. It made transport more profitable by reducing the need to stop for oiling and maintenance. By several accounts, his oil-drip cup invention was so sought after that many tried to copy it. But savvy railroad engineers insisted on only having “the Real McCoy”.\n\nLearn More about Elijah McCoy:\n\nNational Inventors Hall of Fame Inductee\n\nBiography of Elijah McCoy, An American Inventor\n\nBlack Americans 17Th Century to 21St Century: Black Struggles and Successes\n\nCelebrate Black History Month with 10 FREE posters including Elijah McCoy\n\nand other notable black history contributors.\n\nThe Godmother of GIFs\n\nName: Lisa Gelobter (1971 - )\n\nNotable Contribution: Developed the foundation of GIF animations\n\nIt’s hard to imagine the internet we know today, without the GIFs and videos we share and enjoy on a daily basis. In spite of the hot debate around pronunciation (we go with \"hard G\" here at Rise), we have this technology innovator to thank for making our communications a little bit more fun and interesting.\n\nThe genesis of the GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) was actually in the foundational animation work of Lisa Gelobter. Her academic background as a computer scientist prepared her for a storied career where she contributed to developing popular technologies in the gaming and online video space (Shockwave; Hulu). Lisa served as Chief Digital Services Officer of the U.S. Department of Education under the Obama administration. Today, she continues in technology innovation and is the co-founder of tEQuitable - a software solution for reporting incidents of bias, that aims to make workplaces more equitable.\n\nLearn More about Lisa Gelobter:\n\nInc.com Profile - Lisa Gelobter\n\nHarvard Kennedy School - Belfer Center\n\nLinkedIn Profile\n\nThe Pioneering Principal\n\nName: Fanny Jackson Coppin (1837 - 1913)\n\nNotable Contribution: The first African American principal and superintendent\n\nBeing first sets a precedent, blazes a trail and inspires possibility for those who come after. Fanny Jackson Coppin overcame enormous challenges, escaping slavery at 12 years old and committing her life to education. In 1869, she became the first African American principal and an advocate for higher education for women. She was known for many innovations in education including a system for practice-teaching.\n\nBefore she died at the age of 76, Fanny captured details of her extraordinary life in her autobiography titled Reminiscences of School Life and Hints on Teaching. She recounts her passion for teaching and the details of her journey that led to her becoming promoted to the role of Superintendent by the board of education. This made her the first African American superintendent of a school district in the United States.\n\nLearn More about Fanny Jackson Coppin:\n\nCoppin State University - Fanny Jackson Coppin\n\nBritannica\n\nDocumenting the American South\n\nThe Father of the Internet\n\nName: Philip Emeagwali (1954 - )\n\nNotable Contribution: Invented the foundations of the modern supercomputer\n\nThis inventor is credited with inventing the world’s first supercomputer, capable of making 3.1 billion calculations per second. Born in Nigeria, Philip Emeagwali was forced to leave school at 14 years old because his family was unable to afford school fees. His father homeschooled him in mathematics and he spent his time in the local library reading and studying relentlessly. Eventually, through his diligent efforts, he earned a scholarship to Oregon State University and moved to the US in 1974.\n\nIt was during his academic career that Philip was inspired by honeycombs as a model of how computers could communicate more efficiently. His discoveries were a major breakthrough and created the fastest, most efficient computer processing at the time. His work laid the foundations for the internet as we know it today. Time Magazine called him the “unsung hero” of the internet and he has received high acclaim and recognition in the world of computer science. In 1989, he received the Gordon Bell Prize - known as the Nobel Prize for supercomputing. It's easy to see why CNN dubbed him as one of \"The Fathers of the Internet\".\n\nLearn More about Philip Emeagwali:\n\nPhilip Emeagwali - Computer Pioneer\n\nEmeagwali.com\n\nPhilip Emeagwali profile\n\nThe Grandfather of the Gas Mask\n\nName: Garret Morgan (1877 - 1963)\n\nNotable Contribution: Inventor of the first gas mask\n\nGarret Morgan is an African American inventor best known for his contributions to creating the three-signal traffic light. But did you know that he was also the inventor of the very first gas mask? His innovation - originally called a smoke hood - created a blueprint for the development and evolution of the gas mask. Garret’s design received a patent in 1914 but his idea was not immediately well received. However, it eventually became more widely accepted through his creative marketing efforts. His “safety hood” was used in 1916 in the rescue of miners trapped in a tunnel explosion in Cleveland.\n\nGarret was also a businessman and a community leader, creating a line of commercial hair products among other ventures. He held several patents and made important financial and social contributions in community activism to advance the needs of African Americans.\n\nLearn More about Garret Morgan:\n\nBiography - Garret Morgan\n\nUS Department of Transportation - Garret Augustus Morgan\n\nRescue effort in 1916 Cleveland tunnel disaster remembered\n\nCelebrate Black History Month.
