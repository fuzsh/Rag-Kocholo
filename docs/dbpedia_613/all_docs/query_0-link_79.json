        "text": "Dr. Philip Chukwurah Emeagwali was born on the 23rd of August, 1954 in Akure Ondo State in a remote village in Nigeria, to a 16 year-old maternity, Agatha Emeagwali, and 33 year-old paternity, James Emeagwali. He came from a very penurious home, in Onitsha, Anambra State of Nigeria. Emeagwali would get up as early as 4 a.m in the morning to do the domestic house work, including drills of solving 100 Mathematics problems in his head every day.\n\nHowever, the daily drills transmogrified Emeagwali from an average student into a Mathematic guru. Emeagwali attended elementary and high school in Nigeria, where he studied English, French, Latin, Literature, Geography, Geometry, Mathematic, Biology and Physics. But his favorite subjects were Mathematics and Physics. And when he took a high school entrance exam at age 10, he got a perfect score on the Mathematic section and during his pre-teens, Emeagwali was considered a human computing calculating machine, and he was called calculus.\n\nBut during the civil war in 1967-1970, Emeagwali dropped out of school and fled to eastern State of Nigeria, where they lived in refugee camps and he was compelled to join Biafran Army at age 14 and he fought in the war, but 50,000 of the Igbo tribe were killed in ethnic conflicts. He lost many of his relations in the war, and his folk were homeless and hungry, they almost died of starvation, but God preserved them and when the war ended in 1970, Emeagwali enrolled at Christ the King College in Onitsha. He went through academic challenges, there were no school buses, and he walked two hours from his house to school every day.\n\nActually, he came from a poor home where family of nine lived on two cups of garri in 1970, but he studied harder than his classmates, he believed in study and reading his book and he only sleep three hours each night.\n\nIn 1973, he read Education in university of London and in 1974 Emeagwali traveled to the United States on scholarship to pursue his advanced studies, where he obtained B.S, Mathematic in Oregon State University. In 1977, he obtained M.S, civil engineering in George Washington University. In 1981, he also obtained environmental engineering degree in George Washington University. In 1986, he obtained M.A applied Mathematics in University of Maryland and he obtained his PhD, scientific computing in University of Michigan. In all, he earned five degrees, but he was expert in Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy and student came to consult him in these subjects.\n\nBesides, Emeagwali is a consultant and a researcher who has worked in various engineering duties in many Universities in United State of America. However, Emeagwali married a U.S citizen, Dale Brown, a scientist and cancer researcher on the 15th of August 1981 and he have three offspring, Ijeoma, Nnamdi and Onyeamechi.\n\nActually, Emeagwali loathed computer before, but he became a computer scientist because he love Mathematic right from age 10. Emeagwali love to solve complicated calculations in his head and as his studies became more advanced, he discovered how to solve millions, billions and trillions of calculations in computers and he developed interest in them. He studied supercomputer programming and he became supercomputer owner.\n\nIn the seventies and eighties, only few scientists understood the science of programming supercomputers and it was difficult to do the subject, but Emeagwali taught himself on computer and broke world record, he set the world’s fastest computational record on the connection machine. He used 65,000 separate computer processors to perform 3.1 billion calculations per second that lead to the reinvention of the supercomputers, setting the record in 1989. His achievement gave way to other scientists understanding the full capabilities of supercomputers and the benefit and practical use of linking several computers to communicate.\n\nEmeagwali used unaccepted technology that became the standard for supercomputers. He also invented a method, utilizing supercomputers that enabled oil companies to extracts more petroleum from oil fields. The U.S government had considered this problem among the twenty most difficult in the computing field. According to Emeagwali, who said, that the process can save $400 million per oil field, which ultimately reduces the price of gas.\n\nBill Clinton gave kudos to Emeagwali as one of the great minds of the Information Age and he was called Bill Gates of Africa in White House. Emeagwali earned the 1989 Gordon Bell prize, considered the Nobel Prize of computing, because of his engineering background.\n\nIn 1991, Emeagwali was honoured Distinguished Scientist Award, National Society of Black Engineers. In 1992, he won Computer Scientist of the year, National Technical Association. In 1993, he was honoured Distinguished Visitor, Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers Computer Society. And he also won Eminent Engineer, National Engineering Honor Society. In 1994, he won International Man of the year and he also won Certificate of Appreciation Award, Science Museum of Minnesota.\n\nHowever, Emeagwali turned his research to a global Super brain, World Wide Brain (WWB). He described the WWB as a digital Super brain that is intelligently connected to international network of powerful computers that can take the internet to the next level. Emeagwali suggested that future generations might be able to scan their brains onto the WWB to attain digital immortality.\n\nEmeagwali is a Nigerian blood, from Anambra State and he is the Africa most famous scientist, he is a genius and world renowned computer scientist. He had lived in United States for over 30 years, but in the 1980s, he sponsored a Green Card Visa for his 35 relatives, including his parents and all his siblings, nieces and nephews to study and live in the United States. His eight siblings, who were eating from-hand-to-mouth in Nigeria, have all received college educations with good jobs.\n\nEmeagwali said, “It is important that we do not forget where we came from, that success is not how much money you made for yourself, it is how many people you helped to become successful and he said, those of us who are on top have the responsibility to help those at the bottom because someday we might find ourselves at the bottom.”\n\nTo be genius simply means to do what you enjoy doing"
