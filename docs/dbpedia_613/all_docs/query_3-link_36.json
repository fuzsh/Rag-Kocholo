        "text": "Philip Freneau\n\nBorn January 2, 1752 (New York, New York)\n\nDied December 19, 1832 (Monmouth County, New Jersey)\n\nPoet, editor\n\nPhilip Freneau was a major early American poet who used his wit and literary skills to advance America's political goals at the end of the eighteenth century. His talent and dedication to the revolutionary cause earned him the title \"poet of the American Revolution.\" Many other authors from his time wrote for the cultured, wealthy citizens of the nation, but Freneau was different; he identified with the common people. Freneau devoted his life to public service, pouring his energy into propaganda (information distributed for the purpose of promoting a viewpoint) for American independence and full democracy (a government ruled through majority decisions made by the people).\n\n\"Of liberty and life; sweet liberty, Without whose aid the noblest genius fails.\"\n\nFreneau also advocated the idea of naturalism (the belief in a natural order to the world that can be explained through the sciences). Many people still believed in supernatural forces, such as witches and demons, which were largely out of their control and often caused evil in the world. Therefore, Freneau's work brought fresh interest and attention to the study of nature. He also worked for social change away from the large governments ruled by the wealthy and monarchies because he believed that people had lived in natural simplicity in ancient times doing good with their lives for their fellow humans before the coming of large complex societies. Freneau's life alternated between periods of zealous political activity and attempts to escape to the peace and solitude he found necessary as a poet. He pioneered certain forms of poetry that emphasized imagination and emotions called the Romanticism Movement. He is also widely regarded as the \"Father of American Literature.\"\n\nA French heritage\n\nPhilip Freneau was born Philip Morin Fresneau on January 2, 1752, in New York City. He altered the spelling of his family name by dropping the \"s.\" His father was Pierre Fresneau, a wine merchant and land speculator who was fluent in several languages besides his native French. Philip's mother was Agnes Watson, the daughter of a prosperous New Jersey planter of Scottish descent. Philip, the eldest of five children born to the Fresneaus, was born during a severe New York winter. By spring, a smallpox epidemic prompted Pierre to move his family to the countryside of Monmouth County, New Jersey, near Agnes's family. There, Pierre and Agnes built a plantation they called \"Mount Pleasant.\"\n\nPierre traveled extensively, and when he returned from his voyages, he would tell his children stories of far-off and exotic lands. He also traveled on horseback through nearly all of the American colonies, accumulating property including timberlands, sawmills, and farmlands. The Fresneau family had a large library in their home, and Philip received his early education from his mother. Agnes surrounded her children with books, works of art, and many interesting and cultured visitors and tutors. Following family tradition, Philip also spent some time at a boarding school in New York. At the age of fifteen, Philip was sent to the Mattisonia Grammar School in Manalapan, New Jersey, in order to prepare for college.\n\nThe death of Pierre Fresneau in October 1767 plunged the family into a period of economic uncertainty. Portions of the family estate were auctioned off in order to pay debts Pierre had accumulated through his purchases. Despite the financial turmoil, plans for Philip's education were not altered. Freneau had been an excellent student. His preparation was so thorough that he received a letter of acceptance to the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). He satisfied all the requirements expected of a freshman and was allowed to enter the sophomore class in the fall of 1768. The college president, John Witherspoon (1723–1794; see entry in volume 2), was so impressed that he sent a letter of congratulations to Philip's mother. One year after his father's death, sixteen-year-old Philip traveled the forty miles to the College of New Jersey to fulfill Pierre Fresneau's plan that his oldest son should be a clergyman.\n\nAt Princeton\n\nWhile in college, Freneau read Latin and Greek and studied mathematics and philosophy. Mornings began in the chapel with prayers. At five o'clock each evening, the collegians gathered in the main hall to deliver and listen to speeches. Freneau also took part in the extracurricular activities at college. For example, after the evening meal, students often gathered in local taverns to dance or play cards and dice. However, when the curfew bell rang at nine, each student returned to his quarters to prepare for the next day's classes.\n\nAt Princeton, Freneau received more than an education in the classics and philosophy; he learned about the life and politics of other colonies from fellow students. His roommate at Princeton was Virginian James Madison (1751–1836; see entry in volume 2), a future U.S. president. He also developed close friendships with William Bradford Jr. (1755–1795), who later became U.S. attorney general, and Hugh Henry Brackenridge (1748–1816; see entry in volume 1), a future Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice.\n\nPrinceton happened to be on the postal road between Philadelphia and New York, so the local news shop received the latest political pamphlets. Freneau and his classmates purchased, read, and studied these pamphlets and then rigorously debated the new ideas they found in them. As time went by, Freneau became more and more interested in the development of the American nation. Political concerns led Freneau and his friends to revive the \"Plain Dealing Club,\" a Whig literary club at Princeton. Whig was a British political label for those who opposed a strong British monarchy. Together, Freneau and Brackenridge wrote Father Bombo's Pilgrimage to Mecca in Arabia in 1770. It was a political satire (parody) of eighteenth-century America. It is believed to be the first work of American prose fiction.\n\nThe Rising Glory of America was another work on which Freneau and Brackenridge collaborated. It is a patriotic poem proclaiming the virtues of a new nation progressing toward its freedom. As noted in The Works of Philip Freneau, Brackenridge recited the poem at the graduation ceremony of the Princeton class of 1771:\n\nA WASHINGTON among our sons of fame\n\nWe boast conspicuous as the morning star\n\nAmong the inferior lights—\n\nTo distant wilds Virginia sent him forth—\n\nWith her brave sons he gallantly oppos'd\n\nThe bold invaders of his country's rights....\n\nAnd fairer prospects from the future draw—\n\nHere independent power shall hold her sway,\n\nAnd public virtue warm the patriot breast:\n\nNo traces shall remain of tyranny,\n\nAnd laws, a pattern to the world beside,\n\nBe here enacted first....\n\nFreneau now had his degree, but he still needed to find a way to make a living. Because his father was no longer alive, Freneau had to act as the head of his family and earn some income to support the household. He took a teaching job in Long Island, but after two short weeks, Freneau decided he hated it. In 1772, Freneau applied to do a postgraduate study in theology. He studied for two years but ultimately decided that theology was not the right choice for him. Throughout the years, he continued to write poetry, and eventually he published a collection titled The American Village. In this work, he contrasted American rural life with the decaying village life of Britain.\n\nThe poet of liberty\n\nFreneau received fresh inspiration as America's relationship with Britain deteriorated in 1775. That year, he penned several satires aimed at British invaders and Loyalists (American colonists who supported British rule). American Liberty was a collection of patriotic poems published in July; it was followed immediately by \"General Gage's Soliloquy\" and \"General Gage's Confession,\" two works that ridiculed Thomas Gage (1719–1787), a British military leader who enforced the unpopular British tax laws that led to the American Revolution (1775–83). Freneau did not mock the British or even the monarchy so much as he did the individuals and royal advisers whom he accused of corrupting the English political system. He was an impassioned Patriot (one who supported independence for the American colonies), and his writings consistently encouraged the defense of the colonies. This established his reputation as the \"poet of the American Revolution.\" He had finally found his true calling in literature.\n\nFreneau believed that his main function in life was to write poetry, not to fight as a soldier. He had a deep desire to escape the war and the inevitable social turmoil that came with it. As America was declaring its independence in 1776, Freneau accepted a position as secretary to a prominent planter and set sail for the Caribbean island of Santa Cruz. The job also offered Freneau the opportunity to attain some financial stability and eliminate his debts.\n\nFreneau spent the next two years writing about the beauties of nature on the island and learning the art of navigation. He experimented with different styles of writing in \"The Beauties of Santa Cruz.\" Although the island surroundings inspired Freneau, he was disgusted by the cruelty of slaveowners in the Caribbean. The condition of the slaves on the sugar plantation left Freneau depressed and unhappy with his island paradise. He wrote of his experiences and expressed his feelings in \"The Jamaica Funeral\" and \"The House of Night.\"\n\nIn 1778, Freneau decided it was time to escape the island and return to his mother's home at Mount Pleasant. He enlisted in the First Regiment of the New Jersey militia and won a promotion to the rank of sergeant for his service as a scout. Despite the duties of war, Freneau found time to publish American Independence, a passionate criticism of British rule. Days after the pamphlet was published, Freneau took on new work in addition to his militia duties. He became a coastal privateer (operator of a privately owned ship commissioned to fight or harass the enemy), a lucrative career choice. He sailed the Atlantic and the Caribbean aboard the ship Indian River and later the John Couster.\n\nIn May 1780, Freneau was the third mate for the ship Aurora when it was captured by a British ship. Freneau and his fellow crewmen were confined on the prison ship Scorpion, which was anchored in New York Harbor. The men were treated cruelly, and Freneau became very ill with fever. He was transferred to the Hunter, a hospital ship where the conditions were not much better. When he was released six weeks later, Freneau was bitter about the brutal treatment he had received. He wrote about his experiences in captivity in a poem titled \"The British Prison Ship,\" published in 1781. Freneau's life as a soldier was over, and he returned home to New Jersey to regain his health.\n\nIn April 1781, Freneau moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he worked as a writer and occasional coeditor of the Freeman's Journal. Between 1781 and 1784, over one hundred of his poems and essays appeared in the journal. Freneau often wrote his poems in immediate response to events in history, but his writing also promoted the concern of the common people. He advanced the view that the American Revolution took place in order to make the nation a classless society, free from the abuse of the wealthy privileged. Newspapers from New York to South Carolina reprinted many of Freneau's essays. However, with the end of the war, his inspiration once again faded, and his contributions became scarce.\n\nThe National Gazette\n\nEconomic uncertainty once again left Freneau searching for work. He took a job as a postal clerk; the job allowed him time to write but did not stir his imagination. In 1784, Freneau returned to the sea, this time as the captain of his own ship in the Caribbean. His romantic adventures provided him with plenty of material, and he wrote extensively, including the poem \"The Wild Honeysuckle.\" By 1790, Freneau was known as a skillful sea captain and a fiery author, but he remained broke. At the age of thirty-eight, he decided it was time to settle down. He returned to Monmouth County and married Eleanor Forman, the daughter of a wealthy New Jersey farmer, on April 15. Philip and Eleanor had four children. Freneau accepted a job as editor of the Daily Advertiser in New York City and enjoyed a modest amount of fame with two collections of his poetry in print.\n\nFreneau was offered a position as translator for the U.S. State Department by his longtime friend Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826; see entry in volume 1), who was then serving as secretary of state. Freneau hesitated about accepting a government job, because the income was insufficient, and he made no reply. In the meantime, Jefferson met with U.S. representative James Madison (1751–1836; see entry in volume 2) of Virginia about the need for a strong newspaper to represent Jefferson's ideas and counter the powerful Gazette of the United States, a newspaper that supported the notions of government of Jefferson political foe Alexander Hamilton (c. 1755–1804; see entry in volume 1). Jefferson and Madison decided that Freneau would be the perfect editor for the new paper. Madison traveled to New Jersey to visit his former roommate and convince him to join the fight. The call of politics was powerful, and Freneau agreed to take on the job. In the summer of 1791, he moved his family to Philadelphia, the nation's capital city at that time, to found the National Gazette.\n\nThe first edition of the National Gazette was released on October 31, 1791. It came out on Mondays and Thursdays. Freneau's newspaper attacked the domestic and foreign policies of Hamilton and President George Washington (1732–1799; served 1789–97; see entry in volume 2) and defended those of Jefferson. This caused the president to refer to him as \"that rascal Freneau,\" in a Cabinet meeting. The National Gazette was a success and soon had subscribers throughout the country. However, a yellow fever plague struck Philadelphia in the fall of 1793, and more than half of the city's population fled to the countryside. Without income from local subscribers, Freneau was forced to close down the newspaper after only two short years of publication.\n\nCaptain Freneau\n\nAt the age of forty-one, Philip Freneau returned to Mount Pleasant and established his own press. In 1795, he edited and published a new collection of his poetry, Poems Written Betweenthe Years 1768 and 1794. In his newspapers, he commented on major national events and issues. After Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798, Freneau warned of the dangers of losing liberties. The Alien Act gave the president the power to imprison aliens (citizens of foreign countries who were living in the United States) or send them back to their country of residence if they were suspected of activities posing a threat to the U.S. government. The Sedition Act had a broader range, prohibiting all spoken or written criticism of the government, the Congress, or the president. Editors faced fines and jail time if their publications violated the Alien and Sedition Acts. Freneau protested the arrest of newspaper editor Benjamin Franklin Bache (1769–1798), who published anti-Federalist opinions in his Daily Advertiser.\n\nConcerning the death of Bache's grandfather, Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790; see entry in volume 1) in 1790, Freneau wrote the following verse titled On the Death of Dr. Benjamin Franklin:\n\nSo long accustomed to your aid,\n\nThe world laments your exit made;\n\nSo long befriended by your art,\n\nPhilosopher, 'tis hard to part!—\n\nWhen monarchs tumble to the ground,\n\nSuccessors easily are found:\n\nBut, matchless Franklin! what a few\n\nCan hope to rival such as you,\n\nWho seized from kings their sceptered pride,\n\nAnd turned the lightning darts aside.\n\nOver the years, none of Freneau's publishing attempts proved successful. His marriage suffered under the endless debt, and the couple separated. In 1802, Freneau returned to the sea aboard the John, a schooner that carried salt and cider to Southern ports. He occasionally returned to his farm but was forced to sell off pieces of his land for income. Freneau worked on his poems and wrote essays attacking the greed and selfishness of corrupt politicians during the early years of the nineteenth century. One collection of his poems was published in 1809 and another in 1815; both were two-volume sets. So vocal during the American Revolution, Freneau had surprisingly less to say about the War of 1812 (1812–15) against the same enemy.\n\nFreneau produced no publications of any sort between 1816 and 1821. In 1822, at the age of seventy, Freneau made plans to publish a final selection of his writings, but this collection did not come out during his lifetime. In 1832, Freneau applied for a government pension of $35 a year. The money was due to him as a veteran of the American Revolution. However, Freneau did not live to receive his pension. He was caught in a snowstorm and lost his way while walking home from a country store on December 19, 1832. After a life filled with struggles, Freneau froze to death in Monmouth County at the age of eighty.\n\nFor More Information\n\nBooks\n\nAxelrad, Jacob. Philip Freneau: Champion of Democracy.
