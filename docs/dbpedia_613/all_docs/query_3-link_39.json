        "text": "The huge Nigerian,\n\nand indeed African community in the United States engages in intense\n\nand constant debate on a list serve run by Professor Toyin Falola –\n\nSAAFRICADIALOGUE. In the run up to the 50th anniversary celebration of\n\nNigeria’s independence, the key issue of concern to the community was\n\nfraud and the Emeagwali narratives. Anyone that has googled\n\nNigerian achievers\n\non the Internet would have come across the “great achievements” of one\n\nPhilip Emeagwali. The question posed was whether he is the greatest\n\nNigerian achiever in the contemporary world or a monumental fraudster?\n\nIn the numerous\n\ncitations about his so-called achievements, we read that he has a PhD\n\nin scientific computing from the University of Michigan, that he is the\n\nfather of the Internet and the inventor of super computers.\n\nHe claims to have\n\ninvented 41 patented devices including a timing device, non-capsizable\n\ncontainer, sweepstake programmer, random unit generator amusement\n\ndevice, and bidirectional monitoring and control system and so on. In\n\nan interview by Susan Henderson for the book African-American\n\nInventors, Philip Emeagwali presented his achievements in the following\n\nmanner: “…Invented methods and procedures for making computers faster\n\nand more powerful. These methods enabled me to perform the world’s\n\nfastest computation of 3.1 billion calculations per second in 1989 and\n\nsolve the largest weather forecasting equations with 128 million points\n\nin 1990. Programmed a computer with 65,000 processors to outperform the\n\nfastest supercomputer and thereby proving that it is best to use many\n\nprocessors in designing supercomputers. Successfully implemented the\n\nfirst petroleum reservoir model on a massively parallel computer in\n\n1989. As a result, one in 10 parallel supercomputers is used to find\n\nand recover additional oil and gas. Solved one of America’s 20 Grand\n\nChallenges – accurately computing how oil flows underground and thereby\n\nalerting the petroleum industry that massively parallel computers can\n\nbe used to recover more oil. Only 30 percent of the oil in a reservoir\n\ncan be recovered and this discovery will enable oil companies to\n\nrecover more oil. Invented a new approach of designing supercomputers\n\nby observing and emulating patterns in nature. Formulated new\n\nmathematical (partial differential) equations for slowly moving liquids\n\nand gases such as the flow within the Earth’s interior.”\n\nUnder Olusegun\n\nObasanjo, the Nigerian Government invited and celebrated Philip\n\nEmeagwali as one of our shining stars in the Diaspora. This was at a\n\ntime in which there were claims that the best Nigerian brains are\n\nabroad and we should bring them back to develop our country. Those of\n\nus in the country were considered failures that could not get positions\n\nabroad.\n\nThe problem with\n\nPhilip is that the university has now revealed that he never completed\n\nhis doctorate degree and checks at the United States Patent and\n\nTrademark office did not show up patents with the name Philip\n\nEmeagwali. He has not published in any reputable peer reviewed journal.\n\nThe conclusion is that narratives about his achievements are a fraud.\n\nThe claims about\n\nhis achievements have however been cleverly spread in numerous web\n\nsites, and today many curricula on African and Black achievements have\n\nhim as a star example. Black youth in Europe go around with his\n\nphotographs in their school bags determined to be as “great” as\n\nEmeagwali when they grow up.\n\nOne of the most\n\npoignant aspects of the saga is the manner in which Gloria Thomas\n\nEmeagwali was dragged into the debate. Gloria is a top ranked professor\n\nof history in the United States. She is a good friend of mine from our\n\ndays as junior lecturers in Ahmadu Bello University in the early 1980s.\n\nAt that time, she was recovering from a bitter divorce with a different\n\nEmeagwali who had studied with her in Trinidad and Tobago, married her\n\nand brought her to Nigeria where she suffered a lot of abuse. To her\n\nshock, she found her photograph cut and pasted on Philip Emeagwali’s\n\nweb site with the fraudulent claim that she is his wife. She put a\n\ndisclaimer on her own web page and has sued him in court.\n\nWhen she drew\n\nattention to this in the on-going debate, many questioned her\n\nsincerity. As one commentator put it “”Emeagwali” is not a common name,\n\nlike Okeke, Okafor or Ojo. We know not whether Gloria bears ANY past or\n\npresent relationship with Philip beyond a common last name.” The\n\nsuspicion was that she might be his estranged wife trying to get at\n\nhim, which is extremely unfair allegation for the Gloria I know. At\n\nthat point, the debate got dirty between so called Igbo bashers and\n\nIgbo defenders derailing the core issue about fraudulent claims of this\n\nman. The most painful issue of the debate is that Nigeria bashers in\n\nthe United States are now singing narratives about how most Nigerian\n\nacademics in the country are 419 scholars."
