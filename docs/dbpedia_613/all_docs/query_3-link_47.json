        "text": "Since this is Black History Month, so I would like to devote each Write Anything Wednesday post to black history. (You can view last week’s post here if you haven’t had the chance to read it yet.) This week, I wanted to take a look at a black inventor by the name of Daniel Hale Williams, but I realized I needed to first look at an overarching problem that exists when discussing black inventors.\n\nThis post was partly inspired by a couple of things I read a few years ago. On another blog, I read a short story entitled “Life Without Black People,” or something similar. But I had already read a story like that sometime before.\n\nHowever, one person who responded to the post left a link to a thorough refutation of many of the claims made in the story. (Incidentally, that’s how I was first introduced to Snopes.com.) The Snopes post was eye-opening, but I didn’t want to read the message at first.\n\nHow Did the Story Go?\n\nWithout given much away, I will say the story starts with a boy named Theo, who asked his mom what life would be like if there were no black people. Theo follows his mother around for the day and they soon realize how difficult life would be without the inventions made by black people.\n\nBlack inventors mentioned in the story are (inventions in parentheses):\n\nWilliam Barry (the postmarking and canceling machine)\n\nSarah Boone (the ironing board)\n\nCharles Brooks (the street sweeper)\n\nJohn Burr (the lawn mower)\n\nLee Burridge (the typewriting machine)\n\nPhilip Downing (the letter drop mailbox)\n\nCharles Drew (discovered a way to preserve and store blood; started first blood bank in the world)\n\nJoseph Gammel (the supercharge system for internal combusting engines)\n\nFrederick Jones (the air conditioner)\n\nLewis Howard Latimer (the filament within the light bulb)\n\nJohn Love (the pencil sharpener)\n\nA. Lovette (the advanced printing press)\n\nJan E. Matzeliger (the shoe lasting machine)\n\nAlexander Miles (the elevator)\n\nGarrett A. Morgan (the traffic light)\n\nLydia O. Newman (the brush)\n\nAlice Parker (the heating furnace)\n\nWilliam Purvis (the fountain pen)\n\nLloyd P. Ray (the dustpan)\n\nElbert R. Robinson (the trolley)\n\nWalter Sammongs (the comb)\n\nGeorge T. Samon (the clothes dryer)\n\nRichard Spikes (the automatic gearshift)\n\nJohn Standard (the refrigerator)\n\nThomas W. Stewart (the mop)\n\nMadam C. J. Walker (hair care products)\n\nDaniel Hale Williams (the first open heart surgery)\n\nWhat Did I Find in the Snopes Post?\n\nAs it turns out, there is more than one version of the story floating around like the one I read. The post by David Mikkelson shares three versions of a short story involved around teaching people about black inventions.\n\nThe first story involves a group of white people who want to see what the world would look like without blacks.\n\nThe second version is the same one I read (which can be found on Philip Emeagwali’s website).\n\nA third story has someone named Uchechi talking to God. Uchechi is led by God to see what the world would look like without inventions made by black people.\n\nIn the first story, many, if not all of the black inventors’ names found in the second version are included, but Joseph Smith (the lawn sprinkler), Lewis Latimer (not “Later” — the electric lamp), Michael Harvey (the lantern), and Granville T. Woods (the automatic cut off switch) are added. Also, the land in the first story is uncultivated because there would have been no (black) slaves in the first 200 years of the United States.\n\nMikkelson points out the inaccuracies from the stories, while confirming bits that are accurate. He also adds some more information about extra inventions from African-Americans mentioned that most people aren’t aware of.\n\nWhat’s the Takeaway from the Snopes Post?\n\nMikkelson makes a lot of good points in the article. For one thing, the fact that someone may feel the need to exaggerate diminishes the accomplishments. Also, other accomplishments from the same people being praised are being ignored. Additionally, there are more black inventors who are being ignored.\n\nKnowing that, it really stresses the importance of independent research. When you find a story like the ones I’ve mentioned, it helps to take notes and vet the information. It’s especially true when those stories are shared via email, social media, and word-of-mouth. Even information on a fact-checking site like Snopes is open to be fact-checked.\n\nWould You Like to Know More About Black Inventors?\n\nI certainly do and the Snopes post is a good place to start compiling a list.\n\nI especially want to do further research because of the passage of time. The post was published a few years ago (in 2011), and at the time, it was hard to find information on the black inventors and innovators. Since then, I have found some links on Michael Harvey, for example.\n\nTwo people I would like to visit this month are Daniel Hale Williams, who a mentioned at the top, and Madame C.J. Walker.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“A World Without Black People.” Philip Emeagwali. <http://emeagwali.com/african-american/inventors/world-without-african-american-inventors.html>."
