May her prophetic witness continue to inspire us to share the Good News with those whom we encounter, most especially the poor, oppressed, and marginalized. May Sister Thea’s life and legacy compel us to walk together and to pray together. May we be filled with Sister Thea’s grace and perseverance. For in turbulent times of racial injustice, she sought equity, peace, and reconciliation. In times of intolerance and ignorance, she brought wisdom, awareness, unity, and charity. In times of pain, sickness, and suffering, she taught us how to live fully until our time on this earth is over. Amen. Adapted from the prayer for her canonization https://www.sistertheabowman.com/prayer/ First Reading Spot Two voices alternate reading the quotes. Judy and Dave Words of Inspiration from Thea Bowman Slideshow of Quotes - Marie will advance the slides God is present in everything. In the universe, in creation, in me, and all that happens to me, in my brothers and sisters, in the church - everywhere. Remember who you are and whose you are. I try to make sense of life. I try to keep myself open to people and to laughter, and to love, and to have faith. I know that God is using me in ways beyond my comprehension. I think the difference between me and some people is that I’m content to do my little bit. Sometimes people think they have to do big things in order to make change. But if each one would light a candle, we’d have a tremendous light. God has given me the grace to see some of the seeds that I have sown bear good fruit, and I am so grateful. I find that when I am involved in the business of life, when I’m working with people, particularly children, I feel better. A kind of strength and energy comes with that. I know that suffering gives us new perspectives and helps us to clarify our real value. I know that suffering has helped me to clarify my relationships. . . Perhaps suffering stops us in our tracks and forces us to confront what is real within ourselves and in our environment. Part of my approach to my illness has been to say I want to choose life, I want to keep going, I want to live fully until I die. Gospel Spot Marie Thea Bowman - What Does It Mean to Be Black and Catholic? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6pBrBOawII&list=RDTT5Yv97zF-Q&start_radio=1 [4.26 minutes] Homily Bill Stevens Prayer of the People Joanne and Tom Kyritz We lift up our prayers in confidence knowing that we stand united with Sister Thea Bowman. Our response will be: Let justice flow like a river. For the citizens and leaders of the global community, may they enact policies that uphold the dignity and equality of all people, that ensure a sustainable and equitable distribution of our resources to advance the common good, we pray: Let justice flow like a river. For an end to systemic racism: that we may reform and rebuild all our institutions - policing, education, healthcare, housing, politics, and economics - with justice and love as our guide. And for reconciliation and reparation for centuries of violence and oppression against People of Color, we pray: Let justice flow like a river. For us gathered today: that we may honestly seek to understand ourselves and others, as well as the ways we benefit from privilege and power, that we may be allies who confront bias and prejudice in ourselves and one another, we pray: Let justice flow like a river. For those marginalized, especially young women of color: that they may be emboldened by the witness of Sister Thea Bowman to embrace their wholeness, to lift up their voices, and to claim their rightful place in our midst, as they seek to respond to the Spirit within guiding them, we pray: Let justice flow like a river. For our sisters and brothers in Sophia, in our sister parish in Rochester, for all those involved with Pathways to Prosperity, and for our sisters and brothers in Voice of the Faithful, FCM, and RAMP, may they know of our love and care for them. May they continue to do good as they follow the Way of Jesus…we pray... For what else shall we pray? Allow 4 petitions. We pray with confidence that these petitions and those unspoken concerns and needs deep within each of us will be heard and answered with loving compassion. Amen. Adapted from Future Church’s Witnessing for Racial Justice Prayer Service in The Sister Thea Bowman Resource Packet, page 40 Sign of Peace Mike Prayer over the Bread and the Wine Linda Schaller We are grateful – for this bread, Which earth has given and human hands have formed. This bread nourishes our spirit. We are grateful – for this wine, Fruit of the vine and work of human hands. It is our spiritual drink. Eucharistic Prayer for Black History Month (modified)Mike & Tom Schaller Presider: We gather today mindful of the quest for freedom that cries out in the heart and soul of every woman and man. A quest that is fierce with resolve and will not end until freedom is won for all. Voice: From the time of Moses, people enslaved others for profit and gain. When Israel was in Egypt’s land, the Israelites were oppressed so hard they could not stand. Let my people go! P: Four hundred years ago, on the shores of the new-found land which became America, people were once again enslaved for profit and gain. Let my people go! Voice: On the backs of these women and men this country was built. Let my people go! No consideration, no justice, no mercy for them. Let my people go! P: A war began that tore a country apart. The Emancipation Proclamation brought a degree of freedom but injustice and greed still persisted. Let my people go! Voice: New ways of indignities and injustices were invented: Jim Crow, Whites Only, Segregation and Red Lining. Let my people go! P: And yet, in spite of all this, women and men of color have produced so many beautiful and meaningful creations. We thank Dr. Shirley Jackson for fiber-optic cable, Lewis Latimer for carbon filament (inner light bulb), Marie Van Brittan Brown for closed-circuit television security, Otis Boykin for the pacemaker, Lonnie Johnson for the Super Soaker and thermoelectric energy converters, Charles Drew for the blood bank, Marian Croak for Voice over Internet Protocol, Lisa Gelobter for animated Gifs on the web, Philip Emeagwali – a drop out, for the world’s fastest computer, Jesse Wilkins, Jr, for the math behind gamma radiation, Garrett Morgan for the gas mask and the traffic signal. Mary and Mildred Davidson for women’s feminine products and the walker. Onesimus and Cotton Mather for the method that would eventually become vaccinations against infectious diseases. Appreciating these contributions as just a few among many, we pray recognizing the worth of all, and being grateful to learn what was never deemed important enough to include in our educational experiences. Voice: We remember Jesus. He challenged us to confront any influence within us, any social, family, religious or cultural influence, that prevents us from recognizing the power within us and within all people - the power of love; a power that could join all people as one in their common dream of a better humanity. P: So we take this bread, as Jesus took bread, and give thanks for the wonder of the Divine in, and with us, and we eat, committing ourselves to love as Jesus loved, wholeheartedly, generously, and compassionately, so that people will see expressed in us what we have seen expressed in Jesus. Voice: We take this wine, and we remember Jesus drinking wine with his friends. We drink, giving our “Yes” to being on earth the heart of the Divine. P: Our prayer is that Justice Rolls down like water. We have a Dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all women and men are created equal.” Voice: We have a dream that people of color will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. P: We have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight. Voice: This is our hope. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood and sisterhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day. P: From every mountainside, let freedom ring! Amen. By Michael Corso Prayer of Jesus Spot Florence Noctor An Act of Commitment to Racial Justice We stand in the shadow of the prophets crying out for justice and peace. We are called to be a people of reconciliation, serving a country in need. Courageous women and men have taken the risk of standing up and speaking out for the least and the lowest. This work involves risking ourselves for the sake of love and moving beyond ourselves in order to serve one another. We are all called to the work and ministry of social justice and reconciliation. The response to each question will be I will. Will you proclaim the good news of reconciliation in both word and deed? I will. Will you acknowledge and address the prejudices that keep you from loving all persons? I will. Will you strive to see Jesus in all persons, and value those with whom you disagree? I will. Will you seek to mend what is broken by greed and inequities? I will. Will you strive to speak words that liberate, heal and break the bonds of silence about racism throughout our country? I will. Will you work toward dismantling the abuse of power? I will. May we be empowered to continue the work of reconciliation. May we have the courage to overcome our fears and embody love for all. May we have the grace to grow in self-awareness of our white privilege and may we use our personal integrity to work for racial justice and equity in our neighborhoods and throughout our country. Amen. Inspired by the Act of Commitment to Racial Justice in Liturgical Resources for Black History Month https://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2021-10/liturgical-resources-for-black-history-month-final.pdf Breaking of the Bread Alice or Colleen In the breaking of the bread, we knew you, brother Jesus, Alleluia. In the breaking of the bread, we know you, brother Jesus, Alleluia. In the breaking of the bread, we know you, brother Jesus, Alleluia. Presider: We gather together this morning and every Sunday to remember Jesus and his teachings. We come to be nourished spiritually, so we eat and drink bread and wine in his memory. Our sharing in this meal is a sign of our willingness to follow Jesus. When sharing the bread, say: “This is and you are the bread of life.” Once everyone has the bread. Presider: With great joy, we state. We are followers of Jesus. When sharing the cup, say: “The cup of the Covenant” Communion Song Margie slides and music Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child - sung by Thea Bowman on the CD Songs of My People - The Complete Collection - Disk 1 #3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT5Yv97zF-Q [3.17 minutes] Sometimes I feel like a motherless child Sometimes I feel like a motherless child Sometimes I feel like a motherless child, A long way from home, Margie: start to lower the sound here and stop at 1.23. a long way from my home. Closing Prayer Mike Our closing prayer is from the conclusion of Sister Thea Bowman’s address to the Catholic bishops in June 1989 at Seton Hall University where she spoke to them as a sister having a “heart to heart” conversation with her brothers. May her hope become our prayer. Today we’re called to walk together in new ways and to celebrate who we are and whose we aren’t. If we walk and talk and work and play together and stand together in Jesus’ name - we will be who we say we are - truly followers of Jesus and we shall overcome - overcome the poverty - overcome the loneliness - overcome the alienation - and build together a holy city, a new Jerusalem, a city set apart where they’ll know that we are here because we love one another. Amen. Adapted from Future Church’s Witnessing for Racial Justice Prayer Service in The Sister Thea Bowman Resource Packet, pages 40-41 First Sunday of Black History Month 2024 https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/HYbKuomts3hXq5IOyHJLVhgP9wUO8G93BUCXi55LItWioV95uyXtl0hfPCqkQ3w6.cFzByewCTX955jCe?startTime=1707058967000 1st Sunday of Black History Month; 5th Sunday in Ordinary Time - February 4, 2024 Theme: Accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope We pray for those individuals in need (please mute yourself) Mike Opening Song Margie Ebony and Ivory by Paul McCartney & Stevie Wonder https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_IeYjqL8GU Introduction Margie As we begin Black History Month, we think about the song Ebony and Ivory, sung by Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney in 1982. What a beautiful image - the black and white keys of the piano truly exist in “harmony.” It seems like it should be so simple. Yet, here we are over 40 years later and we wonder if things have improved. We can certainly feel disappointed by the pace of change … sometimes a little forward, but then always backwards as well. With our theme this morning, “Accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope,” taken from a speech by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., we will look at reasons for hope in race relationships. And in all honesty, this started out with a “pollyannaish” desire & need for good news. But our readings and prayers, all written by people of color, point to a hope that is far from flowers and rainbows. This hope is difficult, hard-won, and comes from a place deep inside of human beings who have experienced great hardship and struggle. May their determination to go on, move forward, and never stop hoping, teach and inspire us as we do all that we can to live as antiracist allies. Wisdom Bowl Margie Opening Prayer Mike Today’s opening prayer is modified from “Lord, Lord, Open Unto Me,” by Howard Thurman from \"Meditations of the Heart\". I open myself and share …light for darkness I open myself and share … courage for fear I open myself and share … hope for despair I open myself and share … peace for turmoil I open myself and share … joy for sorrow I open myself and share … strength for weakness I open myself and share … wisdom for confusion I open myself and share … forgiveness for sins I open myself and share … tenderness for toughness I open myself and share … love for hates I open myself, recognizing the Divine within …and my connection to the whole human family. We learn to live, when we learn to give each other what we need to survive, together alive. May it be so. Reading 1 Margie Hope Is a Woman Who Has Lost Her Fear by Alice Walker https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhMn3G0Kdvc Inspired words Reading 2 Sue MLK and the Limitless Legacy of Hope modified from an article by James Peterson 1/12/2024 https://thephiladelphiacitizen.org/mlk-limitless-legacy-of-hope/ Hope is infinite. In one of his writings from shortly before his death, the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. advised us that “we must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope.” This is King-as-Preacher, ministering to the congregation of humanity, delivering a salve for what ailed us then and, of course, what ails us now. These days, the disappointments feel infinite. How then, can we talk about hope in this moment and in this time of critical crises at home and abroad? This is where the power of infinite hope kicks in. King’s words about finite disappointment and infinite hope compel us to take his directive as a whole. These words are a bifurcated rhetorical model, one through which we can wrestle with disappointment — accept disappointments at some point — but … and the “but” in the aforementioned King quote is doing yeoman’s work here. That acceptance is inextricably linked to an infinite reservoir of hope available to all of us. Hope is not a commodity. It is the essence of the optimistic energy accessible to us in our times of need. Hope is at the ready to motivate us through and beyond the mundane disappointments that too often threaten to overwhelm us. We will not be overwhelmed. Our hope that things can get better — that things will be better — is embarrassing sometimes. Many people feel hopeful and don’t always (or ever) want to show it. And still others would rather center on the disappointments, ad infinitum. It is so much easier to talk about everything that’s wrong with the world than it is to do something about it. This is why the MAGA mentality is so compelling to a certain segment of the American electorate. The acronym — Make America Great Again — represents a statement of faux hope that America might return to a mythological greatness that Dr. King dedicated his life to deconstructing. The MAGA slogan represents those who truck almost exclusively in grievance culture, a hopeless political enterprise designed to feed off of pain, anger, and racial resentment. The truth is that America wasn’t ever that great for a whole lot of Americans through much of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. In Dr. King’s “Other America” speech he said, “[t]here are two Americas. One America is beautiful … But there is another America. This other America has a daily ugliness about it that transforms the buoyancy of hope into the fatigue of despair. In this other America, thousands and thousands of people … walk the streets in search for jobs that do not exist. In this other America, millions of people are forced to live in vermin-filled, distressing housing conditions …” This is King-as-Professor. But like a preacher, he makes it plain: “The most critical problem in the other America is the economic problem.” This is true even today. As of late last year, 66.6 percent of the total wealth in America was owned and controlled by 10 percent of the richest families and corporations in this country. In “A Proper Sense of Priorities,” a speech that King delivered less than two months before he was assassinated, his critical assessment of America was on full display. “I need not go into a long discussion about the [Vietnam] war and its damaging effects. We all know.” he said to an audience of thousands in 1968. This is King-as-Prophet. “We live in a nation that is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today. And any nation that spends almost $80 billion of its annual budget for defense channeled through the Pentagon and hands out a pittance here and there for social uplift, is moving towards its own spiritual doom …. We’ve played havoc with the destiny of the world … Somewhere we must make it clear that we are concerned about the survival of the world …” King-as-Prophet is probably the King we will continue to hear less and less of, but we should not confuse this deliberate cover-up with the enduring truth of Dr. King’s critique of this nation. Late last year, President Joe Biden signed the National Defense Authorization Act into law. This act allocates $816.7 billion for the defense budget. The United States spends more on defense than any other nation in the world. Meanwhile, 12 percent of our fellow Americans live in poverty; we boast the largest prison population in the world; have the highest infant and maternal mortality rate among developed countries — especially among Black Americans; and one in five children here go hungry. The criticisms of America brought by King-as-Prophet continue to ring true. Our priorities are hopelessly out of alignment with our humanity. Most people will likely associate Rev. King’s sense of hope with his most widely-quoted (and truncated/edited) “I Have A Dream” speech. Far fewer will reference King’s much less popular “Unfulfilled Hopes” speech, a sermon that predates King’s hopeful “I Have a Dream” message by nearly a decade. In “Unfulfilled Hopes” King says, “We discover in our lives, soon or later, that all pain is never relieved. We discover, soon or later, that all hopes are never realized. We come to the point of seeing that no matter how long we pray for them sometimes, and no matter how long we cry out for a solution to our problems, no matter how much we desire it, we don’t get the answer.” This is King-as-Preacher, again. He connects with the congregation of humanity through a transparent analysis of our “shattered dreams.” But he won’t allow the hopelessness of his message to outstrip the power of hope itself. Later in the sermon, Minister King points to the concept of the “dynamic will,” a concept he borrows from Deep River, by the great and influential theologian Howard Thurman. In his sermon, King defines the dynamic will as existing in “the individual who stands up in his circumstances and stands up amid the problem, faces the fact that his hopes are unfulfilled. And then he says, “I have one thing left. Life has beaten it down; it has broken away from me many things, sometimes my physical body. But at least it has left me with a will, and I will assert this, and I refuse to be stopped.” The vast valley of difference between “I Have a Dream” and “Unfulfilled Hopes/Shattered Dreams” is a critical chasm across which we are all called to continuously revisit Dr. King’s rhetorical mastery and the many ways that his thinking about this world (and the next) evolves through his work, and evidences itself in his words over time. The power of this critical exegesis of King’s work is that it directly confronts the naivete of any sanitized versions of King’s legacy in perpetuity. King’s vision for infinite hope was not naïve; it was cultivated in the cauldron of conflicting conceptualizations of hope — hope unfulfilled and hope infinite. Understanding King in these complicated ways should give all of us hope. His is a limitless legacy of hope bestowed upon us in ways that challenge us to embody all of its infinite potential. But —and here I hope my “but” can do the work of King’s, “but” – hope in both its infinite and unfulfilled meanings, ultimately requires us to act. Inspired words Psalm Margie Those Who Dream by The Many https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHlDSdYfBmM Reading 3 Kathy Opinion: ‘Origin’ brilliantly exposes America’s caste system. Here’s how we tear it down modified from an opinion by Keith Magee, CNN January 20, 2024 https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/20/opinions/origin-movie-caste-racism-duvernay-wilkerson-magee/index.html I know it will take a long time to deconstruct race. However, there are reasons for optimism. Among Black Americans, attitudes to race are evolving. Although most Black adults in the US still see their racial identity as being important or extremely important to how they think about themselves, young Black Americans are less likely than their older peers to say this. I suspect this trend will continue, as identity becomes an increasingly complex mix of factors, including ancestry, economic status, faith and sexuality. At the same time, the racial makeup of the US is changing. According to the 2020 census data the proportion of people who identify as non-Hispanic White is in decline. The good news is, most Americans don’t actually think this matters — the majority of adults (including, significantly, 62% of White people) now see this demographic change as being neither good nor bad for society. So maybe, as we begin to redefine and expand the intersecting communities to which we feel we belong, rather than the castes to which we are assigned, race is gradually losing its hold over us. I hope DuVernay’s powerful movie will inspire everyone who sees it to defy racism. I would urge you to go and watch “Origin,” then walk out of that movie theater determined to make a connection with someone who is not considered to be of what society could consider to be your caste. Listen to their stories, learn about their aspirations, look for the things you have in common. If we each do that on a regular basis, we will eventually sweep away the rotten social structures that have divided us for far too long. Together, we can fix up this country, just as Wilkerson fixes up her old house in the movie, by building new foundations based on true equality, empathy and love. It’s never too late. Every single one of us has skin in the game, for, as Wilkerson points out, the caste system diminishes us all, wherever we may sit in its fabricated hierarchy. Inspired words Homily Mike Shared Homily All Prayers of the People Linda K & Maryann Linda K: Litany for Those Not Ready for Healing by Dr. Yolanda Pierce Let us not rush to the language of healing, before understanding the fullness of the injury and the depth of the wound. Let us not rush to offer a bandaid, when the gaping wound requires surgery and complete reconstruction. Let us not offer false equivalencies, thereby diminishing the particular pain being felt in a particular circumstance in a particular historical moment. Let us not speak of reconciliation without speaking of reparations and restoration, or how we can repair the breach and how we can restore the loss. Let us not rush past the loss of this mother’s child, this father’s child…someone’s beloved son. Let us not value property over people; let us not protect material objects while human lives hang in the balance. Let us not value a false peace over a righteous justice. Let us not be afraid to sit with the ugliness, the messiness, and the pain that is life in community together. Let us not offer clichés to the grieving, those whose hearts are being torn asunder. Instead… Let us mourn Black and brown men and women, those killed extrajudicially every 28 hours. Let us lament the loss of a teenager, dead at the hands of a police officer who described him as a demon. Let us weep at a criminal justice system, which is neither blind nor just. Let us call for the mourning men and the wailing women, those willing to rend their garments of privilege and ease, and sit in the ashes of this nation’s original sin. Let us be silent when we don’t know what to say. Let us be humble and listen to the pain, rage, and grief pouring from the lips of our neighbors and friends. Let us decrease, so that our brothers and sisters who live on the underside of history may increase. Let us listen to the shattering glass and let us smell the purifying fires, for it is the language of the unheard. Let us pray with our eyes open and our feet firmly planted on the ground. And as we turn to our own community and the whole world… For our sisters and brothers in Sophia, in our sister parish in Rochester and for all those involved with Pathways to Prosperity, Voice of the Faithful, RAMP, and FCM… may they continue to allow hope to power their works of justice, we pray. (Allow prayerful silence) For what else shall we pray? Allow 4 petitions, followed by prayerful silences. May we allow ourselves to feel the pain and hurt, and have the humility to see our complicity in injustice. May we rouse ourselves from our indifference. May we speak out and not remain silent. May we dream fierce dreams. May we learn to accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope. Amen. Sharing Peace Mike Prayer over the Bread Janet We are grateful – for this bread, Which earth has given and human hands have formed. This bread nourishes our spirit. Prayer over the Wine We are grateful – for this wine, Fruit of the vine and work of human hands. It is our spiritual drink. Eucharistic Prayer for Black History Month Mike & Peter Presider: We gather today mindful of the quest for freedom that cries out in the heart and soul of every woman and man. A quest that is fierce with resolve and will not end until freedom is won for all. Voice: From the time of Moses, people enslaved others for profit and gain. When Israel was in Egypt’s land, the Israelites were oppressed so hard they could not stand. Let my people go! P: Four hundred years ago, on the shores of the new-found land which became America, people were once again enslaved for profit and gain. Let my people go! Voice: On the backs of these women and men this country was built. Let my people go! No consideration, no justice, no mercy for them. Let my people go! P: A war began that tore a country apart. The Emancipation Proclamation brought a degree of freedom but injustice and greed still persisted. Let my people go! Voice: New ways of indignities and injustices were invented: Jim Crow, Whites Only, Segregation and Red Lining. Let my people go! P: And yet, in spite of all this, women and men of color have produced so many beautiful and meaningful creations. We thank Dr. Shirley Jackson for fiber-optic cable, Lewis Latimer for carbon filament (inner light bulb), Marie Van Brittan Brown for closed-circuit television security, Otis Boykin for the pacemaker, Lonnie Johnson for the Super Soaker and thermoelectric energy converters, Charles Drew for the blood bank, Marian Croak for Voice over Internet Protocol, Lisa Gelobter for animated Gifs on the web, Philip Emeagwali – a drop out, for the world’s fastest computer, Jesse Wilkins, Jr, for the math behind gamma radiation, Garrett Morgan for the gas mask and the traffic signal, and Mary and Mildred Davidson for women’s feminine products and the walker, and Onesimus & Cotton Mather for the method that would eventually become vaccinations against infectious diseases. Appreciating these contributions as just a few among many, we pray recognizing the worth of all, and being grateful to learn what was never deemed important enough to include in our educational experiences. Voice: We pray, recognizing our true worth, and our understanding of what it means to be human. No longer unworthy exiles, we are people with a glorious cosmic history, with great responsibility, and a noble destiny. Along with everything else in the universe, we are on a journey beyond our imagining. P: We remember Jesus. He challenged us to confront any influence within us, any social, family, religious or cultural influence, that prevents us from recognizing the power within us and within all people - the power of love; a power that could join all people as one in their common dream of a better humanity. Voice: So we take this bread, as Jesus took bread, and give thanks for the wonder of the Divine in, and with us, and we eat, committing ourselves to love as Jesus loved, wholeheartedly, generously, and compassionately, so that people will see expressed in us what we have seen expressed in Jesus. P: We take this wine, and we remember Jesus drinking wine with his friends. We drink, giving our “Yes” to being on earth the heart of the Holy One. Voice: Our prayer is that Justice Rolls down like water. We have a Dream. That one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all women and men are created equal.” P: We have a dream that people of color will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. Voice: We have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight. P: This is our hope. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood and sisterhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day. Voice: From every mountainside, let freedom ring! P: To wherever the Spirit of Life and Love may lead us we give our, Amen. Prayer of Jesus (Please pray along) Colleen Our Prayer of Jesus this morning invites us to see the words and dreams of Jesus expressed in the poetry of Langston Hughes: I dream a world where man No other man will scorn, Where love will bless the earth And peace its paths adorn I dream a world where all Will know sweet freedom's way, Where greed no longer saps the soul Nor avarice blights our day. A world I dream where black or white, Whatever race you be, Will share the bounties of the earth And every man is free, Where wretchedness will hang its head And joy, like a pearl, Attends the needs of all mankind- Of such I dream, my world!

Thurman was born in 1899 and raised in the segregated South. He is recognized as one of the great spiritual leaders of the 20th century renowned for his reflections on humanity and our relationship with God. Thurman was a prolific author (writing at least 20 books); perhaps the most famous is “Jesus and the Disinherited” (1949), which deeply influenced Martin Luther King, Jr. and other leaders of the Civil Rights Movement. Thurman was the first black person to be a tenured Dean at a PWI (predominantly white institution) Boston University. He cofounded the first interracially pastored, intercultural church in the United States.

Martin Luther King, Jr. on ‘Infinite Hope’ https://guideposts.org/inspiring-stories/stories-of-faith-and-hope/martin-luther-king-jr-on-infinite-hope/ HOLLY LEBOWITZ ROSSI 2 MIN READ Today’s challenges should never stop us from imagining a better tomorrow. “We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope.” Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke these words in a Washington, D.C., address in February 1968, just two months before he was assassinated in Memphis. They echo across the decades and endure as one of the most positive messages of the great civil rights leader’s legacy—that the challenges that weigh us down today should never dissuade us from imagining a better, more just, and more love-filled future. I was taught—and I believe—that no feeling can last forever. Disappointment, sadness, embarrassment, excitement, relaxation, joy—not one of those emotional states, for better or worse, can be sustained indefinitely. But could hope be the single exception to that rule? Dr. King thought so, and the impact of that belief continues to reverberate, even a half century after his death. In his personal and public life, he endured many disappointments. Dr. King encouraged that we “accept” those challenges even as we hold onto the hope that makes his message so relevant. A disappointment or setback can put any of us in danger of giving up on our goals, hopes and dreams, whether for ourselves or for the world. Accepting that setback is simply part of the road toward what he famously called “the promised land” frees us to process our failures in a larger context of progress, connection and above all, hope. So is hope in fact “infinite?” The poet Emily Dickinson said as much in her famous verse: Hope is the thing with feathers That perches in the soul, And sings the tune without the words, And never stops at all Ebony and Ivory by Paul McCartney & Stevie Wonder https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_IeYjqL8GU Lyrics Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we?

Conversations about racism have become more mainstream, leading to increased understanding and empathy. Youth Activism: Young people are actively engaging in social justice movements, advocating for equality, and challenging discriminatory practices. Their energy and commitment can contribute to positive change over time. Policy Reforms: There is an ongoing push for policy reforms to address systemic racism. Efforts to reform criminal justice, voting rights, and other areas aim to create a more equitable society. Representation: Increasing representation of diverse voices in media, politics, and various sectors is helping to break stereotypes and promote a more inclusive narrative. Interconnected Movements: The intersectionality of various social justice movements (racial, gender, LGBTQ+, etc.) is fostering solidarity and collective efforts toward a more just and inclusive society. Education and Awareness: Educational institutions and organizations are implementing programs to educate people about the history of racism and its impacts. This knowledge can contribute to a more informed and empathetic society. Community Engagement: Many communities are actively working towards building bridges and fostering understanding between different racial and ethnic groups. Grassroots efforts can have a significant impact on improving relationships. Technology and Social Media: Social media platforms provide a space for marginalized voices to be heard and for information to be disseminated rapidly. This can lead to greater awareness and mobilization for positive change. Corporate Initiatives: Some companies are taking steps to address racial inequalities within their organizations and in the broader community. Corporate initiatives can influence societal norms and practices. Legal Advocacy: Legal organizations and advocates are working to challenge discriminatory laws and practices, leading to legal victories that promote justice and equality. While progress may be slow and challenges remain, these factors provide reasons to be hopeful for positive developments in race relationships in the U.S. MLK Speech We as a people have long dreamed of freedom, but we are still confined to an oppressive prison of segregation and discrimination.25 Must we respond to this disappointed hope with bitterness and cynicism? Certainly not, for this will only distort and poison our personality. Must we conclude that the existence of segregation is a part of the will of God, and thereby resign ourselves to the fate of oppression. Of course not, for such a course would be blasphemy, because it attributes to God something that should be attributed to the devil. Moreover, to accept passively an unjust system is to cooperate with that system; thereby the oppressed become as evil as the oppressor. Our most fruitful course of action will be to stand up with a courageous determination, moving on non-violently amid obstacles and setbacks, facing disappointments and yet clinging to the hope. It will be this determination and final refusal to be stopped that will eventually open the door of fulfillment. While still in the prison of segregation we must ask, “How can I turn this liability into an asset?” It is possible that, recognizing the necessity of suffering, we can make of it a virtue. To suffer in a righteous cause is to grow to our humanity's full stature.26 If only to save ourselves from bitterness, we need the vision to see the ordeals of this generation as the opportunity to transfigure ourselves and American society. Moreover, through our suffering in this oppressive prison and our non-violent struggle to get out of it, we may give the kind of spiritual dynamic to western civilization that it so desperately needs to survive. Of course some of us will die having not received the promise of freedom. But we must continue to move on. On the one hand we must accept the finite disappointment, but in spite of this we must maintain the infinite hope. This is the only way that we will be able to live without the fatigue of bitterness and the drain of resentment.

First Reading Linda Kaul The implications of Christmas Christmas is the celebration of small things, particular things, barely noticeable things. It is Jesus in a manger—an animal byre—the child who will grow into the voice of God that is heard around the world. It's so easy to get caught up in the magnificence of Jesus and so miss the simplicity of Jesus, the normalcy of Jesus, the invisibility of the Jesus who lives almost totally unseen, unheralded, for the first 30 years of his life. Just like us. The implications of that reality, especially at a time like Christmas with all the gifts and glitter, all the great Christmas icons and triumphant hymns—cue trumpet, hit flashing lights, turn spotlight on angels—turn real life upside down. There weren't any trumpets, the night was quiet and dark as pitch, no heavenly choir sang. It was a moment of crisis, of abandonment, of loss, of total dependence for this little family. They knew too much of what the families of the world know yet, in fact. This was a refugee family. They were homeless. In a highly communal society their survival depended on the hospitality and support of strangers. That's the real story. Where has it been for so long? Maybe we've never wanted to face the implications of this birth, its social status, its neediness. Maybe it has been so well-masked that we have never realized the demands it makes on us. It has implications for now, for the world we're in where we ourselves are turning refugees away so we can make “America first.” First in wealth. First in power. First in prominence. First in isolation from the racial reality of the rest of the world—from the pain of all of it. Isn't it time to grow beyond the fairy tale spirituality and face our own part in the drama? Aren't we the missing people in the Christmas frieze, the people absent from the beggar's birth, the real deciders of what this birth will bring? At least in our own time. Now. Isn’t it time to realize that this birth is meant to change us all? To make us the bringers of a Merry Christmas to others. —from The Monastic Way by Joan Chittister, Dec. 2018 INSPIRED Words. Second Reading Sue Bove Human Family by Maya Angelou I note the obvious differences in the human family. Some of us are serious, some thrive on comedy. Some declare their lives are lived as true profundity, and others claim they really live the real reality. The variety of our skin tones can confuse, bemuse, delight, brown and pink and beige and purple, tan and blue and white. I've sailed upon the seven seas and stopped in every land, I've seen the wonders of the world not yet one common man. I know ten thousand women called Jane and Mary Jane, but I've not seen any two who really were the same. Mirror twins are different although their features jibe, and lovers think quite different thoughts while lying side by side. We love and lose in China, we weep on England's moors, and laugh and moan in Guinea, and thrive on Spanish shores. We seek success in Finland, are born and die in Maine. In minor ways we differ, in major we're the same. I note the obvious differences between each sort and type, but we are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike. We are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike. We are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike. Inspired Words “Psalm” Marie We Are Unity.. edited by Bhanu.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THv65eAWf78t_blank Gospel Colleen Walsh-White A reading from the Gospel in the Tradition of Matthew. After the scholars were gone, God's angel showed up again in Joseph's dream and commanded, \"Get up. Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt. Stay until further notice. Herod is on the hunt for this child, and wants to kill him.\" Joseph obeyed. He got up, took the child and his mother under cover of darkness. They were out of town and well on their way by daylight. They lived in Egypt until Herod's death. This Egyptian exile fulfilled what Hosea had preached: \"I called my son out of Egypt.\" Herod, when he realized that the scholars had tricked him, flew into a rage. He commanded the murder of every little boy two years old and under who lived in Bethlehem and its surrounding hills. (He determined that age from information he'd gotten from the scholars.) Later, when Herod died, God's angel appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt: \"Up, take the child and his mother and return to Israel. All those out to murder the child are dead.\" Joseph obeyed. He got up, took the child and his mother, and reentered Israel. When he heard, though, that Archelaus had succeeded his father, Herod, as king in Judea, he was afraid to go there. But then Joseph was directed in a dream to go to the hills of Galilee. On arrival, he settled in the village of Nazareth. This move was a fulfillment of the prophetic words, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\" Inspired Words. Homily Mike Prayer of the People Margie McFadden (Slowly): We gather today, painfully aware for the need of mercy in our country and in our world. AFTER each petition there will be a prayerful silence: (allow 5 seconds) That we dwell on the simplicity of Jesus, the normalcy of Jesus, the invisibility of the Jesus who lives almost totally unseen, unheralded, for the first 30 years of his life. Just like us…we pray, For all Holy Families in moments moment of crisis, of abandonment, of loss, of total dependence... we pray, For all refugee families. They are homeless.

He questioned, he searched for meaning, he shaped his convictions, he experienced love and came to know love’s connectedness with the reality he called God. P: Standing firmly in his own religious tradition he preached good news to people dreaming of a better humanity, dreaming of reaching out to one another in the truth that binds us all. Voice: We rejoice that his teaching sets us free from imagining a punishing God and thinking we are distant from the Ultimate Light that grounds our very existence. P: We rejoice that Jesus led people to discover the sacred in the ordinary: in the crowd, in the lowly, in the everyday life, in human yearnings to be better people, in being neighbor to one another. Voice: We rejoice that his teaching set us free to believe that we give human expression to the Light and Love underpinning all that exists and giving meaning to who we are. P: Our Christmas prayer is that we may recognize and actively acknowledge the presence of the sacred in places we are reluctant to look. Voice: We are thankful for Jesus’ courage in the face of opposition and powerful influences wanting to silence him. P: We remember the night before he died when he shared a meal with his friends. He gave thanks for all the blessings in his life and shared the bread with his friends, asking them to gather in memory of him to keep his dream alive. Voice: We break bread as Jesus broke bread, mindful of the call to love generously and faithfully, whatever the cost. P: We eat this bread, giving our “Amen” to living in love, as Jesus lived in love. Voice: We take wine, mindful of our responsibility to be bearers of forgiveness, tolerance, and understanding. P: We drink, committing ourselves to allow the spirit of generosity that moved so boldly in Jesus to move in our lives. Voice: To this commitment we give our “Amen” and offer it as our Christmas gift to our family and friends our colleagues and our neighbors. Prayer of Jesus Geri Moran (Please pray at home) O Divine Birther of all that is - from the smallest particle to the vastness of the cosmos, you are present. Holy are your infinite names chanted, sung or whispered. Abba, Beloved, Divine Breath, Great Mystery, Sophia May we walk in peace, speak with tenderness, touch with compassion and love unconditionally. With gratitude for the abundance we’ve been given, may we always share with any who hunger or are in need. May we be filled with humility and regret for the times we did not reflect your love. May we always offer forgiveness to those whose words or actions have caused us pain. May we understand our individual purpose and seek to fulfill it without distraction. We pray what we believe and believe what we pray. Amen. By Colleen Walsh White 2020 Breaking of the Bread Alice or Colleen In the breaking of the bread, we know you, brother Jesus, Alleluia. In the breaking of the bread, we know you, brother Jesus, Alleluia. In the breaking of the bread, we know you, brother Jesus, Alleluia.

Lovely little people who call me Gran. There are seven of them and participating in their little lives is a source of such great joy. Each stage of their development is a wonder to behold. I particularly enjoy watching their parents as they attempt to teach these little darlings the things that they need to know about being human. One of the first things that we teach little humans is the fine art of saying thank-you. It takes a fair amount of repetition to teach a child to say thank-you. Over and over again, after giving them exactly what they want, we ask, “Can you say thank-you?” and the little darlings repeat the words “Thank-you.” Sometimes all we have to do is ask the question: “What do you say?” in order to hear the words “Thank-you” uttered in such a delightful way as to inspire us to praise them as such good little girls and boys.\n\nExpressing gratitude is a skill that all tiny little people must learn in order to develop into well-rounded human beings. Indeed, scientists insist that being grateful is a prerequisite of happiness. Happy humans it seems, are humans who embody gratitude. But there is more to gratitude than simply saying thank-you. I remember learning that gratitude includes more than simply expressing our thanks. It happened when I was about sixteen and actually noticed the beauty of a sunset and for the first time I realized that I was part of something so much bigger than myself. I know I must have seen the sunset before, but this time I actually saw the sun set. We were driving down the road, my friend Valerie and I were riding in a car driven by her mother, Lola. It was a partly over-cast day on the west coast of British Columbia. Just a few clouds. You could see the mountains off in the distance. We were chatting back and forth when all of a sudden, Lola pulled the car over to the far side of the road, switched off the engine and got out. Valerie followed her mother out of the car, so I figured I had better do the same. Val and her mother scampered down from the road and onto the beach. When they reached the water’s edge, they stopped and just looked off into the distance. Apart from a tanker-ship making its way across the horizon, I couldn’t see much of anything. Lola had the most amazing expression on her face. She positively glowed with happiness. Valerie wore a similar expression. I must have looked somewhat puzzled because Val smiled at me and said “Isn’t it the most beautiful thing you have ever seen?” This only confused me more. What were they looking at that had made them stop the car, scamper down the bank and stand there at the water’s edge on a cold autumn evening.\n\nThese happy, glowing, smiling people made me nervous. There they stood grinning from ear to ear. What were they on? And then, I saw it. For the first time in my life, I saw it. It had been there before. But I had never really seen it before. The sky was amazing. The colors were overwhelming. It almost didn’t look real. It looked like someone must have painted it that way. It was magnificent. A work of art. The most beautiful thing I have ever seen. If you’ve never seen a late October, Pacific Coast Sunset before, you’ve missed one of the great wonders of the world. Neither Emily Carr’s paintings nor picture perfect post cards do a western sunset justice.\n\nBelieve it or not, even though I had been living on the west coast for about four years, at that point I had never before really noticed just how beautiful a sunset could be. No one in my experience had ever taken the time to stop and look at one. No one had ever pointed one out to me before. I would never have dreamed of stopping a car and getting out to watch as the sun put on a show while setting. So, I stood there. Overwhelmed by it all. Amazed at just how beautiful it was. Wondering just who or what could be responsible for such a spectacular thing as this. Before long my thoughts drifted to the Creator. Actually noticing a magnificent sunset was the beginning of a journey beyond myself as the reality that I am part of something so much bigger than myself continues to permeate my being.\n\nBack then, I expressed my gratitude by very much the same way as my grandchildren are being taught to express their gratitude, simply by saying “Thank-you”. The object of the Thank-you being God. At the time, God was an old bloke up there in the sky somewhere. As my images of God changed over the years, my Thank-you’s continued to be expressed to my ever-changing images of God. But I must confess, that it was a whole lot easier to say thank-you to God when God was some big guy up there, out there somewhere? It was so much easier when I thought of God as “Father” or even as “Mother” to express my gratitude by simply mimicking the behaviour that I’d been taught as a child, “Can you say “Thank-you” Oh yes indeed I can say thank-you. “God is great, God is God, let us thank him for our food. By his hand we must be fed, Give us Lord Our Daily Bread.”\n\nIt is so much easier to say thank-you to a deity that we have personified than it is to give thanks to a deity that is Beyond the Beyond and Beyond that Also. Our thank-you’s to the One in whom we live and move and have our being, tend to be expressed in words that are so much more awkward than the simply “Thank-you Father” that sufficed when we personified God.\n\nThanksgiving is certainly easier when you personify God. I have said over and over again that there is absolutely nothing wrong with personifying God. Indeed, it is part of our human nature to personify things. Personification is how we relate to something that is not a person. Personifying God is only a problem when and if we actually begin to believe that God is a person and we then go on to worship the person who we have created. The One in whom we live and move and have our being, lives and moves in, with, through, and beyond us. Which means that each one of us is in God and God is in each one of us, so expressing or gratitude for the many blessings that we enjoy moves our attention beyond ourselves to those around us.\n\nEmbodying our thanks, takes on whole new dimensions when we begin to see God in, with, through and beyond all of creation. We all have a lot of learning to do if we are ever going to learn to give thanks to the source of our being, the One who lives and breathes in, with, through, and beyond us. When little children are learning to talk sometimes it is difficult for them to say the words, “Thank-you”. In my family, we used to encourage babies to say “ta” or “ta, ta” as a first step along the way to learning how to express their gratitude. As we learn and grow in our knowledge of the ONE who is the source of our blessings, we use words like, “LORD”, “FATHER”, “MOTHER”, “REDEEMER”, “SAVIOUR”, all perfectly good attempts at expressing the inexpressible. So, if personifying God, helps, then by all means personify God. Just remember that your personifications of God, are not God, for they will always fall short of expressing that which is beyond language.\n\nAs we continue to live into our full humanity, we will continue to learn to notice, and name our blessings, and we will learn new ways of expressing and embodying our gratitude as the LOVE that is the source of our blessings continues to flow through all things. The One we seek to offer our thanks and praise, the One who is the source of all our blessings is the one we call God.\n\nThe ancient Greek noun for God, is theos; we get our word theology from it…theology means words or ideas about God. The ancient Greek noun theos, was derived from the Greek verb theo, which means to flow. Our ancestors, described God as the Light that flows through all things. Jesus taught us that God is Love. As followers of Jesus, surely we can begin to understand God as the LOVE that flows through all things. Let our Thanksgiving celebrations open us to the realities of our many blessings and let those blessings flow through us.\n\nMay our God who is LOVE, flow in, with, through, and beyond us so that everyone may know the One who in whom we live and breathe and have our being, by our love. Let us remember that LOVE flows both ways. Just as surely as our blessings flow through us, so too, the pain of our sisters and brothers flows. Let us remember that we are intimately connected one to another. Even though the LOVE that lies at the very heart of our existence is beyond our ability to imagine, it can be embodied in the love that flows in, with, and through us. Let that LOVE who is the ONE to whom we offer our thanks and praise, flow through us.\n\nWe have been richly blessed. Can we say “Thank-you”? Absolutely, we can say thank-you by continuing to learn what it means to be LOVE in the world. Let us enjoy our Thanksgiving celebrations, by pausing from our regular routines to take some time to count our blessings, let the LOVE flow as we embrace family and friends, and then as the knowledge of our many blessings washes over us, let us act out of the abundance we share, so that the LOVE, the ONE who IS, Was, and Evermore shall be the source of our blessings might flow. Let our gratitude take on flesh and live among us, so that all may know the LOVE who is God. Let our gratitude live and breathe in, with, through, and beyond us. Let LOVE flow from each one to each one.\n\nInspired Words\n\nPsalm Mike\n\nGRATEFUL: A Love Song to the World | Empty Hands Music | nimo feat. daniel nahmod\n\nGospel Peter Arney\n\nA reading from the gospel in the tradition of John\n\nSo when the crowd realized he was gone and wasn’t coming back, they piled into the Tiberias boats and headed for Capernaum, looking for Jesus.\n\nWhen they found him back across the sea, they said, “Rabbi, when did you get here?”\n\nJesus answered, “You’ve come looking for me not because you saw God in my actions but because I fed you, filled your stomachs – and for free.\n\n“Don’t waste your energy striving for perishable food like that. Work for the food that sticks with you, food that nourishes your lasting life, food the Son of Man provides. He and what he does are guaranteed by God the Father to last.”\n\nTo that they said, “Well, what do we do then to get in on God’s works?”\n\nJesus said, “Throw your lot in with the One that God has sent. That kind of a commitment gets you in on God’s works.”\n\nThey waffled: “Why don’t you give us a clue about who you are, just a hint of what’s going on? When we see what’s up, we’ll commit ourselves. Show us what you can do.\n\nMoses fed our ancestors with bread in the desert. It says so in the Scriptures: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”\n\nJesus responded, “The real significance of that Scripture is not that Moses gave you bread from heaven but that my Father is right now offering you bread from heaven, the real bread.\n\nThe Bread of God came down out of heaven and is giving life to the world.”\n\nThey jumped at that: “Master, give us this bread, now and forever!”\n\nJesus said, “I am the Bread of Life.

Work for the food that sticks with you, food that nourishes your lasting life, food the Son of Man provides.

Show us what you can do.\n\nMoses fed our ancestors with bread in the desert.

Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks,\n\nand gave them out to all who were sitting there;\n\nhe did the same with the fish, giving out as much as they could eat.\n\nWhen they had eaten their fill, Jesus said to the disciples,\n\n“Gather up the leftovers pieces, so that nothing gets wasted.”\n\nSo they picked them up and filled twelve baskets with scraps left over from the five barley loaves.\n\nThe people, seeing this sign that Jesus had performed, said,\n\n“Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.”\n\nSeeing that they were about to come and carry him off to crown him as ruler, Jesus escaped into the hills alone.\n\nInspired Words\n\nPsalm Song Mike\n\nThe Many – We are Enough\n\nSecond Reading Teri Corso\n\nLoaves, fishes and the work of building a world where everyone has enough By Kathy Killian Noe | May 12, 2021\n\nMost of us, whether we are conscious of it or not, operate somewhere on the continuum between an assumption of abundance and an assumption of scarcity.\n\nAn assumption of abundance is a way of living with a healthy amount of trust that everything we truly need to become the people we were created to be will somehow be given. It’s a way of living with trust that everything that happens to us — even the things we never would have chosen — can somehow be used for good and as part of our becoming.\n\nThe scarcity assumption tells us that there is simply not enough to go around; not enough resources, not enough attention, not enough love, not enough opportunities, not enough forgiveness for us truly to be forgiven and not enough acceptance for us truly to be accepted, etc.\n\nThe scarcity assumption tells us, maybe on a subconscious level, “if that person is loved, I must be less loved; if that person gets attention, there won’t be enough attention for me; if that person is special then I must be less special; if that person’s basic need for health care, housing, education and employment are met, there won’t be enough to meet my basic need for housing, education health care and employment. The scarcity assumption is at the heart of the ban on refugees, and the building of a wall.\n\nThe truth is there really is the possibility of there being enough for everyone; enough love, enough attention, even enough resources to provide for every one’s basic needs. But when we operate out of the scarcity assumption, when we act as if there is not enough to go around and we act as if we are not all part of the same human family and we create policies and tax codes that reflect those assumptions, we in fact create scarcity for millions of people.\n\nOne of the miracle stories in the New Testament addresses the scarcity assumption that is part of the human condition. It’s the story of the loaves and fishes found in the gospels of Mark and Luke.\n\nJesus and his disciples, his beloved community, have gone on a silent retreat. They are tired and in need of some r and r. But when they get to the site of their retreat they discover that a huge crowd has followed them. So Jesus reaches deep within himself and discovers the energy and compassion he needs to teach the people who are starving for spiritual nourishment.\n\nNaturally, at the end of the day the people are physically hungry. The disciples come to Jesus and say, “Jesus, send these folks away into the next town so they can get some supper.”\n\nJesus said, “You feed them.”\n\nOperating out of the scarcity assumption the disciples asked, “ Seriously? Do you know how much it would cost to feed all these people?”\n\nAnd Jesus who always operated out of an assumption of abundance, asked, “how much food is there among us?”\n\nAgain, operating out of the scarcity assumption the disciples replied, “ Only five loaves and two fish filets. Clearly not enough.”\n\nSo Jesus said, “Have everyone sit down in small groups on the grass.” And then he said a blessing.\n\nNow most of us who were raised in the church were taught that the miracle that happened that day was that the loaves and fishes literally began to multiply so that everyone was able to have a fish filet sandwich and there were even lots of fish sandwiches left over.\n\nBut I think it is possible that the miracle that happened that day was this: Once everyone was seated in small circles, everyone began to see each other, really see each other.\n\nWhen we really see each other something amazing happens. We are able to see past the labels we tend to place on each other and we begin to see that the person sitting in this circle across from me is more like me than different from me. We begin to drop some of the stereotypes or judgements we hold of others. We begin to embrace as our family member the person we once saw as “the other”.\n\nSo perhaps the more profound miracle that happened that day was that once people were sitting across from each other, truly seeing each other as one’s family — instead of “ the other” … perhaps the miracle that happened was that everyone began to dig a little deeper into their own backpacks and pulled out whatever gift they had to share. What we know for sure is that there was an abundance of food; more than enough to go around.\n\nA question that is helpful to work with is: “Where in my life do I operate out of an assumption of scarcity and where do I operate out of an assumption of abundance?\n\nFor what the world desperately needs are people and communities that are operating out of an assumption of abundance; people and communities that are embodying an “alternative” to the values and assumptions of our dominant culture. And when I refer to the dominant culture I am not referring to any political party. By dominant culture I mean the power structures and scarcity assumptions that are in contrast to the way of sacrificial, self-emptying Love. I am talking about power structures and scarcity assumptions which are at work in every historical period and every political party.\n\nInspired Words\n\nHomily Mike\n\nPrayer of the People Joanne & Tom Kyritz\n\nIn humility and openness, we pray for the needs of others and then attempt to feed them.\n\nOur response will be a silent prayer for 10 seconds.\n\nWe are grateful for Jesus, who taught the disciples and us that there is always hope and that we can always finds ways to meet the needs of those around us.

Mary Magdalene, the Apostle to the Apostles, was by far Mary Ann’s favorite saint. Mary Ann died on the Feast of Mary Magdalene, July 22, 2014, ten years ago tomorrow.\n\nOne of Mary Ann’s favorite contemporary prophets is Joan Chittister. Today’s first reading is from Joan’s book, The Friendship of Women.\n\nOpening Prayer Margie\n\nLike Mary Magdalene, Apostle to the Apostles, we rejoice that our spiritual power to live the Gospel is rooted in the presence of the Divine Spirit within each of us. Like Mary, we rejoice that our oneness with the Divine frees us from rules, projections and expectations that limit our ability to be a radiant reflection of Divine love and compassion.\n\nAmen. Blessed be. May it be so.\n\nFirst Reading Marie\n\nFriendship is the linking of spirits. It is a spiritual act, not a social one. It is the finding of the remainder of the self. I am not so sure, then, that we so much find a friend as it is that friendship, the deathless search of the soul for itself, finds us. Then, the memory of Mary Magdalene becomes clear, becomes the bellwether of the real relationship.\n\nMary Magdalene is the woman whom scripture calls by name in a time when women were seldom named in public documents at all. She is, in fact, named fourteen times––more than any other woman in the New Testament except Mary of Nazareth, the mother of Jesus. She is clearly a very important, and apparently a very wealthy, woman. Most of all, she understood who Jesus was long before anyone else did, and she supported him in his wild, free-ranging, revolutionary approach to life and state and synagogue. She was, it seems, the leader of a group of women who “supported Jesus out of their own resources.” And she never left his side for the rest of his life.\n\nShe was there at the beginning of his ministry and she was there at the end. She was there when they were following him in cheering throngs. And she was there when they were taking his life, dashing it against the stones of synagogue and state, turning on him, jeering at him, shouting for his death, standing by while soldiers poked and prodded him to ignominy. She tended his grave and shouted his dying glory and clung to his soul. She knew him and she did not flinch from the knowing.\n\nThe Magdalene factor in friendship is the ability to know everything there is to know about a person, to celebrate their fortunes, to weather their straits, to chance their enemies, to accompany them in their pain and to be faithful to the end, whatever its glory, whatever its grief. The Magdalene factor is intimacy, that unshakeable immersion in the life of the other to the peak of ecstasy, to the depths of hell.\n\nThe intimacy of truth, the Magdalene factor, is about appreciation, affection, and warmth. It is as important to the married as to the single, to the elderly as to the young. It is about being deeply valued, reverently respected, lovingly tended and warmly received. It is about more than the present moment, more than the daily routine of partnership; it is about the obscure miracles and the hidden meanings of life. It is about forever.\n\nInspired words from The Friendship of Women, by Joan Chittister\n\nGospel Geri\n\nMary Magdalene, a strong and spirited woman, was a leader among the Galilean women who were disciples of Jesus. Some of the men found it difficult to share status with a woman. Others envied her privileged position. Peter and his brother Andrew complained that Jesus seemed to favor her, for he would tell her things he did not share with them. One of the women once said to Peter, “Why are you so hostile to her? She is not an adversary. If Jesus finds her worthy, who are you to reject her? The female disciples respected Mary for her competence and her wisdom. A circle formed around her of women who ministered to other women with compassion and empathy.

As we listen to the instructions from Jesus to “shrug off” in today’s Gospel let us reflect on how it applies to our own lives. May we engage willingly in the practices of silence, contemplation and mindfulness. May we always seek to meet the needs of others even when our vessels are empty. May we listen to the journey of the refugee and discern how that journey applies to the journey of our life and life of faith. We pray this and all prayer in the name of Jesus.\n\nFirst Reading Louise\n\nGospel Mark 6: 7-13\n\nJesus told them, ”A prophet has little honor in his hometown, among his relatives, on the streets he played in as a child.” Jesus wasn’t able to do much of anything there – he laid hands on a few sick people and healed them, that’s all. He couldn’t get over their stubbornness. He left and made a circuit of the other villages, teaching.\n\nJesus called the Twelve to him, and sent them out in pairs. He gave them authority and power to deal with the evil opposition. He sent them off with these instructions:\n\n“Don’t think you need a lot of extra equipment for this. You are the equipment. No special appeals for funds. Keep it simple.\n\n“And no luxury inns. Get a modest place and be content there until you leave.\n\n“If you’re not welcomed, not listened to, quietly withdraw. Don’t make a scene. Shrug your shoulders and be on your way.”\n\nThen they were on the road. They preached with joyful urgency that life can be radically different; right and left they sent the demons packing; they brought wellness to the sick, anointing their bodies, healing their spirits.\n\nInspired Words\n\nFrom This Transforming Word, scripture passage from The Message: Catholic Ecumenical Edition, by Eugene Peterson\n\nSecond Reading Geri\n\nThe Gift of Silence\n\nFor Richard Rohr, silence is a foundation upon which we can build our lives:\n\nSilence is not just that which happens around words and underneath images and events. It has a life of its own. It’s a phenomenon with an almost physical identity. It is a being in itself to which we can relate. Philosophically, we would say being is that foundational quality which precedes all other attributes. When we relate to the naked being of a thing, we learn to know it at its core. Silence is somehow at the very foundation of all reality. It is that out of which all being comes and to which all things return.\n\nSilence precedes, undergirds, and grounds everything. We cannot just think of it as an accident, or as something unnecessary. Unless we learn how to live there, go there, abide in this different phenomenon, the rest of things—words, events, relationships, identities—become rather superficial, without depth or context. They lose meaning, so we end up searching for more events and situations which must increasingly contain ever-higher stimulation, more excitement, and more color to add vital signs to our inherently bored and boring existence. Really, the simplest and most stripped-down things ironically have the power to give us the greatest happiness—if we respect them as such. Silence is the essence of simple and stripped down.\n\nWe need to experience silence as a living presence which is primordial and primal in itself, and then see all other things—now experienced deeply—inside of that container. Silence is not just an absence, but also a presence. Silence surrounds every “I know” event with a humble and patient “I don’t know.” It protects the autonomy and dignity of events, persons, animals, and all things.\n\nWe must find a way to return to this place, to live in this place, to abide in this place of inner silence. Outer silence means very little if there is not a deeper inner silence. Everything else appears much clearer when it appears or emerges out of a previous silence. When I use the word appear, I mean that silence takes on reality, substance, significance, or meaning. Without silence around a thing, which is a mystery, it can be difficult to find a meaning that lasts. It’s just another event in a sequence of ever-quicker events, which we call our lives.\n\nWithout silence, we do not really experience our experiences. We have many experiences, but they do not have the power to change us, to awaken us, to give us that joy or “peace that the world cannot give,” as Jesus says (John 14:27).\n\nInspired Words\n\nMonday, July 1, 2024\n\nReference:\n\nAdapted from Richard Rohr, Silent Compassion: Finding God in Contemplation,\n\nPsalm Song Maryann slides are done\n\nLife Is a Journey by Monks of Weston Priory from Move with one Heart\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD-toQFbtrg for the tune.\n\nRefrain:\n\nLife is a journey we travel together,\n\nwalking hand in hand\n\nwith our sisters and brothers.\n\nOur lives though diff’rent are interwoven,\n\ncreating a beautiful weaving of love in our world.\n\n1.

He owned his own business back in El Salvador. But he was threatened and physically harmed on multiple occasions by organized crime members that demanded a large portion of his money in exchange for safety. Unable to pay them and provide for his family, William was set on fire. So, he gave up his business and spent the last few years recovering from the burns and selling fruit on the streets. But that did not provide enough to feed his wife and children.\n\nWilliam left El Salvador with his mom and a group of friends, leaving behind his wife and children, to find the freedom to work and provide for them. They have been on the road for more than a month. As they have been walking, he has organized an internal census to make sure no one gets lost in the process and everyone receives what they need. He coordinated a team of people to write down the names of those sleeping in the same area. And he has asked them to survey families regarding their needs. Some have shoes or diapers written next to their names. William makes sure that when donations arrive, they are given to those who are most in need. He also ensures rules at shelters are respected and he serves as a mediator when conflict arises. He is trusted by the group to represent them in meetings with local authorities. And while William is still unable to provide for his family, he is beginning to live into the freedom he desired by serving this group of Central American families in search of security.\n\nWe met this group in Mexico City on the day the largest provisional shelter in the city closed down. They were in transit to a new shelter, La Casa del Peregrino, The Pilgrim’s Home.\n\nLike other liminal spaces, La Casa del Peregrino is a space where the inevitable tensions of life are made more evident. They are in a safer space to lay their heads but not in a fully stable place to rest. At the shelter, they find themselves in between the land they left and the land in which they hope to live.\n\nChristians are called to live our faith as aliens in this land. It is no mistake the experience of migration is the chosen metaphor for our life of faith. Migrant people set out with hope and a vision for something different. They are able to imagine new and better realities — that in itself is prophetic. It is the kind of imagination our faith so desperately needs. Migrant people must adapt to the new environments they encounter, and they are willing to make many sacrifices in the journey as they keep the hope of a new reality in mind. In this way, they are a model for the North American church.\n\nIn the Christian faith, we often talk about the now and not yet reality of the kingdom of God. By their mere embodied experience, those we met with on their journey showed us how to live in that tension. They are no longer bound by the circumstances that oppressed them at home, but they are not quite in a space where they can live life to the fullest. So they journey on, waking up one more day, entrusting their lives to God, to the people around them, to their own strength to imagine and forge a new reality.\n\nMigrant people hold the now and the not yet in tension. In the midst of waiting to make it up north and taking their turn for a credible fear interview at the border, life continues. People find ways to feel alive, to keep hope alive. At La Casa del Peregrino, holding on to hope looked like doing karaoke, coloring banners, and making beaded bracelets. They were not devoid of life.\n\nFor the North American church, this is a key moment to respond responsibly and humanely to the journey of those who have risked all that they may walk into a better tomorrow. How we live out our faith will mark us. Whether we advocate for and welcome these families will not only reveal the content of our faith but will have major implications on how the glimpses of the kingdom continue to appear among migrant families.\n\nOf course, not all people on this journey have the same story. But we are not asked to distinguish who to help. We are called to risk loving our neighbor regardless of who our neighbor is.\n\nInspired words\n\nDEC 12, 2018\n\nHomily Mike\n\nPrayer of the People Tom Schaller\n\nJesus sent out his disciples without a degree in theology, without a certificate from the diocesan training program, and without a catechism. Two by two, they walked along with no more than a pair of sandals and a walking stick, both crucial to keep them on the journey. With so little, they still summoned the authority to cast demons, heal the sick, and preach repentance. Today we pray for us to do the same.\n\nOur response will be: What is mine to do?\n\nJesus sent out the apostles in pairs, because being connected to others is key to bringing the kindom on earth. Today we pray for those who are lonely, who have no support system and who go through life alone. We respond… What is mine to do?\n\nLike everyone in his culture, Mark, the gospel writer, presumes demons cause physical and psychological problems. Paralyzed or mentally ill persons were seen as being diabolically possessed. So when Jesus sends out his disciples to have authority over unclean spirits, he is asking them to treat the people they meet with respect and equality. Today, may we see the Divine in everyone we meet. We respond… What is mine to do?\n\nThe disciples are to stay in one place, because the message is more important than their accommodations and because it takes time to share the message and have it deepen and grow. May we be aware of the time we take to share Jesus’ message and of how we enable it to grow. We respond… What is mine to do?\n\nThe disciples are to take nothing but a walking stick and sandals. No food, no bag and no money. When we follow Jesus and bring his message to others, may we leave behind our fear of being unqualified, our fear of not being able to perform, our fear of not knowing what to say and do, our fear of being rejected, our fear of being humiliated. We respond… What is mine to do?\n\nWhen our spiritual path seems like a dead-end and when we feel life is happening to us, not through us, may we locate our walking stick and sandals and just keep going on the path. We respond… What is mine to do?\n\nFor our sisters and brothers in Sophia, in our sister parishes in Rochester and Fort Meyers, for all those involved with Pathways to Prosperity and for our sisters and brothers in Voice of the Faithful, FCM and RAMP, may they know of our love and care for them. May they continue to do good as they follow the Way of Jesus… We respond… What is mine to do?\n\nFor what else shall we pray? Allow 4 petitions.\n\nWhen we are called to journey outside of our comfort zone, may we remember that the Divine is with us on the journey.\n\nWe pray this and all prayer in the name of Jesus.

Faith is good. Yet even as we are celebrating Independence Day, they are not the same thing, and they should never be blended and abused to become tools of empire, theocracy, or right-wing oppression.\n\nThis Fourth of July, Faithful America and many other Christian organizations are coming together in solidarity against Christian Nationalism. These are not voices crying out in the wilderness. The chorus of Christians speaking out against Christian Nationalism is growing. In addition to individual leaders critiquing the ideology, institutional voices are also expressing their concerns. We in Sophia are joining this collective, prophetic, voice to learn, to pray, and to take a stand against the hijacking of the Christian faith.\n\nThe liturgical Gospel this week is Mark 6:1-6, where Jesus is not accepted in his hometown. Those who should have accepted and loved him the most were not interested in his message. In the same way, it seems that Christian Nationalists have no need for the true teachings of Jesus in their religion. They twist and distort Jesus’s message of love as they “other” so many in our society…immigrants, people of color, members of the LGBTQ community … actually anyone who sees things differently than they do. Our readings today are about people who, like Jesus, are no longer at home in their “homes” due to this hateful ideology. We pray for them and all who are hurt. May we continue to stand against Christian Nationalism and stand up for love.\n\nOpening Song Margie\n\nWe Stand by the Many\n\nWisdom Bowl Margie\n\nOpening Prayer Mike\n\nChange can only come when we all speak out with a collective prophetic voice — which means you’re making a difference. Together, we will reject hatred, political violence, Christofascism, and the hijacking of Jesus’s name for partisan politics — and in their place take a prophetic, Jesus-like stance for peace, faith, hope, and love.\n\nRecognizing the scope and urgency of this situation, we send our positive energy and healing love for our nation and our leaders that those seeking absolute power may not prevail and that our democratic republic may not end. Amen.\n\nReading One (part 1) Colleen\n\nThe Day My Old Church Canceled Me Was a Very Sad Day\n\nby David French, modified slightly for brevity\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/opinion/presbyterian-church-evangelical-canceled.html\n\nThis week, the leaders of the Presbyterian Church in America are gathering in Richmond, Va., for their annual General Assembly. The Presbyterian Church in America is a small, theologically conservative Christian denomination that was my family’s church home for more than 15 years.\n\nIt just canceled me.\n\nOur family joined the P.C.A. denomination in 2004. At the time, the denomination fit us perfectly. I’m conservative theologically and politically, and in 2004 I was still a partisan Republican. At the same time, however, I perceived the denomination as relatively apolitical. I never heard political messages from the pulpit, and I worshiped alongside Democratic friends.\n\nWhen we moved to Tennessee in 2006, we selected our house in part because it was close to a P.C.A. church, and that church became the center of our lives. On Sundays we attended services, and Monday through Friday our kids attended the school our church founded and supported. We loved the people in that church, and they loved us. When I deployed to Iraq in 2007, the entire church rallied to support my family and to support the men I served with. They flooded our small forward operating base with care packages, and back home, members of the church helped my wife and children with meals, car repairs and plenty of love and companionship in anxious times.\n\nTwo things happened that changed our lives, however, and in hindsight they’re related. First, in 2010, we adopted a 2-year-old girl from Ethiopia. Second, in 2015, Donald Trump announced his presidential campaign.\n\nThere was no way I could support Trump. It wasn’t just his obvious lack of character that troubled me; he was opening the door to a level of extremism and malice in Republican politics that I’d never encountered. Trump’s rise coincided with the rise of the alt-right.\n\nI was a senior writer for National Review at the time, and when I wrote pieces critical of Trump, members of the alt-right pounced, and they attacked us through our daughter. They pulled pictures of her from social media and photoshopped her into gas chambers and lynchings. Trolls found my wife’s blog on a religious website called Patheos and filled the comments section with gruesome pictures of dead and dying Black victims of crime and war. We also received direct threats.\n\nThe experience was shocking. At times, it was terrifying. And so we did what we always did in times of trouble: We turned to our church for support and comfort. Our pastors and close friends came to our aid, but support was hardly universal. The church as a whole did not respond the way it did when I deployed. Instead, we began encountering racism and hatred up close, from people in our church and in our church school.\n\nThe racism was grotesque. One church member asked my wife why we couldn’t adopt from Norway rather than Ethiopia. A teacher at the school asked my son if we had purchased his sister for a “loaf of bread.” There were terrible incidents of peer racism, including a student telling my daughter that slavery was good for Black people because it taught them how to live in America. Another told her that she couldn’t come to our house to play because “my dad said Black people are dangerous.”\n\nThere were disturbing political confrontations. A church elder came up to my wife and me after one service to criticize our opposition to Trump and told me to “get your wife under control” after she contrasted his support for Trump with his opposition to Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky affair. Another man confronted me at the communion table.\n\nPsalm Margie\n\nI Won’t Back Down\n\nReading One (part 2) Kathy\n\nWe also began to see the denomination itself with new eyes. To my shame, the racism and extremism within the denomination were invisible to us before our own ordeal. But there is a faction of explicitly authoritarian Christian nationalists in the church, and some of that Christian nationalism has disturbing racial elements underpinning it.\n\nIn 2022 a member of the denomination who has since left it published “The Case for Christian Nationalism,” one of the most popular Christian nationalist books of the Trump era. It argues that “no nation (properly conceived) is composed of two or more ethnicities” and that “to exclude an out-group is to recognize a universal good for man.”\n\nI do not want to paint with too broad a brush. Our pastors and close friends continued to stand with us. Our church disciplined the man who confronted me about Trump during communion. And most church members didn’t follow politics closely and had no idea about any of the attacks we faced.\n\nBut for us, church no longer felt like home. We could withstand the trolls online. We could guard against physical threats. But it was hard to live without any respite, and the targeting of my children was a bridge too far. So we left for a wonderful multiethnic church in Nashville. We didn’t leave Christianity; we left a church that inflicted harm on my family.\n\nI still have many friends in the Presbyterian Church in America, people who are fighting the very forces that drove us from the church. In March, one of those friends reached out and asked if I’d join a panel at this year’s General Assembly. I agreed to come. The P.C.A. extended a formal invitation for me to join a panel with three church elders to speak at a session before the main event. I knew the invitation would be controversial. Members of the denomination have continued to attack me online. But that was part of the point of the panel. My experience was directly relevant to others who might find themselves in the cross hairs of extremists.\n\nThe anger against me wasn’t simply over my opposition to Trump. It was directly related to the authoritarian turn in white evangelical politics. My commitment to individual liberty and pluralism means that I defend the civil liberties of all Americans, including people with whom I have substantial disagreements. A number of Republican evangelicals are furious at me, for example, for defending the civil liberties of drag queens and L.G.B.T.Q. families. A writer for The Federalist ranted that granting me a platform was akin to “giving the wolf a brand-new wool coat and microphone and daring the sheep to object.”\n\nThe panel was announced on May 9. On May 14, the denomination caved. It canceled the panel, and in its public statement, I was to blame. I was sacrificed on the altar of peace and unity. But it is a false peace and a false unity if extremists can bully a family out of a church and then block the church from hearing one of its former members describe his experience. It is a false peace and a false unity if it is preserved by granting the most malicious members of the congregation veto power over church events.\n\nWhen I left the Republican Party, I thought a shared faith would preserve my denominational home. But I was wrong. Race and politics trumped truth and grace, and now I’m no longer welcome in the church I loved.\n\nInspired words\n\nReading Two Margie\n\nFamilies of trans children – no longer “at home” in their state of Missouri\n\nhttps://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/republicans-are-waging-a-war-on-my-family-father-of-trans-kid-says-174205509924\n\nHomily Mike\n\nPrayers of the People Judy L\n\nAs followers of the Christian tradition, our faith teaches us everyone is created in God’s image and commands us to love one another. As Americans, we value our system of government and the good that can be accomplished in our constitutional democracy. Today, we are concerned about a persistent threat to both our religious communities and our democracy – Christian Nationalism.\n\nChristian nationalism seeks to merge Christian and American identities, distorting both the Christian faith and America’s constitutional democracy. Christian nationalism demands Christianity be privileged by the State and implies that to be a good American, one must be Christian. It often overlaps with and provides cover for white supremacy and racial subjugation.\n\nThose fighting this issue, including Faithful America, reject this damaging political ideology. They invite others to join them in opposing this threat to our faith and to our nation. Today’s Prayer of the People will be the Statement which they are asking people to sign against Christian Nationalism. We will hear each tenant, and then have a moment for silent reflection and prayer,\n\nAs followers of the Christian tradition, we are bound not by citizenship, but by the teachings of Jesus. We believe that:\n\nPeople of all faiths and none have the right and responsibility to engage\n\nconstructively in the public square. (pause)\n\nPatriotism does not require us to minimize our religious convictions. (pause)\n\nOne’s religious affiliation, or lack thereof, should be irrelevant to one’s standing\n\nin the civic community. (pause)\n\nGovernment should not prefer one religion over another or religion over nonreligion. (pause)\n\nReligious instruction is best left to our houses of worship, other religious institutions, and families. (pause)\n\nAmerica’s historic commitment to religious pluralism enables faith communities to live in civic harmony with one another without sacrificing our theological convictions. (pause)\n\nConflating religious authority with political authority is idolatrous and often leads to oppression of minority and other marginalized groups as well as the spiritual\n\nimpoverishment of religion. (pause)\n\nWe must stand up to and speak out against Christian nationalism, especially when it inspires acts of violence and intimidation—including vandalism, bomb threats, arson, hate crimes, and attacks on houses of worship—against religious\n\ncommunities at home and abroad. (pause)\n\nWhether we worship at a church, mosque, synagogue, or temple, America has no second-class faiths. All are equal under the U.S. Constitution. As Christians, we must speak in one voice condemning Christian nationalism as a distortion of the gospel of Jesus and a threat to American democracy. (pause)\n\nFor our sisters and brothers in Sophia, in our sister parish in Rochester, for all those involved with Pathways to Prosperity and for our sisters and brothers in Voice of the Faithful, FCM and RAMP, may they know of our love and care for them. May they continue to do good as they follow the Way of Jesus. (pause)\n\nFor what else shall we pray? Please respond with a silent prayer.\n\n(Allow up to 4 petitions.)\n\nMay we as individuals and as a community help to raise a prophetic voice against Christian nationalism. May we continue both to pray for, and do the work of: love, peace, truth, equality, and justice in our lives. Amen.\n\nAnyone moved to sign Faithful America’s statement can find it here:\n\nhttps://www.christiansagainstchristiannationalism.org/statement\n\nSharing of Peace Mike\n\nBlessing of Bread and Wine Joan\n\nWe are grateful – for this bread,\n\nWhich earth has given and human hands have formed.\n\nThis bread nourishes our spirit.\n\nWe are grateful – for this wine,\n\nFruit of the vine and work of human hands.\n\nIt is our spiritual drink.\n\nEucharistic Liturgy (Please pray Voice part in your home) Mike & Linda S\n\nPresider: This year as we celebrate the Fourth of July, we are keenly aware of the threats to both our faith and our country. May our concerns lead us to be more and more open to the Divine’s call.\n\nVoice: As we reflect on the life and true mission of Jesus, may we follow his way of addressing inequity and corruption powerfully, while still having compassion for those who see things differently than he did.\n\nPresider: The creation of a better world is what Jesus lived for,\n\nwhat he longed to see,\n\nwhat he spoke about day after day,\n\nwhat he was willing to die for.\n\nVoice: Like Jesus, we commit ourselves to give the energizing Spirit within us, the most faithful and courageous expression that each of us can.\n\nPresider: We gather to share bread and wine,\n\ncommitting ourselves to keeping his dream,\n\nand the dreams of many other voices, alive in today’s world.\n\nVoice: We eat and drink, committing ourselves to add our voices and our efforts to those countless people before us\n\nwho dreamed of a better world and actively worked to achieve it.\n\nPresider: We seek to give shape to Jesus’ dream,\n\nto his desire that we would take responsibility for working together,\n\nfor directing our energies “first and foremost” to making a difference for good in the world.\n\nVoice: We pray, inviting the Spirit of Life, Love and Goodness to move free in our words and actions. To this, we give our Amen!\n\nmodified from Michael Morwood, First and Foremost\n\nPrayers for Progressive Christians, pages110-111\n\nThe Prayer of Jesus Maryann\n\nGreat divine spirit of love that is at the core of everything and from which all life flows,\n\nWe acknowledge this healing and transforming power.\n\nMay the spirit of unconditional love and forgiveness flow through each of us and enable the realm of love to spread throughout the world.\n\nLike the flowers in the fields, may we have the basics we need to live\n\nand may we have the love and commitment to ensure that others have\n\nwhat they need too.\n\nMay we have the courage to acknowledge when we have done wrong, to seek forgiveness from those we have hurt and to forgive those who have hurt us,\n\nso that we may be reconciled.\n\nWe acknowledge the power of self-giving love to transform individual hearts and the world.\n\nWe recommit ourselves to the unconditional love of others and the work of justice and peace. Amen.\n\nA 21st Century Lord’s Prayer by Roger Courtney adapted by Maryann Crilly\n\nBreaking of the Bread Alice or Colleen\n\nIn the breaking of the bread, we know you, brother Jesus, Alleluia.\n\nIn the breaking of the bread, we know you, brother Jesus, Alleluia.\n\nIn the breaking of the bread, we know you, brother Jesus, Alleluia.\n\nCommunion Mike\n\nPresider: “…happy are we to share in this meal”\n\nAll: Our sharing in this meal is a sign of our gratitude and commitment to be one with Jesus.\n\nWhen sharing the bread: “This is, and you are, the bread of life”\n\nPresider: With great joy, we state.\n\nAll: We are followers of Jesus.\n\nWhen sharing the cup: “The cup of the Covenant”\n\nCommunion Song Margie\n\nAmen by Beyoncé, from Cowboy Carter\n\nBeyoncé, the R&B and pop megastar, dropped Cowboy Carter, her first country music album, in March and it shook the music industry and pop culture. But Cowboy Carter is more than just music – it’s a provocative piece of cultural criticism calling out white privilege and nationalism and deconstructing the silos of societal genres.\n\n“Amen”\n\nBeyoncé concludes this album, a requiem, with “Amen.” With big vocal harmonies over church piano chords, Beyoncé delivers a rousing speech, like a general to her freedom fighters. “Amen” is a battle cry, a warning to the white Christian Nationalists trying to rewrite our history, take away voting rights, and convince us that oppression is good and divinely sanctioned. “Amen” says we know the truth; we won’t let them warp faith into a weapon. We are singing a death song, a requiem, to those old ideas and white supremacy. America is our country. Our ancestors built it. We are the patriots. The future is ours.\n\nCommentary link:\n\nClosing Prayer Mike\n\nIt is an illusion that we are powerless. It is an illusion that someone else is responsible. It is an illusion that we cannot transcend these dualities and differences that are making a mockery of democracy. We are the people. This is our world. And every movement that ever led to any change in this ever-evolving civilization grew like a seed from one person’s imagination.\n\nAnd what did that person have—a deeply-rooted sense of what’s right; a commitment to truth-telling, to heart-sharing, to bridge-building; an ability to inspire, to breathe life into the hearts and minds of others. No matter how brilliant our attempts to inform, it is our ability to inspire that will turn the tides.\n\nThis morning we pray, individually and collectively, to have the strength and vision to make a difference, to be the change makers in this fragile time. We have faith and confidence that by standing in solidarity against Christian Nationalism we can be the inspiration to give Jesus a home in Christianity once again. Amen.\n\nby Jan Phillips, taken & modified from The Art of Original Thinking\n\nSending Forth Song Margie\n\nStanding in the Breach by Jackson Browne\n\nAnnouncements\n\nEucharistic Liturgy – 13th Sunday of Ordinary Time June 30, 2024\n\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/UTVQmsuJX-z-xBPIj4rSQ6W6vg5j__VFhYmuAotCDPKjYAUAwqEK7hiyeZjDp_Jt.p77hxk48RN8LKfKj?startTime=1719756105000\n\nTheme: Jesus, Standing Up for The Other\n\nWe pray for those individuals in need Mike\n\nOpening Song Mike\n\n“In June of 2015, we as a band decided that our LGBTQ community deserved a new song for Pride week,” said Muna’s Katie Gavin.
