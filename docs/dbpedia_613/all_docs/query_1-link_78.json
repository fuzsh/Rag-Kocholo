Emeagwali, 48, is one of those named to the 2003 list of the 50 Most Important African-Americans in Technology. His website is also part of a new teaching curriculum called “The Soul of Technology” and a related exhibit at the African-American Museum and Library in Oakland running through May 15, 2003. A native of Nigeria, Emeagwali won the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for his work with supercomputers."
