        "text": "Millions of students drop out of high school every year around the world, making them ineligible for most high paying jobs.\n\nIn Nigeria, there are some 10.5 million kids out of school, making the country a world record holder with highest number of its young people out of school.\n\nTime, the very influential US weekly magazine said that it’s by no means considered the path to success.\n\nBut Tumblr founder David Karp dropped out of high school at the age of 15 and told Forbes he doesn’t recommend it to others since he missed out on so much — some people made the most of their time outside the hallowed halls of school.\n\nHere is the special breed of super successful people that overcame their “high-school dropout” status and turned the world on its head.\n\nPhilip Emeagwali dropped out at 13\n\nCalled an “unsung hero of the Internet,” the supercomputer scientist dropped out of high-school in Nigeria due to war conditions and lack of tuition money.\n\nAccording to Time, he was considered a math prodigy and continued to study on his own, earning an equivalency diploma and later a scholarship to Oregon College of Education in the U.S.\n\nIn 1987, Emeagwali came up with the formula for allowing a large number of computers to communicate at once.\n\nThe record-breaking experiment was a practical and inexpensive way to use machines to speak to each other all over the world.\n\nRichard Branson dropped out at 15\n\nThe Virgin Group founder is an international powerhouse currently worth about $4.9 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nBranson founded his first business, Student magazine, after dropping out of high school at 15 and has spoken out against the university system on his blog.\n\nNearly 50 years after dropping out, he has overseen approximately 500 companies, with his brand currently on somewhere between 200 and 300 of them.\n\nDavid Karp dropped out at 15\n\nAt the age of 15, Karp dropped out of an elite Bronx High School of Science and developed Tumblr, the blog-hosting and social network company, in 2007 in the “back bedroom of his mother’s modest Manhattan apartment.”\n\nHe sold the blog-hosting company to Yahoo for $1.1 billion in 2013, when his net worth reportedly exceeded $200 million, and he remains as the company’s CEO.\n\nAretha Franklin dropped out at 15\n\nRegarded as a child prodigy, Franklin recorded her first tracks at age 14 and performed with her father’s traveling Gospel revival show, according to Bio. She dropped out of high school at 15 to care for her first child.\n\nFranklin has since received numerous honorary degrees from universities like Harvard, Princeton, Yale, and the Berklee College of Music.\n\nIn 1987, Franklin became the first female artist to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. She has sung at the inauguration of three U.S. presidents, including Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\nFranklin has 18 Grammys under her belt, and in 1994 was honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nJoe Lewis dropped out at 15\n\nLewis dropped out of high school at 15 to run his father’s catering business, Tavistock Banqueting, and is currently worth about $5.3 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nThe businessman — who works from his yacht most of the year — owns a planned community in Lake Nona, near Orlando, which is now one of the fastest-growing developments in America and houses a medical city that includes the University of Central Florida College of Medicine and Health Sciences Campus, Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, the Orlando VA Medical Center, and a University of Florida Research and Academic Center.\n\nAs the main investor in Tavistock Group, Lewis owns more than 200 companies, according to Forbes, including London Premiership soccer team Tottenham Hotspur (Spurs), a stake in U.K.’s largest pub operator, Mitchell’s & Butlers plc, and approximately 135 restaurants and various resorts throughout the world.\n\nHe also has a covetable art collection that includes works by Picasso, Matisse, Lucian Freud, and Francis Bacon.\n\nMike Hudack dropped out at 16\n\nHudack dropped out of high school and started working at a small internet security and privacy company in Connecticut at 16. He then moved to New York and worked as a consultant for Time Warner.\n\nIn 2005, he founded Blip.tv, a hosting platform for creators of digital video content. In 2012, he left his position as CEO to become Facebook’s product manager.\n\nQuentin Tarantino dropped out at 15\n\nThe Oscar winner attended Narbonne High School in Harbor City, California, until he dropped out at the age of 15 and started working as an usher at an adult film theater while taking acting classes, according to Bio.\n\nWhile working at the Video Archives in his early 20s, Tarantino wrote the scripts for True Romance and Natural Born Killers, but it was his directorial debut in Reservoir Dogs in 1992 that won him wide critical acclaim.\n\nHe’s been nominated for several Academy Awards and is the winner of two — for Django Unchained and Pulp Fiction.\n\nFrancois Pinault dropped out at 11\n\nAccording to Forbes, the French businessman dropped out of his private high school in 1947 to work at his father’s lumber mill in part because his school mates made fun of his poor background.\n\nToday, as the majority shareholder of fashion conglomerate PPR, the billionaire businessman owns high-end fashion houses including Gucci, Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen, and Yves Saint Laurent.\n\nHe also owns Christie’s Auction House and is currently worth around $12.9 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nDavid H. Murdock dropped out at 14\n\nThe self-made billionaire businessman dropped out of high school in the ninth grade and worked at a gas station before being drafted into the Army in 1943, according to Forbes.\n\nAfter World War II, Murdock bought his first business, a Detroit diner, and sold it several months later for a $700 profit. Now, after a lifetime of buying, building and selling, he’s worth an estimated $2.9 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nThe Dole Foods CEO took the company private in 2013 in a deal that valued the company at $1.6 billion.\n\nAt 92, Murdock is somewhat of a health nut — he told the New York Times he swore off red meat long ago and eats as many as 20 fruits and vegetables a day, going so far as to pulverize banana peels and orange rinds into the smoothies he drinks two to three times a day — and he says he wants to live forever.\n\nGeorge Foreman dropped out at 15\n\nForeman dropped out of school in the ninth grade and ran with street gangs until he joined the Job Corps in 1965, where he first started training as a boxer, according to Bio.\n\nHe has been inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame and the International Boxing Hall of Fame as a two-time World Heavyweight Champion and Olympic gold medalist.\n\nMost of Foreman’s fortune came after his boxing career as a spokesperson for Russell Hobbs Inc.’s fat-reducing grill called the George Foreman Grill, which has earned him an estimated net worth of $250 million, according to TheRichest.\n\nJames H. Clark dropped out at 16\n\nThe self-made billionaire American businessman and cofounder of Netscape dropped out of high school at 16 after getting into some trouble and joined the U.S. Navy, where he earned his high school equivalency degree, began learning about electronics, and made money on the side by loan-sharking cash to other recruits at interest rates of 40%, according to Forbes.\n\nConsidered the first Internet billionaire, Clark’s timely investments in companies like Apple, Facebook, and Twitter have earned him an estimated current worth of about 1.85 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nHis philanthropic efforts include financially backing the Japanese dolphin hunting documentary, The Cove and pledging $60 million toward science research in 2013.\n\nGuild of Corporate Online Publishers (GOCOP) has condemned, in very strong terms, the serial attacks on journalists covering the #EndBadGovernance nationwide protest, describing the act as undemocratic and repressive.\n\nGOCOP noted that journalists are partners in national development as well as critical stakeholders in the advancement of democracy and civil liberties and therefore deserve to be protected, and not suppressed as the security agents tried to do during the protest.\n\nThe body of online publishers specifically called on relevant authorities in Nigeria, especially security agencies, to see journalists as partners and voices of the voiceless rather than treat them as meddlesome interlopers and enemies of the people.\n\nCiting growing harassment of journalists including the denial of their fundamental right to life in the course of discharging their duties, GOCOP appealed to Nigerian security agencies to ensure the safety of all journalists especially during protests, riots and elections.\n\nGOCOP said the media has the capacity to support peace and reconciliation processes among political actors, between leaders and their followers and among the various ethnic nationalities in the country, hence should be allowed to play its constitutional role.\n\nAggregating statistics from various media reports, GOCOP said over 30 journalists had been attacked across the country during the protest which commenced on August 1.\n\nMedia houses which have had their staffers attacked with their tools (phones and cameras either seized or destroyed) include Premium Times, Daily Independent, Punch, TVC News, Guardian, Pointer newspaper, among others.\n\nGOCOP acknowledged the right of citizens to protest but cautions that on no account should any protest go beyond the bounds of peace and turn violent thereby creating opportunity for looters and hoodlums to hijack what was intended to be a peaceful show of anger against bad governance.\n\nWhile GOCOP condemned the violence that attended the protests in some parts of the country, it urges the security agencies to investigate, arrest and prosecute those found culpable in visiting mayhem and destruction on the nation and the citizenry.\n\nGOCOP also strongly condemned the subversive actions of some disgruntled Nigerians in cahoots with foreigners who during the protest sewed, distributed and flew Russian flags in some states and called for unconstitutional change of government.\n\nGOCOP sees such act as not only subversive but a direct affront on the sovereignty of the nation.\n\nIt called on the Federal Government to ensure the diligent prosecution of those involved in such act that impugns the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Nigeria.\n\nGOCOP appealed to President Bola Tinubu who for most part of his life championed the cause of democracy and independence of the media to prevail on the Service Chiefs and the Inspector General of Police to stop forthwith any form of harassment, intimidation, attack and arrest of journalists legitimately discharging their constitutionally assigned duties.\n\nMedia suppression does not only project Nigeria in bad light, it portrays the Tinubu government as a dictatorship in a democracy.\n\nGOCOP urged journalists to remain steadfast in the discharge of their duties by operating within the ambit of professionalism, fairness and factuality."
