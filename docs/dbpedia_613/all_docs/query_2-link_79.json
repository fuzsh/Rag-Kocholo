lectures.\n\nVideo:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny5Yiu34FJo&t=7s\n\nhttps://YouTube.com/emeagwali\n\nPodcast: https://SoundCloud.com/emeagwali\n\nHow I Invented a New Internet\n\nOn the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nthe US Independence Day,\n\nI—Philip Emeagwali—\n\nexperimentally discovered\n\nhow to build a new supercomputer\n\nthat is a new internet\n\nthat encircled the globe\n\nin the way\n\nour planetary-sized internet\n\ndoes.\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nhow to build that new internet\n\nand do so from an ensemble of\n\ncommodity-off-the-shelf processors\n\nthat were identical\n\nand that were equal distances\n\napart.\n\nThat new knowledge\n\nwas knowing my new internet\n\nas a global network\n\nof 1,048,576 email wires\n\nthat I visualized\n\nas tightly circumscribing\n\nthe hypersurface of a hyper-globe\n\nin a sixteen-dimensional hyperspace.\n\nMy experimental discovery\n\nof massively parallel processing\n\nthat occurred around that new internet\n\nand that occurred\n\non the Fourth of July 1989\n\nmade the news headlines\n\nand was reported in the June 20, 1990 issue\n\nof The Wall Street Journal.\n\nEleven years later,\n\nthat experimental discovery\n\nof a new internet\n\nthat is also a new supercomputer\n\nwas reconfirmed\n\nby then President Bill Clinton\n\nand reconfirmed\n\nin his presidential lecture\n\nof August 26, 2000.\n\nThat presidential lecture was delivered\n\nto the Nigerian parliament\n\nin Abuja, Nigeria.\n\nPhilip Emeagwali’s Discoveries\n\nFor me, and by the late 1980s,\n\nAmdahl’s Law\n\n—that, de facto, said that\n\nparallel processing\n\nwill forever remain a huge waste of everybody’s time—\n\nwas like a mist in the sun.\n\nOn the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nthe US Independence Day,\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nhow an ensemble of\n\n65,536 commodity processors\n\ncould be harnessed\n\nas the building blocks\n\nof a new supercomputer\n\nto become the fastest supercomputer\n\nin the world.\n\nI discovered\n\nhow to build a new supercomputer\n\nthat encircled the globe\n\nin the way\n\nthe internet does\n\nand build it\n\nfrom an ensemble of\n\ncommodity-off-the-shelf processors\n\nthat were identical\n\nand that were equal distances apart.\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nhow to use that new supercomputer\n\nto accurately solve\n\nexcruciatingly-detailed\n\ncomputational fluid dynamics models.\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nhow to solve\n\nthe toughest problems in algebra, calculus, and physics\n\nthat were named\n\nthe twenty grand challenge problems\n\nof supercomputing.\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nhow to execute computation-intensive codes\n\nand do so in parallel, or by solving\n\n65,536 initial-boundary value problems\n\nat once,\n\ninstead of solving\n\nonly one initial-boundary value problem\n\nat a time.\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nhow to solve, in parallel, a system of coupled, non-linear, time-dependent, and state-of-the-art\n\npartial differential equations\n\nof modern mathematics,\n\ncalled Emeagwali’s Equations,\n\nthat I invented\n\nthat encoded a set of laws of physics\n\nthat governed the flow of fluids\n\nthat enshrouded the Earth,\n\nas the crude oil, injected water, and natural gas\n\nunderneath the surface of the Earth\n\nor the rivers, lakes, and oceans\n\non the surface of the Earth\n\nor the air and moisture\n\nabove the surface of the Earth.\n\nThe partial differential equations\n\nof calculus\n\nis the mathematical technique\n\nwe use to measure and understand\n\nhow things move in our universe.\n\nThe universal laws of motion of physics\n\nthat were encoded\n\ninto those partial differential equations\n\nexplain how things move\n\nin our universe.\n\nExtreme-scale computational physicists\n\nuse those laws of motion\n\nto deepen our knowledge\n\nof the Earth’s past, present, and future\n\nas well as to have a surer understanding\n\nof how our universe\n\nwas formed\n\n13.8 billion years ago.\n\nThe Philip Emeagwali’s\n\nsystem of nine partial differential equations\n\nof modern mathematics\n\ndescribe how crude oil, injected water, and natural gas\n\nmove underneath the surface of the Earth.\n\nI also experimentally discovered\n\nhow to measure the previously unmeasurable speed.\n\nThat quest is a mathematical journey\n\nfrom fiction to fact to forecast.\n\nRich Consequences of Parallel Processing\n\nThe experimental discovery\n\nof a speed increase\n\nof a factor of 64 binary thousand\n\nis a significant lodestar\n\nin the terra incognita,\n\nor the unknown world, of supercomputing.\n\nThe treasures\n\nthat the experimental discovery\n\nof how to execute 64 binary thousand\n\npetroleum reservoir models\n\nunearths\n\ninclude the discovery and recovery\n\nof otherwise elusive\n\ncrude oil and natural gas.\n\nThe January 27, 1997 issue of Upstream,\n\nthe crude oil and natural gas industry newspaper,\n\npublished in Oslo, Norway,\n\ndescribed my experimental discovery\n\nas pushing\n\n[quote]\n\n“back the boundaries of oilfield science.”\n\n[unquote]\n\nMy country of birth, Nigeria,\n\nreaped the fertile\n\nand the rich consequences\n\nthat arose from using\n\nmy experimental discovery\n\nof massively parallel processing supercomputers\n\nand using my discovery\n\nin its Niger-Delta oilfields\n\nand using my discovery\n\nto discover and recover\n\ncrude oil and natural gas.\n\nOne in ten\n\nparallel processing supercomputers\n\nare purchased by the petroleum industry.\n\nMaking the Impossible Possible\n\nThe May 8, 1987 issue\n\nof The Chronicle of Higher Education,\n\nthe flagship newspaper\n\nthat presents news to universities\n\nhad a state-of-the-art article\n\non computational science.\n\nThat article was written by\n\na computer and information technology writer Judith Axler Turner.\n\nThe article was titled:\n\n[quote]\n\n“Some Hail ‘Computational Science’\n\nas Biggest Advance Since Newton, Galileo.”\n\n[unquote]\n\nFast forward three years,\n\nthe same technology writer,\n\nJudith Axler Turner,\n\nwrote in the June 27, 1990 issue\n\nof The Chronicle of Higher Education\n\nthat I\n\n[quote]\n\n“took on an enormously difficult problem…\n\nsolved it alone,\n\nhas won computation’s top prize,\n\ncaptured in the past\n\nonly by seasoned research teams.”\n\n[unquote]\n\nMy experimental discovery\n\nof the Fourth of July 1989\n\nwon computation’s top prize.\n\nMy experimental discovery\n\nof how to use the slowest processors\n\nand use them to compute faster than\n\nthe fastest processors\n\nmarked a turning point\n\nin the development of calculus\n\nand algebra.\n\nMy experimental discovery\n\nof massively parallel processing\n\nmade the news headlines\n\nbecause it marked a turning point\n\nin the development of the supercomputer\n\nthat should become\n\nthe computer of tomorrow.\n\nYet, it was for a good reason\n\nthat the parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer technology\n\nwas ridiculed\n\nby the leaders of thought\n\n—such as Seymour Cray\n\nand Gene Amdahl—\n\nand dismissed by their followers\n\nas a huge waste of everybody’s time.\n\nIn the 1970s and ‘80s,\n\nto parallel process across\n\nan ensemble of sixty-five thousand\n\nfive hundred and thirty-six [65,536]\n\nidentical, commodity processors\n\nwas the act of making the impossible possible.\n\nThat pessimism towards parallel processing\n\nwas the reason\n\nthat I—Philip Emeagwali—\n\nwas the only full-time programmer\n\nin the 1980s\n\nof the most massively\n\nparallel processing supercomputer\n\never built and powered by\n\nsixty-five thousand\n\nfive hundred and thirty-six [65,536]\n\ntightly-coupled, commodity processors.\n\nParallel processing looks easy\n\nbut communicating across processors\n\nis far from easy.\n\nIf parallel processing\n\nacross 64 binary thousand processors\n\nwas easy,\n\n25,000 vector processing\n\nsupercomputer scientists\n\nwould not have abandoned the technology\n\nand would not have left me alone\n\n—and left me for a decade—\n\nto program\n\nthe most massively parallel processing supercomputer,\n\never built.\n\nToday, the world’s fastest supercomputer\n\nis massively parallel\n\nand costs more than the budget\n\nof a small nation.\n\nThe cost of manufacturing\n\nthe world’s fastest supercomputer\n\ncosts one hundred [100] times\n\nas much as the cost of a blockbuster movie.\n\nAnd experimentally discovering\n\nhow and why parallel processing\n\nmakes supercomputers\n\ncompute faster\n\nis far more difficult than\n\nmanufacturing the fastest supercomputer.\n\nIt is far more difficult\n\nto experimentally discover\n\nhow and why parallel processing\n\nmakes modern computers faster\n\nand makes the new supercomputer\n\nthe fastest\n\nthan it is to manufacture\n\nthe fastest parallel processing supercomputer.\n\nAn invention\n\ndiffers from an engineering project.\n\nConstructing a bridge or a car or a computer or the internet\n\nis merely an engineering project\n\nthat employs\n\nmore than a thousand pair of hands.\n\nBut faster computers\n\nand the fastest supercomputers\n\ncould not be manufactured\n\nwithout the invention\n\nof the technological knowledge\n\nof faster computers.\n\nMy experimental discovery\n\nof how and why parallel processing\n\nmakes the computer faster\n\nand makes the supercomputer fastest\n\nis the new supercomputer knowledge\n\nthat made it possible to manufacture\n\nand commercialize\n\nthe modern supercomputer\n\nof today.\n\nBack in the 1970s and ‘80s,\n\nI was ridiculed and rejected\n\nand dismissed from research teams.\n\nI was dismissed\n\nbecause I was advocating\n\nfor parallel processing supercomputing.\n\nIn the 1960s, ‘70s, and ‘80s,\n\nparallel processing was ridiculed\n\nas a beautiful theory\n\nthat lacked experimental confirmation.\n\nBut in 1989,\n\nit made the news headlines that\n\na lone wolf African\n\nsupercomputer genius\n\nin the United States\n\nhas brought that\n\nfigment of the imagination\n\n—called parallel processing—\n\nand brought the technology\n\nfrom dream to reality.\n\nToday, parallel processing\n\nis in the history book\n\nand is the reason the 12-year-old\n\nis writing her school report\n\non the life of Philip Emeagwali\n\nand his contributions\n\nto the development of the computer.\n\nIt’s more difficult to invent\n\nthe technology that makes supercomputers faster\n\nthan it is to produce\n\na Hollywood blockbuster movie.\n\nIf you see a blockbuster movie,\n\nit’s easy to say to yourself:\n\n“I could have made that movie better.”\n\nIt’s easy to say to yourself:\n\n“I could have invented\n\nthe new supercomputer\n\nthat is 65,536 times faster\n\nthan the old supercomputer.”\n\nCommunicating Across My New Internet\n\nParallel processing\n\nwas ridiculed, mocked, and rejected\n\nby Gene Amdahl and Seymour Cray,\n\nthe two pioneers\n\nin the fields of sequential processing supercomputing\n\nand vector processing supercomputing, respectively.\n\nParallel processing\n\nwas only accepted\n\nafter decades of protracted\n\nand strenuous conflicts\n\nagainst the likes of Gene Amdahl\n\nand Seymour Cray.\n\nAt 8:15 on the morning of Tuesday\n\nthe Fourth of July 1989,\n\nthe US Independence Day,\n\nin Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States,\n\nit was my most pleasurable experience\n\nto stand at the farthest frontier\n\nof human knowledge\n\nand experimentally discover\n\nthe massively parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer.\n\nThough parallel processing\n\nwas first thought of in the 1940s,\n\nthe practical idea\n\nof solving millions of\n\ninitial-boundary value problems\n\nof modern mathematics\n\nand computational physics\n\nand solving those problems at once\n\nwas utterly ridiculed\n\nuntil I experimentally discovered it\n\non the Fourth of July 1989\n\nand won the top prize\n\nin supercomputing\n\nin 1989.\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nhow to solve\n\nthe grand challenge problem\n\nof supercomputing\n\nthat had cast its ominous shadow\n\nover the first 43 years\n\nof the invention\n\nof the programmable supercomputer\n\nthat was invented\n\nback in 1946.\n\nThat experimental discovery\n\nrepresents a new paradigm\n\nin the history of the computer.\n\nThe experimental discovery\n\nwas the tipping point\n\nthat lead to the complete acceptance\n\nof the massively parallel processing\n\nsupercomputer.\n\nThat experimental discovery\n\nof massively parallel processing\n\nwas immediately embodied\n\ninto all modern supercomputers\n\nand is now universally used\n\nwithin most modern computers.\n\nThat experimental discovery\n\nwas the new knowledge\n\nthat convinced the naysayers\n\nto change the way they looked at\n\nthe modern supercomputer.\n\nThe scientific acceptance\n\nof the massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nwas unstoppable\n\nafter I made that discovery.\n\nOn the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nI experimentally discovered\n\nthe fastest supercomputer\n\nthat was the precursor\n\nto the modern supercomputer.\n\nOn the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nI witnessed the unveiling\n\nto the human race\n\nof a new understanding of the words “computer” and “supercomputer.”\n\nIn the old dictionary,\n\nthe computer\n\nwas powered by only one processor\n\nthat was not a member of\n\nan ensemble of processors.\n\nIn my new dictionary,\n\nmy computer\n\nwas powered by an ensemble of\n\n65,536 commodity-off-the-shelf processors\n\nthat cohesively computed\n\nas one seamless supercomputer.\n\nThe computer\n\nis the greatest invention\n\nof the 20th century.\n\nIn the 1970s and ‘80s,\n\nparallel processing across\n\nan ensemble of processors\n\nwas described as\n\na beautiful theory that lacked\n\nan experimental confirmation.\n\nOn the Fourth of July 1989,\n\nI experimental discovered\n\nhow the modern supercomputer\n\ncan massively parallel process,\n\nor do many things at once,\n\nto solve the toughest problems\n\nin extreme-scale computational physics\n\nand mathematics.\n\nMy experimental discovery\n\nin 1989\n\nof massively parallel processing\n\nearned me the highest award\n\nin the field of supercomputing\n\nand became my contribution\n\nto the development of the computer.\n\nMy experimental discovery\n\nis the reason young people\n\nare doing school reports\n\non Philip Emeagwali.\n\nLooking back since ancient times,\n\nthe abacus\n\ninvented in ancient China\n\nwas the dust-covered board\n\nthat enabled its user\n\nto compute faster\n\nthan with his fingers and toes.\n\nLooking back since ancient times,\n\ncomputing aids have improved\n\nfrom the blackboard\n\nto the dust-board\n\nto the motherboard and, now, across\n\na massively parallel processing supercomputer\n\nthat I visualized\n\nas my small copy of the Internet\n\nand that’s a global network of\n\n64 binary thousand motherboards\n\nthat are equal distances apart\n\nand on the surface of a globe\n\nin a sixteen-dimensional hyperspace."
