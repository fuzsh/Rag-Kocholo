Dr. Philip Emeagwali was born in Nigeria in 1954 and dropped out of school at 14, but his father continued teaching him at home. He earned scholarships to study in the US, obtaining multiple advanced degrees including a PhD. He is renowned for inventing the world's fastest computer in the late 1980s by connecting 65,000 processors in a configuration inspired by the efficiency of honeycombs, allowing it to perform 3.1 billion calculations per second. This earned him the Gordon Bell Prize, demonstrating his pioneering work in high-performance computing.",
