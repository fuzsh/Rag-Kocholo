        "text": "One of such assessments, for me, is the recognition of the fact that Emeagwali was a pioneer or early figure in the philosophy and perhaps the practice of a particular form of computation, Natural Computing. Computation uses electronic devices in manipulating information through storage, retrieval and processing of data. Natural Computing, according to a journal of that name, ''refers to computational processes observed in nature, and human-designed computing inspired by nature''.\n\nExcerpts from Interview with Reuben Abati\n\nThe excerpts below from Emeagwali's Guardian, Nigeria, interview with Reuben Abati, demonstrates this. The link leads to the very rich interview as presented on Emeagwali's website, an interview vital for both its facts and its fictions.\n\nThe interview evidences the clarity and forcefulness of his presentation of a philosophy of scientific creativity informed by nature, particularly an animistic view of nature prominent in Africa.\n\nI dont know how factual are Emeagwali's claims, in the interview, of particular scientific achievements, or even the validity of the geometric forms presented in these excerpts, but, in spite of that qualification, the ideas presented remain lucid, realistic and compelling, the visualizations strikingly complementing the verbal explanations:\n\nQuestion: When you talk of mother nature, there is something ritualistic and animistic about the notion. Are you a Christian?\n\nResponse: My scientific vision is influenced by Christianity, animism and mysticism. I attended Catholic schools, sang in the church choir and was an altar boy while in the 7th and 8th grades.\n\nAt the same time, animistic beliefs permeated our everyday life. A dibia (spiritual healer) once determined that I am under the influence of mami-wata (mermaid) goddess and that I am an ogbanje (child spirit) who will reincarnate many times.\n\nMy scientific vision is also influenced by my earlier readings of my father's Rosicrucian Digest, an AMORC (Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis) quarterly publication that covers topics ranging from the mysteries of ancient Egypt to metaphysics and mysticism. Metaphysics teaches intuition and visualization techniques --- attributes that I use in making scientific discoveries.\n\nSince animism attributes conscious life to nature or natural objects, scientists that have animist beliefs tend to have enormous respect for nature and Mother Earth and are therefore more likely to borrow from it.\n\nThere are parallels between animist worship of trees, stones, and rivers and my design of the first computer networks that mimic the branching patterns of trees; my formulation of the new theory of tessellation which was inspired by the structure of crystal stones; and my mathematics thesis on river flows. Therefore, the animist religion of my Igbo tribe subconsciously influenced my scientific discoveries.\n\n\"Full-scale Hyperball nature-inspired computer network invented by Emeagwali''\n\nAfricans in the Diaspora are increasingly acknowledging the influence of animism in their lives. In Part of Each Other, Part Of the Earth, Aneb Kgositsile wrote:\n\n\"We, Africans in America, come from people tied to the Earth, people of the drums which echo the Earth's heartbeat ...\n\nPeople tied to soil and wind and rain as to each other ...\"\n\nAfter many years of spiritual malaise and environmental catastrophe, animism is being suggested as the salvation of western society. Best-selling books such as Bill Moyers' Healing and the Mind, and block-buster movies such as Dancing with Wolves and The Last of the Mohicans advocated or romanticized animism. My scientific writings are interspersed with quotations from animist religious leaders.\n\n''I use various geometrical figures such as this compound of the small hexagonal hexecontahedron and its dual small snub icosicosidodecahedron to design algorithms and computers such as the hyperball.''\n\nQuestion : You said you are particularly interested in given patterns in nature and that your work has been influenced by the honeycomb etc. How have you used nature?\n\nResponse: Inventing things requires that we seek new solutions to old problems or accomplish a lot with limited resources.\n\nI boost my creativity by observing how nature has solved problems similar to the ones that I am attempting to solve.\n\nThe new problem-solving approach of designing computer networks by observing and emulating patterns in nature is one that I pioneered. Being born and raised in a low-tech African environment enabled me to have a greater appreciation of the usefulness of drawing design inspirations and ideas from natural analogies. Other scientists use a rational and mechanistic approach to problem solving but I use a logistic[al] and inspirational one.\n\nI believe that Mother Nature is a wizard problem-solver which has used trial-and-error approaches, over hundreds of millions of years of evolution, to derive the most optimal solutions.\n\nFurthermore, the trial-and-error approach of nature yields more solutions than the logical approach used by humans. As a result, drawing inspirations from nature has enabled me to discover several computer networks. However, after designing from nature, I use advanced mathematical methods to analyze my inventions.\n\n''Philip Emeagwali discovered that sphere packing and fast computing are related fields''.\n\n''My theory of tessellated models demonstrated that sphere packing and fast calculations needed to recover and discover more oil are related subjects.''\n\nI observe and use the spatial interactions from other cultures to change my perspective and frame of reference for designing supercomputers. For example, I examine the weaving of baskets and textiles; the construction of bridges, terraces and houses; and the layout of fields and gardens.\n\nQuestion: You talk of a relationship between the construction of bridges, terraces and houses and fields and gardens, and computers. It is still not clear. What is the connection?\n\nResponse: My discoveries and inventions are made largely by geometrical intuition and visualization. Discoveries made by intuition are a mystery to others and half understood by the discoverer.\n\nThe subject of geometry was invented by black Africans living in the River Nile Valley as a means for measuring and dividing the flooded fertile farm fields and gardens. The word geometry is derived from geo (Earth) and metria (measurement).\n\nSince bridges, terraces and houses are geometrical objects, I use them to sharpen by intuition."
