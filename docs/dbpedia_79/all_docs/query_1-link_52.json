        "text": "Malardalen University\n\nMälardalen University, Gurksaltargatan 9, 722 18 Västerås\n\nFavorite\n\nDescription\n\nMälardalen University was founded in 1977 and has campuses in Västerås and Eskilstuna. In 1999 MDH became the first higher education institution (HEI) in the world to be environmentally certified, and in 2006 the University also became the first in Sweden to be work environment certified. MDH continues to develop and in 2020 a brand new campus in Eskilstuna was ready.\n\nVideo\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXb-pJj2_vo-channel=Malardalenshogskola\n\nStudent Life\n\nMälardalen University has two campuses, one in Västerås and one in Eskilstuna. Both campuses consist of buildings kept together, and should you need to go to the other campus there if a free bus service on weekdays for students and staff. On both campuses you can find restaurants, cafés, student services such as the Student Centre, library etc. Both are located in the respective city centers, and 5-15 minutes walk from the central stations. The sports associations at Mälardalen University offer various kinds of sports, dance and yoga classes etc. There are also plenty of fitness club, public baths, and other sports facilities around the towns, plus that nature is close by and always open for a power walk, bike ride or some hiking. In the winter you can try ice-skating on Lake Mälaren, the lake separating the two campus cities. In Västerås there is even a small facility for downhill skiing. There are programme associations for the various subjects and programmes at the University, as well as associations for sports, computers, theatre, board games, hiking, knitting and much more. Everyone is welcome to join. If you as a student want to start your own association you are encouraged to do so.\n\nHousing\n\nMälardalen University collaborates with housing agencies to make it easier for our students to find accommodation. There are rooms with shared or private facilities, and various sizes of student apartments. Most of the student housing for international students are furnished, because although a certain very large furniture company is conveniently located in town, we know that you have other things to take care of when you arrive, rather than to buy furniture.\n\nBachelors Programs Offered\n\nFavorite\n\nVasteras\n\nSweden\n\nTuition: €9,700\n\nAnalytical Finance is a unique Bachelor’s programme.
