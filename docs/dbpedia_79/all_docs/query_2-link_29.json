        "text": "The annual Darfur United Men’s Team training camp is here! Starting Sunday, July 9, players from Darfur, Sudan will gather in Ostersund, Sweden for 10 days of training, agility, strengthening, and fitness. The 2017 Östersund Training Camp will also include three friendly matches against Östersund United, a team of refugees from Syria, Afghanistan, and Eritrea; Ope IF B team; and ÖFK Academy U19 boys. Games and trainings will be held at Jämtkraft Arena, the home of Östersund FK, an official partner of Darfur United.\n\nJuly 9th – 19th 2017 Training Camp at Jämtkraft Arena\n\nJuly 12th Game 1: Darfur United vs. Östersund United\n\nJuly 15th Game 2: Darfur United vs. Ope IF B team\n\nJuly 18th Game 3: Darfur United vs. ÖFK Academy U19 boys\n\nIn 2014, the Darfur United Men’s Soccer Team played in its first CONIFA World Football Cup in Östersund, a tournament organized for football teams made up of nationless peoples. Team members were eventually able to claim asylum in Sweden and have permanently moved to various cities across the nation. Östersund is a small, urban town six hours north of Stockholm, and home to a population of 49,806. The DU team trains and competes at the local Östersund Arena.\n\nTraining camps and games maintain mental and physical health for the DU players, and this year’s camp will be used to prepare for the friendly match against Matabeleland FC in Zimbabwe this December, as well as to help the team qualify for CONIFA 2018. Goals include the establishment of short-and-long-term training goals for each player, increase in mindfulness practice, and further formalization of team organization. Through sustained efforts and activism, the DU players provide awareness of the global refugee crisis and generate hope for their family and friends still living in the refugee camps in eastern Chad.\n\niACT team members are coordinating this year’s soccer training camp and games. The iACT team includes two professional coaches and a professional medical/athletic trainer, as well as a local community Coordinator based in Östersund.\n\nSpread the word:"
