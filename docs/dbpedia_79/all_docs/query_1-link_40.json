        "text": "1 INTRODUCTION\n\nDuring the course of illness at hospitals, patients undergo frequent invasive diagnostic procedures which may be painful, for example, wound dressing, bone marrow aspiration, lumbar puncture, biopsies, and arterial catheterization.1 Acute pain in hospitals remains a major problem, with both undertreatment and overtreatment leading to serious consequences, including increased risk of persistent postoperative pain, impaired rehabilitation, increased length of stay and/or hospital readmission, and adverse events related to excessive analgesic use, such as oversedation leading to respiratory depression and even death,2, 3 as well as development of post-traumatic stress disorders, anxiety, and depression after hospital stay.4-6\n\nIn order to perform adequate pain relieving treatment, correct pain assessment tools are necessary. There is an unmet need for consistent and quantifiable pain assessment and treatment, and its use is mandated by the recommendations of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) in the United States and of similar bodies in Europe.2, 7 Today, numeric rating scales (NRS) are commonly used in both clinical and research settings. The NRS is used as a reliable tool for assessing both the perception of acute and chronic pain.8 Other pain intensity rating scales, such as the visual analog scale (VAS), also frequently used, have been shown to be reliable and valid across many populations.9, 10\n\nHowever, pain perception is highly subjective. Pain is a sensation, amplified by previous pain experience, pre-existent pain, and stressful surroundings in hospitalized patients.1, 3 It is also influenced by factors such as gender, cultural background, sociodemographic factors,11 the sex of the caregiver,12 and childhood trauma.13 Furthermore, pain experience is strongly related to affective states, such as fear and anxiety,14 and emotional activation can be viewed as part of the response to pain.14-17 It has, for example, been shown that negative emotional states can augment the experience of pain while positive states can attenuate it,18 and that depression influences the pain threshold.19\n\nNot only the perception, but also the autonomic reaction to pain is of importance. The efferent skin sympathetic nervous system, emotional sweating, mirrored by number of skin conductance responses per sec (NSCR)20 or skin conductance response amplitude, have been found to mirror sudomotor activity in anesthetized and conscious animals21, 22 and humans.20, 23 NSCR has been used to assess pain in patients, post-operatively24-26 and in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients,27, 28 as well as during nociceptive stimuli in patients undergoing anesthesia.29, 30\n\nThe present study was conducted in order to investigate influences of conditions analog to those ICU-patients may be exposed to during their hospital stay (such as different emotional states induced by emotionally loaded pictures and ICU noise) on pain, measured by NRS and NSCR. Part of the data from the study has been presented in a previous manuscript with a similar research question.27 Günther et al 2016 analyzed data from each measure with an ANOVA for the full design (ie, with no-pain and pain conditions altogether) letting variation (or non-variation) from the no-pain conditions also influence the results. They found small effects of negative emotional state on NRS and NSCR, however, with large interindividual differences (ie, intra-class correlation, Spearman's rho = 0.58) for the NSCR. This is different from previous findings which have shown low variation between individuals regarding NSCR.33, 34 We therefore hypothesize that the interindividual variability Günther et al 2016 found for NSCR, could be due to differences in the intensity of the electrical stimulation given to obtain perceived moderate pain. Moreover, data for valence and arousal were sampled by Gunther et al 2016, but has not not yet been published. We wanted to study if these variables could explain why an individually defined moderate painful stimulus of VAS 5 before the trial, changed to a range of 2-6, with a median of 4 during the trial.\n\nThus, for the present paper we have extracted the pain conditions to render a more straightforward analysis for studying effects of affective state (induced by emotionally loaded pictures) and ICU noise on pain, as self-perceived pain (NRS) and in terms of physiological responses (NSCR). The primary aim was to explore causes for variation in NRS and NSCR, including the intensity of the electrical stimulation during the pain condition, as well as ratings of arousal and valence.\n\n4 DISCUSSION\n\nAs also shown in Günther et al,27 both measures responded well to pain with higher NRS ratings and NSCR during pain conditions compared to no-pain conditions. The emotional manipulation induced by pictures was evident regarding differentiations between the negative emotion and both other affective states (neutral and positive) during “undisturbed” emotion conditions (ie, no noise nor pain conditions). Affective ratings showed that the negative conditions induced more anxiety, with higher ratings in both valence and arousal, compared to both other conditions. A similar pattern was found also for NSCR during undisturbed emotion conditions. However, during painful stimulation, the NSCR showed no influences by affective states. The effect found in Günther et al, with a small effect of the negative emotion on NSCR but large interindividual variability, could be explained by the fact that including no-pain conditions in the analysis influenced the results. The variability could also partly be explained by the individual differences in pain experience during calibration of moderate pain, rendering a wide range of intensities of the electrical stimulation.\n\nIn a similar manner, the none variation in NRS during no-pain conditions (ie, all ratings of pain equals zero in all no-pain conditions) brought forward a small effect of negative emotion on pain, when in fact the effect was evident and furthermore accompanied by a main effect of noise. These effects are moderated by anxiety, as shown by higher ratings of valence and arousal during negative conditions (and also during noise conditions, shown by an analysis not presented in the results) together with the correlation between both measures and the NRS. This could also explain why the individually titrated and pre-defined moderate painful stimulus was not confirmed in 58% of the pain ratings during pain trials. The fact that affective state (in terms of arousal and valence ratings) influences NRS during the trial, may thus explain why participants reported moderate pain in only 42% of the trials. Similar findings were reported by Warbrick,35 when pre-defined stimulus of VAS 50 (corresponding to VAS 5 in the present study) was repeated during the trial, the mean (SD) was 37 ± 24 in an anxiety group and 29 ± 25 in a non-anxiety group. He suggests that it is the increased negative valence which induces the increase in reported pain during induced pain-anxiety. The results from the present study, however, suggest that arousal also is of great importance. We even found a stronger correlation between arousal and pain (r = 0.61) compared to valence and pain (r = 0.37, both P < 0.001), indicating that the experience of bodily activation is important. Valence is of course important, but one could speculate whether sensory vigilance could be the common causal factor to the experience of both pain and anxiety. Change in pain intensity alters activation of the somatosensory cortex (increased arousal), while change in pain unpleasantness (negative valence) alters activation of the anterior cingulate cortex36, 37). A sensory signal can therefore be experienced differently among individuals. The manner in which a bodily sensation is appraised may influence the experience.38\n\nSeveral studies confirm that affective state, or anxiety levels, influence reported pain. It is, as well, difficult to assess pain in patients with anxiety.1, 14, 17, 18, 23, 35 During acute pain perception, anxiety1, 33 predicts reported pain intensity. Therefore, anxiety ought to be an important strain in the assessment of pain, and lowering anxiety levels should be considered before pain alleviation.\n\nNSCR which is not influenced by anxiety,17, 26 also confirmed in this study, correlates with the size of the electrical stimulus given during the trial. Different from NRS, NSCR reproduces the size of the electrical stimulus pre-defined as moderate pain, during the trial period with a mean of 0.23 skin conductance responses per second.17, 20, 24-28 Picture induced emotional conditions without painful stimuli influenced the NSCR, and the NSCR had a mean <0.13 NSCRs per second in those conditions, indicating no or mild pain according the Skin Conductance Algesimeter index. This was, significantly lower than the NSCR during the painful event, also confirmed in other studies.17, 20, 24-28 However, the mean skin conductance level, assessed in microsiemens, has been influenced by anxiety outside the perioperative setting.39 The results from the current study show that during electrical stimulation, the pain assessment measure, NSCR, indicates moderate pain, which should be treated if the situation had been in the hospital. If anxiolytic medications had been given pre-procedurally, one may speculate that the reported pain could have been lower without influencing the NSCR.\n\nThe results furthermore indicate that NSCR may mirror the nociceptive spinal response occurring on spinal level without being processed at supraspinal levels.40, 41 Moreover, this study is questioning if NSCR could possibly be better to assess the size of the tissue injury for analgesia treatment, when compared to NRS, at least in patients with high affective state. From a clinical point of view, the focus is to use less analgesia when treating pain to avoid side effects from these drugs. Therefore, it is of importance to investigate if self-reported pain can be reduced by lowering the anxiety level. The gap between the NRS and NSCR could inform the caregiver about pain \"residuals\" due to anxiety. To reduce the anxiety level antianxiety drugs could be used, but also treatment without drugs, such as, relaxation methods (e.g. hypnosis),42 information to the patient for gaining control over the situation,43 and distractions.44 Moreover, reducing the negative emotional state and the noise level should also be in focus.\n\nThe limitations in this study could be the use of three emotional conditions and the noise level instead of focusing only on anxiety. The positive condition was included because studies have shown a decrease in pain experience during positive emotions, which was not found in the present study.18\n\nHowever, both arousal and valence correlated separately with reported pain, which indicates that the affective state conditions used in our study could be valuable also in other pain studies. Both arousal and valence is strongly related to anxiety,16 so these affective variables could be compared to other studies where anxiety is assessed by anxiety-VAS or State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.45\n\nCutoff values for valence or arousal has not been established. In this study we therefore used the absolute numbers for correlation analyzes. Furthermore, electrical stimulation to define moderate pain has previously been used by Warbrick,35 and was therefore chosen also in this study.\n\nIn conclusion, both NRS and NSCR are reliable indicators of pain. The correspondence between NSCR and the actual tissue injury validates the use of NSCR as a measure of pain to tissue injury in patients to know whether analgesia should be given. However, NRS is also sensitive to the contextual setting and affective state, which NSCR is not in the pain situation. A discussion, whether to administer analgesic or antianxiety treatment during the perioperative stage when NRS is moderate or higher, is warranted. Also, the focus on lowering the affective state should be of importance in the clinical setting to reduce the need of analgesia."
