        "text": "UEFA Cup 1999-2000 we won at home to Deportivo 5-1 and lost away second leg 2-1 winning 6-3 on agg.\n\nThats about the last time I could find it happening to us since the 98/99 season in Europe.\n\nWow that's a long time ago. Was BigSoccer just being born then? I certainly wasn't on this board yet.\n\nBut I'll try looking up our threads from that time to see what was done with the next thread starter.\n\nMy gut says that since it was a loss somebody new steps up.\n\nEdit: BigSoccer's thread history only seems to go back to 2002 so we can't settle it that way. I think some of the other old-timers around the Arsenal boards might also way in, like maybe @yossarian or @michaec?\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I was under the impression that Milan are not very good these days. Kind of like us.\n\nThus it seems that we could've gotten a worse draw.\n\nEdit: They're on a better run of form than I realized. 8-3-0 under Gatuso.\n\nI think in the past, we've always been pretty strict about a loss meaning that thread starter was done. But as the research shows the last time that happened and we progressed in a cup was a loooong time ago. And frankly, back then I don't believe we had any match day thread rule. IIRC, that really didn't until Coach McGuirk and Rick were mods @ 2002-03.\n\nIf folks want to chime in hear so we can get a consensus, I'm fine with whatever is decided. My vote would be for you to continue. It's not like the \"thread starter\" rule has stopped us from sucking lately. So if folks want to break it based on the technicality that we still won the tie, fine with me. But people need to say so quickly.\n\nIt was nice to watch a team last night that was well-organized, well-coached, and played with real heart and desire.\n\nUnfortunately, that was the team in white.\n\nThey reminded me of Burnley, which I mean as a compliment.\n\nNone of you haters want to discuss how Xhaka came on at the half for AMN and actually helped settle things down in the midfield?"
