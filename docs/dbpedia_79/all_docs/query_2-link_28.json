        "text": "Swansea City kick off their pre season freindlies against Östersunds FK at the 5000 seater Jämtkraft Arena this evening.\n\nThe game has been overshadowed by the Ferrie Bodde transfer saga but putting that aside Roberto Martinez will take welcome relief that the football will now be doing the talking.\n\nSwansea will face a Östersunds side that languish bottom of the Div 1 Norra but safety is in reach for the Karl-Gunnar Björklund’s side with five teams on 14 points just a one point ahead of them. It is widely expected that Martinez will give all players a taste of the action this evening.\n\nJason Scotland will not participate in the game as he is out in Germany facing a operation on muscular problems. Angel Rangel has also not travelled with the squad as he prepares for a hernia operation. Whilst Swansea City youth product Kyle Graves could feature for the Swedish side. Livingston born striker Paul Shields will provide the main threat for Östersunds FK."
