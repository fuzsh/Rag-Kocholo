        "text": "ARSENAL are taking on Swedish side Ostersunds in the Europa League - and fans making the journey had better wrap up warm.\n\nGraham Potter's side have risen from the fourth tier of Sweish football to European competition in just seven years.\n\nTheir ground holds just over 9,000 and were founded just 21 years ago, with this their biggest ever game after seeing off Galatasary, Hertha Berlin and PAOK so far this season.\n\nBut it looks like Arsenal may get away with the big chill - after temperatures rose from -20 earlier this week.\n\nWhat temperature is it in Ostersund?\n\nTHE town of Ostersund is located in Jamtland, almost slap bang in the middle of Sweden.\n\nIt's motto is the 'Winter City' - and Arsenal have to face up to that reality tonight when they kick off in the Jamtkraft Arena.\n\nAt kick-off, the air temperature is set to be around -4c, with a wind chill of -11c.\n\nBelieve it or not, that is above average for the time of year - and the record low in February is a bone-shaking -34.6c.\n\nWhat time is kick-off?\n\nTHINGS get underway at 6pm at the little Jamtkraft Arena.\n\nArsenal are realistically in a battle for two cups this season - with the league title long gone and them out of the FA Cup.\n\nAfter this game, they face a huge League Cup final showdown against Manchester City on February 25.\n\nWhich channel can I watch it on?\n\nYOU can catch all the action live on BT Sport 3, where coverage starts at 5.45pm."
