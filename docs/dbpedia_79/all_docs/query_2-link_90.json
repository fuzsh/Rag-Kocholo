        "text": "He has been at a couple of Bosön-camps (1 2) for Sweden at U15 & U16 level. The U15's are the youngest swedish national youth team level and these are bigger camps where they call in something like 50 guys to have a look through the current top players from the different districts around the country and see who the best guys are at the moment. These camps don't contain any matches against other countries however, so he hasn't played any games for Sweden.\n\nHe started, played most of the game, and assisted on the second goal as Sweden beat England 2-1 in the first round of the group stage.\n\nIn an interview today some further background are given on Perry. He was born in New York by a Swedish mother of Ethiopian descent and an American father. He lived in the US until he turned 8 years old. Perry also points out that he has strong ties to America and that he is a bit of a mix of everything.\n\nThe big difference between the two national teams is that the USA play more possession based football while Sweden has more standout players, but he also points out that both are very professional setups and that playing for the Americans was good for his development. He actually contacted the American FA himself by mailing them videoclips of his play after being brought in to several Swedish camps but never getting to play. He most recently had contact with the Americans last thursday and he states that they might not be happy with him playing the U17 Euros. However he still haven't decided who he wants to play for in the future and he doesn't want to close any doors.\n\nSince he's a '99, he isn't eligible (unless he plays up) for tournament-playing U.S. teams until the 2019 U20 cycle. So, if I understand things correctly, playing in a UEFA tournament for Sweden means he'd have to file a one-time switch to rejoin us.\n\nHe played for Sweden in a loss to Denmark today. Their last group match is later this week against France.\n\nhttp://www.uefa.com/under17/season=2016/matches/live/index.html?day=40&session=2&match=2019779\n\n​\n\nhttp://www.uefa.com/under17/season=2016/teams/player=250097656/index.html\n\nUnderstandable. Nothing worse than having a player you want in your system provisionally cap-tied to another country, especially at 17. But sometimes the calendar works in your favor and sometimes it works against you.\n\nExactly. I get that it might be disappointing to \"lose\" the guy, but they could offer a UEFA tournament. All we could really offer was camps until late 2017/early 2018.\n\nI wonder if he was known to the program during our last U17 cycle. He would've been on the young side for that squad, and we had some established attackers, but still curious whether he had already reached out.\n\nAnd I think players, especially that young, don't realize the consequences of being provisionally cap-tied. Unless you have a falling out with a coach/federation or find yourself definitely left out by one fed, but in demand by another, you are taking a chance to file the switch. In the USMNT history, most of the switches have been at the full-NT level when it was obvious a player wasn't in the mix anymore. Switching at the youth level just isn't likely and might be a bad idea all around (ask Aaron Maund).\n\nNot that he shouldn't have gone ahead and taken the call-up.\n\nThe first game wasn't even produced for TV by UEFA so I don't think there will be any video for that one. I did watch the second one but since it was such a defensive affair there won't be much worth watching. You could definitely tell that we were missing our two star attacking players because before the last five minutes or so we had created maybe one or two chances. Perry didn't really do any better or worse then anyone else, although the british commentators did have a small go at him when he was subbed of (anti american bias? ) because they thought he was a bit of a ball hog.\n\nOnce you are provisionally cap-tied, you shouldn't play with another squad in anything more than a scrimmage without a one-time switch. The penalty for breaking the rule would be small, but not something you want to do on the regular. Not that US Soccer hasn't made some mistakes with call-ups of cap-tied players before.\n\nHere's the provision in the statutes that refers to playing for another national team (in any category):\n\n5-2 With the exception of the conditions specified in article 8 below, any Player who has already participated in a match (either in full or in part) in an Official Competition of any category or any type of football for one Association may not play an international match for a representative team of another Association.\n\nArticle 8 talks about the rules for switching associations.\n\nhttp://www.fifa.com/mm/Document/AFFederation/Generic/02/58/14/48/2015FIFAStatutesEN_Neutral.pdf"
