        "text": "English football tends to be quite conservative and risk-averse. Unorthodox methods and unconventional characters rarely get a fair hearing. Whenever a managerial role becomes available, which is often given the hire-and-fire culture that prevails, the same familiar list of candidates is linked to it. Some more interesting options are inevitably overlooked. Fortunately for an intrepid few, other routes exist.\n\nGraham Potter is one of those who has made it work. Faced with limited opportunities in England, in December 2010 he ended up moving to a remote part of northern Sweden for his big break. In his seven years as the manager of Ostersunds FK, the club has been completely transformed. There have been three promotions, a Swedish Cup win and a European adventure that continues against Arsenal this week.\n\n“It’s hard to get opportunities anywhere,” Potter tells i. “There are a lot of coaches out there and a lot of talented coaches too. It’s not easy. Quite often there’s no perfect situation that emerges. My situation, and my opportunity, was the fourth tier in Swedish football and a place that nobody really wanted to go to. Of course it’s turned out well for me. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn’t. It’s been a fantastic opportunity and a fantastic life experience.”\n\nFrom player to coach\n\nFrom humble beginnings as a player, Potter’s success has been remarkable. Starting out at Birmingham City, he was a steady but unremarkable full-back who went on to play for Stoke City, West Bromwich Albion and Southampton among others, before dropping down the divisions. He retired at the age of 30 after a final season-and-a-half with Macclesfield Town in League Two. Despite making eight Premier League appearances, Potter is quick to acknowledge his limitations.\n\n“I was obviously never good enough to play at a top level, or even anywhere close to that, if I’m being honest. That’s the reality. But I met lots of really good people and I was grateful for the time I had. If you can have a career as a footballer for 13 years then you’re really lucky, but there will probably be plenty of supporters up and down the country saying that I wasn’t a top player, to put it kindly. That’s for sure.” he laughs.\n\nKeen to go into coaching, Potter studied his craft and took on development roles at a couple of universities, Hull and then Leeds Metropolitan, while completing a master’s degree in leadership and emotional intelligence. By 2010 he felt well-equipped to turn theory into practice, but struggled to find an opening in professional football.\n\nHuge step\n\nGraeme Jones, a friend and former team-mate, put him in touch with the Ostersunds chairman, Daniel Kindberg. The two got on well, sharing a unique vision and sense of what could be achieved in adverse circumstances. Potter accepted the manager’s job and moved his young family to Sweden to start afresh.\n\n“It was a huge step,” he admits. “I’d had five years of building up a career in the higher education sector, which was quite secure. We’d just had our first child and my wife had a business that she’d built up over 10 years. So on a human level, a professional level, and a family level it was really big. You were going a bit into the unknown, to a football club that had just been relegated to the fourth tier, and that had changed managers a lot over the previous years, so that was a bit of a risk.\n\n“It was probably the biggest challenge I’ve had in my life. The first six months were really tough because you’d relocated with your family and you had to adapt to a new life, a new culture, a new country. But thankfully it’s gone well.”\n\nThe situation Potter arrived to find was far from promising. The city of Ostersund is in the freezing north of Sweden, where temperatures are typically below 0°c for around four months of the year, and is more associated with winter sports like skiing and speed skating. It has no real football heritage to speak of. Very few players could be convinced to move there. Potter had plenty of doubts in the early days but embraced the project and found ways to work around his difficulties.\n\nIt’s turned out far better than he could ever have imagined.\n\nOstersunds challenge\n\nThe club was only formed in 1996 and had little sense of direction. Potter was essentially presented with a blank slate from which to forge an enduring identity.\n\nTogether with the chairman, he set about doing things differently. Because of Ostersunds’ natural limitations, they have been forced to experiment, particularly when it comes to recruitment and team building. It’s all been about finding value, and an edge, where others haven’t.\n\n“In the first 18 months to two years it was hard to get players from the south of Sweden up to Ostersunds. Geographically it was a challenge. There are too many options for Swedish players down south. It’s like anything, then you have to think, ‘Okay, what players can we get? What’s our strategy?’\n\n“Although it’s a challenge for us, it’s also an opportunity in terms of creating an environment where people can focus on their football. They can come and improve. We started with that work, making the most of the environment and making the most of where we were. It was about creating an identity on the pitch, and off the pitch, where we could use everything that we had to its maximum.”\n\nRemarkable story\n\nFrom unfavourable circumstances, a remarkable story was born. It’s scarcely believable what’s happened in Potter’s reign. Ostersunds won three promotions in five seasons, rising to new heights. In 2016 they competed in Allsvenskan [Sweden’s top flight] for the first time in their brief history. They finished eighth in their debut season at that level and then won the Swedish Cup, beating IFK Norrkoping 4-1 in the final to earn a place in the Europa League qualifiers.\n\nTurkish giants Galatasaray, who had won the competition in its previous guise, were among those seen off during an unforgettable summer. In the final play-off round, Ostersunds overcame a two-goal deficit from the first leg to squeeze past PAOK Salonika and qualify for the competition proper. It was the culmination of all the club’s hard work, its faith in an unproven manager and some bold methods. Potter points to that match as the highlight of his time in charge.\n\n“The atmosphere in the ground, just to qualify for the Europa League, was great,” he says. “A lot of players and a lot of coaches have gone to the qualification process of the Europa League but far fewer have actually played in it. For us that was a big, big moment. It changed the complexion and the financial situation of the club. It was really special for us, and probably reflected the rest of the work that we’ve done over the last seven years.”\n\nWhen everyone expected their run to end at the group stage, Ostersunds kept defying the odds. With by far the smallest budget of the three clubs they were up against, they finished second, level on points with Athletic Bilbao, to set up a momentous tie against Arsenal. Potter and his team have had to get used to punching above their weight but this is something else entirely.\n\nReally proud\n\nArsenal’s squad features three World Cup winners. Ostersunds’ is largely composed of players who weren’t deemed good enough to make it elsewhere, their departures unmourned. Two of the club’s English contingent, Curtis Edwards and Jamie Hopcutt, were previously released by non-league sides back home. Teammates from Nigeria, Iran and Ghana have also thrived in Potter’s system.\n\n“We’ve gone through the leagues and built our reputation on being a tactically flexible, attacking, possession-based team, I would say. We’ve had to use players that maybe the conventional Swedish system hasn’t valued as much and therefore you have to adapt your style around the strengths of those players. I think that’s been our identity.\n\n“Players that are brave, that aren’t afraid to make mistakes. That can get on the ball and show courage and really try to enjoy their football. If the players are enjoying their football, there’s a chance that the supporters will enjoy it as well. And that’s how you grow and develop as a club.”\n\nIt’s an admirable approach that has reaped substantial rewards. Potter has been keen to create a positive and supportive environment. Nobody is left in any doubt as to what’s expected of them and everything is put in place to help the players to achieve their goals and optimise their performances. The mood around Ostersunds has been radically altered as a result.\n\n“It’s gone from a club of negativity, one where people didn’t believe, and didn’t trust the club really, to one where people are really proud of what it stands for both on and off the pitch. At the start, six or seven years ago, there were probably 600 people in the ground and half of those probably wanted us to lose, secretly.\n\nNow we’ve got 6,000-8,000 people coming to the games and there’s a real sort of support in the town.\n\n“Even across Sweden I think there’s a general sort of respect for what we’ve done, certainly this year in the Europa League. It’s really nice to see how a winter city, and one that isn’t renowned for playing football, has gone from that to one where there are kids playing football, and there are soccer schools, and people wearing Ostersunds tops, young and old. They’re really just getting behind the team.”\n\nCulture academy\n\nAwards and plaudits have finally started to come Potter’s way. He prides himself on being adaptable. A modern coach with a progressive attitude, he has been willing to try new things, including holding an art exhibition and putting on theatre shows with his players.\n\n“It came from a conversation between myself and the chairman. It was his idea really. We’d spoken about developing players and developing people and he thought that running a culture academy alongside the football club was a way of exposing people to stuff they wouldn’t normally be exposed to,” says Potter.\n\n“You start to see people outside of the football environment and in stressful situations. You can do a lot of work about your own self-awareness, how you work in certain situations and start building some empathy. As a team-building activity it’s great. You get to see each other in different roles and different ways. It’s about building that inner courage and clarity of decision-making under stress.”\n\nMuch more than just a gimmick, the culture academy is about taking players out of their comfort zone, testing them, and strengthening the bonds between the group through shared experience. It builds team spirit and togetherness, making them into more rounded individuals, which football, with its relentless focus on winning matches, is often accused of failing to do.\n\nA great pioneer\n\nThe idea would be unlikely to find much favour in England, but it has been a contributing factor, however small, to Ostersunds’ success, and helped to bring the club and its supporters even closer together. The latest task for Potter is his most high profile one yet – to outsmart Arsene Wenger, widely regarded as one of football management’s great pioneers, in the Europa League last 32.\n\nThe two clubs are in different stages of their respective seasons, which he admits could be a factor in the final reckoning. Swedish football operates on a calendar year basis so, until last Friday’s match against Trelleborg, Ostersunds hadn’t played competitively since their final match of the group stage, away to Hertha Berlin on 7 December. They then had a four-week winter break before pre-season started up in early January.\n\nThe squad flew out to Tenerife for some warm-weather training, and then headed off again to play some matches because the current temperatures in Ostersund, which are routinely well below freezing at this time of year, aren’t conducive to playing football.\n\nDavid vs 10 goliaths\n\nIt’s another added complication, but far from the biggest. By rights, given the vast disparity in resources at their disposal, they simply shouldn’t be able to compete with Arsenal. Mesut Ozil alone is worth more than Ostersunds. They operate on an entirely different financial scale but Potter has to find a way to bridge that gap and make it a viable contest. It’s a challenge he’s excited by.\n\n“When you see the size of the club, it’s David versus about 10 Goliaths. They’re enormous and we have huge respect for what they’ve done over the years, competing regularly in the Champions League. It’s an incredible football club. We need to try to make sure that we’re ready and up to the levels that we were last year,” says Potter.\n\n“We’ve got to use the home advantage as best we can but we’re under no illusions. We understand the hierarchical situation. We go into it as firm underdogs but it’s a great opportunity to show what we’re about. We haven’t got too much to lose I don’t think, and sometimes in football that’s the best role to play.”\n\nPotter is keen for Ostersunds to keep growing and not lose sight of the bigger picture with all the attention focused on the games against Arsenal. The 42-year-old wants to take the club even further but, having been linked with the recent managerial vacancy at Stoke, interest from elsewhere will increase the more he continues to exceed expectations. English football is finally sitting up to take notice of someone it long ignored."
