I've listened to Eric and Ginger many times but there is always something missing in their performance, and that is that spark and synergy that makes it happen for us  the fans. Hendrix said it all when he went \"rogue\" and played \"Cream\" on the beeb.\n\nIm still hopeful that one day you will play together one more time If so it would be the biggest gig in the history of music.\n\nNAME: Philip\n\nLOCATION:\n\nADDRESS:\n\nDate: 1/13/2005\n\nTime: 5:33:29 PM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nNAME: Paul Rapatano\n\nLOCATION: Boston Ma.

I don't know if you'll make it to O'l Beantown but one can hope. I have been a fan since I first heard the opening strains of I Feel Free. Cream was a beath of fresh air. So different and ultimately one of the few truely influential musical groups of all time. They are right up there with the Beatles. Cream did for musicianship what the Beatles did for song writing. This is not to sell Creams' (escentially you) song writing short. Though Eric went on to become such a huge international star it was you that was the brains, heart and soul of Cream. It amazes me how important the band is concidering thier short lifespan. What a band! I look forward to the cd and dvd of the concert. How stupid would it be not to produce them! I am saddened to hear of the passing of \"your father\" D.H.S. A great muscian. I wish you good health and a long life. Keep cranking out the great music. You are unique. Your lifelong fan Paul.

But for an artist his last \"creation\" \"tribute\" ( to music - in the case of Jack )is the most important. Listening again and again to \"more jack than god\" let me tell you, Jack, that this is one of the best things you have ever made.

I was a bassist/keyboardist in'68 when I heard Crossroads from Wheels of Fire. I was never the same again.\n\nYou generated within me a freedom and spirit of adventure that has served me very well for near forty years. Everytime I plug in the EB-3 I think about what Jack would do if he were here. I am constantly aware of your ethereal presence, scrutinizing and nodding approval of my performance.\n\nNeedless to say, you have been my hero both on and off the stage. There will never be another such as you.\n\nCongratulations in whipping the illness. No, your MD's did not know you very well. I do.\n\nIn whatever you choose to do, I pray for your happiness. May you be in Heaven a week before Lucifer hears you've passed.\n\nWith undying admiration and love, Glenn Flowers-bassist\n\nNAME: Bill Kutlesa\n\nLOCATION: On a boat in Auckland\n\nADDRESS: dragon'slair429@yahoo.com\n\nDate: 1/18/2005\n\nTime: 1:59:09 AM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nHi Jack and best wishes to you. Thrilled to hear you, Eric and Ginger are playing together again in May. The only thing better than being there for that is if you and the band could play for my daughter's coming out party? Please let me know A.S.A.P as I'll have to adopt a girl and sell everything I own. The adoption could take a while...\n\nCheers Bill\n\nNAME: Steve Gregoropoulos\n\nLOCATION: Los Angeles\n\nADDRESS: waco1@mindspring.com\n\nDate: 1/18/2005\n\nTime: 6:28:05 PM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nJack - what a trip to be posting in your guestbook. It actually makes me like the internet. Which is not easy to do.\n\nAnyway, when I was a bad kid skipping school we used to stay up all night and listen to Harmony Row. Now I'm 46. The other night I stayed up all night listening to Harmony Row with my best friend, a 28 year old punk guitarist.\n\nShe was blown away and now she plays the record all the time - and she's the hottest guitarist in the city. There you go. It's an immortal album. I hope you read this guest book and feel good about that.\n\nBecause you are one of the only people to bring any kind of real classical music sensibility into pop recordings. No pro-rock bulls**t. It's the real deal.\n\nKeep making records. We need 'em.\n\n-s\n\nNAME: Pat Webb\n\nLOCATION: Melbourne, Australia\n\nADDRESS: Patricia.Webb@vu.edu.au\n\nDate: 1/18/2005\n\nTime: 7:01:55 PM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAs the reunion has been confirmed, I would appreciate it if someone in the UK could please advise when & where tickets can be obtained.\n\nNAME: craig\n\nLOCATION: deleon springs, fla\n\nADDRESS: ccrtotalturf@cfl.rr.com\n\nDate: 1/20/2005\n\nTime: 1:06:59 PM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\njack, to make any other comments about the reunion of the cream would be redundant but I feel everyone should know the complexity of this group. I probably did more research o the cream than any other rock band and for good reason. You all had a different sound...unmatched. I always wanted to pit your band against the likes of zepplin even though styles were different. Talent has a way to come to the top (ie like cream)...hope you are doing well to really the best bass player I've ever heard. Keep ginger snapping his sticks and let eric follow you every once in awhile...later from the biggest cream fan ever...craig\n\nNAME: Paul Doyle\n\nLOCATION: Larkhall.

I would visit her regularly at her home in Chatham in Eastkilbride. She would give me fizzy drinks and biscuits and let me tickle your piano in the living room. She would then sit me down and play me the cassette session tapes that you would regularly send to her and ask me what I thought. I remember in particular the tapes for Hows Tricks. They were such an inspiration to me at my early age.\n\nI remember your Dad Charlie he was a character and a half, he and your Mum would pop over sometimes normally on new years after the bells your Dad would bring his fiddle and that would be that. I lived with my parents in Chatham across from your parents house.\n\nYou and I met on a couple of occasions the last time we spoke you had come up to chatham in your Jag SJX. I told you at the time that your music had inspired my to become a singer song writer. I will always remember your advice to me at the time  Dont do it for a living Paul, get a good career and keep your music as a serious hobby\n\nI took your advice and got a job in financial services. Im now 42 and the career that you advised me to get has come in pretty useful to feed my wife three children. However, I have continued to write and record my own stuff at home. I wouldnt mind you having a listen to my stuff and letting me know if I am doomed to a further 25 years in financial services ! ha ha.\n\nI was delighted to hear that you are having a a reunion with Cream as I was a little young first time around and hope to able to get a couple of tickets for the Albert Hall and bring my Son Gregor that would be fantastic !\n\nWell Jack, I will close by saying that I was very sorry to hear how ill you had been last year and I am delighted that you have made such a great recovery. I have so much to thank you for, namely the original inspiration in my song writing which has been the passion of my life. I will never forget and often think fondly of the days spent with your Mum at Chatham.\n\nMy very kind regards\n\nPaul Doyle\n\nNAME: Ria Rogers\n\nLOCATION: S.

Is there any possibility that you guys could extend tour to the \"states\"? I will be very satisfied to see the DVD, but, my son brought up the question \"wouldn't it be the concert of a lifetime to see Cream live?\" I agree, but can't afford to travel to England.

Next: have just added to my collection of your output with Jet Set Jewel (a TRUE jewel), Songs For A Tailor (very cool and incredibly imaginative), and Doing This ... On Ice (nice and loose in parts, so a real concert - and showing how you preserve/augment the past and constantly build for the future). Thank you for your truly astonishing talent and output. I now almost have your complete output (sounds rude to me!!) with just 3 to go. Finally: the Cream reunion. Someone, somewhere is just making an obscene killing with the tickets. Hopefully you, Ginger and Eric will gain financially and musically what you rightfully deserve - but getting a ticket is now beyond a joke. 35 years on and the final Cream gigs will be rembered as much for the sell out of the true fans as for the significance of the group and its reunion. Sorry to end this mail on a down note but this just hasn't been thought through enough. Cheers all the same my friend - you remain an inspiration to many.

It's a wonderful thing and I hope that all involved find this a creative period. There's every good reason to imagine it so. I can't help but imagine what it will sound like. The DVD is going to be incredible. There will be one, I trust....\n\nWhen I first heard Jack's retrospective live 2-CD set, now already over a decade old, amazingly, it was the augmentation that most struck me, how the music did not suffer. Not to say Cream wouldn't still be able to take off at Mach 15 as a trio (one could imagine the \"arrangements\" to work in such a way, as one example), just that if we consider the possibilities available now -- anyway, this is just one gentle opinion, but the firm truth is I'll buy the DVD on its release date, and hope that the Rock and Roll HoF footage might even be included if possible.\n\nFinally, though, I'm anxious to see what these three musicians will say to each other through music. It's clear their mutual commication hasn't waned one bit. Their experience in the intervening years will mean everything -- Clapton's very public and all-too-genuine reasons for playing the blues, Baker's long apprenticeship in Africa and afterwards (of course his solo discs are also must-haves), and Jack Bruce's dazzling experiments. What will it all sound like, decades and decades on? I'm breathless. Absolutely breathless. And no expectations at all; this is going to be astonishing.\n\nNAME: Martti Turunen\n\nLOCATION: Finland\n\nADDRESS: martti.turunen@phnet.fi\n\nDate: 1/29/2005\n\nTime: 4:35:36 AM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nHello Jack,\n\nWe are dreaming Here that The Cream Reunion II Will Happen In Helsinki 13th Nowember 2005.

Bruce ,Baker and Clapton have decided to play together again. Since 1968 they have all gone on to different things , with various levels of success. Of course , most people that log onto this site believe Jack Bruce to be the influential musician of that band, and to a certain extent , that is true. We all have his solo albums (if we can get them ) . However, we must not forget that a certain chemistry appears when Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker play with Jack Bruce.Clapton said himself in 1993 that he feels \"inspired\" by Jack Bruce when he plays beside him. And to paraphrase ,as I can't remember the exact quote \" there is that special thing that happens when he (Jack) starts to sing\". Break a leg Guys . Play it loud. Dick Heckstall-Smith would have been proud to see two London lads and a Glaswegian playin' the Blues. I wish I could be there.

Then one day after a drunken high-shool party after being totally busted by my mother for being delinquent and drunk I saw a live video of Cream perforiming. Right then and there I knew wanted to play bass. If it weren't for Jack I may have never made that decision. I feel I owe him great thanks.\n\nThanks Jack for all you have given us! -Jave\n\nNAME: Andie Nelson\n\nLOCATION: Leeds, UK\n\nADDRESS: andirejnelson2003@yahoo.co.uk\n\nDate: 1/31/2005\n\nTime: 5:38:01 AM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nwhich plank decided to put the cream tickets up via one 3rd rate agancy?, 2 hours trying and all i've seen is 'busy' screen' heard 'busy' messages on phone, and watched the ticket options online fall.\n\nstill none, well organised guys.\n\nNAME: Andie Nelson\n\nLOCATION: Leeds, UK\n\nADDRESS: andiejnelson2003@yahoo.co.uk\n\nDate: 1/31/2005\n\nTime: 6:13:21 AM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nabsolutley gutted, over 2 hours on both phone and net getting next to nothing but 'busy' screens & messages. got 'thru' twice on phone only to get a recorded 'busy, this call will now disconnect' damn it, put me in a queue you inept muppetts. got right thru to payment details on site, and then the site locks up with it's black 'busy' screen again. whoever got stalls block Q, 237 & 238, you have no Idea how lucky you are, they were mine till the site gave up. very poorly organised, no doubt some jammy get rang up at 11 for the 1st time and got a ticket straight off.\n\nhere's hoping this is rectified later in the year with a proper tour, please Jack, Ginge & Eric?\n\nNAME: andie nelson\n\nLOCATION: Leeds, UK\n\nADDRESS: andiejnelson2003@yahoo.co.uk\n\nDate: 1/31/2005\n\nTime: 6:21:26 AM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nis hould say the tickets I almost got (see last post) where for the tuesday, if the lucky buyers reading!.\n\nalso, if you remember Jack, I was the long haired youngster running around in front of the stage (when everyone else was still seated!) at Leeds Irish centre back in '94, when Blues Saraceno & Gary Husband completed the band. the hair's gone now mind!.

Talk about a feeding frenzy!! Jack and Margrit, if there is any more reunion concerts, is there any way of helping us Aussies get tickets? The Cream would book the 80,000+ venues here in Australia without any trouble - just like Bowie, Van Morrison and the Stones have over the past couple of years.

Me, my dad and brother are big fans and were planning on going to the gig in May. Just got through on the hotline after four hours of waiting to be told everything was sold out, even started at 9AM when it opened. Well disapointed, had no chance on the phone and the web booking didnt even work. Other ticket web sites have them for sale at five times the amount of face value(which is already a rip off)and they have plenty for sale. What kind of joke is that? Just making this rant coz this is truly a one off gig and im sure this happened to many people, this is unfair, anybody should have the chance to go, not just the rich who can afford to blow a grand on a ticket. Why allow other ticket companies to buy all the tickets and sell them for more? Its out of order! I guess thats just the way of the world. Hope you read this Jack, will still continue to love your music. Im sure the gig will become legend. Keep it Real!

This year I am 50. What a present that would be, my sweetheart and I thought.\n\nI saw in the Sunday Times that tickets were to go on sale from 9.00 am on Monday 31st January.\n\nDespite being at work I arranged the net so that I was just into the ticket site, I had 2 mobiles with the number for the booking office at the RAH programmed in. At bang on 9.00 am I hit the dial on both and clicked the right buttons on the net.\n\nBoth phones were giving the engaged tone and the net was showing that the site was very busy and to try again later.\n\nI dialled constantly on the mobiles for two and a half hours so much so that I am surprised that the little green and red phones were not completely worn off. Not once did I get anything other than the engaged tone. Colleagues in the office tried, same result.\n\nThe net was a no hoper, 'Very busy please try later' was the best I could get for over 2 hours.\n\nUntil at 11.30 the net worked I was into the site and there were tickets showing available, until you select how many you want, then the computer says no. It is probably sold out is the best advice the net can give!\n\nHowever on E-Bay there were tickets being advertised at grossly inflated prices as little as one and a half hours after the lines and net opening. These were the people who stopped me getting through. People who had no intention of going to the concert and their sole aim was to gain.\n\nWell I will not on principle pay those prices, I would hope that they catch a cold but doubt it.\n\nIf this is capitalist Britain I am glad that I can retire in a little over 3 years and leave.\n\nI hope some real fans managed to get through and get tickets.\n\nNAME: paul marcovitch\n\nLOCATION: Bristol,England\n\nADDRESS: paul@marcovitch.freeserve.co.uk\n\nDate: 1/31/2005\n\nTime: 3:16:24 PM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\njust to put it in perspective, i've been listening to Cream & solo Jack for around 35 years & when i heard about the reunion gigs,thought yeh at last!!!

Only to eventually be told that all the tickets,for all the CREAM concert dates were sold out by 2.30pm. There has got to be a better way to sale tickets.It's so unfair. I've waited 37 years for this (I'm 57)been an avid fan,bought numerous LP's,tapes and CD's and always prayed that CREAM would reform. I was so pleased that Jack was fit enough to perform and I wish him well. I first saw Jack with the Graham Bond Organisation with Dick Heckstall-Smith (now sadly recently passed on),and Ginger Baker. I can honestly say Jack has been a great influence on my musical life. I'm just devastated at not getting tickets. \"Hear me calling your name.Won't you come back again\"\n\nNAME: mark willshire\n\nLOCATION: portsmouth\n\nADDRESS: mark_willshire@hotmail.co.uk\n\nDate: 2/1/2005\n\nTime: 10:00:36 AM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nhi jack, i dont know if you get time to read these but i would just like to express my dissappointment at the manner in which the cream royal albert hall tickets were distributed. I am not just bitter about not getting a ticket, i sat at my computer, as im sure thousands of others did, and experienced a waiting time of 2 hours continously using both the net and phone. When i eventually got through to the ticket buying stage i entered in 3 tickets (one for me my mum and dad) for the S section on the monday at £75 each.(these were meant to be a present for my mums 50th on may 31st). I then clicked continue and it said that the site was busy- if this was the case for everybody then no-one would have obtained a ticket at all! this happened upward of 20 times and the dite came across as ill prepared for the massive demand for tickets. It was frustrating to be so close to a ticket so many times and to be let down. The tickets now seem to have found their way into the hands of touts who are already asking up to £795 for them. My point is that although it was no fault of the band or any of its members everytime i now put on a cream long player im filled with dissappointment rather than happiness. Unfortunately the group has been slightly tarred by mismanagement further down the chain. i only picked your site to air my dissappointment because this is the only plausable way i might have of contacting you. mark\n\nNAME: Rob Walker\n\nLOCATION: London\n\nADDRESS: rob_e@walker302.fsnet.co.uk\n\nDate: 2/1/2005\n\nTime: 10:33:01 AM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nCorruption reigns.

I still get as high as ever by this fantastic music and was very pleased to hear about the concerts in Royal Albert Hall. I tried hard to get tickets for my two daughters and me on the Internet but failed. That was a disaster because it would be a highpoint for me to be able hear and see Cream live, especially with my daughters accompanying me. Some things in life can mean a lot to you and Creams music have given me much joy. I get the most kicks out of the live recordings improvised parts, especially in Sweet Wine, Spoonful, Toad and Im So Glad, where the ensemble playing reaches fantastic heights. Thank you for that! I have really been depressed not being able to get any tickets and sincerely hope that you acquire the taste of your playing together again and possibly decide to give some more concerts. That would be heavenly for me to get a new chance to see Cream perform live. I think there are many more people that wish the same. So good luck with your concerts and hopefully it will give you much pleasure to play and perform together again.\n\nNAME: Pete Skjold\n\nLOCATION: Lewisville Tx\n\nADDRESS: basses@skjolddesign.com\n\nDate: 2/4/2005\n\nTime: 5:12:26 PM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nJack is my biggest influence as a bass player. I have played as a pro going on 18 years. Before I played bass I found a record in my dads collection called \" West , Bruce and Laing Live N' Kickin\" Well I loved it ! I didn't know that what I was hearing during the solo on Powerhouse Sod was a bass , I thought it can't be a bass ! When I started playing the bass a couple of years later I learned that solo and have not looked back...until just recently when I purchased the reissue of that glorious album. I can't say how much Jack's music and outlook have shaped me as a musician,( for there are no words ) all I can say is God bless you Jack and keep Thumpin out those notes.

The only number that I truly miss is \"Timeslip\" as the bass-playing is riveting Please bring the Cream reunion tour to S.F. and L.A. where you once recorded at Wally Heiders: \"Out Of The Storm\" LP(1974)... Also,It would be great if Cream would do some newly written freshly Pete Brown/Jack Bruce/Eric Clapton or Ginger Baker/Mike Taylor new Material as you once mentioned back when you did the '89 Tour with Blues Scarceno and Ginger Baker...for the \"A Question Of Time\" LP/CD. My favorite tunes on \"Out Of The Storm\" are \"Golden Days\",\"One\" \"Timeslip\",etc. \"Timeslip\" should now be done by the New CREAM as it is so drenched in Organic Raging Creamy jamming syncopated blues/jazz-jamming rock that it's unbelievable that no one hardly ever remembers it...It could be a new Smash Hit as it hits home in a very blisteringly intensely outrageous unbelieveable reminiscent of CREAM way!

For an authentic touch, will they do lots of one chord BLooZ jammin at ear shredding volume in an environment with no fold back but with big stacks, tiny PA and the inability to hear what each other was playing? (Which seemed to be the way they did it nearly forty years ago and presumably led to the free and innovative way they did it) or will they attempt a rather more grown up sound utilizing a modern system with modest stage amps, up to date monitors and perhaps additional session/ sidemen musicians thus being able to play the more musical studio stuff live? It would be easy for them to play Spoonful, Im So Glad, Politician et cetera but it would be great to see and hear material like Pressed Rat and Warthog, Anyone For Tennis? Wrapping Paper and the more psychedelic bits of Disraeli Gears done live. Perhaps theyll do both. First set: long Marshall stack on full tilt jamming versions with no foldback and one overhead drum mic through a museum piece PA (400 watt Watkins?).

I guess I will have to be content with the dvd since you won't be hitting the States(I heard Ginger isn't allowed back in America...IRS B.S. I guess. Anyway, my first concert when I was 15 was the Farewell Cream concert at the Forum in Los Angeles back in 1968. Deep Purple opened for you guys. It changed my life forever. I have seen you and Eric since that faithful day many, many times. At the Roxy here in LA, you blew the roof off the place with Simon Philphs on drums...still remember it like it was yesterday. And of course I have seen EC many time and even saw GB when he played drums for Sam Kinison at the Universal Amp!!! Last saw you with Ringo at the Universal Amp. You have touched so many souls, have provided such joy and happiness to people throughout the world. Thank you and stay well.

I was on the phone redialing the bookingnummer over and over the whole mondaymorning. Even on the net I couldn't get through. My question: Why don't you do another week in the RAH and I'm sure that its gonna be sold out and than you can give the real fans a very good change to see the long waited concert. I phoned from The Netherlands to get a ticket. But friends of mine in the UK also can't get through to get tickets. And there is so much sorry for real fans to go to the reunion show.

And I'm in Arizona. It took an hour and a half of constantly trying to get through with the mouse in my right hand and speed dialing with a phone direct to RAH with my left hand. How truly fortunate I feel.\n\nPerhaps everyone who missed out might get a second chance if the management announcement is true; that bookings will be cancelled for those caught trying to resell them. Maybe the management could give these faithful fans first crack at those tickets?\n\nI can't stop thinking about this event. How will they play the break in Badge, a guest guitarist perhaps to play George Harrison's part? Maybe Dani Harrison? What about Steve Winwood for keyboards on a song or two? Or do they go it alone as a three piece? My wife and I will find out May 3rd.

Great site! \"I'm so glad\" Cream has reunited for some live shows; I've been waiting for this ever since your last interviews for a Cream video almost 10 years ago where all 3 members were up for it schedules permitting. Why not do a studio album with new songs? EC has developed into a good songwriter and now all you 5 (that includes Pete Brown and Janet)can collaborate and I know you can come up with some gems. It would be tops, probably along the lines and a little better than BBM's Around the Next Dream, which I absolutely love by the way.\n\nFor the live shows, I hope you guys kick some serious booty! Turn up that bass and get that distorted, aggressive and powerful tone that only guys like you, the Ox (may he rest in peace)and Mel Schacher (from Grand Funk Railroad)can get!!\n\nI didn't know about your illness until I checked out this website. May God give you many more years of a healthy, happy, loving, prosperous and productive life.\n\nGod Bless from your fan and friend in the Caribbean!!\n\nNAME: Rajshekhar Saha\n\nLOCATION: Bombay, India\n\nADDRESS: sahara_68@yahoo.co.in\n\nDate: 2/17/2005\n\nTime: 6:04:36 AM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nIts terrific to know that Cream is reuniting for a few concerts. Cream had started and opened the road for brilliance in musicianship in rock music.

Fear not a bit of the single malt, and NAE SKINKING WARES to keep you strong. A humble thought to share with you. Want to hear a roar from the crowd that will bring down the roof at Royal Albert Hall? Try surprising everybody with your fine rendition of MOTHER'S LAMENT - no performance royalties needed ! Oh, and please tell Eric that when he was trying to find the 1,3 beat on his Wheels of Fire Crossroads solo, but he ended up on the 2, 4 beat - it's SYN - CO - PA - TION - I hope I never hear him say that he can't take listening to that great solo - we should all be so lucky in our musical journeys. If you want to sell out another solid 4 shows, just come over here to Toronto, and pack 'em in at our SKYDOME ( holds about 59,000 - now called Rogers Centre). You'll get everybody up here from New York City to Montreal to Chicago coming up here, and they'll be glad to open the clamshell roof on a nice June, July or August summer's evening. We'd love to see you in Canada. Give my best to the greatest drummer in history, and that guy who plays a mean guitar. Keep practicin' boys.

The fact that somewhere between sessions with Cream you will read this note, is in itself reason to shout, 'I'm So Glad.' 'More God than Jack' your presence with us is a great kindness not only to yourself but to all of us who love you and your music. It seems only fitting that if one of your forefathers, Robert the Bruce,so titled due to fighting for political freedom, then like title befits one also who has fought for artistic freedom. Congradulations, mission accomplished.'Jack the Bruce' is well deserved. Not that the battle is over but this one thing you do, forgetting those things of the past,you press on engaging in the good fight of faith and musicianship. In like manner,passionate as well about musical excellence are your bandmates,Eric and Ginger. The synergy in Cream is clearly unequalled by any other band, then or now.The friendship formed decades ago stilldraws a total effort from each musician when playing together.Hence, the quality in music is magnified,not by the Marshalls but by the Spirit. Yet there is this growing attitude in each player-to extoll the talents of his bandmates more than his own.The Cream Team thereby propels itself to greater heights than ever before. \" Do you see one gifted in his craft, he will stand before kings and not mere men.\" From all corners of the earth people of reknown will come to the Royal Albert Hall to enjoy the liberation of their spirits through Cream. Even Mickey the Fiddler, would trade in his violin to hear this band but once. The new material joining the old will, like Bach's works, go down in musical history as the best in its category. The early sellout testifies to the global thirst for original music and talent. Ticket Agencies recognized the huge potential for concert demand. Not surprisingly, sales even at 10times the RAH price are doing very well. A credit to Cream if not to the rapacious scalpers. I wish Jack, above all else, that you continue to prosper and be in good health, even as your soul prospers. May you, Eric and Ginger have the best of times together.\n\nGratefully, John Flanagan\n\nNAME: Richard Millard\n\nLOCATION: California, US\n\nADDRESS: rsmillard@earthlink.net\n\nDate: 2/18/2005\n\nTime: 4:18:42 PM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nI read the announcement from the promoters regarding ticket sales for Cream and I have to say that it infuritated me.

Who wants to see 3 old men try to recapture musical magic that they cannot possibly capture? Not me! I'm so glad the Beatles broke up when they did and never reunited. Cream should forever be a memory. There, I said it.\n\nNAME: Ruediger\n\nLOCATION: Germany\n\nADDRESS: slippingaway@gmx.de\n\nDate: 3/10/2005\n\nTime: 11:45:59 AM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nHi Jack,\n\nOh well, now I'm really down as I'm in real trouble. First, I got no ticket in the ticket presale because all went to the touts. Then I won one for me and my friend each on ebay for the 6th of May, booked flight and hotel and no we won't get the ticket because the management together with ebay sorted those people out who sold their tickets on ebay so they won't get their tickets. Would have been better to get a travel insurance... NOW I'M PUNISHED TWICE!\n\nSadly Ruediger\n\nNAME: greg\n\nLOCATION:\n\nADDRESS: gregj929@netscape.net\n\nDate: 3/10/2005\n\nTime: 1:18:27 PM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\njack bruce you rock. i play electric bass to. i started i august do you have any sugestions\n\nNAME: Mark Albertson\n\nLOCATION: Norwalk, Connecticut\n\nADDRESS: Albrts24@aol.com\n\nDate: 3/10/2005\n\nTime: 9:49:10 PM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nDear Mr. Bruce, It is great to see that the greatest trio ever is getting back together. I hope new albums will also be a result of this new association. Music has certainly stagnated. I myself write. And I see a distinct lack of appreciation in the power of the written word. Too many artists it seems have prostituted their talents to produce subpar work for popularity and a quick buck. And for many it seems that popularity is fleeting at best. This cannot be said of Baker, Bruce and Clapton. The work produced here was certainly of creative high quality, unique and enduring. The best of luck. Sincerely, Mark Albertson\n\nNAME: Jacques James\n\nLOCATION: Europe\n\nADDRESS: jacques_james@gmx.net\n\nDate: 3/11/2005\n\nTime: 1:50:49 AM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nhi\n\nthough i finally got shadows in the air, i have little time to hear it. currently trying to catch up on my Cream knowledge. well, my car is hopping along the highway and i think even other people with they windows closed and other music on, are having a taste of it too.. fav song currently... Thales of brave Ulysses. i hope the play Mothers Lawnment (or what ever the title was again) as well on the concert. its the perfect pub song.. with a good pint in ones hand and a table full of friends.\n\nNAME: Boddah\n\nLOCATION: Pennsylvania, right near Philadelphia\n\nADDRESS: boddahbarry@yahoo.com\n\nDate: 3/12/2005\n\nTime: 4:32:24 AM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nHey Jack, Boddah here, just wanted to let you know that I'm still out here. I love your solo work a lot, especially Jet Set Jewel, you have such a way with words. Anyway, rather than sounding all ambiguous and cryptic I just like to know if you could contact me. You know how you had the wavy \"In\" t-shirt and Eric had the \"the out\" t-shirt, Wow I still actually remember that. Oh another stream of consciousness ... remember Roger Water's \"The Body\" album where he says \"his future is your past\" ... that's very strange indeed. Really, any sort of contact would be greatly appreciated.\n\nNAME: Terry Gruber\n\nLOCATION: West Virginia USA\n\nADDRESS: sturmvogel30@netscape.net\n\nDate: 3/12/2005\n\nTime: 2:49:34 PM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nI have aspired to acheive your excellence on the bass ever since I heard you as a new 11-year-old bassist in 1966. Though my quest never took me to your heights, the effort put me in the \"pretty damn good\" range.

Almost as amazing was the chance to play in a band with your son Malcolm-hope the reunion gig works out and will be there if at all possible.\n\nNAME: Ron Dolce\n\nLOCATION: Evanston, Ill.

The thought of three of the music world's most forward thinking artists getting back together just to bang out old hits and make a pile of money doesn't quite connect. However, the thought of those artists bringing thirty-seven years of musical and life experiences to their performances and possibly creating something really new is incredibly exciting. Having read some of your and Ginger Baker's comments and having heard your evolution as musicians I have to believe that your reunion concerts will be artistic achievements beyond belief. Circumstances do not allow me to attend but I can wish the three of you the best of luck than and always.\n\nNAME: Patrick Breen\n\nLOCATION: Detroit,MI\n\nADDRESS: pbreen27@yahoo.com\n\nDate: 3/18/2005\n\nTime: 2:23:38 PM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nGlad to hear about the Cream reunion shows.

I know it probably will not happen, but if Cream decides to play any dates in the USA please play Atlanta. I last saw you play with Ringo at the Chastain Amphitheater a few years ago. Unfortunately, I never got to see Cream when I was a young man, I grew up in the Richmond, VA area and Cream never played Ricmond. However, Cream was the first rock band to play at Chastain Park hear in Atlanta, I have heard Alex Cooley and Peter Conlon the local promoters talk about it. That must have been some concert as Chastain only holds a few thousand people. Since there are so many people that would like to see Cream live and so few available seats to these concerts, could you guys put together a simulcast of the concert to be broadcast to local theaters. Yes, performed a live simulcast for the release of their latest project a year or so ago and it was pretty cool. At least please release a DVD & CD of the event.

I'm 26 and have been listening to Cream since high school. I just wish I could go to London for all of the shows. I definitely am looking forward to the DVD. I hope a deluxe box-set will be offered. I saw Phish's last concert ever at a movie theater because there was a live link. If Cream offered the same option for fans far away I would be much appreciative. I can hardly wait to hear what Tales of Brave Ulysses will sound like.

It was a relief to read that you've recovered, and we hope you're as strong as ever. We see you every time you come to Cleveland and you always remember us because we named my oldest daughter Victoria Sage.\n\nWe're very excited about the Cream reunion, but missed our opportunity to buy tickets before they sold out. We're willing to pay internet scalpers prices, but after reading statements from management we're affraid these tickets might not be issued.\n\nIf tickets are not issued to scalpers caught on the internet will they be available again for legitimate box office sale? And if so when? I'd hate to miss a second opportunity to purchase them. Can someone please let us know?\n\nYou're in our hearts Jack, be well.\n\nJim Horn\n\nNAME: ian davey\n\nLOCATION: althorne essex uk\n\nADDRESS: ian@idavey.wanadoo.co.uk\n\nDate: 3/27/2005\n\nTime: 11:29:56 AM\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nDear Jack, If the Cream's re-union concert is to be filmed, plaese don't let Tony Parlmer have anything to do with it!!!!!!!!!
