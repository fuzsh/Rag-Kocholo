        "text": "1983 was the starting year for an interdisciplinary and sustainability oriented education program at the former university college in Östersund, located in the Mid Sweden mountain region. In this paper – 30 years later - the different phases that the educational program has passed over the years is examined with an entrepreneurial focus. In 1983 the “slogan” for the education was: “Ecology, economy and technology in cooperation for sustainable development”. One of the main ideas was to have a problem solving and entrepreneurial focus in the education. The goal was that the students should be prepared to start their own businesses after graduating, based on ideas they had developed during the education. The first years the program was two years in length, partly based on the idea to not “wear out” eager entrepreneurs with too many study years. Later a third year was added, to fulfill the bachelor’s level. In the late 1990’s the education had become part of Mid Sweden University, which during that period were struggling for full University status. This put pressure towards “academization” of the education program, which had its benefits but also its problems from the entrepreneurship angle. During the first decade after the millennia shift the education took a more international focus attracting students from many countries all over the world. A Master’s level was also added to the program and the first graduate students received their Ph.D. during this period. The latest development is to split the Bachelor’s program into three “sister” programs: the Ecoengineers with a more traditional engineer focus (but still interdisciplinary), the Ecoentrepreneurs with less chemistry and math, but more social entrepreneur and green procurement courses, and the Ecotechnology students standing in between as the most interdisciplinary students."
