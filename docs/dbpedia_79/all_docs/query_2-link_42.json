        "text": "About the programme\n\nOur master’s programme offers quality education with strong links to current research within the area of tourism and human geography. The programme is associated with ETOUR, www.miun.se/etour, a leading tourism research centre in Northern Europe.\n\nThe tourism industry is currently experiencing radical changes. Now, more than ever, new visions, creativity and shifting priorities are required to help transform tourism into a more sustainable industry. The Master’s programme in Tourism Studies invites students from different subject area and backgrounds to contribute with their experience and knowledge to a more sustainable future, and build a career in the tourism industry or adjacent research fields.\n\nThe programme offers in-depth courses within the field of tourism and human geography, focusing on issues relating to sustainability. As a student you take part in an interesting combination of courses, study visits and independent research. All teachers are active researchers and keep students up to date with the latest findings within their respective fields. Having completed your studies, you have a strong track record that gives you the opportunity to work in leading positions and to conduct research in a global context. After completing your studies, you have the choice of a degree in tourism or human geography.\n\nThe programme is taught in English and is offered at Campus Östersund, which is an ideal environment for studying tourism and sustainable development. Close proximity to the Swedish and Norwegian mountains means that students can easily access many of the region’s top destinations. Since the programme is linked to the ETOUR (European Tourism Research Institute), it enables students to participate in current research and develop international contacts.\n\nChoose between One or Two-year Master’s programmes\n\nThe initial six courses within the one-year Master’s programme (60 ECTS) are identical to the two-year equivalent (120 ECTS). The one-year programme concludes after two semesters with a thesis project of 15 ECTS. If you are interested in continuing your studies and getting a more in-depth education in the field of tourism, you have a possibility to apply to a two year Master’s programme of 120 ECTS. You will follow additional courses, i.e. Applied Research (15 ECTS), a thesis project (30 ECTS), as well as an Internship or an exchange in another university (30 ECTS). Please note that a Masters’s degree of 60 ECTS (Magister) is well-established in Sweden but might not be recognized as a full Master’s degree in some countries, where 120 ECTS are required.\n\nThe structure of the teaching\n\nLectures, group discussions, field trips, seminars and supervision.\n\nTeaching is in English and is campus-based unless otherwise is stated in the syllabus.\n\nEntry requirements\n\nA bachelor' s degree of at least 180 credits (ECTS) and English course 6/English course B from Swedish Upper Secondary School (Gymnasium) or the equivalent.\n\nTitle of qualification\n\nMagisterexamen\n\nMagisterexamen med huvudområdet turismvetenskap alternativt kulturgeografi\n\ntranslated into\n\nDegree of Master of Science (60 credits) with a major in Tourism Studies or Human Geography\n\nAfter the programme\n\nOur graduates can be found in several different positions in both the public and private sectors. Our graduates work as destination planners, analysts, or in tourism services and destination development. The program provides a basis for further studies at the graduate level. Mid Sweden University itself offers a PhD program in tourism studies.\n\nWork experience contact\n\nThrough this education, students are able to develop working contacts for the future with leading players in the tourism industry. The students' in-depth research paper allows them to foster interaction with the tourism sector, which can also lead to future internships or jobs"
