        "text": "The Accuro ultrasound from RIVANNA is AdvaMed's #DeviceOfTheWeek. It is designed to ensure pregnant patients with scoliosis, prior back injuries or surgery, or obesity can safely receive an epidural to ease labor pain. The portable device combines AI overlays of anatomical structures with real-time identification of spinal landmarks to guide precise anesthesia placement. Accuro can significantly improve patient outcomes, alleviate anxieties, and enhance the confidence of health care professionals. Take a look at this case in which Accuro bridged the complexities of severe scoliosis to ensure successful epidural placement. https://lnkd.in/epviN6gv\n\nGreat news for hand surgeons worldwide!🇬🇧🎉 The British Society for Surgery of the Hand (BSSH) has just released our new Standards for scaphoid fracture management! This resource is designed to be a helpful guide for surgeons to improve the management of these often complex fractures. The Standards use a clear and concise flowchart 📊 to illustrate the diagnostic and treatment pathway for scaphoid fractures. This flowchart includes considerations for presentation and referral, 🧭 specialist assessment, 👨⚕️ operative procedures, 🩻 and discharge and follow up.🚶♀️ Here are some of the key features of the Standards: * Uses an extensive evidence base 🎓 * Provides a clear and concise treatment pathway 🛣️ * Document and flow chart cover all bases * Can be used as a quick reference guide in a busy clinical setting 🏥 I encourage all hand surgeons to take a look at this valuable resource! You can find it on the BSSH website: (https://lnkd.in/eqirJH4x) Please share this post with your colleagues who may be interested! Huge thanks to Will Mason and the team at British Society for Surgery of the Hand for their hard work on this. #BSSH #scaphoidfracture #standards #handsurgery #wristfracture #orthopaedics #surgeons #medicine #healthcare"
