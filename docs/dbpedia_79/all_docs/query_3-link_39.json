        "text": "World Para Ice Hockey has released the competition schedule for the World Championships B-Pool, which will take place from 6-11 October in in Astana, Kazakhstan.\n\nThe event, hosted by the National Paralympic Committee (NPC) of Kazakhstan at Terlan Arena, will feature Slovakia, Sweden, Japan, Finland, Great Britain and the host nation. The tournament will be in a round-robin format with the top two finishers being promoted to the 2024 A-Pool and the last placed team relegated to the 2024 C-Pool.\n\nThis will be the ninth edition of the World Para Ice Hockey Championships B-Pool and the third time it is being hosted in Asia. None of the six teams taking part have ever won the B-Pool title. Great Britain won bronze in 2013, Japan took silver in 2013 and 2017, Slovakia won silver in 2019 and bronze in 2017 and 2015, and Sweden won silver in 2015, 2012, 2009 and bronze in 2021.\n\nCompetition begins on 6 October with a high-stakes matchup between Scandinavian nations Sweden and Finland. The former claimed bronze at the last World Championships B-Pool in while the latter finished fifth. The two teams faced each other in the opening day of the last edition of the event, with Sweden recording a 6-0 shutout.\n\nAnother matchup to keep tabs on will be the host nation’s opener against Slovakia. It will mark the first time Kazakhstan — which started its programme only five years ago — competes in the event after finishing second at the World Championships C-Pool last season. Slovakia, meanwhile, has been relegated from the A-Pool and will enter as the No. 1 seed after gaining experience at their first Paralympic Winter Games last year.\n\nThe competition will conclude with a rematch of the C-Pool gold-medal game, as Kazakhstan tries to exact revenge on Great Britain.\n\nHere is a look at the complete competition schedule*.\n\nFriday, 6 October\n\n11:00 Finland vs. Sweden\n\n15:00 Great Britain vs. Japan\n\n19:00 Kazakhstan vs. Slovakia\n\nSaturday, 7 October\n\n11:00 Sweden vs. Great Britain\n\n15:00 Slovakia vs. Finland\n\n19:00 Japan vs. Kazakhstan\n\nSunday, 8 October\n\n11:00 Slovakia vs. Great Britain\n\n15:00 Sweden vs. Japan\n\n19:00 Kazakhstan vs. Finland\n\nMonday, 9 October\n\nRest Day\n\nTuesday, 10 October\n\n11:00 Japan vs. Slovakia\n\n15:00 Finland vs. Great Britain\n\n19:00 Sweden vs. Kazakhstan\n\nWednesday, 11 October\n\n11:00 Japan vs. Finland\n\n15:00 Slovakia vs. Sweden\n\n19:00 Great Britain vs. Kazakhstan\n\n*The schedule is based on local time in Astana (UTC +6)."
