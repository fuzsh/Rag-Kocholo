        "text": "Geographically, Mid Sweden University is located in the middle of Sweden, right at the heart of Northern Europe. It is a young university, but its roots go back more than 150 years.\n\nAs early as in 1842, in the same year as the elementary school was established in Sweden, the decision was taken to place a teachers’ education college in Härnösand. Teacher’s education is still highly valued at Mid Sweden University and today, Mid Sweden University has two campuses, Sundsvall and Östersund, with approximately 15 000 students. Around 50 percent are campus students, while the rest engage in distance studies via net based courses and programmes.\n\nEvery year students from all over the world come to study at Mid Sweden University, and we firmly believe that the international element of any education is a measurement of quality. We have partnerships with a number of universities around the world for the exchange of students and staff. We offer courses for international students at all two campuses.\n\nAs a university, we provide higher education of a high standard on undergraduate, post-graduate, and research study levels. We offer a wide range of course programmes within the social sciences, behavioural sciences, media, nursing, teachers’ education, information technology, natural sciences, technology, and languages as well as other subjects within the humanities."
