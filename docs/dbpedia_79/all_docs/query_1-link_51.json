        "text": "The Oncoplastic Breast Consortium (OPBC) consists of oncologic, oncoplastic and plastic breast surgeons, a strong patient advocacy group, and radiation oncologists who are specialized in breast cancer research and treatment.\n\nThe consortium focuses on oncoplastic breast conserving surgery, nipple/skin sparing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction and optimal flat closure after conventional mastectomy. Importantly, the OPBC also aims at imÂ­proving quality of life by axillary surgery de-escalation.\n\nOur mission is to continuously improve oncologic breast surgery by bringing international experts together, promoting high-quality education and performing international multicenter studies.\n\nThe activities of this independent non-profit organization are coordinated by one single oncoplastic surgeon per country. Every breast surgeon, radiation oncologist and patient advocate across the world who is interested in oncoplastic surgery is welcome to register as a member.\n\nMembers are regularly informed by newsletters on specific training opportunities, meetings, events, congresses and courses that are considered recommendable by the OPBC coordinators. In addition, members are invited to attend the OPBC consensus conferences, watch the panel at work and participate in audience voting.\n\nThe OPBC currently consists of 834 members from 93 countries."
