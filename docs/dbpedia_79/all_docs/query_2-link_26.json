        "text": "The 2021 World Para Ice Hockey Championships B-Pool will take place from 17-22 September in Ostersund, Sweden.\n\nSix teams will compete, with the top three finishers advancing to the Paralympic Qualification Tournament later this year, and the top two finishers also being promoted to the A-Pool for the 2022-23 season.\n\nWe have broken down what you need to know about each team and now is time for the number one seed and host nation Sweden.\n\nBackground: The sport of Para ice hockey was founded in Sweden in the 1960’s. The country was the first Paralympic champions in the sport and has three World Championship A-Pool medals to its name. Despite its rich history, several of Sweden’s players have aged in recent years and it looks to remain in top contention. It will rely on its advantage as the host nation of this tournament to keep its Paralympic Winter Games hopes alive.\n\nWorld Ranking: 7th\n\nWorld Championships History:\n\n2019 A-Pool: 7th place\n\n2017 A-Pool: 6th place\n\n2015 B-Pool: 2nd place\n\n2013 A-Pool: 8th place\n\n2012 B-Pool: 2nd place\n\n2009 B-Pool: 2nd place\n\n2004 A-Pool: 3rd place\n\n2000 A-Pool: 3rd place\n\n1996 A-Pool: 1st place\n\nAthlete to Watch: Defender Niklas Ingvarsson has been participating in the sport since 2000 and is the only athlete left on the team from when it last won a World Championship A-Pool medal in 2004. He was also a member of Sweden’s bronze-medal winning team at the Salt Lake City 2002 Paralympic Games. At the Ostrava 2019 World Championships A-Pool, he led Sweden with four goals.\n\nMatchup to Watch: Sweden vs. Finland at 17:00 on 17 September will reveal how much Sweden has stayed in shape during the pandemic and will pit these two new rivals against each other for the first time in history at the World Championships.\n\nSweden roster:\n\nGoaltenders:\n\nUlf Nilsson\n\nStaffan Siren\n\nDefensemen:\n\nAnders Winstrand\n\nNiklas Ingvarsson\n\nPeter Nilsson\n\nJohan Strandmark"
