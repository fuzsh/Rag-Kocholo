        "text": "Craig’s grandpa was a builder and his father an electrical contractor, so growing up he spent almost as much time on a construction site as he did in school. After high school, he spent another 12 years working in the construction trades and gaining a deep understanding of how buildings are put together. At 30, Craig was eager to take this knowledge to the next level, so he and his wife Kara moved from Ketchum to San Luis Obispo to study Architectural Engineering at California Polytechnic State University. In 2005, Craig moved back home to Ketchum with his wife, two young kids and a BS degree from CalPoly. He spent the next 8 years working for Ruscitto/Latham/Blanton as a project engineer gaining architectural engineering skills and experience until 2014 when he started his own company, Maxwell Structural Design Studio.\n\nCraig is calm, structured, and hard working. He finds enjoyment in challenging projects, finding answers to complicated problems, and collaborating with strong minds to come up with creative, constructible solutions to each unique design situation.\n\nA fourth generation Idahoan (the Maxwell family moved to the mountains of Idaho in the late 1800’s under the Homestead Act of 1862), Craig’s heart and soul are rooted in the natural beauty of the mountains.\n\nAllie is an architectural designer, who works collaboratively with the office’s engineers to craft thoughtful and efficient designs. She graduated from California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo with a Bachelor of Architecture degree and a minor in sustainability. After working on a wide range of projects in California and Portland, she moved back to the Wood River Valley, where she grew up. She loves the scale of design the valley has to offer and its opportunities to craft unique spaces and details specific to each site and resident. Outside of the office, you will find her hiking, camping, and snowboarding in the mountains or hanging out in a park with her family.\n\nChase was born and raised in the Wood River Valley. As a kid, he spent many hours on his dad’s BC Builders job sites around the valley where he whet his appetite for construction and eventually spent a few summers working for his dad. After graduating from University of Portland with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, he got a job making windows for Pella, and eventually became the Quality Engineer at the Portland facility. After too many years away from the Wood River Valley, he finally escaped the rain and moved back to the mountains and the snow with his wife. Chase enjoys spending his free time climbing peaks, skiing, mountain biking, running, and making furniture.\n\nA Ketchum native, Jack joined Maxwell Structural Design Studio in 2020 after graduating from Montana State University with a degree in Industrial Engineering. Jack returned to the Wood River Valley for the community and to enjoy all that it has to offer. He enjoys working collaboratively with his colleagues at MSDS to embrace challenges and find creative solutions for his clients. When he’s not in the office, Jack spends winters skiing and coaching the local high school hockey team. In the summers, you can find him chasing spring runoff in his kayak and fishing around the state from his drift boat."
