        "text": "Whether or not you believe in global warming and climate change, here are some facts to consider:\n\n19 of the 20 hottest years have occurred since 1980\n\nWorldwide temperatures have warmed one degree Celsius over the 20th century\n\nMore than 20% of the Polar Ice Cap has melted in the past 30 years\n\nClimate change can result in more air pollution and problems with water supplies as precipitation patterns change. The effects are much greater at extreme latitudes on both ends of the earth and at higher elevations.\n\nWe don’t know with certainty what the future will bring, but that doesn’t mean you do nothing. Just the opposite. Develop a well-thought-out and logical plan for your resort.\n\nIntelligent snowmaking investments will continue to help stabilize your mountain resort business. Adapting strategies and practices in anticipation of less natural snow, and less snowmaking time under the condition of higher snowmaking temperatures coming in smaller windows, will force your team to improve. The goal is to improve your energy intensity or the energy used per cubic foot of product produced.\n\nAs the famous scientist Pascal claimed, “…given the possible outcomes, the upside of being prepared and ready for a fearsome event surely beats the alternative.”\n\nWeather volatility is here and is not going away, and our ability to forecast the weather remains difficult for more than about seven days out. Your continuing investment in snowmaking and working with companies like SMI that have experienced, talented people and products can only help improve your chances for success.\n\nUnderstand existing snowgun flow rates at 28°F, 24°F and 20°F wet bulb, and do not just believe the manufacturers. Go out and measure water and air flows with flowmeters. And check snow quality and snow density. What happens if conditions move up or down 2°F?\n\nMounts for snow guns matter. Generally, the taller the tower, the better the production – up to about 40 feet in height. Any taller and the support mechanisms become quite significant. Wind impact is also a big consideration above 40 feet.\n\nAir flow rates have a direct cost correlation to energy costs so define air volume closely.\n\nWhat is the range of performance for your snowgun fleet?\n\nOn/off snow guns\n\nOne valve and flow steps\n\nMultiple valves and flow step\n\nInfinite adjust of air and water\n\nWhat happens to snow quality?\n\nHow does your on/off work when it is marginal or cold?\n\nSweet spot is likely about 4°F of range!\n\nThese are some areas for your team to focus on as the snow guns utilized remain the biggest predictor for costs.\n\nAs you evaluate snowmaking at your resort, focus on the variables you can control.\n\n1. Where to Start? Define your operating costs:\n\nEnergy, labor, maintenance, depreciation, additive and transportation\n\nWhat is your grooming cost to push out the piles?\n\nHistorical water volumes\n\nHistorical hours of operation\n\nHistorical average temperatures and humidities by month\n\nInventory water and air systems\n\nInventory hydrants and snow guns\n\nInventory snow gun types and mounts\n\n2. Work Through Start Up Scenarios:\n\nWho is defining the opening strategy?\n\nTrails, depth, full width?\n\nAre you making snow on the right trails guest desire?\n\nOr is your focus the easy to make snow on trails?\n\nDo you have the correct snow guns on trails?\n\nAre you using lowE on 250’ wide trails?\n\nHow long does it take to change trails and startup snow guns?\n\nHow much water can you convert to snow at 28°F wet bulb, 25°F wet bulb?\n\n3. Evaluate Existing Snow Gun Fleet:\n\nWhat are the water and air flows consumed at three different temperatures? (see “Understanding Snow Gun Flow Rates” in previous section)\n\n4. Evaluate Snow gun Options. (See “Snow Gun Choices” in previous section)\n\n5. Fixed Position Versus Portable. Moving from portable snow guns to fixed position snow guns can result in huge savings on primary trails. When you consider set up time, burying snow guns, digging out snow guns and the time to take down and put away or park, these costs and difficult work environment are a real challenge. The labor and lost snowmaking time generally justify a fixed snow gun on primary trails.\n\nNow it certainly depends on winds, trail, priority, existing infrastructure, snow volume per snow gun and other factors to help determine if fixed position snow guns will be effective. SMI has many manual customers that can start 150 fan snow guns in less than an hour with five snowmakers. The key is they are towers with the cords, hoses and orientation ready to go. Add automation and they can be started even faster.\n\nSome larger resorts with ground air guns on sleds or tripods may make three ribbons on a 200’ wide trail. In other words, they set up on the far 1/3 of the trail and make snow, then move all 50 guns over 60 feet to hit the middle third and so on. Why not just add tower fans that throw the entire width?\n\n6. Grooming Costs. Are you using lowE towers or small throw air snow guns with little throw on 200’+ wide trails? So the snow is basically positioned in a big butterfly pile 20’ to 70’ from the snow gun. So grooming times are huge to push it across the trail to get to full width. So instead of 30 hours cat time to open, it may take 90 hours. At $100/ hour that is $6,000. Using oscillating tower fans will cut time down dramatically.\n\n7. Automation Levels. The majority of snowmaking snowgun automation is with fixed position snow guns. Consider the height of the tower and the convenience of access for service and maintenance. Automation factors to consider are many and include starting, adjusting and stopping/draining. Is the start full open or throttling with pressure control? Does the adjustment involve valves and pressure control? Does the snow gun shutdown and drain on fault or power loss? Is there intelligence at the snow gun? Can it run without communications or a link to the master computer? What is the flow range of the snow gun at your resort? What type of communications are used? Hardwire, fiber optic and radio modems are commonly used today in snowmaking."
