        "text": "Arsenal found out their Europa League round of 32 opponents today as they were drawn against a rather unknown quantity in Ostersund.\n\nHaving overcome Red Star Belgrade, Koln and BATE Borisov in the group stages, Arsene Wenger's quest to finally win a title across European competition will restart in the new year as his side first visit Sweden on February 15 before hosting the second leg at the Emirates Stadium a week later.\n\nSo what can fans, and the players expect when they face Ostersund later in the campaign?\n\nWell, here's everything you need to know,\n\nWho are Ostersund?\n\nFounded on October 31 1996 - after Wenger was appointed Arsenal manager - Ostersunds Fotbollsklubb are an first division club in Sweden having gained promotion to the top tier for the first time in their history during the 2016 season.\n\nWhat's their stadium like?\n\nThe Jamtkraft Arena was opened in July 2007 and has capacity of 8,466.\n\nWho is the manager?\n\nGraham Potter. His name might not instantly jump out at many fans of English football - or across Europe for that matter - but he's a former Three Lions u21 international and also has eight Premier League appearances under his belt for Southampton.\n\nIn fact, he replaced Simon Charlton in the Saints' 6-3 win over Manchester United at the Dell in 1996, although his overall playing career was fairly lowkey as he played for as many as 11 different teams in the Football League, including Birmingham City, Stoke City and West Brom before finishing his career at Maccelsfield Town.\n\nHe worked as a football development manager for the University of Hull and as assistant coach for the England Universities Squad before being appointed by Ostersunds in December 2010 where he intially signed a three-year deal to become the club's third English manager after Neil McDonald and Lee Makel.\n\nHow has Potter fared in Sweden?\n\nExtremely well. Under his guidance, Ostersunds have simply gone from strength to strength and that's been made even more evident with their progress this season.\n\nWhen Potter was appointed the club were in the Swedish fourth tier but by 2013 they were in the second division following back-to-back promotions and that earned him a three-year contract extension as a result for his efforts in such a short space of time.\n\nIt would get even better two years later as he oversaw the club's promotion to the Allsvenskan after finishing second. Considering this is Potter's first venture into management, it's safe to say he's doing a fine job.\n\nHow successful are Ostersunds domestically?\n\nNot as successful as the likes of Malmo, IFK Goteborg, Helsingborgs or AIK which is understandable as they've only been a club for 21 years. However, they've still been able to add some silveware to their trophy cabinet.\n\nIn 2012 they won Swedish Football Division 1 title (which sealed promotion to the second tier) and then won their first major honour with success in last season's Svenska Cupen (Swedish cup final), after defeating IFK Norrköping 4–1 which then saw them qualify for Europa League.\n\nWhat's their European campaign been like?\n\nThrown into the deep end immediately, Ostersunds were paired with Turkish giants Galatasaray in the second qualifying round and advanced - to the surprise of many - 3-1 on aggregate and then overcame Luxembourg outfit CS Fola Esch in the next stage.\n\nAll that stood between them and a place in the group phase of the competition was a play-off tie with PAOK and after losing the first-leg 3-1 it seemed those dreams weren't to be realised, but they rallied at the Jamtkraft Arena to win 2-0 and progress via the away goals rule.\n\nDrawn in Group J alongside Athletic Club, Hertha Berlin and Zorya Luhansk, the Swedish outfit finished as runners-up to the La Liga side having accumulated the same number points and that's set up an intriguing two-legged tie with the Gunners in the new year.\n\nWhat are the club's ambitions?\n\nIt's plain and simple; win the league title and reach the Champions League proper. Potter confirmed this in an interview when talking about the chairman Daniel Kindberg.\n\n\"My chairman is an ambitious guy. He wants to win the Allsvenskan and then get into the Champions League. That's the end goal.\n\n\"Six years ago when we were in the fourth tier of Swedish football that sounded like he needed to go to some institution.\n\n\"It's still the aim. That's what we want to try to do and work towards.\"\n\nWho are the key players for Ostersunds?\n\nCurtis Edwards and Jamie Hopcutt are the two English players in the squad. Strikers Saman Ghoddos and Ahaji Gero netted two goals apiece in the group phase, while the former is also a creative spark.\n\nWhat is Ostersunds' style of play?\n\nPotter has shown a preference to play a 4-4-2 formation. Although, the 42-year-old has shown a tacticial flexibility in Europe this season as he deployed a 3-4-3 system in the 2-2 home draw with Athletic Club and stuck with it for the reverse game as well as the 2-0 win over Zorya.\n\nAn emphasis to focus their attacks down either flank, Ostersunds favour a possession game and to control the game in the opposition's half. However, they can be found wanting when it comes to defending set-pieces.\n\nFun facts\n\nOstersunds are the first Swedish club to progress beyond the Europa League group stage.\n\nWith three wins out of six, only three English managers have more Europa League victories (excluding qualifiers) than Potter; Roy Hodgson (10/21), Steve McClaren (6/18) and Alan Pardew (4/12).\n\nSwansea City and Ostersunds built up a relationship in 2007 as Kindberg used his friendship with then manager Roberto Martinez to ensure the Swans played the inauguration game at the newly built Jamtkraft Arena.\n\nAs part of this link, the Premier League outfit signed Modou Barrow in the summer of 2014.\n\nChelsea youngster Jamal Blackman had a loan spell at the club during their first season in the top flight of Swedish football and wound up making 12 league appearances.\n\nRonald Mukiibi is one of several Arsenal fans in the Ostersund squad and before the draw told Swedish paper Sportbladet about wanting to meet Arsene Wenger:\n\n\"I want to play Arsenal. It has been my team since I was little; it would mean a lot.\"\n\n\"I want to have a few words with Wenger and ask him about his starting XIs.\n\n\"I want to talk to him about why he makes certain decisions.\"\n\nThen after the draw was made Mukiibi said: \"I texted the lads and just screamed out loud. It's insane. To face the team I've supported all my life. Who would have thought?\"\n\nHe added: \"I hoped to play for Arsenal at Emirates, but now I get to play against Arsenal at the same ground. Life takes mysterious turns.\""
