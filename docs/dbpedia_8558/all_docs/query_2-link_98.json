She now lives in Ecuador but returned to New York over the weekend, joining friends and collaborators on the Ladies Love Project 2012 Holiday Pop-Up Shop. The “marketa”style event on Saturday showcased works by local artists and designers, drawing a huge crowd to the Lower East Side’s University Settlement and inspiring everyone via lyrical performances, poetry, music and major art styles in the spotlight. Must applaud the efforts of Ladies Love Project, a collaboration between TOOFLY, PattyDukes, RephStar and A.Mari, who each take what they do seriously and have fun doing it. Enlighten, empower and encouraging young women to live their best lives. Yes, the Ladies Love Project is on point. Lead by example!\n\nRecommended:\n\nTOOFLY: http://www.tooflynyc.com/\n\nLadies Love Project on Tumblr: http://ladiesloveproject.tumblr.com/\n\nA.Mari at FOKUS: http://fokus.org/\n\nPattyDukes: http://pattydukes.wordpress.com/\n\nCirca95: http://www.circa95.com/Circa_95/Home.html"
