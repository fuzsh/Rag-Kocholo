        "text": "Living and creating a more whimsical life can be a doorway to opening your conscious awareness and expanding into more of your powerful potentials as spirit in flesh. I find these long August days offering a beautiful landscape for this kind of exploration, as the light shifts and the land stills so loudly with the melodies of a Summer well spent held in each golden grain.\n\nWhen you intentionally decide to cultivate living with a sense of wonder, dropping into the sacredness of presence, fall in love with the everyday of Earth’s treasure chest of sensory experiences, seek the adventure of a small stretch into new terrains of thinking, feeling, and being, play more, luxuriate in the simple more, and choose to expand your curiosity without judgment or expectation, you find yourself aligning more with life and cocreating with vibrational resonance, what you’d like to experience more of. You also find yourself becoming much more centered and aware.\n\nSometimes unplugging fully for small periods of time allows this space of expansion to occur. It also helps you to be present with the power of your consciousness. Finding ways to deepen into the wisdom of Nature and leaning into more enchanted invitations that surround you daily, can assist you in rewriting beliefs to match your hopes for life. This can also include finding your own creative outlet to channel life force through as a way to engage your innate abilities.\n\nThe more the years go by, the more I drop into this state ever-more fluidly and consistently. It is my anchor in a world that vibrationally oscillates so vastly. It doesn’t matter to me how this appears to others, as for me it can mean the difference between vitality or not. I choose to live touched by inspiration and moved by creativity.\n\nAnd Nature will forever be a muse for me since it IS the spirit in flesh. The two are not separate.\n\nWe are multi-dimensional by nature and therefore all information we seek is always a conscious awareness away. We’ve been taught to believe information is repressed or hidden. It merely isn’t being acknowledged, interpreted, or engaged, but is always right there. To accept and embrace the knowledge within is all we may be missing. The conscious mind embodies both camps of reason and assimilation of emotions and intuitive knowledge. One is not better than the other, nor are they inaccessible or separate. The conscious mind is the bridge that empowers both.\n\nI ponder much held in my rich spaciousness of Nature’s arms and undo, thread by thread, the beliefs that I’ve gathered from all sources over life. Be it even “New Age” thinking, I release the hands I once accepted to a new invitation from The All to spread my wings further.\n\nIllusions are dropping away and with it there is greater lightness of being experienced AND yes, instant magickal experiences just as my imagination has always pondered.\n\nThere are new light codes streaming in and the more naked I am to stronghold beliefs of any kind, the more I tap into my awareness of consciousness and the answers that are right there.\n\nAnd with “no time” as the truth of experience, I am not tethered by ideas that limit my power to create anew. Things CAN be simple and easy. At least that is what I believe and therefore it is becoming my experience.\n\nI spend all of our time while hiking and being in Nature for reflecting, releasing, rewriting, and renewing myself on all levels. I find it the easiest and most supportive way for myself to do this during what is to me a form of walking meditation and movement of energy. And through any challenge that has or will arise, it is my sanctum and way shower to the source of divine inspiration and liberation within.\n\nThe day before the New Moon we did one of our longer hikes through magickal spaces, up to one of the many lakes.\n\nAlong the way there were many faery portals.\n\nWe then came across this sweet bumblebee nestled in a thistle.\n\nThis little one had transitioned in the many petaled arms of this bloom. Dave and I were both taken by this sight and the layers of profoundness it evoked. This was the second time we’ve seen the exact same sight of a bumblebee held in his deathbed of a thistle. It’s so powerful that even Dave was inspired to write a poem about it the first time we came upon this.\n\nThere’s such bitter sweetness of the wholeness this vision brings up. And such perfection of the life cycles all wrapped into one seamless and evocative image. I also love the message of living life to the fullest to the very last breath – taking in the sweet nectar of life every single moment, as if it’s your last.\n\nFrom which you come, you return. From which you give, you receive. From which you are, you “bee.”\n\nI felt extra strength and nurturing around this womb of renewal with our recent New Moon of 8/4. In fact, just a couple of weeks prior I had yet another pregnancy dream (I have had so many of these in the last ten plus months) and on the day of the New Moon itself, quite the divine (and mother energy) messenger.\n\nWe were taking a downtime day from very active days, to just soak in a favorite rest spot under the Giant Elder Juniper again. After our picnic lunch, Dave proceeded to read and nap and I proceeded to my usual exploration walk around the lake. It is set in a park that also edges a forest and the river. It’s a place for families and while off the beaten track, is behind a neighborhood.\n\nAbout a third of my walk around I came to the turn before hitting the other side of the lake and on the trail ahead I saw a black bear. We both stopped and stood totally still watching each other and connecting. The bear appeared the usual dark black in the shade of the trees.\n\nThe bear didn’t move and we maintained our stance for 15-20 seconds. Just beyond the bear is where more people were along the lake. But here, we held our own experience in the in between on this Leo New Moon.\n\nIt was the first time I encountered bear on my own, as usually I’m with Dave. So, like the golden bear that climbed our fence to peer at me through my office sliding glass door, this “big” energy was meant just for me.\n\nThere was no threat, as we held equal gaze and energy, yet I backed away slowly to ensure the bear knew my intentions were soft and harmonious and that I honored the sacredness of her presence.\n\nI went back about fifty feet, as she watched. Then she turned to make her way into the forest toward the river. As she did so I then saw a remarkable thing. When the light of the sun touched her fur it revealed her entire coat to be gold just like the bear who came to my office door.\n\nNew Moon blessings indeed and a powerful harbinger of this potent doorway opening between then and 8/8/8. I loved the symbolism of this cycle creating a darkening of the Moon – the black bear in the shadows – but on the other side of that is complete illumination that the continuum of the cycle does eventually reveal come the Full Moon. Both are contained in one and a New Moon indeed heralds a rebirth and access to the inner light ever-present and ever-unfolding.\n\nThe rest of my time along the lake banks was filled with frog and toad energy again – some truly giant toads too! I can never get a photo of them because they move fast, but I’ve seen them sitting there as big as both of my palms together and saw one swimming with legs outstretched about two feet long! I’ve never seen any so large and when they leap into the water it makes a huge splash. That’s some really potent frog messengers indeed!\n\nThe late Summer blooms were out and the edges of the water, everywhere, were lined with mostly goose feathers and down glistening in the sunlight and water sparkles.\n\nThey felt like feathers from the wings of angels scattered about with auras of starlight and yet still embodying their divinity in every single, tiny one.\n\nWe had taken the previous week off from backpacking in order to get some things done around here and just do some simple hikes, bike rides, and beach days. But come Tuesday we were off on another adventure – our fifth so far this season.\n\nWe returned to one of the lakes from our very first backpacking trip, where we got the idea for a hammock. This time we stayed there the full trip, as it’s easier to hunker down rather than move each day, break down and set up camp. We were away two nights in the doorway between the New Moon and Lion’s Gate.\n\nThe trail was beautiful with several small and large lily ponds, many fields of blooms, and a lot of views to take in along the way.\n\nAnd our campsite was divine (just take a look at all that light around it) by the shelter of another favorite sprawling juniper, the perfect backdrop for our hammock, and the amazing, strong nurturing cradle of the rainbow-hued red metamorphic rock slab we love to lay upon in warm embrace.\n\nI chose this journey because we’ve talked about summitting Mt. Tallac, which I have never done. Dave did it over thirty years ago. I thought no time like now to do it. And since these trips have really integrated my inner mountain goat, I’m always up for a challenge and strengthening my resiliency and endurance. I also thought it might be cool to summit while we are in the energy of the Lion’s Gate Portal.\n\nWith our camping at a lake on the inner Desolation Wilderness track near Tallac, it helped break up what could be a really long and extra challenging one day hike into a shorter day hike. It was still nearly eight miles round trip with a lot of ascents, big two foot high steps up at times, and rock (or gruss as they call it) trails.\n\nI’m so glad we chose this way (of the three ways up) to go, which is more the back way, as it was such a beautiful trail that passed another large lake and then meandered through tons\n\nof flower strewn meadows, trees to provide intermittent shade, a favorite enchanted tree with many faces (can you find wee little me next to it in the collage?), and expansive vistas of what we’d left behind.\n\nIf you couldn’t find faery me, here’s the photo on its own again.\n\nAfter a good, long, and refreshing night’s camping sleep I usually have a lot of invigorated energy, so this also aided the day feeling less strenuous and allowed me to really take in and enjoy all the beauty surrounding me of flowers and pollinators galore.\n\nA true faery land in late Summer’s light, as the grasshoppers serenaded us along the trail and kissed my skin with their leaps and wings of light filled splendor. They literally like to spring at my face, or sometimes at my chest or arms.\n\nThese August fields of golden grasses and last hoorah of blooming vitality were inspiring.\n\nAnd so have been the beautiful fields of cattail grasses filling the meadows like we’ve never had before near home, along with a gorgeous habitat ecosystem of lushness courtesy of our mountain beaver family.\n\nBut I digress…August feel goods got me distracted.\n\nUntil we neared the last part of the ascent, near the top, we didn’t see anyone on the trail that wound through forests, up the mountain and across vast mountain meadow slopes. There was a point where we were hiking up the terraced rock trail with the forest to our left when I started to hear a loud knock on a tree echo around us. It was just a single knock and it came every twenty or thirty seconds – sometimes a minute might pass – but it was consistent for five or ten minutes. Just a single, loud knock against a tree. I giggled telling Dave that it might be Big Foot, as it was obvious to be something large knocking – not a wood pecker. Plus, it was just one knock at a time. Then it came to me in a flash. What we were hearing was in fact a buck thrashing his antlers against a tree. They do this to practice for antler battle during mating season because it helps to strengthen their neck muscles. And mating season is upcoming in the October to early December period.\n\nThat was really cool to be experiencing the vibrational energies moving through the air and a wonderful reflection of vitality, resiliency, fine tuning higher awareness, and moving into a new period of growth and leadership. The instinctual nature of deer, guides in the way of trusting our internal messaging system and to look for new perceptions. They represent the divine and are messengers from the otherworld.\n\nThe knocking was indeed to get my/our attention, but since I was the one who noticed it, I especially tuned into where I was being called at this point in life.\n\nAs we continued up, the knocking disappeared.\n\nThis whole area is mostly all granite and red and other metamorphic rock slopes and ground so I had no thoughts of this being a crystal finding trip this time. But wouldn’t you know that surprises awaited – in good ol’ magick style.\n\nAlong the way I found literally the only three “random” quartz rocks along the trail, which included this sparkly raw quartz stone with what look like green dendrites in it.\n\nThen, when we got to the last area of Tallac’s summit, I was led to the only two large rocks I saw that had quartz veins in them.\n\nBefore we went to the highest point, I looked down in that area and there were two stones hidden between rocks near the large quartz veined one.\n\nThis one with a quartz vein and this little one with a tiny cluster of quartz forming on it that included a few small full terminated points and one with etched markings across the side.\n\nI thought that was pretty special and was grateful to be told these were the gifts for this gateway and my coming all this way to the top.\n\nAfter that I was surrounded by small little butterflies dancing around the dark, jagged rocks that reminded me of the back of a sleeping dragon. Then a beautiful swallowtail caught my eye and I was taken in by the contrast of her grace and temporary vitality fluttering along the top of this enduring ages-old rock mountain.\n\nWhen she landed on the edge of forever, I felt the brilliance of wholeness in all things here and now.\n\nI circled her in this expansive vista below.\n\nWe then proceeded to the very top and took in the full 360 degree panoramic views where you can see nine lakes from this high point of 9739 feet – the third tallest peak in the Lake Tahoe Basin.\n\nMt. Tallac is considered a challenging hike because of the amount of ascent and the rock trails, but here I was feeling not in the least winded and enjoying the views of my home all around me.\n\nWe savored this vantage point of expansiveness and potential before descending back to our cozy campsite on the lake and embraced the winds of change that flowed all around us at the top.\n\nFrom here I listened to the stories of the land that hung in the whispers of the in between.\n\nI do love all the varieties of rock in this area…and especially the red metamorphic rocks that surround the lake area we chose as our campsite, and enjoy looking for beauties that catch my heart. The rainbow ones of many colors are a favorite, but I also love the purple, pink, and blue ones.\n\nI found a small collection that spoke to me, including one that had swirls of metallic gold on it and nearly all of them have sparkles you can’t see in photos.\n\nI also loved this perfect sparkly pentagon and perfect star stones.\n\nI even found a pastel, perfect heart.\n\nAfter we settled back into camp after the long hike, to rest and nourish our bodies with some warm meals, I went down that evening by our beach area where we bathe and sit watching the sunset to clean up our utensils.\n\nI crouched down to begin and something caught my eye.\n\nIt looked like a small piece of glass likely softened over time by the water and elements that was maybe a reminder of past campers leaving broken things behind. I picked it up and was astounded.\n\nIt was a perfect tiny double terminated quartz point!\n\n“Are you kidding me?!” I thought, and also exclaimed out loud so Dave could hear. He was so surprised too.\n\nOther than the few quartz rock and small piece I found, this area just DOES NOT have any quartz fields in open sight or that I’ve ever seen in the times we’ve hiked it.\n\nAnd yet here I was, on the eve of 8/8/8 bending over at the lake and right in the water at the edge of the rock shore, the only perfect DT crystal is laid at my feet – washed up to water’s edge right there at the very moment I arrive.\n\nThere’s even a key left from a baby DT crystal that has broken off of it. Just wow!\n\nTo say the impossible is possible is an understatement here. This truly felt like the crystal had come through a doorway just for me at that very moment – like it sought me out. True divine alignment and magick at hand. No doubt about it! And as my last post stated, I do live to believe in as many “impossible things” as I can.\n\nWhy? Because it makes it possible.\n\nI couldn’t get over this, but loved it all the way.\n\nHere, I had resigned myself to it not being a crystal journey, and here the Elementals…the ALL…and my multi-dimensional self said, “Oh, but it CAN always be, as long as you believe that anything is possible. And we know, I DO believe.\n\nNeedless to say, we had another great time and we soaked it all in, as we packed up that last morning.\n\nAnd on our last day back to the car, the ptarmigan messenger made an appearance again.\n\nYou may recall that on the two last trips I found a ptarmigan tail feather as we headed out. This time it was ptarmigan in the flesh.\n\nI heard this little clucking noise to the left and felt there was some animal there. I turned and saw the ptarmigan on a tree log slowly walking across and eyeing us with soft little clucks.\n\nThat was a sweet parting gift on 8/8/8 along with this giant hemlock varnish shelf mushroom – or hemlock reishi, since it’s a member of the reishi family.\n\nI found it hidden behind a giant tree off trail – so perfect – so vibrant – as if nature took out a paintbrush right then and there.\n\nWas it because of my mushroom and butterfly hat I wore for this trip that I called these reflections up? Was it our mushroom jerky we always like to take along as snacks for our journeys?\n\nOr, was it simply being in the flow?\n\nI did in fact see more of this on my cell phone screen at prominent points on the adventure.\n\nThe entire trip was only 16.5 cumulative miles, but according to my tracker this clocked in at 44,837 steps, 4,387 feet of cumulative ascents, and 8,774 feet of cumulative ascents and descents. And while I had the least amount of pounds I carried on my back this time, yet still more than my pack on its own – 35 (the most has been 45) – it’s become easier and easier and I actually look forward to these trips for building up my body’s endurance that aids all of my other activities and amps up my immune system and resiliency. It also helps me to move energy.\n\nWhen we returned home I found my day lily, upper deck plants had suddenly bloomed forth three beautiful red lilies to greet me home, which was a nice surprise.\n\nWhile the rest of the garden is slowly edging into pre-Autumn hues of splendor with a new collective of black-eyed Susan beauties (including a small meadow of them in the back where we threw the wildflower seeds to regrow the area after fire prevention tree removal that one year), the little forest animals are still in high gear of milking every last drop of enjoyment they can squeeze out of lazy August days.\n\nI love watching them run about in playful mode. It makes me giggle. Even the birds have been chasing each other and singing away into the late Summer evenings.\n\nEqually so, I giggled on our integration beach day, the day after 8/8/8. We like to have a relaxing downtime day when we get home from backpacking, to help us both adjust back to being around people again and to allow our bodies their renewal process after gifting us their resiliency and strength.\n\nWhile I laid on my beach towel I suddenly opened my eyes to see a large garter snake swishing across the sand past where I laid. She went directly to a log in front of me, eyeing both me and the water ahead.\n\nWe connected like I did with little frog, who emerged from the same bushes this snake friend now came from.\n\nSnake went to the water and appeared to be cooling off and getting a drink. I caught it all in this video, which also catches us both startling each other.\n\nI have no fear of garter snakes and love snakes in general. Yet, I’m also quite respectful of any wild animal’s space and of the sacredness of their presence.\n\nAfter a dip in the water, the snake came back to the log and then proceeded quite quickly to swish her way directly at me on my blanket. There was no threat at all, and of course garter snakes pose no major harm since they are not poisonous and have tiny teeth. And while she seemed to want to come directly at me, I moved out of the way quickly so she’d not feel cornered.\n\nWe both startled each other by this and as I moved, she moved quickly the other direction and went back off into the bushes from where she came.\n\nDave said he thinks perhaps she didn’t see me. I know she did, as they are highly vibrationally in tune even if not “seeing” and perhaps like frog, wanted to literally come to and on me for a very deliberate message. The animals often see me as one of them and there’s this moment of this split second realization alongside that of “Oh, yeah, you’re also this other form” – oops!\n\nShe reflected alchemical transformation, protection, renewal, primal wisdom, and healing.\n\nFrog reflected good luck and fortune, amazing self discovery, and fresh, transformative, new starts.\n\nBear reflected courage, strength, protection as well, leadership, power, wildness, maternal love, and abundance.\n\nAnd yet they also each hold personal messaging beyond the medicine they embody.\n\nOr perhaps they are simply remarkable encounters with nature – however you choose to see it.\n\nThey are reminders to me to keep believing and keep opening in the wider ways I have been. The gaps between realities and timeliness are becoming seamless and all things are possible in the in between.\n\nAll three feel like a powerful triad mirror of amazing, big changes happening right now and this fresh new chapter of expansive personal transformation.\n\nThis day I also received the pieces I was waiting for to add to my spiral quartz garden. I love how it’s coming together with my favorite flower embodied in a metal sunflower garden of sentinels around the spiral.\n\nI also added a temporary tree stump seat center (I’m using this piece for something else, but wanted a stand-in until the actual piece arrives) and then was guided to add a mini sister spiral in the open space to the left of the larger one.\n\nFor this I used the beautiful rainbow hued, red metamorphic rocks along with a few pink and periwinkle hued sparkly stones I found another time (I’m not sure what they are, but they have quartz-like essence), with the heart stone followed by the sparkly pentagon stone with the star stone atop it at center.\n\nThis mini spiral is for the Fae and the wee ones that cross between worlds. I made a promise when we got this place that I would honor the land and create a sanctuary for them here. This only felt right to have these magickal stones intentionally placed from my heart to theirs.\n\nThere are just a few more touches I’m waiting to arrive. I’ll share as they come together. The process is fun though, and rather than wait until the finale I thought it important to enjoy each step along the way with you.\n\nThe creative journey has also been fun, as I’ve been in an artsy mode again recently behind the scenes. I’ll share more as the projects come together, but let’s just say that I’ve fallen in love with a way to immortalize my love for Nature in some special pieces I’m creating for myself and feel I may be guided to make some available for others soon too.\n\nIn the meantime, I’m enjoying the step-by-step coming together of the crystal grids in my space and SO loving the energy of the quartz I found on our backpacking trips.\n\nThe energy is SO PURE! And the light codes are amazing. Finding crystals on my own makes this experience so much more potent and meaningful and the fact that only I have touched them besides our Earth Mother herself, is extremely sacred.\n\nSome of these will be part of the pieces I’m creating and that I may offer too, as I feel the energy is so important to share with others – not just in photos to receive – but in person to have and to hold. Plus, I have so many that it feels right to spread the Cosmic and Earth love.\n\nSpeaking of crystals, there is just one very special crystal skull still available. It’s the rare and beautiful Rainbow Chalcedony in Quartz Magickal Child Palm Stone Skull with a large vibrant rainbow at the crown. I haven’t seen one like this with all the beautiful array of color swirls in it.\n\nI do have a fun story about it, though. While away, this beauty was in the garden with a couple of DT Lemurians to prepare them and receive energies between the New Moon and 8/8/8. Astrid has been around so much and in fact when we got back I found a feather and tuft of rabbit fur next to them and the DT’s were showing rainbows they never had, matching the vibrancy of the little Magickal Child. So this little one is quite potent in spreading those rainbow light codes.\n\nI’m always amazed to see which ones take their time to connect and which do so immediately. I can feel there is a connection made already, and it’s just unfolding. So this beauty awaits and is ready when you are with extra oomph from the Portal energies.\n\nCrystals & Crystal Skulls\n\nThe rainbow light energies feel prominent with the coming home of the rainbow hued red metamorphic stones, this rainbow chalcedony in quartz skull palm stone, the rainbows appearing on the DTs, the incredible rainbows on nearly all of the quartz crystals I’ve found recently out in the wild, and also finding rainbow light appearing on two of The Speakers just a couple of days ago – right after (IN FACT) I had completed what I have so far of the spiral meditation garden. The last piece was the faery spiral and then there were the rainbows appearing on these beauties.\n\nI have no idea where it was coming from.\n\nYou can see a big rainbow on the back of Solon’s head and one on the side of Alkebulan’s face in these photos. I love it!\n\nAlso, I didn’t mention this here, as I felt to offer these on my social media platforms first since I sensed some of their guardians were there, but I did make my portal art available during this potent doorway too. They felt ready to find their homes. Not only that, their energy felt to finally be now-ready overall, as many of the things I’ve created have been ahead of their time. That feeling was confirmed when two connected right away with their people.\n\nI’m speaking about the three pieces of the In Lak’ech series of Five that were uniquely housed in custom made metal frames – so these are one-of-a-kind, never to be repeated again. Air and Fire have been spoken for, but Earth is surprisingly still here.\n\nI say that because Ancient Egyptian energy has been strongly surfacing right now for many embracing the core pieces of their soul in totality and so I’m curious who it is waiting for too.\n\nEarth highlights Ancient Egypt, the frame detailing mirrors the pyramids and palm trees within the painting. Earth holds Egyptian key codes through the Great Pyramids including Venus, The Hathors, and SO many other key Egyptian figures – Osiris, Isis, Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Horus, Thoth, Sekhmet, Ptah, and more.\n\nIt’s an “experience” to meditate with and allow them to do the work on deep levels, helping to shift your DNA and patterns into freeing transmutation. It can be hung, or set up to lean again a wall or shelf, placed on a small decorative easel for an alter space, or however your imagination calls for.\n\nI made these available at intuitively guided specials to help get them home where they are meant to be and the work can unfold from there. This feels important.\n\nYou’ll find Earth available by scrolling down to the bottom of my Artwork page or you may contact me for payment plan options, which of course the crystal being is also available with.\n\nThank you for viewing and being part of the Earth collective’s shifts into higher awareness and harmonious being. It makes a difference. You make a difference being here right now too, as it’s not possible without you.\n\nAnd last, just a quick update that the Mentor Muse Program has two spots remaining. Regular Intuitive Guidance Sessions have shifted out of their hugely decreased rate for most of 2024 and are still available with a smaller intuitively guided discount, as I transition into different things.\n\nWe’ll be away visiting family on the East Coast for a little over a week, so I’ll not be able to ship until I get back or do any sessions until then as well. I’m sure this trip will hold some more rich things to integrate. I’ll keep you posted when I return and look forward to any update comments you may have to share, or reflections of synchronicity with things I’ve shared here.\n\nAnd until then, may you bask in the potent light of these long August days, as Summer nears closure.\n\nThere’s a full spectrum of experiences available to us on this Earth plane and yet much of the time we seem to be presented with only a couple of choices and come to accept these as the only choices.\n\nHow can that be if this Universe, alone, is made up of infinite possibilities, and we are but only one Universe within the Multiverses?\n\nHow can that be if we are multi-dimensional beings, as diverse as the colors of the rainbow, and our daily options of feeling responses and imagination are just as unlimited?\n\nAre we given ability to be creative only to dream, but never to be the dreams?\n\nThese are things to ponder when ever you feel locked in, cornered, or frustrated.\n\nThere are always options beyond meets the eye and to believe that there aren’t, just might be the illusion and not your true reality.\n\nI’m constantly in awe of the potentials available when I stretch myself to believe possible, what seems impossible.\n\nAnd every potential and every version of you in each moment, day, month, or year is a color frequency of vibrational essence that can shift or stay the same, merge and blend, but always emanate brilliantly by your choosing.\n\nYou may recall my post What Color Frequency of the Rainbow are You Ambassador of? that shares how we are each artists with the ability to mix colors on our palettes and blend layers of richness together to our desire in order to achieve the most enhanced version of art (life) we want to create and share as our unique portion of harmony within the collective symphony.\n\nIf this were limited, or set up to be chosen by others, you would not have an imagination to visualize and create from, feelings to express as the moment moves you, nor a will to choose and act upon.\n\nThink on that whenever someone’s own vibrational will comes on strong with thinking they have the answers for you.\n\nI’ve always had a sensitivity to how what I say might influence others, and while we are not responsible for the way others filter things and we are always in process of fine-tuning how we relate to another with greater integrity, best conscious awareness, and highest potential for mutual empowerment, there will always be just that – a constant refining, to fit the most embracive space we can be in each moment for the highest good. At least that’s my intention.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I prefer to be in the role of intuitive “guide” rather than psychic or reader, as for me even the best of intentions with this I feel can have energetic persuasion that affects choices and can be subliminally influential without meaning to be. I am conscious of the vibrational nuances that we can affect each other with through even telepathic means and suggestions. There’s no perfect answer or way except to live as the most aware version of ourselves in each moment and to tune into what is us and what is not us. The way to understand that is to understand your natural frequency so that you can easily detect when something foreign pops up that may affect your decisions.\n\nI like to assist others in getting to answers on their own because I believe that all answers are not out of reach like we believe they are and we simply need seeds as access points of curiosity and intention to hear them. Our consciousness has access to the outer, inner, and here-and-now realms, but simply needs to be engaged and made conscious.\n\nI try my best not to be in a role of persuasion, but I’m also aware that anything we share has a vibrational effect by virtue of its being. I value people’s boundaries and free will. This is underscored by my coming from a no-boundary Pisces who’s finally joyful to know myself within that vast abyss of Everythingness I can easily reside in always.\n\nThat native nature can be a double-edged sword if not understood, as it’s easy to know other as self and be blurry on self within relationship to other.\n\nI do love the Everythingness though, and when on my own, I bask in that rainbow light of the ALL.\n\nMy garden in full Summer bloom is a perfect reflection of my inner rainbow spectrum.\n\nIt demonstrates the unlimited creative potential of consciousness to choose to emanate as.\n\nAnd right now everything is vibrating loudly in the joy of pure potential and authentic essence – can you hear their songs?\n\nAnd speaking of songs, I heard the song of my newest crystal skull collective that has long been in the formation process. I thought that perhaps they were done, but recently they told me to spread everyone out on the floor and start anew. This felt reflective of recent fine-tuning I’ve been doing.\n\nIt was amazing, how once I did this and embraced a renewing start, they came together in lightning speed. The time was right.\n\nThis took place on Tuesday 7/23 and what happened was indeed like lightning in the best and incredulous of ways.\n\nIt didn’t take me long to grid the crystals and crystal skulls on my round table. As you may recall, The Speakers are all gridded with crystals on an elongated square – or rectangular table.\n\nThe newest table was all complete except for one spot, which was to be for a skull I was awaiting arrival of. And in fact, there were “lightning” aspects included in this grid that added to the “flash” of rapid opening that followed.\n\nThat skull came one day early – on this day – and arrived literally minutes after I completed the grid.\n\nI brought her downstairs and placed her in her spot.\n\nThis ignited an unfolding of events that signified to me that the grid was not only complete, but the portal was wide open, and it was on high energy activation for clear messaging.\n\nRight after I completed the grid I was messaged by someone asking about an item I had available on a clothing listing I have, which was referring to the color. They wanted to know if the color was what was known as Aster – and indeed it was. Right as I messaged the person confirmation of this I heard a loud crash behind me and shattering.\n\nBoth Aster and Astrid have meaning including that of “a star” or being “of the stars.”\n\nI looked behind me and one of my little, two foot faery trees, with ornaments in it that sits on a shelf, had completely toppled over to the ground and ornaments were everywhere. The most bizarre part of this is that it’s been sitting there for several years and never had any issue, nor was it off-balance in any way. And it decides at this moment of grid completion to just fall over.\n\nOn top of that, the way it fell was also seemingly impossible. There are small decorative items that sit in front of the tree at the edge of the shelf and none of them had fallen. Just the tree somehow miraculously jumped over them and fell on its own.\n\nI knew right away this was no random act, but that in fact the green light was on full blast for the new portal. I got chills immediately as I knew any veil had been lifted and cosmic communication was streaming through – especially from Queen Astrid whose spirit resides in this room where she transitioned to the stars.\n\nWhen I went to examine the tree and ornaments on the floor I noted that only two things had broken of the many. One was an ornament mushroom light and the other was an Alice in Wonderland black heart ornament. The “light” mushroom was completely shattered, but the Alice in Wonderland heart had only been broken at the top of one of the curves of the heart around the White Rabbit’s ears on one side. His ears were fully intact, but the area around the ears was opened on the black, which felt like the Rabbit Hole had opened, or the portal to the cosmic abyss or other worlds was inviting me in with no barrier. On the opposite side of the heart is Alice – now with a way through to the Other Side.\n\nTo add to that wonder, the saying on that side of the ornament where the White Rabbit stood and was the side laying upright on the ground, was “Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”\n\nAnd indeed, this would be one of those impossible things I believe in!\n\nTo add to the mystery, wonder, and merriment of magickal manifestations and miraculous activations, just minutes after I understood all of what had happened and had just gone to tell Dave about it, since he heard the crash and was wondering, the power went out.\n\nDave was already amazed, although said right away (before I told him what happened) that Astrid must have done it. I then went on to describe how impossible this was in other realities, but not in mine.\n\nThe power was out for five hours from 4:20 to 9:20 pm – 5 being my other cosmic message from the bunnies in the stars – and when we learned of the issue from the electric company at conclusion of the power outage the text just read, “system issue.” The power was down in the whole neighborhood, as we could hear a couple of neighbors’ generators kick in.\n\nI had just finished saying to Dave how I’d completed the grid and that with everything in my office right now our house could blast off in terms of crystal energy – which included all the quartz I’ve found and gathered, that awaited going out into the garden spiral, and all the rest of the crystals all over my floor in piles for me to organize.\n\nThe power went on just as we were headed to bed. We got in bed a bit earlier than usual, as we were going to be packing up and heading out the next morning for another backpacking adventure.\n\nWe still haven’t ventured out to other areas yet for this because we so love our spot at Star Lake. We call it our “Summer cabin” getaway, although it’s more like a tiny tent.\n\nWe’ll likely go some other places through the rest of Summer and early Autumn, but we’ve been truly feeling rejuvenated and invigorated by our sacred portal that sits awaiting us like a cosmic container for our souls. So, this was our now third camping trip here, along with our first one in Desolation Wilderness – a total of four and I think so far, one trip a week we’ve been doing since we made the decision to start having this experience as part of our lives.\n\nAnyway, we did leave that next morning for the next few days and I noted a lot of alignment and a lot of amped up energy following this portal activation with my crystal and crystal skull grid. (By the way, their name is coming forth and was channeling during our time away, but they will have one just as The Speakers did. We’ll see if they want to be announced or not.)\n\nI’ve also been working on two smaller grids and one other larger one, so in fact there will be five when all is said and done – of course! And unplanned, because I actually thought there’d only be three and one of those split into three itself.\n\nAnyway, back to alignment and amped up energy. I noted that when we parked our car at the trailhead to start, my cell clock said 11:11 am and I of course received the wink from Astrid and took a screenshot of my screensaver with the time to mark it.\n\nUnlike the last time that was hard-going after my cleaning days, and the other times that are just hard because these are tougher hikes especially carrying packs, this time was my strongest by far. This is not an easy hike up no matter which trailhead you take. And the one we do knocks off one mile, but with a 22-23 pound pack on your back, it’s quite the haul.\n\nThis time, Dave had me go ahead while he finished getting his gear on and he actually never caught up with me, although we could see each other around the turns and behind or in front from a distance.\n\nWhen we reached the top summit at 9660 feet, I looked at my cell clock again and it read 1:11 pm!\n\nAgain, no random thing there, but another wink from Astrid that all was in alignment. Both Dave and I were amazed at how fast I’d gotten up there, as I made it under 2 hours since by the time we got our packs on and ready, it was 11:19 am when I actually started hiking.\n\nAnd when we arrived at our campsite we noted that we had made it under 3 hours, which was well under 30 minutes or more of our usual timing it takes. And in fact, on our way out to return home, we concluded our hike to the car in just 3 hours and 10 minutes, which was another wow and still under our norm since usually coming back is harder going because my pack is so much heavier with added mountain spirit crystals. LOL!\n\nYou’ll remember the first time it was 45 pounds, the second time 38, and this last time 40. I was amazed by the ease and strength that enabled all of this.\n\nI knew something had shifted and there was increased power and strength being experienced, not to mention support coming in without obstruction.\n\nSo, yes, I did get led to a lot of amazing crystals again and was wowed by the continuation of incredible finds I’ve never discovered until these last two trips.\n\nIn fact, this amazing-find thing even happened closer to home, as just the day before our leaving, we did a bike ride through the forest and right when I got out of the car to start our ride, my eye spotted a crystal on the side of the slope next to it. I went over and to my delight, it was a crystal point with 3 terminated faces and a self healed back. That felt to me like some amazing things were upcoming for our backpacking and indeed that was truth!\n\nOur first evening’s walk before bed was enchanted feeling. There were different flowers in bloom this time.\n\nThis area felt particularly magickal with a lot of Fae presence and light.\n\nDuring our camping days up top, we each did different day activities before meeting back up together. While Dave did a day hike the opposite direction, I went on a self-guided crystal expedition to see what the Fae had in store.\n\nOn our way in the first day, I had actually found a large turkey vulture feather at one point where the quartz field I love starts. I got message this is where they wanted me to begin my explorations, so that is in fact where I went back to, to begin. This underscored my intuition, as before we had even started the hike I got this sense I would begin my explorations a bit further than usual and the feather was exactly where I imagined that would be.\n\nI covered probably only a quarter of a mile area in the total four-hour time I gave myself until lunch, climbing the slopes up and down, just being guided by senses and after about an hour of nothing yet unusual, I then found a hawk feather on the hill.\n\nNow, feathers in this area are not my norm to find. I’ve only found one great horned owl feather a couple of years ago and then the ptarmigan tail feather last time on our way out.\n\nThis time it was the giant turkey vulture, hawk, and on our way out, another ptarmigan tail feather – the ptarmigan seems to be my parting messenger with all her symbolism.\n\nThe turkey vulture was a marker and the hawk feather was a message – she said, “Keep trusting. Keep going. Keep your hawk eyes about you. You’re on the right track. This is the spot.”\n\nAnd she was right, as immediately after hawk, began the influx of amazing finds. I just had to stay the course and the vortex would ignite. Isn’t that how all things in life go with processes? Just when you want to give up, is usually right before things are about to pop. Stay the course and enjoy the journey. Then watch how things blossom.\n\nI found a perfect terminated point, many partially terminated points, a bunch of smoky quartz – medium to light this time, citrine, smoky citrine, quartz with smoky and citrine, smoky with pink to peach colored quartz, smoky with golden healer, golden healers, of course pure chunks of clear quartz, elestialated quartz, rosy pink quartz, gorgeous clear and shiny quartz with red (likely hematite), all portions of partially formed crystals, incredible formations and crystal growth, druzy portals, and even two amazing quartz points with thick white jackets!\n\nThere was also this incredible dragon head quartz, which doubles as a hawk as well.\n\nJust look at the energy around it, while I took these photos in my garden of it.\n\nI also forgot to mention that there was one “random” piece of obsidian I found. Dave felt it could be remnants from the indigenous of the area long ago from some of their tools.\n\nFor all my fellow crystal lovers, here are photos of some of the incredible pieces to enjoy the energy of and to give you an idea of the magick that’s been popping up from the Earth. These babies sure want to do the work, as I’ve never found stuff like this out in the wild just sitting out in the open, ready and waiting! And it’s happening all over, as new crystal finds and crystal skulls seem to be on fire and bursting from Gaia’s seams and flowing through carvers’ hands. It’s a collective celebration of energetic code activations.\n\nJust look at these potent beauties!\n\nAnd nearly all, again, have incredible rainbows popping and winking. I left so many behind, but only bring home who tells me needs to come.\n\nI’m in constant awe and, yes, I do believe in AT LEAST 6 impossible things every day!\n\nI gave my new crystal friends a bath in the lake upon returning to camp. That’s something I do every time. I take them down to our private beach and give them all a Star Lake baptism and activation. It’s like a purification sacred ritual. This feels to be both in part for them and the lake. And during this process there’s usually quite a few that I learn are not meant to come on – as I explore them in greater detail and energy – but were needed for me to bring back to the lake and throw them in. In this way, activating this alpine lake. Some true beauties went into the water’s depths and now will always remain a part of her crystalline waters to be part of the collective Earth grid.\n\nAlignment just keeps on going, as just yesterday I was on the trail I know to have a small smoky quartz pocket and indeed the deep smokies were on fire – literally. Having been sitting in the direct sun they were super hot to the touch and that made them even more alive and potent! Just look at these beauties. Everything is prepping for a lot of anchoring in gridding in the space here with big energy.\n\nAnd back to camping – on our first day after setup and lunch, we enjoyed a relaxing time laying in the hammock resting, dreaming, connecting, and reading. This is when I like to feel into and practice things during this “being” time because I’m not a napper. I just rest in high awareness.\n\nSo, I close my eyes, but never fall asleep…I’m just in complete surrender and tuning in mode.\n\nTwice I opened my eyes and each time something appeared right at that and only moment. The first time five red-headed merganser ducks floated by through the small opening in the bushes in front of me. There’s that 5 again – my messenger coming through 5 mergansers.\n\nI closed my eyes and then reopened them a few minutes later only to now have an osprey flying by just as I looked.\n\nContinued divine flow, underscored, and direct answers to things I pondered.\n\nOh, and to tag-team with the 5 mergansers, on our first day back home to have beach integration downtime, I watched as mom merganser and 4 babies came up to our area – yes 5 again!\n\nThat same day, I had a sweet and extraordinary thing happen with a tiny baby tree frog. I was on the towel and Dave in a chair under the umbrella when he called me over. This baby tree frog had somehow hopped out of our beach bag and as Dave always does, he calls me when he sees frogs (or any animal for that matter) to come and help them.\n\nHe knows they’ll come to me and so he asked me to move the frog because if she got back in the bag she’d probably get squished and die. So, I put my hand out and in she hopped.\n\nShe looked like she enjoyed that. I took her to the bushes and trees behind us and let her jump in.\n\nI then went back to lay on my towel. In minutes I felt something jump on the side of my head and I knew right away it was my little frog friend!\n\nI was so tickled by this sweetness overload!\n\nShe had hopped all the way back through the bushes, across the sand and right to me! We were both amazed. I told her she needed to stay in the bushes to stay safe. I wondered if she wanted to come home and for a moment we wondered if she’d actually come from home with us, traveling in the bag, as we have a lot of little frogs that like to live in our deck couch and things. So she either came here with us or was from here. I had to find out.\n\nSo I told her if she came from home and wanted to go back then she can come back to me, but if she was just saying hi, then she needed to stay safe in her bushes.\n\nI took her back to her safe haven bushes and she didn’t return.\n\nWe finished out the weekend with a visit from mom and dad, an evening symphony at the north end of the lake with friends, and a half day of kayaking down the river again with our matching yellow banana kayak gang.\n\nMy parents came up for lunch, a visit, and to see my garden – they love flowers too!\n\nAnd actually dad brought me up some of his amazing lilies, as you can see are perfect in my pretty purple crystal vase they also gave me a while back.\n\nI then added a bunch of my own yellow and orange lilies mixed in with my white stargazer lilies in my butterfly vase to bring in all the vibrant beauty for daily indoor pleasure too.\n\nSuch a happy and vibrant bunch of beauties, aren’t they?!\n\nHow can you not feel joy seeing nature laugh in such brilliant colors?\n\nWe enjoyed a lovely lunch on my decked out table of rabbit decor plates and accessories.\n\nAnd then took a walk through the faery garden and quartz spiral grid.\n\nAren’t mom and dad cute in the wild faery forest garden?\n\nAnd look at mom go! Weeeee!\n\nMom and I also had fun exploring all my new crystal finds. Her faery heart enjoyed seeing all the sparkly and potent beauties.\n\nOh, did I mention I finally had enough quartz to make my spiral? Well, I guess I just did. LOL!\n\nI got in some work before my parents came over and completed the first round of our quartz crystal spiral that we decided upon instead of a labyrinth – we do after all have our portable gold painted labyrinth we made.\n\nDave and I leveled out the area the weekend before last and I felt to start seeing if I had enough crystals to get something going from all of my hauls backpacking and from other hikes here over the years. Dave and I started to actually like the idea of a spiral more, ever since we saw the one up at Star Lake, and that also felt more doable without having to make many more trips hauling down friends from the mountain. Seeing the spiral up at Star Lake also felt like a nudge that this was the direction to go in, instead, and interestingly this last time we were there it appeared that someone had undone the spiral. So it feels to have been a message and then when gone, that ours would manifest here to grid things up there that had begun.\n\nThis all felt in the flow of alignment, once again, because when I decided to start working on this, this weekend I received a little, but mighty messenger with a big nudge. Right after I brought all of the quartz out on the deck to look over them and begin the process, I then stood in front of the area to mentally map things out. Right at that very moment a hummingbird appeared out of nowhere and flew directly in front of me at eye level, just a foot from my face. We looked at each other for about thirty seconds, sharing a long gaze wrapped in rapid wing flutters that seemed to anoint the space while also sending vibrational confirmation of the spirit realm of my ancient lineage and beyond. After sharing this gaze and recognition, the hummingbird zipped off over the fence and disappeared into the forest.\n\nHummingbird is part of the Inca Medicine Wheel that is a spiritual journey through the four directions with hummingbird representing the North. I actually created a personal interpretation of this through my painting A Walk Between Worlds – “Hatun Karpay of the Nagual” (the great initiation of the Nagual – form of very powerful shaman). The interpretation includes that of including the symbolism as reference to the World (#21) Card of the Major Arcana cards of the Tarot. Here’s a larger photo of the painting: A Walk Between Worlds and more info from another very old post.\n\nAll of this also confirmed using the ancient spiral as well. The design spirals around three times.\n\nIt sits to the right of the side yard when looking down from the living room, with my wild garden to the left of it. It will soon transform into its own sacred rock garden – step by step.\n\nWe love how it’s come along and I have ideas for the rest of the area to bring it all together with added enchantment and intention, while keeping it simple without need for any outside help or major cost.\n\nSince taking the first photos the day my parents arrived, I’ve since been guided to add my four large stones that have a layer of incredible deep and icy blue, peachy pink, golden, and clear quartz running through the matrix.\n\nThese were stones attuned by Astrid when she was physically here, and now anchor the four tree stump corners.\n\nHere are some close-ups of them.\n\nMostly they feel like blue quartz and some of the richer blue areas look like little gemstones – sapphires come to mind. Truly magickal! This “blue ray” energy that has been so prevalent and key feels perfect to have as those anchors.\n\nYou might also note that within the spiral design I also included five tree rounds that are anchored with large quartz stones atop them. These five represent the elements of fire, air, earth, water, and spirit and make up an elemental star if one were to draw lines through them on the ground.\n\nAlong with my magickal additions that are brewing as ideas to add to the area, I will also be adding another tree stump stool to the center to be able to sit on once you do your meditation walk in and before you do your meditation walk out – each direction has its own intention, symbolism, and way to work with it. I thought it would be fun to show it in process so far.\n\nSo, this sacred space is a work in progress to be completed before Winter – we’ll see! Or, it will continue to evolve, as the spiral of life does indeed that!\n\nIn the meantime, what did finally come together is Part 2 of the last release of crystals and crystal skulls. I finally had the time as the message became also clear, to get the new listings up for the remaining cocreators I have available. These were all originally part of the same group as the Part 1 release that all gratefully found homes, but they wanted to hold off. This worked well, as I’ve had little time recently. It’s just a small group right now, but all are absolute favorites of mine for different reasons, with perfect energies for the now I feel.\n\nSo, if you’ve held off, or feel still to add to or complete your own crystal groups and grids, you may find the one here in these four unique beauties. Details on each are at the page link below.\n\nThe Portal is Open!\n\nCrystals & Crystal Skulls\n\nAnd although the Leo New Moon isn’t until August 4th, I’m still calling this the New Moon Release because the gateway is revving up to that energy and this may be a way to ignite new beginnings in your own life.\n\nWe also have the soon-to-follow 8/8/8 Lion’s Gate (August 8, 2+0+2+4) which is always potent.\n\nAnd that also will conclude the Intuitive Guidance Session special discount I’ve been honoring for a good portion of 2024 so far to help others with this year’s energies.\n\nHowever, in honor of 8/8/8’s Manifestation Gate, I have decided to open just 3 spaces for the Mentor Muse program I once offered, which is more of an intensive under the guise of inspiration and joy as a mirror to get you going strong with any new intention. I have 5 session and 11 session programs this time (as consistency and practice is key) and they can be found at the same link above for the Intuitive Guidance Sessions.\n\nWhereas Intuitive Guidance Sessions will explore your personal empowerment in any or all areas, these sessions are specifically focused on one area and involve consistent, committed weekly focuses to help to shift into and start manifesting a specific goal in your life – hence the package options rather than one-off sessions. In essence, these are intensives and involve dedication to yourself and your practice in order to manifest what you desire.\n\nThese are for people who feel ready to put in the time and focus and ready to put themselves and their goals at the forefront. One’s level of achievement is a choice of commitment. These are weekly, as I feel that consistency is key and the touch-ins of support and inspirational guidance are necessary on a regular basis as well to keep momentum going and move through the ups and downs that can come up. The weekly sessions are also accompanied by any needed email support along the way to encourage and check-in.\n\nIf these are of interest, please CONTACT ME so we can discuss if this is a good fit for you.\n\nThese are found on the same page as the Intuitive Guidance Sessions – simply scroll down at the link provided here to find them.\n\nOh, and if you’re on Instagram, I’m sharing an end of July Giveaway for 3 of Mody Ra’s amazing pieces from ancient Egyptian stones. This month’s giveaway (there’s one each month) is a birthday celebration in honor of his son Ali. The giveaway ends at 11:59 pm PST on Friday, August 2nd and the winner will be announced on Saturday, August 3rd during a special live sale Mody and I will be doing together on Instagram at his page at 11 am PST where he’ll be offering a 20% discount on all pieces to add to that celebration. Mody loves his children – Ali and Maya – and likes to do big things for them.\n\nWe’ll be away on the East coast soon, visiting Dave’s family mid-August for a week, which will include being gone over the next Aquarius Full Moon of the 19th.\n\nThis is the only week I won’t be available to do sessions, but CAN handle email support. I also won’t be able to ship during that week, so if any of the crystals or crystal skulls call to you, please keep that in mind if you have a particular time period you’d like your new friend by. I can ship up until Monday the 12th and then again after the 23rd.\n\nI’d like to end with some beautiful nature landscapes, gifts, and animal encounters to let the essence of these spaces and experiences linger with you. I feel we can use a lot more of these kinds of broadcasts across the globe to help align each of us with the nature of our own vibrational frequencies.\n\nDays continue to be filled with rich nature gifts and wildlife encounters even when not out backpacking – all made possible by a pause and deep presence.\n\nI was tickled to find these Sweet Pea flowers on a hike and took some home to enjoy in a vase, as I knew that would warm Dave’s heart. When I surprised him with them and told him their name his heart melted.\n\nI am also grateful to now have found two eagle feathers and that we just last evening had a black bear visitation.\n\nDave caught the photo above, as the bear made his way between our house and our neighbor’s house. You can see him at the center by their camper. Apparently dogs were barking in the forest and chasing him. The bear was just trying to escape peacefully.\n\nOther recent wild friend connections have included a collective of frogs and large toads, a big garter snake, Canadian geese, and another bear (briefly seen across a lake on a day outing).\n\nI spend a lot of quiet time with the frogs. I find them so complex and full of personality and wisdom.\n\nSome are more timid and will jump or slip away into the water. Others have no fear at all and will let me softly approach, as they listen to me talk. The more I talk, the more the others reappear and soon everyone’s hanging out like a frog convention to listen to this odd creature who cares to hear what they have to say.\n\nThe large garter snake would not have been seen if I hadn’t been in complete presence, as she was very keen on not wanting to be seen by others. Yet, she allowed me into her space and I stayed with her for a good fifteen minutes. Anytime someone walked by, including a group of children, she would slither deeper in the bushes and hide.\n\nOnce she felt their vibrations leave, she’d then circle back around and peek out at me to make sure I was still there.\n\nIt was during this time I heard a group of kids with their Summer guide call out “bear” across the lake, giving me just a glimpse on the other side of the water where I was with Miss Sssssnake.\n\nThere are so many beautiful little encounters and experiences to be had no matter where we are.\n\nIt all just takes a desire to want to dance in the gift of each moment and look around at the bigger picture held within one tiny thread.\n\nOne of our favorite spots when not backpacking is hanging out under the giant elder Juniper you’ve seen me share about many times.\n\nIt’s a peaceful and beautiful spot where sometimes the Canadian geese will come visit us – this last time a family of mom and dad and seven adolescent geese in fact did come graze and lay with us.\n\nThe serenity and scene here is picturesque and surreal.\n\nAnd you feel one with all of life, including the little ones that will come to play.\n\nThis last visit the chipmunk you see here, came and sat on my bare foot nestled into the cool grass while I closed my eyes to dream.\n\nIt’s a place to surrender and allow Great Great Grandmother Juniper watch over you and remove any worries – replacing them with wisdom she’s come to know about life on Earth. All around her stand her Juniper lineage who someday will take over the storytelling when her presence is called back to the stars.\n\nShe is currently in process of being registered as a “Champion Juniper” and is thought to be over 1500 years old. More information is upcoming to be shared with the public after this process.\n\nFor now, they’ve finally created a protective fence around her trunk to help her to live another 700 or more years.\n\nWe have so much available to us to learn from the elders and wisdom keepers that surround our daily lives in less outspoken ways. If only as much time was spent tuning in to them, as is spent tuning in to everything else.\n\nThe more I drop into and harness the elements I embody, the more experiences become seamless and deeply engaging.\n\nMay we all experience the natural vitality coursing through our veins and streaming through as spirit in flesh.\n\nOver time I’ve become increasingly more conscious and attuned with the elements and now make it a daily practice to work in partnership with them and tap into the ability we all have to play in that field with empowerment.\n\nEach of the elements teach me so much and it’s my relationship to them within that helps me to make sense of their reflection without, as well as supports my apprenticeship into magician hood.\n\nAs Water I learn to continually purify my thoughts and beliefs, not fear the depths, remain fluid, flow with rather than against, and use my feelings and intuition to sense into that alignment and understand the true undercurrents at work.\n\nAs Air I understand the softness of embodiment I can carry on a breeze to touch others, the strength and reach of my transformational force when I step into my power, the way presence can be humble and invisible while still experienced and shared, and how to communicate or pick up messages by constantly shifting perspective, and never remaining stagnant or stuck.\n\nAs Fire I know the constant renewal of each moment that is available, my ability to rebirth through unlimited creative life force, the power inherent in life cycles as a unified transmutational experience, the boldness of my will to manifest through action-backed desires, and yes I will always rise from the ashes as the perpetual artist of unlimited and multi-dimensional expression.\n\nAs Earth I am the ever-anchored container to hold all moving parts with nourishment and stability, able to manifest all thoughts and desires into solid form, maintain balance and grounding, am the eternal mother holding all of life in an unconditionally loving gaze, luxuriate in my sensuality of embodiment, celebrate my basal nature, and harness my feminine power to ever-be fertilely birthing anew.\n\nAs Spirit I know my lightness, clarity, the vast expanse within, the beauty of all other elements that fill that space, know the limitlessness available, the power of my vibrational frequency, understand the bigger picture, enjoy embodiment as a gift for experiential delights, and celebrate connection between all things.\n\nWe can tap into the vibrational frequency of the Big Five, just as we can any aspect of consciousness being expressed, and permanently put a stop to victimhood. It really isn’t a hard thing to do. It simply takes action to support the desire to do it, and that equates to presence combined with redirection of focus on a consistent basis.\n\nMental alchemy is an invitation – not a given – and as long as we don’t consciously choose to engage it, then everyone and everything else will simply do so for us. There is always cause and effect in play, but we get to choose which of those we’d like to experience more of with responsible integrity.\n\nI don’t have to tell you that the nature realm is where I feel most at home on Earth, as my shares I think reflect that enough even if just through photos. We each have a different way to experience our joy – and this just happens to be mine, as well as happens to be my choice of both classroom and playground. The latter equating to being my joy reminder, as everything “nature” tickles my heart.\n\nThe way I live isn’t for everyone and nor did it happen by chance or without a lot of preparatory back story. I think it’s easy to forget that people have years of experiences behind them when we only see how they are experiencing things right now.\n\nWork turns into practice, turns into play and fun – a way of being with increased ease and grace.\n\nAnd summertime can definitely highlight what both lights you up, or shines a light upon what’s been tucked away out of sight.\n\nSummer is vitality at its finest to me, but the same kind of creative life force is available to us all year round. We simply have to invite it into our lives from the unlimited well within our hearts.\n\nWe carry the light of the Great Central Sun within our very being. And even in the darker hours and hidden corners, that light will guide our way.\n\nPay attention to what sparks your joy and use that as a reminder that you can reframe each experience from a different perspective by engaging that feeling it ignites.\n\nMaybe take a moment to feel into yourself and ask the parts within what lights them up.\n\nWhat are your joy reminders?\n\nYou can use these as hinge points to shifting any experience in the moment, by calling up that reminder and instantly being taken to the feeling vibration it pours through, and illuminates within, you. This can help you to change the current story playing over and over in your experience, and anchor you in a new frequency that immediately pulls you out of the quicksand with a lifeline.\n\nTry it. Make it a practice. Do it consistently. You’ll be amazed at the new empowerment you have at your fingertips in one easy sweep of a joy refocus.\n\nIt’s similar to a gratitude practice, yet it will transport you into the feeling and cellular memories of your joy triggers, right away, that can multiply with rapid grace as you tap into a real feeling and experience that becomes your now. There is no time distinction or separation between what you feel and think about, and what you are right here in the eternal now. Therefore, it really does help to have these joy reminders in your back pocket to call up when you notice yourself stuck.\n\nIt also helps if you make friends with and understand the power of the elements that reside within you and are you – the control board to outer experiences at your fingertips that can support your optimal alignment and strategic placement.\n\nFor me, this has become one of my key pieces to creating life alchemy, along with fine-tuning even the smallest of tweaks to my perception of bigger picture things that stretch expansion open wider.\n\nTwo weekends ago we had our first Tahoe Herbivores Meetup for this Summer, which was a fun gathering of nine of us for a hike, followed by lunch.\n\nBut what I loved most about this day was the wildlife reflections in what was quite an extraordinary display – perfectly mirroring collective key pieces calling from within to be seen, heard, and embraced.\n\nThese included a first-ever sighting for us, here, of river otters and a first sighting of baby osprey with mom.\n\nWe were crossing a bridge over the river – that alone has meaning – when my hawk eyes caught a brown mound slightly moving across the way. I knew immediately it was some kind of animal – thinking beaver at first – so I stopped and then told my friend walking just ahead of me that there was an animal over there. As I continued to watch I realized there were more than one – actually four – and they were all climbing over each other and very connected.\n\nThey then slid into the water and I said that they were either beavers or river otters, but once I saw them moving in the water I said they didn’t move like beavers…they were acting like otters. At this point, the rest of the group behind us had caught up and the group ahead had stopped and were looking at other things. I pointed them out and the whole group came in closer to watch and asked me what kind of animal I thought they were. I shared my two first initial thoughts, but added that they were moving like otters. At that point I caught glimpse of long whiskers on the larger one lit up by the sunlight and long thin tails slinking behind them as they moved in and out of the water and around each other. I was now certain of my intuition upon watching their behavior that they were in fact river otters and not beavers, despite our never seeing any here before.\n\nThis was a family of mom and three younger ones and they were just in pure play mode in and out of the water. And when out of the water they just climbed all over each other and were like one unit, without separation between them, just nuzzling and wrapping around one another. Love, joy, lightness, and playfulness emanated from this display that went on and on.\n\nIt was evident to me immediately that they were reflecting the power and value of the inner child and that the group was needing this reminder.\n\nAnd in fact, otters do embody and message joy and play being important. Finding joy even through the challenges, finding that balance in all situations, and having limitless curiosity are spoken through their energy. If you watch them move in and out of the water and playing and merging with each other it’s so fluid and like one moving part together – helping to navigate things seamlessly and light heartedly as a team. They represent community and togetherness with peace and kindness at the forefront of interactions. There’s also shape-shifting qualities, resiliency, adaptability, divine feminine mysteries and understanding of the subconscious, psychic and emotional realms that come through as well. They represent both water and earth elements embodied, wholeness, harmony, new beginnings, purification, and spiritual awakening.\n\nWhen I continued to research otter symbolism I found this to underscore my initial feeling.\n\nOtter shows up when people have lost sight of their inner child. They help remind us to embrace new things without clinging to the past, just like children live moment-to-moment.\n\nI found it interesting no one saw them as we passed, but my hawk eyes immediately did and of course like attracts like. I got the feeling I was meant to be a bridge (we were on a bridge afterall, too) for the river otters to share their message with the group, as I know this to be one of my roles in life as an interspecies ambassador.\n\nWhen I felt into everyone around me who later sat in awe watching – it was evident why the clan showed up as they did to support inner child encouragement and to send a message to stop being so serious about life. It was fun that a clan appeared for a clan, with the perfect energy that was calling from their hearts to be embraced. Everything is always messaging us from the wisdom within.\n\nWe proceeded on after watching the river otter family for quite a while, and about a half mile further we came upon the sound of a young bird of prey calling out. We looked up and a large osprey was circling overhead and a young osprey was calling out from a big nest at the top of a dead tree.\n\nOsprey to me is a master of depths and heights, as the only bird of prey that actually dives under the surface of water to capture their meals – speaks to balancing consciousness with unconsciousness and being that bridge that merges things together and brings things to awareness. Water, air, and earth elements are strongly their suit, but they do take bold actions which demonstrates fire, and are messengers between realms – so there’s spirit too.\n\nI loved seeing the young one with momma, interacting as she circled and circled and baby called out. There was the feeling of nurturing and nourishing the inner child, as well as not being afraid to ask for what you want. While protectiveness from mom and caring for the well being of new life coming into the world to flourish was part of that wholeness of experience. We have the ability to be that nurturer to the parts within – the child within – and cultivate an empowered life experience that understands the wisdom and beauty of dancing in the gifts of light and shadow.\n\nAs we sat watching I looked down at the ground and found a smaller osprey feather – more of a breast or head feather likely from the youngster.\n\nAfter we turned around to head back, we crossed the bridge again and stopped to watch as the river otter family STILL continued to play and love on each other. I took this video, while the group moved on and I stayed behind. You can see the otter family in the foreground with two Canadian geese preening themselves in the background.\n\nBoth sightings were powerful and purposeful, but also so beautiful in and of themselves.\n\nI’ve continued to see my wild baby bunny friend (now named Ursa – because she’s my little “bear” guardian) here at the Forest Portal too, along with Hyzenthlay nearly every day.\n\nThe female energy is strongly showing up.\n\nThe rabbit sightings appear in the morning and evening and see us off before we leave on adventures, while also welcoming us back home too.\n\nEven one of my dear friends just shared with me a new family of wild rabbits in her yard including momma and FIVE baby bunnies that are precious beyond preciousness. All of this just pointed to so much of what I’ve already been sharing in this post. And I loved that bunny portal activation going on across the states too. Weeeeeeee!\n\nAnd speaking of adventures, we just got back on Thursday from another backpacking and camping three-day amazing journey. We felt guided to return to our same spot as last time because it’s so nourishing to us on every level.\n\nAfter the initial hike up, it’s a purely relaxing, fun, disconnected but fully in tune with the ALL time.\n\nRight before we headed to our lake destination, this giant, extraterrestrial looking insect welcomed us back. He was sitting on our car window as we got our backpacks on and I moved him to a tree stump where he sat before flying off into the forest.\n\nAnd on my way out on our day home I found my first ptarmigan tail feather, which was a special gift that encouraged my fortitude hiking out with a heavy pack again.\n\nThis alpine bird embodies resiliency, strength, determination, courage, power, protection, and hope – all perfect messages while I forged my way up the first climb out to the highest summit point. They are also known as thunder birds, messengers of the gods, and connection to higher spiritual forces. Recently, when I find a significant feather, I can actually feel how it has been placed there precisely as a manifestation for communicating to me something timely – not just as a theme for a general time period, but specific to the exact thing I’m thinking about, opening up to, concluding, realizing, or doing.\n\nSo, yeah, those “firsts” in terms of finds and experiences have been ongoing recently and I also had the most incredible firsts in terms of crystal finds on this trip.\n\nYes, I did go on my quartz expeditions again – in fact I went twice in one day while Dave napped and read in the hammock at our campsite. He also did a twenty minute hike way up the mountain overlooking our lake home-away-from-home to explore what we thought might be the mother quartz we could see from our campsite.\n\nHe did confirm the white area was in fact all quartz. I may explore the area next time, but for now it was his journey and he laid on this big mother to receive activation himself, while taking this shot of the view of the lake, our camping area, and Lake Tahoe far in the left distance.\n\nWhile he did that, I hiked out before and after lunch to the spot I’ve discovered about a mile out and spent two to two and a half hours each trip in full-on faery mode, being led by intuition and senses to amazing finds up the slopes of the mountain.\n\nI was guided to wear my seven-pointed faery star necklace with moldavite on this trip and I used it to tune in, by holding it and having intention to be led. I would even state out loud, “Okay Fae, Elementals, and Cosmic friends, lead on. I’m listening!” And boy did they answer.\n\nEach trip I’ve increasingly found more and more incredible pieces, but this trip was icing on the cake.\n\nI usually find quartz rock with some clear crystal forming on them. This trip and last trip these increased with much more crystal formations on the rock and moved into tons of pure crystal chunks of all sizes and then…actual, full formed or forming crystals appeared.\n\nLast time I started finding chunks that had keys, starbrary, information lines down the sides, and other interesting markings even though they weren’t fully formed crystals.\n\nThis time I found full-on shaped points, partial points, cluster points, earth-damaged (but self-healed) points without the tops or some sides gone or not fully formed yet, AND several tabby quartz, along with golden healers, smoky citrine, pinkish and blueish quartz, a few incredible pure smoky quartz – two of which are big and pure crystal and just WOW.\n\nThe photos share some looks at what I’m talking about, however don’t do them justice.\n\nAND EVERY SINGLE ONE of the pieces I found had remarkable rainbows in them that were twinkling to say, “Here I am!” The rainbows were brilliant and large and didn’t even need shifting them various ways to bring them out.\n\nI knew I was being led by the Fae energies, as it was extraordinary. I was astonished at what I was finding and didn’t even know these were possible here. But then, anything is, especially when you believe.\n\nI had this feeling before our trip that something was awaiting me to receive and I held this idea around finding full crystals and then it happened on 7/17 – this day felt like full-on M-A-G-I-C-K.\n\nI was careful about choosing what to bring back from the pieces the mountain spirits gifted, so as not to be too heavy of a pack to hike out with. I ended up with 38 pounds I hiked out the six and a half miles with instead of 45 pounds last time. And that was aided by my burying five larger pieces to await my return. And oh can I not wait to return because now I know what is possible and you better believe I’ll be off on more crystal adventures for sure to see what extraordinary things I can manifest next!\n\nI actually pooped myself out over a period of four consecutive days, so the restful time after my magickal expeditions, on long camping later afternoons and nights, was perfect.\n\nNote to self: Not the greatest idea to go on backpacking and crystal expedition trips immediately following two days of deep cleaning your entire house. LOL! I surely worked my butt off then, the day up to our camping site at over 9000 elevation, during my two expeditions of hiking, searching, and transporting to campsite, and our hike back down. But it’s also super exhilarating and amazing to see the endurance and strength one does have when met with mental alchemy to fuel the way. That, plus a lot of amped up crystal activations, protection, and recharging!\n\nThe evening we returned home we decided to go to our first free Music on the Beach event to slowly integrate back into mountain city vibes.\n\nIt was a peaceful evening with the usual mellow crowd, and a couple we know met up with us to watch the sunset and listen to smooth vibes.\n\nI did actually find a dead baby mouse on the deck where the dead baby bunny was that one time, when we returned home. Her insides were gone, but the full fur body and tail remained. I held a little ceremony and buried her in the garden, feeling like a resurrection of inner child power was emerging within me. Rather than seeing this as an end, I immediately dropped into it definitely being a new beginning of magickal potentials.\n\nWhile away, both my indoor and outdoor gardens flourished.\n\nI took these photos yesterday on a cloudy, thunderstorm day, but as you can see everything beams happy still and of course is another addition to my own joy reminders.\n\nThe next wave of my giant lilies are now all starting to bloom in orange, yellow, and star lily white.\n\nI’m amazed by how tall the garden plant babies are – the lilies tower over my head – and I’m loving the tropical and exotic feel to my indoor plants, including calla lilies in all shades of pinks, lilacs, and mauves.\n\nLife is a beautiful expression of color our hearts splash, swish, and stroke across the canvas of creation.\n\nWe had some beautiful views to relish in with the Moon over my heart – our Star Lake campsite and high-vibed quartz mountain playground that is – with golden sunset casts across the water and trees and even a “Great Pyramid” looking peak, peaking out – which isn’t surprising to me. All my favorites packed into one tiny corner of this vast Earth realm.\n\nThis was just a few days before the full illumination of this second Capricorn Full Moon in a row and it felt perfect to be high up in alpine regions like a mountain goat where my horns can receive from the Cosmos, my hooves can navigate the root of being, and my senses can be guided by the elements – as within so without.\n\nToday we have opportunity to harness the most productive qualities Capricorn teaches us, and that to me includes leading by your own inner compass and maturing into the responsible authority of your energetic field so that outside things are directed by your inward focus. You can master your reality and by example, lead the way for others to do the same.\n\nTry not to let world stories direct your emotions and life, nor get caught up in illusions. Be discerning with your time and focus and see if you find yourself taking sides.\n\nAny side is not unity. Unity is wholeness of perspective and the way out of sides is to create something more ALL-encompassing. You may think that is impossible or will take forever. That is only the truth as long as you believe it and as long as you relinquish your power to create it.\n\nWishing you a strengthening Full Moon and a happy 56th anniversary to my parents today as well! May love endure across this beautiful Earth and beyond.\n\nStay tuned for a small, concluding Part II of the previous crystal skull release coming up next to include the last few beings I didn’t have time to list with the Part I group that wanted out when they did. They always know when to align themselves energetically to be seen.\n\nAnd please remember that the special discount on Intuitive Guidance Sessions ends on 8/8. A great time to register for the session package that fits your upcoming needs and use the sessions when you’d like.\n\nSummer vibes continue in full swing and to me that looks like cherries, watermelon, sunflowers, lazy beach days, picnics, home-brewed iced tea and coffee, a garden in full bloom, camping,\n\noutdoor live music, biking, hiking, kayaking, meadows of croaking frogs and buzzing pollinators, thriving forest life, evening star gazing, and expansive creative visualization.\n\nAnd after saying all that, I still feel at a loss for words these days, which of course seems odd and humorous for someone so expressive.\n\nYet, I don’t feel my expression is lost in any way – it’s merely enhancing and deepening into even more of its natural essence.\n\nThat may also not seem to be the case, as when I DO share I have a decent amount to say.\n\nBut my shares are infrequent and I’m finding my desire to condense and use other ways to express things, or use descriptions that can convey more, to be a preference.\n\nI’m relishing in other forms of communication and leaning into more of the breadth of vibrational resonance we have access to experience and share.\n\nAnd since we only see snippets of each other’s lives through platforms like this – the words I share here don’t speak to the rest of my time each day, which is balanced with a different layer of experience.\n\nThe extra quiet times in nature and overall shifts I continually align with are assisting a really sumptuous space of being.\n\nThis may or may not be the experience of others, but I share it in case it speaks to something stirring or emerging within you – something we may be sharing, amongst many other possible realities.\n\nWe are strings from a shared instrument and yet creating music is an innovative force in motion of individual and shared plucks to those tonal strings in a rhythmic sequence of alchemical genius.\n\nPresence, peace, and neutrality cultivate the field of pure potential where true choices and answers can bloom.\n\nIn the loud, silent spaces I learn even more how to duplicate the way of the elements all around me and the wisdom of trees in a forest of diversity.\n\nHow often do we stop and listen to the vibrations emanating from everything around us? Not simply the words and individually-interpreted meanings, but the actual resonance and reverberations that feed us the ingredients we can consciously respond to and cocreate with?\n\nThis is the in between space I linger in and stretch myself to understand new ways to implement, integrate, and optimize for living in what feels, for me, to be as expansive and unified a potential as I can go in each moment.\n\nThat’s not everyone’s way, path, or choosing, but it’s mine – the way of reality-creation through shifts of awareness.\n\nAmidst all of the new mental alchemy I’m brewing up, we’ve been externally engaged in continued, full Summer days of activities, immersions, and connection.\n\nFrom a long weekend along the Northern Californian coast with friends – finding our own\n\npiece of peace amidst city vibes and indulging in a cornucopia of vegan culinary feasts, to a\n\nholiday weekend of celebrations with friends and community (including a vegan potluck that Dave and I made BBQ tofu with coleslaw and pickles sliders we cut in fours, and kayaking down the river), all linked by another\n\nincredibly nourishing backpacking adventure – we continue to create our new life experiences post fur babies journeying to the stars.\n\nOur backpacking trip was especially memorable, as well as impactful. This time we chose a favorite destination – bearing an equally favorite name – Star Lake.\n\nThis was our fourth time at the lake, but first time camping at it, which we did for two nights.\n\nWe desired to create a peaceful and relaxing space during the holiday rush, away from everything, but immersed in the ALL.\n\nIt was absolutely divine in every way, camping out on a quartz mountain, with raw quartz surrounding the lake and our campground, hiking through and exploring quartz fields just outside of the lake, and journeying across trails with incredible, expansive, blossom and giant juniper filled vistas along every step.\n\nIt’s hard to explain the immensity and awe of the quartz fields, and photos don’t do justice – so I didn’t bother to take any. It’s truly an in-person experience and boy did we feel the energy sleeping here for two nights.\n\nI definitely feel like we received an activation and upgrade.\n\nThis time we had our new hammock, which was icing on the cake.\n\nWe spent long hours just being.\n\nAnd even discovered right next to our campsite was a meditation spiral that someone had created with rocks and quartz.\n\nI thought that was a beautiful nudge, as before I made the sacred circle in our yard, I actually had it in a spiral. But I didn’t have enough to make it a full spiral – it was just a partial one, so I opted for a circle. Perhaps this was reflective of my intention still manifesting for us where we would end up camping, or reflects a spiral may yet still come to be, if not a full labyrinth, as I feel I may have enough stones soon for a spiral. We’ll see!\n\nIncluding a day hike and an extra rock hounding hike I did myself, plus the in and back miles, it totaled only between nineteen to twenty miles over the three days for me and seventeen for Dave.\n\nBut mostly there were hours of nothingness within the everythingness.\n\nBliss in every way and we were grateful to have created a full day, night and morning without another human around before a half dozen campsites popped up on our last night of the 4th of July.\n\nI returned with gifts from the mountain spirits (some of which you can see in front of the tent below, being highlighted by some incredible energy rays and solar emanations) that I carried out the six and a half miles – turning my 22.7 pound pack (of which we ate all the food I was carrying) into 45 pounds.\n\nWe were both astonished, but I was invigorated by the energy that fueled my endurance, and although the hike itself was quite a strenuous accomplishment, I miraculously didn’t end up having any soreness after.\n\nI chalked that up to the power and magick of the quartz.\n\nWe feel to do a backpacking and camping trip probably once a week through Summer and Autumn, as long as we’re around and not traveling.\n\nI’m not going to share all of the details, but rather am sharing the vibrational frequency through photo stories in sequence of how they’ve been written by the ALL with us more consciously engaging our parts in a beautiful co-story I’m learning more of the laws to harness.\n\nI can feel the vibrational resonance each time I create in this way and tap into the storyline fun I’m helping to make harmonious for the ALL’s experience.\n\nAs this is how I see it…we’ve always had invitation to enjoy and up our creative expression, as main characters within the One Mind.\n\nI’m in awe of what keeps showing up and how much our intentions continue to manifest at even more fine-tuned levels.\n\nIt’s incredible, but not surprising, to see what is possible for us all to experience with greater mindfulness and tuning into what is really available in this blip in space and time we call our lives.\n\nDuring all of this, what I’ve noticed is owl and hawk energy on all-time high in my world – with sightings, visitations, the most in number and most consistent influx of feather gifts from each, and even timed with their flying above or hooting from nearby.\n\nMessengers are chiming in and being guide posts, the more I focus on upleveling my awareness and implementing changes.\n\nInterestingly, the night before our backpacking trip on July 2nd, I had a powerful bear dream again.\n\nIt came on the heels of talking about Astrid and her transformational experience with a friend, which included starting off assertive, protective of herself and her boundaries, and charging with energetic force and grunts – very boldly at everyone. Then, how my unconditional love and “seeing” her allowed her to surrender into the softness beneath and shine her wisdom she kept hidden. She could turn on her “bear” when she wanted, but was at ease not to always be in that mode anymore. And in fact, one of the animals she looked like (minus her long, beautiful ears) was a young bear.\n\nAnd of course, she WAS connected with bears and Arcturian energy as they are reflective of, and sent me the golden bear to my door, as well as many dreams.\n\nBut this particular dream – which felt real, like I was awake on a different plane – involved two young bears that somehow got into the house. They seemed to be yearlings and I heard them get in and come down the hall toward our bedroom. Dave was asleep and didn’t notice, nor did he wake up through it all. I was awake and heard and felt everything. The two bears then proceeded to climb up onto the bed and were particularly interested in me. I could hear their bear grunts and sniffing, and felt their fur and large bodies maneuvering on the bed around me. One kind of nestled to my right sort of between Dave and I – I felt that one connecting with both of us, but there for Dave more. The other was climbing on top of me and I was trying my hardest not to move because while they weren’t hurting me, I had that human feeling of any moment they could do something since they are wild. They did not have any ferocious or attack energy, but were clearly very set on connecting – this one in particular with me who kept playing with my foot and leg, which was up in the air now because she or he was keen on sniffing, licking and tousling it. I eventually, and slowly lowered my leg and got it back under the covers. The bear persisted coming closer and was going at my face now to lick it and sniff it. I could feel the heavy breathing and power of this young bear, although there was playfulness and a sincere desire to connect and show affection. I eventually pulled fast at the covers to hide my face, but this bear kept trying to yank the covers off with paws and teeth. I felt that they were both talking to me telepathically at one point, but I can’t remember what they said.\n\nI don’t recall anymore except feeling they followed me when I eventually tried to get out of bed in the dark. It dawned on me when I awoke that Astrid was connected to sending them. Her strong assertive energy, with softness and love beneath, was reflected in these bears. I was reminded how she charged my face on the first day I took her home, but how I loved her more and saw into her heart.\n\nIt’s actually because of this dream that I was guided to wear this gold bear necklace with real leaves and flowers embedded inside that a sweet friend gave me. I feel it helped align a beautiful adventure and helped guide me to some incredible crystal finds – the likes of some I haven’t ever found before.\n\nAstrid is in constant communication and I’m so grateful for these vivid reality experiences that take place because of the strength of our love that makes everything possible. And more recently Boojum showed up in a brief half-state between dream and awake, in a very real experience for me to impart to Dave that he was with us too.\n\nThen on the morning of July 7th, my new little wild baby bunny friend appeared by our room, nibbling on fresh pine needles of our tree. It’s beautiful to know this sweetie is now going to grace our lives and this realm. I haven’t seen anyone else since this baby showed up. I still await a name, but feel it close. This appearance was a beautiful gift letting me know how love is all around me and the softness in my own heart is mirrored always.\n\nDays outdoors are filled with sweetness, as all the baby animals are out and about learning the ways of the great big world before them, with mom and dad guiding and protecting the journey.\n\nFrom bunnies, to ducklings, to goslings, to chicks (of all bird types), to hatchlings (lizard), to tadpoles, and more…we’ve been surrounded by new life in all the phases of childhood. New potentials are in motion for a New Earth experience.\n\nIt’s been fun to see some familiars too. In particular, the family of thirteen geese are still going strong and the goslings are now so large, but still hanging with their mom and dad and still have sweet fuzz on their lovely heads. They visit us on the beach each time we go.\n\nEverything is prolific and lush right now.\n\nIn fact, my garden is more like a jungle and is larger in growth than I’ve ever seen it, while its roots flourish and unite in nourishing ways with the forest and Earth.\n\nThe plants are reaching tall for the Sun, Moon and Stars and that feels like a beautiful reflection, as I stretch into adventurous new territories of thought, practice, and experience.\n\nMay we all retrieve pieces of our courage to forge small steps forward into new fields of potential.\n\nIt only takes one stretch to fuel creative power toward new realities. From there, it gets easier and easier.\n\nAnd if you are feeling challenged with things like this or making the changes you’d like to embody, I would be honored to walk with you through these life transitions. It’s a partnership that not only is between you and I, but between the parts within yourself. The journey involves having the hidden revealed, looking at the tough areas of your patterns and conditioned thoughts and feelings, opening to embracing, committing to, and actively working toward new perspectives, and wanting to break through those tough walls into the essence of who you really are. Consistent practice puts into place new conditioning of more authentic ways of being – relearning how to be more naturally you – therefore it’s not about receiving a reading without a process to get you there, but putting in the work so that you create the way and anchor how to make it your new norm and walk more in the vibrancy and vitality of your vibrational frequency.\n\nThe special discount continues through 8/8/2024 (8-8-8) if you feel resonance to this partnership. You may pick up as many sessions as you’d like until this date, and there’s no timeframe to use them by.\n\nIntuitive Guidance Sessions\n\nI may have some upcoming updates, but for now just the one magickal Unakite being remains (UPDATE: ALL ARE HOMED): Crystals & Crystal Skulls.\n\nThemes of unplugging and being off-grid seem to be on high right now for me, which is interesting given it’s Summer and that usually means an uptick in activities or gatherings. And while the latter is true, that is part of why I feel this to be extra important, at least for myself, to balance the energies.\n\nSo, there will continue to be more consistent away time upcoming – dips in and out – and it’s feeling supportive to resetting things, as well as exploring where and how I’d like to infuse energy into those things.\n\nThis may just be a “me” thing based on my energy signature for this year, yet I do feel how overall-supportive managing our energy and making time for ourselves and loved ones amidst the collective experience is.\n\nCreating our own reality is always available to us and learning how to navigate and master the energies and laws within this experience is something we can choose to partake in, in more consc"
