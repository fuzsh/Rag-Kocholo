        "text": "Sussex Waters by Tania Kovats is an exciting new installation that brings together water collected from rivers all over Sussex. Water is central to our lives, from its purest, life-giving power; to the impact it has on the landscape; to the way rivers and oceans create connections between places. It is through this liquid lens that Tania explores socio-political and environmental issues as well as our own, individual histories.\n\nThis online event will take place over Zoom and gives you the chance to hear directly from the artist herself, find out more about her work and to ask questions. You can see Sussex Waters in our current exhibition Sussex Landscape: Chalk, Wood and Water.\n\nWith Sussex Waters, I am following the river, the many rivers that flow through this place, finding their streams and tributaries, and tracing long lines of connection – geographic, cultural, ecological, psychological and personal. I capture a small cupful in the flow of time, distil it, literally make moving water and time still, held stopped in a vessel. Tania Kovats\n\nTickets cost £5 and you will receive access to a recorded version after the event that will be available until April 2023.\n\nBuy tickets to all three talks and get 20% off the total.
