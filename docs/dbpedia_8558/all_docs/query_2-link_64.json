        "text": "Michael Baird\n\nEducational History: Centre College, BA in Art History, 2019\n\nMichael Baird is a doctoral student in the department of Art and Art History at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He is interested in the Western reception of African material culture and how the discourse of fine art was utilized in the fashioning of national identity at the end of the colonial era. His current work centers on how art education formed an integral component of the British colonial apparatus in the East Africa Protectorate and how this colonial instruction in making continues to influence understandings of art within the contemporary nation-state of Uganda and perceptions of Ugandan art abroad. In 2019, Michael’s senior thesis contended with representations of black masculinity in the oeuvre of Robert Mapplethorpe and the social construction of categories within visual culture. Following his graduation, he worked as a curatorial intern and later curatorial and education assistant at the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C. The work he did at the museum was part of a larger initiative to re-evaluate the ways in which the museum characterizes, displays, and educates the public on African-inspired religions and objects that have acquired religious value.\n\nCallie Beattie\n\nEducational History: Virginia Commonwealth University, Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies with minors in Sociology and Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies, 2021; The School of Visual Arts, completed coursework towards a BFA, 2009 – 2012\n\nWebsite: https://www.linkedin.com/in/callie-beattie/\n\nCallie is a third-year dual degree master’s student in art history and library science with a concentration in archives.

Her work aims to elevate counter-narratives to provide greater context and broader access to our shared cultural heritage. In the summer of 2023 Callie worked at the Library of Congress as a Junior Fellow in the Rare Book and Special Collections Division. As a part of the Division’s larger “Artists and Archives” initiative, she processed the archive of a contemporary book artist, and letterpress printer.

I came to artists’ publications as a writer and poet interested in how different embodiments of a text affect its meaning, so I’m very interested in the intersection of text and visual art, and in a postcolonial view of the book as just one among many technologies of content transmission across cultures. I’m a career library worker involved in collecting artists’ publications and teaching with them. I also have a studio practice creating them under the press name Blue Bluer Books. My poems, translations, and flash fiction have appeared in some literary journals over the years and my artists’ books are held in a number of library, museum, and private collections.\n\nTaylor Hunkins\n\nTwitter: @HunkinsTaylor\n\nEducational History: Dickinson College, BA in Art History, 2017\n\nI am a PhD student studying Contemporary African Art, with a specific interest in the intersection of art, visual culture, and design within East Africa. Currently, I am thinking about visual culture in and around Nairobi, Kenya and how artists/art collectives employ the aesthetics of visual and material culture to construct their own understandings of local, national, and international identity. As a subsection of this inquiry, I am fascinated with populist or ‘pop’ art in Kenya, its aesthetic make-up, and political ramifications. Prior to coming to UNC, I received my BA in Art History from Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. During my time at Dickinson, I curated “Mafile Fen,” an exhibition of Bamana sculpture and textile that explored the relationship between performance and object in Bamana aesthetics. I have also held internships at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the National Museum of African Art in DC.\n\nAbigail Ilfeld\n\nEducational History: Trinity College Dublin, European Studies B.A.; Columbia University, Political Science B.A\n\nAbigail Ilfeld is a first year master’s student in UNC’s art history program. She graduated with two BAs in European Studies and Political Science from Trinity College Dublin and Columbia University, and received First Class Honors on her Capstone Project, “Alternative-Modernities: Confronting and Challenging the Eurocentric Implications in André Breton’s Encounter with Hector Hyppolite, Haiti 1945.” Before coming to UNC, she interned at the Franklin Furnace Archive in Brooklyn, NY, an organization dedicated to the support and public promotion of avant-garde art.\n\nHer research interests include American and Latin American contemporary art, political performance art, methods of institutional critique, and the tensions between aesthetics and communicability in work that claims political or public intent. She is currently working at the Ackland Art Museum as a public programming intern.\n\nOlivia Janson\n\nWebsite: https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivia-janson-b97646169/\n\nEducational History: The University of Alabama, B.A. in Art History with minors in Italian and Medieval and Early Modern European Studies, 2022\n\nOlivia Riva Janson is a master’s student in the Art and Art History department at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

Their research interests deal primarily with the intersections of art and radical politics in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. They are interested in the ways in which an artist’s work can serve–or undermine–their political goals. Their master’s thesis, entitled “The Darkroom as Weapon? Anti-Colonialism and Ethnography in Raoul Ubac’s Penthésilée Photomontages,” considered the complexities of the surrealist movement’s ideas about radical liberation and violence as a means to that end. Meg has presented their master’s thesis at the Middle Atlantic Symposium in the History of Art, co-hosted by the National Gallery of Art and the University of Maryland.\n\nRachel Mauney\n\nEducational History: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, MA in Art History, 2022; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, BA in Art History with Honors, 2020\n\nRachel is a first year PhD student in Art History. She works with Dr. Christoph Brachmann and is interested in the intersections of religious material culture and practices relating to death and commemoration in Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe. More specifically, Rachel is interested in the production of textiles, such as tapestries, funeral garments, and liturgical vestments, and the role materials play in the construction of memory or the performance of certain religious rituals. Before starting her PhD program, Rachel was the Assistant Gallery Director at Foltz Fine Art in Houston, TX. As a MA student at UNC, Rachel was a Graduate Teaching Fellow at the Ackland Art Museum and served as an assistant for the Hanes Visiting Artists Series. During this time, she also held an internship in Docent Education at the North Carolina Museum of Art.\n\nAisha Marie Muhammad\n\nTwitter: AishaMMPhD\n\nEducational History: SUNY New Paltz, Bachelor of Arts in Art History and History (Cum Laude), 2012; School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Master of Arts in Modern and Contemporary Art History, Theory and Criticism, 2015\n\nMy work focuses on depictions of ruin and decay in contemporary Congolese art, particularly surrounding physical infrastructure and national identity. Using Kishasa and Lubumbashi as my anchors, I explore how local artists interrogate local dilapidation as sites of resistance and reclamation. Poetics of ruin, memory studies and postcolonial theory are central to my work. My previous research focused on Nigerian performance artist Jelili Atiku, and his works as public interventions. Concurrent research addresses broader contemporary Congolese art, central African mining/Copperbelt and ruination studies. Scholarships and Fellowships: Mellon Foundation Humanities for the Public Good Fellowship, Foreign Language & Area Studies Fellowship (Kiswhahili), Object-Based Teaching Fellowship at the Ackland Art Museum, Off-Campus Research Fellowship\n\nDylan J Seal\n\nLinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/dylan-seal-3180571b7\n\nEducational History: University of Mississippi, BA in Art History (Minor in Religious Studies), 2023\n\nDylan is a second-year MA student in art history.

Williams\n\nEducational History: University of North Carolina at Wilmington, BA, Art History and English Literature, Certificate in Professional Writing, 2018\n\nUniversity of Georgia, MA with Distinction, Art History, 2020\n\nHannah Williams is a PhD candidate specializing in late medieval and early modern Northern European art with Dr. Tania String. Her dissertation, “Miraculous Microcosms: Affective Piety and the Significance of Scale in European Devotional Micro-Sculpture, c.1400-1550,” examines the devotional experience afforded by the very small scale of tiny haptic sculptures from Northern Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Her MA thesis dealt with similar issues of the devotional experience of art and earned her a distinction from the University of Georgia. Prior to beginning her PhD, she spent a year as a curatorial intern for the European art collection at the North Carolina Museum of Art, and since joining UNC, she has been on the planning committee of the 2022 graduate symposium titled “Matters of Art: Materiality, Functionality, and the Agency of Art Objects” and was elected as the co-president of the Art Student Graduate Organization. In 2024, she will present research at the College Art Association conference in Chicago and the International Medieval Congress in Leeds, UK."
