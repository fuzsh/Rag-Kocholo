        "text": "Predecessors\n\nPop art was a descendant of Dada, a nihilistic movement current in the 1920s that ridiculed the seriousness of contemporary Parisian art and, more broadly, the political and cultural situation that had brought war to Europe. Marcel Duchamp, the champion of Dada in the United States, who tried to narrow the distance between art and life by celebrating the mass-produced objects of his time, was the most influential figure in the evolution of Pop art. Other 20th-century artists who influenced Pop art were Stuart Davis, Gerard Murphy, and Fernand Léger, all of whom depicted in their painting the precision, mass production, and commercial materials of the machine-industrial age. The immediate predecessors of the Pop artists were Jasper Johns, Larry Rivers, and Robert Rauschenberg, American artists who in the 1950s painted flags, beer cans, and other, similar objects, though with a painterly, expressive technique.\n\nPop art in Britain\n\nIn many ways, the Pop art movement began as a form of academic inquiry. In 1952–55 a group of artists, architects, and design historians met regularly at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London to discuss disparate topics such as car styling or pulp magazines. The Independent Group, as they called themselves, were committed to developing a broad-based understanding of culture from its supposedly “high” forms to its popular ones. This philosophy informed the cerebral works of their main artist member, Richard Hamilton. Hence, in a work such as $he (1958–61), he combined allusions to fine art (recalling Duchamp) with esoteric references to American television advertising aimed at women. Another key member of the Independent Group was Edouardo Paolozzi, who had famously lectured to the group in 1952 about his collection of American science-fiction and other pulp imagery. Paolozzi also had strong sculptural interests, and his brutalist bronze-cast pieces had connections with the ravaged figuration of the likes of Jean Dubuffet. As Pop gathered momentum as a movement, Paolozzi combined his sculptural and popular-cultural interests in an iconography of robots.\n\nThe Independent Group constituted the first generation of British Pop. In the early 1960s a second generation emerged from the Royal College of Art in London, including Peter Blake, Pauline Boty, Richard Smith, and Joe Tilson. Blake—who was perhaps best known for helping design one of the iconic images of British Pop art, the cover for the Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)—often made collage-based paintings that included mass-produced objects, postcards, and magazine images. Boty, on the other hand, often considered the objectification of women in magazines through photo-based works. A younger generation of artists included David Hockney, Patrick Caulfield, and the American-born R.B. Kitaj. Hockney in particular acquired notoriety for rather fey and deliberately camp images of male nudes, which reflected his homosexuality. He eventually moved to Los Angeles, where he produced disconcertingly bland homages to California’s sun-drenched swimming-pool lifestyle."
