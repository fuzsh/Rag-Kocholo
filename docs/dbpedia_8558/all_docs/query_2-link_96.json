        "text": "Verna Fogg Bio\n\nThe unveiling of \"THE VAULT\" is a compilation of a body of works that represent culture, music, diversity, iconic figures, and everyday emotions.\n\nVerna Fogg is known for her unique blend of abstract and figurative elements in the Art & Fashion world. Born and raised in the diverse environment of Brooklyn, New York, she developed a passion for Art at\n\na young age.\n\nAs a young violinist who studied at the Brooklyn Music School and played at the astute Carnegie Hall her love of strings took a pivot when she first laid eyes on Pablo Picasso's 1912 collage \"Still Life with Chair Caning\" this experience propelled her love for Pop Art, where she began honing her skills through intensive art study and practice.\n\nFogg's passion for 3D Artwork and Mixed Media paintings is demonstrated by her symbolic use of oil on canvas. As Fogg quoted, \"When I first decided to start painting, I dedicated myself to using oil paint because of the way it glides against a canvas and the way I can blend the colors.\" Her meticulous application of found objects, such as the use of a basketball hoop painted in gold and accessorized with a crystal chandelier netting, depicts a conceptualized modern-day approach to \"MIXED MEDIA ART.\"\n\nVerna continues to explore the psychic of everyday sentiments\n\nthrough her contemporary art lens. Cest la Vie \"Such is Life\" represents the value of having one golden ticket-one admission through the evolution of LIFE. HER represents the inner strength of the women. The moon and the women share a common thread. Fogg has chosen to illustrate that through the natural rhythm of a twenty-eight-day cycle that connects to the process of life.\n\nVerna studied at New York City Technical College, became a full-time artist in 2015, and has been commissioned to paint various pieces."
