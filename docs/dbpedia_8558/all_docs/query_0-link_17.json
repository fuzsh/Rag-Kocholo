It examines works by Marcel Duchamp, Kurt Schwitters, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Tom Wesselmann, Ed Ruscha, and Claes Oldenburg. These artists appropriated everyday objects and imagery from popular culture to challenge definitions of art and comment on consumer culture and advertising. Their works incorporated techniques like assemblage, combining found objects, and transforming mass media images.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\nShare this information with your students: The concept of appropriation —borrowing images or objects to make art—began in the early 20 th century with Dada artists like Marcel Duchamp. Bicycle Wheel is Duchamp ’s first Readymade —class of objects that he invented to challenge assumptions about what constitutes a work of art . Here Duchamp chose two mass-produced parts—a bicycle wheel and a kitchen stool—and put them together in an assemblage, creating a sort of nonfunctional machine. By simply selecting prefabricated items and calling them art, he subverted established notions of the artist ’s craft and the viewer&apos;s aesthetic experience. The 1913 Bicycle Wheel was lost, but nearly four decades later Duchamp assembled a replacement from newly found prefabricated parts, indicating that the later version was as valid as the original Marcel Duchamp. Bicycle Wheel . New York, 1951 (third version, after lost original of 1913) Metal wheel mounted on painted wood stool, 51 x 25 x 16 1/2&quot; (129.5 x 63.5 x 41.9 cm).

Schwitters created the illusion of depth by placing those papers with darker components behind those that are lighter in aspect. The brightest piece of paper, in the center of the composition, shows an eye-catching cluster of red cherries and the printed German and French words for the fruit. In the winter of 1918–19 Schwitters had collected bits of newspaper, candy wrappers, and other debris, and began making the collages and assemblages for which he is best known today. The Cherry Picture belongs to a group of these works he called Merz, a nonsensical word that he made up by cutting a scrap from a newspaper: the second syllable of the German word Kommerz , or commerce. The picture contains a cork, bits of wood, a wooden pipe, burlap, a card with a drawing of cherries, and newspapers. Kurt Schwitters. Merz Picture 32 A. The Cherry Picture. 1921. Cut-and-pasted colored and printed paper, cloth, wood, metal, cork, oil, pencil, and ink on paperboard, 36 1/8 x 27 3/4&quot; (91.8 x 70.5 cm). Mr. and Mrs. A. Atwater Kent, Jr. Fund. © 2012 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York / VG Bild-Kunst, Bonn 27.1954\n\nShare this information with your students: Robert Rauschenberg ’s ‘Combines’ similarly integrated 3-dimensional found objects with 2-dimensional painting. Rebus belongs to a body of work Rauschenberg produced between 1954 and 1964, integrating three-dimensional objects with two-dimensional painting. Jasper Johns coined the term Combine for such works, which he described as painting playing the game of sculpture. Made from layers of everyday materials found in the neighborhood of his lower Manhattan studio (comic strips, political posters, fabric, and drawings), this work maintains a flatter, sparser surface than most Combines. Rauschenberg hoped viewers would look closely and consider the multiplicity of relationships between words and images, beauty and ugliness, and art and non-art. Robert Rauschenberg. Rebus. 1955 Oil, synthetic polymer paint, pencil, crayon, pastel, cut-and-pasted printed and painted papers, and fabric on canvas mounted and stapled to fabric, three panels, 8&apos; x 10&apos; 11 1/8&quot; (243.8 x 333.1 cm).

Bed is one of Robert Rauschenberg&apos;s first combines, the artist&apos;s term for his technique of attaching cast-off items, such as tires or old furniture, to a traditional support. In this case he framed a well–worn pillow, sheet, and quilt, scribbled on them with pencil, and splashed them with paint, in a style reminiscent of Abstract Expressionism. Legend has it that these bedclothes are Rauschenberg&apos;s own. The work is thus as personal as a self-portrait, or more so, a quality consistent with Rauschenberg ’s statement, &quot;Painting relates to both art and life.... (I try to act in that gap between the two.)” He claimed he &quot;wanted something other than what I could make myself and I wanted to use the surprise and the collectiveness and the generosity of finding surprises. And if it wasn&apos;t a surprise at first, by the time I got through with it, it was. So the object itself was changed by its context and therefore it became a new thing.” Robert Rauschenberg. Bed. 1955. Oil and pencil on pillow, quilt, and sheet on wood supports, 6&apos; 3 1/4&quot; x 31 1/2&quot; x 8&quot; (191.1 x 80 x 20.3 cm). Gift of Leo Castelli in honor of Alfred H. Barr, Jr. © 2012 Robert Rauschenberg 79.1989\n\nShare this information with your students: The 1960s brought a new generation of artists interested in exploring their world as the subject of art. Thus, Pop art was born. When Warhol first exhibited Campbell ’s Soup Cans , in 1962, each of the thirty-two canvases rested on a shelf mounted on the wall, like groceries in a store. The number of paintings corresponds to the varieties of soup then sold by the Campbell Soup Company. Warhol assigned a different soup variety to each, checking them off on a product list supplied by Campbell once their “portraits” were completed. Campbell&apos;s Soup Cans Andy Warhol (American, 1928–1987) 1962. Synthetic polymer paint on thirty-two canvases, Each canvas 20 x 16&quot; (50.8 x 40.6 cm).

Comics were Lichtenstein ’s interest. Lichtenstein found sources for many of his early paintings in comic books. The source for this work is &quot;Run for Love!&quot; published by DC Comics in 1962. In the original illustration, the drowning girl&apos;s boyfriend appears in the background, clinging to a capsized boat. Lichtenstein cropped the image dramatically, showing the girl alone, encircled by a threatening wave. He shortened the caption from &quot;I don&apos;t care if I have a cramp!&quot; to the ambiguous &quot;I don&apos;t care!” In addition to appropriating the melodramatic content of comics, Lichtenstein manually simulated the Benday dots used in the mechanical reproduction of images.

They sought to connect fine art traditions with pop culture elements from television, advertisements, films, and cartoons. At the same time, their work challenged traditional boundaries between media, combining painted gestures with photography and printmaking, handmade and readymade or mass-produced elements, and objects, images, and sometimes text to make new meanings.

In his series of still-lifes, Wesselmann appropriated images from magazines and collaged them directly onto the surface of his paintings, concentrating on the juxtaposition of objects, colors and textures. As well, he experimented with assemblage. Still Life #30 is a giant still-life composed of a table laden with food balanced by a pink icebox door, 7-Up bottles, and window. Wesselmann remarked, “This kind of relationship helps establish a momentum throughout the picture… At first glance my pictures seem well behaved, as if –that is a still life, O.K. But these things have such crazy give-and-take that I feel they get really very wild.” Interview with G. Swenson, ARTnews, 1964, p. 44 Tom Wesselmann. Still Life #30.

He began experimenting with the subject in his first artist&apos;s book, Twentysix Gasoline Stations (1963), which reproduces a series of banal photographs the artist took while driving on Route 66 between Los Angeles and his hometown of Oklahoma City. That year, converting an otherwise ordinary locale into a dramatic, even mysterious symbol of the American vernacular landscape, Ruscha created a monumental painting titled Standard Station, Amarillo, Texas , based on one of the photographs but with a radically foreshortened composition.

The object ’s size is greatly exaggerated, ad its scale is comically disproportionate to the room. Deflated and unable to stand on its own, it must be suspended from wires in the ceiling. Rendered in soft black vinyl, the body and blades sag and droop beneath their own weight. Claes Oldenburg made many giant objects, both humorous and disorienting in their scale. Giant Soft Fan is made of vinyl, wood, metal, and plastic. Like Oldenburg ’s other soft sculptures, Giant Soft Fan was carefully planned before it was hand sewn by his wife, Pat Oldenburg. Claes Oldenburg. Giant Soft Fan. 1966-67 Vinyl filled with foam rubber, wood, metal, and plastic tubing, Fan, approximately 10&apos; x 58 7/8&quot; x 61 7/8&quot; (305 x 149.5 x 157.1 cm), plus cord and plug 24&apos; 3 1/4&quot; (739.6 cm) long.
