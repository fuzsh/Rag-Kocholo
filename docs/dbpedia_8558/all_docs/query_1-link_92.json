        "text": "Performers without borders\n\nPERFORMERS WITHOUT FRONTIERS (PsF) is an artistic association of international solidarity. It brings together performers from diverse nationalities who carry out artistic, cultural and therapeutic projects with and for victims of shock traumas (armed conflicts, migrations, wars, natural disasters …) or developmental traumas (elderly people, the sick, hospitalized in psychiatric hospitals, orphans …). PsF also conducts research, trainings, and supports artistic and therapeutical activities, along with a diverse population. In action since 2015 in Brazil, the PsF are linked to a research project coordinated by the artist-researcher Tania Alice at the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO). So far, the group has carried out interventions in Nepal after the earthquakes, in Brussels after the terrorist attacks, in Brazil with elderly people and hospitalized in psychiatric hospitals, France in palliative care, Haïti et Togo, among others.\n\nOur website: www.performerssemfronteiras.com\n\nThe Performers Without Borders are born as a consequence of the work of the Performance Art Collective Daily Heroes, directed by Tania Alice and Gilson Motta, active from 2009 to 2014 in the streets of Rio de Janeiro, who would realize performances and ephemeral micro-utopias that potencialize affectivity in urban spaces, working with artivism, combination between art and activism.\n\nDressed as superheroes (or not!), the performers worked on elements and languages coming from theatre, visual arts, dance, sitting meditation and conscious movement, political activism and everyday life, bringing art and everyday life together and investigating rituals as practices of being together.\n\nThe performances valorize the relational element of art which views the transformation of the relationship between the performers and the participants as the focal point of the art work, establishing new relations between the urban spaces and the passers-by. Generating poetry within urban spaces that are everyday more private, the performances lead to an alternative way to perceive and experience daily social devices and connect people to themselves, to the others and to the nature/city, erasing the boundaries between art and “not-art”.\n\nConnected to Tania Alice’s research project at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO), the Collective has performed at various national and international artistic events such as the Mostra de Artes do SESC São Paulo [Internacional Art show], the Aix-en-Provence Contemporary Art Festival (France), the Creative Cities Forum, the SESC Palco Giratório, the International Simposium of the Brecht Society. In 2012, the Collective choosed to stage the play Why are you poor?, directed by Tania Alice, working totally without money: the play has been very successful showed in Rio de Janeiro, at the Cultural Center Oduvaldo Vianna Filho, during two months.\n\nThe videos of the performances of the Daily Heroes have been successful presented at the openings of Film and Video Festivals such as the Mostra Globale, Mostra Cinesul, The Washington Film Festival Tricycle or the Mostra do Filme Livre.\n\nThe Collective has won the Nacional Art on the Street Award 2010 A and the State Circulation Award of Rio de Janeiro in 2011.\n\nIn 2014, the members of the Collective decided to start working together to create the platform “Performers Without Borders”, idealized by Tania Alice who realizes performative projects in conflict, terrorist atttack or natural disaster zones outside Brazil (Nepal, Haiti, Belgium…) and works with people in specific situations in Brazil (elderly, patients from psychiatric hospitals, etc.)\n\nClick here to see the whole video clique aqui\n\nMidia\n\nTo know about other performances, click here\n\nTHE DANCE PROJECT – Campinas, Rio de Janeiro, Brussels, Dominican Republic, Fortaleza\n\nSeptember 26th, 2014\n\n(Português) Festival Internacional 100 em 1(05/2014) / Rodoviária de Campinas / SESC (09/2014), República Dominicana (2015), Tarasloft (Brussels), 2015, Festival ATOSEMACAO, Limeira, 2015, Festival de Teatro de Fortaleza 2016.\n\nPerformance Therapy\n\nFebruary 12th, 2014\n\nArmando Gonzaga Theatre, Marechal Hermes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 11/2013."
