        "text": "Late last month, after a short trip to Montreal to work with Mosaika Art & Design on my commission for a new public art project, I took the train to NYC for a couple of meetings and a little bit of gallery hopping. My time in New York was very compressed, and I only had 5 hours available on Saturday, September 28.\n\nWhen I have an abundance of time, I tend to immerse myself and see as much as possible—the good, the bad and the ugly. My Beloved refers to it as the “Art Death March.” However, with time so short, I prepared a very concise, detailed list that took me to the Upper East Side, the Lower East Side and Chelsea. Of course, I planned my subway trips and my Uber ride in advance, as well as the order of my stops and even my strategy for walking and crossing streets, as I didn’t want to waste a moment. Also, I set a very particular agenda for myself; I wanted to leave New York feeling inspired.\n\nHere’s a summary of what I saw. Many of these shows are still open as of the date of this post. See them if you can!\n\nAlma Thomas: Resurrection, Mnuchin Gallery, through October 19\n\nWhat a place to start! If this had been the only show I’d seen, I would’ve left New York feeling happy and fulfilled. This beautiful exhibition was curated by Sukanya Rajaratnam. It is comprehensive, with major works as well as a good selection of works on paper. Thomas’ energy and pure spirit shines through every piece. Of course, her story is astonishing. She did not paint full time until she was in her 60s, after teaching in Washington DC public schools for thirty-five years, but she more than made up for lost time. Her work is personal and historically resonant, connecting to Abstract Expressionism, Pointillism, Color Field and Minimalism.\n\nThomas was the first African-American woman to have a solo show at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and she enjoyed success late in life. Since her death in 1978 and, especially, in recent years, her contributions have been reassessed, and she’s finally getting her due.\n\nJohn Chamberlain: Baby Tycoons, Hauser & Wirth (69th St.), through October 19\n\nChamberlain is rather hit or miss for me. He lost me after his early, iconic works. At a certain point, his forms became less dynamic (more vertical, static and monolithic) and his color application seemed more arbitrary (more decorative). At the same time, the sculptures felt overly complicated, with narrower strips of metal that felt superfluous or overly fussed over. However, after seeing a few images of the Baby Tycoons, I thought the exhibition would be worth a visit. First, the title: it all but screams, “Baby Tycoons, here’s something you can afford! Cute little tabletop versions of my big sculptures!” Ah, but I sound cynical (which I am not). Anyway, these little guys pack a real punch. They morph from every angle, they hum with every aspect and shift of color, edge, angle, interior and exterior. They sit like little creatures on their pedestals, full of vim and vigor. As Chamberlain said,\n\nIf the scale is dealt with then the size has nothing to do with it.\n\nFriedel Dzubas: Affective Color, Yares Art, through November 2\n\nI’m a big fan of Yares Art’s Santa Fe outpost. In New York, the gallery occupies McKee Gallery’s as well as Mary Boone Gallery’s old spaces on Fifth Avenue. The gallery specializes in Color Field painting, so of course it was a necessary stop, even though I was unfamiliar with the artist featured in the current exhibition. I loved the Dzubas exhibition and left with a beautiful exhibition catalogue. Dzubas was championed by Greenberg, was acquainted with Pollock, de Kooning, Kline, et al., and was a member of The Club. He even shared a studio with Frankenthaler at one point. So, why haven’t I heard of him till now? I’m sure I’ve read about him, but for some reason, the name didn’t stick. In any case, I was glad to experience this exhibition, full of large-scale works with stacks and patches of acrylic color, each with a fuzzy, hazy edge that at once distinguished it and associated it with its neighbor. Turns out that that Dzubas was primarily influenced by Tiepolo’s frescoes. I found the use of color oddly idiosyncratic and full of juxtapositions of high color and rather muddy, earthy tones. My favorite piece was the epic Procession, from 1975. This work spans nearly 300 inches and is a true tour de force.\n\nDzubas made small studies for these works, which seem at odds with the grand presence of the paintings, which feel very spontaneous and in the moment. In fact, most of the large works in the exhibition were accompanied by their studies. I’m not sure if it helps or hurts the overall experience of viewing this show. Rather than studies, they almost feel like after-the-fact miniatures of these epic paintings.\n\nAmy Sherald: the heart of the matter, Hauser & Wirth (Chelsea), through October 26\n\nAmy Sherald’s exhibition was all but mobbed. She’s enjoying a moment, deservedly, after acing the Michelle Obama portrait commission. However, I feel something is missing in the discourse around her work. While issues of race and representation are at the forefront—as they are in the broader culture—they are not what make these paintings successful works of art. What makes these paintings successful is her subject matter combined, crucially, with they way they are painted. Sherald’s achievement is not merely her contribution to our contemporary discourse about race. It’s her contribution to painting, in terms of stylistic leanings and formal decision-making.\n\nIn preparation for this writing, I ran across a conversation between Sherald and Osman Can Yerebakan. They covered many topics, including tidbits about Sherald’s partner, her dog, her move from Baltimore to New Jersey, single-hood, romance, her Southern identity…in essence, just about everything but painting, which I found quite curious. However, there were two little factoids to savor: 1) Sherald studied with Odd Nerdrum in Norway, and 2) She buys clothes with which to style her models. The former is so, well, odd, that I don’t even know what to make of it. The latter really piqued my interest, because one of the things I admire so much about Sherald’s works is the way that she uses clothing to construct her compositions, and to signify other value systems that may not be so readily apparent. For example, when I look at the Obama portrait, in addition to Sherald’s stated references to Mondrian and Gee’s Bend quilters, I am reminded of Michelangelo’s Pieta and it’s pyramidal structure, so typical of Renaissance art.\n\nI’m eager to see how Sherald will continue to push the boundaries. This exhibition includes two very large works, one with four figures. However, this is the one that sticks with me. Sherald has a knack for posing her subjects’ limbs in a way that is rather uncanny and strange. It might be my imagination, but I’ve always thought that Michelle Obama’s left arm is rendered in a way that makes it appear bit long. If so, it’s a mannerist tweak that adds yet another layer of art historical references and compositional interest. Similarly, the subject in the portrait below has a strange left arm, with the hand not visibly in a pocket, but awkwardly held behind her back at a strange angle. This lends a bit of tension to the otherwise straightforward, frontal composition. I love this detail, as well as the patterned dress, which harks back to Pop Art (references to Wonder Bread, and/or the game Twister) and also to Op Art strategies.\n\nLuckily I had the forethought to pick up the heavy card for this show at H&W’s Uptown space. In the Chelsea gallery, viewers were frantically trying to grab keepsakes.\n\nSarah Sze, Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, through October 19\n\nOnce again, Sarah Sze creates an exhibition out of anything and everything at hand. The centerpiece of this show, a fragile, scaffold-like structure with scraps of paper and even containers of water serving as screens for tiny video projections, was very similar to an installation I saw in Munich a couple of years ago, In this case, though, Sze uses every inch of the gallery as a studio, laboratory and exhibition space, including the front of the building and various administrative spaces. A backroom serves as a studio space in chaotic disarray, as if the artist had just stepped out for a coffee. Upstairs, there are several paintings that function like accurate 2-D depictions of Sze’s layered, hyper-speed, ad hoc installations. They make sense in a way, and are fully in keeping with Sze’s oeuvre, but I was distracted by their fragile surfaces, with bits of collaged paper tacked on. Although the press release states that Sze was “originally trained as a painter,” let’s face it: that was a lifetime ago. Sze has consistently invested her energy elsewhere, and this exhibition made me think that she has overstretched a bit. To me, the installations incorporating light, video, sound, structure and detritus are still the most interesting and compelling works Sze has created thus far.\n\nPaul Klee: 1939, David Zwirner (Chelsea), though October 26\n\nThis exhibition is truly spectacular. The title says it all: 1939. According to the press release:\n\n“The exhibition focuses on Klee’s art from 1939, the year before he passed away, which marked one of the artist’s most prolific periods.\n\nToward the end of 1933, in response to the suppression of avant-garde art practices by the newly empowered Nazi party, Klee left Germany, where he had primarily lived since 1906, and returned to his native city of Bern, Switzerland, residing there for the remainder of his life. From 1935 until he passed away, in 1940, Klee continually struggled with illness, which at times impacted his ability to work. Yet, in 1939, against the backdrop of immense sociopolitical turmoil and the outbreak of war, Klee worked with a vigor and inventiveness that rivaled even the most productive periods from his youth. The works on view illustrate how Klee responded to his personal difficulties and the broader social realities of the time through imagery that is at turns political, solemn, playful, humorous, and poetic. Ranging in subject matter, the works all testify to Klee’s restless drive to experiment with his forms and materials, which include adhesive, grease, oil, chalk, and watercolor, among others, resulting in surfaces that are not only visually striking, but also highly tactile and original. The novelty and ingenuity of Klee’s late works informed the art of the generation of artists that emerged after World War II, and they continue to hold relevance and allure for artists and viewers alike today.”\n\nThe works on view, most very intimate in scale, are by turns delightful and ominous. I was obsessed with Klee when I was a teenager, but lost interest somewhere along the way. Well, I once again count myself among Klee worshippers."
