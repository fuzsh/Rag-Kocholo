The work of pop artists often elevates seemingly mundane or mass-produced items and imagery as a critique of the fine art world and its elitist tendencies. Though we all know Andy Warhol, there are so many others worth knowing more about.",

        "text": "Eduardo Paolozzi, Mosaics at Tottenham Court Road Station, 1986.\n\nScottish sculpture and artist Sir Eduardo Paolozzi is considered one of the earliest pop artists. A founding member of the Independent Group, who met regularly at London’s Institute of Contemporary Art, Paolozzi was influentially anti-Modernist. He was also deeply fascinated by Surrealism and though he always referred to his art as Surrealist, his pioneering use of found objects, punchy colors, and advertisement formats has led many to posthumously categorize him as a pop artist.\n\nAn image featured in the film Infinity: The Life and Art of Yayoi Kusama.\n\nYayoi Kusama is an iconic figure within the art world at large. In her nineties, her work continues to bring crowds to museums. Born in Japan, Kusama attended the Kyoto School of Arts and Crafts where she learned traditional painting techniques. In the 1950s, she moved to New York City and was immediately attracted to the avante-garde scene and the work of pop artists in particular. Though she initially drew attention in the 60s for art happenings that featured nude participants painted with polka dots, she now primarily creates installation pieces.\n\nDavid Hockney, Celia, Carennac, 1971.\n\nDavid Hockney was a key member of the British Pop Art movement. His drawn and painted portraits are particularly well-known though he made and continues to make art on a variety of subjects. Though he was offered a knighthood in 1990, he declined. In November of 2018, Hockney’s Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) became the most expensive work sold by a living artist when it went for $90 million at Christie’s. Several months later, Jeff Koons stole the title with a $91 million sale. Still making art, Hockney’s website boasts a digital gallery of paintings made on his iPhone and iPad.\n\nPauline Boty, Colour Her Gone, 1962.\n\nBritish painter Pauline Boty was a founding member of the Pop Art movement and was the only widely successful female artist on the British side of it. Young, beautiful, and an actress, Boty faced countless barriers to success and recognition as a serious artist. Still, her work was unashamedly sexual and feminine and made a huge impact on the British and global Pop Art scene.\n\nKeith Haring in his studio.\n\nKeith Haring's artwork evolved directly out of the NYC graffiti scene of the 1980s. His cartoony, lively illustrations were often subliminally sexual. They eventually became activist-oriented, often advocating for AIDS awareness and safe sex practices. Today, Keith Haring’s work remains a cornerstone of pop culture. His personal iconography is recognizable to many who don’t even know his name.\n\nHariton Pushwagner, Fake News, 2017\n\nBorn under the name Terje Brofos in 1940, Hariton Pushwager did not achieve international recognition until 2008, when some of his drawings were shown at the Berlin Biennale of Contemporary Art. He reportedly struggled for a long time to find his personal style and even quit drawing for a period following his 1959 graduation from the School of Art and Design of Oslo.\n\nAnna Claire Mauney is the former managing editor for Art & Object. A writer and artist living in North Carolina, she is interested in illustration, the 18th-century, and viceregal South America. She is also the co-host of An Obsessive Nature, a podcast about writing and pop culture."
