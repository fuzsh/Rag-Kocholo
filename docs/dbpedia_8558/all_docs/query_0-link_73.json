        "text": "\"What are the qualifications for my internship career and where can I get those qualifications?\" In my personal opinion, becoming a professional photographer doesn‚Äôt require anything substantial. That is not to say it isn‚Äôt hard work, because it definitely can be with scouting locations, saving up for the equipment, booking clients, meeting client needs. etc. I remember my photography teacher said that all that is required is a camera, and yourself. Although that pretty much does sum it up, there is a bit more that goes into it. When you‚Äôre getting started, a phone camera is quality enough, along with something to edit photos, but as you save money, it is much better to purchase a quality camera, invest in a nice photo editing software (like Lightroom for example), and some basic quality equipment like some lenses, maybe a tripod, a camera bag, batteries, SD cards, etc. Another important thing is to be creative and open-minded, but if you‚Äôre already interested in pursuing photography, then creativity is already most likely there. As you explore different kinds of projects, your creativity will expand, and you‚Äôll also find your main genre of photography. Lastly, you can choose to work under a business, or start your own business. Many people choose to go to school and pursue degrees in photography or business, which can help a lot, but it is not necessary. When you have gathered all your equipment, all you need to do is find clients, book them, take the photos, edit, and then return the photos. Of course the process is realistically more involved and contains more details, but that is essentially what photographers do. As you go on to book more clients, you‚Äôll build connections, leading you to more bookings. A great way to dive into the photography field is doing internships! According to LearnHowToBecome, ‚ÄúInternships provide students an opportunity to engage in photographic workshops and fieldwork to explore the technical, creative, and logistical aspects of photography both in a studio and on location.‚Äù #CTE #granitedistrictinterns #cnichophoto\n\nüí°Things you can use the new intern for: Send her into the attic space to make registrations of the structures and avoid getting yourself covered with insulation üëè We needed to know if the existing structure on site, matched the drawings from when the building was build. Therefore I went on site yesterday to do some registrations, and brought our new intern, Natalia ≈ölimak. Because what better way to avoid touching insulation than to bring the intern with you on site, and make her climp the ladder and look into the attic space üòÅ? Of course the main purpose of bringing Natalia on site was to show her something from the real world, away from the desktop and the keyboard. And really not to outsource my work to a willing intern üòâ Therefore both of us ended up taking a look at the structure and getting slightly covered with insulation, to find out that the drawings matched reality üí™ The post has been made in English, because Natalia is from Poland (currently studying at VIA University College in Horsens), and most of our communication is in English üåç FYI: We are better engineers, than photographers üì∑ #NIRAS - #NIRASOdense - #OnTourWithTheIntern\n\n‚ÄúTalent is a pursued interest. Anything that you're willing to practice, you can do.‚Äù ‚Äï Bob Ross A couple of years back my elder brother asked me \"How did you get so good at painting?\" And I was already in my 5th year of being a professional artist. And he was among the first to prompt me to become a professional artist. He knew that I was already decent enough to be an artist. I had a passion and potential. So, I knew he was asking how I leveled up. And my answer was simple - by painting more. If you have been following me for some time, then you know that I am a CA and do not hold any degree in arts (yet, never say never ) The degree gives you the required knowledge but only theoretical knowledge won't help you. By doing the work you will know your strengths and weaknesses. You can gather that information and create strategies for upskilling. That's the reason in many professions internships are an important part of learning. I have been continuously creating art since my childhood. Even during CA I never completely lost my connection with art. I mainly learned the art from my local art teacher and my reading books, and blogs. And, in my initial years as a professional artist, I experimented extensively with materials and techniques. It helped me understand what I don't want to do, this is one of the most underrated pieces of information. It also helped me to mark the areas I want to focus on. Then I learned those things from the masters of the craft. In this picture, I am trying to upskill. I recently attended an art camp, with 20+ artists for Plein Air Painting. To learn completely new skills from peers and masters of the craft. What are your thoughts about talent vs interest? How are you leveling up in your interests? Please share in the comments section, I would like to know. #shwetaektare #linkedincreator #painter #artist"
