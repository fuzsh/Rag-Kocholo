        "text": "About the Event\n\nEwako ôma askiy. This then is the earth. is a series of rehearsals open to the public with dance artists Ivanie Aubin-Malo and Ceinwen Gobert, led by artist and choreographer Tanya Lukin Linklater. Occurring intermittently throughout the day, with no explicit schedule, these sessions respond to the cyclical, seasonal, affective, and formal qualities of selected works in Duane Linklater: mymothersside. Through dance-making, Lukin Linklater’s project invites the public to view the unfolding processes of embodiment, gesture, and sensation.\n\nEwako ôma askiy. This then is the earth. is organized by Carla Acevedo-Yates, Marilyn and Larry Fields Curator, and Nolan Jimbo, Assistant Curator.\n\nAccess Information\n\nAudio description is available on Thursday, July 27, from 1 to 4 pm.\n\nAbout the Artists\n\nTanya Lukin Linklater lives and works in Nbisiing Anishinaabeg aki in Ontario. Her performances, works for camera, installations, and writings cite Indigenous dance and visual art lineages, our structures of sustenance, and weather. She uses embodied experiences such as dance, song, and oration to palpably shift the atmospheric conditions of museums into “felt structures”: forms of relation that are not usually supported by institutional spaces. Through collaboration, her work reckons with histories that affect Indigenous peoples’ lived experiences, (home)lands, and ideas. In summer 2024, her iterative solo exhibition, My mind is with the weather, will be presented at the Wexner Center for the Arts. Lukin Linklater is the recipient of the Wexner Center for the Arts Artist Residency Award and The Herb Alpert Award in the Arts. Slow Scrape, her first collection of poetry, was published by The Centre for Expanded Poetics and Anteism, Montreal (2020), with a second edition published by Talonbooks, Vancouver (2022). Her Sugpiaq homelands, Afognak and Port Lions, are in southwestern Alaska.\n\nWolastoq and Quebecois dancer, choreographer, and curator Ivanie Aubin-Malo invests herself in projects that reflect on ecology and human ethics regarding our environment. She also has danced Fancy Shawl—a powwow style—since 2015, connecting with the spirit of transformation and celebrating women’s audacity. Her artistic research as a creator hopes to shed light on the beauty of the Wolastoqey language and its relation to the land and the body. Aubin-Malo also contributes to connecting Indigenous movement-based artists in order to break isolation, cultivate inspiration, share knowledge, and facilitate collaboration. With this intention, she has contributed in the spark of recurring events in and around Montreal/Tio’tia:ke/Mooniyang. As a dancer, she has worked with Tanya Lukin Linklater, k.g Guttman, Andreane Leclerc, Corpuscule Danse, and Alexandre Morin, among others. She is currently cocreating with Natasha Kanapé-Fontaine a performance on wolastoqiyik and Innuat giants and oral stories. Recently based in L’Islet, Quebec, she plans to open a Wolastoqey Cultural Center.\n\nCeinwen Gobert was raised in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, and later graduated with distinction from the collaborative BA program at the University of Calgary and the School of Alberta Ballet. She is a Toronto-based multidisciplinary artist and has had the pleasure of interpreting works for a number of choreographers and companies, including Kaha:wi Dance Theatre, Van Grimde Corps Secrets, W&M Physical Theatre, Paul-Andre Fortier, Darryl Tracy, Brian Solomon, Signal Theatre, and Tanya Lukin Linklater. Ceinwen worked with Kaha:wi Dance Theatre from 2004 to 2016, was a company member with Van Grimde Corps Secrets from 2005 to 2009, and has been dancing for Tanya Lukin Linklater since 2013. In addition to her work as a dancer, Ceinwen is a visual artist (@ceigart) and co-owner of Summit Massage Studio."
