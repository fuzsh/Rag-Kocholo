        "text": "Leaving false evidence of one's own death\n\nThis article is about the legal term. For the natural biological behavior of apparent death or feigning death, see Apparent death.\n\nA faked death, also called a staged death, is the act of an individual purposely deceiving other people into believing that the individual is dead, when the person is, in fact, still alive. The faking of one's own death by suicide is sometimes referred to as pseuicide or pseudocide.[1] People who commit pseudocide can do so by leaving evidence, clues, or through other methods.[2][3][4] Death hoaxes can also be created and spread solely by third-parties for various purposes.\n\nCommitting pseudocide may be done for a variety of reasons, such as to fraudulently collect insurance money, to evade pursuit, to escape from captivity, to arouse false sympathy, or as a practical joke.\n\nWhile faking one's own death is not inherently illegal, it may be part of a fraudulent or illicit activity such as tax evasion, insurance fraud,[5]: 12 or avoiding a criminal prosecution.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nDeaths have been faked since ancient times, but the rate increased significantly in the middle of the 19th century, when life insurance, and therefore insurance fraud, became more common.[6][7] Life insurance payouts are often a goal for people faking their deaths, but most types of insurance fraud involve other subjects, such as thefts or fires, rather than faked deaths.[5]: 51–52\n\nIn the late 20th century, advancements in technology began to make it increasingly more difficult to simply disappear after faking a death. Such things as credit card purchases, social media, and mobile phone systems, among others, have made it harder to make a clean break with a past identity.[6] Widespread use of facial recognition tools can connect new identities to old social media accounts.[7] Other factors include a narcissistic desire of fakers to observe the reactions of others to their deaths, which may prompt them to check websites for information about their disappearances, which in turn could lead to their discovery through Internet geolocation.[5]: 30–31\n\nMotivation\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile some people fake their deaths as a prank or self-promotion effort, or to get a clean start, the most common motivations are money or a need to escape an abusive relationship.[1][8] Men are more likely to fake their deaths than women.[5]: 126–128, 213\n\nPeople who fake their deaths often feel like they are trapped in a desperate situation.[1] Because of this, an investigation may be triggered if the person disappears, no body is found, and the person is in significant financial difficulties.[6] Often, the desperate person has assessed the situation incorrectly. For example, John Darwin, known as \"Canoe Man\" in the UK, incorrectly believed that his financial difficulties could not be resolved through bankruptcy or by seeking legal assistance.[5]: 96–99\n\nDaydreaming or fantasizing about disappearing can be a form of avoiding problems that people do not want to address, such as their dissatisfaction with their current situations.[5]: 36–38 Faking a death in this situation goes beyond this common impulse to think about a different lifestyle and may be associated with manipulativeness, anti-social behaviour, or sociopathic tendencies.[5]: 36–38\n\nMethods\n\n[edit]\n\nPeople who fake their own deaths often do so by trying to pretend drowning, because it provides a plausible reason for the absence of a body. However, drowned bodies usually appear within a few days of a death, and when no body appears, a faked death is suspected.[6]\n\nMany people who fake their deaths intend for the change to be temporary, until a problem is resolved.[5]: 188 For example, John Darwin hoped that his wife could collect money from life insurance, pay some debts off, and then he could reappear later to pay the money back, perhaps with a fine and some jail time. He framed it as a sort of unconventional loan from the life insurance companies.[5]: 99–100\n\nOutcome\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough firm figures are impossible to identify, investigators can resolve nearly all of the cases they receive, and researchers believe that most people are caught.[6][7] Most people are caught quickly, within hours or days. For example, Marcus Schrenker faked a plane crash to avoid prosecution and was captured two days later, after he sent an e-mail message to a friend about his plans.[5]: 62\n\nFaking a death is not a victimless act.[9] The people who grieved what they believed was a real death are usually angry and sometimes see the offense as being unforgivable.[6] Accomplices, such as romantic partners and children, may be asked to commit crimes, such as filing false insurance claims or making false reports to the police, which can result in criminal charges.[5]: 188–189 Those who are unaware that the death is fake may feel emotionally abused or manipulated. Rather than being happy or relieved to discover that the faker is alive, they may be angry and refuse to have any further contact.[5]: 135–136\n\nOn social media\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Munchausen by internet\n\nFalse claims of death, including false claims of suicide, are not uncommon in social media accounts.[1][10] The people who do this are often trying to get an advantage for themselves, such as more attention or likes, and they lie about their deaths \"without thinking about the fact that there are people who would be upset, hurt or psychologically affected by the news of their death\".[10] It may be an intentional effort to manipulate other people's emotions or to see how people would react if they had died.[1] Online, people have claimed to be dead as a response to real or perceived mistreatment on social media, and posting news of their death, especially their suicide, is a way to punish the other users.[1]\n\nExamples of faked deaths on social media include BethAnn McLaughlin, a white woman who claimed to be Native American under another name on Twitter, and whose deception was uncovered after she faked her death during the COVID-19 pandemic.[11] Kaycee Nicole in 2001 represented not just a fake death on social media, but also a fake person; she was the fictional creation of a middle-aged woman, and one of the first internet hoaxes to pretend that a character was dying.[12][13]\n\nNotable faked deaths\n\n[edit]\n\n1st century\n\n[edit]\n\nYohanan ben Zakkai faked his death to escape from the Roman army.[5]: 27\n\n14th century\n\n[edit]\n\nJoan of Leeds was a nun who faked her death to escape from a convent.[14]\n\n18th century\n\n[edit]\n\nTimothy Dexter was an eccentric 18th-century New England businessman probably best known for his punctuationless book A Pickle for the Knowing Ones. However, he is also known for having faked his own death to see how people would react. He paid his wife and members of his family with instructions to act. After the funeral he caned his wife for her poor acting by not looking sufficiently saddened at his passing.[15][16]\n\nGeorgy Gruzinsky, a Russian nobleman, faked his death in 1798 to avoid a court sentence.

He actually died in 1982.[citation needed]\n\nHorst Kopkow, German SS major and war criminal, was declared dead by his MI6 handlers in January 1948. In reality he had been relocated to West Germany, where he died in 1996.[20]\n\nJuan Pujol García, Spanish spy, faked his death from malaria in Angola in 1949, with help from the British spy agency MI5. He lived the remainder of his life in Venezuela and died in 1988.[citation needed]\n\nLawrence Joseph Bader, an American salesperson, disappeared in 1957 and was presumed dead. He was found alive five years later assuming the identity of \"John 'Fritz' Johnson\", working as a local TV personality in Omaha, Nebraska. He either had amnesia of his life or was a hoaxer. He actually died in 1966, aged 39.[citation needed]\n\nKen Kesey, American novelist, faked his suicide in 1965. He died in 2001.[citation needed]\n\nJohn Allen, a British criminal and murderer, faked his own death in 1966 to avoid prosecution for crimes he had committed.[21] Allen actually died in 2015.\n\nJohn Stonehouse, a British politician who in November 1974 faked his own suicide by drowning to escape financial difficulties and live with his mistress.

Police there initially thought he might be Lord Lucan (who had disappeared only a few weeks earlier, after being suspected of murder) and jailed him.[22] Sent back to Britain, he was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison for fraud.[23]\n\nJerry Balisok, an American professional wrestler, successfully convinced the FBI that he had died in 1978 in the Jonestown Massacre to avoid fraud charges, assuming the identity \"Ricky Allen Wetta\". A decade later, Wetta was arrested and convicted for attempted murder, at which point he was determined to be Balisok.[24] Balisok actually died in 2013 while in prison for an unrelated crime.[25]\n\nAudrey Marie Hilley, an American murderer, jumped bail in 1979 and lived under the assumed identity of Robbi Hannon. In 1982, under a different alias, she announced the death of Hannon. She was captured and imprisoned, and died in 1987.[citation needed]\n\nSukumara Kurup, an Indian who faked his own death by placing the corpse of his murder victim in his car and setting it on fire in 1984.

He evaded arrest and is in a fugitive list of Interpol and Kerala Police.\n\nDavid Friedland, a former New Jersey senator, faked his own death via scuba-diving accident in 1985 while awaiting trial on racketeering charges.[26] In December 1987, he was arrested by officials in Maldives, where he had been working as a scuba dive master and had posed in scuba gear for a picture post card. He eventually was returned to the United States and served nine years in prison. Friedland died in 2022.\n\nCharles Peter Mule, a Louisiana policeman, was charged with 29 counts related to the rape and molestation of several young girls in 1988. After being released on bail, Mule left his truck alongside a bridge and sent a note to his police department. His claimed suicide was ruled inconclusive after police failed to find a corpse in the river, and a hiker reported to police that a man had opened fire on him without warning and whose description matched Mule's. After the case was profiled on the television show Unsolved Mysteries, Mule was captured.[27]\n\nPhilip Sessarego, British author, faked his death by car bomb in Croatia in 1991 for unknown reasons, and lived under an assumed name for the next 17 years, with his own family only learning he was alive when he appeared in a 2001 TV interview. He died of an accidental poisoning in 2008.[28]\n\nRussell Causley, a British man, faked his death by jumping off a ferry off the coast of Guernsey in 1993 as part of an insurance scam. His scheme was soon uncovered and he was jailed for fraud; this led to the police re-opening an investigation into the disappearance of his partner Carole Packman, who Causley would be convicted of murdering in 1996.[29]\n\nFrancisco Paesa, an agent of Centro Nacional de Inteligencia, the Spanish secret service, faked a fatal cardiac arrest in 1998 in Thailand, after having tricked Luis Roldán, known for being the general of the Spanish Civil Guard when a big scandal of corruption arose in 1993, into stealing all the money that Roldán had previously stolen in that case.

Darwin and his wife, Anne, were arrested and charged with fraud, deception, and money laundering related to the life insurance payout of £250,000.[31] They were each sentenced to more than six years in prison, and all their property sold, and all their money taken, including his pension, to repay.[32][33]\n\nClayton Counts, American musician, reported himself dead on his website in 2007 as a prank. He actually died in 2016.[citation needed]\n\nSamuel Israel III, an American hedge fund manager who was facing 22 years in prison for financial malfeasance and fraud, left his truck and a suicide note at a bridge in an attempted fake suicide in April 2008. Authorities suspected that his suicide was faked since, among other things, passersby reported that a car had picked someone up on the bridge from near Israel's abandoned car. Two years were added to Israel's sentence for obstruction of justice, which he is currently serving.[1]: 1–12, 38–39\n\nMarcus Schrenker, a financial manager from Fishers, Indiana, US, was charged with defrauding clients, and in 2009 attempted to fake his own death in a plane crash to avoid prosecution.

These theories are all considered fringe theories. Among the suspected faked deaths include:\n\nAdolf Hitler, dictator of Nazi Germany (1933–1945), has been speculated (including by writer Emil Ludwig) to have faked his death and escaped Berlin in mid-1945, the setting of his death as established by Western scholars.[41][42] Hitler is claimed to have utilized established escape routes while leaving behind misleading evidence such as his dental remains (via dentures and a broken-off jawbone) as well as a body double.[42][43][44]\n\nHarold Holt, former Prime Minister of Australia,[45] disappeared on the beach in 1967 with the consensus that he had drowned.

Rumors claimed that he faked his death and went into hiding. Many of these fans have claimed to sighted Elvis (whose face was well known) in various places around the world. The earliest known alleged sighting of Elvis after was at the Memphis International Airport where a man who resembled Elvis gave the name \"John Burrows\", which was the same name Elvis used when booking hotels.[46] In 1978, Gail Brewer-Giorgio published a book titled Orion, a novel about a fictional Presley-like singer called \"Orion\", who in the story faked his death to escape the pressures of fame. According to Brewer-Giorgio, her publisher inexplicably had her novel recalled from stores which made her wonder if the real Elvis Presley faked his death.[47] She then began an investigation and wrote another book The Most Incredible Elvis Presley Story Ever Told AKA Is Elvis Alive? where she claimed that Elvis was faking his death.[48] In 2017, Elvis fans claimed to see the singer visit his home Graceland on his 82nd birthday.[49]\n\nTowards the end of the reign of Alexander I of Russia, Emperor of Russia (1801–1825), he was increasingly suspicious of those around him and was more religious.[50]: 41 [51][52] He then caught typhus and died.[53] Russian legends claim that the Tsar faked his death and left for Siberia where he became a hermit and took on the name \"Feodor Kuzmich\". Such legends existed during Kuzmich's lifetime. When Kuzmich was on his deathbed in 1876, the priest there to perform the last rites on Kuzmich asked him if he was Tsar Alexander. Kuzmich replied with a vague sentence that did not answer the question.[54] Historians are skeptical of the claim that Tsar Alexander I was Feodor Kuzmich.[55]\n\nAfter rapper Jarad Higgins, known as Juice WRLD, died from a drug overdose at the age of 21,[56] many fans speculated that his lyrics suggested that he expected to die young and thus could have faked his death.[57] For example, in \"Legends\", he sings, \"What's the 27 club? We ain't making it past 21,\" referring to a group of famous artists who died at the age of 27 (e.g. Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, and Jimi Hendrix).\n\nPseudocides in fiction\n\n[edit]\n\nRomeo and Juliet (Shakespeare) – To avoid a forced marriage, Juliet drinks a potion that causes her to appear dead for 42 hours.

Holmes explains that he survived the fall where Moriarty did not, but had to remain \"officially\" dead while Moriarty's lieutenant, Sebastian Moran, was still at large. This event was loosely adapted by Steven Moffat for the 2010s television series Sherlock starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman in the episode \"The Reichenbach Fall\". Holmes is the subject of Jim Moriarty's work to undermine him in the public's view to drive Holmes to suicide. Moriarty instead kills himself and Holmes appears to kill himself to save his friends, but survives with the help of his brother Mycroft Holmes and returns to his work in the next episode, \"The Empty Hearse\".\n\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn – to escape both his drunken father and his strict legal guardian, the main character fakes his own murder.[5]: 27\n\nThe Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin[5]: 105\n\nGone Girl (2014): In the bestselling book and film, the Dunne marriage is falling apart after the husband is discovered to be having an affair and the wife commits pseudocide and travels to the western U.S.[5]: 27\n\nHouse, M.D.: Dr. Gregory House, the titular character of the television series, fakes his death in the series finale by switching dental records with a deceased patient.
