        "text": "Musicians and artists who died at age 27\n\nThe 27 Club is an informal list consisting mostly of popular musicians,[2][3][4][5][6] often expanded by artists, actors, and other celebrities who died at age 27. Although the claim of a \"statistical spike\" for the death of musicians at that age has been refuted by scientific research, it remains a cultural phenomenon, with many celebrities who die at 27 noted for their high-risk lifestyles.\n\nCultural phenomenon\n\nBeginning with the deaths of several 27-year-old popular musicians between 1969 and 1971 (such as Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison), dying at the age of 27 came to be, and remains, a perennial subject of popular culture, celebrity journalism, and entertainment industry lore.[2][3] This cultural phenomenon, which came to be known as the \"27 Club,\" attributes special significance to popular musicians, artists, actors, and other celebrities who died at age 27, often as a result of drug and alcohol abuse or violent means such as homicide, suicide, or transportation-related accidents.[7] The cultural phenomenon gave rise to an urban myth that celebrity deaths are more common at 27, a claim that has been refuted by statistical research as discussed in the § Scientific studies section below.[8][5]\n\nHistory\n\nBrian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison all died at the age of 27 between 1969 and 1971. At the time, the coincidence gave rise to some comment,[9][10] but, according to Hendrix and Kurt Cobain's biographer, Charles R. Cross, \"It wasn't until Kurt Cobain took his own life in 1994 that the idea of the 27 Club arrived in the popular zeitgeist.\"[11] Cross claims that the \"launch of the Club concept\" can be traced to the growing influence of the internet and sensational celebrity journalism on popular culture in the years following Cobain's death, as well as media interpretations of a statement by Cobain's mother, Wendy Fradenburg Cobain O'Connor, quoted in the local Aberdeen, Washington, newspaper The Daily World, and subsequently carried worldwide by the Associated Press: \"Now he's gone and joined that stupid club. I told him not to join that stupid club.\"[12] Many contemporary journalists interpreted her words as referring to the infamous untimely deaths of fellow rock musicians like Hendrix, Joplin, and Morrison, a view shared by Cross and R. Gary Patterson, chronicler of rock music urban myth.[13][14][11][15]\n\nThe intended meaning of \"that stupid club\" referred to by Cobain's mother is disputed. In his analysis of how her quote helped popularize the 27 Club, Eric Segalstad, author of The 27s: The Greatest Myth of Rock & Roll, asserted that she was actually referring to the \"tragic family matter\" of Cobain's two uncles and his great-uncle, all of whom had committed suicide.[17] Other contemporary journalists linked her quote to the then-recent heroin-related deaths of fellow young Seattle rock musicians Stefanie Sargent of 7 Year Bitch and Andrew Wood of Mother Love Bone, both aged 24.[18] Cross, himself, dismissed \"the absurd notion that Kurt Cobain intentionally timed his death so he could join the 27 Club,\" noting that Cobain \"had nearly died from drug overdoses on at least two dozen occasions in the year before his death... [and] made several previous suicide attempts at various ages.[11]\n\nIn 2011, seventeen years after Cobain's death, Amy Winehouse died at the age of 27, prompting a renewed swell of media attention devoted to the 27 Club.[19] Three years earlier, Winehouse's personal assistant, Alex Haines, told the British press that Winehouse, then 25, feared she would join Jim Morrison, Brian Jones, and Kurt Cobain in dying at 27: \"She reckoned she would join the 27 Club of rock stars who died at that age. She told me, 'I have a feeling I'm gonna die young'.\"[20]\n\nScientific studies\n\nDespite the cultural significance given to musician and celebrity deaths at age 27, the common claim that they are statistically more common at this age is an urban myth, refuted by scientific research.[2][3][4][5]\n\nA study by university academics published in the British Medical Journal in December 2011 concluded that there was no increase in the risk of death for musicians at the age of 27, stating that there were equally small increases at ages 25 and 32. The study noted that young adult musicians have a higher death rate than the general young adult population, surmising that \"fame may increase the risk of death among musicians, but this risk is not limited to age 27\".[8]\n\nA 2014 article at The Conversation suggested that statistical evidence shows popular musicians are most likely to die at the age of 56 (2.2% compared to 1.3% at 27).[5]\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThe 27 Club frequently appears by name and reference in popular culture and mass media. Several exhibitions have been devoted to the idea, as well as novels, films, stage plays, songs, video games, and comics.[22][6][23]\n\nMusic\n\nThe title of the song \"27\" by Fall Out Boy from their 2008 album Folie à Deux is a reference to the club. The lyrics explore the hedonistic lifestyles common in rock and roll. Pete Wentz, the primary lyricist of Fall Out Boy, wrote the song because he felt that he was living a similarly dangerous lifestyle.[25]\n\nJohn Craigie's song \"28\", which appeared on his 2009 album Montana Tale, and 2018 live album Opening for Steinbeck, is written from the perspective of 27 Club members Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, and Kurt Cobain, as each contemplates their respective mortality and imagines what they would do differently \"if I could only make it to twenty eight.\"[26][27] Craigie wrote the song when he himself was age 27.[28]\n\nThe theme is referenced in the song \"27 Forever\" by Eric Burdon, on his 2013 album 'Til Your River Runs Dry.[29]\n\nMagenta's 2013 studio album The Twenty Seven Club directly references the club. Each track is a tribute to a member of the club.[30]\n\nHalsey's song \"Colors,\" from her 2015 debut album, Badlands, includes the line \"I hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old.\"[31]\n\nJPEGMafia's 2016 album Black Ben Carson includes a song titled \"The 27 Club\", which the song refers to the club. He references members Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Kurt Cobain.[32]\n\nAdore Delano released a song called \"27 Club\" on her 2017 studio album Whatever, with the repeated lyric \"All of the legends die at twenty seven.\" Delano was aged 27 at the time of release.[33]\n\nJuice Wrld referenced the club on his 2018 song \"Legends\", where he says \"What's the 27 Club? We ain't making it past 21.\" The song was dedicated to XXXTentacion, who was killed at 20, and Lil Peep, who died from an overdose at 21.[34]\n\nVideo games\n\nIn the 2016 video game Hitman, one of the in-game missions, Club 27, involves killing an indie musician who is celebrating his 27th birthday.[35]\n\nIdentified members\n\nBecause the 27 Club is entirely notional, there is no official membership. The table below lists individuals explicitly described as \"members\" of the 27 Club by journalists and writers in various books and publications.\n\nSome deaths linked to the 27 Club pre-date its emergence as a cultural phenomenon. Blues musician Robert Johnson, who died in 1938, is one of the earliest popular musicians included by various sources.[36][37]\n\nDespite the club's original association with the deaths of popular musicians, later sources began to link actors, artists, athletes, and other celebrities to the 27 Club. Rolling Stone included television actor Jonathan Brandis, who committed suicide in 2003, in a list of 27 Club members.[37] Anton Yelchin, who had played in a punk rock band but was primarily known as a film actor, was also described as a member of the club upon his death in 2016.[38] Likewise, Jean-Michel Basquiat has been linked to the club despite being known primarily as a painter, with his music career being relatively brief and obscure.[39]\n\nPurported 27 Club members Name Date of birth Date of death Cause of death Fame Age Sources November 10, 1864 January 17, 1892 Not recorded Composer, pianist and conductor 27 years, 68 days [40] March 13, 1881 March 26, 1908 Neurosyphilitic sclerosis Ragtime musician 27 years, 13 days [40] August 3, 1887 April 23, 1915 Sepsis Poet 27 years, 263 days [41] May 8, 1911 August 16, 1938 Unknown Blues singer and musician 27 years, 100 days [40][36] March 21, 1912 April 4, 1939 Traffic accident, probable murder.
