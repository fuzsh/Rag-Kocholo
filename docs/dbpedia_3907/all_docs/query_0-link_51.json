The film stars Michael Abbott Jr., Virginia Newcomb, Andre Hyland, Sarah Baker, Jess Weixler, Roy Wood Jr., and Sunita Mani.\n\nThe Death of Dick Long premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2019.[1] The film was released by A24 on September 27, 2019.[4]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nLate at night, friends Dick, Zeke, and Earl hang out together until Dick sustains unexplained severe injuries. The friends leave him at an emergency room.\n\nEarl returns home and tells his girlfriend Lake that he has to leave town for a family emergency, but he attends a shift at his warehouse job.\n\nZeke sneaks into bed, fooling his wife Lydia into thinking he had been asleep. She asks him to drive their daughter Cynthia to school. He agrees and accidentally pulls Dick's wallet out; he and Earl took it from him, as he lay unconscious. Zeke takes the driver's license and puts it on the counter and gets Cynthia to the garage but realizes his back seat is covered in blood; he covers it with a sheet.\n\nAs the two men begin their day, Doctor Richter—the emergency room doctor—calls the police department to tell them Dick has died overnight from severe rectal hemorrhaging.\n\nAs Zeke goes inside a gas station and inside the store, Cynthia tells Officer Dudley about Dick's wallet. Zeke notices the blood in the back seat has soaked into Cynthia's dress. He runs inside to keep the police officer from seeing and gives her the wallet.\n\nEarl arrives at Zeke's house and they scrub the blood out of the back seat. Earl takes Cynthia to school in his truck where he speaks to Dick's widow Jane, who still knows nothing about the previous night's events. Earl and Zeke decide to dump the car in a river to hide the evidence.\n\nAt the police station, Sheriff Spenser enlists Dudley to help her with the murder. The next morning Zeke lies to Lydia saying their car was stolen the night before, so she calls the police and Dudley and Spenser arrive to question her. The interrogation is brief and Richter calls the police and tells them horse semen was in Dick's rectum.\n\nCynthia overhears Zeke and tells Lydia how he drove her in the car that morning. Lydia confronts Zeke about the inconsistencies and Zeke breaks down and tells her that Dick is dead. Then he confesses that the three friends had been participating in zoophilic acts for years, and that Dick died from having sex with Dick and Jane's horse Comet. Lydia, confused and angry, demands that he leave the house.\n\nAt Jane's house, Jane walks to their stable to find Zeke drunk. The two go to Zeke's home where Dudley is waiting to question him about the connection between the car, the wallet and Dick's death, not realizing Jane is Dick's widow. Lydia and Zeke's stories spiral out of control until he runs out of the kitchen. Dudley chases him and Lydia tells Jane to stay so she can tell her how Dick died. Zeke frees Comet and begs him to run away as Dudley arrests him.\n\nThe next morning, Dudley and Spenser walk to the site of the ditched car and the sheriff explains that Zeke has been released. Dudley is incredulous but her boss explains that these charges would ruin the lives of Lydia, Cynthia and Jane. Zeke goes to Cynthia's school where Lydia tells him to get out of their lives.\n\nThat night, Zeke goes to Earl and Lake's motel room. Zeke asks what Earl's plan is and he says that he'll come up with something, and starts playing \"How You Remind Me\" on his guitar.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nDaniel Scheinert as Dick Long\n\nMichael Abbott Jr. as Ezekiel \"Zeke\" Olsen, a friend of Dick Long\n\nVirginia Newcomb as Lydia Olsen, Zeke's wife\n\nAndre Hyland as Earl Wyeth, Dick and Zeke's friend\n\nSarah Baker as Officer Dudley, a relatively inexperienced police officer\n\nJess Weixler as Jane Long, a schoolteacher and Dick's wife\n\nRoy Wood Jr. as Dr. Richter, the physician who discovers Dick\n\nSunita Mani as Lake Travis, Earl's friend\n\nPoppy Cunningham as Cynthia Olsen, Lydia and Zeke's daughter\n\nJanelle Cochrane as Sheriff Spenser, Officer Dudley's superior and mentor\n\nEugene Henry Jr as Ted, a store clerk\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Death of Dick Long premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2019.[1] It was theatrically released by A24 in the United States on September 27, 2019. The film was theatrically released in Japan in the Summer of 2020 under the alternate title How Did Dick Long Die? [4]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 75% based on 79 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"The Death of Dick Long mixes dark humor with provocative ideas to produce a sharp blend that's admittedly uneven but uniquely satisfying.\"[5] On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100 based on 21 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[6]\n\nWriting for The A.V. Club, Ignatiy Vishnevetsky gave the film a B−, favorably comparing it to the absurdity and grotesqueness of Swiss Army Man, saying the tone \"falls somewhere between irony and sincere fondness\".[7]\n\nInspiring events\n\n[edit]\n\nAs the death of the titular character is due to internal injuries sustained from intercourse with a horse[8] the film evokes a parallel to the real-life death of Kenneth Pinyan, an engineer who worked for Boeing and resided in Gig Harbor, Washington. Those events were widely reported by The Seattle Times as the Enumclaw horse sex case.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
