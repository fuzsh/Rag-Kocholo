My method of writing is exploratory about that.\"\n\nThat's certainly the case with Agency, Gibson's latest, a densely structured, complexly plotted novel that takes place in two separate time frames, which he refers to as \"stubs,\" and has as one of its central characters an AI named Eunice, who is one part uploaded human consciousness and another part specialized military machine intelligence. In one stub it's 2017, a woman is in the White House, and Brexit never happened. But the threat of nuclear war nonetheless hovers over a conflict in the Middle East. In the other stub, it's 22nd century London after \"the jackpot,\" a grim timeline of disasters that has reduced the Earth's population by 80 percent and left Britain to be ruled by \"the klept,\" which Gibson describes as a \"hereditary authoritarian government, [with its] roots in organized crime.\"\n\nGiven these scenarios, it's no surprise to discover that the 71-year-old Gibson's latest work was heavily influenced by the 2016 election and the ascendancy of Donald Trump to the presidency. \"The book I had been imagining had been a kind of a romp,\" says the U.S.-born Gibson down the phone line from his long-time home in Vancouver, B.C. \"But then the election happened, and I thought, 'Uh-oh, my whole sense of the present is 24 hours out of date, and that's enough to make the book I've been working on kind of meaningless.' It took me a long time [to re-think and re-write the book], and I thought the weirdness factor of reality, finding some balance -- what can I do with the existing level of weirdness, and that level kept going up. I wanted to write a book that current events wouldn't have left by the time it got out, and I think Agency works....\"\n\n\"It's an interesting time for science fiction now,\" says Gibson, \"because there are people writing contemporary fiction who are effectively writing science fiction, because the world they live in has become science fiction. Writing a contemporary novel today that doesn't involve concepts that wouldn't have been seen in science fiction 20 years ago is impossible. Unless it's an Amish novel.\"\n\nThe Washington Post calls Gibson's new novel \"engaging, thought-provoking and delightful,\" while the senior editor at Medium's tech site One Zero says it's the first time Gibson \"has taken direct aim at Silicon Valley, at the industry and culture that has reorganized the world -- with some of his ideas propelling it.\"\n\n\"The result is a blend of speculation and satire that any self-respecting denizen of the digital world should spend some time with.\"\n\nAnd they're also publishing an exclusive excerpt from the novel."
