It helps to dispel the image of wolves as \"evil\" and demonstrates their role in maintaining the balance of nature. Exceptional footage portrays the wolf's life cycle, the social organization of the pack, and offers glimpses of caribou, moose, deer and buffalo. It was the first documentary to feature footage of wolves being born in the wild, and of their first year of life.\n\nDeath of the Legend was followed two years later by Mason's feature-length theatrical documentary on wolves, Cry of the Wild, also for the NFB, which screened throughout North America and earned $5. million.[2] In 1974, Mason completed his third and final film on wolves, Wolf Pack.\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nFestival of Tourist and Folklore Films, Brussels: Gold Medal - First Prize, 1971\n\nPhiladelphia International Festival of Short Films, Philadelphia: Award for Exceptional Merit, 1971\n\n23rd Canadian Film Awards, Toronto: Genie Award for Best Colour Cinematography to Bill Mason, 1971\n\nAmerican Film and Video Festival, New York: Red Ribbon, 1972\n\nInternational Festival of Scientific and Didactic Films, Madrid: Diploma of Honour, 1972\n\nYorkton Film Festival, Yorkton: Golden Sheaf Award for Best Nature and Wildlife Film, 1973[3]\n\nYorkton Film Festival, Yorkton: Golden Sheaf Award for Best Cinematography, 1973\n\nInternational Festival of Mountain and Exploration Films, Trento: Golden Rhododendron Award, 1974[4]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
