        "text": "Years ago, when asked how he’d like to be remembered, Mike Wallace responded, “Tough but fair.” Now, SiriusXM is paying tribute to the legendary journalist by spotlighting many of his memorable interviews embodying that answer on a new pop-up channel.\n\nStarting today, March 13, SiriusXM will air Wallace’s classic conversations from his prime-time ABC show The Mike Wallace Interview (1957-1960), marking their first broadcast in over 50 years. Tune in to Channel 109 from March 13-April 3 to hear over 100 of Wallace’s revealing interviews with some of the most famous and influential newsmakers from the era: Eleanor Roosevelt, Tennessee Williams, Rod Serling, Frank Lloyd Wright, Salvador Dalí, Oscar Hammerstein II, Sammy Davis Jr., Henry Kissinger, and many more. Additionally, the interviews will be available on the SXM App anytime during the pop-up channel’s run.\n\nThe interviews were obtained from Wallace’s personal library of 16mm prints and showcase an iconic broadcaster with a distinctive voice and presence. Listeners will hear his probing questions and intense style of interrogation, which he later showcased as one of the original correspondents on the TV newsmagazine 60 Minutes.\n\nIn the meantime, here’s a preview you’ll hear on the pop-up channel here:"
