He was also heavily involved in the search and rescue operation at the Kansas City Hyatt hotel disaster in 1981.  Mike’s Departmental Obituary, which highlights his professional and volunteer achievements, is available on Facebook at Lee’s Summit Fire Department and at the Lee’s Summit Tribune at lstribune.net\n \nMike developed a passion for music from an early age, especially the guitar, and was playing local events with his older brother by age 10, including the Indiana State Fair. Mike’s musical journey continued into his teen years when he and some classmates formed a rock band during their senior year of high school playing local clubs in Wichita, KS. He became a skilled guitar player. Eventually his musical dreams led him to songwriting, and in 1994 Mike was signed as a staff writer at the famous Sony “Tree” Publishing Company in Nashville, TN.\n \nMike had a love for history as well. He volunteered with the Lee’s Summit Historical Society and actively took part in community events and archiving Lee’s Summit Fire Department history.  Mike was a longtime member of The Lee’s Summit Christian Church.  He was an avid non-fiction reader. He was a barbecue connoisseur and made “Smokin’ on the Summit” an annual family event during Downtown Days.  He was known for his award-winning chili and for his biscuits and gravy.  Mike was passionate about his family.  He also loved fishing, cooking, Florida, the Chiefs, the Dolphins, blues music, crossword puzzles, the History Channel, all things extraterrestrial, his loving and faithful dog, Gracie, and his amazing wife, Cathy who he married in 1975. He was also an accomplished photographer, especially of flowers and wildlife. He was his family’s anchor in Lee’s Summit. If you were coming into town, you called Mike & Cathy and they always had room for you to stay. He always asked for a lemon meringue pie on his birthday.\n \nMike’s death is a profound loss to his family. He is survived by his beloved wife of 48 years, Cathy, of the home; his son David, daughter Sara; beloved grandchildren Megan (Daniel); Ryan, and Mikenlea. Additionally, his two brothers Rick Wallace (Patti); Ron Wallace (Lisa); and three sisters; Donna Wallace, Dori Wallace (Drake); and Diane Thornton-Wallace.
