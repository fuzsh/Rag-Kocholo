        "text": "Mike Wallace (May 9, 1918 – April 7, 2012) was an American journalist, game show host, actor and media personality. He interviewed a wide range of prominent newsmakers during his sixty-year career. He was one of the original correspondents for CBS’ 60 Minutes which debuted in 1968.\n\nOne of the rare times that Wallace was interviewed rather than interviewing, this interview took place on March 3, 1988."
