        "text": "Veteran journalist Mike Wallace, famed for his tough interviews on US news programme 60 Minutes over four decades, has died aged 93.\n\nA spokesperson for CBS said he died on Saturday and had been in declining health in recent years.\n\nWallace was one of the original hosts of 60 Minutes when it began in 1968.\n\nDuring his career he interviewed the likes of Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and Yasser Arafat, before announcing his retirement in 2006.\n\nHowever he still continued to do the occasional report for the show, including interviewing Jack Kevorkian - the US doctor who claimed to have assisted more than 100 suicides - in 2007.\n\n\"He was one of the great pioneers in journalism,\" anchor Bob Schieffer said during CBS's morning news programme. \"We are all going to miss him.\"\n\nIn almost 40 years on 60 Minutes, Wallace worked on some 800 investigative reports."
