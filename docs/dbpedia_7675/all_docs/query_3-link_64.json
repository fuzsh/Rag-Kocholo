        "text": "The Mike Wallace Interview was a short-lived television news program that aired on ABC from 1957-1959. At the time, Mike Wallace (born Myron Leon Wallace in 1918) was an upcoming journalist who had built a name for himself on both radio and television. From July 10-17, 1959, Wallace brought the Nation of Islam and Malcolm X to national attention with the television documentary The Hate that Hate Produced. Wallace subsequently developed a relationship with Malcolm X and has frequently spoken publicly about it since Malcolm's death."
