        "text": "Jeff McLane @ Jeff_McLane\n\n#Eagles WR Mike Wallace said he’s started running but he’s not yet ready. Called his broken fibula a 12-week injury. Broke it on Sept. 16, 11-1/2 weeks ago.\n\nAdam Schefter @ AdamSchefter\n\nEagles suddenly thin at WR. Mike Wallace is out indefinitely with an ankle injury, Mack Hollins is on IR with a groin injury, and Philadelphia still waiting for Alshon Jeffery to return from shoulder surgery.\n\nIan Rapoport @ RapSheet\n\n#Ravens WR Mike Wallace (knee) is expected to play today, source said, and it was a good sign he went through a full practice on Friday.\n\nIan Rapoport @ RapSheet\n\n#Ravens WR Mike Wallace, battling an ankle injury, has been adamant he's playing today against the #Browns. He was listed as questionable.\n\nJeff Zrebiec @ jeffzrebiecsun\n\nMike Wallace is over 100 yards receiving in the first half. 5 catches for 116 yards.\n\nAdam Schefter @ AdamSchefter\n\nRavens WRs Mike Wallace (back) and Jeremy Maclin (shoulder), listed as questionable for Sunday, both expected to play vs Titans, per source.\n\nIan Rapoport @ RapSheet\n\n#Ravens WR Jeremy Maclin (shoulder) is expected to play, as is TE Ben Watson (knee), sources say. Mike Wallace said he's OK for today, too.\n\nSean Koerner @ The_Oddsmaker\n\nJeremy Maclin is INACTIVE today. Make sure you get him out of your lineups. Mike Wallace suddenly becomes a high end WR3 today\n\nBaltimore Ravens @ Ravens\n\nWe have picked up the contract option for WR Mike Wallace to return to the team in 2017.\n\nRyan Mink @ ryanmink\n\nRavens wide receiver Mike Wallace just went over 1,000 yards this season.\n\nGarrett Downing @ gdowning14\n\nI think Mike Wallace likes going up against his old team.\n\nIan Rapoport @ RapSheet\n\nThe #Ravens should have WR Mike Wallace (chest) today, and he is expected to have an increased role with Steve Smith (ankle) unlikely to go."
