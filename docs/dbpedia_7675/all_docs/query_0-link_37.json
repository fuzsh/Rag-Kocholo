        "text": "In TV terms , the biographical film “Mike Wallace Is Here” is effectively a feature-length recap. Using only archival footage, the director Avi Belkin distills more than five decades of the longtime “60 Minutes” correspondent’s career on camera to an hour and a half. Presenting Wallace with relatively little mediation is a natural way to tell this story, even as it creates a limitation. Documentary as autobiography, the movie shows a man who is always cultivating his appearance for an audience.\n\n“Mike Wallace Is Here” opens with a clip in which Wallace spars with Bill O’Reilly, who criticizes networks like CBS for being too stodgy, but credits Wallace with being the driving force behind his career. The film argues that Wallace was instrumental in creating a tougher style of interviewing on television (as a counterpoint, Belkin shows softball questioning from Edward R. Murrow), and Wallace’s drive to be taken seriously becomes a recurring thread. We are repeatedly shown how the former commercial actor (and pitchman for Philip Morris) was regarded by some news veterans as a creature of show business rather than as a serious journalist — and how he worked assiduously to dispel that idea.\n\nA roll call of Wallace’s famous interviews could go on for many paragraphs. The highlight reel might include his 1957 discussion on “The Mike Wallace Interview” with the gangster Mickey Cohen, who asserted that he had “killed no men that in the first place didn’t deserve killing.” In 1979, Wallace asked the Ayatollah Khomeini about President Anwar Sadat of Egypt’s assessment of him as a “lunatic.” We hear about the potential chilling effect of a libel lawsuit against CBS that Gen. William C. Westmoreland, who commanded the United States forces in Vietnam, eventually dropped; and of Wallace’s interview with the Brown & Williamson whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand that the network stalled on airing."
