        "text": "Fifteen minutes before our screening of Mike Wallace is Here at True/False, I was sitting in a cafe with my friend Daphne Psaledakis, a journalist, who knew only that there was once a reporter named Mike Wallace, but very little of his career.\n\nI gave her an overview: Wallace was a legendary reporter who pioneered the sit-down interview. I told her about his early show, Nightbeat, which cemented the style. From there he went to CBS and joined up with Don Hewitt to create 60 Minutes. In the early days they went after small-scale crooks and fraudsters, but later on Wallace did interview after interview, each more legendary than the last. I told her about some of the most famous ones: Barbara Streisand, Ayatollah Kohmeini, John D. Ehrlichman, Johnny Carson and countless others. He was known for tough questions, bluntly asked. I threw in a few details about his life along the way; He had a son who threw himself off a cliff in Greece at a young age. His other son, Chris, is a Fox News anchor. He died in my hometown of New Canaan, Connecticut, in 2012.\n\nMike Wallace is the reason I wanted to be a journalist. I discovered 60 Minutes early in high school, and never looked back. Most Sundays, I’d come down to the living room with my mom and turn on the TV to hear the familiar sound of the ticking clock. Our DVR was full with episodes of 60 Minutes and Jeopardy. Unfortunately, I missed the era of Mike Wallace on television, but it didn’t take me long to start digging through old interviews online.\n\nToday, I’ve seen just about every interview Wallace has ever done or given, many times over. Resting on my nightstand in my bedroom back home is former executive producer Jeff Fager’s book, Fifty Years of 60 Minutes. Opening the front cover of it would reveal Fager’s signature and note that says “Danny — come see me!”\n\nIf one can be a ‘super fan’ of a journalist, then I am one of Wallace. As I was applying to colleges, and even still, the names Wallace, Safer and Bradley rang around in my head constantly as the ideal to strive for. I try every day to tell stories as compelling as theirs, with their tenacity.\n\nI almost wish I hadn’t told Daphne so much, though, as the film we were about to see together would hit on just about every single note I brought up. All the interviews and moments in his life that I mentioned were there, on screen, repeated.\n\nMike Wallace is Here opens with our titular reporter conducting an interview with Bill O’Reilly. Wallace shows O’Reilly an edit of outbursts he’s had during interviews on Fox. “That’s not an interview. That’s a lecture,” Wallace says.\n\nO’Reilly fires back, telling Wallace he’s to blame for pioneering the format. “You are the driving force behind my career,” he says. “I tell people, ‘If you have a problem with me, take it up with Wallace.’”\n\nThe premise set up by this opening is that the film will explore O’Reilly’s claim. The questions proposed are thus, “Is Wallace really to blame for the rise of television pundit journalism? Was his style problematic? Is it ethical to have journalism be personality-based content?” Wrapped up neatly, the core question is whether or not Wallace’s impact on journalism was a net positive or negative.\n\nThese are interesting questions to ask about Wallace, especially since almost everything else you could ask about him has been answered before. We know how he was hurt by the loss of his son in Greece. We know he grew up with a chip on his shoulder due to strict parents and a long bout with childhood acne. We know he struggled with depression in the wake of the CBS lawsuit about a Vietnam War piece 60 Minutes ran, and thanks to his retirement interview with Morely Safer, we know he tried to take his life because of it and failed.\n\nWallace held little back in the many interviews he gave over the years, but didn’t often speak of the emotional impact of events in his life. The premise of an archival documentary re-contextualizing this legendary footage in order to answer specific questions either about him or his impact is a great one.\n\nThe problem is that the documentary doesn’t answer any of these questions. In fact, it doesn’t even know which questions to ask. It is unsure if it’s a movie about Mike Wallace the man, or Mike Wallace and his effect on the medium, and as such fails to truly be either. Mike Wallace is Here is like a greatest hits album of Wallace’s work, strong by virtue of its source material and not in the way it is put together.\n\nThe film is not without its strong moments or clever decisions, though, but they are too few and far between to stand out or have a unique voice amongst the several biographical pieces about Wallace that we already have.\n\nMost of the film is framed with two boxes side-by-side on screen, one displaying the shot of Wallace during the interview and the other showing his subject. It is a clever way to break the original 60 Minutes edit and show both ends of the shot-reverse-shot without having to cut. As superficial as it might seem, I enjoyed those seconds of technically-unseen footage where I could appreciate the full depth of the interview.\n\nBut that same framing makes the documentary feel distant. The shots don’t take up the full space of the screen, leaving black negative space between and surrounding both shots. It doesn’t put you in the room with Wallace and the subject like those original interviews did: it keeps you at arms length, which is antithetical to the philosophy of 60 Minutes, which sought to tell very intimate stories through extended interviews between personalities.\n\nAfter the film, director Avi Belkin said he “wanted to do an interview of Mike Wallace by Mike Wallace.” A fantastic idea and premise that the film fails to capitalize on. I can’t help but feel that, if Mike were to be asked some of the questions that the film asks about him, he would say, “That’s a lousy question,” a phrase we hear him repeat multiple times in the film, almost as if he’s commenting on it post-mortem. None of the questions are tough. None of the questions are without answers.\n\n“What the dickens are you talking about?” — One of Mike Wallace’s most iconic phrases.\n\nThe most interesting question asked in Mike Wallace is Here is how Wallace’s background as an ad man and performer influenced his work, and whether he became bigger than the stories he told. The truth is that Wallace was always, at his core, a performer. But that didn’t make him any less the journalist — quite the opposite. It meant he knew what to say, when to say it and how to say it in order to get the most honest, compelling reaction from his subject he possibly could.\n\nMike Wallace was a performer when he asked Ayatollah Kohmeini if he was a lunatic. He was a performer when he told Bette Davis she was “not just difficult, [but] impossible.” He was a performer when he read John D. Ehrlichman a laundry list of charges against him. And the public is made better by this performance, as it got us closer to the truth. Does art and performance not sometimes speak more to the truth than the literal can? Why not then use that tool in journalism?\n\nOf course, there are valid criticisms of this style to consider beyond the high opinion of it I have. One could argue that, if Wallace really was a performer, then he is to blame for characters like Bill O’Reilly rising to popularity — that Wallace gave birth to a breed of journalism which was more about bombastic reactions than truth. The film doesn’t come down on either side of it.\n\nAnother stand-out moment was an interview Wallace did with an inflammatory Italian journalist who relentlessly challenged his opinions about the profession. In truth, these two characters are exactly alike. They are analogs of one another. But the film is too eager to cut away from this pairing and move on to the next moment. It too eagerly looks for opportunities to make the viewer go, “Ah! I remember that interview!”\n\nI digress. The point I’m trying to make is that the film spent too little time on its most interesting question, and too little time on interesting questions overall.\n\nI understand that this is an archival documentary, and in all fairness, it is a hurculean task to ask such contemporary questions and look for the answers only in existing footage. When Belkin began production on the documentary, Wallace had already been dead for at least five years. The issue is that it feels like an effort to look deeper or re-contextualize familiar footage was barely even made. Imagine a film where those famous Mike Wallace moments were played in a way that revealed something deeper behind them, something beyond the surface level of the interview. I’m not even sure if it can be done, but this film certainly doesn’t accomplish it.\n\nMike Wallace is Here falls into a trap I am weary of when it comes to pieces about Wallace. Whenever he asked a pointed, tough question which could swing the mood of an interview, it was always considered. He might make a statement at a subject based on the evidence at hand — say, “You’re a crook,” — to get the subject’s reaction and a read on their moral compass.\n\nWhen that question is asked, as an editor, you have three options:\n\nCut right after the questions is asked. This is most often used in compilations of Wallace’s clips to make the point that he “asked tough questions.”\n\nCut after the reaction from the subject. This is a very common way to edit these moments, and one 60 Minutes used often in Wallace’s pieces. You have the question, and the immediate reaction, and then you cut away to b-roll or voiceover relating to why the question was asked.\n\nLet the interview play out past the reaction. 60 Minutes often used a blend of this and the previous option, cutting away after a heated moment then coming right back to the interview.\n\nThe trap here is over-reliance on the first and second options, which Mike Wallace is Here too often resorts to.\n\nIn my opinion, the third way is the correct way to edit Wallace’s interviews. When Wallace asked the question, it was with the knowledge that the interview would still continue after. A particularly harsh question might take someone off-guard, changing the mood of not just the immediate moment but the entire interview thereafter. In other words, those famous, punchy Mike Wallace moments are not just moments — they persist through the entirety of an interview.\n\n“He called you, forgive me, Iman — his words, not mine — ‘a lunatic.’” — Mike Wallace in 1979, interviewing Ayatollah Kohmeini in Iran.\n\nIt’s a shame that Mike Wallace is Here more closely emulates the spirit of a highlight reel than the spirit of its subject’s work. It is far too eager to cut right after the interviewee’s reaction and fails to acknowledge the greater purpose behind Wallace’s dramatic questions.\n\nIn the post-screening Q&A, Belkin said he spent two years sifting through thousands upon thousands of hours of footage. What I found myself thinking was “why would you do that only to tell the same story that’s already been told so many times, and is told in the very footage you assembled?” It’s an exercise in regurgitation.\n\nIn the same answer, Belkin said that Wallace was present covering so many historical events, that he resembled Forrest Gump— something that stuck out to me because it’s a comparison that has been made before. In fact, it was made word-for-word by Steve Kroft in a 60 minutes tribute to Mike Wallace.\n\nThough I am unable to find the exact clip now, Kroft says that upon zooming in at any historical event or party convention, you’d see him there, Mike Wallace, standing in the crowd like Forrest Gump. From there, it’s also worth noting that the clips used, the order they are used in, and the length for which they play in the film are remarkably similar to a number of pieces about Wallace which 60 Minutes has created. The most striking comparison is between the film and the tribute to Mike Wallace which 60 Minutes ran after his death in 2012. Those of you who saw the film at True/False and then watch this will be struck with a disturbing sense of Deja Vu.\n\nI dont mean to claim that director Avi Belkin plagiarized, but it is certainly clear that he has seen these clips many times over — more than even I have — and they influenced the structure of his film to a problematic degree. I bring it up because it speaks to unoriginality. The film is essentially that tribute piece, extended, and without character. There is nothing fresh or interesting to be seen here.\n\nAs such, there is no great achievement in Mike Wallace is Here. Nothing is gained from this hour-and-a-half edit of some of Mike Wallace’s great interviews, intercut with some in which he was the subject. This film is not a feat of direction, voice and certainly not of editing.\n\nI laughed during the film. My audience laughed, and was hooked by the tense moments in interviews. I was leaning forward in my seat most of the time. But the strength of Mike Wallace is Here does not lie in the film itself nor in its production. It lies in the source material. This movie is compelling, entertaining and enjoyable because Mike Wallace and the interviews he conducted were. It’s a highlight reel — nothing more. A simple story told in the most obvious way it could be done."
