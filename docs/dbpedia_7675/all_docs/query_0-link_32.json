        "text": "Mike Wallace: A Life\n\nby Peter Rader\n\nThomas Dunne Books\n\nAt the height of his power as America’s most noble and dogged muckraking journalist, one national advertisement best distilled his renegade brand: “The four most feared words in the English language,” it read. “Mike Wallace is here.”\n\nThe year was 1980, and Wallace had inspired such fear and loathing among political and corporate power-brokers that some began taking courses in media training, just in case. As one of the original correspondents for “60 Minutes,” Wallace, with his dignified bearing and stentorian delivery, was something of a purebred among a species that would soon be near-extinct: the gilded, trusted reporter.\n\nOf course, Wallace was able to cultivate this reputation in large part due to the quaintness of technology then, coupled with a professional code of silence. In truth, according to Peter Rader’s new biography, Mike Wallace was a raging bully, a narcissist who neglected his wives and children, a misogynist who roamed the halls of “60 Minutes” smoking cigarettes and snapping bra straps, a depressive with suicidal tendencies and a failed actor who, after many false starts, found the greatest role of his life: that of a crusading investigative journalist named Mike Wallace.\n\nHE was born Myron Wallace in 1918, the year that World War I ended, and it’s still astonishing to realize that during some of his watershed moments — the Tet Offensive, or the Iran hostage crisis — Wallace was well into his 50s and 60s. No other newsman has had his longevity, nor wound up woven into contemporary American history, as he has.\n\nThe son of Russian immigrants, Wallace grew up blue-collar in Brookline, Mass., and for a short time attended grammar school with John F. Kennedy. But Wallace was solidly working-class and for the rest of his life would struggle with his desire to be part of the upper echelon while working to strip away much of its inherent hypocrisies.\n\nHe was a solid B student yet drifted after high school. His 20s were restless: Wallace got married, started a family, picked up small radio gigs and enlisted in the Navy. By his early 30s, Wallace had two sons, was twice divorced and struggling to find his niche.\n\nAfter co-hosting a daytime chat show, Wallace’s next pursuit was as the lead actor in a Broadway play called “Reclining Figure.” It closed in less than two months.\n\nAfter finding wife No. 3 — an art-world sophisticate named Lorraine Perigord, herself twice divorced and mother of two — Wallace began to bear down on journalism. Lorraine was equally smart and highly encouraging, yet Wallace explained, in a 1957 Good Housekeeping profile unearthed by Rader, that it was Lorraine’s essential European-ness that attracted him:\n\n“You have that certain deference to the male, which I confess I like in European women,” he said. “I’m not suggesting that a wife should walk one step behind her husband — but it helps! It’s a ‘by-your-leave, my lord’ attitude that you just don’t find in American women.”\n\nONCE remarried, Wallace became consumed with work. In 1956, after a series of what would qualify as odd jobs — hosting game shows, doing cigarette ads — Wallace got serious, sending letters of intent to the three major networks. After promising to give up the lucrative-yet-credibility-shredding side gigs, Wallace was hired to anchor a new program called “Night Beat” (think “Nightline” with a more aggressive line of questioning). Here, finally, was an outlet for the deep rivulet of anger that coursed beneath Wallace’s composed exterior — as well as an arrested attitude toward sex.\n\nHe asked Sammy Davis Jr. what it was like to wake up next to a white woman. After interviewing actor Anthony Quinn, Wallace walked up to his writer, Al Ramrus, and said, “Can you imagine the kind of f— that guy throws?” Of a particularly satisfying interview with Anne Bancroft, Wallace said, “I had my hand right up her pants.”\n\nThe show was a breakout hit, and Wallace’s unsparing style of questioning led the press to call him “Mike Malice.”\n\n“Night Beat” was a groundbreaking mix of high-low culture: interspersed among the chats with Norman Mailer, Salvador Dali, Thurgood Marshall and Frank Lloyd Wright were strippers, addicts, thugs and Klansmen. Its approach — part New Yorker, part supermarket tabloid — inspired another young broadcast genius named Don Hewitt.\n\n“60 Minutes” premiered on Sept. 24, 1968, with Hewitt as producer. Its first episode covered the presidential campaigns of Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey, an explication of the electoral process and commentary by humorist Art Buchwald.\n\n“60 Minutes,” Rader writes, was uniquely suited to Wallace’s strengths. His actor’s training taught him the value of silences, which would often provoke a telling admission; Wallace would listen closely and pick out one damning word choice that would elevate an interview from a grilling to an exposé. He was also a thorough reporter, and his deep research would lead an unwitting subject right into the verbal gallows.\n\nThe only other correspondent, Harry Reasoner, had a garrulous, Midwestern affability meant to offset Wallace’s East Coast hauteur — yet his arrogance was of a different sort.\n\n“There’s nothing less moral about having a drink at 11 o’clock in the morning than there is at 11 o’clock at night,” Reasoner once said. (Given that a staff of writers, producers and editors were doing the heavy lifting, he wasn’t totally wrong.) He sometimes began as early as 8 in the morning, then slept off a liquid lunch at the office.\n\nReasoner also had an active love life, dating, among others, Angie Dickinson — his marriage and seven children, Rader writes, no impediment. Reasoner’s sozzled laziness and entitlement soon bled over to the airwaves; one evening, announcing his impending assignment in Vietnam, Reasoner told the viewing audience, “I haven’t been in Vietnam since 1953, so I’ll have to study up on it. I understand the French have left.”\n\nWALLACE and Hewitt were no better. Very few women were on staff in those days, and, Rader writes, the ones who were found themselves subjected to daily sexual harassment and abuse. Wallace would swagger down the hallways, smacking female staffers on the butt and snapping their bra straps. He made obscene phone calls to his own secretary.\n\nAccording to Rader, Wallace would grill subordinates, male or female, on their sex lives — did they have sex the night before, whom with, what positions? At a company dinner with staffer Suzanne St. Pierre and her husband, CBS star Eric Sevareid, Wallace remarked upon Pierre’s “snatch.” His favorite pejorative, in and out of the office, was “c—.”\n\nRader also spoke with former colleagues who testified to how much Wallace revelled in publicly reducing staffers to tears. When one of his most loyal producers got word that her husband had been rushed to the hospital, Wallace told her she was “self-indulgent” for leaving work to be with him.\n\nAccording to a famous Rolling Stone exposé, Hewitt himself went so far as to push a woman into a wall and kiss her. He and Wallace managed to evade management — an astonishing feat given that Wallace, Rader writes, continued harassing female staffers at least into his 70s.\n\nAnd yet, to the American public, “60 Minutes” was a bastion of integrity, a weekly calling-to-account of the sleazy and corrupt. As the show increased in ratings, racked up awards and spawned far less accomplished knockoffs (“West 57th,” “Dateline”), the behavior of those holding America’s great and good to account devolved further. Whether they didn’t realize or didn’t care is known only to them.\n\nFor 30 years, Wallace was untouchable. He and Hewitt had perfected the art of the ambush and, in the process, revolutionized the viewing experience, turning it into something almost interactive. Wallace knew what was coming, and so did the audience — gleeful conspirators in toppling tyrants.\n\nWallace, however, was the hero, and he knew it. He still approached the job partly as a role, with its props, sets and romantic intrigue.\n\nRader discovered an unpublished piece Wallace wrote in the 1970s in which he described the life of a broadcast correspondent. You can practically see the fog swirling off the coast at night:\n\n“It is one of the hazards of his craft” — a word pretentiously used by actors, not journalists — “that his family life suffers from neglect . . . he becomes an object of some curiosity to the local ladies, to whom his trench coat beckons as a badge of mystery, which they’d like to plumb.”\n\nAT least he was honest about his home life, which, once again, was falling apart. Neglected and lonely, his wife Lorraine took to anesthetizing herself with Mother’s Little Helpers and daytime drinking. His sons wanted little to do with him — not that they had much choice in the matter — and when his eldest, Peter, went missing during a trip to Greece in 1962, it took about a month for Wallace, his ex-wife and their new spouses to realize he was missing.\n\nWallace immediately hopped a plane to Athens and, ever the journalist, conducted his own investigation. Within hours, Wallace discovered his son’s body, 50 feet below a cliff.\n\nWallace, already prone to melancholy, was never the same. He would go on to suffer at least three bouts of severe clinical depression, one triggered by a lawsuit brought against Wallace by Gen. William Westmoreland in 1984.\n\nWallace was so disconsolate he accepted an assignment in Ethiopia— “Mike hated Third World stories, particularly ones about Africa,” said his producer, Barry Lando.\n\nHis new wife — he’d divorced Lorraine and married a woman named Mary Yates — had to get him dressed and fed in the mornings. On Dec. 30, 1984, Wallace attempted suicide by overdose, and the Westmoreland case was eventually dropped.\n\nIt took Wallace some time to come to grips with his diagnosis of depression — back then, the disease carried real stigma — as well as the changing media landscape. For Wallace, though, they were likely intertwined. His once-lauded form of breaking a story — the hidden cameras, the merciless questioning meant to humiliate the most harmless subjects — was now mocked in the press.\n\nAmong Wallace’s critics: his long-neglected son, Chris, who had gone on to a career as a broadcaster at Fox News and who made public comments about his father having “lost it.”\n\nThe mass viewing audience of the 1980s and 1990s, too, was more sophisticated than ever, and when Wallace aired what may be his most controversial piece — a 1998 profile of Dr. Jack Kevorkian that showed the doctor assisting a suicide — Wallace’s reputation took a hit. In the wake of that broadcast, Kevorkian was tried and sentenced to eight years in jail.\n\nBY now, Wallace himself was 80 years old. For a man who had always defined himself through his work, retirement was never an option. To these men of a certain era and age, it was an ugly proposition, and when his colleague Reasoner was sent off in 1991, dying of cancer, Wallace and the “60 Minutes” crew threw him a bash at “21” and proceeded to be loathsome.\n\n“They treated him like s–t,” said producer Jeffrey Fager. “Mike got up and said something snide. Don got up and said something snide. Morley [Safer] got up and said, ‘Never a noble moment’ . . . Harry could barely walk. He died a month later.”\n\nAs for Wallace, he was eventually forced out in 2006, and now, at 93, lives a life well below the radar — perhaps the ultimate indignity for a man who never truly felt alive unless the ON AIR signal was alight. Ten decades, two memoirs and countless on-air hours later, Wallace remains, to his friends and colleagues, unknown.\n\n“He’s an actor,” said producer Lando. “I think Mike’s core was so deeply hidden and protected. I certainly didn’t get to it. I don’t know if anyone ever did.”"
