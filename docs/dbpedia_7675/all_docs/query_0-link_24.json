        "text": "CBS newsman Mike Wallace was a dogged, merciless reporter and interviewer who took on politicians, celebrities and other public figures in a 60-year career highlighted by the on-air confrontations that helped make \"60 Minutes\" the most successful primetime television news program ever.\n\nMr. Wallace died Saturday night.\n\nUntil he was slowed by heart surgery as he neared his 90th birthday in 2008, Wallace continued making news, doing \"60 Minutes\" interviews with such subjects as Jack Kevorkian and Roger Clemens. He had promised to still do occasional reports when he announced his retirement as a regular correspondent in March 2006.\n\nRECOMMENDED: Sticks and stones: the case for civility in American political discourse\n\nAmong his later contributions, after bowing out as a regular on \"60 Minutes,\" was a May 2007 profile of Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, and an interview with Kevorkian, the assisted suicide doctor released from prison in June 2007.\n\nIn December 2007, Wallace landed the first interview with Clemens after the star pitcher was implicated in the report by former Sen. George Mitchell on performance enhancing drugs in baseball. The interview, in which Clemens maintained his innocence, was broadcast in early January 2008.\n\nWallace's \"extraordinary contribution as a broadcaster is immeasurable and he has been a force within the television industry throughout its existence,\" Leslie Moonves, CBS Corp. president and CEO, said in a statement Sunday.\n\nWallace was the first man hired when late CBS news producer Don Hewitt put together the staff of \"60 Minutes\" at the TV news magazine's inception in 1968. The show wasn't a hit at first, but it worked its way up to the top 10 in the 1977-78 season and remained there, season after season, with Wallace as one of its mainstays. Among other things, it proved there could be big profits in TV journalism.\n\nThe top 10 streak was broken in 2001, in part due to the onset of huge-drawing rated reality shows. But \"60 Minutes\" remained in the top 25 in recent years, ranking 15th in viewers in the 2010-11 season.\n\nThe show pioneered the use of \"ambush interviews,\" with reporter and camera crew corralling alleged wrongdoers in parking lots, hallways, wherever a comment – or at least a stricken expression – might be harvested from someone dodging the reporters' phone calls.\n\nSuch tactics were phased out over time – Wallace said they provided drama but not much good information.\n\nAnd his style never was all about surprise, anyway. Wallace was a master of the skeptical follow-up question, coaxing his prey with a \"forgive me, but ...\" or a simple, \"come on.\" He was known as one who did his homework, spending hours preparing for interviews, and alongside the exposes, \"60 Minutes\" featured insightful talks with celebrities and world leaders.\n\nHe was equally tough on public and private behavior. In 1973, with the Watergate scandal growing, he sat with top Nixon aide John Ehrlichman and read a long list of alleged crimes, from money laundering to obstructing justice. \"All of this, Wallace noted, \"by the law and order administration of Richard Nixon.\"\n\nThe surly Ehrlichman could only respond: \"Is there a question in there somewhere?\"\n\nWallace said he didn't think he had an unfair advantage over his interview subjects: \"The person I'm interviewing has not been subpoenaed. He's in charge of himself, and he lives with his subject matter every day. All I'm armed with is research.\"\n\nWallace himself became a dramatic character in several projects, from the stage version of \"Frost/Nixon,\" when he was played by Stephen Rowe, to the 1999 film \"The Insider,\" based in part on a 1995 \"60 Minutes\" story about tobacco industry whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand, who accused Brown & Williamson of intentionally adding nicotine to cigarettes. Christopher Plummer starred as Wallace and Russell Crowe as Wigand. Wallace was unhappy with the film, in which he was portrayed as caving to pressure to kill a story about Wigand.\n\nOperating on a tip, The New York Times reported that \"60 Minutes\" planned to excise Wigand's interview from its tobacco expose. CBS said Wigand had signed a nondisclosure agreement with his former company, and the network feared that by airing what he had to say, \"60 Minutes\" could be sued along with him.\n\nThe day the Times story appeared, Wallace downplayed the gutted story as \"a momentary setback.\" He soon sharpened his tone. Leading into the revised report when it aired, he made no bones that \"we cannot broadcast what critical information about tobacco, addiction and public health (Wigand) might be able to offer.\" Then, in a \"personal note,\" he told viewers that he and his \"60 Minutes\" colleagues were \"dismayed that the management at CBS had seen fit to give in to perceived threats of legal action.\"\n\nThe full report eventually was broadcast.\n\nWallace maintained a hectic pace after CBS waived its long-standing rule requiring broadcasters to retire at 65. In early 1999, at age 80, he added another line to his resume by appearing on the network's spinoff, \"60 Minutes II.\"\n\nWallace amassed 21 Emmy awards during his career, as well as five DuPont-Columbia journalism and five Peabody awards.\n\nIn all, his television career spanned six decades, much of it spent at CBS. In 1949, he appeared as Myron Wallace in a show called \"Majority Rules.\" In the early 1950s, he was an announcer and game show host for programs such as \"What's in a Word?\" He also found time to act in a 1954 Broadway play, \"Reclining Figure,\" directed by Abe Burrows.\n\nIn the mid-1950s came his smoke-wreathed \"Night Beat,\" a series of one-on-one interviews with everyone from an elderly Frank Lloyd Wright to a young Henry Kissinger that began on local TV in New York and then appeared on the ABC network. It was the show that first brought Wallace fame as a hard-boiled interviewer, a \"Mike Malice\" who rarely gave his subjects any slack.\n\nWallace had a short stint reporting from Vietnam, and took a sock in the jaw while covering the tumultuous 1968 Democratic Party convention in Chicago. But he didn't fit the stereotype of the Eastern liberal journalist. He was a close friend of the Reagans and was once offered the job of Richard Nixon's press secretary. He called his politics moderate."
