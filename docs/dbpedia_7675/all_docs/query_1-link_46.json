        "text": "Bankruptcy Attorney For Debt Relief Solutions\n\nIt’s your legal right to be free.\n\nTalk With Mike\n\nTalk with the attorney whose own story says, \"There really is life after bankruptcy.\"\n\nAre you dealing with unmanageable debt?\n\nIf you in over your head with debt, you are probably overwhelmed, exhausted, and anxious about the future. You have likely been suffering under the all-encompassing weight of your debt, as well as the impact of invasive, intrusive collections actions, for some time. These collections actions can be absolutely brutal, and can make you feel hounded and hopeless. Trust us, we know from experience.\n\nThe good news is that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel in the form of bankruptcy. Contrary to popular belief, bankruptcy is not a financial death sentence, nor is it shameful or life-ruining in any way. Rather, bankruptcy is a financial tool that is designed and intended to be used by people who have accumulated an unmanageable amount of debt and need a financial fresh start.\n\nIf you have accumulated debt you can’t handle, you are absolutely not alone. There are many reasons why Americans in 2022 find themselves with snowballing debt—often through no fault of their own. If you, like most Americans, live paycheck to paycheck, one large emergency expense like a medical bill or a car repair is enough to put you into the red. And if you, like most Americans, still have a life to live and a family to support despite having depleted funds, you will likely find yourself having to take on debt to survive.\n\nBankruptcy is a legitimate way for hardworking Americans to get out from under the oppressive yolk of debt. It is available for people to use because there is a real and valid need for it, like any other financial tool. If you are considering filing bankruptcy, know that there are over 1.5 million people in the US that also make use of this same financial tool every year.\n\nWith Bankruptcy Attorney Mike Wallace,\n\nYou Can Finally Say Goodbye to…\n\nRelentless Bill Collectors\n\nStacks Of Unpaid Bills\n\nMaxed Out Credit Cards\n\nPlummeting Credit Score\n\nWhy Bankruptcy? Are There Better Options?\n\nBlank\n\nBankruptcy Gives You Protection\n\nWhen dealing with creditors, you don’t want to be unprotected and “go-it-alone”. Creditors can easily file suit against you and use many other tactics to get what you owe them. Bankruptcy is your legal right and is safer overall.\n\nBankruptcy Is Not Unforgivable\n\nThe word on the street is that bankruptcy is “the unpardonable sin”. Nothing could be further from the truth. I know you have many concerns and we are happy to discuss them all with you through our free consultation.\n\nBankruptcy is better than debt consolidation\n\nMany people choose to consolidate their debt and make large payments while their credit continually drops. With bankruptcy, your credit does take an initial hit but continues to rise from the moment your debts are discharged.\n\nBankruptcy Will Most Likely Increase Your Credit Score\n\nWe find on average a typical bankruptcy client’s FICO score will increase around 100 points twelve months after discharge.\n\nAbout Mike Wallace\n\nBankruptcy Attorney\n\nMike was born and raised in Tyler, TX.

Mr. Wallace explained everything very thoroughly and answered ALL the questions I had. He did not rush thru the counseling. I filed the chapter 7 using Mr. Wallace’s services. I am more than impressed by his knowledge of the subject matter. He made a process that was very nerve-racking for me actually very easy. He also took the time to give me some personal advice on financial issues. I am very thankful for Mr. Wallace’s help in this hard part of my life. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND him to anyone who is contemplating filing bankruptcy.”\n\n“I would like to introduce you to Mike Wallace. He is a personal friend, a Brother in Christ. I filed bankruptcy in 2009 and already feeling like I had failed. The Lord knew I needed a man like Mike to support and encourage me through the process.

It is usually most helpful for people who have a guaranteed way to pay for future installments with their income,\n\nI Am Here To Help You…\n\nFinish Strong.\n\nIt’s not always how you start but how you finish, with the right tools you can turn your financial life around.\n\nInvest Well.\n\nWhen you’re not burdened with financial issues you can spend money on the projects or ministries that you care about.\n\nLeave a Legacy.\n\nExecution of the knowledge that leads to long-term financial health can help you change your life and impact future generations.\n\nAttorney Mike Wallace Can Help\n\nAttorney Mike Wallace is an experienced, knowledgeable bankruptcy attorney who is proud to serve the Tyler, Nacogdoches, Jacksonville, Longview, and Greater East Texas communities.
