        "text": "Edward Michael “Mike” Wallace, 77, died peacefully at home surrounded by his family on Sunday February 20, 2022 due to complications of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). Private services will be held at a later date with internment at Greenmount Cemetery in Durango, Colorado. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be directed in his name at the CURE PSP FOUNDATION at www.psp.org. Mike was born near Creston, Iowa on August 28, 1944, the son of the late Edward and Mary Helen (Higgins) Wallace. As a youth he was very active in 4H and farm life in old Spaulding Township, Union County, Iowa. He graduated from Creston High School in 1962. He graduated from the University of Iowa School of Business in 1967. He later earned his juris doctorate from the University of Iowa School of Law in 1971. On April 3,1976 Mike married Mary Ann James in Taos, New Mexico. They were married 45 years and were blessed with two sons (Ed and Joe) and five grandchildren (Jack, Tate, Annie, William, and Matthew). Mike spent his entire professional career as an attorney and municipal court judge and was known as a skilled yet compassionate jurist. He began his career in private practice in Durango, Colorado in 1971 before becoming a municipal court judge and eventually serving as the District Attorney in Southwest Colorado from 1980-1984 covering La Plata, San Juan, and Archuleta counties. In 1984 Mike and his family moved to Iowa City, Iowa when he was appointed as an area prosecutor for the Iowa Attorney General’s Office. From 1991 to 2001 Mike served as a prosecutor and child support recovery attorney in Clinton County and Linn County, Iowa. In 2001, Mike and Mary Ann moved to Las Cruces, Mexico where they enjoyed the best the southwest has to offer in food, scenery, and weather. Mike served as a Senior Trial Prosecutor and favorite mentor to many attorneys in the Dona Ana County District Attorney’s office. Mike was a proud Irishman who later in life acquired his Irish citizenship. He was an avid fan and supporter of Iowa City Regina High School, University of Iowa Hawkeye athletics, and the Chicago Cubs. Mike was an early RAGBRAI bicycle rider in the 1970’s and rode in his last RAGBRAI in 2004 with his sons by his side. In retirement Mike and Mary Ann enjoyed spending time with their grandchildren in Iowa and Michigan and RV camping throughout the United States. Survivors include his loving wife, Mary Ann; their children, Ed (Jen) Wallace of Iowa City, Iowa and Joe (Destiny) Wallace of Portage, Michigan; grandchildren, Jack and Tate Wallace, Anne, William, and Matthew Wallace; five siblings; Julie (Coy) Craig, Steve (Barbara) Wallace, Martha Wallace, Jerry (Sandy) Wallace, and Mary (Tim) Benton."
