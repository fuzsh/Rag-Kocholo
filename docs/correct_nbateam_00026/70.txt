SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Carlos Boozer of the Utah Jazz in the National Basketball Association says he doesn't expect any hard feelings from his former Cleveland Cavaliers teammates when he sees them on the court.

Boozer on Saturday for the first time will face the team that drafted him.

He played in Cleveland for two years before signing a 68 (m) million dollar deal with the Jazz.

Boozer is a graduate of Juneau-Douglas High School, where he led the Crimson Bears to two state championships.

After graduation, he played at Duke University.

When he signed his deal with Utah, the Cleveland front office accused him backing out of a verbal commitment to continue playing for the Cavs.

Boozer maintains there was never any such agreement and that his former teammates never resented his leaving.

He says they understand it was a business decision and as soon as it happened, they were the first to congratulate him.
