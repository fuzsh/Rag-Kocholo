        "text": "ANAHEIM – Karl Malone is not always an easy guy to track down. With various hunting and fishing expeditions, trips to his second home on Alaska’s Kenai River and a preference to emerge in public only when it suits him, he has a tendency to go off the grid.\n\nIf you want to talk to Malone, he needs to want to talk to you.\n\nIn 2004, shortly after Malone retired from his one-year stint with the Lakers, he asked Mark McKown, the Utah Jazz strength coach, for the phone number for the young power forward the team had signed in the offseason.\n\nMalone wanted to talk to the guy the Jazz had brought in to fill his shoes. The Mailman thought he could help Carlos Boozer.\n\n“That’s Mail,” said Boozer, who on Thursday scored tallied 17 points and three rebounds in a 119-86 loss to the Jazz, the first of two games this week against his former team.\n\nWhat unfolded in Utah was a mentor-student relationship similar to the one the Lakers are hoping will develop between Boozer, whom they acquired in the offseason, and rookie Julius Randle, the No. 7 overall pick in June’s draft.\n\n“For me it was cool that it was the Mailman,” Boozer said, “and I’m talking to him every day about how to get better, teaching me about different moves and different things that can contribute to make me successful.”\n\nMalone, who trails only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the NBA’s career scoring list, invited Boozer to his home on the hill above Salt Lake City and the two talked not just about basketball, Boozer said, but an array of issues that were relevant to a young player in a new town.\n\n“That’s the great thing about Mailman,” said Boozer, who in 12 years has career averages of 16.6 points and 9.8 rebounds. “Everything I was going through in Utah he already went through it. … And that’s why it was so monumental for me because he was there at a moment where I really needed direction in different ways in my life and he was there for it.”\n\nIn Boozer, the Lakers do not have a legend of Malone’s caliber. He is a two-time All-Star not destined for the Hall of Fame like Malone, but one whose career took a nosedive after he left the Jazz for the Chicago Bulls in 2010.\n\nThe Lakers acquired Boozer via an amnesty waiver claim in July after the Bulls decided to part ways with the 32-year-old. The team didn’t expect to land his services with a bid of $3.2 million in a blind auction, but when they did, it changed their plans for Randle.\n\nPreviously penciled in to start right away, the 19-year-old who played his one season of college basketball at Kentucky suddenly had a veteran to study while learning about the NBA.\n\n“There’s all those little things that help you become a better player,” said Phil Johnson, the former Jazz assistant who served as Jerry Sloan’s right-hand man. “Just how you approach the game, how you approach getting ready for the game.”\n\nLakers general manager Mitch Kupchak said acquiring a mentor for Randle was a “secondary factor” in bidding on Boozer. The Lakers saw a chance to add a third veteran along with Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash, and thought if those two could stay healthy, it could elevate Boozer’s game.\n\nBut in practices, Kupchak has observed the work Boozer and Randle have put in, and believes it could pay off long beyond Boozer’s tenure with the team.\n\n“They’re fun to watch,” Kupchak said. “They’re both bruisers. Julius won’t back down and Carlos obviously has been through the wars.”\n\nBoozer calls Randle “very astute,” and can be seen at practice working on moves encouraging Randle and, when scrimmages pause, talking him through what he may have just done right or wrong.\n\nBut the biggest thing he’s learned from Boozer, Randle said, “is how to be professional every day, how he carries himself, the work he puts in.”\n\nThat’s where Johnson, the longtime Jazz assistant, said he could see Boozer having the biggest impact.\n\n“Karl didn’t do a whole bunch of talking when he was there,” Johnson said, “but his influence was there because he worked very hard, and Carlos has a lot of that in him, too.\n\n“I think that he (Randle) will learn stuff just by watching him get ready to play the game, day in, day out how he handles himself.”\n\nBoozer is following in Malone’s footsteps once again, although under different circumstances: He finds himself playing for the Lakers at the end of his career. Whereas Malone was chasing the championship that eluded him during 18 seasons with the Jazz, Boozer is trying to put together a season that will earn him another contract when he becomes a free agent this summer.\n\n“He definitely has dual roles right now,” Lakers coach Byron Scott said, “and I think he looks at it that way: ‘I can still play and help the team, but I’ve got this young guy behind me that I’ve got to help develop as well.’”\n\nThe Mailman did his part. Now the Lakers are waiting to see if Boozer can deliver.\n\nNOTES\n\nSteve Nash was a late scratch from Thursday’s game at Honda Center after telling Scott he wanted to play. He had missed three straight practices and tweaked his back on Wednesday. … Kobe Bryant scored a preseason-high 27 points, but was just 10-of-23 from the field. He added five rebounds, four assists and a steal. … The Lakers fell to 1-3 in the preseason, and have lost three straight by an average of 29.6 points."
