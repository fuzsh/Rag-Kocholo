He coached setter Ella Snyder in 2021 to a team-high 1,029 assists, the most by a single Sun Devil since 2014.\n\nThe 2020-21 Sun Devil Volleyball season was unlike any that has been played before with competition starting in January rather than in the fall. In his fourth season, Moreno and the Sun Devils went 6-14 and finished in ninth place in the conference with a roster made up of primarily underclassmen (82 percent). Arizona State earned two wins over ranked opponents, opening the season with a win at No. 8 Washington and beating No. 16 Oregon in Tempe towards the end of the season.\n\nMoreno made a large impact on the program for the 2019 season. The team registered a 17-14 overall record, 9-11 in the Pac-12. It was the teams best finish since the 2015 season. ASU managed sweeps over Arizona, Oregon, and Oregon State.\n\nIn the 2018 season, Moreno helped the team improve immensely from the 2017 season. They earned five more conference wins and was ranked in the AVCA Coaches Poll for the first time since 2015. They also had three wins over top-15 teams.\n\nOn July 15, 2018, Arizona State head volleyball coach Sanja Tomasevic announced the promotion of Moreno to associate head coach. He had served a brief stint as interim head coach in the latter part of the 2017 season.\n\nTomasevic announced on February 2, 2017, that Carlos Moreno would join the coaching staff as an assistant coach. Moreno joined the Sun Devils after previously serving as a graduate assistant under the direction of Amanda Berkley at Southern Mississippi University. During his one-year tenure at Southern Miss, Moreno operated in a number of facets including on-court coaching, recruiting, fundraising, and compliance. Moreno most notably worked extensively with the team's offensive systems and setters, including All-Conference honoree Sarah Bell.\n\nPrior to his stint at Southern Miss, Moreno garnered coaching experience directing camps and clinics in his native country of Brazil, while also serving as the head coach of the University of Sao Paulo Women's Volleyball Team from 2000 to 2002.\n\nPreceding his coaching career, Moreno compiled a prolific playing career as a setter at Brigham University, garnering essentially every national award possible, including AVCA and MPSF Player of the year honors. A three-year starter for the Cougars, Moreno amassed 4,628 career assists, marking the second-most in program in history, while adding 78 career aces (4th-most in program history). Spearheading BYU NCAA Championship runs in 2003 and 2004, Moreno earned a plethora of Player of the Year and MVP honors while also being placed on MSPF's and AVCA's respective first-teams.\n\nA two-time All-American and the 2004 AVCA National Player of the Year, Moreno led the Cougars to two NCAA tournament appearances, including the 2004 National Championship, and a pair of MPSF Conference titles.\n\nCOLLEGE CAREER ACCOLADES:\n\nNCAA National Champion and MVP (2004)\n\nNCAA All Tournament Team (2004)\n\nAVCA NCAA player of the year (2004)\n\nConference player of the year and MVP (2004)\n\nAll American First Team (2003/04)\n\nMoreno earned a bachelor degree in advertising and marketing at Brigham Young University in 2005 and is currently finishing his master's degree in Exercise Sciences.\n\nMoreno's playing career extended beyond the collegiate ranks, as the Brazil native competed 11 years professionally, concluding his career as a captain of TLM - Volley in France. Moreno was named to two all-star games and was named as one of the best setters at the 2013 CEV Champions League. He won three league championships, one in Brazil, two in France and another one at the European Championships when playing in Slovenia.\n\nThe son of Antonio and Selma Moreno, Moreno is the oldest sibling of six children. Antonio Moreno participated in four Olympics as a member of the Brazilian National volleyball team. Moreno's twin sister Anna Allison was the head coach of Bucknell University volleyball team for seven seasons.\n\nCarlos, his wife Maria Eduarda and their son Lucas and daughter Liz currently reside in Tempe, Arizona."
