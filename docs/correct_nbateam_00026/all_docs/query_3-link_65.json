        "text": "Ze Min Xiao founded the Center for Economic Opportunity and Belonging and serves as its president and CEO. The Center envisions a Utah in which all residents experience a sense of belonging and equal opportunity so they can contribute their best selves to the growth and enhancement of the economic, social, and political life of the state.\n\nThe Center achieves this vision by identifying and promoting actionable solutions to disparities through engagement with communities and by catalyzing private, philanthropic, and public partnerships. The Center is rooted in the belief that transformational change requires individuals closest to the problem to become active participants in identifying, implementing, and evaluating effective solutions.\n\nBefore founding the Center, Ms. Xiao had a 13-year career with Salt Lake County. As the director of the Mayor’s Office for New Americans, she guided immigrant and refugee integration strategies on the local, state, and national levels. Under her leadership, Salt Lake County became a national leader in the Welcoming and Belongings movement. It was awarded the distinction as the first county in the nation to achieve Welcoming Certification.\n\nMs. Xiao is a graduate of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation’s Community Leadership Fellowship in 2022. She is a member of the 2023 German Marshall Fund Memorial Fellowship.\n\nMs. Xiao is an avid traveler and an adventurous eater, a combination that has afforded her opportunities to immerse in cultures from around the world.\n\nAmram Musungu is a Kenyan-born, well-respected figure in our community, known for his dedication to service, politics, and family. He is a passionate volunteer, a committed civic servant, a loving husband, and a devoted father.\n\nAmram currently enjoys working as an IT auditor with his colleagues at Tanner Accountants & Advisors, Utah’s largest public accounting firm.

He has served several years as a member of the GOP State Central Committee and ran as a candidate for president in 2018 in Kenya. Amram is known for his unwavering commitment to conservative values and his tireless work to make a real positive impact on the lives of people.\n\nAmram's love of music led him to become a member of the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square, where he sang for twelve years. He is known for his beautiful second base voice and dedication to the art of music.\n\nAmram taught Swahili language as an adjunct professor at the Brigham Young University School of Languages in Provo, Utah for eight years. He helps with Swahili language translations for the Department of Defense when needed. He is a board member for the Columbus Adults Education Center in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nAmram co-wrote his critically acclaimed memoir, \"Bridge of Miracles,\" which has been praised for its uplifting and inspiring message and has touched the hearts of readers around the world. His book won several awards, including the Illumination Book Award in 2023.\n\nIn addition to his many accomplishments, Amram holds undergraduate and Master of Accounting degrees from Westminster University and a Master of Science in Cybersecurity & Information Assurance from Southern Utah University.\n\nAmram’s commitment to education and community service has been recognized many times over the years: he has been honored with the 2005 Distinguished Alumni Award from Ensign College; the 2010 Utah Women’s Alliance Award; the 2016 Graduate Outstanding Award at Ensign College, the 2023 AFRO Political Leadership Award.\n\nServing his community, state, and fellow citizens are hallmarks of the life of Robert M. Graham. His commitment to excellence in higher education throughout Utah has been unwavering, including significant contributions in both service and financial support enabling students to reach their educational goals.\n\nBorn in 1930 in the small central Utah town of Mt. Pleasant, Bob’s father died when he was only five years old. He grew up in humble beginnings, raised by his mother—a first-grade schoolteacher—and learned the value of education, hard work, and commitment to others at a very young age.\n\nA native son of Sanpete County, Bob graduated from Snow College in 1950. As he tells it, his real success at Snow was meeting his future wife, Joyce Sorensen, with whom he would share a \"perfect\" marriage. Their 60 years together were enriched by community and church service, extensive travel worldwide, and three daughters and their families, which now include eleven grandchildren and nineteen great-grandchildren. A cancer survivor, Joyce passed away in 2013 after facing remaining health challenges for many years.\n\nAfter earning his associate degree, serving a mission for his church, and serving in the military, Bob again focused on his education, earning a bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University and a law degree from the University of Utah. With those qualifications in hand, he would go on to a successful 28-year career as a tax partner with Haskins & Sells (now Deloitte), beginning in San Francisco and later in Salt Lake City. In both communities, Bob became a trusted tax advisor to civic and business leaders alike, including First Security Corporation CEO George S. Eccles. In the late 1980s, at the encouragement of Mr. Eccles, Bob joined the law firm of Ray, Quinney & Nebeker, as well as the George S. and Dolores Doré Eccles Foundation. He was named to the Foundation's Board of Directors in 1998, and he continues to play a key role in its financial management and grant-making programs in his position as Secretary, Treasurer & General Counsel. Bob is also a board member of the Nora Eccles Treadwell Foundation and the Florence J. Gillmor Foundation.\n\nThroughout his career, Bob has served on several advisory and civic boards at the University of Utah, American Indian Services, Deseret Book, Primary Children's Hospital, Manti Heritage Gardens, Utah Legal Aid, Friends for Sight, the Governor's Tax Revenue Commission, and the Salt Lake Rotary Club, where he served a term as president.\n\nDuring a career that now spans more than six decades, Bob has maintained a personal commitment to helping individuals of all ages gain the lifelong benefits of higher education. He’s been an inspiration for so many to make education and community service a priority, as shown through his honorary degrees from Westminster College (University) and Snow College.\n\nThe Robert M. and Joyce S. Graham Science Building at Snow College was dedicated in 2017 in honor of Bob and his late wife, recognizing their outstanding achievements and contributions to education in Utah. The amphitheater at the Pioneer Heritage Gardens in Manti, Utah was also dedicated in their honor in 2012, and the Mt. Pleasant Public Library, a historic \"Carnegie Library,\" was also re-dedicated in Bob's honor in 2011 in recognition of his support of its renovation to better serve the citizens of Sanpete County, Utah.\n\nThe impactful legacy of Robert M. Graham will continue to enrich the state of Utah and its citizens, inspired by his commitment to ensuring excellence in education for all.\n\nAngie Johnson Thomsic's journey to becoming a student-athlete and dedicated player for the Westminster Griffins volleyball team is a testament to her resilience, passion for sports, and the transformative power of mentorship.\n\nGrowing up blocks away from Westminster University, Angie remembers riding her bike on the dirt football field and playing in the campus stream. The youngest of three, she developed a love for horseback riding, fort-building, skiing, and the outdoors.\n\nAngie's introduction to organized sports came through her father, Steve, who coached her in the Junior Jazz youth basketball league. Despite starting as the underdogs, the team's determination led them to the playoffs, sparking Angie's love for sports and competition.\n\nAngie attended Highland High School and thought she would follow in her brother's basketball footsteps. However, a fateful suggestion from her best friend led her to volleyball, where she excelled quickly and continued playing year-round in the club circuit. Coach Kim Norman, her greatest advocate, played a crucial role in shaping Angie's work ethic and dedication to the game.\n\nAngie's standout performance in high school attracted college scouts, earning her a full-ride scholarship to Eastern Washington University. Despite experiencing Division I life, Angie missed home. A twist of fate reconnected her with Coach Norman, now at Westminster, and Angie secured a spot on the Westminster Griffins volleyball team.\n\nUpon joining the Westminster team, Angie led a remarkable turnaround, elevating the squad's record from 1-20 to an impressive 12-2 and securing the conference tournament for the first time in the school's history. In her second season, Angie's stellar performance earned her a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics All-American Honorable Mention and the title of Frontier Conference Player of the Year. Her athletic journey stands as a testament to mentorship and pursuing passion against all odds.\n\nAfter earning her degree in business marketing, Angie relocated to Denver, where she met her husband, Michael. Celebrating their 10th anniversary in August, Angie adeptly juggles a thriving career in residential real estate while nurturing her 4-year-old twins, Asher and Fredrick, and 19-month-old Enzo.\n\nIan Gunderson was born in Salt Lake City, UT and raised in the Cottonwood Heights area. At age six, Ian was registered for the American Youth Soccer Organization. Through this program, Ian quickly developed his foundational soccer skills. In middle school, Ian moved up to competitive soccer and loved the challenges that competition offered. In his freshman year at Brighton High School, he made the Varsity Men's Soccer Team. He continued to play varsity soccer throughout high school, and his team won the 4A State Soccer Championship in 1989. He was named the first State Soccer Champion in his school’s history. In the winter of 1990, Coach Chris Dorich recruited Ian to attend and play soccer for Westminster.\n\nIan's soccer career at Westminster began with him playing center midfielder during his freshman year. He achieved six goals and four assists and made All-Conference for the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference in his first year. In his sophomore year, he transitioned to playing in the forward position, earning his team sixteen goals and four assists. Ian also made 1st Team All-Far West All-American and led the conference in scoring that year.\n\nIan’s junior year continued his pathway of success, achieving sixteen goals and four assists. Unfortunately, Ian tore his ACL and missed the last four games of the season. Despite his injury, Ian still made 2nd Team All-Far West All-American and received an Honorable Mention for the All-American Team. In Ian's final year at Westminster, he had recovered from his ACL surgery and fell back into his usual routine of helping his team win. He achieved fourteen goals and two assists in his senior year. Ian led the conference in scoring and made 2nd team All-Far West and 1st Team All-Conference.\n\nAfter his time playing for Westminster, Ian played International for the Utah Soccer Association from 1994 to 2004. This was a special time for Ian, as several of his teams were made up of mostly Westminster soccer alumni. From 1995 to 2005, Ian and his teammates were named Team of the Decade for the Utah Soccer Association. In 1995, Ian earned his C License from the United States Soccer Federation and coached the Firebirds SC in Salt Lake City, UT from 1995 to 1998. He also had the pleasure of coaching men’s soccer with his late brother for one year at Cottonwood High School in Salt Lake City, UT.\n\nIan took a break from soccer in 2004 and ventured into his other passions for seven years. In 2011, Ian returned to soccer as a player, and then eventually as a head coach for BlakPijeon FC of the Utah Soccer Association until 2021. Since 2018, Ian has been working in instrument manufacturing for bioMérieux and spending his time playing golf, traveling, and just enjoying life."
