        "text": "The Jazz are apparently seeking a king’s ransom for star power forward Lauri Markkanen as trade speculation continues.\n\nWith rumors swirling around the Warriors and the 2023 NBA All-Star, The Athletic’s Shams Charania reported Monday that Utah has its eyes on Golden State’s “bulk of young talent and capital,” notably Moses Moody, Jonathan Kuminga and Brandin Podziemski, as well as picks, “which has been a non-starter” for the franchise.\n\nGolden State, which bid farewell to franchise stalwart Klay Thompson earlier this month, is said to “have been the most engaged team” for Markkanen’s services in recent weeks, according to the report.\n\nThe proposition discussed has been centered on Moody, multiple pick swaps, first-round picks and second-round picks.\n\nMarkkanen is entering the final year of his contract with the Jazz, who are in the midst of a rebuild.\n\nThe Athletic reported that Utah is open to hearing trade offers and is also “maintaining interest in keeping [Markkanen] as a franchise centerpiece.”\n\nAlthough Markkanen, 27, is eligible for a contract extension next month, The Athletic reported that should he sign on the first day of eligibility, Aug. 6, he could be moved next season.\n\nShould an extension be signed afterward, he would not be “tradeable.”\n\nMarkkanen averaged 23.2 points per game last season, along with 8.2 rebounds on 39.9 percent from the 3-point range.\n\nGolden State seems like a natural fit for Markkanen, the NBA’s Most Improved Player in 2023, as the Warriors enter the post-Thompson era.\n\nThompson, a four-time NBA champion with the Warriors, agreed to a three-year, $50 million deal with the Mavericks in free agency.\n\nGolden State previously set its sights on Paul George this offseason, but the nine-time All-Star agreed to join the Sixers instead on a four-year, $212 million contract."
