        "text": "Early foul trouble for all-American forward Jaedon LeDee and their hottest perimeter player? Miss six of their first eight free throws? No baskets for 6½ minutes in the first half? Give up a 17-1 run? Go down 17?\n\nHad ’em right where they wanted ’em.\n\nThe kings of counterintuitive basketball struck again, playing rope-a-dope for the opening 13 minutes of the Mountain West semifinals Friday night at UNLV’s Thomas & Mack Center before roaring past top-seeded and 18th-ranked Utah State 86-70 in another vintage March performance.\n\nScore over the final 27 minutes: 69-36.\n\nThat puts the fifth-seeded San Diego State (24-9) into the championship game for the seventh straight year, 10th in the last 11 and 14th in the last 16. Tip-off is at 3 p.m. Saturday on CBS.\n\n“This team has always had great resolve,” coach Brian Dutcher said. “It’s got a great grit about it. And we get down 17 in the first half, we don’t panic. We just fight our way back, fight, fight, fight.”\n\nOr as LeDee told CBS Sports Network afterward: “We’ve been in this March Madness thing before. You know, we’re easy in the storm.”\n\nThe Aztecs will play sixth-seeded New Mexico, which beat Colorado State 74-61 in the late semifinal that didn’t begin until after 9 p.m. The Aztecs will have a big advantage in rest, playing the early semi and playing one fewer game (only the top five seeds get first-round byes). The Lobos (25-9) will be playing their fourth game in less than 70 hours.\n\nThey’ll also have an even more precious commodity: confidence.\n\nThe Mountain West’s worst shooting team caught fire in the second half, opening 7 of 9 overall and 5 of 6 behind the 3-point arc. And when Utah State (27-6) started fouling just inside three minutes to go – no doubt watching the parade of clanked free throws the day before in a nervy quarterfinal win against UNLV– the Aztecs calmly stepped up and made them.\n\nMicah Parrish was 0 of 8 on Thursday (and missed a pair of free throws with 14 seconds left in regulation). He made his first four shots and finished with 15 points, seven rebounds and two steals.\n\nReese Waters? He was 1 of 7 against UNLV. He had 11 points and three huge offensive rebounds.\n\nLamont Butler? He had missed 17 of his last 21 attempts behind the arc. He went 3 of 5, including back-to-back 3s to trigger a second-half run, and had 16 points while holding Aggies guard Darius Brown II to eight points on 3 of 11 shooting.\n\nDutcher called it. The night before, he predicted they’d have big games. “I’m convinced of it,” he said.\n\n“My performances the last couple of months, since the beginning of the year, haven’t been up to my standard,” Parrish said. “I know I had to break out soon. I know I put the work in. I work every day on my shot, so I knew one day it was going to come. I guess today it came.”\n\nUtah State coach Danny Sprinkle saw it coming, too.\n\n“I was concerned before the game with Micah Parrish and Reese Waters, because they’re really, really good scorers,” Sprinkle said. “They were due to break out at some point. Like, they’re too talented of scorers to play how they kind of have been playing. Both of those guys were terrific today.”\n\nThat proved the difference on a night when the showdown between the media and coaches’ players of the year, LeDee and Great Osobor, was largely a draw. LeDee had 22 points and eight rebounds before fouling out with 2:03 left. Osobor had 19 and 5 in six more minutes.\n\nOsobor’s supporting cast: 33 percent shooting overall and 5 of 20 on 3s.\n\nSpinkle’s other concern was with something less tangible.\n\n“I want to give San Diego State credit,” said Sprinkle, whose team was outrebounded 43-25 and surrendered 14 offensive boards. “They were the tougher team, the more physical team. They kind of brought the fight, and we didn’t respond at times. That’s what San Diego State does to people. We didn’t box out at the free-throw line. When we did get it, they just took it from us.\n\n“When it’s March, you have to put your big-boy pants on, man. It’s go time. We had a couple of guys that did not do that today.”\n\nWhat the Aztecs did not do (again) is start well.\n\nFor the, yes, 12th time in the last 13 games, they trailed after five minutes. After 13 minutes they were down 34-17, and Dutcher had become so desperate that both LeDee and Parrish were back on the floor with two fouls.\n\nLeDee got his second on an off-ball whistle less than four minutes into the game. Parrish got his second for allegedly fouling Ian Martinez on a 3-point attempt when replays showed Martinez kicked out his right leg.\n\nPlaying guys with two fouls in the first half might seem normal at many programs, but not in this one. Dutcher entered the game ranked 337th in Division I in two-foul participation at a mere 6.2 percent. He insists it’s a case-by-case decision, and he won’t risk guys getting a third unless circumstances are dire.\n\nCircumstances were dire.\n\n“The (assistant) coaches asked me did I want to put Micah back in?” Dutcher said. “I said, ‘Yes.’ They figured, well, I was getting soft. They said: ‘How about Jaedon?’ I said, ‘Put him in, too.’”\n\nThen Osobor got his second foul.\n\nIt was a different calculus for Sprinkle, who, like Dutcher, rarely plays guys with two fouls. They were still up 15. There were only six minutes left in the half. He kept Osobor on the bench.\n\nDutcher: “We caught a break.”\n\nA 15-2 run got them back in it. Then 5-10 Darrion Trammell worked his late first-half magic, hitting a step-back 3 over 6-5 Josh Uduje at the buzzer to trim what was a 17-point deficit to 39-36.\n\nIt was the seventh time he’s scored in the final seconds of the first half this season and the second time in two days. Against UNLV, he intercepted an inbounds pass and hit a one-legged 3 to cut the deficit to five at intermission and rejuvenate a comatose team.\n\nSame deal, same effect.\n\nThe Aztecs scored 43 in the second half Thursday. They had 50 Friday, their most in a half against a Div. I opponent in 65 games. Their overall offensive efficiency, according to the Kenpom metric, was their highest of the season (and that includes a dismal opening 13 minutes).\n\nBut it’s the Aztecs. It’s March. That glint has returned to their eyes.\n\n“This past recent couple of weeks, we haven’t been able to get over the hump,” Parrish said of a string of losses in close games that ended with Thursday’s comeback win against UNLV. “So it’s nice to finally get over the hump again and know what it feels like to finish games. That’s going to help us in the future.”\n\nNotable\n\nDutcher has a .609 winning percentage against teams ranked in the Associated Press poll in his seven seasons as head coach, best in the nation among those with at least 20 games. Next on the list are Kansas (.602), Virginia (.591), Duke (.588) and Gonzaga (.587) … Utah State freshman Mason Falslev started after sitting out Thursday’s quarterfinal win against Fresno State with a shoulder injury. He had six points in 20 minutes … A veteran Mountain West officiating crew worked the game: Randy McCall, Eric Curry and Deron White … The 17-point deficit is the sixth largest comeback in a victory since 1996-97 and the largest since coming from 19 down to beat CSUN on Jan. 1, 2019 … SDSU is now 3-0 as the 5 seed against the top seed in the Mountain West tournament."
