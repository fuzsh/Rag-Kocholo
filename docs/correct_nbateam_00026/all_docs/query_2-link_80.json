        "text": "Kings summer league coach Doug Christie was none too pleased with his team’s performance in its Las Vegas Summer League opener against the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nHe was much happier with what he saw in Monday’s game against the Utah Jazz.\n\nColby Jones had 25 points, six rebounds and three steals to lead the Kings to an 82-70 victory over the Jazz at Cox Pavilion on the campus of UNLV.\n\nDrew Timme had 19 points, five rebounds and four assists for the Kings (1-1). Mason Jones added 13 points, nine assists and four steals.\n\nCody Williams score 14 points for the Jazz (1-1). Kyle Filipowski had 13 points and five rebounds.\n\nSacramento got off to a much better start after falling behind early in a 103-83 loss to the Grizzlies on Friday. The Kings committed 31 turnovers against Memphis, but they were much better against Utah.\n\nThe Kings shot 43.4% from the field while hitting 10 of 33 (.303) from 3-point range. They had 24 assists on 33 made baskets with 16 turnovers.\n\nThe Jazz shot 41.5% from the field and went 4 of 21 (.190) from beyond the arc. Utah finished with 26 turnovers as the Kings turned up the pressure on defense.\n\nThe Kings outscored the Jazz 14-0 over the first 3:09 and went up 21-4 on a 3-pointer by Xavier Sneed with 3:44 to play in the first period. They led 23-9 at the end of the first quarter and continued the onslaught in the second, staging a 13-0 run to go up 40-14 on a basket by Colby Jones with 4:35 to play in the first half.\n\nSacramento led 48-25 at the halftime break. The Kings shot 47.5% from the field while forcing 19 turnovers and holding the Jazz to 33.3% shooting.\n\nUtah outscored Sacramento 24-17 in the third quarter and 21-17 in the fourth. The Jazz cut the deficit to 11 on a couple of occasions in the last 5:44, but the Kings maintained a double-digit lead in a wire-to-wire victory."
