        "text": "Gilas Pilipinas’ recent naturalized option Jordan Clarkson commences the year in record-breaking fashion, claiming a 20-point, 10-rebound, and 11-assist triple-double during their 127-90 homestand against the Dallas Mavericks last January 1, 2024. It marks the first for the Utah Jazz since Carlos Boozer's 22-point, 11-rebound, and 10-assist in February 2008 against a rookie Kevin Durant and the Seatle Supersonics.\n\nYouTube: NBA\n\nClarkson emerged off the bench around the halfway mark of the first quarter with first-year Keyonte George, dishing out a and-one opportunity to frontman Lauri Markkanen, giving the Tampa, Florida native his first assist. “Pure Wizardry” would follow, witnessing Clarkson’s no-look passes, shot-creating ability, and effective floor spacing, giving Salt Lake a 62-55 cushion coming into the half.\n\nThe Jazz sat in the driver’s seat for the remainder of the contest as Clarkson retrieved the rock on the defensive end following a misfire from Jaden Hardy with 2:28 remaining on the clock to secure his first triple-double of his 9-year-long tenure in the league.\n\n“[I’m] just happy to break that record finally. I know it’s been some time. My bad to my OG, Carlos Boozer…but yeah, that’s love,” he mentioned in a post-game interview.\n\nClarkson finished the Utah Jazz’s convincing 37-point victory with 27 minutes on 50 percent shooting from the field with eight defensive (two offensive) rebounds and one steal.\n\nInstagram: @utahjazz and @nba"
