        "text": "Utah Jazz is an NBA basketball team based in Salt Lake City, Utah. It was founded in 1974 as the New Orleans Jazz and moved to Utah in 1979. Since then, it has been one of the most successful teams in the league, winning two NBA championships in 1997 and 1998.\n\nOrigin in New Orleans and move to Utah\n\nThe Utah Jazz emerged in 1974, originally created in the city of New Orleans and becoming the eighteenth NBA team, with the name of New Orleans Jazz. From the very beginning they had a great star, the legendary Pete Maravich, who arrived from Atlanta in exchange for five draft picks. Despite his great level, the shooting guard suffered numerous injuries that prevented the team from achieving success during his first seasons, despite sharing a team with other players such as Lou Hudson or Walt Hazzard. Their best result came in the 1977/78 season, when they finished with a record of 39 wins and 43 losses, but without qualifying for the Playoffs.\n\nThis difficult start was compounded by bad decisions in the front office. Magic Johnson and Moses Malone could have been Jazz players. The Los Angeles Lakers acquired the services of the former in the 1979 Draft, thanks to a round from New Orleans in a trade for Gail Goodrich. As for Moses Malone, the Jazz had given up his rights in the Goodrich trade. In this way, the franchise got two of the best players in history out of their jersey, in exchange for a veteran Goodrich, who averaged 14.1 points during his three seasons with the team.\n\nCreation of the Utah Jazz\n\nIn 1979, the franchise moved to Utah, affected by economic crises and seeing that in New Orleans they could not survive. At first, the new team did not have much support from the local fans, but that would gradually change. Thus, the Utah Jazz of Salt Lake City appeared.\n\nBefore the 1979/80 season, they got Adrian Dantley from the Los Angeles Lakers, who would be the league's leading scorer in two seasons. They also acquired Darrell Griffith with the second pick in the 1980 Draft. In addition, during the season, Maravich was cut.\n\nDespite the strong performances of Griffith and Dantley, Utah Jazz did not qualify for the Playoffs in any of the four seasons following the move. This prompted Frank Layden, GM up to that point, to leave the front office to take the reins as head coach in the 1980/81 season.\n\nIn the 1982 Draft, the franchise selected the legendary 2'24 center Mark Eaton in the fourth round. But he was not the star of that draft, as the franchise selected the legendary Dominique Wilkins with the third pick. However, Wilkins refused to play in Salt Lake City, which forced Utah to trade him to the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for John Drew and Freeman Williams, who would only play one season with the franchise. Undoubtedly, one of the worst moves of the franchise, which could have changed its future.\n\nDespite the mistakes, in 1984 they would finish with a 45-37 record, finishing for the first time with a positive balance and winning their first division title. In those Playoffs they would go all the way to the conference semifinals, where they would be eliminated by the Phoenix Suns. Frank Layden was named coach of the year and Dantley finished as the top scorer, with 30.6 points per game.\n\nGolden Era\n\nThis good dynamic was confirmed when the team selected legendary point guard John Stockton with the 16th pick in the 1984 Draft. In the 84/85 season they would once again reach the Playoffs, with a stellar Eaton, with 5.6 blocks per game (still a record) and named DPOY. They would lose in the second round to Denver, after having eliminated the Houston Rockets of the Twin Towers . In the following draft, 1985, they selected Karl Malone with the thirteenth pick, which marked the beginning of one of the best pairings in history.\n\nThe following summer, Larry Miller acquired the entire franchise to prevent it from leaving for Minnesota, thus beginning a new era. Dantley was traded to the Pistons and Malone took the reins of the team, while Stockton established himself as the starting point guard. Thus they reached the 87/88 season, with a spectacular Stockton(13.8 assists per game) and finishing with a 47-35 record. In the Playoffs they would be eliminated by the champion Lakers in the seventh game of the second round.\n\nAfter this season, Frank Layden would leave the bench after 17 seasons, being replaced by Jerry Sloan. Already in the first season they would achieve 51 victories, with Stockton, Malone and Eaton in the All-Star team, but they would be shipwrecked again in the Playoffs in the first round against GSW. Before these results, there were changes in the roster, which led to a balance of 55 wins and 27 losses in 89/90. Malone averaged 31 points and 11 rebounds that season, and Stockton 17 points and 14 assists, making it clear that they were two of the best players in the league. However, they would disappoint again in the Playoffs, losing in the first round to Phoenix.\n\nFor the 90/91 season, the franchise continued to remodel the roster with the signing of shooting guard Jeff Malone, who arrived from the Washington Bullets. The team's performance was good, with 54 wins and 28 losses, and they would get revenge against the Suns in the first round in the postseason, although they would fall against Portland in the second round.\n\nIn 91/92, they moved to the Delta Center pavilion, with a larger capacity than their previous stadium, the Salt Palace. That season they would again achieve a great balance, with 55 wins and 27 losses. In addition, they would reach the Conference Finals for the first time, where they would lose to the Blazers with a 4-2 score, falling one step short of the NBA Finals.\n\nIn the following season, against all odds, they lowered their level, finishing with 47 wins and 35 losses, and with an injured and very veteran Mark Eaton. The doubts were confirmed in the Playoffs, where they would fall in the first round against the SuperSonics.\n\nIn 1994, forward Jeff Hornacek was traded from Philadelphia, who would give a great boost to the team. They finished with 53 wins and eliminated David Robinson's Spurs in the first round, as well as Denver in the second round. In the Conference Finals they would lose again, this time to the eventual champions, the Houston Rockets. Nothing would change the following season, as they lost again in the Conference Finals, this time to the SuperSonics. The doubts were already huge, and Stockton and Malone were getting on in years.\n\nThe desired Finals\n\nMalone, perhaps fed up with the constant disappointment surrounding the team, won the MVP (27.4 points/9.9 rebounds/4.5 assists) in the following season, the 96/97, and the team finished as leader of the Western Conference with a magnificent balance of 64 wins and 18 losses. It was a very solid team, with pieces like Hornacek, Antoine Carr, Howard Eisley or Byron Russell as luxury companions. Everything seemed to indicate that this was their season, and so it was. In the Playoffs they eliminated Clippers, Lakers and Rockets, reaching the Finals, where Jordan's fearsome Bulls were waiting for them. Although they managed to make things difficult for them, they would fall 4-2, in what would be Jordan's fifth ring.\n\nThe following season they arrived with the same roster, and once again finished with a great record, this time of 62 wins and 20 losses. In the Playoffs they eliminated the Rockets, Spurs and Shaq's Lakers with a humiliating 4-0, the first sweep the Californians had suffered since 1989. In the Finals, they would face Jordan's Bulls again. They won the first game, but lost the next three. Leaving the playoffs 3-2 after winning the fifth game, thesixth game came, one of the darkest nights of the franchise. The Jazz had an advantage on the scoreboard throughout the game, taking advantage of Pippen's injury and Rodman's poor performance, but then came the last seconds of the game, and Michael Jordan appeared. He stole a ball from Malone, got rid of Byron Russell, and scored the basket most remembered by all NBA fans, he scored The Shot . 4-2 and a new blow for the franchise, and especially for Malone and Stockton. It was their last chance.\n\nIn the following season, the 1998/99 (which was shortened by the lockout), they finished with 37 wins and 13 losses, and with Malone as MVP for the second time in his career, but they would lose in the second round against Portland. The seasons went by, along with the disappointments in the Playoffs. Stockton and Malone were approaching retirement and it seemed clear that they would retire without their coveted ring. In the '99 Draft they selected Russian Andrei Kirilenko, who brought vitality and defense to the team. But it was not enough.\n\nAfter a new disappointment in the 2002-2003 season, in which they lost in the first round against the Kings, the most golden period of the franchise came to an end. Stockton confirmed his retirement, and Malone headed to the Lakers as a free agent, in a last attempt to get the ring, although he would not get it either.\n\nLife without Stockton and Malone\n\nThe pair's departure left the team orphaned and no one saw it as a title contender. However, led by Kirilenko, who was an All-Star, DeShawn Stevenson and point guards Carlos Arroyo and Raúl López, they finished with 42 wins and 40 losses, just missing the postseason. For the 2004/05 season they acquired Carlos Boozer and Mehmet Okur, and traded Carlos Arroyo to the Pistons. But injuries to Kirilenko, Boozer and Raul Lopez weighed down the team, which sank to the bottom of the standings with only 26 wins, its worst record since 81/82.\n\nIn the 2005 Draft, they selected point guard Deron Williams with the third pick, who soon became the face of the franchise. Again, in the 2005/2006 season, injuries struck the team, but led by the newcomer they managed to finish with 41 wins and 41 losses, although it was not enough to qualify for the Playoffs.\n\nIn the second round of the 2006 Draft they acquired Paul Millsap, and in a trade with GSW they got point guard Derek Fisher. These moves raised the level of the team, and even Carlos Boozer was selected for the All-Star team, although he missed it due to injury, being replaced by his teammate Mehmet Okur. Deron finished with an average of 9.3 assists, only behind Nash and Chris Paul, something that propelled the team to 51 wins. In the Playoffs they reached the Conference Finals, after eliminating the Houston Rockets of McGrady and Yao Ming and the surprising Warriors, but being eliminated by the eventual champions, the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nDuring the following three seasons they would maintain their good level, with Deron and Carlos Boozer at All-Star level and Kirilenko as the defensive key. However, in all of them they were eliminated by the Los Angeles Lakers. In addition, the franchise suffered a hard blow in the 2008/2009 season, the death of its owner Larry Miller, who was replaced by his son.\n\nNew times\n\nIn the 2010 Draft, the Jazz selected Gordon Hayward ninth overall. That summer Boozer was traded to the Chicago Bulls as a free agent, and they also lost Kyle Korver and Wesley Matthews. A few weeks later, they traded Koufos and two first-rounders to Minnesota in exchange for Al Jefferson, and other players such as Raja Bell arrived.\n\nHowever, during that season, Jerry Sloan would step down as the team's coach because of his strained relationship with star Deron Williams. A few days later the point guard was traded to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for two first rounders, Derrick Favors and Devin Harris. With a new team and without its main star, the franchise spent a few years fighting for the Playoffs, but without aspiring to higher goals.\n\nIn the 2016/2017 season, they finished with 51 wins and 31 losses, returning to the Playoffs after five seasons. They eliminated one of the favorites, the Los Angeles Clippers, in the first round, but would fall to the eventual champions, the Golden State Warriors, in the second round.\n\nIn the summer that followed, George Hill and Gordon Hayward, the team's two leading scorers,left the team. The front office had to make moves to build a competitive team, landing Ricky Rubio and re-signing Joe Ingles for $84 million. In addition, they drafted Donovan Mitchell with the 13th pick.\n\nWith Quin Snyder as coach and with a great defense led by Frenchman Rudy Gobert, the team finished the season with a record of 48 wins and 34 losses, and in fifth place in the Western Conference. In the first round they would eliminate the Thunder of Westbrook, Paul George and Carmelo Anthony, but would be eliminated by the Houston Rockets in the second round (4-1). The following season the results were similar, finishing with 50 wins but being eliminated by MVP Harden's Rockets in the first round."
