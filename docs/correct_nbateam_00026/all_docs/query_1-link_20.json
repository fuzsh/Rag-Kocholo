        "text": "The Utah Jazz recently clinched the NorthWest division for the 2nd straight year. Who's the secret behind their success? Deron Williams and Carlos Boozer. A 77-66 last night win over the #1 team in the Western Conference, and the NBA's highest scoring team. The win agaisnt the New Orleans Hornets made it official last night and guaranteed at least the 4th seed in the Western Conference. What did star point guard Chris Paul have? only 4 points and 9 assists on 2-11 shooting, hardly spectaculasr thanks to Deron Williams. What did Tyson Chandler his counterpart have? 3 points and 9 rebounds on 1-3 from the field. Just terrible.\n\nBut not only do they play outstanding defense, their great on the offensive side too\n\nWhat other G-F tandem has over 50 double-doubles apiece ! ?\n\nThey have a 100 double-doubles between them\n\nBoth average a double-double\n\nBoth shoot over 50 percent from the field, 70 percent from the line, 35 minutes per game, average a steal per game, and have started in every game this season.\n\nCombined they average over 40.5 PPG, 12.8 APG, 13.50 RPG, and 2.6 SPG .\n\nCarlos Boozer came into the Utah Jazz system via free agency sevearl years ago after a outstanding career at Duke higlighted with a national championship in 2001. Boozer was then drafted to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2nd round with the 35th pick in the 2002 NBA Draft.\n\nCarlos averaged 10.0 PPG and 7.5 RPG in his rookie season. In his sophomore campaign, he averaged a double-double with 15.5 PPG and 11.4 RPG. After the 2003-2004 NBA season, a mixup occured between the Cavs, Boozer and his agent. The Cavs reached a understanding to let Carlos become an unrestricted free agent, and they would sign him to a new 6-year $39 million deal.\n\nHowever, once he was let go, his agent field calls from several teams in the league including the Utah Jazz. The Jazz then offered him a offer sheet from the Jazz, and Cleveland was unable to match it because of them being over the salary cap.\n\nCarlos then signed a 6-year $70 million deal with Utah in the summer of 2004. Since then he's averaged over 20 PPG 10 RPG. Carlos Boozer is averaging 21.4 PPG. 10.5 RPG, and 0.5 BPG.\n\nDeron Williams found his way into Utah via the Fighting Illni program and the 2005 NBA Draft. Williams was apart of the Illini's big three that featured teammate Dee Brown, and Rockets sharpshooter Luther Head. He led the Illinois to the 2005 NCAA Championship but suffered defeat by the hands of Sean May and North Carolina.\n\nDeron declared for the draft that year and was chosen 3rd overall (ahead of Chris Paul) by the Utah Jazz in the 2005 NBA Draft. Deron and Paul have begun a rivalry which Williams is dominating by holding Chris to under double figures twice this season. 12 points was Paul's season high against Deron.\n\nSince Williams has joined Jerry Sloan in Utah, Sloan has groomed him into of the game's elite point guards, just as he did with John Stockton. Sloan gives Deron more freedom and it reflects on 19.1 PPG, 10.5 APG, and 3 RPG.\n\nDeron Willaims and Carlos Boozer led Utah to series wins over Houston and Golden State in the playoffs, and faced the San Antonio Spurs. Before being eliminated from the playoffs, the Jazz managed to steal a game away from San Antonio. More games won against the Spurs in the playoffs than Lebron and the Cleveland Cavaliers. Both averaged over a double-double in that series."
