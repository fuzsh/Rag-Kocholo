        "text": "Jordan Clarkson did it! The Utah Jazz have not had a regular season triple double since Carlos Boozer did it in 2008. Now, one of the biggest droughts in the NBA is no more! Clarkson ends the game with 20 points, 10 rebounds, and 11 assists.\n\nIt was a lot of fun as Jazz fans who destroyed Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks by 37. Because he was close, and because Will Hardy cares about the record too, he kept him in the game. Watching it unfold was great especially because it wasn’t clear if Hardy would keep Clarkson in with the Jazz ahead. When he did you could feel the anticipation from he crowd.\n\nWhen it finally happened the crowd, and the Jazz bench, went wild!\n\nSeeing how happy the Jazz bench was when it happened was great. Will Hardy said that if you play for the Jazz, you have to give a s*** about the team. It’s clear this team absolutely does and it’s great to see."
