        "text": "I'm so excited for the Utes! Too bad they weren't like this when I was a student.\n\nAs for a pro football team, I really don't think it's feasable in Utah. Most NFL games are on Sunday. And while everyone may watch it at home, a lot of people might be worried about who'll see them out on the Sabbath. They would be hard pressed to fill the stadium enough to make the cost worth it.\n\nAnd with college ball being what it is here, games on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday night might be too much.\n\nA baseball team might work. The Stingerzz (or whatever they're calling them now) do alright, and the draw of seeing other MLB teams could draw enough of a crowd to make it worth while. But until then the Jazz are it.\n\nWOW\n\nGame stats\n\nKirilenko had 8 blocked shots, Harpring with 23 pts off the bench.\n\nHere's a recap in case you missed any of it...\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (Ticker) -- Carlos Boozer made quite an impression in his debut with the Utah Jazz.\n\nBoozer scored 12 of his 27 points in the first quarter as the Jazz cruised to a 104-78 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in their season opener.\n\nSigned by Utah as a free agent in the offseason, Boozer combined with All-Star Andrei Kirilenko to score all of the points in a 7-0 spurt to open the game for the Jazz, who never trailed.\n\nBoozer also pulled down 11 rebounds for his first double-double with Utah after recording 41 with Cleveland last season. The third-year forward shot 10-of-13 from the floor.\n\nKirilenko had four of his career-high eight blocked shots in the first quarter as the Lakers did not score a basket until Caron Butler made a layup with 5:30 on the clock.\n\n\"I think Kirilenko set the tone early with the blocks,\" Lakers coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. \"We made some aggressive moves to the basket and he erased them and got the momentum going, and that put us in a sort of frantic mode.\"\n\nKirilenko, who finished fifth in Defensive Player of the Year voting last season, helped the Utah defense hold the Lakers - sluggish in playing their second game in as many days - to a franchise-low 29 percent shooting.\n\n\"It feels good to have everybody helping each other out, playing defense,\" said Kirilenko, who scored 16 points and pulled down six rebounds. \"I think we won the game tonight because our team defense was so good.\"\n\nUtah led, 45-28, at halftime and pushed the lead to 25 points in the third period before Kobe Bryant took things into his own hands, scoring 27 of his 38 points after halftime.\n\nLamar Odom was the only other Laker in double figures with 14. In Tuesday's 89-78 victory over Denver, Los Angeles had four players reach that plateau.\n\n\"(Kobe) did it all tonight,\" Tomjanovich said. \"I thought Lamar got things going there a little bit, but we just couldn't find other guys to make shots here and there. Role players have got to make some shots, too.\"\n\nBryant's jumper with 6:03 remaining pulled Los Angeles within 77-64, but Matt Harpring scored 14 of his 23 points down the stretch as the Jazz pulled away.\n\n\"(Boozer and Harpring) played well tonight,\" Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. \"They got some baskets and were able to finish around the basket. That's what we have to do. Both of those guys can get around the basket and score.\"\n\nBryant, who dished out seven assists against Denver on Tuesday, had just one against Utah. T he Lakers had just seven, also a franchise low, while Jazz point guard Keith McLeod, who was starting for the injured Carlos Arroyo, had eight.\n\n\"When we did move the ball to the open guy tonight, we just didn't make our open shots,\" Tomjanovich said.\n\nMaking his first career start with Carlos Arroyo nursing a sprained left ankle, McLeod turned the ball over just once in 29 minutes."
