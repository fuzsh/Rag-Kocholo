While they were unable to win a championship together  they came up short in the NBA Finals twice, both times against Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls  they're recognized as some of the best players to have ever graced the hardwood, especially at their respective positions. Stockton is often viewed as the ultimate point guard and there are only two players in NBA history who have ever scored more points in their career than Malone.\n\nOn the strength of Stockton's passing and Malone's scoring, the two formed arguably the most feared pick-and-roll tandem in league history. In real life, 2002-03 was the final season for the duo, as Stockton retired and Malone joined up with Gary Payton, Kobe Bryant and Shaq to form a superteam with the Lakers. Again Malone came up short, losing the NBA Finals to the Detroit Pistons.\n\nWhile the Utah Jazz had a decent rebuild when they drafted Deron Williams in 2005 and teamed him with Carlos Boozer, they never made the NBA finals again. Let's see what I can do with the duo in their last season or two together.\n\nSystem: NBA2K11 PC\n\nRosters: RRP 2003 Mod\n\nSliders: RRP 2003\n\nDraft Class: 2002, 2003 Draft (RMJH4)\n\nSeason Length: 29 Games\n\nPlayoff Format: 3-3-3-5\n\nQuarter Length: 12 Minutes\n\nSim Quarter Length: 12 Minutes\n\nInjuries: On\n\nProgressive Fatigue: On\n\nPlayer Roles: On\n\nTeam Chemistry: On\n\nCPU Trades: On\n\nTrade Override: Off\n\nmarshdaddy likes this.\n\nLast edited by RMJH4; 07-02-2024 at 04:50 PM.\n\nRetro NBA Nut\n\nOVR: 19\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2008\n\nLocation: Ireland\n\nPosts: 1,555\n\nBlog Entries: 17\n\nKevin OConnor steps down as GM.\n\nKevin OConnor steps down as GM, stays with team.\n\nJune 9th, 2002.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY  Utah Jazz general manager Kevin O'Connor will relinquish his duties as GM and move to a top executive position within the franchise, according to several media reports.\n\nThe initial report came from ESPN, which also claims, according to NBA league sources, that former New York Knicks GM Mike Hobbs is the top candidate to replace O'Connor and that a deal is being finalized. Also, a report by the New York Times confirmed that Hobbs could be ready to return to the NBA after a one year absence with illness.\n\nHobbs, 40, played basketball in the National Basketball League in Ireland, graduating in 1992, and had been with the Knicks as Assistant GM for four years and then Acting GM for one. Hobbs helped guide the Knicks to the NBA Finals where they lost 4-2 to the Los Angeles Lakers. In June 2001, Hobbs was hired for the open general manager position for the Golden State Warriors. One week late Hobbs took seriously ill and had to rescind his contract with the Warriors.\n\nOthers who are reportedly targeted for the Jazz job are Phoenix Suns assistant GM David Griffin and San Antonio Spurs vice president and assistant GM Troy Weaver, who formerly worked for the Jazz for four years.\n\nThe 53-year-old O'Connor became the Jazz general manager in 1999 and is set to remain with the organisation as the President of Basketball Operations.\n\nO'Connor joined the Jazz organization just after the team lost to Chicago in back-to-back NBA Finals.\n\nEfforts by the Deseret News to reach O'Connor and Jazz president Randy Rigby Monday were unsuccessful.\n\nmarshdaddy likes this."
