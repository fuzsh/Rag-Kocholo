        "text": "Sophomore Cameron Boozer, the son of former NBA player Carlos Boozer, was named the 2023 Gatorade National Boys Basketball Player of the Year on Wednesday. It’s one of the most prestigious high school basketball awards in the country, and Boozer is only the second sophomore in the program’s history to win the award for boys basketball (Emoni Bates won as a sophomore in 2020).\n\nKevin Love surprised Boozer with the award Tuesday afternoon in the gym at Christopher Columbus High School outside of Miami in front of Boozer’s family, high school coaches and teammates. “I was definitely surprised,” Boozer said. “We were told we were getting measured for our [state championship] rings, and then Kevin Love just walked in with the trophy, so the whole thing was kind of crazy.”\n\nTwo-time NBA All-Star Carlos Boozer is launching a real estate career with his longtime broker and friend Katrina Campins of the Campins Company, according to an announcement. Boozer earned his real estate license last year. His role will focus on real estate services geared toward professional athletes, celebrities, and other wealthy buyers, the release says.\n\nLootMogul, a sports metaverse platform that spans NFTs, branded virtual real estate, and blockchain gaming, has secured a $200 million funding commitment from investment firm Global Emerging Markets Group. The firm will provide LootMogul with a share subscription facility of up to $200 million for 36 months in exchange for equity shares in LootMogul. Partnered athletes to sell NFTs on LootMogul include retired WNBA star Lise Leslie and former NBA players Carlos Boozer and Mario Chalmers."
